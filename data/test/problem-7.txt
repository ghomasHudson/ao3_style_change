"You think I don't know how you feel?" Before Harry could stop himself he was shouting too, "I lost my parents! I lost my godfather! I lost my only chance of a real family! I lost Dumbledore, I lost Lupin! I lost friends in the war, more than you could imagine! I saw my friends loose their family. I lost everything and everyone and just because I have a few people left in my life that I love, doesn't mean that I don't get how you feel! I've been through all of this already!"
"What did the healer want?
But Ron didn't listen. "How long have you known?" He asked Hermione instead.
"I said thank you, you arse.", Draco said. Harry smiled satisfied.
"I know. And sometimes so do I. But I'm sure he wants to punch us all in the face sometimes, so why don't we just all punch ourselves to death and forget everything?", Harry joked.
"I don't know yet when I'll be home." Potter told the weird thing, "I'll talk to you later."
Without saying another word, Harry and Teddy stepped out of the lift and made their way to the Floo Portals. Harry wasn't really in the mood to discuss his personal life with strangers, he'd rather have strangers leave him alone. Harry was sure something about this would pop up in the
"Harry?" Sirius mumbled sleepily and turned to look at Harry.
Malfoy and Teddy watched each other intensely and Teddy reached out to Draco with an interested look. Harry saw Draco's hand twitching.
Harry didn't know what to do. It would be creepy walking up to Malfoy now that he had his eyes closed, but it would be even creepier if Malfoy would open his eyes and see Harry standing there watching him. Before Harry could even decide what he was going to do, he heard Malfoy talk.
"Then don't do it!", Harry answered loudly.
"I think it's great, though, that he came today." Harry said.
"You do?" Draco breathed out in relief, "Oh, good. Well and I guess I'm sorry for treating you like this for all those years. And I'm really, really sorry for your godfather."
"Potter," Malfoy whispered and shook Harry, "Pssst, Potter."
"This is Peter."
Once everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonnagal told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs, and follow her. She stopped in mid-sentence, as her eyes fell on Draco.
As they entered the kitchens, three house elves stormed towards them and greeted both of them happily.
Ron looked at Harry, shrugged and then they both ran after her. On the next corridor they caught up with her. Harry grabbed her wrist.
Harry fed Teddy with mashed pumpkin and the grownups ate spaghetti with pumpkin. When Teddy was in bed, Harry sneaked back downstairs to watch
"In my room. I remembered I had to do something," Harry answered and saw in the corner of his eye that Neville looked at him curiously.
"Arguments...
Malfoy grabbed his bag wordlessly and walked out of the room. Harry looked after him.
They spotted Hermione's waving hand. Just before they reached her, Ron tugged at Harry's wrist, signaling him to prepare himself. As soon as they stepped in front of Hermione, Harry knew what he should prepare himself for. Ginny froze mid-sentence and stared at Harry.
"Coming," Draco said, shoved his letter and wand in his pocket, grabbed the trunk and the box and left the room.
After a moment, Draco let go of Harry's hand. "My father and aunt were there." He said, "She killed him, didn't she?"
Nott's head looked in, followed by his body. Then, the door flung open and Zabini and Goyle stood in the door frame.
"Hey." Harry said.
Draco jumped up and ran towards the bathroom door. He pushed it open and stormed to the toilet, sank to his knees and threw up. The sound must have woken Potter because he now came inside and watched Draco.
. I only want
"Are you okay?", he asked whispering.
Harry smiled gently. "That makes me happy."
"Goodnight, Malfoy.", Harry whispered back. He closed his eyes and was fast asleep.
"Potter.", Draco hissed, "Potter, wake up."
"Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter." The new headmistress read aloud.
doing-" Harry started, but Hermione shushed him.
"Well, but you don't live here!"
"Thanks.", Harry grinned, "I bet Madame Pomfrey thinks the same."
Then, she turned to Harry.
It turned out, Ron and the others really could have been glad they had separate tents and strong silencing charms. When they lay next to each other in their heated up tent, Draco stared at the ceiling, hand behind his head, and smiled. He couldn't believe he was engaged. To Potter!
"He won't harm you. Not one scratch and not one swearword.", said Harry.
, Potter. There is no
"Oh, sure, of course." Hermione said understanding and nodded.
"Relax," Potter said quietly. His voice was very soothing and Draco took a deep breath.
"Not much." Harry said half heartedly, maily focusing on getting out of the store as fast as possible so his ice cream wouldn't melt.
Potter didn't answer that question, he stood up and walked around his stool, his hand gliding softly over the dark brown wood. Potter glanced at Draco and for a second, Potter gave him an encouraging smile.
"Attracts me, yes. It's so sexy.", Harry nodded hastily. Draco grinned. He shrugged and kissed Harry.
"Your mother, yes.", Potter said.
"Are you looking forward to be bored to death because of Trelawney?", Potter asked laughing. Draco rolled his eyes and laughed slightly.
"How are you?"
"Patronuses complement each other with their loved ones'.", Potter spoke finally. Draco's mouth fell open.
When he found back to Hermione and Ron, they paid for everything and hurried to the Leaky Cauldron because Ron was already hungry. After they ordered Harry told them that he had met Malfoy again.
Harry suddenly felt like he had a panic attack. He breathed heavily and his mind was racing. How should he say this? No matter what words he will use, Malfoy will say no. What will happen if he says no? Even more important, what if he says
"Why not?", Harry asked and furrowed his brow.
"I'm not one of those who can easily hide." Luna and Neville sang as they stepped out from behind the same tent.
This wasn't the answer Draco had expected to hear. He expected Death Eater or Slytherin or murderer, but not Dobby's old master. Draco hadn't heard from the small elve in a long time.
Some students were standing in groups, talking. As the three of them passed, the others looked after them, but Harry tried to just ignore them. On the bridge, Hermione stopped. The wind blew her bushy hair into her face and she pulled it behind her ears.
Harry sighed as he walked from one bookshelf to another. He was startled when a few books fell on the floor. Harry looked around and could see a flash of blond hair vanishing behind a bookshelf. He squinted his eyes.
"I'm not gay. It's... only him.", Harry said and scratched the back of his head.
"I'm not. I don't want to see all these people staring at me and thinking about hexes they could use on me the second I leave the hall. Even
"What are you wearing?" Harry laughed when he woke up around half past ten.
"Ron, you're ruining our perfect order." Neville laughed.
"I want to be sure that he's lying. If he is, a trip to the library can't harm," Ron said.
"See you.", he said, but didn't walk away, because Draco grabbed his waist, and because he didn't want to.
"This isn't normal," Draco whispered.
"Good evening Mister Draco.", one house elf said. Draco smiled weakly and sat down.
Draco wasn't bad at giving hand jobs. No, not at all. In fact, on a scale from one to ten, he would make a good ten. Last night, for example, was incredible. Harry smiled. Draco could always manage to make him happy, no matter in what damn idiot situation he was.
"Well then there shouldn't be a problem."
"Draco...", Harry said, but he was sure Draco wasn't listening.
"There you are." Malfoy sat up in his bed and looked less in pain than before.
"Hi Harry."
When the singing ended and everyone laughed and clapped again, Harry wanted to get off the stage as quickly as possible, but Hermione grabbed his arm.
Harry watched Ron, then Hermione, then Draco step into the fireplace one after the other and vanishing into green smoke. When it was Harry's turn, he looked around the house first, then clearly spoke where he wanted to go - the Burrow.
Draco nodded. He somehow felt relieved he didn't have to explain himself why he'd come home after Theo even though he hated parties.
"Then let me.", Draco said and made an attempt to slip past the boys.
With Potter that close to him, he really believed he could manage it this time. He thought the happiest memory that ever crossed his mind. Yes, it was a powerful one. He pictured it and spoke the words:
Harry didn't want to answer. He was ashamed of thinking so, but somehow he didn't get out of his head what Nott had said.
Malfoy took a step back and breathed as hardly as Harry himself did. Harry smiled, even though he didn't know if he should. He didn't know if Malfoy still was so upset about his mother or if he just had to let out some steam. Malfoy looked down on Harry and then on himself and then - to Harry's utter surprise - chuckled. It seemed ridiculous to Harry now too, how both of them were completely wet as if they'd just gone swimming with their clothes on. Harry started to shiver a little and Malfoy suggested they went back inside to dry themselves up.
Harry nodded. He, too, had been up to vomit three times. They slowly drank their tea and enjoyed the sound of the rain pounding against the windows, both closing their eyes again for a while. Harry dozed off, but only for a minute, because then Hermione came into the room. Her hair was bushier than usually, but she didn't look as hungover as the two boys.
"Potty.", he whispered.
Malfoy's eyes met Harry's and Harry felt a sudden warmth inside himself. What was happening?
The feeling was glorious and Draco moaned too loudly. Potter moaned in response, then pressed his lips to Draco's, not kissing him, just holding them against Draco's mouth, puffing hot breaths over it with each twitch of his hips.
Then, there was a picture, where Draco was with Dobby.
like this? I have never been nice to people, not even to my own friends, and especially not to Harry Potter. So if I say something like this and then to
"Anyways", said Hermione quickly before an arguement broke out, "I think you should just try and be nice to her. After all, she let you go in the forbidden forest, didn't she?"
Mr Weasley was in a real celebration mood when he took out the bottle of Ogden's Old firewhisky from the cupboard. Everyone was of age, so he didn't hesitate to pour them a drink, though Fleur didn't take one (obviously). Now Harry knew why she had refused to drink the eggnog. Teddy got rather sleepy now and Angelina and Fleur offered to put him to bed. Harry gave him a kiss and handed him over, but he was going to look after him not long later.
"What are you dreaming about?", Potter asked after a while they just lay there in silence.
It was the first time ever that Draco looked for something that had to do with Muggles, but he needed to know the people Potter was growing up with. So he searched for the perfect book that will help him to understand the Muggles better. And he found the perfect book. With it under his arm, he let Madame Pince write it down on her notebook and walked up to his room.
"Come on, get dressed. The rest of us is already downstairs.", Ron said and walked into the bathroom.
"What?", Potter asked. Draco didn't answer. He stared at his knees until Potter lifted his chin so Draco looked at him.
"Because it's over." Draco answered.
"His father", Harry repeated, "put Draco under pressure that he had to marry a rich pureblood woman and they will have pureblood children and all this Malfoy-shit, and so Draco thought he was mot allowed to have feelings for me. And he bullied me. We both thought it was false to fall in love and so we learned to hate each other." Hermione nodded slowly.
"You are." Harry said and shrugged.
Harry laughed, rolled his eyes and closed the door. Harry joined Ron on the sofa and grabbed the TV guide.
"Let's go." He said to Harry, who looked down on him wordlessly.
"Yeah, I guess so." Harry said shrugging, "I was up against fame, hate and Voldemort from all sides."
Malfoy nodded slowly. Harry looked up, the blonde boy mirrored his movement, and for a second their eyes met. Harry felt heat rising to his cheeks and was glad the fridge was right there to cool him down again.
"Yeah, mate, she's right. He's still the same selfish slimy git.", he said. Harry stood up furiously.
"No, it's not..." Draco stopped. He didn't know what it was and he didn't want Potter to think he did know.
"I beg your pardon?" Malfoy asked.
Draco stared at him and stood up. He left his stuff on the armchair and walked up to their room and of course Potter followed him. Draco didn't want to talk about this. He had been perfectly fine the two weeks before when Potter hadn't thought it would be so important to talk about it. Now Draco rolled his eyes not because he was annoyed of his own thoughts but because he was annoyed of Potter's stupid question that he had to answer right now or otherwise things between them got fucked up even more. But Draco didn't want to admit it was good. Because it wasn't. No, it wasn't. It was bad, really bad.
"Alright. I'll be in the empty classroom on the fifth floor. If you have any questions or something, come up there. Come up at half past eleven and the potion should be ready.", Harry told Malfoy, who nodded again. Harry smiled and went to leave.
"Yes, it is."
Draco looked after Potter, who turned around a corner and vanished out of sight. Draco slapped himself. What was that please? Had he completely lost his mind? Draco breathed out and slowly walked to their room.
"Potter!", he said loudly and walked downstairs.
Harry smiled and nodded. He stood up.
"What's wrong?", Hermione asked with a worried look. Harry rolled his eyes. He completely forgot how annoyingly easy to worry Hermione was.
. He always tells us what a catch Marty is." Ron laughed.
"Why would he tell us then?", Weasley shrugged. Granger nodded.
"Malfoy, tell me.", he said calmly.
"And I remember that I was so uninterested about the whole thing." Malfoy answered "To be completely honest, I wasn't interested until I spotted you."
The fire in the common room was slowly going out and the lights were dim. Neville enjoyed the silence when everyone else was asleep and he could just focus on his book about plants. Ron was usually already asleep very early and he was snoring so loudly, Neville couldn't possibly read in their room. Since he couldn't go to Luna's room and he wouldn't be able to concentrate there anyways, he figured he'd stay awake for as long as it took the others to go to bed. Today, it was around eleven when the last group split up and left for their dorms.
"Draco Malfoy, son of prominent Death Eater Lucius Malfoy and proud Slytherin, had his arm around Potter's waist and with Potter's friend Ron Weasley, he helped Potter to stand straight."
"I'm sorry but-" Harry said, "You look
?" Ron spoke the word "him" in a tone like Draco spoke about Ginny.
Draco closed the door again, shutting the room out of view. "Let's just go upstairs then."
"Hermione, we wanted to get going. Harry's feeling a bit overwhelmed." Ron said.
Potter looked at him astounded and Draco smiled awkwardly. "Have you?" He asked. Potter nodded. "Well I had two girlfriends but with Cho it was just kissing and with Ginny we only came to the oral part. But I had sex with a guy before. A few times."
"I'm tired.", he said and attempted to stand up.
"Why?" Hermione asked and whipped around in her chair, "Harry are you failing Potions?"
Malfoy nodded, took a deep breath and then let go. Harry smiled proudly and wanted to take the tray of food, but Malfoy was faster. He stuck out his tongue and followed Hermione out to the terrace. Before Harry could leave the house, Ron stopped him.
"Hm?", Harry asked again unaware of what he had meant with it.
"How are you?", Cedric asked.
Again, everyone laughed. Little did she know...
"Um... good- I guess.", Draco answered and hastily shoved a potatoe in his mouth.
"Bloody hell, Harry.", Ron asked.
"I need to go now.", Harry said nervously and opened the door.
Harry shook his head. "He can't just show up here and expect me to forgive him. That's not how it works."
"What are you doing there?", Malfoy asked. Harry took one step back from his bed.
Malfoy only nodded.
"I hope you don't mind," Percy repeated.
, hm?", he asked, smirking.
"You drive me fucking crazy!", Draco said.
What message? He thought Potter wouldn't want to talk to him. McGonnagal smiled.
"What's your problem, man?" Harry asked.
"About Muggles.", Draco added. Now Potter smiled surprised.
"Okay. See you later," Potter answered and Draco left the room. On his way out, he came across Weasley and Granger. She snarled at Draco, who laughed and walked past her. They had no idea. It was when Draco entered the Great Hall that he realised he hated being alone. This was not how his last year was supposed to be like!
"A bloody expensive one.", Harry added nodding.
Harry rolled his eyes and he and Ron left the stage again. Hermione pushed herself through the people. She flung her arms around Ron and kissed his neck and cheeks. Harry started to feel uncomfortable, but Hermione let go of Ron and smiled at Harry.
"Shit.", Draco cursed to himself. If he could see Potter's dreams, could potter see his? What happened here? Draco closed his eyes again and drifted off to sleep.
"He is hoping to help the children that have the horror of growing up without parents, and wants them to find a family that loves them no matter what, just like he found one in his friends at Hogwarts."
"You were thirteen when you produced your first Patronus. I'm 18 and I haven't produced one.", Malfoy said and his eyes looked sad.
As soon as the door was closed, he was pinned against the wall by Draco, who kissed him harshly. Harry felt a strand of blond hair falling loose from Draco's hairdo, that was all geled back. Harry smiled, as the strand tickled is nose and pulled it back behind Draco's ear. Draco was incredibly good at kissing, maybe that's why Harry wanted to do it again and again, until he was old. Did Draco practise? With who? Not Parkinson, right? That would be completely- He had been with them today. But he was good at kissing at the lake, too. Did she- no. That was...
"Malfoy, I just-"
Seamus and Dean looked at each other. Dean made a movement with his hand, that signalled Seamus, that he should go on.
"Do you even listen to yourself? The door is locked. That means something. You can't just waltz into someone's
"You're not going?" He asked surprised.
"What else would you be doing?" Hermione asked with a suspicious look.
"What's wrong?", Harry asked. Malfoy shook his head.
"What are you doing?" Malfoy said, grabbing Harry's wrist.
"Apart from that, I look way better than her.", Draco added.
"No, I mean did he look healthy?"
"I don't know, Potter.", Draco said and looked at his bread.
"I don't know maybe four or five times. Not more. Definitely not less," Potter answered and shrugged.
Weasley crossed his arms in front of his chest. "I'm worried you're going to act out, get aggressive, lose your nerve. We all know it happened."
"Library?", Goyle asked and they headed to the library.
Malfoy didn't say anything. Harry rolled his eyes and scoffed. He grabbed his broom tightly and walked away.
"Nothing."
Harry was surprised and lost for words when he opened the door. Malfoy stood on the doorstep in the rain, he had dark circles under his bloodshot eyes and a stubbly blonde beard was visible on his face. Harry furrowed his brow. He cleared his throat and needed to gather the thoughts in his head. What was Malfoy doing here?
"Oh, hey Lydia." Harry said and put on a smile.
"Draco, stop thinking about this." Pansy said and laughed.
"Would you please shut up?", Harry asked, but Draco wasn't listening.
"You're so..."
Seamus sang "If I was a sculptor..." when he stepped out from behind another tent and joined the others around the bonfire.
"Does master need Kreacher's help?" The elve asked grimly when he saw Harry carrying a handful of towels.
Harry smiled proudly and leaned back in his chair. Hermione rolled her eyes and leaned back as well, her arms crossed and her face cold.
Potter laughed.
"What?"
"Um..." Draco was a bit startled, "Quite good actually. And your's?"
"I don't mean to say I have been innocent all these years, of course I have always had a special hate for non-Slytherins, but I feel like you have shown me how wrong this is. You stood up against the hate and the Dark Lord when you lied to him in the forest and I want to thank you for this."
"Yeah, you know...", Ron said and scratched the back of his head.
Harry just shrugged. He couldn't quite understand himself what was going on.
In front of him was a shower. Draco undressed and stepped in. The water was cold at first, but it warmed up quickly.
"Shut up." Draco said.
"But we did.", Potter had said.
Harry shook his head. "Not suits, no."
"No, not yet.", Harry answered and scratched the back of his head.
"Lift your shirt.", Potter said.
"Hey Malfoy." She said nicely.
"Have a nice day.", he said with an evil smile.
"Don't think she has time for this." Zabini answered.
So he sat awake and tired on the floor, his eyes red and burning. He didn't know what to do, how to make things right. He didn't even know where Potter went. He didn't know how to get in touch with Potter, he didn't know if he was at Weasley's house or if he was somewhere else. Draco remembered that Potter's godson or something was at the Weasley's. So maybe Potter was there too. But how was Draco supposed to know? He knew nothing.
in the garden now."
"Yeah. George said it would be a good way to make money. He was right.", Dean answered.
A lot of students came out. Then Matt came outside. "You waited for me?" He asked excited when he saw Harry, but Harry didn't answer. He walked past Matt and towards Malfoy.
After a few minutes, Draco stood up and walked over to the three new first years. He looked down at them.
"Hi, here's Harry Potter from the pub last night." Harry answered.
Harry blinked and tears rolled down his cheeks. He sobbed and whipped his cheeks with his palms.
Draco stood up angrily. His temples hurt and his fist was itching to grab his wand and hex this whole family, especially the stupid uncle of Potter's.
"Do you like it?" Draco asked, but he already knew the answer.
Potter kept shouting strange nicknames for his cousin and pulled Draco behind him to a door.
"I can't believe they still call you
"Potter."
"That's nice." Lydia said, "Sometimes you just have to do nothing."
Flynn lost his bravery once again as Harry and Neville pulled him to his feet. They grabbed his arms and pulled him out of the library, leaving books and quills on the table. Harry didn't like what they were doing, but he didn't like that this boy almost was the reason for Hermione and Ron to break up and Harry also didn't like the way this boy talked about his friends. After the war, Harry had felt more peaceful and calm but now it seemed like Voldemort was controlling his mind again. They pushed Flynn against the wall outside the library and pulled out their wands.
"Why did you never tell me you could paint?", Harry asked and sat down next to Draco on the couch, showing him the pictures.
"You've read about it?", Harry repeated in disbelief. Draco nodded.
"It's... I don't understand what happened. How you can forgive him. How he can forgive you. It doesn't seem logic to me."
Draco didn't leave the group until they entered the common room. He looked around. He always felt weird when the common room looked like this, when it looked...
"We have to be quick.", he said.
Harry walked over to him and saw, what made Draco that scared. He held a big, red howler in his hands.
Harry shoved his shoulder. "Oh shut up."
Harry took a deep breath. He saw Malfoy was holding back his tears, what made Harry smile from ear to ear. Draco gripped his hand even tighter and licked his lips before he started to say his vows.
Harry followed him to the window and let the stupid bird in. He got bitten before he was able to untie the parchment from its foot and cursed out the grey owl. Luna watched them curiously as they came back to the couch. Harry sat down between his friends and unrolled the parchment. Harry didn't know the bird nor the hand writing, but as he read the letter, he jumped back up.
Ron turned to look at Theo. "How did we never realize earlier that they had a thing for each other?"
"I don't know. I think it was because I admired him so much. I didn't admire him because he was a dark wizard, but because he was strong.", Draco said shyly.
Harry laughed. Even though this situation was far from happy, the fact that Draco wanted to see Teddy made it all seem a little better. He decided he would go as soon as possible the next morning.
Harry laughed. He still wasn't done with the whole tournament, but he felt like the happiest person on earth.
Harry lied. Someday Harry had to tell them, he had to tell them what was between him and Malfoy. But how could he, if he himself didn't even know what there was between them? Harry sighed. When they reached the Great Hall, you could already hear the buzz of voices from hundreds of excited students in the corridor.
"Went with these two girls I met." Theo said and Draco could hear that he was very proud.
"Alright," Draco agreed, "But first let's see what happens."
be there.
His mother looked at him, then at Potter and back at Draco and shook her head smiling.
"I feel lost." Malfoy said quietly.
Draco looked at Theo, who raised an eyebrow. Draco didn't know why he didn't want to open the letter. He guessed it must have something to do with the things Weasley had said. Draco grunted. He'd never thought that something Weasley said would bother him that much. And now he actually was afraid that Potter would think it would be best if Draco wouldn't come. How did it happen that Draco was afraid of something as silly as this?
Potter smiled and Draco finished his whisky.
Harry didn't know if she was mad or trying to be nice. Then, her face broke into a grin and the question was answered.
"Potter!", someone shouted behind him.
They stood in front of the South entrance of the Ministry of Magic. Even though his father had been in the ministry most of his time, Draco had been here only once and they had used the North entrance, therefore this entrance was new to Draco. Narcissa turned to her son and looked at him.
"I'm not sick," Draco spat, as if he had just been deeply insulted.
"You don't even have to
He stumbled over to her, while she searched a book.
Gregory Goyle walked downstairs. His face was still pale and he didn't look very healthy, but he seemed to feel better now.
Harry was somehow proud he had marked Draco like this and grinned.
"Stay," he demanded.
Potter shook his head in disbelief. "Wow. This is-" he turned to Draco. "You are amazing."
"Where's you're room?", he asked Potter, who still didn't get rid of his beautiful, but somewhat idiotic grin.
sat. Narcissa sighed, snapped her fingers and juice was brought in by a tiny elf, not much different from the one they had had all those years ago.
"Yeah right. You're so rude, Potter." Malfoy joked, but followed Harry inside anyway.
" and the lights on their wands went off. Harry took off his glasses, put them next to his wand and pulled the blanket over the two of them.
Harry, Neville, Seamus and Dean agreed. The three girls stayed while the boys sat down on the bench in front of the shop. Ron made choking noises.
"My happiness depends on you.", he said.
"Can you sing this song again?"
Everyone in the Hall seemed to think the same thing - Harry Potter the saviour, and Draco Malfoy a Deatheater in one room?  What a tragedy! The hall was filled with loud whispers. How the hell did McGonnagal come up with crap like this? And why did she even trust Draco enough? What was going on???
Harry turned around once. Ron and Hermione stood there and exchanged confused looks, so Harry mouthed that he was sorry. Harry looked at Malfoy, who now let go of Harry's arm.
"I'm going to the birthday party of my boyfriend's best friend. They're all pretty classy and haughty, so I don't want to look sloppy. That's what I'm here for."
"Don't be shy, they aren't here." Seamus said.
"I want to see your morning routine," Harry grinned.
The movie was called
Malfoy whipped around on his stool. "Hi." He said half-heartedly.
"All my life I have been in prison. In the prison of my own thoughts, of my father's thoughts, of the Dark Lord's thoughts. I can't escape them. These little voices that are in my head tell me how wrong something is and how bad I should feel. And I can't disappoint my father. He taught me everything I know and I owe him everything. Living with him can be hard sometimes, but I can't change it. He raised me with prejudices and hate and loyalty. Prejudices against mudbloods and muggle lovers. Hate against everyone who doesn't support the Dark Lord or doesn't live up to my father's expectation. Loyalty towards him. It's been like this since I can think. And my father hates you because you don't support the Dark Lord even though he he offered you several times and because you even fought him. So I have to hate you. Because I don't know anything else. And anything else isn't right."
"We only want to protect you." Harry looked at Ron.
He wanted to feel every inch of Potter's body against his. Potter's kissed changed from sensual to hungry. Draco heard himself making noises, all kind of noises. Potter groaned.
"It's nice to be back," Harry said, "and under such nice circumstances."
Draco looked up at him and forced a smile, what made Harry love him even more.
"You won't pass me around like a whore." Draco said annoyed.
Malfoy nodded understanding and looked into the cauldron. The potion had a yellow-orange colour and smelled like old shoes. Draco grimaced and Harry laughed.
"Right?" Draco asked uncertain.
Ron stared at Harry, his eyes wide and his mouth opened.
"Just follow us." Ron said to Harry when he looked at him questioning.
"How is she?" Harry figured would be a good start.
Draco watched Dean and Seamus through narrowed eyes.
Harry nodded slowly even though he couldn't shake the feeling that this was his fault as well.
"Malfoy!", Harry said and held Malfoy by his wrist.
Harry nodded while sipping his refreshing lemonade. He swallowed and smiled at the prickly feeling in his throat.
He got up from the stairs and so did Harry, who didn't really know if he should say something even though he really wanted to. Malfoy walked on the street and looked around if anyone was coming. When there was no one in sight, he prepared himself to mount his broom. That was the moment Harry really wanted to say something, but he didn't want to seem cheesy. Harry then convinced himself to speak, but as he opened his mouth, Malfoy was faster.
Harry took a step back.
The others went all quiet, Ginny looked at Harry with big eyes and Dean smiled proudly. Draco's face was completely blank, until he sat down next to Harry. His mouth stretched into a wide grin.
knew?" Ron repeated in disbelief and laughed.
"Draco left with Moody to McGonnagal's office.", Harry said.
"What's going on?" He asked.
"And don't call her insensitive.", he added. Draco snorted.
Draco watched Potter tracing his finger up and down his glass.
The laugh seemed to cool Malfoy down and he looked at his hands. On his wrists were two red stripes. As Harry noticed this, he wanted to laugh again, but Malfoy pointed at Harry's neck. Without asking, Harry turned to the mirror and saw a big love bite. Harry turned back to Malfoy, who was looking at Harry in shock.
"Yeah, actually you have to go to classes without me. I have a meeting today."
"Who's that?", he asked.
Harry nodded wordlessly and Hermione came inside. She put her hand on Harry's shoulder and smiled.
"Ron, she's always been like this. Remember first year when she explained to you what immortality was, like she thought you wouldn't know? I could list you so many events like this where she thought she was the most clever person on this earth. That's Hermione and you know it. She doesn't think anyone is stupid, she only thinks she's very clever and she is and you know it." Harry said "That's the same Hermione you fell in love with."
"These fucking sounds make want to do things to you..." Draco said.
"Don't lie. I can smell his food til here.", he said.
"Harry!", Granger said loudly and ran towards them.
"Draco.", his mother said, but Draco shook his head again.
"Okay, then. We make a deal. Every evening at eleven, we'll sit together and talk, alright?", Potter suggested. Draco nodded again.
"Yeah, it wasn't a pleasure to sit next to a screaming letter with the voice of Lucius Malfoy. And he was so angry. Told Draco, he was a disappointment for the whole family."
Malfoy knew what Harry meant. He nodded, t didn't say a word. Harry needed to know what the reason for his trip to the hospital was, and who was responsible for it.
"Only some of them." Harry answered, "But not all them time though."
"Holy Merlin!" He said excitedly. "HOLY MERLIN!" Harry laughed. "And then he just left?" Neville asked, Harry nodded and Neville walked up and down in the room.
"No, Draco. It's alright.", Potter said and lay his hand on Draco's knee. Draco nodded.
"I didn't... shut up." Draco turned away, but Potter lay his hand on his shoulder.
"Oh my god!" Draco said under his breath, but Potter must have heard him because he nodded agreeing.
When Harry woke up, it was already the next morning. His stomach was rumbling, Harry hadn't been this hungry in a long time. Malfoy was still asleep.
"I know," he forced himself to say. His lips stretched into a smile, but it probably looked like a grimace.
"What?", she asked.
"This is not upsetting. It's perfect." Draco stroked Potter's back and pulled him
"And where's your partner?", Parvati asked Harry.
"No, I love them." Harry said and Malfoy smiled. This was so crazy.
"I know you're sorry." Hermione finally said and sighed.
"What's wrong with you? Just because you have a crush on me, I'm not responsible for you being a bitch!", Draco shouted back.
None of the elves answered for a while. Draco stood there, bottles of whiskey in his hands, surrounded by elves and looked around at them.
Potter lay his hand carefully at Draco's chest. Draco flinched.
Malfoy pulled away and they both stared at each other. Suddenly, Harry's heart was hammering against his chest and he had a really strange feeling about all this. They both hushed into their beds. Harry stared against the ceiling.
Harry was happy.
Malfoy's eyes hushed over Harry's face and Harry nodded slowly to reinforce his statement. Malfoy nodded understanding. Harry turned around and noticed that this was not a good idea because now their chests were touching. Harry wanted to take a step back but hit the sink with his coccyx. Malfoy smirked.
He wasn't angry. Well maybe he was, but mostly he was just frustrated because he was suddenly feeling all these things and he didn't know what they were. Draco realized that all he wanted was for Potter to understand how he felt even though he didn't know it himself.
Harry tangled his fingers into Draco's wonderful soft hair and pulled him closer. Harry's heart was beating so fast and loud, he thought Draco could feel, or even hear it. They broke away from each other.
"I need to know." Harry said, "You can't imagine how it was to find out you're at the hospital and someone attacked you."
"Mr Harry Potter, who is training as an Auror, called for a second trial with Narcissa Malfoy, wife of Lucius Malfoy and mother of their only child Draco Malfoy, present."
They could have used some lube, or something to ease the movements of their bodies, but Draco found it too trivial to worry about that. He rather worried about thrusting upward, trying to make Potter move faster, but Potter distracted him by slipping his tongue into Draco's mouth and then rudely pulling away. Draco's tongue followed it, demanding a proper kiss. They met halfway, sliding their tongues together, not even touching each other's lips.
His eyes shot open and he looked around. What the hell? Where had he been? What did these people do to Potter? What the fuck?!
"How are you, boy?", he asked and clapped Draco onto the shoulder. Draco laughed.
"I'm really happy too. It feels really great." She grinned. Harry was incredibly happy for her.
The other three wizards Draco didn't know greeted Potter as well and every one of them gave Draco and his mother dirty looks.
While the sponge scrubbed the sink, Harry heard the bell ring. He looked at his watch and realised Molly was a few hours early.
"Can't you please stop arguing all the time?", Harry asked his boyfriend and his best friend.
"Because..." Malfoy stopped to think, "Because you care!"
"Malfoy, don't be mean," Potter said.
Draco captured Harry's lips again with his own again, then let go.
The group walked mostly in silence. Draco felt really uncomfortable and like he didn't belong with them at all. On their way, the by-passers told them to wish Potter good luck and to get well soon. Draco, on the other hand, was never addressed, he was just frowned upon. By the time they reached the doors of the hospital wing, Draco decided he wasn't going be grumpy anymore and appreciate that his... Potter was getting out.
Ron hugged Harry as well and also wished him a happy birthday, what it already started out to be.
Harry leaned over Hermione to tickle Teddy. "How's my little boy doing?"
"Sure, why not?"
"True.", he agreed and eyed the table closely. Draco watched him.
Harry smiled.
"Ridiculous." Pansy said grinning.
But Harry smiled softly. "No one will say a word."
He cried out of frustration that Draco thought Harry was happy without him.
Sitting down on the sofa, Harry told Luna and Ron what had been going on at St. Mungo's and why he was back home for now.
They left the room again. Narcissa opened the door to another room, in which a warm fire was crackling. On the walls were shelves with books, but these were no regular books. These were photo albums. Narcissa searched for a specific one pulled it out.
Harry felt a bit embarrassed. Malfoy looked so perfect, everything about him was just neatly done.
Draco felt nervous. He didn't like to watch this woman touching several parts of Potter's body and mumbling these things.
"So we-"
"He could have thought about that before he forced me to live with and serve a man I was scared of since I was little.", Draco answered bitter.
So Draco tried to lift his arm from Potter's torso as carefully as possible so he wouldn't wake him up. Potter's lip twitched and Draco froze, but the Gryffindor stayed sound asleep. Draco breathed out relieved and slowly sat up, while watching Potter's face. When Draco got on his feet and Potter still hadn't woken up, Draco sneaked behind the curtain, lit up his wand and was ready to leave the hospital wing. Madame Pomfrey shot up when she heard Draco walking by, but when the light of his wand illuminated his face, she breathed out, nodded and sent him on. Draco had to be careful he didn't get caught, because students weren't allowed out of bed at this time. Luckily, he made it to the common room without crossing anyone's path.
and Draco found himself in the arms of his father. He smiled and let go.
Harry rolled his eyes and ate the rest of his cookie. Malfoy copied him. Harry tried to figure out if Malfoy liked it, because his face didn't give anything away.
"Hey! Always time for you, darling.", Harry said, winking and Draco blushed incredibly.
"So. The sorting of the first years is done. I can only say 'Welcome to Hogarts'."
"We were at the Ministry today." Harry told Malfoy when they lay in bed in the dark, "I can start my training as an Auror right away."
Food piled up on the golden plates in front of them and Harry and Ron did as they were told - they dug in deep.
"I kept most of the house as it was. The family tree for example.", Potter said.
"Only you can now if you can risk it." Hermione said.
Draco only shrugged. "It was worth annoying Potter."
Harry read the letter from McGonnagal again. The term this year, as every year, was starting on September the first, even though Ron had repeatedly said that rebuilding Hogwarts would take more time than planned.
"I love you." Draco said.
"Well, I suspect you don't want me to come with you in our room, so...", he turned around,
Behind them, a plate shattered and the waitress groaned annoyed. Draco smiled into their kiss.
"Who?", he asked. Harry remembered that Malfoy had no idea who Hedwig was and what happened to her and he didn't want to talk about it.
"Come on, dear. We have to."
"You don't honestly think that, do you?" Ron asked, "You remember that we are talking about
"Someday we have to talk about him!" Harry turned around and pointed at another spot on the floor, "And this is where your deranged aunt held Hermione and tortured her and I had to listen! I had to listen to her screaming and crying while we were held in that cellar!"
Seamus opened his mouth to answer, but Dean was faster. He stood close to Draco.
"No, Ron she doesn't." Harry said.
"Don't you dare.", Vernon said threatening, but Potter laughed again.
"Harry, you don't have to do this.", Hermione Granger said and looked between Harry and Malfoy.
" to what Harry replied with "
"Right back at you!"
Draco laughed and shook his head.
"Eat this, it'll help.
"She won't.", Potter said optimistic.
They just sort of fell to kissing again. Draco couldn't complain. Having Potter's hand on his cock, his own wrapped securely around Potter's, and then Potter's tongue in his mouth, was about the best combination of
Harry stood up and held out his hand.
"Merry Christmas, Draco.", he smiled and kissed him.
Hermione chuckled. "So we wanted to make sure we don't invite someone you don't want to have there."
"He's probably angry at you.", Ron suggested shyly.
Hermione couldn't hold herself back and started crying. "I'm sorry, I know you don't want me to," she said, but Harry just wrapped his arms around her and pulled her closer.
This was the perfect moment for Harry to tell her, he was going to tell Ron later after classes. So he told Hermione about how him and  Malfoy had kissed a few months ago and how they have been in the Shrieking Shack and how this has been going on for almost two months now. She didn't say a word, Harry saw she couldn't believe she had been worried about Malfoy killing Harry. Harry looked at her, unsure of what Hermione thought about this. But she didn't judge him, she didn't insult him or Malfoy. She had known that Harry liked boys just as he liked girls, but she hadn't known that he liked
"I want you right now. Right here.", Potter pressed on.
"Being Harry Potter in a room full of wizards and witches can be really hard. Especially when every two minutes someone comes up to you and wants to talk."
"Potter is at the hospital wing right now.", he told him. Weasley and Granger exchanged a look.
Malfoy slowly turned around. Harry looked up at him. Everything was blurry.
"Hello Peter! Long time, no see!
"You know, we're really going to miss you." Dean said on their way back down to the common room.
Draco looked at Blaise, who only shrugged. McGonnagal started to list pairs aloud from a roll of parchment, "Hermione Granger and Padma Patil. Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter." And so on.
"Understood it so far?", he asked and Draco nodded again.
"Spectacular.", Harry said, even though he didn't feel spectacular at all.
Harry didn't know what to say to this, but he knew what to do. This time it wouldn't be wrong - it certainly didn't feel like it. Harry took a deep breath and closed the gap between him and Malfoy, pressing their lips together. Harry's eyes fluttered shut.
"I love you too."
Ron looked up.
Harry went on and on about the evening and about Malfoy's library and he told them about Malfoy's talent on the piano and that they had kissed again and that they have been flying around the next morning.
to be one.
"Draco?", he asked carefully.
wanted to meet
Potter flinched. "It's alright Malfoy, you don't have to show me your tiny little pale sausage. I don't even want to see," he said and held his hands up protectively.
"I think, from what I've heard and seen, that you and Malfoy get along quite alright by now. And I think you can risk going there, I mean he really seems to have changed and if not, you can always disapparate."
the table broke.
don't make any sense!" Neville said.
But against all odds, Draco's thoughts drifted off, he yawned, his eyes fell shut and Draco fell asleep.
"Parkinson? She's not on good terms with him, is she?", Hermione asked with a slight laughter.
"She does, but to be honest we don't reall know what's going on in Draco's life, so..."
"Hello, little boy.", Harry said and bent over to Scorpius, who fisted Draco's sweater and smiled.
"Why would I ever tell anyone about my stupid favorite ice cream flavor! Who the hell cares?"
When the friends sat down in the Great Hall, everyone else was already eating.
They nodded and sat down at a table, watching the two boys at the bar closely. Harry sat down on the stool next to Malfoy and when Malfoy didn't want to look at him, Harry grabbed the seat of Malfoy's stool and turned it in his direction.
Potter smiled and hugged him as well. Weasley looked at Draco too.
They both froze when someone knocked on the door.
"It was.", Potter said, "It was on purpose and it definitely wasn't a joke." Draco smiled.
This was a joke, right? Oh God, what was he doing here? Playing friends with Slytherins?
"No.", he answered, "I'd rather not stay."
"Um, another thing, Professor." Slughorn smiled again.
Harry smiled and lay his hand on Malfoy's thigh, what made him shut up.
Harry understood. Ron and the rest of the Weasley's had wished for Harry and Ginny to be together for ever.
It was the first time they kissed in front of people other than their closest friends. Everyone got up and cheered and clapped, what made Harry smile against Draco's lips. They were now husbands and it was the most wonderful feeling he has ever felt. Hermione handed Harry his godson and he and Draco held him together as they posed for a picture that Colin's little brother Dennis Creevey took. Harry and Draco left the Great Hall hand in hand. Excitement rushed through Harry. He didn't know he held his breath until the doors closed behind them.
"Because I'm not going to let you make fun of me " Malfoy answered annoyed.
"You're not going to damage school property." She said hotly.
"Don't say that. You know it's not true," Harry answered.
"Coming here was the best plan ever.", Potter grinned, "I should thank—"
"I have to do some more homework," he said.
Harry nodded, clearly aware of the fact that Draco couldn't see him.
Malfoy seemed a bit overwhelmed with the question and he needed a long time to answer.
stared at him when he entered. No one said a word. Longbottom looked at Potter with a weird look on his face and Potter shook his head almost unnoticeable. Draco didn't concern himself with them. He closed the door behind himself and vanished into the bathroom. As soon as the bathroom door fell into it's lock, Draco heard Potter and Longbottom whisper outside. He didn't understand a word they said but only rolled his eyes. The whispering stopped. Draco came back out, walked over to his desk, grabbed his school stuff and left again.
Draco turned to the next page and furrowed his brow.
A few people that walked by were glancing over. It must have looked weird - Harry, an eighteen year old man, surrounded by four girls, signing weird-looking newspapers.
Harry snapped out of his thoughts and nodded absently. "It's just-" He sighed, "It's the Slytherins, you know? Thing like that never ended well."
"Do you plan to move or should I fetch you some tea?", he asked, shocked to find that his voice could go so low. Potter blinked at him, then smiled, his chest pressing against Draco's.
"Yeah as if that works," Neville laughed.
Hermione and Ron looked at each other, then at Harry and furrowed their brows.
"Don't stop," Harry murmured sleepily. Malfoy smiled and Harry felt a sudden warmth inside himself. He still wasn't used to Malfoy smiling. And then smiling at
This sentence hit Harry like a bolt. How- why? Why would he think that? Why would someone raise their child in the belief that being weak is wrong?
"The blonde one?" Harry asked and as Malfoy nodded he said, "Yeah, I didn't care much for her but Seamus seemed to be ordering a lot of drinks."
"Love and kiss to you, mom."
"You need two hours to get ready. I don't want to know how long it takes when Potter is coming." Theo said with a chuckle.
"Well, he said I should fuck off and make fun of someone else," Potter answered.
"You don't remember anything from last night?" Harry asked.
"Oh god!" Hermione cried out again, "Oh god! Look at it!"
Should he go? What would he say? What if Potter didn't react like Draco wanted to? What if Potter wasn't there? What if-
"Idiot.", Harry said laughing.
"Stand up.", he ordered. Malfoy looked at his hand with obvious disgust and stood up without Harry's help.
"Well, of course I knew it must have been awful, but I- I never thought about how much it really must have affected you. If you can't even tie your naked boyfriend to the bed..."
Harry stifled a laugh. It was ridiculous how similar Draco and his father were, how much messed up hair angered them both.
And now he was walking circles in the lonely Room of Requirement, his hand trailing beside him on the wall and his eyes red from crying.
Hermione bit her lip. "You think so?"
Malfoy's hoarse voice made something inside Harry tingle. Malfoy sat up straight and Harry turned his position so he could watch him. Malfoy looked around for a second, then looked back at Harry.
Pansy came running down the big stairs and hugged him, while Narcissa greeted Potter with a friendly smile.
"Why am I so stupid?", Malfoy shouted, obviously to himself.
Draco stood up.
Before Harry turned away, he gave Malfoy a smile. Ron walked in just before McGonnagal started the lesson. Harry was surprised that she, as headmistress, was still teaching classes. He planned to go and have a talk with her later. But first, he had to pay attention in class.
"I said 'wait', not 'stop'," Potter smiled.
"Yeah, wash off that Potter-smell!"
Harry couldn't quite explain what it was but something about Malfoy's tone made him angry. Maybe it was the fact that Malfoy wanted to leave all of a sudden even though nothing was wrong. Or maybe it was something Harry had tried to hold back before.
"Is he yours?" The witch suddenly asked.
After a pause, Draco got up and cleaned his mouth with a towel.
He didn't want to wake him, but if Madame Pomfrey caught them, it would be horrible. Thank god, the curtains were closed.
He slowly and carefully turned his head to see Malfoy sleeping right next to him. Harry's left arm had been falling asleep in Malfoy's grip and Harry held Malfoy's hand with his right one in his lap. Harry widened his eyes and turned back to look at Hermione again. Luckily Ron either wasn't awake yet or at least not in the room. Harry couldn't imagine how Ron would react if he would see Harry and Malfoy like this. To be honest, Harry couldn't quite imagine how Malfoy himself would react.
Draco felt something burning inside him. He knew what Potter was up to! He knew it. He wanted to sabotage Draco and his mother and didn't want to help, no, he wanted to blame his father for more than he had done or for more than the ministry knew. Draco looked at his mother, who was only smiling softly at Potter, ignoring Draco's look.
Nobody said anything for the rest of lunch. In the evening when the sun set, Harry put Teddy in the small crib next to his bed and took a shower while the others made themselves comfortable on the couch. Harry came back downstairs to find Ron, Ginny and Hermione standing at the front door.
"Looks fantastic, Harry.", Hermione said and sat down next to Ron.
As Harry turned around, he saw Cedric jogging up to them.
"Alright." Harry said holding back his smile, "See you around."
"I'm still in the shower!" Draco shouted back.
"You are family now. But if you ever hurt him, I will torture you with the Cruciatus Curse for days and days until I finally kill you with a whip of my wand."
"Wow." Harry said and put his glass back on the bar.
"He really said that?", Draco asked and his eyes lighted up. McGonnagal nodded.
Harry sat down on the bed with Hermione. He didn't know what this was all about, but she was her friend and he wanted to be here for her.
"If you think so," said Ron and turned to Neville to talk to him.
"He's a Death Eater, Harry.", the boy tried to defend himself.
"No, I'm-"
Before Harry read the last sentences, he heard the water stop and Malfoy stepped out of the shower.
"What do you want to know?" Harry asked, trying to keep his voice steady.
Malfoy went home in the evening. They would see each other in three days on Christmas Day when they would go to the Burrow. It was snowing really hard now, so Draco took his broom with him and stepped into their fireplace. Seconds later, he vanished into a green smoke. Harry said good night to Ron and Hermione and gave them some private time.
The brewing of the potion took a long time and Harry checked his watch every now and then to make sure it will have finished the time he told Malfoy to come.
"You sound so fucking hot when you're in pain," he whispered and licked Potter's earlobe, what made the boy wince.
With that, Ron pulled Hermione away and they left Harry and Malfoy alone. Malfoy glared at Harry with a slight smirk.
"Woah Weasel, why so mad?" Malfoy provoked him.
"Why didn't you visit him all week?" Granger asked.
But as Harry insisted on a second round, Malfoy caved and the figures moved back to their original places. Now Harry concentrated really hard and only a few moves in he already was happy with himself. Malfoy groaned annoyed and leaned back in his chair when Harry's knight smashed his villager. Harry chuckled.
"Of course she does."
He was really happy Malfoy even invited Harry, that meant he was proud enough to present himself with him.
Malfoy smiled a painful smile. "Yes, genius, I'm awake."
These were her final words. Ginny stood up angrily and caught up with the two other girls. Harry grumped annoyed and walked towards Ron and the other boys.
Narcissa took the hand of her son and both of them disapparated.
"Yes." Draco answered and carried on hanging up the black suits. He took out his black underwear and placed it in his closet as well.
"They dueled each other in the dueling club in second year." Theo started, "They suspected each other whenever something happened."
"It's his name, isn't it?"
"So..." Malfoy started, but same as Harry, he had no idea what he was supposed to say.
?" Theo asked.
"Yes, the war." Harry said smiling, "I remember."
"Harry what-" Hermione shrieked when she saw Harry out of bed, but Harry shushed her down. "What are you doing?" She whispered outraged.
Harry was glad that Ron and Hermione got back together, he was really happy about that. Really. But their relationship only got stronger because of the fight and now Harry felt somehow left out and alone. Whenever they hung out together, the two of them were snogging and whispering and giggling - something they didn't even do when the were a new couple - and Harry sat next to them in silence.
evening." Harry said and smiled.
"What happened to him this time?", she sighed and shook her head.
Harry thought it was for the best to not say anything. He just shook his head and left.
"Ron! Fred!" Mrs Weasley shouted.
Both he and Hermione jumped up and asked Harry what was wrong. "What did the letter say?" Hermione asked.
"To be precise, I have a Slytherin in me.", Harry smirked. Draco slapped him on the shoulder and laughed.
"No." Malfoy said looking at Harry, " Forget it."
Draco stepped back and tugged at the hem of Harry's sweater to show him he should take it off. Harry obeyed and pulled the sweater off, revealing his scarred but well-toned and muscular chest. Harry couldn't hide his grin when he saw Malfoy biting his lip. Harry wanted Draco to take off his pullover as well, but Draco hesitated. Harry furrowed his brow.
"We do.", he answered and smiled.
Harry grappled at the collar of Draco's shirt, and he was on his tip-toes, angling his head into it.
"From Potter?" Draco asked and his friends shrugged. "For God's sake! He's not one to give you orders."
Draco didn't answer. He had no idea how he should ever tell his son-how he should ever tell his son, that he would fuck his super hero. Draco bent over and pressed his lips to Harry's. And only a few minutes later, the car squealed and shook in a fast rhythm. Groaning and moaning filled the car and Draco was out of breath and so was Harry.
It was thirty minutes before midnight. Draco sat in front of the fireplace and waited until his mother contacted him. And she did.
Malfoy nodded. "I am."
"But when we are there and he knows you have our consent, he might listen," Weasley agreed.
Harry told them what had happened and Hermione slightly shook her head.
"Nice to see you too, Malfoy.", she said and smiled, even
"I will kill everyone who thinks otherwise.", he said and shrugged.
"No, Hermione, I'm not," Harry said and tried not to sound too annoyed.
Draco looked up. He had expected his mother to be mad for helping Potter, but now she was just giving him a bad conscience. This wasn't fair. How was he supposed to know she would be so sensitive about this? Since when was his mother sensitive about
"Well... that's your name, isn't it?", asked Harry and tried to hide his red face.
In the hallway, they passed a little cupboard under the stairs and Draco felt Potter's hand twitching.
Harry broke into tears.
"You didn't seem to have a problem with him when you invited him to my birthday!" Harry said.
Luckily, Harry and Malfoy were sober enough to stand straight and walk without supporting each other. They grabbed their brooms on the way out. The streets were empty and the air was chilly. Harry froze a bit, but the alcohol made him forget about it.
Draco's heart sunk immediately.
"Great," Malfoy said, aware of the fact that Harry had already said it a hundred times.
The library looked exactly as boring as it had done before the war. The dark brown bookshelves were filled with countless books. Some of them were very old and some of them looked rather new. Hermione stormed towards one new book that caught her attention. The binding was a light beige, unlike the others that were a lot of shades of brown.
"You didn't speak to Parkinson about that, did you?"
"No, it's fine, thanks.", he said and forced a smile.
They didn't talk for the rest of their lunch. Harry was annoyed about himself that he didn't knew what was going on inside him.
"Yes, I were. But now shut up.", he answered and Draco smirked.
"Yes?" The healer came over to the three boys standing in front of Draco's door with worried looks, "Can I help you?"
Ron nodded.
"What do you want here?", Granger asked.
Harry finally stepped out of the shower and hugged Draco from behind.
They danced and sang and danced a little more. Just after Theo had opened a bottle of champagne on the stage, Harry and Draco walked over to him.
quite amusing, I can't deny that." Malfoy answered.
"Snape was right!", his father repeated loudly. Draco was confused, so seemed the others.
Draco heard them getting up and walking over to him. He threw up once again. This was so disgusting!
If the situation would have been different, Harry would have thought this was a beautiful scene to look at. Malfoy, the beautiful boy, his hair as silver as the glistening snow around them, walking around Hogwarts, his robe flying behing him in the wind. But this wasn't a good situation, and especially not one Harry wanted to remember.
Harry smiled. Malfoy was really kind of cute when he freaked out. "Let's just, you know, sit."
"I don't think about
"Do you want to sleep?" Malfoy asked and Harry nodded.
But he didn't stare at Harry or did something that could make Harry uncomfortable, he undressed himself, what made Harry blush, and stood in front of the mirror, washed his face and combed his hair.
"He must be miserable."
"Nope." Daco rolled back and kissed Potter on his forehead.
"Hey.", he said quietly, "You look-"
Harry thanked her and got up. He grabbed the door handle, took a deep breath and went inside. The sky outside was painted in pink as the sun rose. Draco looked so small and fragile lying in his hospital bed. There were several monitors around the bed, measuring Malfoy's heartrate and blood pressure and oxygen levels. Harry stepped closer. He noticed that the healers have taken off his clothes and dressed him in a hospital robe. Draco's left forearm, where the faded Dark Mark was, was wrapped in bandages and he had several scratches on his face. Harry held back a sob as he took Draco's pale hand and didn't feel him squeezing back.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Neither are you." He said, suddenly raising his voice.
"Harry."
Draco blinked. He remembered that day. It was when Potter and his two friends had brought the sword of Gryffindor to their house and aunt Bellatrix had gotten furious. Draco remembered how she had thrown the knife towards the disapparating group, but he had never thought about what had happened after. He had never imagined the knife stabbing - let alone
"I thought you would hate snuggling.", he said. Draco laughed.
"Where?", he asked.
Harry smirked.
Malfoy grabbed Harry's hand and didn't let go of it until they were back inside and the door was closed behind them. Every step they took made weird squishing sounds because of their wet socks inside their shoes.
"Are you alright?" He asked.
"Have you got what you wanted?" Hermione asked oblivious.
"I don't want to leave you alone now."
The sky was already dark outside, but the lanterns illuminated the platform. Hagrid and the first years left to the boats and Draco and Blaise left with the rest to walk to the carriages.
"You don't go to classes because of
"Told me my parents died in a car crash and I wasn't allowed to ask about them. Locked me in a cupboard." Draco could see Potter swallowing and the finger at his glass began to shake. "I didn't know I was a wizard till I was eleven. They didn't want me going to Hogwarts. Told me I was a freak just as my parents."
"I don't want to be in this conversation. I'm going to the common room.", she told the boys and left.
houses," Ron said and rolled his eyes.
"I beg your pardon?"
Harry narrowed his eyes, but shrugged unimpressed and made some tea. Ron took Pig and the tiny bird flew out of the window and through the air to the Burrow.
Now, Draco looked at them with an even colder look than any of these girls could ever have managed. Year-long exercise. But before Draco could answer, he heard a familiar voice from behind him and breathed out relieved.
"I just don't know how it's supposed to work out. It's not even that she may have had something with this guy, the worst thing is that I thought she would. I really thought she would cheat on me and I didn't trust her at all. But I do. I really do. I would trust Hermione with my life. I love her and I just don't want to lose her. Not to the guy from the library and not to anyone else. She is my girl and I want to protect her and keep her close to me. But I can't. She doesn't let me close to her. I ask her every evening if we want to hang out, but she says she's too busy with studying and stuff and I hardly see her anymore," Ron said and a tear rolled down his freckled cheek.
"Do you have any idea where he could have gone?" Parkinson asked.
Draco nodded.
Malfoy nodded wordlessly and Harry nodded too. He really hoped that Narcissa would feel better.
Draco grabbed Harry's hand and Harry lay his other hand on Draco's waist and they started dancing to the slow song. Madame Maxime and Dumbledore danced close to Draco and Harry and Dumbledore winked at Harry. He smiled back and concentrated on the steps.
"No, I've got everything on Hermione's list." Harry heard him shout from the living room. Hermione hugged Harry as a goodbye and he stepped out the door.
Teddy started to cry and had a shocked look on his face. He sobbed and held his ears and Harry started rocking him back and forth, trying to calm him down.
Draco smiled only at the thought of his favourite things to do. He put out the water, dried himself with a towel and got dressed. He walked back into their room and saw that Potter still wasn't awake. Draco rolled his eyes again and started to unpack his suitcase. Blaise had said he was going to do something with his new roommate - a Hufflepuff. Since Draco didn't like to do something with a Hufflepuff, he had decided to stay in his room for the whole day. While he was standing in front of his closet and hung up his suits, Potter finally woke up.
Ron dropped his hands defeated. Harry was glad he didn't decide to shout again, and one look at Hermione's face told Harry that she was glad too.
"What?", Harry asked and for the first time since a long, long while, Draco heard anxiety in his voice.
Malfoy crawled on the floor over to his bedside table. He looked so vulnerable and lost. Neville knew he had said he would punch Malfoy in the face, but seeing him like this... it just wasn't right. No one should be seen like this. So Neville got down on his knees as well and sat next to Malfoy. Then Neville turned around and waved Ron over to them. Ron sighed and then did the same thing.
"Then let's get back to the class," Draco said and was seemingly disappointed.
When they finished dinner, the friends left the Great Hall. On their way through the giant doors, Malfoy came over to them and walked with the group.
"Don’t you want to?", Draco asked.
"Yeah. To understand your stupid family better.", Draco answered unimpressed and finally turned around.
"Hermione, I want you to know that I do this because, as you already know, because I am deeply in love and I want you not to freak out. Please.", Harry said and after Hermione nodded agreeing, he continued.
"Can we please talk about it?" Potter asked so suddenly it made Draco flinch.
"Potter.", Malfoy's voice sounded in Harry's head. He turned around and looked at the other boy.
Malfoy nodded. "Fair enough."
Draco swallowed. Damn it. He couldn't be here. He just couldn't. Merlin, Potter was hopelessly ensnared. Much more so than Draco had dared to imagine.
"Sorry.", he said and smiled tiredly. Draco kissed him.
"And then?" Neville asked and looked so excited like he might need a bag of popcorn.
"Father.", he answered.
"I'm not starting anything." Harry said defensively.
Down in the Great Hall, Harry and Neville sat down with the rest of their friends. During lunch Neville poked Harry in the shoulder and when Harry looked up, he immediately saw what Neville meant. Malfoy was coming through the doors. He looked miserable, completely different than a few hours ago - even paler than usually, his hair wasn't gelled back for the first time ever. He looked as if he was shaking when he sat down on the former Slytherin table.
The roles had changed back. Draco was the one who commands them and they follow his rules.
"What are you doing?" The four boys looked behind Draco.
Harry and Neville looked at each other, then Harry nodded. "Okay. Let's do it."
Draco rolled his eyes.
hand."
"I don't have the right to tell you things Harry told me in secret. And I thought we have better things on our mind right now," Hermione said and gestured around the hospital wing as well.
"And you?" Harry turned to Malfoy, who quickly stuffed a pastry into his mouth and nodded wordlessly.
"Out."
"Morning.", Harry said and sat down next to Ron. He looked at Ginny, nodded shortly and the looked away. Ginny rolled her eyes.
His thoughts drifted off and the voices of the people around him became dull. He wondered
"Oh, fine, fine thank you. And yourself?" Harry answered not quite truthfully, but polite.
"And? How are you?", Malfoy asked.
tuesday?
Malfoy nodded. "I could imagine that, yes."
"Pull yourself together, Draco!", he said loudly. Harry wondered what was wrong with him, but then he remembered that it was Malfoy inside there and so Harry didn't want to find out.
"And does Malfoy think so?", Seamus asked.
"Ron, but you will help in the kitchen!" Mrs Weasley bellowed after them, but Ron only waved away and joined the rest.
. But luckily, Malfoy knew what to say.
Potter looked at Draco with tear-filled eyes.
"I didn't mean it as an insult." Harry said and Malfoy only nodded.
"Malfoy." He answered shortly.
Ron laughed. "Well, I guess you would have made it on the front page."
Harry shrugged. "She asked me what my relationship to you was and I didn't want to be kicked out, so I said the first good and plausible thing that came to mind."
After a short while, the train started to roll and Harry leaded back. He was heading home. "I haven't slept all night because I was thinking of Teddy." Harry told Hermione, Ron was already asleep.
Malfoy looked at him with his mouth open. Harry looked at him and frowned at the sight of Malfoy's stern grey eyes. But then, the grey eyes softened.
"Since lunch, I guess. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger came in to bring Mr. Potter some food. And then Granger left to get Mr. Malfoy and the rest of the group. And Malfoy never left," Poppy answered.
"He was a friend of my parents too. My dad, Lupin, Sirius and Pettigrew were always together and they were best friends since first year. Pettigrew betrayed my parents, not Sirius, but Sirius was there at the time. Pettigrew was clever enough to cut his finger and transformed into a rat. The ministry thought Sirius killed all twelve Muggles that were there and saw everything and that he destroyed Pettigrew. So they sent him to Azkaban for twelve years, until he escaped. You know, in our third year. He came to see me and to tell me the truth. You know about Dumbledore's army?"
He was so excited. This box had made him crazy for months now, since the first day Harry and Draco moved into the same dorm room. Harry tried not to get his expectations up too high, but the way Malfoy had announced it, Harry was sure it had to be something special. And even if it wasn't, it was special to Malfoy and that made it special to Harry as well.
"Just checking in." Ron said, "Do you need help?"
"Morning.", she said and looked at Draco.
"I wasn't." Malfoy agreed nodding.
"Me too.", Luna said and followed Hermione.
Ron shook his head and sipped his tea. "Not at all. Been up half the night wandering to the toilet."
"Shut up.", Harry said and tasted his cheese.
As Granger let go of Potter, she looked at Draco, didn't say anything and stepped back.
His wife looked at him for a second, then walked up to him.
Harry was shocked but somehow couldn't help smiling. He wondered what made Malfoy write this to him. Was he so bored at home? Or did he want to see Harry again? Or just really wanted to get rid of the jacket? Harry didn't even want to have his jacket back. Malfoy looked much better in leather jackets than he did.
"Of course I would, thank you!" Luna said excited and flung her arms around Neville.
Potter rolled his eyes. "Sorry."
"I'm Matt," he said suddenly.
She felt ashamed because she wanted Harry and the git of a Malfoy to make out and probably thought it didn't work out when the two of them had vanished from the party. Maybe she thought Harry and Malfoy had a fight. If they actually had one, Harry couldn't remember.
"Oh, come on, Harry, as if he hadn't given you a hand-job already.", Dean said and laughed.
"You wanted to know who Hedwig was.", Harry answered. Malfoy looked up.
Harry looked back at her and nodded slowly. "I do have an idea." He turned to Hermione. "Take care of Teddy, I'll be back as soon as I can."
"It did?", he asked excitedly. Potter nodded.
Hermione clapped in her hands and stood up.
Draco didn't pay attention on where he was walking, and so he found himself nose to nose with a fat seventh-year from Gryffindor, who was surrounded by four other boys. One had his wand pressed into Draco's back, the other three held their wands chest high. Draco breathed out.
Malfoy finished his cigarette, exhaled smoke one last time, stepped on the cigarette butt and then turned so he looked directly at Harry. Harry looked at his grey eyes that glistened in the moonlight, and his breath fastened. He didn't know that look in Malfoy's eyes. Harry didn't know whether to back off or not, so his complete body froze as a defense mechanism.
"You do?" Hermione asked and sounded like she was trying not to squeal.
"Well then good luck and have fun," Neville said as they got up.
He followed Potter back down to the living room, where he sat down on the couch. Potter offered Draco something to drink, but Draco insisted on getting it himself.
Harry narrowed his eyes, but let Ron go. Something was definitely off. Harry followed Ron to the living room and joined his friends on the sofa. They played a few games of Wizards Chess until the sun slowly but surely went down. Malfoy was determined to look casual tonight and to Harry's utter surprise, he asked him to help with that. Harry was more than happy to do so. When they got upstairs, however, they didn't look for an outfit for Draco. Harry was thrown backwards on the bed and Malfoy sat on his hip. Harry grinned. They were so cheesy.
Draco couldn't see why he should be nice to Potter
"I know, I look horrible," he admitted.
"Scorpius, darling, search a seat, will you?", Draco said and Scorpius nodded courtly.
"What?", Draco asked.
"Petunia!", he shouted inside and not two seconds later, a woman stood next to him.
Potter had been there with Theo earlier when Draco had been released from St. Mungo's. He and Theo had had a short talk outside of Draco's room while a healer helped Draco get dressed out of the robe and into his regular clothes. Draco wasn't going to stay with Potter for the coming week, he would be at home with Theo but Potter had said he would visit. What Potter didn't know, and what Draco wouldn't tell him, was where he and Theo were going.
"I think I'm in love with him," Harry said.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Isn't there a saying that goes
"Did Malfoy kill you? Harry?" Weasley asked.
Just as the two of them wanted to sit down on the couch, an owl soared in through the kitchen window and dropped an envelope in front of Malfoy's feet, gracefully turned around in one movement and swooped out through the same window. Malfoy and Harry both looked at the parchment envelope on the floor, before Malfoy slowly bent down to pick it up. Harry watched Malfoy curiously as he opened the envelope and read the letter. Malfoy didn't say a word, but Harry could see that something wasn't right.
Draco laughed.
"I would appreciate it if you could give me a second to get comfortable," Draco said.
"You made my bed," Potter pointed out.
Theo and Pansy looked at him wordlessly, their jaws dropped and their eyes widened. They couldn't believe what they had heard, even though they probably should have expected it.
Harry didn't know what to do. They wouldn't find out more, after everyone they knew stayed at the pub. He looked through the chats again but didn't find anything interesting. Then he thought he could look through the pictures, maybe there would be something. Malfoy watched every movement Harry's thumbs made on the screen. As soon as Harry had opened his gallery, he stared at Malfoy.
Harry nodded. "I am," he said and smiled. McGonnagal smiled too.
He had done it! Harry had actually kissed Draco Malfoy. Maybe Malfoy wasn't
"Malfoy, this is Lydia." Harry said, "Ron, Hermione and I are regulars in here, so we know practically every employee here." He quickly added grinning because of Draco's resentful look.
"Goodbye Potter." He said and Harry had to snicker.
"As if you haven't got enough to worry about at the time, Potter.", he said with a roll of his eyes.
Ron and Ginny rolled their eyes. "Mooom!"
"Ouch." Ron rubbed his shoulder, "Go on." He said to Harry.
"Are excited for the meeting tomorrow?" McGonnagal asked. Harry nodded.
Harry smiled. "You didn't ruin anything, it's not your fault."
Draco really had to fight back his laughter. They were so ridiculous. Potter shoved his shoulder.
Draco nodded. The elf danced away again. Draco looked up and his heart leapt. Potter entered the kitchens and was immediately surrounded by several house elves.
"A what?"
"Yeah. I'm not very happy about it, but it's Parvati.", answered Ron.
"I think we should get some food into you," Longbottom said.
"Oh." He repeated, "Should we go back inside?"
"What the bloody hell are you doing here?" He asked shocked.
And Malfoy was punctual. At exactly half past eleven he stood in front of Harry and the cauldron of not-yet-finished potion. Harry smiled.
"No problem." Ron said nodding.
"No! Hermione, no! It's not Ginny. Never again!", Harry answered loudly and turned to Ron.
Harry smiled gratefully and patted Ron on the shoulder. They joined Hermione and Malfoy on the terrace and then started to eat. It was a really nice day - the weather wasn't too warm and there was a soft breeze of wind. Every now and then, Harry glanced over at Malfoy, who stuck his fork into his food and took only a tiny bite just like he would vomit if he would eat more at a time. Hermione, Ron and Harry were having a conversation while Malfoy was just a silent participant.
Draco rolled his eyes and crossed his arms in front of his chest, holding his cold lemonade in his hand.
Draco nodded wordlessly at Weasel and Granger, then looked at his roommate and boyfriend. If felt too good to say that.
"He drank to bottles of fire whiskey," Neville explained.
Harry opened the drawer of his desk and grabbed a quill and a piece of parchment. He wrote to Malfoy when Hermione and Ron were going to leave, attached the letter to the foot of Bond and sent him off.
"Great.", Dudley answered unimpressed and vanished into the living room.
"You mean...", Draco said and quietened as Potter nodded again.
"Fuck off, Potter. Make fun of someone else," Draco said and kept eating.
"I wanted to teach him how to walk but I think he wants to wait with this until his 'Dada' is here." Hermione said as Harry came down the stairs again and she laughed.
His voice actually made Harry calm down. He breathed in and out slowly and tried to relax, what wasn't really easy with Malfoy being so close to him, in a dark corridor, outside Snape's classroom.
! He produced a cleaning spell and lifted the silencing charms from his bed. Harry groaned annoyed and closed his eyes, hoping there would be no second dream of Draco Malfoy.
"See you tomorrow?"
Potter stopped in the middle of the sentence when Draco stepped into sight. He didn't wear a shirt and small drops of water were still visible on his toned shoulders and chest.
Mr Weasley whipped his wand and cleared the food from the plates, just like at Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Draco went upstairs with Teddy. They heard George shout and cry from the other room and consciously avoided that room. They went straight into Ron's old room and fell into the beds - Ron, Hermione and Ginny on Ron's and Harry with Teddy and Malfoy on Harry's. Draco seemed to wait until the time was right to ask his question.
"No, you know what, stay over there and think about your beautiful red-haired future wife, and how she'll beak bread every morning while tending your six adorable children."
Draco's thoughts were running back and forth and it was exhausting. He wanted to kiss Potter. But his father... But it felt so good. But what if his parents found out? But they wouldn't, no one was there. But what if...
From under his pillow he pulled out the Daily Prophet from a few days ago. "
"Thank you." Hermione finally said.
That was quite a name.
Harry had never liked to mention that it was his birthday - he didn't want people to feel obligated to congratulate him. But Mr. and Mrs. Baker wished him a very happy birthday either way and Harry thanked them gladly. The married couple sat down on their own terrace, out of sight from Harry, Ron and Hermione and so the three of them turned back to their breakfast.
"Come in."
"I'm going out." Harry said while he put on his shoes and hoped neither Hermione nor Ron would ask.
Potter rolled his eyes.
Malfoy took another deep breath and then released his other hand. Harry nodded slightly.
"I saw you.", he said.
With that, he grabbed his broom and was out the door. He smiled to himself. As bad as it was lying to his friends, he was curious to see what Malfoy had had in mind when he suggested that they would meet each other. Soaring through the air, Harry saw Malfoy was already waiting for him and Harry had to smile.
"I was talking about..." Harry pondered.
Harry titled his head. "But is it worth it for you?"
"I was ready to kill her. She took my only family."
Malfoy nodded. "I'll get something."
Harry shook his head. He threw the letter onto Malfoy's bed and ran out, ignoring how much everything hurt.
Draco Malfoy was lost. He was lost in a dark tunnel. But at the end of his tunnel, just like at the end of every other tunnel, there was a light. And Draco's light was known under the name "Harry Potter". Draco liked the name. He liked the boy. Maybe he liked both a bit too much. Blaise once kept count and it seems like Draco used the word "Potter" in average 32 times a day. Even Draco realised that this was a lot more than he should actually say it.
"You were right. I should go. I really, really should." Potter gave him a sad look and tried to get up again.
It was a beautiful day. The singing of birds in the trees filled Harry's ears as the sun shone on his back. Harry refused to think about the whole mess concerning Malfoy and focused on the good things he had in his life - his friends, the good weather and the amazing birthday-breakfast.
"He is not my friend and no I don't want to find him. I don't want to be here at all, I don't even know why I came." Draco said.
"Just so you can steal my cup.", Harry laughed.
Behind it, they stopped.
Hermione laughed and her cheeks went red.
Draco nodded courtly.
The little elf tapsed away and came back with a plate of delicious lunch. Draco smiled thanking and started eating.
"I... I don't know, Harry. I think you could've been-"
rude of Draco to just sit there and listen to them talk while he had done so many things to hurt them. Draco guessed it was kind of nice of them to even let him be part of their breakfast, despite all of his faults.
"If I move in here, I need to look for something to drink myself.", Draco answered without thinking.
"I'm really sorry.", she said again.
Draco nodded unimpressed and lit a cigarette. If he would tell Theo where he'd been after midnight Theo would flip.
"Your father would be very proud of you.
Of course this was the first question they had to ask. Draco rolled his eyes.
They went outside again and sat down in the sun. They put cooling and sun blocking charms on themselves and leaned back. Hermione opened one of the books she'd bought at Flourish and Blotts, she was already halfway through. Ron closed his eyes and enjoyed the sun. Harry put on headphones, listened to music and also closed his eyes.
"Hermione?" He asked in disbelief, almost too silent for her to hear, but just almost.
They stepped outside and closed the door behind them.
"I didn't expect me to do it the first time."
She didn't stay for tea even though Mrs Weasley had offered repeatedly. Angelina was immediately in love with Teddy, just like the rest of the girls. They took turns playing with him and finally passed him to Harry and Draco. Harry held Teddy in his arms when Draco brushed away a stand of Teddy's hair, which turned silver at the tips.
"Draco, don't be paranoid.", Potter answered and laughed.
Theo shrugged. "I guess it's better if I don't violently force my body to cool down, but rise the heat inside me so the heat outside doesn't seem as hot."
Harry furrowed his brow.
"Talking to you," Potter answered and thought this was a really good joke.
"In fact, I do." Hermione answered from the kitchen. She waited until Harry had tied his second shoe and then gave him a list.
"You knew?" Ron asked betrayed. He must have somehow heard it in Hermione's voice. She nodded.
"I haven't done anything!" Potter said, almost whining. That sound made Draco feel all kinds of things. In every single part of his body.
"No, Malfoy, I really want to know." Said Harry more serious now.
"Are you alright?" Harry asked.
"I do.", Draco said, "I do love you." Harry smiled.
Malfoy nodded again and they both sat in silence for a minute and thought of what had happened next.
"I know and I'm sorry," Malfoy said.
"Oh, Potter, you're flattering me.", Draco said jokingly, batting his eyelashes, "Continue."
Harry furrowed his brow. "What are you doing?"
"I assure you, Potter is the same git I got to know over the years. I have never mentioned him to you because the thought of him is so unbearable. He is very annoying and I can't stand being around him. You won't believe McGonnagal put us in the same room, so I can't get him out of my way. He is always there!"
Draco looked at him curiously.
"That Malfoy would like what?" Ron asked curiously.
"Get out!", Draco said annoyed. Potter snickered, kissed Draco on his neck and left the room, closing the door behind him quietly.
Harry smiled and snuggled against Malfoy's chest. Harry heard Malfoy's heart beating, a very comforting sound mixed with the sound of Malfoy's slow breathing.
"DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO SAY ABOUT THIS! IT IS AN OUTRAGE! YOU BESMIRCH OUR NAME WITH THIS SCUM! YOU ARE FRATERNIZING WITH THE ENEMY, MY DEAR SON. I HOPE THIS WILL BE A GOOD LESSON TO YOU! I REALLY HAVE NO WORDS!", Lucius Malfoy's voice bellowed through the room.
"Are you serious?", he asked and searched Draco's eye. But Draco kept his gaze to the floor and nodded.
Seamus was really getting on Harry's nerves, what Draco must have felt, because he stood up in anger.
"Um..." Ron said.
When Draco arrived at the diner he checked his watch. He was fifteen minutes early, just as he had planned it.
"Hm?", he asked and looked at the others, who sat there with blank faces.
"Yeah-" Harry said, "Bond. James Bond."
Instead of answering, Ron gave Harry today's Daily Prophet. One look at the title page and Harry and Draco knew what was so important. The whole page was covered by a picture with Harry and Draco dancing together. The headline, written in bold black, said:
"You look-" He couldn't even describe how he looked.
"Uh, yeah. Yeah. I liked it a lot." Draco let out a pleased laugh.
"He's always alone. I wonder why?" Ron continued. They quickly scanned the Hall.
"I'll go with you."
A feeling of pain filled Draco's chest as he watched the Headmistress and Madame Pomfrey carry Potter to the hospital wing. He didn't think it was a good idea to follow them, given the fact that only two of Potter's friends knew about them and all of them would think
"You sure?" Draco asked and narrowed his eyes.
"Go take a shower." She told both of the boys.
Now Harry felt his own cheeks redden. Did Malfoy just make him a compliment? And did he actually believe that every witch wanted him and that's why Draco wouldn't stand a chance? Harry smiled softly and bent towards Draco.
Harry hat to swallow everything Malfoy had just said.
"Sirius.", Draco read whispering.
"I really don't." he answered and drank from his own cup.
was worried about it.
Harry could see Malfoy's fingers trembling next to his glass and he wondered if he could just take them and hold them. But Harry decided that it would be too weird.
Harry chuckled a bit. "We actually got kicked out because the pub was closing."
A smile ran over Malfoy's lips, what seemed to give Harry confidence.
"Potter, come on.", Draco hissed.
The third task was today. Thanks to Dobby, Harry had found out, how he was going to survive one hour under water. Draco didn't even show up to wish Harry good luck or something. Ron already stood with Neville, Dean and Seamus on the platform, watching the four champions jump into the cold water.
"It's just getting embarrassing." Malfoy said suddenly.
Why didn't he just answer? God, damn it! Harry didn't dare to blink, afraid of missing something.
Draco shrugged. "I guess."
"Oh, Harry.", Hermione shook her head slowly.
", he asked. Harry laughed.
"Everything.", Potter answered and walked into the living room. Draco smiled.
"Of course I do, idiot.", Draco answered smiling.
"Okay. When was your first kiss?", Seamus asked.
"But don't you dare getting sappy on me now." Malfoy said and Harry laughed.
"Draco, dear.", his mother said and hugged him. One last time Draco inhaled her perfume and smiled.
"Really, I have to go. You don't want Ron and Hermione looking for me and finding us like this.", Harry said.
"Could you please tell Draco he should come up here?", Harry asked with a questioning look. Ron sighed.
"It's Malfoy." Harry said shrugging, "He won't come."
"Do we have to become friends now?", he asked.
Draco loves to see this boy being scared of the boy he used to bully in their childhood. They walked back down into the living room and Dudley sat to his parents.
"No!", Harry cut Seamus off, "I don't think that! I trust both, Draco and Hermione and I have no reason not to do so."
"Not good?", Harry asked and bitterly hoped that she would say it
"Malfoy, do you want to help?"
It was just after nine o'clock when Hermione came back home. She smiled when she saw that Harry and Malfoy were still sitting on the couch.
"Malfoy!"
Almost at the end of the movie, not two hours after Harry had sent the letter, Malfoy's owl was back. Hermione and Ron jumped up from the couch and looked curiously at Harry as he let the owl inside and took the letter. He read it himself, his eyes rushing over the words, then looked up at Ron and Hermione, who watched him with wide eyes.
"Don't get used to me calling you like that.", Draco smiled.
"YOU ARE A DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE WHOLE FAMILY! FIRST, A GRYFFINDOR, SECOND WITH A MUDBLOOD MOTHER AND HE IS THE ARCH ENEMY OF YOUR FATHER'S BOSS! I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE YOU, BUT I WANT YOU TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE!"
"I hope you all have the best of magical years here in this school like I did. Hogwarts was my home for six long years, and I couldn't wish for a better place to be. This year is a lot different than the years before, this year there is no dark cloud of threat and fear hanging over this school, this year everyone shall live in unity. To all of you who have the feeling they need to talk, if it is about what happened before or about what you fear will happen next, you can come to me this entire evening and I will be glad to help you."
"So, Teddy is coming after lunch, isn't he?" Angelina asked.
He watched Malfoy closely, hoping he either agreed or someone would come and get Harry so Malfoy wouldn't kill him right there in the store next to the milk.
"So that was when you had your Mojito, right?" Harry asked and Malfoy nodded agreeing "What means you saw me the same time I saw you."
Harry and Hargrid intertwined their arms and walked in the rhythm of the music towards the big oak doors to the Great Hall. They stopped and Harry looked up at Hagrid and bit his lip nervously. His heart was beating fast and loud.
Malfoy looked at him, but instead of answering, he grabbed the collar of Harry's shirt and pressed his pale lips against Harry's. Harry gasped in surprise and closed his eyes. And really, his heart was about to kill him. Malfoy's tongue slid over Harry's upper lip and Harry opened them. Merlin, Malfoy made such good things with his tongue! Harry moaned, as Malfoy's cold fingers found the waistband of Harry's pyjama trousers. Malfoy didn't let go of Harry's lips, while he warmed his hands on the edge of Harry's pyjama bottoms. Harry pulled him closer and lay one hand on the small of Malfoy's back and digged the fingers of his other hand in Malfoy's hair, what made the Slytherin groan. Harry smiled as Malfoy's lips partened with his. He had never felt more alive.
"Shhhht!" Madame Pince, the librarian, hissed from behind a shelf, but Hermione didn't care.
"Alright, alright.", Harry said and he hated them for wanting him to tell them.
"Dream on.", another boy said and muttered a curse under his breath.
"Do you even hear what you are saying?", Narcissa asked angrily.
Harry didn't want to remember the scene where he had rejected Draco's handshake.
He walked to the kitchens and rubbed his eyes tiredly. He sighed once again and sat down.
"I don't," Harry answered and looked at Malfoy.
"About that", Neville said and turned to Luna, "Do you want to join me and my grandmother during the holidays?"
Ron froze.
Draco laughed dangerously.
Harry nodded. He watched Malfoy empty his glass in one sip and slide off his stool.
"You made bets on me and Draco?", Harry asked.
"Good. I got an E and two As," Harry answered proudly
Ron was standing there, his mouth wide open and his books lying in front of him. Harry looked from Ron back to Draco, who looked like he was about to faint.
Granger looked at the others like camping wasn't a bad idea. The others didn't seem as thrilled as she did, nor did Draco and Potter.
They were going to spend the night at the Burrow again since there was enough space outside for them and all of their friends to camp. Harry was really looking forward to it - camping in the wizarding world was way more luxurious than in the Muggle world. He was also very excited for Fred and George's special magical fireworks. And he was excited to be really back with Malfoy, not these half-hearted visits Harry had gotten over the last week. He didn't dare to let the thought of Malfoy being bored of him into his head. Draco's behavior had been very strange lately, but Harry hoped it would be because of something else, not because he wanted to break up.
And pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates, too. Draco laughed at Harry's surprised face.
"So exciting." Hermione said, clapping her hands.
at a random page. Ron and Draco threw each other a quick look, so quick Harry would have missed it if he hadn't paid close attention to their faces. They all sat down at the table and had breakfast. No one really talked, what surprised Harry, so he decided to make them confess.
"He is dead," one finally answered.
Fourteen seconds passed. Harry knew exactly that it was fourteen seconds, because he could hear the clock ticking. Fourteen seconds passed until Malfoy sighed. Harry looked over at him. Another eight seconds passed until Malfoy said something. "How many seconds have to pass until you come over here?"
"What-"
Potter thrashed and squirmed and panted against Draco's lips, every twitch of his body renewing Draco's pleasure. It became too much, both the heat and the pressure against Draco's sensitive cock, but then Potter convulsed and Draco hurriedly extracted his hand from underneath the covers to press it to the back of Potter's neck and trap his mouth with a kiss, intending to swallow any sounds Potter might make.
Romilda laughed. "Are you serious? They- they aren't bothering you?"
The first few times Theo had said it have already annoyed Draco, but now hearing Pansy's voice was unbearable. She was knocking at his door, which he'd locked carefully when he'd gotten home the day before and Draco hadn't seen the outside of his room since then.
"Hey, everyone."
of the things. We would sit here for days."
In seconds, there was a circle of students around Draco and Potter, staring and whispering.
nice. And then we went into the Shack. I wanted him to talk to me without being afraid anyone could overhear him," Harry explained.
"Mhmm.", she muttered and felt his hand.
"Shht. Shut up.", Draco said gently.
"What?", he asked surprised.
He and Professor McGonnagal were talking about the upcoming meeting and what Harry was supposed to say and not to say. They had rehearsed this for a few times already, but Harry's professor thought it was very important to go through it again.
"Don't you talk about your father right now," Potter broke him off.
"Father. Drop it.", Draco said.
"A phone." Potter repeated, "It's a Muggle device to call people. Hermione just called me. She is saying something into her phone and seconds later it comes out of the speaker of my phone. Same thing the other way around when I speak."
"Now that I know you're ticklish, you'll never be safe again.", Harry smirked.
"What are you talking about?", he asked confused.
"I think it was really polite of you not to say anything." She said, "A real gentleman."
Harry shrugged. "I guess, I don't know. I mean if Nott doesn't want to, I have to step in."
"Okay, I remember that you were at the bar." He said.
"Um- I... Do you want to go to the ball with me?", Harry asked, taking a breath between every single word.
"What? Oh, no. I didn't.", Harry answered and drank something. Hermione looked at Ron.
"It was a Mojito and I was looking for Pansy, but thanks for the compliment." Malfoy told Harry.
Everyone else mocked Ron as well until he apologized and joined in with the laughter.
"What are you going to do today?" Potter suddenly asked and Draco looked up from his magazine.
Draco looked at him briefly, but then he felt so ashamed of what he'd just done that he had to look away.
him. Just don't be rude.", said Harry, more calmly than before.
He couldn't stop staring up at Potter, eyes raking over his features hungrily, feasting on the jet-black hair that fell over his sweaty forehead, the green eyes darkened by dilated pupils, and lips parted and wet from Draco's kisses. Potter's expression was, for once, difficult to read. He looked partly smug, and partly amazed, as though his eyes saw something in Draco's that could cause awe.
"Wait, it wasn't, was it?", he asked shocked.
"Hermione asked me if I would join her to go to the library and then get some fresh air. Even when I told her I'm going to be with you, she insisted on me coming and said, I could bring you as well.", Harry told Draco.
Draco shushed him desperately and Potter stilled, his wide green eyes staring at Draco in disbelief. Draco grabbed his wand from his bedside table and cast a few charms at the door. Terrified, he pulled his legs from underneath Potter and freed Potter's mouth. Draco stood up to check if the door was closed. Potter sighed happily.
"You alright, Potter?" Malfoy asked
"No, actually I came to you first. I don't want to talk to Ron or Hermione about this until I'm completely sure about everything. And I know that I can trust you with things like that and that you can be very helpful."
Harry furrowed his brow.
"On my arse?" Draco asked weakly. Potter shrugged again.
"Draco Malfoy!" The first sentence was. This was already a
"Lucius, please!", Harry heard Mrs Malfoy say.
"Are you okay?", he asked.
"Malfoy!" Draco heard someone say and someone pulled away his blanket.
Draco spun Harry around, so he lay on top of him, and did the same biting and sucking at Harry's collarbone.
The blonde bartender was gone for about half an hour after they arrived, and so was Blaise. Draco looked around and tried to find Pansy, but there were too many people, it was too dark and he couldn't shout because no one would hear him over the loud music that was hurting his ears. Theo had checked up on Draco once and had asked why he didn't want to take that girl.
Before Draco had gone home, he had taken a fly around town, but his head had been too full to think about anything but the clouds and the light breeze rushing through his hair. It had been nice to fly around again, but as everything else, it had to come to an end when Draco realized he should go home. Besides, he'd felt that the barely eaten breakfast hadn't been enough to still his hunger. Which was why Draco's stomach growled loudly when he stuck his head under the water stream.
"Wow, that's great," Potter said and somehow it made Draco happy to hear that.
In his dormitory, Harry grabbed a towel, the Marauders map, his egg, wand and invisibility cloak for the emergency. He left Hermione with Ron in the common room and set off for the fifth floor.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Come on, tell me."
And in the worst case Milicent would be there too and then Pansy would tell her why she was squealing and Milicent would squeal too and
"Mom was freaking out during the whole summer because she couldn't find a single jumper from when we were kids. So she knitted one more and it has got a "T" on it." Ron told Harry and Harry smiled.
"I did.", he answered, "And Hermione, you said everything that makes me happy is good, so why can't you just be happy for me? Only because you hate Draco it doesn't mean that I need to hate him too, alright? I mean, I always felt something for him, but it was not normal for me and I felt like I needed to prove the opposite, so I bullied him."
"We're together.", Potter said shortly.
"He really is scrawny," Ron said, "Also, if he wants to fight Harry, he would have to fight us as well."
Harry smiled brightly. "Sounds like a plan."
"Whoa.", Harry said, and Draco's hand froze.
"I'll go and say goodnight to mother." He said and got up.
Draco's eyes got wet again. He held his head under the stream of water and took a deep breath. He relaxed his body and leaned against the cold stone wall.
"Yes.", he answered shortly, but again, he lied.
"Are you nervous?", asked Harry after a while and Draco nodded.
"A corridor.", Harry answered shortly.
"Should I write a letter to my godfather, is that what you want?", Harry asked.
Harry didn't move until the door opened, then he jumped up.
"I can't believe it's new year's eve already."
"I just haven't- I don't know-"
"I believe you do know." Potter glanced at Draco, who was so sick and tired of Potter's shit. "You can tell me," Potter said.
Harry nodded. He didn't want to be impolite, so he smiled as he gave her the money. And when he left the store he turned around again and waved her goodbye.
"You should do that more often, now your outfit looks neat."
Hermione hugged Harry and whispered in his ear:
"Malfoy?" Ron asked in disbelief, "What did he want?"
"Okay, good. Thanks, by the way." Nott said and actually smiled.
Then the bell rang once again. Harry looked at the clock and figured this had to be Molly. He opened the door and indeed found Molly with Teddy in her arms. She hugged Harry and when she did, over his shoulder she saw Malfoy standing at the end of the hallway.
But Harry insisted, so Malfoy gave in and accepted a pair of Harry's very own socks. Harry knew Malfoy could have just used a drying spell, but it seemed as though Malfoy didn't have such a problem with having to wear Harry's socks. And he had to admit, Malfoy looked really cute in Harry's red woollen socks that were a little too big for him. They sat on the couch in the living room as the sun slowly set. Harry turned on the lights and suggested they could watch a movie, but Malfoy didn't like the idea.
Harry laughed. "Thanks Neville," he said and smiled gratefully.
"But still, Ron shouldn't have acted like this." Harry said shrugging.
"It's not logic! Not at all! Why the fuck did you forbid him to go to Hogwarts? You would've been rid of him for a
"What? Can't you meet in the common room? Or is she from Slytherin?", Ron laughed.
"What are you doing?" Harry asked.
"Theo, hurry! We're already late!"
Understanding, Ron nodded and quickly changed the subject. "Want to see what Hermione and Ginny are doing?"
"Andromeda!" Harry's eyes rushed from her face to Draco, Teddy on his hip, to Ron and Hermione and back to Andromeda. "What- What are you doing here? Did we arrange something?"
"Potter, I think we need to go if we want to get to the more important stuff, if you know what I mean.", Draco said after a while and wiggled his eyebrows. Potter laughed and blushed hardly.
? No, it wasn't. Of course Draco wasn't jealous. He didn't...
Malfoy took Harry's hand and rocked on his heel to the rhythm of the song. Harry watched him with a smile. This beautiful man, his pale skin and hair shining in the winter sun, snow falling down on his face. Malfoy's eyes were still closed and his cheeks and nose were flushed by the cold. He licked his pale lips when a snowflake landed there. Harry could watch him all day.
"Harry Potter's godson and son of the late Remus Lupin will attend Hogwarts in the fall. Will he step into his father's and godfather's footsteps and be snorted into house Gryffindor or will he come after his mother, Nymphadora Tonks, and go to Hufflepuff. Or maybe even Slytherin like his step-godfather Draco Malfoy?"
They greeted Hagrid, who looked much better than he did when the holidays had started and when he came to help rebuilding their school. Hagrid left with the first years and Harry, Ron and Hermione went with the others.
Harry nodded. "I know. Me too." He whipped out his wand and covered Draco with the blanket, "Now sleep."
"Then tell me who you're going out of the way."
"Ron, you can't ask him that!", snapped Hermione, but Harry waved.
"Where are you going?" Draco heard Theo asking from the living room.
"My- What my problem is? I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT MY PROBLEM IS!", Mr Malfoy shouted and stood up, trembling with his whole body.
"Pansy.", he shortly answered and lay an arm over his letter, so Harry couldn't read it. Harry nodded and say dosn on his bed.
"Oh," Hermione said disappointed, "Okay."
Draco sighed, but let himself be convinced and sat down. The other Gryffindors stared at him with confused looks.
"I'm afraid Arthur will run a little late", She informed Harry when he asked where Mr Weasley was, "There's still a lot to do at the ministry."
"Having doubts already?" She joked.
"No. Listen, I can't tell you, okay? I promised Draco I won't tell anyone."
"I have a question.", Draco said with a dark look.
Theo snorted. "No, but even though you might be able to hide it from everyone else, you forget that I know you pretty well and you can't hide it from me."
"What was it? A cupboard or what?", Draco joked and laughed.
Harry did as he was told and Narcissa sat down on the other one. She held the album close to them and opened the first page.
"I mean, "Cutest man on earth"? As if I don't know. And as if my son isn't the cutest boy on earth, I mean he has my genes.", Draco said and shrugged.
"I come along on my own, thanks.", Draco answered annoyed. He lifted his shirt a bit to see where the curse had hit him.
"How- how do you know?" Harry asked shocked.
"Thank you!" He said and looked inside. There were two letters, not in envelopes.
That was it. The time had come where Draco was afraid of what people thought of him. He was even more afraid of what they would think if they knew what had happened two weeks ago in his room in the dark. Draco sighed and sat back down on the armchair and put his homework on his lap but had no intention to actually do it. He was lazy today. All he wanted to do was to sit and sigh. Draco was afraid to tell Potter how he felt because first, he didn't know what exactly he felt and second, he knew Potter didn't feel anything at all. Draco sighed again. He tilted his head back, closed his eyes and sighed.
"What do you want?", Draco asked unfriendly and the man took a step back. Harry hurried over.
Letters from his mother found their way in the drawer next to his bed and he lay his talisman under his pillow. Draco pushed the suitcase under his bed, sat down and opened a magazine. Over the rim of the page, he watched Potter unpacking and arranging things on his side of the room. The lot of colourful clothes made it into the closet, a pair of glasses for emergencies landed in the drawer, he put up his books on his own shelf and to Draco's utter surprise, Potter took out a box himself. Draco didn't want to ask, he already knew the answer, but he wanted to look. He watched the box curiously and didn't take his eyes off it.
"Well how could I if she never told me, huh? See I go here with her because I wanted to get into her pants okay, but for weeks she won't let me and now I know why. This little slut never told me about her stupid red-headed boyfriend so how the hell am I supposed to know, can you tell me that?" Flynn said.
"Merlin, if you want to see my dick hanging around just tell me, you homo," Draco said annoyed and pretended to loosen his towel.
"Alright.", Harry said and still laughed.
"I swear to Merlin, if you should poison me, I will haunt you in your dreams.", Malfoy's voice spoke in Harry's head.
Malfoy led Harry into a dimly lit cloakroom with a few red lamps. Harry had barely closed the door before Draco had pulled out his wand of the walking stick, put a silencing charm on the door and pinned Harry against the wall. Harry gasped and melted into the kiss. Malfoy was so fierce and intense. He bit Harry's lower lip, what made him moan. Before Harry knew what was happening, Malfoy sank to his knees and pulled of Harry's newly-bought trousers in one motion. Harry gasped and moaned and banged his head against the door. He got week in his knees and felt like the room was spinning.
Draco laughed and pulled down his trouser. Potter knelt down before him. Glancing at Draco for permission, he slowly and carefully pulled the fabric of his pants away from his skin and down his thighs.
They went upstairs where an old damaged bed and an old couch stood. Potter sat down on the couch. Draco sat down next to him.
Pansy sat on her armchair and held her hand in front of her mouth so she won't explode with laughter.
"Where do you think he is?", Ron asked.
No longer hindered by Potter's body, Draco's palms found Potter's buttocks, pulling, pressing, and helping him slide against Draco.
Longbottom entered the common room. "Harry sent me to give you this. It just arrived," he said.
Draco just glared at him.
"Yeah, leave him alone. He's deprived enough now that he and his
Malfoy's face went blank. Harry tried to figure out if Malfoy was considering it, but years and years of training didn't allow him to see
Harry smiled and sneaked away from the door. The kitchen was filled with chattering and squealing girls, talking all over each other. Harry put a finger in each of his ears and walked outside again. No one was there. The tents were empty, no one was visible in the darkness. Harry furrowed his brow. When he went back inside to ask the girls in the kitchen, he stopped. The chatter had disappeared, the kitchen was empty. Harry looked around and hurried upstairs. Without knocking, he stormed into the room Draco and Teddy have been in just a minute ago but it, too, was empty. Panic filled Harry up as he ran downstairs. He checked the clock in the living room. Ten minutes until midnight. This was like a nightmare. Where was everyone?
"Hey!"
"I'm going to shower now.", Harry told him,
"Yeah mate, is he still that unbearable?" Ron kept asking.
Harry sighed. It was really nice of her to say this. Ron didn't say anything, and even though Harry knew he didn't have anything nice to say about this, he still asked for his opinion.
Malfoy sighed. "Alright."
"Yeah, I know. I just fell asleep, remember?" Harry tried to joke to avoid thinking about what could be going on inside Malfoy's head.
"I just thought I'd be important enough for you to tell me who you're in love with, but it's alright.", she said and stormed away.
"Draco, I need to go.", Harry said, but still had no intention of doing so.
He obliged and hurried out of the room. Draco looked at Harry.
"You're not serious, are you?" Draco asked, still thinking this whole thing is ridiculous.
Potter didn't answer, what made Draco look up at him. Potter's green eyes glistened behind his glasses and he was smiling, but not like he ridiculed Draco. It was an understanding and comforting smile, one that made Draco feel safe and not ridiculous at all. Now he knew what Potter had meant when he had said that Draco didn't have to prove anything to him.
"Hmm?", Potter answered sleepy.
"Exactly. And besides, I don't think you will be the only one returning for their last year, what is really admirable by the way." Harry said nodding.
Harry laughed, but he figured Ron had a point and it made him kind of sad to think that he would never sleep in that bed again, that he would never be able to do his homework on these tables again, he would never go through that portrait hole with his friends again.
"Goodnight.", Harry replied and closed his eyes.
"You wouldn't.", Harry answered with a smirk. Malfoy narrowed his eyes.
wrong with Malfoy these last weeks. He hadn't spoken since he ran out on Harry in the Shrieking Shack. Where did the sudden change of heart come from? They have been so close and all of a sudden he ran out. And then it occured to him. Harry jumped up and took a few steps.
"Something wrong?" He asked.
"So, Harry, tell me. How are you?", she asked.
"Not now, Potter.", Draco answered. Harry lay back down and stared into the darkness.
"Boys, you better leave now.", Draco said with a dangerous voice, that Harry knew from their former years at Hogwarts.
Harry tried to fall asleep again, but his heart was beating so hard that he could hear it every time he closed his eyes. Voldemort's laugh echoed inside Harry's head. He grabbed his hair in frustration and turned to the side, closing his eyes once again and taking a deep breath. Pictures of Voldemort's ugly face and wand pointing at Harry flashed before his eyes and he opened them again. This was the worst he'd felt since Voldemort's death. Harry wondered if it really was Malfoy that brought back all these memories.
"Now, if you may excuse me... You don't want to talk to me anyways so-", Harry grabbed his bag and stood up.
Harry rolled his eyes but then remembered Malfoy couldn't see him. "Shut up, Malfoy." He said and took the pyjama that was laying neatly folded on his bed.
"We actually found three great books," Harry told them.
"No, really." Hermione said, handing Harry another beer, "We shouldn't have invited him. But I just thought maybe he
"But don't be angry because I haven't told you earlier.", Harry said. Draco smiled and kissed him.
Blaise gave everyone their drinks and paid the bartender while flirting with her. She had long blond hair and wore a tight black shirt with a very low neckline. Draco didn't even look twice, but he knew Blaise found interest in her. Pansy rolled her eyes and turned to the other two boys.
Harry laughed, gave Draco one last kiss and left. He danced out of the library, past Madame Pince, who watched him with suspicious eyes. Harry walked down into the Great Hall. Different than Harry had thought, not everyone was in their common room, since a lot of students were chatting in the Great Hall. Harry smiled and walked to Hermione, Seamus, Neville, Dean, Ron and the other Weasleys. They all went outside. The snow was still untouched. Ron bent down to make a small snowball and threw it at Harry. Harry laughed and made one on his own. Quickly, they were into a big snowball fight. Harry stopped and looked at Hermione, who sat on a stone and watched them. He walked over to her.
"Harry, I want you to know that you are the first person Draco ever brought here.", Narcissa said and looked at him.
"What did I tell you?", he asked.
"What? Why not?", he asked, looking between Harry and Draco.
"Shit, Harry. Are you alright?" He asked.
"Are you okay?" He asked.
After the many times he had already bought two hot chocolates for him and his son, Draco of course knew, how much it costed, but he loved to hear Harry say it. Harry grinned.
"What?"
Potter's eyes looked bigger and greener without his glasses, it made Draco want to kiss them, which was an odd thought, so he quickly shoved it aside.
"Just got up to have some pie but I went right back to sleep."
Harry had this feeling in his stomach, he never had before. He smiled and looked into Draco's eyes.
And Draco remembered what Potter had told him about his own childhood. Why did Potter tell Draco? He wouldn't have to, but he did. Why didn't Draco judge him and why did he start to hate those people even though he would have thanked them a year ago. Draco remembered the glistening in Potter's eyes when he had told him about James Bond and how much he loved him. And the jacket. Oh the leather jacket. Draco had looked at himself in the mirror when he came home that night and he remembered how good he felt.
Draco started crying again. He didn't mean to, but hearing his mother saying these words was the most wonderful thing in this world.
"Parkinson, I already don't like you, and for Draco I held myself back, but now I wont. Keep your jokes to yourself and leave Draco alone. His father is bad enough.", Potter said and Draco looked up.
All Draco had to do was renounce the kisses and let go of Potter, but that simply wasn't an option. Draco's grip around Potter's waist intensified at the very thought.
How dare Blaise to invite him to sit at another table and then at the
"I woke up every time you moved just a little bit, so I can wake you up when you have a nightmare. Unfortunately, you shift a lot when you're sleeping even if you're not having a bad dream."
deep down. Harry felt so stupid. He stared at the boy in front of him and in one movement he turned around, opened the door and stormed out of the room. As he entered the common room he didn't know what to do. He couldn't talk to Ron or Hermione because they didn't know anything about it. So Harry started walking. Like he was being pulled by an invisible thread he walked through the trees, past Hagrid's hut and down to the lake where Neville sat and leaned against a tree.
Ron did as he was told and swallowed. "Again?" He repeated.
Draco remained silent and Potter's lips twitched.
see this.
"I'm satisfied with it," Potter answered and smiled.
"I don't.", Harry answered shyly and looked at his folded hands.
"This is Sirius.", Potter said smiling.
heard me say something like this?
"Damn it, Potter!" Malfoy shouted back.
But Harry should have known better.
Harry nodded and the blonde beauty walked into the classroom, taking care of bumping into Ron.
Draco nodded and even though he tried to hide it, Harry knew he was happy about that. Harry smiled and leaned back in his chair. Did Malfoy reall think it was necessary for Harry to come out to him after the kiss they had shared on the rooftop? Harry figured Malfoy was just very unfamiliar with this story of thing - coming from a strict household like this. But it was still good to see that Malfoy was ready to talk, maybe not about everything, but about a lot.
"I'm not going to tell you.", he answered. And with that, the conversation was ended.
He looked over to Draco, who was in a conversation with Blaise Zabini, Crabbe and Goyle. He didn't look like he needed help. Then, Parkinson joined them, looking rather sour at Draco, but he snapped something at her and she fell quiet. Draco noticed Harry's look and smiled at him. He showed him thumbs up and Harry smiled back.
"In my dreams...", Draco whispered and hoped Potter was still awake. And he was.
"Aww, love, that's so cute.", Potter said smiling and hugged Draco.
"We're just looking, thank you." Harry said politely.
am going to read," Harry heard Hermione say and felt really bad for Ron.
It's been three days since Narcissa Malfoy has been released from the hospital. Draco had written Harry, telling him that he would stay with his mother until the end of the week. Harry had been happy to hear from Malfoy and immediately wrote back, saying that he hoped she would feel better soon. Harry, Ron and Hermione spent the day after Harry had gotten the letter in their garden.
"What's your problem now?", Draco asked even louder.
A while later, Malfoy was asleep. Harry smiled gently. He had missed lunchtime, but Harry didn't want to leave Malfoy asleep all alone and not be there when he woke up. So Harry stayed upstairs, happy to have someone to stay upstairs for. He realized that neither Hermione nor anyone else had knocked or come in or disturbed the two boys in any way. Harry didn't know why, but he was glad. He thought that maybe they were expecting Harry and Malfoy to fight. Whatever the reason was, Harry really enjoyed having silence and Malfoy next to him.
"Lucius! Stop asking!", Mrs Malfoy said.
In the evening, Draco didn't stop smiling at Harry. He had mocked Harry several times because he had been Harry's treasure.
After a while of asking and annoying Draco and guessing what could be wrong, he finally told them. They were eating dinner when Draco summoned the letter from his room.
Draco stood up and fixed his wand at the wall. He could feel Potter's warm breath in his neck and a shiver went down his spine. Draco smiled and closed his eyes.
Malfoy nodded. He looked through the menu and decided fast enough to answer to the waitress that was just coming over. Harry ordered a Coke and Malfoy ordered a lemonade and a steak with salad.
"I had to do it." He said, but Harry just laughed. "Don't laugh", Malfoy demanded, "It's horrible."
But seeing Potter - that was something else. Draco had been so shocked when he had seen Potter standing in Flourish and Blotts like he didn't belong anywhere else. Draco still couldn't believe he hid from Potter behind that stupid book stand. He should have gone up to him, or at least not run away. Maybe he would get another opportunity to show Potter he was not a coward and he wouldn't be treated like one. Draco might owe Potter his life, but Draco knew the idiot was too modest to think so too.
"I'm going to look around as well."
Then Ron turned around and came closer to Harry. "Get well, mate," he said, "I'll come and see you when you're allowed to get out of this horrible bed."
in front of Potter's bed, I doubt you can achieve the same thing," Pomfrey interfered.
Draco sat there and watched his friend stupidly. "What's so funny?" He asked.
Draco grinned at Harry, who shook his head laughing.
"But I'll see you later, Harry.", she said and kissed Ron on the cheek.
Harry nodded and she left the two boys alone.
"Hm... Maybe you should tell him again?" Longbottom suggested.
Harry looked up, grinning. Hermione smiled happily and even Ron had a smile on his lips.
"What does he want here?", Finnegan asked briskly.
Harry felt fingers tracing over his jaw and a wet tongue touched his lips. Harry opened them and the tongue slipped inside. The fingers vanished from his face and turned up again, but under his shirt and traced up and down his spine, what gave Harry goosebumps. The kiss intensified and Harry didn't concentrate on the dream anymore.
are dropping me off.
Draco was standing with his face to the wall and hummed Elvis Presley's song
cute. He was Potter. Like the skinny and stupid and annoying and cute Potter. Draco rolled his eyes.
. He liked looking at him. He liked touching him- that doesn't mean anything either. He liked his smell. And the smell of his bed, even if it was not Draco's smell. He liked the way Draco walked when he was happy about something. He liked the way Draco grinned when Harry did something stupid. He liked Draco's constant bitching about literally everything, even if it's annoying, but Harry knew he couldn't live without it.
He was obviously fed up with Draco's crap, and so was Draco himself. He was a Slytherin for Heaven's sake!
Again, Cedric leaned in and whispered into Harry's ear:
"Everything seems so much more silent out here." Malfoy said and Harry laughed.
"I hate you for this."
Harry laughed and they walked forwards, the chattering crowd letting them through. No one really realised that Harry and Draco were walking together, everyone was deep in conversation or concentrated on their own outfit. McGonnagal told the four champions to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside. Hermione hasn't spotted Harry yet. She was blushing and talking to Krum. Fleur and Roger Davies, who was her partner, stationed themselves nearest the doors. Cedric and Cho were close to Harry, too. Harry looked away from them, so he wouldn't have to talk to them.
As every year, Mrs Weasley had knitted everyone a sweater, only this year there were several more. Fleur and Angelina got one and even Draco got a dark green one with a silver D. Harry grinned when Draco tried so hard to smile and look happy - he looked almost like Ron every year.
Harry shrugged again. "Dunno."
"Hey, everyone. Harry found a girl for the ball!", he said loudly and the others clapped.
"Handsome, I don't know." Harry said confused. What did Hermione expect him to say?
Draco rolled his eyes, what turned Potter's attention to him. Potter looked him into the eyes and it felt like he was gazing into Draco's soul. And Draco immediately got the feeling he wanted to tell Potter
"I thought she cared about him." Harry wondered.
"I'm sorry, Hermione... Ron. But I really have to go now. I'm sorry."
"True, true.", Hermione agreed smiling.
Shaking the thought away, Harry hoped he could drift off into sleep and forget about everything. And maybe - if the opportunity presented itself - he might have a real conversation with Draco Malfoy.
"Is that so?", Ron asked sceptical.
"No, I really don't think I should eat now?" Draco said and rubbed his stomach.
"Yeah. He told us he wanted to 'get in her pants'." Neville made air quotes, "But she wouldn't let him."
Harry shrugged and bit in his croissant. "Not very hungry."
Silence again.
Harry walked towards Hermione, who held the book in her hands and stared at it. Harry just saw a normal book. Okay, maybe the book was newer than the others in this library, but what was Hermione so freaking out about? Harry shot a helpful look at Ron, who came over as well and inspected it. He looked at Harry and shrugged.
"Who are you writing to?", he asked and peeked over Draco's shoulder.
"Hey," Draco replied and gave him a shy smile.
"Yes. I forgot my book in the classroom, I'm going to look for it and then I'll catch up with you, Harry.", he said and hushed back to the room they just came from.
"Malfoy!" Potter winced. Draco licked his lips.
"How couldn't you, I mean, look at me.", Draco added and there followed another round of snickers.
"Never say that again!", he added and kissed Harry again.
Malfoy has opened a chat with Hermione, where about 20 messages from Harry popped up. He scrolled up to the first message he had sent Hermione yesterday.
"What are you doing today?", Draco asked Harry, who came out of the bathroom, so Draco could use it.
Harry shook his head.
He nodded.
Malfoy shook his head. "Nothing is wrong."
"No reason," Harry shrugged.
"Why so bitchy, Potter?" He asked and laughed.
"Yeah, well it's not that hard to believe since you tried to kill me for the last seven years," Harry said jokingly, but Malfoy didn't think this was funny at all.
and especially not Harry sodding Potter.
"Nothing, I just don't like you, that's all."
, but tripping and stumbling and most likely falling in the near future.
"So, how is your year going so far?" She asked. Harry got the feeling that she knew. It was like with Dumbledore - he had always used to give Harry the feeling that he had known everything. Harry smiled.
"Good morning." Harry said.
Harry nodded slowly and hoped they didn't do anything stupid.
"I have a question to you, Potter.", he said threatingly. Harry nodded.
"Draco?", Potter asked.
"Makes sense.", he said. Harry looked at him and Hermione clapped in her hands.
Harry wished he could kiss Malfoy right now, but Harry didn't want to throw salt in the wound Malfoy had just opened for him. First, Harry had to be sure Malfoy wanted it. It didn't take long for Harry to figure it out because Malfoy slowly leaned forward and closed his lips around Harry's.
"Or McGonnagal.", answered Harry and shrugged.
"This was a letter Narcissa had found in a drawer in her room. Lucius left it for her." Potter explained.
Harry sighed. He told her about rooming with Draco and how it went. He didn't tell her the private things, but all in all she knew a lot after their talk.
Harry sighed and gave up for now.
Professor Sprout came walking towards them, thought the crowd of students and opened the door.
Harry looked away from the window and back at the boy sitting opposite of him. Malfoy had laid down his fork and knife and put his hands in his lap.
"I think you look just like Malfoy." Ron said.
They came around the curtain and Hermione immediately threw herself around Harry's neck. Ron put the jello on the table next to Harry's bed and smiled. "Good to have you back, mate," he said.
"Alright, fine. I'll forget it. But don't let her talk shit about me."
Harry smiled wordlessly. He knew Hermione wanted to cheer him up, but it really wasn't necessary. Of course, Malfoy needed to take care of his mother and of course he couldn't ask her to live with him at Nott's place so, of course, Draco should stay at Malfoy Manor. And Harry was perfectly fine with him being back at there only with his mother for a whole week. Malfoy surely wouldn't get any silly ideas, would he? Harry shook his head.
"Your task is to retrieve your own friend... leave the others..."
Draco pulled out Potter's ugly Gryffindor scarf and smelled at it. If he would have seen someone behave like this, he would have punched them in the face as hard as he could. But he couldn't resist the scent of the scarf - it smelled like Potter, like happiness, like home. Draco smiled to himself and put the scarf back under his pillow. He knew it was Theo's birthday today and he knew he should probably get up and help, but his limbs felt heavy and he couldn't get them to move. Draco sighed. Fucking injuries.
write that? This doesn't make any sense,
"Yes, of course it is, but... I dont know.", Ron answered. Harry rolled his eyes annoyed.
Draco sneered after her, opened his book annoyed and started reading. He ignored Potter's two abnormally idiotic friends looking at him as Potter grabbed Draco's hand under the table.
"I hate it to have you as my roommate!" Potter shouted.
Ron looked up interested.
"I won't accept a 'no' as an answer." She said.
Ron shrugged.
"But-"
Now there was no Potter who complained about everything Draco did.
"If you try it one more time."
They lay there on the couch. Draco was being used as a pillow by his boyfriend, who read the Daily Prophet.
"Ron's right, Harry," Hermione said and when Harry looked at her, he saw that she looked ruefully and was on the verge of tears, "Back at Hogwarts that was normal behavior and it was bad enough, but it's different now. You were almost friends."
"Good evening." Harry started, "It's nice to be back here."
He cried out of sadness that Draco was angry with him.
"Lilly, did you hear that?" James said and Harry's heart took a leap- his father understood him. "He just said Mom and Dad," James finished the sentence.
Days had passed, but Draco hadn't heard any news about Potter. Many people whispered around him when he came closer, but he was used to that and nothing they whispered was true. Draco hadn't seen Matt since the accident and he thought it was better this way. Apart from classes, Draco stayed in his room all day. He barely ate and barely slept, he couldn't find motivation to do his hair or shave. When the weekend came around, Draco found himself sleeping until ten or even eleven o'clock. He had missed breakfast many times because he had slept in.
"Where do you think you are going?", Vernon asked sharply and stood up.
"Uh, sure. Thanks." Malfoy said smiling.
Harry realized he and Malfoy had never talked about any of this, they never even closely approached the topic of the last two years since Dumbledore's death. Has the time finally come when they would open up? When Draco would open up?
So Theo had left half an hour after Draco had and hasn't even noticed Draco hadn't been there anymore.
"Oh and you aren't? Mr I-Wasn't-Staring-At-That-Asian-Lady." Seamus mocked him.
Water was being boiled, filled in cups and Ron sat back down. Harry figured they were eating pie and drinking tea. But-
"Yeah, I know. Sorry," Harry said.
"Have you found someone to go to the ball with?", Hermione asked Harry and sunk into the soft leather of the sofa. Harry sat down next to her and Ron on the other side of Harry.
"What?", he asked.
"Potter, you're emerassing.", Draco complained, rolling his eyes.
"Yes, please.", Draco answered.
Hermione turned to Ron and Harry.
"Are you looking forward to this evening?" Ron asked.
They moved against each other in the dark corner of the deserted corridor, while everyone else was in class.
"Yes, I need to do an essay anyways.", Hermione said and stood up.
Before Harry could end this thought, the bathroom door opened and Malfoy stepped out.
Draco laughed, then coughed. "No, not at Potter's."
Neville stood up and put his hands on his head.
"Oh? Was the flight alright?"
"So.", Madame Pomfrey said and stemmed her hands in her hips.
He didn't even look at the waitress's boobs just once. Not even a tiny glance. He just looked at Harry as if she wasn't even there. She must have noticed that, because her smile vanished and she glared at Harry as if he was the reason Malfoy wasn't interested in her breasts. But what if Harry was? At this thought Harry's cheeks started to burn and his hands started sweating. All this time Malfoy had hated him but what if this time now ended? What if Harry and Malfoy really had a chance of getting along? What if this was really good? Heavens know that Harry wished for something really good.
know how I feel!" Malfoy said suddenly very loudly.
Draco woke up because his back started to ache. It took him a second to realize where he was. The hospital wing was dark and cold, only the sleeping Potter next to him was warming Draco's body. The moon shone bright outside and illuminated the room a bit. Draco's arm had fallen asleep a long time ago, it felt heavy and ticklish, but Draco didn't dare to move it because he didn't want Potter to wake up. Draco shivered and turned his head to look at Potter. He was very cute when he was asleep. Draco smiled.
Suddenly the shower fell silent and the singing turned into humming. Malfoy was coming out of the shower! Harry moved as quietly as possible to his bed and lay down.
"What do you want?" Harry asked.
His silk pyjama felt cold in the light breeze of the corridors at Hogwarts. Draco hoped that Peeves wouldn't cross his way, because that would be his end.
Harry looked over to Malfoy's bed, but the room was too dark, so Harry couldn't see anything.
"Not long."
Draco rolled his eyes. The two of them were so... Draco doesn't even have a word for it. They just make him sick. Weasel and Granger. Professor Sprout clapped in her hands and smiled to the class.
"What are you doing?", Harry asked.
"I wanted- God, it sounds so stupid, but I was wondering why-", Harry swallowed, "Why you kissed so good. I mean, you must have practised..."
"Now sleep, Malfoy."
"Potter, you don't want to be seen with this scum.", the brown haired girl said and the others laughed mean.
"Harry!", Hermione cried happily as she sighted him. Harry smiled a fake smile.
"Yeah, well obviously not good enough."
It started to rain and Draco laughed hysterically. "Thanks!" He shouted angrily at the clouds and cursed under his breath. And immediately, Draco again hated it to be here.
Hermione hugged Harry tightly as if she was going to leave for a deadly ride - which of course she wasn't.
"Don't worry about it." Harry said even though
Malfoy rolled his eyes again and stepped on the cigarette butt. He wanted to take off the jacket again, but Harry stopped him.
"Who is it from?"
Harry nodded slowly. "I understand."
"Have you noticed Malfoy?" Ron said. Everyone turned their heads to look at the pale boy sitting all alone at the Slytherin table.
"Weasel sleeping is even funnier than I thought.", he said.
They disapparated to Potter's home- Grimmauld place.
"We're going to my parents'.", Draco answered shortly.
"It's August, Potter. How for God's sake can you be cold?" But Malfoy was already on his feet and ready to go back inside.
Harry laughed and blushed. "I'm flattered." He said, "But I think Goyle really improved his figure over the last months."
Hermione put down her fork and looked at Ron with stern eyes, but Ron decided to ignore her and Harry's shocked face. Harry looked at Malfoy and wasn't sure if he should say something.
In the evening, he brought Scorpius to bed and drove off into the Muggle town, stormed into the Starbucks and walked past the people, waiting in the queue, over to the cash desk. Harry looked at him in surprise, but smiled warmly.
It wasn't Molly that had rung the bell. It were Ron and Hermione.
"Thank you so much," Harry said appreciatively.
"Why?", he asked and slid impossibly closer to Harry.
"Thanks."
Potter looked up sharply.
"Draco?", he asked loudly and walked downstairs.
"Hi." Harry said slightly out of breath.
"I can leave. I know you're worried. It's okay.", Potter said quickly and moved as though to get up. Draco's arms tightened around him.
"Don't tell me you don't want to know!"
Harry smiled, got up and walked over to Malfoy's bed. He lay in there all snuggled up and looked ridiculously like a child.
"What do you want?", Lucius asked.
A second later the song "This is how we do it" by Montell Jordan started playing. This song had played on the radio once and Harry, Ron and Hermione had spontaneously come up with a choreography for it. Harry shook his head with a smile as Ron stormed onto the stage.
"He could call himself lucky that we even kept him.", Dudley said.
"It looks nice, Draco. Sit down.", she said smiling and pointed at the two chairs Harry and Draco had been sitting on the previous day.
With the strength he didn't knew he possessed, he pulled Potter onto his bed, overbalancing him and making him sit across Draco's legs, his arse slipping between the wall and Draco's body. His feet dangled from the bed and his slippers slipped down as he struggled to free himself from Draco's hand. Draco pressed Potter's head to the wall, his hand tightening over his mouth.
made sure
Neville looked at him. He looked really sorry for Harry. "Well maybe you should just give it all some time. I mean you're great, really. If I would be gay I would be totally into you," Neville said and Harry snorted, "I mean you are the nicest person I know. And you're really a very good friend. And as a matter of fact, you don't look too bad."
Harry felt a tear escaping his eye and wiped it away with his free hand, not letting go of Malfoy's. McGonagall took a deep breath before she spoke her next sentence.
Harry's cheeks blushed and he looked at his folded hands. Draco smiled and lifted Harry's chin.
"And every night.", Draco added and kissed Harry.
For example that Harry and Draco talked every night. Or that Harry and Draco had sex. Or that Harry teached Draco how to produce a Patronus. Or anything else they had done.
"I know a potion that will solve your problem. If you're not too proud to let me help you, then I'll do it.", Harry suggested.
By the look on Hermione's face, Harry could see that she knew what kind of dream he was talking about. And then realization also dawned on Ron. Harry closed his eyes for a second, trying to gather his thoughts, and then started to tell them about the dream he'd had.
"Hermione, please. Malfoy is hiding something from me. He wouldn't tell me who the letters yesterday were from. I need to know."
Ginny got back together with Dean not long after Ron moved out from the Burrow. Ron had told Harry how many times he'd seen Dean around the house while he and Hermione were packing boxes. It had been a fair few times, but Harry wasn't as concerned as he had thought he would be. After all, he had broken up with Ginny because he thought it would be best for them to have some alone time. If she didn't think so, that was just as fine by Harry.
"He's with you owl." Harry answered plainly.
But Snape wasn't here anymore.
"You said everyone would start arriving at seven, so Potter will come around eight I guess." Draco said.
I have a problem with."
Draco smiled absently. He remembered leaving Dobby small portions of food all around the house so he wouldn't starve. And he remembered how he had bought a shirt for him, but his mother had told him Dobby wasn't allowed to get anything.
But now after the war, after everything that had happened, Harry felt sorry for him. Harry had realized not long after Lucius Malfoy had died, that Draco Malfoy was a coward. And the events at the bookstore proved that once again. Malfoy felt superior to everyone, everyone except his family. Harry remembered when they had been at Malfoy Manor and Draco had been so afraid of his father, so Harry couldn't even imagine his fear of Voldemort. Malfoy must have been really afraid after all he had done.
"Sentimental git." Malfoy said with an eye roll.
, but now he'd rather slit his throat than not sleeping in the same room as Draco Malfoy.
Harry chuckled at that. He didn't know Malfoy was able to make jokes.
"I- I don't want you to see it." Malfoy said.
"So." Malfoy said, pulling put a cigarette.
Harry didn't know which baby woke him up first - the cute little brown-haired one in the crib or the cute blond-haired one in his bed. Either way, Harry woke up and took the crying Teddy out of his crib and his hair turned black again. Draco lay on his stomach in his boxershorts and pullover. Harry smiled when he noticed that Draco watched Harry calming down Teddy and sat down on the bed with him. Draco sat up as well and pulled down the sleeves of his pullover.
"Will you ever tell me what memory it was?", Harry asked.
"Explain," Weasley said.
Feeling light on their feet, Harry and Ron made their way through London's streets, not bothered by the little rain. They stopped by Weasley's Wizards Wheezes on their way home and checked in with George as the rain outside intensified. Harry and Ron ran back to their house and shook their hair like dogs when they came inside.
He stood up, bent down again amd kissed Harry once more. He tried to pull away, but Harry held his head in position with his hands.
"What, can't little Potty speak for himself?" The guy said, "Are you the big strong protector for your little princess?"
"I just need to tell you what I've been thinking." Malfoy said firmly.
tell Ron. It wasn't that Malfoy cared so much that he wanted Ron to know so Hermione didn't get the chance to cheat. Suddenly Harry figured something out. Malfoy had a crush on Hermione! Harry looked around. He couldn't find Malfoy anywhere, he must have eaten before Harry and the others came into the hall.
"No, he hasn't. He's must still be at Hogwarts."
Harry figured Ron was right. For Malfoy to plan something with Harry three weeks ahead showed that he was sure he was around in three weeks. And that was something that made Harry's face ache from smiling.
"So you're pleased?", Harry asked.
"Dudley, this is Draco.", Harry introduced his boyfriend.
to say?" He asked rudely.
good. And he could count on Hermione.
"Stand up, Potter, you idiot. Stand up.", Malfoy said.
"Then you better get going, I have a few more minutes," Harry said smiling.
Malfoy walked around the couch table. "Why are you being an ass right now?"
"Harry is helping us and your father and you will do well to be grateful." Narcissa told him sternly.
"Hey!", Draco snapped.
"Yeah, whatever.", Harry said and waved the conversation away.
Harry grinned. "Me too."
"Alright, Potter. Now you are responsible for me for six weeks.", he said and Harry laughed.
Malfoy sat down on the wall and stared straight ahead. Harry slowly walked over to him and sat down next to him, not thinking about the pouring rain. He didn't know what to say or if he even was supposed to say anything. But after all, Malfoy
Draco took a piece of cotton candy into his mouth and his expression was indescribable. Harry laughed.
"What?", Ginny asked and laughed. Harry rolled his eyes.
"Nonsense."
"Sick motive, man." He said at the sight of Draco's Dark Mark, "Where'd you get it?"
"Whoa!" Ron jumped up.
But Malfoy said, "I think I love you too."
"You're not going to do something, will you?", Ron asked.
"I'm going to eat with you."
Harry nodded. "It did."
"What did he say to you?" Hermione asked curiously.
Draco rolled onto his stomach. He didn't know what he could do now, Hogwarts was so boring without any friends. Pansy was probably very happy with her perfect boyfriend and her perfect job and her perfect freedom. And Blaise- Draco didn't even want to think about Blaise the stupid traitor. Then Draco's boredom gave him an idea. He was going to look through Potter's stuff. There had to be something interesting.
Harry dragged himself into the living room where Ron and Hermione sat and ate their breakfast. Even though Harry had already said that he wasn't hungry, a slice of toast was waiting for him. They were hoping he would at least have a bite. But he didn't. Only looking at the food made Harry's stomach clench. He swallowed thickly and opened the door to the terrace because the smell of sausage and egg was starting to make him feel nauseous.
"I'm not. Look.", Draco said.
Madame Pomfrey nodded slowly.
Hermione looked at Harry. "What? No, of course not."
"I don't know.", Malfoy finally answered.
"You called me Draco.", he said.
Now there was no Potter who banged on the door for one thousand times because Draco needed to hurry up.
That seemed to enlighten Mr Weasley's face. "Right, how is she doing back at Hogwarts?"
"What? Why?" Potter asked annoyed.
Harry shrugged. "He apparently wanted to talk."
"Because I have to sit alone and people will stare at me with their death glares because they hate me and after yesterday, they hate me even more. Or I have to sit with you and your friends and I can't stand them. I can't stand Weasel or Granger or Longbottom the idiot. I can't stand any of them and they can't stand me. Or you and me sit alone and I can't stand that either. I love to eat with you and without you it feels lonely, but if you and me sit at the same table as your friends and you're not allowed to talk to them, I would hurt you and them because they would think that you prefer me- what you do, but...- and I would hate myself even more.", Draco finished, taking a breath.
"Then get away from there.", Malfoy ordered. Harry nodded and walked to his own bed.
"There are no happy memories.", he said.
"I know and I'm sorry for not understanding that. I did spend way too much time here."
"He's the cutest." Hermione said grinning widely, "I'm so jealous."
Malfoy looked up and threw his cigarette to the ground, stepping on it.
"You better be. He's right. Father is bad enough and I don't need you to be like this too, alright? Now go away!", Draco answered and closed the door.
"Some day.", he said and stood up. Potter sighed and climbed into his own bed.
Hermione shoved Ron's shoulder and rolled her eyes. Harry shrugged.
"Good," Ron answered.
Mr Malfoy rolled his eyes.
They walked back to their boyfriend and girlfriend. Draco kissed Potter and Weasley kissed Granger. Potter laughed into Draco's chest and Granger giggled annoyingly.
"Both of them?", Dean asked with a look of joy.
Draco's hand trailed across Harry's hip, and then he tugged at Harry's pyjama trousers.
Narcissa only nodded. She let go and looked at Draco for a few seconds, then looked at his two friends, who have been mostly quiet all day long. Narcissa nodded courtly and they did the same. Pansy stepped into the fireplace first, then Theo, and Draco at last. He looked at his mother sadly before the flames went higher and he vanished.
Harry smiled and pulled Draco's face down. Draco laughed against Harry's lips and grabbed Harry's naked ass beneath his pyjama.
