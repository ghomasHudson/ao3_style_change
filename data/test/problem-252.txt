"There is so much negative energy in that necklace, you shouldn't wear it too long." Draco frowned at the two girls occupying his space, because now he couldn't see what Leighton was pulling.
"I see," Snape said softly. How could he deny Draco after that? "But remember, you are playing a dangerous card." Snape motioned for Draco to sit, and Draco sat upright with his hands in his lap. "The Dark Lord has not yet been completely restored to his body. He is alive, but is missing something dear." Snape paused, hoping that Draco would not ask what.
"If you think you can just—" pain seared her forehead, burning and tearing at her skull. The room spun around, white glowing and darkness mixing in with masked faces. Screams filled her ears, deafening and agonizing; the mad laughter of a killer joined with his victim's dying shrieks. Everything glowed a blood red, she was laughing hysterically, pain struck her skull, her stomach, her organs-like invisible hands were tearing her insides apart. Whose crazed delirium was this? Her eyes burned with anguish and anger seeking out the man whose fault this was. There. He groveled at her feet, but he needed to feel her torment. Crucio wasn't enough. She saw his rat like face, and hate consumed her. "What have you done to me?"
Harmony had been worried about how she was going to access her gold, until Draco explained how the goblins operated. They had an innate sense for who the gold belonged to, even being able to see through magical transformations like polyjuice potions and the like. Which was why the wizarding world trusted them as caretakers of their money.
"Clawed the Raven," Draco said the password and the wall opened up. The common room hadn't changed since the last time she had been there. The lamps still glowed green, and the walls had those skulls ingrained in them.
"But what is it?" Harmony asked and looked at the locket. "It was Tom Riddle's diary, when Voldemort went to this school. It's not the same as the locket." Draco looked at Leighton and saw the man's grave face. Leighton knew what it was.
Draco got to his knees to figure out how to carry Harry Potter. He obviously could not give a piggy back ride, for any drool stain would be an embarrassment. He crossed off the possibility of dragging the boy because then the nurse would suspect him of hurting Potter. He brought one hand to rest on Potter's head and the other on his shoulder to give one last desperate shake to wake him up. "Potter, Potter!" he called halfheartedly. Wonder boy's head rolled to the side and the fruitless effort stressed Draco. He was not used to helping others.
Harmony fiddled with her tea cup, taking another long sip. If anyone deserved to know the truth, it was Hermione. Even if she could only tell her parts of the truth.
After purchasing five bras and under garments of multiple colors, she was then dragged into clothing stores for the fashionable witch. She had a sinking suspicion that McGonagall was actually enjoying herself, which grew ever more prominent with that self-satisfied smile that would not leave her face. By the time both of their arms were overflowing with bags, her stomach growled in protest.
"Really? I'm sure that I can spice it up for you," Draco bit back a laugh from her open mouth, "no need for both of us to be bored, right Harmony?" She closed her mouth.
So far none of the girls could reach the top, and Harmony could feel her arms starting to feel weak. She began to stretch them and loosen up her shoulders. When it was her turn, she stood at the far end with Ginny in the middle and Luna at the other end. Madam Hooch blew her whistle and Harmony gripped the first crevice and lifted up her leg. There were small bumps and holes and Harmony attempted to blank out her mind and just think about lifting herself up. She felt like she was crawling ever so slowly and her arms burned within minutes. This was much harder than quidditch, and Harmony hugged the side of the cliff, resting for a few moments. She heard a gasp from her her right and looked down to see Ginny nearing the ground. Luna was just at her feet and smiled up at her.
Draco watched Snape from across the room in feigned interest, while well aware of the occupant sharing his desk. He had not spoken a word to Harmony for the five days since classes resumed. Draco kept his face impassive whenever the girl glared at him, and he was beginning to believe that her lips would be permanently pressed in a tight line.
"It's alright, Cub," Leighton shouted, "Hook's safe." They then saw a bird passing them. It swooped up and twisted into circles before spreading its wings and joining the stunned faces.
"I think that you mixed up unicorn with wombat," Luna said. They stared at the girl before clenching their mouths and trying not to laugh too loudly.
"Nope, I switched into Magical Fitness." At Harmony's reply, a masticated glob caught into Ron's throat, determined to latch on and avoid falling victim to the organ known as the 'bottomless pit': a process essentially thwarting Ron's talking, snoring, and lastly breathing. Ron turned the exact hue of a grape.
"Thanks Leighton," she said as she went to leave. He saluted her with a wave of his hand and when she got to the door, it swished open for her. She walked along the dark halls in tiptoes, chanting the spell lumos in her mind and watching her wand shroud her arm in fading light, as if a firefly sat on her wand.
No! Harmony shrunk in her seat, hoping that people had been too asleep to hear that she would die a woman. "That's ridiculous!" Harmony bellowed. Trelawny's eyes opened and she blinked a few times, a dazed look passed her face. "You know nothing, absolutely NOTHING!" Harmony shot up from her chair, fists white to the bone.
There was an absence of light. Maniacal laughing thudded against their ears. Hay like grass itched against his knee, and wind blew noiselessly across the long grass. There were other calls, like screeching. "Nobody move," Kingscross commanded in a low voice, "and do not use lumos yet." Draco had been wrong, large canine looking beasts prowled around them in tight circles. They were a cackle of hyenas. As if the meat he held was alight with fire, he dropped it, and kicked it away from him. He clenched his wand, and brought it close to his torso. Draco turned his head, unable to make out the others. The hot breath of panting animals itched at his neck, and suffocated his senses. He felt paralyzed. A hex left his wand, hitting nothing, but the light he made outlined bodies. They were eight feet away from him, and he took careful steps away from their way rotten breaths. A hyena growled to his right and Draco barely saw the creature preparing to snap at his foot. He could not think of a spell. Draco was unable to move his foot quicker than the jaws of a hyena. He could only yell in fear. His eyes closed, and he was falling backwards. He hadn't signed up for this madness. He had been a fool trying to prey on others. But he was caught now, with teeth ready to rip at his leg. The hyena tore at his robes, thick wads of cloth caught in its mouth. Draco held back a cry, as he felt skin tearing as the animal bit into his flesh. He held a shaky wand to the animal; his mind was filled with only unforgivable curses. The hyena cried out in pain, it arched its back, and veered away, spinning in circles. Draco squinted his eyes in surprise. He had not used his magic. There was a new animal, and it was hissing and spitting, claws sunk into the hyena.
"Not that one then." Ginny remarked, tucking it away out of sight. It wasn't that Harmony had never worn a bikini before. Last summer in Brazil, she had a lot of good times in a bikini. But that was different somehow. These were people that she saw every day in school, and what she liked to think of as her real life. "How about this one then?" Ginny asked, holding out a white one that looked a little less scary. Harmony frowned at it, until Ginny remarked, ""it's alright if you don't want to, we can just go back and tell-" Harmony shook her head, took the white bathing suit and stepped into the loo to change.
"I have to get back, and I would appreciate it if you don't say I brought him here." Draco said in a tone that declared a need to protect the cold Malfoy legacy.
"You two better hurry up, you don't want to be late for our next class. I heard that Professor Snape finally lost it."
"You said that you would dress up for me." Distress signals from Harmony's uncomfortable position mingled with signals passed through her brain, searching for a promise she could not have made.
"No, no, cub is great," Harmony said a bit too quickly. She got up from where she sat and became Harry Potter, "but only use cub through owl, during these after school lessons call me Harmony."
"You girls didn't bring bathing suits did you? Well Ginny has a spare here that should fit you Harmony."
"Right. Hell, if only we could have two of you present at the same time. We don't have a time turner."
"Maybe we should play a game where all of us hide, except for one, and that one looks for us!" Ginny exclaimed.
"For the reasons he always desires. I must stop here, Draco, I fear that I have said too much already. I trust that you will not blab this around and most certainly get killed for doing so, right?"
Wait of course; Draco knew the answer so well, if he could somehow learn Potty's weakness, then he could win. He would take Potter to Madame Pomfrey, spy from afar and learn of his afflictions in detail. It was positively brilliant. He had been told when he smiled, on those rare occasions, that he looked angelic. He was smiling at that moment, but the darkness contorted his face into something a bit sinister; a shame really. He stared at the whimpering Potter and wondered if he was dangerously close to playing the hero for once. But Potter would never know.
"Come on guys," Luna hopped on the steps. They walked to Leighton's room and he greeted them, on the floor at his feet, were a few woodland creatures with different wounds. There was a limping fox in a cage, a bird with a trailing wing, a squirrel with burn marks, and a boar with a huge gash by its face.
"Yep." Harmony scratched her short hair and her Harry mask slipped away as she went up to the sink. "Second year, I stabbed a basilisk, and destroyed Tom Riddle's diary."
"You saved me, you know," Harmony replied, "when you gave me this." She pulled out a silver chain from beneath her over-sized muggle shirt, until the dragon pendant was visible. "The dragon had me, but wouldn't finish me off after smelling this." Draco tensed when he wondered what would have happened if she hadn't been wearing it. But still he needed to know more.
"That's a great idea!" Leighton nodded his head in satisfaction. "Any further questions before we begin?"
In the dark he could make out the few pieces of furniture, and he forced himself not to think of any graveyard. Before he could wish that it had been him instead in the dirt, a sudden wave of nausea racked his body. Harry grinned and sighed all too soon as it subsided to a dull pain, concentrating in his lower stomach.
"Ah, watch out for slugs, you should. What about you Harry dear?" Harmony forced her gaze away from the hypnotic ball to rest on the students at other tables who looked to be in various degrees of vegetable like comas.
"Oh no! We'll never graduate at this rate. I'll be stuck with Snape forever! Quick, get back to class!"
"Hey," she said. "You think I'm a child huh, that I can't take care of my self, that I need people to rescue me, and shelter me from the evils of the world! What's WRONG with everyone, I'M NOT A WEAK LITTLE BOY!" She yelled the last part without thinking and huffed for breath while Leighton lifted his eyebrows in surprise.
"Perfect. I'll write back that we'll be there." Ginny replied, grabbing a quill, enjoying the bemused look on Harmony's face. "You'll see." Ginny promised, answering Harmony's unspoken question.
Kreacher stared at the girl in disbelief, but his distraught face did not relax as he bowed his head and shuddered, "as you promise, Master".
"Hey!" Ginny crossed her arms, pretending to act offended. "Though he may be dishy, you are still the priority in my mind." Harmony smiled. "At least you won't have to worry about me falling head over heels for you, Harmony." Ginny laughed softly and crossed her arms.
"Shh," Harmony whispered back, "It's not my fault that he decided to come in and change now. It doesn't matter any way." Ginny whacked Harmony's hand and glared at the changing room.
It was like ice had gripped her throat, restricting her movements, corrosive to her skin. Everything was hopeless, and death would embrace her like it wanted to do nearly 14 years ago. Her eyelids drooped and she wondered if she heard something behind the laughter in her head. She wondered if she imaged the bright light that coursed through the air. She wondered if this was death.
"No." Harmony argued, "it does matter. Clearly you have never seen Draco without a shirt on. He's hot as hell."
"Hey baby, just wanted to check to see if you were alive and in need for some mouth to mouth resuscitation," Dudley leered at her. A small part of Harry died that moment, but luckily she was breathing and had not aspirated on her impending vomit. Ickle Diddykins was putting the moves on her and he so obviously did not know how to perform CPR anyway.
"Of course," Blaise chuckled, and Draco was so glad that none of his Slytherin friends had their own invisibility cloak. "Did you get the pink out of your room yet?"
"When you attain a level of awareness concerning the nature of people and their magic, it is quite simple, you just have to look." Leighton explained, as if it were obvious.
She shoved the cloak into his arms and went to leave the store. He began to laugh a bit and took her arm before she left. "Why are you leaving so soon without a hi?"
"Enough of it Miss Harmony James Potter," Snape continued to sneer. "Though knowing your father he had to add James somewhere within your name. The arrogant prat."
"No," she said, thinking about how she had no answers and too much prying in her life at the moment. She left them and locked the door to her room and went to her luggage bags. She had not needed to open this bag all summer. Piles of unfolded clothes and books were littered inside. She held out a man shirt and embraced one; it had been much too long. McGonagall had not so much said a word against the man cloth as much as she gave concerned looks, which were worse than words.
"That's right, you don't have Granger or Weasley behind you." Which was true, Ron and Hermionone would much rather busy themselves by seeing how long they could humanly snog for, than have conversations which tended to turn awkward with her. "Which is a good thing that you have me." Draco's hands slipped to hers, "I'll come with you to Professor Snape, and I will figure out anything that I can from my father." Harmony lightly held on to Draco by his finger tips. That simple contact made her arms tingle. "But on one condition, Harmony."
"There's so much Draco, for you to lose." Snape looked down at him and sneered. "Would you give up your family? Betray them?"
"Michael, you are right. I do care more about Harry than I do about you." Ginny twisted her arm free, but not before she read the angry and disbelief clear in his face. She knew that she had hurt him, but she needed to know that Harmony was okay.
"Alright, I'll be back." Harmony nodded her head as the girl left. She returned with her own glittering high heels, and Harmony stared at them like they were stilts.
The headmaster Dumbledore smiled when he noticed the green eyes staring back at him. Harry blinked and slowly rubbed his eyes when they widened. He could see perfectly and his glasses were on the counter on top of his cloak. He looked at Dumbledore questionably. "Er. Professor, What's going on?"
Harmony could not look away as a spell hit Sirius's stomach, making him gasp in pain and fall back. Mr. Malfoy walked to Sirius and bent to grab the man's hair.
"I can't," she said, "not now." It was like she had slapped him. She could not tell him that she was scared, of all of the doubts and wicked thoughts that were floating in her head. Scared that if she did love someone, it would all fall apart. "Please, go." She put a hand to her forehead and covered her eyes from his searching ones.
He took a few long strides and held her close. "You don't have to do this. We could escape together." This was why she hadn't wanted to see him. In his arms it was almost impossible to tear herself from him. Draco had one hand trailing through her short hair, tenderly, till he slipped her glasses off, hooking them to the front of her robes. His eyes shown like steel with a glint of something more and irresistible. Yes would have been the easy answer.
"Anyway, I think your room needs some changes." Draco watched in trepidation, as Harmony turned the colors of his room into soft pinks and reds. She made the skull on his wall into a poorly constructed rendition of Snape's face, and scattered his few possessions all over. After she was through with it, it looked like a 12 year old girl had a birthday party in his room. By then he told her that they really needed to leave or else get caught, and salvage the rest of his room. "I think it looks better," she said.
Her footsteps echoed in the dark corridors and the cloak fell from her shoulders as the door to the room materialized, she stuffed the cloak into her bag. She wrenched the door open, and Harmony stepped inside. "Sirius?" she said. She waited for an answer that didn't come. The room was big, but not grand enough to get lost in. Was he asleep? The door creaked behind her.
Blaise watched as the fake Harry hugged Harmony tight, glaring at Draco, over her shoulder. Quite a nice touch. But would the others fall for it? Pansy and Nott look like they want to kill Harry, but Nott had no reaction to the girl. Everyone at the Gryffindor table was watching, as well as half of the Ravenclaws. And look at that. There were a handful of Hufflepuffs eyeballing their hug, this gossip was going to be around the whole school by dinner. Everyone was completely buying- Er what?
"Harmony has stopped eating, she's moved out of the boy's dormitory, probably not even sleeping, and lastly, she's shut herself from everybody. What did you say to her?"
"Give me your hands," he commanded as he put the dough into her palms. His own hands wrapped around hers as he pressed gently, squeezing them together. "You need to apply pressure so that there are no air bubbles," he explained. They were facing each other, with the cauldron between them. He looked into her green eyes before abruptly withdrawing his hands. The dough fell into the pot, and sizzled, making the potion turn an inky indigo blue. luckily the hue was close enough to the drawing in the book. He sighed in relief. She looked at him with curiosity.
"The Dark Lord anguishes, seeking more than your blood. He will steal everything from you. Death is at knife point, waiting to carve out your heart. The Dark Lord anguishes, seeking…seeking…seeking…"
Harry had a faint idea of where he wanted to go as he walked with his wand tip lit. He wanted to see if his weird pain syndrome could be listed in at least one of the books in the library. He knew he could not go to Hermione, for her nagging and fussing would surely make him instantly regret telling her. Harry breathed in the faint smell of old pages as he passed rows and rows of fat books. The cloak fell to the floor in his excitement. He hastily checked over the medical section. He wondered if he perhaps ate one of Fred and George's unfinished candies, but knew such affects would be temporary. No one had either hexed him recently, not even a simple itching spell to annoy him. They all probably thought it best to leave him be since the Triwizard tournament, four days ago, though some of them looked as if they wanted to call him a liar and hex him down for announcing Voldemort's return.
When Hagrid brought the tree into the castle, the students beamed in delight. Already the school had glowing lights and streamers all about, and students chattered amongst themselves on their plans with their family. Snow piled high against the walls and students had massive snowball fights. Harmony sat with Luna and Ginny at a red oak table in the library. There were books piled high and Harmony was rubbing her strained eyes.
"As far as I'm concerned Harry Potter is dead. I came up with a plan. I'm going to move to London and live my life as a muggle and..." Harmony became distracted from recounting her brilliant plan as Draco stepped close. His fingers caressed her cheek as he stared at her red cupid lips.
She watched as a few of the first years cried, and Harmony wondered why she couldn't even muster one tear. If only it would rain, then something would be falling across her face. She crossed her arms, feeling the edge of her dragon necklace under her shirt, which ended a short ways above where the scar ended. Ginny took a step closer, and Harmony reached down and held her hand in her own, and neither of them cared if a student happened to look.
"You're not coming in with me," she asked, "too scared of a bunch of girls now." He gave her a lopsided smirk.
Draco sighed, they never had enough time. "I hear the whistle," he said, "you could still skip." He added hopefully, cocking his head at her.
"My, my. It's only the third day of school and you already are cutting class," said a drawling voice. Her body whipped around, facing Draco Malfoy.
"Fine." Draco's voice lowered, "It is because I do not want to be the Dark Lord's puppet. This is my life, and I am tired of pretending, of following a mad man." Draco brought a hand to where a dark mark would be. "He is unstoppable. I cannot leave, and I cannot go against him." Harmony held his gaze, trying to see the truth in his eyes. He closed them.
"Yes of course Sir." Draco stood, but before he stepped away, he could make out the bags under the man's eyes and just how hollow the man appeared. "Thank you," Draco said and left, realizing that Snape had just risked it all by telling him the truth.
"You entered the Dark Lord's mind without even knowing it." Snape marveled at the girl's ignorance. "That must stop. Has this ever happened before?"
Harmony shuddered, Goosebumps coursed through the skin on her arms. "What?" she gasped, as other students shot from their slumber to look on at Trelawny.
"Watch it, freak," a seventh year pushed her aside, sneering down at her as she apologized. She continued on, through the doors of the Great Hall. Harmony had gotten used to people ignoring and insulting her. She couldn't blame them if the press slandered her. She knew it was fear of Voldemort and not hate for her, which caused students to act the way they did. A yawn escaped her mouth as she joined Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table. They were whispering to themselves. Harmony looked down at her plate of scrambled eggs shaped like a snitch. The two had become closer now that Harmony had been busy late at night, and she felt the gap between them. It seemed like Ron and Hermione had done fine without her. She couldn't help but envy them, because they could be happy together.
"Sorry, but I don't plan to ever fall for you, I am completely uninterested." Harmony said, not looking at him.
The compartment door slid open and Draco Malfoy graced them with his presence. Harry did not know how worse her life could get. "Weasel, Mudblood we got a Perfect meeting at the front of the train and I am gathering everyone. So do hurry up." Harry glanced at Ron wondering if a verbal fight would commence.
"Please, Granger's been yapping since first year, I think I hear her more often than the Professors. Did you send Potter a love letter?" Blaise said as quietly as someone like him could be.
"There's a reason why I started boxing," Dudley uttered rapidly. "I was alone one day and a group of really older kids cornered me because they didn't like my attitude or something. They called me 'fat arse' and took turns beating me up. I wanted to get bigger so that I could punch their cheek bones in."
After seeing his look of confusion, Harmony just twisted out of his grasp and turned away from him, knowing that there was no point trying to hide it. She pulled up the back of her shirt, revealing the damage that was still there. "I wasn't kidding when I said that the dragon almost got me." She explained lightly.
She stumbled back, sore and exhausted, and put a hand through her hair. They probably would expect her to parade in the dead body, to end all of the fighting. But all she felt was numbness. She peeled the elder wand from Voldemort's vice like grip and stuffed it in her pocket, knowing that she had to bring it back to Dumbledore. She moved slowly as she retrieved her firebolt from the tree, and didn't even look at the dead body before taking off, steadying her broom, and soaring over the forest. It didn't take her long till Hogwarts was in view, with the fighting almost over as the remainder of the Death Eaters either littered the grounds, took off, or fought with the conviction that their Lord would never fall. At the sight of the dead bodies her eyes closed, and she knew that war had entered the castle.
As Lucious took one last look at his wife's prone figure, his eye twitched involuntarily. "Should I stay to protect you my Lord?" Lucious asked.
Her eyes opened. Book, she thought. She got up from her bed and cast down the silencing charms. Maybe Voldemort was in the Department of Mysteries for a book. She wasn't so sure about that, but Harmony needed to go to someone who knew the Department of Mysteries, or find a way to get into the Dark Lord's mind. She shuddered at that thought, and wondered why she had thought that in the first place. She could recall what Snape had told her that Voldemort could go into her mind through the connection they shared. But couldn't she go into his mind then? She had made progress with Occlumency, she could divert Snape from her mind when he was invading her most personal memories. She had to find out if she could enter Voldemort's mind, without him knowing. But would Snape even help her with that.
As soon as the train whistled and lurched forward, Draco made his move. He sidestepped the stragglers and their bags without so much as a snide comment. His eyes strayed from glass window, to glass window feeling his excitement heighten, till finally something hitched in his throat as he saw the back of her head. He knew it so well, from all the times he had burned holes into it with his eyes when he was so young and petulant.
"Oh, nothing, anyway, change into the dress first. I'll look away." Harmony changed as Ginny pulled out an assortments of bottles and tubes, until the bed and desk were covered with witch beauty supplies for the magical enhancement of young ladies.
"Good, still following my orders. Has he said anything about Potter?" Harmony took in a breath, and widened her eyes. Snape knew her mind, knew almost all of her secrets.
Though obviously, she hadn't planned things through, she didn't think that everything could turn out so wrong. She had brought no money. No way to contact her friends-not that she could anyway. And then there were the burns.
"Look at the boy who lived now… are those tears I see?" Malfoy whispered in glee. But there was something missing from this triumphant moment. Of course, an audience made everything better, someone at least to share the laugh. Draco felt his face fall as he wondered what to do with the body. He sighed a bit; Potter was just so vulnerable and easy to humiliate, but it would be too easy. He wanted so badly to win and be better, to have Potter boy grovel at his feet. No, Draco had to beat him when Potter was a bit more aware, even if he had to cheat to do it. He still had to get the dark book though, it was a difficult choice, but all great men have to make choices.
"Never counted on that," Draco said, "but free food makes everyone feel better. It's about time for my afternoon tea." The thought of sipping tea was innocuous enough.
Draco looked over at Voldemort and didn't know if his predicament was permanent or not. Even now, some Death Eaters had turned to their master. Without looking at his father, or wondering what he would do if anyone tried to stop him, Draco scooped Harmony up in his arms, holding her gently to him, and unstunned the Hufflepuff students by the wall. Three of them scrambled to their feet, shaking with fear, and Draco gestured them over. He didn't even have time to say his farewell to his mother, as he passed all of the searing eyes and left the room.
She glared at him, wondering why he had to be such a prat all of the time, "Well at least I'm not a little coward, who has to have Mummy and Daddy in order to feel important. And it's a good thing that practically everything can be bought with money, right, enables you to screw people over." He scoffed at her.
"Draco," she said, and he looked into her green eyes. "We can't be together." The words didn't match up in his head. He let her hand go as the rejection hit him.
"That's what a severed soul looks like? What will happen to it?" Harmony asked. Lilly shrugged in reply. Harmony looked into the face of her mother, and placed a tentative hand on her shoulder. She felt solid and warm. Harmony looked hopefully up at her mum, as the older woman smiled and pulled her into a hug.
She ran a hand up to his shoulder blade and this time went on her toes for a kiss. She felt happiness bubble inside as she felt his arms around her, bringing her closer. She didn't think about what she was doing, not even caring if there was a right way. She moved her hand to the back of his head, feeling his silky hair.
"Then help me find out what is wrong." She turned her head as Harmony came with a trailing Luna. Harmony looked as she always did, like a disgruntled 13 year old boy. Sometimes forgetting is easier. She passed them without a word, and went straight to Leighton's door. When the door opened, a girl stepped through, and Draco's heart twisted. There was no hiding misery. Inside the room, none of the students bothered with any small talk. Not with Harmony and her tight lips and crossed arms.
"What was missing?" Snape looked pointedly at Draco. No way was he going to utter the Dark Lord's unmentionables.
"Technically, you don't need much," Ginny put some glittering eye shadow and black eye liner across Harmony's eye lids much like that of a cat. Next the mascara thickened her eye lashes, and Ginny added a touch of blush. "See we are done," she said, and sprayed her body with something that smelled like a tea shop over her head. "You don't have piercings, but a necklace will be fine."
"That rat." Snape spat in revolution, "…was this vision any different?" She thought for a moment, retracing the line of her scar.
"People never plan to 'fall in love', it just happens." Draco countered, while tracing her cheek with one finger.
"Draco? What is the matter?" Draco looked up to see Severus Snape, and it felt like his leg would forsake him.
He lifted the sledge hammer way into the air before bringing it down again in a crack of splinters. "Oh, and if I see any of you using what I teach against each other when not in class, I will personally make you regret it." He wrenched the large hammer out of the demolished desk with the ease of an expert. "We won't be needing desks in my class." There was a stunned silence where they half expected their new teacher to start hurtling weapons at them. They also soon saw that all throughout the walls were covered with all sorts of blades, spheres, cross bows, knives, rods, hooks, needles, axes, hammers, and some weaponry from muggle wars. The unfortunate students at the front saw, from within the darkness of his closet, the silhouette of some kind of unmistakable torture devise.
"He might," Harmony argued. "The Harry I know wouldn't disappear without saying goodbye. Just give him time." The tea kettle came to a boil and Harmony turned to it gratefully, glad for a chance to turn her face away from Hermione's gaze. Harmony poured the tea carefully, trying not to let any trace of guilt show as she thought of all the other people who must feel the same way. Hagrid, Mrs. Weasley... Ron, just to name a few. Not that she wanted the whole magical world to know that she had changed genders. She liked her privacy, her anonymity. She returned back to the kitchen table, armed with two mugs of tea and a blank expression on her face.
Harmony looked up at him in mild surprise, "trying to find out what Voldemort is up to." Draco's hands dropped to her forearms.
When he got back to his compartment he was still smiling. Pansy though looked desperate for his attention and he simply ignored her staring.
Her eyes dilated, she couldn't afford to have Voldemort in her head. After a moment, when the emotions cut off, her eyes rested on Draco's jaw line. She was in his arms as he ran, and Harmony then noticed that it was only the two of them. "Where's Ginny and Luna?" Harmony asked. His eyes met her briefly before concentrating on where they were going.
"You know…something to fasten yourself to so that you won't fly off" and kill yourself in a horrible fashion was heavily implied.
But no hands held Harmony back as she leaped ten feet through the air, latching on to Voldemort's hand. It was satisfying, feeling the bones crunch beneath her teeth, as Voldemort yelled. The wand slipped from the Dark Lord's grasp, as he shook her caracal form off. Harmony dropped down to the ground, hissing with her lips drawn, before reverting back to a girl, and wiping the blood from her mouth. Voldemort clutched his ruined hand, glaring at her. She could feel the Dark Lord prying into her mind and she slammed him out.
"I figured that I wouldn't play games with you and pretend to be something I'm not, saves us the trouble. So let go, I won't run away." She had previously thought that the Malfoys were cold blooded, cold everything. The only thing cold was the darkness.
She had been wrong to think that it would have been better to not be in a relationship during the war. She needed him, she would fight to live.
"Sirius," Harmony sat next to him, and hugged the elder man. "Thank you," she said softly, "but what can you do here, miles and miles away from me?" Sirius gave a lopsided grin.
"I've faced worse," they stepped through the doors and the Great hall looked like cherubs had spewed out hearts, roses, candy, and strings. A fountain with a statue of a cherub on top had punch spilling over, which Harmony could recall was most likely tampered with by Fred and George. Music came from a band, and already couples were dancing on the floor. Harmony met Draco's eyes as they made their way through the throng of students. Her palm prickled with warmth as he held her hand, and she gulped as she saw students pressed against each other or getting smashed by the punch. There were the few who snogged in the corners, and Harmony couldn't stare for too long. "Er. So what do you want to do?" she asked.
He needed to keep himself in control or else he'd scare her off. Perhaps she knew just how bold boys could get, but he knew that she had never gotten anywhere near that close to a girl. The only thing close enough had been Granger's hugs and at the Yule Ball when she danced with Lavender or Patil, he couldn't remember which. He gripped his hands, and thought of the memories that he had come across as he made his way back to his bed. When he closed his eyes, the last thing he thought of was green watching him intently.
"I am not your date," she spat out words tasting like poison on her tongue. He looked down at her in amusement.
"Harry, you must stay with the Dursley family for at least a day, they must miss you dearly." Harry gave Dumbledore an exasperated look; the Headmaster would never understand that they would rather celebrate his death than be in his presence for an hour.
"Don't tell me that your friends with Malfoy as well," Ron said with red cheeks, "cause I won't allow it."
"Nah, let's go on vacation." Harmony smiled. If she knew anything, she knew that she desperately needed a break from getting stabbed or burned or imprisoned.
Draco leaned against the banister in a bored manner, and he turned his head when he heard the clicks from her high heels. She didn't meet his eyes as she pressed down at her dress, and felt as if her insides had flipped. "Hey," she said, "sorry I'm late, I couldn't leave my room, till everyone was gone," she rambled as she stood in front of him. Harmony wished that she had worn something over her bare arms and legs as the cool air permeated through the walls. He held out his arm and Harmony took it with a warm feeling dissipating the cold.
"Alright," Leighton stood up and rolled his shoulder blades. "Let's call it a night," he said, "and don't forget to practice on your own time."
"Like to my face." She shot her partner a look before throwing some random ingredient into the cauldron. He gave her a smirk.
"I got in a fight with Ron," Harmony whispered back, "and I didn't want him to think that I was secretly cheering for Draco."
She finished bathing and dried off to change. When she was finally ready she checked the time and wished herself an early happy birthday.
Draco sat across from her and still the girl stared out determinedly at the white scenery. "Harmony," he said, "look at me." He hadn't expect her to look at him like they still hated each other. "I'm sorry, I couldn't help you." Draco wanted to get closer to her, but her eyes stopped him.
"I also agree, not everything bad is Voldemort's doing, someone is just pulling strings." Harmony did feel like a puppet half the time, she just wanted to be free, to be a real girl. No wait, boy.
"Yeah," Harmony laughed, "I'd like to see you try." She veered right, pressing her body to her broom and shot over the Black Lake. A blast of flames barely missed her, and Harmony swerved each time she heard a shrill 'AVADA KEDAVRA'! She sent curses over her head with meager success, all the while feeling the hot breath of the dragon licking her back. Why the hell did Voldermort have a dragon? It was rather unfair at the moment. Harmony took them further from Hogwarts, deep into the mountains. She dived into the canopy of leaves, dodging branches as she came in too fast, and trees burst in flames around her. The sound of snapping branches was just behind her, and Harmony flew on with a cold sweat making her numb.
"To be with you," he said, an answer, Harmony thought was so funny that she pretended to punch his arm.
"Must have been those nasty Gryffindors, right Crabbe?" Of course Snape would accuse the Gryffindors, any reason to knock off house points. The git probably was asking for it anyway.
"Don't you have somewhere to go or someone else to bother." Potter looked annoyed, and Draco had to suppress a laugh at what Potter was going through. Turning into a girl! Priceless.
Harmony could tell that Sirius was barely conscious. Blood dotted the floor, and his breathing was labored. With each second Sirius's face sheened with blood and sweat. Harmony was powerless to do anything. Move damnit. But her body failed to respond. Sirius was dying before her eyes, and she could only stand there. She looked at Draco again who was motionless as well.
"You need lessons to close off your mind. I assume that you have never heard about occulmency." Snape said, not even waiting for a response. "Occulemency is guarding your mind from people who can use legimus, which is infiltrating a person's mind usually against their will. There is a detrimental connection between you and the Dark Lord, one which he can take advantage of. If he wants to, he could implant messages in your mind, see into the depths of your soul, and use that knowledge to find out what could hurt you the most. Few can master occulmency, and if I am to teach you, it must be in secret. Interested?"
"Nothing. He knows she's safe. Otherwise he'd be off hunting for her like Hagrid and Madame Hooch. That's why McGonagall is so calm about it too, he must have told her. Anyway, I think that Harry Potter won't be seen again, but Harmony will probably be back again next year."
Draco stumbled back, as Nagini slithered over, protecting her master. As Voldemort devoured the remainder of the heart, Harmony crept closer. "Reducto!" Draco shouted, blasting the snake across the room, where it hissed angrily at him.
"Ouch," Draco laughed. "But would you ask others to fall with you. They risk their lives. Even true men will sell you out along with your friends."
"Open," she hissed in parseltongue. At the same time the sink shifted from the wall, the locket clicked open. Two eyes peered back at her from the pictured windows, and she fell forward, almost sucked into the dark depths of the hole.
"Father!" Draco said as the man put a hand to touch Harmony's now passive face. The instant he made contact with the girl, magic shot through his arm. It clawed at him, crushing his arm and tearing outwards from his flesh. The man screamed and cradled the wound that continued to twist and rupture. He wheeled away from her, eyes vivid with pain.
Harmony crumpled the paper in her hands and gave it back to Hermione. "Of course they would blame Sirius," Harmony muttered angrily, "when it was the Ministry's damn fault."
"No, I'm not Harry, that's obviously a boy's name. I'm Marry Jane, your semi local mystery girl." She ended in a slightly believable courtesy.
"Do you remember when the Dark Lord started killing all those women? Eating their hearts?" Harmony asked. And seeing Hermione nod in reply, Harmony stuck two fingers into the collar of her cotton shirt, pulling it down low to reveal the thick jagged scar over her heart. "I was almost his second victim." Seeing Hermione's jaw drop in shock, Harmony fixed her shirt, hiding the scar away again. "Narcissia Malfoy was the first. When Draco refused to become a Death Eater the Dark Lord decided to punish him. He saw it happen..." Harmony paused in her talk, gripped by the memory. "Then the Dark Lord went after me, turned his wand to a knife, stabbed me. If Draco wasn't so good at Healing Magic, I'd, well I wouldn't be here right now. He saved me. He saved those kids, and he risked his life to do it."
"Hell no...I mean that class is taboo for boys. Plus, I just handed in a journal filled with made up dreams that I worked on for nearly the entire night before school started," Ron continued, failing to notice that Harmony had lost interest. "Anyway, think that I have a chance at Quidditch?" Ron asked to no one in particular. "I don't want to make a complete fool out of myself."
"Maybe he can show you how to properly guard yourself, I would think that he would be good at suppressing his emotions." Harmony snorted, and thought that maybe she knew Draco better than he did. Draco hadn't been suppressing himself recently, but perhaps Snape didn't know because she had been guarding her most recent memories.
"Will you watch the game?" Ron asked. Harmony nodded her head and when the conversation drifted elsewhere, she turned around to the Slytherin table. Draco wasn't there.
"Nothing is certain yet, but I think that The Dark Lord is using her to keep Lucious in his place. At least that is all I hope."
Heat seeped through Harmony's clothes, but it did not stop the cold, the desperation, or the shivers that stripped her body hollow. Something was pressing her wrist firmly. "Episkey," echoed in her ears as her brain reluctantly processed a deep low voice. 'What happened?' she tried to form with her leaden lips, but a grown met her ears.
He wished that he could tell someone, but that would have been absurd. He just couldn't tell his Father and Mother that Harry Potter had turned into a girl and now he was dating her. He would have to send them a lie about the girl, because he knew that they would hear about him and the girl soon. One of the Slytherins would say something. Plus he had to assure them that she was pure blood or something. That would be the first thing that they would ask.
"Ah, you must be Miss Granger. It has come to my attention that most of your lessons were without the test of practicals. The point is that students need more than knowledge, they need to get away from their heavy reliance on wands, they cannot learn to defend themselves from the dark arts behind the safety of bound pages."
Harmony would undoubtedly say, "Draco and his girlfriend. He knows that I still want to be with her." The red head was so predictable as he believed what he wanted to hear all along. Draco could almost see the wand hit the target, as Ron nodded, glaring at him. So this was why they were tolerating each other. Why Harry refused to go to the dance. Draco and Harry were acting different because of this girl. It was so simple and the Weasley boy ate it up like another mouth full of pancakes. Hermione frowned in thought, but he couldn't catch what she had said. "Granger said, 'Harry, you did look like a boy in love," Blaise said next to him, with his eyes intent on the bushy haired girl, "what did you send to them? It's weird when you laugh at something from across the hall."
"Yes," Leighton brought a fist to his chin, "You," he pointed at Ginny, "will hereby be known as Hook, and you," he added as he then turned his finger to Luna, "will be known as Dash." Luna didn't even blink from the name. "But it would seem that we will have another visitor tonight," Leighton scrunched up his nose, "a weasel."
He slid open the door and took a step forward, almost ruining his loafers with a toad in his way. They were so blatantly staring at his face that he easily slipped the frog out of the compartment. "Weasel, mudblood we got a prefect meeting at the front of the train and I am gathering everyone. So do hurry up." They were still staring at him, except for Ron who was more like glaring.
"No, I went through the forest looking for wounded animals, and then brought them in. None of them were harmed by me." Harmony analyzed a mouse who looked damaged beyond repair. As if it had been squished by a careless bear romping through the forest.
"What's wrong with him?" Harry asked as he got up for a better view. Crabbe's rotund body blocked part of his entertainment.
"Headmistress McGonagall? That's- wow," Harmony closed her eyes feeling as the exhaustion leaded her down, she watched him for as long as she could, till her eyes pulled shut.
Fletcher frowned and with a shaking hand went into his robes to empty out his pockets. Silverware of all kinds and other magical items began to pile to the floor, and Kreacher looked on with beaming eyes. "And the locket!" Kreacher croaked when that had not yet been revealed. Fletcher looked on in disgust before lifting up from over his neck a locket that he clenched in his soot filled hands. Once Harmony touched the cold chain of the locket, she nearly dropped it. Her scar pricked with heat. With it in her hands, the pain disappeared and Harmony saw how beautiful and deadly it was.
"Since it is almost the end of October," Kingscross thought out loud, "tonight will do." He started for his office, and the students followed uncertainty behind him. On his desk was a key, a sea shell, a torn book cover, a clay drinking cup, a fraying toothbrush, and a jar of honeydukes candies. "A month and a half has passed, and I think that most of you will be able to transfigure into animal forms." Their eyes were set warily on the objects atop his desk. "The objects here are portkeys to different biomes, and if you are in your natural animal habitat, it may induce the transformation." They clustered around the seemingly innocuous key. "Questions anyone?"
When Harmony saw bushy brown hair, she felt safe to walk into the kitchen. Harmony took a seat at the square table, directly across from Hermione. She tried to look away and pretend not to see that her former best friend was wiping tears away from her eyes. As Harmony noticed that a new, silent trickle started right where the last drops left, she couldn't keep silent anymore.
Draco felt the sting before he saw the blow. The Defense Against the Dark Arts Room was dimly lit, and they were practicing dueling. Not the kind that he had performed in front of his school mates in his second year, but the one where there were no rules. He had thought that he would be a decent fighter, but in actuality, he was a good hider. Throughout the room there were constructed walls, and ledges; so that they could corner someone or use it as a shield. Draco stooped behind one now, listening intently to his surroundings. Occasionally he could hear the blast of a spell colliding against a wall and the debris of splinters thudding against the ground, but otherwise this was a game of ambush. Professor Kingscross, as Draco refused to call him HoneyDukes, wanted them to open up their natural senses. "Let your animal side take over," he had said, but Draco was finding such a thing to be increasingly challenging. The beast inside of him was dormant. When he thought of a gaping maw, like that of a shark, it didn't settle properly within him. When he thought of powerful forearms, of that of a gorilla, tuffs of coarse black fur did not sprout across his arms. Draco could not even utter a feral note of any sort. Surely there was something wrong with the professor's teaching method. He had gone through numerous animal kingdoms, gone through all of the venomous reptiles, the malicious beasts, exotic creatures, and magical fay, but none matched his power animal.
"Don't fret, we will deliver the clothes and get a bite at the Pegasus Diner." Harmony followed closely behind her and wondered if Mcgonagall ever had a daughter or anyone to take care of. It was hard to imagine any of the Hogwart's staff having families, or at least married. They seemed content though, unless teaching really was secretly a miserable affair.
"I'll try to talk some sense in him," Hermione left and most of the crowd with her. Harmony glared at the rest of her house mates till they all left as well.
It was the isolation that scared him, and it was worse than the time before being a wizard was a fairy tale. Harry Potter was one of the most famous wizards alive, and the prospect of everyone knowing would be unbearable. He wondered what his friends would say. Ron was his best mate, but sometimes he could be the biggest arse pain ever, even to the point that he would think this sex change was a ploy for attention. Hermione would try to help, but Harry knew that no words could help him now.
"You already are," she said softly. Draco looked at the offending hand that clasped on the girl's wrist, and realizing that it brought forth a pleasant warmth, he yanked his hand away. The force spilled the vanilla over her shirt, and dripped down to the parchment of her book.
Severus's eyelid twitched. He was still angry with the little stunt Dumbledore had pulled at the party. He wanted to blast the headmaster in neon pink, every inch and strand of him. He took a seat, uncomfortable in the smaller chair. "Now is not a good time."
But there was one pressing emotion that wouldn't go away, and he examined it with curiosity. He loved her. It was a strange time to discover it, but it was the only thing he was sure of right now. He touched the ring that spiraled with an auburn brown color.
"Harry Potter," cried out the Dark Lord, from atop the back of the dragon. Then it all made sense. Why there was a dragon at Hogwarts and where Harmony was running. He understood and he had to stop her. He had to convince her not to do something that left her hurt again, or worse this time.
"Lucky Charms Cereal," Dumbledore whispered loud enough for Harry to hear the password. He looked at the boy and winked, "they're magically delicious." The spiral staircase appeared and they both made it up to his office. Dumbledore gestured towards the comfy chair in front of his desk and also sat down. "Now, what I tell you should not be repeated in case it falls to the wrong ears."
She paused when she saw Charlie's eyes turn to her, and flick up and down her body. Before she could feel uncomfortable, Charlie smiled and mentioned, "I see that you like dragons."
His eyes fell on Draco Malfoy and the same figure kissing. Malfoy had his hands going through the black messy hair, and still Remus couldn't see the other's face. "Harry?" he asked, shocked.
"And that's a bad thing?" Draco muttered, and ceased to mention the Dark Lord's insanity anymore, from Snape's furrowed eyebrows creating a hairy caterpillar. "Wouldn't it be like the Dark Lord is partially kissed from a dementor? If he only had pieces of his soul."
Harmony strode through the halls making her way to the Defense Against the Dark Arts room. It was the first day of lessons and she had spent the early morning attempting to transfigure her face. She brushed a hand against her chin and felt the pasty face cream making her Harry Potter. It was almost too easy to fool people, to fool her Gryffindor mates. It was like all they saw was what they wanted to see, to see the great Harry Potter, their savior; but there is always something beneath the surface.
"I just wanted to be with you," Draco could no longer hold the accusation in her eyes. He had to show her that he cared.
She transfigured her face before leaving the room and adorned her glasses on her nose. She saw Ron from across the room, but didn't join him on his way to Divinations. She wasn't quite sure why she was ducking her head, but she figured that this would be easier for the both of them for now. She knew that he felt just as bad and unsure about their friendship, and Harmony didn't want to screw whatever left there was. Harmony was sure that once everything stabilized in her life, then she could fit Ron and Hermione somewhere.
There was something about the girl, that he couldn't quite put his finger on. He waited until Draco and Harmony left down one of the passageways to drop his act. He didn't even care if the pair of them could still hear him or not.
"What? You haven't thought of him as anything more," Ginny laughed. "He's 18, freaking hot and single. Ah! If only he paid half as much attention to me as he does to you."
"I am pleased that no one has died in my absence," professor Snape said slowly. Maybe this year he would not suffer from any severe migraines. "Class, we will start by examining your level- by making the calming draught on the board." His brow met in concentration, black hair curtained around hollow cheeks. Students wondered if his silence meant that they should start. He at last let out a slow calculated nod as his eyes migrated from cool gray to vivid green. "But you will not be using the partners sitting next to you." Many of the students' eyes scattered about for possible candidates more than tolerable. "Which I will be picking," he enjoyed their stunned looks of silence.
It had been easier than she thought to get everything sorted out for her to go back to school, just a letter here and there. She was registered as Harmony Black and allowed to go into their sixth year.
Harmony looked at the livid creature that was huffing and wheezing. "Just return what you have, Fletcher, and we can all forget this happened."
She tried to remember why she woke up like this. But couldn't. "It was a nightmare. Thanks for waking me up."
"But I have no need for my spirit," Voldemort muttered to himself. And Severus too was coming to understand everything. Whatever was left of the Dark Lord's spirit was too little for his body, as if he were on the brink of death. "There is much amiss," Voldemort said quietly. "Leave me."
"Strange too that you don't look anything like him, and yet, look just like another witch I once knew. Lily Evans."
"Hey, look at that pretty girl, she probably isn't from here or else I would have asked her out." Harry was so glad to have her broom as she flew around the dragon's head to confuse it. The dragon though just stalked her with its slit eyes and flicked its forked tongue as if it was tasting prey.
"Thanks guys," Harmony muttered. They could hear Luna skipping before they actually saw her. She had her wand tucked behind her ear.
"When the other kids are out on break, I can go inside and find a deserted room, or closet. I know quite a bunch of places."
"It meant that the one with the only chance to subdue Lord Voldemort was born at the end of July, nearly fifteen years ago, whose parents had already defied him three times."
"How may I help you miss," came a voice behind her. She spun around to her right in a bit of alarm but saw Leighton. "Ah, Harmony nice to see you well."
"Yeah, but why would you be at my door?" Leighton asked, not really caring for an answer. "I am quite too busy to inquire from you when I could ask your head of house as to why he is sending his students to crouch at my door."
"At the moment of life and death, those few seconds before everything is lost are the most important. If you can not produce the antidote, then at least you can preform a spell to slow the poison, or slow the heart. Healing as well as pain comes in many forms. In a battle, we can not always rely on a mediwizzard. So, who wants a taste?"
"Did, you see that? That Ravenclaw chaser almost got a bludger to the head!" Ginny said and whispered what must have been 'wicked'. Harmony had not seen that, she had spotted the snitch not fifteen yards away. It was hovering near their bleachers, where the wall and the banner meet. No wonder the snitch was so allusive, it was blending in with the gold banner. If she were on a broom, it would have been in her hand already. She couldn't afford to look away or else lose it. She knew that it would be too soon to catch it now, anyway.
She ambled through the dark halls. Who does Malfoy think he is? Ordering me around like this? She thought with annoyance. She neared the hall to the room. Him and his conceited fat head that I want to-
"Sir, I work in that shop down there," he pointed where Snape and Sirius came from, "and I stood by the window when I felt something amiss. I hoped that no one was out there, but I heard a shout. I couldn't help but charge out and cast a Patronus charm when I saw the dementors over this young lady. I was just bandaging her wounds when you came along." His eyes flicked to the dog as Snape continued to stare him down and nodded his head in slow reluctance.
The two of them stopped in front of an old Italian villa. Ginny stepped around the fountain of the too perfect baby angel, and up the winding staircase to the entrance. The doorway opened when they stepped in front of it, and Ginny saw Blaise smiling down at her, with Draco at his side.
The blanket snaked around Harmony's twisting form as she unconsciously writhed. She fought against her body as she relived Sirius's death. Harmony could barely breathe as the sheets rung around her neck, chest and stomach. She quivered and shook with the desperation to escape her confines, till finally Sirius's eyes glazed dead and locked on her.
She celebrated the rest of the day indoors with Sirius talking about nothing and everything. She enjoyed his company and made him tell her some stories of the milder marauders misadventures. She especially enjoyed the one when her father and him had set a bunch of Munching Moths in the Slytherin Dungeons. These moths only ate hair follicles, which happened to cure Snivellus's grease problem.
"What the Hell is wrong with you guys? It's bloody Malfoy! The Slytherin pounce!" Ron huffed. Hermione came through the portrait and realized immediately that her Ronie Pooh needed help. "Seriously!"
"Alright," Draco said, "i'll see you later Sly." She smiled at him before wandering off. Draco could only think of her for the remainder of class, and when Leighton did send them off, Draco watched Harmony go. He barely even noticed Blaise come at his side, and stare at him oddly.
Something big and heavy rattled the walls, and Harmony stepped outside once more where professors and Order of the Phoenix members fought against Death Eaters who spiraled like comets burning black with coal.
"You can let me down now." She could hear them running closer, and Harmony slipped from his arms to run to the cellar door. It didn't open when she touched it. "How do you-"
"There's something I didn't get a chance to tell you, before all of this happened." Harmony said looking up at Draco seriously. "I love you too."
Draco waited till Harmony had magical fitness to talk to her. He sat on the bench that bisected the lockers and wandlessly clicked his faded gray locker open. She came in a creak and plopped her bag down before joining him. "So what's up?" she asked and took off her glasses and Potter guise.
"For a moment there I thought that I would have to make excuses for your untimely death," Draco whispered. "Should you go to the nurse or something…"
Fletcher gave a nervous laugh and got behind a kitchen chair. "Ya don't believe this thing, right Harry?"
"Keep the change," he said and on his way out he turned to her, "I'll look forward seeing you on the Hogwarts Express."
"Did I tell you guys to stop?" Immediately, the words Expecto and Patrunos filled the room, and Leighton nodded his head in approval. "Remember, happy thoughts!"
"Elves are quite remarkable," she said. "Everyone underestimates them, and forgets how powerful their magic is."
"How is it so far for you?" Harmony shrugged her shoulders not wanting to answer what was all too obvious. "May I call you Harmony?" Harmony gave a single nod and enjoyed the air rushing through her short hair.
Harry did not feel the hands that gripped his shoulder. He could not see the figure that knelt beside him. He would not be able to recall that he had been carried away. Even though the pain numbed his senses, he felt the warmth much like that of an embra
"Don't call the Dark Lord that!" Draco jerked a bit from the name. "He wouldn't kill a loyal pure blood— no, he will rid the world of those who go against him and his ideals…There's still a chance for you too, if you want to be on the winning side." She looked up at him with disgust. "You will die a fool, if you actually expect to win and defeat the Dark Lord, Potter."
"Wha- what are you talking about?" Her heart rate pounded along her veins. Was this some cruel new tactic to scare her. She saw his smirk and really wanted to see into his mind. The door thudded open but Harry had eyes only set for Malfoy. A void filled between them as he pulled away from her and his faint scent lingered along with their combined heat. He chuckled then and Harry berated herself for behaving like such a girl.
"Screw that," Draco said as he went about to unbutton the shirt clinging to his chest. For some inkling suspicion she thought that Draco had somehow planed this from the beginning. "Well, aren't you going to turn around? This isn't a show, Potter."
"Why, you embarrassed by me, can't be the white sheep of the family, the one who sides with the light." Harmony placed her hands on her waist.
Snape glowered at Harmony, "Of all the arrogant, idiotic plans, even you should have known better than that. What were you even doing there?" His look turned from dark to livid, when he saw that the girl didn't even seem to be taken aback.
"Stop it." She shot at him, struggling to get away. How did he get so strong? She wanted to howl with frustration. When did she get so weak? He held her tighter. "Ugg," she stopped moving, figuring that the faster she got this done the better. "You probably won't tell me how you found out that I am a girl, so tell me what you want and then leave me alone."
He passed three more shelves where he beheld the most beautiful sight he ever witnessed in his short almost fifteen years of life; Harry Potter on the floor writhing in agony. Harry' eyes were shut, teeth clenched issuing no sound, except for the occasional chorus of pain. Draco actually wished Collin camera boy was there, and something in the back of his mind was playing Beethoven's Fifth. Potter was at the end of his mercy, and Draco could not help but smirk a bit as he watched the boy wonder twitch.
"I didn't tell you about that necklace," he said and Harmony brought a hand to it, "it's a family heirloom."
Draco brushed the bangs from her eyes, getting a good look at her. "You'd better hurry, gonna be late again."
The girls moved their arms in unison, and the embarrassment Harmony felt at first subsided as she began to enjoy the exercise. It was the single dancing that she had never experienced before, one where it did not matter if she skipped a beat, or completely botched up the routine. She held the feeling of freedom, of flying, and when it ended her heart echoed with the diminishing beat.
"Then you must guard your most personal memories well, or else i will know everything about you." Harmony opened her eyes, and watched snape. "I told you to empty your mind from emotions. Legilimens!" It was easy for Snape to pick at her most guarded thoughts. Sirius came in her thoughts, and Harmony failed from keeping her emotions in check. The more he came at her, the more anxious and worse she got at blocking him. She would think that she had nothing to hide from him soon, and Harmony couldn't believe that they were doing the same thing for months. All of her fears, dreams, happiness, and desires were open for him to see, and Harmony could still not block him. "Are you even trying?" he asked.
Harmony rested her head against a pane of glass on the Hogwarts Express, with eyes vaguely aware of moving greenery. She felt lucky that she and Ginny had found a compartment, and that Ron and Hermione had left for prefect duty. She was determined not to think about the looks she had received since she stepped on the train. She wasn't going to think about the dotty Ravenclaw, Luna Lovegood, wearing radish earrings and reading an upside down magazine who was sharing their train compartment. Harmony's mind was completely and utterly focused on tranquility and nothing was going to bother her.
Hamony ignored the cheers that erupted all around her as Ravenclaw scored once again. Now was usually the time that the Slytherins played dirty. Bludgers were soon aimed and heads were narrowly missed. The two seekers followed close to each other, and Harmony scanned the field for any glint of gold.
She trailed her wand against the wood of the door, sending her magic inside. She knew that there were four people in the room. As she took another step, she felt something down at her feet and lifted her foot. There was an index finger. Harmony leaned against a wall, sick. Something thudded against the door. "Why do you give me useless books! This does not explain ANYTHING! That Rat didn't know what he had to me, and I cut off all of his fingers till he cried like the filth he is!" The marble floors cracked inside and Harmony put her eye to the small key hole. Her eyes swiveled, not getting a clear view. As she focused on a bald white skull her scar seared. The top of Voldemort's robes were exposed, and she could see raw cracks in his skin, and black veins that spider webbed up his neck. Voldemort gestured at his chest. "And still he could not explain why this is happening to me! Why have I been given my body back, only for it to be falling apart! Must I go out to find the answer myself, do any of you care?" They didn't respond, "Useless!" Voldemort spat. "Where is Snape?"
"If anyone asks, we were out flying over the marshes, but it doesn't matter, because no one is going to ask." Ginny explained, staring at Harmony's lips. Lip gloss. Of course, she knew that something was missing. "People eat up simple explanations. Trust me, I've been off visiting Blaise all summer and no one's noticed."
It was a week before the dance, and Harmony wondered if Draco would ask her still. She was on edge about it, and then shook her head. She stepped through the halls, as she made her way to the library, and blocked a bucket of black ink from falling on her head. She would have gotten drenched if she hadn't heard the ink slosh before it emptied. She heard a snicker, but didn't catch the student.
"Vold-," she quickly stopped herself at the sever expression on his face, "The Dark Lord was torturing someone."
"You don't know anything about me, so don't judge me like you do." Dudley got up quickly and made to leave. "Sorry for disturbing you."
"You're a riot," Draco put a thick spread of raspberry jam on his toast, "I think you would like Harmony. She's coming over soon."
"Hah!" They ran back in, when their fingers were ready to freeze off and the sun was almost sucked into the ground. They laughed as they barged into the castle, not caring about who saw them. She almost went head long into the Slytherins.
"So what do you want to see first?" Harry asked, "There's Hagrid's hut, the library, the kitchen, the trophy room, the clock tower, or er- the, well that's it."
He packed everything from his room into his trunk and prepared for the train ride back. To his relief, the spots had disappeared, and he felt as good as new. Better even, with the prospect of tormenting Potty. He happily got on the Hogwarts express and with his gang went to an empty apartment. He had seen Potter briefly, but it discouraged him that he still looked the same. Draco felt certain that it was not a dream he had; it couldn't have been. Leaving his Slytherin pals, and Pansy's cries of distress, he went Potter hunting.
"What's wrong with you, Malfoy?" she didn't know that she had said that aloud. Someone had cursed him because he never had tried this on her before; unless he was that desperate for some action. He rose from his seat with one hand blocking her escape route to the door. His other hand brushed against her jaw line to her glasses making her skin tingle from the small caress. She saw his face clearer now that the fake lenses were off and he was mere inches away. He bent close to her ear and the air stopped in her throat. What the hell?
Harmony sighed, suddenly regretting the distance that she had allowed to grow between them. She almost felt the impulsive urge to just tell her the truth. But no-it was too late for that. "I just want you to feel better, here-just let me make you a cup of tea." Harmony stood up getting away from the table. She summoned the tea kettle to herself with wandless magic, and filled it with water. She could feel the eyes of the other girl on her behind her back, as she got the mugs ready.
"I heard that they needed an eligible male to be your dance instructor," Sirius said, returning the attention back to him. Harmony hoped that it wasn't Snape. Talk about awkward. "And I think that I have more than enough ample time and skill."
Air swept past her ear tassels as she dropped back to earth, and she too landed on Leighton's back, though not as gently. Her claws felt the coarse fur, but the smell of blood didn't trickle through. She jumped away before the bear could rise, and she melted into the leaves and brush of the forest. The snap of a twig alerted her of a new creature, and her eyes brushed over Draco.
She didn't know if she was beautiful, but she knew that she would never be called ugly. She smiled at her reflection and decided that she made a pretty good girl. If she was still a guy she would definitely check herself out…wait she was herself, so it wouldn't matter if she would take a look. She couldn't help but slap her face, feeling like a moron. Her whole body structure was undeniably that of a girl and with her hands she could feel her pelvis bones jutting out. Harry blinked a few more times at her reflection and took the courage to grace the elder men with her presence.
Sirius aimed first, a jet of blue that the other man sidestepped. Sirius shot another spell that whipped around the room and scorched the walls and furniture. Malfoy shielded himself, but was winded from the force. He retaliated with a curse that shot gusts of piercing wind that slashed the floors but was unable to touch Sirius.
Draco could only catch Harmony with his eyes from afar. The rock music turned to a soft waltz tune, and Draco involuntarily edged his way towards her. He admired the short lilac dress that hugged her body, and tugged at his senses. Her wondered how her hair danced in curls to her shoulders, and he wanted to pull off the mask she wore that had flowers concealing her scar. He couldn't look away. She was beautiful.
She frowned at him, and Draco could read the emotions on her so well. "Hey Potter," he said and smirked, "mind telling me your happiest thought." She looked up at him before looking around them. There were some people watching them, but Draco didn't care.
He sprinted with a desperation that he didn't know he had. His gasps echoed with his feet and soon enough, he made it back to the three girls.
Draco's face enveloped her focus. He was laughing in a cruel taunting way, she wasn't sure what he was castigating her about, but it struck her.
Harry Potter was not happy. This was not directly because she was forced to stay at the Dursleys. This wasn't even entirely because she had recently gone trough a weird sex change which was making her cramp with pains and grow unmentionables. She sat on her bed staring at the letter in her hands written by Professor McGonagall.
"Hey, where's Luna?" Ginny asked, "I could have sworn that she had got on the portkey with us." Indeed the girl was no where in sight, and Draco sighed, hoping that it didn't mean that they had to stay any longer in this God forsaken tropical forest.
A burst of wandless magic pushed Voldemort a step back as he reflected it away. His crooked teeth showed as flames erupted from his wand, and Harmony blocked it just as the flames licked her sleeves. She clutched her wand, as rage urged her to kill him. Curses and hexes shattered marble and exploded antiques as they missed their targets. None of the Death Eaters moved as their Lord fought against a fifteen year old girl.
Lilly Potter tried to say something else, but everything started to blur. Harmony thought she could read "I love you," on her mother's lips, but the light was dimming, and she became aware of a sharp pain in her chest. The pain was intense, more than any she had ever felt before, and Harmony turned against it, then fell asleep.
Harmony froze, looking over at Narcissa whose blood still spread across the marble. She heard Draco call out to her, "No, Harmony, don't." She couldn't bring herself to look at him.
"Wasn't that-" Draco started and frowned, "nevermind." Three pairs of eyes looked at the boy wonder who shrugged his shoulders.
He went back to the Slytherin common room to find Crabbe and Goyle who were essential for his plan. He knew that they could only be in five places. The dinning hall to eat, the Slytherin common room to chill, outside to beat up the disrespectful first and second years, the bathroom to give those brats a nice dunking in the toilets, and the library. Well not in the traditional sense to read books, like they could anyway, but to find worthy Gryffindors to teach valuable lessons. Considering the time of day, he figured they had their fill of Hufflepuffs and were in the Slytherin house.
"that could have been really hot," Ginny added, which didn't help matters. "What were you thinking, you sly dog."
"Whatever," she sighed, "if you think you can handle me, that is." She gave a little internal laugh. She would give him hell. He lifted an eyebrow but did not comment.
"Precisely Potter, and we'll do it for months and months till you finally get it." Snape looked sour as he thought of all of the time that that would ensue. Too long even for a sane man. "But perhaps Malfoy can help, or else give you incentive enough to hide something from him. A secret or something delightfully embarrassing. There is a lot, you know." Harmony turned red, and Draco wondered if the girl had lived half her life embarrassing herself. He wouldn't be surprised if it was true, by the way she glared at Snape. "Alright," Snape turned on him, "shall we go again?"
His eyes searched hers, concentrating, as if looking for the golden snitch. "I love you," he said with words that choked her with longing and hurt. She kissed him, slow at first, but an urgency pushed her against him. The kiss deepened, aching with a heat for more. It was simple. She loved him, but saying so would make leaving cruel. The beating of her heart timed the kiss, till she gripped his front robes almost desperately, and left. She was soaring high into the air aware of the tingling and wetness on her lips, and had to bite the bottom of her lip. With a hand to her face, Harry Potter returned. By then the dragon reared in front of her.
There was that prickle in her thoughts again, and Harmony wished for everything to be alright. She wanted to make it to Sirius before midnight. She checked her bag to make sure the gift was there.
"Some bullocks that the houses should unite during dark times," Ron answered. "Can you imagine the Slytherins being all cozy with us? It's completely mental!" More names were called to be sorted.
"I'm not wrong," Luna said without question, "You are Harry." They all stared at the girl, and Draco, to his displeasure, was momentarily forgotten.
"I'm so glad that I'm not in the boy's dormitory anymore," Harmony said, "and that the locket is finally destroyed. I don't have to listen to any more of Ron's snoring."
"It's OK, Snape uses a sledge hammer compared to you." Harmony gave a small laugh, but Draco doubted that she was joking.
"I didn't think that he would be able to put up with you every other night," Draco challenged. Harmony gave a light laugh that tinkled in his ear.
"Because I need someone there who knows what's right," Draco said earnestly, "so that I don't give in to what the Dark Lord says."
"Er, right." Harmony hoped that people weren't smart enough to put two and two together. She wisely turned away from Ron and Hermione who were making googly eyes at each other.
"What?" Voldemort searched Severus's face, for a lie. His anger was ready to burst with uncontrollable magic.
Harmony slinked behind the stores on the narrow back alley streets heading in the general direction of her flat. there was not a single wizard out as she made her way and it was all silent, save for the pounding of her heart and the taps of her footsteps. The sky overhead began to darken to a stormy black gray, and she hoped that it was a wizard shower or something, and nothing more.
"Nah, just pulling your leg. We can see that's he's different. Less intolerable. I suspect that its your doing, Harry." Harmony shrugged her shoulders.
The harassment didn't end. Sometimes she'd be walking down the halls, and from behind a corner, a hex would knock her down. Other times a cup or quill would explode before she touched it, and Harmony knew that they were playing a game with her. She wondered which one of the Slytherins took Draco's place, if not most of them.
The bookshelves loomed over his head in menacing columns while the darkness encompassed the endlessly large room. He figured that the restricted section would be in the very back, but before he could explore, he heard a curious noise. He turned in the direction and lauded his bravery only to take a step and fall on his face. "Oww, bloody wanker," he said and looked for the object that tripped him. It was a pile of silvery fabric, embroidered with a curious set of geometric patterns. Someone just had to leave it right where anyone could trip over it. He was instantly glad no one witnessed such a humiliation.
"I heard what they were saying downstairs, well, that you are possessed by you-know-who." Harmony looked down to the floor. "But that's bullocks. I remember Riddle's Diary, what it did to me, but that doesn't make you evil Harry." Harmony continued to stare at the floor, wishing she knew how to turn off the damn faucet in her eyes.
"You've made a mistake, Potter." Fletcher hoisted himself up and brushed his dust encrusted robes before fleeing the room.
Harry glanced up at him and muttered what Draco assumed to be an apology and continued on. To Draco, Harry appeared waxy and almost in pain, but he could honestly care less. In fact, Draco grinned as he thought that Potter deserved it. What, with how everyone practically worshiped Pott, and how he didn't have to do anything to gain his fame, well except for surviving a lethal curse. The whole Gryffindor righteousness and Potter's disgustingly high and mighty hero complex was- well, disgusting.
Or not? Like I mentioned before, you could do well in Slytherin. You have a fair amount of cunning, I suppose. You would gain power and influence there. But you do realize that you are very brave right? My brave students tend to go to...
Severus hated it when the headmaster popped out of no where. "There is no apparating on Hogwarts grounds," he said, "why can't you be a normal wizard and knock!"
"Harry, what happened to you?" Ron peered into her tired face. She had changed back from Snape's office and she couldn't rid of the headache prickling behind her eyes.
"But you should at least watch what you are eating, wouldn't want to spew out a rainbow of vomit." The twins turned their attention away from Ron giving him a final pat on the head.
"Kill me now," Ron whispered across the table, making gagging noises. Harmony chuckled and tried to hide it with her sleeves.
"Someone I might know?" Draco nodded and Pansy smiled. "Me?" He laughed loudly, and wouldn't look at her for the rest of the ride. He didn't want to lead her on, now that he got new prey to feast on. He couldn't wait for next year with Potter girl, and all the ways he could torment her.
"They took the first years back to Hogwarts with Dobby. My Father apparated us here." Harmony blinked up in surprise, "now he's in hiding."
"Why," Ginny demanded, but shook her head, knowing that they were doing it in spite of Malfoy Senior, "when."
"Damn, what did you put in there? It burns." She grabbed his hand. "You better know where you're going," he muttered with his eyes sealed shut. A slight remorse trickled down her gut, from seeing the harm that she had caused. He held her hand tightly, and must have been really blinded from the potion. Their clasped fingers slackened and slid till the contact ceased when they arrived to the loo. The sound of water flowing and draining alerted Draco to start rinsing his eyes. Tepid water slipped through his fingers and down his arms. Water droplets caught in his hair, and dripped down his jaw line.
"No, we play sports and exercise most of the time," Ginny responded, "Why have fun?" A smirk formed on her lips.
Ron gave Harmony a big smile before shouting Hermione's name, and waving at the girl. Harmony turned away, wanting to do something relaxing. She ignored the clustering students on the side of the roads, marveling at the brightly lit window displays. She almost tripped over a dog that somehow materialized at her feet. The black blur reared on its hind paws before reaching at her as if it wanted a hug. She grinned widely, smothering her arms around the dog's head. The dog barked happily, wagging its tail and sniffing her uncontrollably. He nearly slobbered all over her face, and Harmony had to clasp the dog's muzzle between her hands.
"Alright, lead the way." Harmony knew where she was going, well most of the time. It was just with him, when she wasn't really thinking about where she was going. She was reminded of when she had said those same words to him, when they had been under the invisibility cloak. That night had changed so many things. She wished that it hadn't. What could have happened wasn't a mystery. Harmony looked at him and her lips remembered what she had locked away. What the locket had taken from her.
"For as long as I choose," Snape snapped, "and these will be your partners. Longbottom," Snape almost shouted, making Neville jump in his seat, "work with Granger." Neville looked miles relieved, and Ron folded his arms across his chest. "Goyle," he boomed, pointing a long bony finger at the massive boy "and Crabbe. Weasley," Snape managed to spit out, "and Bulstrude." Ron looked stricken in his seat, anguish already mortifying his pallid face. He turned around to face the large girl named Millicent, who cracked her knuckles when she saw him. "Thomas, work with Nott. Parkinson and Brown." Pansy gave a little huff of disdain, she had wished to be with Draco. Harmony felt dread seep into constricting lungs, as if wretchedness loved to laden its victims with icy damnation. She shut her eyes. Oh, God no. "Zabini will work with Patil," Snape paused, practically standing over Harmony. "Malfoy…," Snape paused as if wondering if he really knew what he was doing, "and Potter." Her eyes ascended expecting to witness a livid sneer, but she caught only a glint of pensive listlessness in cave black eyes.
"Some of the Slytherins want to hurt you because of that. Watch your back Draco, Hogwarts isn't safe for you." Draco snorted, remembering Snape and his father had said something similar to that.
"Well, let's just say that he isn't all too much of a gloomy thundercloud. Usually he looks like he just ate nine super sour lemon drops, but today he seems to be in a melancholy cheerfulness."
"Harmony," he hugged the girl, bringing her close. Harmony took off the glasses that were on her face and willed her real appearance to show. he smiled down at her, and Harmony barely noticed the deeper lines that creased his charming face. "Oh, how I missed you," he said at last. "It's much too dreary to be cooped up in that house."
Their first fight began during the Great Hall, as the owls brought in the morning post- dropping the letters on students' plates. Draco watched as his eagle owl swooped down to the boy wonder and Harmony caught the parchment with an easy flick of the wrist. She flipped it between her hands, and Draco watched with a smile as she broke the wax. He could only see the back of her head, but still he pictured the shock and small intake of breath. She'd see what he had written in his angular script. Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like mine?
"Dragon spice green tea," Draco said and he and the waiter looked to Harmony and her untouched menu. She opened it and picked the first thing she read.
They hadn't been able to take the locket from her hand. He could feel the effects of the locket on him. It whispered in his ear. Will you stab the fang through her hand? It laughed. Kill her with the the basilisk venom? You don't want to save her. She despises you, blames you for Sirius's death. The image of Leighton and Harmony played out before him. They were against each other laughing at him. Leighton molded to her lips, taking her away from him. Draco clenched the fang and the darkness surrounded him. Kill her! Draco lifted the chain of the locket and placed the tip of the fang on one the glass windows. It pricked the eye at it's pupil. She will never be with you! It screamed, You will kill her!
"Just let me get the last bit of information, and then you may get what you need." He pointed at Harmony. It was surreal that no one knew her name, that she was essentially no one and that if this even got in the paper, it would be lucky to be on the seventh page.
"Uh, where did you get that?" Draco asked, and eyed what other monstrosities that could be in her bag.
Harmony knew that she had gotten persuasive, but she hadn't thought that Draco would skip classes twice in a row. It was especially easier whenever she asked him as a girl too. She'd just pull him aside from a dark corner, and wait for everyone to leave.
"Oh Harry," Ginny said from two seats away, "You have to go. Tell Professor Snape to shove his detentions elsewhere, because you have more important things to do."
"Oh," Harmony looked around the room before seeing an extended rope hanging well above a massive pool. "Please tell me we aren't swimming."
When she landed, Luna sat at the top and waved down at everybody. Luna stood up and took a few steps then began to float down and cheers greeted her. She landed on her feet and they sat down further away from the others, breathing hard. "That was certainly challenging," Harmony said, but she was glad that it had cleared her mind.
"Look Ginny, I swear that I won't run away," Harmony practically pleaded for the tenth time, "I can sit still and proper." She had gone through the most unimaginable torture. She had been pricked with tweezers, smeared with glitter, sprayed with womanly smells, and even her nails were painted.
Voldemort turned to Draco and sneered. "Now it's your turn you little traitor." Harmony watched with bristling anger as Draco didn't have time to react and Voldemort shot him with crucio. Hands held Lucious Malfoy back, as his son screamed.
"You're good Potter, but you can't hide from me." Draco whispered and chuckled a bit. He hastily brought the curtain in place when he heard footsteps and dragged his legs to his bed. The door clicked open and two figures passed him.
Snape watched the girl leave, reminiscing in green eyes he cherished, green that he had sent to death. He stared at nothing, closing his eyes shut.
McGonagall went to Harmony and hugged her tightly. "I heard what happened and we will take you home immediately." Harmony's eyes drifted first to Dumbledore who nodded, and then to Leighton who appeared to be a bit amused.
"Try it on me first then," Snape said, "and I will block you out." Draco did as he was told, and Snape did indeed have everything bottled up somewhere too deep for anyone to penetrate. It was like going into a black expanse of nothing, a deep ocean with something dangerous lurking there. Draco pulled away and felt a slight headache forming. "That is how your mind should be blocked." Snape said, "now try on Harmony." Harmony at first didn't meet his eyes, and Draco didn't blame her. He wouldn't want her plunging into his deepest thoughts and memories. When she did look into his gray eyes, Draco went right past her green windows and everything was there. he could sense her fear and the way that she tried to scramble her thoughts away. He could sense all of her emotions as if they were his own. Draco didn't want to go digging, but easily scooped up her memories as if she were a shallow pound, with her thoughts as fish.
He found his wand plop like a lightning bug in the dust. He gripped it with shaking fingers as he brightened the area with light. "Harmony?" She was on the floor and Draco turned her over to see a mist clouding her. Her fist with the locket wouldn't loosen, and Draco felt fear grip him. Luna slipped through the vines and sat next to Harmony.
She continued on to the Gryffindor fifth year bedroom. There was a brown paper bag that had her answer. She recalled the little mirror that Sirius had given her if she needed him, that he would be there. She went through her suitcase, not caring about the mess she was making as she uprooted her clothes and keepsakes. Her search was like digging for treasure, and soon her hands crinkled against the brown paper bag. She pulled it out and examined it. She could see the ceiling of a dark room. She tapped the mirror, trying to activate it.
"It's only 3," Ginny said, "it's barely a lift." She passed her the high heels, and Harmony tried them on. "What size are you?" she asked.
Harmony lifted her head from against his chest and looked into his eyes. "Voldemort has killed everyone I care about. I don't have to do this. I want to." She replied. Draco's heart sank as all of his arguments crumbled apart. Unconsciously, Harmony tightened her grip on her Firebolt. He could feel the determination radiating off of her. There was no way that he was going to be able to convince her. Desperation bubbled inside of him. This could be the last time that he ever saw her. He had to do something.
"How?" Harmony started then changed her mind "No, you better get your eyes checked because I don't recall your annoying face."
"Professor, Harmony needs help," Draco said. "And Sirius Black has been killed." Snape's eyes widened.
"So I assume that they sleep here and here," she motioned to the beds made into dirt nests. "Arricneo," she cast on both of the beds. "Also known as the Bucking Bronco Hex. They'll fly off once they hop in. And this will slap them silly," she pointed to their pillows. "And for giving me an indian rug burn, here is a jar of maggots and cockroaches. She spilled it on their left over food.
"No, he's here," Harmony began to feel the tension of her magic. "He's going to do something-" The door that they had entered slammed shut. "Hold it." At the corner of her eye, Harmony saw something shift. She focused on the spot, but nothing was there, just rows of artillery.
Damn, a lecture. Draco took in a deep breath, thinking about potions class. Snape went on and on about poisons. Every day. Every class. He practically breathed the word venom, with it dripping from his mouth.
She pushed the door open, surprised at its heaviness. The smell of perfume hit her in a wave and she looked around at the large expanse of the room. The florescent like lighting hurt her eyes and she could see girls stretching in little shorts and tank tops of all different colors. They noticed the very embarrassed looking Harry Potter, and giggled and whispered amongst themselves. She scanned the room and saw what must have been the professor.
Something in Harmony's brain echoed, a light tap to her memories. Don't trust him. Had Snape foreseen this? Who was the he that she was to not trust. "You. What makes you think that I give my trust out so easily? Do you think that because now we are friends you can tell me what to do? This is bigger than you or me." Harmony fisted her hands to tight balls, her eyes fastened on his. "Who do you think you are?" His eyebrow twitched, for a moment it would look like his cold harsh exterior would drop, but just as quickly as the hurt came, he replaced it with apathy.
She relaxed, closing her eyes, and unclenching her hand. It was possible. Harmony could be alive. But was she OK? Ginny opened her eyes to see that Blaise had gotten off the desk and was watching her.
"You don't want to do that and get expelled from Hogwarts this year," he said in a uninterested kind of manner "Then I will be bored all year, plus I don't think I could control my father if you do something to me, he can get pretty mean to those he doesn't like."
One of the corners of Draco's lips came up, and it reminded her of the previous night. And she was caught off guard. She was alone with Draco in a place where no one knew about, and there was something mischievous about Draco. She watched him as he got up, and he stood in front of her, close enough that if he wanted, he could easily wrap a hand behind her back. "Sorry, I was too focused on you to concentrate on anything you were talking about."
Harmony pulled everything out from under her bed and Ginny smiled when she saw the silver dress. "Good choice," she said, "hopefully Draco will be gentlemanly enough."
Fake-Harry looked over at Blaise, surprise etched over her face. However she covered it up by giving him the finger. Leaving him to wonder whether she hated him or was still playing the part of Potter. She started heading to the Gryffindor common rooms, out of his reach.
More unbelievable than the fact that Snape allowed her to have a merry dandy time at Hogsmeade was that Ginny had actually tied her to a chair. The fortunate thing, thought highly debatable, was that Harmony was still conscious.
"Tell me when you figure it out," Draco said, "if there is in fact something even up." Blaise laughed at Draco.
"Happy birthday to you, happy birth day to you~." She awoke to three people singing to her each with smiles. Sirius, McGonagall, and Madame Pomfrey ended the song and they allowed her to change to be presentable. She felt so happy, celebrating the day with Sirius. She ran out of the room to the smell of sausage and pancakes, to see three packages on the table.
She couldn't so easily suppress her emotions, but she tried not to have her emotions on her sleeve as Snape so nicely put it. "That's enough for today," Snape said, and Harmony nodded her head. "Though the memory of you and Draco," Snape said, and Harmony instantly flared up, "the one when Draco offered to help you in occlumency, may not be such a bad idea."
"It's not your fault, Weasley just needs to grow up." Draco smiled at her. "It's too bad the weasel doesn't have an ounce of tact in his whole body."
"Sure. I'll see you at dinner." She faltered in her steps. I'll see you at Hogsmeade shimmered through her steps.
"Excuse me, but what?" Horror filled Harry's face. This old man really was off his trolley. Unless male wizards were different than muggle boys, Harry was totally lost.
"Hello," she said as she sat next to the two, and Ginny gave her a questioning glance. "Aren't you going to cheer for your team over there?" Harmony pointed to the huddled Ravenclaws, and Luna smiled.
"Avada Kedavra!" he shouted. A green surge of magic struck the stunned form of a Hufflepuff first year girl. She lay as she had before, with her pigtails sticking out, except the gleam faded from her eyes, and she stared out with a glassy look. He pointed his wand at Draco next, who was hunched against the wall. "Come," he commanded Harmony with malice. "Unless you want his death on your hands."
"I always wondered why he was so interested in you all of these years, but I never thought it was because he's a poof." Ginny said with a huff of air.
"About that…I trust that Professor Snape can be gentleman like and not violate the innocent you; his attacks, though creative, don't really get far in the pursuit of love. Professor Kingscross on the other hand, he's a different story. He looks to be the kind who can obtain his desires, no matter the form or how difficult. And Malfoy has already made his move, with his nosing about in your business, soon he will find out about these late night visits with Professor Kingscross. How then would you guard yourself from all of these advances? Hmm, tell me then if you can handle it."
"Yes, but it's a mouse, if you use that it might make the mouse's heart beat too much till it explodes."
"It's Harry, dad." Dudley grunted. Uncle Vernon looked to be having an aneurysm, but Harry knew that she shouldn't hope for too much. Harry gave a hesitant smile and made sure to be out of tackling range.
She met Draco in the changing room, and convinced him to go outside. She held a note that she had forged from Madame Pomfrey, that excused her from class. Draco smirked at her, and as they went to the quidditch locker room, Harmony changed to a girl. The wind was frozen against her cheeks, and her teeth chattered as she flew, but she raced along side Draco. Her firebolt gave her an edge as they made laps in the field, but Draco flew on beside her, pushing the limits of his Nimbus 2001. Draco laughed as they put away their gear, since Harmony's hair stuck up, and looked to be frozen in places.
However, leaving the flat meant locking away Harmony, and she didn't know whether that thought appealed to her or not.
"Well mostly I like to get under your skin, but I don't want the other students to think that we are actually friends- or trying to play nice."
"When I grew up, I got to know a young Slytherin, and he was the best friend I ever had." Lily touched her daughter's cheek. "And his name was Severus Snape."
"What." Harmony gave the professor a hard look, taking in his broad chest, umber short bed head hair, square rugged jaw line, and honey colored eyes. "Oh. Leighton."
"Ouch," Draco said, "that almost hurt, Weasley." Draco continued to smirk. By this point, Ron looked like a plump cherry, ready to pop. He lifted his wand and pointed it at Draco.
Draco was surprised at his self-control. Perhaps all of the mind exercises controlled his emotions, but what ever it was, Draco decided that it was good that he hadn't acted rashly. He knew that she wouldn't have him if he were acting like a child. She would think poorly of him for interrupting her. Kingscross would probably laugh at him, and Draco knew that he wouldn't be able to best him yet. Draco had to wait, even if it tore him apart.
"I suppose it won't hurt," Snape said, as if it was a lost cause any way. Harmony looked surprised at Draco, and he tried to give her an encouraging smile in return.
She was close to him, able to see his face clearly. She let the cloak slip to the stone ground, and Draco gave a surprised start. "Wow," he said, "That explains a lot." He moved from the wall. "I was about to go and meet you."
"My Harry, do you have an appetite." Ron said with a mouth full of chicken breast. She could swear that Ron had little to no tact. Did he have any sympathy for the plight of the undersized prepubescent boy making his journey to womanhood? Harmony could swear that her ovaries had grown claws and were doing a number on her delicate woman parts.
"Well technically, I don't need these," she tapped her pocket where her specs rested, all the while keeping her eyes on Draco.
"Thanks," she mumbled as gave him a warm hug. "Thank you for being here with me." It meant more than she could ever express.
Though he loved all the attention from the ladies, he could not find one he fancied. They bored him, resembled miscellaneous animals, or were fake in his eyes. A sigh escaped his lips as he once again had to pry Pansy's hot pink nails from his much abused arm. They rounded a corner and neared the Great Hall. "Pansy," he tried, "not while I'm walking, I don't want to trip and-" The door to the dinning hall swept open and the boy wonder brushed past him without so much as an apology. "Watch it Potter," he warned.
"Hey!" she turned around to see that he was nowhere in sight. "Draco?" She went around in a circle before calling his name once more. There. She saw the tiny shadow of a ferret scampering towards the castle and laughed. Draco changed back and began to run a good few feet ahead, and though she ran till the white of the world swarmed around her, she could not catch up with her shorter legs.
"I just needed to talk with wonder boy here," He stressed the word and looked directly at Potter, "Till next year, and remember what I said about the glasses." He dropped the glasses on her lap and gave her a wink before passing through the door.
"Wait!" she called, and began to chase after it. The ferret wasn't as fast as her, so she caught up fast, and scoped it up once more. "You can't go off like that, Mrs. Noris could find you, or any other careless foot." The ferret shook its head, and wiggled until she was forced to let the ferret down, or else drop it. It crawled along the wall, and Harmony followed it. It looked cute, and determined as it sometimes looked back to see where she was. The students they passed were too busy to see the ferret, but some nodded at her. "Where are you going?" she asked it.
"Hey, where did that bear go?" Ginny asked to Harmony's right. She squinted her eyes, and indeed the bear was gone. A misty light streamed from her wand. What was going on? She moved her wand to the left and not three feet away was the bear statue on all fours.
Ginny's hand hovered over her lip glosses, deciding, before pulling out the red. Red was classy, and bold. If anyone could pull it off, it was Harmony. Ginny handed the lip gloss to Harmony, and watched as she applied the red, completing the look. "Perfect..." Ginny commented.
"F-ck…Ginny there's something I think I should tell you, and it's going to sound incredibly strange..."
"Draco," she looked into his gray eyes, "we can't be together." He did not expected that. She withdrew her hand from his.
"I'll forget to take it off tonight, and tomorrow, people will look at my nails and say 'Hell Potter, gay much'?"
"Alright," she said, meeting his gray eyes "here goes nothing. Legillemens." Draco felt her mind poke into his head almost hesitantly. He easily blocked out his most precious memories and allowed only his mundane ones present. He even guarded his thoughts from hers and occasionally said something to her. 'It's alright,' Draco thought, 'try to break through deeper.' He felt as Harmony grazed the surface of his mind. She went further, and Draco smiled at her progress. She snatched one of his memories of when he had been three, and had received his first toy broom. He forced her to let that go, and he reorganized his mind. A brilliant idea occurred to him as he made her see certain things. Of him watching her play quidditch and admitting that she was very good. How he watched her from across the great hall, and heard as he wondered about her. Draco could tell that she was interested as she went further into his mind. But this was dangerous for her as well, if she went too far without knowing where she was going. Draco lead her out, he pushed her from his mind gently at first, then completely without warning.
Harmony turned to the gray eyed ferret, who looked nervously across the room at his father then to her.
Heat condensed visibly in the room, swirling and suffocating. "Sit down now," a high pitched voice pinched from a taught mouth. Harmony and Ron jumped to an empty table, and many of the other students joined in on the game of musical chairs, wanting to sit with their friends. On each table a glass orb sat, waiting for an owner to gaze into its depths. Students stared at their professor, foreseeing listless days in her class.
Harmony pictured Voldemort and his bald snake face as she punched the air in front of her. She went at every direction, and threw in some kicks to his groin. It would have been fun, but she tired after twenty seconds. She didn't stop as her arms burned from the excursion. "Keep going," Leighton said, "this is your personal monster you are fighting, give it a good fight." Harmony lashed out at her invisible Voldemort, and felt the satisfaction of his jaw moving and everything. She'd show him. "Done," Leighton said. Harmony turned to Draco and saw him smirking. It was obvious who his personal monster was, considering that he was glaring at the man in a self satisfied kind of way. Harmony almost laughed but she was too out of breath.
"On purpose," Snape said, by now every students' eyes were on their professor, all but Draco who watched Harmony from his corner.
Draco Malfoy gave his smug smirk that he knew the girls swooned over. Pansy predictably latched to his side and admired the way the torch light melted with his hair and cast mysterious shadows along his face, or so he believed. Ever since Cedric's death, Draco most certainly claimed to be the most sought after male in Hogwarts, disregarding Potter of course (and the sexy beast Severus Snape….*cough*).
"Don't-, at least... I got the chance to try to save her." Draco lightly held her fingers before bringing them to his lips. "Thank you."
"But Harry, we're your best mates," Ron sat on the floor. She laughed at him. Would they ever leave?
"Yeah, and what would your girlfriend think if she caught you staring at Harry?" Draco grinned at the boy and laughed. Draco liked how girlfriend sounded to him.
"It's secret, but Dobby, this is important. I need you to apparate us to the Malfoy Manor." Dobby looked anything but enthused. His ears flopped against his head as he repeated to himself how unsafe it was. "We want to save the students and Draco's mum." Harmony didn't know how Narcissa treated Dobby, but the way that the elf had no reaction, hinted at it.
"Who are you and how did you get in here?" Leighton demanded while raising his wand and stepping in front of Harmony.
Draco didn't let go of her hand. "Nothing," she said, "just some vanilla extract." His mouth dropped.
Like a tree twisting and turning unable to find light, Snape's form hunched crookedly over Ron, his spidery fingers latched to the desk. "Would you like to take his detention instead, Mister Weasley?"
"Really Ron, it's not so bad," Harmony assured them, "I'm used to cleaning." She realized her mistake as they looked awkwardly at her. Shite. She could tell that they were thinking about the Dursley's. "I can handle it guys."
His mouth opened and closed like a gold fish, but he nodded his head and hopped off from where he slept, a few feet from the ground. When they left the Elves sleeping room, Dobby turned to the now boy looking Potter. " Harry Potter, why did you look like a girl?"
"This isn't a game," Harmony said. Anger fumed from her small frame, but instead of lashing out, she turned away from him and ran. He gritted his teeth. This was a game; A game of cat and mouse.
They boarded the Knightbus, heading straight to the empty third deck. Harmony took a seat on one of the beds, and Draco slid in behind her, and immediately began lifting up her shirt.
"What are you talking about?" Harmony wondered, "and it's still too dangerous for you to be out again."
"I think Luna is cute," Ginny said holding her own arm out and Luna leaped on her, to her head. Draco though, thought the creature creepy looking with its blue eyes. It stared at him and gave a small high-pitched rumble from her throat.
"I thought of a nick name for you," Draco said softly as his patronus began to dissipate. He turned to her and put down his wand. "it's sly." He stood in front of her, and didn't even care that she looked like a boy.
"I'm not interested," Draco responded coolly. Pansy began to press against him, but Draco had already dismissed her from his thoughts. His face hardened as if the metal of his mask melted and contorted to his face. Boys were asking Harmony to dance. His body bristled. He got the urge to hex the eyes out of their sockets. He calmed a bit thought, when he saw that Harmony had declined their advances. But the Weasley twins were different, the tenacious wankers, they cornered her like they were hound dogs, and she a coon.
Soon the light materialized around them and Harmony lifted her head from his back. She slid off and ignored Ginny hiding her mouth and having a good laugh about the whole thing. "Thanks Draco," she said.
"Alright are you ready?" At the sight of Harmony's nod, Ginny transfigured herself into a hawk. As she felt her human body give way to wings and talons, Ginny let the excitement flood her, as she left her tiny room behind her and broke free into the clear night sky. Her hawk eyes watched the caracal that jumped down, rooftop by rooftop until it landed on the grass and bounded across the ground below her, keeping up with her pace.
"What was that?" Harmony asked. She picked at the locket further, but it was stuck. "Strange it won't open."
"That's good, because it's a bit boring when you look like that," Draco said as he waved a hand in her general direction. "Don't want people to think that I am a poof, that would break one too many hearts."
"Why do you like them?" Charlie asked, and Harmony noticed that the side conversations halted, as Ginny and the twins looked her way, curious for an answer.
"Very well," Snape said, "and if I witness another poorly constructed fight in my class, I will give you two a real detention. Leave." Draco gave a curt nod and thanked Snape before leaving the man.
"Are you recovered?" Snape asked expressionlessly, and Harmony nodded in reply, "then I shall return you to Hogwarts."
She pictured her friends, of Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, she could feel their love and support, but she knew that those walls would be flimsy. If an enemy saw that her focus was only set in friendship, then they could torture them to get to her. She needed something else. Harmony imagined Sirius, and happiness filled her, but sadness too from his plight. There were her parents, the ones she only heard of. She concentrated on the unconditional love of her mother, and the happy family the three of them would have been. But she could never actually experience this happy family; only the idea. She began to think harder, to reach for something that could ground her. But she couldn't find it.
"Because the rat blotched up my resurrection, and I became incomplete." Voldemort took a step closer over a fallen trunk.
"Er. She's a muggle. The kind of muggle who wears expensive clothing to convince other muggles to buy the same clothes. It's quite complicated I know. I met her on the way to a candy shop, where I saved her from a car that suddenly veered onto the sidewalk, nearly trampling her." Harmony smiled and decided not to think about why a car would suddenly lose control at such a convenient time.
"Whatever, let's just work on this potion," Draco placated. "I'll even get the ingredients with you to make sure that you get the right ones." Harmony walked in front, passing tables that were already chopping and brewing their calming drought. She passed Snape without meeting his haunting gaze and pushed the closet door with more force than necessary and didn't bother to hold it out for him. After a few moments she heard the door close and the walls glowed with a faint white light.
"I think I see Hermione," she replied, hoping that he would be distracted. It worked and soon Ron was bouncing on his heels, eager already to give Hermione the gift. He quickly hid it in his robes and flattened his hair down.
"Minervra is waiting in the apartment, I'll be back momentarily and trust that nothing further will commence," Snape gave them each the Snape Glare, well mostly towards Leighton, and left the room with his cape billowing for added effect.
It ended in a light tickle that itched his chest and abdominal muscles. He frowned as he placed a hand there, thinking that he had not grown a smidgen since turning fourteen. The likely hood of some miraculous growth spurt was almost a sick joke for him. Ron was already towering over him, and he could have sworn that he had even shrunk a bit. Just thinking of his body sent another tremor of itchiness. He would have laughed if not for the onslaught of cramps.
Professor Snape had opened his mouth, ready with another retort. His mouth snapped shut instead. Harmony watched as the anger drained out of the man.
The anticipation of seeing Harmony, set Draco into something of a nervousness which he was not used to. His stomach turned as the train halted to admit the students on the platform. He took out his pocket mirror, to recheck that everything was in place. Draco gave himself a dashing smile before it snapped with a click, as footsteps began to pass his compartment. The silence of the train was soon replaced with chatter and laughter and Draco sat alone in his compartment.
Unforgivable curses whispered enticingly in her mind, and as if Mr. Malfoy could hear her, he turned to the girl. His eyes widened, as she shot a spell that struck his face and left a laceration there. His face twisted into a mask of loathing, and the sickening vengeance enraptured her.
"I guess you can say that," Draco opened the doors of the dinning hall. "Potter isn't a complete arse."
They were told to keep their wands, and Madam Hooch had them run laps and stretch. A beating music filled the room, and the girls got in rows. She stood in the back next to Ginny and Luna, ignoring the ever present glances thrown her way.
The woman looked dead, like the blood had been drained from her body, from a wound to her heart, but even so, she was beautiful, timeless even. The woman was on a circle array, and the unmistakable thudding of a still beating heart pounded in Harmony's ears. Harmony saw the woman's face and woke up, dread making her cold, staring up at the flickering candles of the Great Hall. Narcissa Malfoy's bloodless face stared at her as Harmony closed her eyes. Harmony sat up, and shook the girl next to her. "Ginny," she whispered, "wake up." Harmony attempted to be quieter as someone else moved. "Ginny!" The girl opened her eyes, "we need to get out of here. Turn into a hawk and wake up Luna," Harmony whispered, as she kept her Potter mask in place.
"That felt good," Harmony said with a slight smile. It was quite easy, all she had to do was think of everything that frustrated her and lash it out with a swing of her arms. She was just glad that she hadn't embarrassed herself with a war cry.
"Then let's go out into the woods and find wounded animals," Harmony leaned forward on the balcony and looked down below at the fields.
"Ok, we can appear as enemies, but lay off the severities of the insults. I don't particularly like to be scathed." She turned to the wall and grabbed one long rooster feather. On the lower shelf there were some newt egg shells that she needed. She then noticed that Malfoy had not moved since they had ended their conversation. "Are you going to just stand there, or help me?"
"Why is it so important to you?" Harmony muttered. Kreacher's fingers twitched as if the air rattled them.
The story of Regulus Black switching lockets stayed with Harmony all through the night. Each time her eyes closed, Black would be there, dead and so much like Sirius. You must destroy it! Or the red eyes of Voldemort would show Kreacher choking on poison. But what was the locket? The locket rested, heavy on her chest and she clenched her hand around it. Whatever it was, she imagined it to be Voldemort, splintered and destroyed. The Black brothers would be avenged.
"I would go with the caracal running wild through their dorm," Ginny said, "it's a little less dangerous than the fire."
As if cued by the mention of hurtling objects, owls swept in delivering the post. Flitting its way through letters and rolled bundles of The Prophet, a hand crafted bird flapped and danced in the air, before landing in front of Harmony. Ginny's eyes searched her, but none of her other friends had noticed the small folded parchment's journey. She encased it in a lose fist before hiding her hand under the table. Harmony pulled it open.
"Some are already gone, but with each one the Dark Lord possesses, a part of his lost humanity is restored."
"And I care what they think?" Harmony asked, but really stated. Draco shrugged his shoulders before changing their directions and continuing on. She needed a class where she could let lose her stress and put her small frame to work.
"Let's get dressed then, and meet at the kitchens," Luna said. Harmony turned in to a caracal and bounded through the halls. Ginny flew above her head, and soon they made it to the Gryffindor portal. Harmony changed and grabbed her invisibility cloak, before checking the Marauder's map. The halls were clear, except that each entrance way to the outside was blocked by teachers. Hagrid and McGonagall had the main entrance. Leighton was at a side corridor, Hooch was by the Quidditch field, Trelawny was by the roof tower, while Sprout and Filch patrolled the halls.
"Don't let her hear that," Blaise chuckled. "It all makes sense now. Why you are friends, why you have disobeyed your father, and why both of you have been acting so strange. At first I thought it was mental. Potter would never make a hot girl and you would never date him, but then I saw your girlfriend. I thought you hated those green eyes, but hell she's hot."
"If anyone is a rodent it's you and your family, you produce like them, and live in a burrow, what more can I say. Oh and Longbottom, someone reported a missing toad, you might want to find it before someone steps on it." Okay, so Ron was soon to explode with furry but thankfully left with Hermione. Neville then squirmed out to look for Trevor. Malfoy gave her a brilliant smile that she knew girls would be melted by. She knew that look though; she had given it to girls too.
"It would actually relieve me, if you went after guys instead of girls," A sly smile spread across his features. "Though, if you are referring that you fancy me, then I have nothing to worry about." Harmony could only gape at him, she could feel heat crawling up her neck, to her face and ears. Only he would come up with that.
Her locker was at the Gryffindor end, and Harmony had the broom in her hand when she heard the door open behind her. She turned, stopping, and her Harry Potter face fell away. She didn't want to see him. "Draco," she said softly. It was obvious that he had followed her.
"A caracal," Kingscross supplied. Draco got up to his feet, surprised that no lingering aftereffects were present. Harmony drifted away from the meat, and the sight of that red meat triggered annoyance through Draco.
But it wasn't like Harmony was in love or anything. She was just friends with Draco, and only happened to like certain things about him a lot. Things that she hadn't thought about before in anyone else. Harmony quit that line of thinking as a certain voice reminded her that she shouldn't be fooling around; like she would ever be in a normal relationship anyway. She'd have to give up a big part of herself is she'd ever be in a relationship with anyone, and she doubted that she would ever tell the person that she had been a boy for 15 years of her life. That wasn't something that guys thought alluring in a girl, and Harmony shook her head at her limited possibilities at happiness.
"The roof is that way," Draco laughed and pointed to another stairwell, "you sure you know where you're going?"
Claws pinned her shoulder down and Harmony waited for the bite to her neck. She could feel the hot breath of the dragon and the aching stabs as the roots dug into her burned back. When the dragon snorted in her face, she looked up in surprise. Its nostrils flared as it sniffed and went through her white collared shirt. "What? Why isn't Potter screaming?" Voldemort looked over the dragon's horns and peered down. The dragon prodded at her shirt till the Malfoy heirloom slipped out, and Harmony realized that it was the dragon necklace Draco had given her that spread a warmth over her chest. "What?" Voldemort screeched and began hissing angrily at the dragon. Harmony met the dragon's red eyes as she recalled Draco's words to her, it's said that dragon's blood or poison is at the center...
The last name was called, a name that Harmony immediately forgot, and the little girl scampered to the Ravenclaw table to join a concentration of excited first years. Dumbledore stood in the middle of the staff table to stare at all of his students. "To our newly arrived students," Dumbledore called out with his eyes buzzing with glee like that of a toddler in a candy shop "welcome! To our returning students- welcome back! There is a time for speeches, but this is not it. Bon appétit!"
Draco placed his bag down in their five star hotel room, regarding all of the muggle contraptions warily. His eyes drifted to a large black box thing against the wall, at the foot of the bed. "Hey Harmony, what's that?" he asked as he pointed to the box.
Harmony wanted to pull a prank on them, then laugh and laugh till her head hurt. At the library with Ginny and Luna, she thought of all of the things she could do. When she started to draw pictures and diagrams, Ginny gave her input.
"For what it's worth," Harmony said tentatively, "I doubt that Harry is dead." Hermione raised her eyes to meet Harmony's bright green ones. "Come on now. The Dark Lord couldn't even kill Harry when he was a baby. How could he possibly kill an older, stronger Harry?"
"Of course," Draco said, she withdrew her arm as if his lips had seared her. She stared at lips that had moved against her fingers. He chuckled at her. "I just thought that you stood me up, so you surprised me."
"I don't think so, I like you where you are." Harmony's mind went blank, she hated to be controlled, to have someone think that they could use her.
"HARRY! Ron he's here! How are you? Oh I hope you aren't mad with us, I know our letters were bullocks, but Dumbledore made us promise, and oh we missed you so much!" Herminone said beaming. "Come upstairs, we have so much to tell you, and I bet you have so much to tell us!" And Harmony found herself half pulled half hugged by a grinning Hermione. Ron, to Harmony's great dismay had grown a few more inches during the summer, while Harmony was sure that she had shrunk. It took off the edge to her happiness at seeing her friends.
Her body began to shake violently. The magic holding the door broke free, but she had lost sight of her surroundings. "you are mine, Harry Potter!"
"It's-" Harmony said between laughs, "just that you look like a kid discovering candy for the first time. Who would have guessed that you would like the telly."
Draco lifted himself careful from the wall and watched as the students waved their wands and said expecto patronum with minimal results. Some of them had mist come out, but that was only the Gryffindors. The only one who had a patronus, besides Leighton, was Harmony. Her stag leaped across the walls and the weaponry glowed as it passed. He had to admit that she was impressive. She went around giving tips to the others, and he knew that the Slytherins were listening in on her. Draco watched her move around the classroom, and he wondered what name would fit her.
Dumbledore nodded and called for Poppy for help. Harry wished that Snape would stop gawking at his new body and knew that some snide remark would fall from his gaping lips. He pushed the sheets away and slung his slender legs over the mattress to test if his feet could support his weight. Madam Pomfrey bustled to him and gave her support. A little loo was stationed at the back and Harry made his way alone to one of the stalls. He would never imagine that relieving himself would be such a challenge. At first he wondered how girls could piss while standing, but he freaked when he realized something else. All he could repeat in remorse was 'where had it gone'!
The chill of the February air permeated through the potions class room, and Harmony rested her head against the coarse, deeply rigged wood. She watched as the cauldron bubbled and sent a warm blue light against her cooled cheeks. She wondered how long she could stay with her head on the desk before Snape said anything. The last time she had made three minutes. Her hand neared the flame and warmed up to its glowing. The ring on her finger danced with a faint red color, and Harmony glanced at Draco who watched the timer on their desk. She could read him better, tell when something was bothering him. It must have been from all of that time they practiced Occlumency, that hinted at certain things behind his gray eyes. Draco turned the timer over, and the black streamed from the tiny opening at the center. He stirred the potion counter clockwise twice, and noticed Harmony's current state of boredom.
"You'll understand someday," Ginny said, and Harmony hoped not to. "Alright, I'll start with your hair. That should be simple enough." Ginny sat Harmony down and had something like a straightener that passed through Harmony's short black hair.
"Which you are," Ginny chuckled, "so he found out about your friendship? Took him long enough. It was probably Hermione who sent him to it."
"Ginny, are you alright?" She looked over at the tall form of Blaise Zabini as he leaned against the stone halls next to her.
"Let's go." Harmony said and held on to his hand as they made their way out of the dancers. They got on line and Harmony watched the dance floor. There was Ginny and Micheal with their hands in the air and jumping up and down. Harmony didn't know how the girl could do that in heels so high. "Hey it's Leighton." She saw Leighton with the other teachers with a glass of punch occupying him. Leighton pulled out a move or two when he thought that the other professors weren't looking. It seemed like there were a few girls going up to him for a dance, which he shook his head to.
He made his lone trek back to the Slytherin house without seeing many students. He was still mad at her though and many of the students averted their eyes when he yelled at them for staring. He was glad when he saw Theodore, and even happier that he had his wand with him. Revenge felt sweet to him, especially now that he could use all of those new curses.
Harmony stood up and looked at Ron, feeling the gap between them as the red headed boy scowled at her. She wondered why Snape was doing this, pairing her with him. They stood in front of the class with wands out, and Harmony wondered how she was going to do this painlessly for the both of them. It was strange seeing him giving her a look that he reserved for those he deemed as slimy gits.
"What's the matter Frisker? Can't keep up with everyone?" Professor Kingscross broke the silence, and let Draco go. Humiliation coursed through Draco's being, and he wanted to crucio that bloody wanker. Draco spun around but he had already eluded him.
"Fine I'll turn around. But you only have one minute, and don't you dare touch your face." Harmony tackled her clothes mindful not to be anywhere near her head, or suffer Ginny's wrath. After in a more presentable state, Ginny turned around and conjured up a mirror for Harmony to see. Not a sound came out of Harmony's lips. Ginny had transformed her. She had become used to seeing herself as a girl, but the girl now in the mirror was different. She leaned in closer to inspect her long black eyelashes, the purple hues that shimmered on her eyelids, and the tiny hint of pink that caught some of the light on her lips. With her scar properly covered, Harmony's vibrant green eyes were the only things that marked her as Harry. She gave a hesitant smile, hoping that this wasn't a female ritual that she would have to master.
"No, but it's strange, when I had the locket everything stressed me out." Harmony draped the towel around her back, already feeling the cold lessen.
"It is very nice of you all to take my class this year. It pleases me to see such interest in young minds for Divinations." Harmony glared at the ball, wondering what was worse, setting herself on fire or sitting through a years worth of Divinations. "At your seats there is an orb to practice your eye's ability to see, look into it now and the Sight will come to you." Students gazed into the glass, attempting to see something in vain as Trelawny perched at her desk.
She left Potions alone and with her mind elsewhere while on her way to charms. Maybe she made herself into an easy target, especially without Ron and Hermione at her sides to back her up. But her housemates were close enough to watch as a spell drenched her in ice cold water, waking her up from her thoughts. Harmony gasped as her robes flooded and and water snaked around her torso and swept down her legs. When she turned around, many of the Slytherins were laughing and pointing at her. She wasn't sure who had cast it, and Harmony shivered in her wet shoes as she glared at them. Her only consolation was that no one could see her not so male figure in the thick cloaks she wore.
"Here are your books, sir." Leighton cut him off holding four worn out books. Malfoy grabbed them without looking at them and gave him a sack of coins.
"Really," she said dryly. She didn't like the idea of both of them slythering into her mind, "why is that?"
"Hmm," Blaise stretched out and scratched his short almost black hair lazily, "you'd think that Granger would have thought of it already, being Harry's best friend and all, but I can see now that the girl is busy with the red head. I haven't seen the trio together for quite some time. Did you get them to hate each other Draco?" Draco took a knife and cut his toast in a clean cut.
"You are being antisocial! Malfoy is making you hate everything." Harmony now really wanted to shove the doorknob in his gob.
"I ran here," she put a hand to her heated cheeks. A that precise moment, Draco opened the boys' changing room, and a couple of girls turned to see him in a clinging black shirt and loose shorts. Ginny grabbed her hand seconds latter.
Draco shook his head, amazed at her stupidity. "You can't just add anything you want, the properties of the potion react specifically to what you put in."
She opened her door to see Ron. "What is it?" she asked, with her annoyance clear to the both of them.
"No need to be dramatic." Draco responded coolly, taking a step closer, lessening the gap between them. "It's a force of habit, really."
"I don't believe you." Did he think it would be that simple? She may be trusting, but that did not make her daft. "You have a hidden agenda."
Harmony paused, considering. She was young, and rich, and she could do magic. And now there was nothing stopping her. "Everywhere," she answered.
"Draco isn't his father, and he's not a death eater if that's what you're thinking." A deep red was seeping through his cheeks.
"Here is good," she said as she stopped at the top of the stairway where they usually met. He knew why she wanted to say goodnight here.
Snap had lied, it hurt like hell. He could feel his bones shifting to that of a girl's anatomy. His lower stomach burned and he wouldn't even mention the corrosive pain of a specific sensitive organ that would even make Voldemort cry like a little girl. Well maybe he would cry out in happiness from the pain feeling so good, like Harry could imagine. Damn potion catalysis that made the magic in his blood to enervate so that he would turn back into his rightful gender. Damn Voldemort and his inability to die. And damn his life for being so crappy.
"I see you have dolled up for me, an improvement if I have ever seen one from you," Draco whispered as he rested a hand to her lower back. She wished that she wore a cloak or something to cover her thin pajamas. She glared up at him, at the darkness.
"Where is Dumbledore?" Harmony had asked when she returned from her obnoxious Malfoy encounter and ice cream recovery session. Not that she particularly needed more attention from certain interfering old wankers, like more sex changes, she just wanted answers. It didn't make things any better that her lower stomach kept on acting up either.
"There is something else though." Draco looked around them to make sure that the others weren't sticking their ears at him. "it's the way you look at him." Blaise frowned, "like constantly." Draco couldn't flat out say that he was in love with Potter. Was he really that obvious?
Harmony rested her head against the cool glass of the train, failing to blot out the other occupants in the compartment. Her eyes appeared dark from another sleepless night, and she rubbed them from under her glasses. Going back to Hogwarts had not lightened her spirit. She wished that Ron and Hermione could keep their hands to themselves when they thought that no one was looking. It irked enough that she couldn't muster any warmth for them.
"Alright," Snape returned to his desk and watched her with keen eyes. Harmony left him and she wondered if he was acting stranger than usual. She had almost forgot to put on her Harry disguise when she heard some footsteps near. She ran to her room without meeting anyone, and got ready for the next day. The weekend was coming soon.
He stepped out after her in time to see her leap on her broom, as her figure soared off, until she was nothing more than a speck. Then she was gone.
"I have been, and don't change the subject. So you found out that Potter liked this girl, tried your own hand at getting her- to hurt Potter no doubt- but fell in love instead. How precious! If anything, it makes for a good story". Draco shrugged his shoulders. "I like it, it's almost believable." Draco laughed at Blaise.
"Harmony," he said and held her hands, "what's wrong?" She wanted to pull away, and he saw that. "Don't." She looked at him, aware of the blush that betrayed her. That she could not hide, even if she wanted.
Draco could not fathom why Sirius Black was there or why his father was on the verge of murdering a man.
"I can't believe this," she hissed, glaring at Malfoy. He had taken the liberty to set up their cauldron and knives.
"Why does Professor Snape give you all of those detentions?" Draco asked Harmony when she walked out the door.
Harmony chewed her bottom lip, unaware that she would make them appear pinker and swollen. He did not stop watching her. She was so tempted to lift her leg and kick him in the chest, but she could not. She could only narrow her eyes in annoyance and fold her arms in front of her chest. "What do you want from me?" she sighed. Why was he doing this, it just didn't make sense. Was this a game to him, to get her angry so then they could fight.
Draco checked his list, cracking up as he put it away. "That is a required course for seventh years." She gave him a pointed stare to continue "SMEX."
"Alright", she said, "do you know what you are wearing on your feet?" Harmony rummaged through her suitcase and pulled out the sandals she used during the summer.
"As a kid, I had a stuffed animal of a muggle toy, called a teddy bear. I guess I thought that it would protect me from the evils in the world, so I used it as my protronus. But now I know what will really protect me," Leighton chuckled a bit, "myself." Nobody doubted that. "A good way to discover your power animal is to meditate, and to really know yourself. Without this knowledge, you may even reject that animal and never acquire your true form. This is a self discovery, and you may not even like the form you take." Leighton smiled a bit, switching his gaze from the girls to Draco for a brief second. "Sometimes you can look at someone and just tell what their animagus form would be." This irked Draco, but he kept his composure.
"What!" Ron turned to the staff table, and sure enough he frowned. "These girls have wonderful specimens of men here, but they have to go and chose teachers, right Harry."
Then he stood up, and double checked his room. It was empty like all the others, all of his things tucked away into the mokeskin pouch in his pocket. He walked casually, in case there were any other students about, in the direction of the owlery.
"Most people haven't seen a dragon close up." Harmony argued, "but you work with dragons in Romania, shouldn't you know better?"
He had been looking over at Harmony, still worrying and checking if she had recovered enough when he first saw it; a speck in the sky. Draco knew as he locked his eyes on it that there was something wrong about that dot of black outlined against the sun struck clouds. It approached and Draco heard whispers around him of "what is that?" and "It's not coming here-is it?" of the restless Slytherins around him.
"Yeah, and so now you'll be freezing your bum off in the bleachers." Ginny carefully halved an apple and placed it on Harmony's plate. "So rooting for Draco?" she whispered. Harmony had a goblet to her mouth and nearly spewed it on Ron's face. Luckily, it only went passed his head.
Draco put one arm around the smaller teen's upper back, and the other under the knees and lifted. Potter was impossibly light, probably weighing less than any girl he knew. It was almost comical that this kid was the savior of all the wizards and witches. Draco even had the courtesy to bring along Potter's possessions as he walked towards Madam Pomfrey's medic wing. He tried not to think of who was in his arms, or of how that someone's head rested against his chest. Potter's pain seemed to have died down, and the boy relaxed into the arms that carried him, as if he never had been held before.
Draco fell asleep with a smile on his face, that when Madam Pomfrey came out made her think of cupids and little angels. She couldn't help but believe that good people came in surprising forms.
"It seems like you guys have mastered the basic healing arts. These will save you in a dire situation. There are more complex spells that trained medi-wizards know. But for now, we will continue with something new, Wizard Dueling. I heard that you got the basic outline two years ago, but I want to build from that. We won't go over the structure of wizard dueling, since most of the time you wont be able to stand around and take turns firing. So everyone knows expelliarmus, right?" Four heads nodded their heads. "Technically wizard dueling never incorporates any physical contact, though I like to throw a good punch whenever I can. It gives the element of surprise, and wizards aren't so used to close range combat, It cuts their reaction time in half and makes them think that they are fighting a mad man. Heck, if you get lucky, and have your opponent in a head lock, or arm lock, then you win." He looked at their unconvinced faces. "Don't tell me you guys don't know any physical combat. Wrestling?" They shook their heads. "You know how to punch right."
Leighton's office door, which happened to be connected to his classroom, burst open from an obvious kick from Leighton whose arms were preoccupied carrying wrapped objects. The last of the student stragglers bounded in and Hermione came along with Neville to sit in a desk in front of Ron and her. "Damn Slytherins cornered him, and shoved him in the girls' loo," Hermione whispered angrily. "Don't know why Dumbledore just cannot separate us entirely-"
Draco walked towards the dungeons and was so preoccupied with his thoughts that he didn't notice Blaise till the boy bumped him aside. "So," Blaise slurred, "it looked like you had a good night." Draco tried to ignore his friend. "You aren't walking her back to Hogsmead?" Blaise laughed, "I thought that you were a gentleman."
"I would think that there should be something to catch us," Harmony said. Three girls began to make their way up, and Harmony watched as they fell like ants before hovering the rest of the way down. "Oh."
"I want to apologize." She looked away from him, and Draco tried not to get discouraged. He barely heard Ginny telling the others to leave, but he didn't miss her warning look. Don't mess this up.
"What is going on here?" Harmony's eyes opened from the familiar voice. She turned her head and Sirius as Padfoot growled on a lease held by an stone stiff Snape.
"What do you think you're doing?" she asked calmly before elbowing him in the stomach. He backed away with a bit of surprise then smirked.
"Dance with me." He held her hands firmer. Harmony then realized that the room looked very much like a dance floor, and she briefly wondered if this was Draco's intention from the beginning. She laughed at how strange and mental he could be, before nodding her head, and bringing a hand to his shoulder.
For a moment she remained still, and Draco didn't know how long he could push away the pain that kept clawing its way to the surface. But then she took a small breath. At the sight of her breathing, Draco let go of some of the control and the tightness in his mind. He suddenly became aware of the forty Death Eaters in the room, his father included, who were watching him.
"I have to go soon," she said, and Draco nodded his head. The party was very much alive, but he wanted it to last, before the dream could fall apart. "You know, in time to beat my house mates back to the dorm."
It was the day after Christmas, and Harmony sauntered down the stairs looking for Ginny. Harmony peered innocently into the kitchen, to see if Ron, or the Really Obnoxious Nuisance, as she started to think of him, was up and about yet. Harmony paused in her train of thinking, and frowned at how vindictive she sounded in her own mind. No. It wasn't as if she hated her former friends now. She didn't even dislike Ron. But if he decided to continue to be a prick about who she wanted to date, then she wasn't going to back down.
"They also have an art studio, but many witches and wizards don't care for such things, with a wand, they could just as easily make anything." She felt it a shame that she hadn't considered anything but Divinations. She wondered why she took that class anyway, probably because of Ron pulling her with him, saying that he needed his afternoon naps.
"I saw it in a dream," Harmony said. It sounded weak even to her ears. "Voldemort and I share a connection," she said and tapped her scar, "that's why Snape is teaching me occlumency."
"What do you want?" Harmony asked and gripped the padded seat. In the few moments that he did not respond, Harmony felt her stomach clench and unease made her blanch.
"So there's a Basilisk tooth somewhere in this bathroom?" Draco looked around him dubiously. "Alright."
"No, no, no," Harmony waved her small hand aimlessly before her, as if she could brush it aside like a cloud, "it's nothing like that."
Draco stepped back into their hotel room to find his father standing over his bag. His father had turned around and silently held out a pair of jeans, touching the material lightly as if they could be contagious.
"I've got a secret, but I need to whisper it to you." He could hear weasel stomping around like a troll.
...More of a reason to spend time with Draco. That would bring the pretty red-head my way when she wants to hang out with Harmony.
"Wait," he yelped, "I can barely walk it hurts." Well it didn't hurt that bad, he just couldn't allow the other students to see him like that; all weak and with purple spots. And he still needed to find out about Potter. He continued to whine a bit more till she grabbed about ten pain killer potions and then forced him out. Draco groaned till she shut the door on his face. That was not what he expected from her. The door locked and a sign of 'temporarily out' printed along the glass plane.
"I think you need some protecting, In fact, I think I should join you," Harmony had her mouth open, hoping that there was still time to reverse Ginny's conviction. "Harmony, don't give me that look, it doesn't work."
Draco didn't feel the hand that grasped the back of his robes, pushing him up. He didn't feel the air as he broke the surface, the sand and shells that grated against his back as he was dragged to shore, or the slaps that hit his face. He felt nothing, like it was all too late. He was on his back, positioned like he was sleeping. Something was hitting his chest, but it was distracting him from his rest. A foreign warmth spread over his body. He wished to be left alone, and hex the person messing with him, but his arms were like lead at his side. Air was being forced into his lungs, but it did nothing for him. It was still black. Then water came up, forced out from his blue lips. Draco's eyes opened wearily, and he turned to his side and threw up water. He hated the beach. He sucked in a grateful breath, but as Draco saw that it was Kingscross who kneeled next to him, a hate consumed him.
"Come on Potter, I'm only teasing, you don't need to get all sensitive." Draco said silkily. She huffed, choosing to ignore his presence. "How about I treat you then?"
Draco pointed to the locket on the ground, and Harmony took in his disheveled appearance. "You did it." She didn't have to ask. Draco offered his hand and pulled her up.
"Oh, so it hasn't started yet." Dumbledore looked troubled, as if he had discovered that the very lost lemon drop in his jaw had dissipated.
It couldn't be real. It was preposterous. He hoped beyond anything that Dumbledore would saunter in and laugh like it was some big joke. But the headmaster didn't come back. It was so unfair, his whole life was one screwed up disaster after another. He wished the tears (he told himself that they were manly tears of anger) that clung to his eyelids would drop dead in their tracks. He could not tell Ron or Hermione about this, at least not yet. They would not understand and he did not want their pity. How could he face the world, with all of its expectations and succeed? He would never be the boy who lived, no girl would date him now, and he was to be a sodding girl!
Draco stared at the man who laid crumpled at his father's feet. Half the man's face was unrecognizable, but Draco knew him from the posters in his third year. Sirius Black, the only man to break out of Azkaban. He could easily recall the man's haunted eyes, that hollow gaze.
"So that is why he is acting so rashly," Severus said, trying not imagine Voldemort as a woman. "But why did he break into the Ministry of Magic?"
"My mum. I saw her when I was dead." Harmony replied. Snape searched her eyes, and Harmony didn't even try to block him out. The image of her mother at Kings Cross and the words he was the best friend I ever had flitted through her mind.
"Of course Big D." She was falling fast and her broom slipped uselessly from her grasp. There was no stopping from the deathly maw of the dragon, no golden prize to celebrate, but this death was worse than Dudley hitting on her. She was not petrified of this creature as she surrendered her very self to it. She could only close her eyes to hide from the dragon's stormy orbs.
"You're trailing blood," Snape remarked. "Sit down." Draco had no choice but to lean against the wall as the man scrutinized his ankle. He had forgotten about his leg. Draco rolled up his pants from his ankle, and looked away from the tender mess. He didn't complain as Snape took a wand to it and bandages wrapped in tight circles around his leg. Snape helped him from the floor and steadied Draco.
Several eyes followed her as she made for Ron and Hermione. She hoped that the students wouldn't be able to see through her disguise. She knew that Professor McGonagall and Snape were eyeing her as she plopped down with Ron.
"Ah," Voldemort exhaled, his wet fingers caressing a newly formed nose. Voldemort stroked the blond hair that now streamed across his head.
Harmony tiptoed to the Defense Against the Dark Arts room, ten minutes earlier than scheduled. With her wand in hand and Ginny to her back, she allowed the magic to drop from her face. Harmony didn't question the other girl trailing behind, Luna must have been the backup. She motioned the two to stop. Under her breath she silenced the door and cast an unlocking spell. She thus kicked the door with a firm leg, and peered inside. The three formed a triangle, facing different directions.
"Those?" the old wizard scratched at the white whips at his balding head, "have been in my shop since I first opened here 80 years back." He slightly frowned as old memories glittered in his head. "Ah," he said at last and reached inside to bring the two old rings out, "these are a pair of magic rings, and when they are worn by two people, they show how the other is faring. I believe that they still work." Harmony could see the magic there as it absorbed some of the old man's magic. "Funny," he muttered to himself, "haven't seen these for awhile now."
"Do you know who I am?" Harry brought her hand to her face and felt the lack of her glasses. Damn it, she thought, Damn, Damn! She sat up and Dudley's gang stepped back a bit to give their boss ample time to show off his impressive figure. Dudley was still a vast ocean, and his 'new' found talent at boxing only gave his normally rotund body a massive look.
"Yes," he said and took her hand, "that has been my wish for a very long time." Harmony bit her bottom lip, this could not be happening. He led her to the cold of the night, and that single contact of his hand made her forget her anxiety. That was till she realized that holding his hand was precisely what she was not supposed to do.
She stuffed the other dresses in her suitcase and laid the silver dress on her bed. She was at a loss of what to do now. Harmony had taken a shower, and had towel dried her hair. She wasn't sure if she should have done anything more with the unruly locks. The dance was in two hours and Harmony had thought that she would have plenty time. She looked at the time and fretted. It had been so easy as a guy! All she had to do was change, and then wa la!
"Change into your animagus form," said a cool voice from beyond the little door. Harmony banged her head in surprise, getting dust into her hair.
"What was he doing here?" she asked, and saw that Harmony's blush had not left. "Harry!" She said none too lightly and then began to whisper in her ear, "did you change in front of him?"
"I was doing detentions with Snape before the party, and then I just got too tired to go," Harmony said.
Harmony sat atop her bed, focusing her mind to enable her face to change at will. The whole process was frustrating, especially in a room filled with snoring boys. She wrapped herself in a thin blanket, in case someone was to peek over and see her not so male face. Her breathing came out deep and regular. Her mind filled with the picture of Harry Potter, and her desire for it. With her eyes still closed she brought a hand up to the planes of her face and marveled at the slight differences. She felt the warmth from the magic, a slight trickle coursing through her veins. Her skin began to cool, and she went over to a window to catch a glimpse of herself.
"I don't know, it just popped up as I was going around the halls back and forth, wondering what I wanted."
"Kreacher. What is this?" Harmony asked and brought it closer to her face. The locket was made of a heavy gold with a snake in the center in a serpentine S.
"I think so, Harry must have won," Luna said. Ginny could see as behind them her brothers started up a cheer that spread throughout the hall, yelling, Potter! Potter!
"Yeah, I wanted to give it to you. It's been in my family for ages, and it's said that dragon's blood or poison is at the center, I forget which. It's important to me so keep it close." They stood in front of the Great Hall, which was decorated with hearts and red ribbons. "Ready?" he asked. She took a deep breath and chuckled to herself. "Because we could still have our own party," he smirked.
At three flights down, Harmony was led to the language labs, where foreign tongues could be learned. She followed close behind him, not straying too far or spending too long at any one classroom. "The last courses at this time are a free period study or a life management class." She frowned at her options and at the fact that Draco had stressed the life management course.
As if Harmony's life wasn't complicated enough. The past fourteen years of life as a boy was relatively simple. But ever since that psycho-murderer Voldemort stole her blood, and she became a girl, everything changed. How was she supposed to like girls after that? How could she ever be with a man? She scoffed at that. No one would want her.
"What the, Malfoy get your hands off me." He spun her so fast Harmony fell against his chest. Her eyes traveled to what should have been his face, but she saw nothing. She didn't need to. "Let go," she lowered her voice, her arms were trapped.
"Er. Thanks?" Harmony stood up and the weasley twins leaned against each other. "I'll see you guys around," Harmony said. Before she made it to her room, Ginny pulled her aside.
"What is that class?" Harmony asked pointing to one with a curtain draped over a small window on the door.
Draco considered the offer, and nodded, turning to Ginny and saying, "could you take the first years back to Hogwarts?" The red haired girl hesitated to leave Harmony, but agreed, grabbing the hands of a set of kids and running down the halls with them, with Luna at her tail.
"Draco!" Harmony reprimanded, joining Ginny and Leighton. "He is a friend and is helping me with extra lessons to defeat Voldemort. This has nothing to do with you."
Obviously if they are inviting me to go with them, they are trying to trick me. He thought. Oh this relationship drama is so much more fun than school. It's absolutely ridiculous, Potter-who apart from Crabbe and Goyle is the least attractive boy in our entire year, what with those ridiculous glasses and the fact that he stands only at the height of a third year-makes the hottest girl in the school. She has got to be a solid ten, with that perfect figure, gorgeous face, and bright green eyes. She's a powerful witch too, evaded a dragon and the Dark Lord. And she's not a bitch. It sucks. All the Slytherin girls are either already dating someone or they are complete bitches.
Harmony stretched her body, knowing that she had Magical Fitness class soon. They were going rock climbing today and had the wall transfigured into a cliff side. At least it was something that she could take her mind off of Draco.
"He!" Kreacher spat while pointing a crooked finger at Fletcher, "has been stealing from the dead Master and Mistress since a week ago, and I saw him in my cupboard. He has it, I know he does!" Harmony would not have cared about the fact that the man was stealing from the house, but the way that Kreacher seemed almost desperate and wild made Harmony really look at Kreacher. "Give it back!"
Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs dragged their feet up the spire, circlig their way to the large blue door. Harmony's nose crinkled at the smells of overwhelming lavender, pine, sea foam, passion fruits, and a sugary too sweet sent that mixed and wafted, permeating through her skull, and causing an onslaught of a migraine. The door had not even opened yet.
"Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus." Harmony replied, quoting the motto of Hogwarts. "Dragons are beautiful, free, and people don't mess with them. That's why."
"The shirt you're wearing now looks like it belongs to a whale, want one of mine?" Draco held out a black shirt, and Harmony took it with a slight hesitation.
Harry awoke disoriented, hungry, and in need to use the loo. He hadn't been up since the previous day and he blinked slowly up at Dumbedore and Snape. He saw Dumbledor's eyes twinkling, and Snape's pale face was even more ashen and took on the look of a goldfish out of its tank. Harry rubbed his emerald eyes and could barely think straight.
"Must have been those nasty Gryffindors, right Crabbe?" He knew that cutting voice was his dear and faithful Professor Snape.
Draco reached from behind her, and twisted the knob. "When the house is under attack, a lot of the doors will lock down, and only a Malfoy can get through." They left the cellar open, and Draco and Harmony turned into animals just as two death eaters passed. Though it wasn't the most brave thing to do, Harmony reverted to a girl and shot them in the backs with stunning spells.
"I think he's right," Luna said, "she could use our help now." Ginny scowled at Draco before turning the knob.
Things had changed greatly in the Malfoy Manner. Severus looked around the once glamorous mansion. The place was in disarray, but with good reason. The Dark Lord glared at Severus, his red eyes like a rat's. "What took you so long?" Voldemort asked, his voice cracking.
"Only to muggles," Theodore smirked, "this curse only produces the symptoms and will disappear in a day or two."
All around the room were traps, pits to fall into, collapsing walls, oiled floors, and blinding lights; many of which Draco had set up. He kept a sharp eye for the others, while still managing to be concealed. There. To his left he could see the silhouette of a girl tip toeing away from him. Draco acted at once, slinking her way. Each step he took was sure footed and light, like that of a small animal scampering across a room. It wasn't until he was nearly five feet away that he stopped and melted with the black wall, it was a good thing for him too, as the girl came to a halt and looked back over her shoulder. They stayed motionless, she straining her eyes into darkness, and him staring at her. When she thought it clear she moved, and he followed behind her like a shadow, nearly touching her. Draco latched his hand to the back of her shoulder, bringing his wand to her throat. "Got you," he said with uncontrollable glee. The girl's head twisted painfully to the right, as far from the wand pointed to her neck. Draco smelled jasmine, it thrilled him. 'You are mine,' was at the tip of his tongue.
"Ron," Harmony said in a low voice, "you are really asking for it. Stop behaving like such an insufferable prat." She pulled out her wand and faced him.
"Goyle, Crabbe, I need you to do something for me, do you think you can?" Both of their heads bobbled yes. "I need you to hit me with-." A second passed as Crabbe wondered what that meant. Goyle though knew what hit meant and decided to act on his instincts. His fist collided with Draco's jaw. He went down immediately.
"What ever is the matter, boy?" Trelawny asked and took a step back. Students were enraptured by the now very exciting drama.
"The back of the house," Dobby said, "near the china room and trophy room." Draco lifted a corner of the cloak over his head, and Harmony almost pulled him back, but stopped as the others did the same.
"Leave NOW! All of you!" Voldemort shouted. "Find the intruders!" They flattened themselves against the wall, and watched as Death Eaters were driven out of the room. Her eyes turned to slits when she saw Snape among them.
