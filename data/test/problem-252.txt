Now he couldn't concentrate. His brain kept wandering off to things he didn't want to be thinking about. His eyes slid over to stare at the blonde head a couple of rows in front of him. He idly wondered if Malfoy had ever dated anyone before. Bad brain. He dragged his mind back to the very boring History of Magic lesson he was supposed to be paying attention to. Like he cared about the names of each and every Vampire coven in the 1500s. Only Hermione was paying any attention at all to Binns, scribbling away furiously on a sheet of parchment.
He slipped between the trees and journeyed far enough into the forest that no one could immediately spot him from the edge. He stopped when he reached his favorite clearing.
Harry quickly shut the door behind them. He barely had time to turn around before he was pinned to the wall by Draco. Rather impressive, really, considering he was still invisible. Their position was very awkward. His left arm was stuck behind his back, and his right was held down by Draco's hand. Draco's body was slightly skewed to the side, and he was glaring a few inches to the left of where Harry's eyes were. The blond smelled like wind and the night air.
——————————————————
This was why Harry was confused. And as he did when faced with a particularly challenging problem, he paced. Back and forth and back and forth, he walked. Ron watched him like he was a quaffle being passed from one chaser to another. "Mate," Ron said. Harry ignored him. "Mate," Ron tried again. "Harry. Harry Potter. The Chosen One. The Boy Who Lived Twice. Savior of the Wiz-." "What do you want?" Harry interrupted him. "Knew you would respond to one of those. Didn't know you were so conceited, mate." Ron grinned at him. Harry glared. "I didn't know you knew what 'conceited' meant, Ron." Harry shot back. Ron's smile grew wider.
"She is the woman you saw earlier, the one who screamed at you," the headmistress answered, looking faintly amused. Harry nodded. "Right," he said, mind already returned to the problem of Draco.
Three cheers to Potter
Draco got the feeling if "he" didn't come back, his "father" would force him to. Draco was sure he would at least have some very compelling reasons. Actually, this was sounding remarkably like Lucius.
The blond murmured something inaudible. Harry hardly dared to interrupt, but he had to ask him to repeat it louder.
Lastly, magpies are best known for their thievery of shiny objects. They covet valuables - gold, silver, jewelry - and only the brightest things capture their attention.
Harry's jaw was practically sitting on the table next to his untouched breakfast.
"So, he doesn't have a girlfriend?" He asked to make sure. Pansy nodded. Hope glimmered across his face before Draco's shoulders slumped. "That doesn't mean anything, Pansy. Maybe he just found that gingers weren't his type after all." Pansy shrugged.
They had stayed in the "safe house" for two weeks, awaiting their trial. And the day had finally come. Draco had had a lot of time to think it over, and he had decided that he would go to Azkaban with the dignity and honor befitting a wizarding family belonging to the Sacred Twenty Eight. He was ready to go to prison. Of course, it was much easier said than done. Sitting in the holding cell, he was terrified. He imagined what it would be like to hear the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, who would be trying them himself (he had no idea who it was) declare him guilty. He imagined what it would be like to be dragged off by Aurors while crowds booed and cursed at him. He imagined what it would be like to sit in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by dementors and wallowing in his own terrifying nightmares. He was not ready to go to prison.
Harry nodded shyly. "I had a dream. About you," he revealed. Draco's eyes widened. "Tell me," he demanded immediately.
It was the mudblo- Granger. He would have to get used to that. He quickly looked around for that god-awful hair, because if Granger was there, then the Weasel and Potter would be there too. Draco told himself he only wanted to see Potter to thank him for the trial. Not to confirm that what Pansy had said was true. He almost convinced himself. Almost.
Pansy gave him an odd look. "Alright, Draco. Anything to do with your darling mother is always a passable excuse. But-" she gained a devious look, "what's this I hear about Potter showing up at your trial? Did he really speak in your defense?"
Harry grabbed Draco's hand and squeezed it, swooping in to plant a kiss on his cheek. "Good morning, love," he said softly, not wanting to break him out his reverie.
"You what?" Draco prodded.
Draco shifted in discomfort at the casual way Potter mentioned his death and noticed several others do the same. He was proving himself to be more and more Slytherin by the minute. He nonchalantly reminded them of the debt they all owed to Potter for saving the world. And by remarking on how he came back to life and defeated the Dark Lord, Potter subtly reminded them that he was, in fact, the most powerful wizard of their time and that it would be quite unwise to cross him. Draco was impressed, very impressed. He couldn't have conducted this better. He reminded himself to confront his mother about this later, though. He glanced at his mother again, and her face was impassive, not a hint of anything that could have disproved Potter's words showed itself.
Draco smiled at that. "I'm glad," he spoke softly, "Mother is my entire family, now. I could want for nothing more than my two worlds getting along."
Harry turned back to their friends, who were having one loud discussion about Hogsmeade and whether or not Honeydukes was planning to buy the store next door so they could expand. He smiled and listened quietly, content to sit there and let the conversation flow around him.
Harry grabbed his cloak and map, muttering the words he knew would activate the clever spell his father and his friends had wrought on the parchment. As the lines of ink smoothly appeared, he hurried through the hall and empty common room, slipping out with a familiarity born of routine.
Unlike Draco earlier, Harry was still looking at his face, and so he was subjected to the full force of the boy's endless beguiling charms. In a move that the girls who once tried to flirt with him used, the blond looked down, then back up at Harry through his impossibly long eyelashes. He looked coy and almost shy, pulling off the move better than those girls ever had. Harry was entranced.
"Look, you two. I know Snape and McGonagall were the only two to assign us homework, but you mustn't slack off! Come, let's get to work on our Transfiguration essay."
Since the Plan to Make Their Relationship Public, as they were calling it, Draco and Harry, and occasionally their friends, had taken to sitting at each other's tables during mealtimes. Today, it was Gryffindor.
When Harry drifted back to consciousness, the first thing he noticed was that he had not had a nightmare. This was probably the first time in months that he hadn't been plagued by images from the war. He felt so very relaxed and snuggled into the warmth that was surrounding him.
He was caught up in thoughts of class, numerous essays that were nearing their due dates, Draco, Quidditch, what Draco was doing last night, the Charms project, Draco kissing him, Draco this morning as they agreed to trust each other, Draco kissing him this morning, Draco, Draco, Draco, Draco...
He nearly sprinted to the forest, but his patrician upbringing simply would not allow something as undignified as running. He speedwalked. Gracefully, of course.
Draco swallowed and began examining the wall. It was a nice wall, all sturdy and supportive. At least the ceiling wasn't going to fall on him anytime soon. Shame, that.
"I think I'd rather tell your mom in person," Harry admitted. "She'll probably want to hear it directly from you, not in a letter," he added.
Ron shrugged. "Worth a shot. If she doesn't agree, we could always pay a visit to old Lockhart. I know if I had a dream about the ferret face, I wouldn't stop at Obliviating." He made a face. "Bloody good job he wasn't here when I came in. He would have had a heart attack!"
"That was unexpected," Draco mused. "I didn't know either of them were into boys. Quite an interesting development. What do you think?"
She glided to Draco and embraced him, holding him like he was still a small child. "My darling, you mustn't do that again," she chided him gently. "You cannot imagine how much I despaired of your absence."
"Parkinson?" Harry asked. Zabini looked annoyed by his question. "She's tending the bar and can't leave. And before you ask, Bulstrode is currently snogging some Ravenclaw guy, Nott is throwing his guts up in the bathroom, Goldstein never came, and Weasley is off somewhere with Granger doing who knows what."
Draco felt about twelve again under the powerful, scrutinizing gaze of the Malfoy patriarch, as he always had.
Harry lurched to his feet, the long table the only thing separating him from the spot from which Draco had disappeared. Hysteria clawed up his throat, threatening to render him useless in his panic. But no, he had to stay calm. He had to. For Draco.
"Hey!" Harry said loudly. "Don't, Draco. He knows who you are. He just doesn't think you bear the guilt for his brother's death." Draco raised his head, starting to say something, but Harry cut him off instantly. "No, he genuinely doesn't blame you. And-" Harry pinned him with an intense, emerald gaze, "If he doesn't, you definitely can't blame yourself." Draco lowered his head again. Suddenly, it was just too heavy to hold up, his guilt weighing him down and thoughts pulling him deeper into misery. Then those green, green eyes were right in front of him, looking up as Harry knelt on the floor. "Draco," he whispered. "It's alright. Please don't let this ruin today. I forgot about Aberforth, but even if I hadn't, I would have brought you here. You need to see that even Dumbledore's brother doesn't dislike you."
Draco eyed the potion apprehensively. With a shrug, Potter uncorked the vial and took a sip, making a face at the taste. He passed it to Draco, who did the same. The turned to each other, waiting for something to happen. Then, with a flurry of motion, a reindeer stood in Harry's place. The deer stomped its hoof and swung its head around in confusion. But Draco had very little time to take this in before an extremely odd feeling danced across his skin, from the top of his head to the tips of his fingers all the way down to the bottom of his feet. And then he blinked, and he was suddenly much closer to the ground, the reindeer towering over him. He tried to yell, but instead, what came out was a jet of flame. He recoiled in shock. Then it dawned on him what form he had taken. He should have known. 'Draco.' It was even in his name. He stretched out his...arm? Sure enough, he saw a wing instead. He squawked in excitement and began to flap his wings. It was supremely awkward, and he moved his wings even faster in an attempt to fly. Finally, he felt himself growing lighter, and his claws lifted off of the ground and-
As Harry stepped under the steaming water, he felt his muscles loosen. He sighed in contentment. He took far longer than necessary, but he felt like he deserved to be a little selfish. When he turned the water off, he walked out of the shower only to realize he had forgotten to bring a change of clothes. Damn. Harry wrapped his towel around his waist and poked his head out of the en-suite bathroom. He was surprised to see that the room was still empty. Feeling much less uncomfortable, he walked out and over to his trunk. But as he was about to lean down to grab some pajamas, he felt a draft of cold air on his still-damp skin. Harry turned, startled.
"Are you kidding? I'm more concerned about the 'Ickle Baby' part of it." Draco scrunched his nose with distaste. "Though hearing him calling you Potty was most certainly worth it."
A small child was clapping and pointing at him. The mother looked flabbergasted. "Oh my, it really is a dragon," she breathed. The woman pulled out a flat rectangular box sort of thing, tapped at it a bit, and suddenly, a bright light briefly blinded him. Then, she tapped it a bit more and held it to her ear.
"Of course," Draco immediately assured her. "It's nothing like that. I happen to find magical theory fascinating, and I was in the process of reading that particular book. I would quite like to be able to finish it," he said, reciting his cover story.
"I know Harry, but that doesn't mean that it's okay for you to keep suffering. Have you tried Dreamless Sleep?" She asked, already looking for solutions to his issue. He was infinitely grateful to have her as his friend. He nodded. "I've tried Dreamless Sleep. And just about every muggle method too. Nothing works." He said, a bit despairingly.
The second thing he noticed was that his head was stuffy like he had been crying. Then he remembered that he had been crying. He almost cringed at the memory of being so helpless in front of Draco, but the warmth soothed him back into his relaxed state. He drifted for a while, content to lay there in a half-asleep state.
"Since when have I ever listened to the public? If I did, I would spend half my life trying to please people, and I would never have defeated Voldemort. And I doubt I will ever grow tired of you, Draco if I haven't gotten any less obsessed with you in seven years." Harry took a deep breath. "How about- how about we make a deal?" He asked, licking his lips nervously. Draco tilted his head, raising his eyebrows in question, and avoiding going down the path staring at the brunet's mouth would lead to. Harry took this as a sign to continue. "Let's both agree to trust and believe each other. And, if either of us wants to...wants to stop this, we agree to tell the other immediately. Does that sound okay?" He rushed out, unsure. Draco smiled. The brunet was so endearing and adorable that his heart began to beat erratically. "Such a Gryffindor," he remarked affectionately. "Alright, I'll promise you that."
"Toenails of the Ogre, please."
"Then we'll have to search manually. There's little we can do for magical kidnappings, especially when done with a Portkey - an illegal one, at that - which doesn't leave a magical trace. Unless we can get in contact with your Mr. Malfoy, there's little chance of finding him." Wilson had the decency to look slightly regretful of that fact.
Draco, unfortunately, was not allowed to go to Hogwarts immediately. Instead, he was dragged off to the Auror department, Weasley insisting on tagging along. There, he was interrogated about where he had been, what had happened, who his kidnapper was, and how he had escaped. Draco answered each question thoroughly but quickly grew bored.
"Nothing," Draco said, and his fingers twitched imperceptibly. Harry narrowed his eyes. He hadn't even talked to Draco since the previous day, what could have gone wrong in such a small amount of time? Luckily, Parkinson pursued the matter for him: "You know you'll feel better if you tell me. I can assure you that you're simply overthinking the matter, whatever it is."
Thankfully, a loud group of Ravenclaws came in, chattering excitedly. Since Pansy was busy with helping Granger, he played the part of the host, graciously welcoming the group and directing them to the food. About ten minutes later, nearly their whole year was there, along with a few of the 7th years who had been specially invited. People filled the room, lounging around on the seating area provided. Whenever the chairs and beanbags got full, more popped up out of thin air, thanks to the room's magic.
Harry stared at the parchment, his eyes idly tracking the Grey Lady as she wandered along the fourth floor. "Probably confiscated it from my dad or Sirius. They made it, along with Remus and Peter Pettigrew."
The thing that finally brought him back was a loud knock on the door. It reverberated through the entire room, interrupting the proceedings and causing the prosecutor to fall silent for a few seconds before he loudly cleared his throat and continued. A few seconds later, the knock came again, louder. The lawyer visibly grew annoyed but spoke over the disruption. This time, it was a series of knocks. The angry man kept reading, his voice growing louder with each knock. Then, silence. And finally, with a thunderous bang that made the previous knocks seem only as loud as whispers, the door flew off its hinges to reveal Harry Potter, his hands flung wide and no wand or guardsmen in sight.
Draco stared at it. "How in Merlin's name are we meant to give it the flobberworms? They're thrice as large as that thing's mouth!"
Harry didn't need to think at all. "I'm coming," he said firmly.
When everyone had filtered into the Great Hall, the Sorting began. The hat sang some nonsense about unity and acceptance before the first years were called up one by one to be sorted. Draco smiled widely every time one of them was placed in Slytherin, though he noticed no one from the other houses looked pleased. Once every first year had been sorted, and the students had settled down, Professor - no, Headmistress McGonagall rose and began her speech.
He smiled, feeling content and at peace. The imagery had always helped to calm him when his "brain was full," as Pansy crudely called it. It allowed him to sort through the mess, clearing his mind for once. The technique had been invaluable when the Dark Lord had taken up residence in his house. It somehow allowed him to get around the paradox of trying not to think about something, only to have it inevitably crop up at the most inopportune moment. If he shelved it away, it wouldn't bother him again.
Draco took a deep breath. Facing his father - real or scarily accurate alternate version of him - would always be an ordeal. If this man were anything like Lucius, as he seemed to be thus far, Draco was in for one hell of a tongue-lashing.
He turned on the water, sticking his hand underneath to test the temperature. When it was pleasantly warm, he stripped and stepped under the pounding spray. He sighed as the warm water ran over his body, soothing his muscles. He took his time washing his hair, hoping his problem would go away. When it didn't, he quickly used soap to clean his body so he could take care of it faster.
That seemed simple enough. He read the next line.
Harry skipped the trick step he knew was there. One learned such intricacies of the castle after sneaking around it so long. However, the trick step was not where it should have been. His foot went through the stair below the one he stepped over, and he nearly lost his balance. He would have fallen quite far if Draco hadn't been there, but he managed to catch him just in time.
Draco choked, both at the vulgar implication and intentional pun. He glared at the smug girl. "No, Pansy, we're just friends. Harry doesn't swing that way, you know that." Pansy gave him an appraising look. "I'm not so sure about that anymore," she murmured, causing Draco to stop dead.
"Sounds like they were amazing friends," Draco commented. Harry's eyes lit up with something that couldn't be described as anything other than pride and love. It left Draco breathless with wonder. "They were," he agreed. "I told you how they became animagi for Moony - that's the level of dedication they had towards their friendship. They were never anything less than the best of friends - Wormtail aside," Harry noted darkly. "I remember during some of my detentions, I had to update the detention slips from past Hogwarts students. The four of them featured far too often, even more than you, me, all of Gryffindor, and the Weasley twins combined. They were always getting into trouble with each other and..." Draco could listen to Harry go on forever about his dad and his friends. The brunet adopted a fond but exasperated tone, and his eyes shone with such pure emotions that it made Draco want to smile.
With that, Harry was satisfied and sent it off with an owl. Punctual as ever, Hermione knocked at the door and came in with a small stack of books. Some were more general transfiguration books, others were instructive, and the rest were highly specific research papers on a precise area of animagi, she informed him.
"Well, that's not all that bad," she said briskly. "Honestly, Harry, people have dreams like that all the time. It's completely normal."
Dear Mr. Potter,
"You're quite a pretty thing, aren't you? You probably don't have to worry about magical nonsense. Hell, you've probably never seen magic before. You want to see?" Draco tugged his wand out of his pocket, casting a simple charm to conjure a puff of smoke. The avian looked alarmed for a second, and Draco stupidly realized that smoke in nature often meant fire and danger. But this bird was curious, and after a moment, it pecked at the wand. He smiled fondly at it.
Harry had reached a decision.
They walked all the way down to the common room together, chatting and laughing about whatever popped up in their conversation. When they reached the common room, Harry was accosted by some very bushy, brown hair.
Harry woke up in a cold sweat, breathing hard. He sat up and buried his face into his hands, close to tears. He had never cried from a dream before, and this was the closest he would ever allow himself to get. If he cried, the nightmares would be given more power—the power to break him beyond repair.
"You're not a real dragon, are you?" a voice interrupted his nap. Draco's eyes flew open, and he growled an instinctive warning. A shock of bright red hair was floating on a broom. Of course, it's a Weasley, Draco thought, disgruntled. Draco raised his head and awkwardly nodded in affirmation. There was no use pretending with a wizard.
"Is something wrong?" Worry was evident on the Gryffindor's face. Even after so long, and so much, he still wore his heart on his sleeve.
"This way is the boy's dormitories. On the left are the girl's dorms. Under no circumstances will you be allowed to switch. Each room will have four inhabitants, and I expect you all to get along. You must set an example for your younger peers." She looked at them severely over her glasses. "Since you are responsible adults, you do not have a curfew. However, I expect that you will not be running about the halls making noise and disturbing the other students after their curfew. If this becomes an issue, your privilege will be revoked. You may have 7th and 6th years in your common room, but they must adhere to their curfew and will not be allowed to sleep over here. Do I make myself clear?"
——————————————————
Keep an eye out for my next work! It's dreary, and the first two chapters are already up!
There was no other option but to stay a dragon and continue flying without knowing his course. He had to come across Wizards eventually, right?
"Potter!" A voice shouted loudly in his ear. Harry winced. He managed to extricate himself from a very clingy Malfoy, who was prattling on about random things. When he finally managed to get Malfoy to let go, he heard him say,
Their second kiss was even better. Their third was by far the best. And their fourth made Draco rethink his previous sentiment.
Draco turned back to the conversation, smirking, only to see everyone staring at him. "What?" He asked.
Draco gasped. "Your dad made this? And the werewolf and Black? And Wormtail? But this is seriously complicated magic, at least the level of some of the lesser Charms Masters. There is no way they made this in school!"
Harry blushed at the last comment but resolutely began pushing his way through the crowd. People, including Ministry workers, he was surprised to see, were craning their necks for a glimpse at him. Reporters were shoving their Quick-Quotes Quills in his face.
Narcissa looked a little taken aback, but acquiesced easily enough. She directed him to Draco's room and left, presumably to put the pie under preserving charms.
Opening his eyes, he felt his limbs tremble. Wilson was standing next to a strange, beautiful woman, who was tightly bound with Incarcerous. Harry struggled to a sitting position, and words finally started to make sense to him.
The next morning, Draco made his way down to breakfast as usual. The Great Hall was nearly full, close to its peak capacity. As he sat down next to Pansy, his eyes immediately sought out the boy at the Gryffindor table, who was predictably not there. It would be a miracle if the messy git ever managed to show up on time. His daily Potter-check-in done for the morning, he turned back to his plate and began filling it up.
Harry cleared his throat. "Never mind that. I, er, I have something to tell you guys." Hermione, bless her, immediately guessed that it was something private. She nodded firmly. "Pansy owes me for last time she wanted to talk to Malfoy. We can go to my room."
————————————————————————
"I've just remembered, I, er, I was supposed to, er...meet Hermione! Yeah, I was supposed to go talk to her about something, but I completely forgot, so I hope you'll excuse me for leaving so suddenly..." Harry rambled, not meeting his eyes. The boy rushed out of the library, shouting a "thank you" back at Draco. Madam Pince glared at him, but since he was already leaving, there was nothing she could do. Draco sat at the table, dazed and alone, as he wondered why the hell he had decided to listen to Pansy.
"I wanted to ask you, well- I wanted to ask...er," Harry stammered, unsure how to word his question.
Harry smiled uncomfortably. "Yeah. Thanks, I guess. I'll try to get over it quickly. You shouldn't have to suffer for my problems. I just...need some space for a bit. Just give me some time." Draco looked slightly disappointed but agreed. Just as Harry was about to leave, Draco said in a small voice, "Harry? We'll be okay, right?"
"I don't believe you," Draco said unhappily, and it sounded like he thought it was true.
Harry turned around because he could not stand to look at Draco any longer. He still wasn't fully awake; drowsiness weighed heavily on his mind. He felt no desire to get up, especially since Draco would likely be awoken by movement. Harry wanted him to stay asleep if only so they could remain like this a while longer.
Potter looked outraged but wisely did not say anything. This was the best outcome Draco could have hoped for. His mother was free. She could enjoy her life without constraints. He didn't care if he was declared guilty; this was enough for him.
Draco didn't look at Harry. Instead, he focussed all his attention on the paragraph Harry had written. He had to read it a few times to comprehend it, but at least it gave him a chance to settle down.
"Go to sleep, Malfoy," past-Harry told past-Draco quietly. Then he left, escaping to the bathroom, and Draco barely took in his flushed, wild-eyed state before he felt the memory fading away.
————————————————————————
"Oof," he said.
Luckily, it seemed that Draco had either forgotten or had chosen to ignore the incident in the library. Harry was still shaken. He had wanted to kiss Draco so badly right then. It almost seemed like Draco had wanted to kiss him too, but then Harry remembered that Pansy had told Draco to find another guy to help get rid of his crush. He felt sick. Was Draco just using him to get over someone else? He was suddenly glad that Madam Pince had yelled at those 4th years because it had stopped Harry from kissing Draco. It had to have been Harry that was leaning in because Draco would never have tried to kiss Harry first.
Pansy's voice drew his attention away from where it had once again wandered to Potter. He looked back and saw that Potter was indeed looking at him with an uncomfortable expression. Draco looked away.
He shrugged. "Nothing ever means nothing when it comes to you and Potter." Pansy had an evil smirk on her face. Draco stared at Blaise, not entirely understanding what he meant.
"I hadn't seen you since the day before, and it felt like you were avoiding me," Draco clarified.
————————————————————————
Draco panicked. He had to get Potter to the Hospital wing, preferably without anyone seeing them. It would look very suspicious if a former Death Eater was dragging along an unconscious Harry Potter. He cast a disillusionment charm on Potter's unmoving body, and then quietly whispered, "Mobilicorpus." Potter's body lifted off of the ground, and Draco set a brisk pace towards the Hospital Wing. He wanted to run there, but it would look strange if he was in too much of a hurry.
"So..." Harry began, unsure of how to start this conversation. Draco did not offer him any assistance, leaving him to flounder in silence. "Erm...Do you want to go outside?"
"So, Potter, in the interest of regaining my title, I just have to know. Are you dating anyone else? Is she an 8th year, a 7th year? Younger?" Then it seemed like Parkinson was looking directly into his soul. "Or could it be that the person you're dating is not a she, but a he?"
Only moments later, they broke apart again, both panting and flushed with pleasure.
"Not yet," Paul argued.
Draco rolled his eyes in annoyance. "Of course not. It would reflect badly on me as your potions partner if I let you turn in this monstrosity. Try again." Harry gave him a grateful smile and went back to work. It wasn't long before Harry started to get the hang of it. Now that he didn't have to be watching for mistakes so much, Draco was free to let his mind wander. He suddenly remembered something. Flirting.
Sometime during Pansy's speech, Blaise had sat down and, quickly catching on, proceeded to ignore Pansy and Draco. He, too, looked far nicer than usual, so much so that Draco eventually asked whom he was planning on going to Hogsmeade with and if they happened to be a certain Gryffindor boy whose name began with "L" and ended with "ongbottom."
"And that is why you were avoiding me today?" Draco clarified again. "Not avoided," Harry corrected. "Just waiting for a chance to get you alone. Who knew so many people would vie for your attention?"
"Well, of course I'm thinking about Draco, now that you two have brought him up," Harry protested. "That doesn't mean I was before." His friends shared a glance. "But were you?" Hermione asked.
He turned to Draco. "We're idiots for not thinking of that," he stated. Draco glared at him, a smudge of jam on his lip. "You're the idiot," he countered. "It was your plan. Actually, now that I'm not half-asleep, it was entirely your fault Peeves saw us. You had your cloak, you dimwit, and you didn't even think to-"
Draco gently angled his body downwards, slowly approaching the ground. As he neared it, he panicked a little bit and alighted awkwardly, folding his wings slightly too late for any semblance of gracefulness. Regardless, he could rest and take an hour to recover. Still, the problem of navigating his way back to Hogwarts remained, and he had no idea what he could do. Eventually, after he sat and contemplated his options for a while, he discerned that Apparating to Hogsmeade would be the fastest route, and Draco was glad he thought of it.
Harry adopted a thoughtful expression. "Well, yes, but they're much more infrequent than they used to be. It's only every three of four days as opposed to nearly every night."
"Pans," he greeted simply.
Harry waited patiently, perfectly content to take the chance to let his eyes roam over Draco's gorgeous face.
"You'll think it's foolish," he argued weakly. "I don't doubt that," Draco agreed, "but how about you let me decide for myself?"
"I think you won't know until you try," she told him carefully. "You're already friends with him, that's a step in the right direction. Just try flirting with him or something, see how he reacts." Draco nodded, now feeling reassured.
"I have to go do something. I'll meet you guys in Charms class, alright?" Without waiting for an answer, Harry got up and hurried out of the Great Hall, making sure not to lose Malfoy. He followed the blonde head down a corridor and up some stairs. The Slytherin went around a corner and-
Harry nodded again, gratefully this time. He opened his mouth, and when no protest was forthcoming, he said, "I'll go write that letter, then. Could you bring the books to my dorm?"
Once, early on, Charlie mentioned how Draco's animagus form was almost more beautiful than those of actual dragons, but the others were quick to change the subject. Harry even noticed Bill taking him aside to whisper something a few minutes later, and he knew their topic of conversation when they both glanced at him surreptitiously.
Second, I have been informed of your recent friendship with my son, Draco. I must also thank you for this. You would have been within your rights to resent us, to resent him, but words are not enough to tell you how much I am glad you do not. If I may, I have a favor to ask of you.
Pansy followed through on her offer, handling her roommates with surprising skill. They spent the rest of the evening gossiping about nearly everyone (except Potter, he was a forbidden topic), and looking through various magazines, pointing out different articles and clothes for the others to look at. They stayed together quite late until Bulstrode poked her head in and said that she wouldn't be able to keep Granger away for much longer. Draco reluctantly left his friends, heading down the hall to his own dorm.
Harry awoke yet again from a nightmare. This was one he often had. He was alone in the old cavern where he and Dumbledore had gone to find a Horcrux, which turned out to be fake. But this time, Dumbledore wasn't there to save him from the inferi, and they dragged him down into the dark depths of the murky lake.
"Then, I declare Draco Lucius Malfoy innocent on all counts, though he must and will be subject to the same observation as Mrs. Narcissa Malfoy for the same reasons."
Hermione clapped her hands together. "Oh, Harry! That's wonderful! I'm so glad you two are finally getting somewhere." Ron nodded his congratulations but was too busy eating to say anything.
"So, what if you can't find him with spells?" Harry asked hopelessly.
Draco pouted. It was adorable and just made Harry start laughing again. When he finally regained control of himself, he leaned in to kiss Draco's pout away, still smiling. Draco stubbornly kept frowning.
Draco shook his head. "We're finishing our animagus potions today, remember? I can't possibly skip!"
Focus on one particular feature of your form. For your first attempt, you must pick something that the animal has in common with humans. Do not attempt to grow limbs such as wings, tails, extra arms/legs/heads, etc. You must only pick something to change. Smaller, less obtrusive changes will be easier than larger, grander ones.
"So it was more than just sleeping, after all?" Pansy asked waspishly. Draco jumped. "What makes you say that?" He asked innocently, but Pansy glared at him. "Perhaps the fact that you two shared a bed and weren't planning on telling us." Draco shrugged. "I suppose we did sleep in the same bed, but it was only sleeping. Not even a kiss to speak of." Pansy looked like she didn't believe him. Draco looked up to see Harry watching him again and smiled.
"Hey," Harry whispered. "You alright?"
"It's not as if we don't deserve it."
"Take a picture, Harry, it'll last longer," he said, rolling his eyes. When Harry didn't respond, Draco stepped closer, concerned.
He very quickly made a decision. Harry ran to the end of the hall and sharply turned right, nearly bowling Draco over. He grasped his slim wrist and tugged him through the nearest door, which happened to lead to a broom closet. A very small broom closet.
"Ouch!" Potter said indignantly, but at least he stopped laughing. Draco turned his nose up. "You're just jealous that I can breathe fire and fly. What can you do, Rudolph?"
Wait—the owls. Hogwarts was Unplottable, and so were countless magical structures, and the owls always managed to find them. If he sent a letter to Draco, the owl would undoubtedly reach him since the place wasn't under the Fidelius Charm. He scrambled up and rushed out of the room but then stopped. What if Draco couldn't respond? He racked his brains for a moment before coming up with another genius plan - what if he followed the owl?
Another ten minutes later, he spotted a house in the distance. It was the only thing around for kilometers, so he made a sharp turn and landed, still quite far away, so that the inhabitants would not see him. Harry took a deep breath. He would not turn this into Sirius and the Department of Mysteries. He sighed and used a spell to ascertain his coordinates, then conjured his stag Patronus, sending it to McGonagall with his location and a brief request for backup. Finally, Harry started walking towards the house, resigning himself to waiting until more people showed up.
At least he could honestly say that was not his intention this time.
Regards,
"He won't stop watching me!" Draco whined to Blaise. Blaise rolled his eyes.
Pansy came out looking like she had been awake for hours and promptly dragged them off to the Great Hall. They had sat down in their usual places. This time, to their mutual surprise, Bulstrode and Nott sat down next to them. After the initial shock and ensuing greetings, the additional Slytherins had been integrated into the conversation seamlessly. Draco felt a pang of sadness for his former friends, Crabbe and Goyle. Crabbe had- he had...and Goyle didn't want to return to Hogwarts without his ever-present counterpart. At times he missed their idiotic non-conversations and their nonverbal answers.
He shuddered, his cock pulsing as he came hard, stars exploding behind his eyelids. Draco's hand kept pulling through his orgasm, only stopping when it became too much for his sensitive skin. He exhaled heavily.
Unfortunately, he had one small issue: he didn't know how to transform back into a human. Draco assumed that it would be similar to turning into an animal, just in reverse, but what if he was wrong? That would land him in a situation that would be even worse than the one he was currently in. Draco had never seen the point of reading ahead to that step; he had never anticipated that he would achieve the animagus form under circumstances in which he would not have access to his book, or even Professor McGonagall if things were serious.
Draco hurried towards the Forbidden Forest, which was still, as its name suggested, off-limits to all students. But as long as no one saw him, it was fine.
Now that I'm all caught up posting chapters, they'll be once every few weeks and posted after I put them on Wattpad.
"I swear, Johnson, if you don't move, I will make you move!" threatened a very familiar voice.
Then, as if snapping out of a daydream, Harry suddenly realized what kind of a position they were in. He became acutely aware of Malfoy's drunk and frankly vulnerable state. It was unlikely he would enjoy being like this if he was sober. Harry scrambled up and away from Malfoy. The other boy just watched him, hand still hovering in the air.
Ron spluttered, and they both turned to look at him. "When she...Malfoy...said kind of...bloody hell...you and Malfoy?!" He finally managed. Harry blushed. Hermione looked impressed with Ron's powers of deduction.
Hmmm. Whatever it was, it was something embarrassing. That was the only thing that explained his strange behavior until then. He turned fully to face Draco, who was now avoiding his gaze.
Although...
"Yes, I know that already," she insisted. "But what is he doing here?" Parkinson - or was he meant to call her Pansy? - asked him pointedly.
Draco had shaken Blaise awake and dragged him off to find Pansy. They had discovered that her door was firmly shut, and being gentlemen, had simply waited for one of her roommates to come out. Bulstrode had given them an annoyed look when they had asked her to get Pansy but had complied anyways. Bulstrode was like that.
"What's wrong, Harry? Lost your touch? Is this what Gryffindor's prized Seeker has been reduced to?" Draco laughed mockingly at him and flew in circles around his head, hair streaming behind him. He looked so happy. Harry couldn't stop staring at him, not even noticing when Draco abruptly pulled his broom up, flying high into the air. He did, however, notice the little fluttering slightly above the other boy, and was horrified to notice that he hadn't even been looking for the Snitch. Draco caught it easily, whooping and coming down to gloat. Harry smiled fondly, and his discontent vanished like magic.
What Pansy told you is true, Harry and I have indeed become friends. It has not been easy by any means, but it is not something I intend to give up on without a fight. He has been good to me, far better than I could ever expect or deserve.
"That's not nearly enough to make you blush," he declared. His eyes became calculating. "How about we make a deal? If you tell me what happened in that dream, I'll mimic it now."
Harry deflated. How could Malfoy just think that Harry would speak for him without hours of careful consideration and deliberation, arguing with himself about whether the git deserved it or not? He tried to make Malfoy understand.
It was slightly unnerving.
He rushed through his morning routine and hurried up to the Great Hall. Just outside, he spotted a shock of white-blond hair exactly where they agreed to meet. He hurried up to Draco and asked breathlessly, "Are you ready?"
Harry turned her out. He ignored Ron's questioning and slightly indignant look. He was far too busy trying to forget where his mind had wandered to during class. As they made their way down to lunch, Hermione prattled on about the importance of studying and how the information they learned now was going to be important later on and the like. Harry and Ron had found that when Hermione was like this, it was better to just nod along and tune her out, so she didn't get upset. Hermione was still talking as they settled down to eat.
"Ginny," he began hesitantly. She shot him a bright smile. "Yes, Harry?" Harry opened his mouth, but nothing came out. Ginny immediately turned to face him fully. "What's wrong, Harry?" She asked, concern evident on her face.
Draco was beginning to feel as if he'd gone stark, raving mad. And maybe he had, sitting in his flat for days on end without even the slightest bit of company. He couldn't reconcile the man before him with his father - it was like...well, like Potter. Draco couldn't see the man in the newspapers as the same boy who had refused his friendship and nearly killed him in Hogwarts. His eyes told him they were the same, but his mind insisted they were not.
Pansy did not look very surprised. She did not even seem all that excited. "Is that all?" She asked, not impressed. "You've kissed before, you kissed again, big deal." Draco frowned. "Really? I think it was a big deal. We also spoke this morning, and he said he wanted to be in a relationship with me. Or, at least, he said he wanted there to be an 'us,'" Draco said, unsure.
Malfoy shook his head impatiently. "Yet you have it anyways. Honestly, Potter, how can you forgive me for all my misdeeds and not allow me to forgive you for yours? This is nothing compared to what I did." Harry shook his head. "It's different," he said stubbornly.
"Ah, Draco, lovely to see you back," Theo said, smoothing his shirt down.
Blaise, of course, just smiled enigmatically.
Harry was frozen. He didn't have a chance to admire Draco's lean frame, because two thin lines crossed over Draco's chest, meeting under his left pectoral. They were a ghostly white, paler than the blonde himself. Draco finished pulling off his robe and jumped when he saw Harry.
Let sit and boil for 30 seconds exactly, then add in 17 Toenails of an Ogre. Wait five seconds, then stir twice, first clockwise, then counter-clockwise.
Draco was quiet for a minute, then broke out into a smirk. "You dreamed about kissing me before you knew you were queer, didn't you?" He asked smugly. Harry has no choice but to respond in the affirmative, knowing that it was true.
We all knew stinky old Voldy
Draco pulled back and, seeing Harry's still but mutinous face, grinned triumphantly. After another moment, he shut his eyes.
Halfway through lunch, Blaise sat down at their bench. Both of them turned to stare at him. "And where have you been?" Pansy asked accusingly. Blaise only shrugged.
"clever."
Draco spent class staring blankly out the window, the grey sky dulling his mood and making him feel drained. Flitwick's squeaky voice washed over him, but the information did not make its way into his brain. No matter, he could easily ask for Pansy's notes or conduct his own research into the subject. Draco had always found lectures unendurable - why would teachers waste time droning on about a topic when experience was the best teacher? In any case, he spent the morning scanning the treetops of the Forbidden Forest with a leisurely gaze, sometimes spotting a flash of movement or a winged creature flying above the trees. At some point, he realized that the leaves - still a vibrant green, as they somehow were all year round - were the exact shade of Harry's eyes. And that just reminded him of the dazed, yet hungry look in the boy's eyes as he had leaned in to kiss him, caressing Draco's lips with his-
"Harry," Hermione shrieked. "Where were you? You didn't come to class or lunch! We were so worried!" Draco left Harry to be berated by Granger and soon found himself in an identical confrontation with Pansy.
"Hey Dray, Potter," she greeted. Harry glanced sideways at the blond at the nickname, but Draco ignored him, glowering at Parkinson instead.
"I think that's Hypnos," Harry corrected. "But Hyperion is a great name, isn't it?" he addressed the last part to the crup, kissing it softly on the nose. Draco snorted.
"Wow," a voice said from the door. Draco spun around to see Potter and the Weasel, looking around at the decorations in awe. Draco had to admit, Pansy had really gone all out. Tasteful streamers hung from the ceiling in black and silver, the lights were dimmed to a more cosy setting, and beanbags and armchairs were placed carefully around the room. Tables were set up along the left wall, covered in all kinds of snacks and drinks, including the Firewhiskey. It was definitely going to be a memorable party.
"I-" Harry looked like he was struggling with something. "I-"
Draco was not happy at this turn of events. But, he was not altogether surprised. How could he be, when he had tormented Potter for years now and had given the boy every reason to hate him? He would not hold a grudge against Potter for this, not when he so clearly deserved it. He was more disappointed that Potter would take their rivalry so far that he had to condemn his mother too. But they deserved it, so Draco understood.
"You wish, Potter. Give me a moment to grab my broom, and we'll see who's the better Seeker." He leaped off the bed, gracefully. About ten minutes later, they were walking out onto the Quidditch pitch, laughing and insulting each other playfully. Harry grabbed a spare practice Snitch reserved for Seeker's games, and, after a look at Draco, released it. They counted to five together, then took off at almost the same time.
"Now, if that is all, Potter, my friends are waiting for me." Malfoy stood up and began walking to the door. Harry watched him go, wondering when on earth Malfoy had changed without him noticing.
Draco scanned the room for his friends, but none of them were in sight. As he turned, his gaze was snagged by Potter, who was hugging the Weaslette. Jealousy flared inside Draco, and he struggled with the urge to go rip the girl away from Potter. He successfully tamped it down but decided that if there was any time for a drink, it was then. He approached the tables, where he spotted Pansy acting as bartender. He sat in front of the bar-like area and waited for her to give him her attention. When she turned to him, she broke out in a smile.
Harry was not in their room.
Potter opened his mouth to retort, but instead closed it and turned around to rummage in his trunk. He pulled out some clothes and stalked over to the bathroom, slamming the door shut.
He returned about twenty minutes later with a plate full of food. Harry was sitting on his bed with his knees pulled up to his chest. He was staring into space and didn't react when Draco came in. Draco sat next to Harry, then touched his shoulder to get his attention. He silently handed over the plate of food. Harry just stared at it blankly.
He lay down on his back, squirming to get comfortable. Casting one more glance at his curtains, he hesitated, then slowly reached down and pushed his pajamas off.
But what seemed like only minutes later, he was no longer thanking Merlin. His head was filled with images from the battle, bloody corpses screaming out his name and asking why he hadn't gone to the forest sooner.
Harry was still unsure. He didn't really want people obsessing over his life again or knowing so much private information about him. They already interfered far too much for his liking. He just wanted to be normal. Writing a book about his life would be certain to deny him any sort of normalcy for the rest of his life.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry shook his head slightly, but Draco's hands restricted his movement. "Those are opinions," he pointed out. Draco grinned. "See? I'm useless."
"Gryffindor," he complained. "Obviously, that opens me up to embarrassing questions about our sex life! Do you really want Mother asking whether we are using protective potions?"
Draco was staring again. He looked away, scowling, as he realized that he had been watching the Golden Boy again. But like metal to a magnet, his gaze was drawn back to Potter once more. He was just so bloody hot. Draco drank in Potter's looks, letting his gaze wander over the boy appreciatively before he snapped his gaze away once more, scowling again.
His mother gave his arm a squeeze, almost like she had heard his thoughts, and was giving him comfort. He looked down at her and smiled. If not for his mother's urging, he would have been back at the Manor, lounging around and wasting the days away. But now he was here, and it was too late to turn back.
Right on cue, Hermione walked over to him, Ron trailing behind her. She gave him a curious look. "What did Pansy want?" She asked.
Harry was frozen. He didn't say anything, only blinked at Draco for a couple of seconds, then stared at the ground. Just when Draco thought he might have gone too far, Harry, gazing up at him from under his eyelashes, biting his lip, asked softly, "Do you truly mean that?"
Harry was about to snap back a reply when he realized that Draco had not commented on his malnourished state. He closed his mouth, suddenly eager to escape. He grabbed his pajamas from his trunk and walked to the bathroom, slamming the door for dramatic effect. He took his time changing, hoping that Malfoy would bugger off in the meanwhile.
"Of course not, Draco!" Harry protested immediately. "I did not fancy you for a moment before this year!"
Harry sighed. "Nothing suspicious," he half-answered. He felt like it would be betraying Draco's trust if he told them about the Animagus attempts. "Okay?" Hermione said, confused. Harry never missed an opportunity to discuss Draco's behavior.
"Go," Wilson whispered, and they rushed to the door. Disregarding magic, two of the Aurors barged their shoulders against the door in an incredibly synchronized move, bypassing any possible locking charms. The six of them swarmed inside, wands aloft. They heard the sound of a back door being broken into and the subsequent footsteps of the other Auror duo.
Suddenly, a voice called, "Wait up, you two!" Trying to turn around without separating was difficult, and they nearly fell over, but they eventually managed and saw Pansy Parkinson striding over towards them.
Aline gifted him with a smile. "No, we're still in Britain, but we'll go back to my home country soon, because we're to be married, of course! I couldn't have my fiancé so far away, could I? Now, tell me, is there anything you need? I wasn't sure what you'd like..." she trailed off expectantly.
The other boy pulled back, watching Harry intently. "Someday, you're going to tell me what it is with me whispering your name that makes you blush." Right on cue, all the blood rushed directly to his face, though some diverted in a more southern direction. Harry shook his head, emphatically. There was no way he would ever reveal his erotic dream to Draco, especially considering it happened before they had ever kissed. "Never," he insisted. Draco smirked. "Is that a challenge, Potter?"
Draco raised his head up, eyes immediately drawn to Potter, who was watching him. Again. Draco almost blushed and looked away, but he didn't want to look like a schoolgirl with a crush. So, he just stared right back and raised an eyebrow. Potter smirked at him. Smirked! The bloody nerve! Potter never smirked. It was kind of hot.
Harry groaned in defeat.
My beloved son, I hope you are doing well. You must be very busy if you cannot spare the time to send me a letter informing me of your well-being.
Draco was so tired. He hated it all. The stinging hexes that never seemed to have a caster, the snide comments and endless whispers, and the occasional one-sided fight. He was done with it all. Done with everyone. Especially Potter.
They landed with a thud, Harry beneath Draco. Luckily, it seemed like he hadn't broken anything, and Draco's fall was cushioned by him, so he was probably fine too. With a groan of pain, Draco lifted his head to glare at Harry.
Harry watched the blond warily, but something far more intense stirred inside his body at the innocent question. "Only if you want it to be, Malfoy." He returned, holding his breath in anticipation.
Snape swept to the front of the room. "These are your permanent seats for the rest of the year. I will know if you attempt to switch, so do not try or you will automatically fail. You will be brewing the highly complex Animagus potion. It will force the drinker to reveal the form they would take if they put in the considerable work needed to become an animagus. No doubt, most of you will brew a far weaker form that will simply cause a mirage of the form to appear. A true animagus potion would force the drinker to become their animagus form for a few minutes before reverting back to a normal state. However-" he surveyed the class with his trademark sneer. "I do not expect any of you to even come close to that with the skill level some," and here his gaze landed on Harry and moved to Neville, "-of you have shown. I advise you to read the instructions carefully before you start. This potion will likely take you more than one class to brew. Now turn to page 394 and begin."
Draco shifted, bringing his left arm up from around Harry's waist and moving his head to rest in the back of Harry's neck. His hand was now resting on the pillow, in front of Harry's face, and his forearm rested on the bed. It was almost a protective stance - like he was caging Harry in to keep him safe from harm. With a jolt, Harry recognized the edge of the Dark Mark peeking out from under Draco's arm. With hesitant fingers, he reached out and brushed it gently. The moment he touched it, Draco jerked behind him.
"We know, Draco. You've only told us about a million times." Blaise was clearly not aware of the depths of his hatred for Potter. If he had been, he would not be treating this so lightly.
Draco was not convinced. But, he was tired, so he bade Pansy goodnight and walked off to his doom - dorm, I mean.
Rubbing his hip, which he had landed on, Draco walked over to the wardrobe. He flung it open to reveal about two dozen robes. As he rifled through them, he frowned, seeing that they were all his size. The nightstand's drawers were empty, and there was absolutely nothing else of note in the room. Draco knew it was likely a vain hope, but he tried the door, confirming that it was locked.
She laughed, and even that was alluring. "My name is Alina Biello. You know me, no?" she asked in response to the recognition on his face.
He nodded at Potter. "You hold it down. I'll give it the worm." Potter looked scandalized. "Why should I be the one to hold it down, Malfoy? You do it!" Draco just barely kept himself from rolling his eyes. "You're closer, Potter," he retorted. "Now stop arguing so we can get this over with."
All the 8th years looked at each other, and then there was a mad dash for the fireplace. Every student was jostling to see who they would be rooming with.
On the other hand, magpies are risk-takers. They are not afraid to tempt predators, earning respect. If you see a magpie, you are not afraid of taking a chance.
Distracted by looking around, Draco took a moment to notice to whom they were talking. When he finally faced the owner, the bright blue eyes nearly gave him a heart attack. But the moment he registered the eyes, he immediately started taking in other details about the older man in front of him. His beard wasn't nearly as long, there were no half-moon spectacles, and his nose wasn't crooked. A million other differences jumped out at him, but he was still terrified of the man standing in front of him.
"Draco, darling. Stop staring at Potter so much. The usual amount of staring is okay, but now you're making him nervous."
"Why not?" Hurt flitted across Harry's face, and Draco wanted to hug him and tell him, or rather show him, exactly how much he desperately wanted this to continue.
"Maybe, Draco. But you won't know until you ask." Draco looked horrified at that suggestion. Pansy snickered at him. "Since I'm such a wonderful friend, I might consider going and figuring it out for you. For a price, of course. There was a beautiful emerald bracelet in Witch Weekly, and I think it would look quite nice on my wrist. And you know how much I love green, darling." Draco nodded emphatically. "Consider it your Christmas present," he promised her, and she gave him a Slytherin grin. "Just leave it to me, sweetie."
"What?" Harry snapped at him, finally raising his head. Draco reared his head back at the irate tone. "I'm sorry - I was just trying to help. You shouldn't miss breakfast, otherwise, you'll be hungry for the rest of the day." Draco tried to reason. Harry glared defiantly at him. "I don't want to. I'm not going to class. Now go away." He bit out. Draco blinked, surprised at how Harry was acting.
"It wouldn't be unnecessary," Draco muttered but allowed it. "Is there anything that gets rid of them?"
Sure enough, Harry caught up to him moments later. They headed up to the library together, chatting quietly about their homework.
Harry aimed a spell at the student, but his hand was shaking from anger, and he missed. He growled at the cowards, turning back to Malfoy, who was still on the floor. He recited the countercurse and swished his wand, allowing Malfoy to stand up. Harry eyed him, checking for major injuries.
Draco was stunned. This had to have been a dream. He would wake up at any moment and find that the trial hadn't even happened yet. Because in what world would Potter be so passionately defending him, Draco Malfoy, a known Death Eater? His only regret was that if this wasn't real, then his mother hadn't really been declared innocent.
A silencing charm, then?
"When Malfoy finally succeeded, he was forced to let Death Eaters into the castle. Then, he went up to the Astronomy tower, only to find Dumbledore in a very weak state, but still strong enough to cast just one spell. And instead of stopping Malfoy, Dumbledore chose to cast a Petrificus Totalus on the only other person there. Me."
When his awful lawyer had finished, Potter stood up again. Draco stared at him blankly. Was it time for Potter to leave? Was there somewhere he needed to be? Or maybe this trial was so pathetic that Potter could no longer stand to watch. The Chief Warlock gave Potter a resigned look and allowed him to walk over to the stand. Wait, the stand? What was Potter thinking?
"Ugh! I hate how they think I'm too incompetent to realize when I'm being manipulated! It's like they think I'm still an ignorant child that can't make good choices, and Draco's the best damn decision I've ever made! And how dare they say I defended him because of this as if I would even be with him if I didn't think he was redeemable. Who are these students anyway?" Harry ranted, eyes flashing once more in righteous anger. Draco hadn't seen that look in a while.
"Narcissa-" his father began, but his mother cut him off once more. "Not now, my love," she insisted. "Draco will do as he must, as he always has done. He will not let our family down, and you know that. You can hardly blame him for needing to get away after how abruptly you revealed the news to him." His mother did not break eye contact with Draco as she said this as if she were trying to tell him something with her gaze alone. Whatever the message was, Draco did not receive it. He had never been apt at reading his mother's facial expressions, no matter how untrue it was for the reverse.
Please write back soon, my love. You know how I worry. Please tell me you have listened to what I told you at the beginning of the year. Your happiness is all I wish for anymore.
Harry raised a shaking hand to point at the scars. "I did that to you." His voice was trembling, eyes wide with horror and shame. Draco recoiled, then determinedly crossed the room to stand in front of Harry.
"The Boy Who Lived Dates Known Death Eater," the headline exclaimed.
The only problem that niggled at the back of his head was Draco's feelings toward him. Sure, Draco was attracted to him. That much was made clear by their last kiss. But did he like him, Harry? Or was his desire purely physical? Harry suspected it was the latter. It would be rather strange for Draco of all people to suddenly do an about-face and start liking him, not when they had been enemies for years. It was therefore much more likely that Draco simply found him attractive, Merlin knows why. Harry felt a great sadness at that. He truly liked Draco, had a crush on him even. But if friends with benefits was the closest he could get, he would take that too. He would take anything at this point, as long as they didn't retrogress. His last impossible wish was that Draco might someday like him back. But as he said, it was impossible. At least he knew Draco didn't want him for his fame.
"It's a bit pathetic," he muttered. Harry wondered why he refused to look at him and ducked down to try to meet his eyes. It worked, and their gazes locked, intense as Harry's eyes advertised his challenge.
Draco had been dragged along to help with the final preparations. Pansy had asked him to make sure that the Hufflepuffs were actually bringing alcohol. After interrogating a few of them, he found out that Smith was the one who was supposed to smuggle it in. He spent nearly half an hour tracking him down, only to find the git had backed out at the last second. Knowing Pansy would be furious if their party lacked alcohol, he set about finding a different way to acquire it.
Harry moved close, grabbing his hands and holding them firmly. "Draco, I love you. More than anything. I wouldn't live another second without saying it, without you knowing."
Draco looked around. He had expected Potter to leave now that his mother was free, but Potter simply sat on the bench to watch. Draco's hands began to sweat. He didn't want Potter to see him like this, helpless while he was relentlessly questioned and forced to admit to his crimes.
Harry hummed noncommittally.
His father's trial was abysmal. Their lawyer was some dimwit who clearly had no idea how to practice law. The prosecution was ruthless, and it was evident that his father was not going to get off easily. And by his face, paler than he had ever seen it before, his father knew it too. Finally, the trial reached its end, the prosecution rested their case, the lawyer for the defense stuttered hopelessly, and the Chief Warlock called for a vote. "All in favor of the defendant, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, being declared guilty and sentenced to life in prison for his crimes, in addition to paying reparations for the damages he has caused, directly and indirectly, raise your hands."
"A book?" Harry repeated skeptically. "First off, I can't write. Second, why would I write a book?" Draco waved his hand dismissively. "That is no matter; you can always have someone write it for you. I'm sure authors would line up for the opportunity to write about famous Harry Potter's grand adventures. And why not write a book? Everyone would read it, maybe multiple times. It would be a bestseller! And imagine, if you wrote about everything you just told me, everyone would know and remember. I promise it would work."
"Are you okay?" Draco asked, concerned.
Oh how he loved Draco, ever the worried boyfriend. "It's fine," Harry assured him. "Let's just avoid the ballroom and dungeon, if that's okay."
"But you know," Draco started absentmindedly, "when we woke up, he was saying something about having thought things over...and he didn't mind me touching him..." he trailed off, now unaware of his audience.
Harry glared at the both of them. "Since when did you two start working together against me? Bloody hell, as if 'Mione wasn't perceptive enough on her own!"
"Draco," he whispered into Harry's ear. "No more last names, remember?" Then he pulled back, and his smirk was bigger than ever. Draco turned around with some difficulty, then gingerly opened the door, poking his head out.
Harry flushed immediately and looked away. Draco gave a fake sigh of disappointment. "I think it would be in your favor to just tell me. Otherwise, I might think it's something worse than it is. Or better, depending on how you look at it." Draco warned him. Harry chewed on his lip. The other boy had a point, but also Harry would never admit that he had eavesdropped on him, then dreamt of kissing him, then almost actually kissed him...yeah, it was much better to let Draco believe whatever he could come up with. Harry shook his head, determinedly. Draco pouted, and Harry wanted to kiss him again because it was absolutely adorable. Thankfully he was already blushing. Merlin, he never thought he'd say that.
Draco stood in a rush. He threw down some muggle money - he did not care to count out his change at the moment - and strode out of the bar at a fast clip.
"You're one to talk," Draco snapped at him. "Since when do you ever take the safe, easy, non-rule-breaking route?"
Hermione looked alarmed. "Have you ever slept once without having a nightmare?" She asked. Harry started to shake his head, then stopped. "Actually, earlier today. I didn't have a nightmare this afternoon, when I was taking a nap with-" he stopped himself because he hadn't told Hermione about falling asleep with Draco. But Hermione was far too sharp for him. "With Draco?" She asked gently. Harry nodded reluctantly.
Dear Merlin, Draco was prepared for anyone but this.
"Can we talk?" Harry asked cautiously. Malfoy looked at him blankly, then glanced at his friends before looking back at him and nodding.
Dreading the end of the ride only made it come quicker, and the splitting of the group came soon after. Everyone left for their homes, and Harry to the Burrow, slightly comforted by the thought of seeing each other soon. It wasn't enough.
Draco decided to attempt the step again. Now that his brain had more room, he found it far easier to imagine all the details at once. Fortunately, or unfortunately, one might say, the newfound alertness made it impossible not to notice the rather loud breathing that had started somewhere to his left.
Harry's present for Draco was medium-sized and rattled around a bit when he shook it gently. At Harry's encouragement, he opened it carefully and pulled out three slender vials with silvery substances inside them.
"See," he said exaggeratedly like he was speaking to a child, "this is a mirror. And those-" he pointed at Harry's defined torso in the mirror "-are called abdominal muscles. Abs. Say it with me. Aaabs."
"You're stuck with me, I'm afraid," he whispered back, trying to lighten the atmosphere. Harry pulled back, cupping his cheeks and staring into his eyes - soul, really - for a solid minute.
Draco looked angry now. "Leave it, Pans," he hissed at her. Then, he tugged her away into the Great Hall without so much as another word. Zabini, who had been watching all this quietly, gave Harry an apologetic look and followed his friends.
"Mione, the essay isn't due until next week. Chill. It's the first day, and we deserve to slack off."
Alina immediately assured him that she would be glad to speak with him at dinner, and she expressed concern over his headache, saying she would check on him in a few hours. After opening the window, she left, and Draco waited a few more minutes to make sure she wasn't going to come in again.
Harry could see it too, now. He glared at the pair, wishing they would stop right there.
Draco avoided her gaze. "It was nothing, Pans. Just Potter being Potter, doing the right thing, and all that crap. He didn't even look at me. It meant nothing." Blaise snorted. Draco and Pansy turned their gazes to him.
But Harry felt an overwhelming urge to punch the blonde boy directly in his face. And he did. Malfoy reeled back, nose streaming blood. It looked broken. "Podder," He said in an angry, nasally voice. "Whad is going on?" Harry just surged forward again, this time aiming for his gut. Malfoy doubled over, the breath knocked out of him.
He couldn't fault them for trying. Neither could he fault himself for having separation anxiety with all they had been through.
He held out hope, though, and left the Great Hall at exactly quarter to ten. As the minutes passed by, he grew more anxious until just before the clock chimed the hour, he was tapping his foot, arms crossed.
Malfoy turned underneath him so that they were face to face. Harry pushed himself up so that he was supporting himself on his forearms, and froze.
Draco glanced at her, something passing over his face too quickly for Harry to read. Parkinson seemed to have received the message because she winked at Harry and then left unceremoniously.
"My love?" His mother's voice interrupted his father's tirade, and Draco turned around. "I heard-" she stopped when she saw her son.
"Mr. Potter, are you at the Ministry to witness the trial of your enemy, Draco Malfoy?"
"I still don't understand why I couldn't have done this in bed," Harry grumbled from his spot on the couch. He was stretched out, head tilted back on the armrest and eyes closed, looking for all the world like he was fast asleep. Unfortunately for him, the noise of the common room kept him from drifting off.
"I asked her for a book that taught me how to become an animagus, did the steps, and transformed into a dragon. I knew that would be my form since we brewed the potion in Professor Snape's class. Then, I flew out the window until I found a village," Draco answered in a monotone voice.
"Nothing is ever simple with you and Malfoy," Ginny murmured, but Harry didn't hear her.
Harry shivered, the frigid air blasting his face as they exited the tavern. He eyed Draco, who had his hands shoved deep into his pockets, and lamented the lack of pockets in his outer robes. He absolutely had to get new ones. For now, though, he settled for slipping his right hand into Draco's left pocket and letting the other one succumb to frostbite. No one needed two hands anyway.
————————————————————————
——————————————————
Harry leaned over and covered his mouth with his hand, silencing him. "Did you mean the part about having feelings for me?" He asked breathlessly. Draco wanted to die because Merlin was this boy insufferably dense.
Potter fell silent, evidently finished. The jury was talking quietly amongst themselves, shocked by the information they had just received. The Chief Warlock stood up. "With that," he said, clearly shaken, "let us vote. All in favor of declaring the defendant, Narcissa Malfoy née Black, guilty, raise your hands."
"You found Mr. Malfoy?" Headmistress McGonagall asked as soon as she was within earshot. Harry nodded fervently, wishing to get on with it as soon as possible. Draco was so close, and Harry had waited patiently for hours.
He froze. Parkinson had never been this close to him, so maybe that's why he had never known. Subconsciously, though, he must have detected it, that oh-so-familiar flowery scent—Ginny's perfume. Parkinson must use it too.
I don't know if you've heard yet, but his kidnapper was a woman by the last name of Biello. Would you happen to know anything about her that could help find Draco if he didn't escape and was sent somewhere else instead?
Harry and the three Aurors dashed up the stairs, quickly spreading out to check the doors. He ran, allowing his magic to seep out and around, searching. He skidded to a halt when it encountered a heavily warded door, his heart thudding. Harry threw himself into undoing the curses, discarding his wand in favor of using raw magic to untangle the threads of power keeping the door firmly shut.
Nearly half an hour had passed when a noise interrupted Draco's mental recitation of old Latin poetry. He stood, all traces of the dead language gone from his mind as he prepared to face his kidnapper.
"I am not 'His Highness,' whoever that may be," Draco insisted.
Harry and Draco stared after him in silence. Harry faced Draco. "Don't listen to him. You're not a Death Eater anymore."
"Oh?" The man sounded like he did not believe him. "You are not His Royal Highness Draco Lucius Malfoy II, heir to the British throne?"
Draco stood slowly.
"I think it's a nice change," Hermione chimed in, sitting next to Parkinson, across from Draco.
Speaking of the holidays, he needed to figure out what his Christmas present to Draco would be. Harry wanted it to be something special - this would be their first Christmas together and their first holiday at all, in fact. He couldn't get Draco just anything, it would have to be extraordinary, and something they could look back on with fond memories.
Draco sensed that it might be easier to escape if he stayed on Alina's good side. If she didn't see it as a kidnapping, maybe she would be open to letting him out of this room eventually, and from there, he might be able to get away.
Harry looked terribly sad all of a sudden. "Since I realized that my way often gets other people hurt or killed. But," Harry looked smug now, though the depression still lingered, "one might say that this is quite Gryffindorish of you. Dangerous, downright difficult, and quite frankly, illegal."
Draco frowned at her. "I'm not. He wanted space, remember? I'm not about to go against his wishes and risk ruining this. He's worth the wait." Blaise made a gagging sound.
Pansy gave him a sympathetic look and graciously steered the conversation away from Potter-related topics. Soon, she announced that she was going to find the Trolley Witch and buy them all something to eat.
Draco started. When had his mother had time to save the Chosen One? And why hadn't she told him? Why hadn't anyone told him? It should have been big news.
The room was quite spartan, filled with only the bare necessities. The bed was slightly rumpled, and the window was wide open, letting in the cold winter air. Upon approaching the bed, Harry caught sight of a relatively large book, and, with a jolt of surprise, realized it was the same book Draco had been reading in the Forest so long ago.
Draco wanted to bang his head on the table again, but he refrained. He didn't want to suffer any more brain damage than he already had. He had to have a serious brain injury if he was thinking about these kinds of thoughts. He should probably get it checked out.
Both Pansy and Blaise, who were the only people within hearing distance of him, snorted. Blaise leaned forward, resting his chin on his hand.
Pansy smirked. "Would that really be so bad, Draco? I'm almost positive he's hiding some gorgeous abs underneath those ridiculously large clothes he wears."
I am glad you two did not endeavor to hide your relationship from me, and I appreciate the sentiment behind wanting to wait. I take no offense from your actions; they were entirely reasonable.
It had always been Draco, hadn't it?
Malfoy looked surprised at the end of his impromptu speech but gave Harry a curious look.
Harry collapsed onto the couch in the common room, exhausted. Turning into an animal was strangely tiring. But he also felt a surge of determination to put in the work to become an animagus. He could see why his father loved being a stag. He felt light and speedy as a reindeer, and those were also the qualities that made him such a great Seeker. He felt a surge of closeness with the father he had barely known.
"Sorry. Didn't realize the door opened so easily." Goldstein said, flashing them an embarrassed grin. Draco scowled at him. Potter took the opportunity to escape, grabbing some clothes, and rushing to the bathroom. Goldstein casually walked over to his trunk and started rummaging around in it. Draco scowled harder at his back, before walking over to his own bed. He would come back to this another day. Potter would not escape him again.
Harry, stunned, looked towards his friends. Ron was wearing a similar expression, while Hermione just looked a bit smug. He shook his head in utter confusion, and together they went into the Great Hall.
He didn't have to hesitate. He just pulled Harry into a tight hug. Tilting his head down to whisper in his ear, Draco told him softly, "Harry, the only one who should have to worry about this is me. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. But for you, Harry, it's the opposite. No one will ever accept this; you will always face criticism for being with me. I will never stop wanting you, do not underestimate me in that. As long as you want me, I'll be here. I cannot comprehend how you could ever think this a good idea, but as long as you are experiencing this bout of insanity, I won't complain." He pulled back to gaze at Harry, eyes flickering between his astonishingly green ones. Harry rolled his eyes and smiled at Draco, and that was enough to take his breath away.
The Auror that had been questioning him cleared his throat. "Not to interrupt, but..." he trailed off when Harry shot him a fierce glare. "Erm," he started again. "We're almost done anyway. Is it alright if I owl you the rest of the questions?" Draco nodded, still annoyed by the earlier implication that he had been lying.
"Wonderful," Pansy drawled dryly. "You're both as sickeningly sappy as the other. No wonder you two make a perfect pair."
"Do you know how many times I've been late to class because I had to stop and pick up all my stuff? Do you know how many people have laughed at me while I stood there like an idiot? DO YOU KNOW JUST HOW ANNOYING YOUR LITTLE TRICK WAS?" Harry was panting and Draco's face was slowly turning red. Harry slightly lessened the force he was using so the blonde could breathe. Draco coughed then said, "Harry, if you're going to yell at me, can you do it without being so bloody close?"
"So you kidnapped me," Draco blurted out. Alina immediately scowled. "I didn't kidnap you. I saved you! You're terribly ungrateful, you know."
Draco looked like the cat that got the canary.
The moment Ron finished his story, Hermione turned back to Harry and asked, "So what did he do in your dream?" Harry blushed and sank so far down into his seat that only his crimson forehead and black hair could be seen. Hermione rolled her eyes. "Did he kiss you?" She asked gently. Harry nodded. "Anything else?" He shook his head.
Sooner than Draco would have liked, they drew near the castle. The train stopped at the station, and Draco, Pansy, and Blaise got up to leave. As Draco stepped off, he heard a familiar voice.
Draco was sure his father would never enter him into a marriage contract to the Biellos, not after the contempt he had shown them. Perhaps this was their famous insanity manifesting? She had to be mad if she thought purebloods couldn't be gay. They were just never told about them, but they very much existed.
"Draco," the Slytherin greeted, inclining his head.
"All in favor of declaring the defendant innocent on all counts, raise your hands."
Harry appreciated the compliment, but at the moment, he was far too worried to even contemplate joining the Aurors, and thankfully, Wilson seemed to realize that.
"Draco, darling, talk to me."
Hermione was practically bouncing in her seat as McGonagall came around with the timetables. When she passed Harry his, he quickly scanned it. Today was potions (cue pained groan), then Herbology, Defense, and finally Transfiguration. All the 8th years had their classes together, so they all had the same timetables unless you were a genius like Hermione and were taking a bunch of extra classes.
"Dragons are my area of expertise, you know. That's why they called me in - that and I was in the area checking out a possible dragon egg confiscated from a black market trader. I didn't think there was a baby dragon out in the middle of Britain, so I wasn't all that surprised to find an animagus," Charlie nattered on cheerfully. "You have those distinctive markings that you wouldn't find on any real dragon. I bet you got stuck; that's why they have all those rules about registering before you try. You caused a lot of trouble, you know. The Ministry had to send out their entire team of Obliviators to deal with this mess. They're stretched thin at the mo - a student vanished right out of Hogwarts, and the Aurors have had no luck finding him. Poor Harry..." the Weasel trailed off, more talking to himself. Draco could have hexed him for withholding news about Harry.
"This is your punishment for not listening to me. You have to stay here until I let you go." Draco's muffled voice floated up.  Harry sighed exasperatedly. "It's not much of a punishment," he mumbled quietly.
Draco ignored him, wondering what the question would be. Harry coughed. "It's embarrassing," he admitted. "A couple of weeks...months?...ago, I overheard you say something..." he trailed off. Draco sighed with impatience. "If you want me to confirm it, you'll have to tell me what you heard."
But Harry also felt an odd, almost foreign feeling rush through him that left him inexplicably upset. He sat up.
"Erm-" Harry said, not knowing what to say in response to the image in front of him.
——————————————————
"What is it, Harry?" Draco asked exasperatedly. Harry gave him a grin. "Let's go flying. I need a break, and so do you. C'mon, we can have a seeker's game." Draco looked alarmed. "Harry! We can't just go flying; there's so much work to do!" Harry gave him a challenging smirk. "Scared, Malfoy?" He taunted. Draco stared at him for a minute.
Draco turned to Harry, noting that the Dumbledore look-alike had disappeared. "Who was that?" He demanded. Harry looked startled for a second before understanding, and a hint of pity flashed across his face. "Aberforth Dumbledore," he replied solemnly.
Now, he had to figure out flying and fast. If Alina came in now, all would be lost. Draco stretched his new wings carefully, testing out how they felt. His one experience with flight - the time in the potions classroom - only proved that it would be much more difficult than he had anticipated. Far from being natural, even for a dragon, flying required the tricky ability to comprehend and react accordingly to lots of information at once - balance, flapping strength, and direction were among the many things to keep track of, and they were coordinated by the joint effort of many different muscles and his tail, wings, and brain, among other things. Things that came naturally to real dragons were things through which Draco had to struggle.
Harry was taken aback. This was not what he had expected. "Thank you, Kingsley, but right now, I think I've had enough of dark wizards for a lifetime. Is there truly no way to enter the trial?" He asked one last time to make sure. "I'm afraid not, Harry," was his answer. Harry nodded. "Then, I must be going. I will stop by sometime to visit, though." Kingsley clapped him on the shoulder and then guided him back to the entrance hall. "I must leave you here; I have some urgent business to attend to. I wish you luck on your way out." Harry thanked him and watched him leave. But Harry himself had no plans to exit, not yet at least. An idea was forming in his head. Because when Harry Potter made up his mind, he followed through. And because half-baked plans are what Harry does best.
"Yes, that does sound like he wants to be a couple. Gryffindors," she said, shaking her head. Pansy went back to her lunch like Draco had been merely talking about the weather or some homework, not a life-changing development. "What's wrong with you?" He asked, concerned, and slightly annoyed. "I thought you would have been asking all kinds of questions."
Draco shook his head. "I very clearly remember you asking for space. But who am I to complain? Though we should get up soon, it's nearly time for the feast." Draco said, a bit unwillingly. Harry nodded. "You're right, we should probably move before Nott or Goldstein comes in and sees us." Draco disentangled his arms from around Harry, and they moved apart, getting off the bed. Harry headed for his trunk to find some clothes, while Draco went to the bathroom to freshen up.
"It's hardly a dungeon," Draco protested, but squeezed his hand comfortingly.
He finally spotted the wild, brown hair and looked in the immediate vicinity of the girl. A few feet to the right, his gaze was caught by another pair of familiar, green eyes watching him. And Merlin, Pansy was right, Potter had gotten hot. The dorky lenses had been upgraded to still dorky, but more fashionable frames. The hair was still a mess, but it was longer, so at least it looked like it was messy on purpose. And Potter had finally filled out, the scrawny build becoming the strong, lean body that all Seekers possessed. But no Seeker could ever come close to matching Potter's looks. Draco swallowed and pushed all the feelings that had risen in him down to the depths of his soul, where no one could ever find them. But he couldn't break the staring contest he had with Potter. Because, as with everything between them, this was a competition, and Draco simply had to win.
Draco awoke quite suddenly. He had no recollection of the previous night's dream, but he knew it must have been something out of the ordinary if he had woken up that way. He lay in bed for a couple of minutes, listening to the sound of his dorm mates' breathing. As his mind grew less foggy and more aware, he realized there was less snoring than usual.

Harry muttered a wandless alohomora to open the door - his hands were quite full - and was promptly greeted by the (tied for first) most important member of the household.
"I'm not staring, Pans. I never stare at Potter."
"That may be true, Miss Granger, but that logic fortunately does not apply to detentions." Snape's familiar drawl sounded from behind them, and they stiffened in surprise. "Now get in my classroom before I mark you all late."
Wilson turned to him. "Harry? I would ask you to stay out of harm's way, but you're of age now, and you've proven yourself to be just as capable as any one of us."
Friday rolled around, and Draco was nothing if not nervous. The anticipation was too much to handle; the only thing he could do was use his endless homework and projects to shove the upcoming date to the back of his head. Consequently, he had nearly entirely repressed any thought of it, and when Harry ran up to him and told him that he would be waiting at the Entrance Hall by the main doors at ten 'o clock, Draco was briefly bewildered.
He tore the flap, a bit hysterical with the number of letters that were still pouring in. The moment he touched the letter inside, he felt the room lurch sickeningly and spin in a twister of color, depositing him in a dank, pitch-black room.
Draco shifted anxiously. If Pansy thought Potter had gotten good-looking (not that he wasn't before, but Pansy had always disagreed with that), then Potter had definitely gotten good-looking. He quickly changed the subject before his mind could begin to conjure up images.
"Come on, Harry! We mustn't be late to the feast, we'll miss the Sorting, and you've missed far too many already! Let's go before the carriages fill up!"
Resisting the mounting urge to sigh in exasperation, he spoke, eyes still closed. "Do you intend to stalk me until the end of time, Harry? I don't mind, only your panting is making it rather difficult to concentrate."
"Oof," he protested.
"What was that?" Harry asked, slightly annoyed. He was beginning to wonder why he had helped Malfoy.
"Oh, no!" Alina immediately started fussing over him. "Is there anything I can do for you? Headache potion, perhaps?"
"Whatever are you talking about?" Draco asked him. Harry gave him a funny look. "You know," he slowly said as if Draco were stupid. "Hogsmeade. Tomorrow. Saturday. Together? Is any of this ringing a bell?" He asked facetiously.
"What's wrong?" He echoed. Harry looked away, tension lining his still bare shoulders.
Alina was all smiles once again. "Anything for my lovely fiancé," she trilled, fluttering her lashes flirtatiously. Draco gave her his most charming smile, the one even Pansy couldn't resist. Harry, of course, the sap that he was, broke at even the hint of a pleading look. But Draco relegated all thoughts of his brunet boyfriend to the back of his mind, knowing that he wouldn't be able to go through with his charade otherwise.
Harry ignored the voice telling him that whatever could harm Draco would have no qualms about doing Narcissa in either.
"Too late," he crowed in delight. "You should've known better than to give me an opening like that."
He blinked. Where did that come from? Harry gave his head a tiny shake to clear of possibly dangerous thoughts, especially thoughts of biting, sucking, or licking Draco's neck like he so badly wanted to do.
P.S. We did not mean any offense in not informing you of our relationship beforehand. Draco was insistent that we tell you personally, not through a letter, and I agreed. Our intent was to tell you during the hols in a couple of weeks.
Did Malfoy really- was he really-? Harry tried to imagine Malfoy with another bloke. Kissing another bloke. That same feeling he had felt in the common room shot through him again. At least he knew now that Malfoy wasn't dating Parkinson. But why did that knowledge soothe the angry feeling in his chest? And why did the thought of Malfoy being with some random bloke only make it worse? This was far too much for his sleep-deprived brain to handle. He drifted off, thoughts of Malfoy and this newest realization filling his head.
Perhaps seeing his face edge towards despair, the reporter backed off a bit, thanking him for his time. Harry liked him all the more for it, and bid him goodbye.
Harry did not so much as breathe, scared he would change his mind.
"Fine!" Harry snapped. Then, pinching the bridge of his nose between his fingers, he softened his voice so Malfoy wouldn't get bitchy. "I wanted to ask if what those idiots said was true."
"What do you want, Potter?" He asked evenly.
The trio made their way to their next class, Herbology. Thankfully, Professor Sprout gave them the simple task of calming down the Fluttermy plants. It was easy, but since the timid little shoots needed a lot of coaxing, it didn't allow for much conversation.
Everyone thought he was royalty. As he was ushered out of the limo and into Buckingham Palace - Buckingham Palace! - everyone they passed bowed or curtsied or inclined their heads in acknowledgment. Not a single one pointed out the simple fact that he was not the prince, much to his growing unease.
They walked into the Great Hall all together. Many of the students started whispering, but McGonagall looked quite proud. They separated to their tables, then began to dig in. There was a large spread of delightful foods, and Ron looked gleeful. Harry spent the time chatting away amicably with the other Gryffindors and occasionally glancing at Draco. Sometimes their eyes would meet, and they would share a smile.
"Good morning," Blaise greeted him. Draco just groaned, pouring himself a glass of pumpkin juice. Blaise turned to Pansy and raised an eyebrow. She just shrugged in response.
———————————————————————
Harry's heart melted, just a little. After all, he would give anything for the Weasleys to accept Draco, and for him to like them in return. Harry resolved to make every effort to please Narcissa because it's what he would want from Draco.
"So," he began, then didn't know how to continue. After a couple of seconds, Hermione looked at him softly.
"Ouch!" Harry yelped, yanking his hand back quickly. "Did you just bite me?" He asked incredulously. Draco stared him down. "Yes, and it was well deserved. Do you really, honestly think I would kiss you, let alone say all the ridiculously soppy things that just came out of my mouth, risking everything of what's left of my already greatly diminished reputation, if I didn't feel something for you? Merlin, Harry, you are an idiot."
All too soon, they were standing on the platform at Hogsmeade, waiting for the Hogwarts Express to arrive. Harry, Hermione, and Ron, together always, now with the addition of Draco. Now Harry knew his place in the dynamic - third-wheeling had been a somewhat awkward time for all of them. Pansy and Zabini soon arrived to balance it out - three Gryffindors and a Slytherin could never work for long - and thus, their trio turned into a sextet. The train compartment was a little crowded, sure, but it was the good kind of crowded, the one that is full of friendship and closeness, and getting to know each other.
—————————————————————
Harry got up quickly to disguise his surprise at Malfoy playing along. He had expected him to snap or tell him to quit goofing off. He found that he quite liked how laid back this new Malfoy was.
Harry thanked her and then went to his room. He sat down, grabbed a piece of parchment, dipped his quill in an inkwell, and began to write.
Draco felt shame rise up in him. How selfish he had been, to ignore his mother's entirely reasonable request for him to write once a week. There was no excuse for his lapse in thought. With that in mind, he hurried to the library to write a response the moment he finished eating.
A moment later, Draco stuck his head in. "Hello, how was your day? Hermione and Ron will be over in an hour."
"Could you help Draco over to your dorm? He's a bit drunker than he usually gets. Could you just help guide him to your room, make sure he lies down? It would be a huge help." Zabini gave him a pleading look.
