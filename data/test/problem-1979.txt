Luna ducks into the kitchen at five o’clock, drawn in by the delicious savoury smells and the rattle of crockery. Mary Ann is serving up, but she stops when she sees Luna, holding up one finger and disappearing into the back room. When she emerges, she is holding a wooden crate filled with old utensils: ladles, slotted spoons, spatulas and potato mashers. The contents of the box clink as she hands it to Luna.
“Look at all those presents,” says a tiny boy who appears to be immobilised by a shimmering field of magic. He lifts his head and beams around at everyone, bright spirit seemingly unaffected by his condition.
Just as he is arranging the parcels under his tree, a Ministry owl flutters onto his windowsill and taps at the glass. Harry takes the proffered envelope and grins to see a card with a picture of woodland creatures and a message from Timothy.
“What is it this time?” Ron asks, blowing on his hands for several seconds and then giving up and casting a warming charm.
School was a very long time ago, and so was the war... and yet everyone is still following Potter’s every move. That being said, Draco thinks, leafing idly through Lee’s parchments, the Potter comments have been rather thin on the ground over recent weeks. He almost wonders if he should be worried.
“He looks very nice on our shop counter,” Harry says. “And he’s better behaved than some of our customers.”
“Sorry about this, but… what the fuck, Mr J?” she explodes, dashing away tears with the back of her hand. “I was so worried about you! I brought you tea every day! I told you things… I trusted you.”
“You stop it.”
“I’d like to take full credit for it but Rosie saw it first,” Ron admits. “The brilliant thing about it is that it has a little string so you can hang it on your Christmas tree.”
Feeling slightly sick, Harry closes his eyes. Ida is a sweet, eccentric old woman and he can’t comprehend how her family could be so cold. All he does know is that when he sees Molly tomorrow, he’s going to hug her until she makes him stop. When he opens his eyes, Corrie, Eilish, and Danica are peering at him, faces creased in concern. He smiles at them and they seem to relax, sipping their horrible tea and watching the nurses and Healers hurry by. They are sitting so patiently, despite the uncomfortable chairs and the crowds, waiting for news of their friend, and perhaps, Harry thinks, that’s the point.
“Fine. I’m looking for an ornamental duck.”
Mr Jennings watches it bounce across his tiled floor and come to rest with a clatter.
“I’m what?”
“Hello,” Eilish says, waving a pinecone at him. “You’re drenched!”
The corridor is cold and empty and the windows are dark, but elsewhere in the castle there are fires and lights and adventures. He takes the stone floor at a scuttle, throwing himself up the stairs with the joy of exploration and, when he tumbles to the bottom, simply starting again until he makes it to the top.
. He has spent most of his twenties trying, and nothing ever worked out the way it was supposed to. It’s fine for people like Ron and Hermione, giving out their advice when they both found the right one when they were still at school.
“No, but thanks,” Harry says, unsure whether to laugh or retch. “I think… I think I saw Malfoy.”
,” Harry says. “I didn’t know you’d buggered off. Anyway… oh, look—they’re coming back!”
“Well, in that case, I might know a few people who would love to see a Christmas play,” he says. “And if you’re good and eat all your vegetables, I will ask them tomorrow.”
“Gravy boat… erm…
Harry opens his eyes, staring at the small clock on the bedside without really seeing it. Until he does see it, and a jolt of panic makes him sit up straight.
The moment the doors are closed, Harry reaches for Draco, pushing him back against the nearest metal pole and catching his shiver when the cold surface touches his skin. He unbuttons Draco’s shirt with fumbling fingers, yanking it off his shoulders so he can press his mouth to the pale skin. Draco shudders and Harry smiles against his chest, nipping at his collarbone with his teeth, raking his fingers over skin dusted with tiny, unexpected freckles, rubbing thumbs over hipbones under denim and groaning to feel the damp patch when he presses his palm against Draco’s cock.
“Draco!” Pansy calls, her voice carrying easily from the studio to the kitchen, where Draco is making coffee with his replenished and more carefully hidden secret stash. “You will be so fucking sorry if you miss this!” she yells, louder now, and Draco picks up the cups and hurries along the corridor.
“Of course you can,” Draco murmurs, eyes hazy with need, breath coming quickly now. “We’ve waited long enough. Please.”
His hand flattens protectively against Draco’s back as the thoughts of suspicion and accusation creep into his head and steal like ice through the contentment in his heart.
“Dad likes music you can dance to,” Luna says, gently prodding Mr Abernathy away from the package when he appears from nowhere and starts to pull at the string.
Amused, Harry takes his cup and saucer and attempts to put Draco out of his head, at least for a little bit. He feels accepted by these ladies and he doesn’t want to think about how they would feel if they knew he had upset Draco. The disappointment of a little old lady is a powerful thing, and he has seen men much stronger than himself crumble beneath it.
“Well, I’ll definitely be there,” Harry says.
“Ah, yes, I see the resemblance now,” Mr Borteg nods, apparently untroubled by Hugo’s presence at a double crime scene.
voice is unmistakeable. Intrigued, she creeps along the edge of the stream, holding her bag tightly against her side and ducking behind each tree she encounters. The conversation seems to have stopped dead, and when she finally lays her eyes on them, she knows why.
“You mean this happened last night and you’re only telling me about it now?” he asks, quietly horrified.
“Stanley!” cries a girl with long, dark hair, and the boy sitting next to her beams.
Draco sighs, hands tightening around the wheel as though he is fighting the temptation to pull the bus into a violent swerve in the hope that Harry will slide off his chair and onto the floor. Of course, he could be over-thinking it.
Harry flushes and looks down at his borrowed shoes.
Draco smiles at her, caught between pride and astonishment. “For you and Esmee, I will make space.”
Mr Jennings pales, quickly forcing out a bark of laughter. “Me? Don’t be ridiculous.”
money?”
“Hello, Harry,” Eilish says, waving from her chair and seemingly trying to pretend she hadn’t been sticking her finger through the gaps in the cage for the mouse to lick.
Barely an hour has passed before clever old Florean himself walks into the shop.
“Dare I ask what was in that box?” Mr Jennings asks, fixing Harry with curious dark eyes.
Now that the interior of the shop is visible, he can see that every person and every surface is covered in thick black soot. Whirling particles seem to fill the air, creating the effect of a noxious smoke that all of them seem to be inhaling with every breath.
“You don’t skate?” he asks, grinning. “Or you won’t? Or you
“He’s definitely forty. I remember him moaning about it,” Draco says. “He didn’t want to get old, but then Felicity threw a party for him and he cheered up a bit.”
He sits at the edge of his duck pond until the light has completely faded from the sky. His fingers turn cold and numb and he just tucks them underneath himself, ignoring his shivers and staring at the water. The ducks flock around him, curious at first, but eventually lose interest and retreat into clumps of rushes to settle for the night. They never really took to the fancy house he bought from Harry. It stands there, empty and overpriced and ridiculous in the moonlight and Draco scowls at it. It’s so clear now that all of this insanity has been an excuse to spend time with Harry, and he hates it.
“Stop telling me what I know,” Draco says crossly, and kisses him.
“And how many have been
“Do you really think she’s going to believe that line about ‘an unexpected opportunity for work experience’?” Harry asks as they pass the Old Trout. Gertie’s voice is clearly audible even above the wind and rain, and the windows of the little pub glow invitingly with soft, yellow light.
“Maybe,” Draco says, but he doubts that all the speculation in the world will help to solve the mystery that is Potter. Not that Draco finds him mysterious, he’s just... Draco sighs. “Oh, look at that. Time for the news.”
“Really?”
Harry turns to look at him and is immediately caught by the way his hair gleams almost golden in the lamplight. Shivering, he finally finds his voice.
The woman in the little office sighs heavily when she sees them, but when Harry shows her the little vial, there’s no mistaking the tiny flicker of interest in her eyes. She gets to her feet and drags a Pensieve out of a tall cupboard, then takes the vial from Harry and pours out the contents. For long seconds, Harry and Draco wait, breathing rough in the silence, and then she emerges.
Just then, the bus gives an enormous lurch and takes a corner at speed, causing Harry to stumble, crashing to the floor on his hands and knees, and the thing which has been shaken free of Eilish’s trumpet to scuttle under the table.
“Of course you can,” Draco says, pulling away with a smile that makes Harry’s cock jump in his hand. “I’m not going anywhere, are you?”
Harry nods. He really hopes that Florean cannot read his mind. He doesn’t particularly want anyone rummaging through his thoughts, but there is something very
“We all got one,” Shan says, and he turns, puzzled. “The note,” she explains, and Harry realises that he is still holding the little piece of paper.
Draco nods and laces their fingers together. “Come on. There’s a little van up here that sells the strangest and most fantastic ice cream.”
“He knows how to behave now,” Draco assures, and while the man doesn’t seem completely convinced, he slowly turns his back on Needle and pulls out a scrap of parchment.
“Ooh, like the Egyptian chap with the wonderful beard,” Danica almost sighs.
Draco smiles against his mouth and slips his tongue against Harry’s, hot and soft and over too soon. Harry gasps, woodsmoke and spices and lemons, feeling the blood rush away from his head to press his cock, already needy and aching, against his fly. He knows that the people near the fire can’t see them, but he can hear their voices and smell their food and he doesn’t know if he is terrified or if he wants Draco right now on this frozen hillside.
“Your mother bought me those bloody boxers,” Harry mutters, but Draco is laughing so hard that he opts to cover his eyes and quietly die with shame.
“Can boys have boyfriends?” Caroline asks curiously.
Florean pales. “That can’t be true.”
“The only place you should be running to is to your bed,” he says, peering at Harry so closely that the bobble of his Christmas hat falls into his face. “And even then, I would recommend a much slower pace.”
“Yes,” Harry says, wondering what else he’s going to be asked to deliver.
The thing is, Luna doesn’t
“Why not?”
She seems to weigh almost nothing, even with the additional mass of Montague, who insists on being scooped up along with her. They proceed back through the entrance hall and out to the bus, pressed together for stability. Draco locks the front door with his wand. When Ida is safely laid in a quickly-Transfigured armchair with her friends fussing over her, Draco starts up the bus.
“Stop panicking and drink your tea,” Draco says, passing him a hot cup and leaning against him for the briefest of moments.
“Good.” Rose smiles and then wrinkles her nose. “You know how I’ve got you coming, and Mummy and Daddy, and Grandma and Grandad, and Uncle Fred and Uncle George and Auntie Angelina?”
“Have you got one?”
“You’ve been asleep,” Corrie says. “You’ve been snoring.”
Louis frowns. “Les poissons?”
Draco nods. “Would you like some paints, Stanley? And a canvas, perhaps?”
Back at number twelve, Harry turns the shower up as hot as he can stand and scrubs every inch of himself, sluicing his skin over and over until the water that runs into the drain is clear rather than grey. It takes three washes to cleanse the last of the sticky soot from his hair and he has to admit defeat on his fingernails but when he steps out of the shower, he finally feels clean. In the kitchen, he makes tea and crumpets and then settles in front of the fire to wrap his presents. With the charity parcels clear in his mind, he abandons his usual haphazard process and takes his time, using a combination of magic and careful folding to encase each gift in a neat layer of shiny paper. He conjures ribbons to suit each recipient, choosing raw silk for Hermione, red glitter for Rose, a floral print for Molly and a pattern of tiny swans for Draco.
“So, what’s the difference between distilling a regular whisky and a firewhisky?” Arthur asks, sipping his sparkling wine and staring at Mr Borteg in the way that old ladies stare at Celestina Warbeck.
“Aren’t you coming through, Harry?” Molly asks, and her tone makes Harry scramble through the fireplace without a second thought.
Harry looks at Ida, who merely smiles at him and nods.
“Not you,” he mutters when Derek flaps and wags his tail at the other side of the pond.
Harry smiles, suddenly aware of how much he misses his niece when she’s not around. He loves spending time with her and he hates the way Hermione is always right. He’s wanted a family of his own for as long as he can remember, but the very last thing he needs is another relationship. Everything is great the way it is, and it isn’t as though he hasn’t
Harry and Draco exchange weary glances.
Ron nods slowly. “He’s weird, isn’t he? Has he always been weird?”
“It’s lunchtime. Currywurst on me?”
Sam leans back in his chair. “I’m sure it is, but we don’t have the spare cash for something like that.”
“Sorry,” Harry mumbles, but he doesn’t let go straight away.
Harry shakes himself and smiles at her. “Yes, please.”
“Time to go, everyone,” Sam calls as a murmur of interest passes through the crowds.  “Remember what Luna said. Burst their eardrums if you have to.”
“You don’t understand anything,” Draco snaps. “It’s—”
“So, have you met the other driver?”
Draco doesn’t seem to hear him; he is absorbed in a spell that pours gentle blue flames into the three copper bowls that sit opposite the bed in place of a traditional hearth and mantel. The room is soon filled with soft, flickering light, allowing Harry to see the iron bed frame, the fresh white sheets, and Draco’s collection of salvaged furniture. A swathe of voile hangs over the open window, fluttering in the cold breeze and forming a hazy film over the night sky.
“Yes, yes, it’s fine,” Draco is saying, and as Harry watches, the glowing green eyes turn to fix on him.
“You could be, if you’d turned up in time for lunch,” Mary Ann says mildly. “It’ll all have been gobbled up by now, though. Strawberry it was, as well.”
Harry takes the pen, wrapping his fingers around the cool, smooth barrel. “Is that so?”
Quietly impressed, he sinks down until the water laps at his chin, closing his eyes and breathing in the aromatic steam. Soon, all the tension has left his body and he is floating, lost in the stillness of the water and the warm cast iron at his back. This, he tells himself sleepily, is how to spend a Saturday. When he opens his eyes again, the water is lukewarm and his fingers have turned wrinkly.
He has ignored that, he has ignored the uncomfortable fullness of his bladder, and he can ignore an enormous, vibrating cat on his chest. He can do it, because he’s so perfectly content with the morning sunlight streaming in through the window, setting the copper bathtub aflame and warming his bare skin. All he needs to do is…
“I’ve seen him,” Otis says proudly. “But it would be nice to see him again.”
“Top floor. Editor’s office. I’ll let him know you’re coming.”
Harry wants to point out that she, too, is in a shop
“Yeah. I said it was scratched but I did try,” Harry says.
“I didn’t mind,” he says at last. “Not really. It’s not as though I’ve had much time for a proper relationship and sometimes it was sort of nice to just be able to go out for a night with someone. I met some interesting people and everyone always seemed to get a kick out of my stories about the weird ones. You’re both mad but I don’t think I’d have changed any of it.”
He sighs. “They’re all over… forty?” he offers. “I’m not really sure about Reuben.”
“Yes. Stranded, are you?” he repeats, raising an inquiring eyebrow.
“Not in the way you’re thinking,” she says. “Not to me. But everyone else is... everyone’s looking, Harry. You’ve got to say something.”
“Look who I found!” the boy laughs, and suddenly, Stanley is surrounded by young faces and bright eyes.
Harry looks around, but the windows are steamed up and offer no clues.
With a little sigh that usually means ‘well, that’s a bit boring’, he picks up his cup and turns to look out over the stream, the trees, and the bracken-covered peaks in the distance.
Draco looks at the ground. “Because… I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but… if we get my coat and go out the front way, Needle will know I’m going somewhere without him, and he will be cross.”
“From what I can see, there seems to be some contention over who first laid eyes on...” Draco squints and adjusts the lenses on the Eye. “... I believe it’s a skull of some kind... possibly goat... definitely deceased. The stallholder looks positively thrilled to bits, a crowd is beginning to form, and the ladies in question are not quite ready to concede defeat. If you are in law enforcement or perhaps just want to have a look, this incident is taking place on the south side of the market, just outside Flourish and Blotts. I’ll stay with this on the Eye in the Sky, meanwhile, over to Pansy with the news at quarter past eight.”
“Looking after our son?” Hermione sighs.
“Memories can be altered,” Harry mumbles, and he and Hermione exchange a significant glance that he doesn’t quite understand.
At least most of the time. The listeners’ comments, he could quite happily do without, but according to the head of the network, ‘dialoguing’ is as essential to his show as the snappish banter between himself and Pansy, and the relentlessly upbeat music that seeps without his permission into every part of his consciousness. Far too often these days, he’ll find himself humming—or worse, singing—along to the record he’s playing, and Pansy has developed an infuriating habit of leaning over stealthily and clicking on his omnivox so that his contribution is broadcast across the network. On the last such occasion, he had wreaked revenge by casting a hex that had replaced her refined tones with a broad cockney accent, but she still reaches for the button when she thinks he’s not looking.
“You could go and say hello to her,” Mr Jennings says, expression turning exasperated. “She must be shaken, though she’s insisted on opening as usual.”
“Fine,” he says, setting down his empty cup and getting to his feet. “I’ll have a bath.”
A smile tugs at one corner of his mouth in defiance to his grumpy weariness. “I wouldn’t.”
“Her papers will be very well protected,” she says, dark eyes sparkling.
He pulls the curtain across and slumps into his chair, head in his hands. Harry wades through the sea of newspapers and sits in the conductor’s seat.
According to Hermione, Rose is already asking after ‘Mr Bus’, and it’s only a matter of time before Draco hears from Angelina’s team coach and everyone in his life becomes connected by tentative, sparkling threads, like the web of some chaotically scheming spider.
After what feels like a minute or two later, a loud horn sounds outside the cabin and they both jump. When Harry glances at the clock, he sees that William is actually dead on time, and he laughs. Partly because perfect punctuality has always escaped him, and partly because of what Draco is wearing. Somehow, he has managed to Transfigure the tweedy ladies’ suit into a pair of trousers, the cuffs of which are tucked into his very first pair of wellington boots. One of the enormous knitted jumpers has been altered to fit his slender frame, and the combination of the fierce red wool and Draco’s supremely uncertain expression is too much for Harry.
“But difference is good,” she tells Mr Abernathy, flipping over to the next page of her book. “If we were all the same, then life wouldn’t be beautiful, or frightening, or fun. That’s what my dad always says.”
“That was a very long time ago,” Harry says, but he is already jumping down from the counter, scribbling ‘back soon’ on a piece of parchment and sticking it to the door.
“Did you?” Harry asks, puzzled.
To his astonishment, Draco takes the crackleball. He turns it over in his hands and inspects its lacy coating.
Draco turns slowly, pinning Harry with eyes that seem to glow in the gloom. Harry opens his mouth and then shuts it again, eventually deciding to bite on his thumbnail in an effort to keep any further words in. When Draco crosses the stone floor in three strides and grabs his wrist, he forgets to breathe.
The other thing that goes without saying, of course, is that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are in love with each other. Unfortunately, neither one of them is going to do anything about it, and she’s not sure if that’s entirely due to stubbornness or if it’s just possible that they don’t actually know it.
The women look up from their examination of the hamper and beam. “We’ll take two.”
“You know, insects and dinosaurs probably co-existed,” Ivy says, reminding Draco forcefully of Hermione Granger. Perhaps there’s one in every group.
“Who was it?” Harry asks, heart speeding unpleasantly.
She thinks they might, just might, be flirting.
“We’ve only got a couple of minutes, Ida,” Draco says, dissolving his own charm with a flick of the wrist. He glances at Harry.  “Hmm?”
Draco stares at her as though surprised to see her there. He frowns. “The swan, of course.”
He gathers up the string and sets it down on the table, feeling all four pairs of eyes on him.
“What about him?”
Montague jumps into his lap and licks his hands until he allows them to relax. Slowly, he strokes the silky coat and lets his breath out in a messy rush. He looks around at them all, at their kind eyes and wrinkled faces and knows there are no words good enough.
With the help of food, caffeine, and a gulp of hangover potion from the back of his bathroom cabinet, Harry makes it onto the bus by mid-morning. Despite his hot shower, the scent of Draco’s hair and clothes lingers in his nostrils, catching him unawares at regular intervals and making his heart skip.
“I suppose I’d better,” she sighs. “Be careful, Harry, those things can have your arm off.”
“Can I talk to you for a minute?” he asks, and Draco turns slowly.
“No! I just…” Harry pauses, wondering how the conversation got derailed so quickly. “I’m not bringing anyone to the wedding that you wouldn’t want… anyone that… without asking you all… and Draco and I, it’s…”
“At all,” Draco says, and he throws the lot into the fire. “As for you,” he says, turning to Harry, “My inks are from Scriveners—I’ll make you a list. And the next time you try that, I will let Stanley paint all over
“Harry, I’ve just had a robbery,” Mr Jennings says, voice strained. Harry doesn’t correct him. “I don’t think this is the time to be spending money on new stock.”
Carefully, they pick their way through the debris and weave around the people who are now attempting to clear up the cobbles. Harry unlocks the door with a spell and blasts the worst of the dust out into the street. He steps into the shop and looks around by wandlight, searching behind the counter while Draco checks the stockroom. Finding nothing, Harry pushes on into the back room, shivering and inhaling the damp stench of neglect that seems woven into the furniture. The room is so cold and miserable that Harry almost feels sorry for Mr Jennings, but the memory of Shan and Esmee and their empty display case is more than enough to drive the feeling away.
“It’s Christmas here, too,” Florean points out, hauling his holdall over his shoulder and setting out into the swarm. “Come on, we need to find the stairs.”
“I thought perhaps we could go over…” Draco looks at Rose and lowers his voice, “the investigation this evening, after she’s gone home. I assume she’s going to be here for the rest of the week now that she’s on holiday from school, and I don’t want to alarm her with talk of… unpleasantness.”
Harry nods and accepts a small, leather bound book filled with photographs of a grinning dark-haired woman who looks so much like her mother and is clearly in possession of her bright spirit.
“At this rate, it’ll be you next,” Ron says, just loudly enough for Harry to hear.
“I’m going to buy three!” counters one of the shop assistants from Flourish and Blotts, glaring and reaching into her handbag.
“Are you sure?” Mr Barleycorn mutters, clearly unconvinced.
“Maybe it’s time someone else gave it a go. Like you.”
“I’ll give it a go,” Harry says, smiling at her and stuffing a piece of sausage into his mouth.
Draco smiles grimly. “Aren’t you glad you aren’t famous?”
Harry wakes at first light, groaning as he remembers his argument with Draco and then brightening at the thought of a possible solution. He dresses warmly and Apparates into a silent, frosty field less than half a mile from his destination. A short walk will do him good, and besides, the morning is beautiful, clear blue sky, the scent of winter on the breeze, and cold enough to turn Harry’s face numb within seconds.
“Do you honestly think he didn’t read every book about swans he could find?” Ron says. “Like… the second he decided he was going to keep Needle?”
Rose follows his gaze. “Jelly babies.”
Mr Abernathy pokes his beak into the spine of her book and she looks up, startled to realise that the sky is almost completely dark. Out here the stars are clearly visible and she tips back her head, scanning for the constellations and naming them out loud. Finally, she tucks her notebook away and heads for the house. It isn’t until halfway through dinner that she realises she has forgotten all about her plans for Harry and Draco.
“I heard it took down the Minister in the middle of a meeting.”
“Sorry, Mr Borteg,” Harry says almost in a whisper. He’s not entirely certain whether loud arguments can hurt barrels of maturing whisky, but he’d rather not take the chance.
“Should I tell her?” he whispers.
When Mr Borteg stops talking, a comfortable peace fills the little wooden cocoon of the shop. For several seconds, all Harry can hear is the scratching of Rose’s pencil crayons and the howl of the wind up and down the alley.
“Draco said no to the window boxes,” Corrie says, lips pursed.
“Oh, don’t think so hard—that’s how you get wrinkles,” someone says, and Harry looks up, realising that he has been staring at the cobbles for rather too long.
“All of it.”
Stanley runs onto another page of homework, creating an impressive swirling pattern by turning in chaotic circles, and it takes a moment for Harry to realise that he has managed to step in blue ink with his left three legs and green with his right.
Unfortunately, that part disappears altogether when the noisy part crashes into his bedroom and shakes him awake with no regard for the fog in his head or the fact that it is clearly the middle of the night. The noisy thing sits on the edge of his bed and catches his hand when he reaches for his wand.
“No one has called me by my last name for well over a decade, Draco,” Harry says pointedly.
“Thank you. Perhaps I’ll just have one more go,” Draco says, giving the ice a severe look.
“That’s right. I go in every night at about eleven o’clock and have a sherry before bed,” Jean says, lighting her pipe. “Just the one bottle, mind, I’m not much of a drinker.”
“So did I,” Sam says, rubbing a hand over his face to hide the smile that Luna sees anyway.
“It’s not Christmas Day,” Ida says, scandalised. Pauses. “It’s not, is it?”
“I have no idea!” Draco admits. He steps into the lift and presses the button for the basement, tipping his head onto one side and then the other. He feels as though Mr Fortuna is still bellowing into his face, and it’s rather disconcerting.
“It’s strong beer,” William says. “It’ll blow your bloody head off. Youse should try it.”
Draco steps close, resting his hands on Harry’s hips. “We could leave.”
“I’m pretty sure you’re still an idiot,” Harry says, and Draco swerves the bus so that he has to hang onto his seat in order to avoid falling off. Several strawberries shoot out of the newspaper compartment and pelt into his glasses.
“They’re nice people, Draco,” Harry says, unsure why he’s pushing the point.
He takes a deep breath. “Where’s Draco?”
“Don’t interfere with my bus, Harry,” Draco says, and though his voice is stern, there is a flicker of humour in his eyes that both confuses and intrigues Harry.
Harry laughs. “Thanks, but if you want to see a really impressive one, you should go to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. Theirs is enormous and the decorations sing.”
She turns. “Of course.”
He wakes to a dark sky and a room softly illuminated by the lights on his Christmas tree. Feeling restored, he checks the time and then runs himself a bath, stretching out in the hot, fragrant water and scrubbing at his nails with a brush until even Draco couldn’t find fault with them. Conscious of Molly’s worries about formal dress, he avoids his sparse collection of smart clothes and chooses plain dark trousers and a fine-knit red sweater without any holes. He puts on his coat and gazes at his reflection with vague dissatisfaction. His hair is waving and spiking all over the place and he’s never going to look stylish, but maybe it doesn’t matter. Maybe Draco can take care of that end of things and he can… well, he can do something, he tells himself, forcing himself out into the cold night before he can think himself into a corner.
Harry groans and drops his head into his hands.
“Well, that’s brilliant!” she declares. “When can we meet him?”
Draco shakes his head, all at once clobbered by the vivid sense memory of that kiss—the warmth of Harry’s mouth, the strong fingers in his hair, all of it just another attempt to misdirect the reporters and the photographers and the editors who care about nothing more than giving the people what they want, and for a moment he feels sorry for Harry. Just for a moment, though, because this whole thing is a game to him, and he’ll be fine. He always is.
“He’s with my mother, in her bedroom. They both seemed unnerved by the situation, so they’ve holed up in there with tea and her quilting project.”
Draco looks at him. “I hardly think we’ll have to chase them.”
He has a pretty good idea already, but just in case, he summons an atlas from the bookshelf. It lands on the hearthrug with a thump and he flicks through the pages until he finds it, and there it is, a small country in the north-east of Africa. Thousands of miles away from London, from the chaotic route of the Knight Bus, and from Draco.
When Grace weaves across the stage, iridescent jellyfish ribbons swaying, all six of them wave, grin and give thumbs-up in various combinations. The little girl beams in surprise and waves back, adding an extra twirl and a little bow. At the front of the stage, Rose steps forward.
“I thought I was your favourite!” Ron protests, grinning.
“Yes, Draco,” Harry says calmly. He sets Stanley on the carpet and prods him gently with his foot in the direction of the table. “Why don’t you go and help?”
Grinning, everyone but Harry raises a hand, while he merely buries his head in his. Draco joins in, too, but Luna can see his anxiety as if it were written across his face.
By the time Ron and Hermione come home, the Christmas holidays are almost over, and their summer clothes make Harry laugh when they tumble out of their Portkey into foot-deep snow. Hermione hugs him so tightly that he almost can’t breathe. Ron eyes Draco with caution and shakes his hand before folding Harry in arms that have definitely grown stronger over the last few months. Hermione hesitates for a moment and then hugs Draco, too, startling him into complete inaction. Harry knows there is work still to be done, but a month of midnight firecalls has forged a promising start.
“Quite right,” Eilish says. “Draco is your friend. He rescued you. What have those two ever done for you?”
“You look tired,” he says. He can’t help it.
“Maybe you’ll be a roof-mending... person,” he says. “And what of it?”
“You came over here to bring me chocolate?” he asks, frowning.
Harry sits up, realising that he is still fully clothed and hopelessly creased. On the plus side, though, he actually feels better. Restored by several hours of sleep, the strange lightness has left his body, his head is clear and his limbs seem to belong to him again. He is also ravenous, stomach protesting noisily as he scrambles to the end of the bed to peer at Ron.
The ladies nod, and Harry doesn’t think he imagines the tiniest flicker of remorse on Danica’s face. Draco boots Montague gently towards the table and sits in his leather chair, releasing the handbrake and nudging the bus back onto the road.
“Well, tea is very important and I imagine that everyone is just trying to look after you.”
Draco snorts. “She brought both of them up from a very young age, but who knows. I don’t know what goes on in their heads and I don’t want to.”
“Harry is just about to tell me why he doesn’t want to go out with Marius,” Hermione says.
Good grief.
Draco blinks. At last he looks properly at the parchments in Harry’s hands, the ones scattered across the floor, and then at Stanley, who is hiding underneath the coffee table looking uncharacteristically subdued.
“Everything’s ruined,” Shan says, and Esmee looks close to tears.
He grabs the black bread and stuffs it into his mouth, chewing rapidly with his eyes tightly shut until finally he swallows, holds his hand out for his mulled mead and performs a little bow. The room explodes into applause. Harry jumps when Ginny wolf-whistles right next to his ear. Bill abandons his sombre role momentarily to give his brother the thumbs-up.
“No, he didn’t. I just… haven’t felt much like eating. I promise, it’s nothing to do with the crackleball. In fact, it looks lovely,” he says, taking the ball from his pocket and examining it.
“Oh, yes, he was in the shallow end at the time. Never did hear the end of it, though.”
“You did,” Harry says, wanting to hug him but offering his hand instead. Draco shakes it, freezing cold fingers wrapping tightly around Harry’s. “I’m sorry I made fun of your restaurant. The menu actually looks very nice.”
Draco meets his eyes. “Go on.”
“As I’m sure you all know by now, we have suffered two incidents of theft in the last few days. The security of our community here in Diagon Alley has been threatened, and we cannot allow it to continue.” Florean looks around, severe expression softening as he catches the eyes of Mrs Purley. “We must protect one another. I have called this meeting to hear your ideas, your thoughts, your worries. The floor is yours.”
“I’m going to go and get you that Pepper-up now,” Draco says, putting on his coat. “You’re going to drink it, and then, because I know you’re too stubborn to go home and rest, we are going to sit here and figure out what to do next.”
She gets up and hands it to him. It’s her last one. “Don’t forget to bite the head off.”
“There should never be biting,” Otis says, sounding scandalised.
“Harry,” Draco says suddenly, and he turns. “Please don’t stay away. We all liked having you here. I shouldn’t have ruined it.”
“I don’t know why you’d think I know anything about flagpoles, Harry,” she says calmly, and then, gathering her bag, she walks out of the office.
“It was an arrangement, that’s all. I helped them to pass some of their classes and they helped me to not have the shit beaten out of me,” Draco says, offering the words easily and without emotion.
“I don’t know,” Harry says, addressing Ron, and then, turning to Hermione: “I
Draco leans back in his leather chair and laughs. “You started it.”
“We can’t,” he says softly, and Harry aches.
“That means it’s accidental magic,” Otis says, leaning over to her. “You did it! You’ll definitely get your Hogwarts letter now.”
“I’m not in the business of hurting people, Harry. I’m just asking that you take care. Draco cares deeply for you, and there is nothing in the world I care more about than Draco.”
“Thank you,” Draco says gravely. He glances at Harry. “Perhaps you could retrieve that… package from Florean by yourself.”
He takes his opportunity during a brief lull to hang more baubles, enjoying the relative stillness and catching his breath. As Mr Borteg serves the last couple of customers in the shop, Harry takes the almost-empty box back behind the counter and pulls off his hat, rubbing at his damp forehead with the back of his hand. In a flash of inspiration, he hits the hat with a cooling charm and replaces it, smiling when the fabric touches his skin and sends a wave of freshness across his scalp.
“Oh, she’s coming. I think she’s in a state of excitement about cooking breakfast for everyone… you know, like we’re all home again.”
“We will be open,” Reuben says, and his staff murmur their agreement.
“It should,” he says, fingers sliding slowly in and out until Harry is hard and flushed against his belly. “It’s you.”
“That’s so cool,” Magnus offers, and Harry and Draco look at each other, startled.
“Is he here?” Ron bellows from the kitchen, and Hermione rolls her eyes.
“I need things!” Eliza declares, tacking her way towards the prop chest on a rather wobbly path.
“What did they take?” he asks at last.
“I’m here. Draco called me. He’ll be back in a minute,” Harry says, trying not to draw attention to the fact that he isn’t wearing shoes.
The sky outside is bright and dazzling with snow by the time the meeting starts to wind down.
When they start to sing, everyone falls silent. Esmee emerges first, radiant in sunshine yellow. She clutches her bouquet and holds her father’s arm as she walks, looking ageless and beautiful. Like Esmee, her father is tall, but the similarities end there. He is broad and almost as pale-skinned as Mr Borteg, with fine silvery hair that falls to his shoulders and a proud grin that seems to spread to everyone who sees it. Harry notices that she is wearing one of the amber earrings, and he wonders what happened to the other one until he sees Shan, approaching from the other direction on the arm of a delighted-looking Florean.
“He was here the other day,” Harry says suddenly. “Jennings, I mean. Remember, when Rose was reading her story? Needle was being really fussy and you had to settle him down.”
When Harry walks in behind him, her eyes grow entertainingly wide, but to her credit, she continues reading the news without a hitch, including the story about the unexpected fireworks that had mysteriously appeared over Diagon Alley the previous morning.
The whole thing is an exercise in futility, anyway, he tells himself, vanishing the dust and debris he has collected and then starting all over again. He doesn’t need a Draco in his life, and Draco certainly doesn’t need him. He’s beyond useless at all of that stuff, and just because Draco makes him feel… the way he does, doesn’t mean that any of it is a good idea. Breathing hard, he starts a third round of sweeping and doesn’t look up when Mr Borteg pops up from behind the counter.
“Alright,” Eilish says, wafting her stack of cards in the air. “Time to exchange!”
As night falls, Harry wanders around his house without purpose, drifting from room to room in search of something that will settle the chaos in his head. In the end, he deposits himself in a weary heap on the hearth rug, and after a couple of hours of shivering, he gathers the wherewithal to light the fire in the grate. When his stomach begins to protest his lack of attention, he grabs a tin of biscuits for cheese and eats them dry until his tongue is sore and his throat is arid.
“It’s very pretty. And slippy.”
Draco sighs. “That was what we non-Gryffindors call a 'lie'.”
Needle stretches out his long neck and rises to his full height, giving off an air of challenge. Harry sighs. He looks at the clock. It’s just after eleven. Sage must be open by now, and perhaps the swan has just followed one of the diners out of the restaurant and wandered off in search of adventure. Why he has chosen Borteg’s for that purpose remains a mystery, but Draco must be missing him.
“I don’t know,” Harry says, “but maybe it’ll feel better if we put your other driver on display.”
Approaching the front of the bus, he waits for Ron to step off and then goes to lean in.
Ron snorts and Harry catches the exact moment that he accidentally bites down on one of the floating things. He hides a smile and sips obediently at his soup as Hermione watches him. There’s something particularly…
“You should tell him,” Danica says, dropping a crumb of cake into Harry the mouse’s cage.
Monday is the first day of Rose’s Christmas holiday, and she is dropped off at number twelve by Ron and Hermione, both of whom look tired and rather guilty.
Twenty minutes later, the atmosphere in the kitchen is rather strained. Hugo, either through hunger or boredom, has become tearful, and Rose’s best efforts to cheer him have fallen flat. Molly is pacing, looking out of the window every couple of minutes and repeatedly asking Arthur if she should Floo to Diagon Alley and look for her son.
Something ripples on the surface of the water and Draco’s stomach turns. Without another word, he forces himself over the muddy grass and down to the edge of the lake. A second tentacle breaches the surface and he thinks he might just be sick. The Giant Squid is always hungry, and a Stanley-sized treat would probably go down very nicely, especially if it were to leap into the lake so willingly. Horror-struck, Draco stares at the swirling water for a fraction of a second and then wades in, wincing at the temperature, shoes slipping on mounds of shifting pebbles. He’s going to have to go in, and he’s going to have to do it now. The water is freezing and heavy with algae and he’s not entirely convinced that the squid won’t eat him, too, but he has to get Stanley back. He has to.
“Does that mean she died?” asks Otis.
Mouth dry, he mumbles, “Come in,” and Draco follows him inside in silence.
“I didn’t mean to upset you. In fact, I couldn’t understand why you were upset until I went over to Ron and Hermione’s last night and we talked about it.”
That night, when Rose has been packed off to bed, he sits cross-legged on Ron and Hermione’s hearth rug and fills them in on the investigation. Florean might have said not to tell anyone else, but as far as Harry is concerned, ‘tell no one’ has always meant ‘just tell Ron and Hermione’. They are both incredibly trustworthy people, and besides, he doesn’t think he could keep a secret from them if he tried.
“I’m not under any illusions about it,” Ginny says nonchalantly. “But it would be nice to get out of the shop for a little bit... really do something. And flying in the actual stadium where they won the cup five times in the last ten years...”
“I’m not going to talk about this,” he says, folding the paper and handing it back to Pansy.
“Ice cream?” Benny repeats, and for a moment, all three boys stare up at Draco with wide eyes, and then they are gone, scuttling towards the dining room as though chased by Drenglebacked Gloonpuffers.
“I’m going to go now,” he says firmly. “Needle will have to listen to your horrible jokes.”
Draco walks out into the street, shading his eyes from the afternoon sun.
“It was just a bit of basic ballet, for heaven’s sake,” Draco mutters, but Harry has never been one to give in easily.
Harry’s eyes snap to his, and this time the thrill of recognition is overpowering. The man now regarding him from a battered leather armchair, one hand resting on the wheel and the other wrapped around a mug of tea, is unmistakeably Draco Malfoy.
Draco gives him a filthy look and bites into his toastie. Harry does the same, looking over at Rose to see that she has finished hers and resumed work on her project. She doesn’t make another peep until almost four o’clock, when she shuffles her papers and announces that she has finished. The shop is quiet, its only customer being Mr Jennings, who has come in search of a good Christmas rum, and he, Draco, Mr Borteg and Harry gather around solemnly to listen. Needle tacks an unsteady course across the floor, hissing to himself for no good reason, and Rose sighs.
“Let’s leave Harry alone, shall we?” Arthur suggests. “Let him eat his lunch in peace.”
“Time, Harry,” comes the gloomy voice from the distillery. “The gift of the hours, the chance to make adjustments in the tiniest fractions of a heartbeat.” There is a pause, and then, “A cup of coffee would be nice.”
“I’m a very… do you really think so?” Hermione asks, voice softening.
Finally, the fog clears and Harry remembers. He remembers the fever and the coughing and the fight for breath, and he thinks he remembers leaning against Draco in a forest of sparkling purple lights. It is, however, quite possible that he dreamed that part.
Harry sits down slowly on the edge of the table. “What wards?”
“Don’t,” Draco says suddenly, voice stretched thin.
“Indeed? And may I have one?”
Harry looks at the socks, which are still singing away to themselves. “They’re… the best pair of musical socks I’ve ever seen,” he says at last.
**~*~**
Luna blinks. “Why not?”
“This is horrible, but at least there will be no more stealing,” Daraja says, allowing the snake to flick his tongue over her hand and then returning to her task of cleaning beetles, dunking each one in water and then drying them with her wand.
That night, she persuades Mr Abernathy up onto her balcony and chats to him as she applies a cooling potion to her arms and legs. He brings her a shiny Knut that she suspects has dropped out her own pocket, and she provides several ripe cherries in the hope that he won’t take too hard to being the subject of a few extra-strength Cheering Charms. She really could do with the practise before she starts throwing them around at her colleagues, and her father’s moods are unpredictable enough as it is.
Halfway through the grasses, she sees Sam standing at the garden gate. He looks slightly anxious, but when he sees her, he smiles.
“They won’t fit me, Daddy,” she sighs. “And they’re
“I’ve got the strongest compulsion to buy you a deerstalker,” Harry says, delighted when the stallholder rummages in a box and presents him with one.
Needle continues to trundle around the distillery in search of adventure, tapping at the stone floor with his beak.
“I understand,” Harry says. He finishes his tea and sets the cup down with a clank. “Can I borrow this photograph instead? I’ll owl it back to you.”
“It might be,” Ginny says. “There’s been some confusion.”
Taking a deep breath, he plunges under the water, scanning the murky depths even as his eyes sting and protest. He used to look at this place from his common room all the time. He knows where he is. He can do this, because Stanley needs him. At the sight of a tentacle, he turns, immediately becoming entangled in grasping weeds and losing all the air in his lungs in one terrifying gasp. He flails in the water, eyes still searching for Stanley as he tries to yank himself free. His chest burns and his vision begins to blur but he twists harder, contorting himself until he manages to wriggle free of his jeans and kick off his shoes. With a spike of triumph, he kicks for the surface and then everything turns black.
“Yeah. Hermione went mad, as you can imagine. She says she can’t remember exactly what she said to them, but she had her wand out and she told them to get the fuck off her property... probably not in those exact words. They printed the picture and made her look like some kind of psychopath,” Harry says, and his voice is oddly calm, as though his anger has progressed far beyond blind rage.
…” the socks begin, and he silences them with a violent slash of his wand.
Draco sits beside him, pulling his feet up onto the rock and resting his chin on his knees.
Harry inhales sharply, clutching Hugo to him as something cold prickles through his veins.
She nods. “My grandson usually takes care of things, ye ken, but he’s out of action at the moment, the lazy bugger.”
Not then and not now. She lowers herself to the bank and sits, allowing her feet to dangle in the rippling water as she flips through her book and smiles at her photograph of Draco. It’s her favourite one of him, tacked onto the page with a piece of glittery Spellotape, and shows a struggle between stern disapproval and genuine laughter as two small children leap upon the unsuspecting Draco from behind and almost bear him to the ground. She cannot see the glimmers of colour in the photograph, but she remembers them perfectly from the moment when she took it, standing out in the grounds of the Starlight Home for Children just weeks earlier.
Ron grins. “I thought you might say that. That’s why I bought you a pair as well.”  He reaches into his pocket and presents Harry with an identical pair of woollen socks. “Let’s just check they work.”
Harry feels Draco’s frustration billowing around him like a cloud. He hangs back for a moment, folding the red velvet between his fingers, but when Juno jumps down and trots after Eilish too, he decides to leave him to it.
“Is that a no?” Harry asks, heart sinking.
“Not today.”
As the lights fade in and out, dappling the ice with beautiful blurred colours, they glide together in a dance that fills Harry with fresh, cold life and sweeps him clean of everything but
“Isn’t he pretty?” she says, beaming. “Thanks, Uncle Harry.”
“There are some wonderful creatures around at this time of year,” she says, tucking away her book and quill and slinging her bag across her shoulders. “Perhaps we’ll catch a glimpse of the giant tomato-eating spider. My father said he saw one once, but I’m not sure I believe him.”
“I’m sorry,” he whispers, gripping his cup a little too tightly.
The moment the doors open and Draco meets his eyes, though, he knows that it did.
As she heads to the kitchen for coffee, Draco eats the sticky pastry slowly and thinks. Being friends with Pansy is a lot like swimming with sharks. Little ones. Baby sharks, perhaps. It’s never boring, but every now and then one of them will grab you and lightly savage you, just for its own entertainment.
“So, this is… different,” he says, and Draco nods.
“Well, I always go to the Burrow—you know, the Weasleys’ place—for Sunday lunch, and I thought you could come with me,” he says, shrugging and trying to brazen it out.
Harry nods, thinking that Hermione would probably have loved one, even as a young child. He looks around the shop at the quills and bottles of ink and neat rolls of parchment.
“Oh! I didn’t… wow,” he mumbles, and he knows that Draco is smiling now.
Feeling rather accomplished, Harry buys himself another cup of coffee and sits down on a bench to examine his purchases. Now the shops are beginning to fill and the sound of festive music is echoing down the street, mixing with the chatter of children and the repetitive calls of the stall-holders all around him. And he’s going to have to fight his way back into that, because he still needs a present for Draco. Of course, what he really wants to give him is time, and with Molly’s help, he is working on that, but the idea of Christmas coming and going without at least a small gift to hand over is a very unappealing one.
Hugo stares up at him, eyes huge and fathomless. After a moment’s thought, he presents Harry with the light-up caterpillar and beams.
“Has he been alright?” Hermione asks, cradling Hugo in one arm and using the other to flick her wand and summon all of Hugo’s toys into a string bag.
“Let’s be swans!” Eliza cries, grabbing Draco’s hand.
“A circle!” she calls, grabbing him by the wrist and pulling him into place.
“Well, that was more violent than I expected,” he says, staggering off the ice and tacking along the cobbles on his skates.
Draco shakes his head. “No, I mean how did it get through the wards?”
Draco snorts. “Don’t be. It’s true enough.”
“Pins and needles or interpretive dance?” Draco asks, stretching until his Christmas jumper rides up, exposing a flicker of pale abdomen.
Draco says nothing, but looks slightly mutinous as he lurches off in his wellington boots, peering about him as though a goat might just pop up out of the ground at any moment. Harry decides to head off in the opposite direction, picking his way through the wild grasses and noting the troughs containing food that do, at least, indicate that the goats might be somewhere around. He smiles at the thought of what Ron and Hermione would say about all of this, and then locks the thought away before it makes him sad. He misses them, and it’s likely that they still think nothing has changed, that he is still at Hogwarts and that Draco Malfoy is simply a person who is no longer the enemy.
“And so we begin,” Florean announces, twirling like a demented ringmaster and Disapparating.
Draco makes an impatient little noise. “Yes, well. Don’t you want to know what the three things are?”
“Don’t knock stubbornness,” Harry says. “I wouldn’t be where I am today if I weren’t so bloody-minded.”
“I promise,” Harry says. “See you later on.”
Hugo blows a small milk bubble and then belches.
“Harry, I don’t know.”
Slowly, he gets to his feet and they slink away as surreptitiously as two men with a small crocodile can manage. Harry doesn’t let go of Draco’s hand until they reach the Magical Menagerie, at which point single file is necessary. He hands Brenda over to a man with a beard who must be Bill, and then pulls Draco into the back room.
When Stanley tacks gently, he gives him one to play with, and all of them watch as he chases it around the floor.
All Harry can really do is hope that’s true, and after everything that has happened this week, he is definitely beginning to believe that anything is possible.
“He’s mine,” Danica says proudly.
It sits there quite nicely, resting on her mass of white curls, and when Draco returns with the camera, he seems satisfied that Corrie is now wearing a hat.
She grabs the others by their cloaks and soon they are all dashing back towards the castle.
Draco stares at him and then at the bottle in his hands. “Harry… that is incredibly thoughtful. I wish I’d made you a bigger scarf.”
Harry wants to shout, but instead, he takes a deep breath and attempts to calm himself.
“I’ve been asking myself the very same question,” Shan says, patting him on the arm and then clomping behind the counter. She puts her arm around Esmee’s waist and sighs. “And then I start wondering, who’s next?”
“Can you see me?”
“You could help,” Draco snaps, turning to Harry with an air of desperation.
“No, but breaking and entering is,” Draco says, and Florean points his wand at the concealed fabric on the floor. “As, in my opinion, is frightening my mother half to death.”
“How very efficient,” she murmurs to herself.
“And where is that?” Draco asks, mouth twitching. “Driving around in a purple bus with a group of old ladies and a reformed idiot?”
He presses the stripe on the new pair, and soon the kitchen is filled with the sound of ‘White Christmas’, both pairs of socks blasting out a different part of the song and neither managing to stay in key.
Harry kicks him in the ankle but Felicity shrugs, anger fading to a simmer.
Harry freezes. “What?”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea,” Ginny says later that night, sitting on the bank of the stream and fending off the clouds of midges with a neat little charm Luna has never seen before.
“I put a few spells in it, just to… I knitted it,” Draco says with a sheepish shrug. “Do you like it?”
“I know,” Harry says, grimacing. “The thing is, though… the family sort of… isn’t… any more. Lucius is dead, Narcissa lives on some sort of commune in Europe, and Draco is alone, driving the Knight Bus pretty much twenty-four hours a day so that these mad old women have somewhere to meet up.”
“I don’t like to be looked at,” Draco says, fiddling with a bunch of basil. “Not any more. It makes me feel exposed. When you do it… it’s different.”
“Thank you,” Harry says, taking the cups with a grateful smile and walking out into a downpour.
After a discussion that lasts long enough to requires three cups of tea and several rounds of cheese on toast, they agree that they will leave Strath Kinna the following morning, giving them just one more day and night before they return to reality.
“I don’t care,” he whispers, closing his eyes. “I don’t care where we go.”
“Blueberry,” Draco says. “He’s a regular, too.”
“And I am,” Harry says, unable to stop himself imagining Molly’s reaction to finding a furious Draco in her fire at seven o’clock in the morning. “Will you just tell me what’s wrong?”
“I suppose,” Harry admits.
“Good advice,” Magnus says. “Once I sat on a wasp’s nest and my bum blew up like a balloon. Like two balloons, I suppose.”
“Both of you.”
“I don’t work here but you’re all welcome as far as I’m concerned,” says a lady in the crowd. “I shop here every week and I’ve loved everything you’ve done this year for the festival.”
“Are you sure you want tips from a failure?” Harry asks.
“How did you manage before I started bringing you lunch?” Draco says lightly.
“Even me?” Harry asks, but he doesn’t listen for the answer.
Louis smiles uncertainly and looks at Ginny, who grins and kisses him on the cheek. The back door bursts open, admitting Arthur, Rose, Hugo, and a wave of cold, crisp air.
“Will it?”
**~*~**
“I know all sorts of things,” Draco says, and then shrugs. “My mother has one. Did you used to have a shop in Bath?”
“That’s... more than I needed to know,” Draco says, wrinkling his nose as his brain forces him to imagine the logistics of such a thing, which leads inevitably to the vivid mental picture of a naked Ronald Weasley.
“Tentacula?” he asks, stepping away and watching the vine retreat innocently.
“How much?” Harry asks. It’s been a long time since he made the front pages, and that suits him just fine.
Eyes fixed on the driver, he drifts out of the conversation around him and waits. After a moment, the bus grinds to a halt in the middle of a quiet residential street and the shadowy figure climbs out of his seat, wand drawn. Carefully, he traces a spell across the purple ceiling, making the air ripple around the chandelier and forming a shimmering barrier across the opening that leads to the stairs. He scrutinises his work for a moment and then lowers his wand, glancing around the bottom deck and meeting Harry’s eyes.
“They’re for eating, of course,” Rose is saying when Harry starts listening again.
“Not yet,” Harry says, and Draco can hear the smile in his voice. “Shall I do the telescope?”
Draco’s eyes hold his for long seconds and then he reads from the notes on his lap.
“So do you,” Luna says, admiring Mary Ann’s ankle length nightdress with its big, bright blooms and tiny little pearl buttons.
Harry looks up from the order form and frowns at him. “You know why.”
“Yes, because I feel like I’m going mad!” Harry says hotly, forcing himself to make eye contact. “I don’t like mind games and I want to know why!”
He knows he has Draco to thank for pulling the team together when he was lying immobile in the hospital wing, but he also knows that Draco will have no mercy on him should the Slytherin team triumph. Apart from any amount of teasing, he is pretty sure that he has agreed to bath Stanley for a month if his team loses. Not that he minds bathing the little bugger, but it’s about honour, and a little bit about teaching people who make bets when other people are mostly asleep a bit of a lesson.
“Do you know what this is?”
“Welcome to Hattersley-Mumble,” Draco says, following them at last.
“Follow the leads where they take you. You have an advantage here in that these people know you. They trust you. The vast majority of them want this to stop.”
Pansy shrugs. “How on earth should I know?”
“And would you all prefer that?” Molly asks, and there’s a tiny wobble in her voice that catches Harry somewhere painful.
Needle ignores him, leaving Harry to summon an empty glass jar and scoop the spider into it before it becomes a snack for a very naughty swan.
“Yeah. She said she could cast a protective bubble over the table so that it’d be like eating outside, inside. It’s really clever.”
“Prevalent in the rural south of England, are they?” Draco asks, following her back into the house.
“Good. Perhaps you could call off my mother,” Draco says. “She hasn’t been back to the Manor since Monday and she won’t stop fussing over me. If she apologises to me again, I think I’m going to stun myself.”
“You both look great,” he says.
“It’s a figurative dress,” Ron says. “Stop fosucking on the wrong thing.”
“I love you, idiot.”
Harry grins. “Want to go and find out what it opens?”
Despite Draco’s best efforts at distraction and a comfortable evening with his friends, Harry finds sleep almost impossible and arrives at the ice cream parlour almost half an hour early. To his relief, Timothy arrives just minutes later with a plan to gather one last piece of evidence, and Harry is happy to do as he is instructed. He takes one end of a roll of what looks like white fabric and helps the officer to lay it over the floor, stretching from the entrance to the counter.
“Anyone they see me with—anyone,” Harry continues, scowling, “They insinuate I’m having some sort of affair with them. Ginny, Luna, Neville... fucking Barry from the pub quiz team I used to belong to. He looks like Hagrid, for god’s sake... if I go out for a drink I’m ‘advocating a party lifestyle’,” he says, freeing one hand from his broom to sketch out vicious air quotes. “I’m ‘being a questionable role model’... if I don’t go out, I’m a shut-in, I’m losing my marbles. When they got wind that I was thinking about doing Auror training, they wrote a piece about how it was strange that I hadn’t had enough of dark magic. When I changed my mind, they wrote that I was a quitter.”
“I’m off to do some detective work—do you want anything bringing back?”
“You’re a leader,” Draco says, pressing his thigh against Harry’s. “When Florean retires, everyone is going to start squashing themselves into Borteg’s once a month.”
Draco meets his eyes for a moment, then smiles and turns to leave. Harry watches him go, stalking across the cobbles with Needle at his heels.
“You didn’t like the owls at Eeylops either, did you?” Harry mumbles, taking the note and glancing at Needle, who had thoroughly disturbed their attempt to interview Jean the previous day by stomping around the shop with his neck stretched out and poking his head everywhere it didn’t belong.
“You needn’t,” Pansy says, rising and clacking past him to select the next record.
“You’ll give yourself a stomach ache,” Draco says suddenly, and when Harry follows his eyes, he realises that he has eaten almost all of the grapes without even noticing.
Luna sets down her mug and rummages in her bag. She retrieves several photographs of Mr Abernathy, which she passes around, reminding everyone to hold them gently and by the edges. By the time she has finished answering questions about him to their satisfaction, the younger children are yawning and Eliza has almost fallen asleep in her lap. Picking her up, Luna directs them to bed and hovers while everyone brushes their teeth and crawls under their blankets. In each room, she casts a silent charm to drape soft stars across the ceiling and wishes them peaceful dreams.
When Pansy arrives, he steels himself for questions, but she merely drops a Danish on his desk and then stomps over to the shelves where the records are kept in search of today’s Song for the Shower. When he gives the date as the twenty-fourth of April instead of the twenty-fourth of May, she just corrects him calmly; when he plays the same record twice in a row, she tells the listeners that he’s getting old, and when he spills coffee on his white shirt, she spells it away without a word.
Florean smiles slowly. “Harry, you know me too well. Let’s just say it’s something… in my area.”
With a feeling of inevitability, Harry looks up and meets Draco’s eyes. “What?”
Draco frowns and replaces the box. “Like I said. I’m browsing.”
Draco catches his smile and very deliberately does not look at him, instead focusing on the empty road ahead. For some reason, Harry can’t tear his eyes away, and soon stops trying, instead settling in his seat and openly admiring Draco’s sharp profile and strong, sure hands.
Ginny frowns, tapping her pencil against the edge of the table. She pauses and grins.
“Productive,” Ivy suggests, doing a poor job of hiding her laughter. In her lap, Stanley tacks and turns in a joyful circle.
“This is pretty fancy for a Wednesday night,” he says, impressed, but as he scans the table more carefully, his heart sinks. “Four plates. Hermione…”
Harry shrugs, relieved when Mrs Purley brings his drinks and then horrified when he remembers that he gave all his money to the collection. Feeling his face burning, he turns to Draco.
“Alright,” Mary Ann says, but Luna doesn’t think she imagines the note of anxiety in her voice.
“This class?”
Harry, Draco, and the rest of the biddies stare at each other for a moment before shrugging and hurrying after her in search of a fish and chip shop with a table for eight.
Draco brightens. “That reminds me.” He pulls a bag from his coat pocket and passes it to Harry. “Timothy gave me this. It’s one of the samples that came back from the Ministry. They tested them all and apparently… it’s some fabric from a sack.”
“Are you listening to a word I’m saying?” Draco demands, and there’s an edge to his tone that pulls Harry’s attention away from his languid examination of the pattern on his empty cup.
He has been chomping on all manner of cakes and biscuits baked by the ladies since he arrived on the Knight Bus, and he is now ashamed that it has taken him so long to think of reciprocating. Still, it’s better late than never, and he knows that for maximum impact, he needs to turn up with his offering before the first tea break of the day. Lacking confidence in his own baking skills, he has decided to head for his favourite patisserie, the charmingly-named ‘Les Deux Magots’.
“Draco, I know what it’s like to want to have control over what people think of you,” Harry says. “You want to have things on your terms, I get it. But the thing is… it just doesn’t work like that, at least not around here. You have to learn to… I don’t know… give less of a shit.”
“He won’t. We have an agreement,” Draco says, reaching down and patting the swan on the head.
“And why do you say that, young lady?”
“I didn’t see you there,” he admits, spelling his hands clean when he realises that he is just making the snake dirtier than before. “Where are the others?”
“I can see that,” Draco says faintly, pulling the gift out of the bag for Harry to see.
“I’m rather relying on you to make sure he leaves,” Florean says.
The next morning, Harry waits in the rain for the Knight Bus to appear, barely noticing the water soaking through to his skin as he fights desperately to take control of the writhing tangle of emotions that has crept around his heart in the night. He’s still angry, there’s no doubt about that, but he’s also hurt and more afraid of this confrontation than he really wants to admit.
“I’ll adapt,” he says, leaning against Harry for a moment and then getting to his feet. “Would anyone like a ride?”
He stops wondering about anything much when their food arrives and the portions are, if anything, even larger than the previous night’s. This time, Draco starts eating immediately and makes a point of finishing all of his vegetables. Gertie, having perhaps learned a lesson when it comes to the alcohol tolerance of eighteen-year-old English boys, draws them one pint of Ginger Rodent each before switching them to water.
Harry draws in a deep breath of cold, smoky air and grins. “Think we’re in a good place?”
“You’re really going to spend a week here?” he asks, completely failing to keep the envy from his voice.
“That’s right,” Mrs Purley says. “I told you loads of times that you needed to look at alternatives to quills. Fashions change, and if you don’t change with them, you might as well give up.”
Harry smiles but says nothing, suspecting they are motivated at least as strongly by the urge to mother as they are by their concern for Draco and their own curiosity.
“He thinks you’re his mother,” he says, grinning.
“We’ve got time,” Harry says, and then stops. “Hang on, if we’re here, what happens when someone hails the bus?”
“It’s called enrichment,” Danica says, smiling proudly. “I’ve been reading up on mice and all the things they need.”
“That is really not what I expected you to say,” Draco admits. “Why?”
“Come on, Harry,” Eilish says, patting his shoulder. “It’s your turn to pick a carol. He’s not going anywhere.”
Draco hesitates. “I don’t imagine you’ll see it this way, but it wasn’t a complete lie when I said there was another driver. Obviously, I’m the only one who drives the bus, but Severus, or Vesseur, is always with me.”
“I’m so sorry, Miss…?” Draco hesitates.
“Well, aren’t you?” Ron asks, biting into his mince pie.
“I am not gallivanting down Diagon Alley in my nightclothes.”
“Well, that’s pretty damning,” George says.
“Stop it,” Harry says, stuffing the rest of the vanilla slice into his mouth, just for something to do. “You’re trying to embarrass me. And it’s working.”
“In that case, thank you very much,” Harry says gravely, patting the dashboard and waiting for a piece of fruit to fly out and hit him. Nothing happens. The idling engine continues to purr and his lovely new chair doesn’t dematerialise beneath him. “Looks like there’s no getting rid of me now.”
When Harry turns to Draco, his tight expression has relaxed and he’s almost smiling as he watches them together.
“Yep,” Harry says, sketching an awkward little wave at the nurse who is now bustling towards them across the crowded hospital foyer. “Why exactly is she so cross?”
At the sound of these magic words, the sofas are vacated instantly and play is redirected onto the floor at a slightly more ear-friendly volume. Amused and impressed, Luna watches them for a moment or two before heading for the office to have a look at her colleague’s outfits. In honour of her father, she is wearing the Kneazle-print nightie that started it all, along with stripy tights, purple wellington boots and a floppy straw hat.
“Could be someone who just doesn’t like children,” Jean says darkly.
“He’ll be alright,” Hermione says, accepting her plate with a sly smile. “He owed me a favour anyway.”
“What sort of an engine have you got under this, then?” Arthur asks, standing on the bottom step and peering around for clues.
Something about his warm, casual manner makes Harry feel slightly sick.
Moments later, the sky above Diagon Alley is filled with glittering, multicoloured lights as the most spectacular colours explode and merge and shoot overhead. Just like real fireworks, they hiss and crackle and squeal, and soon, everyone has stopped what they are doing to gaze up at the display.
Harry grins, feeling rather touched. “That’s really nice of you, Danica, but don’t you think it might get a bit confusing?”
“You get used to it. What do you have there?”
“Eat it while it’s hot,” he says as he wanders off into the aisles, and when he looks back, Potter is gnawing cautiously as his sandwich and looking thoroughly confused.
Luna fiddles with the end of her plait and regards him steadily. “I don’t see why not. You’re very noticeable.”
So far, he has managed to keep the subject of the break-ins at bay; his Diagon Alley colleagues are, thankfully, astute enough to avoid the topic when they notice Rose at her desk, and curious customers have, so far, been easily distracted by talk of new arrivals and special deals. The Christmas tree in the window doesn’t look quite as impressive as it once had, but Harry has hung the last few decorations and wrapped up anything he can find in shiny paper to simulate the pile of presents. In spite of everything, he is pretty confident that the unaffected shops will have enough gifts to delight the children of St Mungo’s, and grateful that the donation tins in the street are both spelled shut and fixed in place.
. When Draco finally stumbles and drags them both onto the ice with a crash, he just lies there, ignoring the pain in his knees and hauling Draco into a kiss with both hands fisted into his coat. Draco laughs against his lips and touches his face with ice cold fingertips.
“Not that way, you daft bugger!” Ginny calls, giggling helplessly.
“We have several pieces of evidence,” Draco says, and his voice is enviably calm as he explains everything they have found, including the notes, which Harry gives to Florean to read.
“By whom?” he asks.
Scanning the room once more, her eyes catch on something that isn’t quite right, and she heads over to sit cross-legged on the floor next to a girl clutching a letter and scowling. The light around her is a pale, unsettling shade of her usual vibrant orange.
“Really?”
Harry closes his eyes, letting the warmth of the sun and the press of Draco’s body combine with the surge of adrenaline inside him as he reaches for something, anything, and finds himself in the footnotes of his Herbology textbook. Last night he’d read a chapter on Soporific Plants, and a single, unimportant paragraph jumps out at him now:
“You thought wrong,” Draco says, and his voice is raw because Harry is using him and he hurts. He hurts all over and there are people spilling in rivers all around him and he can barely see them.
“TACK!” he says decisively, hopping from foot to foot and causing the squid to shiver beneath him.
“Yes, thank you,” Draco says, conjuring a chair for Harry beside his own.
He’s motionless now, sprawled out on a dusty path, clothes torn apart and pale hair streaked with blood. He doesn’t open his eyes when Harry calls out to him, and there’s so much blood, so much… every step he takes is heavy, like wading through water, but he has to get there, and yet he seems to be falling back with every second that passes, calling out into silence and feeling his throat burn in the heat. He can’t reach him, can’t cry out, and when one grey eye opens and then falls closed again he collapses in the hot sand, fingers grasping for purchase until the ground seems to twist tightly around them. It hurts and he can’t breathe, and something is desperately wrong but he can’t seem to pull himself upright. Something is trapping him, snarling around him, and he lashes out, desperate now.
Harry regards him curiously. “Right, well, I think you’ve sort of disproved your own point there, haven’t you?”
It’s almost midday by the time they leave the quill shop and Harry insists on treating Draco and Officer Kettleworth to currywurst and hot winter punch from the German stall. They find a quiet bench and, inside the safety of a privacy charm, discuss the newest crime as they eat. Every inch of Mr Jennings’s shop has been searched and photographed, as well as checked for unusual footprints and anything the officer can send back to the Ministry to be analysed.
Harry can almost hear the slide of hundreds of eyes as they swivel to focus on him, and his stomach tips as he leans over Ginny’s shoulder and forces himself to look at the newspaper.
“I don’t know… where are we going next?”
“Several,” Florean says. “Can we focus on the matter at hand?”
“What on earth are we doing?” Danica asks, hanging on to her teacup.
“I’m hardly going to up and leave when business is booming like this,” Draco murmurs. “You should go and say hello to the ladies. We’ll be there in a minute.”
He doesn’t need to turn around to know that Draco is giving him the finger.
“Let’s go,” Harry murmurs against his lips, and his eyes snap open.
“We must be allowed by now.”
“Well, I know that, but I thought… it’s fancy, it must stand for something,” Harry says, relieved when Needle stands up and the blood starts to flood back into his extremities. “You know, like… Strictly Affluent Gustatory Experience,” he suggests, realising that he definitely is making fun of Draco now.
“You knew,” Harry says, opting to let the whole thing wash over him. Yes, his friends are insane, but he has the feeling they mean well and he’s not about to let a delicious meal go to waste because of a little bit of scheming. He gathers potato and seasoned meat on his fork and conveys it to his mouth, sighing pleasurably at the warm, familiar flavours.
“Yeah. He owns it,” Harry says, still feeling uncertain. “So, this isn’t… a thing for you?”
Harry presses a cold foot to the back of his leg. “Good. So, here’s what happened…”
“How is she?” he asks at last, and a flicker of a smile troubles the hard set of Draco’s mouth.
As it turns out, he arrives halfway through the afternoon, just as Horace is stuffing himself through the French windows with his bag of books. The children are already descending on him, wrapping little fingers around the edges of his jacket and bearing him over to his fireside chair. Luna watches for a moment from the middle of the corridor, and then turns and goes to meet Harry.
“It’s nice,” Harry says, wriggling his frozen fingers and thinking that a cup of hot chocolate would be pretty fantastic right about now. “Who’s it for?”
They say goodbye to Jean and Draco practically shoves Harry into the Leaky Cauldron with strict instructions not to Apparate. Harry looks at Tom’s fireplace and wavers, knowing that travelling by Floo always makes him feel sick. Finally deciding that nausea is more manageable than a splinching injury, he flings himself through the Floo Network and, seconds later, staggers out into his kitchen. His cough is already threatening by the time he reaches his bedroom, so he downs the last of the Pepper-up and crawls under his quilt, pressing his hot face to the cool side of his pillow and allowing his sore eyes to drift closed as fragrant steam billows around him.
By lunchtime, Harry has collected an armful of hessian sacks, each of which he has carefully marked with the name of a shop and shrunk down to fit in his coat pocket. The process, while, straightforward, is slowed down by every shopkeeper wanting to talk to him about the investigation, his health, and in some cases, his love life.
**~*~**
Arthur has managed to seat himself on Mr Borteg’s other side, and has already engaged him in a series of eager questions by the time everyone is ready to eat.
“You? First class?” Ron laughs. “They’ll never let you on. Angelina’ll have to go on her own.”
“You could get that one and add the crackleballs when they come out,” Harry suggests. “That way you’ll definitely have your hamper. They’re pretty popular and I don’t always manage to keep up with making them if it’s busy.”
“It’s you,” he mumbles, staring at Draco for a moment and then walking past him onto the shop floor.
“Are they?” Harry says, squinting at the three etched letters. “I thought it just said ‘EEP’.”
Harry lifts into each stroke, wanting more and, at the same time, feeling as though he can’t take another moment of the painful need spiralling through his body. When his release comes, he cries out and clings to Draco, urging him to keep going with fingernails gripping at his back. Draco shudders and comes inside him with a low, rough groan that makes Harry wonder if he has the energy to start all over again.
Potter, bloody Potter, is infuriating. Draco thinks he should be happy now that he has an explanation for fewer than usual Potter-related-inquiries, but for some reason, he just feels agitated. Not because he suddenly cares about Potter’s mental health or, indeed, whether or not he really has decided to become a hermit, just... just for reasons. And, alright, if he’s honest, he doesn’t believe for a moment that Potter has suddenly become even less sociable than himself. He’s up to something, and Draco wonders... and then Draco hears himself wondering and stops, instead folding his arms across his chest and glaring at Pansy.
“Mr Pike,” he says, and Draco looks up.
“Flooing makes me feel sick,” Danica says.
“A mixed review, I think,” Draco says. The purple jumper swings on his slender frame as he turns to grab Harry, poke him into a chair at the front of the bus and retrieve the biddies’ gift from under the driver’s seat.
Harry wakes with a feeling of warm contentment that rapidly turns to longing as he remembers Draco’s hands on the wheel, his startled but pleased little smile as Rose had hung onto his chair and asked question after question and the way the bus had trundled around London at an almost sedate pace to avoid knocking her off her feet. There had been secret glances for Harry in his conductor’s seat, and an almost-hidden sigh of genuine regret when he had been swept back to the Burrow along with the rest of the Weasley clan.
“One… whole bottle?” Timothy asks, pausing in his scribbling.
“He’s tried,” Harry says, imagining a hundred Timothys all scurrying and apologising at once. At least there would be a lot of shiny buttons. “He’s spoken to the head of MLE but everyone’s just overstretched. The Auror department has a full caseload and everyone else is just flat out. Apparently this is particularly crimey time of year.”
“That’s very generous of you,” Shan says, looking anxiously for a price tag and then flicking a worried glance at Harry when she can’t find one.
Rose frowns. “I don’t want him to be lonely. And Mummy, queens have treasure, don’t they?”
“Well, what are you going to do?” Caroline asks.
“Shh,” insists the person now using his chest as a pillow.
Draco sighs, closing his eyes for a moment and taking a long breath. “Borteg’s has been broken into. So has Sage. We think it happened in the early hours of this morning.”
When the bell over the door announces a customer, he straightens up and puts on his most professional smile.
“Lovely.” Harry opens the door and nods to Mr Borteg, who doesn’t seem the slightest bit surprised to see them. “Just going to the office. We won’t disturb you.”
“So are we,” Corrie says with feeling. “But we can have words with him, thanks to you.”
As Harry examines his intricately patterned bobble hat, Corrie produces four more, all knitted from the same pattern but each in a different colour. Ida’s soft pink makes her silvery hair glow, Danica’s pistachio picks out the green flecks in her eyes, and the russet yarn Corrie has chosen for Eilish warms her skin the moment she jams it on her head. Harry puts his on and looks to Corrie for approval.
“Yes,” Hugo says solemnly.
With a mingled laugh/groan, Harry looks up at the sky and fights for control, but Draco’s fingers are insistent and the slow, languid rhythm inside him is gaining momentum and all he can do is let go, intense pleasure spreading through him as he looks up at the glowing lights and comes all over Draco’s fist.
“Fine,” Draco says. It’s the best they can do and he knows it. He also knows that Pansy is sitting on so much curiosity that she will, at some point, explode, and she is doing it for him.
“Those aren’t my Mummy and Daddy’s names,” Rose reproves, twisting in Harry’s arms.
“I don’t really follow Quidditch any more,” Draco says, seeming to sag slightly in his seat at the admission.
“I’m sure he’ll be pleased to know he impressed you,” Luna laughs, waving at Ginny as they draw up to the stall.
“Are you lost?” he asks, touching Stanley’s tinsel with his fingertips.
“Save the bristle beetle?” Draco asks innocently.
“You’re saying that because you haven’t heard me sing,” Harry says.
“Did you bring
“What does Juno think about him?” he asks, and Eilish laughs.
“Yes it is, and we need to all get into the bus and be ready to leave at twelve,” Deb says. “Not ten past twelve or quarter past twelve—twelve o’clock, and you all need to be ready. Okay?”
“Yeah… yeah, okay,” he sighs. “I don’t even know what he’s doing in there, that’s the problem. He’s gone all quiet and it’s just weird. Plus, we’re supposed to be interviewing people together and I suppose I just thought he might have a bit more urgency about him.”
Daraja laughs. “I’m glad. Have you tried asking him to help you with your investigation?”
Draco lets out a slow breath and stares at the floor. “Does it really matter?”
“You’ve let yourself down, Marmaduke,” Esmee says softly, and just for a moment, Harry sees the blow hit home.
“She still is. Clever, not irritating.”
The streets of London are heaving with Saturday morning shoppers when Harry strikes out in search of treats for the biddy club. And maybe Draco, too, if he behaves himself. The thought puts a smile on his face that doesn’t falter even when a girl with a clipboard and a foghorn voice attempts to trip him up in the name of completing some sort of market research.
“But don’t you live in… Ottery St Catchpole?” Draco asks, perching on the edge of her desk.
Florean smiles. “Are you sure you won’t have the ice cream?”
Harry doesn’t believe her strident tone one bit, but either way, the chickens are coming out of the oven. In a rush of delicious-scented steam, Molly carries the chickens to the counter one by one and sits them both there in their roasting trays, gleaming and topped with crisp, herby skin. Harry shifts in his chair and gazes at them, stomach grumbling. Beside him, Ron lets out a small groan.
“Oh, yeah. Okay, let’s go the other way…”
“It fell down over here,” Rose says, jumping up and retrieving the broken string for Shan.
“I am the customer,” the man says slowly, as though he thinks Harry might be too stupid to understand. “You need to give me what I want.”
Harry stares at him, watching him take off his hat and ruffle his hair with his fingers.
“The children want a piano,” she says.
“Don’t lurk around over there, come and sit down,” Eilish says, gesturing furiously until Harry is settled in his chair.
“How heavy can they be, though?” Hannah asks. “They have to fly without magic.”
“Please could you lend me three Sickles?” he asks in a whisper.
Draco stops, too, regarding him curiously. “What?”
“He certainly has,” Fred says, delighted. “We should all listen to what he has to say.”
“Fine. But if he bites anyone, it’s on you.”
As Draco clicks himself off air, the studio door opens.
“So, you were at the Leaky last night when this all happened?” Harry says, deciding to take the lead.
Mrs Skower?” Harry asks, eyes wide.
“What?”
The rain has stopped.
“Isn’t Draco coming?” Molly asks, rattling a tin of roast potatoes. “I’ve done one for him as well. It’s got a cat as well as a bus.”
“Don’t fancy Gringotts?” he teases, knowing very well that Shan is terrified of goblins.
“That’s not true, Draco. I heard you complaining a lot,” Harry says, smiling apologetically at the disappointed stallholder and starting back up the alley.
“Sorry.”
For several seconds they stare at Harry in silence, and then one steps forward and shouts:
“You think he’ll deny it?”
“Did you all hear that? Pansy wants to talk about my ducks... well, let’s do that. My ducks are wonderful. They are well—thriving, in fact—and I’m hoping they decide to breed this year. Because then there will be more ducks. And, as we have established, I like ducks.”
“He wasn’t using it,” Draco says blithely. “And I will put it back, which is more than I can say about what happened to my coffee yesterday.”
“Thanks!” Shan laughs, shaking her head and setting multiple brass bells jingling.
“You’ll what?”
“Yes, I did,” Draco sighs.
“I know. I should tell the papers—imagine the headline: ‘
As soon as they reach St Mungo’s, an impressive machine seems to take over the situation, leaving Harry with nothing to do but watch, as Ida is borne away on a floating stretcher while the rest of them are grilled by a pin-neat mediwitch for the details of the accident and any pills and potions that Ida might be unable to take. Another member of the team shows them where they can wait for news and, crucially, where tea and coffee can be obtained in the meantime.
“Sixteen,” Draco says after a moment, something of a manic gleam in his eye. “They’re all here.”
“We did this when Eilish had her funny eye,” Danica confides, taking out her wand and ducking behind a pillar.
“Later,” Draco mumbles, flopping onto Harry’s chest in a hot, damp heap.
Harry smiles back, breathing in the clean scent of lemons. “Not yet.”
“Aye, especially old Angus,” puts in a man with green wellingtons and windswept hair, turning to look at them from his seat at the bar.
“Best behaviour,” Luna reminds him. “That means no yelling. I don’t know, Otis, perhaps you should ask Harry. Perhaps it’s true, though. Draco can speak French, and he once said that helps him to speak a bit of Spanish.”
“Five bottles of Borteg’s own and some very fine elf-made tumblers,” Mr Borteg adds. “Several more bottles smashed. Are you biting my finger, young sir?”
“Perhaps another day,” Draco says, and he looks so alarmed that Harry almost takes Natalie up on her offer.
“I don’t think anyone’s ever called me pretty before,” he says at last, and the ladies exchange gleeful glances. “If you’ll excuse me for a minute, I have to go and have a word with Draco.”
“Of course, I’ve failed twice now,” he says, affecting a thoughtful expression.
Harry steps closer, relishing the feeling of an expertly-cast warming charm.
To his astonishment, though, Draco pulls the bus into a safe place, shields it from view and walks slowly up to number twelve. In the light from the hallway, Harry can see that he, too, has had a restless night. The circles under his eyes stand out in stark contrast to his pale skin and his hair is ruffled and untidy. Harry grips the doorframe, desperate to reach for him and stroke him smooth and calm.
“What do we say to that?”
“It narrows it down a bit,” Harry says, walking to the shelves and regarding the rows of bottles. “Anything else?”
“She was enjoying it, Mum, as were all of us… go on, do your chicken dance again,” Charlie says.
“It’s just cakes and tea and stuff, isn’t it?” Harry says. “Can’t the waiters get it?”
Harry glances at Draco, who looks far more amused than is really necessary. He has no idea what to think, but the option of making a run for it and Apparating back to Hogsmeade is becoming more and more attractive by the minute. When he turns his attention back to the old woman, she is in full flow once again.
“I would love to be a fly on the wall for that conversation,” Harry says, grinning.
Rose is already at the school gates when he gets there and she smiles to greet him.
Harry pauses in his examination of the strange little spring-loaded seat. “Oh, so you do remember?”
“When you’re ready to stop being so disgustingly bigoted, perhaps you might consider that all three of these stalls arrived in the alley on the same day,” Draco says, stepping out of the crowd. “Are you going to accuse the face painters and the sweet seller, too?”
“Don’t say that, Caroline,” says Otis, looking scandalised as he often does. “Why don’t you want to go to Hogwarts?”
“What?”
The sky outside the windows is grey and the fog has turned into a downpour, but the Burrow’s kitchen is warm and comforting even to Harry’s fragile nerves. He is alone, sitting in a sturdy chair at the scrubbed pine table and idly watching the hands of his watch drift towards eight in the morning. Molly’s wall clock lists almost all the Weasleys as ‘in bed’, with only Molly’s, Arthur’s and Ginny’s hands pointing elsewhere.
At eight o’clock, Florean sets down his spoon and calls the meeting to order.
At the door, Harry watches as each of them in turn tries knocking and yelling through the letterbox. He has a go himself, though he doubts it will make a difference, and sure enough, there is no response from Ida.
“I wish I’d seen it,” Draco sighs.
“Good for him, eating his vegetables,” Ron says, grinning. With a significant look at Rose, he points his wand at her socks and turns them a vivid lime green.
“I’ll order them,” Harry says, setting down his salad and yawning again.
Harry instinctively looks for Montague, quickly finding him sleeping at Ida’s feet, paws and nose twitching in silent dreams. Juno, disinterested in both the sausage dog and the idea of rest, walks up and down the dashboard, rubbing herself against the steering wheel and then springing onto the back of Draco’s leather chair.
Baffled, Draco glances down at his clothes and goes very still. Because she’s right, and these are not his jeans. They are Harry’s, and he has no idea how he could have failed to notice that fact. They are lighter in colour than anything he owns, sort of faded and worn with torn patches and holes that are perfect for a beetle to poke his antennae into. They are rather too large, too, hanging from his hips and clinging only where his damp skin is sticking to the soft denim. He is wearing Harry’s jeans, and Ivy bloody Baron knows it, which means that it’s only a matter of time before Magnus knows it, too, as well as his boyfriend Fergus and half of Gryffindor House, which, with the help of the Hogwarts rumour mill, will soon be the whole school.
At least until Draco elbows him in the ribs and hisses, “This is a Muggle place.”
Surprised to find himself reflecting Draco’s smile back to him, Harry dangles the little Snape from his finger on its fine golden string. He holds it out to Draco.
“No, listen,” Harry insists, rising unsteadily and gripping Draco’s forearm. “I’m not going mad. Well, I might be, but not because of this. Draco… the person who’s doing this is one of us. It’s someone who works on Diagon Alley. It’s someone who knows where the gravy boat is.”
He dashes off into the living room and returns with a bottle-shaped present that draws a questioning look from Draco.
While the other ladies have welcomed him to the table with genuine pleasure, Thora seems to regard him as… if not a completely unwelcome interloper, certainly an object of suspicion. She sits squashed into a corner, clutching the flask of black coffee she has brought from home and screwing up her face whenever the teapot is proffered. Most of the group seems to ignore her odd behaviour and engage her whenever they can, but Corrie, now working on a new blanket in bright red yarn, seems to regard her with equal distrust.
Adrenaline spiking, Harry starts walking again. “They’re not official notes, but…”
“Fuck,” Harry whispers, and the thread snaps.
“Harry?” Draco shouts, and Harry wants to tell him to whisper because his head hurts, but when he opens his mouth, nothing happens.
Draco shrugs. “I’ll take it. I’ve always wanted to be a man of many talents.”
Harry listens to their heartfelt words and lets his eyes drift, picking out friends and colleagues in the crowd. Everyone seems to have turned out for the ceremony, and almost every shop door wears a ‘back soon’ sign and a glow of security magic. Timothy watches over the proceedings from a distance, standing straight-backed and proud with even shinier buttons than usual. Jean and Mrs Purley stand side by side, sniffling, and just behind them, flanked by the staff of Quality Quidditch Supplies, Mr Jennings hovers, looking anxiously back at his shop every couple of minutes. At Draco’s side, Narcissa watches the exchange of vows with a tiny inscrutable smile and Rose’s eyes are everywhere as she tries to take in the entire spectacle at once.
“Where do you think I got the idea?” Draco says, mouth twitching as he takes the coin back and drops it into his pocket.
“Not yet,” Harry says, shifting into a comfortable position against the arm of the sofa and gripping his hot cup with both hands.
She goes easily to her, sleepy and stretched out with green eyes blinking slowly. Molly reaches for her immediately.
“Yes,” Danica says, elbowing Corrie. “Some of us stay up all night!”
“Me neither,” Ida agrees with feeling.
“Okay,” Harry says, allowing himself to relax. Seconds later, he is on his hands and knees in the cold, wet grass. “Look at this!”
“That was your news update at eleven fifteen,” he says into his omnivox, turning around in his chair to look at Pansy, who is peering down at the street through the Eye in the Sky. “It’s Tuesday the nineteenth of April and there is no sign of a reprieve from the rain any time soon. Can you actually see anything out there, Pans?”
Harry has to agree that he is. They make it almost all the way to Cherish before they are accosted by Felicity, who is loaded with colourful flowers that make both their noses twitch with delight.
like a birthday party.
“You have plenty of socks in your drawer. I put them there last night.”
“You looked wonderful,” Draco says, kissing him and allowing his hard cock to brush against Harry’s hip.
“Because she’ll notice, and she’ll be suspicious, especially as we don’t have any tools yet, and then we’ll have to modify her memory. Do you want to Obliviate an old lady? I don’t really fancy it myself.”
“Dissenting voters: Reuben, Mr Borteg, Jean, Mrs Purley, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.”
Harry shuts the atlas and pulls up his knees, resting his chin on top and staring without really seeing into the fire. He doesn’t want to go. He just doesn’t, and his heart hammers a guilty rhythm in his chest. A month ago, he would have jumped at the chance to travel somewhere new, to motivate other volunteers and help a new group of people. He would have been delighted just to have a new campaign to pencil into his calendar. He would have been relieved to have something to do. Now all he can think about is the fact that there are tons of fantastic people out there who are just as qualified as him and who would probably be delighted to lead this campaign.
Intrigued, Luna kneels on the floor and watches as Mr Abernathy takes all the pencils from their wooden pot and rearranges them into an odd sort of nest before sitting in the middle of it and puffing up his feathers proudly. He looks at her as if to say… well, she isn’t entirely sure, but he certainly seems pleased with himself… and then promptly falls asleep.
Draco gazes at him evenly for what seems like a long time. “Don’t take this the wrong way, Potter, but I have been persuaded to take pity on you.”
“She was part of the family,” Draco says. “He was rather unimpressed when he discovered that he wouldn’t be allowed to bring her to Hogwarts.”
“Somewhere else, maybe?” Harry asks hopefully, knowing that if Draco forces him to apologise right here in the middle of the kitchen, there won’t be any getting out of it.
Eliza sighs. “He’s sitting right next to you, Benny.”
“Let’s sweep the steps of Gringotts,” she says, laughing as Benny immediately hunches down and mimics the sour expression of a goblin as he makes energetic brushing motions to the beat.
It’s perhaps the disappointment that stings the most. It clings to him, pulling him earthwards as he makes himself coffee and attempts to hold on to his usual evening routine. It’s the thought that someone like Harry, who despite his madness and pigheadedness has always been a good person, a kind person, could be so fucking careless with someone else’s feelings. With their happiness. With... them.
“No, but I just—”
Victoire glances at her cousins and all of them dissolve into helpless laughter. Louis, who seems delighted to have been seated between two French speakers, stares at Mr Borteg and mumbles to them in confusion.
“Plus, what would your mother say if you turned up full of someone else’s pork?” Hermione asks and then frowns. “That sounded a lot ruder than I meant it to.”
“You look like you need a basket,” Shan says, closing her cash drawer with a clang.
“Alright, Harry?” George says with a grin, and then he’s bounding to Jean’s side and pulling a jar out of his pocket. “Out of the way, you,” he says to the swan.
“Really?” Ron says, stepping away from his conversation with George and joining them. “Do you know who sent them, because I’ve been getting these letters...”
Potter says nothing. He carries on writing as if Draco isn’t even there, pausing every now and then to flick bits of bright purple hair out of his eyes.
“I do,” Draco says, opening one eye and fixing it on Ron.
“The retraction will be in tomorrow’s edition,” the editor says.
“Fine,” Draco sighs, fishing out another humbug and throwing it at Harry.
Tacking softly, he approaches the door and taps the wood with his antennae. It’s quite solid, but he can hear the voices he knows so well from the other side. He decides to wait, tucking his little feet underneath himself and wedging himself up against the skirting board so that he won’t be accidentally stood on. When he hears the whistle of the kettle, though, he knows that the door won’t be opening any time soon.
“Everyone has to be new at some point,” Harry says. “I think people just forget what it feels like.”
Harry holds out his hand, surprised by both the warmth and the strength of the man’s grip.
“Sounds reasonable,” Harry says, heading to retrieve the tools from the chest and smiling to himself at the thought of Draco wielding a rake or hoe.
Harry writes ‘over forty’ at the bottom of the list. “What about political views?”
Harry reaches out and takes his hand. “Let’s go outside.”
“Your Squidliness,” Harry adds, sketching a little salute.
“Officer Kettleworth… Timothy,” the man offers, sounding as though he’s not quite sure. “Good to meet you. I’ve been told you can brief me on what’s happened here so far?”
beer?” Draco asks, lifting an eyebrow. “You don’t mean that she makes her own beer?”
“Does your bed have clean sheets on it now?” he asks hopefully.
“I’m not short, I’m… compact,” Sam says crossly, but when he looks at Luna, his expression is one of amused defeat. “You’ve thought of everything, haven’t you?”
“What did you get?”
“Was your present a trip to Iceland, too?” Harry asks, regarding him with curiosity.
“Have we missed it?” Harry asks.
Brightened by the prospect of a nice dinner with his friends, Harry heads for the shower. His legs are a little unsteady beneath him but he thinks he can fix that with coffee and a good breakfast, and by the time he has sluiced away all traces of sweat and Pepper-Up, he is feeling much more like himself.
“You look awful,” Ginny says helpfully. “Shall I pour you another one?”
“Okay. I can do that,” Harry mutters, releasing Draco’s arm and staggering over to the map on the wall. “This person knows us. They know our routines. They know that Mrs Purley goes to the bank on a Monday morning, so her till will be full. They know when Reuben gets his deliveries and that the whole staff team will be out the back, getting the things off the cart. They know that Mr Jennings has used the same spell on his till for… forever, and probably all of them have. Except Jean—she changed her security spell and they didn’t get her money.”
His most recent endeavour, a campaign for the protection of magical creatures, has come to a successful end, and with the next project not due to start until well into the new year, Harry is at the loose end to end all loose ends. It will be fine, he supposes. Christmas will be here before anyone is really ready for it, and George and Angelina’s wedding is less than three weeks away. He still hasn’t found anyone to bring with him, despite Ron and Hermione’s best efforts to fix him up with any vaguely attractive male they come across, and while he’s fine with attending by himself, he doesn’t think they’re about to give up.
Harry stares down at him and bites his lip. He’s already burning up, tight and full and impossibly turned on just by the thought of having Draco inside him. The sensation itself is almost too much to bear and it takes everything he has not to move immediately. He breathes slowly, pressing his heated cock against his abdomen. The cold outside is already forgotten and he can feel the sweat prickling at his hairline and slipping down his back.
“It’s Saturday, and I can do whatever I want,” he tells himself firmly, standing in the middle of his bedroom, shivering in nothing but boxer shorts and trying to remember what he usually does at this point.
“They needed me,” Harry says grandly.
“I like it here,” Harry says after a moment, lifting his chin and pretending nonchalance that doesn’t fool Luna for one second. “Why are you all being so weird?”
“That is a very long time,” she says absently, gazing at the grinning green frogs that splatter his pyjamas and then at the butterflies that cover Eliza’s as she silently hands over her hot cup to Luna in order to scramble up onto the sofa.
Eilish looks around the table, sighs, and brushes chalk pastel dust from her hands.
The moment they step into Ida’s room, though, all doubt dissolves into nothing.
Harry nods and scarpers, secretly terrified that the spotlight now fixed on the man in the suit will follow him back to his seat and light him up in shame as the man who doesn’t know how to behave at a primary school Christmas play. Fortunately, he makes it back just as the man introduces himself as the headmaster and starts to thank various teachers and parents for their hard work.
“Sorry I’m late, Luna,” Horace says, appearing by her side and puffing slightly. “I was getting these. Happy birthday. Goodness, I haven’t heard this song in years!”
“Apparently, they talked about spiders,” Hermione says.
“Since fuck you, that’s when,” Harry mutters, but hurries to join him. “I thought we agreed we might need something a bit more substantial for chasing goats around?”
“Not you... Potter,” Draco says, and he can practically hear her rolling her eyes.
“Can we hobnob while we eat?” Ginny asks, pulling up the chair next to Harry’s and yanking Neville into the one on her other side. He doesn’t seem to mind.
Harry lifts a dark eyebrow. “Like what, exactly?”
“I didn’t want to rush you while you were eating,” Draco says. “And we do serve drinks, you know.”
The woman smiles at him and takes the bag, and just for a moment, Harry feels wonderful. The morning sunlight is warm on his face, he’s just made an excellent sale, and a customer has surprised him in the most delightful way. It’s just possible that today is going to be a very good day.
Just at that moment, he meets Draco’s eyes. He grins, and Harry immediately feels the flush creeping up the back of his neck.
“Life must go on,” Arthur says, joining Harry for early morning coffee in the overgrown garden before heading off to his new job as Undersecretary to the Minister. The loss of his son is visible in his eyes—always—but Harry knows that he believes his own words. He has never known Arthur to tell a lie. “It’s over,” Arthur tells him. “And we’re still here.”
Draco’s eyes flick to his and hold. “They did. And he’s very good at walking around and preventing crimes from taking place in his immediate vicinity. If we had a hundred of him, we’d be fine. Or not, that’s quite a disturbing thought. Can’t Weasley do something?”
“No, but I thought—”
“Are you going to be alright?” Hermione asks anxiously.
Draco smiles at her. She’s going to be a wonderful teacher some day, he just knows it.
“That’s awful,” Harry says, grimacing. “I’ve been going to the Burrow for years now and family is sort of the whole point. Then again, Christmas at the Dursleys’ was family only, too… I just wasn’t considered part of it.”
“None taken,” Luna says brightly, just as Sam emerges from behind his desk, allowing her to see his ensemble for the first time.
“Are you a customer?” Potter challenges.
“No, I’m just thinking,” he lies, squeezing her hand and smiling.
“There’s an exception to every rule, I suppose,” he admits. “Come on, help me with this. I have no idea what to write.”
He takes a steadying breath, gazing around at the forest of little round tables and the familiar gleaming surfaces of copper and marble. He already knows exactly where he’s going to sit, exactly what he’s going to order, and the certainty of it is soothing. When he steps up to the counter, Draco is accepting a banana split with what definitely seems like extra cherries.
“Like what?”
Draco smiles slowly. “It’s not that I don’t want to.”
“Daft beetle,” he murmurs, stroking the patterned shell and pushing away the terror and grief that threaten to drag him back down to the bottom of the lake.
“Not that she’d know anything about that,” he laughs.
“That sounds brilliant,” Harry sighs, imagining this flavour combination alongside the crackleballs he has already experienced and knowing it will be incredible.
“I’m sorry,” he says now, getting to his feet. “What I said just now, it came out all wrong, and I want you to know that… well, I know you didn’t want to do those things. I know you were protecting your family. I don’t know why I’ve never said any of this to you before but I feel pretty stupid and you can tell me to stop talking at any time.”
In a magically-created alcove sits an enormous copper bathtub that seems to glow in the soft light from a single, hanging gas lamp, and above it, a shelf stocked with potions every colour of the rainbow draws Harry’s eyes effortlessly.
“They haven’t seen it,” Draco admits. “No one has seen it.”
When there is no answer, he lets out a painful cry and struggles free, already preparing to dive back into the water.
Draco glances at his omnivox to see that it is in fact turned on and that everyone listening to the WWN is sharing in his aggravation.
“And that’s what we’ll tell everyone,” Shan says as she walks into the back room.
“Sorry if we’ve sort of taken over,” he says. “I know you used to play together.”
“What is it?”
“I like you,” Eilish announces breathlessly. She turns to the others. “Shall we keep him?”
“Mysterious break-ins continue in Diagon Alley,” Draco reads, glancing at Harry over the top of the
Harry nods, wondering how long it will be until he can no longer feel his legs. “Yeah.” Needle rests his head on Harry’s knee and gazes up at him. “Seriously, what did you do to him?”
“Will you miss me?” Harry asks, feeling curiously vulnerable.
“Harry… you’re amazing. I don’t know what you did… I don’t want to know. Thank you.” She looks at the clock. “Shouldn’t you be at the Burrow?”
“We will definitely be open,” Felicity says fiercely.
“How did you—?” Harry attempts, but Draco cuts him off.
Harry says nothing. Instead, he unrolls a new piece of parchment and tacks it down to the desk. He writes ‘Mrs Purley’ in one corner and then adds the other three victims, giving each a corner and plenty of space to write notes.
“Yeah,” Harry says, kicking off his shoes and crawling onto the bed. The bedclothes are just as soft as he has imagined, and when the last item of clothing has been stripped away and flung onto the floor, he stretches out, relishing the feeling of the quilts and blankets against his bare skin. Draco sprawls out beside him, arms and legs forming only the faintest contrast against the pure white fabric, cock flushed and hard against his stomach.
Draco rustles the pages, and when he begins to read again, there’s a smile in his voice that Harry can feel, even with his eyes closed. Feeling utterly at peace, he drinks his tea, strokes Needle’s soft feathers, and listens.
“It’s the coffee shop man again,” Luna mumbles to herself.
“I still can’t understand who would do such a thing. Taking money is bad enough, but why take the presents for the kiddies?”
“Well, it’s ten to, and we still haven’t figured out what we’re going to wear.”
“I think we should consider ourselves told,” Draco says as they make their way back to the cabin.
The deck clearly benefits from some extension spells, but it remains a charming, astonishingly cosy little place. At one end, a large, brass-framed bed much like the others sits under the curved roof, layered up with soft, cream-coloured quilts and blankets and looking so inviting that Harry wants to kick off his shoes, pick up a book from the pile on the bedside and climb in for the afternoon.
She peers up at him, eyebrows knitted. “Well… alright.”
“What’s the matter?”
“I don’t know. Will they explode, Professor Malfoy?”
“Why not now?” Harry asks, puzzled.
“You will have to wait a moment, I’m in the middle of writing a letter to the Minister for Magic,” she says, and Stanley doesn’t know what all of those words mean but he has heard that tone of voice plenty of times before.
“I saw…” Caroline pauses, eyes flicking to her left once more. “I don’t know.”
“Shh,” Draco mutters again.
“Me too,” Fergus admits, and the first year is so startled to be spoken to by an older student that she almost loses her balance.
“Did you make those?” Harry asks Narcissa.
“You were trying to stop me getting here too early,” she laughs, understanding now.
“And me,” the officer says with a self-deprecating smile. “And a swan.”
“We could try turning these ones purple,” Harry suggests, pulling his wand out of his pocket.
“It’s the thing Hugo had,” Harry mumbles, every word scraping his throat like a knife.
“I’m alive,” he says, catching Draco’s wrists and pinning them to the sheets. “And so are you. I love you.”
“Hello, Mr Potter,” he says, grinning and displaying a mouthful of pleasantly uneven teeth. “Coffee and an éclair?”
Luna shivers despite the bright morning sunshine and quickens her pace, grounding herself with each step through the long grasses that line the stream. The soil and moss are cool and soft against her bare feet and she sticks out one arm to trail through the rushes as she walks, the other curled tightly around a fat patchwork notebook. The corners are a little bent these days, many of the pages dog-eared, and the little press-stud fastener will no longer hold the book closed because so many bits of paper and photographs have been stuffed inside, but it doesn’t matter. Inside this book are her friends, and there is nothing more important.
“Neither do I,” Draco says solemnly, but this time, when Gertie comes over to take their glasses, he stands up somewhat unsteadily. “No, thank you, Professor, I think you’ve had enough.”
“Don’t,” Sophie says. “This could happen to any of us. Look, at least we’ve got Diagon Alley’s finest on the job.”
“I don’t think I’d dare,” Harry admits. “Did you really want to do detective stuff or were you, in fact, lying to your mother?”
“Molly, I was kidding,” Harry says, regretting his careless comment already. “I’ve got loads of stuff—I still have most of the things you gave me yesterday, and I’ve got a cupboard full of stuff from the supermarket. I promise I don’t need anything.”
“Do you?” Harry asks, amused.
“You’re welcome,” Draco says stiffly. “You seem to have everything under control here. Perhaps I should go and make myself useful in the office. Or the kitchen. Or…”
“I don’t do running away,” Harry says. “It’s not... what I do.”
“It’s alright,” the something says, and the voice seems to reach out and cut his bindings loose.
“Oh,” Draco says irritably. “Yes, well.”
Luna shakes her head. “No, thank you. It smells lovely but I think I just want to get home as soon as I can... it’s been a long day.”
“Hermione, I’m fine,” he mumbles, touched by his friend’s concern but still hazy from sleep. “I didn’t hear the fire last night. I slept… I think I slept a lot.”
The dog wakes instantly and Harry holds his breath, waiting for some sort of horrible carnage to unfold, but the moment Montague lays eyes on the mouse, he lets out a terrified whimper and pelts out from under the table, tail down and ears flapping. Harry has never seen him move so quickly; within two seconds he is through the curtain with the mouse now in hot pursuit.
“Your scarf?”
“You do know I’m staying in a hotel, don’t you?” Draco whispers, pressing an indulgent smile to his ear. “Not in a tent in the middle of nowhere?”
“Maybe it’s wine,” Harry suggests, still looking at the picture.
“Works at Gringotts,” Corrie adds, glancing at Harry in a way that tells him he ought to be very impressed.
Mr Jennings gives them a weak smile. “Well, that will do for me. Where do we start?”
“I don’t think I could find one that covered this, don’t worry,” Harry admits, unable to keep the smile off his face. “Does it… do that often?”
Harry is weak. Draco’s hair, dishevelled into soft waves, hangs over one eye, while the other fixes on Harry with gut-wrenching intensity.
Harry and Draco appear in the back garden of the Burrow to find snow falling softly and a collection of red-headed people in coats gathered around what looks like an enormous table.
“I want to skate.”
“I need to apologise,” Harry says, leaping up as though something has bitten him. “Right now.”
Potter blinks. “She’s small for her species,” he says, looking back at the crocodile. “But I see what you mean.”
“I like it,” Harry says, tapping his wrist when Mr Borteg looks up.
“One of the other passengers thought I was a little bit harsh with you just now,” Draco explains, as though it should be obvious. “Are you getting on? I haven’t got all day.”
Draco is staring at him now, mouth twitching at the corners. “You set your curtains on fire.”
“How do you know they won’t buy the same ones?” Harry asks, knowing immediately that these gifts are for the ladies of biddy club.
“Nineteen ninety-eight cross-country skiing champion?” Hermione asks, looking up.
“I didn’t expect you to be here,” Draco says, and immediately wants to hex himself in the face.
**~*~**
“How old are they, anyway? I didn’t really want to ask.”
“I skated,” he says, brushing ice crystals from his coat. “Well, I tried.”
“Maybe he likes animals more than people,” Harry says, but he doesn’t want to believe it. Then again, he doesn’t want to believe that anyone he knows would do such a thing.
Draco turns slowly to see Potter emerging from what appears to be a storeroom, wiping his hands on his jeans and regarding him defensively through black, rectangular-framed glasses.
“They’re coming,” Harry whispers, edging back at his side. “That’s amazing.”
“I’ll know.” Draco reaches into his pocket and extracts a slightly battered Galleon. “It’s linked into the bus’s own magic. If someone needs us, it vibrates. I can’t say I’m expecting anyone—Mr Barleycorn will probably get on later, but he likes to ride overnight.”
“That’s a family record,” Harry says.
Draco straightens up and meets his eyes. “No, that was me, although you did mention swans at one point. I mean when you said... you said you loved me. Was that real or just... talking shit?”
“How big?”
They lapse once more into silence. Draco casts around for the right words and comes up with nothing, so he watches the shoppers and the stallholders, trying not to think of the warmth and ease with which their conversation had come less than a day before.
**~*~**
“No!” shout out several children at once.
Luna raises her eyebrows, head suddenly filled with a vivid image of little boys ricocheting around the house.
As he steps towards Needle and pushes him in the direction of the restaurant, he feels the eyes of the curious shoppers all over him. All he can do is try to ignore them and hope that the swan finds the bristles intimidating, or at least enough of an irritation that he opts to step away from them. For a moment, Needle stays put, pecking crossly at the advancing broom, but to Harry’s relief, he finally gives a cross little hiss and moves off across the cobbles. Harry follows him, jabbing his way to Draco’s door and yanking it open, broom still poking at Needle’s back. As soon as the way is clear, Needle ambles inside quite happily, and Harry wonders if he’d meant to escape at all. Perhaps he came to Borteg’s because he was shut out and needed somewhere familiar to hide.
Harry looks at the bagged sample. “Okay. Any chance I can take that one?”
Harry laughs. “Sorry to hear that. I’m still a bit surprised that you’re teetotal.”
“Or not,” he adds, just as Draco says, “Alright.”
“I know what a duck is, Draco.”
Draco strokes his fingers through the sweat-damp hair on Harry’s forehead and gazes at him. Through the haze of his panic, Harry can see that he is trying his best to look unconcerned, but it’s easy to see the anxiety that pulls his face tight. He looks tired. His hair is flopping over his forehead and his shirt sleeves are rumpled, there are shadows under his eyes and scrawls of ink on the back of his hands. He looks wonderful, and Harry thinks his heart might not be able to take it.
Draco doesn’t look at him but his little smile is rewarding. And irritating. “It says that I’m a man of excellent taste.”
It must be nine o’clock by now and yet the ice cream parlour is so pitch black that he can’t see his own hand in front of his face.
“Did you have a good time?” Harry asks, scrambling to his feet and lifting Hugo back into his arms with some effort.
“I don’t think she’ll like that,” Draco says, frowning, and Harry sighs, so stupidly in love with him that it almost hurts.
with that man again,” someone says behind her.
When Draco returns, Needle rises from his crate and makes a nuisance of himself, clattering around Draco’s legs like a misshapen cat and mumbling his fingers until Draco bats him away, at which point he settles beside the desk and watches beadily as Harry drinks his Pepper-up. He gasps at the rush of heat and braces himself for the steam, gripping the arms of his chair as it pours out of him and into the cool air of the distillery.
“Where would the fun be in that?”
“Mummy told you that before we went in,” Rose says helpfully.
“There he goes,” he mumbles to himself, and Rose looks up.
“Probably,” Draco says, wondering what kind of special occasion necessitates a crocodile.
Draco takes a long, slow breath and turns back to his work without a word. Harry grins. And waits.
The she wonders just what Harry and Draco would do if suddenly confronted with each other’s half-nakedness… or perhaps full nakedness, and then she grins, letting out a sound that is half snort and half giggle.
“Maybe you’ll be a gardener,” Harry says, passing Draco a spade and beginning to rake leaves into a pile. “You know, when you grow up.”
Ron leans in, lowering his voice. “If you tell her what’s in it, I’ll…”
“I’m not going to tell you that you’re not an idiot because you won’t believe me. Just tell me what happened.”
“I thought you were Pansy.”
By the time he hugs them both and waves them off on their international Portkey, Harry is feeling almost like himself again.
“He’s not going to get any pudding,” Ginny sings gleefully.
“Maybe I’ll get it out of them, then,” Harry says, allowing his eyes to stray to the back of the bus, where Audrey is now sitting in his chair and Eilish has set up an easel, upon which she seems to be painting a rather impressionistic picture of Juno.
“I don’t know,” he whispers. “I know he likes eating plants and biting people’s clothes… I also know that mute swans aren’t mute because Rose told me. I don’t know what they weigh.”
“I’m the treasurer,” Hermione corrects. “And he doesn’t have to bring anyone unless he wants to.”
“Yes, they are,” Molly says, cutting off Ron’s next remark and looking around her kitchen with satisfaction. “Now… is everybody here? Angelina’s in Scotland with the team, Percy’s at the in-laws’, Bill’s still in Algeria…” She glances at each of the rest of them in turn and then frowns. “Where on earth is George?”
Draco slides down from the counter and folds his arms. “Really?”
From that moment, a routine begins to fall into place. Draco finishes the show, having reported with Pansy on whatever bizarre new thing Potter happens to be up to, he walks to the deli or the pie shop or the market for lunch, and then he brings it to the Magical Menagerie, where Potter spends a varying amount of time looking at him as though he’s mad before giving in and eating whatever Draco has supplied. He serves customers and cleans out cages and frowns at his adding machine while Draco observes the animals, avoids the curious attentions of the enormous snake, and asks just about every question that pops into his head.
“It’s my new look,” he says, attempting what she likes to call his ‘serious face’. “I’m a style icon.”
“What’s wrong with here?” Harry whispers, digging his nails into Draco’s back and watching his eyes darken.
This time, the process goes much more smoothly. Harry doesn’t attempt to wrangle the swan without the help of a mild stunning spell, and he seems to be moving with rather than against the wind as he hurries down to the pub and out to the park. His ambush seems to catch the swan by surprise and it only manages to get in one decent bite before joining the others on the pond.
“It’s not like that. I don’t want that. It’s all a big mess.”
Molly and Arthur are waiting for him outside the restaurant, peering nervously into the window at the other diners. They are visibly relieved to see him and he doesn’t resist the urge to hug them both.
He doesn’t care. He doesn’t care if Draco buys something or doesn’t buy something. In fact, now that Draco thinks about it, he hasn’t cared for quite some time. He can’t remember the last time Harry told him to make a purchase or bugger off, and he can’t remember the last time he pressed Harry for answers about his campaign of madness. It’s just been lunches and animals and the two of them, spending their afternoons together because that’s just what they feel like doing.
Two minutes later, he’s asleep again.
“Perhaps it’s all about the excitement,” Draco suggests. “Perhaps everything we’ve thought of so far is irrelevant and this is just someone who wants to create as much havoc as possible.”
“I cook things,” Draco says defensively.
He laughs. “Look at him! He’s got more toys than my niece and nephew put together!”
“It’s a good suggestion,” Harry admits. “I’ve already decided to focus on projects a bit closer to home. Isn’t he handsome?”
“Something could be really wrong,” Harry says, startling as Juno jumps onto his lap and miaows loudly in his face. “Get down, Juno.”
“Because you’re a lovely person,” Luna says solemnly, and he laughs.
“Mr Jennings didn’t have any and I upset him by making unhelpful noises about retail diversification,” Harry says, blowing on a steaming piece of sausage. “Not my finest moment.”
“This is madness,” Draco whispers. “Complete madness.”
The woman steps back, colliding with Ron.
Harry turns to see Ron, eyes hollow and hair everywhere. He flicks his wand to set the kettle boiling and studies his friend.
She takes her seat at the large, scrubbed pine table and picks up her cup. Every few seconds she turns and glances at Rose, who is playing in the corner, as though terrified that the Prophet reporters might swoop in through the open window and carry her away. Though pale and drawn, she seems pleased to see Harry and curiously unsurprised to see Draco. He can’t remember the last time they were even in the same room together, yet she has welcomed him into her home like an old friend. Shame and bewilderment curl in his stomach, mixing with fear and desire every time he chances a glance at Harry, and he barely notices when he burns his mouth on the hot tea.
Harry shrugs. “Maybe if we help her, it’ll be ready faster, then we can eat it and it will be gone.”
“Next time, try bringing lunch,” Potter calls after him.
“Will you live?” he asks, one dark eyebrow flickering.
“Don’t you dare disparage the banana split,” he says when he catches Harry looking.
Minutes later, the bus comes to a stop, tyres crunching on gravel and engine coughing. Draco opens the doors and the ladies pile out, chattering excitedly. Harry follows and pauses at the door, appearing to notice at the same time as Draco that Danica has left her mouse cage on the table.
“Shut up,” Harry mutters, but he smiles anyway and only resists a little bit before telling Draco all about his evening, including all the bits that he knows will make him laugh, roll his eyes, or both. By the time he gets to the part about Ron arguing with the quizmaster over the difference between beetles and Beatles, Draco is using one hand to cover his face and the other to protect his coat buttons from Needle.
“He’s in the fucking lake,” Draco shouts, pushing saturated hair out of his face.
Mr Jennings shrugs. “Did you really not see this coming?” he says with a bark of bitter laughter. “My business was failing and you let it. All of you. That’s not what friends do.”
She has never been much of a planner, preferring to let things happen naturally—chaotically if necessary—but being friends with Hermione over the years has taught her that a little organisation goes a long way, and as such, she has chosen to outline her project using the structure she has gleaned from her friend’s notebooks and folders and bits of paper pinned to cork-boards.
Harry laughs. “She must have a thousand cups to go at over there.”
“You know, you’re very Slytherin when it comes to that swan,” Draco says, folding his arms.
Draco watches him bobble around for a moment and then smiles.
He tips his head back and lets out a long, rough cry, shuddering at the feeling of Draco’s hot mouth against his neck as he jerks and spills, hot and needy over Draco’s fingers. For long seconds, he keeps moving, fist slicked with Harry’s release, keeping up a slow, teasing rhythm until Harry’s body begins to tremble.
The younger children are full of enthusiasm but need frequent reminders to concentrate while some of the older ones are a little bit self-conscious and require a word or two of encouragement, but Luna keeps her eye on all of them, monitoring their glowing colours for signs of discomfort. Meanwhile, Draco stands in the corner, flickering, with his arms crossed and his face blank.
“Not today. I brought you this,” she says, pulling a glossy card from her pocket and handing it over with a proud smile.
“Yeah.”
“She’s not talking,” Harry says wryly. “Maybe you need to lean on her a bit.”
She looks so happy that Harry can’t do anything but smile and nod, and then, because she is staring at him with such expectation, spoon some of the dreaded soup into his mouth. He’s not sure what happened to the carrots; he definitely saw them go into the pot with his own eyes, but there is nothing recognisably carroty about the thing currently happening on his tongue. As usual, the soup has a thin, watery consistency and tastes simultaneously too sweet and too bitter to be allowed. The strange, amorphous globules of something that float menacingly in the liquid are too large to be swallowed without choking, but when bitten, release a gelatinous, fishy-tasting substance that coats the mouth and refuses to be shifted by even the mintiest freshening charm.
When they reach the top of yet another grassy slope and find several goats standing in and around a little bubbling stream, they let out almost identical sighs of relief. A quick look around reveals another group chewing at the base of a nearby tree, and two more investigating a rusted old tractor. In the shelter of the hills, the wind falls silent, and the only sounds are the high-pitched calls of the goats.
a fire breather watching me.”
“GRINGOTTS!” Corrie bellows, just as Eilish plugs her trumpet into her ear.
Harry stares at the setting sun, uncertain how to reply. “About what?” he mutters, shrugging.
“Your mother,” Harry mumbles, and then his conversation with Narcissa comes flooding back and indignation twists itself into the mess swishing around inside him. “Yes. I did speak to her.”
“Yes, thank you,” Draco mutters, checking for customers and then calling out: “Harry?”
Harry lets out a sound that is somewhere between a sigh and laughter, and he rests his head against Draco’s, pressing a kiss to his hair.
“What happened to Magnus and Fergus?” Harry asks. Ivy raises an eyebrow. Harry flushes. “Oh.”
When Draco begins to stir, Harry falls completely still and just watches him, the small actions of yawning and soft grey eyes blinking open making him feel exhilarated and drunk in love. This part of Draco is his and his alone, and waking up with him the past few mornings has set him all off balance in the most wonderful way.
“Draco?” Ron prods. “We have to pick your swan up anyway… which is a weird statement.”
Pansy is, of course, late, but Draco doesn’t care. The sun is rising and filling the studio with warm orange light, his coffee is hot and delicious, and Francis looks uncharacteristically bleary-eyed as he pops his head around the door to say goodbye. It must be time for that switch to what the Muggle salesgirl had called ‘rocket fuel’ coffee, he thinks, putting on a bright, summery record and settling in his chair.
They part ways in a gentle silence that seems underlined by a new fall of drifting snowflakes. Harry stands on the cobbles until people start to bump into him, then wanders to the shop and lets himself in.
“I think I might miss doing all the weird stuff,” he admits. He tips his head back and stares at the bright blue sky. “Maybe just one more.”
“I’m a glutton for punishment,” he admits, pretending not to notice Patrick, who is attempting to hide from him behind a coat stand.
“Will they come, do you think? Her family?”
Harry folds his arms. “Why not?”
“Well, now, aren’t you in good spirits?” comes a familiar voice, and Luna turns to see a plump figure in tweed struggling in through the narrow French windows.
Harry scans the nearby fields, which quickly give way to rolling green hills. There is barely a fence in sight. Pushing down on a flicker of panic, he asks, “Are you sure?”
“Do I want to know?” Draco asks.
She presses a combination of buttons and a blast of tinny music emerges from the telephone.
, is a good question, but as Harry lies there, Christmas lights seeming to glimmer mockingly down at him, he almost doesn’t care. Someone is going to have to have words with Draco, and he’s pretty sure it’s going to have to be him, but not today.
“Nobody is bringing any beetles onto this bus,” Draco says, raising his voice above the increasingly noisy protestations of the engine.
“Alright, then… so what we have to do, when Sam gives the say-so, is be the loudest, most exciting, most ‘look at us, aren’t we brilliant?’ thing these people have ever seen!” she shouts. “Alright?”
“Can I have a lollipop, please?” she asks, glancing at Harry, and then whipping around as the fire artist throws a ring of flame into the air, creating a hissing sound as fire meets snowflakes. “Wow, Uncle Harry, look at that… and the swan’s back!”
“Hermione’s found another man for you,” Ron whispers, leaning closer on the low, squashy sofa in the corner of Madam Malkin’s and almost pitching himself right into Harry’s lap. He prods the soft, slippery fabric. “What the bloody hell is this made from?”
At the sound of muffled voices, Harry turns, just in time to see a small group of first and second-year Gryffindors creeping towards them across the grass.
At the sound of his name, the man looks up, eyes widening comically when the swan forces its head through the flaps of the box and hisses loudly.
“Yeah, I know,” Harry mumbles, one hand coming up to splay against Draco’s jaw as he kisses him again, needing more but needing this, just this.
At the back of the room, Draco has become the most elegant teapot Luna has ever seen, but it is his glimmer that makes Luna stop in her tracks, almost colliding with a slowly-rotating Otis.
“Don’t worry about it. I’m in. I feel loads better,” Harry says, to Ron’s visible relief.
“You ate three packets of pork scratchings in that last pub,” Percy says.
Harry turns to him, drawn so tight by his smile that he doesn’t know if he wants to kiss him or hex him in the face.
“I have scars, too,” he whispers, and Draco’s eyes fly open.
“Good morning, sir,” the officer says, straightening up and peering at Harry in a way that brings to mind an over-eager border collie.
Harry lets out a long breath and smiles back at his friend, pulled one way by affection and then the other by guilt. She knows that he’s keeping something from her, and even though it’s just a couple of bus rides with a man neither of them have seen for years, it’s significant somehow.
“Perhaps that’s because their judgement is impaired,” Draco says.
“What are you going to do with it when it’s finished?” he asks.
Harry smiles and takes his seat. “Well, I’m sure it’ll be fine if she eats it soon.”
Draco stares at him. “There is something very wrong with you.”
“Oww,” says Juno, brushing past his legs and leaping up onto the dashboard.
“We should get her back to the bus,” he says. “We can warm her there and that way we can all go together.”
in his lap. “Oo, and may I add, er.”
“I think it’s one of those things everyone has to experience at least once,” Pansy says.
Draco leans back and regards him with curiosity. “Are you?”
“I heard you this morning,” Harry says. “You were very strident.”
“Er... that’s really not necessary,” Harry says, taking a step backwards. “I’m fine.”
Luna smiles. “I’ll have to tell her that when I see her.”
“Yes. Those are going rather nicely, but most children do not want a quill in their Christmas stocking. It’s always a quiet time of year.”
“Oh... fucking
Harry glances over his shoulder to check on Draco, only to find him engaged in what looks like a very intense conversation with Molly, Ida, and Danica. Deciding to leave him to it, he turns back to Ron.
“Oshun,” she says firmly, picking up another cube, this time containing a flame the colour of honey. “This is your guardian Orisha.”
He holds out a large hand and shakes with Harry and Draco in turn.
“Perhaps they feel they owe it to you... to watch out for you,” Draco says uncertainly. “I can’t complain, not with the things I’ve done.”
“Good grief,” Draco says, pretending to lose his balance on the desk.
It’s working, she thinks. Ron hasn’t mentioned receiving the letters, but he does seem to be baking more often, and Luna thinks she saw a copy of a business lettings magazine poking out of his bag the last time she saw him. It’s not yet time for her to place a large purple tick next to his photograph, but things are progressing nicely, as are her efforts to have a recently-discovered species of exploding stink flower named after Fred Weasley. The campaign has had coverage in the last three issues of the
“He’s with us,” a pink-robed girl tells Harry when he pokes his head back out into the street. “We’ve finished cleaning but there’s a lot of stock from the back that needs to go onto the displays. Honestly, I think he’s enjoying himself.”
“Merry Christmas,” she says, kissing Draco on the cheek and surprising Harry by kissing him too.
By the time Harry breaks the silence, it’s become so comfortable that he almost doesn’t want to ruin it. But he does, because sitting next to someone without exchanging a word is all very well, but when it’s stretching into its second week, there’s a high potential for weirdness. Not that his and Draco Malfoy’s relationship has ever been particularly normal, but there’s a first time for everything, and besides, Harry is intrigued. Draco is quiet and fragile and oddly fierce, like a coiled snake, and yet here he is, arranging pebbles into gradients of colour by the light of a pale summer moon.
“Alright, let’s do this!” George announces, emerging from the crowd and freeing himself from the gigantic jumper.
“Take one end,” Draco instructs, turning away with a little smile and pulling out his wand. “I have a rather good spell for this sort of thing.”
“It’s Sunday,” Deb says, kneeling on the rug and flicking Knuts into neat piles with startling efficiency. “He’s probably catching up on all his studying.”
“Food’s good, too,” Harry says, looking at his boss’s rail thin body and wondering just what is holding it all together. The only thing Mr Borteg ever seems to eat is bits of chocolate from next door, and even those are few and far between. “Do you want me to go and get you a crackleball?”
“I bet you did,” Harry says, suddenly feeling very dizzy.
“You have wet hair,” she says at last. “Both of you. Did you have a nice shower?”
Everything looks homemade and smells delicious, and Harry can’t decide what he really wants most – to find out what on earth is going on here or to pull up a chair and just enjoy it.
“I think the problem is that you’re pointing at a chicken and telling him it’s a fish,” he suggests.
Draco shakes his head, starting the bus after the third attempt. “I think I’ve got an apple in that cupboard next to you.”
“Just add water,” she says cheerfully.
The feeling of compression forces his breath out of him, and in the confusion, he hangs onto the very real handle for dear life.
“We should,” Harry agrees solemnly.
“Inside it is, then,” Harry mumbles to himself, leaving the window behind and starting to wander around the house.
“It’s not that kind of spa day,” Ginny says. “We’ve got to do an exercise class and then we’re getting wrapped up in Kelpie slime and then having lunch.”
All at once feeling weary, Harry picks up Montague and cradles him against his chest, closing his eyes and allowing the warm, furry body to settle comfortably against him.
“Well, yeah… I just thought I’d… you might need some extra help, or something,” he mumbles.
“Why is it so bloody dark?” he whispers.
“What?”
It’s not that he’s nervous… at least, it’s not that he’s
“She’s not a Legilimens, is she?” Harry asks. Hopes.
Next, Harry heads to Cherish, where he knows he can pick up delicious presents for almost everybody. He has learned, through years of trial and error, that simple edible gifts always go down well with his family, and come free of the awkwardness that flashier efforts often bring. He is all too happy with this arrangement, especially where Molly’s fudge and Ron’s chocolate biscuits are concerned. There is always the possibility that Hermione will try to make macarons again, but it’s probably best not to worry about it. Or think about it at all.
“Aunt Mildred’s black hole bread, so you will never go hungry,” Bill pronounces.
“Yes, it’s when you eat in the evening,” Draco says, slipping his hands inside Harry’s coat.
