The meaning of his words barely registered in Harry’s mind, who stood petrified at the sight of the bewildering scene set before him. It seemed unimaginable that Malfoy was crying—actually crying—with heavy tears streaming down his reddened cheeks and joining the flood of water that rose from the grimy basin. Harry wanted to laugh. Had he seen Malfoy absorbed by such anguish at any other point he would have, but standing there, watching Malfoy hurt alone, hidden away from his peers, felt painfully familiar. Normally, he would’ve taken some twisted sort of joy out of Malfoy, the boy who had harassed Harry and his friends so intensely that Dudley would’ve idolised the blond; Harry wanted to feel joy. Merlin, he wanted to sneer at Malfoy just so he could find pleasure in knowing that he could make Malfoy hurt like Malfoy had done to him all these years, but Harry was surprised when he had found no pleasure in seeing Malfoy in this pathetic broken state. In fact, a traitorous part of his mind instead urged him to comfort Malfoy and disgust settled in his throat at the mere idea, so instead he just awkwardly watched the pale body continue to sob and gulp in between pleas for some divine guidance.
Before Malfoy had enough time to pick himself up, Harry was on top of him, kneeling on Malfoy’s thighs and pinning his arms to the ground beside him. Beneath him, Malfoy continued to squirm about, trying desperately to escape Harry’s hold, so that he could once again resume punching the boy. So, Harry instead opted to straddle Malfoy and shifted his weight to completely fall on his already delicate wrists.
The girl shrugged, then said, “Sports, regardless if they are played by wizards or muggles, are intensely boring.”
Confused, but nonetheless relieved by the sudden omission, Harry nodded and quickly turned to shove the unfinished essay into his schoolbag full of other crumpled parchment and textbooks. Hermione stood up and the chair scooted backward in accordance. Hoisting her satchel over her shoulder, Hermione strutted across the alongside the table, mechanically shoving ornately carved wooden chairs back into their proper position as she did so. Harry followed behind her, leaving the books he had snagged from the shelves on the table. The pair passed several rows of bookshelves with a few students still scattered about the tables where they sat engrossed in their own homework, while others sat chatting quietly, only pretending to read whenever Madam Pince passed by like some sort of grim reaper. Madam Pince looked up at the pair, looked at the window, frowned in a way that made the marionette lines around her mouth all the more prominent, then began to chide nearby students for not also leaving the library for the night.
“Er,” Harry stalled, at a loss for what Dumbledore wanted him to disclose. He squirmed uncomfortably and imagined Dumbledore dismissing Harry’s Draco Malfoy theory as Hermione and Ron had done whenever he broached the topic. “Well, I found Malfoy in the bathroom, and he, erm, was alone,” Harry winced at how his phrasing could be interpreted and continued lamely, “And when he saw me, he wasn’t exactly thrilled to see me, sir.”
Harry flinched, and Dumbledore raised his blackened hand to silence Snape while keeping his gaze fic on the boy in front of him.
At that, Hermione frowned rather deeply, although Harry did not notice, seeing as his face was still buried in the Herbology essay he had previously been working on, “I don’t want to pressure you—”
This time when Harry entered the common room only Hermione had waited up for him and he really wished she hadn’t.
“Sessions?” Malfoy sputtered, using the distraction to subtly wipe away the tears that now stained his cheeks.
Harry spun around, shoving the Hawthorne wand in his robe pocket, and drawing his own. A flash of red hair caught his eye, and Harry felt his heart sputter to a halt, then pick-up a normal rate as his arm fell to his side.
When the clock struck noon Snape who had not spoken at all through the duration of Harry’s detention said coldly, “I think that should do for today. You will continue at eight o’clock next Saturday.
Several pairs of eyes, some more hostile than others, followed Harry as he abruptly stood from the table and made his way back towards the entrance. When he reached the entrance, Harry took an abrupt right.
“Leave,” Malfoy’s voice trembled, and it was enough to release Harry from the trance cast by the sight of the Dark Mark.
“Dumbledore can’t do anything,” his voice cracked, and Harry loosened his grip ever-so-slightly, “He’s a weak old man! You think
Meanwhile, sleep evaded Harry and he lay content to stare passively at the incessant lines that curved and swirled neatly within the wood covering of his four-poster bed. He had long abandoned the pursuit of sleep because the moment he forced his eyes shut his mind would force him to recount Malfoy lying unconscious in an ocean of blood creeping ever closer to Harry. Was that what war was supposed to be? Blood that poured through every crevasse sprouting into those crimson spider lilies reaching out to encompass the world. And who was he, a mere boy, to uproot those ugly flowers when he was the one responsible for their blossoming?
“I am?” she asked before rolling her shoulder back and raising her chin up high, “Of course I am—Wait, does this mean?—I’m uncertain what it is you’ve taken from this conversation.”
Harry felt a study blush slowly start to creep across his face, and he returned to his earlier and far more pleasant fantasies of existing anywhere but within the same plane of existence as Draco Malfoy. As Malfoy continued his harsh barks of laughter, Harry felt his chest grow tight as the blush slowly engulfed his entire face. Before he could say anything, however, Malfoy straightened himself with a wild look in his eyes, drew his arm back, and slammed his fist into Harry’s jaw. Caught off guard by the suddenness of everything, Harry fell backward, slamming his back into the metal bars of the hospital bed on his way down. A sharp pain shot through his back and Harry felt a new sense of irony with a fresh wave of pain. Malfoy stood towering above him, with laboured breaths that required his whole chest and glared down at him with a ferocity he had never quite seen before.
Harry leaned back in his chair, stretching his neck side-to-side while eyeing the frown that seemed to be stuck on Hermione’s face. At the very least, it made sense he supposed. Among the students, especially those of pureblood status, sex had always been something not to be discussed as if it were a dirty family secret, and only ever met with hushed, but solemn whispers. As such, it stood to reason that any deviancy would be met with scorn or worse. Actually, he could not remember any mention of homosexuality, at least among the boys, and if there had been such a discussion, he certainly was not an active participant.
“How exactly do you expect me to go about that?” Harry sputtered, “This isn’t some sort of harmless game.”
“Hello, Potter,” the girl spoke up casually as Harry drew closer, “I suppose the rumours were true then.”
He turned back around and saw that Hermione was several steps ahead of him, looking at him with an expression that was a distinct combination of both curiosity and unease.
"Bloody hell, you had me scrubbing under the desks in your classroom," Draco replied, before shoving Remus out of his face, and going to Harry helping him back to his feet.
"Tea, and give me the bloody sandwiches," Draco growled, as he watched George and Lee. "What is this?" He asked, shoving a sandwich in his mouth.
Or when he had been 10 and had been playing with a house-elf, and he knocked over a priceless vase, and Asteria took the blame for it. Or when he'd been 13, and had snuck out to meet a muggle boy, and Asteria claimed that she had told Draco that the muggle was a wizard, and their father had beaten her so hard, he broke her arm. Anytime Draco had done something reckless or stupid, Asteria had taken the blame, and he knew she continued to do it, even when he wasn't aware he'd angered father. She'd end up stuck in bed for an entire summer, but she had always come home from school and returned as if nothing had happened. He always knew she hated coming home, and for the longest time, he'd never understood why she continuously returned, until now. He wanted to take her pain away severely. He wanted to ease her suffering. He had been too young and naive to acknowledge the sacrifice she had made for him as they'd been younger, but now? Now that he was an adult and without her everlasting protection, he felt the need to acknowledge every memory, and felt the guilt, the regret, the need to give her that same protection.
"Kill the spare." She felt the darkness before it hit, and saw the flash of green as she dove, dodging the killing curse.
Voiceless. Never making a sound no matter what happened, no matter who opened the only door, and what that person did. NEVER. MAKE. A. SOUND.
To the Malfoy Manor. Draco kept to the edges of the tree line, staying just out of sight as he looked at his childhood home, it seemed darker and menacing, much different the usual around this time of year. Closing his eyes once more, he could mentally follow his target, as Rowle walked through the Manor and down to the cellar. The wizard then walked back up the steps and headed out the door, disappearing again and Draco followed, arriving at the Ministry. Where Draco once again, waiting on the edges and focused on Rowle's location as he strutted along the Ministry. Draco didn't know the layout well enough to guess the locations but was glad when the man vanished from that location and following, Draco realized that life as a Death Eater seemed to be busy. Draco reformed a few meters ways from Rowle and glanced around, taking in the snow-covered area, his eyes focusing on the angel statue he had seen in Dolohov's memories. Rowle was right next to it and Draco knew this was his best chance, as he followed up and crouched a few feet away, behind a tombstone as the angel statue moved.
"Lucius did this?" Draco's voice seemed to break as he stood, and he spun on Potter. "You knew my father did this?"
"Why do you assume that?" She asked, closing her eyes, regretting her question instantly. Her brother had a tendency to rant for hours about Potter.
Pulling the charmed parchment from his pocket, and realized the house hadn't moved from when he'd last been there. Casting his sister's Disillusionment charm over himself, he stepped forward, and inched out of the woods, startled to see the house. He tossed a revealment charm at it and was equally surprised to find that the wards and charms hadn't been breached or tampered with since they'd left last summer. Draco quickened his pace and pushed the front door open, not startled by the formed dust and complete proof that his sister's home had been untouched, which meant she hadn't broken or meant she was already dead. The charms had been created by Charlie Weasley. He let out an aggressive sigh, and inched inside, silently shutting the door behind him.
"They tortured me, constantly. I never saw or heard anything. I knew by instinct when one of them came in, I could feel the rage they carried." She began softly, aware that someone was standing by the door. "They probed at my mind, trying to get my secrets and Order secrets. I could feel everything, but I was able to separate myself from the pain, it's probably what kept me sane. I imagined a place like this, peaceful and quiet. With you, Harry, and Charlie." She said as tears filled her eyes. "I was horrified by the idea of never seeing any of you again. Not seeing you, Harry, Hermione, Charlie, the Weasley's, mum. I dreamed of it all." She whispered, and let out a breath.
"I just don't want you to get hurt either." Harry breathed, "I can't lose you as well." He added, resting his forehead against Draco's.
"When did you get back?" He asked, he'd grown since she'd seen him last summer, still thin, but long limbs and pale hair. If it wasn't for the thin figures they shared, as well as the grey eyes, or the trademark Malfoy smirk, no one would have been able to see the similarities between them. Contrasting to Draco's pale skin and hair, Asteria's hair was a jet black, thick and straight, and her skin was tanned from her time in America.
"You can all put away your wands and pull out your textbooks, you'll be reading chapter one today. Please no speaking, boys and girls." The high voice snapped both their heads up and they glanced at each other, and Fred raised his hand.
"Sia..." Draco whispered, his voice cracking in pain. She let out a sound and looked at his tear-filled eyes.
"Don't be so charming, Ali. Your very presence has begun to annoy me." Asteria smiled at her obnoxious friend.
"Possibly, but I'm sure there are people who don't think so highly of your father, but you go off what you know. And Draco knows that if he disappoints his father, there will be consequences." Asteria answered with a shrug. "Now, Potter go get some rest, we only have a few more days until the first task." She gave him, her best charming smile, and he nodded, before leaving.
"Incarcerous." She whispered with a flick of her wand and watched as the ropes tied up her father. She glanced back at the castle and her eyes widened as she watched Voldemort's body drop and Harry standing there, he was filthy, his hair even more out of control, blood had already started spotting his clothes, and his shoulders drooped. She picked up Lucius' wand, and shoved his and hers into the back pocket of her pants, and ran, slamming into Harry, wrapping him in her arms.
"Remus is brewing poison antidote's, just to be on the safe side. And I've healed all the bruises, cuts, and broken bones." Molly supplied, before realizing her words as Draco blanched.
"We should go there now, it'll be better for her when she wakes," Molly added, and stood, she motioned to Draco who stood, but the older witch pulled him into a tight, warm hug. And Draco was overwhelmed as it happened. "You've done so well, Draco dear. I'm so proud of you, and she will be too once she wakes up." The witch murmured against his shoulder.
"Eternal ban from Quidditch." Was all he responded, and he dropped his head into his hands and sighed.
The Quidditch World Cup was held in a large field, and Asteria was beyond annoyed already, and they had just gotten there. She currently stood back from her family as her father chatted animatedly with the Minister. She glanced around her, and saw her brother, sneering unattractively at the group next to them. Asteria finally letting her bored eyes focus, noted the red hair and freckles on the majority of the group, Weasley's. Looking among them, she saw a young witch with frazzled hair, and a thin boy with a messy mop of black hair, and the significant lightening scar on his forehead. So this was Potter. She wasn't paying much attention to the conversation, until she heard her father's condescending tone, mocking Mr. Weasley. She could see the anger bubbling in the group, so she let out a sigh, placing an unemotional look on her face.
"You make me sick, I saw you graveling at his feet like a bloody coward." She shoved him away, and his reaction was instant as he swung his cane, but despite her injuries, she was alert, stopping the oncoming weapon with her hand, yanking it out of his hands, and swinging it back, breaking the wood across his face. "Don't you dare, I am NOT a child you can just beat into submission." She tossed the piece of his cane down and didn't acknowledge Alice walking into the room, and stopping to watch her, and her father, who knelt on the ground.
"Oh, Draco, it's beautiful." Harry's voice cracked as he pulled out the delicately woven chain. Draco, unable to speak, stepped forward and pulled the chain from Harry's fingers, and wrapped it around his boyfriend's wrist and it magically snapped on.
"Just go, I'm begging you." She whispered, placing her hand gingerly on his chest. He nodded, and pressed his lips to her forehead, before leaving the way he came, and she slid to the ground. "Shit." She muttered, and went to the dorms and hunted down one of her brother's more normal friends. Theodore Nott. She found him in the common room, book in his hand.
"Maybe." Potter looked at her, "His grandfather's name was Marvolo, I don't know much else about his family, other then they are all dead." He explained.
Currently, he was walking up to Bill and Fleur's seaside cottage, because the rumor was Weasley was there. Upon entering the house, he was shocked to see Ronald sitting at the counter looking pissed. He seemed to have grown a few more inches, but his clothes were dirty and old, and he looked tired as he rested his head on his arms, as Bill berated him.
"Bloody hell, a task in the Black Lake." She muttered, as she stood, and dried her hair with her wand and began the long walk back to the dungeons. She'd have to let Potter know, she'd have to hear the song himself. Simply encase the songs differed from egg to egg. Once back in her common rooms, she was shocked to find the majority of upperclassmen,  4th year to 6th, and Professor Snape, and she slipped inside.
"Bombarda Maximum!" She shouted, the door blowing apart, "Expelliarmus, incarcerous" She shouted in quick succession. Keeping her wand raised, she stepped into the room, her anger barely controllable. "Who the bloody hell are you?" The man in the chair laughed.
"Bill's?" Lupin asked, and Draco nodded. The cottage was far enough out of the way and hidden. It would be a perfect place to hide out with his sister. Maybe he could even convince Ronald to return to his friends.
"Don't focus on my being here, I'll be gone once Fred deems I've eaten enough," Draco responded as Lupin sat down next to him and Fred pushed another sandwich towards him.
"Why would you give him a chance?" She asked, looking at him, gray eyes searching his green ones, and he gave her his lopsided grin.
"Oh, thank you, Headmaster." She smiled at him, before leading Draco to the Slytherin table, sitting down. She pulled her wand from her sleeve, and waved it at her gifts, sending them to her room. Draco sat beside her, and looked at her.
"NO!" Her brother's voice was full of agony, and she could make out the flinch in her mother's features.
"In the book it said nonverbal. Harry never intended to use it, because no one was sure what it would do, but he recognized the scarring around where George's ear was, and told me about it." Draco finished, rubbing his thumb on the back of Asteria's hand.
"I'll stay here for when Harry gets here," Ron whispered, and Draco faltered for a second until he felt a wet spot growing on his shirt from Granger's arm, where she was currently bleeding. Ronald looked uncomfortable but unable to leave until Harry was there, so Draco rushed forward with the others, handing Granger off to Bill and going back out to the beach where he was suddenly rushed and a body was taking him to the ground. Draco's arms wrapped around the body of his boyfriend, who just clung to him tightly. Draco gave a short nod to Ronald as he walked past them, as Draco brought them both into a sitting position, Harry straddling his lap with his head buried in his neck.
"I..-uh.Thanks?" Potter stumbled, before sitting next to her, followed by Weasley and Granger. Asteria didn't speak as she began her essay, the elegant scrawl crossing the page as they worked in silence. A soft huff did draw up Asteria's head and she glanced at Potter and Weasley as the struggled with a potions essay.
"I think they've all lost their minds," Alice responded in kind. "But really, back to the main topic, why'd you go to the Ball with that fourth year?" She asked again. She'd been asking for weeks now, whenever she caught up with Asteria, who would just wave her off.
"Snape asked to speak to him and that was an hour ago, we haven't seen him since." Parkinson supplied, and Asteria looked towards the Black Lake when things finally clicked. The song from the Golden egg, the task tomorrow, something they took, more like someone.
"It started years ago, as a way to honor the founders, one of which was a descendant to Salazar Slytherin. She had never gotten the chance to go to Hogwarts and while fleeing her aunt, found the New World. Her aunt eventually found her, and a fight broke out, March 15th. So every year on that day, we play the game of war." Asteria explained, with a shrug and readjusted how she sat in the hospital bed.
"My capabilities isn't what I'm concerned about, my classmates and fellow students. Some weren't raised or trained like I was." She replied, leaning back into her chair, stretching her legs. "Something has to be done."
"I sent a mutual friend of ours, Asteria, to talk some sense into Tom, to figure out what happened, and the last person saw anywhere near Alice's room was Lucius." Dumbledore supplied, and Asteria nearly broke right there. Her father? Her dark, corrupted father was near Ali?
When Asteria came too, she was in the hospital wing, and there was an odd silence in the room, but she could hear others breathing, she struggled to remember how she ended up here, and the memory surfaced, Alice had been killed, the first casualty of war and Asteria had snapped and completely lost control. She took a deep breath and sat up, frowning slightly at the magical restraint on her wrist. But she understood, they wanted to keep her here, not running around screaming. Using her free hand she rubbed her throat, there was a throbbing feeling in her throat, and her chest felt a little heavy, and her head was aching, but she could handle it. She let out another breath, and leaned back onto the metal post of the bed, and looked around, it was dark, only a lamp lighting the area she was in, the curtains were drawn shut on both sides, but was open in front of her bed, revealing the most peculiar sight she had ever seen.
"Not even slightly, but I will be." She responded, going for honesty. And she pulled herself out of his arms, limping over to Potter.
"I know, but short of killing him, or somehow getting him to physically see Voldemort, there really isn't anything we can do, Sirius." She paused, "Unless we take him away from here." And Sirius' head shot up, and he looked at her with wide eyes.
"I was angry with Albus constantly, I knew that he'd end up leaving this to Harry, putting it on his shoulders, when the boy should be focused on school, his future and love, he's been lacking it for so long." She whispered, her voice full of sadness.
"Oh, sorry. we didn't realize this compartment was taken." The dark-skinned guy answered, his eyes focusing on her tie, and raised an eyebrow.
Something was different, she couldn't really tell what it was. But something in her surroundings had changed. She didn't feel cold, she felt warm. She could hear the soft snores coming from beside her. The only issue was, she couldn't open her eyes, she couldn't move. It was like she was imprisoned. She felt aware, but sleepy at the same time. She just wanted to drift back off, maybe this is what Death is like. Maybe it was her time to go. Like Alice. Like Sirius.
When it did, as usual, she felt as if she left her body. She could picture it clearly in her head, the vision of light, the sounds of waves crashing, the feel of sand under her feet. She could even see herself, sunglasses on her face, leaning against Charlie, her brother, and Potter running in the waves of the ocean. She felt serenity, safety, and peace in the dream her head tried to use to protect her from the pain. Even locked inside her head, she would've felt a probing at her mind for information, but it never came. She hadn't been taken for information on the Order or Potter. She could barely handle the lack of noise, could barely handle the lack of sound, the lack of feeling.
"Expelliarmus!" They shouted nearly together, but Asteria was just a instant faster, and Potter's hand flew out of his hand, but he caught it with his other.
"He is going to make matters worse for Harry." Sirius supplied, and Asteria rubbed her face with her hand and leaned against the door frame.
"You sicken me, Lucius." She responded, and let him walk away from her. "Bastard." She whispered, before putting her head in her arms.
"Asteria saved my life, and Voldemort has returned," Harry responded, eyeing the Tri-Wizard Cup with distaste. And Asteria understood his disgust, this cup had been a portkey to Voldemort, and she was very trusting of it either.
"Draco has been out there, he has been risking his life, gathering information for the Order, he has put his sanity at risk to dispose of Death Eaters and Snatchers so they can't chase after you three. He's been searching nonstop for his sister, since my wedding." Bill yelled at Ron's face. "He's shown more bravery than you have and he is a fucking Slytherin." Bill finished, dropping Ron, who slid bonelessly to the floor.
"Well, that was different." Asteria muttered, straightening her hood. "Okay two more stops, one at the Apothecary, and Scribbulus. There is this quill, its like one of those fancy ones, I wanted to get it for Granger." She supplied and followed her cousin as they walked. The Apothecary treated her like a pariah, but Scribbulus gave her 3 of the magical quills that changed color for different subjects. And they retreated, and headed back to Headquarters, Asteria mentally prepared herself for the argument that she was going to face with Molly once she got back. Slipping into the house, she took the bag from Tonks, who instantly turned a fled, not ready to be faced with Molly's wrath.
"Fleur..." She whispered, before moving towards the right, and she paused at the sight of Krum, who had his eyes on her. "Ah, bloody hell." She muttered, her wand up, when she took note of his face, blank and empty.
"Is it true, about You-Know-Who returning?" He asked, "I mean I know what the Headmaster said, but is it true?"
"I understand, Harry, don't fret. Now, I do have to leave, but don't worry. I won't be far. Ms. Black, you keep in eye on the students and continue the research you are doing for the cause. Minerva, please, don't let Peeves destroy the school. And Harry, my dear boy, don't worry." Dumbledore smiled and vanished with a crack. Asteria gave a flick of her wand, vanishing in the air, her disillusionment charm clicking into place. She didn't want to try and explain why she was there, with a gentle brush to Potter's shoulder, she slipped out the door, and down the steps. Things were going to get dangerous with Dumbledore is gone, she was fully aware of what was going to happen next.
It was short and to the point, and Asteria had an irking feeling in her stomach about whatever it was that Sirius wanted to talk to her about when another owl dropped a letter in front of her breakfast. Only her name graced the front of the envelope, so when she opened it, she was cautious, holding the letter a bit away from her, and revealed a letter from the headmaster.
"Oh, shush. Now, back to funner talk, tell me about the cuties here at Hogwarts." Alice smirked, and Asteria was struck by how similar they were, in truth. Alice Joseph was Asteria's best friend, a half-blood whose family had fled from England back in the time of darkness from Grindelwald.
"Harry feels like it's all on him, because of some prophecy, he believes this war is about You-Know-Who trying to get to him," Draco explained, looking down at his sister. "And in actually that's not the truth. You-Know-Who started this war 20-something years ago, to try and attain more power. I think that Albus made it seem like it was about Harry so that Harry would be willing to do all the work."
"I suppose you aren't exactly giving me a choice, are you?" She smiled, as she stepped closer to him and the cup, and he grinned at her.
"Stay the hell away from my brother." She growled, flinging a spell out. The fight began, spells flying, and Asteria was losing, but she had protected Potter, just long enough for Dumbledore to appear and take over. As Asteria faded in and out behind a boulder. She could see blood seeping out of her, and at some point, it seemed to fascinate her. Her elite pureblood as pooling under her, going to waste as it stained the floor until it was magically erased to hide the evidence from the public, but she'd remember, she'd probably have scars. What a fascinating thought, scars. Was the final thing that floated through her head as she lost consciousness.
Now, she was even more concerned, glancing at her watch, she stood, clutching both letters to her chest and went towards the headmaster's office, she shoved the letters in her pack and took a deep breath before officially approaching the gargoyle guarding the office.
"Oh, Draco." She whispered squeezing his hands. "That isn't as bad as the things that Vold-" Charlie's hand suddenly appeared, covering her mouth.
"Is everything alright, mother?" Asteria was confused, her mother never spent much time in her children's room, and never looked so drained.
Being left alone was disastrous for her mental state. She was left to contemplate the coming battles, the risks to her brother and Potter. The possibility of losing them as she had lost Alice and Sirius. The thought of it all coming to a head stemmed on the delicate fact that she had noticed the old curse lingering on Albus' hand, and had noticed that the usual twinkle in his eyes had dimmed. She knew the old wizard wasn't long for this world, he had already fought one war, defeating Grindlewald, and now he had fought for years against Voldemort. But the idea of losing the face of the Order, the headmaster of Hogwarts was nearly debilitating, but she knew not to speak of it, it would cause a fuss, a divide in the precarious minds of the Order, the population, the Ministry. She swallowed deeply as the thoughts rolled along the edges of her mind.
"Of course." He replied pointing his wand at her. This is was a demonstration, on the tide of battle.
"I bloody hate it when you do that," Draco started, rubbing his face. "But yes, I think this is a brilliant idea, and I think it'll be extremely helpful for those on the run." Draco finished with a knowing look, and Fred and George nodded. They packed up the device and carried it up the hidden set of stairs as a hidden door appeared, and Lupin came through.
"Not for this, maybe not at all." He began, and couldn't seem to stop himself, "I don't really know if you need me, Harry. You aren't exactly open about this, and I'm not good with showing my emotions as it is.
"Let me think about it, please?" He asked, squeezing her hand, and she nodded, he leaned forward and pressed a chaste kiss to her forehead, before slipping out and leaving her alone.
"Thank you, Asteria. I probably would've died if you hadn't been there." He responded, and she placed a gentle hand on his shoulder.
"Alice, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry." Asteria cried out, wishing her friend could hear her, could forgive her. As she babbled apologizes to the skies, she couldn't make it stop, she felt every ounce of pain that her body could, and it was tearing her apart, and she couldn't stop saying she was sorry. "Oh Gods, Ali, I'm so sorry, please, you can't leave." She whispered as the pain became unbearable again, and she screamed out her best friend's name out to the sky. When long arms encircled her, burying their head into her neck. She couldn't make the pain stop.
"She's a Slytherin and a Malfoy! They are all death eaters!" He argued, and she placed a hand on each of the Twins, standing.
"Watch that tone, Dolores," Asteria responded as fury unfolded inside her. "Hagrid, you need to leave, now."
"So, Potter here produced a powerful Patronus Charm, fully corporeal, which is hard for even seasoned Auror's. And this is a disillusionment charm, which is nearly impossible to see past, I used it to sneak into Potter's trail this summer." Asteria spoke, putting her wand into the side of her boot. Now, some of you may have seen me used that charm during the First Task, last year, it is hideously complicated magic, and can be temperamental, because it relies on everyone else being distracted."
"A room on the Seventh floor. It doesn't go into specifics, but I've read about the term before. At Illvermorny, we had a class about forbidden magic, we spent a few days on it, my professor went in great detail to explain the dangers on of this magic, but he never explained how it was done. But if I remember the ingredients correctly from last year; bone, flesh, and blood." She rambled off and stopped.
"You're a traitor, Malfoy," Flint shouted, finally lifting his wand and pointing it at Draco, but it wavered slightly. Flint had always been an idiot, unable to duel those deemed superior to him. Draco laughed, darkly, as the wordless spell flew from his wand, shooting Flint with a red spell as the stunning spell him and flung the older Slytherin backward. Draco didn't hesitate when he flung himself back into the fight, flinging spells left and right, catching sight of Fred, one of his favorite Weasleys a smile was lighting up the redhead's face, as his eyes caught Draco who couldn't help but return the smile as the battle raged on.
"Please, sir. I highly doubt Professor Dumbledore would put his students, especially a 14 year old boy in such a dangerous position. If he had wanted a leg up, he would've picked someone, who was one; at least 17, and two; probably top of their class," Asteria interrupted, "This is probably a crass plan to get Potter hurt or in trouble, someone tampered with it just to put Potter in danger, considering the likelihood of him surviving is slim." She paused, "No offense Potter."
"So things got rough, and Weasley ran?" Draco spoke up, drawing everyone's attention, and Ron winced.
Draco laid back on Asteria's bed, and looked at the ceiling, and thought over the things he knew. His father had been in Azkaban during the battle at Hogwarts in June, so he wasn't the one who did it, Bellatrix had been up in the Astronomy tower, which meant it hadn't been her. He went over the mental list of Death Eaters involved; Snape, Bellatrix, Yaxley, Greyback, the Carrow siblings, Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, Rowle, Gibbon, and Selwyn.
"Asteria, are you sure you should be out of bed? You took some serious injuries, last night." He asked, his voice soothing.
"Blimey, Draco." Harry started and cocked his head to the side. "Firstly, I do need you, I need you safe, which is why I don't want to drag you into this mission, but I also know you have your own, because of Asteria. Who I want to come home as badly as you do.
"It wasn't a dream, it was real!" Potter's voice echoed down the stairwell, and Asteria slipped into the room, and looked around, taking in the state of sleepwear and winced at the fact that she still wore her normal clothes.
Asteria grumbled to herself as she caught up on defensive magic, rereading books to be prepared so she at least didn't die in the process. She knew chances were practically in her favor, Potter being 14, though luck did seem to run on his side; Krum, while capable, was a bit slow on some things, and Fleur, had never been much of a competitor, even from the beginning. She winced at the thought, the Beauxbaton champion wasn't cut out for the viciousness of this tournament and had adamantly voiced it. Asteria leaned back in her chair in the corner table of the library and let out a noise or exasperation. Alice had spent time with her, earlier in the morning, but vanished hours ago, to spend time with Fleur. Draco had snuck food into the library earlier on, making sure she had gotten some food but hadn't stuck around.
"True enough. I can see what Harry sees in you." He finished with a knowing look, and Draco blushed softly.
She was startled out of her thoughts as food appeared before her on the table, she didn't think she could stomach it if she was being completely honest with herself. So she put some soup in a bowl and made it look like she was eating as she glanced around the Great Hall. She noted the vague differences here at Hogwarts compared to her time at Illverymore.
"Welcome to the Knightbus," O'Connor said in a deadpan voice, and it drew Draco's attention. Something was off about the boy, who seemed to be staring out the window, not seeing anything.
Asteria was tense, as she stepped through the fireplace grate to her family's manor. While the young witch had only been gone for a school year, she knew things were changing, especially since her father was transferring her school back to Hogwarts. She vaguely remembered the large castle, having only spent her first year there, before transferring to Illvermorny, the school in America for witches and wizards. She had never really understood why she had been transferred and her younger brother hadn't; not that she had ever asked. But at 16, Asteria had long since learned not to question her father's motives. She brushed off her black pants, and adjusted her shirt, before pausing.
Their relationship had come from nowhere. A friendship bloomed from the mutual worry from Asteria's loss. Than late nights sneaking around after the fight on the Quidditch pitch, planning for the DA and complaining about Umbridge had drawn them even closer, and Draco had discovered his attraction to the dark-haired wizard, fully prepared to die with that secret until Harry had kissed him out of the blue, in a darkened corridor outside the Gryffindor Common room. Things had progressed quite naturally from there. When he wasn't in detention, studying with his friends, or the DA, he made time to go to the kitchen's with Draco a snack/desert date, and they spoke of all things; things that made them happy or sad, angry or envious, and the things they missed. It had been simple and different than anything Draco could imagine. His various relationships among his Slytherin cohorts had been about satisfying his father's ideas of how a Malfoy should behave. Random trists and lustful encounters had meant nothing to Draco in the long run, but what he had with Harry was real, and everything about the relationship always felt new and fresh, because it was his choice, his wants, his needs that led him to Harry.
"As am I, I know how close you two were," Draco added, reaching up and taking her hand into both of his.
"I love you too, Charlie." She responded softly and he smiled at her. He stood, helping her to her feet, as he pulled her into his arms.
"I need you to go to an address and lay some protection charms, I bought a house. It's small but has enough room, and since my mother relinquished her rights, I need it ready for Draco." She whispered, and he nodded. "It's already furnished, and ready, but I just worry about protection."
"We had to start hiding to avoid their punishments and things like that. It's been difficult, but so far we've been good." He finished and she nodded before looking at Harry, who was sheepishly facing the crowd of students and Order members.
"Is that Asteria?" The younger witch asked, and Draco nodded, and looked to his right, seeing the reef of lilies at Harry's mother's grave.
"Yea-yeah. Asteria, you look magnificent." Nott stumbled out, walking towards the stairs to hold out his hand, his obvious pureblood upbringing coming out, and playing the perfect gentleman. She took his hand, and let him help her down the rest of the steps, before he led her out towards the Great Hall.
"Listen, you and the others have to stay until you are at least 17, because of the Trace, which is only in a few days, then you will leave, and save the world." Draco said, kissing the back of Harry's hands. "Then you will end this shit with Voldemort and we can all move on with our lives."
With the end of March, she could feel the crisp weather slowly beginning to warm. She kept her hood off as she stared at the ocean. She shrugged off her black cloak and used it to sit on, as she kicked off her boots. She'd burned down her home, and now she had to prepare for a coming battle. She knew the Trio was still hunting Horcruxes and Draco was hunting the Snatchers and Death Eaters, while she was essentially stuck. He'd made her promise not to get involved, and she hadn't. She was focused on training and trying to figure out what she was going to do.
"I know, Sia." He responded with a heavy sigh, leaning in his chair. "Doesn't mean I have to like it."
"You were supposed to protect me, that's what a father does. You aren't supposed to make the pain worse." She watched the realization cross his face before he looked down. "You'll die in Azkaban, Lucius Malfoy, and only your choices made it so." Harry tugged on her arm, pulling her shaking body away from the prisoners, and Draco pulled her to his chest, Harry still at her back, guarding her against others.
"I don't know what we will have to do and how the dragons are involved, but I know they are." He added, and he just looked scared and stressed.
Quicker on the draw than most, her brother was in front of the table before anyone else had read their note, surprising the new Headmistress, who he then handed Asteria's note too, whose eyes went wide, and she smiled. Draco then pulled his sister out from behind the table and Charlie began to choke. Identical grey eyes watched him as he had attempted to shovel food in his mouth and read the note. She heard a whoop from the Gryffindor table as Ronald and Harry began celebrating, laughing with Granger and Ginny, Granger sending confetti down the table as Asteria finally began to laugh. Her brother followed as Charlie finally got up from his table and wrapped her in his arms.
"Did you know, not a single person has survived a year in the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts?" She asked the plump witch, who looked at her dumbfounded. "Here is to another death to follow Quirrell." Asteria finished, and waved her wand at McGonagall, levitating her off the ground, and beginning the trek back to the school. She paused and faced the crowd of Ministry employees.
"The old operator of the Knightbus completely meddled his mind, and dropped the kid on my doorstep." Ernie supplied and let out a sigh. "Don't know why Stan did it, always thought he was a stand-up guy. He's taken up with You-Know-Who."
"Draco, no matter what happens, it doesn't matter. Just know that I will always love you and fight for you." She whispered, tossing an arm over his shoulders.
As dinner ended, and she followed the student body back to their common rooms, she caught a glimpse of Moody, as he stalks after the Headmaster of Durmstung. Part of her wanted to follow but knew better than risk getting caught out after curfew. She slipped up to her dorm, casting a soft glance at her brother, who seemed engrossed in a piece of parchment. A blush had crept up his pale neck, and he tossed the letter into the fire, and shoved his hand into his pockets, before heading towards his own dorm. She quirked an eyebrow as she watched. Was he seeing somebody? Or was he simply interested in someone? Asteria shook her head and finished slipping into her dorm, and fell face first into her bed, still in her uniform. She was exhausted, the feet upon feet of an essay's from her classes and the stress from the tournament. She grumbled into her pillow, this isn't what she wanted, at all. She had to plan her entry into the tournament and make sure she was seen entering, so it got back to her father that she tried. She buried her face deeper into her pillow, kicking off her shoes. And letting sleep take over her mind, and surrendered to the darkness.
"Well, my dear, I forgive you. Being raised as you were, some things are so hard." Molly said, pulling back and glancing at Arthur who gave her a smile, and then she focused her eyes on Asteria. "So, what exactly is the plan?"
Draco kept to the dark, his arms draped over Harry's shoulders, but he wasn't listening. He really couldn't lose Harry as well as his sister. But he'd find her, he knew what he was going to do, he had spoken to Tonks, and Charlie and they had laid out delicate plans for all of it. While the search would mostly be on Draco, himself, he had made the plans with the others to get different perspectives. He'd be stuck traveling simply, even though he was 17 already, but he had his plans laid out. When Harry and his friends left for their search, he would leave as well.
"Has that damned Headmaster lost his mind?!?" Asteria finally snapped, staring at the letter in her hands. She had repeated this statement 10 times since opening her school letter. After celebrating Ron and Granger's rise to Prefect, she opened her letter to learn, she'd risen to Head Girl.
"I used Legilimency to get the information and saw this repeating Angel statue, but I could tell it was a cemetery, and then I saw a name, and it was only in passing, but it was near the statue," Draco explained and Lupin looked at him confused. "Lily Potter." Lupin visibly stiffened.
"A spoiled brat? That's a good one." Asteria let out a humorless chuckle. "But I am protecting these 'children'" she responded.
"Well, what's this plan of yours?" Asteria said, changing the subject, which got both Draco and Potter back on the right track.
Draco lifted his head as the room started to clear out and Harry sagged against him in defeat. Draco offered unending support as his boyfriend, took deep breaths. Draco sighed at the weight, and let out a breath, as Harry clasped one of his hands, and kissed the inside of his wrist.
"No need to worry, little brother." She said, glancing at her mother, whose eyes seem to bore into her soul, "Father's out there, you are safe." And her mother's eyes widened, and a hand covered her mother.
"Sia, it's me, Draco." His voice soft and she slowly shook her head, opened her mouth, and shut it again. "I'm going to take the blindfold off okay?" He whispered, reaching up and pulling the black fabric off her face. He nearly sobbed at the sight of her unfocused gray eyes, and focused on him, taking in his face. She cocked her head to the side as her eyes rolled up and shut.
"Boy, Girl, everyone." Her unmistakable high voice grated on Asteria, but she didn't move, and nearly cried in desperation as Fred, the worst on the Twins took a seat next to her, and flashed his trademark grin that screamed trouble. She let her head fall onto the table with a thud on the desk.
"I concur, but I can't leave her to suffer or not know what happened to her," Draco added, closing his eyes. "The others have returned, I can hear them."
Umbridge seized the girl, pulling her round to face her, and shaking her very hard. A split second later, and Dumbledore was on his feet, his wand drawn; there was something about the very sight of the powerful headmaster, with his wan drawn that froze the room. He seemed furious, and Asteria prepared for a fight, ready to remove her influence from the witch.
"At my old school, it was a game we played, always separated by years. There were two sides, you get picked for one, and you have a mock battle. We used a spell that shot paint at your opponents, each color stood for a different spell." She explained, "America is rich with battle history, they have fought in many wars, and it was just something the school did. After my first year there, I was given the moniker of the strategist, because I never lost." She smiled and shrugged her shoulders.
"You forget yourself, Lucius," Charles said.  "You never beat me once in a duel when we were in school, so even if you weren't unarmed, you couldn't stand against me."
“Ryan, there’s an old Muggle saying,” Justin said. “Seeing is believing. Perhaps we should just take them to Rowena’s quarters. They’ll have no choice but to believe you then.”
“What in Merlin’s name are you doing?”  Rufus demanded, as he pulled out his wand.  “Desist at once!”
Sixteen-year-old Draco Malfoy emerged from his morning shower, and after drying his hair and wiping the excess water off of his skin, he wrapped the towel around his waist and went into his room to get dressed for the day. Having celebrated his sixteenth birthday only two days prior, Draco just couldn't help but think of his mixed feelings in terms of his next birthday. On one hand, he was happy that he was only a year away from his age of majority, which meant that he'd finally be able to do magic whenever he wanted without having to worry about the underage restrictions along with learning how to Apparate and the like. On the other hand, though, he also dreaded his seventeenth birthday because he knew that his father would very likely invite the last person in the world that Draco would want attending his birthday party.
“What you probably don’t know is that when we were all younger, Godric and Salazar were married and they had a son together named Alaric.  Unfortunately, shortly after he turned nine, Salazar began to give him potions lessons and one day there was a terrible accident in his lab and Alaric died.  Godric blamed Salazar for their son’s death and ultimately it broke them up and they were bitter rivals from that day on.  I can only assume that Godric’s hatred of Salazar hadn’t abated by the time he was the only one of us left and he amended the Sorting Hat’s memories to make it say that Salazar was a Muggle-hating monster, which I guarantee he wasn’t.  I’m certain of that because when Salazar later re-married and had more children, one of his daughters married a Muggle-born and he accepted the boy into the family with open arms.”
“You found a way to protect against the Unforgivables?”  Harry asked.  “Is that why I didn’t die when Voldemort cast the Killing Curse on me when I was a baby?”
Dumbledore smiled and looked at Ryan over the top of his half-moon spectacles, “And how did you come to this conclusion, if I may ask?”
Finding Tom Riddle right where he’d left him, Voldemort smiled and said, “I’ll have to kill that stupid child for lying to me. Honestly, to think that my prisoner had somehow escaped – it’s ludicrous.”
Godric remained silent for awhile and then said, “You’ve given me quite a bit to think about, Aarik.  If you’ll excuse me, I’d like to be alone now.”
Draco looked at the hand for a moment and then looked up at Harry for a moment and said, “I don’t understand.”
“Well, you two went to the Ball together,” answered Harry.  “And you were stuck to each other like glue every time I saw the two of you during the course of the night.”
“I’ve been to Tartarus and back, Professor.  Beyond that, well, your questions will be answered in time,” Draco said, before looking at all of the professors and adding, “Now, however, I suggest that you all prepare yourselves for the biggest shock of your lives.”
A couple minutes later, the Bloody Baron appeared in the room.  Peeves gulped and said, “Hello, Your Bloodiness.”
Lucius' wand flew from his hand and he spun quickly on his heel to see who had disarmed him.  Recognizing the lone man standing in the doorway of Draco's bedroom, he exclaimed, "You!"
“None taken, Headmaster,” Snape said.  After a moment, Snape’s face changed, as the fear he was feeling inside, slipped through his mask.  “Speaking of being a marked Death Eater, Headmaster, at the meeting tonight Voldemort said that in taking the Mark, we’ve all condemned our souls to the Hells for eternity.  I’ve never given much thought to the afterlife, but given the choice, I really would prefer not to spend eternity in the Hells.”
“Yes, Justin, at least by Atlantean standards it is,” Valen said with a grin.  “In fact, it may shock you to hear this, but the age of majority in Atlantis is 120 years.  That may seem like an awfully long time to wait to become an adult, but considering how long lived we are, it just wouldn’t be appropriate to say that one was an adult at such a young age like 17.”
Harry was sitting alone on the edge of the lake, lost in his thoughts.  Over the past several days, he’d been watching Draco and he would have had to be blind not to see the change in him.  Draco still insulted him every now and then, but something about the look in Draco’s eyes when he did it told him that it was no more in jest than anything else.  In fact, in the last few days, Harry saw a side of Draco that at one time he would have bet all the galleons in Gringott’s that it didn’t exist.
“Sure, Ron,” Harry said with a smile.  Harry truly had missed his best and first friend, so he was happy that the distance between them was finally over.
debacle, but they were no longer angry about his relationship with Nick.  Of course, now that they’d had a chance to get to know him, both Molly and Arthur said that even if he were related to Voldemort, they wouldn’t have held it against him.  As a very wise person once said, “You can choose your friends, but you can’t choose your family.”
The Ball lasted well into the night, before finally dieing down at about midnight. As the last of the stragglers left the room, only a handful of people remained, all of who knew that Ryan was Rowena’s heir.
Congratulations though on your OWL results. You do your former Ravenclaw mother proud." After a minute longer, Narcissa ended the hug and smiled at her son before asking, "How about we go swimming for a little while before breakfast?"
One of the guards opened the doors for the group to allow all the spirits to pass through them, but the guard quickly closed the doors before Draco could do so.
It was Bill, who helped Harry come to terms with them.  Once their letters got personal, Bill felt that he should be totally honest with Harry, and told him that he was gay.  Reading those words on the parchment was an experience that Harry would probably never forget, and he felt like a weight had somehow been lifted off of his shoulders.  He no longer felt alone in the world, and it wasn't long, with Bill's help, that Harry accepted the fact that he was gay.  It also wasn't long afterward, that Bill's visits to Privet Drive became more frequent.  The Dursleys were none too pleased with Harry for having a frequent visitor, much less a wizard. However, despite any qualms they may have had about it, they were afraid that if they told the man Harry introduced as Bill, to leave and never come back, that they'd be getting a visit from that strange old man with the spinning eye.
“Yes, he was working on that potion actually,” confirmed Helga.  “He thought he needed several extinct plants and herbs to make the potion work, so he was often asking me to grow them for him in large quantities.”
“I don’t recall Binns talking about Azkaban,” Harry replied. “The only things I remember him talking about are the Chamber of Secrets and goblin wars. If he talked about anything else, I was sleeping through it.”
Taking a deep breath, Draco strode forward towards the massive throne.  Valshar was easily the size of a giant and was mostly skeletal in appearance, with his face and hands being the only parts to still have any flesh - dark gray, rotted flesh, but still flesh.  As Draco approached Valshar, he was thankful that the reverse Dementor effect Asheera had mentioned proved to be true.  When he couldn't feel any negative emotion, his good emotions, such as his love for Aarik, shown through and gave him the courage to do what he came for.
“What seems to be the problem, Corelian?”  Calliara asked.  “Not that we aren’t pleased to meet Minister Scrimgeour, but why have you brought him here?”
Godric sighed and said, “No, I suppose it isn’t.  I’m only a portrait though; I fail to see how I can be of much use.”
At this point, Asheera took over.  “The Kingdom of Atlantis was not always underwater.  At one time our continent was just like all the others above water, with one distinct difference: the entire continent of Atlantis was much like your village of Hogsmeade with witches and wizards as the only residents.  However, as time passed, it became increasingly harder to protect Atlantis from Muggles as they began to develop ways of sailing across the oceans and landing on our shores, trying to claim this new world as they saw it for themselves.  The other magical communities of the world were very small and it was easy to hide them from Muggle view, but it would have taken an enormous amount of magic to hide an entire continent and keep it hidden forever.
“So, let me get this straight,” said Corelian.  “You intend to bring seven children into this world after performing a soul-bonding ritual that will bind your souls together for eternity?”
Asheera had certainly piqued Draco’s curiosity, and he knew that sitting around in the bell tower was not going to accomplish anything, so he went along with Asheera to see this alleged ultimate gift.
The look in the Minister’s face made it clear that he did not like being forced to admit that he was wrong aloud.  The look on the Queen’s face, however, made it clear to him that he wasn’t going to get away without admitting it, so he said, “Yes, Your Majesty, I’m willing to accept that Atlantis still exists.  I can’t very well deny the fact when I can see the proof with my own eyes.  As for Mr. Laitannen, consider the charges against him dropped and upon our return to the Ministry, I shall order that his wand be returned to him post haste.”
“Then you needn’t worry,” Dumbledore said.  “I think once Voldemort is gone, your scar will likely be gone with him.”
I realize I've gotten slightly off track here, but I've found this journal to be very therapeutic. So, even if I sit down intending to write about one subject, I've found that it's best to just lose myself in writing and write whatever comes to mind. In terms of Ryan and Nicolas visiting, I've gotten to know them both a bit better over the last few days since we met on Diagon Alley. They're both really nice guys and even Ron seems to like them and isn't holding the fact that Nicolas was sorted into Slytherin against him. Of course, considering that Nicolas loves Quidditch and chess about as much as Ron does, it was really only a matter of time before they struck up a friendship, regardless of his house.
The potion was transported up from the lab to the common room, as Salazar didn’t want an army of people in his lab and it would be easier for everyone to gather around the cauldron in the common room then in the lab.
"Now, to return you to the Land of the Living," Valshar said, as he again turned to one of the guards and said, "Summon the Dullahan and prepare the coach!"
With that, Hermione and Justin walked calmly down the hall and turned the corner that Filch had just come from.  Filch stood there for a few minutes, clenching his fists, mumbling about students being out of bed and not being able to do anything about it, such as drag them down to the torture chamber and punish them, before he continued to stalk down the hallway.  Once Harry was sure he was gone, he walked over to where the map showed Ryan standing and said, “Its okay, he’s gone.”
Tom screamed in pain and as much as he didn’t want to, he soon found himself begging for mercy.  Voldemort stopped his assault and banished the whip, as Tom began crying, his tears stinging his wounded and burned flesh.
“Wow,” Draco said, after being filled in about the real threat to not only the Wizarding world, but the whole world.  “I would never have guessed in a million years that the Dark Lord wasn’t human.”
Exiting the throne room, King Erevan and Queen Calliara led their ‘guests’ into the entry hall of the palace.  Everywhere a person looked the trappings of royalty and immense wealth could be seen.  From the fifty-foot high vaulted ceilings, to the intricate black and white marble floor.  Three of the walls were made of white marble and were capped with intricate crown moldings made of solid gold.  The fourth wall was dominated by a large mural that depicted the Olympian pantheon, each god and goddess painted in vibrant colors, with Patron Deity of Atlantis, Poseidon, and his wife, Amphitrite, at the center.
“Never will I allow a half-breed bastard to set foot in Atlantis!”  King Tyriand roared.  “If you want Corelian’s bastard son to come here, Erevan, it will be over my cold, dead body!”
“Yeah, I know it is.  Makes me glad to be a wizard,” Matthew said as he conjured up a cardboard box and began to pack his father’s belongings.  More tears fell during this time, but Oliver was there for him, and that made the task much easier to bear.
Colin didn’t even have time to take one step as he was consumed in red smoke and disappeared from sight for a second before reappearing back in the Gryffindor common room.  Harry closed the fireplace and then turned to look at Colin, who looked a bit unsure of himself now that his all time favorite person was glaring daggers at him.  The commotion from the common room drew an audience and several more members of Gryffindor House who had been in their dorm rooms were now filing down the stairs to see what was going on.
Despite what Bill and Hermione said, Ron is still taking immense pleasure from what happened to Malfoy, he’s just being careful not to do it in front of Hermione.  Ron hasn’t tried to give Neville any points for breaking Malfoy’s nose, but Ron did convince Neville to play a game of wizard’s chess with him last night.  I watched enough of the match to know that Ron was purposely playing badly, probably figuring that after what Neville had done, if he couldn’t give him points, he’d at least give Neville bragging rights that he’d beaten the undisputed Gryffindor chess champion.  It’s not like it would be hard for Ron to schedule a rematch later and mop the floor with Neville, because Ron was hands down the best chess player in the tower.
Before Charles can say anything else, Matthew and Oliver walk into the room, but seeing as how they are busy kissing each other as they're walking, they don't notice Draco or Charles standing in the room until Charles clears his throat.
Narcissa and Draco left on their little vacation a week before his birthday, so after spending the last nine days relaxing on a tropical beach, Draco's normally deathly pale skin did get a bit more color to it. He was still pretty pale after spending most of his childhood indoors, but it was certainly an improvement. Narcissa told him that he looked much better now and she was quite happy that he didn't resemble a walking corpse anymore. Draco laughed at that and had to agree.
“So, he has prevented me from forcing his return, I see,” Asmodeus said. “He’s bound himself to over two thousand mortals – impressive. But, if he thinks for one minute that he’s going to unseat me, the all-powerful Asmodeus, he is sadly mistaken.”
Aarik nodded and then said, “As for me, much like Draco, I don't think I ever really hated him; disliked him, yes, because quite honestly he was an insufferable prick for many years.  However, since he witnessed your death, Mrs. Malfoy, I've been able to see a side of him that I doubt he's ever shown many people.  It was probably mostly due to fear of what Lucius would do to him if he did.  Draco has never even considered supporting Voldemort, but he never told his father that directly because he was afraid of what he would do.  Rightfully so, I would say, considering the kind of man that Lucius is."
“You’re my father?” a voice asked from the doorway and Corelian stood to see Ryan standing there, along with Valen and Justin.
‘Poor Draco,’ Blaise thought as he looked between Draco and Pansy.  ‘Her mind is already working out a new plan for getting into his pants and using this dance to do it.  I’m sure she already thinks it a given that Draco will ask her to be his date.  Regardless of the fact that Draco told her he’s gay last year.’
“Well, grandmother,” Nick said, “I’m sure you must have some idea.  Bill was a Gryffindor in school and I’m a Slytherin.  With Voldemort’s rise to power, many people have begun to think of all Slytherins as the embodiment of evil.”
“I’m not really sure how to answer that, Bill.  I mean, I have no experience with the Draco Malfoy of last year to go by, but as far as I can tell, he’s a good guy.  Other then Blaise Zabini, Draco is the only boy in my year that I really trust.  Crabbe and Goyle are as dumb as posts, but it’s obvious that they intend to become Death Eaters like their fathers.  Nott is quiet and reserved, but it’s also pretty obvious that his loyalties lie with You-Know-Who.”
“Well, it’s very tempting,” said Draco.  “However, I am a Slytherin and we are all about self-preservation.  I’m not sure if I’m up to risking my life.  I mean, how am I supposed to succeed in completing the challenge that Valshar gives me?  I’m a sixth-year student for Merlin’s sake!  I’m nowhere near powerful enough to handle anything that Valshar might throw my way.”
Almost immediately, Draco grabbed his head, as his mind was flooded with hellish memories and nightmares that he would rather forget.  In the back of his mind, he knew that he a curse must be the cause of it, but with the horrible images pushed to the forefront of his mind, everything from his father’s abuse to watching his mother’s death, he couldn’t think about anything else.
Matt continued to kiss and lick his way downwards, until finally he reached Oliver's throbbing cock. Pausing for a brief moment to smile up at his lover, Matt then leaned down and placed a kiss on the head, causing Oliver to moan. Encouraged by Oliver's obvious pleasure, Matt slowly began to run his tongue up and down Oliver's shaft. After a few more minutes of teasing Oliver with his tongue, Matt decided to put him out of his misery, so to speak, and took Oliver's length into his mouth. Oliver let out another loud moan and buried his hands in Matt's hair, encouraging him to continue going down on him.
“As for Plato’s account of Atlantis,” King Erevan said, “about the only things he got right were the approximate time that the kingdom sank and the fact that we had a strong navy.  We never conquered anyone nor did we try.  Shortly after the founding of Atlantis, my ancestors signed a sacred pact with the Olympians called the Symphonia Ithikos, which stated that, none of the Olympians would ever step foot on Atlantis in anger in exchange for us not fighting anyone except in self-defense.  We Atlanteans are scholars who strive to further the study of magic as far it can possibly go.  We are more then capable of defending ourselves if the need arises, but we would never attack any other country or group without being attacked first.”
Arriving at the end of the hallway that the kitchen was in, Zacharias counted the bricks to find the one Rowena had said and then traced Helga’s initials on the brick.  Ryan, Hermione, Harry, and Justin stood with baited breath, watching as the three letters began to glow on the brick, except that they were bright yellow, instead of blue like Rowena’s quarters.  The sound of stone moving against stone sounded as the doorway opened and Zacharias stepped through the doorway.
“I can certainly attest to that,” Harry said.  “He’s actually the only person I’ve ever kissed, but it’ll be pretty hard for anyone to beat him.”
Bill tried to catch Nick, but wasn’t quite fast enough and got pulled down with him. The two men landed in the grass in a tangle of limbs, with Nick lying on top of Bill. Nick looked down into Bill’s eyes and stared, mesmerized, for a few seconds before he decided to close the distance between their lips. It wasn’t long before Bill was eagerly returning the kiss as he raised his arms from the ground and wrapped one around Nick’s waist, pulling him closer, and placed his other hand behind Nick’s head.
“Well, you asked if I lost my virginity to Weasley,” Harry said.  “I said yes, which is true because I did.  Just not the Weasley you think it is.  Ron does have five older brothers you know.”
Rowena Ravenclaw’s portrait has provided some very interesting information.  I know for a fact there are many wizards who would say that she was a raving lunatic who didn’t know what she talking about for saying that there is no difference between Muggle-borns and purebloods.  Of course, seeing as how I’ve never really believed in all of the pureblood crap that my sire has preached to me all my life, I choose to believe that what Rowena said was true.
I’ve gotten off track here, haven’t I?  Of course, it’s probably because I simply am trying to avoid writing what is floating through my head, as if writing it will make it even more real.  I love Harry Potter, but I have always thought that there is no way that he could love me in return.  Now, I’m even more convinced of that fact.  Of course, his name is actually Aarik Potter, as I’ve recently found out, which gives me even more reason to believe that he could never return my feelings.  He’s the heir of Godric Gryffindor and as such, a member of one of the most powerful and famous wizading lines in existence, how could he ever love me?
Sixteen-year-old Ryan Cromwell was sitting in a chair in the living room of his grandmother's small cottage, reading a large, leather-bound copy of 'Shakespeare's Complete Works'. Ryan was born in Yorkshire, but for reasons that she never really explained to him, his grandmother Lucinda packed him up and moved with him to Asheville, North Carolina when he was ten. That was classic Lucinda Cromwell though, as she oftentimes made decisions for other people and just expected them to go along with it, with little to no explanation.
“So, I hear you claim to be an ambassador from Atlantis,” Rufus said.  “You must understand, of course, how unbelievable that is.  Atlantis was destroyed thousands of years ago.”
"Of course," Narcissa said as she handed Ollivander the goblet of wine, which he took a sip of and smiled.  "Excellent vintage, Mrs. Malfoy, truly excellent - only a perfect match could result in such fine display of wand work.  The fir wand is definitely for you."
“I guess it’s a good thing that there’s a spell to let same-sex couples have children,” Aarik said.  “We’re both gay, so, that would mean the end of the Malfoys and Potters if there wasn’t.”
"Yes, sir," Barin answered as he disappeared, only to return moments later through the door, accompanied by a tall, black haired man in flowing black robes.
“You have no choice!”  King Tyriand yelled.  “I am the King of Atlantis; the all-powerful ruler of all things Atlantean.  If I say that you will stand here and listen to me calling your son a bastard, then you will do it.  My word is law!”
A bolt of red lightning shot out of both of Voldemort’s hands as a fierce wind blew through the room. Above Voldemort’s head a cloud began to gather and as everyone in the room watched, wondering what was going on, several more bolts of red lightning struck Voldemort and he instantly began to get bigger. His robes ripped to shreds as his limbs grew bigger and muscular. Razor sharp talons appeared on the tips of each of his fingers, a long, forked tail appeared and a pair of fiery wings sprouted from his back. A pair of horns, black as the ebony of his throne grew from his head, and his flesh, once a deathly pale white was now a vibrant red.
‘Hmm, I probably shouldn’t have told him anything.  He’d have my head on a platter if he knew I told anyone.  Oh well, its easily fixed.’
Chancing a look in Ron’s direction, Harry could see him glaring daggers at his brother for assigning him a seat next to a Slytherin.  If Bill noticed this however, he chose to ignore it, as he walked back to the front of the classroom and said, “Now, I suggest that you all get comfortable with the people you are sitting next to, because they will be your partners for the rest of the year.  If you have any personal differences between you, I highly suggest you leave them at the door, because your grade in the class will depend on your ability to work together with your partners, and I will not hesitate to fail each and every one of you, if necessary.”
“I can understand how that might take some getting used to,” Angelique said.  “It’s going to take some time for me to get used to as well.”
"Well, maybe she isn't dead yet," Ryan said in a desperate tone of voice. "Call a healer over here!"
"This isn't Order business," Dumbledore said. "It is potentially upsetting however, but I fear that we must get this over with. I've called you all here tonight to discuss Sirius Black, or, more specifically, his last will and testament."
“He doesn’t,” answered Nick.  “It’s recently come to light that Tom Riddle is not Voldemort.  To make a long story short, Tom Riddle has been Voldemort’s prisoner under a Dark Arts version of the Time Suspension charm since the spring of 1942.  Voldemort is, in fact, a lesser devil whose goal here on Earth is to turn it into the Tenth Hell and usurp Asmodeus’ place as King of the Hells.”
“Yes, he is,” said Bill as his mind flashed back to some of the times that he’d been with Harry, which caused his cheeks to flush.
Vernon scowled at Petunia for a moment before he said, "I thought you weren't allowed to do magic outside of school."
“Yes, Godric, I am,” Nick responded.  “I am Nickolas Phillipe Delaney, the Heir of Slytherin.  Before finding out about your lies, I might have been ashamed of my connection to him, but after finding out about all of your lies, I’m not.  In fact, I’m proud to be related to Salazar, because through Helga and Rowena, I’ve gotten a glimpse at the real Salazar and not the fake version that you’ve had the Sorting Hat talking about for over a thousand years.”
A loud pop a moment later signaled Dobby’s arrival and as he looked around, he looked rather confused.  Looking over at Ryan and Harry he asked, “Harry Potter sir, were is we?”
Turning he saw that McGonagall was holding out a scrap of parchment.  Coming back and taking the parchment from her hand, Colin looked at it for a second and realized it was a quick note from McGonagall to excuse him from being late to his next class.  Colin again nodded to McGonagall and headed for Defense against the Dark Arts.
Bill pretended to think about the question for a moment, before he said, “No, Miss Vane, I’m not going to do anything.  I think Mr. Potter is perfectly justified in what he did to Mr. Creevey.”
As they read the announcement, many Slytherin students got angry, because they totally supported the former members’ action against Draco and couldn’t believe that Adrian didn’t.  How could any proper thinking wizard not support it?  Draco was a traitor.  He was dating the enemy.
“Not to sound impatient or anything,” Hermione said.  “But could we please see the book so that we can finally find out who the Heirs of Slytherin and Gryffindor are?”
Draco awoke covered in a cold sweat, and let out a quiet scream as his father's words echoed in his mind. He began to pant, trying to calm himself when he realized where he was.  Soon, tears began to roll down his cheeks over the memory of what his father had forced him to do on that summer morning, ten years ago.  Draco pulled his legs up to his chest and buried his head as he continued to sob, eventually crying himself back to sleep.
“Yes, that would be a common goal among the devils of the Hells,” Asheera said.  “Devils are a power-hungry bunch and there isn’t a devil in existence that hasn’t at some point in their life thought about trying to overthrow the King of the Hells and take over.”
Harry stood up and looked at Draco for several minutes and then nodded as they walked back to the castle in silence.  When they reached the front doors, Harry said, “Draco, wait.”
Professor McGonagall nodded to Dumbledore and then unrolled the long scroll and called out, "Addison, Jonathan," as a young black haired boy came up and put on the hat. After a few moments the hat shouted, "RAVENCLAW!" as cheers erupted from the Ravenclaw table and the boy went over to join his housemates. Professor McGonagall continued calling out names and the group of new students near the front of the room began to get smaller, as Ravenclaw got six more students, Hufflepuff got five, Slytherin got five, and Gryffindor got seven. As the new students were narrowed down to only four, Harry did a double take as he noticed that only four boys were left and looking at the back of their heads, Harry couldn't help but notice that it appeared as though Hogwarts was about to take it's first group of quadruplets.
Frances looked on for a moment, before coming over and gently rubbing her hand in circles over the young man's back, trying her best to comfort him. Finally she asked, "Is there anything I can do for you, Ryan?"
"Um, Hermione, I hate to break it to you," Ron said, "but we aren't at Hogwarts and the school year hasn't started yet."
"On the contrary," Charles replied, "I have every right.  I just witnessed you casting the killing curse on your own wife.  You're off to Azkaban, Lucius, and I doubt you'll be able to escape again now that the Ministry has dragons guarding it!"
"There's no need for that, Ryan," Frances said. "My mother was a healer for over fifty years, so she taught me everything she knew. I tried every spell I could think of, but she didn't respond. It's too late, Ryan, I'm so sorry."
“Yes, well, Bella,” Lucius drawled, “let’s not talk about that bitch anymore.  Let’s just enjoy this and hope that you will soon be carrying a male Malfoy child, so that I can disinherit that little whelp, Draco.”
“Ah, yes, the whole Gryffindor/Slytherin feud dynamic,” Nick commented with a grin.  “Well, Bill, if they really love you they’ll be able to see past the fact that I’m a Slytherin.  All that really matters is that you’re happy.  I do make you happy right?”
"Well, then it seems none of us really know," Percy said finally after Remus, Charlie, Ginny, and his parents had all acknowledged they had gotten the same notice from Dumbledore. "I'm sure Professor Dumbledore must have a reason for calling us all together."
“Exactly what it sounded like,” Harry said.  “I like you, Draco.  I’ve pretty much known I was probably gay since mid-way through third year, but I tried to ignore it, because I didn’t want to be gay.  I’m an orphan after all, so I’ve always wanted to have children, so being gay didn’t really fit into my plans.”
“Probably,” Narcissa answered.  “True, I was only in Tartarus a few months, so I doubt my wand has started rotting, but getting it would probably be dangerous.  I’m sure the manor is crawling with Death Eaters and getting into the Malfoy mausoleum could be problematic.”
“Yes, Your Majesty, I do,” Corelian said as he bowed again.  He then raised his left hand and conjured a horn made of a vibrant shade of pink coral.  Corelian put it to his lips and blew.  Within seconds, several pops could be heard as more people entered the room.
“Ron, Professor Dumbledore already checked,” Aarik said.  “He wanted to be certain that his eyes weren’t playing tricks on him and they weren’t.  Are you going to say that Draco is capable of performing magic that can fool Professor Dumbledore?  Remember, he can see through my invisibility cloak for Merlin’s sake.”
“As long as he has?” Fierna asked, as she gulped, very fearful of the answer that she was about to receive.
"Ron is right, Harry," Hermione said. "Veelas, even part Veelas, are extremely protective of their mates. If you've been sleeping with Bill then Fleur should have killed you by now. Unless..."
“So, why did you leave?”  Ryan asked.  “Why did you leave me with my grandparents?  They were great and all, but I’ve always wondered what was wrong with me that you didn’t want me.”
“If I remember correctly, the book will write each heir’s name in a color corresponding to the founder from whom they are descended.  I believe Godric’s heirs would be written in gold ink, Salazar’s in silver ink, Helga’s in black ink, and mine in blue ink.  As the restoration charm does its work, it’s possible that the names will become clearer, though you may only be able to read first names until the full restoration period has passed.”
“You were a fool to ever think somebody could love you,” a cold and cruel voice said in Tom’s head.  It sounded very much like Voldemort, but Tom knew that was not possible.  It’s just that the voice was what he’d come to associate with pain, so, now feeling like his heart had been ripped to shreds, it was only natural that he’d hear that voice.
“The purpose of the peach that I ate is to allow a person to go to Tartarus and challenge the Lord of the Dead for the souls of up to four people who were sent to their deaths before their scheduled times; specifically if they were killed by the Killing Curse.  If the challenger is successful, the Lord of the Dead will resurrect the claimed souls and all will be free to leave.  If the challenger fails, the claimed souls remain dead and the challenger forfeits their own life.”
“Oh the normal chaotic family holiday,” Michael said, as Ryan noticed Terry slip out of the room without a word.  “My dad’s brothers and their families are coming in from Spain for the holiday.”
Lucius is the only father I've ever known, so I would hope that there actually are fathers out there who are not as cruel as he is. I've never told Mother anything about how he treats me when she isn't around, because I fear for her safety. I know that she'd probably be furious with him and would confront him. I'm afraid that whatever civility he shows her when I'm around would be gone the second she dared to contradict him or fight him on something, even if I was in the room.
“I believe I can shed some light on that,” a familiar voice said from the doorway and Harry turned to see Remus Lupin standing there with a smile.
“Thank you, Baron,” Madame Pomfrey said.  It wasn’t quite as loud as a moment ago, but her voice was still amplified enough that it would be heard a fair distance away from the hospital wing and anyone who might be on their way to help with Peeves, would now know that the situation had been handled.
“Quite a bit, actually,” Alaric answered.  “You see, Dad, Tom Riddle was a boy pure of heart, who found out about your Chamber and what it contained.  He searched it out, opened it, and took a rooster with him, fully intending to kill the basilisk so that it couldn’t harm anyone.  He didn’t count on finding him there though.”
“The book doesn’t lie,” Rowena said and everyone turned to see Rowena and Helga looking down from the large framed landscape hanging above the fireplace.  “If the book says that he is only sixteen, then he is only sixteen.”
“What kind of a gift?”  Hermione asked, obviously curious what Aarik would consider the best gift he could have ever gotten.
"Another new offering this year, also an elective for sixth and seventh years only, is a Fencing class, which shall be taught by Professor Lasinius."
"Well, I was about to tell you something that not even Ron and Hermione know. They've been my best friends since first year and I haven't even told them yet," as Harry thought, 'Of course, I was about to tell Ryan and Nicolas about Bill. Ron and Hermione don't even know I'm gay yet, let alone anything about Bill. Speaking of things they don't know about yet, I also haven't told them about the prophecy either. I think I'll hold off on telling them about that for now.'
“How is that supposed to provide me with any solace?”  Ryan asked.  “I’m still going to remain young and alive for about 400 years longer than Justin.”
“I’m sorry, Aarik,” Draco said as he wrapped his arms around his boyfriend.  “I was busy doing some last minute Christmas shopping.”
“I’m not saying that guys shouldn’t wear pink,” Ryan said.  “I happen to have three pink shirts that I wear fairly regularly, but I just don’t think it’s appropriate for a formal event.”
"I just came from the Ministry," Dumbledore said. "I was in a meeting with Minister Scrimgeour when Kingsley brought Lucius in. It seems that Charles Cromwell witnessed Lucius casting the curse on Narcissa, with Draco watching. According to Charles and Kingsley, it would seem that Narcissa was trying to protect Draco from Lucius, who had been using the Cruciatus on him for reasons unknown."
"Personally, I don't find Draco to be all that bad," Ryan said. "Though I haven't known him very long."
The professors all did a double take as they looked up at the coach’s driver’s seat and saw that the driver had no head on its’ shoulders.
“You certainly know how to build up my curiosity,” Draco said.  “Exactly what kind of gift are you talking about?”
“Well, then, this weekend it is,” Dumbledore said.  “Though, now that I think about it, I would prefer to arrange it so that Voldemort doesn’t realize that Tom is gone for as long as possible.”
“It’s comforting to know that,” Bill said with a smile.  “Anyway, the awkward questions are the reason I haven’t told my family that I’m gay, but there’s another reason why I haven’t told them about Nick.”
Hermione, however, was much more open-minded about it.  She trusted Harry, so when he decided to become friends with Draco, Hermione decided to try it herself.  The fact that Professor Vector’s seating chart for Arithmancy class placed Hermione and Draco next to each other only helped her in realizing that Draco had definitely changed since his mother’s untimely death.  He still called her Granger, although she much preferred that to what he used to call her, and while they weren’t quite the best of friends yet, Hermione at least thought that they were on their way to it.  Draco had even asked Hermione for help on their Arithmancy homework, something which the old Draco would never have done.
“No, Cedric,” Draco said.  “You’ve been dead, so you wouldn’t know.  In a nutshell, Godric and Salazar were married and had a son.  Their son died, they both blamed each other for it and they both did things to get revenge on the other.  Godric’s means of revenge was to amend the memories of the Sorting Hat so that it would malign Salazar’s memory with all the lies that spurred the purity of blood nonsense so common these days.”
“Happy Christmas,” Ryan said with a smile, before following Kevin, Stephen, Michael, and Anthony out of the room.
“My grandmother was born in 1925,” Nick commented.  “Of course, her birthday is July 18th and she’s an only child.  I guess that means that I’m not Slytherin’s heir.”
“What do you mean the rest?”  Aarik asked.  “Does this having anything to do with why Nott got so angry when Adrian said he could think of a worse example of inbreeding in Slytherin then Crabbe and Goyle?”
“I suppose you could say that,” Hermione answered, “but I think it was bound to happen eventually anyway.  Until Ron grows up and learns to control his temper and not act like a sulking little kid every time he doesn’t get his way, I’m afraid I can’t be with him.”
Eric nodded and smiled at both Lane and Adrian.  Chelsea Atkins, Graham Pritchard, and Malcolm Baddock also nodded at Adrian.
“Thanks Ron, tell everyone, why don’t you!”  Bill exclaimed, as his skin started getting almost as red as Colin’s as some of the older Gryffindor girls – and boys – started smiling at him in a lascivious way that just screamed, “I saw the layout and I so want to shag you,” or “You posed for Playwitch?  Where can I get a copy?”
"Well, most of my family has been in Ravenclaw for generations," Ryan thought.  "So, I think I'd prefer to follow in that tradition if possible.  While I'm sure that Slytherin is nice, and I'll be the first to admit that I can be cunning when I want to be, I've always thought of my intelligence as my best trait."
"For the moment, there isn't much we can do," Dumbledore said.  "Until he chooses to reveal himself to the world, we can't go to the Ministry, because we all know how weak and inefficient they are.  No offense meant to those of you who work there."
“Ah, yes, I should have known.  You are not Atlantean, but you are wearing the symbols of Atlantis, I can see that plainly enough.  So, another thousand years have passed, has it?  No matter, whose soul do you seek in this challenge?  Perhaps you’ve come for the spirit of some dead maiden?  Or maybe you’re like the last challenger who came before me – a wizard who had come to claim the soul of his dead apprentice that he’d secretly taken as his lover.”
Removing his cloak, Harry draped it over one arm and then entered the bell tower, to find Malfoy curled up in a ball in a dark corner of the room, shaking and sobbing. He looked so pathetic at that moment, that Harry couldn’t even feel the slightest tinge of dislike for him, even after all the years that Malfoy had spent tormenting him and his friends.
“My marriage,” Angelique said.  “Come now, Nicolas, surely you remember that my surname did not change when I married your grandfather.  I was a Byrne before and after my marriage, since my husband was Maxwell Byrne, my first cousin.  You know that our family is not obsessed with pure blood and we certainly have never encouraged first cousins to marry in order to preserve it.  The family didn’t object in Maxwell’s and my case though because we weren’t related by blood.”
“I recently found out that Aarik is my real name,” Harry answered.  “It turns out Harry is just a nickname.  I figure I’ll use Harry for now, at least until the war is over, but I figured I’d let a select group of friends call me Aarik if they want to.”
Lucius Malfoy was in his study at the Château De Malfoy in a small French village.  While called a château, it was nowhere near the size of Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire; just a small, ten-bedroom country house, really, that the family used for vacations.  It was here that Lucius had been living since his escape from the Azkaban prison ship.  He could have gone to the Manor to live, but he decided that he wanted some time away to reflect and make plans for the future.  He still answered Voldemort’s summons and participated in all the battles, but he also had much more important things on his mind – like the future of the Malfoy family.
Zach thought Cedric must be kidding and started laughing.  After a moment, he said, “Good one, Rick.”
Cedric winced at his father’s use of that infernal nickname.  He had never told his father before he died, but he had always hated being called Ced.  This was now the first time in two years that he’d heard or even so much as thought about the nickname – he’d hated it so much when he was alive that it had actually counted as one of the bad memories that Valshar had taken away.
“We did think about that,” Harry said, “but seeing as how we didn’t have any clue which of the more then one-thousand students in this school might be the Heir we thought it a bit unpractical.  Plus, Rowena said that only Slytherin’s male heirs could speak Parseltongue and we don’t know if the other heirs are male or female.”
“I’ve sent word to Atlantis,” Corelian answered, “that I am in need of enough Atlantean Spruce wood to create two wands; one for myself and one for Asheera.”
"Well, there are always rumors," Matt said. "In a school as large as Hogwarts, you can barely go twenty minutes without hearing some rumor about who's dating who. Some people, namely in Slytherin, but also in other houses even run betting pools on who's dating who, who's going to date who, how long it will take certain people to get together, et cetera. During Oliver's and my seventh year, I'd say the most interesting pool I heard about would be the one involving..."
“It’s not a wild goose chase, Matt,” Ryan said. “I really am Ravenclaw’s heir, but since you don’t believe me, I’ll just have to show you the proof.”
“This had better be good, madam,” Rufus said.  “Not that I think for a second anything you can show me will convince me.  The experts that the
“Because if you weren’t a prefect,” Harry said, “I’m sure Hermione would be taking points away from you.”
"Come in, John," Dumbledore called out, after a moment, when the wards informed him that his guest had just reached the top of the stairs outside his office door.
A bright white light shot out of the tip of Harry’s wand and zoomed across the room to hit a scared looking Colin right in the face.  Moments later, he coughed and a soap bubble escaped his mouth.  The bubble floated for awhile before popping, and suddenly a loud voice said, “Colin is a virgin.”
“Anyway, that was probably the best day of my life, because after my team and I broke through the ancient curses, we came upon a room practically overflowing with golden artifacts.  It was one of the largest finds we’d ever found and the goblins were of course thrilled with my success.  Of course, I also ended up meeting the Pharaoh because of it, because according to the agreement between the Egyptian wizarding government and Gringott’s, all treasure is to be split equally.  The Pharaoh was, of course, extremely interested in meeting the curse-breaker leading the team that had discovered a treasure valued at a little over fifty million galleons.”
“Well, Ron, you have nobody to blame but yourself,” Hermione said.  “You created the distance with your own stubbornness.”
"Hello would work," a voice said and looking up, Ollivander came face to face with the smiling face of James Potter.  Lily, Cedric, and Narcissa were all standing behind him.
“That was very disturbing,” said Dumbledore, all signs of the normal twinkle gone from his eyes, replaced by a deep sadness, but also a look of cold fury that very few people had ever seen on the normally jovial old man’s face.
“Yes, Aarik,” Draco replied.  “I love you and when I found out I could bring back your parents, I knew I had to do it.”
“Yes, boy, you have been my prisoner for 54 years,” Voldemort confirmed.  “Ever since you were a student at Hogwarts and you tried to thwart my plans to rule the world.  I was certainly not going to allow a pathetic sixteen-year-old whelp to thwart me, so I imprisoned you and assumed your identity.  It really was quite a coincidence that your name just so happened to spell my name, if you rearranged the letters.”
“Hmm, yes, I see your dilemma,” Asheera said.  “Picking just the right gift can be hard, especially when you want something extra special for a loved one.”
"Oh, Ryan," the man said as he lowered his wand. "You're Matt's cousin from the States, right? My condolences on your grandmother."
“Yes, that’s fine,” said Corelian.  “You can get married on any day you wish and anywhere you wish.  All you need is the jewelry and a qualified Atlantean officiate.”
"I've been talking with one of our guests from Atlantis, Lady Asheera," Angelique said.  "She believes that the Dark Mark can also affect the behavior of the Death Eaters.  That they actually absorb evil through their link to Voldemort and thus all of them might not be as bad as we think they are.  She thinks that Occlumency helps to lessen the absorption of evil, hence the reason that Severus here isn't as evil as some of the other Death Eaters."
“Fair enough, Professor Weasley,” Salazar said.  “When the time comes, I’ll make sure you have the recipe.”
“That’s what you think, boy,” Voldemort said, as he again conjured a whip and began to lash the sixteen-year-old boy in front of him.  The difference this time being that Voldemort conjured the whip so that it would be alight with magical fire, so in addition to slicing Tom’s skin open, it was also searing it.
“Yes, I want to,” Oliver said.  “I’m an only child myself, so I’ve always wanted a few kids.  I always thought that seven was a good number, because then the kids could have their own Quidditch team.”
“I’m afraid I have to shoulder the blame for that,” Salazar answered.  “I summoned him to Earth in 862, so that he could divine when my heir would find my Chamber of Secrets, and to assist me to breed the basilisk and keep it alive until that time.  I didn’t realize it at the time, but Voldemort cast some extra spells which would summon him back when my heir, Tom Riddle, found my Chamber.”
When they finally parted, they both took a few moments to catch their breath, before Bill asked, “Happy now, Harry?”
“You’ve got me extremely curious, Professor,” Zach said.  “I mean, finding out that I was Helga’s heir was a pretty big shock.  Now you’re saying that I’ve got an even bigger one in store for me?”
Meanwhile, in a corridor on the sixth floor, Draco Malfoy was on patrol as a part of his prefect duties.  Normally, he would be with another prefect, but tonight Ron Weasley was his assigned partner.  Obviously, the two boys were not about to work together, and they both split up as soon as possible.
“Yes you are!”  Vaisey exclaimed.  “Bloody Hell, Pucey, are you really that stupid?  I’m not the traitor here, you are, and so is everyone else who fights against the Dark Lord.  He is the only chance of survival the Wizarding world has.  All the people who support diluting the purity of Wizarding blood need to be stopped and the Dark Lord is the best chance of success.”
"Well, it can't be Fred or George," Ron said. "They've been dating the Patil twins since the beginning of summer. Percy, well, I don't know if he's still with Penelope or not, but I can't imagine Percy would really be your type, mate."
Harry was sitting alone in the master suite of Grimmauld Place.  Once Sirius' will had been read, Molly and Arthur had insisted that Harry move into the room, since he was now the owner of the house.  Truth be told, while Harry did enjoy sharing a room with Ron, he was also happy to have his own at last.  Harry was sitting on the bed, lost in his thoughts, when there was a knock on the door.
“What’s Egypt like?  I always thought it might be an interesting place to visit, but my grandmother has never been into traveling that much.  She travels when she has to, but she prefers to stay at home, so there are a number of places I’d like to see that I’ve never had the opportunity to.”
“This is going to sound crazy,” Tom said with a grin, “but considering where you’ve spent the last two years, I think you are probably well equipped to believe just about anything.”
“I’m sure it isn’t, Minister,” Calliara said with a smile and a wink to her brother.  “However, I’m certain that after this tour, you will believe my brother.  Come now, let Erevan and I show you our kingdom.”
“I agree, Professor,” Cedric said.  “Of course, I don’t have a wand, as I imagine mum and dad adhered to the Wizarding tradition of burying it with me.  I imagine it’s probably got a bad case of wood rot by now.”
“Don’t tell me that you’ve actually fallen for his act!  I know he’s been acting all nice and such for the last week or so, but it’s all an act, Harry.  Surely, you can see that.  Malfoy is evil to the core and he’d surely kill you if given the chance just to please his master.”
"Filling the positions recently vacated by our dear Hagrid, who moved to France following his wedding to the Headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy, I present Professor Byrne, our new Care of Magical Creatures teacher, as well as game and groundskeeper."
“I’m sticking with Harry for the moment,” Harry answered.  “Maybe after the war is over, I’ll revert back to Aarik but, for the moment, it’s Harry.”
“Well, there’s this,” Nick said as pulled a silver chain with an oval locket from under his shirt. “The locket has their pictures in. Plus, my name, Nicolas Phillipe Delaney, comes from their middle names, Stephan Nicolas Delaney and Jean-Luc Phillipe Byrne-Delaney.”
Madame Malkin nodded and took the list from Ryan and said, "Yes, I do. His measurements will have changed within the last few months since his last visit, but a simple Auto-Resizing Charm will handle that. Stand up straight please."
“If memory serves,” Rowena said, “the entrance to Helga’s quarters are in the same hallway as the entrance to the kitchens.  Go down the hall until it dead ends and then simply trace the letters ‘H’, ‘M’, ‘H’, on one of the bricks.  I think it’s the twelfth brick from the floor, four bricks over from the corner.”
Thinking back on the events of the evening, Zach realized that Tom must have walked into Helga’s quarters when he was straddling Cedric’s lap, hugging him.  Zach had not been sure what might have made Tom cry, but he did suspect that might have been the reason, he just did not want to bring it up unless Tom confirmed it.  He was suddenly very happy that he had run into Cedric on the way to the bell tower, as the older boy was now waiting outside the room.
Smiling, Ollivander clapped his hands together and said, "I'd say that's a perfect match young man.  It's very interesting that that particular wand would choose you.  I've had it forever, never finding the right person to give it to.  In fact, my father, and his father, and his father before him had the same problem.  I'm sure if it had been common knowledge, my store would have been robbed by now, but that particular wand once belonged to Connor Scott - the great-great-grandson of Helga Hufflepuff."
The wedding would be held in the Grand Ballroom at Cromwell Hall in Yorkshire.  The thought of simply using the new Room of Requirement in the Great Hall to create a facsimile as was done on the night of the Halloween Ball had been suggested, but, in the end, Matthew and Oliver agreed that they wanted their ceremony to take place in the real Cromwell Hall.  Matthew was still very upset about his father’s untimely passing and if he couldn’t have his father at his wedding, he at least wanted it to take place in his father’s home.
The first years came forward and Professor McGonagall led them outside to the awaiting carriages.  The first of the now full carriages soon began to move down the drive towards Hogsmeade as Professor Dumbledore led the second years out of the castle and into more carriages.  This continued until finally Professor McGonagall saw the seventh years into the last of the carriages.
Immediately following Fencing class, Harry hurried up to the hallway outside Gryffindor tower.  He’d sent Hedwig with a message to Ginny to meet him by the Fat Lady after classes had ended for the day.
"Well, then it makes perfect sense that Cedric should get that wand," a female voice said, "seeing as he is one of my heirs."
Later that evening, well past midnight, Valen Lasinius stood in his quarters.  Normally, he would not be awake at this hour, but he had the feeling that his contact would soon be getting in touch with him through the mirror and he knew it would be a good idea to be awake when they did.  Sure enough, the mirror soon glowed brightly for a second, before a face appeared in the mirror, although, it wasn’t the face that Valen expected.
“I will, Master, I will,” Valen said.  “Well, I should be going.  I have a class to teach in about twenty minutes.  You would be proud of him though, he does very, very well in my class.”
Dumbledore looked at Draco for a moment, before he nodded.  Draco then turned and reached his hand into the darkness of the coach, as a hand took his.  Many gasps were heard from the gathered professors, as Draco assisted his dead mother, who was looking very much alive and well, down from the coach.  Draco then reached his hand into the darkness again and another female hand grabbed his own.  If Narcissa's appearance had caused a stir, then the appearance of this second person caused nearly pandemonium.
Something that was common knowledge by now was that Professor Lasinius was Atlantean, as he did not go back to using the glamour charms that he had been using previously to hide his appearance.  He did, however, albeit reluctantly continue to use his wand, even though he much preferred using Wandless Magic, which Atlanteans were masters of.
Draco fell asleep after Blaise left, and it wasn't long after that, unfortunately, that his subconscious began working, and forcing him to relive an event from his past...
"That is where you are wrong, Draco," Lucius said as he pulled out his wand and pointed it at his son.  "Imperio!  Now, kill it!"
"Draco, the same goes for me," Narcissa said.  "If Aarik makes you happy then that is all I care about and I wish you both many, many long years of happiness together."
“I solemnly swear that I’m up to no good,” Harry mumbled as he tapped his wand against the parchment.
“I hope you won’t let the fact that Nick is friends with Gabrielle Delacour stop you from dating him, Bill. I really do think you’d be perfect together.”
If he told anyone that, they'd probably assume that he was talking about his arch-nemesis, Harry Potter. The truth of the matter was, however, that the last person that Draco would want at his birthday party was his father's master, Lord Voldemort. He never told his father, because he knew that his father would kill him for such a betrayal, but Draco made up his mind a long, long time ago that he was not going to follow Voldemort. Over the years, his father had done everything he could to convince Draco that it was his duty to follow Voldemort; that he would be betraying the honor of the Malfoy family if he didn't follow Voldemort. Lucius had even gone so far as using the Imperius and Cruciatus curses on Draco several times in order to convince him that Voldemort was the best thing to happen to the wizarding world and was it's only hope for survival.
“No, he isn’t,” Remus said.  “As I’m sure you both know, I’m a werewolf and my sense of smell is much greater then a normal human’s.  When Cedric opened the door – and I am fairly certain it is Cedric, as I was his fifth-year Defense Against the Dark Arts professor and I vaguely remember his scent – I caught a whiff of two other very familiar scents that I could not possibly mistake or forget.  James?  Lily?  Is that really you?”
“Yes, of course, Severus,” Dumbledore said.  “Poppy do you have the potions I asked you to bring from the hospital wing?”
McGonagall stood there for a second, before finally saying, “All right, well, Mr. Delaney, while I may not agree with students dating their professors, you are 17 years old and the rules say you can have any relationship with your professors you want.  Now, since Professor Weasley isn’t talking, perhaps you would be so kind as to explain what is going on here and if anybody else talks, I will not hesitate to take points.”
“Didn’t like the cold and unfeeling I’m a Malfoy and I’m better than everyone else attitude?”  Draco drawled with a grin.
Harry was about to tell his relatives to have fun, even though he was secretly wishing that they'd all become shark food when their plane crashed into the sea, when his pet snowy owl, Hedwig, came flying in through the open dining room window and landed on his shoulder. As Harry took the letter from Hedwig's leg, his uncle, acting as if he had not even seen the owl fly into the room, said, "Of course, now the only question is what to do with you? I don't want you and your unnaturalness alone in my house."
“Do I really need an invitation?” Harry asked in a low, seductive voice, as he stood from Bill’s bed, walked over, and began to caress the older red-head’s cheek.
“You know, it’s a good thing I’m not the jealous type,” Nick said as he playfully punched Harry in the shoulder.  “Otherwise, I’d be extremely jealous of you Harry, considering that you’ve not only kissed my boyfriend on multiple occasions, but also had sex with him.”
The boy finally managed to get to the table and pull himself up into one of the chairs with great difficulty.  It was the most he had moved in quite awhile and all of his muscles were extremely weak.  The house-elf looked rather sad as it set the tray on the table in front of the boy, but it dared not say anything in front of Voldemort.
“Don’t worry about it, Draco,” Asheera said.  “It’s not like its some irreplaceable item.  In fact, I know of at least a dozen identical mirrors belonging to other Atlantean families.  I don’t know how closely you looked at it, but if you’d looked at the mirror, you would have seen the Lasinius family crest engraved on the top end of the frame.  So, don’t worry about it, Draco.  I know an extremely talented master artificer in Atlantis who will have no problem fixing it.  I’m just glad that you managed to succeed.”
Yes, my Lord, you read that last name correctly. Cedric Diggory is alive and back at Hogwarts. From what I overheard, it seems that Asheera Laitannen helped Draco Malfoy to journey to Tartarus and challenge Death for four souls. Cedric Diggory was one of them. The others were Narcissa Malfoy, James Potter, and Lily Potter.
Draco nodded as he entered the palace and took in the sight around him.  Despite the cold and desolate look of the land outside, the palace was a truly beautiful place.  Draco stepped forward towards the large doors to the throne room and they swung open as he neared them.  Looking into the large room, Draco could see Valshar, Lord of the Dead, sitting in his throne at the far end of the room, the numerous shackles and chains that bound him glinting in the torchlight.
Matt and Oliver whirled around at the sound of the voice and their jaws dropped open at the sight of Rowena’s portrait.
Just as it was in their school days, Charles was quicker and cast a charm to deflect Lucius' summoning charm, before casting a charm of his own.
Donning a jogging suit and a pair of running shoes that he’d bought on his trip to Muggle London before school started, Nick left the castle and ran down to the lake.  From his spying earlier in the week, he’d found out that Bill usually spent about fifteen minutes stretching near the lake before starting his run.  Not seeing any sign of his professor yet, he started doing some warm-up exercises to pass the time.  Of course, he didn’t have to wait all that long, because within about ten minutes, he caught sight of Bill heading in his direction.
“Wait a minute,” Draco said, as a look of comprehension spread across his face, “I get the feeling that Harry is playing with us.”
Seeing Rowena’s look of confusion, Harry explained, “Nearly Headless Nick is the Gryffindor house ghost.  As for why a basilisk was loose in the school, Lucius Malfoy had slipped my friend Ron’s sister, Ginny Weasley, a diary that Voldemort kept when he was sixteen and the memory of him tricked her into opening the Chamber of Secrets, at which point he released the basilisk and three students and the caretaker’s cat were all petrified.”
“Ah, don’t worry about it,” Draco said.  “Give me the ten Galleons that your parents sent and I’ll cover the rest.  That way you’ll still have some spending money if you see anything in the other shops you want.”
“What?”  Lily asked.  “You didn’t get your first Christmas gift until after you started at Hogwarts?”
“Wow,” Ryan muttered.  “A collection of rare books this size would be worth a fortune.  I remember Matt saying that if we combined our vaults with Oliver’s, Draco would still have more money, but all these books would be worth even more than Matt’s, Oliver’s, Draco’s and my vaults combined.”
Pulling out his wand, Harry performed a simple diagnostic spell that Madame Pomfrey had taught them in the Basics of Battlefield Medicine group.
The Bloody Baron remained silent as always.  He drew his sword and pointed it at Peeves’ throat, causing the poltergeist to scream like a little girl before he flew out of the room.
“Ah, I take it you didn’t hear that part of the conversation,” Corelian responded.  “Your grandparents changed your name when I left you in their care sixteen years ago.  Your name at birth, however, was Kyrian Corelian Laitannen.”
On a more pleasant note, Ron's, Hermione's, and my OWL results arrived about a week ago, shortly after I arrived. We all sat down in the sitting room and opened them together. Hermione, of course, got O's in everything, although considering how much she studies, that really doesn't surprise me.
Professor Lasinius paused a moment, before continuing, “Now, I’m going to call each of your names.  When I do, come over here and I’ll determine which of the swords in the rack is best suited to you.  Once everyone has a sword, I’ll give further instructions.”
‘Make the Lord of the Dead cry?’  Draco thought.  ‘Oh Gods, what have I gotten myself into?  How am I supposed to make Death cry?’
Directly ahead was a massive stone fireplace, flanked on either side by several French doors, covered in blood red draperies.  Instead of stone, the floor was now white marble, with a highly intricate inlay of the Hogwarts coat of arms in the center of the floor.  Numerous groupings of candles floated in mid-air throughout the room.  On the far end of the room, a marble staircase lead up to a landing on which rested a large pipe organ, with two more stairways wrapping around it on either side.
“Wait, does that mean you’re willing to accept that Atlantis actually exists?”  Queen Calliara said, who was not about to let the subject drop without a verbal confirmation from Scrimgeour.  “You’ll accept that Corelian is the Atlantean Ambassador to Britain and Ireland and drop these ideas of yours to send him to Azkaban?”
Meanwhile, in the staff wing of Hogwarts, Professor Angelique Byrne was sitting behind her desk grading the parchments on unicorns that she had her fifth-year Magical Creatures students write when there was a knock on her door.  Setting down her quill, she stood, walked over to the door, and answered it to find Professor Weasley standing there with her grandson.
A scent of dampness and disuse hit Ryan almost immediately as he stepped through the threshold.  The door soon closed and Harry and Ryan removed their cloaks, pulled out their wands, and mumbled, “Lumos!”  From the points of light on their wands, they saw that they were in a room that had obviously not been used in many years.  Sheets were draped over what looked to be various pieces of furniture and almost everywhere they looked, there was a thick layer of dust and a multitude of cobwebs.
“Before we get into that, Professor,” Rowena interjected, “I thought you would like to know that the Sorting Hat has been lying all these years.”
“Well, the other two heirs are in this room,” Corelian said.  “I’m really rather surprised that you haven’t thought of this, but it would be extremely easy to find out who the Heir of Slytherin is.  All you would have had to do is determine who, other then Mr. Potter, can speak Parseltongue.”
“Ah, Tom Riddle,” Slytherin said in English, “the one who was foreseen to me who would open my Chamber of Secrets and release the basilisk against Godric’s heirs.”
"Yes, well, Matthew if being with Oliver makes you happy, then so be it. Welcome to the family, Oliver. Barin!"
'The meeting can't possibly be over yet,' Harry thought as the sound of the compartment door opening interrupted his thoughts, 'We haven't even left the station yet.'
“Well, if he wasn’t a wizard he couldn’t have used the Cruciatus curse on me all those times and he couldn’t have used the Killing curse on my mother.”
After several moments of silence, Hermione found her voice and asked, “Harry is this some kind of joke?”
Nick looked back down at the page and thought for a moment, before a light went on in his head, looked up at Salazar’s portrait and asked, “Salazar is this written in Parseltongue?”
Lily swished and flicked the wand and caused a lovely bouquet of flowers - lilies appropriately enough - to appear from the tip.  Smiling, Ollivander said, "Looks like that one will work well for you, Lily."
Any annoyance that he had originally felt with the previous owner had now vanished completely as he leaned down and read the next line of instructions which said to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned as clear as water.  Looking at the margin of the book though, Harry wasn’t the least bit surprised to see that the previous owner had taken issue with this instruction as well.
As soon as he heard that, fireworks began to shoot off in Harry’s brain and he had the sudden urge to jump up and do a happy dance.  One of the reasons that Harry had tried fighting the fact that he was gay was because as an orphan, he’d always dreamed of having a large family.  He thought that being gay was some sort of cosmic punishment to make his life even worse then it already was by making it impossible for him to have the family he always wanted.  Eventually he had accepted being gay, but a part of him had always felt heartsick that he’d never have children.  To hear that he could enter into a legal marriage to a man and have children with him made Harry one extremely happy teenager.
Dumbledore shook his head.  "No, we must find a way of removing the Dark Mark.  Killing them might be easier, but, it'll also make Voldemort more powerful because the Dark Mark acts as a promise.  When the Death Eaters die, their souls belong to Voldemort and devils gain power from souls.  The more they take the more powerful they become.  He can draw some power from them while they're still alive, but not nearly as much as he would get if they die."
Malfoy just nodded as he stood up and Bill turned to address the class, “You are sixth-year students, some of you are even prefects, so I would hope that I can trust you to continue to work quietly in my absence. Please continue on your potions, I’ll be back shortly.”
Draco hesitated for a moment as he desperately tried to fight against the spell, and not obey his father.  It was an exercise in futility however, and tears were pouring from Draco's slate-grey eyes as he began to strangle the puppy.  The small legs were kicking wildly as it tried to defend itself, but it couldn't since Draco was larger and stronger then it was.  The small creature let out a strangled whimper and then stopped moving all together.  Draco set the puppy on the ground and then burst into sobs when he realized what he had done.
“You don’t have to worry about that, Harry,” Hermione said with a smile.  “After you asked Rowena and me about a spell to learn how to dance, we put our heads together and we did come up with something that should prove useful.”
“Mr. Filch,” Hermione said as he neared, “you can’t do anything to Justin and me for being out of bed.”
