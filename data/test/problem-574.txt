"Will somebody please explain what is going on here!"
"They were from her you know. The letters always said things like 'To keep a smile on your face', 'to get you through the day', 'to make you feel better'. She knew I was hurting. She knew and she tried to console me, the only way that made sense to her. Giving me sweets, Presents... anything but the one thing I needed. But I think she meant well. She really did. I think... she didn't know any other way herself.", he finished looking a bit forlorn. Harry squeezed his hand.
But Harry had meant what he said back at the Burrow. Out of this rubble, Draco would rise again, stronger and more beautiful then ever. An he would be there, all the way.
"Mr. Malfoy, please come up to give testimony,
Harry stared at him. So did Draco who, for a fact, looked as if Ron had asked him if Carrots grew out of his ears. And then, to Harry's great relief and happiness, he nodded.
He took a deep breath and straightened himself. There was a hard look in his eyes, a wall that shut the boy out who did not want to come back here.
Draco mumbled something that Harry couldn't understand due to sobbing and his face being screwed up in his lap.
"He... he... abused me...he..." Draco took one last deep breath and then said, so quiet that Harry nearly didn't hear it "...raped me." Pain, so much pain shone in this bright blue eyes, but there were no Tears. Harry asked himself if there were only so many tears a Person could shed before he became dry of them.
When Mr. Weasly came home that evening, he looked tired but grimly pleased.
"Thank you so very much Mr. Weasly. That means a lot to me." The older man waved but smiled back.
"Well, to be honest, I think I can get away with it just fine." he said, taking out his wand and pointing it at his Uncle. "Unless you want the same pigtail as your son, get out of the way." His Voice had become low and there was a hint of danger in it. Uncle Vernon huffed and puffed – but he didn't move.
"So... you are sure, are you? I mean, you now, that it is not some kind of trick, to get you over to the dark side, or hand you You-know-who on a silver platter?" , he then asked uncertainly. Harry's laugh sounded bitter.
During his speech, Draco looked to the floor. Harry could see his figure shaking slightly. He was so scared.
"Lucius Malfoy."
But we can't just turn up on the doorstep of your parents and ask them, can we? We need help in this, love. I want to help you, so badly, but I fear if I curse your father and just get it, there will be more Problems instead of less." he said the last sentence with a twisted smile, but to be honest, he was dead serious. If Lucius Malfoy ever got in front of him again, Harry wasn't sure he could guarantee for anything.
"High Court! This is absolutely inappropriate! You are laying suggestions into his..." "Mr. Malfoy, You will sit down and be quiet as long as I am questioning the accuser!"
Harry gulped, but took hold of Mr. Weasly's arms firmly, as did Draco and Ron.
During the talk, Draco's eyes had filled up with new tears. But they were different. It were tears that screamed for hope, for love, begged him to confirm that everything he said was true, that he really did love him. Harry leaned forward and kissed Draco, soft and warm. It was their first real Kiss since they had arrived at the Burrow, because there had always been someone around. But know, Draco flung his Arms around his neck and Harry put his own ones around the Slytherin's slim waist. There soft Kiss grew deeper ad Harry tried to put it all in this one Kiss, all his love and trust and faith in Draco. He could feel Draco's Heart flutter in his chest like a bird, and tasted the salty wetness of the tears that had been streaming down his beautiful face. So many tears. So many years of pain and suffering. Harry wanted to wash them all away, to save Draco from his own Darkness that seemed to linger in a corner of his world, always ready to jump at him, the moment he lowered his guard.
At the Name of Mr. Malfoy, Mrs. Weasly's cheeks flushed, but this time Harry could see, not in shame. In anger. In an Anger that made him wonder if someone should watch her the next days so she didn't sneak of to Azkaban to murder him in cold blood. Not that he would blame her.
he looked at Draco, who did not react immediately. When he stood up, he did so with Harry's hand still clutched in his fist. He looked quiet surprised, as if he hadn't realized it had been there the whole time. Harry glanced towards Madame Bones.
Still from that moment on, something was different. Harry suddenly noticed all the small little details about Draco that he never saw before. How his long, white fingers contrasted with the dark wood of his Wand. How his Hair gleamed when he had been showering after Quidditch Practice. How there was a kind of cold fire in his eyes when he got angry. How graciously he moved, and on and on. It didn't take him long to realize that he was completely lovestruck.
Lying on his stomach he dazed a bit at his wall. Tomorrow was supposed to be as hot as today. He would have the choice between sweating in a t-shirt or burning his back even worse. A deep sigh escaped his lips. With a last thought of Draco, without even taking of his glasses, he fell asleep.
"Potter, Malfoy! Mafalda just told me that both of you used magic and..."
"Let's get out of hear." He whispered. "I'm starving and I can't wait to see what Mrs. Weasly has done for Lunch."
Draco looked confused and worried. "Are you... mad at me for... you now... being together with Harry?" He asked scared. Harry really hadn't seen him ever this subdued. It saddened him.
His love opened his eyes slowly and though they were still very foggy he looked at Harry and smiled weakly. The dark-haired boy knelt down next to his bed and began stroking his head.
Harry told her everything. He stopped only when he came to what Draco had nearly done and tried to think of a good way of brushing over it, but Draco got there first.
It was unlike anything Harry had ever seen. The Atrium was grand and gold. People were popping out of fireplaces all around them looking ruffled and businesslike.
He was.
They sat down on the Sofa and Harry tugged his arm around Draco, who had curled up into a tight ball once more. Then they sat there. There was one question, burning on Harry's tongue, but he didn't know, how to ask, if he should ask at all. But he was lucky, in a way. Because Draco brought it up first.
His mother looked at him for a long time, not saying anything. Then she stretched out a hand and cupped his face with it.
Sincerely
They reached another deserted side street and Mr. Weasly stopped, wrenching Harry out of his thoughts. They stood in Front of a Telephone box, old shabby and rather broken looking. Mr. Weasly turned around.
"Harry..." The Voice was feeble, teary but Harry would have recognized it everywhere.
"Are you really that bad?", Draco asked,still smiling and Harry sighed. "Yes, I am. Ron tried to teach me since our first Year in Hogwarts, but frankly I think that he is always playing against me when he wants to score a Victory." He frowned again, which made Draco's smile widen. Harry smiled back and kissed him softly.
Harry hold himself upright, not wanting to crush the fragile body beneath him and slowly slumped to the side. There they lay, both panting and catching their breath. Then Draco turned his Head and smiled.
"Ready?", Mr. Weasly asked, "Then ..."
Harry had no answer. Instead he squeezed Draco's hand again. He couldn't think of any words.
Draco kissed Harry on the cheek. "Don't worry. I'll be there the whole time. And if they try to do anything..." His voice was getting darker and Harry smiled weakly
Her hair was as white blond as Draco's and her skin was pale. Yet there was a striking difference to the woman Harry remembered to have seen on the Quidditch world Cup. That woman had looked strong and proud. This women looked a bit dazed and confused. She wasn't small but she looked... vanishing. She was so pale and slim that Harry had the feeling a gust of wind could blow her away.
The black-haired boy thought about their relationship. It had all started so very innocent...
"Lucius Malfoy, " , she turned to look at him " You are accused by your son of abuse and rape over a long term amount of time, on a regular basis and in your right mind. What do you have to say for yourself?" Harry could hear a ripple of gasps and murmurs go through the court. Lucius Malfoy stood up and went forward until he stood in front of the court.
"...ry. Harry!"
Harry of course didn't and Draco wasn't to be persuaded, even though Harry could see him wince at the smallest movements.
"Ah, Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter. Please come in and sit down." She indicated towards to wooden chairs on her left side. As they walked through the room, Harry saw him.
EVEN HIS OWN SON WASN'T SAVE!"
"Of course, my dear, we can't let you go like that. I will see to it in a second, just you wait." She turned to oversee the frying of the bacon and Harry could see that she mopped her eyes fast. When she had finished cooking she sat the plates on the table in front of Harry and Draco and strolled out of the room. She returned a minute later with a comb in her hand and began to comb Draco's hair very softly until it lay like silver satin. Draco hadn't spoken or moved. But Harry could see that he didn't disapprove at all.
On the next morning, they decided not to tell anyone yet, not even Ron and Hermione. Harry didn't want to have to deal with the looks on there faces when he was telling them that he was gay and above all, dating Malfoy.
"No." She said in a low voice. "I don't want you to pretend anything. I wanted... I just wanted...", she began to cry. Harry sighed heavily and made a step towards her. He slowly put his arms around her, half suspecting she might push him away. But she snuggled close to him and cried into his shirt while he stroked her hair. After a while she seemed to calm down and he broke away. "Ginny,", he said, "I will always be there for you. You are like a little Sister to me. I'm sorry I can't offer you what you might have imagined, but I can offer you my friendship. But only if you promise not to make Draco miserable again." He added seriously. She nodded. Harry felt relieved. He rustled her Hair again and turned to go back into the living room, when Ginny called him back.
"Could you tell him... that I'm sorry?" she blushed. Harry shook his head and she seemed taken aback.
"Lets go find mother." He said.
They sat there for quiet a while. Harry didn't know how long. The Patronus stayed, watching over the, making Harry feel calm too. He thought about the day after tomorrow. About Lucius Malfoy, About Draco, about everything.
"Do you think you can just walk away from this? Hiding one of... of your kind in our House, by the looks of it, I'd say a dangerous person anyway! Threatening us with those... Tricks of yours into believing that we couldn't lay a hand on you? Well, not this time, you rotten brat, not this time!" He breathed harder now, as if he had been running a marathon. Harry looked at him. One part of him told him that Uncle Vernon was still very tall next to him and that he weight at list thrice his amount and could probably crush him by weight alone. But he had a wand and Mr. Weasly was with him and Ron and Draco. He wasn't alone any more and he wouldn't budge this time!
"Let me go!" the blonde yelled, tears now gushing out of his eyes. "He deserves it! After all he's done! To say he is... To think he'd still be..."
"Oh yeah? Then how about the committee tries 'Priori incantatem"' at your wand and we'll see who exactly shot Imperius-Curses at the Guards, shall we?" he shot back.
"I wonder if she's going to be there." He said quietly. Harry looked startled for a second, then comprehension began to rise in him.
Oh dearies, I am so sorry. It took me forever to find out how I really wanted to end this Story, but I think I finally got it. Including this one, there will be three more chapter from here on, the last of wich will be ver similar to the first one!(You have been warned ;)
"It pretty much says what happened. They didn't even skim away from the... nastier details. " He laughed bitterly. Harry took his hands. Draco looked up at him. "I knew they were going to print it you know... but still, how can seeing it written down like that make it seem so much more... real?"
"Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter you may sit down." she said after a Moment.
Without thinking, he wrapped his arms around the older boy. He felt Draco shudder, then, as if his world depended on it, he grabbed Harry's arm, held it tight.
Draco's Voice broke, and Harry saw that tears dripped down his face.
The door appeared. Harry went through it and found himself in a beautiful room, atmosphericly lit by at least a dozen candles burning on low wooden tables. But he had no eyes for that. Only for the boy, lying on top of the bed with the silken sheets – already naked, but covered in rose petals. Harry's mouth grew very dry.
Harry took his hand and though Draco seemed surprised at firs, he squeezed it thankfully.
"Don't worry, love, it will be allright...."
When Harry had waited that night, he feared that Draco wouldn't come. Or worse, that he had put Filch on his heels.
"Draco, we have to tell someone. We have to get your stuff before term starts. You need your Wand.
It took Harry only a second to cross the Distance between them, laying a deep, deep kiss on Draco's Lips. They were soft and warm and Harry's heart seemed to burst with the feeling of skin on skin, with the way Draco was holding tight to him, with the rhythm of Draco' heart beating steadily against his own. It was perfect, he thought. One of those moments you want to fill in a bottle and preserve so that you can take it out on the rainy day's of life.
"Meet me tonight in the third floor." He said, fixating Draco, who's eyes widened. He stood still for a second, then he wrestled his arm free and ran away.
How far they had come. Tomorrow they would go down to Breakfast together. Not seperate, holding hands and everything. No more hiding. They would take a seat next to Ron and Hermione, who had taken the whole thing quite well, Draco now often sittig on the Griffindor Table.
"Mr. Potter, please explain to me what happened."
"I never would, Harry, dear. Tell him that when he wakes up" She took out her wand and said "Expecto Patronum" A Fox erupted from her Wand tip and curled up next to Harry's Stag. He looked at her, then smiled. She smiled back, turned and descended the stairs.
Harry wandered deeper with his lips, kissing Draco's Chest and his fragile thighs, slowly nearing the spot where Draco wanted him the most. When Harry's lips touched Draco's member the Slytherin yelled in pleasure and his hips rocked forward without control.
"I'm sorry Harry, I really didn't mean to cause any Mayhem at your Aunt and Uncle's, I just..." But Mr. Weasly's explanation was cut short because Harry sank to the ground now anyway, positively roaring with laughter, as was Ron. Draco, clearly not used to such out breaks of amusement, smiled.
Then she turned towards Draco and Harry.
This still left the question of where Draco were to live. His Mother had two Sisters, Bellatrix Lestrange, currently in Azkaban for being a supporter of Voldemort, and a Woman named Andromeda Tonks, who had fallen out with the Family because she had married a Muggle and to whom Draco had never spoken. Mrs. Tonks had been informed about the Situation and arrived four days after the trial. She seemed like a nice enough woman, kind hearted and good natured. She had a daughter of her own, Nymphadora, but she was already Grown up and didn't live with them any more. She and Draco talked long and hard about their possibility's and in the end it was decided that for the rest of this summer he would stay with the Weasly's and next he would start living with her and her Husband, Ted Tonks. She said he could think about whether or not he wanted to visit over the Schoolyear-holidays already, but that she wouldn't push him.
The next 5 days after Hedwig had gone, Draco's condition worsened. Two days after, Harry noticed that his temperature was rising. He now insisted that Draco let him take a look at his back and the other gave in at last. Harry saw his darkest fears confirmed. Some of the wounds had become infected and it was likely that Draco were on the brink of becoming very, very ill. When Uncle Vernon let him out for toilet again, he managed to sneak a wet cloth and one bandage into the room. He tried to clean the wounds as good as possible, ignoring the painful grunts and hisses from Draco as he did so, even though they made Harry's heart bleed. It didn't do much good though and Harry just tried wrapping the bandage around the worst of it so that it wouldn't get infected any further. Then he could only wait. He grew more impatient with every day, seeing as Draco got weaker and sicker, his fever rising from day to day. On the fourth he began hallucinating, which Harry feared was not only due to the wounds and fever, but also to lack of real sleep and good food. He needed Mr. Weasly's reply fast.
"I don't think I can eat..." He muttered, but Harry shook his Head.
"Well,"" he returned to the original topic, "I am very sure there is something like child-protection or something. You would have to face a trial, together with your father, probably. And I don't know about the wizard law. Maybe you can't see your Parents again. Your father could even go to Azkaban for this. Not that he wouldn't deserve it." He added under his breath. But Draco didn't seem to have heard him. His eyes had become blank as they mostly did now, when Harry mentioned his father. He looked uncertain.
"Madame, these boys are out of control! They have attacked me, without good reason!"
"That does sound like an excellent Idea, indeed." Madame Bones said. She flicked her wand. "Accio Lucius Malfoy's wand!" The wand soared through the air and she caught it neatly. Then she directed her own wand at the tip.
"Draco Malfoy, huh?" Ron's voice suddenly sounded behind him and Harry turned around. His best friend looked at him with a mixture of anger, curiosity and worry. Harry understood the anger. He had known that he had to tell Ron and Hermione sooner or later, but Draco had practically begged him not to do so right now. So he only shrugged. There wasn't much he could say.
"Arthur, dear, did everything...", she started, but her husband stopped her.
Harry feared that Draco would have a Heart attack, that was how heavy he could feel it pumping.
"Why not?" The Question was very silent and it felt heavy between them. Draco didn't say anything at first. Then, after a while, he started to sob. "I'm sorry, Harry... I'm sorry..." He began rocking backward and forward, crying-cramps shaking his body. The other couldn't do anything but look at him.
He looked at the Patronus. "Harry, you're not supposed to do magic outside school." , she said, but it didn't sound as if she meant it.
They went up to Harry's bedroom, Where he started to put everything into his trunk. The Dursley's really hadn't touched anything, which he was very glad for and immensely thankful to Mr. Weasly.
Clearing his throat he said: "Mrs. Weasly... Did the Prophet already print the trial?"
He arrived at the (third) Corridor and stood in Front of a Brick Wall. He went past it once... twice...thrice. While doing this, he wished hard, as hard as he could. He wanted to get in. He wanted to be with the Person inside that room.
"How did it go? Are you all right Draco? You look pale, do you want something to eat, a hot chocolate maybe? No, that's a drink... A chocolate bar!"
He didn't raise his voice. But he knew Draco had heard him. He was still standing over his father, who's Wand had been knocked out of his hands and lay out of reach. Lucius' face was shocked, now he was the marble-white one. He looked up in Draco's face as if he had never seen him.
Trying to keep his wits together, he reached for the lubricant on the bedstead. Slowly he began inserting one coated finger, enjoying the unevenness of Dracos pumps as he began gasping for more. Harry gave him more. Two fingers, three. Draco yelled his name.
To be honest, I tried to tell, just, that Father was... being aggressive. In mid conversation, she began to hum and then patted me on the head like I was a little child. The next day, she bought me a new broom. 'There', she said, 'now you don't have to be sad any more, right?' It's not though as if she didn't get that something was wrong, she just couldn't deal with it."
"Hey, what's the matter? Was I... Did I do something wrong last night?"
They had been in Potion, when there was a loud smashing sound. Goyle had obviously dropped a glass viol. Harry could see Draco's face contort in pain for a second. A large Drop of blood, ruby-red and strangely contrasted to Draco's white skin had appeared on his cheek. Harry had no Idea how on earth Goyle had smashed the viol but somehow one of the splinters had managed to cut Draco's cheek. The blond frowned and raised his hand to his face to feel the damage. When he saw the blood in his Hands, he grew white. It was only for a split second but Harry was sure he swayed a little. Then he blinked and hit Goyle over the Head.
Draco seemed completely overwhelmed by the situation. He just sat there stiff as a board, his eyes darting pleadingly to Harry, who himself seemed to be frozen in Place by the abrupt turnaround.
"That's all I can get you right now, sorry... eat up and don't worry, you'll be safe in here. Just don't leave the room, 'kay?" he said hastily, kissing the other softly on the cheek. The Slytherin looked puzzled, but Harry couldn't stay, he dashed out of the room again, right on time to hear Uncle Vernon's angry shouting. He made sure the big man saw him running out of the front door and where chasing him. They mustn't go near his room. He ran over the lawn and and heard Uncle Vernon puff behind him like and old steam engine. In front of the Hedge he stopped and turned around, letting Uncle Vernon catch hold of his arm.
They replied, then Mr. Weasly went back to them.
Draco stared at the floor for a moment. Then, with great effort, he drew his head up until he looked Amelia Bones right I the face. When he spoke, Harry knew, he was telling her and no one else.
They had landed on a spot about five minutes on foot to Private Drive, in a group of trees so that they weren't spotted by Muggles, appearing out of thin air.
One quick lick along the length of his member made Draco buck his hips towards Harry and cry out. His hands reached for Harry and he fisted one hand in that untidy black hair, all the while moaning and gasping at the continued pleasure.
"But I know. You are mommy's little boy. And you will always be. You are a good boy, Draco..."
He sighed, as he scrubbed the Windows in the hot summer air, sweating, even without his shirt on. A glance back told him that he had to mow the lawn next. His back already hurt and he felt a nasty sunburn come along, since he didn't have any sunlotion to protect himself.
He tipped his head to Aunt Petunia who had her hand clapped over her mouth and was looking furious now, but still not moving.
"Don't thank me to soon, dear. I have to change the bandages now and I cannot guarantee for the effect of the Painkillers in that situation." She said, her Voice sounding sad. Harry saw fear in Draco' s eyes and hurried forward. Draco took his hand and pressed it firmly.
"Mother, Father is not coming back."
"Get out. I don't want to talk to you, whoever it is." She grumbled.
"I will see what I can find in the law, that could help you here, I promise.", Mr. Weasly added. Draco blinked, then smiled again.
"Yeah and it's not as if they couldn't use a little scare every once in a while." He added. Mr. Weasly sighed, but didn't argue. Harry looked at Ron and felt thankful. He guessed that Draco had held back a lot right now, because he didn't wasn't People to think that he was still against Muggles and on that whole Pureblood-thing.
"Draco... my boy... I... you wouldn't hurt me? I'm your father!"
"Since when have you to been friends, really? And why, for Merlin's sake didn't you tell us? I fell bad now for making mean comments about him in front of you!", the red-haired boy said, beckoning Harry out of the living room, so they wouldn't wake Draco up. Harry threw one last glance over his shoulder to the curtains around his bed, then he followed Ron, closing the door behind him.
Then there was the actual transfer of Narcissa. Draco and Harry went with the St. Mungos People to pick her up from the Mansion. At first she made a fuss, saying that she had to stay home in case her husband came home from work. It was only after Draco had sat down with her and again explained that Lucius wouldn't be coming home for a long time and that she was going someplace nice and friendly and that he would visit her as often as possible that she finally agreed. Draco had used the family fortune to make sure that Narcissa had everything she needed and would not want for anything. Harry still could have sworn that he heard his heart break when they took her away.
"Later, Molly. Draco is very badly hurt, you have to Prepare a bed fast and bring the aid kid to it. We have to take care of his wounds before the infection spreads." Mrs. Weasly went pale but nodded with a resolute face and hurried of to the house. Mr. Weasly got Draco out of the Car with the same spell he had used before to levitate him and went after her as fast as possible without hurting him more, Harry walking behind him. When they entered through the door Mrs. Weasly ushered them into the living room, where she had put a bed. Mr. Weasly let Draco down, careful not to let his back touch anything. Mrs. Weasly went even paler and started to tend to the wounds immediately. She cleansed them and applied some potions, which seemed to make the red of the gashes less angry. Draco winced and whined softly but he didn't regain consciousness. When Mrs. Weasly was done, she sighed.
"I don' wan'er to know..." mumbled Draco.
"I'm sorry.", he said quietly. Draco looked at him, and opened his mouth, clearly to say that it wasn't is fault, but Harry shook his head.
Hedwig had been out when he and Draco had been leaving Private Drive that Day and she had fluttered in at the Burrow the next morning, displaying again her strange power to always know where to find him.
In some ways, it was worse than Harry had expected. But only in some. When he rang the bell, there was first no sound from inside the house.
"Draco." Harry's Heart stopped. Lucius Malfoy had turned and looked at his son. Harry saw that there was practically no colour left in Draco's face as he stared down on the floor, unable to look at his father.
He started to caress Draco's chest, sliding his hands softly, carefully over his delicate skin. Then he dipped down and began to nibble on the others nipples, which rewarded him with a deep and hungry moan. He wanted to kiss every inch of his lover, and he did, laying kisses over his collarbone, his chest, his navel (which made Draco giggle) and then at last came to the region he had been waiting for. Here to he lay soft kisses Draco writhing and moaning under him. It felt so good, so good to give his lover pleasure.
"And if I were you I wouldn't try that." Harry directed at Mr. Malfoy who had try to get near his wand. Harry shot a spell at it and it flew to the other side of the room.
Draco sat still for a long while. Then he whispered "I just don't" and buried his head in his arms.
But Draco came. Harry showed him the Room of Requirement and for the first time they both let their masks fall. Harry found that the real Draco was much more fragile and vulnerable then he looked, shuddering at Harry's slightest touches.
She looked at him with guilt in his eyes, stood up, left and came back a second later with a newspaper in her trembling hands. Harry could read "The Daily Prophet, Evening Edition" on the Top. His hart sank even more. He looked at Draco. He didn't look scared or angry. Just weary and a bit tired. And Harry realized that he had expected something like this.
"Draco..." Harry was shocked. It had looked as if the touch of Harry had scared Draco out of his wits.
The black-haired boy woke up the next morning, to find Draco still cuddled tightly to his side. He himself must have slipped into sleep somehow, sometime. He craned his neck, trying to catch a glimpse of his clock without waking the other up. His Heart made a jump. It was 8 o'clock. He should have been down, making breakfast half an hour ago. If he didn't turn up immediately, Petunia, who was always the first one to stand up would notice he hadn't and she would come up here to wake him. He couldn't let that happen. Careful, trying not to move too much, he pulled his arm out under Draco's body. The other stirred, but slept on. Harry could only guess how long he walked to get here. He still hadn't had an exact Idea how he did it at all. But it seemed that he really needed the sleep.
"The hearing will be next week on Wednesday. That means we have 5 days. There isn't much you can do, really, except getting mentally ready and when the time come, telling what happened. I also got a warrant for your... for Lucius House. Members of the Ministry will go there and collect all your stuff." He told Harry and Draco. Then he looked at the black-haired boy.
"I want to tell Mr. Weasly." Draco whispered in the end. The fear was still lurking and Harry didn't think that it would ever go away completely. All he could do was keeping it at bay. He nodded and kissed Draco, again and again, until both their tears had dried and they fell asleep on the Sofa, closely cuddled onto each other.
Harry couldn't believe it. After all this Lucius Malfoy was still trying to worm his way out. But not this time.
"I'll contact Molly and tell her how it went and that you will drop in later."
"You better eat up," sighed Harry, "because it could be the last bigger meal for the next few days."
"I'll be eating in my room, then you don't have to put up with me." he just said. The others said nothing, going back to ignoring him how they usually did it when Harry was around. He knew nobody would stop him. The Dursley's were glad when they didn't have him sitting at the Table.
"Draco Malfoy, when I look at you, I see a beautiful young man. But that is only the outer façade." He smiled softly as Draco winced, holding his face steady so that the other looked at him properly.
The words had come from Draco. Mrs. Weasly and Harry both turned and looked at him. He sat with his face to the desk. "That is really nice of you Mrs. Weasly and... could you... I mean... I don't think... I don't think my hair wants to lay quiet flat." He ended weakly.
Most of the time, Harry sat next to his bed, wiping his feverish forehead with a wet cloth. Mrs. Weasly came in once to change the bandages and apply more of the potion. Draco stirred again but didn't wake. Harry's Heart sank even lower.
"I think Mrs. Weasly, we could all use another Mug of tea... and those cookies you were talking about sound lie a very good Idea too."
"May I take that as a confession, Mr. Malfoy?" Madame Bones said firmly.
"You do not hurt Harry. You do not touch him. You do NOT curse him. You will NOT DO ANYTHING ANYMORE!" Harry could hear the rage, edging on madness.
"As for you..." She turned towards Mr. Malfoy and her expression became very dangerous.
Lucius Malfoy's Wand slashed through the air again, but Draco deflected it.
"Draco, I think you have already guessed that the use of the 'Flesheater' is absolutely forbidden today. Whoever did this to you will have to answer to an inquiry." He suddenly looked old and worn out.
"Do you think you can just do this to me? After all I have worked for so hard, after all I have gained? I am a respected member of the Magic Society. I am a well now benefactor for Charity's. I am influential at important parts in this Ministry. Do you think I will let you ruin all that? For him?"
"Mr. Weasly!" he cried out " I am so glad you are here! Please, we have to help Draco fast, his condition is getting worse by the second..." He beckoned Mr. Weasly to the now unconscious Draco, who was very greyish looking. He lay half on his stomach and Harry, and the gashes were visible, because Harry hadn't been able to put Draco's shirt on again. It had hurt too much for him after Harry had to take of the bandages again because they were soaked with blood and pus. The older man looked taken aback in shock for a second, then, without further Questions, he waved his wand and Draco began floating softly down up, through the room and down the stairs. In the entrance hall, Harry saw that The Head of the Weasly family head used the 'Petrificus totalus' Spell on Uncle Vernon, and a grim smile flickered over his face.
"Write to the Weasly's, or to whomever you want. It doesn't matter as long as I don't have to go back." he turned around and lay himself on the bed, with his back to Harry.
Harry couldn't suppress a giggle.
The whip never left Scars. How often had this already happened? How often had Lucius Malfoy tortured and abused his son? Harry's stomach made a sickening jolt when he thought back to the last time they had been together at Hogwarts and wished he had pushed harder back then, gotten Draco to tell him what was going on. Could he have prevented this from happening? Send him to the Weasly's right away? But Somehow he knew, that Draco wouldn't have done it. His pride was to great, his masquerade to perfect. The fact that he didn't mind having help from the Weasly's was a sign how damaged he really was on the inside. Harry was scared, that he might never recover again and swore to himself to do everything in his power to help him.
"Imperio!" "NO!"
Harry crept through the dark corridors. His invisibility Cloak might protect him from being spotted right away, but if he ran into a teacher, (Snape, for instance) he'd still be facing the Detention of a lifetime at best, especially, when he would never be able to explain why he was outside bed.
"She kissed me..." He murmured. It still seemed to sink in. "And she stroked my hair..."
Harry didn't believe his ears. It couldn't be true. Draco was Lucius Malfoy's only Son. He loved him, right? He had to! Because that's what Parents did, they loved their Children. Harry's Mother even died for him. Her love for Harry had left such a permanent mark on him that it created a physical Barrier for Voldemort.
"You are not allowed, boy. They expel you from your stupid school and you will never be able to become one of... their lot. Yes, we should have prevented you from going Years ago. St. Brutus', that's right. Time to make it more than just the story for the neighbours, don't you think?"
"Sh's monderma moma" came it again from the tight ball that was Draco. Harry bent even nearer.
Panting, Harry rolled himself of Draco and cuddled into his side, the other ones chest heaving in n effort to catch his breath.
But Draco shook his head.
When he awoke, it was dark. He wasn't quiet sure at first, what had woken him. Maybe it had been the pain on his back. Or did he have had another Voldemort-Nightmare? But he didn't remember anything of that sort. His back felt sore still but not so painful that it would have woken him, and his scar didn't hurt as well, which it normally would do when he had dreamed of Voldemort. So what had woken him?
"Draco, that is wonderful news. I will contact Molly that I'll be sending you two home in about five minutes and then this evening, I think, We'll have feast. How does that sound?"
Harry smiled and looked up. Resting himself on his arms he leaned forward to kiss Draco's Lips again. The other gave in, beginning to let his hands wander over Harry's Chest and lower until he had Harry's member in hand, and now it was the Griffindors turn to moan. He didn't think he could wait much long with Draco stroking him like that.
And so, when Draco's lids began to flutter at about 11 in the evening he was so relieved that he nearly cried.
"Behind these door are two Dementors, waiting for you. You have been charged with the regular abuse of Draco Malfoy in body and mind, of rape and it seems that we can add attacking Ministry officials to the list. You are hereby sentenced to 10 Years in Askaban. Get him Out of my sight!"
"Oh, Arthur told me the news... I am so glad everything went all right! I've made you both tea... You must be exhausted! Come in, come in... brush of the soot, there's a good lad... "
"Well...", he started, not quiet sure how to start. It hadn't occurred to him that Ron thought Draco and he were just friends. How would he react when he found out the truth? But there was no use in hiding it any more, so he could let the cat out of the bag anyway.
And there he was, like a young Greek God, skin like marble, eyes like Ice. Hair, soft and glamorous as Silk and these Lips... Every word that Harry had ever thought up on his way here vanished. He just could say his Name: "Draco..."
"Well, maybe not every time, but often enough.", he joked light-heartedly. "And as I said Mr. Weasly will be there right? Believe me, my Aunt and Uncle won't move one muscle if they face the prospect of a fully-fledged Wizard turning them into rats or something like that.", he added, which smoothed the frown lines on Draco's forehead a bit. Harry kissed him and and went up to the bedroom with him.
Ron unpacked his chessboard and they began playing. Harry wasn't really astounded to see that Draco was quiet good. He had always known that the blonde was one to strategize and plan, unlike himself who rather plunged right into action. He still lost to Ron, but something told Harry that he probably wouldn't if he had been on his best, since it was a very narrow defeat. Ron was delighted. He urged Draco to play with him again and again, until Mrs. Weasly came in and told him off for overtaxing him. But Harry had the feeling that Draco had really enjoyed playing with Ron. In the end, it had been 6 games, two of them won by Draco, four by Ron. His lover was really good at this game. That evening, Mrs. Weasly build up the Dinner table in the living room to give Draco the opportunity to eat with them without straining himself to much. At first the Conversation was subdued, as no one really knew what to say. It were Fred and George that broke the Ice, by asking their father about work and Mr. Weasly began to tell them about an old Muggle-Woman who had bought a beautiful necklace which turned out to be enchanted so that it made the wearer have a constant hiccup, a newly wed Pair who had acquired a Service that constantly refilled itself until even the thickest Muggle had to notice that something was off and a Ring, shrinking on the Finger of the Person who took it on, that they had been able to take of at barely the last second before the owner lost his finger. He said it had been mayhem with all the charms to make the Muggle's think that none of this had ever happened. The only one who sat still and without a smile that whole time was Ginny. When Mrs. Weasly just said that he should have brought home that self-refilling service, she stood up very abruptly, saying she wasn't hungry any more and leaving. What followed was a very awkward silence, in which Draco looked very downcast. Harry suddenly felt a rush of anger towards Ginny. He gave Draco's hand a squeeze and then stood up too, excusing himself. He hated to leave Draco alone, but this couldn't go on.
"I'm sorry...I let him touch me... I betrayed you...I'm sorry..." His crying grew louder and Harry feared that the Dursleys would wake. He had no Idea how he was supposed to explain another boy, crying, in his room, and right now seemed a bad time anyway.
"She won't think any less of you, Draco. She really likes you." He sat down next to his lover and put one arm around his shoulder. Draco leaned in on him and for the first time since they got back from his Aunt and Uncles Harry had the feeling, that Draco could even see ahead of him.
It was over. No way could he control himself now. Removing the fingers in one swift motion he replaced them with something much bigger. Draco groaned as he positioned himself and then, with one single motion pushed in. Draco's cry of surprise pleasure was like an aphrodisiac as Harry fastened the rhythm, Draco clinging to him as if for dear life. Harry kissed him until they were both breathless and then with one last Push they came.
"No, it would have been very complicated to connect their grate to the floonet now, so we are going to do side-along apparition." He looked at them. "Ron has already done it, how about you two?" He asked towards Draco and Harry. Draco nodded, but Harry shook his head. "Okay, Harry, come here. Just hold on to my arm tightly and don't let go. I have to warn you, it is not a very pleasant feeling."
Lucius Malfoy sat on her right side. His face was stony, but Harry could see the rage in his eyes, his hatred. And when Malfoy senior looked up and their glances met, even acting-skilled Lucius Malfoy couldn't keep his face from contorting in hatred. Only for a second though. After that it went back to the stone mask. The shaking of Draco's hand in his told Harry that he had seen his father to. A great wave of hatred streamed through him now. He wanted to lunge at Mr. Malfoy, wanted to scratch his eyes out, wanted to use the Cruciatus curse on him, anything, anything, to let him feel even a little portion of the pain and suffering he had Draco go through. But he didn't. He squeezed Draco's Hand and led him to the chairs on the other side. They said down and the Witch on the high table cleared her throat.
For a while, non of them said anything. Then Draco raised his head and even though there were still tear trails on his face, his eyes were dry.
Draco's Voice was still feeble and sore but he had spoken. Tears were still streaming down his face, dropping into his already wet lap. He looked up and for the first time, he seemed to really I see Harry. His eyes were not sparkling any more, gone was the cold fire. He looked broken and shattered and his look pleaded for Harry not to desert him.
"Ahhm... could you say that... that last bit again...? He stammered. Hermione raised her brows. "I knew you didn't hear a word we talked." She said sighing. "I haven't said anything in the last 5 minutes at all."
They were woken by Ron's loud shouting the next morning. Harry stirred and tried to get what he meant. Ron was running down the stairs and stopped dead when he saw them huddled together on the couch. He went very pink and stared at them.
"Mrs. Weasly... Please, whatever you read about the hearing in the papers... don't think any different of him. I know he would like you not to know, but I don't think there's a way around it once the Prophet gets a hold of it..."
He conjured up a glass of something that Harry strongly suspected of being Firewhisky.
"I might have." Draco continued. "If Harry hadn't stopped me." He looked back at his lover and a sad little smile crossed his face.
"Sorry, Ron. We had a talk and then just fell asleep down here... I didn't want to worry you."
"Mrs. Weasly, how come you are already awake?" ,he said with surprise. A glance on his watch told him it was only half past a quarter to seven.
The blonde continued mumbling a bit, but after a while, Harry felt his breathing become deeper and steadier and his weight become more heavy. He positioned himself so that Draco sled down and came to rest with his head in Harry's lap. He stirred a bit and tucked himself to a small ball again but he didn't wake. Harry started to stroke his hair. He hoped that Draco would be able to get at least a bit of sleep now. He needed it so desperately. And then Harry had an Idea. Ron had explained to him that the ministry couldn't actually detect who had done magic so no one would notice if he did it in a house full of Wizards who were allowed. He tugged out his Wand and mumbled " Expecto Patronum". The silver white stag erupted from his wand. It turned and looked at Harry.
"Harry and Draco are gone!"
"At one point they will find out, at the latest when we get back to Hogwarts. It's okay to let them read it. It will spare me to have to explain it to them. Just tell them if they ask that nothing in this article, for once, is exaggerated. " He looked sad, Mrs. Weasly on the edge of tears again. Harry cleared his throat.
"So," he smiled a bit wider, "What's for Dinner? I am starving!"
"We are going to apparate a bit but we will have to go also by Muggle transport system because you two have got to go through the Visitors entrance.", he answered and smiled reassuringly to Draco, who didn't seem to have heard a word.
"Meanwhile, the other Weasly's came out of their rooms, awoken by Ron's shouts and there was a bit of confusion and a lot of laughter as He had to explain the situation over and over again because they were all talking at the same time.
"I didn't think I would ever have to deal with one of these again." He sighed, then hoisted himself up a little and looked at them expectantly. Harry saw Draco swallow. Would he be able to do it?
, you know?" he tried to imply the truth without saying it out loud, but Ron just looked at him with puzzlement. Harry sighed.
"... we will let Mr. Weasly handle it, OK?" he finished the sentence. "I wouldn't want you get hurt again over something like that. I've been running away from the Dursley's my whole life, believe me, I have experience enough. They would never catch me." He grinned broadly to convince Draco who still looked worried.
"I don't know...", he muttered quietly. Harry watched him carefully. Thinking about what happened had caused a Panic-attack that had shaken the blonde very thoroughly. But now he only looked tired again.
"A 'Flesheater'?, asked Madame Bones sharply. Draco nodded.
"You interfering little brat." He said it slowly, very calm, but Harry could hear the coldness, the hatred behind this.
They where all chattering, Fred and George still teasing Ron to be "such a Nanny" for worrying so much. When they finally broke apart, Harry caught up with Mr. Weasly. He threw a glance at Draco, who looked suddenly a paler than usually, but nodded.
Harry looked back, but Draco had vanished again in the thick crowd of pupils.
"Not for what happened. I am sorry, that it took me so long to find you. I should have seen it earlier, should have given you someone to tell all this." He looked deep into those blue crystals, like ice, or the sea, incomprehensible and mysterious. Draco looked back and when he smiled now, it was a real smile.
He waved his wand to make room and nodded towards a two small stools while he sat down on the only chair.
He edged closer in on Harry who wanted to raise his wand but at that moment he heard Mr. Weasly call "Petrificus Totalus!" Uncle Vernon's Hands and legs snapped together and he fell on the ground with a loud 'thud' , not being able to move more than his eyes, which bulged at Harry, displaying such fury and hate that Harry had a real doubt about returning here next summer.
With a swift movement he pulled his Wand out of his back pocket and waved it, murmuring a little spell against Draco's Collarbones. The clothes of the Blonde vanished. He gasped in shock and his eyes found Harry's. Who smirked.
He sat down again, looking murderous at Draco.
First, nothing happened. Then Harry could hear footsteps, slow and soft on the other side. The door opened slowly and there stood Narcissa Malfoy.
"He didn't mean it y'know?" Harry asked a bit timidly but Mrs. Weasly waved him of.
First Harry thought Draco had felt offended, because he usually avoided physical contact with everyone, except Harry. But then he saw his eyes and it was as if he was looking I the mirror. In the Slytherin's eyes shone the same emotion that he had felt the first time Mrs. Weasly had hugged him and kissed him goodbye on King's Cross to send him of to Hogwarts. It was the deep and desperate wish to have her as a mother. To be able to feel this love everyday and call it his own. And for the first time Harry understood, that you could be very lonely even if you had a family. And he asked himself if Draco's mother had ever hugged and kissed him in all his life.
"Thank you", he said again and Harry knew, that he didn't mean the combing of his hair.
For so long Draco had pretended that this wasn't real, that his Parents where loving, caring people, that he was proud of his lineage, even that his family was better then other due to there bloodstatus. And even though Harry was sure that Draco made the right decision in this, it could not be easy to see your whole world crumble around you until only the rubble was left.
"Have you seen him In there? No, I am pretty sure that he is genuine." His Voice shook a bit. Ron shook his head. "No I haven't. But I know I have also never seen Dad and Mum look so serious and, quiet frankly, furious, so it must be really bad, mustn't it?" He shrugged. "If he's not trying to hurt you, I think I can live with it. Though it really is a little shock...", he murmured, but smiled. And Harry smiled back, though weakly, glad he didn't have to choose between his best friend and his boyfriend. He sighed heavily.
Ron seldom noticed Draco waking up, the Slytherin never said a word. He never screamed, just whimpered sometimes. Harry thought that he stopped screaming probably a long time ago. People who liked to inflict pain on others usually where edged on by screaming and pleading, Harry knew that from his experience with Dudley. He could only imagine that Draco had come to a similar conclusion with his father.
"Don't leave me." ,he whispered pleadingly. Harry shook his Head. He'd rather die. Mrs. Weasly took a look at them and stood up. She worked as quickly and carefully as possible, removing the bandages, applying the potion and putting the new bandages on. The whole time, Harry was holding Draco's Hand in one of his, pressing his forehead against his lovers and caressing his cheek with his other, trying to wipe a away the tears of pain, that rolled down them, as Draco whimpered and even gave two or three little screams during the Procedure. When Mrs. Weasly was done, his chest were heaving and small sobs escaped his throat. But he was still conscious, which made Harry very glad. He continued stroking his face and Hair, whispering soothingly into his ear. Mrs. Weasly looked at them with a mixture of extreme sadness and pure anger, then she lay one hand on Harry's shoulder and left the room. Harry stayed where he were, his forehead still against Draco's who's sobs slowly subsided. When the Slytherin looked up, he looked tired, but better and more awake than before. He rose Harry's hand to his lips and kissed it.
There, in front of him stood Draco. But what a shape he was in! He was wet, small cuts went across his face as if he had been dashing through the bushes and trees, his shirt was torn in various places and he had wrapped his arms around himself, shivering visibly in the cold night air. For a second, Harry was too shocked to say anything or react in any kind of way. Then he ushered Draco in, closing the door carefully behind him and leading him up the stairs, warning him of the first step.
"Well it's going to be a bit cramped but if we stick together we should squeeze all in.", he said smiling. Harry looked at him, but decided not to ask. So they cramped into the box, and Mr. Weasly dialed the number "62442" on the dial plate
The Slytherin took Harry's face into his Hands and kissed him hungrily on the mouth. This broke the trance and Harry wrapped his Arms around the other boy, pulling him even closer, deepening the kiss, parting the other boys Lips with his tongue. For a while they just stood and kissed, hungry for each others touch and love. Then slowly, Draco backed away, pulling Harry with him. He lay down on the bed now, so that the Griffyndor was above him, staring into those bright blue Eyes.
"I can't, " he said apologetically. "I have to ask him first, if I can tell you. It's not my place to decide." Mrs. Weasly looked very sad, but not, thought Harry because he wouldn't trust her. She probably guessed that there was more to this than just a beating.
Harry suddenly realized. The whole world would soon know. There was no way the ministry could keep that covered up, not with Lucius Malfoy being such a highly influential figure in it. He wondered if Draco had come to this conclusion yet and whether or not he should bring it up.
"Thank you.", he whispered, his voice still hoarse from crying. Harry smiled and sat himself next to Draco, careful not to touch his back at all times. He kissed him softly on the mouth and smiled. Mrs. Weasly came back into the room, in her hands a bowl with hot Chicken soup. The sight brought Draco to tears again. He began to eat slowly, then as if his body was suddenly realizing how hungry it was nearly drank the bowl up. When he was done, he looked at the bowl and then pleadingly at Mrs. Weasly.
I solemnly vow to transform you into a Muggle Garden gnome and stuff you into a hole
"Yes, we wouldn't want to spy on something... naughty."
He wondered what Draco was doing. Was he drinking a cool juice in that great mansion of his? Maybe they even had a pool in which he could swim on hot days. But than he remembered the look on his face when he talked about home and asked himself, not for the first time, what the blonde didn't tell him. What could be so wrong at his home, that he didn't want to go back to his family?
"Draco, what exactly do you want?", He then asked slowly. Draco looked at him, puzzled. "What do you mean, 'what do I want'? Isn't it obvious?" Over the Past to days, Draco had regained a bit of his self-consciousness, even if it was only a shadow of what he had been before. Funny, it seemed that locking them both in here was the best thing Uncle Vernon could have done. It allowed Harry to concentrate on Draco completely.
Draco nodded.
Harry was at Draco's side faster than anyone could say 'curse' and the spell that Draco had directed at the heart of his father was distracted so that it hit the wall opposite. The black haired boy held Draco's Wand-arm firmly in his grip, keeping the struggling boy from shooting more curses.
With a last laugh they vanished through the door just as Ron came back, throwing them an exasperated look.
Ginny whirled around and stared at him. "What are you...? Wait, how I make him feel? Are you kidding me?" She rose up, her eyes glittering with fury.
"Go away, Mom, I'm fine. And if it is you, Fred and George, stop mocking me! You have no Idea how I feel!", Ginny yelled from the inside. Harry ignored her and opened the unlocked door. Ginny sat on her bed, her back towards him.
After a while she stopped crying. Draco looked at her and sorrow filled his eyes. "Mother, I don't know what will happen now. But I will protect you. I will care for you. Don't worry. Just hold on and I will take care of you. Trust me." His voice broke a little but his eyes were dry. His mother smiled.
"It was not... all... that person did to... to me. There was more." Harry could feel Draco's heart pounding on his wrist, loud and hard. Mr. Weasly looked concerned and worried. "What else, Draco? What else did that person do to you?" His voice was soft and full of compassion.
"Wait here a moment, okay? I'm going to get Mrs. Weasly. Maybe she can give you something against the pain." He kissed Draco's forehead and hurried to get her. He barely had uttered a word when she strode past him, a jug of water in her one, bandages and the potion in the other hand.
Hastily, Harry scribbled a note 'I am downstairs. Don't come down! I'll be back soon. I love you' , so that Draco wouldn't worry when he woke up and lay it on the Pillow. He needed to keep the Dursley away from him at any cost. A meeting would have been awkward at best times, but in the state he was just in... it would be horrible. Harry couldn't let that happen.
Wouldn't it be better if the Weasly's heard it from him and not from the 'Prophet' But then, it had taken Draco everything he had, to confide in Mr. Weasly and the day after tomorrow, he would have to do it again before a whole court. He guessed all he could do was tell the other that they please didn't think any different of him if they found out the truth.
Harry looked at Draco, who seemed uncomfortable. He looked around as if he was seeing the place for the first time too. Then he looked at Harry and there was a kind of pleading, mixed with defiance in his voice.
So deep in his head, he didn't hear Mrs. Weasly until he registered a pair of feet right in front of him. He looked up, startled, causing Draco to stir and hastily started stroking his hair again, listening to his now again steady breathing. Mrs. Weasly was standing there, a plate in her hand who's contents Harry couldn't see from his angle but which smelled like cookies. She smiled a bit sadly, then sat down opposite him, putting the plate down. Chocolate Chips.
"There, my dear. That should do it, I think." Mrs. Weasly said smiling after she had finished. Draco turned around and looked at her, for the first time since that argument.
Harry shuddered and began kissing the pale boy's nipples, who was moaning and writhing beneath him. He himself could not suppress a gasp when their erections touched and Draco whimpered slightly.
She is a little like a ghost, floating around and a bit indifferent to what is happening around her. When I said She probably didn't know what was going on, I meant it. She probably really doesn't. It wouldn't fit her view of the world, so even if she somehow got a hint of it, she will have buried it, somewhere in her subconsciousness. She can't cope with the real world. Or with problems.
"Mr. Potter have you ever seen the signs of this Whipping?" asked him curtly.
Draco watched her roam about the kitchen collecting, bowls and Eggs and Flour, his expression not quite readable to Harry.
"And what are you, Draco? Because I think you have got it wrong somewhere. It is your father, who people would watch with disgust, not you." He raised his hand and put it under Draco's chin to make him look at the Griffyndor.
"It's ok, I'm not going anywhere..." Harry hold the clothes towards Draco and this time, the other took them. He looked at them with a kind of confused look.
Three weeks before Term started, Harry couldn't take it any longer. When Draco woke that night, Harry took his hand and let him down the stairs and into the living room so that they could talk without waking Ron.
Ron seemed as uncomfortable as the Slytherin, standing there for a while without saying anything. Then he cleared his throat.
Malfoy senior laughed. Cold, and without any happiness.
"Who was it Draco? Who did all this to you?"
" I understand, Draco. If you want, I will lead everything into it's way. As I said, there will be an inquiry. I cannot spare you this, you will have to say this words again before a Judge and Jury. I am sorry. I wish there was a way around it..."
It was silent in the room. The kind of deadly, deafening silence that you had before a storm. Draco still trembled and Harry could feel his heart eating through his hand, hard and fast.
