Harry chuckled and Draco was too turned on to even care, in fact the vibrations of Harry’s laughter went straight to his dick. He let out an embarrassing squeak when Harry found the buttons on his outerwear.
Draco glared at him. His cock was throbbing and all he could think about was what Harry’s calloused fingers would feel like inside of him, so he caved. “P-Please, Harry, I need you in--” Draco could barely choke the words out. “Inside me. Please.”
Draco felt as though he had been lying beneath his satin sheets for an eternity. In reality, however, it’d only been a few hours, but time seemed impossible to measure when all he could think about was the way Harry’s hands had felt on his skin the night before. Draco groaned into his pillow, feeling hot and restless. He’d never been so attracted to another person before, never so completely infatuated, and he hated everything about it. Why would he, a Prince, have his heart set on someone so unattainable? He could have anyone he wanted, man or woman, and yet all he could think about was Potter. He was undeniably turned on; even the mere thought of Harry pressed against him had him hard and yearning.
Draca colored once again at the implications of Harriet’s words. She stepped away quickly, almost tripping over her own feet, and smoothed out her robes so awkwardly that even ‘Mione laughed aloud at the sight.
“You know our family, sweetheart,” She continued. “If you’re falling for someone, they are certainly worthy of keeping the family’s name. A Malfoy hasn’t betrothed anyone of inferior magic for hundreds of years, whether the marriage was arranged or not. Perhaps this person will be chosen.”
“I was two feet away. And you were ready. You didn’t even need me, you just freaked out like the pansy you are and forgot about what you were supposed to be doing.”
He sighed, still shaken, and pulled out his book of Dangerous Magical Items. A distraction, he thought. That’s what I need.  He blew a thin layer of dust off of the purple cover and thumbed through the pages halfheartedly. He laughed humorlessly at his sudden mental image of Hermione berating him for allowing a book to become so dirty.
"Not used to being put in your place, are you?” Harry asked, beginning to speak once again before allowing Draco to respond. “Are you going to help me or not? Because if you aren’t I don’t see the point of your hanging around.”
Draca said nothing, but gasped when Harriet slipped a warm hand under her robes and caressed her taut stomach. Slowly but surely she trailed upward, slipping nimble fingers under Draca’s lace bra. Harriet sighed at the softness of Draca’s breasts, kissing her again.
“I’m on duty, Harry. I’m helping Mr. Longbottom here find our top selections on Herbology,” Hermione said sternly. And sure enough, there was Neville, waving awkwardly at Harry and struggling to hold his huge pile of books in the process. Harry nodded at him and turned his attention back to an agitated Hermione.
Harry was confused, but grateful. Perhaps he had lit the fire and forgotten? He sighed contentedly, rolling around in his blankets and smiling. He breathed in the scent of burning wood, a welcome odor, and his chest bloomed with happiness. What a fantastic night, he thought, immediately seizing the opportunity. Harry fetched the copy of his book from under the dusty velvet sofa. He had been hiding it there for months, Uncle Vernon would never approve and Dudley would burn it up, and so far he had not been caught. The novel was old and yellowing, with a rusty red cover and loose binding. The Tale of the Deathly Hallows.
“His company and forgiveness. Now tell me. Is. He. Here.” Draco slammed his serpent-encrusted scepter into the wooden floor, which vibrated under their feet and caused Vernon to flinch rather pathetically.
“What, you think you’re better than me because you’re rich?” Harry scoffed. “Get out of my way, I have places to be.”
“I…” Draco flushed, now, and stared at his hands. They lacked jewels and appeared strangely naked without them. “My father has forbidden me to see you. Normally I...I would respect his wishes. However I...chose to make an exception, this time.”
The retainer lead Draco through the richly furnished halls of the palace, ornate tapestries adorned the walls and thick plush carpets muffling their footsteps.
Hermione clapped a hand over Harry’s mouth and then Ron was yanking him into the bushes. Harry would have cussed, called Ron every name in the book, if it wasn’t for the fact that his mouth was still blockaded. He had half a mind to lick Hermione’s hand, but before he could do so she began speaking in frantic whispers:
“Yes. The name’s James Blake, Violent Crimes Division. At your service.” Malfoy reached out a spindly hand and shook the woman’s hand firmly and with crisp professionalism. Harry raised an eyebrow. Malfoy wasn’t bad at this.
He groaned into his pillow, shuddering slightly. He wanted to get off. He really, really, wanted to get off; but there were more important matters at hand.
After hours of drudgery, Harry finally finished the odious task. He had done a surprisingly decent job of it--Harry thought for a moment that maybe he should pursue a career in housekeeping. He shuddered at the mere prospect of it.
“It’s true, Harry,” Ron said. “You know, my loyalty is always with His Highness but you’re my friend. And part of a knight’s oath is to protect, so…’Mione and I are taking you back with us to my mum and dad’s house.”
“I was worried about how you would react. I was worried you would reject me.” Draco took a breath and met Harry’s eyes.
Draco sat at the desk and doodled with Harry’s muggle ‘pen’. He was too tired to even attempt convincing Harry to do something other than obsessing over the news. When he ran out of room on the silly paper with lines, he spelled the ink away and restarted. He decided to take down the silencing charm on a gut feeling so he could hear if anyone was coming.
“What did he do, tell you that you look like a pig on legs? Because that’s not cheek, Dud. That’s true.” Dudley ground his teeth.
"Love, you need to eat. I can't stand seeing you like this. It hurts me." Harry met Draco's eyes and picked up his sandwich. He nibbled it slowly, but Draco didn't care. As long as he was eating something, it would be okay. He lightly brushed his fingers over Harry's Mark in a soothing manner.
Harry walked down to the Great Hall with Draco. They decided they would sit at Gryffindor during breakfast, take lunch in their rooms, and eat at Slytherin for supper. Ron and Hermione were talking quietly, and kissing on occasion. Harry sat down and made a gagging noise. Hermione laughed and Ron pulled away from Hermione in shock. Upon seeing Harry, he laughed and snogged Hermione on the spot.
Pansy snorted. “Yeah, a long day of shagging.” Harry blushed. “Don’t think we didn’t know. Draco dear, your hair says it all. Harry, on the other hand, his hair always looks like he’s just been shagged. Maybe you two were getting it on before you found out you were Soulmates.” Draco snorted.
Suddenly the dream changed. He and Harry were crouched in a confined space. It was dark; so dark that Draco could hardly see. The only light came from small slots built into what looked like the door. The air was stale and dusty, and as his vision adjusted, Draco realized where they were. Harry’s breathing as sharp and labored beside him. Draco instantly pulled Harry into his lap and tried to calm him down.
They flew about the turrets of the castle, avoiding smashing into the sturdy walls and nearly breaking a few windows in the chase. Harry tried to throw a curse at the dragon, but it only slowed him down. He heard a whoosh of air and felt a stinging in his shoulder. The beast had managed to hit him with its tail! He was lucky it was only a scratch, or Draco would kill him.
that the pain Veela feel when they are away from their Mates subsides within a few months. It’s been a lot longer than that. I was just wondering whether that pain has subsided.” Hermione blushed and looked down.
“Fine, but after the competition, you’re all mine for the rest of the day, deal?” Draco grinned wolfishly.
Draco stood and tucked his chin over Harry’s shoulder so he could read the letter from Sirius with him.
“Because he has that class with me! He can’t come rushing in and make up something about Snape demanding me in his office if he’s in the class!”
Dumbledore stood at the podium for breakfast announcements. "The next challenge will take place next month. The champions will go through a maze Hagrid is currently growing to find the Triwizard Championship cup. But beware, inside the maze will be horrors you have never faced before. The maze will challenge you not just physically, but mentally. You will face your worst fears, and fears you could never imagine. Prepare yourselves well champions. Be ready for anything." Dumbledore paused. "In other news, exams will be withheld until after the competition. That way the champions have time to worry about the challenge. Classes will resume as normal come next week, and Hagrid will be replaced by Professor Grubblyplank for Care of Magical Creatures the rest of this term so as he can focus on growing the maze. That's the end of the announcements for today. Enjoy the rest of your meal."
Harry tried to stay in the park. He really did. But after fifteen minutes of sitting on the only unbroken swing (Dudley and his gang must have broken the other when he was away), he got bored. He left the park and wandered around aimlessly for a bit until he found himself at the entrance to the Underground. Might as well buy a paper and have some lunch then. None of the newspapers or magazines showed anything of interest, and after eating a quick sandwich from a vendor, Harry wandered on.
Pansy smiled and told Blaise, "Dear, remember not to be a sore loser. You're pants at chess." He glared at her. Draco and Harry were planning how to see each other during the summer.
“Oh fuck, Harry. You’re perfect.” He kissed every inch of the exposed skin until Harry moaned loudly.
“And you have two weeks. If you’re still freaking out about all this and stressing in two weeks, I’m carting you off to my house.” Harry laughed and nodded.
“Those are books I’m going to study. I still don’t know much about the physical aspects of being a Veela. Mother only taught me what I would need to know about Veela Soulmates.” Draco sighed and picked up another book to scan for helpful information. Harry nodded and stood.
Harry nodded. “The Dursleys don’t care, so long as they don’t have any other ‘freaks’ anywhere near their house. I told them they didn’t have to worry about that.” Draco took a calming breath, trying to focus on not overreacting. “How are we going to get there?”
"I love you too. I don't think we should get off the platform at the same time." He nodded. Harry went first. The Dursleys were waiting at platform nine for him. He watched as Draco walked through a few seconds after him.
“Fine. But when I go to Diagon Alley to get my school supplies, I’m exchanging some galleons to Muggle money so
"I'm not sure what this means, but it's not good. I think someone used the Cruciatus Curse on Harry." The occupants of the tent gasped in shock.
"Harry, my Harry. I love you so much." He was running his fingers through Harry's soft hair. Harry turned his head and kissed Draco's bare chest. Draco's heart fluttered. "I'm going to protect you, no matter what cost." His hand slid to Harry's back and squeezed him. His wings were unfurled and they gently grazed Harry's spine, bringing shivers to his dark skin.
Harry turned his head and pressed a kiss to Draco’s chest. He mumbled, “You’re all wet.” Draco laughed.
Lucius walked through the wards of Bulstrode Manor. He understood that Elvira had a daughter, Millicent, but she wasn't bride material in Lucius's opinion. Besides, Astoria's father and he were close and agreed there would be a reasonable dowry price and marriage contract. A house elf opened the door for him and led him to the conservatory. The smell of decay filled his nostrils. They were still walking through the halls, so Lucius cast a subtle Impervius Charm on his nose. He'd be able to breathe, but not smell. The house elf opened the door and Lucius walked through.
—” Hermione took a breath. “You need to stop talking yourself into a spiral. Draco loves you or he would have left you by now. You know this as well as I do. He’s not a martyr. He’s been living with you for years now, the only reason he kept his flat for as long as he did was because Pansy was in that abusive relationship and he wanted her to have a place she recognized and felt welcome at. She wouldn’t be able to feel that at your house.” Harry sighed.
“Draco, I’m so sorry!” Harry whispered into his chest. He was now lying with the blond in the conjured bed as the judges determined the scores. Draco hushed him and stroked his back. He was still in pain from their separation, and he needed Harry to be close to him. Fleur watched the pair with interest while Viktor Krum and Cedric Diggory talked in hushed voices about Hermione and Cho. Dumbledore was making sure Rita Skeeter couldn't get through the Wards. She had already written a scandalous article about Harry and Draco’s Mateship, which most of the school believed.
“Shut it,” Dudley growled. subconsciously, Harry knew he should stop, but he wasn’t thinking of the consequences, only of how angry he was.
“Harry, it’s okay, I’m here. I’m not going anywhere. You’re okay. This isn’t real, it’s just a dream.” Harry buried his face in Draco’s neck as Draco hugged him tightly. Draco closed his wings around them.
“No fair! You can’t just stop!” Harry whined. He got out of bed and over to his Veela, who leaned against the wall casually.
Harry remembered. The rest of the news consisted of a helicopter that almost crashed, (it had nothing to do with Voldemort, just a drunk pilot) a celebrity divorce, and a bird that learned how to waterski. If the news was talking about water skiing birds, there truly was no more news.
“You’ll like it, Potter. I have excellent taste,” Pansy sleekly said. Harry reluctantly pulled away from Draco.
“Deal. I should head to Astronomy. It starts in a few minutes.” He nodded and placed a kiss on Draco’s cheek. Draco turned beet red and looked away.
“Sounds easy enough, but ‘Ron’ will have to be decent as well. I can trust Granger, but I don’t trust him to be as supportive of this.”
This one is a bit longer than the others. I think this is where I started to get a hang of writing this and developing their personalities. They do get a lot longer than this though, I promise.
“Harry, there you are,” Draco said with a sigh of relief. He rushed over and pulled Harry into his arms.
“We should head back.” Harry looked around to see if they were alone before placing a kiss on Draco’s cheek and throwing the invisibility cloak over him.
Suddenly, Harry felt cold. Very cold. He looked around and noticed that it was quiet. The only sound he could hear was Dudley’s whimpering and his own heavy breathing. It was dark too; like someone had put a black blanket over the entire street. “Kn-knock it off! Make it stop!”
Draco picked his wand up off of the small bed stand where it sat next to Harry’s and waved it. All of Harry’s things and a few of his own flew into Harry’s trunk. He summoned an elf and had it take Harry’s trunk and broom to the Manor. He then threw the window open as far as it would go. The sun was already set and Privet Drive was dark.
“I need all of the Gryffindors to report to my classroom. Mr. Malfoy, you may come with Harry if you wish. I’ve already cleared you with Professor Snape.”
“I have to get dressed,” he whined. Harry poked his side with a laugh as he accepted his glasses and read the letter.
“Me too,” Harry whimpered. Draco brushed his lips over Harry’s as they both came. Draco collapsed half on top of Harry. Harry expelled a small bit of air from his weight, but said nothing and tangled his fingers in the pale strands of hair on his head.
I'm bored so I'm updating now. (again, try to ignore the cringe, it's still early into the fic. I'm working on chapter 15 as of current.)
The bathroom had a bathtub the size of a pool in the center of it and the walls reflected light in the way the ocean floor looks. Harry looked inquisitively at Draco and pulled the egg from his bag.
Draco guided Harry to a booth in the corner and they sat across from each other. Draco held Harry's hand on top of the table and they made small talk. When Harry noticed the food and coffee coming, He pulled his hand away. The girl from earlier brought the coffees over, followed by a young boy, about fourteen or so, carrying a small platter of pastries.  The boy set down the platter and went back to the kitchen.
“I love you too. See you soon,” Draco whispered back. He walked outside and smiled at Harry as he slowly shut the door, not wanting to lose sight of Draco’s face. Harry walked upstairs quickly and opened his bedroom door. Lo and behold, Draco was sitting on his bed. Harry smiled and shook his head with a snort. He closed the door and Draco cast a locking spell and silencing charm on it. Harry saw that his trunk and broomstick were now in the room again. Draco must have had an elf bring them.
Draco toweled off and put on a pair of boxers and pajama pants. He took Harry's shirt with him out of the bathroom and collapsed on the bed with it, hugging it close. It was easier to get to the Manor at night so Muggles didn't see him flying out of Harry's window, and from the Manor, he would Floo directly to Gringotts in the morning at opening hours. It was the fastest and safest way, but it also meant sleeping without Harry the entire night. Draco could only hope Harry slept well.
When she walked back to the counter, Harry spoke up. “Okay, what the hell are paninis and what’s pesto?” Draco laughed.
“Yes, but that doesn’t change the fact that you could be an imposter as well.” He turned to Remus. “Ask him something only Harry Potter would know.”
Harry sighed. "We'll both take it. On three. One, two, three!" They both grabbed the handles of the Cup. There was a tugging sensation behind Harry's naval, and his the ground seemed to disappear. Harry knew instantly that it was a portkey. Maybe it was supposed to take them out of the maze!
“I’m here, love.” He turned in the direction of the voice and spotted the Veela at the small desk in the corner.
“I didn’t make that noise and my friend had to drop me off at the park because they had to do something important and I couldn’t go.”
Harry was still clutching Cedric's body when Dumbledore ran over to him. He tried to pull Harry away, but he screamed, "Voldemort's back! He killed him! I promised him I'd take his body back!" Cho was startled by the outburst, and she noticed her wrist.
Harry’s eyes lit up as he reached for Draco’s wand on the end table. Draco’s heart palpitated when Harry’s fingers wrapped around his wand. Harry waved the wand and the cleaning spell washed over both of them. Harry stretched and sat up.
“There are two bedrooms. I thought…” Draco trailed off and blushed a violent red color. Harry walked over to him and took his hands.
"Harry love, yes!" Draco moaned. He cupped the back of Harry's neck, pulling him closer. Harry moaned over the skin of Draco's neck, then caught his lips in another passionate kiss. Draco wrapped his arms around his Mate's back and pulled him back onto the bed so that Harry was laying on his chest. Harry began rutting against Draco's hip, seeking any friction he could get. Draco rolled his hips and licked a strip up the shell of Harry's ear.
“Mother it’s not like that! His aunt and uncle are homophobic and it wouldn’t be safe for him if they knew he was gay,” Draco quickly clarified.
"I don't know. I was just going to send up some sparks for her." Cedric nodded as Harry sent up the red sparks. There was a roar of wind that nearly knocked them off of their feet and the maze began to close. "Run!" He and Cedric ran as fast as they could in the opposite direction. Fleur was enclosed in the rapidly moving branches when suddenly all of the movements stopped. They traveled together for some time when they came across Viktor. His eyes were glazed over and he was muttering under his breath. When he saw Cedric, he grunted and tackled him to the ground, hood wand pressed against Cedric's throat. Harry tried pulling him off, but he was too big.
“Go on. I think you’ll like it!” Harry was sitting at Draco’s feet, looking up with a smile at the blond.
“Yeah, it’s a bit extreme, I know.” Harry’s eyes were fixed on the large window overlooking the grounds. They were a few stories above ground level, which made the view even better. “Do you want to take a walk around the grounds later?”
He reluctantly pulled Harry's shirt off and hugged it to his chest, breathing in its scent one last time, before setting it gently on the vanity. He pulled off the jeans and his boxers, banishing the boxers to the laundry room and putting the jeans in the bag he was taking back to Harry's. His shower was almost a room of its own. He had wanted to show it to Harry, (preferably while neither of them were dressed and both of them were horny) but if his mother said it wasn't safe, then it wasn't safe. He wouldn't risk endangering Harry for amazing shower sex. He could wait…
“Calm down, I can help you through it. I’ve been in a lot of advanced courses this year. I’ll tutor you or something.” Draco rubbed calming circles on Harry’s back and placed a soothing kiss on his forehead.
“Maybe I was jealous! Maybe I wanted to make friends as easily as you but didn’t know how because all I’ve ever known was how my father treated people!” He ran his hands through his hair. The thread grew to accommodate the movement, but when he tried to step away from him, it wouldn’t budge. If felt good to get all of this off his chest, but he was worried about how Potter would react. He looked over worriedly at him. Potter looked abnormally calm.
"Come visit me tonight if you can," Harry said. He locked lips with Draco. It deepened and Harry groaned into it as he straddled Draco's waist again. They pressed their bodies together in a desperate goodbye. They heard a knocking on the compartment door and pulled apart
“That’s okay. If you don’t want to we won’t.” Draco suppressed a yawn. “You need to eat. I’m sure Granger and Weasley must be worried you disappeared last night.”
“We can’t spend the entire weekend in that room. As much as I love having time alone with you, I hate being cooped up in that small space.” Harry nodded.
A loud crash downstairs made both of them jump. Draco was on his feet in an instant, grabbing his wand from the desk and standing between Harry and the door. Harry sat up quickly, grabbing his wand from its spot under the pillow, leaping to his feet beside Draco. Draco unfurled his wings and tried to block Harry from view, but Harry shoved the wing aside. There was a clicking sound as the door unlocked and swung open.
Harry smirked and looked around before whispering, “So if I was butt naked and spread out on your bed with a hard-on, you could resist me?” Draco turned a violent shade of red and hid his face in his hands.
“Yes, much thank you.” Draco stood and helped Harry to his feet. He gathered lifted the bag with the egg inside and guided him to the Prefect’s bathroom. “Cedric told me the egg has something to do with water. Do you want to solve it in here?”
"That's not the problem here. The Dark Lord has returned and the Potter boy isn't going to be alive much longer." Draco bared his teeth and snarled.
Harry nearly choked on the bite of food in his mouth when he heard Draco moan as he bit into his burrito. “This is the best thing I’ve ever eaten. What is this called again?” Harry swallowed the bite of burrito he was chewing before responding.
Draco and Harry were the earliest they had ever been showing up at the Burrow for Christmas dinner. They were only fifteen minutes late. Molly greeted them both at the door and kissed both of them on the cheek. She ushered them into the house and settled them in the living room.
The Manor was cold and foreboding, just like when he left. It had never felt like home to Draco. He spent most of his time in the gardens with his mother, or in the library with his godfather, Severus. Lucius guided him to the conservatory. His hand didn't leave Draco's shoulder, but ever since they passed through the wards, his fingers had tightened with a vise-like grip. When they walked through the conservatory door, Lucius threw Draco forward. "You didn't come! Harry and I were in trouble and you just left us to die! Severus owled you and you just ignored it. I bet you made mother stay as well! I know she'd want to help me—" A hard slap met his cheek and Draco stumbled backward.
“I’ve seen worse. You should have seen my room when I was younger,” she said lightly. Tonks waved her wand and Harry’s things started floating into his trunk. Draco watched as his possessions floated into the trunk alongside Harry’s. Tonks Vanished most of the garbage strewn over the floor.
Pansy, Draco, Theo, Blaise, and Harry sat in a circle on the floor of the common room. They passed the bottle around, each of them taking large swigs of the contents. When Draco passed it to him, he smelled it first. It smelled of vanilla, strawberries, and chocolate. The smell seemed to change as he smelled.
“Are you still hungry?” Harry nodded and Draco summoned an elf. “Can you bring us a breakfast tray?” the elf bowed so low it’s floppy ears brushed the carpet.
"The Sorting Hat almost put me there, actually. I didn't want to because you were such an arsehole." Pansy heard this and doubled over in laughter.
"Don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter! I want you to look me in the eyes when I kill you! I want to watch the light leave your eyes!" Harry thought for a moment. He did not want to die a coward. He'd die like his mum and dad. Facing death. He stood and walked calmly out from behind the tombstone.
“I love you too.” When they both finished eating, Harry straddled Draco’s lap and wrapped his arms around his shoulders. Draco Banished the tray to the kitchen. Harry leaned forward to kiss Draco but his glasses bumped against Draco’s cheek. They both laughed and Harry threw his glasses back onto the end table. Harry kissed Draco slowly and tenderly. Draco ran his hands up and down Harry’s thighs a few times before rubbing gentle circles over his hip bones with the pads of his thumbs. Harry tangled the fingers of one hand into Draco’s hair and cupped his cheek with the other. Harry moved his hand from Draco’s face and pulled on Draco’s shirt, trying to get it off. Draco’s head got stuck inside with his arms still halfway in the sleeves. Draco laughed and pulled it off himself. When his face was visible, Harry locked their lips again in a more passionate kiss. Draco started unbuttoning Harry’s shirt slowly, gently caressing each inch of skin he exposed. Harry ran his hands over Draco’s back and his wings. He stroked them delicately as Draco continued his ministrations. Harry broke away for a breath and Draco pressed open-mouthed kisses to his collarbone. He left a trail of love bites in his wake. Harry moaned and buried both of his hands in Draco’s hair. Harry buried his face in Draco’s hair as he turned his attention to his pert nipples. “God yes!” Draco stopped briefly to look at Harry. He was panting lightly, his lips glistened with the saliva from the kiss and his eyes were glazed over. Draco gave Harry a grin.
“I was thinking of going outside. My broom is still with my trunk, right?” Draco nodded and stood. Harry watched him with a small smile as he took in Draco’s naked form. Harry hugged him from behind and kissed the nape of his neck. Draco’s wings shuddered and he turned to face Harry. He placed a gentle kiss on his eyelids and his nose before walking over to the closet.
Draco soared back to him a couple of minutes later and landed softly next to him. “Do you want to come with me?” Again, he sounded unsure.
Draco thought as he ran up the steps. He followed the smell to the Quidditch pitch. Harry sat on his broom, a couple hundred feet in the air. He flew lazy circles around the field; probably clearing his head. He did that a lot.
“I’ll race you!” he said, then shot forward before Draco could even blink. He smiled at the prospect of the challenge and sped after him.
and grinned lightly. "You need to get clothes on," Draco murmured as he ran his hand over his bare chest. Harry laughed.
“Hey, look at me,” Harry said calmly. Draco’s eyes flitted from the plate to Harry’s eyes. Harry took his hand. “Dray, I’m going to be alright. I’ll be back with you within the hour, I swear.” Draco didn’t smile, but his features softened.
“As I said a few seconds ago, no. I have found nothing that will help you breathe underwater for an hour.” The snarky comment made Harry shrink in his seat. Normally there was gentleness behind Draco’s insults, but there was nothing gentle about those words. Draco noticed. He closed his book and lifted Harry into his lap. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I’m just so tired right now, and I’m on edge because you’re in danger and I can’t stop it; I just wish I could help you.” He buried his face in his Mate’s hair and stroked his back.
“Take me. Please,” he begged. There was a low rumble in Draco’s chest at that His wings unfurled and fluttered gracefully. He began preparing him carefully. His fingers worked in and out of Harry at a slow pace. Harry now had both legs wrapped around Draco’s waist, and his back was pressed to the wall of the oversized bath. His arms wrapped around Draco’s shoulders and his fingers threaded the hair lovingly. When Draco added a finger, Harry gasped and thrust down on the digits. Draco moaned at his Mate’s eagerness. Finally, he deemed the entrance well prepared and he lined up with the pink hole. Harry pushed himself down his length, while Draco was losing any sense of self-control he possessed.
“Harry, I’ve caught you practicing your vows at least fifteen times. You’re just lucky you don’t practice at your house or it would have been Draco who caught you.” He laughed. The door opened again and Ron entered. He was fiddling with his tie but quickly stopped when Hermione glared at him.
Draco left a large tip on the table before they walked outside. “Where do you want to go now?” Harry asked.
Madam Pomfrey turned in shock at that. “There’s nothing that can cure that pain besides being together. I’ll speak to Albus. He’ll do something about it or I will. Now off you go. Lunch is soon, and you don’t want to miss the food.” She shooed them out and cast a nervous glance at their retreating forms before casting a Patronus.
"I need to take care of you right now. I feel so useless, not being able to save you." Harry nodded in understanding and murmured thanks. Draco carefully washed the place where Harry was cut. The skin had healed over, but it was slightly tender. He finished washing the rest of him before starting on Harry's hair, massaging soap into it. He leaned into the gentle touch.
“I think I want to finish looking around before lunch, eat, and then we’ll head back to the house. It’s one o'clock so there’s enough time to get back before dark.” Draco let Harry go and took his hand. Harry noted he didn’t call Privet Drive “home,” just “the house.” He smiled to himself.
Harry struggled with his tie as Draco was using the bathroom. Draco had helped him put on his suspenders and the cuff links. He wanted them to have matching cuff links for some reason that escaped Harry. Now the tie was in knots, and not the kind he wanted. Draco walked in. His hair was brushed neatly, and though it lacked gel, it looked posh. He laughed when he saw the mess Harry had made.
“Always. I’ll always come back to you, Dray. I promise.” Draco hugged him one last time and followed McGonagall. Harry sighed and took another bite of eggs before pushing his plate away. He sat quietly until Dumbledore appeared and made the announcement that it was time to go down to the lake for the challenge.
“I know. I wanted to. I love you, Dray,” Harry whispered. He wiped the tear that spilled over Draco’s eye away. “Always.”
They took a seat at the same table they did yesterday. There were more people there today, compared to yesterday’s grand total of two people: Draco and Harry. There was a girl with a computer at a solitary table by a window. She was typing fervently while sipping coffee from a to-go cup. An elderly couple sat at a booth by the door. Draco looked at the old couple with a small smile. “That’ll be us someday.” Harry smiled and took his seat across from Draco. No one in the cafe could see them from their corner thanks to the high backs of the booths.
“It’s okay. If you’re in pain during the night you can come into my room. Don’t hesitate,” Harry assured him. Draco nodded and pulled Harry into one of the bedrooms. There was a bathroom in both rooms, and their luggage was placed at the foot of the beds in the separate sleeping quarters. The beds had grey bedding and blue quilts folded on the lower half of each bed.
“The house elves typically tend the garden, but Mother and I used to take care of it together in the summers.” He took Harry’s hand and led him to a bench in the gazebo. They sat and Harry continued to look around them.
Mad-Eye Moody stood in the doorway. “Put that bloody wand away before you poke someone’s eye out,” he barked gruffly. Draco didn’t move. Harry didn’t either, remembering how Barty Crouch Jr. had posed as Moody for months and then tried to kill him.
Draco was silent for a moment before asking, “Harry, what are Muggle buses like? Are they anything like the Knight Bus?”
“Why should I? Maybe you should try asking nicely,” Draco teased before tearing off the wrappings. The black velvet box sat in Draco’s hand for a full thirty seconds before Draco looked away from it at Harry with questioning eyes.
One owl flew directly to Aunt Petunia, the scarlet envelope falling to her lap. The other gave its letter to Harry.
He was covered in a cold sweat and the sheets were tangled around his legs. Harry angrily pushed them away and sat up. The horizon was just barely showing a bit of pink where the sun would be rising. Harry huffed and took some clothes from his dresser so he could take a quick shower.
Blaise spoke up when they stopped. “Pansy brought the good stuff. We were just planning to ditch this place and head to the common room. Harry and you are always welcome to join when you get tired of this place.” He looked around in an unimpressed manner.
Again, please don't be too harsh!!! I was young and didn't know what plot was XD! I don't think I had an actual plot outlined until several months later, and I didn't concretely write anything down until a lot later!!! When I started this, it was purely on a whim and I have no regrets. I love these characters with every inch of my being.
The water was hot against his skin as he scrubbed himself clean. Draco washed his hair and applied the normal potions to it. One for cleaning and conditioning and the other was for straightening. His hair always had a slight wave to it. It was barely noticeable unless he was brewing potions. The fumes would always make the ends curl. The potion needed to be applied with every shower, but they lasted until his hair got wet again.
“It’s not that deep. Probably about four feet,” Draco estimated. He started getting undressed and taking off his shoes.
“No, I didn’t forget. The person it was for wouldn’t leave my side, so I couldn’t come to pick it up.” Harry ran his hands through his hair. The silver sparks on his wrist glowed softly in the dim shop. The fireplace in the corner bathed the room in a soft light. Harry walked forward. “Can I see it?”
on you, I’ll murder them without hesitation and you can’t stop me.” Harry tucked his face into Draco’s shoulder.
"Out of fear!" he spat. "Although, you have proven useful the past few months." He waved his wand over the stub of Wormtail's arm. Silvery liquid poured from the tip and formed a hand. It solidified and Voldemort walked backward. "Try it out," he said impatiently.
“I’m not sure. As far as I know, if Dumbledore can’t find a replacement teacher, the Ministry will find one. No one wants the job since it’s cursed,” Draco replied.
Draco had been pacing his bedroom anxiously. He tried calming himself by reading a book about Veela magic and learned that his magic couldn't be traced, but this wasn't enough to calm him, although it was helpful information. That meant he could use magic outside of Hogwarts without getting in trouble. He needed to see Harry! He was thinking of ways to knock the door down when the lock clicked and the door swung open. He halted and spun around to face the door. Lucius stood in the doorway. "Come." Draco nodded once and followed. They ended up in one of the many parlors. Hot tea was already on the table and a few biscuits were on a platter.
“I had a nightmare too, but it didn’t make much sense; we were in a clearing in the Forbidden Forest and there was some sort of snaky… I think it was a man but that couldn’t have been right. Men have noses and don’t have red eyes.” Harry stiffened beside him.
“Stubby, would you bring us breakfast?” The elf bowed again and disappeared. It came back a few minutes later with a tray of breakfast. He sat it on the desk and disappeared once more.
“Okay.” He turned away from the mirror to face his best friend and mother. “How do I look?” Pansy smiled.
“Where are we?” Harry turned over and buried his face in Draco’s chest. “It smells like you.” Draco laughed and it reverberated through his chest.
“I’m going to end up using this spell so much I’ll be able to cast it in my sleep.” Harry laughed under his breath and shook his head.
Draco rested his head on his pillow. He couldn’t believe Harry was his Soulmate. He didn’t know whether to be happy it was Harry or cautious at how well he took it. He’d had a crush on The-Boy-Who-Lived since the first year. When Harry made it clear he detested him to the point that friendship was a joke, Draco took to taunting him. He didn’t hate Harry. Quite the opposite, actually. The way he acted around Draco, one would think Harry wouldn’t want to be his Soulmate! He hated him since the first year. One little spell wouldn’t change that. Maybe he was plotting something. Draco would have to be careful.
He stuck his hand out. “You can call me Ron since you’re going to be shagging my best mate.” Draco blanched and Hermione punched Ron in the arm. Harry turned bright red and hid his face in Draco’s shoulder.
“Don’t complain. I saw you the other day wearing the one of mine just so you could smell it.” He blushed at this and pulled off his shirt so he could get dressed.
“There were Dementors. Two of them. They attacked Dudley and me.” Draco’s fingers clenched into a fist and he grit his teeth. Harry pulled the letter from the Ministry out of his pocket and handed it to Draco for him to read. Draco read it over swiftly.
Another Muggle, the one from the train station that had hurt Harry, had his face buried in the morning paper. That must be Harry's Uncle Vernon. Draco balled his hands into fists and tried to keep calm. Vernon's mustache quivered as he breathed heavily. "There's to be a hosepipe ban. No sprinklers, no car washing, no nothing!" he grumbled as though this news was an offense to his very existence. He ate his slice of grapefruit without looking up from the paper. He would most likely buy a real breakfast on his way to work. The Dursley's made trivial conversation, asking Dudley about his summer plans, Petunia gossiping about the neighbors, and Vernon bragging about his promotion. They completely ignored Harry, who didn't seem to mind, and in fact, appeared to be used to it.
“You can figure it out in here.” He tried to extend his wings, but they cramped and he cried out in pain. It should have been easy now that he had cut holes in all of his shirts. Harry timidly walked over.
"Come on boy! We don't have all day!" Uncle Vernon grabbed his arm and jerked him along. He looked back to Draco briefly and saw he was clenching his fists tightly. Harry could see him straining to not lash out. Lucius didn't notice, but took his shoulder and guided him away.
“Are you ready?” Harry nodded and pulled Draco down into a kiss as he pushed in. They moved together slowly, soft kisses and whispered words of adoration passed between them effortlessly. Draco’s wings were surrounding Harry so he couldn’t see anything but Draco. Harry brought his hand up and stroked them with the back of his fingers. “Harry,” Draco murmured in response. He kissed a line down Harry’s jaw to his neck. He kissed the Mark slowly and Harry tilted his head to give Draco better access. Harry buried his fingers in Draco’s hair and clenched his fists gently. Draco moaned in response.

Back at Hogwarts, Cho was sitting in the stands with Cedric's father, Amos, having an animated discussion about Quidditch. No one noticed when the strand of sparks on her wrist was extinguished.
Suddenly, he spotted something off in the distance, coming from the Gryffindor tower; his broom. He ran in an evasive maneuver until the broom was feet from him. He jumped on and shot into the air. The dragon was chained firmly to the ground, but it didn’t seem to make a difference when it snapped out its wings and took after him. The chain grounding it snapped like a twig. Harry flew as fast as he could, but the dragon was faster than his broom.
The figure waved their wand again and Harry was thrown into the air. His back smashed against the angel statue above Tom Riddle's grave and ropes wrapped around him, binding him to it. The figure waved his wand once more and a flame started under the cauldron.
When Harry woke up, the first thing he noticed was that whatever he was laying on was the most comfortable thing he’d ever laid on (besides Draco’s chest that is. The next thing he noticed was that Draco pressed against his back. He was hugging Draco’s arm to his chest and he hugged it tighter when Draco shifted behind him. Draco lifted his head to gaze at Harry’s face. “Morning, love.”
“You’re hair is so soft. Even before we knew we were Soulmates, I wanted to touch it.” Harry whispered. “I used to hate it when you gelled it down. I like it like this.”
“Now, now Severus. Why would Harry want to be in the tournament after all that happened last year? Hasn’t he been through enough already? Besides, Mr. Malfoy’s life is now also at risk.”
"Of course,” Draco said as though it were obvious. “I just have to leave tonight so I can get to the Manor without worrying about Muggles seeing me fly out your window. I’d take you with me but mother told me there would be some dangerous company for a few days. I'll pack some of my things and from there in the morning I'll Floo to Gringotts. I'll be back in your arms by noon and I'll be all yours, I promise." Draco selected a chocolate chip muffin and nibbled on the edge.
“They left. With the number of Dark artifacts they left with, they won’t be coming back.” Draco stood and pulled Harry to his feet. “You need to eat. You didn’t get any breakfast this morning. And don’t try to lie about it. I’ll buy you an early lunch.”
“Making that noise and being here when you’re supposed to be with the other weirdos like you!” he said in a harsh whisper.
Harry snorted. “Even your mum’s informal letters are posh,” he said as he handed the letter back to Draco.
“BOY!!! GET OVER HERE!!!” Harry slowly turned and walked over cautiously. “What have you done to my son?”
“I don’t want you to hurt. Maybe we could talk to the Headmaster. He could change our schedules so we have more classes together,” Harry suggested.
Draco woke up just as the sun streamed through their windows. He opened his eyes and saw Harry had moved to lay on Draco’s chest in the night. He was wearing Draco’s new sweater as Draco was bare-chested.
As they flew, Harry stayed close to the end of Tonks’s broom. Draco flew on his right side, still moodily avoiding eye contact. They flew for hours, occasionally flying higher or taking a detour around large cities to avoid being spotted. Halfway through the flight, Harry felt frozen. His clothing was damp from a cloud they flew through and his teeth were chattering. Draco was shaking too, his arms wrapped around himself. Harry wanted to hold his hand but Draco still wasn’t looking at him.
“Draco,” he breathed reverently. Draco began thrusting in and out of him. As he found a rhythm, Harry matched his tempo by thrusting down when he thrust up. His head tilted back in ecstasy and the Veela took the opportunity to ravish the skin there.
“Come on, he’s just a punk anyways.” Dudley turned and walked towards the exit of the park and his gang hurried after him. They didn’t want trouble with
Harry sat on tiredly on the bed beside Draco. “Okay, now spill, what’s bothering you?” Draco sighed and sat up.
“Then I want you to claim me.” His head swam with pleasure, and the idea of Draco owning him seemed so right somehow. Normally, he didn’t like the idea of being someone’s property, but this was different. He wasn’t property, it was a symbol of Draco’s love etched into his skin.
A raspy voice came from within the bundle. "Kill the spare." A bolt of green light filled the air and Cedric fell dead to the ground.
“I know you are. Why would perfect Potter ever have time to learn potions? He’s too busy being famous!” Draco teased. “Of course I’ll help you with it. Get out your textbook and come over here.” They moved back into the common room and Draco sat on the couch by the fire. Harry sat on the couch next to Draco and pulled his book bag closer to them. He pulled out his already battered copy of Picquery Book of Potions and Poisons. He set his parchment and quill down and looked at Draco.
“Yes, Mr. Weasley. Hurry, we don’t have all day!” Ron scurried down to the floor where Professor McGonagall stood. “Now, to properly waltz one must have proper hand placement. Mr. Weasley, place your hand on my waist.”
“I’m fine.” Draco turned his head to meet Harry’s eyes. sighed and freed his wrist from Harry’s grip so he could hold his hand.
Harry looked around to see if he could find something to cut the rope holding Draco down. He found a sharp rock at the base of the statue and began cutting the rope when he noticed it wasn't rope at all. It was thick twistings of kelp. When Draco was free, he tried to cut the kelp off the little girl. One of the merpeople blocked his way with a trident. The merman had a golden breastplate over his green-blue skin. The middle point of the trident pressed against his neck sharply, startling Harry into backing up. “
“Nonsense, your lot aren’t on our news!” Uncle Vernon said in a voice that was definitely not a whisper.
Dumbledore clapped his hands to gain everyone’s attention. The next paper flew from the Goblet and he caught it. A hush fell over the room. He unfolded it and paused. “The Hogwarts Champion” a dramatic pause, “for the Triwizard Tournament will be,” another pause, “Cedric Diggory!” The entire Hufflepuff table stood and cheered. Cedric grinned and walked to the front. The Headmaster clapped again and silence fell. “Keep in mind, the challenges these students will face, are life and death. Do not think for a moment—” Suddenly the goblet flared to life again. Another piece of parchment flew from the cup. He snatched it from the air and slowly unfolded it. Draco clutched Harry close uncertainly.
have fed your fame over the years. Shall I explain what really happened that night, thirteen years ago?" Harry struggled harder against his binds. Voldemort cackled again. "It was love. When Lily Potter died for you on that night, she gave you protection. I could not touch you. But that was old magic. However, things have changed. I can touch you now." He demonstrated by pressing a nasty finger to Harry's scar.
“Ah, Bartemius. I need to go over the Magical Contract with you. Harry and Mr. Malfoy are both in danger. Professor Snape, can you write to Mr. Malfoy’s parents? I need them to know what’s going on.” Dumbledore took Mr. Crouch into his office while Draco and Harry stood speechless. The Champions and their Headmasters, (Minus Cedric, who stood with Professor Sprout) talked anxiously about what was going on and if they would continue holding the Triwizard Tournament at all. Snape walked in after half an hour and over to Draco.
“Disillusionment Charm. Lupin says you have an Invisibility Cloak, but that’ll fly off when we’re in the air.”
my Veela. I don’t want anyone else.” Draco relaxed and a large smile spread on his face. He kissed Harry and they set out to the Great Hall.
Draco sat in the corner of the library where they had met earlier. He had his nose buried in a book and scraps of parchment with notes scattered around him. Harry snuck up behind him and planted a kiss behind his ear.
“Wait, I was in regular Potions before this. I’m not even good at that!” Draco sat on the bed next to him and wrapped an arm around his shoulders.
“Yes, I did. He would have kept coming back and coming back if I didn’t.” Harry frowned. He knew Draco was right, but he didn’t want to admit it. Draco kissed him again, soft and sweet. He pulled away a fraction of an inch and with his lips still brushing Harry’s he murmured, “You’re coming to stay with me at the Manor tonight.” Harry pulled away to look Draco in the eyes.
me.” Harry laughed. The red faded from Draco’s cheeks and he pinched Harry’s arm. Harry playfully swatted his hand away. They walked under a plexiglass awning where tickets were being sold and waited in line to pay. “I’m paying. This was my idea and you have no more cash on you after the turny-things.” Harry sighed. He was right.
This is the first fanfiction I ever wrote. It's still a work-in-progress, and I started it on January 26, 2018. I've been working on it for over a year. As I wrote more and more, I became a better writer. The beginning isn't the best, and I have improved a lot over time. I've developed my own writing style, one that I'm proud of. Please don't be so harsh on these first few. I was young and I was just doing what I loved. I'm really emotionally attached to these characters (who wouldn't be, I lived and breathed them for over a year!) So I hope you enjoy, I'm not finished with this, even on Fanfiction, so I'll be posting one chapter every Saturday (I'll be posting more than that this weekend, the beginning chapters are very short) until this is caught up to Fanfiction. If you don't want to wait, you can find my Fanfiction account
"I'm so sorry, love," Draco murmured. "I'll protect you, I promise. I won't let him hurt you." He buried his face in Harry's neck. Harry buried his fingers in his fine blond hair. He felt Draco's teeth puncture his skin, but it wasn't painful. It never was. Draco latched on and didn't let go. He felt the Veela magic coursing through the wound, but it was calming instead of orgasm inducing. Harry closed his eyes and let the magic calm him. They stayed that way for a long time. Draco didn't let go until Harry was nearly asleep. He drew back and licked the newly forming Mark. Harry's dark skin knit itself together, revealing the brightest Mark he had ever made. It shined silver as if it was lit from within. It reminded Draco of their Soulmate sparks.
“If we throw him out, the neighbors will talk. They’ll want to know where he’s gone,” she snapped, seemingly back to her regular self, if not shakier and paler. She turned to Harry. “You’re to stay in your room. You’re not to leave the house. Now go to bed.” Her eyes suddenly fell on Draco, then darted to Harry’s neck, and back to Draco.
How was Harry going to react at Draco being a Veela? If he rejected him, Draco would die within a matter of weeks. Being Soulmates with a Veela also meant being a Mate. A Mates’ connection is both physical and emotional. A Dominant Veela can feel the pain of their Submissive, and they can sense their emotions.
“I’m glad you’re here,” he murmured. Draco pressed a kiss to his hair in response. Harry’s breaths steadied as he fell asleep. Draco stayed awake. The adrenaline that was pulsing through his veins was slowly fading. He pet Harry’s hair quietly, watching the rise and fall of his back as he breathed. He listened as the house grew silent as the Dursleys went to bed for the night. He heard the loud snores from Dudley’s room and cast a silencing charm with the flick of his wrist, followed by a locking charm as an afterthought.
“How do you think we’d fit a blow-job in if we woke up any later? We both need a shower now.” He stripped shamelessly and headed for the bathroom. “Care to join me?”
“I’m not sure I want to. You look awfully smug. It might be a trick from those Weasley twins for all I know,” Draco drawled again. Harry slapped his knee affectionately. Draco opened the box slowly. When he saw the silver ring resting in the silk bedding, he gasped sharply.
Harry stood on the edge of the dock. Neville had given him the ball of gillyweed a few minutes ago, and he was waiting for the cannon to fire. Moody stood next to him, and Neville stood on the other side. “Remember, just keep moving down. Make sure you move fast. You never know what creatures are going to pick a fight.” Harry nodded. He was still wondering where Draco was when he glanced down at his wrist where the silver sparks glowed. They trailed into the water and disappeared into the murky depths. He glanced at Cedric’s and then Viktor’s wrists as well. Each string of sparks led into the murky depths. Fleur was the only one with a bare arm.
“I love you too.” Harry pulled away and dug through his trunk for some parchment and a quill. He soon gave up after finding he had no ink and all of his parchment was either used or torn beyond repair. He sighed and walked over to the minuscule desk in the corner. He opened one of the drawers and pulled out a Muggle spiral notebook and a pen. He sat on the bed and started writing a letter. Draco sat next to him and inspected the paper.
Draco glared at the group and spoke. “If I were you, I’d walk away before someone gets hurt.” His voice was cold. Dudley took a step back in shock but quickly recovered. He took three steps forward and made what was supposed to be an intimidating face. It only made him look constipated.
Draco reached over to the end table beside the bed. “Here.” He slipped the glasses onto Harry’s nose for him.
"Dray, I'm not that hungry." Draco frowned and cupped Harry's cheek, turning his head gently to face him. Harry looked down at his lap.
“Trying to undress me, are you Malfoy?” Harry slurred. He was going to have a massive hangover. “I thought you would wait until we got to the room. You clearly have no restraint.” Draco sighed. He pulled his Mate upright and removed his shirt, then gently lay him back on the silk sheets. He unbuckled his belt and undid his trousers. After some effort, he successfully undressed Harry and himself. Draco hefted him completely onto the bed, lay down next to him and covered them both. He laid his wings out behind them. Harry instantly rolled closer to him and Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s tan waist. Harry buried his face in Draco’s chest. His breathing finally evened out and Draco watched him quietly. He stroked his cheeks with his soft white feathers.
Malfoy wrinkled his nose as if he had just smelt something terrible. “Words like that are just uncalled for, Potter. If this was a real game, Hooch would be flagging you for unsportsmanlike behavior.”
Draco nodded slowly. Warmth filled his chest. It was not anger, and it was not desire. It was something that had once been foreign to Draco, and yet, now, he could identify it as clear as day. “You’re right.” Zabini’s face brightened. Draco went on. “Now I have actual friends who care about me, even the Gryffindors.”
Malfoy shook his head with disdain, holding the door open for Harry to enter. "Still such a people pleaser, Potter."
“Hm?” He looked a bit dazed, his gaze flickering around behind him before he finally turned to his friends. “Oh, no. I guess they were out of stock of the one I was  looking for.”
Of course, he hadn't been expecting to be alone. Things had gotten rough between him and Ginny after her brother's death. It was understandable. Harry could still feel a pang in his chest when he went past the darkened storefront of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Not to mention she still had two years left at Hogwarts, and long-distance just hadn't been working for them - it did make things awkward when he visited the Burrow, though.
Malfoy opened his mouth and then closed it again before frowning. “I guess not entirely.” He licked his lips then sat up very straight in the way he did when trying not to appear uncomfortable. “I’m sorry for the way I treated you when I was younger. It was immature and insensitive.”
"You know, some Arnica would fix that right up for you," said Neville, who had just gotten back to his desk.
There was one second of absolute silence. The girls were glancing at each other, entirely confused. Harry could only hear ringing in his ears. Then he was on his feet. One hand snapped around Malfoy’s wrist, and he dragged him up.
Malfoy glared at the clear shock on his face, crossing his arms. "I'll stay here if you're going to make a big deal about it."
When it became apparent that Ron wouldn’t interrupt, Hermione spoke again. “Really, Harry, we don’t mind having you over.” She grasped his arm as if trying to pull him into compliance. “It’s been so long. It can be just like old times.”
Harry nodded. "Yeah, definitely. Maybe, er, just give me a few days' notice, yeah? I should get going before the Floo queue gets too long. Tell 'Mione I said hi."
Bad news came when Harry went back to the hospital for his checkup on Tuesday. Healer Sow was professional enough not to mention Draco’s absence, but he had the uncanny feeling that she was terser with him than usual. She also most certainly did not restrain from giving him a piece of her mind when she found out that he had returned to work despite her warnings. To his dismay, she ordered him to stay home for the rest of the week and stay off his feet if he wanted to get back onto the field anytime soon.
Draco shrugged. “Maybe both. I’ll throw in Pansy so she can write a nice piece on the madness of Harry Potter for the Prophet too.”
“Most of my dreams are about the fire,” Malfoy broke the silence. Harry’s head snapped up. Malfoy’s gaze was still locked on the twisting glow. “I truly thought I was going to die at that moment.”
The unfamiliar sound of his own name finally appeared to pull Harry free of his thoughts. His eyes snapped up to meet Malfoy’s. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to– I did it to you, too.”
It began to stir him even more. However, when he pulled away for a momentary breath, he saw Draco’s face crumple up. “Your breath is horrid.”
The night he had attempted to pull the sword of Gryffindor from the bottom of that icy pool flooded his mind. His throat began to constrict in memory of the chain closing around it. He remembered how his body involuntarily tried to force air back into his body, but only water tunneled in. Thrashing, suffocating, and scrabbling at the strangled chain with frozen fingers.
Harry was still smiling, finally getting the last of the buttons at his neck. “Just let me know when you’ve made up your mind for me.”
Her eyes pinched for a second as the end of her distant thoughts came into sight before she returned to the present. She dropped her hand from her necklace. “If I am honest, I don’t think he should be looking for either of our approval anymore. I would prefer that he approve of himself.” She surveyed the doorway which Draco had vanished through. “I fear that he never did before.”
Hermione somehow managed to coax Ron back into Harry’s room, but he remained silent in the corner ― lent against the wall with his arms crossed as he stared with a permanent glare out the window. There was still some hesitation in the woman, but she came to Harry’s bedside nonetheless. She was updating him on her newest attempts to gain wages for house-elves when the door opened again.
A disquieting bout of embarrassment fell over him suddenly. “Actually, I don’t have an owl.” He scrubbed the back of his neck. “I don’t have much reason to keep in touch with the wizarding world,” he gestured to the white-walled flat, “and no pets allowed here.”
It was no surprise that Ron was eager to go back to spending nights with Hermione—he had woke up almost every night at the Burrow. What
Nothing on Draco’s face looked convinced. He was better at seeing through Harry than he could have ever imagined. Nevertheless, the lie that Harry was holding back was not entirely understood by himself yet. He couldn’t risk scaring him away.
She twisted around in a flurry. The shock on her face faded quickly. “Oh, it’s just you guys.” She sighed and picked up her mug. “I thought my mum followed me again.”
It wasn’t unusual for Harry to grow stiff suddenly. He was still trying to be less paranoid outside of work. Draco’s presence always helped. When he saw no one watching them other than an unhappy elderly couple on the front terrace of a restaurant across the street, he sighed and shook his head. While their skin was fairly wrinkled and pale, neither were Voldemort coming back to kill him. He turned back to Draco. “I’m fine.”
Draco had been humbled that day. Not only had Potter managed to take his wand, but he’d taken down many of the monsters that plagued the walls of Malfoy Manor in one fell swoop. From his mad aunt, Bellatrix, to the werewolf, Greyback, Potter had outmaneuvered them all. There was no longer anything in him that could deny that the trio was a force to be reckoned with. That was exactly why he wanted to stay off their radar.
Harry’s coughed out the last of his laughter. He took a sip from his own drink to sooth his throat as he nodded. “Go ahead.”
Harry narrowed his eyes, his own words coming out just as quickly without filter. “Why are you defending him after he kicked you out here to shag some girl in your room?”
She rolled her eyes. “Please, not even the Auror Office can hide blatant murders like that from the Daily Prophet. It’s better for my image that I stay away from that type of stuff, but it is causing quite the stir on the floor.”
A long sigh left Harry's lips, and he finally tore his gaze away from his papers to look at Draco. "You aren't a dark wizard, Draco."
“Yeah, well,” Ron plopped down on the old, faux leather sofa and began to tug off his boots, “he better lose our number. Harry left him.”
Harry didn’t meet either of their eyes, beginning to pick at the rough complementary blanket laid on his lap. “I wasn’t planning on going to Grimmauld.”
Currently, the whole room was going over various ridiculous ways the pair had tried to tear each other down. In hindsight, stealing Remembralls and challenging to midnight duels were not the most mature acts. The accusations didn’t bother them. In fact, Harry almost thought fondly about the memories. When they had once been so naive. When all that mattered to either was what the other thought of them. He supposed some things hadn’t changed. Harry certainly still wondered what Draco thought of him, but perhaps his intentions now were less pure. Granted, how pure could wanting to kill each other really be?
The beautiful features twisted with unjust indignity. Draco gritted his teeth. He twisted and kicked, struggling to sway the balance. In a swift motion, he rolled until Harry was beneath him. His hands moved with the nimbleness of a seeker, stealing Harry’s wrists the moment his own were knocked loose.
Harry shrugged. “I have a little at Grimmauld every once in a while, but it’s never much. I just haven’t felt the urge to lately. I told them it was ridiculous.”
Heather’s face became as red as the scrunch she used to pull back her curls today. Draco and Harry shared a look before turning to the pair of girls again.
Only when Harry levered his eyelids open and saw bright white instead of cozy browns and reds did he begin to think harder. He slowly sat up, rubbing at his eyes as he patted around himself for his glasses.
Still, it was better for them this way. At least he didn't have the same problems as many other Aurors who had to go home to their significant others and couldn't tell them anything that was going on at work – and their job was certainly the type to follow one home.
Harry gave two sharp knocks to the door of the Head Auror office. His body was buzzing. He had thought about this all night after he got home just a little before midnight.
Malfoy’s smile had grown wider and wider, and Harry couldn’t help but match it. There was a pause as Malfoy seemed to be considering something. “I– I also told her about you.” He looked up, measuring.
He snapped his head back, his brow still furrowed. “He’s clearly okay,” he gestured to where Harry was sitting up in the cot, “and he has his new mate to keep him company. We aren’t needed anymore.”
That wasn’t how it was anymore though. Lucius was in Azkaban and Draco was alone. His and his mother’s safety in this new world was up to him now. If they were ever going to move forward, he would have to swallow his pride—and what a big pill to swallow that was.
Harry stopped dead in his tracks. Of all the people he might have guessed that would show up at his office, Lucius Malfoy was not near the top. However here he was, being pushed away from the Auror office doors by two men from Magical Law Enforcement Patrol.
Draco frowned, his hand moving slowly from his face. "Are you saying there are no baby pictures of you?"
Eventually, people began to go off to bed in pairs—some roommates and others not. Draco was the one to decide for them. Some sort of commentary had been tagged onto their departure, but Harry didn’t hear it, simply following the arm looped around his own and pulling him up the stairs.
Harry opened his mouth to comment but she went on. “Besides, I have a feeling not that many people know about that there.” She gestured at the men’s intertwined fingers. “Apparently I’m not the only one not keeping everyone up to date on their relationship?” She narrowed her eyes accusingly at Draco.
Harry sighed. This was no time for deep reflections about his previous schoolyard nemesis. He only had a few more hours of sleep to hold onto before he had to be up for class. He dropped down into his own bed and sleep soon drew him in.
Hermione’s head swiveled around the room. “Where is he?” She looked to Harry with sudden alarm. “He is here, right? You two didn’t break up over this?” She appeared genuinely concerned and it warmed Harry’s heart.
Harry felt a weight he had not noticed before lift off his chest at the easy first question. “My father’s invisibility cloak.”
Heather had more empathy. When Pansy frowned at the pair, Heather pointed to her upper lip. Pansy copied the gesture before her face became as red as her lips, and she began to fervently clean off her face without ruining her makeup.
"This has to be Macnair. I wouldn't put it past him to kill like this. He loved it," Draco went on, returning sharply to the original direction of the conversation. "He knows how to cut, too. He used to dispose of bodies at the manor. Not well though, that's why it's a mess. He was an executioner of creatures for the ministry. He only knew vague anatomy."
Draco admitted that he was fairly doted on and, if one really insisted, possibly even spoiled. He never felt it though. The objects he was given had always been a hollow apology for the time his father rarely wanted to spend with him. The only quality time he could recall spending with his father was when he complained about Dumbledore or people in the ministry, or when he spoke to him of the grandeur that the Dark Lord had once promised them and had been taken away. Otherwise, his company had been house-elves and his mother and Alice in Wonderland.
Harry stopped pacing and stared at her for a long moment. He didn’t know why it was so jarring to hear. Maybe because he never considered himself a victim, it was merely unfavorable things that happened to him, but he always managed them, so it didn’t seem like a big deal.
The crooked smile on Harry's face stirred something in Malfoy. He snapped his head forward and glared his frustration into the fireplace. "You can do whatever, but I'm not sharing a bed with you. I like to stretch."
“Yeah, we’ve all dealt with worse,” Ron spoke up. “Hell, you were there half the time when we did – granted you usually caused the trouble,” he added but the glint in his eye made it clear he was teasing.
All possible responses had vanished from Harry's mind. He stared at Malfoy, whose eyes were on the moldy walls of the hallway as if what he'd said was casual. Harry's thoughts pulled up memories of Uncle Vernon screaming at him for ironing his shirt wrong or overcooking dinner, and he wondered what Lucius Malfoy would scold his son for. Maybe he and Malfoy's upbringings weren't as different as he originally figured.
Ron chuckled. “Of course, mate.” He thumped a hand on his back as he started forward to resume their route. “Just please keep the snogging to a minimum.” His comment earned a shove but it was followed closely by laughter from both men.
Draco could hear his heart pounding in his ears. He nodded and was only confident enough to muster a muddled, “Okay,” before closing the door and being on his way. He knew he couldn’t actually turn back, though. He had committed to this. He would do it.
“I’ll go talk to him,” Hermione said. She started towards the door and was halfway out when she paused. She looked back at Harry. Her brow was furrowed, and her mouth hung open, but she appeared to quickly reconsider her thoughts and darted out of the room after her boyfriend.
Draco fed them another response and kept up the banter, but he couldn’t stop thinking about the first part of the letter.
“For an Auror, it is,” he snapped. “There’s been an attack in Winchester. If they don’t find who it is, they could strike again. They need help in the office.”
“Well,” she looked at the clock, “it will be in about fifteen minutes.” She watched as both young men became incredibly deflated. “You know, the definition of family can be very grey… I overheard someone saying you two live together, is that right?”
Pansy had left about an hour ago. She’d been reluctant to go before Harry got back, but Draco knew she had work in the morning. She at least promised to stop by her office and peek in to see if Harry was back yet. He hoped that no news was good news. Harry was probably on his way home at that moment, and she didn’t feel the need to message him.
Truthfully, he did not want to let go either. He messed with Draco’s hair a lot, but he rarely got to properly appreciate just how soft it was, his fingers gliding through it like white silk. Not to mention the feeling of a chest against his own, the faint movement of his even breath that he unintentionally began to copy, and the secure arms wrapped around his torso. Separating didn’t sound all that great.
Taking the day off was the most he had planned for the day and it seemed like a sizable gift to himself. A lazy day with Draco sounded great. It wasn’t much unlike how they’d spent Draco’s birthday.
Why did he care? It was Malfoy, after all. Who cares if he starved himself? Harry had cleared his debt with the Malfoy family by keeping them from Azkaban; what they did with that freedom was up to them. If Malfoy wanted to become a recluse, he was welcome to it.
Harry leaned forward, and for a moment, Draco thought he was going to kiss him. He didn’t lift his head, though. Instead, he tucked his face into the crook of Draco’s neck. It was an oddly familiar sensation. It reminded Draco of that day once again, when they embraced in the corridor upstairs, the first time Harry ever let someone comfort him.
There were all types of people who walked in and out of that place. Big. Small. Old. Young. Very few of them actually fit the flamboyant picture that popped in his head when he thought of a gay man. They all just looked like regular guys.
This harsh emotion seemed to make more sense to Malfoy, and he relaxed. “He’s the one who hinted to McGonagall that she should do a room check. He told me last night after she left.”
charm. While creating water sounded like a simple task, it was actually very complex, requiring elements of Transfiguration to conjure water out of thin air.
There might not have been much of a change between them, even after their minor scuffle; but, that same night, they had once again crossed paths.
Harry’s heart jolted when he looked back at the wide-eyed stare, but it faded under the pale gaze. “Yes, and to be perfectly honest, a part of me was hoping it would work for me, too. I thought you would put down some of your walls. I never realized I was the one who still had them up. I shouldn’t have done that to you.”
The blonde turned away and started up the next set of stairs, continuing on to Charms and thinking he was leaving a flustered Potter in his wake.
Harry stomped away. He only went a few doors down before looking back again. He hoped once he was out of view, Malfoy would come out. For a moment, it looked like it would work. The handle clearly moved, but there was a pause and bounced back to its original position.
Work wasn’t going too bad for Harry either. He was getting reprimanded far less at the very least. Robards even praised him one day for getting reports in more regularly though this was only because Harry desperately wanted to go home now.
Despite Robards’ attempts to keep Harry within the Auror Office, it was a busy day with several high profile cases sending people out into the field, and thus no one else was around when a disturbance in Knockturn Alley was called in.
Draco’s gaze snapped to the man. He appeared utterly betrayed. Harry felt remorse only for a moment before Pansy suddenly lit up. “He did!”
"It tastes better with Oolong," Malfoy explained. "Or, that's the way my mum always made it." He gestured to a yellow tin on the counter with Chinese script. "She just sent me some more the other day."
“Where are you going?” Teddy called from behind him, pulling out from among Ron and Hermione. “Can I come with? I just got here.”
For Pansy being so against coming to the muggle café, she was incredibly reluctant to leave. When they finally got her out, they went back to the flat. It was decided that they’d play a three-person game of exploding snap ― a dangerous proposition since it only added to the chances of cards exploding, but it also added to the excitement.
They both watched her return to the counter. Once she was out of hearing range, Draco leaned over the table to whisper haughtily, "Why'd you say that?"
Ron’s eyes bulged. “He’s done a lot wrong, Harry, and for some reason, I keep thinking I’ll walk in here, and you’ll remember that, but it seems like Carrow hit you in the head pretty hard, too.” He shook his head, already beginning to retrace his steps towards the door. “I knew I shouldn’t have come here today. Call me when you’ve got your sanity back. I’ll be in the office, ‘Mione,” he added gruffly before disappearing out the door.
Hermione frowned. “Skeres?” She got off the ground, dusting herself off before sitting down next to Ron. “Terry Skeres?”
He’d never really considered being a father. He took to his responsibilities with Teddy naturally but he never considered that parenting. He could always hand him back to Andromeda whenever he wanted. He wasn’t sure if he’d even be good at it. It wasn’t as if he had any good examples. He didn’t consider Vernon Dursley a good example for a second. Faces like Dumbledore, Arthur, and Hagrid popped into his head but none sat quite right. Sirius was the closest he’d ever gotten to a father but that had been fleeting.
"An inquiry isn't going to do anything," Harry argued. "Someone in the ministry is giving out private information, information that is causing harm. Doesn't that qualify for a little more concern?"
Deciding it wasn’t his place to ask, Harry tugged on his jacket and started towards the fireplace. Just as he was going to grab a fistful of Floo powder, she spoke up, “Harry?”
His brain was liquor drenched. It became absolutely traitorous. It didn’t even bother to alarm him when he plopped down on the side of Malfoy’s bed.
McGonagall’s expression remained cool. He was still restraining his laughter as his mind worked out her words. “Excuse me?”
Upon entering Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, Harry was greeted with familiar colors and bangs and pops all around. There was so much to look at that no one paid the owner or Harry Potter any mind as they made their way through. George paused at a display of Bombtastic Bombs to inform the group of kids eyeing them that they currently had a back to school sale.
“A room tells a lot about a person. For example, Ron’s is orange and covered in Chudly Canon merchandise.”
Hermione managed to shut her mouth, but her eyes were still relatively large. Ron’s shoulders loosened.
No wonder he looked so pale and thin. There was a balcony on the other side of the wall-length windows, but the dirty lounge chairs and overgrown plant pot made it clear that Malfoy didn't spend any time out there either. For two months, at the very least, Malfoy had kept himself locked up in this one-bedroom apartment without even the knowledge of how to work the stove.
“Not today,” Draco said as he always did. Harry took this as answer enough and started to leave. “But could we do something else?”
Seeming to take into account the awkward air between the adults, Teddy began to tug on Draco’s sleeve. “Come look for gnome’s with me.”
Zabini met his eyes. Where there was lightning in the blonde’s gaze, there was solid earth in Zabini’s. It only conducted Draco’s rage, feeding it with his honesty. “I’m not.”
It wasn’t long before no one could muster out another grueling account. Lighter tales began to blossom and prosper. There was never any truly joyful moments to recall, but they did talk about their minor wins, the way the professors were silently supporting them, how the ghost and portraits had aided in reconnaissance. There had been a lot of turmoil, but they had overcome all of it in leaps and bounds.
"Yeah, but what if you have more than one person over? And honestly," Harry gave the flat one last skimming glance, "I never really pegged you as a minimalist. You've always, you know, liked your
“Oh, Harry, perfect timing,” Andromeda’s voice rang before Harry had even gotten all of the soot off of his face. “Ron and Hermione just got here. They’re in the kitchen setting up the cake.”
Literally all of my plans for this year have been ruined but goddamn I'm getting a lot of writing done. Hope everyone's staying safe. Thank you all for reading!
They kissed goodbye. It wasn’t the light, chaste kiss they usually left each other with. It held the same determination as the one from the night before, both trying to urge some strength into one another.
The two girls ran off upstairs, but Harry was still watching his friends. They were both still frowning, though now having one of their silent conversations. It was only the little huff beside him that made him look away. “You owe me, Potter.”
Harry’s nerves were beginning to grow raw. Really, if he had any idea of how annoying it was when someone kept stuff bottled up, he would have never done it to Ron and Hermione for so long. “Then it won’t be a big deal after you tell me either.”
“You served the Black family first,” Malfoy snapped. “Technically, I’m a Black. You have to listen to me.”
Ron nodded at this, and it appeared he’d been appeased until his eyes narrowed. “You didn’t fancy any of my other siblings, right?”
Draco abruptly sat up. Harry’s body loosened beneath him. It wasn’t relief; that’s not what he saw in his eyes. It was only disappointment and a small pinch of hurt.
Harry took another tentative step forward. “Draco, I don’t blame you. I don’t know exactly what happened but it wasn’t all your fault. You were a child. Despite what anyone’s told you, strangers or your father,” Draco’s hard eyes snapped up, “you couldn’t have done much to change any of this. What you did do was try to helped people and I don’t see that as any reason to persecute yourself.”
The ire in Harry’s eyes subsided.  “Okay, good point.” He’d been only addressing the second part, hastily scurrying around the first. “Come on, Malfoy. It’s not raining and it’s going to start getting cold soon. I need to get out of this stuffy castle and Ron’s off with Hermione today.”
Air fell out shakily from Malfoy’s mouth. He tried to speak, but the connections in his brain could not be made. The only functional part of him was the rush of blood to his face.
“Of course, that’s what you’d care about,” Harry muttered. Instead of dwelling on the topic, he decided to address a different issue. “What about sleeping in the same bed?”
He was headed down to the kitchen, but his eyes caught sight of a room on the first floor. He edged nearer, slowly pushing the door aside. This room looked most like it would belong to someone in his family. It was well past its prime, but there was lingering proof that it was once exquisite, with large windows overlooking the street and a grand fireplace flanked by two ornate glass-fronted cabinets.
After the scores were announced and the crowd walked back up to the castle, Draco took Harry to the room. He set the black haired boy on the bed and kissed him tenderly. “I love you so much,” he murmured in between kisses. Draco moved slowly, knowing they had all the time in the world, but Harry was eager to be with Draco again.
“I thought you knew I was awake,” Harry countered. “But sleep now, talk tomorrow.” Not five minutes later, Harry’s soft snores filled Draco’s ears. Harry didn’t snore often, but Draco thought it was the cutest sound on earth. It was quite peaceful and so quiet you had to listen for it. He sighed and fell asleep.
“You are going to be the end of me,” Draco muttered. He returned the favor to Harry, drawing it out and making it as pleasurable as possible until Harry was writhing under him. After Harry came, he cast a cleaning charm and they regained their breath. Draco stood and stretched. “Let’s go eat.” Harry nodded and opened his Hogwarts trunk, pulling out a Muggle wallet.
“After we eat, do you want to go outside? I want to see if it snowed.” Harry nodded and stretched. Draco’s eyes wandered to the tan skin of his stomach, and he quickly looked away. He knew every inch of Harry’s skin like the back of his hand, but it was too tempting to look at the goods when he wasn’t getting any. He didn’t want to pressure Harry into anything. Draco got out of bed and began dressing. He threw some clothes to Harry and he put them on.
“Shh! I think that beetle is an Animagus!” Draco followed far behind so it couldn’t spot them. It landed under the stands and morphed into Rita Skeeter. Draco hid behind a tent as the reporter took notes about what she saw. Harry gasped, but Draco covered his mouth. With Harry still on his back, Draco walked back to the tent and over to Dumbledore who finished his Ward-check. He set Harry down and pulled him over to the wizened old man.
“Sirius. I told him that if someone didn’t come to take you somewhere safe, I’d take matters into my own hands.” Harry sighed.
“I don’t want you to be mean to Ron or Hermione. They won’t accept you if you are, and I want to be with you.”
“I put them in there and put a scoop of the soap in, then I start it, but it’s a bit noisy and I don’t want to wake anyone up. Draco nodded and smiled to himself. He pointed his wand at the first pile of clothes and levitated them into the washer. Harry put in the soap and started it after Draco cast a Silencing Charm.
“I just wish I could have stopped them. I wish I had been there for you.” Harry sat up straighter and glared at him.
“Fine. One time, my uncle hit me so hard my arm broke. There, can I go to sleep now?” Draco’s hand stopped moving.
Draco watched as the pig-on-legs devoured his quarter and eyed Harry's greedily. Harry ate the quarter and left the table. No one looked up, they continued the conversation without halt, as if he had never been there. For some reason, Harry tensed and sped up when he walked down the hall. There was nothing in it except an old cupboard under the stairs. Maybe Harry had a fear of spiders or something. Draco quietly climbed the steps after Harry, avoiding the bottom one because he heard it creak when Harry went up. He slipped inside before Harry closed the door and tore the cloak off angrily.
Harry managed to form the sentence, “My God! Your mouth should be illegal!” Draco bobbed faster, holding Harry’s bucking hips down. He didn’t break eye contact once. After an embarrassingly short few moments, his mouth was filled with hot come. “Draco!!!” Harry moaned as he reached his climax. When he saw the pink flush that tinged Harry’s cheeks, the glazed green eyes that watched him in adoration, and the sheen of sweat that covered Harry’s face, Draco came quickly. He cast a wandless spell and the mess disappeared.
“Thanks, Harry. You’re the best uncle ever.” Harry turned to Draco and Andromeda, who were having a conversation about where Teddy got her dress. Apparently, Draco wanted to get a dress for Lily as a birthday present. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry spotted Ron’s Aunt Muriel walked over to greet them. He withheld a sigh.
“What’ll it be this time?” Harry said softly, gently. He did this just to annoy Draco, piss him off; Draco wanted, no, needed, Harry to be rough with him almost always. “Should I take it slow?”
“Yes,” Draco panted. “I have been, but you insisted upon torturing me, you…” Whatever name Draco was going to call Harry died in his throat, however, because Harry,  who was using every ounce of his self control to keep himself from fucking into Draco’s warm body hard and fast, had lined himself up with his entrance. Draco made a choked noise as Harry pushed the tip inside of him.
Draco felt the explosion all the way from his bed chambers, on the opposite end of the monstrous castle. He sat up on bed, startled and rubbed his sore eyes. Like a pathetic child, he’d been crying all day; his pillow was damp with tears. Racing thoughts of  what his life would be like without Potter, how it’d return to normal and how he’d be alone again, did not cease even in his dreams. Images of Potter’s stupid, crooked smile seemed to be burned into the back of his eyelids. Would he ever see it again? He’d pleaded endlessly with his father to no avail. At one point, he’d even dropped to his knees and begged. Narcissa had taken his side, imploring Lucius to let the boy go and allow her son to be happy, to be loved; to no avail. Draco had never hated his father more than when he turned his back to them, face carved from marble.
“Because I have class, unlike y--”  But Draco failed to finish his sentence, choking out a moan when Harry repositioned his hips to line up perfectly with Draco’s once again. He leaned down, capturing Draco’s open mouth in a dirty kiss that was all tongue, and then pulled away only to whisper:
Harry woke up still dressed in his fancy clothes, which were now squashed and wrinkled in awkward places. When did I fall asleep? He thought as he yawned and threaded his fingers through his tangled mop of hair.
And then Harry realized that Draco’s robes were a familiar shade of white, and suddenly he began to laugh. He laughed, and laughed, eyes clouded with tears, and when he took in the appalled look on Draco’s face, he only laughed harder.
“Pan,” She called to her friend, who jogged over to her in an attempt to catch up. “You didn’t bother with the Herbology homework did you? Such an incompetent Professor,” She snorted, flicking her hair over her shoulder.  “Who has a name like Sprout? Ridiculous, if you ask me. Father tells me she dropped out of Auror training. Pitiful, isn’t it?”
“They’re untitled books. I’ve taken it upon myself to come up with fitting titles of my own and redo the binding. Ronald offered to help me, but I’ve found him to be quite lazy. We’re making very little progress.”
Draco held up a decadent hand, silver nails glinting in the moonlight.”I came to find you, Potter. And call me Draco,” his voice wavered slightly. “Please.” Draco cringed inwardly at how pathetic he sounded, how desperate.
“You’re not bad looking, Harry,” Hermione said sweetly. “And you’re sweet.” Harry blushed further at her compliment.
“Oh?” ‘Mione chimed in, his voice teasingly sly. “Harriet, even I can see that you two are...spending time together. Don't worry, Harriet. I know she doesn't mean anything she says."
“I said,” Potter flipped onto his side and faced Draco. “D’you think we’ll catch them? The Carrows?”
“Your Prince, Dursley.I suggest you show me more respect, or my Father will hear about this.” Draco said, wrinkling his nose in disgust.
“Why did I marry an imbecile?” Draco asked the sky, exasperated. Scorpius glared at him, tilting his pointed face upwards at his other father.
Harry snorted and gave Blondie a once-over. He was lanky, dressed in white robes and shiny black shoes. Judging by his golden jewelry and silk cloak, this guy was probably the farthest thing from poor. Harry, if not for being completely disgusted by this pretentious dick, would have called him handsome. His cheekbones sat high on his pale face, accenting his thin nose and sunken, stormy eyes.
Draco clung to him, body taut with pleasure, as Harry continued fucking into him with increasing speed. Draco was making obscene noises with every thrust, pushing back against Harry with ridiculous enthusiasm.
“What in Merlin’s name is wrong with you?” Draco asked, completely oblivious to how pathetic he looked.
“I was mocking you,” Harry sneered, overcome with fondness when Draco glared at him in response. Draco opened his mouth, probably to form an equally acidic comeback, but Harry seized the opportunity to capture his lips once again and slide his tongue between them. Draco’s taught body relaxed and he sighed, which was music to Harry’s ears.
“Prince Draco,” the stuffy white-wigged retainer said with a bow, “Your father requires your presence immediately.”
Harry nodded awkwardly, noting that Hermione’s hair seemed to be twice as large as the last time he had seen her.
“It happened right here. Keep your voice down, yeah? Don’t want to have to obliviate them if we can help it.”
Harry obeyed. He walked into the kitchen, shed his rags, and dressed himself in the fancy robes. After conquering the seemingly endless amount of buttons, Harry succeeded. He marvelled at the feel of the soft material on his skin and moved his limbs around; it was tight, but not unbearable. He caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror above the sink; he looked...fancy. Rich. Good. He walked out into the living room, feeling more handsome than he’d ever had, and Ron gave him two thumbs up.
“Oh, you don’t want me to…” Harry trailed off, realizing how stupid he probably sounded. “Sorry, Your Highness, but I’ve never met a royal before. I suppose I’m not sure what I should do.”
Harry’s jaw dropped as he went rigid. He stepped away from Draco’s body, still gripping firmly onto his slender wrists.
“Not that we know of, Prince Malfoy. At this time, I am unsure what caused it, but I’ll let you know if--”
Draco laughed, and Harry’s heart fluttered just as rapidly as when the two had shared their first kiss by the river. “You are a royal arsehole. But you do have me as your husband. So stop complaining.”
Harry lowered Draco to his feet and kissed him once again, this time with more heat. “Is that any way to talk to your fiance?” Harry whispered, breath causing Draco’s feathery hair to flutter about. Draco shuddered, relaxing into Harry’s touch, saying nothing. Harry smirked against his hair, breathing in the perfumey scent of his soap. So easy to wind him up, Harry thought.
And so they did. Harry stripped himself of his own shirt, failing to notice the way Draco’s eyes mirrored his own just a few moments before, and plunged into the frigid, clear water.
Harry circled his finger around the tight hole and just barely pushed inside. Draco let out a breathy moan at the contact and pushed into Harry's hand, all too eager, and Harry’s cock throbbed.
“My apologies,” The knight said, low and unfeeling. “The King’s orders take priority, Lord Draco. Surely you must know this.”
“I HATED those damned lessons! And I don’t care if he’s a prince, I won’t marry another man!” Dudley stomped his foot like a child about to throw a tantrum, and Harry couldn’t help but snicker.
“Malfoy,” Harry said politely. Malfoy nodded back but said nothing, gaze still cast downwards. Harry took a seat in the chair beside him and Malfoy noticeably tensed. Merlin, Harry wasn’t going to hex him or something. “How’ve you been?”
As Harry threw some wood into the fire and began cooking what would be a very mediocre breakfast (just because he was a servant didn’t mean he had to be a very good one) he imagined what his life might have become if he hadn’t lost his magic. Would he have been respected by Vernon and Dudley? Probably not. But maybe he wouldn’t be stuck sweeping the floors and cleaning up after his pig of a stepbrother. Perhaps he would have made something of himself--Maybe he’d even be training to become an auror.
Hope this chapter was satisfying! As a very gay female writing M/M smut is quite challenging for me but I think I did pretty ok. I hope. HAhahahaah anyways, thank you for reading this (I know I've said that a million times, but seriously. I'm grateful.) Thank you for all the kind and encouraging comments, they truly mean the world.
“What? Why not? Have you committed a crime?” Draco asked thoughtfully. “I wouldn’t put it past someone of your socioeconomic status.”
The days passed quickly, for Harry had never known such contentment. The rhythmic sound of Hermione’s gentle breathing in the bunk above his own served as a sleeping draught, as did the fluffy quilts enveloping his body each night, and Harry was more well-rested than he had ever been in his life. He and Ron passed the time playing Wizard’s Chess and chasing garden gnomes away, while Hermione read by the fire. The three of them often helped Mrs. Weasley with chores, without having being asked; Harry figured that it was the least he could do.
“Yeah. Yeah, of course I want to,” Harry said, voice more steady and sincere now. He walked over to Draco, who colored at Harry’s suddenly close proximity.
Draco felt a flicker of irritation at the repeated insults towards his father. Sure, his father was cold, but he was a pure blood and the king. And while Lucius may have not been the most...affectionate father (not that Draco needed affection),  Draco knew he was doing what was best for the kingdom. He would be forever loyal to his father and it was also Draco’s duty as the Prince to listen to the King, no matter what the circumstances.
Potter snorted. “Excellent feedback. ‘Night.” He rolled over, facing away from Malfoy now, and pulled the covers up to his chin. All Draco could see now was a messy head of black hair. Something akin to warmth bloomed in Draco’s chest for a moment before reminding himself that he and Potter were not, and never would be, friends.
Draco pulled his hand away from Potter’s and did as told. The sound continued for a moment before Kingsley’s voice began speaking into Draco’s ear. It sounded tinny, almost garbled.
Harry swallowed. It was one thing to come to terms with the fact, and another to vocalize it. “He’s the Prince.”
He knew then that he had to tell his father that he had fallen in love with Harry Potter, the lowly servant.
“Uhm, Harry, do you think someone slipped something into your drink?” Hermione asked, placing a smooth, dark hand on Harry’s forehead.
Harry laughed at Draco’s confused expression and took a step forward. He pressed himself up against Draco’s warm chest, and he could feel the quickness of his breathing and heartbeat. Harry laced a hesitant hand through Draco’s gelled hair, remembering with a sharp fondness how soft it was without all the product.
Hello again! Kait here! I really hope you all enjoy chapter two. I really liked writing it. Sorry-not-sorry for the super slow burn. xD As always, please be kind with your comments because I am a big baby. Thanks for the support and encouragement. It's gonna be one hell of a ride!
“No. I haven’t. This type of...chore isn’t for someone of my status,” Draco said, picking up the muddy shirt and dipping it in the river once again.
“He joined us in the end-- you do remember that, don’t you?” Hermione replied. She gently elbowed Ron. “He’s not all bad.”
Harry sighed in resignation. Fighting wasn’t worth it at this point. He’d assumed that he would be forbidden to attend, which is why he had worked out a rendezvous for Ron. Harry had doubts that he would even show up, so he prepared himself for the worst. The worst? Harry thought, grimly. Since when was the worst not being able to go to a horrid ball?
“Hermione! What are you doing here? You look...nice,” Harry said, in awe. She giggled, covering her mouth with a silk glove.
Harry shrugged. “S’pose I stopped getting hungry years ago, but yeah, I could eat,” He said, looking around the room pointedly. “Don’t think you can transfigure food, and you obviously didn’t pack anything. Gonna pull a royal feast out of your ass?”
Harry barked out a laugh when the color drained from Draco's face. “I love your son more than words can express.”
“Oh, not to worry, Harry. I am too. You know how it is. Anyway, Draco loves Harry dearly, so my conclusion is that he snuck away to find him. How he found our location, though, I have no idea.”
Harry stopped at the shop of every familiar merchant he knew to be trustworthy (he only possessed a small amount of cash and would not allow himself to be gypped) and purchased what was needed as quickly as possible. This granted him more time to roam freely.  His bags were exceedingly heavy today, however, since he was carrying an extra load of laundry (courtesy of Dudley’s floor) so Harry decided that he would head home sooner than usual in fear of losing both of his arms. The thought of returning home so quickly had Harry feeling even more bitter than before, so naturally when he bumped head-on into a scrawny, blonde rich guy he didn’t think twice before shouting angrily at him.
them. My father kicks them around a bit, but that's only when they deserve it. What I said was true, you know. Servants must be fed in order to work.”
“I…” Draco choked out when Harry absently stroked his fingers across Draco’s exposed thigh. “Can't. I can't.”
Draco’s eyes widen at that, and Harry feels a pang of sorrow at the way his face pales. His thin eyebrows are drawn together, dark circles beneath his eyes, and Draco looks like he used to again. Before the war, before everything. His hollow cheeks, although more filled out and healthy, still shadow the tormented man he used to be. And at that moment, Draco looks so vulnerable, so afraid, that  Harry leans over and places a gentle kiss on his still lips.
“You wouldn’t want to impair your servant, would you? If you have him sleep outside and fail to feed him, his quality of work will decline. What if he falls ill and can no longer cook your meals? My family, unfortunately, has learned this the hard way. If you want to punish him, perhaps you should increase his workload.”
“Harry,” She hissed, pulling brambles out of her wild hair. “You’re in trouble. Big trouble. We’ve come to save you. Now I’ll let you speak but you have to promise to be quiet!”
It was just past five AM when Harry arrived back at Grimmauld Place. He could have apparated if he had so desired, but his legs had needed a good stretching. Wordlessly and without a flick of his wand, Harry lit his fireplace. He plopped down onto his couch and sighed,  basking in the warm glow. His chest ached. Alone again. He considered owling Ron and Hermione but then thought better of it-- Harry wasn’t so sure his friends would take kindly to being woken up by a screeching bird in the wee hours of the morning. Before he had even taken his shoes off, Harry had dozed off. Through the windows, a strip of orange sunrise illuminated the clock on the wall. Six AM.
“Why you always pick fights with me. Why you always piss me off,” Harriet trailed her fingers downwards, capturing a soft strand of Draca’s hair and twirling it between them. Draca shivered, mouth parting slightly. “You just want my attention.”
“Hold on,” Harry began, swallowing thickly. “Your father, The King, was happy about the fact that I destroyed a solid one sixth of his castle?”
Draco sniffed proudly, masking his bashfulness. “Why wouldn’t you? Now go and fetch what little possessions you have. And for Merlin’s sake, get dressed. You look like a beggar.”
Before the two could sit in an awkward silence for too long, Kingsley walked to his desk and took a seat in front of him. His gaze was intense-- sad, even.
“Well, you are a stuck-up ponce. But I don’t think he minds,” She snickered, ruffling Draco hair affectionately.
The brief trek back to Harry’s place consisted of somewhat awkward silence and occasional bickering. Once the two arrived, Harry grabbed the spare key from under the doormat and let the two of them inside only to be greeted by an immediate:
Harry shook his head in an attempt to snap himself out of it. This was about Draco, and taking it slow.
“Yeah, yeah, Okay, Blondie, if you’re going stand here and make a scene will you at least help me carry these bags of laundry to the river?” Harry hefted a large laundry bag into the other boy’s arms. The blonde looked aghast and mildly horrified; he shifted and gingerly held the bag as far away from him as possible.
Draco was able to spot the trio easily due to Weasley’s hideous orange mop. Granger had an arm wrapped around him-- her hair was tied tightly into a bun and she wore a pair of earrings. Hm. Draco sincerely hoped that those two would not be producing offspring anytime soon. Weasley himself looked ten years older rather than five as he was sporting some sort of goatee and wearing a horrendous checkered jacket. Potter was grinning from ear to ear, cheeks pink from the booze. His teeth were white, slightly crooked, and his crinkled eyes were practically sparkling. Merlin, was Potter aware that he was a walking wet dream? Then Potter downed a shot without even batting an eye and Draco raised an eyebrow, somewhat impressed. For a moment he wondered what it might be like to drink with Potter, to laugh with him like his friends were now. Not that Draco ever drank. Or laughed. He watched for another moment as Potter said something that made the others lose it. Granger was gripping her abdomen and was seemingly struggling to breathe. Draco rolled his eyes, trying to stave off the ache in his chest with mere irritation.
Rather than shut Potter up, however, this just made him laugh harder. Draco watched in silence, somewhat transfixed. How could the bastard just stand there and laugh like that, after everything he had seen?  How could he just...continue to enjoy being alive? Potter wiped a tear away and cleaned his glasses.
Harry’s stomach unclenched and he released a tight breath he was unaware he was holding. “How do you even know that? And is this your own bigoted way of saying you’re okay with this?”
“I’m washing it? That’s what you do with laundry? I know you’re a noble and all but do you not know what laundry is-”
Harry sighed dejectedly, smile fading, and he swam quickly back to Draco and pulled him up. He coughed out a bit of water but seemed otherwise unfazed, eyes piercing Harry with a venomous glare.
“Give me a break,” Draco said, although his folded posture had opened up at Harry’s words. “Don’t you have somewhere to be?”
“Is that...silk?” Potter asked, not even making an attempt to compose himself. Draco puffed out his chest just slightly.
The King’s words were just that: words. Draco barely heard them, barely registered them; his brain was full of images of Harry. Harry. He was going to be okay, he was going to live; and on top of that, he was going to be married. To Draco.
Draco is clenching his fist now, jaw set tight. Despite his air of faux-confidence, however, his cheeks are still dusted pink. “That I’m...that I’m good enough for you.”
“Fine, I’ll teach you. It’s something to do other than laundry. You can meet me by the river. I do the laundry at noon there every Monday, Tuesday and Sunday.”
“You’re freed,” The King said blandly. “Your mother has tried to convince me that I owe you an apology, although I disagree with her accusations.”
" S'only a few miles away," Ron said, stepping gallantly in front of Harry and Hermione. "I'll lead the way."
“I like your hair like that,” Harry said, and Draco turned crimson at the compliment but Harry continued, “I don’t suppose you could transfigure me some new clothes? A toothbrush, maybe?”
Harry couldn’t remember much about the day his parents died. He had been eight years old. He remembered the rain, and the way it felt like the world was ending. He remembered how the fresh dirt on his parent’s graves felt rough against his palms after he had collapsed in front of their headstones. The rest was a haze of tears, beginning with Uncle Vernon’s smarmy smile and too tight grip as he lead him to the carriage, and ending with the feeling of his magic shriveling up inside of him and dying. Eventually, his magic trickled back, as time made pain fade, but it was a shadow of what it was these days; Harry could barely summon a flash of fire to warm himself as he slept on the cold floor of the Dursley’s kitchen.
“Yes, Harry,” Hermione replied. “That’s the last place The King and his men will look. No one knows you’re friends with Ron except for me, and what would they want with a lowly Muggleborn?”
Harry jumped a bit and hoped more than anything that Malfoy hadn’t noticed. “Yeah?!” Harry walked on his knees a few steps, cringing at the feeling of sand in his loafers, until he was directly next to Malfoy who seemed to stiffen at the close contact. Malfoy brushed off the sand for a moment and then stared at the item, completely silent. Harry still hadn’t the faintest idea what he was looking at.
Ron grumbled at Hermione’s demand but obliged, sliding the carriage door open and stepping out. He reached a metal-clad hand out and helped Hermione down.
“No, you idiot. Fish. Where there’s a river, there’s fish. Lived off of the pike fish in the creek by my house for years growing up.”
Draco’s face colored. Harry never got sick of this, never got tired of making Draco blush and squirm under his gaze. “N-No!”
“Look, he...he isn’t a Squib, I can tell. Pansy agrees with me. He’s just...there’s something wrong, he can’t use it!”
Once Harry returned to an empty manor, he plopped down in front of the fire and shivered as the information sunk in. Merlin, Draco had been the fucking Prince this entire time? Harry could have been arrested for treason with how flat out disrespectful he had been over the course of their interactions. He would have felt betrayed if it wasn’t for the fact that Draco (or rather, His Highness) actually had referred to himself as the Prince on multiple occasions; Harry just hadn’t taken him seriously. Why was it that Harry felt so sure of himself in those moments? His chest ached with a dull detachment. Although he had known from the start that Draco would never return his unwarranted feelings, he had allowed himself to hope, if only slightly. Now, however, he was confident of that fact. A Squib and a Prince? Yeah, right.
“Fair enough. Shall we get to work? Kingsley seems to think you’ll have some helpful insight, yeah?”
“Merlin, you’re hopeless. It’s his voicemail. He’ll hear the message when he sees that you left it. Push the red button now.”
Draco said nothing. His body was tense now, rather than pliant and relaxed like it had been just moments before. Harry immediately regretted bringing this up. Perhaps Draco wasn’t ready yet.
The words were simple, an easy read. Harry had never been a fan of long and complex stories. The plot was rudimentary, almost childish, but there was something about the tale that had him completely engrossed whenever he picked it up. An invisibility cloak? Surely there was no such thing.
“Next time try not to be so damn clumsy, Draco.” Harry admonished. When there was no response Harry opened his eyes. “Draco?” “Draco!!!” He called, realizing that his new, pissy acquaintance was no longer present. He spotted Draco floundering in the middle of the river desperately, trying in vain to keep his head above water. Harry watched as Draco’s head dropped like a rock beneath the surface. Frantic with worry, Harry once again dove back into the river to save Draco. He grabbed hold of the blonde's heavy, now-still limbs and dragged his body slowly to the shore. Bending over, Harry tried to pump as much water out of the other boy’s lungs as possible, but when he still refused to wake, Harry resignedly mumbled, “I guess I’m gonna have to do it.”
“I’ll take care of you,” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear. The blond man shivered, clinging to Harry for dear life, as Harry lined himself up with his entrance. He pushed the tip in, growling at the softness of Draco’s body around him. Harry sighed, fighting back the urge to thrust into Draco all at once.
The other woman giggled and elbowed her friend just slightly. She nodded her pointed chin at Malfoy, who was looking her over with slightly narrow eyes. “Wicked! You’re an officer as well?”
At that moment, as if she could read her mind, Malfoy swirled around and met her eyes, gaze intense and heated. Harriet swallowed, staring back. Malfoy’s eyes widened, having realized what she’d been doing, and she flushed all the way down to where her ivory disappeared beneath her robes. Harriet smirked devilishly at Malfoy’s reaction. Perhaps they’d been having very similar thoughts.
“Potter!” Draco shouted, bounding towards him with an almost frightening excitement. He was so close, so suddenly, and Harry was momentarily lost in the deep grey of his irises. “Your magic!”
“Excuse me?” Draco asked, light eyebrows furrowing angrily on his pale forehead. “How dare you call me a Muggle. I’ll have you know that I was born into the utmost nobility, from the purest of bloodlines--”
“Are you interested in books?” Hermione asked, Harry nodded. “Then you’ve come to the right place, Harry. Care for recommendations?”
Draco looked down at himself and felt a rising sense of panic when he realized that he was still in his work suit. He couldn’t sleep in this. How was he supposed to change when Potter was standing right next to him, probably placing judgments and--
“Oh, you know you don’t need to call me that anymore. You’re our second King!,” She replied, blushing at Harry’s gentlemanly act. “It went well. Those Americans, they can be tough, but I think I got through to them somewhat. The decision, now, is left to you two.”
Time was different, wrong even; but Harry’s body was strangely relaxed. It felt as though a heavy boulder have been lifted off of him both mentally and physically, like he was free of a dark, malignant illness that he’d been unaware of until this moment. Could it be that he... ? Harry shook his head, which was pounding rhythmically. His magic couldn’t have returned, not now, not after so long.
“Oh,” Draco closed his eyes in an attempt to avoid Potter’s gaze, or Potter’s anything else. “I suppose I... I suppose I don’t know.”
“You have quite a naughty mouth for a prince,” Harry said with a smirk. He didn’t intend it to sound the way it did, but Draco certainly interpreted it as such being as he dove back under the water to hide his rosy cheeks. Harry felt a quick surge of embarrassment only to feel rather pleased by his ability to make Draco blush. It was gratifying, seeing someone who thought so highly of themselves become a flushed schoolgirl. Not to mention, it made Draco appear more delectable than he already did.
Draco nodded curtly, only once. But Harry could tell he understood. Draco crouched down and waved a white hand through the sand, searching for something. Harry watched dumbly for a moment -- somewhat surprised that Malfoy was willing to get his hands dirty, and then kneeled and decided to join in. Seashells fell through their hands and Harry held back a laugh when Malfoy was startled by a sandcrab. They weren’t able to look for long, however, when the two women approached them. Bikini-clad bodies and blinding white grins had Harry looking them over as surreptitiously as possible.
Ron bellowed something at the footmen and the three were off, horses clopping along at a steady pace. It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the castle. Harry was almost appalled at how unnecessarily large the building was. He’d expected something more classy, more delicate; but to Harry, the castle just looked like an extremely overbearing hunk of brick. The Royal Family’s crest, a bold ‘M’ surrounded by serpents, waved proudly from the highest tower of the castle. The amount of knights blocking the entrance was just excessive; there had to have been at least fifty of them. Harry wondered idly how much knights like Ron got paid.
“I won’t fight with you anymore,” Harriet said, hoarse and determined. “I won’t.” Harriet ghosted her hand along the inside of Draca’s smooth thigh. Oh, how Harriet wished she could take these robes off. But they had a class next period.
“I believe so. But if you think we’re going to continue my lessons at a time like this, you’re surely mistaken--”
“Pretty great, isn’t it?” Ron asked, beaming with pride. Harry and Hermione looked at each other, grimacing simultaneously.
“Come on, Your Highness,” Harry mumbled as he trailed a sloppy kiss down The Prince’s collar bone. “Let me see you.”
“NO-no-no, I definitely was not trying to kiss you, why would I even want to?!” Harry said, turning beet red, “I was trying to give you CPR since you neglected to mention that your noble arse can’t swim.”
Hermione giggled softly, seeming very pleased by what Harry had just said. “He means, Ronald, that he’s in love with someone.”
Tired of reading textbooks and academic theorems, Draco ventured towards the fictional works. He wasn’t usually one for fiction. His mother used to read The Tales of Beedle the Bard to him when he was young, but his father had made her stop when he was around six. Once he could start reading on his own, Lucius had decided to swap out the soft, touchy fairy tales for reality. It was better for him. It would prepare him for the real world, at least that was what Lucius said.
“School was a confusing time for everyone,” Harry pressed. “I can’t speak for Dean but I know I cared about her, I still do. Besides, it’s Ginny; I’d feel bad for anyone who tried to use her just to get Hollyhead tickets.”
Ron nodded, his eyes falling away as he fell into a distant thought. "Yeah, anything to appease Hermione, I 'spose." He focused back on Harry. "We'll do something else soon, though, right?"
"No," Harry grumbled. "Robards says he's doing everything he can, but he's too distracted with everything going on tomorrow." So, Harry did know what tomorrow was.
He made an attempt; he really did. However, he had only gotten down to the lobby of his apartment building before he went scrambling back up to his flat. It only infuriated him more as he realized he couldn’t do anything on his own.
Taking a deep breath, he summoned up all of his Malfoy pride and pulled himself up to his full height. He entered the room with his head held up high. “Good morning, Granger, Weasley.” He went around to the other side of the cot and handed Harry one of the cups in his hand. “No coffee, only tea.”
"No," Harry snapped. "Like you said, he used to work for the ministry, alongside Aurors at times for unusual cases. He knows our tactics. It's why he hasn't been caught before this. He knows how to hide. We have people looking, but," Harry shook his head, "Robards doesn't have much hope. He's too smart."
“Teddy,” Andromeda called sharply. They both snapped their heads up towards the woman. Her lips had thinned but her expression was otherwise smooth of any true disdain. “Come here.”
“Not feeling well?” Malfoy repeated. He seemed fine the night before. If he was sick, then should he really be alone? He had Kreacher, but Malfoy had always preferred his mother taking care of him instead of one of their elves. What if it was something serious? He couldn’t imagine Potter would actually go to a healer if it was. He’d likely even refuse to let Kreacher get help. “How bad is he?”
A tense beat of silence swallowed up the whole room until Ron broke it the only way he knew how. “Would someone please tell me what just happened?”
Harry shook his head as he shoved his things into his bag. “I’m not handing this off to just anybody, and I’m not pulling people from their families today of all days. A few of us can get it done without any problem.”
“And I’m warning you, Potter. You shouldn’t get too close to Malfoy. You haven’t lived with him for the last seven and a half years. You don’t realize how obsessed with you he is. We used to have drinking games solely around how much he said your name.”
"That's not until the evening, though," Draco attempted, moving closer again. He remembered hearing the minister's speech on the one year anniversary, or the first five minutes of it. Lucius had shut off the wireless and grumbled about it being meaningless publicity to get the minister reelected.
Draco’s face did not relax, but he finally looked back down to his sketchbook, picking up his pencil again. “When will you stop being so ridiculous?”
Hermione straightened and for a moment it looked like she was going to jump up and give him Draco a hug as well. She shifted in her seat, debating if it was called for or not. As Draco eased into the room, she decided to stay seated but the concern remained on her features. “We came to check on both of you,” she said. “How are you, Draco?”
He glanced at Hermione. She waved her hand away. “Go, I’ll take care of Draco. Just, please, don’t do anything too stupid.”
The question continued to run through his head all morning. For the first time, he truly hated that they had electives first thing on Monday. When Transfiguration finally came around, Harry stopped just short of his usual desk beside Ron, favoring the one behind him beside Malfoy. There were a few curious glances, including from Ron and Hermione, but he ignored them all.
Harry’s shoulders fell. A long sigh left his lips and settled back onto the edge of Teddy’s bed. “I’m going to tell you something my own godfather told me. No one is really good or bad. Everyone has both light and dark inside of them. What matters is the part we choose to act on. The Malfoys made very bad choices in the past, but some are trying to fix it.” Harry bit his lip, suddenly remembering the time Draco had tried to surprise him by cooking dinner once. For someone who was good with potions, he was horrible at putting edible ingredients together. “Some of them can actually be very sweet…”
Harry frowned. There had still been a part of Terry’s story that didn’t add up: How did Goyle have Draco’s information at all? If Draco didn’t consider them to be friends then he wouldn’t have given him his private address. “You wouldn’t happen to have access to personal files, would you?”
Harry was able to stay in this frame of mind for the rest of the day and the next, as long as Draco was by his side. However, the following day, as Harry and Ron made their way to lunch after Divination, Harry spotted Zabini up ahead. The boiling heat returned to his veins.
Narcissa’s expression remained the same but she turned it to her plate. “And those without red-hair, what do they think?”
Harry had been far too solemn to just be talking about the food. It hadn’t gone unnoticed by Harry that Draco had stepped out of his comfort zone several times in the past two days without a hint of hesitation, and he was doing it all for him. Harry was incredibly grateful. If only he could have focused on that longer.
It’d been a half urge to hug the woman upon seeing her when he arrived. He’d only seen McGonagall in brief passing over the summers since the war had ended. It was never enough. He had never once gotten the chance to properly tell her just how much he admired the woman. Any time he did see her, it seemed a silly thing to say at random.
"Well, if I do end up staying here, we'll need to get a coffee machine," said Harry. "I'm not much of a tea guy."
Cobris stepped forward. “Look, mate, I have a cousin who was put under a love potion. Nasty stuff that is. You don’t know it’s happening though. He swore up and down that he was fine until we forced him to St. Mungo’s.”
A shattering sound pulled the bartender's attention to the rugby players. Harry slipped out the door. As promised, he began to walk home.
“I think the professors have been a little busy fixing the wards for the whole school.” Malfoy appeared to consider his words and then frowned as if someone else had said them and he had found them offensive.
Both of his eyes shut again, and he pulled his arms behind his head as a pillow. “No, I rather like it here.”
Draco reached towards the handle. His hand trembled. This could be some sort of trap. Ron just wanted him to open the door, so he could attack him again. He wouldn’t be the first. He had a wand, though, and the wards weren’t that strong; he could break down the door if he really wanted to. Draco opened the door.
He invited Draco to drink with him the first night. Draco agreed, but it was cheap liquor and gave him a headache, so he didn’t drink much. The second night he declined, but Harry drank without him. As well as the third. And the fourth.
He swept into the Auror’s office. The secretaries up front jumped away from one another when they saw him, dropping their hushed conversation. The pair of women gave forceful smiles but their eyes held the same concern he’d seen earlier. He’d always gotten along well with the girls up front but he was biting back the urge to hex them both.
“I’ve just been finding other ways to distract myself. I’ve mostly been exploring muggle London.” It wasn’t a complete lie. He and Draco did a lot of exploring, although it usually remained in a three-block radius of the flat.
“Auror Potter,” Robards barked. “In my office, now.” Ron and Neville hesitated to release him but Harry made an effort to straighten up. “Cobris, I’ll be speaking to you later.” Harry became eased by a fraction and they finally let go. Neville shot the counter to the silencing charm before he got too far away.
“Well, like you said,” Harry showed him a crooked, teasing smile, “you have a lot of other Aurors who know how to do the job. I just won’t be one of them anymore.” Harry held out his hand. “Goodbye, Sir.”
I feel like Harry should have a lot more issues from his childhood. I honestly don't remember him ever really talking about it to his friends other than mildly bitter comments. (Correct me if I'm wrong. It's been a while since I reread the whole series.)
“It’s me, it’s me,” Harry assured, his voice gruff as he clasped his head, trying to steady his thoughts.
The next day came and Draco once again noticed Potter leaving the library alone. His head was low, concealing most of his face. This time he was already rounding the corner outside in the corridor before he could spot Draco.
He could still feel the Ravenclaw’s stern eyes as she started to pull Luna away. “Come on, Luna. You said you’d help us with Care for Magical Creatures today.”
Harry was almost shaking with rage. “Maybe you’re the one who should be in Azkaban, Zabini,” he snarled, earning all of their attention. “One last arse out of the world can’t be a bad thing. And you don’t have to worry about Malfoy ruining your image, you’re all doing it very well yourselves.”
Harry jumped forward instantly, taking his hands. “I know, I know!” he assured. He gave them a squeeze, trying his best to silently persuade him of what his words could not.
Once they were back inside the safe walls of 3B, they began to talk about quidditch and what they used to get up to in their common rooms to curve boredom. It was mostly wizards' chess and exploding snap. However, the Slytherins had a fun game of trying to annoy grindylows, which floated past their underwater windows ― the winner was whoever got one annoyed enough to run itself into the glass.
Harry finally got to the bed and began to gently prod Malfoy’s shoulder. It only made his breath quicken as he cringed away. “Hey, Malfoy. Malfoy, wake up.” He gradually began to shake him harder. “Draco, it’s just a bad dream. Wake up.”
There was a moment of silence as Harry finished up his tea preparation—easily speeding up the process with a boiling charm—and then reappeared in Malfoy’s line of sight as he finally sat on the opposite couch.
“I don’t know, Ronald,” she sighed. “I’m just worried about him. For a second, we had him back.” She looked away from the cutting board to meet her boyfriend’s gaze, her eyes glassy. “At this point, I would invite Umbridge over for dinner if it meant we got him back.”
She was clearly reluctant but eventually let her face smooth, returning to a dignified pose and sipping at her latte. Draco was still smirking as he smoothed out the wrinkles in his top.
Another laugh poured out of Harry’s lips. He didn’t try to restrain this one. He clutched Teddy’s sides and pulled him into a tight embrace, causing giggles to fall from the child as well. “Have I ever told you that you’re the best godson?”
It was only when Harry hit a sweet spot and Draco heard his own moan in the air that Draco found some sort of focus.
Harry moved a little closer but didn't touch him. "Malfoy," he spoke as calmly as possible. "Listen to me. It's okay. I'm not going anywhere. I won't make you go anywhere, I swear. You're safe. Just try to breathe, and it'll pass. It's going to pass."
A cold chill ran down Harry's spine. His silence pulled Ron around in his chair. He looked at his best mate with a worried frown – he knew that look. "You did check, right?"
This story is getting much longer than I expected it to. I'm going to try to keep it within 5  chapters at a maximum but I've given up on limiting word count.
Not to mention the last line. Hogsmeade. Draco wasn’t stupid enough to go there. It was too far from professors and people liable for his wellbeing. He’d be a sitting duck for any curses or hexes. Although he would be lying if he said he wasn’t a tad happy that his mystery pen pal already wanted to meet him.
A sigh followed Draco’s lips away from Harry’s mouth as they pulled apart. “Come on, let’s finish packing.”
That was right. Kreacher had been the one who sold out the Order to Narcissa Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. He's the one who told them that Sirius was a weakness for Harry. It was still difficult for Harry to look at Kreacher when he thought too much about his godfather.
Harry sat up straight. “What? No, of course not! I loved Ginny.” A deep ache in his chest made his shoulders fall. The memory of hurting her rolled through his brain and he suddenly felt like he was going to be sick. “We weren’t good for each other.”
When it was time to go home, Harry hurried to pack up his things and leave. Ron didn’t even attempt to slow him down. In fact, he headed off Neville before he could ask Harry a question, allowing him to slip out.
The smile on Harry’s lips vanished. Draco’s jaw was twitching with grinding tension, his eyes millions of miles away. “You’re afraid he’ll tell people.” Harry wasn’t sure why this caused such a warm flare in his chest. It had nothing to do with him or what he told people. Yet, at the same time, it felt like he was the one having to lie. “You know this is sort of something that’s never going to go away, right? You’ll end up with someone one day, and others will find out.”
Harry shook his head, his smile faltering. "No, I'm fine. I, er, promised Kreacher I'd do the cooking tonight."
Only the barest sliver of sense maintained his distance. This couldn’t be all him. It had to be Draco’s choice. Harry had to know he wanted it too.
Something sparked across Zabini’s face. Draco could put a name to it, but it didn’t fit on Zabini. What did Zabini have to be troubled about?”
Harry hummed, still attempting to make Malfoy squirm. “Then I guess you don’t know me very well.” He stood straight and started over to the small kitchenette behind Malfoy’s couch which was mostly only stocked with various tea tins and the rogue coffee can which was hardly touched.
George swallowed the lump in his throat. He tore his eyes off of Draco to look down at Angelina then finally nodded. She led him out the door, Charlie and Ron jumping out of their way.
“I just need to talk to him about something. It will be fine.” Harry wasn’t all that reassuring, but he gave Ron very little room to argue, already hurrying on ahead to catch up with the Slytherins.
His smile was wide, even as a wand tip appeared under his chin. “So you’re fine with it, I’m sure. You think you’re just his supportive friend, right?” He licked his lips. “You see, that’s why I wanted to talk to you, actually. I wanted to warn you, but maybe my concern is wasted since you aren’t even smart enough to connect the dots yourself.”
Draco wondered how hard it would be to turn one of his paper cranes into a dragon. Making it breathe fire seemed implausible for obvious reasons, but he knew he could make it fly around some.
Harry stepped into the fireplace, powder in hand, and announced his desired destination loudly and clearly before whirling away and in emerald flames.
Malfoy's shoulders fell. His eyes flicked up and down Harry before he let out a sigh. "Fine, maybe I had done something."
“Oh shut it, Auror Potter, I know the rules,” Pansy urged. “We’re allowed to tell our significant others if they are muggles as long as we are prepared to clean it up if it goes wrong, which it didn’t. I only told her a few days ago, I haven’t gotten around to filing it at the ministry.”
Harry wasn’t surprised the child who he’d never met hadn’t recognized him the dim shadows which seemed to forever loom over Knockturn Alley. However, he didn’t appreciate having his name yelled so loudly.
Draco became flushed. It increased when she gave him a tight squeeze – for once not fearing that she might break her own son. It was a longer hug than she normal gave. Draco had to be the one to finally pull away. “Please, come in.”
He had woken up, thinking Harry was having another nightmare, but before he could shake him awake, Draco's name came out of Harry's lips on a moan. It was an immensely sensual sound ― one which sent an array of confusing emotions pulsing through Draco's body. He was somewhere between a panic attack and in need of a cold shower.
Harry went back to his tea and tried not to think about Draco Malfoy currently being in his room. He wondered which bed he had actually taken, it wasn’t as if they were clearly marked out as whose was whose. Ron and Harry bought nearly everything they owned at the same shops or were hand-me-downs from his brothers. The idea of Malfoy in his bed sent a small shrill down his spine that he told himself was unease.
Draco rolled his eyes with such exaggeration it was a shock that they didn’t roll out of his head. He took one hand back to rake through his hair, as if silently saying, “But I’m still pretty.” At least, that’s what Harry certainly thought as he watched the delicate white strands feather down into a soft wave.
He stood tall again, pulling Teddy off the ground as he began to tickle his sides. Teddy’s laugh rang through the house, making several others laugh as they watched.
They remained in silence for a long moment, their eyes locked. Harry thought Draco was going to ignore him but he watched as the mask slowly crumbled away. Draco’s eyes softened and gradually filled with remorse. His bottom lip trembled almost imperceptibly. Finally, he opened his mouth and a breath shook out. “What- What did he say?”
Pansy had stopped messaging him as often after her last visit, and his mother only sent an owl around about once a month. He did, however, have new resources at his disposal. He found out that he hated talking on the phone after calling Hermione. Merely waiting for social interaction and listening to that dreaded dial tone was absolutely stress-inducing. He wasn’t about to starve himself, though. He had survived too much to end up in a grave like that. Friday evening, he gave in and picked up the phone.
She shuttered against him. He felt his shirt begin to get wet, and it only made him hold her tighter. Ron found himself conflicted. His own eyes were burning, but he wasn’t sure if he was sad or angry. Why couldn’t Harry just let them help? Why couldn’t he call Ron and ask him to come with him? Why did he insist that he do everything by himself?
Harry sat up abruptly and tossed the closed snitch onto the pile of clothes by his wardrobe. “You’re sleeping here tonight,” he declared.
Ron sat back. His lips pressed into a thin line. He tried to work this information through his mind. He’d defended Terry so much when the incident happened because he had understood what it felt like to lose a brother and also because he was biased against Draco. Now, he couldn’t ignore facts, and, whether he would admit out loud or not, he was beginning to believe in Draco. “I’ll pull his files. He should still be under monitoring and receiving counseling.”
Harry swallowed down the bite and grinned lopsidedly. “That’s why I’m here, actually. You’re going to sit with us.”
All the while, Draco made quick work of the room. The smell was soon nonexistent and every surface was spotless. He returned to the flat solely to collect all of the linen and removed the black, frilled duvet with theirs. It was around this time that Harry realized he was more of a hindrance than a help so he left Draco to it.
Returning to Grimmauld wasn’t easy, to say the least. Kreacher attempted to make him comfortable, in his own coarse way. He primarily kept supplying food and drink. Harry took the drink more easily than the food.
“You aren’t the only person that people are going to be angry at about this and, if you’re right, if there is a leak, then his whereabouts might not be as secure as we all think.”
Ron’s feet were rooted to the ground. He didn’t know what to think because he could see two toothbrushes in the bathroom, and he recognized his mother’s knitting in the drawer. He scanned the room, looking for anything else that might possibly explain what was going on. His eyes caught sight of a red book on one of the bedside tables. A cold wave rolled over him.
From the way they spoke, Draco became more and more convinced they were a muggle-born due to them mentioning things like being hunted or on the run. The more certain of this he became, the more his chest ached. This wasn’t the type of person his father had always told him muggle-borns were. They were clever and funny and kind. They were exactly the kind of person he always wished he had in his life when he was alone. How could they ever be bad?
“No,” Harry said firmly. “I’m not, at all. Do you think you’re the first person to ridicule me? Being nice to people―and them being nice to me―is still sort of new territory.”
Malfoy left his side and went up the stairs behind Neville and Hannah, presumably also to grab his coat.
They pulled back instantaneously. The kiss had been short and simple, both of their minds still whirling from what they had both just felt. They stared blearily at one another, blinking through their hazy thoughts as they tried to guess what the other was thinking.
Harry shooed the topic away as he took another sip from his cup. “Actually,” he was at least going to have to tell him where he would be all day Saturday, “I was reminded that Teddy’s birthday is this weekend.”
Harry, himself, found it hard to chew through his chuckles as he looked at the wide-eyed man. "Did you expect it to be bad?"
“Yes but his counselor makes it sound like he was doing much better at the end,” Hermione urged. “Why would he snap back all of a sudden?”
That was how it was for Draco in Wiltshire. The manor was doused in wards and tucked so far back that even the most lost muggle tourist could not stumble upon them. This was the first thing that felt similar between Draco’s upbringing and the Weasleys’.
No matter how many sweaters Mrs. Weasley knitted him or the way Charlie and Bill patted his shoulder, he was not a Weasley. He did not know the pain of having an absent brother quite as sharply as the others.
"You didn't kill anyone, Malfoy," Harry insisted. That had been the main point of his argument during the trial. Malfoy had never actually killed anyone. He didn't have blood on his hands.
Harry’s heart was still pounding out of his chest but he gave the figure a better look. Sure enough, it was Pansy Parkinson standing outside in the dark with a petrified expression on her face.
Harry had started back the way he had come, suddenly not feeling very hungry at all. Maybe he'd just drink at Grimmauld tonight. With enough Firewhiskey, Harry could forget where he was.
Of course, he never had the best habits to begin with. Sitting and watching the television for hours on end was likely not the best for him. He couldn’t make himself do much more, though. As much as he kept telling himself to forget about Harry, it simply wasn’t happening. It didn’t help that Harry’s stuff was still there. He should really clean that out.
When he got into a view, they found another person with him. Pansy stood with a quill and a pad of paper in her hand, a firm glare in her eyes.
He started to rush to the kitchen but she grabbed his arm, pulling him back. "No, no," she said through an odd combination of tears and laughter. Before he could question her, she pulled him into a bone crushing hug.
It’s like every hot burst that used to fill his veins when Draco angered him suddenly made sense. There had simply been a barrier there. One that muffled his wits and blocked him from understanding what he really wanted. They’d finally broken past it. The rolling heat was now sharp jolts of electricity shooting through his body, begging him to move closer, to fill in the infinitesimal gap.
Harry watched with wrapped amazement. Self-healing was a tricky thing, especially when one couldn't see the actual injury. There were several healers in the Ministry's infirmary he was certain couldn't do that, although that was one of the reasons he rarely went to them - it was only after leaving Hogwarts did one realize just how great of a healer Madam Pomfrey really was.
A pang in Harry's chest was paired with a flashing thought of hurt that Malfoy had shot down that idea so quickly. He quickly pushed it away. "I just assumed that you see me enough. Aren't you getting sick of me?"
“Oh, yes, I suppose you’re right,” Hermione sighed. The concern in her eyes when she looked back at Harry made him squirm. She squeezed his arm one last time before finally getting up. “I’ll be back with Ron tomorrow.”
Harry started to push himself off the bed when his heart was thrown into overdrive. “Or you could stay.”
The rumbling heat in Harry’s chest momentarily cooled to a comforting warmth as he looked at his friend. He really shouldn’t have expected anything less.
Ron’s eyebrows shot up all the way into his fringe. “Oh, er– Yeah.” He scrubbed the back of his neck. “You never had a thing for me, though, right?”
“I quit for both of us.” He trailed his touch up Draco’s cheekbone, following the sharp line to a small tuff of blond hair which he tucked behind his ear. “I want to be able to touch you like this in public, to hold your hand going down the street. I want to go somewhere no one knows us, just you and me.”
"Here's the address," Robards handed Harry a half sheet of paper with an address scribbled on. "Apparate, it's quicker than finding the right Floo. And hurry before any muggles get hurt."
When it seemed he could find no clear evidence that he was speaking to an imposter, he spoke again, “Why don’t you ask your Weasel?”
She shook her head. “No, he only said you weren’t cleared. He was very brief. I thought it was a bit rude, honestly.”
They stood there for what felt like was simultaneously hours and seconds. Much time had passed, but it was still not enough. They had to eventually break apart.
“The ferret’s not dead, right?” Ron’s tone was teasing, but Harry could actually find some concern wrapped in it.
Ron and Hermione typically made a point of at least having Sundays off, and they urged Harry to stay with them for it. He agreed but needed some things from Grimmauld like a shower and a change of clothes.
Finch-Fletchley whooped in glee and both Abbot and Macmillan clapped for him. Only after they were done congratulating him did their eyes turn back to Draco. He hadn’t stuck around for a thank you, not entirely expecting one. Instead, he had returned to his own solitary practice, shooting water into a half-empty bucket.
“Clearly you don’t know me as well as you think, then, Malfoy.” He leaned forward and picked up his mug, flicking the used teabag into the bin beside the door. He stirred lightly and took a sip.
"Well, then I guess I have to," Malfoy huffed, making Harry roll his eyes. Leave it to Malfoy to make it seem like he was being forced into something. "Let's go."
“Put him there?” Draco repeated. Of course, that’s what they’d assume. Draco had to be the source of all the bad things that happened. It was always his fault. “I didn’t do anything to him!” he snapped. “It was Macnair, not me.”
Except for the slap across the face their third year, Granger was not one who was quick to physical violence. She didn’t appear angry, only a bit uncomfortable. She wasn’t harmless ― certainly not ― but she was at least not meaning harm at the moment.
Harry took his own deep breath, but it did not relax him. It only pulled in the hot ire that he’d had when talking to the snake. “Well, he figured out that you told me about last year.” Draco shifted his weight on the bed, this fingers beginning to assault his thumb. Harry went on, trying to make his words sound as ridiculous and unbelievable as possible, “Then he tried to make it sound like you were gonna jump me in my sleep or something.”
He was the only man that the Dark Lord was truly afraid of and yet he had sent Draco, a sixteen-year-old boy, to kill him. He had assumed Draco would not succeed. It was meant to be a death sentence, a wild goose chase to humiliate and destroy the Malfoy family.
Malfoy would have usually chased him. However, his heart was fluttering far too fast for him to even comprehend standing.
Just as Ron went to open his mouth, a folder landed on the desk between them. They both snapped their attention to the head of the Auror's department. "Everyone's busy on their own cases, but I've got a report of an Unforgivable Curse in a mostly muggle area."
“I don’t,” Harry said without a moment of contemplation. “I’m not scared of you, and I’m not scared of people seeing me with you.”
With a little jostling around, they put in the door pin and started up the stairs – Malfoy didn't trust magicless elevators. Soon enough, they were back to the flat, and Harry was finally able to begin dinner.
That had been a mistake. Harry knew it had been. He had promised himself that he’d wait, that he wouldn’t push. Draco had already given him a second chance; there was no way he would get a third. He had just ruined everything.
The dim fireplace suddenly became very interesting to Harry. So interesting, in fact, that he was too focused on the crackle to hear a word Malfoy said.
Harry’s eyes had locked with his. Horror swept away on the back of mischief. A crooked smile peeled over Harry’s mouth, and then his hand ran wildly through Malfoy’s hair, shaking loose any previous form it had.
Many heads turned. It was a common effect whenever Harry went anywhere with high wizard traffic. It was the main reason he stopped coming to Diagon Alley or the Leaky Cauldron unless he absolutely needed to. However, usually when people looked at him it was with awe and gratitude. Now he received scornful looks. Parents with their young children quickly tugged them away. Elderly witches and wizards glared without mercy.
"If another person dies because I couldn't save them." Harry spun on his heel, starting towards the door again.
Feet pounded on the stone steps and four other children of varying ages came down, Ms. Craft right behind them.
Harry simply shrugged. He was still riding his high, and he wasn’t going to let anything pull him down.
Somehow, Harry couldn't imagine a set of parents not getting along. He was fortunate in that area, at least. Even Vernon and Petunia had always functioned as a cohesive unit.
