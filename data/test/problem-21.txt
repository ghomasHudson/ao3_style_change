At the moment, Draco could not think of a person he’d less like to be having this conversation with.  “P-Professor!” he sputtered at last.  “I have no idea what you’re talking about!”
The man nodded, and he swore he saw something like respect bloom in his eyes.  “I see.  You might do well, after all.”
Together, they were adorable.  And suddenly, he found himself wondering if this was more of a “couples costume” than a friendly coordination.

“Harry, don’t put yourself down like that, your dick is beautiful, I love your theater sandbag balls.” He looked up at Harry with puppy dog eyes. “They genuinely are a joy to play with.”
Zabini noticed him first.  Harry could tell he’d been picked out of the crowd when he saw the man’s eyes widen comically before he turned to whisper furiously to the two Slytherins beside him.  An instant later, Malfoy’s gaze flicked to him incredulously, and Harry’s heart stopped as it dipped to survey his whole outfit before returning, perplexed, to his face.
[The rest from there proceeds as normal.  Judging commences in its usual way, though instead of following the praise for CEDRIC, DRACO instead stares astonishedly after HARRY.  We can almost see the thrum of adrenaline draining from his veins as he looks more and more puzzled about recent events by the second.]
VOLDEMORT: Delicious flavors.  I don’t usually like basil, but it complements the parmesan beautifully, and the black pepper brings an edge of spiciness that keeps it from being too bland.  Moving onto the sweet.
But the man merely stammered, “I wasn’t…I mean, I’m not.  Anymore.  Or not in the same way-”  He stood, frozen in the doorway with embarrassment, and Draco saw his opportunity.
I hadn’t even marked my page yet!”  Draco scrambled to do so now – though it was difficult when his arms were pinned.
And now, Wednesday was meandering into Thursday, and Thursday was crawling – slow as treacle – into Friday.  Time was betraying him consistently and mercilessly, and by the time Saturday morning came, he felt battered by its cruel expansion.  And then, quite suddenly, there was none.
had healers standing by – or, at least, people with capable healing experience.  To play so recklessly without it…
could tell that pursuing Draco was a bad idea.  Be it his past or his family or his reputation, the reason was immaterial – Potter knew it couldn’t happen.
Her gaze softened a fraction as she considered him.  “Where did you go after the war?” she asked.  Then, sardonically, she added, “And what are the papers likely to dig up, now that you’ve ‘stepped into the spotlight,’ as it were?”
Draco didn’t have the wherewithal left to answer.  “Just get out.”  He wanted this to be over with as soon as possible.
He stumbled to the bench and sat, pleased that he’d made it that far without falling.  His calves were going to be sore, for sure – though not nearly as sore as Harry’s arse.  Their huffing breaths were the only sound breaking the silence, and Draco allowed himself this quiet moment to reflect that, this time around, Hogwarts was giving him a lot of second chances.  It was like he was purging the bad memories in each corner of the grounds and filling them with better ones – an errant thought that quickly solidified into a mission.
, so that was why I took a brief break from posting.)  Now I should be back on track for putting up a chapter every other/every third week.
and broke free of his grip to take him down once more.  And that was it.  Draco spasmed, clutching wildly at Harry’s head and neck and shoulders as his orgasm tore through him.  He could feel Harry’s throat contracting as he swallowed down his cum, and the eroticism of that thought had his muscles seizing in yet another wave of release.
DRACO: I should… [He trails off, eyes catching on the bench in front of him where we know HARRY is working.  His eyes narrow, and he straightens his shoulders.]  No, I will.  I’ll make sure of it.
Fine.  That was fine.  It had been foolish of Draco to even consider the alternative, and he had been planning to keep his head down this year anyway – Potter was just doing him a favor by making it easier for him.
The weight on his chest lightened immeasurably.  “Thank you, Headmistress.”  In her capable hands, Potter would be knocked to his senses.  “It means a lot to me.”
Thanks for reading, and I hope you all have been staying safe. Your comments really mean the world to me and inspire me to keep going with my works. 💕
, Harry,” he said, when he regained the capability of speech.  He pushed the man gently off of him, when the after-tremors were growing too intense.
Draco had no prospects.  His education was incomplete, he was a social and political pariah, and, moreover, he was without a wand for another nine months.  In terms of jobs he could actually perform, his options were severely limited.  So he’d gone for the only field he thought he’d have a chance at: Potions.
His shoulder, his forearm, and his thigh pressed tightly to Potter’s, and each swath of skin under his gear was branded with the singular, white-hot knowledge of that intimacy.  His eyes were on the snitch.
MINERVA: [a smile breaking across her severe face] Beautiful work.  These are all perfectly uniform in size, and they have quite a handsome look to them.
“That’s okay.”  He cleared his throat, still trying to think of the best thing to say – but the perfect script eluded him.  “Really, it’s okay.  Lots of people feel like that, I’m sure.  I…  Well, if you need someone to talk to about it, you can always come to me.”
Draco pulled down his pants, and his member sproinged into action. A bit of his foreskin still covered the tip of his long cock. He stroked a couple times, pulling it back. “Now I’m pudding it in you! Bend over.”
Draco arched a brow, his nervousness fading a touch at their comfortable banter.  “I’m sorry to disappoint, but I should tell you up front that I don’t
Draco had never expected that, after all this time trying to get his attention, Potter choosing to sit and talk with him at breakfast would leave him
Harry caught the glances of his friends and stiffened further, setting his jaw in a way that meant he couldn’t believe Draco was doing this in front of company.  Draco, however, had no qualms about fight-flirting with Harry in public – in fact, there was little he took pleasure in more.
Literally, he had just asked that.  After confessing to his own feelings of aimlessness, no less.  It was obvious that the two of them were
“Not yet, Potter,” Draco hissed as he hauled Harry back onto his cock by the hair.  Harry’s back curved like a bow, and as soon as Draco was fully seated in him, he could feel Harry spasm.  His muscles clenched in tandem, each one stretching and tightening in a constellation of strength and beauty that Draco could watch for all his days.
He wet his lips, taking a long look before leaning in by Harry’s ear.  “And how many spanks do you think you deserve?” he whispered, wrapping a hand possessively around Harry’s nape.  When the man didn’t respond beyond a shiver, he offered, “You know, you called me ‘
Draco smirked.  “It’s not my fault if your pranks are of lesser quality.”  He leaned on his arm, trying to blink away his lingering weariness.  Something clicked in his mind.  “By the way, how’d you even find my room?”  It hadn’t been a possibility he’d considered for this interaction.  Not that he was complaining – any attention Potter directed at him was viewed as a precious quantity.
[CEDRIC beams, and immediately falls down on one knee.  He holds up the ring he’s retrieved from his biscuit and swivels so his eyes land on Cho in the crowd.  Miraculously, they are mimicking the exact posing of his gingerbread figures in relation to their persons, the field, and the tent.]
He took a long drag from his cup and then sighed.  It would be vacation soon enough, and, personally, he couldn’t wait for the opportunity to laze about the castle with nowhere to be and no assignments to keep Harry distracted from him.  Just imagining it, even, felt blissful; it felt like more than he deserved.
His students were still getting used to the feel of flying – with the exception of several purebloods and half-bloods who had grown up riding child-size brooms and looped the pitch a bit smugly.  Merlin, it didn’t seem terribly long ago that that had been him.  When he’d arrived at Hogwarts that first year, he’d had almost five years of practice on the most high-end of kids’ brooms; Father had wanted him to be the top seeker after all.
on the door after he latched it, and all the secrecy of it forced another inappropriate bubble of laughter from Draco’s throat.
The next day, Draco woke with a smile on his face that startled him into an upright position.  He had slept with Harry Potter.
“Are you alright?  Do you want some tea?”  Harry asked, gesturing with the kettle – which was apparently full, as water sloshed out the spout and hissed into steam upon the counter.
Flitwick didn’t seem to notice, however, and went on enthusing his interest.  “Well!  It’s going to be a great addition to the slew of extracurricular activities here.  Always was a great club – when Albus told me no one was signing up anymore…oh, about fifteen years ago now, I told him that was
Reversing his weight backwards, he watched Malfoy stumble in surprise and took that opportunity to draw him closer for a spin.
That’s right!  It had been in one of Aunt Petunia’s movies.  Not the ones she’d watched with Vernon, obviously, but the ones she’d play in the hours when her husband was off at work.  They were romantic, mostly, so Harry could understand her embarrassment, but he suspected it was also the fact that many of them were

Hannah, who had looked up from her book with a startled expression when he’d dropped into a chair, burst into laughter at his melodramatic entrance.  “What is it
“I can…go?”  Harry sounded painfully hesitant, which made it easier for Draco to convince himself it was a mercy to send him away now.
Draco smiled a bit sadly as he slipped his hands in his pockets and stared at the horizon with her.  “It’s okay if you aren’t.”
“That’s good, then.”  She went back to sipping her tea, now adequately sweetened.  Her whole being radiated triumphant satisfaction at his flustered, telling reactions.  “So tell me more about flying classes.”
his lingering sense of self-disappointment that had him slumped over a table in the back of the library while the world went on around him.  And it certainly wasn’t his latent pitifulness that caused Hannah Abbott – or rather, Hannah Longbottom, now – to sit down at his table with a shy chuckle and a greeting of, “Oh no, who’s stuck on your mind?”
was any more relatable to wizards than fashion, but the plan didn’t involve squeezing his legs into fabric sausage-casings, so he was content to trust her on this one, for his sake.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter as well as the much-awaited appearance of LUDO BAGMAN!  (Much-awaited only by me, as I've planned this for a while now hahaha.)  For those of you who are also fans of the Potterless Podcast, you'll understand why this is a prime bit of humor.
“What is what?” Harry repeated, feeling dumb.  Talking to Malfoy was overstimulating; it made his thoughts race a mile a minute, and he ended up losing track of the conversation.
always thought.”  She paused for a moment to absorb the epiphany of her own agreement before carrying on.  “Out of curiosity, is there any particular potion you’re working with at the moment?”
Harry smiled conspiratorially, like he’d cottoned on to what Draco was thinking, but then promptly shattered the illusion by saying, “Yeah, well, I would’ve been even sneakier if I’d been a Slytherin.  I don’t know if you’d like that so much.”

The loose t-shirts and jeans he wore only concealed his lean muscles and smooth expanse of brown skin.  It was practically a crime – and one Draco was only willing to forgive in order to keep this to himself forever.
It still felt a bit surreal.  Like he might wake in the hospital wing and be told he’d taken a bludger to the head on his first day of class and that the rest was his fantasy.
Draco bit his cheek, fighting to understand what he was referring to and coming up short.  “I can’t say I follow, sir.”
Harry had been reassuring the unsuccessful students (and mostly Draco, he suspected) when he’d given this particular bit of advice: “If you haven’t cast a corporeal
” he called, desperately aiming for his usual, mocking tone of voice.  An image of the man shirtless spiked through his brain again.
get my balls hexed off if I ever run into your father.”  Which was as good of a tension-breaker as any.
“The-the others!  They were waiting here, all ready to jump out and scare people who came through!”  It struck him suddenly that lying to Potter like this was probably a terrible idea.  After he’d taken his hand…after that little demonstration of trust-
Grant’s casual expression flickered, revealing something angry underneath.  But he gathered himself and smiled – the gesture not quite reaching his eyes.  “So you’re all set from here, then?  No bruises to heal, no teammates to celebrate with?”  His voice was forcedly light as he added, “No one to thank for keeping you safe all this time?”
His head snapped up to look in the mirror.  He hadn’t been expecting anyone, seeing as this was the staff bathroom for the players to use – entirely separate from the one for the pub’s customers.
Harry, playing the game whether he was aware of it or not, eyed him fleetingly with a wobbly laugh.  “You wouldn’t betray your family for me.”  It was a statement phrased like a question, edging on a dare.
He’d looked away immediately after saying it, like it had been an unintentional slip.  And that was why Draco had latched onto the moment with such intensity.
He fell back into his role with vigor, tutting and muttering, “Eager little thing, aren’t you?”  The kind of thing he might’ve said in a sixth-year fantasy after waylaying Harry in the halls.  It was easy to submerse himself in such an act – far easier than figuring out how to transpose his tenderness into actions without scaring Harry away.
“Lovely,” she said after he’d reluctantly closed the door.  “You’ve made a nice place for yourself here, it seems.”
He let himself sputter and gasp unrestrainedly on the ground for another minute or two before the humiliation began to set in, and he sat up and tried to slow his breathing while schooling his expression as best he could.  Potter shuffled to do the same – though Draco forced himself not to look at him.  Which was partially why he startled so much when Potter spoke.
“I can see that.  You were both doing pretty well too.”  He saw their eyes light up.  “Now how about you show me what you’ve been working on, and I’ll give some pointers for improving your form as we go?”
“There are many things I wish I could change,” he finally settled on saying.  “It doesn’t mean they actually could have happened any other way.”  Even if
HARRY: [aside] It’s looking pretty good, actually.  I was expecting it to be softer, and then I’d have to put it back until it was firm enough to hold.
SEAMUS: [confessional aside] They told me I would blow something up, and I was like ‘Nah, I’ve changed.  I haven’t blown anything up in over a month now!’  But…in the end, they were right.

him.  The familiar spike of lust shot through him harshly, and he marveled at the amount of time it had taken him to recognize it for what it was.  He’d always felt this way, for as long as he could remember: the sharp frisson of energy running between Malfoy and him, electric and inescapable.  When he was younger, he’d always mistaken the feeling as simply spoiling for a fight.  Not that it
It had been a whole week since the incident, and Ron still hadn’t grown tired of telling the story; Ginny and Luna had better be the last ones he’d recount it for in Harry’s presence, though he didn’t have high hopes.
Her question cut through his musings, and Draco eyed her warily before responding.  It seemed that she was being civil today, too, from her less extravagant lavender robes to her slightly softened expression.
startled Draco neatly out of his worries of visiting his parents.  “Have you really?” he asked, and Harry’s avoidance of eye contact thereafter spoke volumes that the man himself did not.
Before Harry had time to voice any of his doubts, Malfoy started speaking in a rush.  “Shit.  I had sworn to myself that I would wait and see whatever ridiculous act you had planned for me tonight, but this is too much for even me to bear, Potter.”  With that, he jerked Harry in by the shirt, and then their lips were colliding, and their teeth knocked together, but Malfoy, undeterred, buried his other hand in Harry’s hair and held him in place.
Merlin, no wonder Harry had praised Draco for his public speaking.  It hadn’t been anything special, but this was just pitiful.
Draco felt Harry’s gaze like a physical touch, its slow path from base to tip drawing the blood like a lascivious spell.  His cock lengthened until it brushed against Harry’s nose, which startled a gasp from them both.  Draco quickly turned his to babbling, lest it dissolve into a whine instead.
though – every few minutes, he’d let his gaze land on Potter, then convince himself it was an accident.  He was just used to scanning the room, that’s all.  Threats could be looming around every corner; constant vigilance and all that-

Draco arrived at the room on time, but chose to mess with Potter a bit before going in.  He leaned on the wall outside of the classroom and listened to the increasingly flustered pacing of the man from inside.  It made him smile.
Harry’s mouth flapped like a fish several times before finally managed a “Yes.  You were.  Being a prat.”
Yes, that was it.  He had imagined it all.  Because when – in his right mind – had Harry ever reached out to Draco without reason?  Not in order to save his life or cling blindly to someone in a panic, but just because he genuinely wanted to touch?
He took a swig of butterbeer.  “I ended up leaving after about nine months and found a job.”  His mind slithered over Morpheus’, refusing to linger, and landed on his equally terrible prospects at the Quidditch ring job.  “Several, actually.”
When, at last, Harry awoke, Draco had gone through a lifetime’s worth of grief, anger, disappointment, and disillusionment.  His boyfriend’s consciousness was a welcome distraction.
“Yeah.  It wasn’t a great year for anyone, I think.  Unless you count Amycus and Alecto,” he joked, but the sardonic humor failed to curve either of their lips into a smile.  It was still too raw to think about.  Maybe it would always be.
With sudden clarity, he wondered if Potter had ever felt like this.  Even as a boy, he’d always looked so confident, so defiant that surely…  But if it were Draco, he wouldn’t have wanted anyone to see his weakness either.
Harry continued to cover his face with his arm, though Draco could see the glow of his blazing skin peeking out.  “I mean, not
“I, uh, don’t really know yet,” he managed.  “Still trying to figure that part out.”  He clenched his bottle in shame, the Gryffindor in him cringing at the non-answer.  He might not know everything about himself, but the bit that liked Malfoy was at least, at this point, undeniable.
Malfoy’s gaze, of course, landed on Harry with the smug beginnings of a smirk.  “Potter!  Fancy seeing you here.”
Draco repressed the urge to say.  He’d already seen the memo she’d posted in the staffroom earlier today.
Draco finished with the buttons, his shirt hanging in two even lines.  Harry’s eyes ran greedily across the silvered scars on his chest, hesitating a moment over his necklace that held the Malfoy signet ring.  Emboldened by the obvious perusal, Draco moved next to his cufflinks – relishing the way Harry’s eyes narrowed at the stalling.
“Have you heard, Mister Malfoy?  We’re resurrecting it!  It went dormant for years, after all, since they couldn’t garner enough interest.  But that doesn’t seem to be a problem
.  Something like friendship, or a time you were proud of an accomplishment, or-” his eyes caught Draco’s from across the room, “love.”
Harry smiled.  “Oh, that’ll change for sure.  Don’t you know that we Gryffindors are required to skip everywhere we go?”
She gave off the impression of a smile, though her lips hardly moved.  “I’m just stating a fact.  You must be pleased.”  She took a sip.  “How are things with Professor Potter?”
.  Then, the memories inundated him, and that long stretch of nightmare expanded to fill his vision.  He couldn’t see anything else.
Slytherin?  In his long years of pining, Draco had comforted himself only with the impossibility of his fantasies, that he was free to dwell on them without action, as the two of them were simply
She gave him a flat look and an eye roll and then finally continued casting about the pitch.  “Just tell me you’re not taking it lightly,” she said after several moments had passed by in silence.
“Alright, we’re here.  Now what do we do?” Blaise asked, hitting a key on one of the machines.  An eerie blue light filled the box and, squinting, Draco read the word on the screen.
I thought we were moving past that?”  Draco hadn’t quite intended it in coming here, but he allowed a bit of pleading to slip into his tone.
Draco took a moment to admire the delicious embarrassment coloring the man’s face.  He couldn’t help but keep poking at him, drawing attention to that inherent scruffiness that, Salazar be damned, he found so perversely attractive.  “Also, you’ve got lint – right there.  That’s another thing wrong with your attire today.  Doesn’t really exude professionalism, that.”
to finish up this story by the end of the year (god knows, you've all been very patient), but we'll see what life brings.  Thank you again to everyone who's been following it.
“Can I?” Harry asked, gesturing towards his room, and the far-away logic in the back of Draco’s mind agreed that yes, they should do this behind closed doors.  Less chance of Skeeter getting ahold of the inevitably kind rejection.
Draco shifted in his seat – partially to redistribute Harry’s weight and partially to ease him off the crux of his boner.  He was sure he looked just as ruffled as he felt.  “I see what you’re doing,” was all he managed to mumble.
“Great,” the lady continued flatly.  “Next question.  Have you, to your knowledge, either willingly or unwillingly broken the parole agreement set to you by the Wizengamot on June the twenty-first of the year 1998?”
GINNY: It’s not nearly done!  I’m going to run out of time…  [She glances around at the stations around her where the other bakers are patiently waiting for their breads.  DRACO pulls his out of the oven, and it is perfectly golden-brown and ready.]  *
VOLDEMORT: Let’s just hope it tastes as good as it looks.  [He seems subtly irritated by the grandiosity of the gesture – like the audience will crucify him if he’s too critical of such a romantic enterprise.]
Draco clenched his silverware tight enough for it to bend, and he wished – not for the first time over family dinner – that his fork was a wand instead.  “Yes, and what an
It happened on a drafty night in early April, wind whistling through the cracks of The White Wyvern’s imperfectly mounted front door.  Draco was in a somber mood, sipping on a beer that tasted vaguely of piss (but that the barmaid, Gloria, had slid him for free) after returning from one of his rare ventures beyond the tavern.  He had gone glamoured, of course – not that it mattered.  What he was realizing now, as he reflected, was that people didn’t have to be cruel to you for you to feel as if the world was cruel; the world just had to dazzle you with wonders no longer meant for you.
“Oh.”  Malfoy took a sip of his own drink – a spiked carrot juice, by the looks of it.  Harry made note of the information under the dubious assumption that it may someday come in handy.  “And what is that?”
demands it, so I have no choice but to obey.”  He waved jauntily and took that moment to link arms with Harry as a means of maneuvering him out.
His emotions must have been showing on his face, because Gloria brushed a gentle hand over his forehead.  “What’s wrong?  Did I miss a spot?”
prepared for was the way Malfoy surged into the kiss like he’d been waiting for it all night.  His hands shot out to tangle in Harry’s hair, and before he could question it, Harry was doing the same.
The past two years had been utterly abysmal.  That much, he could say with absolute certainty.  He had watched his home fall into ruin, his family torn into drifting constellations of pain, and he had endured worse treatment and humiliation than he had ever experienced in his life.  But the worst part about all of this was that no matter how awful these past two years had been, they were still not the

Potter blustered for a few seconds, trying – and failing – to wipe the guilt from his face.  “None of your business, Malfoy!” he said at last.
VOLDEMORT: [holds one up and flicks at the bottom] Crisp – that’s good.  Let’s start with the savory.
Draco drew back slightly, trying to school his expression into something of the deviousness that Harry seemed to enjoy from him the most.  He owed it to Harry to make this good – the man did so much for him on a daily basis.  Even Harry’s presence here beside him was a gift, and Draco was beyond taking things like that for granted.
He felt eyes on him and raised his head to find Harry standing at the threshold.  “Really, Potter?  Lurking in doorways now?”  He gave the man a once-over.  “Are you ready to admit you’re stalking me yet?”

The double doors burst open as several students wandered through.  Harry and Draco sprang apart as if scalded.
“It’s okay, Potter.  I know you’re embarrassed – after all, ‘mimicry is the first form of flattery…” he trailed off, distracted by the sweet curve of Potter’s lips.  The man kept doing this
He allowed the news to roll over him, then he snorted at the whiplash this day was giving him.  “Of course they’re getting married – about bloody time, too.”
Harry was opening his trousers now, reaching beneath that first layer to grasp him through his pants.
, and you gave me a position in the back where you could use me to feel superior!  That’s no different than the ‘Death Eater scum’ you condemn.”
“Please,” Harry whispered, the request breaking Draco as the man arched against his fingers with lust.
CEDRIC: So I’m planning my 3D landscape around the fields and tent where we are now, with me and Cho in the center.  I’m actually going to use this piece to propose to her, so the gingerbread-me will be holding up the real engagement ring to gingerbread-Cho amidst a winter wonderland.
McGonagall finished her speech and dismissed everyone, but when he glanced up, he saw her coming straight for him.
Draco smiled, sure that he’d gone all doe-eyed and sappy again, and said, “No, no – you first.  Remember, I’m treating, so get whatever you want.”  It was indulgent, and he knew it; he never suspected that he’d become someone who indulged others.
Her narrowed gaze flickered between Harry and Draco.  Finally, they landed on him to stay.  “And if I were to ask those questions about your relationship?  What might you answer?”
to-”  The last thing he wanted was for Harry to feel obligated and then grow to regret it later.  “I’m not going to make you, just because I’m-”
He smirked at Potter’s visible panic, and then the man was whirling to look at the sign that Draco was tapping idly with his fingers.  Distress looked so delicious on him.
“G-good,” he choked out, eyes squeezing shut.  “And then…I thought of you pushing me down onto the desk.  How hot that was.”  He bit his lip before continuing, as if telling himself he couldn’t say whatever came next, before his foolish Gryffindor bravery kicked in.  “How I wanted you to throw me down and fuck me.”
,” he muttered over and over again.  And that was what finally snapped Draco from his silence.  That Potter would attempt
Draco stirred his tea reproachfully as he sat sprawled across the couch – now alone in Harry’s chambers.  He knew he didn’t have a monopoly on Harry’s time, and he certainly didn’t want to deprive him of his friends, but a part of him couldn’t help but be exasperated by this turn of events that left him Harry-less in Harry’s room during the only span of hours that they’d both be free this week; in the afternoon, Draco was due at the Manor for his weekly visit with his parents.
Draco nearly laughed aloud in revelation.  It felt incredible – that these hands that had thrown spells and punches at Harry could also wring out such pleasure felt unbelievable; that he could know someone’s body so intimately, an unforeseen miracle.
“Harry, you don’t have to over-explain things. I’m not daft, you little manky prat arsehole wanker bolluck tossing git. Anyway, seeing as you’re a plonker and all, I’ll tell you right and ready, I reckon.
how you ask someone to dance,” Draco whispered smugly to him, and something about that just rankled Harry enough to possess him to do what he did next.  Something about that supercilious tone, the way he looked like he’d won
At five minutes past the hour, Malfoy appeared in the courtyard, looking deep in thought until he noticed Harry sitting cross-legged on the wall and did a double take.  “Potter?”
GINNY: [confessional aside] It’s a little annoying to be going home so early, yeah.  But at least I can say I made it further than Ron!  [She laughs.]  No, but it was a fun experience, and I just got too frustrated with the fiddly bits to continue on.  Also, I don’t think Minerva and Voldemort liked my red chili pineapple panettone!
He waited for Harry to nod again before easing down and pressing in.  Harry’s brows were furrowing in discomfort, so Draco snatched his lips in another kiss – praying it would be enough to relax him.  Even with just the crown sliding in, it was easily the most pleasurable thing Draco had ever felt.
Malfoy clenched his jaw to keep from snapping back.  He had little patience for the insults, but he had to make this seem like Peeves’ idea for it to work.

, it was all he could see wherever life shuffled him next.  The following year, it had been the Manor – with the Dark Lord pacing the floors.  Then the Wizengamot.  Then the Manor again.  Then all the pitiful jobs that he’d barely managed to obtain in order to escape his former home.
She snorted at his expression.  “Come now, Draco.  Did you think your romantic overtures from the last few weeks were
.  Though, I can’t say it’s going quite how I’d hoped.”  That much was true enough – on the days that he didn’t have flying classes to teach, he often found himself wandering down to the labs while Harry taught his own courses, hoping for a pleasant distraction.  But the
Insides screaming, Draco aimed his wand at the girl and made his eyes follow.  Her face was just as terrified and broken as he remembered.  And as soon as he acknowledged that, all the other details came rushing back.
His back arched in pain as he found yet another bruise creeping up his hip.  He’d fallen hard – possibly twenty feet?  And he’d been going fast; the Green Flash had become his signature broom.  He’d gotten used to its speed for the most part, though he was still adjusting to the momentum at which he could be knocked from it.
Potter was silent for a long time, and, as such, it was quiet enough for him to hear the man swallowing.  “What did she say?” he asked at last.  Warily, like he didn’t want to give away anything that wasn’t already known and ashamed of whatever was.  His face was doing that brooding thing where his eyebrows drew together and made him look both intimidating and also a bit like a kicked crup.
He twitched.  “Yes, actually, you do.”  He was tired of playing games.  “In this very roundabout way, you intend to inspect how ‘suitable’ Harry is, and whether he has the capability to acclimate to
did you write this?  And over a month ago, too!  We weren’t even…even…”  He made a gesture here that Draco supposed implied “fucking – or on the complicated road to it, anyways.”
The pudding squished between Draco’s fingers as he ran his hand up Harry’s engorged cock. Draco pulled the cup off the tip of Harry’s dongus and squeezed a little bit of pre cum into it. He licked the inside of the pudding cup clean and began to bring his head down to Harry’s huge dick. He began by slowly licking the chocolate off the tip. Harry winced with pleasure.
for my cock.”  He no longer knew if it was roleplay or a line he’d thought up at sixteen before he’d banned such dangerous thoughts altogether.
“Do they?” Draco countered quickly.  “Do they deserve to know every personal detail of someone else’s life?”  He scowled, thinking of Harry the morning after the Ball – hand trembling slightly while holding out that day’s
“I don’t get you,” she said after a long pause.  “Why come back here after everything that went down?”
“I’m making buttons,” Harry said, stamping out a new one with the cute little hand-press Hermione had given him.  “Want one?”  He pointed to the chest pocket of the jean jacket he was wearing – one of Sirius’ old ones – that now had about fifty pins splayed across the front.
“Or what?” Lucius taunted, nostrils flaring in anger despite the carelessness of his tone.  “You’ll get him to send me to Azkaban?
Harry wanted to pick apart the possible meanings in that, but Parkinson leaned forward just then to ask, “Potter…trying something new, are you?”  Her face was flashing between shock and amusement.
– and the thought never failed to startle him.  It seemed already a lifetime since he’d left the school a battleground.
But right now, what was most important was Harry.  Steeling himself, he resolved to go find him as soon as he’d cleaned up.
“Are you going to go visit?” Harry asked again when Friday was winding down into evening.  He spoke casually, like he might be able to slip the question in without Draco noticing and therefore get a different answer.
at me through meals, following me into the bathroom for Merlin’s sake!  I could barely find a bloody moment alone.”
Undoubtedly, he was testifying against him.  Draco was sure of it.  He ground his teeth as he looked up at The Savior of the Wizarding World with his unkempt hair and muggle jeans.  Was winning the war not enough - he had to come rub it in his face that Draco had chosen wrong and make sure he went straight to Azkaban?
“No,” he reiterated.  “Because…of coming out.  It’s like, I’m just figuring it all out myself, and then suddenly I have to explain it to the world.  The same world where a lot of people aren’t understanding or accepting – especially in Wizarding society.  And I know what I feel, but I don’t have the words to say it; I’m not good at explaining things like Hermione.”
“Or your perfect, perfect hair.”  Harry was breathing hard now, like the words were taking something out of him.  Maybe
“Where are-” He broke off as a wheeze overtook him, his breaths uncontrollably loud in the quiet room.
It was well-known that while wizards had an easier time brewing and overseeing Potions production (what with stasis charms and all that), any half-minded Squib could manage.  It wasn’t particularly hard to purchase a self-igniting burner or pre-pickled ingredients.  And Potions was the one subject Draco had always done well enough in to feel confident despite his current handicap.  Getting a job in the field would be easy, he’d thought.
Sam hung back after class, which Draco assumed would be for Harry, so he was quite surprised when the boy came over to whisper something in his ear.
What he truly feared had gone wrong was his disastrous attempt at flirting.  He’d said too much, far too soon – he’d pushed Potter away in reeling him closer.  It was everything he’d warned himself not to do and also what kept him up at night, petrified that it would happen.
The man froze for a long moment, staring at his hand, then reluctantly gripped it to shake once, twice, then quickly release.  “I’ve been well,” he managed.
Draco crept closer to the cabinet, casting muffling charms so it wouldn’t alert anyone.  Technically speaking, even though he was a teacher, he still wasn’t supposed to be wandering around the castle without a patrolling shift.  It would look suspicious if he was caught – and suspicion was something he had to avoid at all costs, given the circumstances.  But, as usual, his desire to one-up Potter eclipsed even the barest of common sense.
– the man still stumbled blindly through his day-to-day routine, not even seeming to realize that someone was pranking him.  After all, who would dare toy with
“Which you assured me would look horrendous and laughable, yes.”  Draco must’ve been feeling particularly cruel, because anyone with eyes could tell that that wasn’t what the Savior thought now.
His hand fell to his crotch, slipping beneath the fabric of his pants to grip himself.  Hell, this was wrong on so many levels, but the
He got up and began to pace, until he stalled in front of the mirror again.  What would students see when they looked at him in a class dedicated to reviling Dark arts?  What would
“Hermione had hit me with a stinging hex right before, so my face was all swollen.  But it was still clearly me.  Malfoy - err, Draco, that is, not Lucius - definitely would have known.”
Draco eyed the giant “H” on the front and couldn’t help but snort.  “Well, combined with your electrocuted hair, you look like a veritable vagabond.”
“Oh, so you’re gay then?”  The way she asked – so curious, so free of judgment – made him blink his eyes back open.  “I have some news that might interest you then.”
He was so focused on his dread, body stiff with tension, that he didn’t notice the next witness until the judge announced him.  “The next witness in the trial of Draco Lucius Malfoy, accused on account of treachery and known involvement with Death Eaters, is one Harry James Potter, former classmate of the defendant.”
But as he helped a young Muggleborn girl keep her broom from swerving, he began to notice an underlying nervousness on the pitch.  She, like several other Muggleborns in the class, kept flicking her eyes to the more experienced flyers with an expression akin to envy, but far less self-confident.
It was a fruitless endeavor, a pipe dream – for he knew he could not unsee the blood as it soaked into the wood.  Something had changed in him that moment – a realization of a most unsettling parallel – as he saw their heirloom furniture drink in every greedy drop.
Draco froze with the fork halfway to his mouth.  Until this moment, he hadn’t even considered that they’d
Draco only noticed his own hands hovering by Harry’s head when the man himself glanced up and asked, “What is it?”

Draco’s knuckles went white as he clenched his silverware in a death grip.  “Don’t talk about him like that.”
Harry chose to deliver his next diversionary tactic while plucking at loose threads on his jumper.  “We can discuss it later, if you want.”
The kiss was harsh and wet and meant only as a precursor.  Grant’s large, scarred hands began peeling back his clothing, and Draco tried to lose himself in it.  He was sick to death of feeling ashamed and hidden and
It opened a world of possibilities for them, and he intended to make the most of it.  Yes – he would stay the night.  He might just stay forever.
“I just…  I mean, we haven’t even talked about what we want to say to them, so I didn’t want to be blindsided, and-”
After a moment, Ron entered the communal bathroom from their dorm, eyes widening at the sight.  “Oh, whoa!  That looks even better than I thought!”  He looked like he genuinely believed it, too, so Harry held off on killing him just yet.
A meaty hand clapped down on his shoulder, the edges of its grimy fingernails coming into view.  “Oh, I think you’ll find there
There was something so sinister in seeing Nagini in that bubble next to the Dark Lord.  The way she floated and thrashed, no longer bound by gravity’s weighted expectations.

All of our relationship takes place after we’d grown up as people, and the flirting came from a place of mutual interest.  Which is another thing Sam didn’t get to have.”

[Cut to the footage of the 12 contestants’ first time in the tent.  Almost everyone appears cheery, and there’s a palpable energy flowing across the room.  We cut again to a montage of beautiful pies and dramatized shots of our friendly bakers putting them together.  LUNA LOVEGOOD presents a pie to the camera that is bright turquoise with luminescent candy hummingbirds arranged across the top, while DRACO trims his crusts with an exacting precision.

it, frankly.  But once Hermione had found out (she’d asked about it specifically, of course, with a plotting glint in her eye all the while), she had become insistent that he use it.
“What kinds of things does it make you say?”  Harry pressed.  “Also, who are you even testing this on?”
“Draco, please,” Harry choked out.  “Please, not again,” and something in Draco broke at those words.
“You’re so predictable, Potter.”  His answers were on autopilot, which, when he was so worked up like this, was probably a bad idea.  Far too revealing.  “Still thinking everything is black and white, and no one outside of Gryffindor is worth your while.”
And just like that, Harry succeeded in playing dumb to seduce his man.  It worked for him countless times thereafter, and – despite Hermione’s disdain – became a favorite technique of his that would last throughout the decades.
– wandering through this house kept as a museum of their former lives, in which every exhibit held nothing but fear and lies and dust?  It was insanity, and he was beginning to feel more like he’d died in the war than survived it.
Thinking about Potter was always the worst kind of masochism he could inflict on himself – far worse even than answering his mother’s letters – because everything he could remember was rooted so firmly in the past.  He hadn’t
Draco stifled a wave of initial disappointment, but then refocused on the feeling of Harry hardening even further beneath his hand.
The whole team was drunk on their win and therefore unwilling to let him escape the imminent merriment.  It’d been clinched when Fenn glanced coyly at Braxton, who had appeared expectantly at her side, size dwarfing both her
She analyzed his face a bit more, seeming to find something that pleased her, as she broke into a wide smile.  “Well, after Harry had brought you up several times, Ginny didn’t seem too pleased about the turn in conversation, so she essentially told him to ‘fuck off and go sit in on one of your classes’ – if you’ll pardon my language.”
Bagman gave him a few seconds to stare before pushing him in the direction of the stands, where he saw a whole wall’s selection of brooms.  He had to shout to be heard over the noise – and all he could manage then was a perplexed “who
VOICE-OVER: Cedric learned to love baking from an early age from his father, Amos, and now shares that passion with his girlfriend, Cho.  He is a senior at Hogwarts Culinary Institute in Scotland and has received multiple job offers from patisseries in both France and Switzerland for when he graduates.  Still deciding where he’d like to go, Cedric is enjoying his remaining days at school and relaxes by volunteering at the local reptile-and-migratory-birds animal shelter and playing racquetball with his friends.  Last year, he also started a nonprofit that focuses specifically on feeding hungry Labradors in Liverpool, and he continues to oversee that on the weekends.  In addition to his own charity, he also fundraises for several other tertiary charities like Orphans of Liverpool, Liverpool Healthcare for All™, and the ‘Let’s Make Bridge Club Exciting Again’ Granny Club of Liverpool.  An honors student through and through, Cedric also runs his own tutoring service at Hogwarts Culinary, which services over 200 students each semester!  [aside] Busy boy, isn’t he?
Bagman leaned in again, his eyes narrowing slightly as he finally got to his point.  “For the little games I’m running.  Just a bit of Quidditch – a bit of innocent fun.  Though, it can be lucrative if you play your cards
Harry licked his lips in suspense as his mouth watered waiting for what he loved most in the world: the creamy, thicc, TRUTH.
Draco looked up from the book, where he’d been waiting him out.  “Oh, I’m glad you asked.  She said something about your desire to watch me teach – to ‘sit in on some of my classes.’”  He snapped the book shut and watched Potter jump.  He smiled.  “The word ‘obsessive’ may or may not have been mentioned.”

“No, no, I didn’t mean it like that, I just meant you have pretty balls in the way they so delicately hang beside your UNCIRCUMCISED cock,” he said apologetically. “I have no right to make fun of your testicles; at least yours are symmetrical. Mine right one hangs at least an inch below my left one. It’s really messed up. I think there’s some kind of pulley device in there, cause if I pull my left nut, the right one comes up - and vice versa!”
It wasn’t like this job would lead to other shining opportunities – at most, he could work up his reputation as a shady, Knockturn potions brewer, and likely not even that, as he wasn’t allowed to be

Draco blinked, startled by the sudden confidences Bagman seemed willing to pour out to someone he’d only met a few times as a boy.  He nodded.
“Well it’s not…” Harry sat up, dignified, speaking in a much more precise and calculated tone. “I mean, as a teacher, it is my right to know every interaction that occurs in my classroom. It’s necessary for the safety and wellbeing of my students.”
Slughorn at least had the grace to look sheepish about it all, but Draco was cursed once again with feelings of sympathy that prevented him from appreciating the situation with the full extent of his pettiness.  Potter would be proud of him for his sudden magnanimity; if Potter ever looked at or spoke to him again, that is.
VOLDEMORT: Remember what I’ve been telling you: quality over quantity.  If you present me with 36 biscuits all with soggy bottoms, then you’ll be giving up the competition before the other challenges even start.
This time, at least, he wasn’t doing anything nearly so masochistic as facing a boggart to earn a mild annoyance from Potter the following day.  This time, he was
He heard the clack of a gavel as another testimony came to a close.  If they had any mercy, it would be the last one.  His hands ached from clutching the arms of the chair until his knuckles shone ghostly white in the dim room.  Maybe the trial would end here.
I am indeed alive (and should be getting back into my writing routine more now that summer is ending).  Sorry again to everyone who's still reading along and has to wait between chapters!  Hope you enjoy this one.
He found himself pressing his wand to Potter’s sternum, his hand somehow steady amidst this rush of adrenaline.

He answered his own question without words, as he dragged his nails down Harry’s thighs – punishing him for the offer he’d been forced to refuse outside.  He ran his hands across Harry’s hips, liking the
[Cut back to the tent, where CEDRIC is sipping merrily at his cup of tea as he rolls out his dough, while HARRY and DRACO are furiously evening their fillings with palette knives.]
Draco willed the cashier to answer, to simply take the money in his outstretched hand and be done with it, though he dreaded it was already too late to escape.
And even though he was completely engaged in this, he sensed rather than saw the moment Potter reappeared on the pitch.  It was like he’d trained himself to notice the slightest hint that he was near.
Draco sat chained to a chair in the middle of Courtroom 10.  He had been there for nearly three hours, hearing testimony after testimony until he could no longer distinguish words over the swelling guilt.  It rung in his ears like ghostly echoes of malicious voices.  Voices like Aunt Bella’s who told him he was
The man’s name was Morpheus, and he hadn’t offered a last name.  The first time Draco came around, he’d started like he always did – with ethos.  Tried to convince Morpheus of his talents and good grades.  When that had proven dissatisfactory, he’d pivoted to logos, explaining how his unsavory background in Dark arts would help him determine which customers were out to cheat them.
Draco’s breath rushed out of him in a sigh.  He supposed he was past the point at which he could lie and pretend to be okay.  “Not great.”
,” Morpheus took a threatening step closer, “I took you in when no one else was willing to do it.  Did I like it?
Potter obliged, but since he was a prat, he did some fancy spin on the way.  Clearly, he was unaffected by the encounter.
He could hear Harry grumbling in the locker room behind him, and he let out a small laugh before boarding his broom to join the game.
DRACO: It takes at least two hours to chill the dough before you can bake it, so we’ve got a bit of waiting time.  I’ll work on my fillings, of course, but I can’t make the cream too far in advance, or it’ll deflate.
Being different was a terrible feeling; it took time and suffering to get used to.  Throw love into the mix, and it was a volatile compound.  The worst feeling in the world was fearing that your love would hate you if they knew who you truly were.
It was a weak distraction, but Harry’s hands flew to Draco’s fly nonetheless.  Like he’d been waiting for exactly that permission.  He tore Draco’s pants down the second he’d gotten them open and took him to the root with one graceless gulp.
“Well, I-”  He was clearly caught off guard by such directness.  “I’d like to know about your relationship with Mister Potter here.”
Draco wanted to say something to comfort him – to promise nothing bad would come of this news – but he
It was cringey and cliché and adorable, and Draco wanted to break character for a minute to squeeze him in a tight hug.  He didn’t – but Merlin, he was tempted.
HARRY: [confessional] Malfoy’s a bit…uptight, to say the least.  We don’t get along at school, no.  There’ve been several incidents in which he’s called me a ‘classless orphan’ or insulted Molly’s recipes, and I’ve sort of lost it at him.  He doesn’t get along with our classmates very well either – I think it has something to do with being raised by a pair of rich restaurant tycoons with the expectation that he will inherit their culinary kingdom someday soon…  It’s
in a way that Draco couldn’t remember him ever being back in school, and he wondered whether it was simply the Dark Lord’s looming shadow that had prevented it - or if it was something more.
He startled to see, this time, Potter staring back at him.  The man must have been looking for a while, because he didn’t seem intent to break his gaze, even when Draco noticed.
Harry was mid-spasm when it happened.  He was against the wall, water streaming into his eyes and splattering the glasses he hadn’t even bothered to take off, body held firmly in place by two hands and a wicked, wicked tongue.
“He was more the one being taken,” Draco pointed out helpfully, and Harry quelled the urge to scream.
, you know?  Cakes.  I haven’t studied them nearly as much as some of the other desserts and breads I’ve made… If I’m being quite honest, I’m relieved – I was only trying so hard because my boyfriend’s mum is the ‘baking sweetheart of Great Britain.’  It puts pressure on me to do better, when I’d much rather be spending this time practicing for important things like my medical school exams.  [She purses her lips and thinks.]  Perhaps I’ll drop my extracurricular classes at Hogwarts Culinary after all – it’s not getting me anywhere, clearly, if all my dishes are ‘boring’ and ‘uninspired.’
The Three Broomsticks was moderately crowded, seeing as it was noon and in the midst of its lunch rush.  Harry wasted no time in pulling them into a discreet corner booth, eyes roving to catalogue any unwanted audience, and then relaxing enough to engage in romantic date conversations like “what did
turn to look.  He knew it was an invasion of privacy, but he was gripped with the overpowering need to know what Potter feared.  What
Words were getting easier for Draco now.  “Hey, Potter – my students told me an interesting rumor.”  He looked Potter up and down, letting his gaze slide fluidly down that delectable form.  “They said you copied my costume.”
The sentiment had startled Draco into showering for nearly an hour after he’d gone, unable to scrub away the shame prickling at his flesh.
“Alright,” he agreed at the same moment Mother said, “No, please stay.”  His eyes snapped to her.  He catalogued the steely resolve coalescing in her expression.
It didn’t help matters that they were constantly around each other nowadays – when Draco wasn’t teaching, he was up in Harry’s office, and when Harry

The “perfect thing” was guyliner, as it turned out.  Guyliner and black nail polish.  Hermione, after giving him a dissertation on why it was really “just eyeliner” because “it’s senseless to assign gender to makeup,” applied both with the steady hand of an expert – something Harry was not expecting – and by the time she was done with him, he wondered for the first time what
Pansy waited a whole five seconds before breaking into muffled snorts.  “That was good, Draco.  Convincing.  Maybe someday you’ll actually
“Nothing, no reason,” Draco said immediately.  He paused, unsure how much of his ugly inner thoughts to convey.  “I just wasn’t sure you’d want to take me to anyplace…Muggle.  Given my history.”
“He’s dressed as a vampire!” Kat emphasized, wiggling her eyebrows at him.  “Unless it wasn’t a ‘steal’ and was actually a
No matter – he would lure him.  He drew Harry in with a smirk that promised he knew exactly what he was doing.  “They can wait five minutes,” he declared.
“Draco, my dear boy!  Do you have any idea how the students will interpret this?”  He threw his hands up in wild gesticulation.  “They’ll be absolute
They’d made good headway today, Draco decided, as he strolled back into Harry’s office.  Good enough that he felt the end was in sight – perhaps the next experiment, even, could be the one to succeed-

This was fine - everything was fine.  He was used to this.  Draco just had to do well in his teaching, and everything else would fall into place.
“I’m listening,” Harry said, eyes glazed like he wasn’t really.  “I just don’t care.  I would drop down and blow you right now if you wanted me to.”
He barred Harry in with an arm across his chest, leaning his whole weight into it, so Harry couldn’t move.  “So you annoyed me
“‘Can I help you?’” he mocked.  “Yes – you damn well know you can!  Why don’t you spread yourself across the nearest sink, so I can fucking
on Malfoy’s face?  Whatever it was, he couldn’t bear it.  He sped from the room, not bothering to wonder how it looked to their audience.
Draco rolled his eyes at the sarcasm – though, inside, he thoroughly appreciated it – then couldn’t help a wave of somberness overtaking him as he admitted, “I was a bit surprised.  I didn’t realize you had gotten permission to use the Floo.  Though, I suppose it makes sense that McGonagall wouldn’t offer me that privilege – I don’t have a great history with letting people into the castle.”
“Oh?” he managed, searching his memories of the past few days to see if he’d said or done something dreadful.
McGonagall merely raised a brow and ignored the obvious implications.  “I’m afraid not, Harry.  The first game of the season is tomorrow – as I’m sure you’re well aware.”
“I knew you’d flip when you read it,” he admitted, since Harry had yet to say anything.  That worried him, and so he filled the silence with explanation, hoping to lure some reaction from the man in turn.  “
Harry nodded, scratching the back of his neck, which was shaved and fuzzy beneath his hand.  Ron had insisted that “all the hip gays had undercuts these days,” so they’d gone with that in addition to the bubble-gum hair color charm this morning.
It took Potter four days to catch on, which was a little dim – even by his standards.  The day after he’d put it up, Draco had come to breakfast almost anticipating a fight, but instead, he’d merely gotten to enjoy the expression of sheer disbelief on the man’s face when he realized Draco was sitting with Hannah.  He made it his goal to be unpredictable more often.

This time, the spell finally took, and her body froze into one of those gaudy Grecian statues that littered the Manor’s gardens.  It was the best he could manage at the moment.
he?  Even if it was only a fraction of the obsession Draco had for him, it made him feel tingly, like he’d pulled out of a successful spiral dive on the pitch.
So early the next week, he found himself across from his mother in a Diagon café, racking his brains for something neutral to talk about.  And failing rather spectacularly.
the maliciousness Draco was capable of spoke volumes of the trust he must’ve had to let him anyway.  That he let Draco undo him seemed somehow secondary to this quiet concession.
FRED: Ahh, eloquent as always!  Well, if that’s all, you and Minerva had best be off so we can get down to business.  [He shoos them out the back of the tent, teasing, ‘Begone witch!’ and ‘Begone foul creature!’ at intervals.  The judges take this with begrudging amusement and an awkward lack of haste.]
“It…” Draco started, quite unsure how to continue.  “It was just supposed to be a prank.”  The words sounded pathetic and inexcusable on his lips.  “We had a second boggart – the one from the cabinet.  I hadn’t really released it, just stored it somewhere else, you know.  So when some Slytherins heard you guys were using a boggart, we came up with this plan where it would seem like it had escaped and everything had gone wrong, because the ‘realness’ would make it scarier.”
The second point threw him off more than he cared to admit, as he suddenly found himself with an unobstructed view of those emotional, emerald eyes.
“Fine,” he spat, teeth grinding.  “Usual stakes?”  He stood from his stool with faked confidence, moving to turn around until a wand pressed quietly against his head.
“Draco, I know that we’ve given you no reason to come home for Christmas this year…but I’m asking you to consider it.  I know he’s twisted the words, but it may truly be his last year, and I-” she broke off with a pained look flashing across her face.  “I don’t know if I could bear it alone.”
“Good.  Now, more specifically: have you, in the past eighteen months – the period outlined in your sentence - performed any magic whatsoever?”
Walters had knocked him off his broom on purpose.  That much was exceedingly clear.  But there had been no foul, no
Draco pressed him even harder into the lockers.  “And you did so with the express intent to ‘get my attention,’ when you
Potter blinked a few times, eyes darting up from Draco’s neck as he responded.  “Yeah, well, unlike you, I had to work.”
“Yeah, you could say that.”  The voice was gruff and low and, so far, unidentifiable.  “Let’s have a match, Malfoy.”
, but reigned it in at the last second with an angry pinch at the bridge of his nose.  “Unbelievable,” he muttered – because it
He was numb with guilt; and, as Potter approached him with that unforgiving glint in his eyes, Draco convinced himself he deserved whatever he got.
But could the younger kids handle a literal horror-house?  Thinking back on himself at age eleven, Draco knew he would’ve hated it.  Unless some cool, older student had managed to talk him into it…like Fenn was in the process of doing now.
A flicker of something akin to pitied amusement stole across Slughorn’s face.  “Good night, Draco.”  The door shut swiftly behind him.
MINERVA:  Absolutely scrummy.  Let’s try the chocolate.  [They each bite into a chocolate rugelach.]  Wonderful taste – the peppermint is coming through nicely.
Hannah barked a laugh.  “No, you’re right.  He does have quite the fan club, doesn’t he?  Now, I just indulge him when he brings some twiggy tree in from the cold and convinces me it can’t survive unless we replant it in our home.”
[DRACO blushes inexplicably at the phrasing but works steadily at stamping out spires for his building.  As he works, he accumulates an impressive spread of biscuits and begins baking several trays in order to free up more room at his station.]
Harry began to sob – more hiccupping breaths than tears – and Draco stroked him through it all until he finally began to relax.  But as his breathing calmed, a new tension alighted in his spine.
“-still be mixing up his teeth-cleaning and bubblehead charms,” Narcissa cut in with a pointed look at her husband.  “Being old does not make us wise, Lucius.”
that more than anything.  “By all means, Potter,” he dared, “tell me something funny about it.  I’ve been looking for a bright side for hours.”
Things were…peaceful, in a strange and unexpected way.  And in the better moments, Draco could just let his head fall back on the emerald velvet of his chair and enjoy the thousand tiny details that made his life so much better than it had ever been before.  The things he wouldn’t let himself take for granted.
He ordered another firewhisky.  It didn’t escape his notice the way the bartender slid him the drink with a look of disgust.
“Yeah,” Longbottom responded easily.  “I mean, I don’t know for sure, but they’ve been a bit off-sorts the past few times I’ve seen them together, so I’m just speculating here.  Maybe Hannah’s heard more?”
Draco stared into the fading embers of the hearth.  It had been nearly an hour since his mother’s letter had arrived, and yet one distinctive line kept playing in his mind: “I’m sorry, Draco.  I’ve kept your father at bay so far – but this time, it’s just too much.  Come by the Manor as soon as you’re done breakfast.  He wants to talk with you.”
The directions were nonsensical at this stage of the process – it was ruined – but he did as he was told with hopes it would be worth it.
“Okay,” he murmured, feeling rather sheepish about his reasons why.  He would try – there was no reason he could think of that he shouldn’t.
“Oh, Merlin, is there someone in there with you, then?  Let me guess…”  She paused for a moment, then gasped, sounding both disgusted and curious.  “Tell me it’s not Draco Malfoy.”
Harry scrambled to undo his jeans – the immediacy with which he moved startling Draco to full erectness.  Harry undid his belt first, tearing it free with a certain disregard that made Draco feel
He couldn’t help but flinch at the name.  Then, as the statement fully sank in, he furrowed his brow in confusion.  “Why…hate?  You were always flaunting how close you were.”  He tried to keep the bitterness of his childhood self out of his voice.
GEORGE: Now that we’ve dispelled the bad mojo from the room, it’s time to announce the challenge.  Are any of you familiar with ballet?
Draco felt the smirk curling across his face and hoped he didn’t look too smug for Harry to forgive him.
He was sure to say it casually, like it wasn’t a big deal – and to his relief, Jimmy just nodded, seeming eager to end this embarrassing spectacle.
Weasley toyed with the edge of his coaster, a sneaky smirk on his face as he pretended to recall something. “Oh, I distinctly remember him saying something about Draco ‘being
A phrase repeated incessantly in his mind, so he decided to say it aloud.  He had no barriers right now – all his Occlusion had been hacked out of him as well.  “I can’t forgive him.  I can’t forgive him.  I just can’t-”
He ran a hand down Harry’s chest, fingers catching on the scar in the middle of his sternum.  Starting there, he planted a trail of soft kisses from his collarbone to his nipple.
He didn’t look away, and so, neither could Draco.  After a few moments, the tension was unbearable, and Bagman burst in with, “It’s really not so dramatic as all that, Grant!  No need to scare the boy on his first day.  It’s only protocol, to keep things
, hesitated, they waited to call Voldemort to the Manor.  In the end, that gave us enough time to escape before he could come.  Therefore, if it hadn’t been for Draco, I would have been killed that night.”
.  He thinks his success is predicated upon talent, but in reality, it is built on luck and an unfortunate case of mass hysteria that led the public to view him as someone that many would feel compelled to describe as…‘
Startled, he met her eyes to find they’d taken on a considering look.  Under that gaze, he found he didn’t have the courage to lie – though, neither could he tell the truth.
that reduced the brewing period from eight months to six.  Merlin knows that was one of the only worthwhile advancements in the field of preestablished potions for close to a century.”
.”  When nothing happened, he bit his lip and cursed his lack of practice.  He’d always been shit at wandless magic – the only type he could manage was a decent bit of Occlumency, and only
He clapped a hand over his mouth in horror as her soft voice filtered through the stall door.  This couldn’t be happening – they’d broken up months ago, at the beginning of the year!  It had been
Draco spat at his feet, noting that that, too, was marbled with blood.  He felt sick – but also, sickly satisfied.  And, to be honest, that scared him.  “You disgust me.”
“So…” Draco started eventually, unsure how to even breach the subject.  “Perhaps you’ll listen to me next time?”
Soured as his thoughts were, he was barely paying attention as he agreed to call tonight’s match a draw.  He wouldn’t be able to focus after
Draco was intrigued.  What was Bagman doing here now?  Had he somehow dodged his debts?  He didn’t look supremely concerned about hiding – though, Draco supposed that perhaps the choice of pub was “hiding” enough, if his own decisions were at all similar.
The snake was suddenly encased in a large, protective bubble – and Draco felt his gut wrenching before he even could process
Ron passed him a bottle of spiked pumpkin juice (which was becoming a fad with the locals of Hogsmeade).  Harry popped off the cap with a twist and turned back to see Malfoy looking at him expectantly.
The elf glanced sharply up at him when he was finished.  “Mister Malfoy!  You is having turned Mister Potter’s meal into snakes!”
But apparently not to Harry, because his brow was doing that cute little furrowing thing, and he looked quite surprised as he articulated a “huh” and then, “I wish I had known that before I tried it for two years.”
He really didn’t – no one was using it anyway – and Potter said as much.  Draco brushed off his retort with another long-suffering remark, and then Potter was making this contorted face like he was trying really hard not to laugh.
He must’ve given himself away through his tone, because Harry’s hand tightened around the chain.  Then, they were kissing again with a fire, pressing secrets against tongues and lips and teeth.  He felt Harry maneuvering to flip around, and then he was straddling Draco with hands deep in his hair.
Harry, cheeks still full of candy, making a choking noise before he managed to swallow and regain his senses.  “Um…Treacle Fudge?” he asked, voice slightly hoarse.
He pressed his head against the cool glass and thought instead of the slight smile Gloria had given him when he’d handed his wand over this week.  Her eyes were usually filled with such pity and concern, and the change was startling enough to spark confidence in him.  If the barmaid had trusted that he would be okay now, then he supposed it was his duty to, as well.
[The montage has shifted to show precarious biscuits and little bits of icing breaking off.  The dramatic music has risen to fever pitch, and at the center of it, DRACO arranges his cathedral towers against the walls.  But the sugar isn’t taking.  Instead of cementing the pieces, they’re sliding, and the audience can only watch with bated breath at the collapse until-
could shed light on this situation.  Regardless.  What can I help you with this morning – if not something to do with Harry?”
Harry scowled fiercely up at him.  “You just want me to look ridiculous,” he grumbled, which Draco couldn’t deny.
FRED: Well, this is going to take a while, so let’s remember some of our fallen former contestants in the meantime, shall we?
“Oh – thumbs!  Of course!”  Harry slipped his thumbs into the sleeve-holes, expecting it to somehow complete the look, but instead he felt even more ridiculous than before – like he’d botched some spellwork and fused his gloves to his shirt.
He had put every ounce of innuendo he possessed into those last two words and was pleasantly rewarded by a ripe, vermilion flush spreading over Potter’s face.
Harry tensed.  “I, um, don’t see the point in rushing these decisions…unless, of course, you wanted to – which would be fine.  Or
[Cut to a shocked look on MINERVA’s face and the facsimile of a raised eyebrow on VOLDEMORT’s.  He has no noticeable hair on his body, and eyebrows are no exception.]
Blood pounding in his temples, Draco caught Harry’s chin in his grip and tilted his head up to look at him.  It was suddenly vital that he had Harry’s full attention.  “What, you like that, Potter?”
[Sound overlay of GEORGE announcing: ‘And the one going home this week…………..will be Hermione!  Sorry, love.’  She bursts into tears and hugs everyone except for VOLDEMORT, ARGUS, and SEVERUS.]
Jameson noticed immediately and dropped down to a similar altitude.  He was a good Seeker, after all, but Draco also knew he was easy to rile – he’d learned that from the sloppy aggression he’d fucked with after losing a match to Draco before.  So, after a handful of fake-outs chasing gold watches in the crowd or quaffle-tails, he saw Jameson move higher with a huff.
Malfoy led him on in a series of flashier and more complicated steps, and Harry realized that he’d been foolish to view dancing as inherently opposite of fighting.  They were fighting still—just in new and unexplored ways.
DRACO: [Turning smugly from his own work station with a rubber spatula held prominently in his grip.]  I needed an extra, and they always ply you with an excess of the best materials.
, but it’s also not the worst…which is good?”  Harry’s obvious discomfiture was something that harpies like his mother preyed upon in such social encounters.
Guilt rose large and jagged in his throat as he desperately sought to undo the damage he’d wrought.  “It was just part of the prank!
think is that he heard rumors of that article that was going to come out two days later about Malfoy’s dalliance with some French bloke a few months ago, and he decided to turn the tables on him!”
He glowered at Potter up on the stand.  All his life, Potter had snatched away everything he ever wanted from under him.  Fame.  Popularity.  Every winning Snitch.  Even his bloody
A handful of quills sunk into his leg before he came to enough to throw up a shield.  He bit off a cry of pain, stumbling back a step before regaining his footing.  It had been such an unexpected move for Potter, that he found his mind had blanked.  For the first time in a duel, he didn’t know what to cast.
VOLDEMORT: Right!  On to the next one.  [He peers imperiously down the tube of one of HARRY’s biscuits.]  Missing filling, this one.  [He looks at another.  Then another.]  They’re all missing filling – it looks like this baker ran out of time.
Harry jumped to his feet, calling, “Err, who is it?” as he spelled away their dinner mess.  He gestured frantically for Draco to stand.
Harry could feel his face heating up, and he looked desperately to his friends for guidance.  Ginny was watching avidly, like this was a semifinals Quidditch game, and Luna looked equally invested beside her.  Ron, on the other hand, was rolling his eyes and groaning something like “please no, Harry; you definitely don’t have to,” while Hermione scanned Harry’s face with concern before raising her eyebrows at whatever she found and visibly relaxing.
Draco fought down a smile in order to keep his face impassive.  “Oh, surely you know?  The ones about Potter.”
At Granger’s nod of encouragement, he continued.  “I’ve been trying to brew a potion that can mitigate – or even completely erase – the effects of
Yes, he had found out – from bits and pieces he’d gathered from Father, and then gaps filled in by Mother.  And his insatiable proclivity for research.  Though, sometimes he wished he hadn’t.
Those were the times he wished he could preserve: the quiet moments with his mother where they seemed so exceedingly
VOLDEMORT: I agree.  The jamón is not quite thin enough, so you have to exert a great deal of energy chewing.  The flavors are good though.  [He reaches for the next.]  Moving on… The rhubarb here is good – it pairs well with the strawberry.  The bits of ginger are a nice touch.
in such vulnerability every hour of the day.  People could hex him in the streets if they wanted, and he couldn’t so much as lift a hand to defend himself.  Would this level the playing field?
Draco rubbed at his forehead, suddenly exhausted at trying to explain the habits of his parents in a way that would make sense.  Because they
Either way, he was in no position to argue.  He would take whatever recrimination Potter came up with, and this was frankly more forgiving than he deserved.  He nodded.
[DRACO, who has frozen in shock, with wide eyes trained on HARRY, suddenly snaps back into himself and refocuses.  His hands begin to move again, adding more sugar to the fault lines and attaching more ornate pieces to the outer edges.  With a deep breath, he lifts the roof, eyes flicking to HARRY for only a brief moment before continuing.]
The worst years, of course, had been the hellish expanse of time that the Dark Lord had inhabited his home.  During that period, all his nights had been fever dreams, and all his days had been spent regretting that he had woken up at all.  And the screams - the screams had soaked into the very walls of his home.  Made the once comforting place cold, unfeeling.
the circumstances after nearly five weeks of sleeping in alleyways and the occasional abandoned building.  He was honestly surprised he hadn’t been offed in the interim.
percent of the time.  And more to the other point – you can’t honestly call Longbottom a stray anymore; he’s been popular since seventh year.  Much to my younger self’s chagrin…”
He drew a breath in and held it, waiting for her to continue.  The next time she glanced up, he saw the moment her hesitation broke down into relief at confessing.
The Slytherins were rowdy today – likely because they didn’t have another match until after winter break.  In the meantime, it seemed, they could afford to fool around.
Harry was blushing furiously now – somehow unused to the attention, even after all these years.  Draco’s lips twisted into a sneer, annoyed by the way the crowd was affecting the man; only
.  His head was heavy, his chin was on fire, and his lungs felt oddly compressed.  In the back of his mind, he registered the taste of blood, and realized he must’ve bitten his lip in the fall.
Draco froze, panicked thoughts eradicated by the force and shock of that exclamation.  Then, the red heat of a blush crawled to his cheeks, and he found himself masking it poorly beneath an ill-positioned hand.  “Well, I wasn’t sure I’d get another chance,” he muttered, not fully intending to.
“I can’t forgive you for calling Hermione a ‘mudblood.’”  The word sounded harsh and flat from Harry’s mouth.  “And I can’t forgive you for trying to get Hagrid fired – and for sentencing Buckbeak to death.  I can’t forgive you for the things you said about the Weasleys and how anyone less than a filthy rich pureblood could ever be of value.”  He paused a second, like it cost him something.  “I can’t forgive you for what you said about my parents.”
GEORGE: By golly – a proposal!  Congratulations, mate!  [turns to look into the camera] We’ll have to make sure we get
, more than anything, that scared him in the subsequent moments.  The moments he stood huffing, forehead pressed against the shower wall, letting the water siphon sweat and semen down the drain.  It was the time in which his previous euphoria faded and all his lingering doubts slammed back into him full-force.
His grey eyes gleamed in the dim lighting.  “Just here for a social outing, I’m afraid.  Why, you want to ‘rattle?’”
NARCISSA: Draco is a lovely boy – always has been.  He and his father both have a lot of professional pride, which is why there is sometimes…friction between them.  I just want him to be happy, so I’m glad he’s made it so far on this show.  Perhaps, if anything will convince Lucius that he’s got a pastry chef for a son rather than a sous chef, it will be this.
“A father who would kick his own son out for being gay – not because it matters, not because it was even all that
.  Apparently, that promise had been short-lived.  “Er, no actually.  I hadn’t.”  The polite smile felt stiff and forced on his face, and the lie cost him something to force out.
He had expected a gentle let-down from the Boy Savior.  But what he had gotten was anything but kind – if anything, he was being
HARRY: [laughs sheepishly] That’s right.  I’m going to make six different fillings to represent each of the six points of the Jewish star...and they
Potter had started in on his lecture about dueling now that he’d arrived, and he might’ve laughed at all the important historical details the man was skipping over if his eyes didn’t keep darting to Potter’s lips – and his hands too, as he gestured emphatically about something involving “seconds.”  It was fascinating really, watching him teach.  He didn’t think he’d ever heard the man talk so much at once before, given their typically terse exchanges.
*.  [He is a sudden whirlwind of motion as he grabs the nearest pot off the work station behind him and upends it over HARRY in retaliation.  The camera is now covered in goo, but we hear the shrieks and clangs continue until the feed mercifully cuts out.]
He latched onto that thought, barely remembering to force a laugh and eye roll in its wake.  “Fine, Potter,” he mumbled.  And, because he was
He shook his head to clear it.  “Alright, Potter.  If you want all that, then you’d best get me started, since – unlike you – I haven’t been idling around ramping myself up for the past hour.”
He swept into the sitting room, where both of his parents sat awaiting him on ornate Rococo-vintage couches.  He and his mother exchanged the usual greetings; his father wasted no time starting an argument.
Dread bloomed in his stomach, and he had half a mind to say “no” – which was quickly quashed by that recurrent wave of guilt that centered on the stack of unopened letters now directly in her line of sight.  He stepped aside and let her breeze into the room, emotions buzzing in the air around her despite the perfect façade of calm still masking her porcelain face.
“I’ve hidden in the back of the library before when I was pining and needed a break.  You’ve got that distinct look about you today.”
With a flourish, Draco dismantled the wards on his door; they were extensive, and, therefore, hopefully impressive.  He didn’t want to take his chances with anyone sneaking into his rooms.
He wandered over to her side, but only after several minutes went by without her moving.  She had her broom clasped loosely in her grip, pretending to be rearranging the bristles, though he could see they were just fine.
) before he had become a teacher less than two measly months ago.  But since then, he’d seen countless incidents of childish clumsiness that had been both dramatic and ludicrous in scope.  Like the time Jimmy had spelled his hands to his broom in an attempt to keep his seat, and not even Madam Pomfrey could undo it after flying class had come to an end.  He’d ended up sitting through Potions and Herbology that day holding a broom, and Longbottom – with infinite amusement – had made him mix the planters with it like an ill-shaped gardening shovel.
Mother’s face came to mind, crestfallen when he would take a meal back to his rooms instead of staying to eat with her.  Fractured whenever he said he was “going for a quick walk,” because it had quickly come to mean “I’ll be gone for the entire day, and possibly even longer.”
“If it’s sparking, then something’s wrong with it,” Blaise commented from several feet ahead.  He held up a hand and they stopped, pressing themselves against the wall until Filch had rattled by with his lantern.  “And Pansy’s right,” he continued in a whisper, “this is
Draco was starting to think that the world was conspiring against him in new and terrible ways.  He’d been on his way to bedding Harry after the game, when, naturally, the entire fucking Slytherin Quidditch team had appeared, frenzied with the taste of victory, and begged Draco to celebrate with them.
He waited until Draco was fully dressed again before clearing his throat and murmuring, “Well, I guess I’ll see you tomorrow then.”  In true Potter fashion, he lingered a minute longer by the lockers, like he didn’t know whether to leave or to wait.
made the man’s eyes snap up.  They were tortured and pleading and turned on.  “You looked…really good,” he rasped, barely above a whisper.
Sam’s eyes fell on Draco, who raised a brow.  “I won’t tell, if you don’t.”  It seemed a fair trade, as everyone loved to gossip about Harry – and him – it seemed.
Draco tried to think up the least damaging excuse for his indulgent wish-fulfillment gone wild.  “Well,” he started, “I knew you were extraordinarily dense.”  Harry began to protest, so he raised a hand to shush him.  “And you’ve only proved that even more over this past month – don’t you dare deny it.  So, I thought I’d help plant the idea.”
“Are we,” Harry started, “I mean, did you…”  He sucked in a deep breath.  “Are you my boyfriend now?”
“Do you promise to go and see Minerva?”  He looked hopeful but wary.  Like Draco was prone to throwing fits like a child – an assumption that ultimately had him grumbling an affirmative that lit Harry’s face with relief.
HARRY: I know the others are taking a bit of a breather, but now is when I have to rush the most in order to get all my fillings done in time.  [He swipes at a dot of cream cheese that has somehow ended up on the tip of his nose.  Endearingly, he only manages to smear it across his cheekbone instead.]  I’m still not sure about my flavors for the wild strawberry one, but I’m sure I’ll come up with something. [We see DRACO rolling his eyes from the work bench behind him, annoyed expression flitting across his face.]
Draco scowled.  Just because it was true, didn’t mean he needed to say it.  Besides, judging by Potter’s presence here and the array of teachers around them, he had to be here as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor - a much more prestigious position.
CEDRIC: [aside] My biscuits?  Yeah, they’re all done and cut.  Just assembling it all now.  [The camera zooms in on his perfectly manicured hands making perfectly amber caramel to glue it all together.  Detailed miniatures of him and Cho smile from the cutting board just beyond.]
Potter’s eyes roving all over him.  It made him want to yell, to strangle him, to succumb to those gross, complicated feelings deep down inside.
“Shhhhh,” Harry said as he pushed his pudding-coated finger against Draco’s lip. Draco parted his lips around the finger, taking Harry down to the knuckle. When he pulled away, the pudding was gone. Harry sucked air between his gritted teeth as he tried to keep himself together. “Yeah, just like that, that’s the kind of thing they might do.”
MINERVA: …and such, simply a wonderful bake!  Extravagant.  You should be proud to propose with that piece.
“-I just want to make sure you’re getting along.”  She smiled, beatifically.  “It would be a shame for you to start quarrels with a coworker in your first year of teaching.”
[He pours the mixture down the sink and sets his pot up to start again.  He gets it right this time, turning off the stove and setting the milk aside to cool slightly.  The audience would probably assume that he’d use this time to prepare the eggs for the custard, but the audience would be wrong.  The camera has turned again to take in DRACO, studiously whisking his mixtures together in increments.  We can almost feel HARRY’s thought process and the moment he decides not to leave well-enough alone.]
Of course there were odd happenings in the seventh floor corridor.  The Room of Hidden Things was still
MINERVA: That sounds like an ambitious project.  How many biscuits do you need to cut to make the structure?
here, and perfection means no soggy bottoms.  [His red, piercing eyes bore directly into the camera for several beats beyond what is comfortable.]
Draco held back a wince at Harry’s pronouncement, understanding more than ever how different Harry’s interpretation of events had been from his.  Draco’s antagonizing had mostly come from a place of jealousy and spurned desire, while Harry’s had been reactionary and suspicious.  But regardless of the messiness, Draco would never claim that their relationship had only
“Potter?  What do you want?”  His earlier anger was tempered slightly by the shock of seeing the other man here, out of the blue.  “I didn’t know you knew where my office was.”
.  I tried to tell you a year ago, and I’m trying to tell you now.  You’re weak and illogical and needlessly rebellious against the only people on your side.  The world has been cruel to us, yes, but you let your imagination carry you away to some world in which the shining ‘Boy Savior’ can also save
Harry flipped himself around so he was facing Draco before going to stand and sliding to the floor.  He grinned like a maniac.  “Fuck yes.”
Hey everyone!  Sorry for the chapter being so late this week - I'm really trying to stick to an "every two weeks" schedule, but sometimes it's just not possible.  But I wanted to get this up before the election, because that is a day that certainly demands everyone's full attention (if you live in the U.S.).
Draco blinked.  He offered so earnestly, like it was the most natural solution in the world – not like Draco was the broken, undeserving man that everyone knew him to be.  He couldn’t just
Harry gasped, grabbing his wrist.  Draco paused for a moment, looking him in the eyes before continuing to move, curling his knuckle in the tight stretch of perineum before ghosting lower.  Harry bit his lip and tightened his grip – but not to restrict Draco; it seemed he needed something to hold on to instead.
Hello!!  Chugging right along and getting ready for Halloween (both in real life AND in the story haha).
“I, uh… What do they say?”  Malfoy looked curious despite himself and took another few steps closer.  He leaned forward to read, bringing him within about two feet of Harry’s chest.
Potter rounded the corner of the staff table, and, based on his path, Draco had the sudden realization of why he was here.
Draco sank to the ground next to it, his wand clattering on the floor.  He sighed in relief first, then let the wave of anxiety crest and spill warm tears down his cheeks.
Draco had never seen a snake feeding before.  The sight pinned him to his chair in both terror and a numb fascination.  Those yellow glittering eyes – their glances pressed into his skin like a cold, maleficent promise.  It was only a matter of time before he, too...
Harry narrowed his eyes, but it was more for effect than anything.  “You tell me.  Do you need me to keep tabs on you again?”
They were at the register to pay for their candy when the reporter burst into the shop with a crash.  “Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy out together in Honeydukes!” he shouted, heaving, like he’d cracked the case of a century.  “A quote if you please.”
Draco distracted him with some messy tongue movements until he’d slipped the three fingers in.  He drew back, panting against Harry’s lips until he felt it was finally time.  “I think you’re ready.”
Father had submitted the memory to the court, and not even his desperate pleading to save his son that night of the battle could move Draco, knowing what had happened in that room next.  Snape had died a truly terrible death.
“See, a little birdie told me that you’re interested in my class.  My…what did they say?”  He paused, looking to the sky and briefly considering the success he could have had attending the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts, “Oh right.  You want to know my
Potter was a fucking idiot – that much was abundantly clear.  That he had first ignored him, then pulled his wand on him with some didactic speech on the unchanging evil of Draco’s character, and then had the
He thought of the peacocks, proud and aggressive, and couldn’t help but think his father had chosen the perfect, unintentional doppelganger for a family pet.
Draco’s face was flushed with embarrassment, “Is that my nickname now? Pretty balls? Just because I have had a completely hairless scrotum my entire life? That’s not funny. Truthfully, I’m very sensitive about that.”
[Cut to The Judging.  MINERVA and VOLDEMORT stand in front of what appears to be a charred block of cinder on GINNY’s serving plate.  She smiles brightly despite the tension of the situation.]
He tamped down his gloating, paging through the Skeeter book again – trying to draw as much attention to it as possible without saying anything outright.  “And, from what I found out,” he murmured, “you seem
VOLDEMORT: But it’s still buttery and moist without having a soggy bottom.  That’s a win in my book – you should be proud of that bake.
Sure enough, Potter dissembled the enchantment in seconds.  He scrambled up from the floor and flicked his wand with another silent spell.
He must’ve looked pitiful, because Malfoy didn’t wait for his floundering before he continued.  “Alright,
“Everyone,” she said blandly, gesturing towards the castle.  “I hear you’re a very well-liked flying teacher, and you said yourself that you’re getting along with Headmistress McGonagall these days.”
made you do?  Knowing the position it would put you in?”  His face twisted in righteous anger, empathy, and loss.  Eventually, he added, “And your mother – she allowed this?”
Guilt burned inside him, which he masked with defensiveness.  “Yes, well, you and Father have made it
“Harry, I know it’s you.”  She sounded exasperated, too – and not the least bit sorry.  “You always leave robes and towels lying everywhere when you bathe.”
.  Where she would tug his bejeweled robe into place and tell stories of the family members who’d worn the heirloom clasp she used to pin it.  Then, she’d ruffle his hair and call him ‘her little prince,” to which he’d always rolled his eyes and pouted.
“Come in!” Potter called from inside.  He sounded far more jovial than Draco had ever had cause to hear him.
As he geared up for the match on Saturday, Draco realized he was no longer nervous about refereeing.  After the first match, he’d come to see that people really weren’t focusing on him much at all (which, for once in his life, had been relieving rather than a point of contention).  Furthermore, his regular flying classes had gotten him used to the pitch again and flying with students instead of shady old men.  What he
the jeans,” he complained aloud.  The jeans were so tight that he hadn’t even dared look below his waist in the mirror.
“Well, well, look who finally got up the courage to come by,” he breathed – forcing himself into his role as the confident “haunted escort” rather than the “starstruck damsel” he’d become.  He prayed his acting was as good as he gave himself credit for.
Draco dutifully stirred another five rounds or so, eyebrows rising as the potion did, indeed, begin to purple.  “What do you think – healthy?”
Draco raised an astonished brow as his eyes darted to the wreck of essays they’d just defiled on Harry’s desk.  Harry followed his gaze before stiffening and turning back to him again.
It didn’t bring any relief though; in fact, the resulting effect was the opposite.  Draco felt a noxious sense of dread pooling in his stomach as he realized he was walking into a trap.  This wasn’t some one-off where they’d beat him up in the alley; this had been
“You know you don’t have to say the spells in their entirety every time?” Harry said between breaths.
(my own fest, so it would look super bad if I didn't LOL) - which you should check out if you're interested!  There's another week for claiming prompts, and no minimum word count requirements for the fest, so it can be as low pressure as you want!
[Cut to the tent again, the next day.  Everyone looks slightly refreshed from the time between yesterday’s grueling tasks and now, though there is still a nervous tension in the air.  This is it – the final challenge; the bake that decides it all.]
“Just form a loose circle and fly around the pitch,” he called to the class, landing to help Jimmy – the last student having issues getting up in the air.  He sighed.  “And what seems to be the issue this time, Mister Hathburn?”  Using his surname, of course, was a bit of exasperated humor at this point.  He found it stuffy to do so all the time – like he was purporting himself as a mini McGonagall.
When he felt safer within the walls of his own more organized mind, he managed to speak again.  He tried to make it as light and teasing as possible – anything to rid them of this darkened cloud of memories.  “Well, exciting class,” he said brusquely.  “Can’t say I’m impressed with your teaching methods, Potter.”
Harry sighed, but when he spoke, his voice was level rather than annoyed.  “Yeah, I know.  But that’s okay.”  He handed Draco a nougat, which he accepted with a smile.
“Look, I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t have-” he swallowed, and it gave Draco time to brace himself, “I shouldn’t have danced with you last night.  I knew something like this would happen.”
Draco paused mid-sip, choking a bit as he swallowed.  “Mother, really?”  He dabbed at his face furiously with his napkin, trying to sublimate his distress.
“Do you want me to…” Draco flicked his gaze downwards, saliva pooling in his mouth at the mere idea of sucking him off.
Feeling a little unsettled in this revelation, he threw himself into coaching, trying his best to spread his comments fairly and evenly and without favoring any particular side of this divide.  For the inexperienced, he gave helpful pointers and encouragement; for those who knew what they were doing, he acknowledged it, but gave advice on further improvement.
, I wouldn’t want to show my face.”  The man grinned impishly, seeming to sense Draco’s willingness to play along.  “
“Hermione, c’mon!  I need to get to the library, so I can finish this essay.”  Harry tried to step around her, but she stepped with him, effectively blocking the way.
Flitwick was saying something again, trying to contextualize this unacceptable display into something educational, but Draco found he couldn’t focus on the words.  He gasped around each unwilling bout of laughter, but it still wasn’t enough air-
“Mister Malfoy,” Kat said with an excited smile, “thanks for coming to help us practice!  We were just warming up.”  She flipped some braids out of her face and wiped some sweat.
Draco swallowed again and nodded.  “Sure.  Yes.”  He hurried in front of Harry, fighting to wipe the vulnerable hope from his face as he went.  He had to pull himself together.  Sweep Harry off his feet while the going was good.
He dismounted his broom as the others were filing to the lockers, muddy and wind-worn.  Marla stood slightly off to the side, and Draco couldn’t help remembering Sam’s visit to Harry the previous night.  Perhaps Marla needed someone to confide in as well – though he didn’t want to overstep.
Draco clenched his jaw to hold back a pitiful groan.  He rocked Harry’s head gently up and down, amazed at the way Harry simply let him.  Like he
And Potter?  Maybe the Mark would remind him of what he was getting into.  In a rare fit of clarity, Draco realized that the kindest thing he could do for Potter was to scare him away entirely.
But there was nothing for it.  He’d give it an earnest go. “Alright, how about we go to The Three Broomsticks on Saturday, and we can hit up Honeydukes after?”
Draco bit the inside of his cheek, wondering sardonically how many things his father would steal from him in his life.  Judging by his timing now, he clearly wasn’t past it.  “Harry, Harry,” he said, savoring the taste of that name upon his tongue, “you clearly have no idea what they’re like.  If I don’t go, my mother will show up at my door in a few minutes.  And I’d rather not have
“We’re contemporaries.  I was even on the team back when you threw your little temper tantrums about losing to Professor Potter.”
“You’ve gotten to know them well, I see.”  She set her cup in its saucer, the whole ensemble clasped delicately in her lap.
It seemed he wasn’t the only one spooked by the turn in conversation, as Harry interjected, “If I wasn’t half-blood though-”
His cheeks had reddened under the gazes, and his eyes caught desperately on Draco, who merely stood there waiting like the rest of them.  If Harry needed a lie to hide behind, Draco would accept it, but it would have to be his own.
But instead of mocking him, Malfoy swept his eyes over Harry’s head one more time, scrutinizing, before simply shrugging.  “The color’s a bit intense, but the styling is less…messy.”
And only because Draco was determined to end on a high note, he wrenched himself away and closed himself in his office without a backward glance.
.  First off – Potter had talked about him enough to piss off his friends and make it a “thing” that they nagged him about?  And second – even his
Harry had become disgustingly sappy over the course of the past week.  Since the conversation in which they’d worked out their misunderstanding (Draco
He sat up.  His body felt loose and satisfied in a way that he’d never before felt after sex – and that, more than anything, led him to the realization that it had really happened.
Her mouth twitched into a small smile, though she looked earnest as she responded.  “Well, I wasn’t planning to, but you looked right pathetic over here, and I have a weakness for strays.  You look much less intimidating without your trademark posture and glare.”
“Huh?” Marla startled out of watching Kat.  “Er, the sword?  No – it’s not!  It’s just spelled to look sharp.”  She ran her finger along the edge before Draco had time to process, and he found himself instinctively reaching out to prevent a catastrophe.  As stated, the blade did no harm, and she smiled apologetically as he withdrew his hand that hung uselessly in the air between them, embarrassed.
[HARRY goes over to join his family, who take up several long tables all on their own.  GINNY scruffs him on the head, and RON gives him a hearty slap on the back.]
[Cut to an array of puddings – some firm and proud, some sagging dejectedly.  In the corner of the screen, it reads, ‘Week 3: Saucy Puds.’  Down below that text, there is a sub-note, almost too small to read: ‘Contestant Argus Filch was sadly eliminated between weeks 2 and 3 due to multiple food safety violations.’  It cuts to VOLDEMORT, looking very sanctimonious as he professes his expertise on ‘saucy puds.’]
“A toast!” Fenn cried, when most of the upperclassmen had drinks in hand.  “To our first win this year, and starting the season out right!”  A cheer went up through the students.  “And to our flight instructor being a Slytherin, who should want to continue seeing his house succeed in the future,” she added with such self-referential nepotism that Draco had to laugh aloud in response.
He felt Harry’s hand clamp down on his shoulder, holding him back from something – he didn’t know what – but it was stifling, and he tore himself away to pace.
“Cut is good, color not so much.”  He ran a hand through his new cut, marveling at how the pink had faded miraculously overnight – it was black and curly again, with only the slightest wisp of pink in his bangs.  It reminded him of the days when Vernon would shave off all his hair, and it would come back longer and messier the next day.  Though, today, it had kept the cut – which he felt must mean something.
Draco scrambled for Harry’s zipper just as Harry began fumbling with his.  His knuckles bumped against Harry’s as they yanked and unclasped, and they wrenched down their trousers with flies still partially undone.  As soon as their cocks sprang free, Draco wrapped a hand around the jostling erections, stretching his fingers to grip them both in one fist.
His train of thought trailed away into memory fragments: a snippet of his parents dancing at a party, her rolling her eyes at his dramatics over a cozy autumn dinner.  A scene of them all huddled in the gazebo to see the Christmas lights over Wiltshire flare on.
Today’s game was Hufflepuff versus Ravenclaw – the one he would always skip as a student, because it had none of the passionate rivalry of the Slytherin or Gryffindor matches.  But as the flight instructor, he had to put aside old immaturity and do his job, which was exactly what he did.  Though, it didn’t stop him from occasionally letting his gaze drift away from the polite Hufflepuff beaters to his boyfriend in the stands.
More than anything, Draco hated discussing his relationship with his father.  Perhaps more than he hated dealing with him, even.  So his response was precursory and terse.  “Oh, just that I’m a horrible son and shouldn’t be mingling with paupers and blood traitors and that I’ve wrought ruin upon the family name, et cetera, et cetera.”  He let his eyes run down Harry’s body with a hint of self-deprecating humor.  “That I’ve debased myself by consorting with you.”
They showed off some blocks and rolls, trying to one-up each other as usual, and when he suggested a scrimmage, Potter acquiesced more easily than he would have expected.  Perhaps it had something to do with the way he kept twitching whenever Draco called him “Professor” – a pleasant surprise that had Draco revising his previous stance.
Draco felt himself breaking into a smile at that, and he drew Harry’s hand from his face in order to brush a kiss to knuckles.  The look Harry gave him was positively criminal.
, please go on telling me about how you’re settling in.  I heard you were made Head of House – congratulations!”
require a warehouse full of eternally burning school equipment and had gone back to its usual uses).  But this week, it was just the 8th years and their dorm and a whole crate full of unsanctioned firewhisky.
Draco frowned.  “Well, in a way, yes – however, the whole point is to remain in control of yourself and your situation.”  That’s all he’d ever wanted.  “As it is right now, my potion makes you lie about random things that cross your mind – which, depending on your random thoughts, can get a bit preposterous and would certainly raise suspicions in an investigative scenario.”
Their food had arrived, so Draco took a bite of his shepherd’s pie, sparing a wry look for Harry.  “Well,
Potter was explaining the bowing bit now.  He described it – once more, in only the barest of Wizarding terms – then drew his wand with a glance.  Draco took this as a cue to draw his as well, keeping it light and loose in his grip.
Draco forced his gaze back to meet Potter’s, feeling at least equal measures guilt and overwhelming luck.  But Potter’s eyes weren’t on his.
Draco glanced up to see Harry burst into the common room, startling the Slytherins from their languid conversations.  There was a moment in which the man appeared startled himself, like he hadn’t expected anyone but Draco to be sitting there – which was an amusing thought in and of itself.
He startled as Harry yanked his arm forward and revealed the Mark under his sleeve.  “Your Mark, I forgive you for, because it wasn’t a choice.  Voldemort would have killed you like he killed so many others.”  He met Draco’s eyes, solemn.  “I forgive you for Dumbledore, because you couldn’t go through with it.”
He ground his teeth, feeling older than he ever had in his twenty tumultuous years.  Not long ago, he wouldn’t have had the guts to tell his mother to stop.  He’d been so compliant for so pathetically long, and it had only harmed him in the end.  Now, he stood up to her – not because it was easy or he enjoyed it – but because the alternative would surely destroy him before he’d had a chance to mature.
“Huh?  No, he’s not!  Well, not more than any other subject.”  Seeming to realize what she’d said, she brought a hand up to her mouth.  “I mean-”
[Freeze frame.  The scene changes to a highly-staged ‘day in the life’ of CEDRIC at home.  A fan favorite, the earlier mention – and now visual evidence – of his girlfriend is doubtlessly breaking thousands of hearts across the nation.  She appears, beautiful and laughing, in the cozy kitchen set-up, and they begin to throw flour at each other in a highly impractical yet also highly endearing food battle.]
office by any means, but it granted him a fragment of dignity that he would not have regained otherwise.
[Cut to shaky footage of the contestants and crew members leaving the tent for the day.  The camera reverses for a moment so the audience can see a smiling FRED who throws a peace sign and sticks his tongue out before flipping the camera back around.  Most of the crew seems to have left by now – DRACO, however, lingers, and when HARRY steps out the door, he grabs him by the front of the jacket and slams him against one of the tent’s supports.  HARRY’s eyes widen, and the breath is knocked out of him.]
Harry let out a muffled groan as Draco gathered a firmer grip on his hair.  He tugged Harry’s head in close so it ghosted Draco’s abdomen with each panting breath.  He held him there until Harry’s throat started to ripple around him, seeking air; then he pulled off.
He flew, that was to be sure, but it didn’t seem like something he did often on his own, if his slight hesitance about night-flying had been any indication.  He wasn’t a particularly collegiate man, so Draco knew he wasn’t spending that extra time
bad once she realized she’d have an outlet for her knowledge of werewolves – but looked up and caught his eye with confusion when she noticed what he was wearing.  Seamus and Dean were wrestling over some chocolate frog card, and students of other houses milled around between them.
Draco let his palm fly, snapping at the middle of Harry’s arse.  Without thinking, he threw another, coming down in the same spot, and watching Harry jolt.  He held nothing back; he never had, and he felt distinctly like Harry wouldn’t want him to.
Potter froze his fidgeting, clearly not expecting that.  Draco had him trapped.  He surely knew that if Draco had talked to Hannah, then he might know about their outing to Hogsmeade – and their subsequent conversations.
He entered the Manor with a trepidation befitting a prisoner walking to the gallows.  Roddy appeared within instants, taking his coat and grumbling that “Master Draco was ten minutes late!” when it had really only been eight a half – and only that much to annoy his father.
, he thought distractedly, picking up a Puddlemere United paperweight and inspecting it, because he was sure Potter hated it when he touched his things.  He made sure to touch
commercials, Draco took him all the way down to his asymmetrical, hairy balls. When he came up, there was no more pudding.
“Oh, I’m sure that’s why you’re so worried - the wellbeing of your students and all, that’s serious business.” Draco said, feigning sarcasm.
Harry, as it turned out, appreciated his smarmy display at the sweets shop enough that they fell into bed almost immediately upon entering his room.  “You’re such a sneaky, conniving,
” he asked aloud five minutes before their date.  He was standing by his closet, staring unseeingly into its depths.  He’d killed an almost-infinite span of time this morning with his routine of reading and pacing, and evidently he’d killed a bit too much of it.
“You’re only ‘Professor’ in front of the class, Potter,” he muttered, fantasizing vaguely about calling him “professor” in an entirely different setting.  If Potter would like that.
Jameson’s face soured, and it remained sour when he came pounding on the door with Grant after they’d all ascended into the pub.  Draco opened the door with a frown – but this time, he didn’t step aside to let them in.
The man’s nervousness was making him twitchy, and it wasn’t until Draco reached his neat pile of clothes on the bench that he realized what this was likely about.
At first, the man reacted with the same confusion as the others at Draco following him into the dark common room.
TEACHER: Potter, what are you doing?  Get back to your station.  [His voice is sharp enough here that the audience can recognize it as former contestant SEVERUS SNAPE even without him stepping into frame.]
Harry hissed as the final strike came down in the same spot as the last, his body twitching – and, finally – slumping against the lockers in Draco’s grip.
Draco looked at him again, unable to resist.  Potter, caught looking, darted his eyes away with a scowl.  Merlin, he was so
His body was alight everywhere Malfoy’s eyes had touched.  Fuck – he had to say something now, didn’t he?  It was weird to stare across the room at your former enemy, dressed like he was.  The question was…what.
Draco thought for a moment of the Manor – of all the thousand emotional betrayals he’d committed against the Dark Order during the war.  He thought of how it had coalesced into that one moment he’d looked into Harry’s eyes and said only “I can’t be sure.”  He thought of his father’s deluded arguments that were hurled at him to this day.
to, of course,” Malfoy continued, his voice heavy with amusement.  “If you feel your moves aren’t up to snuff for so public a venue.”
Harry looked a little relieved as he let his eyes flicker shut again.  “Alright, then in the meantime, let’s just rest a bit.”  He wrapped his arms around Draco beneath the covers and began rubbing circles into his shirt.
you realize?”  He knew he was prodding whatever Harry was trying to keep quiet, but the look of delicious panic in Harry’s eyes made it well worth the needling.
as well.  I think it’s helpful to see that this is a complex spell no matter your age, and there’s no shame in struggling with it.”  He peeked over at Draco’s expression, which had gone thunderous to cover his embarrassment.
The burly man who’d done all the talking so far eyed him like a kneazle stalking a mouse.  “Just a game,” he laughed.  “A nice,
which, seeing as Draco never left the shop, was his only true link to the outside world.  From what he read, the flowers were blooming in the countryside, and the window-box gardens in Diagon Alley were flourishing with a little help from magic.  It was the perfect piece of news from a perfect little world – one that existed just beyond Draco’s limited range of motion.
McGonagall’s lip twitched in amusement, too, and it comforted Draco that she found Harry’s antics humorous rather than distasteful.  But she schooled her expression quickly and responded with a perfectly neutral face.  “I’m afraid we have a fair amount to discuss regarding safety measures and getting the pitch in order.  It’s probably best if you reconvened to address
, he remembered.  She had cried and begged and clung to his legs for mercy as he Occluded and Occluded and Occluded-…  But nothing could block out the look in her eyes when her body simply
Harry dunked a Mice Pop into the red marshmallow goo, while Draco unwrapped a chocolate skeleton with precision before dipping.  Everyone knew that Bat’s Blood left a particularly sticky residue if it got on you, and yet all his meticulousness was for naught; he got distracted watching Harry take an overenthusiastic bite and felt the telltale trickle of syrup dribbling down his hand.
She waited a beat, as if expecting him to continue, but since he’d been utterly unprepared for this meeting, he found himself drawing a blank.  McGonagall was terribly intimidating at the best of times, and furthermore, she bore the knowledge of all his faults and mistakes.  It gave him anxiety to think about what she actually must think of him.
Enraptured, DRACO wipes some icing from HARRY’s cheek, and – almost an afterthought – he licks it from his thumb and says, ‘Hey, that’s mine.’  His voice is quiet and full of wonder, and FRED backs away and around the corner before he’s noticed and inevitably ruins the moment.]
[It cuts back to said bakers when LUNA’s slow-mo reprise has concluded.  HARRY and DRACO look even sourer than before as their chilling period verges into its second hour.  CEDRIC sips happily at a cup of tea – and seems to be perusing a wedding catalogue while he’s at it?]
Draco inspected his nails as Harry drove himself to madness.  It was all part of the game.  “The boy made many comments.”  He could feel the frustration crackling in the air and smirked.
Harry heaved a sigh.  “And…Molly Weasley may have sentabunchofChristmasjumperstoyourfamilyestateoutofrevenge…”
As far as conversation transitions went, this one was pretty transparent, but Harry seemed to sense that Draco was at his limit with depressing talk about his family.  “Nothing, mostly.  I stayed at the Burrow.  Ron and Hermione moved on and moved out into their own place, but I stayed.  Ginny was there, but busy with Quidditch stuff.  I kept everyone pretty distant; I was trying the whole ‘peaceful living’ that I had never gotten to experience growing up, but in the end, it just wasn’t for me.”
The dinner with Weasley and Granger had kicked off abysmally, with both couples floundering between over-stiff politeness and the general disbelief that this could head anywhere but disaster.  Harry had been in rare form, skittering about like a startled shrew – so thick was his anxiety – and it had been all Draco could do not to start panic-insulting his partner’s friends
He had thought that, as the pinnacle of “goodness” and “moral superiority,” Potter – if no one else – would have afforded him a fair second chance.  But he had been mistaken.
But it wasn’t immediately apparent; it wasn’t Voldemort, robed in all his maliciousness – it wasn’t a dementor like in Potter’s third year.  It looked like-
Reminded of how pathetically desperate his writing sounded by having it read aloud to him, Draco did the only thing one could do in such a situation: deflect with overly arrogant humor.  “Why, do you want it to be?”
“Never mind!” the boy blurted.  “Enjoy your afternoon!”  He glanced over at Draco again and gave a slight nod, as if just seeing him for the first time.  “Mister Malfoy.”  And then he was gone.
He wiped at his eyes somewhat hysterically, a genuine laugh bubbling up amidst the sorrow.  “I’m not your student anymore.”
Grant stood outlined in the door, pulling it closed behind him at Draco’s gaze.  “You want some help with those?”
holding back, and we see his eyes fly skyward followed by some choice muttering to himself.  When HARRY glances back at him though, he feigns attentive interest in his layouts and molds.]
It was this thought that kept him upright at four in the morning when he’d be stirring a batch of Dreamless Sleep.  He wasn’t dead yet – that had to mean something, didn’t it?
to ever work as one.  But this new revelation had shattered that idea; maybe they weren’t so different after all?
She let out a long sigh, irritation spilling from her like an overturned inkpot.  “That’s too bad.  I wish
He looked so painfully awkward about it too – to the point Draco couldn’t help but grin as the man lost his proverbial footing.  It was strangely satisfying that, with a few choice words, he could so easily offset someone who had been about to beat his arse in a duel.  It was exhilarating – but also deeply confusing.  Potter was back to acting the way he had been with Draco before everything went south, but
.  The intense pressure of that gaze, the way the world slowed to a crawl so he could feel each unwieldy thump of blood rushing from his heart.
Over the course of this rant, Harry’s face had gone from a pleasant rosy brown to hot streaks of red blooming across his cheeks.  He fidgeted with his chips, refusing to look up.  “Err, right.  I kinda wondered about that.”
happen,” a burly man with hex scars chimed in.  The men next to him chuckled, as if he’d told a joke.
[Cut to SIRIUS laughing and goofing off with the emcees once more.  In the foreground, a perfect loaf of challah lies cooling on the rack.  We cut again – this time to GINNY, who is staring into her oven with a disgruntled expression on her face.]
He dropped his wand to the snake, prepared to vanish it if it lunged, when Potter cast his next silent spell.
Draco smirked.  “It’s just…great lesson, by the way.  It’s almost like you’re a teacher or something.”
“Oh!”  Cheeks flaming, Harry dialed the volume down.  “I said, ‘just seeing what feels like me,’ I guess.”
The boy jumped with the broom in his grip several times, eyes squeezed shut in concentration, but couldn’t seem to stay up.
“Right,” he continued, suddenly desperate to draw his thoughts away from this epiphany.  “Well, other than that fun conclusion, I endured a dinner of all my least favorite dishes – the menu hand-picked by my father, of course – and a positively dreadful chat in the study over after-dinner drinks about my future prospects.
Ginny let out a bark of laughter before clapping a hand to her mouth, and Harry glared at her in betrayal before turning his scowl back on Malfoy.  “Shut up, Malfoy.  Are you looking for a dance this time, or a fight?”
The song was slowing, and Malfoy dipped Harry elaborately one more time before pulling him to a stop, front and center.  While his nemesis was barely flushed from the exercise, Harry himself was panting.  The realm of “dance” was a formidable battlefield, it seemed.
,” Draco stated flatly.  It was cruel of Harry to make Draco refuse like this, to be the one to see reason, when all he wanted to see now was Harry on his knees for him in broad daylight.
His bitterness at being ignored, however, was quickly morphing into concern as one week faded into the next, and Potter stopped coming to meals.  He relayed his worries to Hannah – who’d caught him “moping” in the library later – and she’d merely assured him that she was sure “Harry was taking meals in his room – that’s all.”  Sometimes, he got “busy.”
Harry rode his fingers with urgency, pushing back against him when Draco started to pull back.  After another minute, he twisted around to beg, “Just put it in.”
Draco was aware that he was making a fool of himself, saying things he would never normally say.  Things that made him look weak and emotional and every other insult his father had ever thrown at him.  He heaved, hardly seeing Harry’s hands as they hovered in the air in front of him, hardly understanding why the air wasn’t coming fast enough.
The barb drove Draco to stand taller, twitching Bagman’s hand from its place on his shoulder.  “I had the Dark Lord in my house,” he said flatly.  “It takes more than a little Quidditch to scare me.”
LUCIUS: [caught in the lobby of what appears to be a very expensive hotel] Hmm, Draco?  Yes, he’s a fine chef.  More suited to meats and preparatory work than the baking he entertains himself with.  I plan to start him out in cold meats when he graduates, and if he proves himself with that, then maybe we can sit down and reassess. [He adjusts his wrinkleless satin gloves and gives the camera a terse nod before turning to go.]
So yeah, some snippets of Draco writing his sneaky Skeeter parody this time.  In the comments of TNFI last time, someone wrote that it was like Draco writing his own fanfiction of them, which I found hilarious (and pretty true)!  Hope you're all enjoying his perspective so far.
The boggart clearly hadn’t been enough.  Even after what Draco had considered a grand gesture – stealing Potter’s boggart so he looked like a fool when he tried to give his

Now there’s a face you don’t see every day!  How’s it going, lad?  What brings you to the Wyvern tonight?”
Potter merely frowned and entered the room, inching warily around the couches and chairs.  He paused at the open stairway at the opposite side and turned back, distrust lacing his voice as he spoke.  “Here?”
panic?  If Draco unknowingly pushed him too far, then Potter would have even more reasons to hate him.  Not to mention, he’d feel
But Harry didn’t appreciate the momentary pause, as he demonstrated by leaning in and gripping Draco by the base of his neck.  They kissed feverishly, hands sliding and grasping, and Draco moved against him blindly until they were knocking against the wall.
I hope you're all enjoying the bits about Draco's shady Quidditch ring past 😂  I said it last time too, but I've been having a lot of fun writing Bagman.
With the attention so narrowly focused on his throat, Draco couldn’t help the sudden urge to swallow.  It sounded noisy and calamitous against the quiet.
“Ah, looks like the Savior of the Wizarding World is ready to fly!  Could we get you up here to demonstrate a few maneuvers,
“Alright, here’s what we’re going to do.  Narcissa: I, Judge Wilhemina Graddlethorn, verify that you have successfully completed your sentence, and, as such, am releasing your wand to you now.”  She tapped the desk drawer with her wand, and when she opened it, his mother’s clattered visibly inside.
HARRY: I’m planning to make some trees out of sugar work as well.  But yes, it’s supposed to be rather simple, so the focus remains on the important part – me with my family.
When he glanced back, the heartbreakingly lost expression lingered on Potter’s face, though the side of his mouth did quirk up in a little smile – to Draco’s relief.  “We could always resurrect the dueling club,” Potter joked.  “To give my students some more practice.”
“Oh, my little Gemini,” she’d cooed, “there’s no wonder why you’re good at that one.”  As a Black, she’d always been fascinated by star lore.  It was one of the things she’d hidden most fiercely from Father – who thought that such pastimes were “trivial” and “common.”  But it hadn’t stopped her from imparting them on Draco from a young age.
Her eyes had a faraway look in them as she stared past him into the flames.  “I just mean – you could’ve gone anywhere, yeah?  Why return
Harry pulled back to swirl his tongue over the head, and Draco nearly jerked out of his grip with the tremor it sent through him.
come out of this evening – something more than a panic attack and an aborted kiss.  “I bet you’re rubbish at it,” he dared.
Draco stood to the side and let the students flow out until it became a trickle, then stopped altogether.  Taking a deep breath, he knocked.
Narcissa sighed, losing some of her poise.  “Very well.  While it is true that your father removed you from his will, and therefore, the Malfoy inheritance…that may not be the case forever.”
Spellbound by that gaze, Draco raised his wrist slowly to his mouth.  He ran the flat of his tongue up his palm, capturing the drop, never looking away.  It tasted sweet and filthy in his mouth, and he let out a hissing breath.
It was endearing, and Draco decided not to make it easy for him.  He made no move to hide his grin as he slipped on his shoes and straightened.  Finally, when he knew Potter was practicing bouncing with nerves, he glanced up to meet his eyes.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut and cursed softly under his breath.  “You were right,” he said at last.  “They
you.”  He wanted to say he didn’t know where this was coming from, but years of repressed wank fantasies were unlocking in his mind, and even his skill in
“We have a reputation to uphold as Slytherins.  In all my years, I’ve never seen our house back down from a challenge.”  It was then that Fenn delivered the killing blow: “Besides, I know for a fact that the Gryffindors are doing a horror house.  If we want to win, we just need to do ours
And Draco just kept on swallowing.  Each clamp of his throat sent a shockwave through Harry head to toe, and his knees threatened to buckle with each ripple of unbearable pleasure.  He planted his hands more solidly against the opposing wall to hold himself up and prayed he was keeping quiet...
He decided in an instant that he’d shown enough weakness to this man for one day.  “Yeah,” he said, voice full of false confidence.
“Imagine building up what you think is a romantic tension over months and months, and then you realize it was all one-sided,” Harry announced.  Draco didn’t have to imagine.  “It’s like if everything happened with us up until the Halloween Ball, and then you asked me to dance, and I was like, ‘no, what are you talking about?’  That would hurt, wouldn’t it?”
Harry’s face blazed, and Draco wondered whether he’d gone too far.  Last time he’d brought it up, Harry had run from him for a month.
“Right you are, lad,” Bagman continued, as if Draco had spoken.  “Right you are.  There’s always places for us outsiders to make our own society anew.”  He leaned back in his stool with the gravitas of having said something secretive and deeply meaningful.
“Not a Howler, not a she,” he mumbled without thinking.  Then, he immediately gritted his teeth and closed his eyes.
Harry stared at him for a minute, eyes sweeping up and down with a curious little frown on his face.  “Of course.”
He walked back over to Draco, pudding in hand and said, “With this, you’d probably start with the pudding skin.” He peeled off the pudding skin and rubbed it along Draco’s phat, juicy, pouty lips.
“I think it’s okay to both hate and love someone at the same time,” Harry said at last.  He pulled back a fraction to look him in the eye.  “I mean…that’s how I feel about Dumbledore.”
VOLDEMORT: But let’s see how those bottoms turned out.  [He picks up one of each rugelach and flicks them systematically with a taloned nail.]  Hmm, fairly crisp.  That’s a good bake.  [He leans in close so that the smell can make it up his shallow, flattened nostrils.]  I’m getting a whiff of the stilton now.
Harry handed him a cup, then wandlessly summoned an empty one to his hand to make his own.  It sent a shiver of appreciation through Draco, though he didn’t have the energy to do more than raise an eyebrow.
It felt like a fishing hook drawing air directly from his lungs; the more he struggled, the more it caught and ripped at his throat.
[Cut to present, in which the finalists are putting their gingerbread doughs in to chill.  VOLDEMORT and MINERVA approach CEDRIC alongside GEORGE to hear about the showstopper.]
“-except a future!”  He was standing now, soup forgotten on the table.  “Except a past I can look back on without regretting enough to want to die!  You gave me

had yet to change; how could he?  If this was as far as his tenacity could take him, then perhaps it was time to give up and return to his fate at the Manor.
to him – that much, at least, he could say with certainty.  He still got jeered at and singled out on the pitch and sometimes spit at in the stands, but that was par for the course.  The rapid decline into hostility that Grant had warned about, however, had yet to come to fruition, and Draco – like any good paranoiac – was losing sleep and what remained of his sanity fretting over it.
– all for the sake of a man who could never love him back.  Now, he’d be facing Lucius Malfoy within the hour and likely getting a citation from McGonagall – if he wasn’t outright fired due to Howlers from outraged parents – and there’d still been no sign of Harry.  He rather feared that he wouldn’t show up today at all.
it, Harry was clearly also nervous about more than just the beginning of their first date.  They were about to step out into the Wizarding world – together, officially, for the first time.
Draco felt his grin widening as he thought of how he could use this against Harry later.  Preferably in the bedroom.  “Really?  How…
much of an idiot.  Of course you didn’t call her here.  Now, there’s still some time before dinner, so…”  He pulled his wand from where he’d stashed it hastily in his waistband and cast a warming charm on the faucet – which had begun to run cold as they lingered.  “That’s better.”
It was only later that evening, after visiting the Kitchens and hearing that Potter had been refusing meals, that he decided enough was enough.  He went to bed with a headache, and in the morning, Draco set off resolutely towards the Headmistress’ office.
[Voice overlay announcing, ‘And the one leaving us this week will be……….Ginny!  Sorry sis!’  She jumps from her stool, brushes off her jeans and gives out a few brief goodbye hugs.]
A ripple ran through her when she did.  Her back straightened almost imperceptibly, and – despite expecting it – he couldn’t help but wince when her sharp gaze cut back towards him.
The first few licks were messy in a way that drove Draco dangerously close the edge.  It was clear that Harry had never done this before, and the thought that
FRED: Today is the day the gingerbread people came out to play – and we’re going to create a place for them to do so, because today you’re making 3D landscapes out of gingerbread!
He was so deep in his thoughts that he startled when Harry turned, grabbing both his hands and holding them against his chest.  “That’s not true.”
, after having disinherited me for over a year, my father still has the gall to fret over my social and financial decisions.”
Harry’s eyes gleamed.  With agonizing slowness, he slid his hand up Draco’s thigh until he was finally cupping him above the fabric.  He squeezed experimentally at the bulge beneath his palm, and Draco could only hiss softly in pleasure as Harry documented his expression with unblinking eyes.
When Malfoy turned, he still had that amused grin playing about his face.  “I’m surprised at the past tense, Potter.  Aren’t I still?”
“I know that,” he said, when he realized he couldn’t ignore Harry into backing off.  Bloody Gryffindors never understood the nuance of a good, pointed silence.  “You must’ve told me at least ten times now.”
Draco turned back to the cashier in front of him and repeated, “How much?” at the same time he heard Harry answer, “Err, I’m out with…a friend.”
CEDRIC: [confessional aside] It went splendidly – the best I could have done.  And I think I’m ready for the next step as well.
Perhaps he owed Harry too much to defy him on this one, reasonable thing.  “I’ll go tonight,” he said at last, though his heart palpitated with nerves at the mere thought.
Draco closed his eyes against the onslaught of that emotion, a weak groan bubbling up in his throat.  “
After a while, he looked up at him, eyes sliding past Draco’s as he bit out, “I was wrong, okay?  What do you want – a trophy?”  Then, despite Draco’s silence, “Now, not another word.”
“Er, did I say that I was going to clean up the juice?” he replied with a hysterical sounding laugh.  “I meant ‘go to Madam Pomfrey’s.’  Really feeling off sorts this morning.”
“Fuck, Potter,” he said, admiring the wet-lipped wreck of Harry’s face.  “You ready to get your wish?”
Harry nodded again, seeming to shake himself out of a daze.  “Right,” he mumbled.  “Otherwise, you wouldn’t be dating
The man froze for a millisecond before continuing.  “Like I said, a few weeks.”  He answered fluidly, convincingly even, but Draco’s interest was already peaked.
“I like to watch the reactions,” Draco assured him.  “Yours will be especially good, I’m sure.”  He thought of his earlier fantasy of Potter clutching him out of fear, unshed tears glistening in his expressive eyes.
“Yes, well, I think that’s enough dueling for one day,” Potter said in the most obvious misdirection he’d ever heard.  “And enough laughing.”
Gloria’s lips drew into a grimace as she sat back in her seat, fiddling with a rag on the nightstand.  With disgust, he realized it was streaked with his blood.
He climbed sulkily onto his broom, then flew low out over the pitch.  The first-years were gathering steadily, and some were even feeling confident enough to lift off the ground and practice some zigzags before he reached them.
It haunted him.  Even the memories that didn’t end in such lethal feasting twisted and morphed in his sleep so that they did.  Like the one of Rowle.  Writhing on the floor under Draco’s
[DRACO’s expression shutters, but he continues to work at a controlled yet speedy pace.  The screen freezes, then morphs into an opulent professional kitchen with employees running every which way in pristine white uniforms.  DRACO stands in the foreground, whipping cream by hand, while the immaculate chef’s hat on his head impressively does not even waver.]
HARRY: Ah, okay.  Yeah…so I’m planning to recreate a fun winter day I had with my family this year.  I’m going to do an ice-skating rink out of caramel, and then I’ll make gingerbread men of me and all of the Weasleys amidst our various winter activities.
that it’d feel hollow when he was gone.  It was the man’s first time coming in, and it was desperately unfortunate that it was also to be the last.
“Evening,” he started, trying his best to sound casual rather than manic.  “Have you prepared a meal for Professor Potter yet?”
Since last night, Ron had coached him on a better response than his previous one (presumably because his denial that anything was different came out as defensive or – at best – absolutely deluded).  “I’m, uh, trying something new.  Just some fun.  Yeah.”
There was a beat of silence.  Then, he heard Harry shifting beside him.  “Alright then.  Why don’t you come by my next class and see if some practice won’t help?”
“And is there any particular reason you couldn’t say something to Harry himself?” she asked, though her expression had softened into concern.
.  He tugged lightly at Harry’s head, palm cupped neatly around the base of his skull, and Harry moved forward without resistance.  Draco could’ve laughed with surprised delight.  “Oh, this is going to be fun,” he murmured as Harry’s mouth wrapped around his cock.
“Shit!” he mumbled to himself, not daring to say more in case Potter was listening from the other side.
He had changed in record time, cursing Potter and his unrevealed motives with every piece of gear he’d slid onto his body.  Kneepad.
Draco frowned.  “I recall some students mentioning that today actually.  Saying he’d been asking around about my teaching methods or some rot.  If he’s so convinced I’m doing Dark magic on quaffles or something, then he should come by and say that to my face.”
“Mainly writing and visiting more often…and not provoking Father on purpose.  Don’t worry,” he added, because Harry was still looking worried, “if it wasn’t clear before, I’m still not breaking up with you.”  He tossed it in there teasingly, and was therefore startled when Harry froze completely.
He felt Harry struggle a bit to turn his head, giving up when Draco’s hand held it steady.  “Yes,” he croaked, muffled.  “Yes,
And now, just days after the trials, he was still coming down from the torture of having relived it all again.  The Wizengamot had prodded through his memories unfeelingly – and it had only been worsened by watching his parents’ recollections in the pensieve as well.
“I wouldn’t care.”  Hating the anxiousness in Harry’s eyes, Draco cupped his cheek and ghosted gently over the stubble.  They were playing a new kind of game that had cropped up on occasion between them lately – one in which they felt out how serious the other was while always maintaining a layer of whimsy to fall back upon.  If Harry balked, then it would be a joke; if he accepted, then not even Draco knew where they would land next.
[The camera pans to take in the proud, determined faces of HARRY POTTER, DRACO MALFOY, and CEDRIC DIGGORY.  HARRY looks slightly nervous, while DRACO has composed his face into an attentive, expressionless mask.  CEDRIC beams at the emcees, blissfully unaffected by the pressure of the finals.]
“Shit, shit, shit-” Harry was whispering.  His eyes fell on Draco again, and he lunged with sudden purpose, manhandling him into the adjacent bathroom and shutting the door.
Harry sank into the seat next to him.  Draco could almost feel the bafflement radiating off of him, which coalesced into a sad attempt at conversation when the silence became unbearable.
sake, but the disparity between his pride and his pitifulness was too great to result in anything but prickliness.  “I didn’t say ‘okay,’” he enunciated slowly.  “I said ‘not great – but nothing I couldn’t handle.’”  He
A pang of sympathy – so sharp it pained him physically – shot through Draco.  He had spent so many years of his life terrified of that exact outcome that even now, over a month into officially “dating” Harry, he still woke from nightmares of rejections that hadn’t come to pass.
[The recap rolls through the remaining weeks, eliminating NYMPHADORA for her unappreciated gothpunk aesthetic, SIRIUS for his cavalier disregard for details like bake time, SNAPE for his indirection after finally conquering SIRIUS, and – finally – LUNA for an unfortunate yet not unpredictable mistake in which she mixed up sugar and salt and served the judges the most savory fruitcake of their years.  Our hearts break all over again for the last one, as LUNA has been a fan-favorite since the beginning, with clever flavor combinations and adorable animal-themed decorations.  Her departure has also left us to the mercy of male stupidity, as the remaining sausagefest has descended into histrionics beyond the scope typical of this show.]
To his pleasure, Harry shivered once, violently – his skin breaking out into gooseflesh at the word.  It hadn’t been a miscalculation, then.
Draco looked his mother in the eye.  He sucked in a breath to temper the blow.  “You need to leave.”
Harry nodded a little shakily.  “And what does it mean?  ‘Family of Slytherins?’”  His attempt at humor was lost in the tentativeness of his tone.
It made sense – these kids were years behind on building this skill, and suddenly they were expected to keep up without being afforded the time and encouragement?  Had
Harry quailed under the directness.  “Err…no?” he managed – about a split second before realizing it was the most obvious lie he had ever told.  His gaze flicked nervously to Malfoy, whose eyebrows were climbing beyond the scope of natural human limitation.
They hadn’t tarried when they’d reached the lockers after the game.  No, Draco liked it quick and dirty; he took Harry apart in minutes, as a simple matter of fact.  The first time had been a whirlwind, and, instead of slowing, they had only grown more relentless in the countless times that followed.
“Then what are you talking about?”  His voice sounded wary, with just enough genuine concern to make it seem like he really didn’t know.  Like
“Well, well, well.  Look who dropped everything to come visit me.  If I had keeled over yesterday, you certainly would’ve been the last to know.”  His smirk was a cruel slash across his wasted face.  Draco searched it, looking for change – looking for any sign that would confirm or deny his mother’s words.
The students, of course, had the option to bring a broom from home; though, most used the school’s ready supply of Nimbus 2001s, as they were of excellent quality and had held up over time.  But on rare occasion, as he had been warned by Hooch following his job acceptance, a student brought in a broom that was actually
Ron paused until Harry looked up and saw his barely-contained amusement.  “Yeah, mate – that’s just common sense.  I could’ve told you that.  Remember that book I gave you last year?
For some reason, he couldn’t get the image out of his head of Potter – the first time he’d tried the Firebolt.  He’d worn such an exhilarated expression then, like it had surprised him into true happiness, and that was, oddly, how Draco felt right now.
Every detail of every interaction since their first kiss had become a record of momentous beginning, and Draco savored each with the same flash of disbelief as before.  He wondered whether it would ever grow old – then quickly hoped that it wouldn’t.
Draco swept out of the room and down the hall, fury only sharpening when he spied Potter – a perfectly
going to be an every-day sort of commitment.  The seventh-years, sneaky bastards that they were, wanted to create the best horror house there ever was, while the first-years wanted caramel apples and maybe a few dancing skeletons.  Their creative visions were at odds, and as their chaperone, so was Draco.
, he thought darkly; though, in his heart, he knew this was no lie.  Even his sappiest, horniest dreams had never brought him the jubilance he radiated now.
Perhaps it was tied up in Dumbledore, the man he’d both hated and looked up to his whole life; the man he’d been ordered to kill.  The mercy he had extended to Draco, at the end, was sometimes too painful to bear.
“Yeah, whatever, Malfoy.  Let’s see if you’re still laughing later when no one is convinced by your overdone acting.”
GEORGE: Hah hah, well we’ll gladly ‘kill’ those spares for you backstage, if you know what I mean.  [He winks poorly, aimed directly at the camera.]
His mother winced.  “Draco dear, don’t-” she started to say, and it was that minute detail that pushed him from shock into anger.
Harry dug his nails into Draco’s shoulders an instant before coming.  He made a choking noise as the orgasm tore through him, sending him clamping down hard on Draco’s imbedded cock.  His back arched, and Draco used that opportunity to press in again to the hilt, allowing that sweet torture to push him over the edge, too.
Draco nodded compassionately, letting his eyes go wide and sympathetic to draw the reporter in.  It was working, too – the man’s shoulders were relaxing, his defensive expression was unshuttering as he was lulled into believing Draco an easy target.  He felt the corner of his lip twitching at the irony of it all but masked it with an even sweeter sincerity.
in – noting every twitch and expression with a drunken hope and the overwhelming fear that he would disappoint.

into it – there was no other way to describe it.  His whole body relaxed against Draco’s, his mouth warm and languid against his lips.  Harry shuddered out a sigh, and it was so intoxicating in its loveliness that Draco chased it back into Harry’s mouth with his tongue.
His cutting question hung, startling, in the air, and the reporter began to splutter as he realized this wouldn’t be easy at all.
Granger punctuated a line in her notebook with a jab before looking up; her hair was frizzy and wild with humidity.  She smiled.  “That’s what I’m about to do.”
Despite his frustration, Draco found himself smiling at how adorable Harry could be at times.  “I thought we were trying the whole ‘open communication’ thing on this date.”
Merlin, he liked the sound of that – like he was a puzzle for Harry to solve.  Like he existed for the sole reason of Harry putting together his pieces.
“Cashmere on the first date makes me seem like a prat, but I can’t wear my regular robes either.”  He flung shirts and trousers from their hangers in his furious attempt to find something suitable in time.  “Can’t wear
.”  Draco leaned in and kissed him, chuckling as Harry’s resolve weakened and he melted into the embrace.  His grip weakened, as well, and Draco snaked his hands away into Harry’s curls, smirking as Harry followed his mouth when he pulled away.
for extra assurance.  Then, she’d simply positioned Harry along the specific wall in the courtyard where Malfoy would be sure to see him as he finished Arithmancy for the day.  And sitting “bisexually,” too – whatever that meant.
Draco let out a deep breath, trying to blink away the mistiness of his own eyes.  “Good,” he said.  “Me too.  Let’s be that kind of person – both of us.”  He replaced Butler on the stack and tapped his wand on the books to glamour them back to Potions texts.
I hope you're enjoying the bits about Draco's past - they're honestly the most fun for me to write at this point, since they're all new material.  Anyway, hope everyone is well and staying safe!
“Why?  Scared you like what you see, Potter?”  He knew he was pushing a little now, yet he couldn’t help but say it – and with a laugh, no less - because Potter’s reactions were finally giving him reason to hope.  And that, more than anything, filled his chest with a warm, euphoric rush.
Draco huffed a soft laugh.  “Well, no.  Not when we had Gryffindor to compete with.  I think…we officially won the contest though?”
MOLLY: Harry’s a good boy, he really is.  Much more polite than my own sons – they could stand to learn a thing or two from him.  [She glares pointedly off-screen where we hear a crash and some laughter.  Then, fondness softens her expression once more.]  But he’s also very dedicated and works with a sort of chaotic creativity that I’ve never seen rivalled in the field.  I have full confidence that he’ll make it through to the end.  He’s destined for great things.
Draco wasted no time, gently grasping him at the base as Harry laid back on the beautiful couch cushion cover Molly Weasley had lovingly knitted for him three years ago.
But as the seconds drew on, Draco realized that Potter had no intention of starting this.  His eyes were vivid and bright in the dim classroom, and they traced him intently as he waited – presumably, for Draco to make a move.  So maybe this
“It’s going to be fine, honestly,” Harry was saying, sitting on the locker room bench as Draco got ready.  “They support me, and that means also supporting you now.”
portion barely paid for his room and the occasional drink, but at least it was livable, for now.  It kept him away from the Manor, anyway.
Occasionally, someone would come in who needed a custom order, and in those situations, Morpheus would appear in the back with a list and a gruff “Get to work” that sent annoyance lancing down Draco’s spine.  The one thing he wouldn’t budge on was that Draco was not to be seen by any customers – a mandate that quickly grew frustrating when he needed clarification on potion uses or ingredients.
Draco felt himself melting a little at the oblivious mess of a person in front of him.  He cupped Harry’s face in his hand and said, “Of course not.  You were dating Ginny Weasley when we met again – why did you think this would come as a surprise?”  He found himself tracing Harry’s cheek up and down in strokes he hoped were somewhat comforting.  “Also, you’re making a lot of assumptions.
He smirked when Harry had been looking too long, and the man blushed spectacularly as he muttered a “Right.”
He swallowed away the tightness in his throat and leaned against the stands for a minute, digesting this new information.  Her parents were Muggleborn, he knew.  Were things like being gay more accepted in the Muggle world?  It was something he knew little about and therefore hadn’t considered.  But what if it was true?  What if the world that would accept him best was the one he had reviled as “backwards” and “unbearably ignorant?”
MINERVA: Good crunch though.  The rolls are a bit messy, but good overall.  Let’s look at the last one.
From the flow of students coming from Harry’s classroom, Draco could tell that a lesson was just ending.
Draco glanced over at Harry and tried to shake the memory of those green eyes dozy with sleep.  He’d somehow been even
Malfoy hadn’t noticed him yet, so Harry took his time looking.  The man was crowded on either side by his new cronies – Zabini and Parkinson.  The latter was whispering something to them, which Malfoy responded to with an easy smile and low response of his own.  They didn’t seem to be playing any games yet (not that he’d noticed any going on), but his gut clenched with nerves at the idea of approaching them in their current formation; his clothes felt even more strangling as he watched and waited.  The trio was their own island in a sea of classmates, and something about their closeness sent Harry eddying away from their shores.
Right.  Draco jumped up and searched the room for the fastest place to hide – behind the chairs?  Too uncovered, especially if they came in.  Under the bed?  He wasn’t sure he’d fit.  In the wardrobe?  The door was broken, and the thing looked like it would fall apart.  In panic, he catalogued the room again, seeing only a wasteland of open space.
Draco refocused his gaze on Harry’s face.  The man was staring, enraptured, at the cocks in Draco’s fist, and he watched Harry stifle a gasp as he added a little twist to his wrist at the end of each stroke.
.  Which was not what he was expecting from Potter.  The man must’ve sought major student-input for that one.  “Well,” Draco said with a sigh, “it’s hard to top
“Right,” Harry managed, when he got his face under control.  “See you then.”  His eyes met Draco’s a little wildly, clearly wanting to say more, but not with McGonagall standing right there.
“And the books?” Potter was saying.  “What the fuck were you thinking?!  You think I like being reminded of all the slander about me in the news?”
Despite the inconvenient timing, the reckoning had arrived, and Draco planned to milk it for all the hilarity it was worth.  He feigned annoyance, rubbing at his ear like Potter’s complaints were merely an irksome drone in the background.  “Yes, yes.  Are you done your little tantrum?” he asked.
HERMIONE: I don’t want Harry to know I’m saying this, but I know for certain it’s Cedric.  I’ve tallied his technical prowess, and it’s just not possible that it’s anyone else.
“Was that okay?” Harry asked.  Then, he immediately blushed, like he hadn’t quite meant to divulge his self-consciousness.
VOLDEMORT: Gingerbread is good.  Caramel is good…except for this bit over here.  [He points to the re-melted bit by Charlie’s feet.]  This bit is
“Me falling over ‘dead’ or whatever was just supposed to be added drama.  Everyone else just ran out at that point or tried to fight the boggart.  It was a side distraction…I didn’t realize you-”
Since Harry’s lustful gaze was intoxicating, he put on a show of ripping the snaps off with his teeth and dragging the glove off with a well-placed bite and jerk of his chin.  He felt Harry’s cock jump against his hip.
The man’s hands twitched to the bridge of his nose, before he seemed to remember he wasn’t wearing his glasses.  Finally,
—even though Harry had done his part too.  He’d answered Malfoy’s challenge; he’d kept up with the dance and then some.
“You kept a pin that insulted you made by someone who hated you?”  He enunciated each word slowly, like he was puzzling out something of great significance.  And, put that way, Harry felt more self-conscious and unbalanced than ever.  Like the kind of person the
When he burst out onto the lawn, he wasn’t surprised at all to find Potter already there.  The man was hovering about on his broom, looking every bit the cheeky, injurious bastard who would do such a thing.
Should he humor the older students, since they would surely take initiative and work on it on their own?  Or would a responsible Head of House cater to the younger students, so that everyone – regardless of age – would enjoy themselves?  He was several arguments deep, head pounding with migraine, and no closer to finding an answer than three days ago when this had started.
– worse, even, than the raw violation of his private matters exposed so cavalierly to the public – was that righteous indignation at the way the author twisted his disinheritance to revolve around
– for so much of my life with the man who knowingly raised me to die.  It’s not pleasant nor easy to think about, and harder still to come to any sort of conclusion.  And, ultimately, I gave up on trying.”
He half-considered saying something pretentious like a five-star restaurant in France, but he was so past that phase of his life, he could no longer even pretend.  “Well, you can never go wrong with Madam Puddifoot’s,” he joked.  Really, he was testing the waters of Harry’s willingness to be seen with him in Hogsmeade.
Harry leveled him a look that told him he was being ridiculous – something he was already well aware of – and he quieted.  “I was going to say, ‘I know that you care, even though you feel you shouldn’t.’  You don’t have to forgive him – just go and talk at least.  Otherwise, you’ll regret it.”  He paused, fidgeting with his quill, like he still wasn’t comfortable giving advice.  “Also, we don’t have a lot of information.  Your mom could’ve been leaving out details – maybe it’s not as bad as it seems.  I don’t know.  But you owe it to yourself to find out.”
He was in the middle of notating a tome of “Complicated Potions for the Adventurous Brewer” by Eloise Haverton – a much more modern compilation, with much more practical prose – when he heard a crisp, polite knock at the door.  Even without knowing whom to expect, Draco’s heart skipped a beat at the sound.
But this was best.  Potter couldn’t know.  This obsession was too unwieldy, it ran too deep.  If he stayed, it would all show on his face; he would have to act disinterested.  That was how seduction worked, wasn’t it?
That line of thought, however, was dismissed in the next second, when a door banged open on the balcony above, and the
“Marla,” he started, voice a bit thick with emotion, “I will never see this as a waste of time – even if you read all the books on this table and decide
Another thing he ignored in the coming months was a series of owls from his mother.  He had answered the first few – in the beginning, when he’d let his hesitation about his current path lead him straight down the road into masochism.  He’d wised up since then, letting his mother’s letters stack, unopened, in a pile that he tried his best most days to simply forget existed.
he look in the mirror every day and see the same eyes that haunted his face when the Dark Lord lived in his house?  Should the relentlessness of his shame burn undiminished in their depths – as if not a day had gone by since he had taken the Mark?  Mother always assured him that time healed all wounds, but the proof of that lie loomed sharp and visceral on his face.
Thoroughly panicked by that latest order, Draco found himself returning to the previous question.  “Erm, what would you like to know?  About my…situation, that is.  I wasn’t trying to withhold anything, I just… the past few years are a bit embarrassing to discuss.”
Before long, the snitch appeared on the far side of the field, and they both zoomed after it.  Draco was close – it was only a broom’s length or two in front of him – but he could already tell he wouldn’t make it before it reached the trees.  Unregistered games like this, the snitch could fly into whatever obstacles it wanted.
Bored out of his mind, Harry would sometimes watch from the entryway corner.  It was only a few steps from his cupboard, so he could easily slip back inside if she got up or went for the door.  It had been in one of these “frivolous” American dramas that he’d heard the phrase originally.
Grant pulled him forward into a crushing kiss, and Draco surged up into it – refusing to become a victim of his own circumstances.  He could enjoy this; he could twist this so he was the one who came out on top, even if only in his own mind.  Maybe if he liked it, he would be able to forget…
There wasn’t a reliable answer, but in the meantime, at least he had Harry – in some capacity.  For now, that would have to be enough.
Harry’s head snapped up, and he looked Draco over quickly before answering.  “Ron and Hermione are getting married,” he blurted.  “How was your visit?”
Following his long training sessions, Draco would return upstairs for some supper before gearing up for his match.  Bagman would usually give him some kind of pep talk, telling him which players not to check or how many minutes he should let the snitch escape before getting serious; all of it related directly to the man’s nightly bets.  That was their deal – Draco flew exclusively for him, and so he earned a cut of Bagman’s winnings.
At his obvious reluctance, her lips twitched with amusement.  “Nothing bad.  I simply wanted to see how you’re getting on with your classes.  Everything going smoothly, I trust?”
Draco set his book down in his lap, pinching the bridge of his nose to hold in his frustrations.  He’d

He hadn’t really planned on throwing himself back into potions when he’d come back to Hogwarts.  Sure, he’d begrudged Slughorn his continued employment here as resident Potions Master, but it hadn’t been something he’d actually planned on
Harry swallowed, gathering himself like he was leading to some pronouncement.  “I’m bisexual.  I know some people don’t believe that’s real, so that’s going to be frustrating to explain…and- and it doesn’t mean that I’d cheat on you with a girl or whatever.  I mean, if we’re even going to be exclusive, I don’t mean to assume-”
“Hold up though, you’ve got something…”  His thumb slid delicately over Draco’s bottom lip, and Draco was forced to question whether this all had been some absurd dream.  Was Harry really
[HARRY, having finished his sheet of biscuits, runs around to the other side of his station to grab his piping bags.  DRACO, who is taking his pan out of the oven, backs into HARRY, whose velocity knocks his sheet into the air.  DRACO watches in horror as several of his biscuits fall and break on the ground.]
MINERVA: Truly breathtaking from a distance, though up close I can see it’s missing several windows.
But a few minutes later, he looked down and noticed Harry was gone.  Had something happened?  He remained gone for the rest of the game, and Draco played distractedly, noticing fouls long seconds after they’d happened and entirely missing the chase leading up to Hufflepuff catching the snitch.
“But you…you never said!” Harry countered, and the indignation in his voice allowed Draco to relax a fraction.
He recalled one particular dream that he’d startled from during the war.  How his pleasure had faded to horror, and he’d clapped his hands over his mouth until he couldn’t breathe.  What if he’d spoken in his sleep?  What if the Dark Lord had
Draco could’ve laughed in relief at the nonsensical response – it meant that Potter was at least a fraction as thrown as himself.  “So…what I’m doing now?”
Harry, near hyperventilation now, could only nod his assent.  There was no going back now.  “Alright.  Alright, fine.”
Her voice was so heartbroken that it cracked the veneer of professionalism that had been keeping his own memories at bay.  After years of questioning and agonizing and self-loathing and self-doubt, this wasn’t just teacherly advice – this was
to know.  And yet, the fear of what he had possibly inflicted sung like ice in his veins.  It hit him like a punch in the stomach, and a wave of bile rose in his throat.
FRED: You can do one flavor or multiple – the limit here is your imagination, folks.  But they must be uniform in size, shape, and deliciousness.
“Oh, Minerva will announce all that tomorrow.  Nothing strenuous, of course – just a bit of chaperoning and coordinating, really.  Can’t thank you enough.”  Suddenly, he was a whirlwind of motion; he was nearly to the door.
Then came panic – that his first thought could be so heartless; that no matter how long he lived, change never ceased to be terrifying.
He slid into his usual seat in front of Malfoy, glancing again at the boy while trying not to seem too obvious.  “Err, what do you think?” he mumbled, looking up in time to see Malfoy’s eyebrows jump up his forehead again.
