"Ummm, I don't think I have... Are you sure I even have a soul mate? Couldn't this all just be a coincidence?"
Harry was a bit staggered by Dobby’s truth and seriousness, "I was worried that you hated Draco like you do his father."
That puzzled frown crossed, "That is the part that isn't quite adding up. I have never heard of a case where a soul-bond has been felt before the seventeenth birthday. Although there may be a few signs before coming of age, such as your inclination to remain a virgin for your mate..."
Harry knew that most everyone expected him to become an Auror after graduating Hogwarts, but he had no wish to see any more lives lost. As soon as he could fulfill the damn prophesy and face Voldemort once and for all he was done fighting. He would find a nice quiet cottage somewhere in the countryside, floo to the Burrow each Sunday for dinner, go over to Ron and Hermione's and play with their kids (if they ever admitted their feelings for each other!), and just lead a nice quiet life. He may even find a nice young man to settle down with, but Harry wasn't too sure that would ever happen.
"We will have to figure something out. Maybe I can steal Hermione’s notes for you." Harry wanted to keep his mate happy, and if that meant a little extra work, so be it, "So, how was your day? Did you rest? Are you feeling better? Do you feel up to eating? I know it is early for dinner but you haven’t eaten all day so…”
Harry gave her a sardonic smile, "Somehow it always seems to find me, regardless!"
"In very rare instances magical creatures share soul-bonds with a true soul mate. This is the mate that they are destined to spend their life with. Occasionally when a Hogwarts student comes into a creature inheritance it is found that they are soul-bound to another creature."
Harry paused as he and Draco stood to head towards the library, “Whimsy, would there be a way to get the magic running in the house again? So that you could use magic?”
"Yes, ma'am." Harry managed through his embarrassment.
"Dobby, would it be ok if I let you just wear your clothes. I like the way you dress, it shows your personality." Harry loved seeing just what Dobby would come up with next.
Harry sat up straight, eager to hear what she had come up with.
Harry was staring at his hand. He had been training in wandless magic for about a year now, but it was difficult and took concentration for even the simplest spells. And yet he had just caught Dobby without a wand and without thinking of a spell. Harry had avoided using his wand all day, remembering the odd actions of his magic the night before. Now he wondered if it was really his wand that had gone haywire or his magic. Harry looked up at Draco wondering if the blonde had any answers for the thoughts that hadn’t even coalesced into questions yet.
"Dobby thinks it would be alright. Maybe justs gives Dobby a small thing, like a pin, or something that Dobby can wear all the time."
"Yes, Harry Potter, Dobby is finding everything you is asking Dobby to find!"
"I haven't been...abstaining because of that." Harry interrupted, blushing to his roots again.
Harry checked to make sure that Myrtle was not in her bathroom before entering and calling for Dobby, who popped into existence a moment later. He was carrying a small box under his arm and smiling broadly.
"It is a subconscious instinct, dear. Also depending on you and your mate's personalities you may have also done some posturing or showing off to them if you have met them yet that is."
Draco looked as perplexed as Harry felt. The whole group stood in silence until Harry scratched the nape of his neck awkwardly, "Well, that is new. So let’s get dinner out."
Harry had a sinking feeling in his stomach, "I don't have any creature blood in me though, do I?"
"Dobby would do anything to help his best friend, Harry Potter!"
"So you don't mind?"
Harry laughed and his friends waved as they left the common room heading down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast. Harry let out a sigh of relief and double-checked the supplied that he had grabbed for Draco were safely stowed in his magically expanded backpack. He then headed out towards the girl’s loo, eager to see his soul-bonded.
Whimsy didn’t quite know how to respond, and Draco came to her rescue, “And I appreciate Dobby’s candor. He was my family’s elf when I was a child and he made my lonely hours a bit less empty, even if I didn’t appreciate it fully at the time.” He ended apologetically.
Dobby smiled and nodded as Harry opened the entrance leading into the manor.
When she did speak the sudden sound of her voice in the stillness made Harry jump. "How old are you now Harry?"
To Harry’s surprise, Dobby didn’t gasp in shock, or act disgusted and repulsed. In fact, Dobby looked pensive for a moment, a rarely seen expression on the little creature’s face. After taking a moment to think Dobby smiled up at Harry, "Dobby is glad that Young Master Draco has found a safe place with Harry Potter. That house was so dark, Dobby thought that the dark would either eat up the young master or corrupt his little soul. Dobby didn’t think that he would be able to find an escape."
"It is a longs and sads story, Harry Potter. Dobby will tell you if you like, but maybe better for later."
For this reason, Harry kept his sexuality quiet. It wasn't as if he was looking to date right now anyway. He was far too busy to deal with relationships, and Harry knew himself well enough to know that he was just not the type for casual flings like Seamus or Lavender. He did not understand the allure of shagging a random bloke and then walking away. Maybe it was due to his loveless childhood, but Harry dreamt of forging a deep bond with someone even more than he dreamt of sex.
A few minutes later had Harry and his mentor sitting in her cozy office into armchairs by a crackling fire. Harry sipped at his mint tea and relaxed into the welcoming cushions. Madame Pomfrey looked him over with a discerning eye before starting, "So, tell me about these feelings Harry."
As they reached the entrance chamber Harry realized that he had forgotten to mention something, "Oh Dobby, I almost forgot, there is another house-elf here. She has been alone practically her whole life, and since the house’s magic has faded to next to nothing she has suffered much on her own. She has been very kind and accepting by letting us stay here."
"Thank you, I think I would like that."
Harry chortled, "Oh, believe me, there are some things I definitely don’t want to see, much less join, you and Ron doing."
"Thanks, Dobby. There is a problem though." Dobby stopped immediately and looked serious for the first time since entering the room.
"Where do they sell house-elf uniforms? I will have to sneak out and get you one."
"No, not that I am aware of, no. But in extremely rare instances a powerful human is found to have a soul-bond with a magical creature. I believe that this is what is happening to you, Harry. I believe that you have a true soul mate. It is a rare and precious gift to have a soul-bond with another being."
As he started magically stitching the last portion of the internal wound Harry felt his mind pulled away from his task yet again. He was momentarily consumed by a feeling of utter hopelessness and fear, which was quickly replaced with a bone-deep sense that something within him was missing. This had been happening with alarming frequency over the last few months and it was causing Harry a good deal of stress. He had no idea where these feelings were coming from, but he often had to fight the urge to go hunting for something. Although what that something was he didn't have a clue. It was making focusing difficult, which was not convenient when one was trying to study for school, practice medi-wizardry, and read every defensive and dark arts textbook in the library.
Dobby’s eyes lit up excitedly, "That is the most generous and wonderful thing! Dobby will treasure it always."
Harry grinned and stood straight, "Do you want to eat here in bed, or would you like to venture out and see if we can use the dining room."
"A creature inheritance is when a witch or wizard with creature lineage comes of age on their seventeenth birthday. On this day they may inherit a few of the abilities of their creature ancestor. This is most commonly seen in France where the Veela and Wizarding populations live in close proximity and bonding is frequent. Fleur would be an example of this. She is a quarter-veela and on her seventeenth birthday, she inherited a slight allure. Although it is very weak compared to the strength of a full Veela."
Harry groaned a little and slouched back in his chair, "Why me?! Why is it always me?"
Harry quickly read over the scroll, frowning at some of the wording and language. Dobby would essentially be giving up his complete right to free will. If a master commanded something the elf would have to obey, even if that required excruciating pain or even death. "Dobby, this is a little harsh."
Focusing back on his viewing mirror, which acted much like a muggle video camera and MRI combined. He was able to view into the patient's body without opening them up. He was currently working on creating a large mirror that could view the whole body at once, but for now, had only perfected a smaller model. The largest obstacle that they had run into thus far was that the operator had to control the mirror themself in order to focus it properly, which meant that they had to do magic with both hands simultaneously. Harry was nearly ambidextrous, allowing him to pick this up much more quickly than Madam Pomfrey had. He attributed this to his Quidditch training, where he would force himself to practice catching the snitch with both his left and right hands while steering his broom with the other.
"Thank you, Harry Potter!" Dobby gasped as Harry lowered him to the ground with just a thought.
"I know Hermione, don’t worry. I got some stuff I want to get done anyway." Harry grinned at his friend.
"How can Dobby help?"
Dobby flung himself at Harry and squeezed.
Since my other epicly long fic has finally wrapped up, I have decided to start updating this fic twice a week! Thanks for everyone's comments, love hearing from y'all!
"Can say that it is my business. But it is not an easy path, dear, not easy at all." Madame Pomfrey sighed.
Dobby squealed in delight, "Harry Potter likes Dobby’s clothes?! Dobby can’t believe it."
"Can you just wear whatever you like, and that be your uniform?"
"How do we go about this then?"
"Ok. But if it can be anyone how do I know if I have found them."
"Harry, you absolutely positive that you don’t even want to come to the feast?" Hermione asked for what had to be the hundredth time, or at least it seemed that way to Harry.
“I won’t let anyone hurt you, and if they try I will blast them to bits,” Harry said honestly.
So, y'all want the good news or the bad news first? Good news, ok!
Good news, I already have the next chap written so it will be out next week.
Harry vowed that he would change this. He may not be a pureblood, but he was the heir of two of the most influential houses in the Wizarding World, the Potters, and the Blacks. He was also The Boy Who Lived, and although he had never wanted nor used his celebrity for personal gain, he would for this. He would be a healer and he would save lives...if he survived long enough to do so.
Harry was snapped out of his troubled thoughts and quickly placed his final stitch and banished the detached appendix. At least he was able to perform the entire surgery with magic without ever having to open up the cadaver. If it had been a living human being his distraction could have caused serious complications.
"Alright, but if you want to join us, anytime, you can."
His friends couldn’t quite seem to manage a coherent response, which just made Harry laugh louder as he exited the Great Hall. Instead of heading towards the library Harry headed to a rarely used classroom down the hall. He pulled out a change purse that he always carried on his person. Inside was a collection of charmed galleons that connected him with all his friends. After the success of the galleons with the DA, they had personalized the coins so that they could be used for safe, untraceable communication. There was no risk of owl interception if one used the galleons and it was much more convenient, more like texting on a Muggle phone than anything else.
Alright time for the bad news, I was hit by a freaking scooter while I was walking my dog (not like a kid scooter like a mini-motorcycle scooter). I now and the proud owner of a fractured clavicle and recently dislocated shoulder...aaand of course that means my right arm is now bound to my side for the next few weeks. I am horrible at typing with my left hand and my 'actual job' is now taking me for flipping ever. I will write and post as I can but expect things to be a bit slower for the next few weeks. On top of that, since I had to go to the hospital for treatment, I am under full quarantine for the next two weeks in case of virus exposure and am supposed to stay in my room away from the family. *Sigh*
"Young Master is being cold and cutting, but only in front of others. When Young Master Draco is alone he is being just playful, but a bit bossy."
Their table was so full that Harry was sure they could have fed all of Gryffindor. The two elves sat across from the boys, on a few books Dobby had conjured with a snap. Harry made sure Draco was filling his plate before reaching for his own. They were all silent for a few minutes while they ate, Harry being sure to watch that both Draco and Whimsy were eating enough.
This chapter features an amputation. It is not physically graphic but is very emotionally charged. If this is a trigger for you may want to skip!
Have the boys found a place to rest?
"Hmmm, very odd indeed. Well, Harry, I have a theory, but I cannot confirm that this is the true issue since there are some inconsistencies in your case."
Harry was equal parts amused and horrified at the conversation. Whimsy seemed horrified for an entirely different reason altogether as she tugged on Dobby’s bright orange sleeve. Dobby immediately turned obviously adoring eyes on her. She hissed softly, so Harry could only just hear her from across the table, “You can not talk in such a way to a wizard!”
Whimsy stepped out from the side room fully into the light from the lumos that Harry had cast the night before that was still burning merrily among the rafters. As she did so Harry heard Dobby gasp softly next to him before the little elf tripped over his feet and went tumbling down the stairs. The box he was still carrying flew up in the air and Harry caught it instinctively before reaching out with his hand, his magic extending out from his fingers and catching his little friend before he hit the store floor below.
Harry felt his face flame even hotter as he shook his head no.
"Don’t overdo it, Harry," Hermione cautioned, "Take some time to relax."
This chap has some warnings for a certain medical procedure. If you are squicked out by that sort of thing I will add  details in the end-notes and you can go prepare yourself before you read.
"But I am only sixteen. Didn't you say that you didn't feel a soul-bond until you are seventeen?"
Ron chuckled and swatted Harry’s head as he walked by muttering "Git," under his breath.
Due to the use of potions and charms, wizards seldom had to perform surgeries. Problems arose when wizards did require more complex, or subtle, medical procedures. Wizarding diagnostics were sorely primitive. Oddly in a Wizarding hospital, one was more likely to die from appendicitis than a dark curse. Curses were easily traced and had counter curses; whereas general healing charms only went so far to cure natural disease. Wizards had no access to muggle imaging and diagnostic equipment. If a person was suspected of internal injuries or disease the only way wizards had to fix the problem was to cut them open and hope to find the problem in an exploratory surgery before the patient passed away. They also had no concept of genetic diseases, blood work, transfusions, or many other common muggle medical practices.
Harry shook his head, "No ma'am."
Whimsy looked torn but she nodded, her eyes kept flitting to Dobby then away. Whereas Dobby seemed unable to tear his gaze from the petite elf for even a moment. Harry had a sneaking suspicion that romance may be about to bloom. That made him wonder about elf relationship dynamics. Did elves date? Did they get married? They obviously had to have children, no matter how long their life spans, which Harry knew were about twice that of wizards. Not wanting to think about elf procreation Harry focused his attention back on Draco as they entered the cavernous dining room. It was a bit dim and gloomy, but Harry was wary of setting off another Lumos with his magic so unstable. As if reading his mind Draco squeezed his hand and swished his wand. With an audible whoosh, all the ornate sconces and one particularly massive chandelier lit with a happy, warm light.
"Why don't you come into my office and we can talk about it over a cuppa?" She smiled warmly. She had become such a comforting presence in Harry's life he decided to take her up on her offer. Maybe telling someone about these episodes would ease his mind.
Draco snorted, but grabbed Harry’s hand and interlaced their fingers. Harry beamed at the blonde, a pleasant tingling shooting up his arm. Part of him wanted to say screw the library, and drag Draco upstairs for a serious snogging session, but the more strong urge was to make sure the blonde was safe and protected. Neither of those things could happen until his magic was acting properly and the house had some protection on it. So to the library, it was....and maybe a little snogging session after they got some work done.
Draco chuckled at the line of intense questions, "My day was uneventful. Whimsy brought me some reading material, although she was adamant that I rest and not trek downstairs to the library myself. I am feeling much improved, and would not object to food."
"Are you sexually active? No need to be embarrassed dear." She repeated serenely.
And with that the elf was off talking in his typical Dobby fashion, a hundred kilometers a second and bursting with exuberance. Even Draco chimed in with anecdotes about the places he had been. Harry supposed that he and Whimsy didn’t have much to add, but both were happy to listen as the others expounded. Somehow the conversation turned to the odd delicacies of the various wizarding communities that the two had visited, which dissolved into a debate on the merits of Italian Singing Clams that still hum even after being sauteed and evidently tickle on the way down one’s throat.
"And this urge that you have to search out something...has it been getting stronger as time goes on."
Harry laughed lightly, "Well he can be a spoiled git, but that is part of his charm."
Hermione’s cheeks flushed slightly but she continued on, "Harry, you are always welcome!"
Glasses clinked as the friends toasted each other, laughing. Harry smiled at his friends fondly. Part of him wished that he could tell them about Draco, but a much larger part of him was more concerned about keeping Draco as safe as possible, and for now, that meant keeping him, his location, and their relationship a secret. He trusted his friends, but his mate’s safety was too important to be left to chance.
Dobby beamed and Harry quickly led him over to the sink and opened it. Dobby followed Harry without question as he led them through the dark and dank maze that ended at the chamber of secrets. While walking Harry and Dobby spoke of the limits of house-elf magic and whether Dobby would be able to side along apparate Harry down to this area. According to Dobby’s senses, there were remnants of powerful wards that had once protected the chamber, but those had long faded. Harry guessed that they had faded along with the magic inside the house and left poor Whimsy without even that to aid her existence. Dobby guessed that he would be able to easily travel back and forth from the Chamber, now that he knew where it was. That gave Harry pause for a moment. Despite the fact almost no one knew of this place, both Voldemort and Dumbledore were aware of the location. And although it was unlikely that either would visit any time soon, it made Harry think about some possible countermeasures they should have in place. He would have to discuss his ideas with Draco and see if what he was thinking was even possible, much less a good idea.
"Well," Harry thought about it a moment, "I guess it started over the summer. Out of the blue, I will be overcome by fear, or loneliness, or anger, or sadness. It only lasts for a second, sometimes less, but afterward, I am always left with a sense of loss...like part of me is missing and I am supposed the find it. It feels so strong sometimes I find myself starting to stand, or leave wherever I am to start looking. Sometimes I feel like I am on the verge of a panic attack or something. Like if I don't start looking right away I am going to fall apart. The weirdest part is that these emotions, the sad ones, they don't feel like mine...if that makes any sense."
"Did you manage to find everything?" Harry asked, he had tried not to overload Dobby with a long list, but there had been many essentials that he and Draco had needed.
Harry thought for a moment, "Oh I know!" Harry dug around in the secret pouch of his backpack until he found the object he was looking for. A miniature Probity Probe given to him by Bill. It was not quite as strong as the ones used in the ministry and Gringotts, but it would still detect if someone was using polyjuice or any other common concealment charms nearby. Harry explained how it worked before attaching it to an old pin he had floating around in his bag and charming it to have a stylized "P" for Potter on the front. "This way you will know that we are bound and it will help protect you from others. If this ever goes off you can come and tell me right away."
"That is part of what I wanted to talk to you about. Remember how we talked about possibly bonding you as my house elf a few weeks ago?"
Harry had accepted his sexuality easily. After all, it is hard to stress about liking other blokes when you are constantly worried about being killed by a madman. That, however, did not make the Wizarding World more accepting of homosexuality. Not surprisingly, the archaic views held by much of the Wizarding population included an intolerance for same-sex couples, just as they did for magical creatures, muggles, and anything else outside the norm. Even many of those pitted against Voldemort held such beliefs. Much of the Wizarding World may not want to eradicate creatures and muggles, but they still looked down on them as they did those who were gay.
"Harry Potter and Dobby can be doing the rights now if Harry Potter is liking!" Dobby snapped his fingers and a parchment appeared with elegant writing across it, "Harry Potter just needs to read this out and give Dobby his uniform."
"I wanted to let you have more time to enjoy your freedom, but I have run into a serious situation and really could use your help." Harry shifter slightly awkwardly. He was never good at asking others for help.
Dobby nodded, "Dobby has no worries about bonding with Harry Potter and Young Master Draco. Harry Potter is Dobby’s dearest friend and Dobby would love to be the house-elf of Harry Potter."
"Nonsense, this person contains a matching piece of your soul. You will be perfect for each other in every way imaginable. Even if it is someone you have known for years as soon as your souls recognize each other you will find an instant companion. It is said that the love of a soul-bonded pair is the strongest there is." It was a little off-putting how the usually businesslike medi-witch was suddenly gushing like a romance novel.
“Well, it is a good thing we are headed to the library. Come on, I will see if I can conjure some tea without flooding the building and you can look up...those house specifics…” Harry waved his hand vaguely.
“Better get washing,” Harry ordered as Draco eased them gently out of the sky. “I won, and I can hardly wait to fuck you.”
“Yeah?” Harry said, and kissed Draco on the cheek, clearly slightly distracted. “Can you tell me all about it while I get ready for dinner? I need a shower, and I suspect I should hear the whole story before we sit down with your Mum.”
"In order for that Hogwarts boy to move on to the next world, the ring he threw into your lake must be found and destroyed. We are hopeful that you can assist us in obtaining it, as what is left of him is wreaking terrible havoc on the school."
“Yeah,” Harry said, and cleaned off his jeans and trainer himself. “I should probably go.”
"I am glad to see you gentlemen." She was looking up from her desk, sounding stern and stressed. Harry recognized the attitude. Robards tended to adopt it when a case was going badly.
“You don’t have to do that,” Draco said, still a bit poleaxed.
Harry snorted quietly, and his face went a little wry. “Well,” he said, and Draco’s heart sank slightly.
"Harry, I hardly know where to start. You know that when you approached me that first time, I was nervous, taciturn. I have no idea why you returned, why you asked me out again and again, why you pursued me. I do know that I am almost unbearably grateful, however. You know I have never been with a man, with anyone at all. That I never let you go so far as to even undress me. But I don't think you know why."
After a moment of staring, Harry grinned broadly at Draco. “Please excuse my tented robes,” he laughed. “Byproduct of some of these spells.”
Harry stared out the window. He felt a deep need to admit something terrible, but unable to do it while looking at Draco at all. "I fear that I'll never be better than a junior auror;" he whispered to the glass and the incomprehensibly rushing countryside. "And at the same time, I go to sleep almost every night at least a bit drunk, and wishing I wasn't an auror at all."
He ran a hand over the table. Immaculate. Not a single muffin crumb, not one drop of coffee, not even a grain of sugar.

Bacterial Vaginosis: Negative
Draco was proud when he realized he had planned the whole day, for all of them. First he’d taken time a few days beforehand to scope out the neighborhood around the park for the best, most private apparition spots as well as choose a place for the blanket. He’d invited Harry, then Ron, Hermione, Millicent and Bhek (who had gently declined). Harry had suggested they invite Ginny and Luna (because apparently those two were now dating?) Draco had agreed and sent them an owl. Friday after work he’d gone shopping and then he had cooked for hours. Saturday morning he’d packed a huge picnic lunch to share with everyone. He’d borrowed the picnic basket from Mother. It was bottomless, and charmed to keep cool foods chilled.
“Well then!” Draco said. Apprehension slipped over his features for the briefest moment, but he wiped his face clean of it, smiled, and opened the door.
Luckily this made it easy to hold off his orgasm, and soon Afelgate was done, his spunk leaking down Mouth's leg, the red-faced healer buttoning up his robes, gathering his parchments and seeking a quick exit.
Harry noted it, but also saw tightness in Draco’s shoulders, the fist shoved in his pocket, the flush of his cheeks contrasting the pallor washing over the rest of his face. It was striking alongside his relaxed stance, half-open arms, smiling mouth.
Harry was standing (barely). His back to his sink, cock out, brain nearly off. “Good,” he wheezed. Draco teased, tormented him with lips and tongue. The back of his throat. Fingertips.

No, Harry heard the elegant chimes of his laughter accompany Teddy’s adorable, high-pitched giggle. Then chairs were pulled and Andromeda called to him. “Harry, it’s fine if you want those crackers. Join us?”
Harry – or his wand? Draco couldn’t tell in the discordant light.
he realized.
"Kisses. A hand-job."
“I’d say dinner’s all cleaned up,” Harry said, making a sweeping gesture at his kitchen, but not taking his eyes off Draco. “Shall we retire to the bedroom?”
"Dittany." Draco said, serious. "Snape."
“Harry?” Neville said, and he finally turned and looked at Harry.
"I'd be happy to ask her," Harry said.
Malfoy's voice was positively sultry and he stepped toward Harry.
“I knew that. I didn’t know
McGonagall's surprise was overshadowed by Harry's enormous grin. "With pleasure, Draco!" he called out enthusiastically, and took the ring from Draco's outstretched hand as Draco moved to hand it over. Harry slipped the ring onto his own pinky as far down as it would go, which was right above the knuckle. It glowed intensely in the light from the window, filling Harry's eyes with it; and then a new voice joined them in their expectant waiting.
“Looks like you need some help with that?” he suggested, voice as smug as he could make it.
“Aunt Andromeda,” Draco said. It all made so much more sense now. Chastened, Draco nodded and followed Weasley back around.
Once Harry pulled his head from the fire, he had Draco brew a large pot of Assam and toast a stack of rye. Meanwhile, Harry scrambled five enormous eggs with chopped spinach and grated cheddar.
Harry watched Draco slowly pull up his pants and trousers, and limp into the tent.
Harry nodded, unwilling to interject.
“Which invitation?” he asked, winking.
"Twice," Mouth whispered. "Potions. The first one was a miscarriage."
“My Lord,” Potter growls, and Draco shivers and rolls them both over without letting his lover’s cock slip free. “Pound me, Harry,” he says. “As hard and fast as you can. Show me your strength.”
“In two hours!” Draco said, triumphantly. A solution! He’d come up with a solution. Harry smiled (he smiled!), picked up his trainers and agreed to return in two hours. Then Draco was saying goodbye and “see you soon” and closing the door. His
Neville was thorough and professional, but he was not swift. They’d had the one brief interview, and had sat alone for the hour since.
“And?” Harry asked.
Draco comes hard, riding Harry’s cock and kissing Harry. Ineptly kissing Harry, he can admit, but he is so focused on that pillar in his arse that he doesn’t mind. He collapses onto Harry’s chest and snuggles down for a moment. His handsomest Guard puts his arms around Draco and holds him close. Draco sighs happily and reaches into Harry’s thick black hair to play and tangle.

It turned out that, as the contract implied, the Wizengamot hadn't invented this for Harry, but had instead drawn on some old traditions and laws. The only truly interesting part was that he now had the right to get both Malfoy and Parkinson tattooed. He only had to decide exactly what, and where.

"Excellent," Harry said, and cast
should punish? Wait… no, perhaps that is what Master tries if rewards fail? Since slaves opposite, then
Harry wanted them to spend time with Draco’s Aunt Andromeda, and the orphan she was raising: Draco’s newest cousin, Harry’s little godson. They ate dinner there. They even tried watching Teddy together once, but Draco was so terrified of taking full responsibility for a baby (even temporarily) that Harry never suggested it again. Thank Merlin.
”Mr Malfoy.”
. He wanted Draco to come because Harry's cock felt good in him. He wanted to be the reason Draco got hard, and the reason Draco came. He wanted to be fantastically, ridiculously good at this.
In his dorm room, Draco put a bit of lube on his fingers, and began to wank more intently.
Stewing silently in shame, Harry thought about what Snape's angry ghost had accused him of. It was true. He was the shittiest auror ever. He'd let the war drag on for far too long. He'd ended the war by standing there and letting Voldemort bounce-kill himself off Harry like he was some sort of inanimate object. Nothing more than a trampoline. How could he possibly think he had the bravery or capabilities to accomplish anything? He should leave Malfoy to this and… what, go back to Auror Robards? Merlin. He was a mess.

But, to his surprise, she actually wanted to speak of Dizon, not his daughters. Landers had been a perfect gentleman, Mother said, looking into her glass of white wine. But she thought, if she encouraged him at all, he would be interested in far more.
Draco had no intention of letting go of this man until he knew for certain what the hell was going on.
Sixty-nining while floating was just like sixty-nining in bed.
“Oh!” Harry said, suddenly. “Almost forgot. Hermione called. There’s been a break in your Mum’s case.”

Wand in hand, Harry opened his door. Malfoy looked… bedraggled. Instead of looking at Harry, his eyes were cast at the floor. Instead of threatened by Harry’s outstretched wand, his own drooped from his robe pocket. His hands were not at his hips, or reaching out to attack. They didn’t offer a handshake. Limp, they barely clutched each other, crossed in front of Malfoy’s robe-covered cock.
"Well, I shouldn't say… not
Ashamed of himself, Harry sank deeper into his seat on the Hogwarts Express.
, looking confused and a bit annoyed. Draco snarled silently across the room at him and asked Pansy to pass the green beans. He made sure not to so much as look toward that part of the room for the rest of the meal.
Molluscum Contagiosum: Negative
Instead of continuing, Draco’s mother glanced around. Though she’d been quiet, Draco cast his own privacy spell.
"I… yeah," Malfoy said.

Harry took a deep breath, let it out, and resisted looking over at Neville. Next he counted to fifty, then – when that wasn’t enough – started listing ingredients to The Draught of Living Death in his head. Everyone said it would be on their NEWTS. Finally, when he was about to check his textbook to remind him whether he needed Valerian root or a Valerian sprig, Neville gave a loud sigh and started to talk.
As the door slipped shut silently, Draco felt himself blush again. Harry had heard! He’d nearly admitted—! But Harry didn’t look alarmed at all.
Bippy?”
“That’s not necessarily far,” Harry said, frowning. “Parts of Wales are only 40 miles away. Do you know if distance is a factor with this magic? HillSide is over 300 miles away.”
Harry enjoyed the physical attention more than he’d expected.
Draco looked at Harry, nerves ablaze and thrumming. He needed to know. How would Harry react to this?
Draco approves. A Guard is not generally encouraged to flirt with his Lord, but after Draco praised him so, well… it seems appropriate at this particular moment.
Now awake and uncomfortable, the slave would be unable to stay still, and would squirm uncomfortably around the Master's flaccid penis. The connection charm would keep the Master well inserted into the slave, however. So what would otherwise have resulted in separation, would here naturally result in the Master getting another erection, and the cycle would begin again. The Master would wake already fucking his slave, and would find himself ejaculating within Hole or Mouth perhaps as many as five or six times in one night. In the morning, he could break the connection charm, and admire his visibly larger dick in the shower as he washed off the potion. One night in a fanny, one night in an arse, and Harry Potter's dick would be a great deal bigger than it currently was.
“Nope.”
“I really want to watch you fuck me,” Harry said dreamily. “You have such a hot arse.”
he wondered.
“That is miles from where I thought you were going,” Draco admitted.
“Hah,” Draco thought at them. “Look all you like. I’m the one who gets this mighty reaming, not you.”

“It’s purely about manners and honesty,” Hermione continued calmly. “If you don’t lead anyone on, it’s perfectly acceptable to go on various dates while you look for someone who appeals on multiple levels.”
“Turn this office into a disco?” Potter was finally smiling, if wryly.

Draco was grateful when Bippy arrived with a laden tea tray, complete with tiny square sandwiches. He prepared two cups, while trying to decide how to answer Mother.
on Christmas Eve! — continued nonetheless.
“It’s disgusting in here, I know,” Harry frowned. “But it’s why I can Apparate in here?” He scratched uncertainly at his hair. “No one ever uses it? Come on.” He pushed the door open. “Let’s get some crisps and stuff.”
“I cannot release myself from it all without work and time, but I hereby release
Andromeda’s smile suddenly shattered into a thousand jagged pieces. For one heartbreaking moment her face was wracked with pain. Her shoulders bent, and Draco saw the tears that threatened to fall.

“I could’ve guessed,” Harry said, smiling at Draco’s surprise. Waving off the cheque, he dropped a heavy pile of gold on the table. Draco thought it covered their bill and at least a fifty-percent tip. Nonetheless, he reached into his own pocket and added his own stack of galleons.
When Harry sat on the opposite side of the couch, Draco smiled.
“I do get lonely sometimes, with you off at Hogwarts,” Mother mused. Draco grimaced.
Eventually Andromeda picked up Teddy and jiggled the restless baby in her arms as he squirmed and pulled at her ear. “You boys need to talk, and Teddy is tired of sitting at the table. Shall we give you some privacy?”
“This is amazing, love.” Draco said. “I think you've earned a shag.”
Harry lay next to Malfoy, but got a nudge. “You on top,” Malfoy said.
"Because he's
On Thursday and Friday, as expected, Harry was in planning and training sessions all day. Draco found himself trying to apologize to Aurors for his sick day and being rebuffed repeatedly.
Harry looked around and saw from the faces behind her, that it was. Now no one looked suspicious or uncomfortable. Instead, he saw looks of hope, and looks of appreciation. He even saw some gratitude, even though Malfoy hadn't done anything to the map yet.
“I’d love that,” Harry said.
“Friday?” Harry said, ambiguously.
First thing, he realized, was probably to check the tent's rumbling movement forward, since no one was driving. He sat in the driver's seat and looked through the front window. It was clear for as far ahead as he could see. The spells and view screens indicated that they should be able to move ahead on autopilot for quite a while, and if he was going to go back there and tell Malfoy… something, then they wouldn't have to slow down their trip in order to have that conversation.
“Er,” Neville said, sounding a bit nervous.
A man could get used to this kind of sucking up, he decided as he drifted into dreams.
“I should… but
Mr Potter takes responsibility for the costs of room and board for his servant
Harry turned to Malfoy. "You? No Imperius for you. I want to see the hatred in your eyes. But if you do anything… difficult? Both of you will be punished. So do as you are told." Malfoy's eyes blazed quite prettily as he hesitated, nodded once, and stepped behind Harry. His hands and mouth felt so good that the gentle touch almost distracted him from Parkinson's fumblings with his clothes, but when her lips accepted the thrusting head and then shaft of his cock, Malfoy nearly ceased to exist.
"Anything," Malfoy whispered, and Harry put his lips on Malfoy's neck and -licking and biting -- rubbed against Malfoy's crotch with his own until he was hard as a rock, and then until Malfoy came decisively and loudly, his legs snaked tightly around Harry's arse. Then he kept rubbing until his own orgasm exploded through him, a bullet train rushing through his spine and belly, right through his balls and entire dick.
Harry sighed.
"Thought you wanted to talk?" Malfoy said, his face burning red and his eyes glinting fiercely. He took the head of Harry's cock into his mouth again and sucked on it slowly.
misunderstand loyalty that badly, wouldn’t you, Smith?” Harry said, pretending a conversational tone.
And that was completely aside from the reality that if Harry allowed himself to orgasm right now, he’d never fall asleep.
“You enjoyed my company enough to endure me at the dinner table?”
He didn’t usually indulge so fully when the sun was up, but — checking the time — he saw that he had not been wrong about having the time for a thorough wank. He went languidly through the motions of cleaning his skin and his dildo. He stripped the extra blanket off the bed and put it in the laundry hamper. He put his toys away and stretched luxuriously, then dressed.
Draco put his soup spoon down and stood - with so much force that his chair almost fell over. He paced over to his fireplace and stood there, facing Harry and working on not clenching his fists at his sides.
"I'm glad, Harry. Off with you, then. Let's get this done."
Harry wanted to officially meet Draco’s Mum.
Draco did so enjoy giving head. He’d been shocked when they had explained this would be a requirement, but he could understand their reluctance to hire him. Certainly no one else wanted him around, or to entrust him with anything important.
"What?" he replied, confused.
. He threw some powder in the fire and Flooed over to his second home, trusting Andromeda could help him understand himself.

Mother nodded, desolate. She knew this story better than he did.
“No more cumbersome trips because we left behind a damn umbrella or cloak or whatever in our other house,” Harry added.
Draco’s sweat pooled. His brain slowed down. This wasn’t actually happening.  Draco couldn’t be here, right now, with
Worse, the damn Sorting Hat was there too, still speaking with Snape's pinched mouth. McGonagall, despite her usual kind firmness, seemed almost eager to get rid of the two young men, and Harry felt a bit powerless to stop the rollercoaster. So he learned how to use the tent, how to use the tiny kitchen, how to operate the emergency hatch and where the chocolate was.
They were powerless in the throes of this mutual fit of laughter when McGonagall found them. Harry saw her feet and tried to regain control. Malfoy succeeded first but not by much. Smiling, tired, they both clambered back up onto opposite benches at the Ravenclaw table and apologized to the headmistress.
“Look,” Draco interjected. “Do you want to fuck, or not? Because I have books to read and letters to write.”
want to come?” he murmured, swivelling his hips, stroking one hand over Harry’s tight abs.
“Aren’t you too hard to piss?” Harry said, impaling himself further.
mean?”
Narcissa dismissed this with a wave of one hand. “You’re a mother,” she said. “You never once violated Dora’s privacy in order to keep her safe? Never read her diary? Never did a blood spell to track her location? Never researched a friend’s father to make sure he wasn’t a pervert before your precious baby slept at someone else’s house?”

, like Lucius, like my father, have made it abundantly clear throughout my life: they find witches to be inferior. Because we take them inside ourselves, willing or no, and they feel superior because they,” she flushed and looked down. “Forgive my blunt words,” she said.
“You talked to Andromeda about me?”
“I fancy you,” Harry repeated, to Draco’s astonishment. “I’m confident I can craft the best Living Wards nonetheless. But you should know.” Taking a deep breath, Harry visibly calmed himself.
“I see,” she said, blandly.
"Embarrassed," Malfoy said. "You were embarrassed. Because it was me."
At a nod from the Merchieftainess, Malfoy raised his wand for the first time since they'd begun talking with the merpeople, and said, simply, "
Basically, Draco was remarkably uncomfortable, but he wanted — so much — to get used to this. To Harry. To being… Harry’s.
They were the last ones to leave the classroom, and Malfoy was blocking the door. “Excuse me,” Harry said, trying hard to be polite, despite everything. But Malfoy didn’t move.
“That’s right,” imaginary Harry said in a self-assured, demanding voice that was completely unlike the imaginary Harry who brought muffins to Draco’s kitchen. “I’m the King, and you’re my convenient, tight little fuck-hole.”
“Neville,” Harry said, turning his head.
Dumbledore interrupted himself to pop a candy in his mouth, and as he chewed on it he offered one to Harry yet again. Impatient, Harry shook his head "no." Finally, Dumbledore was done chewing.

Draco took take pity on him. Jiggling and resettling the baby, who was (annoyingly) reaching for Harry (at least he’d stopped fussing), Draco drew himself tall. He reached deep into his past, seeking that once-permanent feeling of superiority he’d held so dear — before the war came and destroyed damn-near everything Draco valued and understood.
So, Harry parked the tent and made his way back to the cot in the back that Malfoy had taken that first night in the Black Lake.
He particularly liked to ‘pick Harry up’ as dinner ended on nights when they had their standing fuck date.
Draco paused, uncertain. He sensed an opportunity, but tongue-tied, he wasn’t sure how to avail it. To his surprise, Mother spoke again, though he’d not answered.
“Purely precautionary,” Harry said, attempting unaffected and feeling his failure. “We don’t know how many criminals were in the kidnapping ring. If your spells caught everyone.” Harry shook a little, eager not to say goodbye yet. He continued as smoothly as possible, aiming for cocky while probably landing closer to desperate. “What if the wards on your home have been breached?”

Harry found it difficult, suddenly, to traverse the 20 steps to the surveillance display.
“Thank you,” Mother said, and swept herself away. Draco nearly followed without speaking, he was still so flustered. Then he caught himself.
Harry put his knife down. Oh, shit.

"It would depend primarily on the slave's innate magic. Only a fairly strong witch or wizard could sustain as many as three magical components to a slave tattoo. Since through history few strongly magical people have landed themselves in sexual slavery, it is rare for one to be capable of sustaining three. However, with your slaves, it would certainly be worth an attempt, if you wished. Historically speaking, their situation is quite unusual. Their age is a factor in your favour as well."
always masturbate. This very afternoon, for example, and for the first time since he had started getting erections, he could not. Instead of diving deep into any of his favourite fantasies of submitting to Harry Potter, Draco had instead wallowed in every insecurity he had ever had. He’d found a couple of new ones, too, and damn — were they potent.
Eventually, curiosity won.
Harry opened the door to the sparkling bathroom: long and thin, there was a door at the other end. Harry led through, and opened it. “My room,” he pointed. “I’ll be close by tonight.”
Malfoy leaned back, scowled. “He’s my cousin, Potter. I thought you knew.”
"Not to mention my idiotic Slytherin protégé'! If anyone deserves to clean up my messes it's those two arseholes! Not that Potter has a chance in Hades. I'm sure Draco sees him for the complete deadweight he always is, and is cursing my name for having saddled him with such an incompetent and self-important whiner!"
Mother wanted him to kiss up to Harry Potter. What kind of man would that make him? Hell, what kind of son? What kind of person?
Happily, Harry Potter had no such uncertainty, and he took charge. Then Merlin shined his heavenly light upon them, Salazar Slytherin clapped Gryffindor on the shoulder, cute angels sang, and Harry and Draco’s cocks were rubbing hard against one another. It was without any question the best sensation in the history of nerve endings.
"You do this a lot?" Harry really hadn't expected that.

“Yes,” he said. “Please.”
Harry nodded.
Draco thought his eyes might bug out of his head, but he controlled himself, took a breath, and thought. Then, feeling braver, he nodded.

He smiled broadly at Draco, and in return, Draco found himself smiling back, almost relaxed. “Where are we going?” he asked, as they stepped onto the street. “How do we get there?”
“I think our new Defense teacher could use your assistance with the practical parts of the curriculum. Would you be willing to lead a club again, to practice some of the spells?”
Shocked, Harry felt blood rush to his cock. What the hell? This was the second time Malfoy had implied a desire to do sexual things with him, and both times his body reacted as though he wanted it too! Since when was he a shirt-lifter? Since when was he gay over Malfoy?
Could Draco stand to be Harry’s dirty little gay secret?

Draco was almost dismayed to learn that whilst naked, Harry had not only a cock, but kisses, hands, words, teeth and … a whole body, really. With lots of warm skin, strong muscles, big hands and loud appreciation for Draco’s beauty, tightness, heat and pretty mouth. Thus making naked Harry a great deal more sexually satisfying than a mere dildo.
Panting, Harry rested his forehead against Draco’s nape. He was still hard, still inside. But he’d finally come in Malfoy’s heavenly arse.
"Yes," she whispered.
“What do you mean?” Harry said, his brow creasing with confusion.
“Well, I have an idea. Might be too difficult for you, though.” He winked.
Harry's hair was as thick and soft as Draco had dreamed it would be.

The memory faded as Harry heard Mrs. Malfoy, walking from the nursery with Draco still in her arms, trying to explain to her husband how cute the shoes were.
Harry lowered his eyes to Draco’s. They both tried a tentative smile. When they each saw the other’s smile, both of their faces bloomed with relief and joy.
“Whoa!” Harry said, pulling him in and laughing. “Why so nervous?”
“It is wonderful news,” Draco said with equal ice, “because I am
Harry hadn’t wanted to eat in the wizarding world. Or walk, or be seen. Harry worked with Draco five days a week, but had never once approached him about a date when they were at the Ministry. Was he hiding in that way that Draco had come to see Harry so often did — just seeking some privacy — or was he hiding
Draco’s name, but bravely, Draco stands tall.
“That is a kind offer.” Draco said slowly. “I might accept.”
"I still don't see anyone behind us," Draco said as Harry steered around a school of fish. "Good," Harry said, slowing the craft. "Because that engine noise sounds terrible."
Harry looked at Draco. His ears were burning red, he was scowling, the label on his beer was utterly ruined. He was desperately embarrassed, Harry realized. “You probably think boys shouldn’t love babies,” Draco muttered. “You probably think that’s gay.”
“I’ve excellent hearing,” Harry said, chagrin on his face. “Look, why don’t we just… tumble into bed,” Harry tried. “Get nerves outta the way. We can revisit upgrading your wards later.”
“I would be there for, er, most of the extractions.” Harry blushed deeply. As much as he wanted Draco, this hadn’t been what he’d envisioned at all.
Draco's intention was to be sitting comfortably in the parlour with a book and sipping wine when Harry arrived. As the minutes ticked by, however, his feigned self-possession crumbled, and he second-guessed every decision he'd made since he left Severus' home. The music, the food, the robes, the wording of the note he had finally owled to Harry, the choice to attempt this reconciliation in the first place, the colour of the tablecloth. Nothing was too silly or too sacred, no water too far under the bridge to be worried at and picked over in his mind. He sat, he stood, he paced, he held onto the window casement, he picked up book after book trying to find one that would distract him.
As he'd listed off things Harry had never thought to dream of, and some he'd never
Draco inhaled, working to stay calm. Mother’s progress was so fast, he feared getting whiplash. “Mother,” he said. “Thank you.”
“I see,” Draco said, deliberately giving a non-answer and seasoning it with his own most enigmatic smile. “What about kissing?” He smoothed his hand up from Harry’s abs, to Harry’s waist. There, he gripped.
“Hm,” Neville tried, and he finished his scone. “What about that handsome blond guy in Ravenclaw, the seventh year. I think his name is Willem?”
He’d been avoiding his Pensieve. He’d vowed not to view stolen memories. Hermione’s innocent words about “manners and honesty” had filled Harry with guilt. He’d shown Malfoy not a lick of either by thieving access to his nudity, memories of his body.
“Let’s find out,” King Harry said, and Draco took the hint and wrapped one hand around the King’s shaft, wrapped the other around the King’s balls, and took the already exposed head of the King’s uncircumcised cock into his wet mouth. The taste was clean skin, a hint of sweat, a touch of bitterness in the precome already beading at the tip. He started with a firm suck, listening for the other man’s reaction, which was immediate and vocal, if not loud.
"I can't help but notice that I clearly
Draco was guiding Harry off into a hallway, but still inside the main bank. Laughing nervously. Saying something about this meeting being a happy accident. Suggesting the world didn’t need to hear them catch up.

him for a bit, right?"
Soon their meals were completely eaten, their lemonade was drunk, and when Harry suggested they get a second order of chips and linger over it, Draco felt forced to demur. “I really am quite full,” he said, finding it strange to wish he was still hungry.
France never quite felt like home, but teaching increasingly did.
"I look pretty good with your dick filling me up, Healer," Mouth sighed lustily, and Afelgate stared at his hands in the mirror, pulling his hand off Mouth's clit and changing the way he caressed her tits.

the power emanating from that thing. Won't it be dangerous to Draco?"
Draco sat down, hard. “Holy hell,” he said in a harsh whisper. “Do you think that’s where this is coming from? Sexism?”
"About sunrise, I'd guess," Malfoy said. "France is really big. We spend the whole night travelling through France. Didn't you look at the map in your ticket?"
“Anything,” Draco agreed, and kissed Harry between his shoulder blades. “Just tell me when.”
), and blearily pulled on a dressing gown before opening the window. It waited patiently while Harry fumbled the rolled letter off its leg. It didn’t nip Harry’s fingers or beg for a snack.
“What’s it called?” Draco asked. “What color is the cover?”
“Oh,” Draco said. “Well, we had talked about that before, hadn’t we?”
. All this foreplay stuff is nice, it’s good! But Harry, you’re a top, and I’m a bottom, and it’s time. You keep buying me food! And you want everyone to know! What, I mean...
Instead of answering, Draco looked down and blushed to the tips of his ears.
Draco gave Harry a tentative smile. “We don’t have to choose,” he stated slowly.
“Y’know,” Harry mused as they read in bed before turning off the lights, “I think I’m honestly going to miss your Mum while she’s in South Africa.”
Draco blanched.
Harry came a third time while he rode Draco hard. Harry’s old friend of a wedge pillow was back under Draco’s arse; adding energy and thrust to their every bounce.
“I’d love one,” Draco said – impulsively, from the surprise on his face. “Where’s the kitchen? You can show me how to make a sandwich. Can I make my own?”
"Sleep well," he told her. "You have six hours till the healer gets here. And I'm going to offer you up to lick her fanny, so you'd better be well rested and eager by then."

"Maybe we could work together?" Draco replied, and he sounded shockingly hopeful, so Harry turned and looked at his face, to see what Draco actually looked like right now. He looked lit up from within, like this half-brained idea was the best thing he'd ever heard. Like his dead puppy had just jumped up off the floor: alive, with a winning lotto ticket in her mouth.
Harry Potter pulled Draco’s head in closer to his, and kissed Draco softly on the mouth.
“Dammit,” he muttered. “Why were both Luna and Blaise born in February, anyway? I never know what to get either of them, and now this.”
Granuloma Inguinale: Negative
He’ll play it coy. He’ll decide how he feels while they enjoy each other’s bodies and have few distractions. Maybe when this job is over he’ll feel like taking Draco out for dinner. Maybe Draco will want that, too. But for now, Harry only knows for sure that the sex is glorious.
“It went better than I thought possible,” Draco said, frowning at his half empty glass. “Which is to say, awful, but it could nonetheless have been much worse. I made it clear that if she cannot stop trying to change my orientation she can bloody well move out.”
But he felt it, nonetheless.
knocking at the front door to
“And ride our brooms!”
“I knew that,” Draco scoffed unconvincingly. He finished his beer and stood, moved to peek over Harry’s shoulder. “I won’t learn anything all the way over there.”
“Perhaps we have other properties I’m unaware of. Certainly, you seem to have made some close friends in Johannesburg. Perhaps they would like another visit from you. The point is, you have options of where to sleep. But you will not be sleeping here, not any longer, if you cannot accept the reality of who I am.”
Draco was looking at his aunt, but he nonetheless saw Harry deflate on the sofa next to him.
Anyway, if it’s weird to see me Boxing Day I understand. But I have a house-elf, so maybe you could come for dinner or tea or something? Christmas Eve is better for me. You can leave Draco home if that helps.
Draco looked proud, miserable and rigid. Baby Scorpius, though, was adorable.
“I’m ok,” Harry said dismissively. “You getting sick of this job? You sound done.”
"I think I'm gay," Harry said, feeling shocked.
"Mouth's mouth first," Harry decided, going with the obvious, and quickly slid his cock deep into Hole's constantly magically prepared hole. "Kreacher has such good ideas," Harry sighed into Hole's neck, remembering where that idea had come from. He was already thrusting shallowly into Hole's body, but Mouth was determined, apparently, to earn her rewards too, and her hands were on his skin almost immediately.
Neville collapsed poetically onto his bed, between Harry’s and Dean’s. He released a sigh so epic that Harry gave him a mock glare.
“All right,” Harry said. “Yes.” He stood also and walked from the room, obviously expecting Draco to follow.
Draco breathed in deep, through his nose: slow, slow, slower, until his quivery lungs felt they could burst. Then he held it until he felt capable of speech again.

Harry had, indeed, walked. Blushing red, he nonetheless calmly discussed the weather, which was blustery, wet, and chilly, especially for mid-May. As they ate their muffins, Draco struggled to believe that Harry Potter really was in his tiny kitchen – instead of in some bizarre, truncated fantasy he’d conjured in lieu of working on potions.
November, 20—
a lavatory, used by humans, humans who lived here.
Eternally yours,
Dear Harry,
Malfoy glared at him. "Why won't you let Berrycloth have the Keeper position—she's better than you—so you can play as a Chaser instead?"
"No of course not," Malfoy said, finally deigning to look at Harry. "You're only the captain of the team."
I’ve started reading the letters of Raaid el-Qasim and wow they’re old. It’s funny how some of his theories of philosophy (science, I guess, and magic?) sometimes seem completely out of whack, but at the same time I feel like he’s got a point. Like he’s somehow managed to find a grain of truth and is just trying to explain it the best he can, turning the grain over and over and over to study it from all angles. You’re the scientist—what do you think?
"Cheat," he said.
What is it about fire that makes things feel more homey and safe? Some primal instinct in our animal brains? At any rate, I agree: I don’t need to go anywhere, I just want you here.
"Just—give it here—" Harry reached for the cup, expecting Malfoy to lean away from him—but Malfoy froze for a fraction of a second, and then he leaned in, and suddenly he was kissing him. Malfoy's lips were hot, his mouth was hot, and Harry wasn't freezing anymore, if he'd been freezing at all.
"You're fine." Harry put the card down.
Malfoy's eyes were on the door to the broom shed. "Let's strike a bargain," he said. "I destroy whatever the hell it is you're wearing, if you retrieve a broom for me."

I had a cup of coffee and toast for breakfast today. I’m actually trying to quit the cigarettes, damn you. I don’t know what’s happening to me—I feel like I want to elope with you. Not like when we actually eloped, but like…I want to go somewhere with you where nobody knows us and where we don’t have responsibilities. Come to think of it, that’s how our correspondence feels to me. A quiet refuge, you said. Yes. You are my refuge, Harry.
"Thank you, Maude from Swindon," Harry said. Then: "Er, maybe you shouldn't eat those, they might be laced with Amortentia."
“I can’t wait to see your lavatory,” Harry said, following Draco into the forest.
"Well?" Harry looked straight into Malfoy's clear grey eyes, trying to get a read on him.
I had a cup of coffee and a pretzel for breakfast. (I don’t really want to quit smoking. I do it when I miss you, which is always. But for you, no cigarette today.) I’ve been put in charge of making another funding application because we’ve found the site is much larger than we thought. We’ve been excavating what we think are two peasant buildings, for lack of better non-professional wording, as the church was excavated and renovated twenty years ago, and I think we’ve unearthed the edge of a large structure, possibly a community hall or similar. There’s more here.
Malfoy pulled the robe off and dropped it on the pile. "Purple is the colour of royalty," he said.
Malfoy's lip twitched. "
Remembering what else he had in his pockets, Draco put Harry’s tea down for a moment. “I got you a pine cone,” he said, setting it gently on the table.
Dear Harry,
My tent
The train pulled up at the station and Draco gently extinguished the glow and put the half-smoked cigarette back into the pack. A trickle of people exited the station, Draco watching them idly until—there, a shock of black hair and a familiar duffel bag.
Harry was quiet, then rolled onto his side, facing Draco. “What do you want to talk about?”
“I said I—” Draco picked up the letter Harry had been reading. “Oh. I didn’t.” He sighed, and then appropriated Harry’s mug of tea entirely. If Harry wanted tea, he could just make more. (Which he did.)
“We’ll see about that.” Draco smirked. The dig didn’t come into view gradually, as one might expect, but rather one suddenly happened upon it. One moment all you could see was trees, the next you were looking at four archaeologists and a couple of tents in a clearing. “Over here.”
September, 20—
I have to confess I haven’t a Christmas present for you (yet). If you have a wishlist, do enclose it in your next letter. If you don’t all bets are off and I might just bring you a pine cone from the woods in lieu of an actual present.
Mount Tsurugi Hotel Letterhead
P.P.S. Perhaps I should congratulate you on your victory, but that would somehow imply the victory was all yours and not in actuality carried on the shoulders of your eminently intelligent and talented team.
Harry

Yours,
"Try to keep up," Malfoy said, and took off again.
He probably had. Harry was wearing a t-shirt with his face on it and the words
Yours in defeat,
Harry leaned in. "Go on," he said. "I'm right here."
I went to a Muggle bookstore before we Portkeyed back to Russia and onwards, to get those books, and then realised that those people are not Muggles and you probably already have them in the library. I talked to the staff there though and they recommended to me The Letters of Vita Sackville-West to Virginia Woolf, who were apparently very famous writers. I will read it and then tell you all about it.
Today’s breakfast: eggs, toast, tea. Went with orange blossom today for a change. The tree outside the window has lost all its leaves now. I wanted to surprise you next week as we were scheduled for a friendship game in Berlin (I would’ve Apparated to you after the game), but it was cancelled. I’m not going to Berlin next week. It’s in moments like this when I miss you most, when I could’ve had a chance to see you, and then lost it. I’m counting down the days.
I’m glad you like my choices in stationery. It took a while to pick out the paper and I got new ink too, but I wanted to write you letters on something that carried more weight than the scraps I found in your desk. If I’m to write love letters, should they not be on something that does the content justice? Or perhaps it doesn’t matter, and only the words do. I like how this paper feels. It reminds me of you, in a way, like it’s
Yours in heart and soul,
“I miss you too,” Harry said.

Harry didn't look like he understood, but he nodded very seriously and let Draco tell him all about the dig site.
a shitty everything else," Harry said. "This is the only configuration that works!"
Harry laughed and came away from the cooker for a moment to give Draco a kiss on the cheek. “Thank you. I love it.”
R E T I R E M E N T
I’m okay, thank you for asking. (You didn’t.) My emotional state, however, not so. I’m aggrieved. And grieved. I dropped my favourite digging mug listening to the wireless—I swear, I have never heard Lee that terrified before. My heart and mug shattered and while my heart may be on the mend, I’m afraid the mug is unsalvageable.
October, 20—
"Merry Christmas," he said, pointedly.
P.S. I think I’ll go look for some nice stationery tomorrow. Your letters always look so nice.
"Well, fuck," Harry muttered.
"Not to your liking, Potter?" Malfoy plucked it out of the pile and put it on over his pyjamas. The sleeves were a little short. "Ah, yes. Tailor-made. Twilfitt and Tattings, I believe. I recognise the cut."
"It's

Harry considered this. "Deal," he said, and made to pass Malfoy the broomstick he'd been twirling, then took it back. "Shirt first."
I will be
"Sod off," Malfoy said again.
November, 20—
Perhaps what I miss isn’t the conversations so much as the intimacy. That terrifying feeling of vulnerability—do you remember how hard I found it to let you in? It was a thrill in several ways. Exhilarating. Terrifying. I never wanted it to stop. I wanted it to stop. I wanted more, I wanted less, I wanted everything, I wanted nothing. I wanted to hide, I wanted to yell, I wanted all these conflicting things, and now, what I remember isn’t all the ways we shagged, but the quieter moments. How I felt talking to you.
Dear Harry,
"Ugh fine, I'm looking at you," Harry said, taking a sip before passing the cup over. "Just trying to figure you out."
They unwrapped the gift mountain in companionable silence. More sweets emerged, as well as articles of clothing, toys (including a few that were definitely for adults), and good luck charms.
Ah yes, I found the books. Not that your eclectic system of organisation helped. Anything else I should look for?
Draco
Yes, come.
Draco
I’m noticing about the book that it’s a bit worn, like it’s been read many times. How many times have you read it? What do you find in it when you do? I think I’m still discovering it. At first I wondered why Grishina wrote to Niezka so much because it seems like they actually saw each other every day and lived together sometimes? Am I wrong? Why would you write letters to someone you can easily speak to? But I just read a letter that seemed less like a letter and more like an outburst, like she had to get it out before she exploded. Her handwriting slips, she’s in a hurry, and this line—“I have been a strong lover and a strong bluestocking, and I capitulate to you every time.”—I feel like this sometimes! Like, I can do and be all those things and at the same time it feels like you would only have to ask me to give it all up and I would.
, second only to middens) and we are all terribly excited.
"Oh." Harry took a sip of the tea, then passed the cup to Malfoy.
A literal hole in the ground; this is how angry I am
On the subject of love letters. No, for goodness’ sake, do not write me love letters. Or—well, if you truly
I was referring to the incident in which you LEAPT OFF YOUR BROOM, YOU ABSOLUTE FUCKING BABOON, and then FELL TO WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR UNTIMELY, YET DESERVED, DEATH were it not for the swift actions of your blessedly competent teammates.
After suggesting we write to each other more, I suddenly find myself at a loss for what to write to you. Do you want to know what I had for breakfast this morning? What the weather is like? Which of my colleagues is being especially irritating at the moment? Well, I will tell you.
“Mhh,” was Draco’s pleased response.
My rented lodgings
Harry joined him, nudging his mug over. “You didn’t say you were coming home early.”
“I haven’t.” Draco added a splash of cream to his porridge. “Read it to me?”
“Have I told you lately that I love you?”
I was going to write a sharp, but humorous, dig (ha) at you comparing me to stationery, but truth to be told I’m warmed all the way down to the deepest cockles of my cold, frozen heart. I’m charmed. Never stop being you.
"Sod off," he said.
"I was going to say gaudy," Harry said, and resolved to have a word with Twilfitt about letting people order clothes based on his measurements. "The colour doesn't suit you."
Draco
As requested, your green sweets. I’m sorry about sort-of-almost-dying. Would it help if I told you I was acting in the spur of the moment? I saw a chance and I
"Why don't you find out?" Harry retrieved the Snitch from his pocket, holding it in a loose grasp right under Malfoy's nose, the silvery wings fluttering against his palm.
“Hi, stranger,” Draco said. “You’re up early.”
Yours,
The team is heading to Scotland tomorrow for a boot camp, then to France for a game. I’ll come down early to see you on your dig after—unless you’re horribly busy? You can tell me all about your exciting lavatory.
I have the day off and I’m going out later to see Ron and Hermione for lunch and then do some shopping for Christmas. (Today’s breakfast: toast with applesauce and cinnamon tea.) I have already decided your Christmas present, so any attempts to hint at something else will be ignored. (I love you.)
Harry polished off his croissant, glancing at Malfoy from the corner of his eye. Was he blushing? No. Probably just the cold.
Malfoy accepted it. He twirled it thoughtfully, looking between Harry, the broom shed, and the far distance over Harry's right shoulder. "Race you to that peak over there?"
“You could come to mine? Share tea or ale or whatever?”

“Was dinner edible?” Draco asked after Mother left. She would expect them to join her, but they could take a few minutes alone. “I could hardly taste it, I was so distracted.”
Harry put away his Map and chose to leave his bag behind. Malfoy was easy to find, as he was walking out of the Great Hall with Crabbe and Goyle when Harry was about to enter. As he always did these days, Malfoy looked terrible. Tired and far too thin.
“Oh,” Draco joked, “I had a professional install them. Top of his field. No one you would know.”
Harry was too surprised to respond, and Neville continued into the quiet.
“Fuck me on my knees?”
“The answer is yes?” Draco interjected.
,” Draco said, exhausted, having forgotten his original intentions.
As he felt himself hardening in his sex slave's mouth, Harry tipped his head back and laughed.
“Hm,” the Litigator checked her notes. “Looks like he was a Slytherin also, two years before you.”
Draco blinked. He looked at Harry. Harry squeezed his hand, but stayed quiet. Draco paused, but Mother merely waited, gazing peaceably out the window.
Potter leaned over, his palms flat on the table. “Why?” he asked, and Draco couldn’t think of a single reason, even though he knew he had plenty of them. “I… can’t remember,” he said, feeling short of breath. Then he remembered. “But I have a list! I have thirteen reasons! I wrote them all down!”
Worried — Harry rushed through the Floo. “Are you ill? How’s Teddy? What’s wrong?” he asked, panicked.
Grinding his arse into Harry’s erection, Draco milked the last drops of come from his cock as best he could while clothed.
"I've been thinking about all the things we were both saying," Harry confessed, not able to look at Draco. Instead he looked at his own hands, clasped earnestly -- almost ridiculously -- in front of himself. "I haven't been willing to quit my job because, well, basically, what the hell else would I do? I know from when they make me take holiday, I go a bit nutty without work." He felt himself blush, but Draco murmured something encouraging sounding, so he kept bumbling forward.
“Care to share?” Harry asked, feeling lightheaded.
“Mum and I disagree,” Draco replied, stiffly.
“I don’t want anyone else to define this for us,” Harry said, sounding determined again. Draco loved the way Harry could sound like nothing in the universe would keep him from his goals.
He honestly loved the way Draco was constantly touching him in public. The never-ending affection seemed to mend a hole in his soul he’d plastered over long before, then promptly tried to forget.
“We record tonight,” Draco panted. He was trying to rip off his shoes, but his trousers were in the way. “Sex, sleep talk, everything.”
“Yeah?” Harry asked as they stepped into the lobby. It was empty, and Draco didn’t know whether to be pleased or disappointed. He had neighbors who would surely be a great deal nicer to him if they saw him stepping out with Harry Potter, of all people.

“You live… with your parents?” Harry swallowed, knowing even as he did it that Draco was watching this evidence of his inelegant, obvious nerves.
“Perhaps,” Draco said. “Or perhaps you underestimate your own willingness and ability to tell the rest of the world to take a flying leap.”
Panicking, Draco hardly noticed the silence between them. He had to say something. He had to figure out what Harry actually wanted, the real reason he had shown up at Draco’s door with tea and muffins.
Harry entered the sitting room to see Draco and Narcissa studying a colorful, topographical globe. Narcissa did a spell to compare the sizes of England and Africa (it was almost ludicrous how small their island looked superimposed upon that enormous continent), another to show Draco a map of her planned journey with Dizon, then one to help discern travel options for visiting her newly re-found friend, Cellenina.
Draco looks at Weasley, who nods. Draco continues to stroke the shaft of his Guard’s massive silken cock.
“Gnuh,” Potter moans, and he pushes forward, nearly unseating himself. Draco doesn’t waver even slightly, despite Potter’s uncoordinated movements. “Gonna come soon.”
He did, honestly, want to find a reasonable way to show Harry his gratitude. He had, of course, shaken the man’s hand and thanked him after he’d been offered the job, and he’d written him a formal thank you letter after his first day, but that didn’t seem adequate, really. Not like the blowjob he longed to offer but didn’t have the courage to speak of under any imaginable circumstances. Still, someday he’d thank Harry properly….
have not accepted it too late for us.
“He did not deserve it,” she finally finished. Draco felt his breath stutter.
Smiling sadly at himself, Draco sat at his desk. If he no longer had the concentration for potions research today, he could nonetheless write a letter. “Dear Blaise,” he began. Then he stared out the window. He didn’t want to bore Blaise with talk of his dragging potions research. As for his job, he’d already told his old friend all the basic details plus every possible entertaining anecdote in the last letter he’d sent, almost a month before.
“No academic talk?” Harry murmured between nips to Draco’s jaw. “Who are you and what’ve you done with my sexy, pedantic boyfriend?”
“This isn’t normal,” Draco finally tried.
He would feel awful using a business’ floo without spending money, but he was confident Molly would love that snow globe, so that was one Christmas present secured, and months in advance, too.
“Sink,” he said. “I’ll show you.”
“Oops?” Harry said. His cheeks turned pink. “Yeah, I mean, I had felt we shouldn’t do anything really vigorous. Or adventurous? But maybe we shouldn’t have done anything at all. Was it ok?”
"Then we shall offer him jewelry in exchange," Malfoy said with assurance, and Harry felt oddly comforted by it.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand in question, but Draco turned to look at Harry and simply shook his head, ‘no.’
Squeezing that perfect round muscle in his left hand, Harry let a stream of consciousness loose. "You feel fantastic riding my dick," he began. "And fuck, you look really hot, too. This makes me want to come. I loved fucking your mouth but this might be better, and your arse feels good in my hand. You're really gorgeous. I love your hair, too. I noticed it right away in her office, I didn't expect to see you, and I was surprised, and I saw your hair, and I wanted to touch it, and that made me mad. And now, I want to touch it, and you're fucking away on my dick like I feel good, like I'm making
“Exactly,” Malfoy agreed, and he blushed. “I’d be open to another.”
“Whassa matter?”
"Has Granger spoken directly to my house-elves?” Draco said, deliberately changing the subject. “Or their Healer?"
He lied without the slightest hesitation. “I don’t stare at you!” he declared, his imaginary crown perched high again.

(Saturday night, as a special Pride celebration for just the two of them, Harry had agreed they could try something new in bed. But that wasn’t for anyone else to know about. Still, Draco kept remembering their plans at odd moments and smiling.)
“Fuck yes,” Draco whined, turning around.
"I want to try everything, Malfoy. After all, I owe you." And Harry winked.
“Ah!” Draco laughed. “Perfect. Want to top for a bit?”
"You probably ought to have the ministry hire an older woman that you trust and like, to interview the families who want you to impregnate their daughters. With what I know of the war, I'd imagine top of your list would be war heroines like Andromeda Tonks and Molly Weasley.
“I think so,” he whispered, and pulled his hands from Draco’s hair. From the kind of gentle scratching Narcissa had lulled Draco to sleep with when he was small, Harry switched to petting Draco’s face, then chest. He kissed Draco’s forehead. He whispered something sweet.
"Silence now, Harry!" Dumbledore did not raise his voice, but his tone was very stern.
Draco wanted to make each fuck last, and soon they were covered with sweat. Eventually though, Harry was allowed to come, and Draco came soon after.
But this did not preclude Draco pressing his (clothed, dammit) arse against Harry’s prominent erection. It did not stop Harry from breathing hard in Draco’s ear. It did not mean Harry couldn’t grip Draco’s hips – hard – and pull.

Draco kissed Harry. Fucked Harry. Watched Harry’s face while Harry spurted come wildly, abandoned. Then Draco fucked Harry some more and came deep in his arse. “You promised me a blowjob,” he chided when Harry’s eyes started to close. “So tired,” Harry whined, and then Draco relented and they napped together for a while.
"Of course, Mr. Malfoy." Dumbledore nodded gravely at Harry, who stood, picked up his bookbag, and left the room. Once the door closed he could hear nothing, so he waited outside the door, wondering if he was expected to stay or go. He feared that, whichever he did, he'd get in trouble. And he was terribly curious. The room was thin and long, a corridor, almost. Ideal for pacing.
Harry grimaced downwards, then sipped his Ice Vodka. “She wants to know if you or your mother will attend.”
“Face me again.” Weasley turns, looking – as always – respectfully just below Draco’s eyes. “It is just as I wished,” Draco says in satisfaction. “All the men are attired as such?” Weasley nods. “The enemy shall run in terror when they see you,” Draco says, and he smiles. “As everyone knows, the larger the penis, the stronger the magic. And clearly, my men have the very largest cocks.”

Harry watched, confused and hopeful.
“Ah,” Harry sighed, looking sadder and less confused.
Draco arrived at work 45 minutes early on Monday morning, which meant he arrived before all the Aurors except Head Auror Bergum and Auror Bērziņš, who were in the Head Auror’s office with the door open, quietly discussing a case that seemed to involve a lot of maps.
Draco waited.
“Yes,” Draco said briefly. His eyes were all over Harry’s skin. “To get a head start on babymaking. My parents only had one. I’m to fix that. Been told a thousand times. I’m to knock up my blonde witch every couple years until she can’t pump any more out.”
if he was to employ a worthy tutor in any of the more obscure classes he wanted to continue with, like Runes and Alchemy.
"Thank you, Filius," the headmistress said instead of chastising Harry verbally. She shook Flitwick's hand and he left with a nod, leaving a blank-faced Malfoy and a disconcerted Harry to await her explanations.
“I think it’s more that you’re taking
“Easy,” Draco agreed, but he looked bored already. “I brought a book.”
“No. Have you?”
"Okay," Draco finally said, and pushed Harry onto his back. "Now I climb on and," he paused, rearranging them both a bit. His arse was hovering over Harry's erection now, and Harry stared intently at the future.
Harry grabbed Malfoy's hand and started to pull the other boy toward the bed, but felt resistance. He turned to see Malfoy, naked, blushing, completely erect and looking at the floor.
Yes, both of them….
taking his sweet time wanking in the shower. But watching himself suck Malfoy’s cock was nonetheless good to get Harry off – every night for the last two weeks.
“Your patience is impressive,” Harry whispered, confessional.
"No, all the crap I fed you was true, obviously. Potter
"Umm, Madame Pomfrey, what if my...mate...what if she... I mean to say I am... I can't...girls..." Harry stopped and hung his head, his first time trying to explain that he was gay and he couldn't even get the words out.
"Harry Dear, are you quite alright?"
Harry contented himself with rubbing circles on the back of Draco’s hand. Merlin, he couldn’t seem to stop touching the blonde. The fact that Draco kept leaning into him, nuzzling into his side every few minutes, made Harry’s chest swell with happiness. He knew that things were still bad out there, there was a war, people wanted him dead, people wanted Draco hurt, and it all seemed to be resting on his shoulders. But right now, with Draco cuddled into him as much as the formal tall backed chairs would allow, Harry felt more at peace than he had ever felt in his life.
Because it is my birthday today, I figured you all deserved the next chapter a day early as a present!
I hope y'all enjoy it!
Dobby gasped, "That is a terrible thing to happen! Dobby will try and makes friends with her. She…she is not like Kreacher is she? Dobby would try to be friends, but Dobby has not liked spending time with Kreacher."
Dobby cut him off with a high pitched squeal, clapping and doing a little jig, "Congratulations Harry Potter!"
Whimsy was still standing awkwardly in the doorway as the small group approached. Harry smiled warmly at the little elf and asked again, "Would you care to eat with us? If not, you are welcome to anything we have."
Whimsy shook her head sadly, “From what I have read when the house’s magic fully runs out it means that the house feels like it has been abandoned. Once that happens the house won’t accept any magic until it is claimed again.”
That night in his bed Harry's head was filled with a combination of wonder and dread at the idea of a soul mate. By the time light started to appear on the horizon Harry had accepted since there was no way around it he would try to make the most of the situation. A small bubble of hope had grown in his chest that finally, he would find someone to love who would truly love him back.
"I will likely go mad if I don’t get out of this room soon, so I would not object to stretching my legs."
"I am fine, ‘Mione. I just want to get a nap in. If Voldemort has anything awful planned I could be up all night with visions and I want to be prepared." Playing the Voldemort card was a bit low, but Harry really wanted his friends to give him some space so that he could sneak away and get to his mate. He had already stopped by the kitchen and loaded up with all the food the house-elves would give him…which seemed to be enough for a small army. Dobby had assured him that now that they were bound he could access Harry’s vaults and purchase any food and supplies they would need, but Harry wanted to make sure everything got settled before he completely stocked their hideout. As it was he had asked Dobby to head to London to purchase a few things that he had thought of and he was going to meet Harry in Myrtle’s bathroom in half an hour.
There was no fanfare, no bright light. All that signified his bond with the house-elf was a slight tingling in his chest. Dobby however, beamed and practically glowed with happiness. Harry held out his arms to his friend, “Welcome to the family, Dobby!”
Dobby looked as if he were going into shock at the proposal, "Dobby would being most happy to join Harry Potter and Master Draco. It woulds be an honor beyond compare!"
"Harry Potter was wanting to talk to Dobby?!" Dobby asked, practically bouncing on his feet.
“I will be taking care of the cleaning,” Whimsy jumped up instantly, but then looked at all the leftovers, “I may need some help with some stasis spells. Since the house’s magic is depleted the storage cupboards will not keep the food from going bad.”
Harry snorted, "Count me out. I know when the third wheel needs to give the other two some space."
"Dobby trusts Harry Potter. Dobby is not worried. It best not to change any ancient magics, can cause big changes."
"I turned sixteen this past summer, about two months ago."
"I missed you," Harry said when he finally convinced himself to pull away enough to let them both breathe.
"Draco, you remember my good friend Dobby. Dobby agreed to bond with me and is now here to help us." Harry had a moment of nervousness as the two greeted each other civilly. Draco complimented Dobby’s vest, which was Slytherin Green, and Dobby smiled widely at Draco.
Harry rooted through the coins until his fingers closed on the one that had Dobby’s name etched into the edge. Typing a quick message to his small friend, Harry then sat back holding his coin for the response. Instead, there was a sharp ‘pop’ and Dobby was standing before him, dressed in baggy green Bermuda shorts, a yellow and orange striped tank top, a teal hip pack, and pink sunglasses. Overall, a less eclectic look than his normal outfits.
Dobby grinned widely, "Oh, I has been having much fun! I has to glamor as a child though and people keep asking if I have lost my mummy."
“The house feels abandoned?” Harry asked.
"I am sorry, Madame Pomfrey. I don't know what is wrong with me lately!" Harry sighed frustrated.
Hermione sighed but dropped the subject. "Ok, we will see you in the morning then."
"If Dobby had full magical stores it would be easy! But Dobby’s magic is low and being a child is much easier to changes the outside a little."
"It is the sacrifice that house-elves chose. No binding, no magic."
Neville grinned at him, "Let me guess, more training?"
Draco curled into his side again and took a deep breath, “You might just do that if we don’t figure out what is going on with your magic. On that note should we clean up and retire to the library?”
Harry nudged him with his shoulder, “Don’t go back there, you are not to blame for how you were raised. It would have screwed anyone up, and look how you are moving past all that!”
Dobby smiled goofily at her, his adoring gaze leaving her momentarily to rest on Harry before finding her again, “Dobby’s master, the greats and most awesome Harry Potter, has assured Dobby that Dobby is to speak his mind on all matters. Harry Potter expects Dobby to be himself above all else.”
"My, my Harry, you are a homosexual?" Harry nodded, looking up at his Mentor for the last three years. "Never would have guessed, even after working so closely with you. I do wonder if your mate shall be male then. I have never heard of homosexual soul mates." Madame Pomfrey looked curious rather than disgusted, which Harry took as a good sign.
Harry shrugged; it wasn't as if he had a choice in the matter no matter what now that he seemed to have a secret soul mate hiding about. "But what if it is a girl and..."
Draco sighed, “Most magical dwellings have a certain level of sentience. The more of a magical concentration that the house contains the higher the level of its consciousness. It is not quite the same as the consciousness of a person, but the house will have a certain awareness and if the magical concentration is high enough to be able to interact with its inhabitants. This is the driving force behind many of Hogwarts' more magical features. The castle is aware of the people inside of it and is able to anticipate some of their needs. Merlin, this educational system is leaving huge gaps in foundational knowledge!”
"Every decade or so we have a student come into a creature inheritance while attending school. Are you aware of creature inheritances?" Madame Pomfrey was in full lecture mode, which prompted Harry to respond as he usually did during their medi-wizard lessons.
"Yeah, I don’t expect Ron will be up for training in the morning so I am going to do some solo running, then I will be helping Madame Pomfrey with some ordering until lunch. I will see ya then."
Harry tried to relax while he waited for her to resurface. He still felt the need to go looking for...something. It was like an itch under his skin urging him to scour the earth until he found his missing piece.
"Yeah, I couldn’t sleep so I did some early flying and then hit the ROR for some jogging." He stretched his shoulders for effect and plunked down next to Hermione. "Oh, and Happy Halloween!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Ok, so I just read this and then it is done?" Dobby nodded and Harry began to read.
"I can, but I don’t want to," Harry said, kissing the tip of his conceited boyfriend’s nose, making him scowl and wrinkle the appendage in a way that made Harry want to do it again. "If I had my way I would shrink you down and keep you in my pocket so I could talk to you all day."
Be safe and well and look out for men on scooters!
Sweat beaded along the brow of Harry Potter's face, scrunched in concentration. He was entirely focused on the detailed task at hand, which happened to be an appendectomy. He was performing the procedure on a recently deceased elderly wizard who had passed away in his sleep from old age. Madame Pomfrey had been scheduling these lessons and surgeries twice a week for him since his third year when he had come to her and expressed an earnest interest in healing.
"Yes! Dobby is very excited that Harry Potter may one day honor Dobby by letting Dobby become his house-elf." Dobby was practically jumping with excitement.
"When do you want to do the rights? Will it take long to prepare?"
"I know you would, Dobby, you are a good friend. You see I have just found my soul-bonded…"
"So, Harry, are you sure you are not going to join us at the dance tonight?" Hermione asked.

P.S. Actually, could you enclose some of those sweets in your next letter? I cannot possibly be expected to wait three whole weeks for sweets.
This time, Harry had no trouble taking the cup from Malfoy. He refilled it from the flask, not taking his eyes off Malfoy, and had a scalding hot sip. "Want some?" Harry asked.
I’ll try.
I’ve almost finished the book. I read the letter you quoted in your last letter, and I think I agree—it’s not her most poetic, but there’s a very strong emotion in it. I understand.
Draco
“And now?”
"Thanks," he said, and passed Malfoy the broomstick.
Yours,
My dig is going well, thank you for asking. (You did.) We’re currently unearthing what we think might have been a lavatory (and you can stop your sniggering at once, heathen, lavatories are the
"Good day, Potter," Malfoy said, his voice barely under control, and left the table.
Harry woke up under a small mountain of presents at the end of his bed. He moved, causing an avalanche—and a big enough ruckus that Malfoy woke up and threw a pillow at him. Harry threw it back.
Maybe Harry should've felt bad about letting Malfoy destroy the t-shirt—horrible as it was, it had been a (probably) well-intentioned gift from the people he was rooming with; an eclectic mix of volunteers and convicts. Malfoy wasn't one of them, and all of Harry's friends who were volunteering to rebuild the castle had been allocated elsewhere. But Harry didn't feel bad—just relief to be rid of the thing.
Draco
I believe Raaid helped pioneer certain disciplines, but frankly I don’t much care since they’re not related to my field. What draws me to him (and Grishina) is that he is as passionate about his work as he is in love with his lover. They both remind me of you.
"No."
Today’s breakfast: two cups of coffee, one with sugar and cream. I cherish your letters, love. I felt that needed repeating; you might not be the most eloquent of humans (I love you) but I can sense the thought you put into them, and I can feel the strength of your emotions (I love you so much).
Malfoy gave Harry a withering glare. "It hadn't escaped my notice. I was just—" He pursed his lips, looking like he'd seen something offensive.
Yours,

November, 20—
I wonder if we’ve both reached a breaking point? Much as I love to complain about muddy fields I do love my work. Right now I’m also looking forward to this particular dig being over so I can come home and write my papers and not go on another dig for months. I want to see you every day.
The weather today is pretty good. It’s crisp, clear. It smells like winter. I think Euan is planning another campfire and sausages (this is why he’s my favourite colleague) and I think I shall be a good colleague and make us hot chocolate over the same campfire.
"There," Malfoy said, retreating. His cheeks were dark pink and he was resolutely not looking at Harry, and he still—infuriatingly—had the cup. Malfoy took a sip.
." Harry snorted and gestured at the air. "In case you missed the giant flying banner with my name on it, or the singing lion that's following me, or—"
I wasn’t going to snigger about the lavatory, but now I think I will. Snigger snigger.
"Nope." Harry picked up the card that came with the fudge. There was a photo of a person on it, presumably Maude. He held it up to Draco. "What are your feelings towards this person?"
I’ve stretched my break long enough, so that’s all for now. I’ll counter with another quote from Raaid: “Oh my soul, we are tired, we are defeated, but we love…”
Draco
Harry turned to look. He felt the air move before he saw that Malfoy had taken off. Cursing, he barged into the broom shed and leapt over the singing lion to grab another broomstick, and then took off after Malfoy.
Yours,
Lavatories might be Draco’s second favourite thing (after middens), but even six-hundred-year-old lavatories could have a certain distinct…smell. It was a hole in the ground—it’d not always been a hole in the ground; it had started as a hole in the ground, sure, and Draco had excavated it until it became a hole in the ground once more, so the lavatory was now back in its original form. More or less. After removing layers of dirt, soil, and burnt materials (evidence that this lavatory had at one point had a wooden structure covering it, and that this structure had burnt), he’d reached the treasure trove: human excrement.
"No other team will have me," Malfoy finally said, brushing crumbs off his lap.
you're a shitty Keeper—"
"If you hadn't woken me up in the middle of the night, I wouldn't have overslept," Malfoy replied. "It's your own fault."
"Was that a pleased 'oh' or an 'ugh'?"
I spelled it out for you so as to not unnecessarily scare you, as I imagine one does with children and ludicrously smart dogs.
Draco
This is not a love letter. No, this is a letter of
“Hello, stranger,” Draco said. Harry kissed him. “Put your stuff in the back.”
"Mmh, whatever you say," Harry said, putting the tea aside. There was something—someone—else who required his full attention.
Malfoy's lips twitched. "You should've let me nap," he said. "You didn't need me on the pitch yesterday at all—why, I'd almost think you only insisted on my presence because of my extraordinarily good looks and talent—"
. Of course." Malfoy scrunched his nose. He also helped himself to another piece of fudge.
"So," Harry said, pouring tea into the single cup that came with the flask. Malfoy was already munching on his croissant. "Have you decided about Hogmanay yet?"
Malfoy choked and sputtered. "You're joking!"
Yours,
“Yeah.” Inhale. Exhale. “I feel like we don't talk anymore.”

Malfoy looked Harry up and down. He got up. "Are you ready to lose?"
"You don't think I'd keep my word?"

What do you think people would find in our letters hundred years from now? I’m not sure I would want anybody else to read them, but at the same time it feels like I’ve learned something new from reading Grishina’s letters. I learn something new about

Yours,
“I was about to start reading the book of letters from Vita to Virginia I got,” Harry said when he rejoined Draco at the table with steaming bowls of porridge and another mug of tea. “Have you read it?”
In the kitchen, bathed in the gentle warm light from the little lamps under the cabinets, was Harry, nursing a cup of tea and reading what looked like a letter from Draco. Draco still had all of Harry’s letters in a careful bundle in his pocket.
"Hey tosser." Harry sat next to Malfoy in the Great Hall. "Pass me the bacon."
a little. Intelligent, passionate, loving, the opposite of humble.
. Do you know how amazing that is?”
Harry
"Give me the tea."
Draco let himself into the house as quietly as he could; it was six in the morning. The light was on in the kitchen, but there was a chance that Harry had just forgot to turn it off the evening before. He left his suitcase in the entrance hall and made his way to the kitchen, bones aching and skin tight with exhaustion.
"It is what it is." Malfoy didn't look at him. "It's not because I find you such titillating company that I'm on your team, Potter. It's—" He gestured. "It is what it is."
I won’t ask you to retire. (Do you realise the power you have given me?)

I don’t care about the state of the house or the mountain of dishes. I just need assurances that we are fully stocked up on coffee,
“Tell me again.” Harry kissed him again.
"You're a shitty Keeper."
"Nope," Harry said and landed gently beside him. He secured his broomstick and then sat down, passing Malfoy a slice of tart.
"I'm cold."

“I’ll have a sip of your tea.” Draco kissed him again. “I want a nap more than I want coffee. I’ve been travelling half the night.” He slid into his chair, resting his elbows on the table.
“Yeah?”

The Husband You Evidently Forgot You Had
Today’s breakfast: eggs, toast, tea. I’ve left the sink a mess this week but I’ll do the dishes later. In a way taking these moments to write to you every morning feels like a little quiet refuge or a secret space that nobody else knows about but you. It feels safe here. I miss you. These days I’m missing you more than I’ve ever missed you before and I can’t explain it. Have I reached a breaking point? I don’t know.
I think it
Harry squashed the urge to whack the back of Malfoy's head, if only because he was a tiny little bit right. "Wasn't
if you bring me a pine cone from the woods. Do you remember being a child and having a friend in playschool whom you might give a rock as a token of affection? I’d say I do, but I don’t think I ever did, and I don’t think I ever received one. I’ll consider a pine cone an upgrade from the non-existent rocks of my childhood.
"That doesn't really solve our problem though," Harry eventually said. "We can't both play Seeker, and Berrycloth is a better Chaser than she is a Keeper, so that leaves me."
I am flattered? That you think me similar to Raaid and Grishina. I mean, I know their letters aren’t only about eloquence, but they’re both such brilliant people. Honestly, they remind me of

prying, in a way, to read somebody else’s letters, even when published. They were once private. There’s a vulnerability in that, too—the correspondents may no longer be alive to witness their private thoughts made public, but I can appreciate the confidence all the same. It feels sacred in a way. I feel vulnerable too, every time I read Grishina’s letter dated April 21st 1897: “You sleep, the eastern sun and the western moon, and your skin shifts from night to day. The world awakens with you and so do I.” It is perhaps not the most profound passage or the most poetic, rather it seems almost childish and clumsy. She writes more beautifully elsewhere. But the world awakens. Harry, I’m awake.
My hotel room
"Yes?" Harry twirled his borrowed broomstick. The lion was still singing, but he'd shut it inside the broom shed.
"Thanks," Malfoy said from the other side of the room. He'd opened all three of his presents.
I never hear from you at the end of digs, so I was surprised to receive your last letter. I know. I’ll wait for you.
However you may feel about your letter writing, trust that I know you.

P.S. I like the paper you used last time. It’s silky smooth and the ink hasn’t feathered. I’m impressed. Even your handwriting seems neater.
Dear Harry,
They were the only ones in the dormitory, everybody else having gone home for the holidays. Harry tried to look like he hadn't noticed that Malfoy had only three packages, while he was working his way through a mountain—most of which turned out to be presents from people he didn't know, as well as his friends and the Weasleys. No, wait—there was a small package from Andromeda and Teddy as well. And one from Malfoy.

"You have the flask."

"Maybe not," Harry admitted. He held out his arms so Malfoy could see the t-shirt in all its devastating glory. "Do your worst."
"The cup isn't important," Harry said. "It's—"

I’m afraid you’re going to have to be specific. I don’t remember almost dying at any point recently.
"Yes?" Harry said reluctantly.
Your loving husband,
“Mhh.”
Malfoy shrugged. "I'll come."
The digsite was completely inaccessible for anyone who didn’t know how to get to it, which was why Draco had gone to pick up Harry at the nearest Muggle train station. Harry had had to Portkey into Magdeburg (via Berlin) and then take the Muggle train to Hettstedt, from where Draco would drive them the rest of the way. Draco was waiting for him in the very small car park leaning against his Muggle car, apparently called a
"Well," Malfoy said, eyeing the pile.
"Sod off." Harry tried to focus on his breakfast instead of Malfoy's insufferable self.
We’re winding down as well—I have one “real” game left, then two for charity, and we’re booked for some public functions or whatnot, I don’t know. I just go where I’m told to go. I should be completely free in about two weeks, so I have a week free to sort out the house before you come home. (That sounds horrible. I swear I haven’t built a mountain of dishes, I just mean, the floor could do with a bit of scrubbing and I want to get our decorations down from the loft.)
“And now we walk,” Draco informed Harry.
"Sure." Harry put on the jumper Molly had knit him. It was green. "Want to go out for a spin before we head down for Christmas Dinner? I could use some fresh air."

Harry only stayed two nights before he had to go back home and resume his work. He’d be back the following week, for another two nights.
As Harry wrinkled his nose, Draco laughed.
“We should write more,” he said.
Draco
I had a cup of coffee and a warm cinnamon roll for breakfast. Euan now has the campfire going all day (it’s bloody cold) and we’ve taken to warming all kinds of baked goods by it in the morning. I’m pleased to report that cinnamon rolls warmed over a campfire are much more delicious than regular cinnamon rolls.
I am pleased to report that further analysis has revealed traces of pollen, which suggests that the humans who used this lavatory ate honey. This is exciting if only to definitely prove that this
“Do you want breakfast?”
Your long-suffering husband,
It wasn’t as if he’d miss Harry arriving; this particular train station only had a train stop once every hour, if that. Nevertheless, Draco waited, eyes fixed, cigarette in mouth. It was a relatively new habit. Six years of marriage and he’d only picked up smoking five years in—these days, whenever he was away on a dig or Harry was away with his team or they were both away, smoking felt like a distraction and a comfort.

“I barely see you and then I hear on the wireless how you do reckless things that could get you killed, and I'm just so…tired.” Draco finished his cigarette. “I know you don’t want to retire yet, so the only thing I can think of to get more of you is this: letters.”
