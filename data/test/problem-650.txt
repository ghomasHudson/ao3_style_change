Harry chanced a step toward him and Draco scooped up his bag and fled from the room before the other boy could open his mouth.
“Stalking me again?” Potter sounded weary, his voice was rough from disuse and Draco was sure that if he looked over towards him there would be heavy bags below his green eyes.
Draco couldn’t do this. He could not do this. This room, Harry Potter’s stupid pitiful face. His throat was closing up and if his stomach could sink any lower it would be on the floor.
They were at a standstill. Neither fully trusted the other and Draco after seeing that trusting Harry only got him petrified wasn’t willing to extend an olive branch. Water dripped from one of the pipes above and landed in a puddle at Granger’s feet.
Draco tapped his chin, “Oh, I think you can do better than that.” He belayed nothing of what was flying through his head.
Though the room was empty it didn’t stop Draco’s heart from beating twice as fast inside his chest. This room was genesis of his downfall. The murder of Albus Dumbledore, the mistake that cost Crabbe his life. The things he did for The Dark Lord--for his family. He could have sworn he felt the faded brand on his left arm burn.
Draco prayed to Merlin that Harry was not among his friends. “I’m not hiding,” he snapped. “What do you think one does in the toilet.” He flushed the empty bowl.
Granger opened her mouth to spit out a retort, then stopped. She let out a mirthless laugh, “I don’t know why he likes you.”
He was right. Inside the room was nothing. No clutter of random objects, no vanishing cabinet, no fiendfyre, no Crabbe.
Why would he be upset, it couldn’t possibly be because Harry was sticking his stupid nose where it doesn’t belong. His stupid savior complex, surely not.
Draco mimed zipping his mouth closed. Harry huffed and reached for his pumpkin juice. “So what do you think?”
Draco lowered his shoulder bag to the floor and focused on Harry, the sooner they left the accursed room the better.
If he and Granger had both brewed the potion and both got the same results. If Harry Potter was truly immortal then….
Potter leaned forward to place his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hand, presenting Draco with the curve of his back. “Wow. That’s...unexpected. You’re welcome, I suppose.”
At this Harry opened his eyes. He looked at Draco blankly. And Draco had to suppress and shiver from running through him.
He should have stuck to his original plan, he’d thanked Harry Potter and that should have been the end of it.
To retaliate was akin to sanctifying his side in the war. So all he could do was raise his eyebrows, summon the most unbothered look he could manage unto his face and walk away.
Weasley pushed off the counter, “Stop jerking us around, Malfoy. He needs help. He’s up all night or in the library all day. He won’t eat or talk to us.”
Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter. That work of fiction belongs to Joanne and I think she's doing a wonderful job of killing her own fandom.
“Stifling?” Draco ventured. He cast a look at the student’s whispering and sneaking glances in his and Harry’s direction.
Draco narrowed his eyes at the back of Potter’s messy black head, had he known Draco was following him the entire time?
“You’ll see. I’m an idiot--it’s literally the most simple solution.” Potter led him up to the seventh floor.
“Watch where you’re going, Death Eater!” Finnigan wiped his arm where it had made contact with Draco.
Still standing parallel to the green-eyed boy Draco said, “I believe you owe me an apology.” He said Harry was going to listen to him and by Morgana he was going to.
Draco held his breath. Anything having to do with the war tended to send Harry into a spiral. He was doing so well, Draco hated to see it destroyed
“Please, Draco,” he said suddenly, his voice dropping low. “I can’t stay here and I can’t be alone for two weeks either. I-” he cut himself off, staring down into his cup.
He couldn’t say why but he followed her. Draco schooled his face into a statue of apathy and raised his eyebrows at the girl.
“Last time I tried you and your troll of boyfriend attacked me,” he drooled, picking invisible lint off his sleeve.
“Uh, I don’t know? Maybe the look on your face, or your body language. Maybe the fact that you stormed away from me after Potions?” Harry grabbed Draco’s arm, forcing him to stop on the landing and as the staircase before it started to shift.
He should leave, Draco knew. He and Potter weren’t friends and the boy was clearly going through something that Draco was sure he wanted no business in.
“I can’t do it myself. Not.. not...”  the dark skinned boy got this far off look in his eyes and Draco had the sinking feeling he was going to say ‘not again’.
He took a step cautiously towards Draco, as if any sudden movements might cause him to flee or attack. “...Draco?”
Draco couldn’t imagine what his face looked like in that moment because Potter’s face was the picture of concern.
The next time Draco saw Potter, the boy was squished next to Granger on an overstuffed chair near the fireplace. It was almost time for lunch and Draco was putting his studying materials away with Blaise complaining about Slughorn inviting him to another Slug Club meeting when Wesley entered through the mirror that served as a door to their joint common room.
One of the Patil twins whispered in Harry’s ear and Draco saw those green eyes widen, then narrow behind glasses. And he knew Harry was about to do something stupidly heroic and completely unnecessary.
Harry turned to Draco, his tear streaked face glistening in the moonlight. “He’s taken something from me again-Voldemort. Once again he’s taken my family from me.”
“What’s going on?” he was looking directly at Draco now, pushing his way through the crowd that had inexplicably formed. Probably poised for Draco to attack, like he would have done, once upon a time.
She looked at him with piercing brown eyes and Draco did all he could not to shrink at the force of them.
Granger followed the motion with her eyes, as if she’d seen Harry do it before. “Do you believe it?”
Draco whirled on Harry, “But I do! He wasn’t wrong, Harry. We all know which side I was on during the war.” He winced, wishing he could take back his word choice, this is the second time the war was mentioned in Harry’s presence, Draco didn’t know how many more mentions it would take him to snap.
Harry’s lips drifted upward, “What would you have me do? Throw myself at your feet and beg forgiveness?”
Harry started up the steps, motioning Draco to follow. Draco sighed, thinking Harry was far too honest with him. And much to adept at reading him.
The look in Harry’s eyes finally soften and Draco released a breath he didn’t realize he was holding.
Harry shook his head. “I haven’t tested the theory. I just...have a feeling.” He placed a hand on chest and pressed. “Something’s off.”
It was freezing out tonight. Halloween was right around the corner and Hogwarts was bespeckled in pumpkins, bats, and other little creatures that go bump in the night.
Potter was the savior of the wizarding world. Liable to be the most powerful wizard in centuries once he graduated from Hogwarts. He be offered everything from jobs to a seat on Wizengamot. He was already the youngest holder of an Order of Merlin, First Class.
At this Granger straightened, pushing herself off the desk. “And you are lucky petrifying you was all we did,” she snapped. “Casting an unforgivable on him was not helping.”
“You’re groupies are worried. They cornered me the restroom asking about you.” Harry still hadn’t turned to face him.
Draco’s holidays were filled with preening and making himself presentable to properly boast about the Malfoy name to other sacred 27, barring the Weasley’s of course.. And of course a private gathering with just his mother, his father, and himself. Those he missed the most.
Or at least that’s what he planned to do. Harry had chosen that precise moment to walk out into the corridor.
But no, that scarhead had to share his secrets. Make Draco worried and curious all at once. And why couldn’t he ask someone else. Did Potter think that because he almost killed Dumbledore, he’d kill him.
,” Harry said, leaning back on the bench. Draco wished he’d lose his balance and topple over. “It’ll be...fun? We’ll have lots to do. It’s a bit of a fixer.”
Halloween was uneventful. It was probably the most peaceful one Hogwarts had had in years. And even now, almost time for Christmas break, everything was quiet.
“Or bad publicity for you.” Draco said, leaving out that fact that Harry really shouldn’t be associated outside of Hogwarts with riffraff like him. Because, honestly, if Draco had to hear another lecture about  ‘elitism’ and Granger’s thoughts on ‘segregation’ he was going to spell himself deaf.
“You like me looking, don’t you, baby.” Harry cooed. “You like how I can’t help but stare at your gorgeous body. You’re a slut for my attention, aren’t you, Draco?”
Under normal circumstances, Draco would have bristled at the remark, but instead he tried to thrust up, a little jolt of his hips the only movement he was capable of making. “
“Shut up and get to work, Potter.” Draco replied, gesturing to the soap Harry still held in his other hand.
Giving the dark haired man an arch look, Draco began to walk towards the exit, sensing Harry following at his heels.
When Draco finally rose from a late afternoon nap, the sun hanging low on the horizon, he seemed galvanized, determined.
Keening high and desperate, Draco arched up into Potter’s mouth, pressing his tits into the man’s face as he came, his cock twitching and slapping wetly against his stomach, come splattering up towards his chest, catching Potter under the chin.
He was tempted to ignore it, but just as his urge to run was making his muscles flex in anticipation, so too was the promise that came with those texts making his cock harden in anticipation of
“Oh yes, yes, the side effects - shut it, Neville.” Draco groused, and Harry glowered more. “Regardless, introductions are in order, I’m afraid.”
Harry tutted, and took hold of Draco’s still-hard cock, next, beginning to jerk it in time with his thumbs movements over Draco’s clit, and his mate began to sob, chest heaving.
The woman was still dressed in her Healer robes, but she hiked them up and ran towards them along the sand, clattering up the stairs and onto the deck, staring at them with wild eyes.
Neville grinned, handing over a large jar, the opaque glass a dark, murky green. “Glad to be of assistance. Though I can’t say I’m 100% on-board with you using gillyweed this young...”
Harry was helpless to do anything but kiss his mate, helpless to stop himself from curling around Draco on the couch, pulling him into his lap, kissing him and kissing him, until the sea called Harry back to her as the sun got closer to setting.
And, physiologically speaking, he had other adaptations that left him feeling uniquely unsatisfied when fucking the average male partner, as was his preference. His arse was practically designed to wring an orgasm out of his partners, leaving them frequently unable to last longer than a few minutes when fucking him.
flavour that lit Potter up, the wet heat of his tongue, and the flash of metallic blood as their lips caught on each others teeth.
Draco’s eyes narrowed at the jibe, but was quick to counter, “And I’m not the slightest bit surprised that an esteemed law enforcement officer such as yourself would get off on beating people.”
“I am trying very hard to be understanding, Harry.” Draco began, voice somewhat tight. Harry gave into the urge to cup his mate’s face, turning those icy eyes to look into his. Draco managed a weak smile at him, and Harry’s worry flared. “I know it’s not your fault, Harry, but you can’t just - keep me here, and not let me go home!”
And Beckett knew he had a thing for blonds, ever since he had drunkenly described his burning need to fuck Malfoy, and how he thought he’d wanted the posh git even back when he was 16.
It was much more full than it had been - full of his mate’s things. A new armoire and dresser for his clothes, a fully stocked potions station, new bookshelves lining his walls, different blankets on their bed. His bathroom was now cluttered with things; potions and creams and oils and rubs.
Draco had tried to talk to Harry, to see if they could work through it, together. To see if the other man would be willing to pursue a relationship with Draco, regardless of the vitriol that would continue raining down on their heads from the public.
“You told me it would be temporary!” Draco exclaimed, frowning first at the man and then down at the jar.
With a great, heaving breath, oxygen finally flooded his lungs, and Draco let himself float for a moment, just breathing, his gills fluttering softly.
Hermione arrived in all due haste, and Harry smiled at her, pulling her into a quick hug and muttering “the curse is broken,” into the cloud of her hair. She beamed at him, and watched as Harry took hold of Draco’s left hand in his, showing off their rings. “He said ‘yes.’”
“H-Harry, fuck. Ngh, too much.” Draco whined, shoving at his head, his other hand coming down to bury into Harry’s hair, trying to pull him back. “Merlin, you’re greedy.”
.” He hissed, and Harry laughed again, the chuckle bursting out of him even as his own panic began to flare.
Draco felt himself twitch in his bindings, eyes wide as he stared down at that messy mop of black hair, before Potter cupped both of his pecks in his big hands, squeezing them tightly as his mouth descended, sucking his left nipple into that hot, wet mouth.
“You remember everything I told you about how to harvest it?” Neville asked, his do-gooder Gryffindor nature prompting him to need to warn Draco over and over again. “Mermaid’s Thistle has to be picked under the light of a full moon -”
“But don’t think I won’t take up your promise to let me bring my things here. Your house is going to need to be seriously updated to meet my needs.” His mate demanded.
“I need to call Hermione.” Draco said with a sigh, running a hand through his hair. He grimaced, and began undoing his messy braid, apparently displeased with how it had gotten so mussed and tangled during the night. “I wonder how soon she would be able to get here. She
He set out a tray laden with Draco’s favourite teacup (which was a gift from Luna, and was decorated with purple pygmy puffs floating around on a lime green background), and a teapot with the leaves steeping inside of it, and a little plate of digestive cookies (one of Draco’s favourite after dinner treats, sent special from England from Greg, who knew Draco’s sweet tooth best).
“The curse -” Harry said, voice filled with awe. “I-it’s broken! I-I remember everything, I remember
“She overheard the call to bring her mum in, and demanded to come along to see Draco. She’s half in love with the git, I swear.”
, he’d been forced to meet with Junior Prosecutor Malfoy on their efforts to proceed with a case against a criminal who Harry had caught in connection with a larger smuggling ring.
“I - I’m not -” Draco gasped, shaking his head and pressing his face down into the seagrass below them. “I’m t-trying -”
Draco hummed, moving towards the door. “A problem for another day then. Thank you ever so for all of your assistance on this matter. I trust we can be assured of your discretion?”
“Which leads me to the other important aspect to discuss; what are your preferences? Have you ever tried anything kinky? Does anything spark your interest in particular?”
“Well,” Malfoy drawled, moving to uncross his legs, and then re-cross to the opposite side, giving Harry a glance at the hard outline of his cock and a flash of red from his heels. “I have a very high libido, and a great deal of... shall we say, stamina? I’m not satisfied coming just once. And most men find themselves unable to last once they’ve gotten their prick in my arse.”
well he had grown into those pointy features, how he had maintained a willowy, graceful figure, and how he’d grown his gorgeous platinum blond hair to the perfect length to grab in an effective handful or to fall into his eyes when it got disheveled - all of that wasn’t enough.
“That’s a good boy.” Harry praised, dragging his rough tongue around Draco’s reddened nipple. “Now I need you to hold yourself open for me, baby, so I can have a look at your sweet little holes.”
“Good morning, beautiful.” Harry murmured, resuming his trail of kisses as he stared up at Draco, utterly enchanted. “How are you feeling?”
But he was helpless, tied wide open as Potter brought those big hands up to cup his cheeks, spreading them open, exposing his hole to that sharp green gaze.
With a grin, Draco shimmied his tight pair of swim shorts down and off his legs, leaving him clad in only his wand holster, the extra jar trailing from his ankle, and moonlight as he hung, suspended in water, pale body almost seeming to glow in the serene darkness.
your slutty little arsehole loves being stretched nice and wide, and I want to see you push another one of my eggs out, baby. It looked so fucking
He slipped his clasper in as well, Draco’s hole so fucked out that the two cocks fit inside with barely any effort, and Harry worked on filling his mate with that potent mix of slick and jelly, pumping Draco completely full again.
“M’fine.” Draco muttered, feeling weirdly content, even if he did feel completely wrung out. He paused, taking stock of his body. “Are you... are you still... inside me?”
His torso was fully pinned, back against a wide chest behind him. Another arm was wrapped securely around his waist, a big hand cupping proprietarily over the sharp jut of Draco’s hip bone, the forearm brushing over his still-hard cock.
“Right, sorry.” Ron said with a laugh. He slapped Harry’s shoulder, his other hand rubbing behind his own neck. “We’re only having each other on, mate. Bit of an old inside joke, I guess.”
“I’m glad, baby.” Harry cooed, wrapping his mate up into his arms, settling down beside him on their nest. “I knew you’d like it.”
.” Harry crooned, kissing his way down from Draco’s chest to his belly, lavishing it with sweet, worshipful presses of his lips. “Always so eager to please me, always so eager to show yourself off. Such a fucking
“Ah - no.” Harry admitted, offering Draco a sympathetic smile. “But that doesn’t matter at all, because you’re
“Come on, baby.” He cooed, taking Draco’s hand and leading him into the water. “Let me take care of you. Gunna make you feel so good.”
marry my son. He deserves at least that much, if he is going to give you a child. I don’t care if you prefer to avoid a massive ceremony, though I’m sure that is what he would prefer, but at least have a bonding ceremony done -”
Draco’s little whimper at his words morphed into a loud, desperate moan as Harry sucked his sweet little cock into his sharp, teeth filled mouth. Harry kept a tight grip on his mate’s hips, but Draco knew well enough by now to lay very, very still while Harry sucked him off.
He felt a gush of liquid squeeze out around Potter’s thick fingers as they hammered away at his hole, and he lit up with embarrassment.
” Draco pleaded, looking back at Harry over his shoulder, his eyes wide with desperation, pupils dilated with pleasure. “H-help me get it out, I can’t - it’s - it’s too
“Oh baby, you can do better than that.” Harry murmured, and brought one of his thumbs up to rub over the aching nub of his clit. Draco jerked, gasping, looking at Harry with wide, desperate eyes, but Harry kept working him, his own eyes challenging. “Maybe if we get your greedy little cunt to come, you’ll be able to squeeze it out, hm?”
Harry blinked up at her as she rose to tower over him, all regally controlled fury. Draco looked at him pleadingly, but Harry nodded, and stood as well, heading to the door.
, Potter.” He griped, wiggling further into the warmth of his body, finding the ache in his arse surprisingly pleasant. He clenched again, and felt a gush of warmth fill him. “Now hush, and keep petting me.”
, the head of that thick cock pressing past a resistance inside of him that made Draco shriek with pleasure.
Harry had to admit that he had been more motivated than usual. Typically, he just put on a vest and some of his comfier jeans or even joggers, as they allowed the most mobility for him to work, but he had felt inspired to go a bit beyond his normal effort by the promise of what Beckett had alluded to in his texts.
Potter’s hands were harsh and quick as they stripped the rope from him, a pleased growl rumbling out of him at the marks they had left on Draco’s pale skin.
Harry was beaming with pleasure himself, and hardly managed to eat anything, as he couldn’t stop staring at the beautiful man sitting across from him.
“Does it turn you on, Malfoy? How filthy I am?” Potter demanded, low and eager. “Does the idea of a filthy, ill-bred mutt like me fucking such a posh, perfect, pureblood like you get you hot?”
“You already taste so fucking good.” Potter growled into his mouth, before licking back in, all tongue and teeth and dominance. “I can’t wait to taste the rest of you.”
Harry brought up a hand to trail over the man’s fine features, thumb brushing over the high cheekbones, down to the sharp chin. He pushed back a lock of fine hair, which had escaped the man’s long braid sometime in the night.
Potter had then turned back to Hogwarts, apparently looking to try out the quiet life, hidden within the castle’s familiar walls, finally away from the public eye. And sure, he had the skillset to be an excellent teacher, but he had never had to deal with
“Yes, ‘all that,’ Malfoy. It’s pretty damn important. As a dom, I have a responsibility to anyone who subs for me, and I can only offer that if we’ve firmly hashed out the details, and come to an agreement. Especially if I’m going to do what I’m planning to do to you.”
If his dates weren’t an immediate failure due to how disgustingly hero-worshipping the person was, things inevitably didn’t work out because of Harry’s cock being too big.
I’m happy here, by the sea. I don’t want to live in a big city, surrounded by people, having to be constantly on-guard. I don’t need to remember anything to know that I’m happier now, here, with my territory and my quiet life. And now that I have you, I have everything I need. I
.” The man gasped, his cock bursting out another trail of precum over Harry’s tongue as he sucked the whole length of Draco’s prick into his mouth. “Oh
“I-” Malfoy seemed to falter, eyes taking in the raw hunger on Harry’s face. “I might’ve done more, when I was younger, but-”
to be able to protect you. I need you here, with me, so that I can provide for you, give you everything you need, and keep you
Harry.” Draco hissed, moaning and arching up into Harry’s face as the larger man leaned down to suck at his left nipple, his mouth hungry and teeth sharp. “Oh,
out his given name, the effect of that drawl pronouncing it feeling so much more illicit than when Malfoy called him ‘Potter.’ It made his blood burn under his skin; made his teeth itch.
“I wish to speak to Mr. Potter, alone.” Narcissa said sharply, cutting off her son’s protests. “If you’ll join me outside?”
“I should check you over first; make sure you’re okay.” She said, pointing her wand at him again. “Can you tell me what happened?”
Malfoy fairly flinched at the words, going thoroughly red, face turned fully away from Harry. “Don’t be ridiculous, Potter. I’m not a woman.”
, how lucky am I that you can come just from your tits? That’s the hottest thing I’ve ever seen, baby.”
As he watched, a new text notification appeared, and then another; a rapid succession of blinking lights flashing across the small display screen.
“How amazing!” She exclaimed, shuffling closer, eyes narrowed as though to inspect something tiny. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Harry pulled away slightly, a moue of sadness on his lips as he pulled back from where he had started to kiss the tip of his mate’s hard cock, lapping at the precum there.
Still frowning and lost in his thoughts, he finally looked back up towards the front of the club where Beckett was just returning.
“Now, I desperately need a shower before she arrives. My hair is a disaster, and the salt is drying out my poor skin.” Draco said with a pout, and tried to lever himself up out of the bed.
“Oh please, feel free to keep discussing here.” Beckett suddenly interrupted, and Harry’s eyes shot to him from where they had been boring into Malfoy’s. “It was just getting to the good part!”
“Amnesia is the first one. He doesn’t remember anything about his past. He knew his name was Harry, when we finally found him, but not his last name. He was basically a vagabond, wandering around the Étang de Thau region, through various towns, doing odd jobs for cash. Mostly manual labour. It took
with all four of his fingers, wedging his hole open, tongue and teeth and lips sucking at him as he was opened wide.
It had been a challenge for Harry to deal with this aspect of himself. He had seriously come to resent the idea of intimacy overall by the time he had met Beckett. First, there was his breakup with Ginny, which had unfortunately come about the very same night they had tried to have sex for the first time.
“Let me help you, baby.” Harry said, rushing to assist his mate. “We’ll shower together; you just let me take care of you.”
All of them, man or woman, invariably, even with advance warning, looked at him like he was a freak after they saw him fully erect-- even the ones who said they
“Of course.” The Healer agreed, squinting right back at him in challenge. “Though we all know that no potions are completely effective 100% of the time.”
Draco opened his mouth to reply, torn between begging and cursing the other man, but a broken moan ripped out of him instead, and he hung his head, submersed in the gorgeous feeling of fire licking over his backside and upper thighs as Potter kept spanking him.
Groaning at the second full name treatment, Harry visibly shrunk in on himself as he heard Molly Weasley’s voice, and glowered when Ron burst into laughter behind him, Ginny joining in with her own distinctive cackle of delight.
Desperation kept driving him back out to seek partners though, despite how much he loved his toys. They could never fully satisfy his needs, and his libido had been repressed somewhat by his supressants, but he was still nearly
Struggling and shoving at the other man’s stupid, muscley arms and chest, Draco found himself pinned, staring up into bright, happy green eyes and a sharp, crooked smile.
Rolling his eyes, Harry watched Beckett walk towards the entrance to the club, losing sight of him as he rounded a corner.
And fuck it all, he wanted any kind of attention that Potter would be willing to give him, because the blasted man was
“I’ll take that as a compliment then, shall I?” Harry asked, and grinned knowingly as Beckett looked him over, gaze heavy as it traced over the tight, white henley that contrasted so nicely with his dark skin tone, and clung to the thick muscles of his shoulders, chest, and back. That, coupled with a pair of well-worn dragon-hide trousers that cupped the sizeable bulge at his crotch, and melded against the muscles of his thighs served as a simple yet effective outfit for when he wanted to impress and draw in potential subs.
‘He was basically homeless, though he spent all of his nights in the sea as a mermaid. We helped him get access to his vaults to buy a house. And we got him access to a Muggle bank card, so he can support himself better.
Took me a while to work through this stupid fucking chapter for some reason. I decided to add some more sex scene to hit the egglaying and lactation kinks, but as usual, I ended up going overboard. Enjoy!
The older man had taken Harry under his wing, acting as a mentor as he had shown Harry the ropes of what it meant to be a Dom; the rules, the techniques, and the inherent privilege in being allowed to take care of a sub. He had also been integral in helping Harry figure out how to deal with his libido, and the challenge of having a cock so massive that he couldn’t actually fuck most of his partners.
Nodding, Harry decided it was best to wrap it up before they were both so overwrought that they came before they could even get started.
Draco let out a wrecked sound, but felt himself nodding. A tear spilled over, and his vision went blurry.
Draco gasped, eyes snapping open to stare at Harry, his mouth opened partially in disbelief. “P-Potter, that - that’s so fucking
It took him hours to collect the three dozen that he wanted for his R&D and later production, leaving a sizeable amount left on the ocean floor, not wanting to seriously deplete the location in case anyone else needed to collect some for themselves.
I will admit to wanting the eggs to be a thing kink-wise, but not being as hype about the how/logistics/explanation. I tried my best, but please continue to suspend your disbelief in this area. Just enjoy the laying and the fullness. No thoughts, only porn.
It was dim, but Draco looked luminous laying there in the hospital bed, his hair a mess, his cheeks wet with tears, a tremulous smile splitting his face.
“If you’re so desperate for it, Potter, I suppose I’ll allow you.” Malfoy demurred, still looking flush and innocently chagrined at the thought of it.
Shivering slightly, Draco made quick work of plaiting his long blonde hair, making sure that the strands were all tucked away so they wouldn’t obscure his vision in the water. Next, he strapped on a leather wand holster to his thigh, synching it tight to his skin and sliding his hawthorne wand into place. He felt comforted by his old wand, the familiar magic of it sparking against his skin, coupled with just the slightest hint of
“Sounds too good to be true, if I’m honest.” Harry quipped, giving Beckett a disbelieving stare. “I’m never
That one wasn’t ready to come out yet, and Harry acted quickly, angling his hips and cupping his bigger cock, notching it against Draco’s loosened hole.
Still being careful of his nails, Draco began to circle his index finger around his swollen clit, the pad of it just barely touching it directly, just teasing around it in a constant, inexorable movement. His other hand he brought down lower, and teased the tips of two fingers very carefully into his hole, letting him clench down on the very tips of them, unable to work them deeper inside due to the webbing on his hand.
“Will you still let me eat you out, sweetheart?” Potter questioned, staring up at Draco, nostrils flaring, mouth open with want. “Let me get you wet and open for me?”
“Can’t help it.” Harry croaked out, pulling back and smiling up at his mate. “You taste too good. Wanna taste more of you -”
He came again, cock throbbing as he squeezed out another burst of come against Potter’s constantly moving tongue, moaning and crying out as the man kept lapping away at him through his orgasm, licking and sucking the come harshly from his slit.
Though he’d been nearly consumed by his studies during every waking moment, dedicating himself to two entirely separate educations simultaneously, his passion and determination had driven him. There was something for him to unlock, here, where magic met science.
“Hey, sweetheart, hey.” He cooed, shifting his hold again to cradle Draco’s face. “You have nothing to be embarrassed about, baby. You know how much I love looking at you. How hot it makes me to look at you. I can’t wait to see you squeeze my eggs out of your tight little pussy.”
As a male Veela, he was still in possession of a prostate, which was easy enough to stimulate, but there was another spot,
Harry was still kneeling, nerves building in his belly, his hands shaking so badly that he could barely pour out a cup of the tea for Draco.
He had watched, barely daring to hope, as Harry Potter had stepped forward to speak for himself and his mother, saving them from the brunt of judgement that should have been cast down on them. Draco had felt weak with relief, and had wanted to fall to his knees before the Saviour, despite their fraught past.
“Hullo Harry.” Luna greeted, pushing past her girlfriend and going up on her tippy toes to give Harry a hug and a peck on the cheek. “Such wonderful news! All the cloudiness in your aura is finally gone as well! Your time away must have been good for your soul.”
Harry leaned forward, releasing Draco’s legs but muscling his own tail between them, grabbing at his mate’s wrist to pull away his hands, kissing all over his pinked cheeks.
Harry’s mate did need to be checked over though, just in case. He couldn’t handle the thought that anything could be wrong with Draco, or with his clutch.
“Oh sweetheart, look at you.” Harry crooned, pulling Draco’s arsecheeks wide so he could watch that fucked out hole struggle. “Such a pretty sight. I need you to push for me now, baby. Wanna see you work it out of your cute little hole.”
He knew this man, apparently, as he had apparently known Hermione and Ron. They had tried to explain much of Harry’s past, but he’d never particularly cared to hear about it. Now, he wondered how he knew this beautiful man. If he had grown up with him. If Harry had ever kissed him before. If they had been in love.
“It will be.” Draco said, confidence and passion coursing through him as he considered how close he was to his goal. “If it ends up working, Neville - Merlin, it will be a
“Excellent, thank you again.” Draco interrupted, and then curled a finger at Harry, making his way out of the room. “Come along now, Potter.”
“Well.” Hermione said, looking a mix of embarrassed and fascinated. “Mermaids do reproduce with the males laying their egg clutch into a female partner and fertilizing them internally.”
“Hullo Pansy, Luna, Gin.”  Harry said, nodding at them and bracing himself as Narcissa stepped to the side, electing to take a seat next to Ron and introduce herself to Rosie.
As Malfoy and Beckett finally turned to continue back towards him, Harry could just make out the soft pink of his nipples through his shirt, and the tantalizing dark flash of the Dark Mark on his forearm.
Harry reached down to squeeze his dick, already most of the way hard with just the promise of maybe, just
They had prepared a full Tea. Draco had started some baking projects, hoping to make a Victoria Sponge, as was his mother’s favourite, but had had to give up part way through, his stomach getting too much in the way.
Draco gasped as the thick head popped past the ring of resistance, eyes immediately rolling back into his head as he gushed around the intrusion, his body trying it’s best to slick the way.
Draco’s breathing stuttered to a halt for a moment as the stretch at his rim increased as the clasper dragged the egg out, the combined thickness of the egg itself and the clasper alongside of it
Malfoy’s mouth was open into a soft ‘o’ of disbelief, his eyes wide and blown out, the grey in them almost gone.
“Oh my -” Hermione gasped, clearly not having expected so many people to be outside. She looked at Harry, concern clear on her face, but he aimed a still-watery smile at her, and gestured for her to share her news.
“Why don’t you just supervise, then?” Ron griped, popping open the chest and beginning to levitate the first item out, unshrinking it. “Where do you want this... desk?”
“Oh you know me.” Beckett shrugged. “I’m too old for demanding little princesses like that; I need someone more my pace, and this one is too young and fiery for my tastes; too much work to train, and I doubt he’d like my style even then. I picked him up at The Yard Bar last weekend, on account of him being all over me and just about gagging for it, but the minute I got ‘im in the sack, I knew he was more up your alley.”
Harry Potter had been cursed, and Draco was willing to do whatever it took for even the slightest chance that he might be able to help, and get a second chance with the man.
He clenched, overworked rim squeezing tight around the growing pressure, and moaned in pleasure. Harry’s hands, tight on Draco’s hips, flexed and tightened, his nails digging sharp and prickling at his skin.
“I suggest you check with Gringotts to see if they can locate the Potter Family rings. They are often imbued with powerful enchantments, and it would be... suitable for you to carry the Potter legacy onward.”
“Yes, yes.” Draco said with a sigh, waving away Neville’s familiar warnings with a flippant hand. “But you said that it will take almost a whole year for your own stock to mature, and most other Ingredients Sellers gave me a similar timeline. I’m hardly willing to push my entire R&D project back
Those silver eyes widened, and Malfoy looked almost shocked and uneasy. “Really, Potter, how uncouth-”
sensitive now. Even the feeling of his smooth palms trailing over them as he played with his own tits was enough to make him shiver and arch. He pinched at them lightly, and felt his cock twitch.
had left Draco a shell of himself already. The last two years of his life had felt like a living nightmare, and all he wanted was for it all to stop.
Draco’s moans turned back into whimpers as Harry pulled away again, applying his tongue instead to his swollen clit. Harry had spent most of the afternoon with his lips wrapped around the red nub, sucking and licking Draco through orgasm after orgasm until he’d begged Harry to stop.
At this Draco paused a bit longer, clearly going through a mental catalogue. “There were many things I came across in my research that were... not immediately appealing, but I think the more common limits like blood, scat, urination, and the like, I would not be even slightly interested in.”
Harry popped his cock out, using his thumbs to part Draco’s lips again to look at the gaping, plugged up hole, smiling down at the gorgeous sight.
“Shh, shhh.” Harry hushed, cooing to him. “I need you to calm down for just a second, baby. I need you to check in with me. What’s your colour, Draco?”
Compared to the smaller, more fish-like breed of freshwater Mermaids, such as the ones that lived in the Black Lake on Hogwarts grounds, the saltwater variants tended to be larger, more viciously territorial, more human-shaped, and more prone to actively killing humans when presented the chance.
Harry hummed in agreement, loving the sensation himself as he fucked his clasper in and out of Draco’s stuffed-full cunt, filling it further still with more of his special slick.
Suddenly, the needless luxury of Harry’s bathroom finally served a purpose, and Harry beamed with pride as Draco let out a pleased noise at the sight of the massive walk-in glass shower. There was a huge soaker tub as well, sitting under a window that overlooked the sea, and Draco seemed to eye it hungrily, before instead heading toward the shower.
“Oh Draco.” Harry cooed, kissing him sweetly again. “You don’t even know how good I’m going to make this for you. Will you let me make your tits feel good, baby?”
They had begun to go into town a bit more as well recently, Draco always wearing a concealment and notice-me-not charm around his swollen belly.
To his own surprise, Draco had fallen easily back in with Pansy, Blaise, Millie, Theo, and Greg, but in the six years he’d been gone away, his old friends from Slytherin had all somehow collectively entered the Lion’s Den.
Harry shot his own look at Ron, who was biting at his lip, going slightly red as his shoulders shook with the effort of keeping his noises and comments to himself.
“Draco!” Hermione already had her wand out, and Harry fought back a snarl as she pointed it at his mate. “I arrived as quickly as I could, but the portkey offices - oh.”
Draco’s eyes fluttered open, his gaze hazy, like he’d been drugged. He smiled up at Harry, his expression punchdrunk.
, last night.” Draco drawled, his silvery eyes cutting across to look at Harry as he spoke, his tone both teasing and dry. “He was in some sort of a mating frenzy. He’s filled me full of eggs. Eggs, Granger.”
“Merlin, I can’t wait to taste your sweet little cock.” Harry breathed. “I’m sorry I didn’t suck you, last night. Though I think you might’ve liked it if I tried - you seemed to really enjoy my teeth.”
Hermione and Ron have brought Rosie with them, and the little girl is entranced by Draco, who she thinks is a princess. Rosie has apparently always been obsessed with pregnant people, enthralled by the concept that there was a baby inside of their bellies.
Ron was there in the waiting room with Rosie, who was awake again in his arms. Harry brightened immediately, rushing forward to pull his friend into a hug, squeezing the squealing girl between them, making her laugh.
So, I thought I had already reached the heights of perversion with the first few sex scenes, but I honestly almost feel like this last one was the most over the top, despite only being simulated eggs.
“That is what you’re after, isn’t it?” Harry continued, pressing his advantage. “Why you decided to come out tonight? You’re looking for a bit of rough, aren’t you, Malfoy? To be taken in hand. You’re always so perfectly buttoned up, so used to having power at your fingertips. So used to having it all done your way. You want someone to take over for a while. Someone to give you
The man’s green eyes were still much the same, shrewd and suspicious as they raked over Draco’s form. The man had a cigarette in one hand, and Draco felt himself suck in a sharp breath even as Potter took a long drag, eyes still fixed on him as Draco stepped towards the group’s table.
The other man looked lost for words for long moments, one of his delicate hands coming up to rub at his eye, either to whisk away the remaining sleepiness, or in disbelief; Harry couldn’t tell.
Malfoy was wearing a pair of skintight leather leggings that glinted in the low light of the club, the sheen of them making Harry suspect that they were dragon-hide as well, though in a much, much more tight fit than his own.
Harry offered him a hungry grin, pleased and eager. “And your toys. What’s the biggest you’ve ever taken? What size is your favourite?”
Honestly, saltwater Mermaids were incredibly rare outside of the truly deep parts of most major oceans, and were even more rare now inside of the Mediterranean Sea, having been mostly driven out during the Great Thallassian War of 1788.
friends, for Merlin’s sake. You used to have a life there too. Don’t you want to go back to them? To try to get back the life you had? Don’t you want to try to build a new life, together with me?”
“Hello Granger.” Draco started, talking to the magical bird, who would carry his message to the woman. “I happened to run into a mutual friend of ours on my trip to harvest some Mermaid's Thistle in the South of France. I am in need of your medical assistance as soon as possible, as there have been some... complications that have arisen. I would appreciate it if you could attend me at our friend’s new house as soon as possible.
“Oh, shush, we both know that if you’re in charge of apparating Draco, you’ll end up taking him to a Muggle Car Show.”
He raised his head and looked deep into Harry’s eyes, absorbing the emerald green-ness as much as he possibly could, focusing on that rather than the image of a man who looked exactly like him on the cover of the Daily Prophet, growling like a beast of some kind. How had he never noticed the darker green flecks in the middle? Or the contrast between the colour and the whites of his eyes and colour of his skin and the way that it blended to make the most wonderful palette. Draco watched in wonder as his pupils dilated, leaving only a slim ring of bright green.
The man bit his lip and furrowed his brows, a sign that he was thinking hard. It took a few moments before he answered. “I’ll think about it.” he said, quiet as a mouse, before turning to Dumbledore and speaking in a harsh voice. “You need to make sure that the parents are comfortable with it, though.”
“Who are you and what have you done with Draco Malfoy?” The other boy rolled his eyes and gestured for the pair to turn their attentions to the teachers filing into the room. McGonagall started the meeting and Harry felt immediately better with her in charge, although her tone was grave.
“Guarding something… Like that thing Hagrid got out of Gringotts. Whatever that was is obviously more important than just some trinket for Dumbledore’s office!”
“Open it, open it!” he squealed, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet, the way he did when he was really happy.
“‘Ello, Harry, Ron, Hermione. ‘Ow are yeh? Oh, and Draco too.” Hagrid suddenly seemed anxious to get out of his house. “I ‘ave to go feed the Skrewts, come along.” The man led the four students out into his garden which was covered in dozens of boxes that were moving erratically as though some animal was trying to break free from them.
Sirius and Remus were probably… what would be the best word for it? ‘Livid’ wouldn’t quite cover it. For Dumbledore hadn’t quite kept his promise. The Chamber was a danger to students, and Harry and Draco were very much involved.
“What do we do now?” Draco whispered, but Harry already knew. And he didn’t have to pretend the snakes were real this time, either, something about their bejeweled eyes seemed alive.
In his mind’s eye, Harry could see Draco’s glowing face as he unwrapped the first present in the stocking, and Remus and Sirius’ grins as he giggled at the silly toy. It was the first Christmas he remembered as feeling a part of a family.
But Harry wasn’t listening, he was more concerned with the lack of the voice in his ears, and the hideous sight before him. A shining, red puddle one the floor, and words written in blood on the wall.
“What more can we do? They’ll come back from this with some amazing new discovery and we’ll do all the heavy lifting and then they’ll take the glory. I’m okay with that, so should you be. We’re the brains.” Draco smiled. He liked Hermione. He really did. She was rational and nice to him and didn’t have that stupid recklessness that Harry frequently displayed. She was a good confidant to have, but Draco sure as hell wasn’t telling her what was really on his mind. He didn’t have to come up with something witty to say, however, because Hermione’s prediction came true and two boys rushed to their table, panting and trying to convey some message.
“Well, my dads say that there are four houses. Hufflepuff is for kind and honest people, Ravenclaw is for smart people, Gryffindor is for brave people, and Slytherin is for ambitious and cunning people.” Draco’s grin faltered a little. “Pads says that people in Slytherin are evil but Moony says that no house is fundamentally bad. I actually kind of want to be in Slytherin, but I haven’t told them.”
Draco took a deep, calming breath. “Because it isn’t real,” Harry opened his mouth to say something but he ploughed on with more emphasis. “
“Thank you, Draco.” The pair shared a look that carried more weight than they spoke about. “But, I did get a letter from Harry.”
“There was a trapped door?” Harry looked at Draco incredulously. How could he have been staring at the ground at a time like that?
“Professor Snape.” he had said, blushing crimson. Draco felt sorry for him. Out of everything he had faced, his parents being tortured by Draco’s biological aunt and Sirius’s cousin to insanity, Voldemort being in his school twice, his biggest fear in the entire world was a man he had to see every single day of his school life. Remus and Draco shared a look as the rest of the class laughed. Poor Neville.
They stayed in that hug for a while before the tears had finally dried on Remus’s cheeks, and he dislodged himself from his husband. They locked eyes.
McGonagall nodded. “That was exactly our thinking, I just needed your permission to get to work fireproofing it, perhaps expanding it. We don't want Draco and Harry close to each other when they lose control at the same time.”
“You’re not bleeding.” The boy tilted his head back as the dark haired boy looked closer. “You’re still not bleeding.”
The first Quidditch match of the season was coming up, Slytherin vs. Gryffindor, and Harry couldn’t be more excited. Practise was gruelling, Flint was working everyone really hard, which was a good distraction for Harry. His social life was ridiculous. He finally truly understood how Draco feels every day, everyone watching you with fear in their eyes or trembling awe. Barely anyone ever looking at you as more than a reputation, nobody bothering or being brave enough to try to learn about the real person behind it. Harry could never quite understand why Draco was so glad to have his friendship, but now he could. Real friends are rarer than anything. Which was why he was still feeling extremely guilty about Quidditch.
Sorry I've been so inconsistent with my uploads recently, school had been kicking my butt, but I wanna get back on that grind. I have some really cute ideas for the Christmas chapter so I will keep powering through.
Defense with Mad-Eye Moody wasn’t scheduled for the fourth year Slytherins until Wednesday and they were to share it with the Hufflepuffs. Moody had made quite the impression already when he showed up late to the Welcoming Feast.
The conversation was just as mysterious as their other one in front of the mirror, the other man even avoided mentioning Draco at all, just like before. He explained ‘the power of love’ and what Nicolas Flamel would do now, thankfully they were destroying the stone, as he thought they definitely should. Harry still had a few questions, though, and wasn’t hopeful that they would be answered without a stupid riddle he needed to crack.
Draco cackled and turned to Harry with a smile that could blind Voldemort, he had tears of happiness in his eyes, making them a more potent shade of dark silver. “I love it, Harry. Thank you.”
“It’s Filch! Run!” Harry scream-whispered at Draco who looked longingly at the door of the library as he dragged him away. The boys ran until their lungs hurt and finally stopped at a big, wooden door. Harry tried to open it but it wouldn’t budge.
“Yeah.” They shook themselves after a few moments of pause and downed their drinks. With one last meaningful look, Draco exited through the purple flames, and prayed to whatever God was out there, that Harry would be okay.
What was this person waiting for? Draco noticed his edges becoming more defined, more real. Perhaps he was waiting for that, to be a fully fledged person, before taking them on. He was getting the life from Ginny, so what they needed to do was kill him in order to get her back, right? But he was going to put up a fight, and he had a Basilisk on his side. They didn’t stand a chance.
“Do you ever wonder, if Peter hadn’t ratted us out, if James and Lily were still here, if they would have been able to handle this situation with their son and our son better than we are?” he asked, turning towards Sirius.
“You see, the ten other governors contacted me and asked for me back.” stated the headmaster. “They were under the impression that Arthur Weasley’s daughter was dead, and they felt that I was the best man for the job.”
“And do you, Sirius Orion Black, take Remus John Lupin to be your lawfully and magically wedded husband?”
“Are you ready?” he asked, staring down at them intensely. They nodded in affirmative. “Very well. What you are about to hear isn’t going to change the course of history, as everything is preordained. But you are about to find out your fates. From this day forward, all we can offer you is support. Nothing more. Nothing less.”
“Harry,” He started, and the other boy's eyes swivelled back to him when called. “What are you doing for Christmas?”
He tilted his head up to look at Dumbledore, checking if that was true, who then gave a look to Snape, who nodded and  left the room in a dramatic flurry of robes. Returning to the conversation, Moony continued. “A lycanthropist is a person who can shapeshift into a werewolf, be it voluntarily or involuntarily. I don't know how anybody found out. We both wanted to wait and tell you when you were a little older, but somebody must have told the papers. However, it seems that the general opinion is, that you were put into our custody because we would know how to deal with you. But, darling, you aren’t a werewolf! That is all speculation! I don’t know how it managed to make its way onto the front page, especially when there are more important things happening right now, but Dumbledore is issuing a public statement later today. Hopefully, that will be enough.”
Snape smirked. “Likely story.” His attention turned back to the map and, in his distraction, Harry quickly ducked down to get the cloak and shove it hastily in his pocket - Snape apparently hadn’t seen it.
“No.” said Pads and Moony, simultaneously. But, realistically, there wasn’t much they could do, Harry wanted to hear what Dumbledore had to say, maybe demand some explanation.
“I just don’t understand, how come Harry has such a good boggart? All I’m stuck with is something that has scarred me for life!”
This shut him up. He sat back down on the floor from where he had unknowingly risen, and looked at Draco as though he were a bug on the bottom of his shoe.
“Yes. A dangerous wolf.” Draco raised his eyes to meet his teacher’s defiantly. There was some kind of stand-off happening that none of the classmates could decipher, but were enjoying immensely.
“I’m going to be the knight.” The game progressed slowly but it seemed that Ron had a handle on things. Draco had to hand it to him, that kind of forward thinking was a surprisingly Slytherin trait and it was admirable. Soon enough, Ron had to make the decision to be sacrificed. In spite of himself, Draco was worried. He had seen what the other side did to pieces that were captured, and he didn’t want anyone getting injured or dying on this trip. Ron made the command and was, sure enough, tossed to the ground. Hermione shrieked but stayed on her spot. The injured boy told Harry what he needed to do, and Harry complied. The next move was made. Harry now only needed to move into the spot that would ensure them the win. Once he did, the King tossed the crown off of his head. They had won.
“DUMBY!” Remus could no longer see his husband’s head as it was crammed so far into the fireplace, he wondered if it would be difficult to get it out. “You had better come here right now or I swear to Merlin’s saggy balls that I will come through this Floo and trash your office!”
“Yes, I’ll tell you everything.” Pads had stepped away by now, sensing that it wasn’t his moment, and conjured a few extra seats to go beside the one that Draco had been occupying before. When everyone was seated, Moony took a deep breath and looked Draco right in the eye. “Draco, I am aware that we really should have told you this before but I was honestly scared and I didn't think that anybody would know. I'm sorry you had to find out like this.”
“You’ll be okay, Harry, they’re gone now. Forever. You have seen the last of them.” There were not enough words to describe how happy Harry was. There would come a day where Harry was willing to talk about everything the Dursleys did to him, but at that moment, Harry wanted nothing more than to just pretend that he had been a part of Draco’s family since the beginning. Sirius pulled away and gave him a quick once over before shrinking his trunk and putting it in the tiny storage compartment on his bike. Harry sat himself comfortably in the sidecar with Hedwig slotted between his knees and Sirius revved the engine and took off from the ground. The last memory that Harry would ever have of the Dursleys was one that he would treasure forever: their horrified faces when Sirius spelled out the words ‘Fuck you’ in the sky with his wand and sailed him away on his flying motorbike.
Three days before Harry and Draco were due to return to Hogwarts, Remus and Sirius felt as though they needed to have some difficult conversations that they had been putting off. It started with Remus as he asked to have a private word with Draco and led him to the kitchen.
Finally, Harry managed to stay awake for more than a few seconds and actually managed to retain a normal conversation. He was propped up on his pillows when he realised that a group of people were actually glaring at him, worriedly. Remus, Sirius, Draco, Ron and Hermione - even Dumbledore! Harry rubbed his eyes to make sure that he was seeing them correctly.
The group tiptoed through a passageway before entering a room that was filled with butterflies of some description. Draco furrowed his brows as he tried to figure out what the problem was as Harry tried the door.
On the 31st October 1981, the unimaginable happened. The Wizarding World shifted in a catastrophic way whilst every member of it celebrated the supposed defeat of ‘You-Know-Who’. Little did they know that a beast was lurking in the shadows. Voldemort would rise again. And this time, he wasn’t taking prisoners.
“It’s good practise, actually.” he said. “How many players know each position equally well? Next year, when Montague leaves, I’ll have a really good shot at Chaser!”
“Dumbledore,” Sirius started, fingers pinched over the bridge of his nose. “I am sick of yelling at you, but I just want you to assure me that you don’t know of any danger that may befall Harry, or Draco for that matter, this year.” The old wizard stood up from the chair behind his desk,
For a few days - weeks? Months? Years? - Harry drifted in and out of sleep, sometimes opening his eyes to see a redheaded boy playing Wizard’s Chess with a bushy haired girl, or a stern looking witch, who Harry vaguely remembered, peering down at him over her glasses, or a boy, who Harry assumed was some kind of guardian angel, working his lower lip with his teeth and watching him curiously, concerned. When he would see that Harry was awake, his face lit up and he tried to say something, but it all sounded like absolute nonsense to Harry.
School is a bit better now, which is good. I think I just needed to get used to being around assholes every day lol.
They kissed like that for a while, pausing every now and again for breath. The kiss was steady and warm and exactly what they both needed. Each time they parted, Remus would whisper a small
“Yeah. Christmas, Quidditch, my seventh birthday…” he didn’t mention that he had also tried thinking about what he saw in the Mirror of Erised, despite it’s fucked up origins. It was awful, and he wouldn’t repeat it, but he also wouldn’t deny that it was worth the try.
Oh my God! We're one chapter away from this first book being over! This is so exciting, I am genuinely really happy with this whole story. I've got a lot of ideas for future books, I've given a small taste of what we might expect in the future in his chapter.
“Obviously, it’s still not that safe.” Saving the school (and Wizarding World) from yet another threat had made Harry feel bolder speaking to Dumbledore than he usually would. “Now, my other question: Why did I feel that weird hot flush before I drank the potion to get through the fire? Draco said he felt it too.” The older man seemed perplexed at Harry’s last statement but moved on.
“Yes. I just threw a snowball in Draco’s face and he said it didn’t feel cold, help me. I don’t know what to do.” Sirius was properly sobbing now. The kind of heartbreaking sobs that held your lungs in a clench. He wanted to ease him out of it but could figure out how to move his limbs. They were twelve for God’s sake. No twelve year old should have to suffer from that.
Draco chanced a glance at Snape’s face, it was beyond rage. He and Harry would be lucky if they got off with a year’s detention, they would probably be expelled. Although, they didn’t exactly break any Hogwarts rules. Technically, the school year hadn’t started yet, so no one could punish them. Really, it was their fault for sealing the platform off too quickly. Draco did his best to repeat all of this for the crowd, but was met only with even darker expressions.
“Hello!” Ron didn’t reply, just backed away, rejoining the crowd of onlookers who had just now realised that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were standing in their midst. Suddenly, half of the people there were eyeing Draco with fear, and Harry with awe, but some of them had blank expressions, unaware of the history. Draco would confess, he was a little too.
Remus sighed and tilted his head back - he looked as old as she felt. “Nothing we didn’t already know, or hadn’t already figured out, unfortunately.” He paused here to grab his husband’s hand. She smiled slightly, at least not all hope was lost. Remus turned to her with penetrating eyes. “He’s coming back isn’t he?”
“Fine, you go with Moons.” The trio walked to the nearest apparition point in their neighbourhood and departed, instantly finding themselves outside King’s Cross station, in an area that had been warded enough to allow them to slip into the crowd until they found the platforms nine and ten, and between them, stood a young boy with unruly black hair, broken glasses, and a scar running down the centre of his forehead, in the shape of a lightning bolt.
Harry’s summer was actually going really well. He decided to stay with McGonagall, purely because she seemed to really want him to, and he felt safer with someone that he knew, but the Weasleys came over frequently for big games of Quidditch, the Professor herself joined in too as she was apparently a Chaser back in her day.
Sirius placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder and squeezed. “It’s okay, son.” he whispered before retreating to stand next to his husband.
For Harry, Draco, with help from Remus, had charmed a Muggle book of constellations so that the dots glowed and twinkled like real stars
“Merlin’s beard!” cried Lockhart, but the boys shushed him, for all they knew, the Heir of Slytherin was down the tunnel.
He was about to stride off when, completely unprompted, Mad-Eye produced a wand and his vision blurred. Quite suddenly, he was half a foot high and being repeatedly bounced up and down. He was being trashed against the floor at a pace for about half a minute when finally, his vision and height returned to normal and the thrashing stopped.
“Nobody? Noone knows the difference between a werewolf and an animagus?” he sneered, watching them all with glinting eyes. “Not even you, Draco? I would have thought out of all people, you would know.”
“I know, I know, you’ll cut off all my beautiful hair!” Remus smiled as his son barked out a laugh when his wonderful husband lifted the young boy off the floor and buried his face in his neck, breathing in the scent.
Harry rejoiced and hugged Draco so hard it lifted him off the ground, but Hermione stayed on the floor where she was nursing an injured Ron.
pertaining to Draco and Harry, and I mean anything. None of this will work if we don’t keep communicating.”
School is starting for me soon so I'll be posting a lot of chapters later in the day, still going to keep up with it though - I hope!
“Alright, I will not be letting either of you near a dementor for at least a few weeks yet, so we’re going to have to use our imagination. I want to first repeat the incantation:
“Pads, need I remind you that I am probably just as dangerous as that dog?” Pads paused at that, and gave Remus a contemplative look, and then sighed.
Draco gave him a look that told him he wasn’t crazy for being worried. Still, he blindly trusted Dumbledore, as everybody seemed to always do, and began to follow his fellow Slytherins to his common room. On the way there, however, he came to the realisation Hermione was still in the girls toilets.
“No.” The boy turned and faced Harry with a petulant glare, it was clear that he was not going anywhere.
As the rest of the students bickered and laughed good-naturedly, Draco and Harry were solemn and quiet as they trudged down the winding path to Sirius and Remus’s cottage, avoiding the shops altogether. Draco wanted to say something to lift his friend’s spirits, but didn’t feel that anything he said would sound all that jolly.
“I want to talk about how you’re doing. I am technically your godfather so it is my duty to check.” Harry’s eyes dimmed slightly.
“Thanks, Luna.” Harry supplied for him. He noticed that Hermione was watching Luna in utter fascination.
Draco sifted through the pages before turning to the first story. “Rumplestiltskin.” he started, smiling.
“But it seems you are a Gryffindor also.” spoke a voice from the door. They all turned around to see the headmaster, smiling slightly, eyes twinkling. Behind him was Professor McGonagall, looking as stern as ever. “I have just come back from meeting with the Weasley family. They would like to thank you two for saving their daughter, young Ginny should make a full recovery.”
Harry began to mull this over before he reminded himself that Ginny was waiting and that he didn’t have the time. “Fine.” He turned to the snakes again. “
The man conjured a dark oak round table, big enough for the people present, and four chairs around it. Each party got themselves settled.
Remus smiled and shook his head fondly. Sirius marvelled at the way the other boy managed to make his heart skip with such a small movement.
Draco and Harry calmly walked over to the desk and surveyed the instruments. They were exquisite. Engraved along the blade of the sword were the words ‘Godric Gryffindor’, and along the side of the bow were the words ‘Salazar Slytherin’, each of them were encrusted with jewels the size of eggs, that glittered in the midday sun.
How are you guys, anyway? Y'all have been a bit quiet x I hope you're good, half term is over for me now so we have to start up at school again but with the second lockdown I honestly wonder how long that's going to last. How was Halloween for you guys? My friend and I made shortbread and cinnamon rolls (they were really good) and then I spent most of the morning writing this. I really hope it's okay I've planned this one out for a while and I usually have my sister proofread for me but she's asleep so I don't want to wake her up and I wanted to get it posted so ahh haha
“See you later.” he breathed, smiling serenely. If it weren’t for the lyrics, Harry would have been sure that Draco was the one who wrote the song, but he never seriously thought of Harry as a hero, more of an idiot who got himself into too much trouble, and Draco compared his eyes to emeralds rather than toads, anyway.
Remus nodded slightly. “Yes.” The man looked at him directly. “You know today, when you were so happy that we called you family?”
Pansy bit her lip and heaved her cat onto her lap, stroking it absentmindedly. “My mum says that’s wrong.”
So what do you guys think Amortentia would smell like to you? Most appetising answer wins an imaginary slice of my awesome cake.
By the time he decided to turn in, it was 11:00. He yawned widely and sorted the books back onto the shelves, putting a temporary silencing charm on them so they made as little noise as possible. He put the same charm on his feet, and made his way back to Slytherin. Distracted by thoughts of a warm, inviting bed, Draco almost didn’t notice Harry’s head, plunged into the centre of a diary. But on the double take, it hit him how utterly ridiculous the sight should be. He stomped over to Harry’s side and yanked his head back out again, only to find the other boy looking dazed and irritated at his time inside the book being cut short.
Draco was wistfully gazing at the doors of the Great Hall, out of which the Professor had just exited. Harry elbowed him, inexplicably angry.
“You have been very brave, Dobby.” Remus chimed in, just before Dobby apparated with a loud CRACK. The moment he was gone, both of the men turned to Draco and Harry.
About forty minutes into the journey, Draco felt the disillusionment charms falter and fall off. He screamed over the engine to Harry, “We’re not invisible anymore!”
“Two rolls of parchment by Monday morning on werewolves with particular emphasis on recognising it.” The class groaned.
“You have both been very foolish.” He swiped his greasy hair back from his forehead before continuing. “However, you have caused no damage to the grounds, thanks to your driving skills, so I can’t give you a punishment. Your fathers, Draco, will decide what to do.”
“I don’t know anything about wizards.” Harry corrected. Truly, he had never felt more out of his depth. He expected to be made fun of for being so in the dark but instead saw Draco shrug and grin and the chance to utilize his knowledge.
“I’m done with this visit now.” he said, barely above a whisper. “This is the last time we will ever speak.”
Remus was back thirty seven minutes after the rest of them were. His husband immediately hugged him close before checking that everything was alright.
Remus wasn’t sure. He didn’t much like the idea of teaching in a class of privileged pure-blood brats, who wouldn’t listen to him simply because he answered to the moon’s strict rules, but Draco needed him. As did those privileged pure-blood brats, they needed somebody to teach them a better way of viewing the world. They needed a competent Defense teacher.  “Yes, but on one condition.”
” Harry’s eyes widened. “What is that?” He took the hat down from his head and revealed the ruby-encrusted hilt of what looked like a sword. Curiously, Draco watched as the boy grasped it and revealed the most gorgeous piece of weaponry he had ever seen.
One too many glasses of Remus’s eggnog led to the man screaming the lyrics to ‘Feed the World’ by the end of the day. Sirius ended up dragging his husband into singing an improvised version of ‘Baby It’s Cold Outside’ while Draco and Harry cheered and whooped from the side.
“Hello, Vernon, Petunia.” His voice was like shards of ice, cold and menacing. “I wanted to tell you in person, if Harry is amenable, you will never need to see him again.” Harry’s eyes widened and filled with tears. It was more than he could have hoped for, to say goodbye to his current life in exchange for a better one. He couldn’t speak, or express how happy he was, so just stared as the Dursleys gave Harry curt nods of goodbye. They couldn’t seem to find words either. All Harry could do was raise a hand and fitfully twitch it in some sort of resemblance of a wave. Sirius had turned back to him now, eyes wary. “Are you alright, Harry? Would you like that?” There were tears of pure joy streaming down Harry’s face.
The family collectively replaced talking with eating and devoured the treat in silence. Nobody knew what to say. There was nothing that any of them could say about James and Lily. Nothing that any of them could say about the boggart. All they could do was just spoon mouthful after mouthful of sticky pastry in their mouths, hoping that once they were finished, they still wouldn’t be expected to speak.
Draco, from Harry, had received a Muggle book too, uncharmed though, this time. It was a story book, evidently. Much like his book of wizard fairy tales, but these were written by-
“Fine. But hold tight.” The machine rose unsteadily but Draco kept his head on. So long as he stayed calm, he was sure that he could figure it out.
Kingsley and his team showed up and began to take Peter away when the real feeling of dread began to creep up Minerva’s spine. For, you see, she had assumed that the Aurors knew what to do about Peter’s animagus form, and had planned accordingly. Remus had said that they were aware of it, so she couldn’t quite account for what happened.
What Draco did then was something that he couldn’t explain. He leaned forward and pressed his lips to Harry’s in a chaste kiss. The other boy didn’t protest, he blushed and grinned. They didn’t talk about it. They didn’t need to.
“Minerva, I’m sure that the students will understand how dangerous they are if we explain it to them!” said Dumbledore urgently, attempting to soothe her.
“I know, I know, I just think tha’ it would be safer fer you if you stayed away, do you understand?”
I tend to only post on a Sunday but I had a surge of inspiration to write this chapter (the idea for which has been bouncing around my brain for some time now)
“Isn’t it exciting?” said Pansy with her cat-like grin. Harry had missed her, oddly enough, she had just been beginning to soften up when school ended last year. “I hear Beauxbatons boys are gorgeous.”
“Which one would you get though?” asked Sirius at the same time as Remus said. “You are not getting a tattoo.”
“Are you okay, Professor?” he asked, noticing how she had retrieved a quill and some parchment from her shelves and was hastily penning a letter. “Would you like me to go and get you some coffee?”
“Okay. We’ll be careful.” Draco glowed internally at the inclusion. Although getting into trouble was never something he was too fond of, he liked the sound of access to the restricted section, especially now that he was looking for something specific.
Harry was going to do as Draco said and turn the book in - he really was! He loved Draco more than anyone else, and that meant more to him than a stupid mystery. But he didn’t trust Dumbledore, so after Charms, Harry began to walk in the direction of McGonagall’s office, but an fiery orange blur put a dint in his plans when Ginny Weasley bumped into his side, knocking him to the ground.
So everyone was resolutely refusing to speak up about werewolves when they were asked to, because they knew it would only give Snape ammunition.
“I’d miss you too.” Their special moment was interrupted by a polite cough from Dumbledore, who was standing in the corner, on the wrong end of twin glares from Sirius and Remus.
“Hello, Hagrid. We were actually just talking about you!” Ron said, clearly thrilled at the interruption. “We want to ask you about an animal.” Hagrid nodded at him to continue. “What do you know about three-headed dogs?”
“Are you kidding? You could cook a goose in here, no way!” They continued the back and forth for a while before Draco finally acquiesced, allowing Harry to light the fire, instead opting to practise his cooling charms. Once Harry did, he waited for a few minutes for the heart to kick in, but it didn’t. “Harryyyyyyy… it’s so hot!”
James looked over to Sirius, seemingly expecting an answer, only to find him gazing down at Remus with a blank expression. He seemed to come to a realisation.
Remus had only three memories in his life that were powerful enough to cast a Patronus. First, his wedding, specifically the moment when their lips met after James had announced that they were legally married, Remus knew then that even if he died in the war, he would do it happily so long as he died knowing that he was joined to the love of his life for all eternity. Second, the day that Draco turned seven, when he finally looked around to see the family he had longed for all his life, when he realised that he had what he’d daydreamed about having, but never thought he would. And third, the day that little ball of hope first sprouted in his chest, melting the chains that constricted his heart, lighting the way to a brighter tomorrow. If that memory hadn’t happened, Remus wasn’t sure if he would have lived to experience the other two.
“Not quite, Draco,” Riddle clicked his tongue. “Close, though, very close. You see, little Ginny here opened the Chamber, and wrote all of the messages on the wall, and Petrified all those Mudbloods.” Harry gasped and Tom smiled maniacally at him, it was understandable why. Draco usually found Harry’s wide-eyes innocence adorable, but it was more comical at a time like this. “Don’t worry, Harry, she wasn’t aware that she was doing any of it. After I would possess her to do things, she would have large gaps in her memory. She would wake up with feathers all over her clothes or blood on her hands.” He opened his mouth as if to continue but Draco interrupted him, he always had had a problem with interruption.
“Trust me, dad. I already do.” Draco was always quite reserved with his emotions. They could often be so strong that they practically toppled him over. He would also be lying if he said that he wasn’t almost toppled over by them when he first met Harry. He could remember it as if it were only yesterday. The piercing, emerald eyes, scruffy hair. It wasn’t even the scar Draco had noticed first. The scar didn’t matter to him. All he cared for was his shy smile and slightly pink cheeks. Draco knew then that Harry Potter would be the death of him, and he had spent every day since then doing his best to ensure that wouldn’t happen. But, sure enough, the untidy eleven year old Draco had met on the platform that day all those years ago had snaked into his heart and built a home there.
“This fight suddenly became easier.” Draco whispered. Honestly, with his sight back, Draco felt as though they actually had somewhat of a chance, even if it was still slim. Began running through all of the spells he had learned, none of which seemed powerful enough to take down a beast of this size. Harry, however, seemed to be trying on the hat. “What are you doing?”
After dinner in the Great Hall, Draco had insisted that they go to the library. He had wanted to check up on some facts that he had read in the Prophet that morning on whether werewolves could procreate, and how it would effect their offspring, when Harry heard a strange whispering.
“A bit of old parchment!” Said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as though Harry had mortally offended him. “Explain, George.”
Suddenly, Draco could feel the weight of another person sitting on the edge of his bed and looked up to find Harry, watching him and working his lip worriedly. Upon first seeing the boy, Draco was immersed. He had a young, boyish charm about him that was endearing and making him laugh or smile was a feeling that could only be compared to the way he felt when he first flew on a broom or sat in the sidecar of Pads’ motorcycle. But at the present he now he looked stressed and upset.
He didn’t get the chance, though, because Crabbe and Goyle had gotten an idea into their thick heads and were acting on it as they spoke. They were perched on top of a rock, with handfuls of small stones in their hands, chucking them at Buckbeak, alternating between handfuls and individual shots. It was clear they were aiming for the eye. Before anyone could reprimand them, the hippogriff retaliated by rising up on its hind legs and charging at them, paying little heed to the rope around its neck that was being held onto securely by Hagrid.
The Weasleys went on holiday to Egypt because they won the wizard lottery, which was very exciting, but came but just in time for Harry’s birthday party, which was being held at Hogwarts.
. He was the reason Harry grew up without his parents. His focus had been on Lucius for Draco’s sake these past few months but, he wanted to see Peter Pettigrew, that hateful man, dead more than he wanted to see the sunrise tomorrow.
Remus scoffed. “Dark magic? It is clearly enchanted to insult whoever tries to figure out what it is, which is clearly something you would find in Zonko’s. May I remind you that Sirius is the manager of the Hogsmeade branch? Harry probably just got it from there last Hogsmeade weekend. Really, Severus, you’ve got to be joking.”
Also I've had some ideas for other fic ideas that I kind of want to indulge (Drarry duh) just in case you might be interested. I want to do something period (like Victorian England or Gatsby style 20s)
He sailed around the field, keeping high in the air but never staying in one spot too long, until he finally saw the Snitch, the real one this time. It was nearer the ground, but just seemed to be hovering in the middle of the pitch. He raced towards it, all the while being pitifully followed by the Gryffindor Seeker, Mclaggen, and the bludger. But, just as he closed his hands around the cool metal, the ball finally caught up with him and jammed into his arm. He fell off his broom, only falling about two metres, and landed in a head on the floor.
When they got to the classroom, they were told to leave their bags and follow him into the staff room, wands ready. Along the way, Remus had impressed everyone by putting Peeves in his place with a clever spell, and Draco had felt a surge of pride.
” It said. Harry pushed his ear up against the wall to hear it better, ignoring Draco’s protestations. The voice moved along the corridor, Harry followed it. And they ended up running at full speed down the hallways, getting more and more lost with every turn. Draco was panting behind him.
“And those are Chocolate Frogs. I love these. But be careful, they have a tendency to jump around!” Harry cracked open the packaging and out flew a brown blob that landed on the window and flew out before Harry had a chance to catch it. “Oh, tough luck. Here, you can have one of mine.” Draco passed Harry one of his stack “But if you get Devin Whitehorn can you give it to me ‘cos I need that one.”
“Harry, I think we should go.” Draco started, glancing back at his friend, but Tom interrupted him before he could go on.
Since Draco was an alternate, he could attend practises, and even played a big part of them. He learned the basics for every position so that he could jump in if they needed him, which made him an an even stronger player that he was before. He actually didn’t seem to be that angry about it either.
Harry was having a wonderful week. He and Draco took photos whenever they could, wherever they could, even in places that weren’t very exciting, like the boy’s toilets of the second floor, or by the picture of the jaguars playing Naughts and Crosses up by Gryffindor Tower. Harry loved it. It felt like he had more of a permanent connection to Draco. As though the other boy would be looking at the photos in the future, telling people about his best friend Harry.
“Nonsense, Draco, this is an adventure.” Harry was sitting in the sidecar instead, goggles on, looking like some kind of crazed person on a mission.
“I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn’t had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested -” Snape started.
“I know, I know. I did the same thing, so did your father. But, what I’m really worried about is what Harry said about you skipping meals.” It was a huge worry for Remus, actually. He could understand better than anyone the temptation to shun your own needs for that of someone else's. At the time, he thought about writing to Draco, to scold him for missing meals, but he knew that it wouldn’t have helped. So he asked Harry to keep an eye on him, and Minerva. Harry would sneak more food onto Draco’s plate or come up with some excuse for them eating together. And Minerva would turn a blind eye when Draco would sneak out to do more research. For the good friends he knew Draco had, Remus was eternally grateful. As was Sirius, who had found it difficult to stay calm. They both knew how lucky they were that Harry had alerted them, if it had gone on they didn’t know what could have happened.
“I’m just so scared. What happens when Harry and Draco realise that they aren’t like the other kids? What happens when their magic becomes too powerful to control? How are we supposed to handle that?” Remus paused, mulling it over.
Unfortunately, the teacher who was running the club, was none other that Gilderoy Pompous Arse Lockhart. Harry groaned but Draco elbowed him, gesturing towards the man, who was now addressing them with a condescending air that was so intolerable it made Harry want to rush up to Dumbledore’s office and demand to know all the secrets of the universe, knowing that all he would get was that irritating twinkle the old man got in his eyes whenever he knew something that Harry did not.
“Are you okay?” asked Harry under his breath, nudging Draco’s side. The boy jumped slightly and regarded him with a small smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes.
She seemed to consider this for a while. Harry had started picking up on habits his Professor had, things that he had internally dubbed ‘McGonagallisms’ (he also had ‘Dracoisms’ as another folder in his brain), one of them was a squint in her right eye whenever she was thinking about something really hard, and a flicker in her left eye whenever she was tired. She sighed and lay down her cutlery. “Okay but we’re going to get some Aurors to supervise you, Lucius will probably want to see his son first.”
Night after night, Draco honed his craft. He couldn’t do much, but he supposed that would come with time. At first, all he noticed was a slight chill in the air if he wished there to be so, but a slight chill turned into a bitter cold, which morphed into a mini snow storm, which was as far as he had gotten. He would always build up to it, sometimes he wouldn’t even get to the intense stuff, he would just wave his hand back and forth lazily, leaving in it’s trail a light layer of frost on his sheets which would melt by morning.
What Draco would never admit to anyone was that he knew exactly what he wanted from his life. It was Harry.
“Of course I know the prophecy, but Ice isn’t a real person. Ice is just a power that is randomly given to someone every few generations.” Ron scoffed, looking over to Ginny who rolled her eyes at him.
“OH, RIGHT, YEAH THAT TOM RIDDLE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CLEARING THAT UP FOR ME, HARRY! I HAD FORGOTTEN HOW CLOSE YOU ARE WITH THE MAN WHO OWNED THE RANK OLD BOOK FROM FIFTY YEARS AGO!”
“No. I don’t think the Potter line descends from Salazar Slytherin. Or the Evans line, for that matter.”
“Professor Moody turn him into a ferret?” said Dumbledore to McGonagall. Her lip quirked before replying.
“It’s better,” said Fudge. “But, Remus, I urge you to take it anyway. We all know what Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter can do and they need the support of a close friend.”
Still, Harry also tried to feel proud of himself. Draco had told him countless times that he never allowed himself to be. Flint had been stunned at his flying, blown away by how good he was, especially seeing as he had had very little previous experience. That statement had made Harry glow just a little. Growing up, Harry had never been the best at anything. Dudley had received all the praise. And, once he got to Hogwarts, everyone loved him, but only for a thing he did when he was a baby that he couldn’t even explain. It felt good for people to be recognising him for being good at a thing he put effort into. And he had put effort into flying.
again, i'm sorry for making you wait so long for a new chapter, especially seeing as they're quite short, but that's actually something i'm thinking about changing. would do you prefer a once a week upload schedule (with shorter chapters) or something less frequent but with longer chapters (once i'm done with my exams of course)?
Harry and Draco found out from Pansy Parkinson, who had found out from Blaise Zabini, who had found out from Seamus Finnigan, who had found out from the Gryffindor boys dorm. It wasn’t long before the entire school was whispering about the girl, and Harry felt awful. If he had shared the information he had, or gotten to McGonagall’s office faster, he could have stopped it. Draco reassured him, however, that he shouldn’t blame himself for things that monsters in secret chambers do, but eventually asked Harry if they could go to see her.
“Mr and Mr Lupin-Black, I hear you have been looking for me.” Sirius’s head rose and he heaved with barely repressed rage. He turned around to face Dumbledore with a look of thunder that would have turned anyone to stone.
“You were really good, actually! I saw you fly this summer but I didn’t know you were that good!” he enthused. Draco blushed and linked his hand with Harry’s.
“Siriusly! And old Zonko is getting on a bit so who knows? He might die and leave the place to his most trusted employee.”
He didn’t tell Harry. He didn’t tell anyone. It was his thing. His time to just be. Alone. With this small voice in the back of his head telling him that the cold was a comfort, not an enemy. That if all else failed, it would always be there. And Draco wouldn’t let that be tainted by Remus and Sirius lecturing him about being safe, or Harry suggesting that they do some kind of research on it. He didn’t want to do research. He didn’t care.
“Oh, wow.” Draco’s voice was suddenly thick with emotion. “That’s really Moony...” Then, his expression changed from one of awe to one of horror. He gasped, tears streaking down his face. “Oh..”
The house itself was lovely, a little thatched cottage just off the main road with a wonderful apple tree in the back garden that Draco was exceedingly fond of. It was just big enough for the bench swing that was attached to one of its branches, the swing that he used whenever he could as a comfortable and quiet reading spot.
Still, Remus seemed to be excited underneath all his concern, which was what mattered in the end. And, really, he was going to be incredible. The best Defense professor, probably, that Hogwarts would have seen in years.
Sirius seemed to constantly be furious at Albus Dumbledore. What used to be an unwavering respect, since turned out to be more of a raging hatred for everything the old man stood for. He could carry on ranting for years about his methods, and certainly would, but today he genuinely didn’t have it in him.
He shared a look with his husband that said everything. They were going to get their family through the darkness, someone was going to turn on a light.
“Oh no.” Remus had just received a note from Draco. “Pads!” he yelled, the man (or dog, rather) was out in the garden jumping over fences. “PADS!” the dog turned around. “Come in!”
Quite a short chapter - sorry. I think the next one is longer. I just baked cookies so imagine I am handing one out to each of you! Thank you for keeping up with the story - I'm really proud of how it's turning out.
I am actually already on Chapter 10 so I might update sort of sporadically. I have some sub-plot ideas and some other bits a pieces. Please comment! I love reading them!
“Seriously, Harry. Ginny’s our sister, you saved her life.” There was silence for a moment, Harry took the opportunity to nod at the acknowledgement. “Anyway, we know it off by heart.” Fred continued, shaking off the solemn air.. “We bequeath it to you. We don’t really need it anymore.”
“Boys,” he started. “we understand that you may not want to relive it all again, but do you have any questions you’d like to ask us? It must have been very confusing.” His voice was smooth and comforting, like honey, and made Draco feel safe.
“I’m sorry about his favouritism, he shouldn’t have done that. It was a joint effort.” Hermione smiled and surveyed him with scrutinising eyes.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” After saying goodbye to the man-horse, ‘Firenze’ Harry said his name was, the party walked slowly back to Hagrid’s hut where the two Slytherin boys said their goodbyes and walked back to the castle. When they got to the Slytherin dormitories, Draco fished under his bed for some left-over Christmas chocolate and gave it to Harry, who had looked spooked since he first saw the unicorn.
“Getting married?” Sirius nodded. “Well, I was a lot calmer than you are, that’s for sure. But I remember being really worried that Lily would decide that she actually didn’t want to marry me the second she got on the altar.”
Harry obeyed and they began the long walk to Remus’s office. Once they got settled with crackling fire and some chocolate, Remus produced the map and stared at Harry speculatively.
“I would love to, thank you!” The two embraced and Sirius felt a strange sort of relief. As though he was saving the boy from an unnameable evil.
“What the hell.” it came out as more of a statement than a question. Harry had the decency to look sheepish.
Ginny wasn’t bad at all once you got to know her, she was actually really cool, once she had stopped blushing and thanking him profusely, and an amazing Chaser.
Harry pondered this for a moment, but it didn’t take long for him to realise where he was going wrong. In seconds, he was on his feet again and Remus was standing guard at the door of the cabinet.
“Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs,” sighed George longingly. “We owe them so much.” Harry decided not to mention that he knew the exact identities of two of the creators, and had a strong idea about the others.
“Who dares me to get a tattoo from that witch over there?” he asked the group. He noticed Remus avert his eyes and he thought he may have seen the boy blushing, but it could have been the low lighting.
He felt an urgent pat on his shoulder from Peter, who seemed to be paying attention more than usual.
“Where am I? Why am I here? Who brought me here? Where’s my wand? What’s a wand, why did I just say that?” He continued listing questions until Draco guided him to the slide and softly told him that he should stay put and really try to answer those questions. Draco turned back to Harry with a signature eye roll and gestured for them to continue, he could never fail to be in absolute awe of his friend.
“Go on then!” Hagrid roared. He slapped the hippogriff’s behind and it took off, soaring into the air gracefully.
“Knowing Dumbledore, he’s not as gone as you might think.” Draco seemed confused at that statement, the man’s track record actually proved otherwise, but he assumed that Harry was simply trying to scare Riddle. It didn’t matter, anyway, for their attention was drawn to a strange, eerie music that seemed to be playing from nowhere, and it seemed to be getting more and more intense. Draco felt strange, light and shaky. It was getting difficult to focus on the mass murderer standing next to them until flames erupted from the top of one of the pillars, ending the melody.
Harry and Draco stiffened and Ron huffed incredulously. “I’m sorry, a spirit?” Like the general public, Ron was aware of the prophecy. It was made public knowledge by the Ministry of Magic when Grindelwald, a famous child of Ice, lost control of his powers and ended up killing a lot of his own followers and was deemed more dangerous than ever. But the concepts of Fire and Ice were always interpreted as personifications of the powers, rather than actual spirits who could possess people. However, some people interpreted it differently.
Harry didn’t expect any thanks for saving Ginny’s life, truly, it wasn’t something he had done to win back the good graces of the Weasley family. He did it merely out of his own stubborn hero complex.
There was a moment of heavy breathing before Remus answered. “Yes, very good.” Harry sighed, relieved. “You must understand, Harry, that he was never a bad man. He made a few bad decisions, yes, but I was there when he made them, and didn’t stop him, which doesn’t make me any better. Or Pads, for that matter.”
PS. I would greatly recommend that you read the Brothers Grimm fairytales for fun, Draco will be reading them and making pretentious references to them a bit from now on, he's dramatic like that. Like me, really. (You can get them for free on Wattpad.) They can get a little dark though, so be warned. Draco will probably remark on that later. I reckon Muggle literature should be his new obsession.
“How did that happen?” Draco asked in wonder, but they didn’t have time. Harry geared himself up for battle, as the snake had finally decided to ignore the Phoenix. Out of sheer curiosity, Draco reached out and placed the hat on his head. After a few seconds, something heavy hit his head also, and he pulled out a bow, accompanied by a dozen arrows. All were made with some kind of dark wood, so dark it was almost black, and were encrusted with shimmering emeralds, exactly like the ones on the serpents at the entrance to the Chamber. He looked up to see Harry smiling down at him with twinkling eyes.
“Well, I didn’t think that they would get involved! I was away on business! I sent the order to close down the school, I didn’t know they were doing research!” he held his hands up in the air innocently and looked up at his former student from his seat.
He begged, his hips shaking as he rutted back onto Harry’s cock, trying to work him deeper, needing his come deep inside.
When Draco finally started to whine in discomfort, Harry withdrew the clasper, and his ovipositor finally felt the relief of jetting out some of its own thick jelly, filling his mate even further, and forming a fresh plug to seal Draco’s cunt up again.
Their kiss broke with a gasp though as Draco’s hands flew down to his stomach, panic once again bleeding into his expression.
“I can do a fair bit more than a toy, so you might still end up finding it disappointing.” Harry chided. “Can’t find a toy that can eat your arse til you cry, can you?”
Before posting this I just wanted to quickly add that if you're a Tumblr user I actually have a blog on it that you can check out where I'm going to try posting updates or whatever. Absolutely no pressure, I just wanted to let y'all know just in case you really like following writers on Tumblr.
“At 11:30? No, that bastard is hiding from us!” Remus sighed again and yanked Sirius out of the fire.
“He has to eat some time and we know from the house elves that rats are kept strictly out, so he must be hungry.” said Remus. “He’s a brown and white mouse and his tail looks a lot like a worm.” Draco grimaced. “He is also missing a finger, so keep an eye out for that. When you think you’ve found him, stun him or do something to keep him there, got it?”
Harry and Draco were simply trotting down the corridor, discussing the duelling club and all that came with it, when Harry stopped dead in his tracks. Justin was collapsed on the floor, rigid, with a look of shock on his face, and Nearly Headless Nick was floating a few feet above him, no longer pearly which and translucent, instead black and smoky. Justin had been clearly petrified, but he had no clue what had happened to Nick.
“Madame Hooch!” said one of the Weasley twins, Harry thought it was Fred. “This bludger keeps going after Harry, I think someone’s messed with it!” She came over and inspected the other twin, George, he assumed, who was desperately wrestling with the ball that seemed intent on flying after Harry.
Big thanks to my sister, we sort of did a chapter swap today. I wrote her Klaine chapter for the thing that she's writing and she wrote this one (most of it, anyway)
It was all very exciting, Harry had never had a big party before, especially not with so many people he could genuinely say that he was close to. Whenever something big happened with the Dursleys he was always put on kitchen duty or told to stay in his room. He had a very distinct memory of being about six or seven, and waking up on his birthday to the sound of music, and getting excited, thinking that his Aunt and Uncle were finally going to celebrate with him, but walking downstairs only to be told that they were testing out music for a party of their own they were having. A party he was most certainly not invited to.
“Dobby has got a sock,” said Dobby in disbelief. “Master even put it in a pouch for Dobby! Dobby is free!”
He needed someone to talk to, but Draco wasn’t exactly qualified. So he talked to Remus. Right after they gave him the rundown on everything that was happening with the dementors, Harry asked for the man to sit down.
“Keep your voice down, yes, Draco and I saw it. It looked like it was guarding something.” Ron had a gleam in his eye.
“We’re just waiting on Cornelius, who should be here any second.” They all looked around to the fire where, sure enough, seconds later, a portly man clambered out. He said his hellos with a grave expression and sat in the vacant spot.
They walked first to Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop, where Hermione and Draco shared their mutual enthusiasm for different kinds of quill, and gushed over varying thicknesses of parchment. They then went to Dervish and Banges, where the pair weighed the advantages and disadvantages of copper over brass, in regards to the making of cauldrons. And finally, to Honeydukes, where they exited over the new flavour of sugar quill, and shared their similar fondness for them.
He tried, but it was actually quite difficult to speak a language you didn’t even know you could. He tried a couple of times to say ‘Open up’ but Draco always informed him that he was just speaking English. “Pretend it’s a real snake.” That worked better, Harry envisioned it moving and slithering around the tap.
McGonagall closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She looked at Harry. “Would you care to give me a better explanation than this? Perhaps with a tad more detail.”
Moony arrived back in the dining room from the kitchen, where he was retrieving his special supply of after-dinner chocolates.
At the time, it all seemed to occur in slow motion, like they were watching a modified memory of the event, rather than the real thing.
In a series of rabid screams or anger and emotion, and wave after wave of icy attacks on trees and plants, Draco allowed the irritation to channel into powerful snowstorms.
Underneath it, something was hanging. Upon closer inspection, it was Mrs Norris, still and rigid. Unmoving.
“HERMIONE RUN!” Hermione darted out from underneath the sinks and placed herself warily behind Draco. Harry, on the other hand, was acting purely on instinct, and took a running jump, fastening his arms around the neck of the troll and shoving, with as much force as he could muster, his wand into the troll’s nose.
“Yes, me.” Remus snapped his mouth shut immediately after speaking, eyes wide. “Not me! Not me, specifically. But I have some friends, maybe someone in the Order?” He was stuttering adorably and the corners of Sirius’s mouth seemed to quirk upwards of their own accord.
But Harry seemed to be thinking on his feet. “... You’re a wreck! You’re barely alive. That’s where all your power got you. You’re hiding. You’re ugly, you’re foul!”
“This means that security will probably be heightened when we start. I’ll be having a meeting with Professor Dumbledore later today to discuss it.” There was a slight tremble behind her words that she hid well, but Harry had had a lot of practice holding back tears, and could hear when someone was doing it. It seemed a little inappropriate for him to give her a hug but he tried to put on his most reassuring smile.
“However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or possible.” The pair sat in a comfortable silence for a little while. A small part of Harry was confused at Dumbledore’s blatant ignorance of his question after Draco. Usually, if he didn’t want to answer a question, he would do it, but not directly. In the most confusing and pretentious way that he could so as the person who asked the question forgets why they asked in the first place. But this time, he just seemed sad and broken, and couldn’t even bring himself to recognise that Harry had spoken. The larger part, however, just felt hollow at the knowledge that the Mirror did not show him another universe. Only the one he wished he was living in. “The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever
“Because it’s the right thing to do. It clearly isn’t just any book, so we should turn it in. Or at least to McGonagall.”
Sirius didn’t know what kind of home Harry had lived in only a term before, but he’d be damned if he let Harry go back.
“So, Harry, you will be staying with us for the rest of the holiday and, if you want to, you can stay with us over Christmas.” said Remus. “Now, we promise you that, no matter what, you will never go back to the Dursleys, do you understand?” Draco was worried. This sounded like a very serious discussion, he had known the Dursleys were bad, but he hadn’t realised exactly
“One problem at a time, please.” The pair continued walking until they were stopped again by a putrid smell filling their nostrils. They looked up, only to have their eyes met with a gross, gangly creature, striding down the hall. Harry and Draco ducked behind a statue as it passed, seemingly oblivious to their existence, and watched as it entered the room next to them. “Lock it in, lock it in!” Harry did as he was told and turned the key until he heard a satisfying click. Draco breathed a sigh of relief before freezing, eyes wide at the sound of girlish screams coming from the room they had just locked. “Oh Salazar, unlock the door!” Harry reached forward once more, now panicked, Hermione was now locked in a room with a troll. When the door swung open, the pair darted inside and immediately ducked as a piece of painted plywood came rocketing at their heads.
PS if you do see any typos, I will not be offended if you tell me because I wrote this just now and I should be doing homework so I am not in my right mind.
was in Azkaban for four years. I love him, but forgive me for doubting his coherency on the subject. Nobody could withstand a blast that big.”
Ron followed Harry’s line of vision and a realisation seemed to dawn on him before he scoffed incedulously. “They’re just friends, Harry.”
“Seriously?” Harry squeaked incredulously, from his spot on the floor near the fireplace. “It’s freezing. Can I turn the fire on?”
“Yes, after your mother told him to, actually.” said Remus. “Snape used very bad words. He called your mother names. At first, James was just having a laugh but I think, after a while, he got protective. I think he was more doing it in the name of Lily’s honor, rather than for fun, or at least that was how he reasoned it. But he did eventually stop, and that is true. He died a good and honest man, and aside from that bullying, he put his friends and family first and that speaks volumes.”
They exchanged theories until their eyelids drooped with exhaustion. They would probably end up spending the night in the same bed, as they very frequently did, but Harry didn’t mind in the slightest. He always slept better next to Draco.
“Blaise, if you don’t butt out of my business, I’m afraid I’ll have to tell everyone in school that you sleep with a teddy bear, is that what you want?” Draco snapped.
There was an incident a few hours later which involved Harry being accosted by a dwarf of his own singing some song about his eyes being as green as a fresh pickled toad but he brushed it off in favour of Draco, who had given him a quick peck on the lips before he raced off to Quidditch practise.
“Why not?” probed Lucius, he seemed intent on figuring the boy out. “I still don’t understand why you’re here. You don’t want to give me any forgiveness or sympathy, you don’t want answers. Don’t you want to know why everyone is scared of you? Why nobody wanted to be your friend when you were little? You know, from what I hear, even Voldemort himself is afraid of you. So why don’t you want to know why?”
Blaise and Pansy were both really nice, although they did seem a little uncomfortable whenever he mentioned Draco, but Harry had come to expect that from his friends. Although, this ‘uncomfortable’ seemed to spring more from the romantic nature of their relationship, that they had displayed very openly after the Quidditch game last week, rather than the rumours surrounding Draco himself, which was refreshing, if disheartening. Harry was aware of homophobia, Vernon was incredibly offensive about the whole thing, but Harry had grown to disagree with everything his uncle stood for, so it wasn’t difficult for him to accept Remus and Sirius with open arms, and to dive head first into his relationship with Draco, whatever it was.
The silence in the room was deafening. The orb seemed to emit silence like a force field. Around the boys stood Sirius and Remus, their headmaster, Professors Snape, McGonagall and Trelawney, who each looked as white as a sheet.
But, Draco avoided his gaze for a week after that conversation, seemingly terrified to catch his eye. Harry had tried, he even downright took Draco’s face in his hands and pointed it to him, missing the molten gray he loved so very much. But the boy was still stubborn. Even Ron had noticed, he pulled Harry aside after he and Draco had filled the Gryffindors in on their most recent knowledge (Hermione had actually drooled at the sight of Harry’s book, it was rather funny).
“We don’t need to rehash what powers he has, we know them.” Sirius rubbed his temple. “So, does this mean that he’s the Heir of Slytherin?”
As the man retrieved the drinks, Sirius noticed a heavily tattooed witch in the corner of the room, hunched over a rather large wizard’s arm. It looked as though she herself was giving him a tattoo. Sirius was suddenly intrigued. He had always wanted a tattoo. Another form of rebellion he could rub in his mother’s face during the brief moments they saw each other, at Kings Cross station or in Diagon, although he didn’t quite know what he would get one of.
“Now,” James boomed, fighting past his own weepy eyes and giving a watery smile. “For the main event. Remus, you will go first. Repeat after me. I, Remus John Lupin.”
Sirius guided them to a gated park filled with hundreds of gravestones, and navigated them over to one in particular, that was engraved with the names ‘James and Lily Potter’ and the words “The last enemy that shall be defeated is death.” Despite never knowing Harry’s parents, Draco found himself mourning their deaths all the same. He looked to Harry, usually such a beacon, now dimmed slightly, his face drawn and contemplative, with dried tears leaving faint, salty marks on his cheeks. Draco knew he needed some time alone.
They were worried. What did that mean? How much did they know? Remus stayed silent, allowing his friends to reveal more information before he did anything rash.
Sirius pulled back and surveyed Harry with concerned eyes. “Yeah, this graveyard near where they used to live with you.”
“Nah, come in, Pads.”  Sirius’s strong arms wrapped around his two favourite people. “You know, Draco, you’re dad has a job now.”
“Do you know what Lucius and Narcissa’s Patronuses were?” said Draco. He seemed concerned, somehow, Remus didn’t know exactly why, but could hazard a guess.
He didn’t have long to be sad, though, as a big Quidditch game was going to be happening at Hogwarts in his honor, with the whole Weasley clan, even Bill and Charlie, whom Harry had never met, Hermione, McGonagall, and even Hagrid came down from his hut to join in the festivities, and gave Harry a strange book that tried to bite him. Some safety Aurors too, but the more the merrier.
For Parvati, it was a mummy, for Seamus, a banshee, for Dean, a severed hand. Draco tried to rack his brains for what he could be scared of most - Lucius, he reasoned. Or Voldemort. He didn't have time, however, to think about it, because the boggart had turned its attention to him, and it was worse than he could have imagined.
“Oh! Inside Chocolate Frogs you get these collectable cards!” Harry looked down and saw a withered old man with beetle black eyes and a dark beard. Underneath his picture was the name,
“Maybe more so when they find out that your son just saved the whole school because you taught him how!”
But it all came to a head on the night of his nightmare, the one about his father. It was too intense not to be real,
and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas. Flamel.” He finished with a flourish and placed the card face up on the table. Ron stared at it for a while and then looked up.
“Didn’t you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been given a free rein from the first?”
They carried on walking down the hall to Transfiguration while Remus explained gun laws to his friend, Sirius finally did stop staring at him, save for a few worried glances here and there, but he was honestly too tired to care much.
“Yes, he did, he wouldn’t stop talking about it, actually!” A light cough drew their attention to the two figures standing in the doorway of Privet Drive.  Petunia was nervously glancing at her surroundings, checking for anything remotely magical or a judgemental neighbour, but Vernon was only a pale pink on the scale of Vernon rage. For the most part, he just looked confused. As though he had expected a lot more than just a biker. Harry was tempted to tell him that it flew but decided that some surprises could wait. Sirius separated himself from Harry and approached them like an animal surveying its prey.
Draco had been touchy and sensitive all morning. Remus had tried to cheer him up with chocolate but it still seemed fruitless. Seeing their son so anxious, made Sirius and Remus anxious too, but felt that some sunshine and a good game of Quidditch would be good for all of them, so accepted McGonagall’s kind invitation.
“I’m sorry. I know it won’t help but it makes me feel calmer. It makes me feel like I understand it a little better.”
“It is dangerous, sir. Dobby is hearing about awful plan.” Sirius turned his head back to Remus, who now crouched by the chair and looked Dobby dead in his huge, glassy eyes.
There was a fight in Diagon Alley. One between Arthur Weasly and Vincent Crabbe Sr. of all people. Draco giggled at the picture of the two men at each other’s throats, being pulled apart by other shoppers, in the Daily Prophet. It was quite a ridiculous sight. Seeing the pale faces of Crabbe and Goyle in the background, completely baffled by it, was the icing on the cake.
“Oh.” Lucius gasped, the faint ghost of a smile haunting his lips. “I see.” He licked his lips with a slimy tongue, Draco sneered. “I know exactly why you’re here. Draco, my son, you have more power than any of your ancestors, you have the blood of the greatest witches and wizards in the world running through your veins, don’t fight it. Let it consume you.”
Draco watched his father fussing over them. He hoped that at some point, Remus would want to brave the horrific task of trying to find a job, but the chances of him actually getting a job were low. Also, he had enough on his plate to worry about. Still, it tortured Draco to think about his father wasting away at home on his own, day in, day out, seeing his husband off to work, cleaning the house, making dinner. None of it fit the image he had of Moony, brave, clever, educated Moony who tried his entire school life to make up for his lycanthropy, and yet he still was treated so awfully.
The teams took to the skies again, and the balls were released once more. It seemed that everything was going well, until Harry again found himself on the wrong end of a bludger.
Draco surveyed the man with a cautious eye. He was standing with his back turned to them but Draco could feel the magical eye piercing through his skull and staring directly at him. “Why do I get the feeling that he isn’t starstruck?”
“Ah.” said Remus. “Your father’s was a stag, and your mother’s was a doe. I think their Patronuses were connected somehow.”
“What are you looking for here? What do you want from me? Entertainment? Closure?” snapped Draco, eyes wild and stormy.
Draco didn’t have anything to say to that, so he didn’t. For a while. After a lot of thinking in contemplative silence, he could finally come up with something to say.
“Congratulations, Draco.” said Hermione, moving forward to hug him. Ron kept his distance but offered his commendation all the same.
. The general idea was, now that he was in Slytherin and best friends with Draco Malfoy, he was sure to become a Dark Wizard in the future, powerful enough to outdo Voldemort. Because of this, Harry and Draco were mostly left to themselves, except for a dedicated group of fellow Slytherin First Years who had made it their mission to befriend them. Draco had, at first, been irritated at the attention, knowing that it came from a place of lies, but after a scary encounter with some older Gryffindors, decided that it would be better to travel in a pack. Safety in numbers and whatever. Harry didn’t mind a bit. Fake friends were better than no friends at all, he concluded. And besides, he had a real friend: Draco.
“Alright, James, you get a lily tattoo.” he said, finally breaking the stare. “Come on, I’ll go with you.”
Sirius and Remus shared a look. “Yes, Dumbledore did tell us that had happened. He has them over there actually.” Pads gestured to the said wizard’s desk. “The Sorting Hat apparently gives weapons to true members of the founders' houses. So, Harry is a true Gryffindor, because he got the sword of Godric Gryffindor, and Draco, you are a true Slytherin, because you got the bow and arrows of Salazar Slytherin, do you see?”
But Harry didn’t give up. Far from that, actually. There was something in him, deep down in his core, his father’s voice, he told himself, that said that the map was always right. So he donned the cloak and ventured into the halls long past Draco fell asleep one night, all the while consulting the map, which showed Peter Pettigrew in one of the halls on the fifth floor.
“No, I don’t remember. Are you feeling okay, Harry? Maybe you should go see Madam Pomfrey.” Their eyes caught and, for once, Draco didn’t look away. But he did look scared, lonely somehow. Dread painting his features. But he schooled his mask neutral and held the gaze. “I’m sorry I’ve been distant this week. We both need each other, that wasn’t fair. Forgive me?”
“How dare you come in, when he is physically incapable of teaching, because of an illness inflicted on him when he was a child, and teach his students that he is a predator. He’s the best teacher we’ve ever had, and other years all feel the same.” Draco was being ruled by his adrenaline. Somewhere in him, an anger was awakening, one that he hadn’t felt since the dream all those months ago, and it was ringing in his ears. He probably couldn’t have stopped even if he wanted to.
“Oh, Harry, bless you, but that’s fine, I just need to write this letter.” She carried on scribbling until she finally sealed it and looked up to see Harry still in the doorway. “Do you want to come with me to the Owlery so I can post this, Harry? Then we can go down to breakfast.”
I hope you enjoyed this chapter, I kind of like writing jealous and angry Harry, lowkey kinda hot tho lol
“Yeah, no shit.” He wouldn’t usually swear in the presence of the headmaster, but was honestly at his wit’s end. “I am sure that Minerva will be okay with it, I’ll make the arrangements.”
- Secondly, I have cake downstairs, it's not homemade it's that colin the caterpillar cake from m&s but it's really good so if you want a slice tell me a quick story about what you'd do if you were at Hogwarts - even if you're just telling me what your favourite subject would be or what pet you'd have. I wanna hear your stories and I'll give you a metaphorical slice of cake if you do.
“Draco!” Harry breathed. “I’ve missed you so much!” They stayed together until he moved on to Remus who returned the hug wholeheartedly. Draco watched as his parents gave each other a look that signified a silent question being asked and then answered.
“‘Ello Harry, and ‘oos yer friend there?” Hagrid eyed Draco’s bright hair suspiciously and Draco looked nervous, seemingly confused at what the large man was staring at.
“Of course, and you may call me Remus.” The Minister nodded in assent and returned to ‘Professional Leader Mode’.
“He insisted, and he’s not half bad.” Draco saw his dads share a pointed look, there were many things that were being hidden away from him this Christmas. But all of his worries melted away when they were all sitting at the table, pulling crackers. They laughed and talked and raved about the food, which could rival the Hogwarts welcome feast, and finally gathered in the sitting room when they were almost too stuffed to move. Draco set about splitting the presents into piles. His was the largest, but Harry’s had a suspicious package from a mysterious person. “Did you put that in there, Pads?” said Moony.
