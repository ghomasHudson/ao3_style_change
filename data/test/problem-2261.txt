“Have you lost your mind?” Neville laughed so loud that it caused the birds walking along with us to fly away. His head thrown back and his hand residing on his chest. Harshly, I pushed his shoulder in an attempt to get him to stop. Shortly after that he started to calm down.
I was terrified that he wasn’t going to owl me. We didn’t exactly leave off on the best note. So maybe he was embarrassed he cried in front of me? Or that he opened up to me? Relatively there could've been hundreds of reasons as to why it took him so long. Hell, maybe he just wanted to keep me on edge, another one of his tricks. I can’t imagine he’d let those go as easily, it was almost like the twins giving up pranking.
As for where to meet, how would my house sound? At least here we can for sure get a seat. If not I can pick another place, and any time works for me.
“Does it really matter?”
“So what brought you back.”
He wipes the smudged makeup off his eyes before I start. “So helping us made you realize you didn't have to be what they wanted you to be?” Nodding while putting the tissue into his pocket, he grabs the book again. Flipping it open to a specific photo before pointing at himself in the picture.
“I’ll see you tomorrow then”  I can feel the embarrassing red blush on my face. Turning towards the door to try and not be later than I already am, I hear him speak again.
He chuckled, again acting as if this is just old friends reconnecting. “People here were far too afraid of the Malfoy name so soon.” Looking at me almost making sure I was listening, he continued. “Mother and Father wanted to stay here, so of course that meant I had to go, for their sake and mine truly. Staying would’ve meant their faults being my downfall, I needed to leave so I could make something of myself and prove too, well, myself that I wasn’t like any of them in the end.”
Harry set down his cup of coffee as he heard the two men coming down the stairs. From the sound of it, Sirius must have been dragging Mooney down. Harry hoped that he didn't wake either man, as the full moon negatively affected Remus. Even though Snape gave the werewolf the Wolfsbane potion, full moons could be extremely taxing for the older man. As Sirius and Remus entered the room and stat on the sofa, Harry smiled brightly at them. He had been worried when Sirius and Remus moved into the house. He knew they got along quite well, were married even, but isolation wasn't right for anyone. Much less if one was a slightly deranged run-away prisoner and the other was a chocolate addicted werewolf forced to spend full moons in a small room.
"Thank you. I hope to do business with you soon. May your gold flow and your riches multiply," rushed Harry. But when the goblin just stared at him, Harry began to worry that he said something wrong. He remembered something about that being customary to end a meeting with a goblin from his second year. But maybe he was wrong. Perhaps that was something only really old goblins used. Maybe he horribly offended the goblin. He didn't want to anger anyone, let alone the people who ran his money.

After paying his items and Sia, Harry and the Snake made their way back to the Leaky Caldron to situate the serpents living space. Harry muttering about his owl, Hogwarts, and any other important information for his new friend to know. Harry hardly registered the strange glances he got walking through the alley, he was too focused on Sia.
However, his happy state quickly came to an end as he entered into his sleeping quarters. Hedwig was stood on her perch, red howler in her beak. Harry’s mind when blank, how did someone use Hedwig to send him a letter? Did someone know were he was? he wasn’t ready to face his friends and others yet.
"Harry," Sirius gently shook the young boy out of his thoughts, "you need to tell us what you were doing. We're your guardians, your family. We care about you and want to make sure you're safe. But we can't do that if you aren't honest with us." Sirius stated with a calm voice, but Harry could tell something was wrong. Did Remus get hurt last night? Was everyone okay?
The Emerald tree boa snapped harshly. Harry already decided he didn’t much care for the mean tree boa.
"Sirius, inside voice," Remus chided absentmindedly. Glaring down at the parchment, like it personally offended him.
Harry was surprisingly good at potions. It was very similar to baking and cooking. The subject also reminded Harry of muggle chemistry, one of his favourite subjects in primary school. But he never seemed to do well in class. Slytherins kept sabotaging his attempts to make a decent potion, and he always got confused when Snape wrote something different on the board than what was in his texts. Although Snape just seemed to have it out for Harry in general, even if he understands the hatred of James Potter, it was just lousy teaching to hate a child for who their parents were.
"Ahh, thank you, I must not have been paying attention." Harry intone belatedly, realising he was being rude by just staring at his rival.
As Harry walked back to his room in the Leaky Cauldron, He was thankful he didn't have to take the Night Bus back to Surrey. His feet dragged behind him, and at one point, he stumbled into a lady coming out of Flourish and Blotts and knocked her books over. It must have been mid-afternoon, but the sun didn't seem to wake Harry up at all. He ended up at his door with no memory of how he got there. He blinked stupidly at the door before reaching for his key. Unlocking the door and stepping inside, Harry quickly changed into his night clothing. He climbed into the large, soft bed, content that he could finally fall asleep. Before he fell deep into unconsciousness, Harry remembered he forgot to ask about the creature inheritance and made a note to ask about it in their next meeting.
But tonight, was the night of his sixteenth birthday. According to his Godfather, this birthday was a crucial part of a wizard's magical career. This would be the night of this magical maturity. Sirius also let slip that the trace would disappear after he turned sixteen, although the Ministry didn't want people to know that. The magical government still wanted to maintain the trace and prevent any underage magic. But Harry didn't care about the Ministry's wishes. In fact, if he could avoid being arrested, he would do anything in his power to undermine the government. Harry lightly traced the scar on his hand in his own messy scroll. Hedwig hooted quietly in the corner. Her worried eyes fixed on his hand.
"Oh please, you two pamper the boy, he needs a firm hand. A motherly hand. You know I support your relationship with Sirius, but Harry needs a woman's touch. Men were never meant to raise children. So, Remus. Go. Get. Harry", Molly screeched in a perfect imitation of an eagle owl.
Remus cleared his throat, "Harry, how did you inherit anything from Lily? she was muggle-born."
year they would learn human transfiguration, which could permanently harm or kill the person that was transfigured. But Harry had never heard of anyone getting permanently injured in her class, perhaps, that’s why she had the lower stipulation.
"Harry… what creature inheritance did you receive?" Remus asked lightly, looking at Harry's hair, "You look terrific, don't get me wrong, but the hair… it is a particular creature that hasn't been seen in a pureblood family in centuries. And for some reason, I doubt that it's a coincidence. It's never a coincidence with you though, is it?"
Harry hissed back at the boa, defending the corn snake. All the snake heads snapped up in shock. Harry had made sure he spoke quietly so that the shop keeper could not over here them.
Harry woke up with a start as his alarm clock blared. He quickly shut it off before the noise could wake the Dursleys. He looked around his room, fishing in the back of his mind for something. There was a niggling sensation in the back of his head that something wasn't right. He swung his feet onto the cold floor and gasped. While Harry always had dark skin, the colour on his legs was a dark, healthy, golden brown. Harry quickly and quietly made his way to the bathroom down the hall to make sure nothing else had changed. He almost fainted when he saw his reflection. He looked nothing like he did before. He looked good. His eyes had changed from dull emerald green to a colour reminiscent of the Killing Curse. His almond-shaped eyes were framed with long, full eyelashes and thick eyebrows. His bone structure seemed to have changed, as well. His face had always been somewhat crooked as a result of one of Vernon's beatings when Harry was three. But now his face was almost symmetrical. His hair fell in small ringlets around his face as its usual mess, but now where once was a solid black blob, contained blood-red highlights. His skin looked healthier as well, and he looked like he had gained a couple of centimetres overnight. Although he was still skinny, it looked more like a result of a food shortage then his average weight.
"Yes, Thank you, Mr. Ragnok. Is it a possibility to resume the session at a later date? I am feeling quite drained."
Harry cleared his throat, surprised by all the land he seemed to own, “Is there any way to clean one of these properties for habitation.”
If he didn’t get the required E in History of Magic, then Harry could substitute Ancient Civilizations with a continuation of Magical Creatures. This way too he kept all the classes needed to become an Auror so Dumbledore wouldn’t be too suspicious. Although with taking the Maximum allowed classes probably did not help decrees attention. Neither would what he was about to do. While Harry had decreased talking to snakes in recent years, learning that he inherited it from his mother made him excided to talk to the animals again. And while he could now understand Hedwig and the other owls, she would have to stay in the owlery, a snake on the other hand could stay in the dorms. If they bonded enough, the Snake could even attend classes with Harry, as long as it stayed hided. With his design made Harry headed over to Magical Menagerie in order to talk to and buy a snake.
"Molly, I said I was going to let him sleep. You are welcome to stay for breakfast and tea. But if you don't want that, please leave." Remus kept his cool despite Molly's cruel words.
Remus, Sirius, and Harry had spent the rest of that day talking. Harry, for the most part expressed his concerns of going back to school and the way his friends would react. The werewolf reassured the young boy and helped make a plan with the school year to help keep Harry's new revelations away from the old coot. For the most part, Sirius muttered curses and looked ominous and brooding. Remus had said that this was just how the Animagus reacted to bad news.
"Ahh, I don't think I have seen you around here. My name is tom, let me know if you need anything" the barman called from behind the counter as Harry made his way through the crowded room.
Harry nodded slightly, still in shock at all the information he found out. How could he be so naïve? Were any of his friendships real? Could he trust his Godfather, who is his adoptive father? Harry snatched up the form to distract himself from his racing thoughts. He read through the contract carefully, according to Professor Bins, Goblins were crafty beings and will try to gain the most from any situation. As Harry finally signed the parchment, Grimhook and Ragnok entered the room.
"uh, nice to meet you Mr. Ragnok, I hope your wealth prospers." The goblin blinked at Harry in shock, "I don't believe I have any questions.”
History of Magic: E
Harry only had one day left in the Alley, but there was a lot to do. He wanted to fix up his wardrobe, cut his hair, go school shopping, and gather books on pureblood culture and creatures. The nine books given to him by Ragnok the other day would help immensely with understanding his inheritance, but he needed more information. He didn't know if it was common for each wizard to gain creature traits or if it was just the Most Ancient and Noble houses with a creature inheritance. Did Malfoy have a creature inheritance? Harry doubted it, the blond boy was prideful of his family and very loud about what great new thing had happened to him. Harry guessed it was either something one wasn't supposed to talk about, or Malfoy didn't have any creature blood. Harry was also confused about how his creature inheritance would work. Ragnok said that similar traits would combine, but each of the bloodlines would have a distinct characteristic that could be traced back to the creature.
Harry took both stones and stretched out his arms while Grimhook placed the spell in Gobbledegook, and Ragnok put the shield. The candles flickered as the magic coursed throughout Harry. His skin felt like it was peeling off the muscle. His bones seemed to bend with the force of magic. But as soon as it started, it stopped, and the magic stilled. Harry opened his eyes, not realizing he closed them during the spell. He also realized that Grimhook had left the room.
"If I looked any different, Dumbledore will know I did something very good for me, and very bad for him."
"Sorry Siri, I didn't mean to run off, I just forgot to leave a note. I didn't mean to worry you." Harry got out, smashed up against the older man's chest. Harry was slightly saddened that he had to put back on the glamour. Yesterday had been so freeing. He could just be himself, and no one looked twice at the young man roaming the Alley. But he didn't know who was at headquarters or if Dumbledore was watching the place. Harry wondered how Sirius would react to his real appearance.
Harrycrept down the stairs and passed the large portrait of Marge. When he was at Hogwarts, she had a heart attack, no wonder with the way she ate and drank. Harry was just surprised Vernon hadn't gone with her. But he was on a diet with his while of the sun in Harry's third year. A pity, really. Harry desperately wished what Sirius told him about the trace was right as he whispered "alohomora" to unlock the door. He then quickly shrunk his trunk and broom to quietly carry them upstairs and pack the rest of his books.
Harry sent both Hedwig and Sia an apologetic look before putting a silencing charm around the room and opening the letter.
"Well, I don't really know where to start. Ugh", Harry ran his hand down his face and laughed hysterically, "I guess if I wanted to be dramatic about it, I could say it started when I was born. That's when the lies started at least. But I guess that's not completely true, they didn't know who she really was. But after Voldemort attacked, everything got so much worse. And I- I was placed with them…" Remus and Sirius exchanged worried glances; Harry was never prone to rambling before. Something must be horribly wrong to cause this brake from his normal behaver.
Before Harry got too caught up in his worries, He wrote a letter to the Educational Institute of Magic in order to Schedule a History of Magic test for 9am tomorrow, he still wanted a little time to decide his classes for next year. He was lucky in one regard, if Ron and Hermione were here, they would attempt to influence his decisions. Harry didn’t know how much he could trust them. Had they been aware of what Dumbledore was doing? Were they supportive of what Dumbles was doing? Remembering all the times Ron and made Harry feel bad about how much money he had in his vault, his fame, his grades. He thought it was likely that at lest Ron knew, or someone in his family was forcing him to friends with Harry. And if Ron knew, Hermione knew. Ron didn’t keep anything from her, and if he did, she would figure it out in a matter of minutes.
It was becoming increasingly difficult for Harry to climb out of bed each morning. His feet seemed to drag, and he never could manage to stop his alarm clock before it rang. His summer holidays were the worst. But at least he wasn't under the stairs anymore. Although something about the cupboard was comforting, in the small space, he could always tell what was around him, even in the dark, there were no surprises. But Dudley's second bedroom had positives. The bed was softer, and the spiders were less prone to eat his eyes, as he feared when he was three. Harry was also quite a bit taller than when he last slept in the cupboard and didn't think he would be able to fit under the stairs anymore. While still abnormally small, Harry had grown to only slightly below the average height for a fourteen-year-old, never mind the fact he was turning sixteen in 2 hours. And even though during the summer he would regain his sickly, underweight stature, it was nothing a glamor and a year of Hogwarts food couldn't fix.
Once again Draco found himself in the unlikeliest of situations. Being seated with both Weasley and Granger and having a conversation regarding children, his potion shop, Weasley’s attempts at converting both of the other two to support the Chudley Cannons, and magical laws, in which both Draco and Granger was fiercely invested in.
“I suppose the backup would be nice.” A small grin spread across Potter’s face as he spoke, playing into Draco’s sarcasm. “And you’d be able to experience how to properly fly a broom for once.”
supposed to mean?” Ron furrowed his brows in confusion and wariness as he regarded Pansy.
Sexual scenes in this chapter
It was already mid-December, and Draco was having a mild crisis at this point. He had been exploring the few stores around the small town, trying to find something that would fit as a present.
Jumping up from the couch he ferociously pointed his finger at Potter. “I’m not in love with you!” He yelled, just as a woosh was heard and Granger stood in the living room looking utterly stunned at the both of them.
“I always thought you liked him during school.” Luna looked distracted as she reached her hand out to something that only she seemed to be able to see.
“And you left us to go around worrying about you because you were acting like a weirdo!”
“We came to the conclusion that finding a potion that could turn you two back was impossible. So, we decided to brew it ourselves!” Draco couldn’t help but feel a bit of pride at the work he and Hermione had put into this. If it did work, then they would’ve created a brand-new potion from scratch. That was pretty amazing in itself, sadly they wouldn’t be able to put it on their resume’s considering the circumstances.
“I’m just average at it, really.” Draco said, feeling slightly proud at the compliment and not being able to be overly humble about it either.
Draco sighed. He couldn’t run from his problems forever.
“That’s not fair! There’s no way you won!” Weasley groaned loudly.
“Calm down, I suffered just as much from having to interact with you.” Draco scoffed.
It was over way too quickly Draco thought, before feeling Harry’s mouth plant butterfly kisses all the way down his stomach. He felt his stomach contract at each kiss and anticipation started building as Harry got closer and closer to a place that was burning with desire to be touched.
Potter turned to look at him. His eyes scrutinizing him for a moment as it looked like he was about to say something before changing his mind. “I’m not
“Not a lot of customer on days like these” the guy said, as he took Draco’s order.
“No…” Draco sighed. “You’re a wonderful cook. The best there is.”
This prompted the redhead to release her grip on Potter and look over his shoulder. Once again, was he met with a look of utter shock from one of Potter’s friends. “Malfoy?!”
Harry chuckled as he grabbed hold of Draco’s pyjama pant and underwear, sliding it down to reveal his hard on.
“Just lean on Hermione if you need to, she will probably do her best to help.”
I can’t believe I trusted Pansy… Draco huffed, resting his head on the front desk. The first year after the grand opening of ‘Wizarding Potions’ had gone swimmingly. Pansy had worked the front desk wonderfully and customers seemed to instantly like her regardless of her name. Draco, on the other hand, had kept to the back of the shop most of the time, working on orders from customers. It had definitely helped tremendously, and the relief of getting away from the manor had brightened his mood drastically.
As Draco closed the door to his home, he sighed.
“I can’t believe you live here” Harry started inspecting the chandelier that was towering over the large dining table.
Draco glanced over at Potter who were enjoying the view with a smile on his face and various colours caressing his features, making him look even more stunning than he already was.
“ Did… did everyone get out alright?” He was just curious is all.
“That’s bloody brilliant! When are you going?”
“Come off it, Ron.” Potter sighed, gesturing for him to enter the room, as he had been standing in the doorway suspiciously looking into the back room filled with potions and cauldrons boiling. “He’s a potion master as you can see, and he’s been supplying me with various potions for a while now.”
“How strange. Now I can’t seem to get you close enough.” Harry muttered, sighing as Draco hit a sensitive spot on his neck.
After a while Draco spotted a familiar figure moving slowly close to the table.
“You know quite a lot, huh…” Draco said, a bit surprised at the knowledge of the supposed straight man.
Draco felt himself shudder as Harry started kissing his neck and collarbone. He lifted his head giving more space for Harry to explore.
“Okay” Draco said as he was shown to the bathroom and the guy hurrying off to find him some clothes.
“Thank you.” She nodded curtly before exiting the shop.
“How come you suddenly asked me now, if you’ve liked me for a while?” Draco asked between breaths.
“You think I’m so weak that it would warrant a bloody warning before-” Draco was cut short by the hex throwing him off his feet. He groaned as he hit the floor, feeling like his pride had taken most of the damage. That bloody Potter and his freakishly fast reflexes, Draco thought bitterly.
"… Remus, we're in our own house?" Sirius responded, confused.
"Of course, everything is okay" Molly snapped. "We're here to see Harry. He disappeared for a week, Lupin. The boy needs some discipline. How can the boy leave his responsibilities and disregard Dumbledore's orders? Go wake him. I need to talk to him", the women ordered.
"Yeah I go to Hogwarts, did you go to Castelobruxo, that's the only school over there right?" at Harry's nod the blond continued "I always did like the thought of their exchange program, but I think I would miss my family too much. Are you going to Hogwarts? I know certain families are refraining from sending their heirs there." Malfoy stated, giving Harry the perfect opportunity to explain his disappearance after this meeting.
"Your wand Mr. Potter, or if you don't have that blood will do fine," the goblin interrupted Harry with an eye-roll. Harry blushed slightly as he handed his wand over for examination. While the goblin looked at the wand and wrote something on a piece of parchment, Harry looked around at the other goblins. He thought he saw Griphook sitting in the corner of a desk talking to another distressed goblin.
"Well, I'm trying to convince my uncle to attend, but he is rather hesitant. See, he was never able to teach me how an heir to a family line was supposed to act in Britain. But from what he told me so far, it's fairly different than how we were supposed to act in South America. I am not an heir to the Fawley line, but I was always interested in the politics of our culture and politics. And I have a terrible sense of direction. My uncle is probably afraid that I'll get lost in Hogwarts. The war is just a little bit of an extra reason to keep me out." Harry joked.
The thin banned was a shiny silver, engraved with snakes and roses. In the middle, there was a green rectangle with the words' Si Numquam, Semper Prospera' (If you never give up, you will always succeed) written in gold lettering.
HPDM_HPDM_HPDM_HPDM_HPDM_HPDM_HPDM_HPDM_HPDM_HPDM_HPDM
"It's okay girl, we'll get out of here soon," Harry muttered lightly, "we'll get out of here as soon as we can. I don't know how or when, but we'll leave and never come back. Then you'll get to spread your wings as far as you want, perhaps we'll even get an owlery for you and any other visitors." The beautiful owl hooted and bowed her head under her wing. Harry smiled slightly at Hedwig and placed his book in the space between the floorboards. He collected his potion notes and clipped them to the book with a paperclip he found while cleaning the kitchen his first week here. Then placed the bedsheet over the small book collection to protect the books from mice or spiders and replace the floorboard to cover the area.
"Can we see what you look like?" asked Sirius gently. Harry nodded; he had already shared enough incriminating information so there wasn’t much more to hold against him. He stood up slowly and removed the glamour. Harry closed his eyes and took off his (fake) glasses, not wanting to see their reaction. He heard their gasp of shock. Harry was not ashamed of his new look, he loved the red strands of hair that connected him to his mother, but he knew he looked different and was afraid of how his godparents would react. Harry's eyes shot open at the feeling of a hand, caressing the long scare near his eyes. Sirius was standing in front of him, smiling slightly. Padfoot's eyes widened in shock as Harry opened his eyes, revealing killing curse green instead of the deep emerald.
"I still have to do some shopping for my Uncle, but it was really nice meeting you, Draco." Harry smiled kindly, keenly aware he was lying through his teeth.
As Harry climbed into bed, he placed his glasses next to the alarm clock. There was no use in staying up to worry about what was about to happen to him. Maybe nothing would happen. But again, potter luck and all that. Harry was positive; something was going to happen; he just wasn't sure what. Harry rolled over on his side facing the wall; hopefully, this wouldn't affect his sixth-year or label him as more of a freak.
Harry was looking down at Sia, talking to her in quiet tones about books and school. He was on his way to pick up his school texts and other writings on pureblood culture when he literally ran into someone. He hit a solid chest of a towering man and fell backward, hitting the pavement below him, with a hard thud. He looked up to see who he ran into. The man was at least a foot taller than Harry, well built, and as pale as a ghost. Harry trailed his eyes along the other boy's body until he reached the smirking face of Draco Malfoy.
Harry blinked in shock. His mother was a Pure-Blood and the lady to three respectable houses, although she only accepted the Potter line. “Then how do I have the Lordship of Slytherin? If it when to a different side of the family?”
"Padfoot, let's let Harry explain what happened. For some reason, I think I know where this is going, and there will be plenty of ranting to be done after we have all the information," Remus berated.
"My name is Draco, Draco Malfoy. And you are? I don't think I've seen you around here before, and I definitely would have remembered seeing a face as cute as yours." The Blond boy winked at Harry, causing his heart to stutter. Harry completely forgot he wasn't wearing the glamour. Draco didn't recognise him as Harry Potter, so perhaps he could use this to his advantage. Not to actually get to know the blond boy, obviously, but for information on pureblood culture.
Ragnok nodded, “of course lord Potter, I will send the bill to you in a couple weeks, when the Warding is done. Then of course we have a list of businesses and investments you currently have.”
"Sorry Siri, I already named her, of course, she decided on the name, but I came up with it."
"The blood wards are fine, he spent enough time there that they are stable," Remus lied, knowing full well that the wards never existed in the first place.
"ah Mr. Potter, it is quite easy, as the inheritance test already proved you have qualified for each position, you are to place the family ring on each finger, starting with your left hand to your right hand. You will go in order from Most Ancient and Noble to the Potter line as listed on your test." The goblin Stated as he pulled nine boxes out of a desk drawer with the houses' crests on them.
Once again he had to drag me out of my thoughts, only this time was to throw one of the tea packets I left on the table from last night for him, square in my face, successfully knocking my glasses off. Carefully, I grabbed the warm cup of tea I made along with my coffee, the statis charm still keeping it almost steaming. Making eye contact with his still oh so Slytherin glare, I held the cup out to him.
I waited til everyone left, which wasn’t too long. Ginny and Luna decided to go back to their flat shortly after the whole owl incident,considering Luna was already in and out of consciousness. The twins went with, saying they were getting a new shipment of something, I really don’t want to know what, for a new product early and wanted to be awake for it. Fred held the door open after he shrunk their chest, while George helped direct Ginny through the door. She decided that she needed to carry Luna out to not wake her.
“Ignore me, continue” His laugh rings out as I roughly push the chair out of my way without remembering he was watching.
“Potter, it’s been years since we’ve been to Hogwarts and you assume I was saying you were better than me with academics?” Now that I think about it, why would that be what he was talking about? It was common knowledge that he was the top of every class.
“I hate to leave, but I’ve got to go. She invited me to a muggle movie and I don’t want to be late.” So the movie probably started in three hours then.
“Does it really matter?” Ron said, obviously mocking me. He jumps out of his seat to stand right in front of me, his drink disregarded. “Of course it matters!”
“I’m free tomorrow for dinner?” Came his surprisingly happy response.
“The storm that has been going on for the past two or so hours?” I asked once again and almost immediately as I finished the question his head sunk low from its fake confidence position down to one of pure shame. Taking a deep breath and rubbing his face with his hands he spoke.
Until an owl landed at my window. Pulling us both out of whatever we were stuck in. His hand finally grabbed the cup and took it out of mine. Quickly, he backed up a few steps away from me. Looking at the tea for a minute before drinking it, his eyes closing and both hands coming up to rest on the cup, the same way he drank it last night.
“Sorry guys, I’m just not up for it today.” Finishing it off with another fake cough and a nod I attempted to close the door, before Hermione's foot got caught in the way.
“Informed me about what?” I reply quickly. Nobody has mentioned Malfoy since the one-year vigil we held for the war. It was me, wondering why he didn’t show up. In all fairness not everyone did, people grief differently I suppose.
“We were accquatices back at school” He started as his laughter died down “She didn’t quite believe I was who I said I was, she was right but it was still annoying” Picking up the happy owl he continued. “She helped me during the war, more so how to get out after it all went down. Stayed with her for a bit after so I wouldn’t be stuck at the manor.” Sipping the tea once again as the owl burrowed into his neck.
Slowly I see Draco pull something out of his jacket. Noticing quickly that it looks like a book I start to wonder who would bring a book to, well, whatever this is considered. He very quickly flips through the pages before handing it to me. On the outside it just looks like a basic book you’d see in a shop. Opening it I realized it was so much more.
Draco Malfoy.
“She looks nice.”
He walked over to the couch, owl still burrowing into him before he continued. “I didn’t notice til we were older, but she has quite the inkling of helping broken things.”
I read over the letter a few times before deciding it would do, rolling it up and tying it, I laid it next to my bedside. I’ll let his owl take it in the morning, don’t think I’ll be able to forget that. The clock read 2:47 am, so I took my glasses off and laid down, thoughts of the walk racing through my head before I finally drift off.
“But why?” Dean asked, almost sounding annoyed.
“Its not”
He did call me Harry when he left didn’t he? How did I only just realize this?
I’m sorry this letter was later than the last, I’m afraid I was called away on business shortly after our walk. You’d be shocked how quickly you must move in the potions business. I do hope this finds you at a somewhat reasonable hour, but knowing my owl I will be sorely mistaken. Acts like a child really, does what he wants when he wants without my supervision.
“Draco Malfoy.” Gasps came from all around the room. Murmurs from Ginny barely resonated in my head. The sheer fact that he actually wrote to me all I could think of. His reasoning makes much more sense than ignoring me. He’s the one who started all of this, he’s the one who wanted this, right?
“Neville said it was his girlfriends owl an-”
“Thanks.” I nodded back as he took another sip of his drink. Someone came out and placed what I’m presuming to be my drink.
Neville was already sitting at the table when I walked up. Still, I was ten minutes early, but he’d obviously already been here for a bit. Thankfully, he’d decided on an outside seating since nobody else was around. He was anxiously tapping his foot against the concrete, quietly sipping his drink. Knowing him, it was probably hot chocolate.
“So your name is Francis?” The owl fluttered its wings while looking at me.
The moment he saw me he started waving, very enthusiastically, as normal. Chuckling at him, I went to go take my seat across the small table from him. It was a bit chilly out so he was very bundled up, unlike myself who forgot to look at what the weather was before I left. The obviously old gryffindor scarf stood out against his black coat jacket thing, it looked like one of those fancy ones that felt way heavier than it looked.
“Did she tell you what was stolen?” Neville asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I told you to plan this so that would be fine.” Draco spits out, rather fast. Hands clenched at his sides once again. The loose shirt he was wearing showed his breathing had quickened.
Hope you all enjoyed it! I have ideas for the next chapter along with a new drabble series I started! Also, Francis is my what if Hogwarts pet, and I do keep writing myself as Neville's girlfriend, it helps me with wanting to write and an easier way of backstory since this is my first and longest fanfic
“It’s alright if you do.” Ron said, bringing me out of my thoughts. “Might not really get it myself but to each their own.” Tightening his hand once again before handing me the water to drink.
“I guess, I don’t know if he’ll tell me.”
“What the hell are you looking at Potter?” Draco practically growled at me, shaking me out of my daydream where he was still lying down. Now, I can’t recall when he's sitting up, the blanket I gently placed over him earlier this morning being tugged up against his chest as if he was shirtless. That’s when I see the glare, the same smug yet anger filled look he would give me, or really any Gryffindor when they got something right that he got wrong. This Draco resembles Hogwarts and childish rivalry.
“I’ll have to tell Mrs. Weasley how much you love her blanket.” Draco looked up at me stunned for a moment, before looking down at the blanket he had been attached to all morning and noticing her signature ‘W’ on one of the corners. Slowly, as if it’d burn, he ran his thumb over it cautiously a few times before looking at me.
“I would enjoy that.”
He owled me early in the morning. Giving me directions to a Muggle place right outside of London. Telling me to dress casual and be there by seven. Expecting to have to go spend too much on a fancy robe, this was a nice difference. Whether he’s doing it for himself or because he’s more comfortable who knows.
“Well obviously.” Hedwig landing by me, nipping me in the finger. Draco suppresses a laugh as I retract my hand and shake it as if it would get the bite off.
“Ron, I read the letter. I know what it says, that doesn’t help.”
I don’t think he would. Maybe I used to, but just seeing him again seemed to change everything. I stopped thinking of him as Malfoy which is still quite terrifying. The name just doesn’t seem to fit him anymore. Back in school, it made sense, he was supposed to be just like his father, so calling him by his last name was just the best way of going about things. Yet, how I saw him yesterday changed things; instead of being a mini replica of his father, he looked more like a man his father would despise. Ron told me that’s probably one of the reasons he changed so much about himself, I’d believe it, he already said he left because of the stigma. So if he changed everything about himself with that in mind, it’d make sense.
“Seems like you were too,” I respond as Hedwig flies off.
“Thank you.”
“They’re friends” An exaggerated nod and a very unsuccessfully held back laugh was how Neville responded. Throwing his cup away in the bin on the side of the road. As he came back to walk next to me he grabbed a muggle phone out of his pocket only to shove it in my direction, the screen was covered in what looked to be a very long message.
“Do you hear yourself Harry?”
“The birds sound quite lovely don’t they?” Draco said, suddenly pulling me into reality. I hadn’t even heard the birds at first, but now I hear them all around us. Almost as if they were surrounding us, yet they were nowhere to be seen.
The volume on my television was barely covering the claps of thunder that seemed to occur every few minutes. At one point I can hardly remember I stopped trying to out sound it or whatever you want to call it and just laid on the couch, turning the television off and throwing a pillow over my head in hopes of possibly tuning it out at one point in the near future.
“Do you maybe want to watch another?”
“Yes.”
“Well they're basically just moving pictures but with noise and anywhere from an hour to 3 hours long, not much.” He seemed to let out a breath of relief at that, a smile creeping onto his face. Almost as if he was nodding to himself, he let himself relax into the couch before looking at me with a raised eyebrow.
After a few moments, I realize I don’t own anything to put these in. So I head over to the parchment I have waiting by the window to write a letter to Neville, asking if I can borrow one of his pots whenever he gets it.
Nobody said anything. Everyone was conflicted. Some of us managed to forgive people quicker than others. Death eaters and the War were never really brought up anymore, so I can imagine some people weren’t particularly happy with tonight's events.
His hands had a tight hold on the flowers previously shoved into my face, fingers rhythmically tapping against the tightly packed stems. Looking at them closer I could see they were roses, some in the bold red you normally see on the muggle romance holiday, while others held the green that Draco himself dawned every day back at school. They were seemingly placed together carefully, almost showing a pattern within the petals.
“Where did you ask him to meet?” His voice being weirdly high pitched, obviously trying to seem like a gossiping teenager.
“You don’t know?” He whispered, keeping his eyes on mine. I feel my breathing speed up as he questions me with his eyes.
“Well let’s see” Reaching out for the disgraded letter. Quickly he reads it over before speaking up again. “Right here, he says he wants you to pick a place where you don’t fumble your words.”
“Dear Draco,
Walking back to the kitchen I grabbed the snacks I had gotten, along with the tea kettle and every type of tea I could find at the muggle shop. Laying it all down on the coffee table, Draco looked up at me bewildered before looking back at all of it. Running back over to the bar, I grabbed a mug for him to use and placed it in front of him, nodding at the kettle.
`The owl Draco said he’d send didn’t come until late that night, I had just gotten back from a mandatory dinner with the Weasleys when I noticed it land. I was grabbing the parchment before I’d even realized I had moved. The jacket I was taking off landed somewhere out of my path.
“At least drinks, snacks depending on how long the movie is.” He was still skipping over cracks in the ground, only less enthusiastic atm. Once he stopped skipping he checked his watch before looking back at me. “You’ve got this Harry, even if you think you don’t.” Patting my back in a gentle and friend type manner.
Pages from the muggle magazines everywhere, some ripped to shreds, others just thrown haphazardly. Bowls and silverware scattered across the floor of the kitchen, thankfully nothing was in them. The roll of paper towels was now completely unrolled and wrapped around practically everything above a certain height. Candy wrappers from last night now out of the trash and piling up beside it.
“I hope this isn’t a bother but I was wondering if I could come in.” He spoke up after a moment of me just staring at him, looking up at me as he did so. Silently I moved out of the way of the door, opening my arm to allow him inside, not really caring about the inevitable water he was tracking into the house.
I hadn’t seen him for years. Back then he was all sharp edges, with pristine clothing and not one hair out of line. I couldn’t stand him, his words just as sharp as his appearance. Ron and Hermione agreed every time I would complain about anything involving him. During the war he changed; he seemed to be losing his sharp exterior as if he was fighting himself. He proved me right when he fought alongside us in the end. I never managed to thank him, seemingly just having disappeared.
Luna had shown up late, mumbling something about her earrings not wanting to work, still haven’t got the slightest clue what she meant by that seeing as she was wearing earrings. She’d brought Ginny with her, who was also mumbling about quidditch. The both of them and their constant mumbling, if you;d ask them to elaborate they’d act as if they didn’t say anything. They had taken up comfort on the stairs, then the floor, then the guest room, and quite honestly the farthest they could get from the twins that my house would allow. Over the years Ginny slowly started getting annoyed by their pranks, preferring to be able to ride her broom during practice than have it explode ink into her face the moment she got off the ground. I believe she regrets telling them that she’d test some of their products, none of them specified when and where. Half way through the night Luna had fallen asleep on Ginny so Hermione had to help keep the twins away, one of the few things she can’t really do.
Sighing I put it back down where it was. Moving over to the blanket on the back of the couch and reaching to refold.
I attached it to hedwig and let her fly out the window, while Draco’s owl rested on the windowsill, his head lazily attempting to nuzzle into the treat bag, going as far as to rip the bag further with his beak so he wouldn’t have to move to eat any of the treats. I could feel my eyes roll as I watched him for a moment before heading up to take the shower the letter stopped me from doing when I returned home.
“That is not what I meant and you know it.” He chuckles at me. Turning to look at me he smiles.
“Reminded me of Lovegood, only she made more sense, most of the time.” Tying the paper to Hedwig I nod at him to continue. “She also had a small muggle flag in the shop, one of those Pride things I believe they’re called?  It read very open-mindedly, you’d be comfortable there I feel.”
“I haven’t said a single word”
I'm sorry if there was a rushed moment, I learned that Chadwick Boseman passed as I was writing this so there may be a bit of a rushed part. It was very sad and I was a very big fan of his over the years, may he rest in power.
It took another twenty five minutes before Seamus and Dean decided to leave, not like it was two in the morning or anything. They hadn’t even gotten up from the chair all evening. Both sorta just yawned and waved before leaving, no words were spoken.
Pressing play on the remote I was luckily able to skip through the ads on this one. This particular movie played quite loud so I turned the volume down as  I sunk into the couch. Spelling the lights even darker as to match the time, I decided to close my eyes, not expecting to be as tired as I was.
“Um-I well,” His hand reached up to comb through it for probably the millionth time tonight. “Yes, I did.” Looking away from his hair I noticed he wasn’t looking at me, rather he was looking at the ground, cheeks flushed.
I would just like to thank everyone for actually liking my writing. I struggle a lot with it for some reason. I wasn't planning on writing more but I had people ask on Tumblr so this is a bit of a filler since I have a limited time to write due to parents being a bit too nosy. Also, I won't be really describing other relationships (like Ron & Hermione) just cause everyone has their own headcanons so I feel y'all should be able to enjoy this with your own imagination as well. I also won't describe Harry or Hermione in much physical description so you can decide if you want the actor portrayal or the POC portrayal. I like to think reading should involve some of your own creativity so it's your story as well as mine. Personally I go between both so even if I wrote them I don't think I could chose
“Pretty sure I didn’t do anything to bring you back Malfoy” Realizing just after it came out that it made me sound as if I didn’t want him back. Wait, do I actually want him back here?
“I took a job in France shortly after it ended” Oh, well that makes a bit more sense.
“How do you figure?” I asked, trying to keep him talking for as long as possible so he doesn’t notice the struggle I’m having with the shrunken vase.
“Maybe just think about it? Things like this take time.” Swiftly he pointed to the clock on the wall. “And hate to break it to you, but it looks like he’ll be here soon.”
“You haven't,” He said back, the smirk on his face saying more than enough. So the wink he attempted to add was practically useless.
Thank you for reading! I'm sorry it's so short but I felt if I put the change in a bigger chapter it'd feel rushed. I know the restaurant date was a cute idea but it was making me not want to write. I wasn't thinking when I wrote about it originally, but I have very bad anxiety when it comes to eating around people so the idea of writing that was unmotivating and nauseated imagining it. I hope them talking on a walk will be okay with you all! I'm brainstorming ideas for what exactly they'll talk about, but I imagine some of it will be about the war so beware. Thank you again for reading and I'll try to not make the wait so long again but I'm also trying to draw (at the same @ on insta) so I'm trying!
“So who’s owl is it?” He asked as I grabbed the envelope from the little owl, the thing was staring up at me in complete wonder for some reason. Opening it I heard a clinking noise, looking down I’d noticed a small, almost toy like container had fallen out. Reading the paper as I picked it up.
As he still remained shocked I made my way to the television and put in a random disk I didn’t even bother looking at. Quickly it started showing up on the screen so I walked over to the couch, taking my spot I had the previous time.
“It would if you’d really pay attention to it.” He leans over pointing exactly to the line he spoke about. “He’s obviously telling you to pick somewhere you feel comfortable.” Emphasizing the ‘you’. Mumbling something about obliviousness he goes to put the letter back down.
I back away from him to go head over to the kitchen in an attempt to get something to put the flowers into. His eyes following me as he stands there.
“Got about twenty more of those, apparently he was very talkative after your ‘hangout’” He smirked once again, pulling his phone away from me and tucking it back in his pocket. The look on my face must have been abnormal because the face Neville made was one of pure joy. “I can’t tell you what he said” A slight chuckle escaped him as I felt my face fall, the hope of knowing what Draco said fading away. Neville patted my shoulder as a look that looked too similar to pity came onto his face.
“I’ll owl you, really, you need to go so Granger doesn’t send the entire ministry after me.” This time I laugh. Nodding at him I start to walk towards the apparition point. Looking back right before I go I see him looking right back at me, he waves with a smile before heading towards the brightly lit street.
“So let me guess, marble floors and chandeliers?”  The sarcasm evident in my voice, finishing up the letter as I whistle to Hedwig to come down from her perch.
Just as I go to speak, Neville does it for me.
I pick back up the quill.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What did he say?” Neville asked, leaning against the wall.
“Who are you writing to?” Draco finally speaks up, his voice soft and faint.
“Smart” Chuckling at me, he went to take a sip of his drink again before getting out of his chair, originally at me to follow. “Do you know what you’re going to do when he’s there?” Getting out of my own seat to follow him, I shook my head in response. I’d really only focused on getting the letter to him, not what was going to follow.
I'm alive, and here's a short update. Long story short a lot of shit has happened but I'm getting better and trying to get back into things I enjoy :)
Looking around I noticed how everything was that way. The couch and chairs are perfectly aligned with one another, all in line with the tv, as I tested them last night so wherever he wants to sit he can be comfortable. Blankets scattered about, folded in line and put in various spots in case he gets cold he won't have to awkwardly get up. And the thermostat, which I tested in four different length shirts so I knew what to change it to depending on what he showed up wearing.
“Thank you, for the tea, and the uh, the blanket” Draco said ever so quietly, looking back at the couch for a moment before looking down at the tea again.
Apparently I had haphazardly and on complete accident chosen a documentary on muggle space studies. I could not be bothered to pay attention, but Draco’s eyes had been glued to the screen the entire time. Every time a rocket took off his head moved to follow it from the ground up, even going as far as leaning into the screen to watch it closely.
“So where should I ask him to meet?” I ask him, since he’s suddenly Mr. All knowing.
“Granger have you on a schedule I see.” Smiling at me again he lets go of my hand before walking away.
Getting back to what Draco said, that part still freaks me out. What do I want to know? What did I actually think I would gain from this? “I know you said you left because of the stigma around your family, but why did that scare you?” He looks at me startled, like that wasn’t the question he expected me to ask.
He’s no longer sharp, that's easy to tell. His hair reaching past his shoulders in waves. The muggle shirt falling slightly off his shoulder showing he’s still pale as the day he left. Somehow his skin managed to look more like Ron’s, freckles popping up where they were once hidden.
“Do tell her that when you see her next.” He rushed out as he struggled to get his jacket on by my door. Noticing my look of confusion he spoke again. “I didn’t expect to stay over, I have a meeting with the Minister in ten minute and all my work is at home.” Finally pulling his arm through the sleeve. “I’m terribly sorry I have to leave so rushed.”
Harry James Potter’
“I detest storms” It was barely a whisper, but somehow I could hear it over all the outside noise.
“Perfectly clear Ron” I say as I start to stand up, my hands going numb at this point. He sighs as he sees me get up, footsteps starting to follow me as I walk to go grab a drink.
Deciding that they were just going to barge the door down if I didn’t open it, there was no choice but to get up. Slowly, as if he was made of glass, I lifted Draco's head off my chest and set to move it onto the edge of the couch so as to not disrupt his sleep. Closing my eyes for a moment to let myself take in the feel of his hair on my fingers, somehow the softness of his hair was almost enough to make me forget the nagging coming from the other side of my door. Almost.
“Why?”
“Worth a shot” Ron laughed, patting my back before walking back into the main area. Neville getting up too.
“Harry.” His voice gets quieter as he speaks. Taking a deep breath he looks back up at me. “Do you think it's possible you, um, well. Fuck alright.” He stands up quickly, putting his hands on my shoulder before continuing. Taking a breath to fix his words. “Is it possible you have some sort of romantic interest in Draco?”
“It’s been a while Potter.” He says calmly. Almost as if he was seeing an old friend. We never were friends, hell, I called him my Arch enemy more times than I can count. I almost expected him to hex me the moment he saw me. Yet he’s smiling softly at me, which I didn’t even think was possible.
After everything happened we all tried to move on. Everyone had their own way of dealing with it all. A lot of people took to the ministry, determined to change it and continue fighting. Hermione took up a position to fight for the rights of house-elves and squibs, though now I really never know what she's talking about. Ron joined the twins in their shop, he became in charge of their non-prank items, which I see as fitting.
“Oh, it just looked like you didn’t recognize the owl is all.” Draco said looking at the tiny fellow, before looking at the shrunk vase in my fingers. “And why is it so tiny?” Continuing to read the letter for a moment, Draco got up. Walking over towards me, I thought he was going to rip the letter out of my hand when he instead went to go pet the owl.  “I thought I recognized you buddy” he whispered as he went to hold the owl, who then started flapping his wings and screeching in what seemed as excitement.
“I’m sorry, I guess teaching has really gotten to my head. Please, continue with your answer.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We’ve been waiting just as long as you, we want to know what he has to say for himself.” Neville was now in the seat Ron was. Looking between Ron and I before Ron seemingly continued his thought.
“Sorry I had to rush, or if I overstayed my visit it was not my intention. I hope you’re well and that Franics didn’t rip anything of yours. Forgive me for the short owl but I don’t quite know what else to say. I hope you’re well and I’m truly sorry if what happened crossed the line, it was purely accidental.
“Yes, got caught in the storm.” He said, mimicking my neck rubbing movement.
“You fell asleep, figured you might need it” He nodded as a response, sipping the tea once again. The silence was just beginning to fall again as we were reminded of the owl that has dragged us out of it. Realizing my own cup was empty I decided to go check the unfamiliar owl. Draco went back to the couch as I did so, once again grabbing the blanket and tugging it around himself as he settled back into the spot he silently claimed as his last night.
I hope you all liked this! I'll post part 2 soon.  This was my longest chapter and I hope I can get more with this length.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco wakes up, and I write myself into the story more to help him open up a bit more to Harry and give Neville content
“If you’re okay with staying late then sure” I speak up, still staring into his eyes. They fill with more wonder as he starts to get excited before quickie catching himself and just smiling. His eyes though, they show the sheer happiness he feels at that news. Nodding to me he resumes his spot, only this time I notice, is a bit closer to me than last.
“You can sit down wherever you want.” I yell to him as I start opening cupboards looking for a vase or something. “I’m just trying to find something for these and I’ll be right there.” As no response came I looked back towards the living room to find him sitting down, finally. His choice being on the far end of the couch.
“That’s insane” He barely gets out, his breathing heavy with laughter.
Also the unnamed Ravenclaw? Will remain unnamed because she is me. This isn't self insert thing I just need this for my sanity so I don't write a whole fanfic for myself :)
Ron is helping Harry before Draco comes over. I think he does more than he was meaning to (1651 words)
According to Neville I never seem to think into people outside of what they show me. He brought that up just before the year ended. Saying I should try and understand my students better so I know exactly how to help them. And maybe he is right, Ron says I’m oblivious half the time. So maybe that’s why I don’t understand any of this, maybe I just struggle with understanding people and not just thinking about what they show me. Did I just take Draco for what he showed to the world and not what he kept hidden? I mean, he did help us in the end, that couldn’t have been a sudden idea, he had to have planned on betraying Voldemort. What if this Draco was there the whole time, but was hidden? And the man he showed was the one who was misguided and destined to lose in the end?
It took a bit of time unrolling it, the man had decided to add a weirdly shaped wax stamp to the front of it which would not break. It took everything in me to not rip the paper apart.
I'm sure many of you are aware of the recent events on Twitter, and I'm sure you, like me, have a lot of conflicted thoughts and feelings about Harry Potter and JKR after her disgusting show of bigoted transphobia. It's going to take me some time to reconcile what kind of place HP has in my life going forward. I don't want to support or be associated with such hateful views, mainly because I am a part of the community she is insulting with her ignorance and bigotry. However, the Potter fandom has brought me so much comfort growing up and has been nothing but kind and accepting and open to all people, that I don't think it's right to let one woman's views bring it down. I will be finishing this fic, rest assured. However, I probably won't be writing future fics in the HP fandom. If you agree with JKR's views statements, stop reading now, because this fic is going to be queer as hell and include trans characters. I don't have time for anyone who doesn't accept that trans women are women, trans men are men, and nonbinary people are nonbinary, and all people are people, and this place takes everyone, not just cis/het people. This fic is a place of love for everyone.
"Ahh, Mr. Potter, I hear you have quite the problem. Ragnok and I have decided to provide this service free of charge, provided that you take up the lordships upon our closure here?" the head goblin stated proudly.
"a snake? What's their name? OHHHH, can I give a suggestion? What about Snakespear?" Sirius perked up.
Harry knew that that fiasco could have gone horribly had the Headmaster not shown up in time to dual Bellatrix Lestrange and save Sirius. Harry could have become genuinely alone. Siri had claimed in the aftermath that he wouldn't have blamed Harry if he died and that he was acting just like his father. Although, Harry suspected that didn't comfort him as much as Sirius thought it would.
The pet shop was dark, musty, and very humid. Harry walked to the back of the shop where there were four snakes, acorn snake, barred grass snake,emerald tree boa, and rainbow boa. They were situated on one long shelf, with only one, rather large light source above the four cages. It seemed this area of the shop hadn’t been visited in a while. There was a thick layer of dust everywhere. This was not an environment where snakes would be happy.
“Any questions? The goblins of course will continue to grow these assets, but if you are finished, we will move on to your vaults,” with Harry’s nod, Ragnok continued, “I have compiled a list of monetary values of each vault. The artefacts are not listed, however are apprized.”
"But why didn't Petunia know? She was the oldest sister? And if Dumbledore knew then the so-called blood protection you've been receiving from staying with then is worthless", Remus furrowed his eyebrows.
Harry then turned to get dressed in his single pair of casual robes as not many people would be out this early on a Saturday. He places his wand in the red and gold wand holder attached to his thigh. Harry then shrunk and cleaned Hedwig's cage to store it with his other belongings. Harry placed his firebolt in a small storage compartment in is trunk rapped with one of Dudley's old shirts so it wouldn't be damaged. After everything was packed away, Harry cleaned to the bedroom to make it look he was never there. Then he took out his money pouch and shrunk the trunk and place both items in his back pocket.
The alley was packed. There were more Hogwarts students milling around the stores. The Alley was much brighter then yesterday, filled with students and family’s exited chatter. Harry managed to slip past the crowned unnoticed and into the pet shop. While his representation in the media has improved, Fudge’s smear campaign last year destroyed his reputation. Now even strangers were throwing jeers at him and asking if he raised Voldemort to get more attention. Although, that made no sense, but Harry noticed the Wizarding population wasn’t very good with critical thinking.
"Hadrian Fawley, but please Hadrian will work just fine." Harry smiled at Vale as Ironwood nodded and walked back to the front counter.
"Oh, thanks, Sirius, but I already ate," Harry stated, smiling fondly at the older man.
"Harry, hush pup, why don't you start with what you found out?" Remus soothed gently. Harry nodded in agreement, taking a deep breath to settle himself.
"No, I actually wanted to grab the texts if my uncle decided that I could go to school. If I have the book, then he can't use that as an excuse." Harry lied easily.
On another note, the next chapter will be a tad long then the others so it might be published a little late. But no later then Tuesday. Thanks everyone for reading!
"Well, I can show you around the Alley if you want, there should be a couple Books in Flourish and Blotts about Wizarding Britain's culture and such. We can even get ice-cream if you like, Florean Fotescue's has any flavour you could imagine." Draco stated hesitantly
The timer jolted him out of his reading. Harry had been immersed in the Goblin Rebellion of 1612; he never knew that the Three Broomsticks was used as the Wizard headquarters for the rebellion. Although Harry felt bad for the goblin nation. The Wizarding world seemed quite prejudice against any creature in the magical world. Harry thought this was quite idiotic, as wizards in other countries were allied with dark creatures, and it seemed most pure bloods cared dark creature inheritances as well, if is Black inheritance was any representation.
"Um, where was I?" Harry blushed, "Oh, yes, I woke up, and everything was different. But not soon after, I received a letter from Gringotts inviting me to a meeting with my account manager in the afternoon. My relatives have this rule that if I leave their house to enter any part of the magical world, I can't go back to them. So, I had to sneak out of Privet Drive and planned to stay in Diagon Alley for the remainder of the summer. But when I got to Gringotts… well here", Harry handed his inheritance test to Remus.
“Lord Potter, your identification please.” The old goblin said as Harry handed over his wand. “Yes, all seems to be in order, first hall on your left and last door on your right, Lord Potter.”
Molly Weasley, Ron, Ginny, and Hermione were standing at the front door. Ginny was wearing a garish pink dress that was entirely too short for her to be wearing in front of her mother. But Molly seemed okay with it, so Harry didn't really care about what she wore, besides the colour. It was horribly pink, like Umbridge's wardrobe, and not very pleasant. On the other hand, Ron looked like he just rolled out of bed, hair sticking every which way and in an old shirt that had a large dozen holes littering the faded lion design. Hermione stood next to Ron, whispering in his ear. Harry couldn't make out what she said, but it probably wasn't pleasant from the look on Ron's face.
The Night Bus seamed to sway side to side with the fast movement of the driver, Ernie, if Harry remembered correctly. Before they reached Diagon Alley and the bus almost hit an old lady and several animals. As a result, Harry was extremely thankful to leave the bus when they reached the alley. As Harry entered the Leaky Cauldron, he didn't receive a second glance from any of the patrons and quickly reserved a room for the entirety of August. He had a whole month to do whatever he wanted! As he walked up to his room, Harry imagined all the things he could do here. Maybe he could get his vision fixed or study for potions and prove Snape wrong about his skills in the class. Harry's thoughts slipped to his slimy professor as he started to unpack his trunk.
“Yes, well you vanquished the Dark Lord, who was responsible for many deaths and a couple extinctions of families. The Most Ancient and Noble families, however, have a stipulation that whoever killed the cause of the family’s extinction the vanquisher shall be inducted into the family in order to keep the family alive and thriving. Hufflepuff was one such family. As for the conquest or conquered, it is a bit more complicated. You see Marope Gaunt had an older brother who received the lordship, had when he passed the ring was lost, however the lordship passed to Marope’s son, who actually claimed it, although not at Gringotts. it seems that you defeated this man, the lordship then passed to the stronger of you, making you lord Gaunt.”
Harry rolled over in bed to face something tapping at his window. He slowly opened his eyes to stare at the interruption. A giant eagle owl was tapping at his window unpassionately, holding a large envelope in its beak. Harry quickly rushed out of bed and went to the window. Letting the bird in, Harry gently took the letter from its grasp to read.
"Of course, Mr. Potter, may I see the test in order to explain the premise better?" asked the goblin a bit too kindly. But Harry passed over the parchment and waited for Ragnok to read his results. At first, his white eyebrows shot up in surprise. Then his face quickly drained of colour as he finished reading the test. "Mr. Potter, I must apologize, but I cannot do business with you until these blocks and potions are removed as there are affecting your mental state, and I fear you are unable to make appropriate decisions at this time. However, I can remove the spells and potions from your system, but I will need to contact Grimhook."
screamed Sirius making Harry keenly aware of his banshee blood, “I SWEAR  TO MERLIN- HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING. THERE IS A MAD MAN AFTER YOUR HEAD. AND YOU THINK IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO LEAVE YOUR RELATIVES WITHOUT TELLING ME! I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE ANNOYING, BUT HARRY THIS IS WAR. THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS THEN OUR PRIDE. I SWEAR TO SALAZAR THAT IF YOU ARE HURT, I WILL KILL WHATEVER DARED TO HURT MY GODSON, AND YOU YOUNG MAN. YOU BETTER OWL ME AND REMUS ASAP MISTER OR WE ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS. HOW DARE YOU LEAVE YOUR HOME AND NOT TELL ANYONE WHERE YOUR GOING. YOU DID NOT EVEN COME HERE! HOW WERE REMUS AND I SUPPOSED TO KNOW YOU WERE SAFE. IF IT WASN’T FOR THE WARDS ON NUMBER FOUR TELLING US YOU LEFT WILLINGLY, WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WERE KIDNAPPED! HOW CAN I DO MY JOB AS YOUR GODPARENT IF YOU DON’T TRUST ME., I’M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU HARRY. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AFTER LAST YEAR YOU WOULD HAVE REALISED THE IMPORTANCE OF TALKING TO ME BEFORE DOING SOMETHING RECKLESS. IF YOU ARE NOT HERE IN TWO DAYS YOUNG MAN, I WILL TELL PROFESSER MCGONAGALLTO REVOKE YOUR PERMISSION TO GO TO HOGSMADE- AND I WILL TAKE YOUR INVISIBILITY  CLOAK. THREE DAYS HARRY. YOU HAVE BEEN MISSING FOR THREE DAYS. NO LETTER. NO NOTHING. NO HEY SIRIUS I AM FINE I JUST NEEDED TO DO SOME STUFF WITHOUT MY RELATIVES BRETHING DOWN MY NECK.

FUCK THE MINISTRY, I WILL DRAG YOU HOME MYSELF.”
"Hadrian James Potter get your arse in here right this second," Sirius hissed lowly. Harry stepped into the house quickly, hunching his shoulders slightly. The older man seemed to eye Harry quizzically before nodding and encasing him in the tightest hug the boy had ever experienced. "Oh, Merlin Harry, I was so worried. Dumbledore just sent a letter that you'd run off and no one could find you. Never do that to me again. You hear me, young man? Never again." Sirius whispered into Harry's Hair.

Harry hardly debated what he was going to tell them. Last night, after mulling it over, he had decided what to say to them. However, he had to research and practice specific spells to make sure everything would be fine. After all, if Dumbledore found the spells were broken, he could reinstitute them, kidnap Him, or something way worse. Harry quietly looked around the room, pretending to mull it over, while he was actually wandlessly placing protection, eavesdropping spells, and finding any unwanted charms that could threaten his secrets and redirect them to a different part of the house. He didn't want to break them encase Dumbledore, or someone noticed that their magic had been tampered with.
Harry needed to find a concealing charm for the rings. He did not want Dumbledore to find out Harry had claimed his lordships, or how many there were. What Harry had found out yesterday was horrendous. The Headmaster had placed a block on his magic, his heritage, and then forced him into participating in horrible challenges. Harry thought it was to much of a coincidence that Hagrid had picked up the Flamel’s Stone, the day he picked up Harry. But why didn’t Dumbledore wanted the stone sooner, no he had to have it Harry’s first year to test the “boy who lived” or the restrictions on his magic.
Harry had just finished the test. The administrators told him that he should get his results back in a couple hours by owl. Unfortunately, he hadn’t seen Hedwig since the day prior. During the Holidays the snowy owl was the only friend he had and right now the only being he trusted completely. Ron and Hermione could know what Dumbledore was up to, and so could Remus and Sirius. Harry sat on his bed and put his head in his hands. There was a very probable chance everyone Harry thought he could trust lied to him. But Harry didn’t want to think about that, instead he moved to deciding his class registration. While he didn’t have his results back yet, he could decide his other classes. Harry thought he should at least take a lot of classes because he had no clue what he wanted to do. So, he came up with a rough list that was dependent upon his scores.
"Yeah, don't worry, I got to choose my classes. That's actually why I was in the Alley for a couple of extra days. I had a medical disturbance during the History of Magic test and couldn't finish it. I then had to study and take the test to choose my classes. After that, I finished my school shopping." Remus looked somewhat appeased. "And uh, I may or may not have gotten a snake." Harry rushed.
"Uh, yes, thank you, sir," Harry replied nervously as the goblin lead him to a side corridor off of the main hall. Turning to the last door on the left side, the goblin stated, "This is where I leave you, Mr. Potter. Your account manager is within."
Harry looked over to the clock on the side of the bed. The bus trip and unpacking must have been longer than he thought because it was almost time for his meeting with the potter account manager. Harry had just enough time to eat and rush to the bank. He quietly exited his room and locked the door behind him. Checking his pockets for his wand, letter, and money pouch, Harry went down the stairs to the central area of the building to order some lunch. He had forgotten to steal and apple for breakfast and had not been allowed to eat since breakfast yesterday. Harry had decided a light soup would be the best to ease his stomach into consistent meals. He learned after the feast in the first year that gorging himself on food would not make his stomach happy. Instead, he spent the entire night spewing sick into the toilet. Luckily the other boys did not notice his predicament.
After seeing Snape's memories, Harry couldn't help but wonder who his father was. How could someone so mean become a great man? James Potter acted like Dudley or Malfoy. It was disgusting, and it was disturbing. Harry couldn't help but fear he was becoming just like his father. After all the comments Snape and Sirius made, although quite different in tone, Harry was worried. What if he treated Malfoy the same way or even any of the other Slytherins?
"This summer was great. I was allowed to be out of the house. There were no other…Issues that caused it to be bad. Until my birthday. I had no idea what was going to happen. Sirius briefly mentioned something about my sixteenth and how he was excited about my birthday. But that was the only warning I got- "Harry was cut off abruptly by Siri's shout of rage.
“Lord Potter,”
Then the letter ripped itself to shreds and set itself on fire in the still silence of the room. Harry was in shock, it never occurred to him to let Sirius know that he was okay or what he was doing. Now that he looked back, Harry couldn’t imagine what it would look like to Sirius. Merlin, Sirius probably thought Harry had ran away from everyone. Harry Quickly penned a letter to his godparent, letting him know that he left to do some business with Gringotts, that he had to take the History of Magic test and needed to spend a few days in Diagon alley but would be at Grimuld Place in a few days. He felt guilty about making the old man worry. He truly didn’t think to let anyone know where he was.
Harry gathered his notes and shoved them haphazardly into his book bag. He had a bad feeling that keeping Ragnok waiting would not end well for him. He rushed through the alley, pushing through crowds of people, as it had grown much busier in the last six hours. It also seemed like there were more Hogwarts students milling around, harry round recognized a third year Slytherin and a couple fifth year Hufflepuffs in the pet shop next to him. Perhaps Harry should get a snake? Before Hogwarts, Harry used to talk to snakes for hours while in the garden. They were very honest beings, however, extremely defensive. But they were very nice to talk to once you gained their trust, they were quite friendly.
Harry hissed back charmingly.
Even the thought of trickle tart had his mouth-watering. Harry wasn't allowed to eat much with the Dursleys. He wasn't allowed to do very much of anything with the Dursleys. They were awful, horrible, abusive, arses. Never in a million years would Harry wilfully submit himself to the treatment of these muggles. He wasn't a bigoted blood purity fanatic, but he knew that if Malfoy were to meet the Dursleys, he would have all the reason to hate muggles. Harry himself felt his skin inch whenever he was forced to spend time in this merlin-forsaken house. However, Harry knew that his mother had given her life to protect him, and in order to keep this protection, he needed to stay in this house. But the way Dumbledore had said it made Harry wonder. He said as long as he called this shite-hole
Harry suddenly remembered the note Ragnok gave him. He turned to the nightstand where he left it the night before.
"Oh, really what? Ravenclaw? I think that I'm not quite cut out for that house", Harry joked back.
"Oh," Harry didn't know what to say, he always thought it was weird Hermione and Ron were so much more prepared for the school term then he was. Still, he only thought it was because Harry himself wasn't very studious. Now that he thought about it, he never saw Ron or Hermione receive their letters, and Harry was with them on both of their birthdays. "Well, that explains why the dates were off on mine then."
"So, I heard you found the boy?" Molly sneered at Remus, who Harry just noticed, was leaning against the wall.
Sia hissed in his ear, causing Harry to smile.
"did you at least get to choose your classes for this year, there your NEWTs classes after all. If Dumbledore fucked this up to, Godric have mercy on him…" Remus started,
"Harry," whispered Remus, "Merlin, never disappear like that again, or we'll lock you up in here like Rapunzel" Sirius and Harry gave a small snort at the comment. But Harry smiled a bit sadly at the werewolf. There was a new scar on his face. It was still red but looked a month or two old. Magical scars were interesting like that. The injury could be years or decades old, but the lines still red and fresh looking. Because Remus was a werewolf, self-induced injuries would look a lot brighter for only a couple months before fading slightly, while Harry's scare had never faded, and presumably never would.
"I hope your wealth prospers, as well, Mr. Potter." Ragnok stated unusually kindly for a goblin, "as for the inheritance test, you will drop a small portion of your blood, a drop at most, onto an enchanted piece of parchment paper. This paper then compiles a List of lordships, creature inheritance, inherited magical abilities, legal guardians, age, name, and many magic or potions you are currently under, along with any contracts. This then helps the bank to file the proper paperwork and allow you access to vaults that need the family's signatures. Which leads me to this," Ragnok pulled a blank sheet of parchment from the clean desk and slid it across the table, then place a small dagger onto it. "should you wish to complete an inheritance test today, you will need to place a droplet of blood on this piece of parchment, thus, allowing the magic to analyse your genetic data."
"Here, this is the book my father had me read when I became the Malfoy heir and suspected Black heir. Although I was later denied as the Black heir. Apparently, Sirius Black was never completely disinherited from the family", Draco stated without any hint of anger. Harry, however, was reeling. Draco Malfoy was picking out books for him without any complaint. He was babbling about almost everything on his mind.
The next chapter will be a tad long then the others so it might be published a little late. But no later then Tuesday. Thanks everyone for reading!
"NO ONE TOLD YOU ANYTHING! NO ONE. HARRY THEY, WE- MOST WIZARDS HAVE YEARS OF PREPARATION! THEY KNOW WHATS-" Sirius's banshee screeches were cut off into a low whisper. "Dear Godric, I'm so sorry, Harry, we were supposed to tell you everything. If I wouldn't have gone after Peter. We shouldn't have assumed Dumbledore told you about any of it. With my Banshee blood and James's Vampiric blood, that could be a nasty mix for inheritances. But why didn't Dumbledore tell you, as a magical guardian, it's his job to instruct you and prepare you for your sixteenth?" Sirius trailed off thoughtfully.
"Well, hello, young sir. This is Foundation: Magical Solon and Spa, here to serve your beauty needs. My name is Violet Ironwood, what may I do for you today?" The young woman, Violet, stated politely eyes Harry's hair warily.
"We know something happened, Harry. You disappeared for a week, no note, no nothing, then show up here looking like you've seen a bogart. With the addition of someone simultaneously kicking Hedwig," Remus stated, seeing the mulish look on Harry's face, "Now spill."
Last year had gotten bad. He still had scars on his back that dully ached when playing quidditch or when in the garden. No matter what he did, Harry never could forget the look on Vernon's face after the dementor attack. He was almost purple with rage. That night was the worst Harry had ever had. At least when Voldemort returned, Harry managed to escape relatively unharmed. But that night, Harry had felt excruciating, rhythmic, endless pain. The blood on his back seemed to be a never-ending stream of red running down his spine. His face swelled to the size of a watermelon, and Harry looked more like a blueberry than a person. After that night, He was banned from doing any outside work, and Vernon replaced the bars on the window. Harry had spent the rest of the two weeks locked in his room, starving and buried in his school texts.
Harry shook his head to dislodge these thoughts, he needed to study for the History of Magic O.W.L and he only has six hours till his meeting with Ragnok. Harry still had most of the study materials in his trunk, luckily, he hadn’t gotten to cleaning out his trunk in a while. He turned back to the bed, where is trunk was laying at its base, and opened the lid to rummage around where he could remember throwing his books. Pulling out his old History of Magic books and the study guide Hermione had forced Ron and him to follow, he placed the papers and notes in his bookbag to study at Florean Fotescue’s Ice-Cream Parlour. In the Morning the ice-cream store served coffee, hot chocolate, and, of course, ice-cream. He also heard the store never closed, so there wouldn’t be a lot of people there and he could fuel up on coffee for the long day ahead of him.
The corn snake responded sadly.
“Come in, Lord Potter” hissed the goblin through the door.
"Ah, yes, you must be Mr. Potter. I am Ragnok, the head account manager for the Potter family and associates and have been for four decades. Today we are to do an inheritance test to decipher the lordships you are to accept. Then we will review your properties, stocks, and businesses should you wish to accept your lordships. Finally, we will discuss your vault situation should there be multiple. Any questions?" the goblin, Ragnok, stated primly.
"I don't think either of them knew. My mothers' parents were expecting a child, but the baby didn't survive. I think they decided to adopt it immediately after. There were no magical records of the adoption. So, unless Dumbledore dug into muggle records, he wouldn't know."
"Yes, I think this one would work great," Harry told the clerk, who rushed to bag up the items and sent Harry on his way.
"Fine, but you should at least let Ron, Hermione, and Ginny stay, it's no good to isolate the boy." Molly berated.
"I'm aware of what he did, Siri, but we can't scream about it at the top of our lungs. People could be watching".
As he entered the bank, he walked up to the goblin that escorted him to Ragnok’s office yesterday. Harry cleared his throat, “Excuse me, I have a meeting with my account manager, Ragnok.”
“Of course, many people think that wearing glasses makes them look smarter, but they don’t want to deal with putting them on each morning. Here I have the potion in the back room, I’ll take your glasses and change them out, it should only be a minute or so” The old man stumbled to the room directly behind the front desk.
They made small talk as Draco showed Harry every corner of the Alley, muttering of their reputation, their affiliations with individual families, and how much he liked the shops. On the other hand, Harry was learning so much he didn't know the wizarding world had. There were junk shops, Malfoy thought they were rather gross and undignified, divination shops, home appliances, camping, art, and almost anything else Harry could imagine. The Alley was like a muggle shopping centre, but he thought it best not to mention that to Draco. Finally, they arrived at a book shop Harry had never been to before.
“Now, each family has multiple account managers, however it is Gringotts’s policy that there is only one head account manager for each patron, I can send a list of your current Head Managers to choose from, however the founders accounts have been sealed and, thus don’t have an account manager. Additionally, the you will have to discuss a new contract, including payment and powers the Head manager will have over your account. So, fare I am acting as the Top account manager as you were born a Potter. However, if you wish to change this, you can.” Ragnok stated, it seemed he was rather reluctant to give Harry the ability to change but was obligated to.
Harry decided that it was probably not a good idea to irritate his godfather any more than he already had. He wondered into the kitchen, being careful to not wake Lady Black and the other portraits. Sure, enough, there was a plate of around 20 muffins sitting on the counter along with butter, cups, coffee, sugar, cream, small plates, and silverware. Harry elected to bring the food and utensils out to the sitting room at set up a small dining area on the coffee table. He set two plates close to the sofa and placed his on the opposite side. He then poured himself a cup of black coffee as he sat on the floor. Sirius had been right when he said the Muffins were tasty. Harry had missed house-elf cooking, or maybe just home cooking in general, not that he ever had home cooking before.
Setting up his study area in the very back corner of the shop, Harry noticed there wasn’t anyone else there, just as he predicted. Harry took a sip of coffee then set the old, damaged wristwatch timer for 11:45, to give him time to pack up and run to Gringotts. The Watch used to be Dudley’s, but as always, it was broken within a few days of him receiving it. But, Harry had fixed it up so he could know when to start cooking if he was working in the garden. He turned back to his History notes, Harry whished he was studying History for fun instead of potions when he was at his relatives.
After the shower I laid down in my bed, my mind was filled with what happened. Having him that close to me, that comfortable, changed something inside of me, I just don’t know what. I thought back to the letter and- I told him I keep my windows unlocked, who does that?
But it’s Draco Malfoy, the Draco Malfoy.
It was just becoming dark as we started to walk away from the restaurant. At first, we just walked alongside one another. The street got quieter as we walked, not really knowing where we were going. He didn’t seem to want to say anything, or rather, didn’t know what to say first. I don’t either if I’m honest, what do you say in this situation? What really was there to say?
“What don’t I get?” He asks back, sounding a bit angry. The familiar strain in his voice from the last time we got in an argument. I still think he fucked with my broom no matter how much he swears he hadn’t. There's no way it would just randomly become covered in fire ants.
“I’ll owl you. Okay?” He said as he was opening the door, I nodded which caused a small smile to show on his face. “Watch that owl by the way, he’s extremely spoiled he’ll scream for attention” The owl chirped to prove Draco’s point. Chuckling he waved goodbye as he was walking out the door. “See you later Harry.” He said as he walked down the steps, the owl started to screech and he stopped and chuckled. “Goodbye Francis.” The owl chirped and got silent as Draco appeared away.
“You honestly think we believe that?” She said, faking her own cough with a deathly glare boring its way into my head. Ron puffed his chest out and nodded behind her, trying to cover up that he believed me. “Just tell us the truth and we’ll see if it's good enough” Ron leaned over to whisper something in her ear, probably how they were already late for the game since it caused her to smack his arm. Turning her gaze back on me as Ron rubbed his arm while rolling his eyes. Crossing her arms and starting to tap the same foot she lodged in my doorway as time went on.
Draco owls Harry, finally, but his owl really could've picked a better time.
“Oh, I-um, Neville” I stutter out, speaking and writing at the same time not a talent of mine.
“Why what?” I say back as I start pouring myself a drink to calm my nerves.
“Believe it or not Potter, you.” That smile, something I never thought him to be capable of. Never really thought him to be capable of anything besides mocking or fear. But that smile, it’s almost memorizing, just barely making his eyes do that wrinkle thing everyone says means it's genuine. It’s just shy of perfect.
Harry and Neville hanging out and Harry is getting advice.
He tails off as he sees me walking towards the couch, sitting on the opposite end as him. Quickly fixing his posture he looks at me, his hand impulsively going to fix his hair again. Silence filled the room as we just sat looking at one another.
I hope you’re doing good too. I don’t know exactly what happened but don’t blame yourself, no line was crossed, if there even is a line. I’ve yet to see Mrs. Weasley to tell her about the blanket but I will soon, if you can find something else to say, my window is always unlocked for owls.
I'll try to get the next chapter out asap but I am going to try and update my other stories first, but I am putting this above drawing atm since I find this more enjoyable recently so it'll hopefully be soon. I already have the main idea and it's going to be awkward and confused harry like we all love
Nothing was said, an awkward silence filled the room for the first time since he arrived. The cup was starting to burn my hand as we just stared at one another, as if trying to study the others next move. We were good at that. Draco had always been predictable to me, his next move, next hex, or his next verbal jab, I had always been able to predict him.
-------------
A day later it started to storm, so I actually had to close my windows. The thunder shook the house and almost knocked over the vase I still need to return to Neville. The red and green flowers placed gently into it had started to droop, the petals turning dark and curled. I hadn’t gotten rid of them yet, not knowing when would be the right time or if their death fit better with everything.
On the inside were various photos from our teenage years. Shots of him catching the snitch while playing against Hufflepuff. Pictures of him and his entourage in the dorms. Every so often there would be a random picture of the lake, or a scenic shot of the castle. It was almost showing how much everything changed throughout the years. Each year seemed to be separated by a Malfoy family portrait. As the years progressed his smile faded, there were less pictures with others and more of just the scenery around the castle. His smile wasn’t the same one I’ve seen recently. In the older photos it seemed more smug, almost venomous. The smile I’ve seen on him recently is a softer, genuine look to it. Honestly, it is hard to believe I’m looking at the same person. “Why are you showing me this?” I ask him.
It’s not like him laying on my chest meant anything to him, or even me, maybe. Hell, I still don’t quite understand what happened, or how it happened, but it did. The image of him lying on me was engraved in my brain, it was all I could when I fell asleep after it all happened.
“Why does everything have to be perfect?”
“So it went well?” Neville spoke up after walking beside me in silence for a few minutes, the cup of hot chocolate in his hand almost empty at the silence.
Draco was just standing there, clothing soaked from the constant rain. His hair was going every possible way, the wind blowing it as such. A few stray pieces had stuck to his forehead, soaked with the rain.
"Surely you're not this naïve. If Dumbledore is willing to do that to a child, he definitively put tracking and spying charms all over this house." Remus rolled his eyes and started to take out his wand to remove any spells in the house.
Smiling at me he nodded. I can handle a movie, movie and drinks, or snacks. I got this.
“That is exactly what I said Ron.” His laugh gets louder and I can feel my nails digging into my palm.
“You look great okay?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m just saying, everythings a possibility.” His voice cracked with laughter as he said so, quick breaths coming through his nose. He put his hand on my own shoulder this time, shoving me but not as harsh as I did to him. “But hey, if you just wanna have a nice, friendly, night with him, just watch a movie.” Friendly was emphasized. All they do is mock me, every single one of my friends, mock me, for no reason.
“It’s okay.” Ron speaks up after a while.
“You’ve also done that three times now.”  He said as he walked over to me, snatching the blanket out of my hand. Then lazily throwing it on the armrest so it looked like a bunched up mess. He smirked at me while taking a drink right after, watching me reach to fix the blanket.
This is very short but I felt like making this part its own chapter would help with the small change I'm adding
As not to ruin this closeness, I spell the movie out and replace it with a random one Neville had lent me when I flooed him in a panic the night before. He’d laughed at me while handing me a box of the things and saying “Any of them will be fine, nothing too over the top”
Update time! (1059 words)
I'm sorry this took so long and its not exactly what y'all might want. I used to write late at night (Around 1-3am) but with school, I have to go to sleep around midnight so I can actually focus. I'm working on doing things in between or directly after classes.
“Simple, where do you feel most comfortable?”
I unraveled the parchment slower than I walked over here.
“Well of course I do.” I hesitate before I continue. “I still don’t understand why this would answer my question.”
“Ah, yes. Well, obviously I didn’t mean you were better than me in the sense of marks. But as a person, you had me beat. You did everything you could to win a war you didn’t even want to fight. It was obvious, in the end, that you wanted it all to be over, you could see it in your eyes. I wanted it to be over too, helping you helped myself.” He pointed to a bench by a small pond, “Would you like to go sit with me, so we don’t have the possibility of getting hit by a car?” I nodded and we started to head over that way.
“Harry, do you think you like him?”
Draco Malfoy was asleep. On my chest. In my living room.
“Oh!” I say quickly as I remembered I didn’t respond. “It looks nice!” I could feel my face heating up as he glances up at me, the nervous smile changing to something more genuine, those little wrinkles around the eyes showing through. His cheeks gaining more color as his fingers grip on the stems even harder than before.
Ever so gently he stretched his hand out to my face, using a single finger to tilt me towards the screen. It took a moment for my eyes to leave his, my sleep riddled brain not caring about the possible embarrassment. Once my focus turned towards the screen, I saw a purely black screen and that’s when I realized there was no sound besides the calming storm outside. I sat back in shock as soon as it hit my brain, a slight chuckle leaving Draco’s lips.
After hours of talking, Sirius had led Harry to his bedroom for the next few weeks. It was a different one then he had used last time. Ron and the Weasleys were not projected to stay here this summer. So, Sirius and Remus had set up a room just for Harry. The room was large, with a canopy bed set in the middle of the floor. Harry had felt touched that the men had set this up for him, there was even a couple quidditch magazines set on a side table and a new perch for Hedwig. Remus had set up a space for Sia as well. He never had his own space. In the cupboard he had to store the cleaning supplies and other things, the bedroom he was allowed to stay in was always Dudley's second bedroom. At Hogwarts, he shared a room with the other Gryffindor boys in his year. So, when Harry's head hit the pillow, he was out like a light despite sleeping in a new place.
"I thought you said you weren't going to Hogwarts, Hadrian? Is your uncle making you follow the curriculum by yourself? Cause then you should come to Hogwarts anyway the teachers explain the texts really well.” Draco spoke, startling Harry out of his depressive thoughts of the rest of the summer.
"I, Sirius Orion Lupin-Black, swear on my magic to abstain from any communication involving the subject Hadrian Potter unless given permission to do so," Sirius responded immediately and looked at Remus expectantly.
Harry nodded slightly and took the dagger. He made a small cut on the tip of his index finger and pressed it against the parchment. Immediately words seam to spring from his finger. Harry snatched up the parchment to read:
"Actually, she wasn't. My mother was a pure-blood witch that granddaughter of Marope Gaunt and her husband, the heir of Ravenclaw. Lily was adopted by a muggle family after her mother died."
"Harry," Sirius gasped lightly, "you look so much like your mother, now you even partially got her hair, you look good, Harry. No need to be embarrassed."
This place was nice, small but very homely. It reminded Harry of a muggle barber shop he had been in when Vernon had to get his hair cut and didn’t trust Harry by himself after his first letter for Hogwarts arrived. he wondered if there was a magical hair place around here. Harry loved the new highlights in his hair, but he hadn’t had a proper haircut in a couple years. He saw a couple muggle boys with his completion having relatively styled hair. True his current dreadlocks would never be as styles as aunt Petunia wished, but maybe he could give it the more intentional look.
Harry kneeled to open the loose floorboard and take out the small stash of books. If he was going to leave today, he needed to leave before anyone could stop him. Aunt Petunia always seemed to get up at the break of dawn to make sure Harry couldn't steal any food while making breakfast. As a result, Harry only had thirty minutes to break into the cupboard under the stairs and pack all his belongings. Luckily, Harry had managed to sneak his wand away from the cupboard when he stole the books and parchment.
"Hadrian, Hadrian Fawley," Harry said the blond, "I just moved here to the UK. My uncle and I used to live in the Americas for a while. But he wanted to come back here for work. When we lived in South America, he always forced me to be friends with the local British children. Still, he never taught me much about Wizarding Britain. Do you go to Hogwarts then? That's the Magical school here, correct?" Harry tried to make himself as unimposing and open as possible to relax the other boy.
"Oh, thank Merlin, that would be amazing. I'm going to be completely honest here I have been completely lost for the past couple minutes. This Alley is so confusing." Harry gushed, a little too relieved. However, Draco didn't seem to notice to busy laughing at Hadrian's ability to navigate a straight line.
"I"M GOING TO KILL THAT CONNIVING SON OF A BITCH! HOW DARE HE MESS WITH MY GODSON", Sirius screeched, shocking Harry out of his thoughts.
Harry could have sworn the requirement for potions was an O. While most of the professors at Hogwarts accepted an E, Snape had higher expectations then most. When Harry had first heard this, he thought Snape was just being unusually hard on students, this thought was only furthered by Ron’s snide remarks after the meetings with Ms. McGonagall. But now Harry thought he understood why it was necessary to get an O. Potions is a very dangerous subject, one wrong move and the room could explode, it was delicate art. It would be very bad if Ron or Seamus were to be in advanced potions, the entire castle would explode.However, this made Harry wonder why Ms. McGonagall didn’t require an O. as fare as Harry New, in 7
Harry shook his head slightly to dislodge these thoughts. It was only an hour to midnight, and he had an early morning. Every morning was early, and every night was late. The first weeks of the Summer holidays always determined Harry's schedule for the rest of the time with his relatives. Wake up at 5, sneak into the kitchen for a small, unnoticeable amount of food, clean the bottom floor of the house, make breakfast, clean the bedrooms while the Dursleys are eating, do yard work, make lunch, clean the bathrooms, steal an apple from the tree in Mis. Figs garden, continue yard work, make dinner, clean the kitchen, wait for Vernon to stop yelling at him, clean the cars, clean the gardening tools, do the dishes, go to his room, and study from the books he stole from his old home, and repeat. Very steady, monotonous work. But Harry could be thankful Vernon hadn't hit him yet.
“ahh, that’s rather unexpected, usually a family’s inheritance is a deeply personal matter, your magical garden should have explained it before your 16
that he would be protected. Harry certainly did not consider this devils trap home. Nor these people family. Dumbledore also seemed to forget Lord Voldemort shared Harry's blood.
He had completely forgotten there were other things to discuss with Ragnok, the test had blindsided him. Now that he thought of it, wasn’t lily a muggle-born witch? How could Harry have inherited anything from her? Let alone the lordships of Slytherin, Fawley, and Ravenclaw? Or a dragonkin inheritance, whatever that was? He needed to do research, perhaps the goblins had an evens family tree? But he would have to go to Flourish and Blotts to grab the information on his creature inheritances. Oh merlin, would Harry turn into a werewolf, would he need to be locked up in the Shrieking Shack? But he was only around, 25% werewolf so he wasn’t quite sure what would happen.
Harry cleared his through to get the old man’s attention as he stepped through the red door, “Excuse me Sir, I was wondering if I could get a new prescription for my glasses.”
"No, it’s not your fault at all. I just lost track of time."
Turning to the door, Harry steeled himself for whatever was about to happen. The niggling sensation from this morning hadn't dissipated, and Harry had the feeling he was about to find out why. He opened the door and entered into a small, stone room with a large desk in the middle of the chamber. There were no windows in the room resulting in the chamber being dark and damp, lit only by four candles floating above the desk. Harry sat in the chair closest to the door, opposite an old goblin, and cleared his throat to get the goblin's attention.
"Name and identification, please," the goblin drawled.
As Harry walked through the main room of the Leaky Caldron, he grabbed an apple as it was still too early for ice-cream. There was only one man that Harry thought looked somewhat familiar from his Third year spent in the alley. The man didn’t spare him a second glance as Harry moved passed him to the doorway. When he entered the alley, Harry noticed that it seemed a lot different then yesterday. While still bright and cheerful, there were less people, the atmosphere was more reserved, and it seemed less hopeful. Harry thought that it was probably the combination of war and the early hour. It was around Five in the morning after all. Harry quickly made his way to Florean Fotescue’s and ordered a large, Black coffee. He didn’t like sugar with it, when he was living with the Dursleys Harry would steel small amounts of coffee after Vernon’s morning cup but couldn’t risk the sugar. He supposed he probably developed a taste for black coffee as a result, but whenever he had coffee at Hogwarts Ron would give him a funny look, so Harry mostly just had hot chocolate instead.
"Oh, and this one on our Culture and political duties of an heir, oh here, this one will help as well." Draco continued to pull book after booking off the shelf to place in Harry's arms, explaining how they helped him and what they were about. By the time Draco stopped ransacking the shelves, Harry had a pile of about 20 books, only slipping in a couple about his creature inheritances.
"I think this third one would work well," Harry said, pointing to the middle image.
He waited for the two men to finish reading the parchment and thought back to how they reacted to his news. They seemed to be accepting what he had to say at face value. But he didn't understand why they thought Dumbledore was his Magical Guardian. Didn't his parents ask before assigning Remus the duty? From what Ragnok said, the task was one of the most important parts of raising a magical child. It was tradition to host a ceremony, after the guardian accepted, to announce it to the world. Ragnok had explained that it used to be an announcement of allying families and showcasing the trust between them but now was used as an opportunity to celebrate friendship. With the first wizarding war, his parents probably skipped the ceremony, but did they give Remus this responsibility without asking or telling him? If so, his parents weren't the people he thought they were. Or at least his mother wasn't. Harry still wasn't sure what to think of his father.
"I'M WHAT? Dumbledore…. Oh", Remus stated sadly.
the corn snake hissed, her voice remined Harry of the mothers he saw on Platform 9¾ saying goodbye to their children.
"NO," Harry stopped him, if that man were to attempt to check the charms they would snap back into place and be worse than if they were active the entire conversation. "I um already checked for spells and moved them, so they listened and reported on other parts of the house. I didn't want Dumbledore to know someone discovered his wards if he blamed it on you", Harry stated, embarrassed of his sudden outburst. Remus just nodded and then stood up.
"Yes, I quite agree. What do I need to do to accept my lordships?" Harry stated. Today did not go the way he thought it would.
Harry paused for a minute and re-read the letter. It seemed as though his letter had gotten delayed. There was no way they expected Harry to make his class registration in two days. But what really confirmed the delay was the quidditch captaincy. Obviously, the letter was supposed to reach him before yesterday. Perhaps the owl had gotten lost on its way to find him because he wasn’t staying with the Dursleys anymore. But Harry suspected that was not what happened. Hedwig had never gotten lost on her way to find Sirius under the Fidelius Charm, and Harry had never even used Siri’s real name. Why was his letter late? Did someone tamper with it? Before Harry started to spiral, he decided he should read the rest of the letter. After all Hermione made both Ron and he study till their brains were going to explode with information. Smiling sadly, Harry looked over his O.W.L results.
"Of course, Mr. Fawley, I have a couple options for you here," Vale states as she waved her wand across the mirror to show three images. The first two were longer then harry wanted, but the last one reminded him of a couple boys he had seen walking past number four, while he was in the garden. The sides of the head were saved close to the skelp. However, the top of the head still had longer hair that curled artfully on one side.

"What can I do for you today, Mr. Fawley. I overheard your brothers played a rather nasty prank on you."
As they walked into the kitchen, Harry ran back into his room, not wanting to get caught by any of the children and forced to spend time with their insufferable mother. Harry couldn't believe that woman. How dare she? Molly Weasley was not nor ever would be something Harry needed in his life. Remus and Sirius were the best guardians he could ever have. They weren't irrationally angry, they didn't use him, they weren't Dumbledore's lapdogs. Harry only hoped that it was the Weasley matriarch that had such deplorable manors and intentions. Honestly, she calls herself his mother figure.
Harry looked in the mirror for a long time. He didn't want to glamour his hair, but then Dumbledore would realize something had changed and look for more discrepancies. He supposed his unglamoured face was different enough from his public persona that hardly anyone would recognise him. However, he would have to glamour his lightning scar and the clothing. The scar was one of his most identifiable features, and the clothes made him look like a small rat. Harry changed the shirt to be a smaller, white dress shirt with no holes. He also shrunk the jeans and corrected the colour. He then put his hair up with one of aunt Petunia's hair ties to hide the uneven cut. While it still looked terrible, his hair didn't look like ruminates from a fight with a chainsaw and an angry pixy. Harry allowed Sia to rest on his shoulders. He was planning to fix his hair before clothes shopping, so he didn't look completely lost, so she would have to move in a bit. Harry schooled his expression as he walked down the stairs, he was incredibly worried that someone would recognize him. Then Dumbledore would find out Harry broke the binding.
"Harry, you look the same?" Interrupted Remus this time, confused
“Yes, of course young lad, please follow me, my names Alore Ovira, owner of this shop. If you sit here” He said leading Harry to and old red, barber-shop style chair. “Now, I have to ask, do you consent to a scan of your eyes, it will only be a medical scan of them” Harry nodded, “Fantastic, please remove those glasses.” The old man waved his wand in Harry’s face, a bit to close then strictly necessary, and a soft yellow glow spotted Harry’s vision. “ah yes, I’m sorry young lad but it seems your vision is significantly worse than the prescription in these muggle glasses. I can replace them if you want or I can fix your vision. However, fixing your vision will cost twenty galleons as a posed to the 3 galleons and 2 Sickles for changing the prescription.”
"Fine, but Dumbledore asked us to bring Harry back to his relatives, first thing in the morning. They're worried sick about him. After all, how would you feel if the boy you raised ran away without explanation?" the Old woman bit back spitefully, clearly playing what she thought was her trump card.
Ragnok stared in shock of only a second, “that’s rather unexpected… However, are there any other questions you wish to ask?”
"Hello, what can I do for you today, sir?" the Storekeeper stated happily from behind a glass case containing an arrangement of necklaces.
“Well, the son never claimed the lordship and never had any male children to claim the lordship. Thus, the lordship of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Slytherin has been waiting from a male child to be born in the family, regardless of which side.” Ragnok hissed. He was clearly not happy about the son never taking the responsibility he was given.
Harry looked over to the alarm clock, only 30mins left. He wondered if his magic maturity would hurt. Sirius hadn't gone into too much detail, assuming Harry already knew what was about to happen. Harry hated not knowing what was happening. His aunt used to scold him regularly about his questions. she constantly repeated, "curiosity killed the cat, or in this case killed the freak."
"Now we have to remove all the spells on your person, and brew the antidote, Siriu- " Harry cut the older man off again, "no, no, there already removed, that's part of why it took so long. The first night in the Alley, I had to get all these removed. The goblins checked to make sure I was not in danger of harming myself or others and that I was stable. But I felt like I was going to pass out. Like my magic had been drained but also was bursting out of it seems. I couldn't finish the meeting. So, we had to schedule a second one for the next day."
Harry was quite happy with how his hair turned out. The top was long enough to put in a bun while he played quidditch. Violet had made sure that he looked good, despite having to lengthen several strands. Harry also had finished clothes shopping, getting an arrangement of Green, purple, navy, black, and white dress shirts and casual wear. Harry thought he looked quite nice. He had decided to change into a pair of black slacks and a dark bottle green dress shirt with a small silver wristwatch and black dress shoes. It was nearing the middle of the afternoon. The hair cut alone had taken well over two hours, and clothes shopping had taken even longer. Harry discovered he like shopping for himself, while there was a twinge of guilt at the amount a galleons it cost, he loved picking out new sets of clothing and shoes.
"oh, of course, Mr. Potter, Grimhook and I have decided that it would be in the banks best interest if we were to finish the business dealings tomorrow, while still dealing with the issue of lordships today."
Harry sighed in relief, “yes, I was under the impression that Lily Evens was a muggle born witch. How could I have inherited anything from her?”
Harry stood there, staring at his reflection and was jolted out of his glazed state when he heard the sound of his alarm. He must have only hit snooze. He hurried to Dudley's second bedroom and shut off the alarm. But a soon as the clock stopped blaring, Harry could hear a small rapping coming from his window. Wondering who sent him a letter, as his friends had warned him that they wouldn't be able to send anything to him, Harry crossed the room and opened the window. In stepped a stately Great Grey Owl, who proudly stuck its leg out for Harry to take the white envelope. The way the bird acted reminded him of Malfoy. As the bird flew out the open window, Harry turned over the letter to open the envelope and noticed the golden Gringotts crest.
"Very well then, please sign this form to allow me to release the information on your inheritance test to Grimhook while I summon him and inform him of the situation."
