“There...there is something I want to talk to you about,” Draco said for maybe the first time in his life, fidgeting in his seat.
With the help of some unexpected friends, Draco enters the Ministry to view his parents’ trial.
“How have you been, Draco?” She asked after a moment.
The driver handed Draco his rolling trunk and made a hasty exit, giving Draco a minute to orient himself. He had a reflexive fear of this house despite the recent improvements. His stomach turned and he for a moment thought he would be ill right in the rose bush. Thankfully he regained control, because one of the front doors swung open.
Draco wasn’t expecting this direct of a question. “Just...just tell my mother I love her, and I’ll hopefully see her soon.”
“It’s a miracle you survive every day life, love, nevertheless the Killing Curse. No, we’re having a snowball fight. Everyone in our year is going to start attacking very soon, so I suggest you make yourself useful. Only charms allowed, mind you, no jinxes or hexes.”
Harry let go of Draco’s hand which was now beginning to shake. “Back off, Smith. You need to stop sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong, or you might lose it.” Harry reached into his pocket to take out his wand.
“That’s okay Sweetheart. Everything’s going to be okay, I just know it. I’m so happy to see you. You’re doing okay? Is school going well? Are people treating you alright?” Narcissa fired off questions, one after another.
“What’s going on here?” Draco turned around to see Blaise, Greg, and Daphne standing with their arms crossed, looking suspiciously at the other Gryffindors.
“That’s wonderful, dragon,” Narcissa said, eating daintily. “If you would like to invite them over sometime this break, you are welcome to do so.”
“I already made some, if you want to have a cuppa.” Draco nearly collapsed with shock and fear, and before he knew what he was doing he had drawn his wand and spun around. The manacle on his wrist send a wave of pain through him as a warning, and he dropped his wand to clench his hand.
He finally understood. They were doing what it seemed like the Ministry would not. They were doing it in honor of those who lost and were lost. They felt like everything they fought for had been forgotten, and they were trying to rectify it. They were attempting to fight former Death Eaters—and he was on their list.
Draco was snapped out of his reverie, very confused. “Sorry?”
To Draco’s embarrassment, Harry’s eyes were shining, and not from the cold. Draco didn’t want to see his boyfriend cry, even though it wouldn’t be for the first time. Crying from happiness at this small gesture was almost too much to bear. Draco continued making snowballs even faster than before. “It’s not a big deal, I—“
Draco felt a little better at Harry’s low expectations, but also somewhat offended. Satisfied, he sighed. “I guess some of the early Christmases at the Manor.”
“It’s pretty late,” Harry said. “Do you want to go chat...?” He nodded toward their bedroom. “We could work on our project together,” he said, satisfying the few curious students who had glanced up.
, so he took cares to keep the papers in his desk drawer. He, too, had to get used to throwing away dozens of hateful messages that arrived by owl each morning. But it was vastly different to be criticized by random strangers than to be berated by a prominent newspaper. It was this rage that caused Draco during one sleepless night to abandon his bed, which was still not shared by a stubbornly principled Harry, and enter the common room to write a letter to the
“Everyone has. It’s not a big deal,” Draco was feeling more uncomfortable by the second.
Draco thought about the last two years of Snape’s life. Starting in Draco’s sixth year he had become almost hostile to his former mentor. He avoided Snape’s concerned gaze whenever he could. When Snape became Headmaster, Draco ignored all the notes summoning him to Snape’s office. Now that Snape was dead, Draco couldn’t think of anyone he wanted to see more. He wanted to ask Snape so many questions, wanted to tell him about all the horrendous things that he had done and seen over the past year. Sometimes Draco felt like he was choking on the regret of how he treated the professor in his final months.
It turned out that Draco had done significant damage to his fingers from the hypothermia, the tips of which may have permanent loss of feeling. However, all of them stayed intact, and he was even able to return to classes that day after a promise to talk to Christine about what had happened. He was in the middle of brewing a difficult potion when a first year walked into the classroom and handed Professor Slughorn a note.
“How is being locked up and forced to relive your worst memories over and over again keeping them safe? My father is barely sane, Weasley.” Draco was struggling to keep his voice even, and he could tell that Ron was as well.
“Did you speak with any other Death Eaters?”
“I literally cannot perform magic, Weasley!” Draco’s tone dripped with malice.
. This wasn’t working.
“No,” Narcissa said firmly. “I tried to steer my family away from the remaining group of Death Eaters as quickly as possible.”
“Actually we’ve become...mates. He’s pretty nice. We’ve put a lot of our disagreements in the past.”
Draco had so many questions for Harry, so many things that he wanted to know. Where to start? “Do you know this area well? Growing up with the Muggles and all...”
“I...I mean I think that sounds like the best plan we’ve come up with so far, but why do all of you have to be involved?” Hermione and Neville glared a little, but Draco hadn’t meant to be insulting. “Not that I want you specifically not involved, it’s just that the less people who go, the less risky it is.”
“Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister?”
“Oh my goodness!” Daphne squealed. “He likes you! Oh, Draco, you
Draco knew this was a turning point for him, and he knew he was running out of time to make a decision. He swallowed and took a deep breath. He slowly reached out his hand, but when his fingers touched Potter’s, he snatched it away.
Draco took a deep breath and turned back toward Ron. “On that note, I’m sorry, Weasley. I’m sorry for tormenting you over the years. I’m sorry for the comments I made about your family. I’m sorry about...” Draco made himself say it. “I’m sorry I let Death Eaters into the castle in sixth year. I know that led to your older brother being disfigured. I’m really, really sorry.”
“Wait!” Draco called. “Here Harry, I’ll take the cloak, go ahead with them—“
“Where were you on the train?” Blaise asked in a somewhat accusatory tone.
A few minutes later
The hardest part was getting away at the end of the evening. Harry knew that Draco was caught up on his homework, and Draco was keeping Harry company while he did his. When the clock struck at the half hour past eight, Draco stood up from where he and Harry were perched in the common room. All the eighth years were used to their relationship after a week, and managed to keep their thoughts to themselves, especially when Harry was around. Draco didn’t want to flatter himself too much—it was more like they didn’t have the mental space to even think about him, as everyone was very busy with entrance exams into various Ministry professions.
Harry was immune to her charm, but did notice the glance that she had given the others. His voice was flat and irritated when he spoke. “We’re here to see Kingsley. About a project we’re doing for school.”
“So...so he
“Mother,” was all he could say, his voice breaking with emotion.
“What are you thinking about?” Harry asked.
“Hello, Madame Pomfrey. I was wondering if I could get some more...”
“We can debate about everything I’ve done wrong for years,” Draco said. “But what exactly do you want?”
Chapter 1
“Does it feel any better?” Harry had been a perfect boyfriend, staying with Draco all throughout their midday break as he battled anxiety and nausea.
“Why do you want to be his friend?” Ron nodded at Harry.
Draco frowned. "Harry, don't. From what I know about you, you hated the fame. You hate people calling you 'Golden Boy'. I'm sorry I called you that before. One thing I want you to understand. WE started the relationship before we knew about the bond thing. Maybe we were fated to be together. But in no way is my love for you false. Okay? Yes, we may become pawns of the Light due to the bond and heir status, but the powers that will develop are going to help us keep ourselves alive. So don't turn cynical on me. I'm cynical enough for the both of us." Harry nodded.
"Draco, only you would think of scaring the first years as hilarious. Imagine they come into a school that they were not familiar with, and the prefects are so scary, you are going to scar them for life." Ginny frowned back at Draco, as she was a prefect for her year too. Just then Hermione came back to her seat.
"Try us." Draco said, almost ready to plead her to talk to them.
Hermione sat down beside Draco with a lunch basket. She then sent out some red sparks with her wand to Ron, indicating the arrival of lunch. "Torture is right. I don't know how long they will last before they collapse from exhaustion." Hermione scowled.
Her eyes fluttered open, staring at the white ceiling above her. The last thing she remembered was… pain. She turned her head when she felt someone staring at her, and found two pairs of eyes intently looking at her.
Harry pushed himself back from Draco to look at Draco's eyes, filled with tenderness for him. He sniffed and nodded. "Well… I… everything hit me at one go. I knew about the Heir thing beforehand. But when I realized that you are also an Heir… At first I told myself that no one knew that you are Slytherin's Heir, so even if you don't get involved with the war, it's okay. I got pretty protective of you I guess. Then I find out that you are bonded to me. This kind of soul mate bond means that one cannot live without the other. And I don't want to lose you, Dray."
Draco looked at her leaving figure and turned to see Harry grinning at him. "Well, she just officially 'adopted' you in front of the whole Gryffindor. It means if any one in Gryffindor bad-mouths you, they'll get it from her. And they won't want to go against her."
Suddenly, she heard a noise in front of her in the passageway which was not fully lit. She froze and took out her wand, looking into the dark area.
"You guys are corrupting Neville. He's turning violent." Harry exclaimed in exasperation. Everyone chuckled as the atmosphere in the infirmary became lighter. "Seriously, I rather spend my energy on Day when she wakes up and seek my revenge in the Quidditch match against Slytherin. I don't care. We're winning that Quidditch Cup for Day." Ron nodded.
"Don't bother. She's Hermione. If she isn't nagging all of us about homework and study, then there is something wrong." Draco answered.
"Why? First and foremost, your face disgusts me. Secondly, orders from our Great Lord. He said that the three of us will be initiated when we get rid of a good friend of Harry Potter. Seeing that the whole gang seemed to travel around in packs, you were the only one whom we had access to. And lastly, my two good friends here are hot for your body. There is the additional incentive in that when we kill you, the Slytherin will be able to win the Quidditch match. Lots of advantages, so why shouldn't we kill you? Enough talking. Time for some action." Pansy sneered at Day and suddenly punched Day. Day could feel the blood flowing down her nose as she reeled back from the punch. Crabbe and Goyle gripped her robes and started ripping them off, while slapping her face. As her limbs were still unable to move, it was very difficult to fight the two boys who were trying to strip her naked. The two of them were mauling the flesh that they uncovered, making Day want to vomit. Day was screaming for them to stop what they were doing when she saw Pansy pull out a dagger. When Crabbe and Goyle finally got her naked, they stepped back for Pansy who was holding the dagger with a manic look in her eyes. By then, Day was cowering with fear on the floor and screaming for help, while trying to move backwards using her body, but was unsuccessful as Pansy's henchmen pulled her hands and legs to prevent her from moving.
“Yes, not necessarily for real news, though. Just to see what they’re saying. Why?”
“Mr. Malfoy,” an Auror that Draco didn’t recognize walked over to him and interrupted. “You’ll be taken in for questioning.” Draco no longer saw the three Death Eaters—he hoped they were captured rather than escaped.
“Well, thank you for coming to see me. Professor McGonagall shared with me that you weren’t too keen on coming, so I appreciate you participating in this program anyway.” She spoke with a quiet voice, her eyes twinkling. She strangely reminded Draco of Professor Dumbledore.
“I’m so sorry,” Draco said quietly. It was nearly a whisper.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, Potter, we all know that you’re so incredibly good at everything under the sun. Good for you. Just pick something and let’s move on with it.”
“I don’t know and I don’t care. I’m going to bed.” Draco set down his still-full cup of tea and got up, ignoring Granger’s protests.
As Granger and Longbottom chatted away, Draco noticed Harry acting strangely. His eyes were darting about as if seeing invisible enemies, and Draco could feel his leg bouncing anxiously under the table. Draco nudged him secretively and raised an eyebrow, trying to ask what was wrong without drawing the attention of Harry’s friends. “I need some air,” Harry said suddenly, and bolted outside.
“Yes, yes, how incredibly tragic,” the interrupting wizard drawled sarcastically. “It isn’t as if dozens of others experienced the same over the past few years.”
Wait, Potter was facing him, not on a broomstick. He looked around—he wasn’t in the Room of Requirement, he was in his new bedroom. Sunlight crept through the window. He was drenched in sweat and to his horror, tears were streaming down his face. He was gasping as Potter reached out a hand to steady him.
“You’re right, sir. I apologize for my disobedience.” It was like Draco was instantly taken back to his childhood. He felt so small in comparison to Mr. Burke. He heard Lucius in that yelling voice, telling him that he wasn’t good enough. His hands clenched the fabric on his pants just to keep from shaking.
Draco made it down in the depths of the Ministry without drawing suspicion. To his surprise, everyone was mostly milling about, chatting with each other excitedly, rather than in the courtroom. He stopped to listen to a reporter who was interviewing a member of the Wizengamot.
Draco couldn’t speak, he just shook his head, dropped the mirror, and curled up in on himself.
Draco moved to leave and then looked back at her for a moment. She seemed to have no intention of moving for quite a while as she pulled her knees up to her chest on the uncomfortable, wooden chair. “You terrify me,” he said suddenly, shaking as he pulled himself to his feet.
“Yeah but...I don’t know, maybe we’ve just been getting too close. Maybe I need to take a step back and let him breathe.”
“You wouldn’t want to anyway, my dragon, it’s been days since I’ve had a bath,” Narcissa smiled kindly but tiredly at Draco.
“That will be more difficult,” the Wizengamot member stated. “His trial will begin in the afternoon, and I doubt we’ll have a decision made before tomorrow. We need to make sure he doesn’t know where the Dark artifact is, and we also need to see about the level of contact he has had with Nott.”
Harry ignored his quip. “Here, we’re both going to get under this. I hope your shoes are good, we’ve got a long walk ahead of us. Move closer to me.”
“So much for a fresh start, huh?” Blaise said morosely.
Draco was now starting to feel the lingering effects of the Dementors. He willed himself not to have a panic attack here, but his breathing was becoming more and more rapid. Yarney could just leave him in this room to die if he wanted, and there would be nothing Draco could do about it. Draco laughed to himself—a fitting punishment for someone who housed multiple people in their basement dungeon for the better part of last year.
“I’m not too keen on them finding out myself,” Harry shuddered. “Not because of you. I wouldn’t want them to find out about anyone I was dating. They suggested I was dating Hermione back in fourth year, and she actually got hate mail over it.”
Draco asked Harry a question with his eyes, and Harry answered it by closing his. Slowly, Draco brought Harry’s face forward until their lips touched. One of Harry’s hands touched his neck, the other caressed his back. It wasn’t a long kiss, but it was electrifying. Draco never wanted to open his eyes again, but he wanted to make sure what he was doing was alright. He leaned back and watched for Harry’s reaction. His boyfriend—I still can’t believe it—smiled, and it was the greatest thing Draco had ever seen.
“No worries.” The last thing Draco wanted to do was make Daphne feel bad for something that wasn’t her fault.
Harry propped himself up on an elbow. “I don’t blame you, after what he said to you last time.” He paused. “I know that my parents are dead, so maybe I just wouldn’t understand. But why would you put yourself through something like that again?”
“No way,” Draco said, though a flicker of doubt rose inside of him. “He’s just always around. Particularly when embarrassing things happen to me, I guess.”
Finally, for anyone who has sadly read the Cursed Child, sorry to bring up any painful memories of that script. It isn’t a terrible idea, someone trying to bring Voldemort back using a Time Turner, but it was just executed horribly in the Cursed Child. It won’t really pertain to this story a whole lot (which is obviously not Cursed Child-compliant), but it gives the former Death Eaters something to do, lol.
Unfortunately in the process of walking toward the window, he banged his foot on his trunk, making a thudding sound. “Draco?” He jumped at Harry’s voice. The lights came on and he found Harry sitting up in his bed, glasses off, as if he had just woken up. “Are you alright?”
Auror Yarney moved to a cabinet and pulled out a thick file. He began skimming over the papers. After a few minutes, a long letter came zooming out of the fireplace next to his desk. Draco sat, fidgeting in his chair, as Yarney read the contents. “Interesting,” he mused. “Why didn’t you mention that Dolohov claimed your parents know more than they’re letting on?”
“Upset with you? No, you’re not a right prat to us—well, sometimes you are I guess. But you’re mostly a prat to yourself. What, did you think that we’d just forget about you if you ignored us?”
“You’d risk coming here and being caught just to get revenge?” The more Harry stalled, the more Draco felt like vomiting.
Kingsley did not waste any time with pleasantries, which Draco respected. He simply asked Draco to repeat everything he knew about the lost and newly returned Time Turner. Draco, remembering his conversation with Harry earlier about honesty, decided to come clean and tell Kingsley about the letter he had received and burned from Theo.
“Well...” Harry sighed and rubbed his forehead. “It’s a long story, but I sort of...had extra help back then that I don’t have this year.”
.” He took Harry’s hand and pressed it to his mouth for a kiss. Then he tossed the letter in the fireplace.
still saw it their right to intersperse personal remarks within factual news stories. The article about the second Malfoy trials labeled Draco’s parents as being absolutely pathetic. Where Draco had seen his mother’s courage in her perseverance to protect her family, the
He no longer felt helpless. In fact, he was even a little proud of himself. So far, he hadn’t involved anyone needlessly in his latest crisis, but he hadn’t been so arrogant as to assume he could do things all on his own either. He only hoped that this plan would work better than his others. If not that, he begged the universe to at least minimize the casualties.
“Yeah, I mean.” He stuffed his hands into his jeans. “Well, we don’t have to. S’just an idea. You know, considering we weren’t really sure, well, we hadn’t decided who would, like. Carry the baby, and this way we don't have to keep weighing up the pros and cons and playing one-on-one Quidditch to decide it, which. I mean we just keep tying every time we do, so.” He looked at the fertility potions, sitting innocuously on the bench, and then back again. “So this is a good decider,” he mumbled.
He sets his flask between his bent knees, and folds his arms across his chest, gloved fingers pressing against his ribs. He thinks it’s definitely cold enough to justify sitting this close, trying to glean Draco’s body warmth. Perfectly normal.
Ah well. At least it’s not the fucking Grim.
He grins as he sits down on the bed heavily, toeing his shoes off and pulling his wand out of his pocket so it ceases jabbing him in the thigh. He lies down backwards, legs dangling off the bed as he breathes out a long sigh that feels like it’s been building in him for hours.
"Yeah, Malfoy." Potter moves his hand until the back of his knuckles barely graze Draco's chest. "Draco. We should dance."
fucking long since he's kissed someone.
Draco bites at Harry’s jaw. "Thank you," he murmurs. "This isn’t too fast. The bits I’m bad at…" Draco sighs. "I’ll try bloody hard at them, I can give you that. I’ve learned that the hard way." His lips quirk up into a smile. "And this"—he presses his thick thigh against Harry’s cock, making Harry suck his stomach in and hiss through his teeth—"this is the bit I’m actually good at," Draco murmurs, pressing their lips together.
"Yep," Potter replies blithely, popping the P. "That’s it. And before you ask, no, I do not care to expand on that in any way, and yes, that is all you are getting."
Daco times his steps to land on whole paving slabs, avoiding stepping on the cracks where he can. He’d be driving the people around him spare, were there more people around, but this isn’t a thriving part of the city at 10pm. The streets are winding, the bare brick walls around him slightly sinister with their rough edges and looming height. It’s safe around here, though. Draco’s the most dangerous thing on these little streets at the moment. And he’s incredibly well-behaved.
Sirius, having changed back, grinned at the two boys. "Show off. So what if you can do it without a wand? You have to make sure that the wandless spells are some that can ensure your safety, not just a simple unlocking or locking charm that any first years know."
As he came to the area between Platform Nine and Ten, he casually looked around to see if he could sport any friends. Seeing none, and noting that he still have fifteen minutes to nine o'clock, he leaned on the wall between the two platforms and let himself fall back against it. He passed through the barrier, leaving behind the past and things that he did not want to remember, reaching Platform 9¾, to begin his seventh year in Hogwarts.
"And, my dear Harry, that's all we are doing today." Draco said in his husky voice, while staring at Harry's eyes.
"Gin, Wednesday eight pm, prefect room. Pass the message." Ginny nodded and went to find the other prefects of the house. Hermione then turned to Draco. "You do know that I'm going to miss you arguing against me in the prefect meetings right?" Hermione smiled at Draco.
He thought to himself. Fred and George graduated from Hogwarts two years before and were what you term as 'people who never grow up' as they were big pranksters when they were in school. They were now operating a joke shop in Diagon Alley which was quite profitable. Harry was even their first investor. It seemed that in times when there was an evil overload threatening the lives of people they felt that they should be able to take a few jokes, hence the success of the shop. Last that Harry heard, they were planning to open a branch of the shop in another wizarding village. However, as Harry stayed with his relatives for the summer and they absolutely hated magic and owl post, Harry did not get the chance to get much news about the wizarding world.
Harry's eyebrows went up. "You repaired it? Hmmm… just like just now when I wanted to protect everyone else in case we destroy the place with our lack of control. All I did was imagining the bubble surrounding us, locking the power within the bubble like a magical shield and it just happened."
Dean finally relaxed and sat there deep in thought. His erotic dreams had started during the summer. Before those dreams, he could safely say that he was as straight as Ron was, but after two weeks of waking up from wet dreams of Seamus and him making love, he stopped pushing away the thoughts that he liked Seamus. He actually had a secret sketchbook stashed in his trunk that was filled with images that he remembered from his dreams and had drawn upon waking up. He at first thought that it was just a phase but just now when he saw Seamus at the station, he wanted to kiss Seamus so badly that he almost couldn't stop himself. That's why he dragged Seamus in search of his other roommates thinking that if other people were around he should be able to control himself. However, seeing Seamus latched onto Harry was not a sight he wanted to see. He knew that Seamus had the habit of cuddling people be it boy or girl but found himself wanting to be in Harry's place. Thus when the opportunity arose, he decided to ask Harry.
"She went to the library an hour ago with Nev and Gin. She needed some books for her Arithmancy extra credit work. Although I wonder why she actually does those assignments for, knowing that she's going to get at least a hundred and fifty percent for that subject." Ron shook his head.
"Ron, did you know that the wager is tilting towards Ravenclaws? They say that they are supposed to have the brains. And that Gryffindors have the tendency to just rush in, hence not good chess players. Obviously not many people remembered about your first year huh? They also forgot that Draco here is not a Gryffindor, but a Slytherin. Flatten them for me." Day grinned. Ron smiled back at Day.
"Okay, what's wrong, Dean?" Harry sat down opposite Dean this time looking at his friend who was frowning away and biting his lower lip. Harry had never seen his friend like that before.
"Their sneakiness." Hermione added.
Ron and Harry were left staring at each other. Then both of them suddenly burst into laughter.
"I'm Ginny Weasley."
Harry started laughing as he stared at the floor in front of him. Draco stared at Harry, as he realized that this was not the type of sound he was used to when Harry normally laughed. This sound sounded… hysterical. The next moment, the window pane of the only window in the room broke, just as Draco flinched from a sudden pain in his head. Draco suddenly realized that Harry was losing control. His unleashed powers were affecting the room. He quickly stood up, hurled the currently sobbing Harry into his arms and retreated to one corner of the room, furthest from the window, slumping down to the floor.
"I'll see you outside. Need to ask Hermione something regarding the Charms homework."
They kept their hands linked as Harry looked up at the stars, and Draco looked at Harry. However the moment was disturbed by Seamus who flung open their curtains. At that moment, their hands let go and Seamus exclaimed, "What were you two doing in there? Nothing naughty I hope."
"Ron." Harry pointed to the mango pudding that was to be the dessert for the night that was in front of Hermione and indicated two with his fingers. Ron took two of the cups with the mango pudding and gave them to Harry. Harry then placed one beside Draco's plate and started eating the other one. Draco looked at Harry and lifted one of his eyebrows. All Harry did was grin back at him and continued eating his mango pudding. Draco then noticed that Seamus also took two mango puddings from the other side and reached across to put one in front of Dean. All Dean did was give a slight nod of acknowledgement. Ginny did the same for Neville.
Harry frowned. "And a gold thread?"
Both of them stayed in that room till fifteen minutes before dinner, talking about their childhood. Draco told him about his childhood at the manor, where he had to be very well-disciplined as a child. His father already started teaching him dark curses before he even knew that they were prohibited, and would beat him every time he misbehaved or failed to learn a spell within the allocated time. Draco had learnt since young to harden himself against his father's insults and learnt to think on his own. His childhood was the reason why he actually dared to say 'no' in front of Voldemort. He wanted to stop living in his father's shadows. Harry then told Draco about his childhood living under the stairs and being the maid of his muggle relatives. How they ignored him when they didn't want him there and scolded and insulted his parents and himself when they were angry. Whenever either one started getting upset by what he was saying, the other would send comfort waves through the mind link to soothe him. Finally, before leaving the room, Draco repaired the broken window with his wand.
Suddenly he heard a whimper come from the seat next to him, and turned to come face to face with black fur and black liquid eyes. "Hi, Snuffles. Woke up?" Sirius nodded, looking with interest at the food that just appeared on the table. He then looked at Draco and panted.
"Understatement of the century. Let's go back to find them." Harry got up with Dean to make their way back to their compartment to change into their robes.
Finally the finger stopped before touching Draco's erection. Draco whimpered and looked up at Harry, who was grinning.
"Of course. Who else will argue against you? Harry, potatoes." Draco said, handing Harry his spoon. Harry took the potatoes for him and went on eating. Just then a black furry head pushed itself in between of Harry's and Draco's bodies. "Snuffles, didn't anyone feed you? You are so rude." Draco mock scolded Sirius whose eyes were eyeing the chicken wings on the table. Harry stretched out his hand, grabbed a chicken wing and extended it to Sirius who immediately bit into the chicken wing and sat down between the two chairs eating it. Draco just shook his head and frowned up to the teachers' table where Professor Lupin was seated eating his dinner. "The way this mongrel is eating, you would think that Lupin is starving him. He won't do that, will he?" He glared back at Sirius who had finished the chicken wing and was panting hopefully up to him. Draco took two chicken wings and threw it onto the floor again, before going back to his dinner.
"Dray… Don't tease her. Dinner's the only time she's not reading." Harry joked. Hermione blushed and looked at Ron.
"Poppy, how is the girl?" Professor Dumbledore asked.
"Seamus Finnegan"
"Hey, where are you going?" Hermione looked up from the textbook she was reading.
"Why don't you lie back and we'll just talk? Our heir status means that we need to work together in the future." Draco commented, moving a little as Harry shifted to lie on his back.
Harry thought,
"It… hurts."
"That… will depend on what type of dreams. Nightmares? Like when I dream of Voldemort all the time?"
Finally half an hour later, he slammed the textbook shut and blew lightly on his parchment so that the ink would dry. Draco by then was leaning back on the common room couch reading his Potions textbook leisurely. Harry nudged Draco, who upon giving Harry a glance, turned himself and laid his head on Harry's lap, as he continued to read from the light from the fire. Harry then placed his hand on Draco's stomach and idly stroked his boyfriend. Looking up, he found his two best friends staring at him, both of them smiling.
Draco then reflected on his stay in Gryffindor. Since the first Saturday, in which the weekend party was actually a welcome party for him, the Gryffindors had come to accept him as part of the house. Some of the junior Gryffindors actually willingly approached him to ask for help in Potions. Another reason was the chess game with Ravenclaws. The whole school seemed to get the impression that he entered the game as a Gryffindor, seeing that it was termed as the 'Gryffindor against Ravenclaw chess game'. A week after the chess game, he still had some of those Ravenclaws coming up to Ron and himself, asking them to explain the purpose of a particular chess move. They were still analyzing the game. Draco briefly wondered if they had nothing better to do with their time. His relationships with people in general, were better than ever. He had never in his life at Hogwarts, been surrounded by so many people willingly.
"You are all going to work in pairs this year. I'll assign you partners. And no switching of partners during the whole year. Parkinson and Bulstrode. Goyle and Crabbe. Zabini and Longbottom. Brown and Patil. Potter and Malfoy. Granger and Weasley. Thomas and Finnegan. Fifteen seconds to seat yourself beside your partner. Starting now." Most of the students are already seated with their partners so there was not much movement. At exactly fifteen seconds later, Professor Snape started talking. "You will place your summer assignments on my desk on your way out of the room later. This year, we will be focusing on some medi-potions. The reason we are focusing on this is due to the fact that some of you may want to continue your magical studies as mediwizards. What we learnt this year will help you as these are the basic potions mediwizards need to know how to brew. You also may need them if you are hurt and no mediwizards are at hand. You have learnt Pepper-Up potions in your fifth year. Some of the potions that we will be looking at are the Dreamless Sleep potion, Sleeping potion, Bruise Healing Potion, Wound-cleaning Potion and so on. Since you have a professor here who is a werewolf, I decided that you need to familiarize yourself with the Wolfsbane Potion. What is the function of Wolfsbane Potion?" The whole class expected Hermione's hand to shoot up to answer the question, and even Professor Snape seemed to blink in surprise when her hand remained on the desk. The class turned to stare at her as she seemed to be waiting patiently for someone to give the answer. "Longbottom."
"Oh. Okay. He escorted me into the hall and then left to eat peacefully in his own rooms." Draco grinned.
Ron finally slammed his textbook shut and stretched his hands above him. Draco frowned at Ron, who had disturbed him from reading his textbook in peace. Glancing at the clock, he frowned at the time.
"Ron, why's Day still up there?" Harry asked.
"But I thought that last year, even though you could sleep in every Sunday, but you woke up early on your own because you knew she wanted to have early breakfast so that she can rush to the library to do research?" Harry commented.
Harry stole a look at Draco and found Draco staring right back at him. Both of them seemed unwilling to turn and see how what just happened had affected the two other people in the room. When they finally looked at Sirius and Dumbledore, they found that Sirius' jaw was slack with shock, and even Dumbledore looked a little surprised.
Sirius stopped grinning and blinked at the two boys, stunned. "But… you guys had been together for…" He stopped, trying to mentally count the time the two boys were together.
When Draco finally came back to himself, he looked down at Harry who was laying his head on Draco's stomach waiting for him to recover from his pleasure. Harry smiled and leant up to give Draco a deep kiss. Draco could feel a faint taste of himself in Harry's mouth, as he felt himself stirring again. They broke the kiss and Draco looked up at Harry.
"Even if he does know, it doesn't mean he would tell me."
"And you are grinning?" Day asked, stretching her hand to feel Draco's forehead and placed her other hand on her own forehead, as if wondering if Draco was ill. "Normal temperature. Even Slytherins don't like Snape so much."
"Novelty of being born in that family. Need to know your spells. I'll lend you that book." Draco answered, following the group to the Great Hall for their lunch.
"Intention to control" Terry then answered.
When the whole group was ready for breakfast, they all journeyed down to the Great Hall for breakfast, with the Quidditch players dressed in their crimson Quidditch robes. They entered the Hall to cheering from the rest of their house. As Harry sat down, he glanced up to the staff table and the missing black dog and Professor Lupin reminded him that they left the night before on a mission for the headmaster. Since today was a Saturday and the next day was Halloween, with the students returning home on Monday morning, they were able to leave for their mission early. Harry was disappointed that Sirius would have to miss his match, but Dumbledore stressed the importance of leaving early, and Harry had no say in the matter. He just hoped that the two of them were safe on their mission.
"We could transfigure a bed." Draco's eyes slipped shut, enjoying the feel of his boyfriend in his arms.
The party in the Gryffindor Tower was harmful to the ears. It was not only a victory party for the Quidditch match but an engagement party for Seamus and Dean as well. Dean was stunned that Seamus pulled such a trick after the match ended and everyone was stunned by the fact that the person who was notorious for playing the field had just proposed to settle down. Draco and Harry were stunned by the spontaneity exhibited by Seamus. Seamus was about to propose on his broomstick when Harry impulsively helped by casting the levitating spell on him so as to allow him to kneel in mid-air. Even Seamus was stunned by how he himself had acted, although he really wanted to spend the rest of his life with Dean.  The whole wager of who Seamus would settle down with was settled and Neville came back with 5 pouches of gallons, as most people betted that Seamus would not propose to Dean before graduation. He happily handed the money out to Draco, Harry, Ron, Ginny, and kept the last pouch for himself. All Seamus did was roll his eyes at the smirks that everyone threw him and Dean and pulled Dean up to their dorm room, with a few bottles of butterbeer, with whistles following their exit of the common room.
Ron looked at the two hopeful pairs of eyes pleading with him and gave in, nodding. He never could take Harry's puppy-eyed look. And Draco's grey eyes with a pleading look were just as powerful. Draco gave Ron a quick grin and happily went on eating his lunch. Ron actually felt good, making Draco happy. It was a weird feeling that he was not used to.
Harry went with the whole group to the dorms with only Hermione running off for her Arithmancy class. Upon reaching the dorm room, Harry dumped his bag on his bed, took a sleeveless t-shirt and a pair of shorts to change and then bent down to wear his running shoes. Draco was sitting on his bed tidying his things when he looked up just in time to see the back view of Harry straightening up dressed in a pair of shorts that showed off his muscular legs and a t-shirt that showed off his arms. Seamus sat down on Draco's bed, discreetly muttered to him "You're drooling." and grinned at his uncomfortable look. "Harry, you are not going to go running alone are you?" Seamus commented in a serious tone.
, he thought, as he rinsed his mouth. As he finished cleaning his mouth and washing up, he felt a pair of hands encircle him and saw Harry dropping a kiss onto the back of his neck, his lower body wrapped in a towel.
"Power" Draco finally muttered.
Harry walked towards Day, tossing a wrapped sandwich towards her. Using her Chaser reflexes, she caught and unwrapped it. Biting into the sandwich, she watched both Harry and Draco warily as she chewed. Draco leant against the wall next to her and was staring at her with his grey eyes. Harry was leaning against one of the sinks and casually crossed his arms in front of him. A thought hit her, if those two in front of her were not wizards; they could easily be models out in the muggle world. She grinned to that.
Draco shook his head, staring at Harry's lips. "I think it was you. I felt a sudden pain in my head just now when the window broke. I think the power you unleashed broke through the emotional barrier between our minds."
He sort of…knows it’s the second one, really. First of all, Draco really is exceptionally fit, Harry doesn’t need to exaggerate that in his head. And secondly, Harry might be great at avoiding dealing with unpleasant things, but he’s at least okay at admitting they’re happening. He just…puts off addressing them. Ergo, he’s quite aware at this point that his feelings for Draco are more than friendly, that a lot of them originate from below his waist and between his legs (because Harry is a hotblooded perv and Draco is hot), and that worryingly even more of these feelings originate…from that private little place in his chest. It’s not love, but it’s a fondness that borders on unbearable at times, makes his face heat and his skin prickle and his mind go a bit white when he thinks too hard about it. And as with all things of this nature, it’s not going away on it’s own, instead getting a little bit stronger with every flirty message Draco sends and every stupid, giddy smile that message subsequently brings to Harry’s face. It’s going to bite Harry in the arse eventually, or he’s going to have to be up front about how he feels, but for now he’s living in limbo and it will have to do. He’ll pretend to write his book. He’ll pretend to be just friends with Draco. He’ll deal with the fallout when it’s happening;
"Yeah." Potter nods, then licks his lips. Draco follows the movement with his eyes. "Let's get fucked up."
The answer turns out to be somehow even more ridiculous.
"Just think about it," he repeats, quickly scrawling the address of the flat he’s temporarily renting on the pale skin of Potter’s inner forearm. He tries not to notice the gentle lilac and blue veins under Potter’s skin. His writing is wobblier than usual, his hand trembling slightly. He fights to keep his grip on Potter’s wrist gentle. "And meet me at this address tomorrow evening if you decide yes."
He found, to his surprise, that the row was actually a bit cathartic. The next time Harry saw Draco―at an industry event in support of fuck knows what, Harry just went where Aggie told him to―they got drunk again, and they didn’t fight once. They even made paper cranes out of the napkins, because
was obvious.” He rests his thumb just under Harry’ navel. “Still so much to learn about me, Potter,” he teases, a wicked slant to his lips and in his eyes.
Draco sniffed, that small smile still dancing around his lips as he looked at Harry from underneath his pale fringe. He straightened, then Summoned both potions, handing one to Harry.
Even so, Draco’s immensely glad to do it. He wants to help Potter. He wants to be useful to Potter, to offer him something. Draco has always wanted Potter’s attention and for it to be
"Pardon?" he says redundantly on an embarrassingly breathy voice. In a last ditch effort to poke holes in an unexpected positive thing, Draco reasons that Potter is most likely just telling him he's also into men, or not straight at the least. It's not a come on. It's not what Draco's gut tells him, and not what the tight feeling in his chest hopes it is.
“So, how was the shower?” Draco queries a moment later, picking up his knife and watching Harry shrewdly.
Draco then changes into the grey vest and similarly-coloured trackies he likes to relax in and sits down on the edge of the bed. He rests his bare arms on his knees and lets out a breath he feels like he’s been carrying inside him for hours. He hangs his head, then stares at the corner of the room where he first saw the figure in his dreams. His mind is racing, the way his thoughts always do as soon as he has a moment to pause and properly let them come together. It makes sense, what Potter has told him, confirms Draco’s suspicions that the dreams were connected to Potter in some way. At the same time, it makes no sense at all. Draco’s never come across something like this. All he knows about the possible state of his own soul comes from the literature he’s managed to scare up on his travels about possible vampiric origins. He knows so little about Horcruxes, about magic that can scar a soul and leave it looking for a remedy on its own volition. He’s completely out of his depth.
Harry thinks it looks like it fades to an icy blue in places, a lilac, even orange hues mixed in there. It illuminates the landscape, a prism of otherworldly colour as it streaks across the sky. The light fragments across the dewy grass and sparse shrubs, a kaleidoscope of abstract colours. He can’t pull his eyes away.
"An investigator, of course." Draco raises one shoulder, casual and smug. He can’t hide it; he wants this. "I can find them."
Potter shakes his head, taking two steps back until he's standing against the brick wall of the alley. He rests against it, then lets his head fall back. He sighs, his face tilted towards the night sky.
happen to be precise, and Draco decided not to punctuate the silence in which they walked to the club with his questions. They bubble inside him, just under the surface, alongside the intermittent kicks of lust that spike every time the back of Potter's hand brushes against Draco's fingers.
Draco has the most sickening feeling in his gut. "What does that mean?"
The river winds slowly beside them as they share a cigarette. Potter’s free hand is in his pocket, his hair falling over his eyes and over the dark frame of his glasses.
It takes a few more tugs of Harry's fist to have him fully hard, and he pumps his cock once, twice more before letting it go. He eyes Draco's lines of shampoos and body wash, a crimson coloured soap that smells of berries and citrus. It turns Harry on even more, the scent of Draco's products and body potions and illicit and daring thrill. He tips a small circle of a lavender coloured lotion into his cupped palm, his breath catching as he angles his body away from the stream to rub his hand along the length of his prick.
"What, hump against me in your kitchen?" Draco teases breathlessly, slipping his thigh back between Harry’s legs. There's just enough wet from Harry’s leaking cock to ease the way, slicking up Draco's leg and the crease of his hip. They rut against each other like the inexperienced teenagers they never really got to be, just enough of a rhythm to be satisfying, to leave them breathless and dizzy and get them off. Draco digs his fingers into the thick of Harry’s thigh, lifting his leg just enough to really grind down against him. Harry lets his head thunk back against the ledge of the open cupboard, Draco mouthing at the line of Harry’s throat.
He doesn't want to taste anything more in his mouth than the salt from Potter's sweat-damp skin, than the lingering mint on his lips. Blood and fangs and dark appetites have no place in this room, Draco decides.
"You want to help me?" Potter sits up even straighter, his back against the headboard. "You're… still working this case?"
, Draco remembers Potter saying. He decides not to overthink things further.
“Don’t you dare.” Draco pulled Harry down next to him, with only marginal groaning from Harry. They lay face to face, Draco kissing down Harry’s neck.
Draco doesn’t follow Harry down to the Greenhouses at night. At least, he wasn’t following him the first time.
"Why would I trust you?" Potter asks. "With something like this."
“A dirty sock,” Harry agreed vehemently, trying not to gag, “that’s been out in the sun, fuck.”
“Whatever you want, Malfoy”
When they leave the bar and find a somewhat secluded corner―at least as secluded as this club is capable of―Draco all but sags against the wall. He sips at the drink Potter procured him, eyes closed. It's some kind of sour beer, Draco thinks, a lambic or geuze. It's not what he would have ever ordered for himself, but the surprise and tang of it is a welcome shock to his system. He needs to get a grip, get himself back under control. A room full of warm bodies can’t affect him this much. He won’t allow it.
“Wonderful. Make yourself at home, then. I’ll be just in the room one door down, and if you need anything in the night,” Draco’s smile softens, “sort it out yourself because I don’t want to be woken up,” he finishes softly, looking at Harry with such an unerring fondness that Harry almost has to look away. He doesn’t though, letting himself enjoy the moment and trying to differentiate what’s his own affection, and what’s coming from Draco. It’s like trying to follow motes of dust in a sunbeam with his eyes, a confusing and mesmerising dance of near identical particles, but one that he enjoys watching all the same.
about the war. It wasn’t very nice. It was hideously impolite of them to do it at Sarah’s, and Harry will blame the whisky sours for that, along with a general lack of impulse control. And a lifetime of trauma. That’ll usually set him off. He’s not sure what Draco’s excuse was, but Harry thinks it might be something pretty much along the same lines.
“I’m going to fuck you,” Harry announced, Summoning the lube and slicking his erection.
“Yes.” Draco wound his arms around his waist, rested his forehead against Harry. “And only one, thank heavens.” He kissed Harry gently, and Harry wasn’t sure if he was imagining the slightly wistful tone in Draco’s voice, or if he just wanted it to be there.
He feels good.
Potter’s frown deepens. "I don’t want―" he starts, but Draco
"Yeah."
God forbid there actually was an illicit potions smuggling ring going off in the marshlands, alerted to their presence by Harry moaning about the cold log and dodgy tea. He’ll never live that down.
"Ugh, yes. We’re not, like." Harry rips open the biscuits in lieu of answering properly, then shoves one in his mouth. A mouthful of chewed-up biscuit is a good conversation ender, he’s found. He doesn’t like this chat, or that fact that Agatha keeps trying to have it with him. Or that Hermione does too. Or that bloody Ron even mentioned something about how Harry, "Talks to that bloke an awful lot for someone who apparently doesn't want to get into his fancy knickers. What, I’m just,
Harry’s stomach sinks. All the humour in the situation sinks away down the plughole with it.
"My knick—are you fucking with me, here?" Draco hisses, then leans close once more. "Do you know that you are a missing person, Mr ‘
Potter looks up sharply at Draco’s words. He scowls. It’s exactly as magnificent as Draco remembers, getting a rise out of Potter. He feels like he’s gaining a little of the upper hand back.
Did something.
? He wants to scream,
much."
Potter throws him a look, but otherwise doesn't stop on his mission to get out of this place.
"Oi!" Harry frowns, pouring himself some more Mimosa out of the jug they’ve ordered to ‘share’ and which Harry is essentially finishing off himself. "Hedwig was a majestic name for an amazing bird, and you called an owl Pigwidgeon, so I think you’ll find, shut up." Harry salutes her with his champagne flute, then pokes out his tongue.
It still doesn’t help him sleep at night.
Songs bleed into each other, one to the next, and Draco sways with the beat and the rhythm of Potter's lips. Potter's kisses turn deeper, more insistent, and Draco rolls with it. They're barely dancing now, just moving in a hypnotic and dirty grind against each other. Draco can feel his cock stirring, another borderline novel feeling if he's frank. Not that sex is overly different for him now that he's less than human, or any less desirable. It's just been rather infrequent.
“Yes.” There's a quill and ink on the desk in front of the Healer, and he reaches for them now, then strokes his fingers across the soft edges of the quill. “Amateur astronomers, for the most part, out to catch a glimpse of something celestial.” The Healer’s smile turns almost wistful.
Harry shrugs, too tired and still full of fidgety embarrassment to really put up much of a fight.
Potter frowns at him. "What? Who says I want anything?"
. Draco’s loneliness curdles inside him. He eats the cucumber instead of pelting it at anyone, in an impressive display of self-restraint and maturity. Pity there’s no one here to admire how much he’s grown.
“You need to dilute it, then let your arm rest in it. Might be awkward, sticking your whole forearm in it,” Harry breaths a little half laugh, “but the solution really does help it feel better.” Harry’s throat works as he swallows, before he slowly moves his hand forwards then curls his fingers around Draco’s left wrist ― right above where Draco’s fingers have started absently scratching at the Mark, through the material of his top. “It might help with this, too.”
It takes Harry two tries before he finds the right door to the bathroom, fingers slipping a little clumsily over the ornate handle in his morning stupor. The bathroom tiles are clean and white, and freezing, underneath his feet. Harry pisses, leaning one shoulder against the wall as he does and resisting the urge to close his eyes again and doze off. Power napping while having a wee has never been suggested to him as a good idea, and Harry’s sure Draco would murder him if he got piss on his fancy bathroom floor. Murder him, and feed him to the peacocks, no doubt. Harry flushes the loo, smiling to himself again as he makes his way to the sink to wash his hands.
“Draco.”
“Boo.” Draco lips quirk into a half-smile as he places his hand into his lap. He’s shirtless still, wearing the same silk dressing gown from the previous morning hanging open. He’s slipped on a pair of black boxer briefs, too.
"What an awful teapot," Agatha mumbles, wrinkling her nose. Harry laughs.
It's also almost nice in a way, to be reminded of his own mortality―for there to possibly be something other than the sun that can truly hurt him. He decides to keep this thought to himself.
That new beginning lasts all of a few days. It’s not Draco’s fault, truly, because the third thing that happens to Draco is: he dies.
Draco doesn’t reply.
“I don’t think they are, to be honest. After all, it’s only us here, and then Wilkins and Gunn on duty next. Hardly a substantial surveillance project. They’re just going through the motions.”
Harry seems fidgety tonight, Draco slowly notices, as he settles into his usual spot next to him: back against the cool glass, Harry’s wand casting low light before them, shoulder and knee pressed against Harry’s and the overgrown plants hiding them from view. Harry’s not restless enough to disrupt the rhythm of their usual routine, but it is noticeable. Draco sits as still as he can, waiting to see what it is. His arm itches and his fingers twitch, and he rubs the soft heel of his palm over it, fights not to jiggle his knee at the sensation. He needs to leave it alone. He
Draco doesn't want to make any promises about how they are going to figure this out, how they can find a fix for what is going on. He doesn't want to lie, even though he feels confident they can uncover
They arrive at Draco’s flat well before sunrise, thankfully.
“That's what I thought his morning, when I woke up to a raging erection that wasn’t entirely my own doing.”
“Mmhmm. That, and my arse has gone numb. Speaking of which.” Draco pats the log he’s sitting on. “Have a seat, stop perching there on your haunches like a dying phoenix. You’re stressing me out.”
"A lot of places," Potter replies. His breath ghosts along the side of Draco's neck again, over the soft skin behind his ear.
Harry fiddles with his quill for a moment before he replies to Draco.
He lasts about forty-five minutes before messaging Draco.
"Thank you," he murmurs against Potter's damp skin. "But I'm fine." He kisses Potter again, open mouthed and filthy, as he rolls his hips again.
Another kiss against his neck, Draco’s fingers trailing lower until they reached the line of Harry’s pants; he couldn't be bothered wearing much else to bed these days. Draco hummed as he traced the outline of Harry’s erection. “What do you want?”
Harry smiles to himself about it, smug and pleased, all the way down the hall to where he vaguely remembers the bathroom is.
"Good," responds Draco. He knows he sounds eager. He doesn't bother to hide it. "I'll make some Floo calls. Let some people know to expect me. We can surprise the rest."
"Any of it." Draco breathes in deeply through his nose. "All of this. But specifically, the fact that it feels like I'm sucking my own prick."
“Fuck, I’m so sorry,” Harry apologises emphatically. “I had no―they didn’t mention not to, I didn’t think that―”
"Potter," he says cautiously, coming to a stop in front of him. "Potter," he repeats more forcefully when Potter doesn't appear to notice him. "Are you okay?"
kids love Harry, because Harry is great. With kids. He is not great with writing. Harry groans, the sound whooshing out of him in a constipated exhale. There is
It starts to rain around 4am.
Harry huffs out a breath, another half laugh of a sound. The heat is ebbing away from his face, thank god. “Okay, let me rephrase that, then. You think waking up to
He turns down the sheets on the left side of the bed and slips under them. They’re cool and comforting, not as good quality as the ones he has back home in London, but they’re familiar now. Potter turns onto his side, facing Draco as Draco mutters a
"Thank you," Draco says, on a sudden wave of emotion. He's not sure why he feels the need to say it. This isn't a gift. This is a job for him, not something he needs to be grateful for. But equally, it
," Ginny responds emphatically. "You know you don’t have to live like that anymore, right?"
“She does looks lovely,” Draco agrees. “She’s an angel. And yes she has.” He lets the dog down on all four legs, where she rushes around his calves, sniffing him all over. Satisfied, she trots over to her day bed and flops down, happily watching them. “She’s not had as much lopped off as you, mind.”
The vampire was gone when Draco regained consciousness, in an alleyway and with the metallic taste of blood coating his mouth and warming his insides. It takes more than a bite to make a vampire—vampiric magic has to be shared, drunk down in greedy gulps by the dying prey should the vampire be feeling generous, or broody, or whatever the fuck was going through the bloke’s head when he decided to turn Draco that night.
A top and a pair of grey pyjama bottoms hit him on the face just as he’s shut his eyes. “Oi,” he groans, pulling them away from his head and glaring up at Draco.
Harry’s cheek hits the freezing ground, glasses tumbling off, as his conscious flickers out with it.
"But," Potter says wryly, "it hasn’t been."
The Healer huffs. “That’s rather simplifying things, gentlemen.”
Harry looks up from the strawberries, then shrugs. There’s an odd expression on Draco’s face, but Harry can’t quite put his finger on what it is, nor what the feeling he’s picking up from Draco is either. “Yes, no complaints.” A small smile creeps across Harry’s face. “You fishing for compliments on the plumbing, Draco?.”
, and or thing?"
“Thought you slept naked,” Harry mumbles, still bleary with sleep.
Harry knows he was in a brilliant mood after his frank and caring dressing down by Ginny, and that he gushingly told her all about how much he liked Draco and how much they talked, and oh god he went on a bit about the kisses Draco sent, because Harry is an idiot who has no filter when he drinks. He doesn’t know why he felt the need to ride that happy wave all the way to his phone and splash his feelings across the globe at Draco and ruin everything. Lovely.
“Two years is hardly quick.”
He happily turns back to his ParchText conversation.
Across the room, as subdued in movement as Draco's own honey-slowed motions, the figure raises the same hand. There's room between them, three feet or more, but Draco can make this out. He can see the shape of four fingers, a thumb. He can see the raised palm corresponding to Draco's hand. Draco's chest aches, but the feeling seems distant, as if slowed just as his movements are. The melancholy swirling inside him is there, but it feels more peaceful now. Resigned.
This time, Potter doesn't hesitate before he takes it.
Draco groans against Harry's skin, planting kisses as he nods. His hair tickles at the base of Harry's sternum. His cock feels heavy and feverish between his legs, his head spinning with over stimulation. Draco's barely even touched him.
The image of Draco in tiny swimming togs and scowling on a crystalline beach, clear skies and clearer waters in front of him, his hair salt-water tousled and his chest bare, swims into Harry’s head. Harry snorts a laugh, and then blushes all the same. It’s a stupid mental picture, and also a very sexy one. Harry wonders if possibly the fact he hasn’t seen Draco in person for almost a month has led him to daydream him as being fitter than he actually is, or if the accidental intimacy of talking with him every day has instead made Harry’s crush expand to gargantuan proportions.
Draco hummed, fingers against Harry’s chin as he tilted Harry’s face towards him, kissing his neck, then his jaw.
This a press of bodies, overheated skin under too many layers, music and light and excitement and
It all feels so normal, deceptively usual, and Harry feels wrong-footed by it. Even more so than he already was. "You’re here," Harry repeats.
Rising in the mornings is a distant memory to Draco. The evening blooms around them instead.
Ironically, and annoyingly, Harry often finds that when he’s truly overtired he can’t get to sleep for hours. It’s like the moment Harry’s head hits the pillow his brain decides it needs to be alert, just to fuck with him. Thankfully, for once in his life, tonight seems to be an exception to this. As he burrows down into the soft blankets of Draco’s guests room, clad in a top that smells of Draco’s laundry powder, Harry feels himself slipping off into a thick and dreamless sleep almost instantly.
“No touching,” he whispers as Harry moves to go in, almost brushing past him. Harry rolls his eyes, trying and failing to suppress the goosebumps that prickle over his neck where Draco’s breath ghosted for just a moment. Harry makes an exaggerated show of ducking to avoid any contact with Draco as Draco slides his hand up the door and over Harry’s head.
The rap of knuckles against Harry's door is startling in the quiet of the room, and yet not surprising in the least. Harry doesn't move, except to turn his head to look at the closed door. His fingers still linger along the waistband of his joggers.
And it's been
"Take the bed," Draco says. "I don’t really even need to sleep." He feels strangely exposed saying this, in revealing this strange new quality in his life.
The Healers seemed less confused about what had happened in the marshy Fens, but they were also infuriatingly vague when it came to sharing that information. Even after being poked and prodded and magically examined for what seemed like longer than they were even unconscious, the Healers didn’t seem inclined to give anything other than vague answers and annoying hums when Harry asked what had happened. A very valid question, he felt, considering that it was far from usual for him to be mesmerised by a shiny thing in the sky, go all tingly, and then pass out. At least not without having had a few drinks, Draco kept teasing him. Harry didn’t feel overly different, and definitely not like something significant had occurred, which was in itself rather concerning; Dark Magic could be sneaky, Harry had found. He really hoped he and Draco hadn’t managed to step in some somehow and that was why the sky had gone squiffy and Harry had felt such an odd zap and comfort at all the places he and Draco touched.
"No," Draco replies, frown deepening. "That’s not possible…" He trails off uncertainly.
"Do I?"
“You want that, don’t you?” Harry lifted his legs higher, one heel digging into the small of Draco’s back. Draco choked out an affirmative sound. “Come on Draco, do it, I want to feel you making me pr―”
“A testimony to my exceptional sperm.”
He can tell it's not going to take long, the stress of the evening making him ache for a quick release, the thrill of an orgasm. The familiar scent is maddening to him, getting under his skin and intensifying every stroke of his hand, every time his thumb bumps against the plummy head of his cock and his toes curl against the water-warmed shower tiles beneath his feet. He feels his breathing grow off kilter, sensation skittering up his spine as the pleasure seems to reverberate through him, ecchoing off the walls of the shower stall and back under his overheated skin. He shuts his eyes, throat working around a soundless gasp and groan as his balls tighten and his cock twitches in his hand.
Harry furrows his brow as he thinks. “I think it means space is really big and they have no real idea how this works,” he posits. The Healer smiles what looks to be his first genuine smile of the evening.
Harry shivers at the feeling of Draco’s magic, so familiar in this new terrain, as Draco gently sends Harry's glasses sailing towards the bedside table. They land silently beside the lamp. Draco steps closer between Harry's parted legs.
He scans across the words in front of him as well as he can without his glasses, trying to absorb the blur of medical jargon. He can’t understand half of it, but he can get the gist well enough.
"Will this get you off?" Harry rumbles, grabbing Draco by the arse and pulling him closer. He slips one hand down lower, cupping the join of Draco’s thigh and arse.
"Better be." Harry's voice is a low rumble, his eyes wide and his whole body thrumming with anticipation.
It’s midnight when Draco wakes up, tangled in his sheets. He thinks he’s had a nightmare; there’s sweat on his temples, and in the dip of his throat, and he’s covered in prickling, shivery goosebumps. If he did dream, he can’t remember it. That’s good. Draco is glad to forget the dreams that wake him up cold and sweaty.
Draco’s father has never hit him before, but Draco could tell that afternoon that he
"Hello. Um. Beg pardon?" replies Draco, awkwardly reaching out to steady Harry and then putting his hands in his pockets instead. "Please don’t hex me?" he adds, with a glance at Harry’s wand.
much." He strokes his fingers over Harry’s elbow, his hand warm through Harry’s thin shirt. "And then you messaged me." Draco inhales deeply, then laughs. "Well, you messaged some gibberish, Potter, I feel like I needed a Drunk-to-English translator. But I could get the jist of it." He licks his lips. Harry tracks the movement with his eyes, his stomach doing a somersault and his pulse starting to pick up the pace. "I had no idea. You’re so hard to read. I’ve been flirting with you for so, so fucking long." Draco laughs again, his knee bumping against Harry’s as he tucks his hair back behind his ear with his free hand. "I could never tell if you were aware and just politely not mentioning it, until you just went,
“How was that, enough distance?” Harry raises his eyebrows, fighting a smile.
be here, because no one has seen the boy wonder for at least three years. No one. The
"Where are my manners, will you take a seat?" Draco offers, gesturing at the kitchen table. The chair nearest Harry wooshes backwards in a soft gust of Draco’s magic. "I made us tea."
Draco shakes his head as he straightens up. "Not in the slightest. I was early. I’m annoyingly punctual these days," he jokes, wryly self-deprecating. It’s better than saying that he had nothing else to do and couldn’t get Potter out of his mind.
Harry’s taking this all in, trying to think of something nice to say, when another message pops in under the last.
“Fuck,” Draco panted, pushing back up onto his hands. He pulled out, cock dragging over the oversensitive rim of Harry’s arse, before he thrust down hard, and then again, his rhythm turning erratic.
"Yes, please." Draco turns his head, then presses his hot lips against Harry’s neck. "I’ll stay as long as you’ll have me, Potter."
Harry sets his quill on the table, telling himself it’s a good idea he’s being thrown over for a two-year-old’s toilet needs, because it’s about time he fucking got this novel on the road. He’s not getting up again until he’s written a chapter. Or, like, a page. A bloody paragraph. Harry cracks his knuckles, determined and motivated and god who is he kidding? He’s not going to write a fucking thing today. Harry gets up to make more tea instead.
“You can stay.” Harry sniffed, wiped the back of his hand across his face. It left a smear of dirt on his cheek. “I know you come out here sometimes. I don’t mind if you stay, but if you take the piss out of me for this,” he gestured at his face, at the tear streaks on it, then dropped his hand back into his lap, “I’ll hex you unconscious.” The dull Lumos light from his wand cast strange shadows on his face, eerie shadows forming under his cheekbones. He still hadn’t looked at Draco.
But those things aside, he was in fine form, and he was still working, because there was no way he was going to sit at home for nine bloody months getting fat on cream biscuits and expanding exponentially in all directions. No, he was Head fucking Auror, and he would continue to be
He doesn’t know if the rest of the world is aware of this, though. In his experience, some people have been, while others were clearly terrified of so much as accidentally nicking their lip on Draco’s teeth. He can’t really begrudge them their ignorance, as it isn’t as though he knew better before he joined the realms of the undead.
Potter raises one eyebrow, having observed the exchange. There's a smile ghosting around the corners of his lips. "Not getting in the way of something, am I?" he asks playfully.
“Would it have been so bad if, you know.” He shrugged one shoulder, still holding the blue positive paper slip tight between forefinger and thumb. “If it had worked too well?”
“Bottoms up,” he said softly, chinking his vial against Harry’s. Harry huffed a laugh, pulling the cork stopper on his and trying to get a grip on the butterflies in his stomach as he lifted the vial to his lips.
Harry sets the cup down with a solid clunk against the hardwood table. He wonders if 2pm is too early to admit he’s having a crisis and give up for the day. He’s already having mental conversations with his tea; it’s hardly going to get better from here.
Draco moves his knuckles closer to Harry's hole. He extends one wet finger out, rubs it over the puckered flesh. "I'd like this to be good for you," Draco says after a moment, surprisingly earnest.
Draco’s entire body tenses; he hadn’t even noticed he was doing it. He forces himself to relax, then slowly pulls his hand away. His heartbeat is still too loud in his ears, but the anxious need to run is ebbing back down into something calmer. Draco flexes his fingers, then feels something warm settle in his chest when Harry loosens his fingers but doesn’t let go of Draco’s wrist.
Harry pushed his hair away from his sweaty forehead as he canted his hips up higher, feeling Draco slip in deeper and hit ―
It’s been three years since he saw a sunrise. He does miss it, for all that he never appreciated it when it was his to observe pain-free.
“How can you not?” Draco sounds incredulous, stuck on this detail.
"This is all I've found," he explains. "Names, who I'm looking for, where they might be. Some leads." Potter licks his lips, then shakes the folder in a gesture for Draco to take it.
, Draco!” Harry bit playfully at Draco’s stomach, looking up at Draco’s grin. “Will you shut up?”
for a latte.
. Harry purses his lips, thinking.
pretty virile.
Harry stands upright again, shaking himself off and running his hands over his overheated face. He chalks it up to the weird night, not enough sleep perhaps making him woozy and hornier than usual, and nothing more.
Harry makes an unhappy face. His reflection in the mirror makes it right back at him. God, he looks awful, bags under his eyes and his hair sticking up on the side he’s slept on, like the wing of some bedraggled, dying bird. He’s been sleeping loads lately, so he’s not sure he has any right to look so crap. But then again,
, sausage roll held in his mouth and shopping bag and wand held in each hand, and then reappears in his kitchen moments later.
He’ll never understand what it was that made the one who bit him want to turn him, either. They barely talked. A shared drink under dim club lights, cigarette smoke and alcohol fumes and teenage angst fogging Draco's senses. They stumbled outside, and Draco felt giddy with rebellion, and heartsick too, and just a little bit regular sick from that last tequila sunrise. There was so much kissing, and it was brilliant, and then.
It took ages for them to get on good terms, and rightly so. Harry wasn’t going to become chummy with the likes of Draco Malfoy just because his then-wife Astoria was best friends with Harry’s agent and Agatha kept dragging Harry to parties and events that Draco and Astoria were at. That was not on Harry’s career agenda, making friends with Draco; Harry decided this the first time he saw Draco, Astoria and baby Scorpius at an event. Draco was just as pointy and snooty looking now as he had been in first year, and he could get stuffed. Harry wasn’t even going to be arsed saying hello to him, or to Astoria, or to his frankly fucking adorable son, Jesus what a cute baby. But nevermind all that, Harry was not interested in being polite, regardless of chubby-cheeked newborns.
“Bingo, Mr Potter.” He points his quill at Harry. “Albeit, again, an oversimplified view of the situation. You see, we have astronomers, Muggle and magical, who can map the stars for us, the turn of the planets, the pull of the moon. They can predict some significant astrological events, but they cannot predict all of them, and they cannot thus predict with reliable certainty if and when these events will affect the magical fields on earth, and of those inhabiting it. Sometimes what we see in the sky passes us by with barely a glance our way. Other times, such as we saw tonight, these anomalies seem to catch those who watch too closely in their wake. And when they do,” The Healer brings his hands together, quill cupped between them, “there is often a magical surge which in turn creates an orbital pull between two magical beings, and thus.” The Healer claps his hands fully around the quill. “A connection is made between them.”
The bed shifts again abruptly as Draco finally breaks eye contact, leaning up off the bed, and Harry finally breathes out. Draco clears his throat, a flush painting his cheeks and the dip of his collarbone visible above the collar of his shirt a soft pink. He licks his lips, then runs his fingers through his hair.
"Aggie!" Harry beams as she walks in. Or, he tries to. It possibly works. "So nice to see you, my favourite agent!"
It’s not elegant. It has absolutely no finesse, and lands harder than Harry intended, his teeth pressing up against the inside of his own lips. It’s perfect. Draco huffs a surprised noise, right into Harry’s mouth. Their teeth clack together as Draco smiles, Harry still dropping nipping kisses over his lips.
Each.
"Far from it," Draco explains. "I’ve just wrapped up a job. My dance card is clear, for the moment. And I don’t want your money, I’ve already told you that."
goes unsaid. His mind is whirring, the cogs in his head spinning faster than he can keep up with. He thinks he’s just now fathoming the true depths of Potter’s loneliness. A vision of the figure in his room each night flashes into his mind, unbidden. He blinks, still not ready to put a name to what he now knows it must be. "We thought we could find out what it meant together. We used to do that, she and Ron and I." Potter trails off. Draco doesn’t want to ask, to point out that Potter is here alone, that he’s searching without his friends. It feels too harsh right now to state the obvious. There must be a reason for it, and Draco is certain it will be nothing good.
“What ― oh.” Harry laughed. “That was just dirty talk, Draco ―”
"Let's get some fresh air," Potter suggests in a rough voice, and Draco nods, kissing his flushed and full lips one last time before they leave.
And it doesn't seem to stop Draco from popping round with a curry most weekends.
He leaves a pile of notes and coins on the bar (possibly too much, Merlin knows Draco can’t get his head around the Koruna-to-Euro-to-Galleon exchange rate) and then heads out to find somewhere more palatable to drink.
"When can you leave?"
"Potter, are you okay?" There’s the sound of the teapot being put down against the table. Draco sounds genuinely concerned.
“And the body wash okay?” Draco adds, as if Harry hadn’t spoken. His attention is fully focused on buttering his piece of toast, right out to each corner. There’s the hint of a smile at the corners of his mouth, and cheeks are flushed. The dip of his throat looks pink too.
He potters around his kitchen for most of the morning, making toast and tea and digging around for Paracetamol. He has a Floo call with Hermione, long overdue, and makes plans to properly catch up with them the week after next. He Floos Teddy and Andromeda too, and gets a genuinely riveting update on Teddy’s pet Tortoise and the gnomes in their garden. Impulsively, he owls Dean a copy of his cat story, which Dean’s been asking to see and which Harry has been feeling uncharacteristically shy about doing. Today, he figures fuck it. Harry’s written silly things before which Dean has attached charming doodle-drawings to, and Harry would be genuinely thrilled if he did that here, too. The only thing stopping him has been the deep weighted feeling of this story being nothing but procrastination from what he really
“It was good.” Draco’s voice is softer his time, but no less sure. It’s odd how settling Harry finds that. There was a time when even the sound of Draco’s voice could piss Harry off, set his nerves on edge. It’s quite the opposite now.
Draco nods. "Berlin. For a start."
"Do you know what a Horcrux is?"
." Harry shuts his eyes, then lets them flicker open again. He reminds himself to breathe as Draco suckles at the head of his cock. He presses his tongue against the slit, toys with Harry's foreskin, his forehead scrunching up as he groans. Looking down, he can see Draco press the heel of his palm against the firm shape of his cock through his pyjama bottoms. Harry's lips are tingling again, his mouth filling with saliva.
Draco’s hair caught on the mattress as he laughed. “You know, we don’t need to do this,” he said archly, letting Harry lift his legs around his waist. Harry looked at him quizzically through his messy fringe.
"I’ve wanted to do this for so long," Harry groans, mouthing at Draco’s jaw and pawing at his back, his arse, getting his hands under his canvas shirt and rubbing over his shoulder blades. He wants to touch him everywhere, all the inconsequential places and the exciting ones too: the backs of his knees, the dip of his throat, the shadows under his clavicles. It’s maddening and brilliant.
“Merlin, you feel so good,” Draco mumbled, sucking at the skin of Harry’s throat. Harry bit his lip, stomach muscles taut and shoulders tense with the effort it took not to touch himself, but he was
Harry stared down at the test in his hand, the paper slip turning blue as he pulled it out of the ConceptiTest Potion solution.
It’s not that the message is incomprehensible, although parts of it certainly are. The bulk of it is pretty easy to make sense of. It’s not a declaration of love, but it’s bloody fucking close, Harry having apparently decided that midnight UK time, via Muggle technology and while swimming in pizza grease, was the perfect moment to let Draco know how much he fancied him, how he used to think he was an intolerable mean prick but now he thinks about how much he likes his hair and face and stupid posh voice, that he thinks Draco might like him too but he can never be sure but he’s trying not to be a mushroom anymore and do things he likes, and one of those things is Draco. Double entendre not really intended, but also he would like to do him.
When Potter pulls Draco on top of him, Draco is already closer to coming than he would expect. He settles between Potter's parted thighs, kissing him deeply before pulling away for a breath. He kisses down Potter's jaw, now smooth where before it was rough with stubble. Potter must have used a Shaving Charm when he showered. Draco kisses over his throat when Potter's arches his neck. He buries his face there, breathing in Potter's scent. There's no cologne left, just Draco's own shampoo and Potter's skin. It's intoxicating. Potter's hand is in Draco hair, keeping him where he is while the other grips at Draco's arse. Potter sets the rhythm, Draco circling his hips and thrusting down against Potter, guided by Potter's hand.
As far as distraction techniques went, it was very effective. Draco grunted, bottom lip caught between his teeth and the humour leaving his face as his thrust turned choppy. His hair was sticking to his forehead, the damp tendrils turned a darker blond as they curled over his brows and down his neck. God, he was so fucking fit. Harry dug his fingers into Draco’s wrists, grinned at the hissed intake of breath that earned him. Draco always liked things tinged with an edge of pain, Harry had learned, and from the glassy look in his eyes it was working now.
“Do it,” Harry repeated, “I want you to, to ―” Harry pressed his lips together, trying to curb the stream of filthy nonsense that wanted to fall out of his mouth. He felt ‘
Harry’s geographical knowledge is shit.
soul in order to reside there with it. And that space is now vacant. It’s searching for something… to fill it, the hollow there. It’s fractured." Potter swallows thickly, blinking rapidly as his eyes become bright. "Like his was," he croaks. He sniffs, and wipes at his cheek. "But it’s not like with him. I don’t know what it wants, what it’s looking for from people. I don’t why I’m doing it," Potter says, deeply distressed. "And I’ve read so much. So many cultures have creatures like this, myths about―" Potter looks at Draco his voice sounds rough, and thick. "About beings that feed on souls," he says. Potter’s voice has grown so soft, a barely there croak. I’m terrified. I’m terrified that
When he steps out of the Floo of his own rented flat, he finally draws in a shaking breath. It catches in his lungs like he's breathing in fire.
"I’ll be here," he says, as the baman impatiently motions Potter towards one of the velvet-curtained doors across the room. Potter nods. He lets his hand fall away from Draco’s arm, running his fingers down to Draco’s wrist as he does so.
"A drink," Potter repeats, holding Draco's gaze with those inscrutable eyes.
He smiled crookedly and Harry snorted at the lie of it; they both knew Draco could sleep through the apocalypse, which was one of the things that had surprised Harry about that first night they’d slept together after an exceptionally dull and drunken Ministry function when they were nineteen. Of course, the first surprise had been that they’d managed to spend an entire evening together without trying to kill each other, beyond the snapped conversation at the beginning of the evening and Harry hitting his head on a shelf during their frantic, drunken grope in the cloakroom when they were meant to be leaving.
. Potter’s skin is all that’s available.
The sudden thought of Draco being able to feel what he is feeling via the bond makes that same feeling in his stomach lurch and plummet.
"Mmm." Draco pretends to think. "I have to say, if this is how you’ve eluded discovery for all these years, just politely asking people not to disclose they saw you, it’s an unusual approach. But I could be amenable to that. You’ll have to make it worth my while, though."
And it is him. It is
“Fuck,” he mumbled, feeling giddy and stupid and revoltingly happy, and not a small bit terrified too. “It worked.” He turned slightly stunned eyes to Draco, who was looking a little bit stunned himself as he casually held his own ― dull red ― paper slip.
Harry chuckles, each stair feeling harder than the last as the events of the evening seem to suddenly weigh on him like a tonne of bricks. Quickly, before he can think better of it, he takes the chance to voice something that's been niggling at his mind. “Draco,” he starts, then licks his lips, choosing his words.
“Oh, ta.” Draco accepts it gratefully, long fingers curling over the cool silver flask. “Here I am, yes. Excellent surveillance there on your part, Potter, you should consider being an Auror.”
“That tossing off would count as a heightened emotion?” Draco runs a hand through his hair, pushes it away from his forehead. It’s neatly brushed. Harry’s blushing so much he feels his eyeballs must be boiling in his head. “I wouldn’t have thought so either, but apparently you were having a rather good time.”
There was a lot of coffee, and a lot of exasperated sighing from Aggie, and one slightly mad proposition from Harry about what he would like to do instead of the book he promised them but is definitely, definitely not writing. Or able to write. Or in any way remotely interested in writing.
"Merlin, this strainer is shit."
Draco wasn’t following Harry out to the greenhouses at night, but Harry might have been following him.
Harry huffs, scooting closer on the sheets so he can fit his body behind Draco. Just as before, he doesn’t feel any magnificent surge when their bodies touch. He does feel comforted, though, warm at all the places they touch―his knees tucked in the backs of Draco’s, his chest against the back of Draco’s shoulders, his flaccid prick pressed against Draco’s arse. It’s intimate, in a way that Harry can’t separate from the way the bond felt, and the way he just usually feels about Draco.
Something flashes across Potter's face, another quirk of emotion Draco isn't sure how to read. He's stricken, suddenly, with the worry he's revealed too much―about himself, about his preferences. Potter's expression is once again impossible to read.
He rarely dreams now. He doesn’t need to rest the way he did when he was human, and mortal, and bound by what seems now an incredibly restrictive recovery schedule. Sometimes it feels like his body is in a kind of conservation mode that his mind isn’t limited by. He doesn’t need to eat every day, or possibly at all, although he still enjoys it. He’s not sure he even needs to sleep during the day, but he absolutely must avoid the sun. He stuck his hand out a window once, when he was still learning how to be this new creature and wanted to test his own limits―see what was really true and what belonged between the pages of gothic fiction. He quickly discovered, through searing heat and excruciating pain, that the sun is indeed deadly to his kind. That part has not been exaggerated.
Potter licks his lips. He cups the hand holding his drink against his chest, still smiling that crooked and barely-there smile. "Dance with me first?"
Draco smiles his most businesslike of smiles in lieu of a spoken answer.
Potter is gone for over an hour. Seventy-three minutes, to be precise. Draco can’t help but count every one of them. He stares at the decrepit clock on the wall opposite, at the watch on his wrist. He fiddles with the dark leather strap of said watch, agitated and uneasy, as he nurses a cherry brandy and soda. It’s sickly sweet on his tongue and coats the back of his throat. It matches the discomfort he feels in the club. At Potter being hidden away behind moth-eaten velvet and in the company of God knows who.
, Harry, it is a bit sus, and you probably want to snog him.".
He extends one hand as far as he can with this limited movement. He feels like he's lifting it though molasses, his motions slowed and heavy. He holds his hand out, palm up, as he watches the figure watch him. He doesn't know if he can touch it, if he would want to—if it's even really here. The soul, Draco knows, is a real thing, but it's also the most intangible of magical elements a wizard may possess. This shadowy being, born of the apparent hollow left inside Potter, seems impossible to touch, like trying to hold smoke in cupped palms. Still, Draco holds his palm out.
Potter smiles at him ever so slightly, just the smallest lift of one corner of his mouth. It's such a tiny thing, a barely there movement of muscle, and yet it lifts his entire expression. He shrugs, the smile still glued gently to his lips and the corners of his eyes. They remain unerringly focussed on Draco's.
“Mmm.” Harry pressed his thumbs next to his lips, running one around Draco’s rim, before licking a long wet stripe from Draco’s perineum to his balls. He sucked one into his mouth, tasted the salt of Draco’s sweat, the bitter tang of his come, then moved lower once more. He opened his mouth, pressing his tongue inside, listening for the telltale hitch of Draco’s breath. If there was ever a better way to get Draco to stop talking ― stop talking coherently, at least ― Harry had yet to find it. He pushed his tongue deeper, fingers tense against Draco’s arse cheeks as Draco rocked his hips, fucking back against his face. Harry inhaled sharply, moaning as his cock ground against the bed sheets before he pulled back.
Harry sits alone, at the nice table in the nice enough pub, and tries to take Ginny's words in. There's wisdom in there, and an answer to his predicament too. He thinks of all those hours, days, spent sitting at his typewriter and being able to produce nothing, listening to the radio and quietly panicking. His novel sits abandoned, a mess of expectations, the joy long gone from creating it. The only thing he's enjoyed working on is his silly little cat tales, and he knows this, knew it days ago. It's refreshing, and nice, to write nonsense and just for fun, a bright spot in his days―along with talking to Malfoy. He thinks of Draco's messages, on parchment and on screen, of his long fingers making drunken paper cranes and the fall of his hair across his cheek. Those three kisses, and how much they mean something. How much Harry
Harry considers arguing with him, for the sake of it, but gives in. His calves are starting to ache from the weird position, anyway, and they’re rostered to monitor this area until the sun comes up. He might as well save his bickering for the smaller hours of the morning, when he and Draco are properly sick of each other and starting to snipe. They’re friends now, and far better mates than anyone would have anticipated (least of all Harry himself), and they are astoundingly good at pissing each other off and getting on each other’s tits and verbally swatting at each other like irate cats.
he writes, smiling to himself. It's an old joke between them, something Harry blurted out when he first found out Draco actually worked instead of lying around all day eating soft cheese and grapes, which is what Harry assumed posh gits did for a living. He's kept doing since he discovered how marvellously it pisses Draco off. Some parts of their friendship are still quite childish.
The parchment shimmers with another message.
"Okay, we’ll bench that topic." Ginny crosses her ankles and wiggles her toes, painted nails poking out the top of her sandals. Her expression grows somehow even smugger. "So are you dating Draco Malfoy yet?"
It sounds like so much more than it is, romantic almost, or organised, but at the same time ― they
"Even more than I do, I think," Draco mutters again in that almost admiring tone. It's as if he's talking to himself, can't hold it in. "I can feel it, what this is like for you."
“Next you’ll be saying you love me,” Harry teased, feeling a blessed wave of sleepiness crash over him. He said a silent prayer to the power of orgasms, and the fit, loving boyfriends who brought them to him.
"So you are, then," Potter mutters, almost to himself. He’s looking at his beer.
“Hello darling,” he mutters softly, stroking down her sleek, grey body. She trembles with happiness, ears soft and tail wagging. Such an odd thing, Harry thinks as he plays at the soft fur around her ears. She’s elegant the way all Saluki’s Harry's seen are, beautiful and slender and with the loveliest long ears, but she's so awkward, too, such a bundle of nervous energy. Harry's never had a pet that wasn't airborne and never cared much for them either, but he feels a thrill of being special every time she comes up to him, while shying away from other people. Animals are always honest, and Harry doesn't give much of a flying fuck what people think of him, but he values all creatures' opinions. Perhaps it's a throwback to that very first time Buckbeak bowed to him, deemed him worthy of a ride.
. Harry snorts. Sounds like something Teddy would write. Maybe he could get Teddy to read it for him one day.
“Yes, yeah,” Draco mumbled, cheeks flushing and soft prick starting to fill out again as it lay against his belly. “Fuck, yes, do that.” He moaned, all teasing forgotten as Harry lined up, slowly thrusting inside.
It occurs to him, while Potter is dressing, that they haven’t broached the topic of sleeping arrangements. There isn’t a sofa Potter can sleep on, not really; the chaise longue in this flat is too small for anyone over four feet tall to comfortably sleep on. When Draco looks back, Potter has finished dressing. The cuffs of the pyjamas bottoms are a little too long; Potter has rolled them up, exposing knobbly ankles. Draco feels strangely endeared by this small thing, and by the visual confirmation that he is taller than Potter. He drags his eyes away and back to Potter’s tired face.
He dreams that there are vines growing out of his Mark and the raw patches over it, long and twisted and beautiful. Their flowers unfurl their papery petals, blue blood pumping through them, and receding back into the deep green vines. They curl around Draco’s wrists, tendrils creeping under Harry’s loose fingers and across his skin too, twining and growing until they’re a tangled mess with no beginning or end. There’s dirt on Draco’s skin, and in his blood, and the longer he dreams the longer the vines twist and grow until his fingers feel still and the itch under his skin goes quiet.
He braces himself on his elbows to get better leverage, Potter's thighs rubbing against his hips and his breath hot and erratic against Draco's lips. "It's fine" He kisses Potter again, deep and hungry. "Not insensitive. Just, surplus to requirements," he explains. He means it too; it really is fine. He's done it before, bitten someone while getting off. For some people it's a powerful rush, submitting like that. For Draco, it can be euphoric. But it's alarming, too, to combine feeding with sex, and it truly is not necessary. If his carefully collected control were ever to slip, he worries it would be in the throes of either anger or passion. Draco perishes the thought.
“Can you...feel
Harry makes a face. "Does she look like a Tina?" He gestures at the cat, sitting on the chair next to him in her basket and licking her front paw.
“I just feel.” Draco pauses for a moment, closing his eyes and choosing his words carefully as he rubs slowly over his temples again. “That this has got to be complete horse shit.”
. He feels there may not be enough punctuation available to truly convey his disbelief at this development.
“I thought I’d just use your toothbrush!” Harry calls out to Draco’s retreating back. Harry can’t make out Draco’s reply, but he’s certain it’s heavily expletive laden.
"I lied." Harry smiles sweetly, and Agatha laughs, loud and genuine. He doesn’t think his story is actually crap, but he doesn't want to show her anyway. He’s weirdly fond of it, especially after he added more to it last night. It’s almost a proper story, now, and it’s still not what Harry is meant to be doing, but he’s having an odd amount of fun writing Harvey and Derek rescue Martha from the evil gnomes in his garden.
He turns to find Potter watching him. He's put a distance between them since the strange closeness of only moments before. His expression is a little strange, but not unhappy.
He’s always noticed Potter was handsome, good looking. It’s another thing entirely to let himself be affected by it.
The mood swings weren’t the worst thing either; although, they
“Whatever you want, Malfoy.”
"I’m so bad at this bit," Draco repeats, breath gusting against Harry’s face. "The talking bit. Feelings." Draco makes a face, pulling back a little to give Harry space. Harry feels himself tilting forwards, almost chasing the contact. He sways back. He must look like an idiot. He has no idea what his face is doing. His brain has entirely clocked out. "But I like you so much," Draco goes on. "
“‘s’fine.” Draco waved a hand, still loose and groggy from having only just woken up. “‘m a light sleeper.”
Potter nods, Draco's words seeming to soothe him, insofar as he hears them. His body feels strung taut, hips punching up against Draco's with enough force to throw their rhythm off. Draco leans his weight on one elbow, gripping Potter's hips with one hand to hand him down. That does it for Potter. He gasps against Draco's mouth, thighs clenching around Draco as the hand gripping Draco's arse holds him against him. Between Potter's hand in his hair and on his arse, Draco feels held in place, hips now moving uncontrollably as he feels dampness spread across Potter's lap. Draco groans against Potter's lips as he follows suit, coming in heated pulses between them.
And when Draco wakes from this dream, he’s glad to remember it.
"Is it the bond?" Harry asks, even though he doesn't think the bond works like that. "Is it just...only right now?" The words fall away, falling petal soft between them.
Perhaps that's the point of this club's revolting sensory overload.
With the added element of the bond coursing between them, muddling what’s coming from Harry and what’s Draco, things should be more confusing. Strangely, though, Harry feels just the opposite. For the first time in the year or so that Harry’s been parsing these feelings and instincts out, he feels with certainty that there is something there, that it’s not just him.
"Oh, so you did end up watching me sleep?" Potter counters.
He waits a few more moments, but Draco doesn’t reply, and Harry slouches back to the kitchen to his badly-brewed tea and blank typewriter page.
“Yes.” Draco sniffs, then rests his elbow on his knee and his chin on his hands. “There’s something about this place, isn’t there,” he finishes quietly, his words trailing off into not-quite-a-question. “It’s eerie.”
Draco blends in, too, as he walks away.
As he orders a Negroni, Draco contemplates a third factor which also seems likely given their respective location—Harry Potter is either looking for Dark creatures, or he is one himself.
, Draco writes back almost instantly.
"Quit that."
He turns up just as Draco is finishing his second, nervous cigarette. Draco feels like he’s worn a dent in the brick wall he’s leaning against, he’s been there that long.
At first, Harry feels nothing, except the soft touch of Draco's fingertips against his skin. He wants to curl his face into the touch, but that's hardly surprising; he's wanted that for weeks. He isn't sure what he expected, perhaps a zap or a zing of something as soon as they touched, but he doesn't feel anything new―just the low rumble of excitement in his belly, the weighty hang of his cock between his legs, and now Draco's soft touch lingering over the stubble on his jaw.
"I know a relaxing―"
"Ah," Draco nods in understanding, forehead rubbing against Harry's. He kisses him once more, before sitting back on his haunches. His hands return to the hem of Harry's joggers. "It's ridiculous," he says again, looking up at Harry through his lashes as he urges Harry to lift his hips. "How much I've wanted you," he slips the material down Harry's thighs, running his hands against Harry's skin in their wake. "These past months." They both gasp as Draco leans down and kisses the head of Harry's cock, pressing up against the material of his pants. "And these past weeks." Draco looks up at Harry again, as he pulls the waistband of Harry's briefs down too. Harry lifts his hips once more, his cock springing free. It juts out in front of them, right before Draco's slightly parted lips. Draco rests his hands on Harry's thighs. "And how much I want you now," he finishes, before ducking forwards and sealing his lips around the head of Harry's cock.
He casts it away to the back of his mind, where all perplexing puzzles and unsolved issues live, and throws himself into finding Potter’s mystery person instead.
"Hardly." Draco resists the urge to scoff, levelling Potter with a pointed look instead. "She's not exactly my type."
Harry’s quiet a beat, momentarily taken aback by Draco’s directness. “Not if you don’t want it to. I mean.” Harry clears his throat, deciding to repay Draco’s directness in kind. “I don’t want it to end here.”
"Don't be embarrassed." Draco smiles. "I'm not making fun. But you do realise, I could hurt you. I'm dangerous." He repeats Potter's own words, not to be facetious or a prick. "It's not hard for a vampire to take a life, or so I've been told. I didn't notice it happening to me," Draco admits.
Ginny laughs, leaning forward. "Okay, shall we go back to talking about the book instead?"
Harry scoffs. "Gee, that’s not ominous at all, Gin." He sighs. "Go on, though."
Harry waits, sitting on the edge of the sofa, but that's all the response Draco offers.
is touching himself.
Harry plucks distractedly at his lower lip with two fingers as he turns away, eyeing off the enormous shower. He strips off quickly, eager to wash the sleep fully away from himself. Once he's got the water to the right temperature, the warm stream of it sliding down his back, he indulges what else he's eager for and slips his hand around his mostly soft cock.
I can be. And I do understand what you said last night, why you left your friends. I do," Draco repeats sincerely. "In turn, I ask that you make sure you've heard what I'm saying too."
“C’mere,” Draco says abruptly, reaching back with one hand to thwap at Harry’s chest. Harry laughs softly, confused, as Draco pulls him up behind him. “Third thing,” Draco murmurs, sounding more than half-asleep already. “I like a cuddle.”
Well, a lot of things happen. He gets several haircuts, he gets spat at on the streets on the regular, and he grows an inch, to name just a few boring items on his 1999 agenda. The mundane, the everyday―it happens, and it happens and it happens again. It’s not the worst year of Draco’s life, because that’s still a toss up between the year Harry Potter refused to be his friend (wanker) and the year Harry Potter refused to let Draco die in a fire (
Harry sighs. “My wand is around here somewhere.” Harry flops a hand behind him, starts to lean up to get it. “I can try and cast a cleaning…”
, oh shit don’t touch me,” Harry ended on a whine, feebly slapping Draco’s hand away as he reached for Harry’s cock again.
. It opens with a quiet
Harry falls asleep to the memory of Draco’s skin against his lips, and the sound of Draco’s soft breathing as he sleeps.
Harry didn’t start a fight, though. He didn’t acknowledge Draco at all, as Draco walked closer, his feet trudging blindly forwards even though his brain was saying it might be smarter to stop and go back to the castle. It’s only when he’d walked right up to him, that Draco realised Potter was crying. His feet finally did stop working then, the surprise belatedly making them behave.
Draco's mouth turns down as he considers. "Sounds familiar, really."
Draco chuckles. “See, I rather thought
"Hermione figured it out, that it was coming from me. She’s so brilliant." Potter’s voice is reverent, melancholy. Draco thinks the
Harry stares into his tea, some of the badly strained leaves lazily floating to the surface before he prods them back down with the back of his spoon. It reminds him vaguely of Divination, of Ron’s made-up predictions and Hermione's exasperation and Trelawney’s sickly, cloying perfume. Harry wonders what these tea leaves might have in store for him today, were he able to actually read them.
you." He points at Harry.
Apparently, he
Potter nods, still blinking sleep out of his eyes. "Yeah." He yawns, wide enough to crack his jaw. "Like a log, actually."
“And you’re cranky,” Draco said rolling on his back with a yawn. 65% awake, now, Harry reckoned. “Wake up hungry again?”
Draco sits still for a moment, weighing his next words. He stands, and then moves across the room to sit on the bed next to Potter. He wants to take Potter's hand, but he doesn't. He rests his palm against the duvet instead.
Harry blinks, then frowns. "Living in
With that, Draco stands, fully accepting his date is an utter farce and his mood is completely tanking along with it. He’ll be damned if he’ll spend the evening in a bar he doesn’t care for, getting poked in the eye by a sprig of rosemary every time he tries to take a swig of his drink, and being stood up by some tosser. Etienne, Draco thinks his name was. He looked fit on the dating app. Draco will have forgotten about him by tomorrow.
Harry summoned the energy to swing his leg over Draco, then flopped down on his back next to him.
Harry spits his sausage roll out. It lands with a soggy splat on the floor. "I said what the fuck?" Harry drops his shopping bags by his feet too, then looks around, stunned. "What’re you…how…" He blinks, trying to compose his thoughts into some semblance of order, only it’s like herding cats and they’re all on skateboards, and also on ice. That’s covered in marbles. Harry’s got no hope.
! He wants to beg,
Harry does something monumental.
"Evening," Potter says, running a hand through his messy hair. "Am I late?"
Harry stares miserably at his traitorous phone screen, swaddled in his huge pile of blankets. He thinks about ringing Draco, but he doesn’t. He never wanted to make Draco feel uncomfortable because of Harry’s feelings, or to put him in a position where he would have to reject Harry. And now, in a fit of tipsy thoughtlessness, Harry has done exactly that. Calling Draco would only put him even more on the spot if he’s trying to think of a way to let Harry down gently, and Harry only feels more sick at the thought of it.
Harry drops his head to one shoulder with a low moan. "Yep," he manages, before giving up and letting himself fall backwards against the bed. Like this, the angle is better, as his body accommodates the stretch of both of Draco's long fingers. He maybe should have gone slower, but he likes the slight burn of it, the way Draco isn't letting up and trusts Harry to know what he likes. And he
He kisses Harry deep, and dirty, sucking on Harry’s lip and pressing him back against the kitchen counter. It’s uncomfortable, digging into the meat of Harry’s arse, but Draco’s hands are creeping up the back of his top and his thigh is perfect between Harry’s legs. Harry’s not moving for anything.
The home owners are always on their last fraying nerve and feeling less than sensible, and thus more than happy to let the charming man with the scrappy blond bun, denim overalls and stupid name fix up their house while they bugger off to Malta for some R and R and to Obliviate themselves with mojitos.
them to mean something, and perhaps they could, if Harry just.
Harry doesn’t care what any of them are ‘just sayin’’. He and Draco are mates, and that in itself is miracle enough, and so what if Draco is a bit fit and Harry is a bit prone to noticing that. He notices lots of things: trees, cats in his garden, that sushi is gross but somehow stinky cheese isn’t. That Draco’s bum is amazing. All just normal things, it’s no big deal.
Draco yanks Harry’s jeans down to his thighs, palms him through his underwear and then pulls them down too. The brush of cool air is starting against his cock. Harry manages to do the same, getting Draco’s trousers and pants down under his bum. He pulls Draco up against him, sighing at the feeling of bare skin on skin.
Harry gusts a laugh, then frowns. "But you didn’t reply," he says softly. It’s not accusatory. His head is still too muddled by this whiplash-inducing conversation for that. He’s happy he’s still standing really. There’s a smile buried in his chest, trying to ride up onto his face in a wave of emotion. He swallows to keep it down, in case this really is too good to be true and he’s daydreaming it all.
Agatha purses his lips. "So, this whole ‘getting away from London’ thing isn’t helping with the writer’s block at all, then?"
Draco thinks his heart stops. He's worried he may have misheard, but at the same time he knows he hasn't. He just can't take it in.
Harry wakes up with two things: a bit of a hangover, from too much wine shared with Aggie over some pretty average korma, and several new messages from both Hermione and Draco.
It takes him three days and three times as many Floo calls to get a really solid lead.
"No touching," he whispers, his smile so beautific it makes Harry’s breath catch in his throat. "Isn't that the rule?”
“I hardly anticipate that, based on last night.” Draco twists his mouth, as if deciding what to say next. “And based on the fact that I'd still fancy you even if you had no idea what you were doing in bed,” he confesses.
“Seem so, yeah.” He hands the scroll back to Draco. “Right, well.” Harry suddenly isn’t sure what to do with his hands. He feels abruptly aware of his nakedness, that he’s starkers in Draco’s bed. The events of the past night come rushing at him. “Guess we’d better head in,” he adds after a moment longer in which Draco simply stares at him. Harry swallows, and tries to relax around the tension he can feel building in his shoulders.
"You’re welcome, Harry," Draco replies thickly. He hopes the choked-up quality of his voice can be disguised as tiredness, although he doubts this given he’s already confessed to Potter that he doesn’t even need to rest anymore. Draco lays on his back, keeping his breathing steady. He can tell that Potter is looking at him, and even though the room is dark Draco feels exposed. He turns and, feeling for Potter’s shoulder with one hand, pulls him into a kiss. Potter makes a faint sound of surprise before he responds, a soft press of lips against Draco’s, a hand on the back of his neck.
going to come yet, even if he was accidentally talking himself off and Draco’s cock was ―
“God.” Harry huffed a laugh, settling back against the pillow. “I’ll go and have a wank in the loo,” he grumbled, a little self-deprecating and a lot embarrassed.
Harry gasped when Draco lifted him again, licking down his perineum. Draco hummed, mumbling the wandless cleaning charm they often used, and Harry started at the sudden tingling of the spell working him over; he’d almost completely forgotten that himself.
Harry stops at the crook of Draco's elbow, letting his lips rest against the tender skin there. It's another private, vulnerable place that Draco is letting Harry see, letting him get to. He swirls his tongue lightly, gasps in the echoed sensation against his own elbow. He sits up, both hands holding Draco's arm now, keeping it close to his mouth. The movement brings his groin closer to Draco's bent knee.
Draco smiles, the curve of his lips sweet and enticing, as he moves his left hand closer to Harry's face.
much."
Harry rests his head back against the open cupboard door, then lets his hand drop down from rummaging around and onto the counter top. "This is the pasta shelf anyway," he murmurs in reply.
“Exactly.” Draco grinned, slow and sated. He stretched one leg out until his ankle was resting on Harry’s shoulder. “We don’t need to come again.” He dropped one arm to the bed beside his head, then stretched languorously. His grin widened, growing more mischievous and self-satisfied at the same pace as Harry’s frown deepened.
“Ten points to Slytherin,” Harry snapped. “For accurately stating the fucking obvious.”
It's when Harry straightens up again, that he sees Draco.
"Draco," Harry laughs, bordering on desperate, "I told you. I'm easy for it."
"Merlin," Draco mutters, deflating as soon as the man is out of earshot. He leaves it at that, certain that if he starts complaining about this establishment he'll never be able to stop.
feared he was—well.
“Um,” Harry says, at a loss for a moment at what to say. He isn’t sure if Draco knows he can feel what's going on inside him, but based on Draco’s expression he would hazard not―Harry’s certain that if Draco knew, he wouldn’t be able to help reacting with embarrassment, or denial. “Guess that’s the downside of being my ex,” he says, hoping a joke will diffuse the tension and ease Draco’s discomfort, currently simmering inside Harry. “Have to still sort through my pants and bring me socks when I get in a tight spot.”
Harry hums, kissing over Draco's skin again. He can't describe what he feels, beyond a heightened awareness of every place his lips touch, his mouth almost tingling. He feels starved for it, and he cups his own hand over the back of Draco's, shifting his hips restlessly as he brings Draco's wrist closer. Draco lets his wrist go lax, easier for Harry to manoeuvre. He rests his knee on the bed between Harry's parted legs, inches from his groin. Harry feels so aware of everywhere Draco is, feels like he could almost whine with it.
He sends copies to all of his friends. He sends flowers and an edible arrangement to Aggie. He throws his typewriter in the bin.
sometimes as well, yeah?" She reaches up and pinches his cheek, slow and tender and oddly motherly. Harry’s eyes feel a bit warm. "Say no to the book you don’t want to write," she says softly. "Let people down. Don’t finish something you started." Harry looks down at her, her head resting on his shoulder and her eyes fond and bright with the drink.
“Oh, shit, sorr ―” Harry started to rise, but Draco wrapped his arms around his thighs, pulling his back towards him with a rumbling moan. Harry groaned, rolling his hips and grinding himself back against Draco in time with the urging movements of Draco's hands as he set the pace.
"Will you stay for dinner?" asks Harry, pulling Draco’s fine, tangled hair away from his lips.
Ginny shrugs, taking a sip of her peachy drink. "Sandra?"
His words are polite, and his tone measured, but Harry becomes aware of a stirring in his stomach, at the base of his spine. It’s familiar, and it takes him a moment, as he distractedly stirs his tea, to identify it as jealousy. It squirms strangely inside him, and he frowns in confusion before he realises, it’s not his. The stab of jealous discomfort at the mention of Harry’s ex is coming from Draco.
Harry sniggers, once, then dissolves into proper giggles as he tries to arrange the floating tea leaves into any kind of discernible shape. If he swishes his spoon it looks a bit like a string bean. A demented willy? Harry snorts.
But Potter's apparently none of those things. He's just… right there, messy hair and boyish cheeks and easy smile. It's so familiar it makes Draco's nails scratch against the wood of his table as he stares.
“Always,” replies Harry easily. Draco seems off this morning, awkward. Harry wonders if the past evening and bad sleep is perhaps hitting him harder than it is Harry. He sits down, his chair magically tucking itself in behind him. A white napkin unfolds itself from the table setting and lays itself down gently across his lap.
"Well, when you put it like that." Draco moves his glistening fingers closer, slick with lubricant. Harry wants to spread his legs wider, open his hips even further, but this is it. He holds his breath, then lets it out slowly, keeping his breathing even and trying to relax his body as much as he can. Draco looks at him as he presses his middle finger inside, pushing past the resistance at Harry's rim. Even though Draco's fingertip is inching inside him now, the eye contact somehow feels more intimate to Harry. He clenches his free hand in the bed sheets, his other resting on Draco's bare shoulder.
Harry grunted in reply, too furiously turned on and determined to wallow in his middle-of-the-night body crisis to speak properly.
The giddy swell peaks, plateaus, then absolutely splats when he goes through the dizzying emotions of receiving and then reading Draco's first text to him.
"Stop doing things you don’t want to
in his gut that isn’t related to his cock, that comes from a hunger more primal, and infinitely more deadly. The blood that pumps in his veins is flush with dark particles, whatever it is that makes a vampire tick and keeps him hungry for human blood. Draco won’t give in to that. Of all the things in this world, this he can say with complete confidence and conviction.
. It's been a while since he had sex, but it's not been a while since he's tugged himself off. There's no reason for it to have been so intense.
“Sexy,” Harry interrupted, ignoring the amused lilt of Draco’s voice. “I look sexy and like you wanna come in me.”
Potter remains nonplussed. "Like what, you want money?"
Draco’s stomach clenches, his hand stilling. His insides twist. He can’t think of a single thing to say. This is far from the longest conversation they’ve had since they started meeting here, but it’s the first time Draco’s been terrified by it.
Draco’s reply is just as quick.
"Like." Harry licks his lips, unsure of what he wants to say, if he even needs to. He wants to hear it, though. "Is it just right now?"
"Ah, shit," says Harry out loud, sagging in his chair. That clearly didn’t work, then. He needs to think of a reply that is somehow dismissive, clever and friendly all at once. He’s basically settled on sending a very mature response of
Draco pointedly eyes Harry’s short, cropped hair. Harry runs a hand over the familiar blunt strands. Draco’s eyes are smiling, and he can see there’s no barbs in the comment, which is welcome. He’s been shaving his hair short for at least four years now, and it's been a while since someone implored him to grow it back.
Agatha wrinkles her nose at Harry’s manners. "Depends." She sets her tea cup down, then takes a biscuit for herself. "Can we get a curry? And do you have wine?"
“Smart lad.” Draco kneels onto the bed, still naked. “I’m sure you can deduce the second thing as well, then.” He rubs his eye, a habit of his when tired, and brushes his hair back away from his face.
Potter breathes out on a laugh. "I don't want you to fuck off." He's smiling still. Draco likes the sight of it so much. Potter sighs. "You did listen to me last night, didn't you." He's not asking. His voice sounds resigned, but Draco hears that he's seeking confirmation all the same.
Draco shrugged, still smiling lazily. He flopped a hand in a careless gesture. “As good as one, though. Malfoy men are very virile.”
"It wouldn’t bother you if men were my type, or specifically if
Draco huffed what might have been a laugh. “Harry, you look ―”
Draco shakes his head. “Leave it.” Draco pushes himself upright, then leans his weight fully onto Harry’s thighs as he stands. He’s right; his pyjama bottoms are a mess of lube and drying come, a damp patch at Draco’s groin where he came. He holds his hands out for Harry to take them. “Let’s just move beds, deal with this in the morning.” He pulls Harry upright against him. “And Nettle won’t sleep without me in there with her,” he adds, almost shyly.
“You want to come in me,” Harry continued, determined to both get Draco off and see exactly how far he could take this whole new strain of dirty talk. Apparently he was into it. Harry was always a fan of riding new kinks out. “Getting me messy, knocking me up.”
even while lugging a small human around inside him and bursting at the seams, thank you very much, Deputy Head Auror Stephens. Harry knew the fucker was eyeing his job, what with all the faux-nice comments about how Harry was
Harry isn't especially vocal in bed, or he never has been before. He isn't silent, far from it, but he's never wanted to moan into a kiss like he does now, or to whine like he does when Draco slips him tongue. Harry's forehead creases, his own fingers tangling in the soft strands of Draco's hair as he pulls Draco closer. Draco’s fingers move to his neck as he kisses Harry again, and again, until Harry's lips feel bruised with it. He clutches Draco's hair tighter.
"They've really committed, haven't they?" Potter's voice is close to Draco's ear as he leans in. His breath ghosts along Draco's neck. "Of all the dodgy places I've been, I think this might be… the dodgiest. In every sense of the word."
"Yeah." Draco huffs a laugh. "That's what I was expecting it to feel like."
Dean then nodded as well. "No one deserved to be treated that way."
"Fine. Who's the PERSON those two raped?"
"I told you, I need to research on my Arithmancy. And any books on the topic that we discussed in DADA just now. Professor Lupin is sure to assign us an essay at the end of the week. Might as well be prepared for it." Hermione answered.
"Remember the bell? Got the house elves to dig a carpet out for us. They'll give Ron anything." Hermione grinned.
Dinner found Draco waiting alone at the Gryffindor table for all the other Gryffindors. Gryffindors from different years walked past the silvery blond who was sitting quite near the doors. Most of them had curious looks on their faces instead of disgusted looks he had gotten the previous years as a Slytherin. Draco noticed, wondering if he himself had mellowed since he moved to Gryffindor.
Everyone was thinking about the issue that had been raised. Professor Lupin spoke up. "Yes, a very thin line was drawn between the dark and light magic. And as you all know, human beings have the tendency to move the line when it suits them. Which is why all of you have to have the ability to examine your own actions. Any other points to bring up?"
"Tell me."
"It means no more prefect meetings. No Quidditch too. That means I got more time. Maybe I should ask Professor Snape about the extra credit assignments." Draco frowned.
Their animagus transformation lessons were very painful. They had to first train themselves to clear their minds to learn to concentrate. Then they attempted to change their limbs into paws. The shifting of the bones within their body during the change was really painful, but as they practiced, they got used to the pain. The trick was to expect the pain. Then when the whole process was practiced to shorten the time needed and lessened the pain, Sirius had them attempt to transform their body as well, into forming the panther's body, and tail. The final change incorporated was their head, which was even more painful then before, because every single bone in the head had to move, and even their teeth had to be changed. Within the last two months, they had only been able to change into the full panther twice, and that was during the previous week's lessons. Both Sirius and Professor Dumbledore were impressed by the speed in which they had used to learn the skill, and all they had to do was to perfect the skill such that it was as natural as what Sirius could do.
"Dray… I didn't hurt you, did I?" Harry asked hesitantly. Draco shook his head as tears continued to leak from his mercury eyes. Harry concentrated on the emotions that Draco was radiating, getting contentment, love, happiness and a whole load of positive feelings. "You are happy?" Draco nodded. "Because you are here?" A nod. "With me?" Another nod. Harry smiled. "I'll always be with you. I'm never leaving you alone. It's hard to believe, because I'm feeling the same here and … I love you, Draco." Draco smiled and gave Harry a small kiss on his lips, while sending another wave of love through their link.
"Why the long face?" She heard, startling her, as she whipped around, to see Draco and Harry lounging at the door of the locker room.
Hermione gasped, snatched the map from their hands and looked at it. She then turned her pale face to the two equally pale boys. She then turned to the panel, pressed the button for it to open, with the other people in the room rushing behind her, heading towards the flickering dot on the map.
Draco took Day's other hand and lifted it up to his cheek, brushing the back of her hand with his cheek. "We'll never think that you are dirty. Just because that happened to you did not mean that YOU are the one at fault. It's THEM who are at fault. Not you. Remember what we said? We'll never leave you alone for the rest of your life even if you are tired of us."
“Okay fine, no contract. But still, we should decide a few things. Are we...like if anyone asks, should I...”
Yarney shoved Draco roughly into a chair, then pulled the blindfold off. Draco blinked for a few moments, adjusting to his surroundings. The room he was in had a greenish tinge from moss growing on the walls. It was freezing in here, and only got colder with each step Yarney took away from Draco. There were metal plates on the ground—presumably to hold chains in place for prisoners—and a simple table in front of Draco with another chair. The room was barren apart from that.
Harry scoffed. “I bet my house elf would love his head planted right by the portrait of Sirius’s mum.” He then looked at Draco, with them both still being hand in hand. “Maybe you could come over? Over Christmas. And help with the house and some other things.”
“Well you could jeopardize your life doing that, not to mention ours!” Narcissa rarely raised her voice with Draco, and he cowered a little. She seemed to realize that she had become angry, and morphed her expression back into one that Draco could more easily recognize. “I’m sorry, sweetheart, I’m not upset with you. It’s just a stressful situation, that’s all. You’re—you’re all the Malfoys have left. I know that’s a lot of pressure, but it’s true. Even if your father and I make it through our retrial, we’re going to be social outcasts. You’re the only hope this family has.”
TRIGGER WARNING: Blood, mention of suicide
“Mr. Malfoy?” A nice, middle-aged woman in a navy blue blazer came out of the trunk side door. Draco stood up, feeling shaky. She smiled at him and led him down a long hallway. Though this was St. Mungo’s, there was no medical smell. Rather, Draco could smell lavender in the air, which calmed him down a little during the short walk to the Mind Healer’s office. The room was comfortable enough—a nice plush couch awaited him with a chair for the Healer across from it. It was dimly lit but in a serene way, and motivational posters lined the walls along with accent, non-moving art pieces. “Please, take a seat,” the Healer said.
“Who did teach you, then?” Harry looked confused. “Your mum?”
“We all could have. But you’re
Harry stared and Draco’s outstretched hand, but didn’t take the blanket. “Hold on to it for now, I mostly sweat at night anyway.”
“First of all
—were waiting for him, and they all walked to the Great Hall together. Draco was grateful that his friends took up a slow pace for him, and was even more grateful that the walk was mostly downstairs. There was so much hustle and bustle that no one seemed to pay the group much mind. And, after all, four individuals were certainly more formidable opponents than Draco by himself. They managed to make it to the Great Hall without trouble.
Dolohov’s evil smile faded into a glare. “He and his cowardly parents think they can just be the Ministry’s little pets. Turning in other people who helped our cause, without taking any punishments themselves. They know more than they’re letting on, too. And we can’t have any squealers. But I know even ol’ Lucius will bargain for him,” Dolohov said the final word with disgust.
Draco was silent for a few steps. “I just ran into her, after I went out to get some air yesterday.”
“I’m sure they won’t mind more players,” Daphne said. “If they do, we can always just sit and watch, be the scorekeepers or something.”
“Can’t use magic.” Draco couldn’t even begin to process the fact that both Harry Potter and Hermione Granger were in his bedroom right now, the fact that once again, Potter had saved his life. He closed his eyes again.
It was incredibly hard to tell whether Draco’s racing heart was from physical exertion or from terror. He finally made it to the front door and was reaching for the knocker when his mother flung it open.
“I recall no such conversation,” Lucius folded his arms. “We clearly do not want the same thing right now.”
Draco felt restless and helpless. He decided to go out into the common room and get a cup of tea. He flung his covers aside and closed the bedroom door behind him, not bothering to be soft so as not to wake Harry.
Draco smiled back. “I promise I’ll be more careful.”
Draco refuses to leave the Ministry without seeing his mother. He also learns the full extent of Harry’s “saving-people thing”.
His main concerns were two. His first was the upcoming holidays. He was going to home to both of his parents since his father was no longer required to go back to Azkaban. Draco had some apprehension about seeing his father again. The visit at St. Mungo’s had not gone well. Lucius had been openly hostile, and he claimed that he knew a secret about Draco. Did Lucius know about Draco’s relationship with Harry? It wouldn’t surprise Draco, but what did surprise him was the fact that Lucius had not taken any action against it. Certainly that would change over the break. Harry also seemed to want Draco to visit the Burrow with him, which is where the Weasley family dwelled. Draco knew that they were a part of Harry’s family, but he wasn’t sure he could stomach a dinner with people he had insulted every chance he got only a year or two prior.
Whew! We’re certainly not done seeing Draco’s parents (after all, we still have to find out what happens to Lucius), but I think we’ll go back to Hogwarts now to develop Draco and Harry’s relationship. 80k words overall without even one good kiss is like 80k too many. So I think we only have a chapter or two before that happens...
I’m still alive!!! So sorry guys, things with the COVID escalated fast. Now I’m safely at home from college and hope to finish this fic in the next few weeks. Not sure what’ll happen after that! Comments are always appreciated. I hope everyone is safe.
“We refused, obviously. We took the day to think about it, and when Nott returned the next day, we informed him of our decision.”
“The conversation stays in the notebook though, so it isn’t dark magic. I’m honestly surprised that no one has thought of it sooner. This way, we’ll be able to stay in touch while you’re gone. There are a few limitations though—you can only write up to two sentences at a time before the other person has to respond in turn. But it’s faster than sending letters.”
As it was Friday evening, the hallways were blissfully empty and Draco had an uneventful walk down to the Hospital Wing. The last time he was here was in his sixth year after Potter split his skin open in dozens of places with that curse he used. Draco remembered lying on the floor, only barely aware of what had just happened, and frankly, ready to die. His last thought before his swimming vision registered Professor Snape healing him was about his mother.
. He focused his attention back on Professor McGonagall and dug his fingernails into his arm. “What are the consequences if I refuse?”
“Yeah, yeah.” Draco sprung to his feet, suddenly nervous. “I just...I was wondering if perhaps I could have a word. Professor,” he added lamely at the end, wanting to remember his courtesies.
Blaise, Greg, and Daphne looked a little nervous to be left alone with Granger and Longbottom, but all nodded and swiftly went away.
“What should our first stop be? Three Broomsticks?” Longbottom asked.
“Business is booming, thankfully. Everyone seems ready to get back into a good mood again.”
“What do you mean?”
“Sure. I’ll see you back next week. Have a wonderful day, Draco.”
“Oh,” Harry looked down. “I lived with my aunt and uncle, and they didn’t like me one bit. Thought I was a right nuisance. Before I had a growth spurt, I lived in the cupboard under their stairs.”
“That’ll be nice for her, in a bit,” Blaise said softly.
“Dragon, it’s okay. I’ll see you soon. I love you.” Yarney didn’t say a word as Narcissa took one final glance at her son before the door was shut and Draco was locked in once again.
“What about my mother? Do you know if she’s alright?”
“Welcome back, Mr. Malfoy. I trust you survived the experience?”
Harry shrugged. “I guess that’s what they’re trying to find out. They must have something to do with it though, if Dolohov tried to kidnap you to get to them.”
“Wha—what’s wrong?” Harry started to reach for his glasses and his wand.

“That doesn’t really answer my question,” Draco said in a cool, even tone.
. If the Dementors were bothering him this much when they were at least a floor apart from him, how were his parents feeling?
“Leave him out of your project Granger, I don’t care.” Draco felt shame in his gut. Vincent would not have died if Draco hadn’t dragged him to the Room of Requirement on that night. Shouldn’t he be sticking up for his friend? Even if his friend did terrible things?
So that’s what Ginny was doing in the woods! What do you think they’re going to do with Draco? Do you think Harry is going to rescue him, or is he going to have to save himself?
“Okay yeah, let’s say you didn’t show up. Then what? A big fight was inevitable, he wasn’t going to let Muggle sympathizers like McGonagall or even some half-bloods stay at Hogwarts for long. There was nothing you could have done differently that would have made things better. Actually, I think you prevented a lot more deaths by showing up when you did.”
And so, Draco invited his friends into his room and back into his life. They talked for hours about things both large and small, and he felt his heart grow with the ebb and flow of the conversation. Possibly the new family the remaining Slytherins had made would fill the gap in his heart that his parents once occupied.
. Draco’s stomach lurched when he saw the front page.
“Just give yourself whatever time you need. No pressure this year, all you gotta do is pass through.”
As the class applauded the demonstration, Draco’s hands started to shake. Harry began his introduction, describing how the Patronus charm had been incredibly useful to him over the years. Draco tried to gather up all the happy memories in his head—but found he had a new one to focus on. While his previous one still made him smile, there was only one memory that lit him up from the inside out.
Draco took it, his voice filled with emotion. Harry acted as though Draco was no longer disliked on both sides, but Draco knew the truth. “It is well-deserved.”
“Let’s try something different,” Harry said patiently.
Putting his hand on the doorknob, Harry turned to face Draco. “We’ll see.” And with that he walked out the door.
Draco stared oddly at Harry, but the latter seemed too agitated for Draco to argue. Once he was sufficiently close to Harry, the young man pulled the blanket around both of them, covering their whole bodies. Draco could still see through the fabric, but the world shimmered a bit. “Is this an Invisibility Cloak?”
“I’m sorry. You’re right,” Daphne said, though Greg hadn’t really said anything that warranted an agreement. “We need to stick together, not argue with each other.”
Draco scoffed. “Thanks very much Potter but I’m not going to give you that power.”
is that Harry
Harry rolled his eyes but did not look unhappy as Draco dragged him out of the eighth year dorms, bundled him up, and nearly pushed him into the fresh air. “What in the world—“
This chapter ends Harry and Draco’s adventures at Hogwarts, for now at least! The next three chapters will take place over the holiday break. Thank you all for continuing to support me, and most importantly, I hope you are all safe. Much love to everyone, and as always, comments are appreciated.
. “Oh,” Draco said. He shouldn’t be surprised. Vincent and Greg spent nearly all of their free time together. Draco had never seen them kiss or anything, but they were always playfully shoving each other. Besides, Draco was too focused on himself to really notice what others were doing around him. “I—I think that would have been nice.”
“Like, how public is this going to be? How often should I take you out? How often should we reexamine the relationship? The standard stuff.”
And we’re done with this part of the series! I NEVER thought I would make it this far, so thank you all for reading it. The next series will start January 1, 2020, and we’ll take it as far as we can! Let me know if there’s anything you want to see. I hope you all have happy holidays, and make sure to look out for the next part. Love to all! I can’t thank you enough for coming on this journey with me.
. We can see how our date goes and go forth from there.”
“Oh. No problem then. I think Hermione wanted to go this weekend anyway to get some gifts for the Weasley’s.”
Draco wasn’t going to stick around to hear the end of this argument. “Out of my way,” he said quietly, and began to move past them. He wasn’t scared of the two young Ravenclaws exactly—he had been tortured many times before. But he knew that he wasn’t able to defend himself, and didn’t want to slink back to his Slytherin barely-friends injured or weakened.
“Draco, what happened? What happened in your nightmare?” Harry was really concerned.
Dean and Ginny shared a look, and then Dean went to a nearby table and picked up a small package. He handed it to Draco—it had his name on it in familiar handwriting. Draco turned it over and found that the seal had been broken. He looked inside to see a small clock hanging on a golden chain...
“It’s no use trying to get through to him, Minerva,” a familiar voice drawled behind her. “He has a tight rein on any emotion that doesn’t allow him to exude arrogance.” Draco tensed, recognizing the hurt in his former mentor’s voice.
. Draco looked around at the disgusting establishment he found himself in.
There were murmurs throughout the courtroom, and Draco saw various reporters scratching at their notepads. Apparently they had anticipated that Draco would be called as a witness, or that
“And why not?”
That sent a pain through Draco’s heart. Ironically, Draco fully believed Harry at the time because he knew that his father had visited the graveyard on the night of Cedric Diggory’s death. But instead of supporting Harry, Draco had mocked him mercilessly and tried to discredit him to the press. “I know,” Draco said. “I’m so, so sorry.”
Draco pushed open the bathroom door and stepped unsteadily into the still empty living room. The world tilted beneath his feet and he stumbled, hitting his side on a table. He sank to the floor, feeling nauseous. There was no way he could make it to the Hospital Wing—he had lost too much blood to make it down five flights of stairs.
“Did Dumbledore know about this?” Draco asked one day after Harry showed him a memory of spending one of his earlier birthdays ill with pneumonia and not taken care of.
Kingsley nodded thoughtfully when Draco was finished. “I appreciate your honesty. The Aurors and myself have decided that your parents will not return to Azkaban, so long as they continue to cooperate with the Ministry. However, the wards will remain on your home for at least five years, and your parents will be on house arrest for an additional year.” Draco nodded—that seemed fair, and he didn’t want to push his luck. “In the meantime, if you hear from young Theo Nott again, you will be required to turn the letter in to the Ministry.”
“Dragon! You’re here!” She shuffled him into the household before he could get a good look at her, and began to babble a little uncharacteristically. “They didn’t tell me when you’d be arriving and I can’t do magic now, so the house is a mess. I send Tilly to do things, but you know, I can’t actually order her to do them so it’s been a little difficult. But here—sit down.”
Draco nodded in appreciation. He glanced out the window and was startled to recognize some of the scenery—they were almost to Platform 9 and 3/4. “I’ll be back.” Draco slipped away and went to the compartment where Harry was with his friends. Harry met his eyes and immediately went out toward Draco. They both stepped toward the gallery where they could watch the trees rush by.
Draco had wondered what would happen after his confession that his tongue had been cut out sometime during the war. He spent the next few days avoiding the rest of the eighth-years, both afraid that they would think his memory insufficient for giving him a break and afraid that they would pity him. He didn’t want sympathy or concern from the other students, because he had truly done despicable things that he needed to answer for. He just wanted an understanding, an acknowledgement that though he had certain privileges, he also had disadvantages, and didn’t enjoy himself over the past year.
“Potter, stop.” Draco turned to Madame Rosmerta. “I’ll leave. Sorry for the trouble.”
“Dunno. Probably going to study some more.”
Without knowing why, Draco quickly moved and flung open the compartment door, finding himself looking down at three small first year girls, clutching notepads and portable quills to their chests. “Your stupid Savior isn’t here.” The girls looked horrified, likely both by his manner of greeting them and by the fact that he was Draco Malfoy, the only student Death Eater. “Go bother someone else.” He slammed the door shut and slumped back down.
Comments are appreciated! You guys should really look forward to the next one ;)
One more left in this series!!! I’ll be sad to see this part go, but I’m also drowning in final exams. The chapter should be out by Friday, and then that’ll be it until January 1st!
“Sure. Whatever. Anything but talking.” Draco was incredibly relieved to be talking to a reasonable person.
He and his friends gathered their things and exited the classroom. “I think I’m going to have a lie-down,” Draco said.
She frowned. “Why is that?”
Harry tore his gaze away from his parents’ carved names. “How do you know that?”
“Well, enjoy having these problems, I suppose. Guys, girls, I’m sure whoever and whatever would line up for a chance to date the Boy Who Lived.”
“That’s because he doesn’t know if you like him! Fevered confessions of love aren’t the same thing as sitting down with someone with your entire mental faculties intact and telling them how you feel.” Draco wasn’t sure what Granger was saying about fevered confessions of love, but she had a point. Maybe he should tell Potter how he felt. What’s the worst that could happen? “My point is,” Granger continued. “He’s not going to talk to you about it, regardless of how many hints you drop. He’s clueless. So it’s up to you.”
. “He’d never be a burden to me. Not ever.”
Draco smiled, excited at the prospect of spending time with Harry. “Of course!”
"I know." Draco kisses him, deeply and properly, for a long heady moment before he pulls back. He places a hand on Harry’s chest when Harry tries to follow him, chasing his lips. "I’m
"Oh shit, there, there," he babbles. Draco hums, pulling off Harry's cock for a moment to catch his breath. He brushes the same spot again, wanking Harry's prick with his free hand, the way slicked with Draco's spit. "Oh,
“Right, just for that, Harry, you can sleep on the floor.”
"You did seem rather loggish, yes."
Upstairs in the guest room Harry's made his own, he ruffles through the clothes Ginny bought. Harry's shirt and work trousers are clean enough still, despite the two days of wear, but he's itching for a change. He pulls out a pair of well worn joggers and a grey vest, sparing a wistful glance at the pyjamas Draco lent him. There's no reason to wear them again, now that Harry has his own set with him. He dithers for a moment, slipping out of the trousers and into clean pants (heaven) and the joggers. At the last minute, he decides fuck it and tosses the vest aside. He pulls on the cream Henley top instead; if Draco comments, Harry will simply lie and say it was comfortable, not that the smell of Draco's clothes makes his cock thicken. No one needs to know about that.
That's all he does.
At least she doesn’t yell at him, and seems genuinely quite interested in what Harry’s come up with as an alternative to, you know. Doing the things he definitely promised, and is contractually obliged, to complete for her. She even gives him a big hug afterwards, and whispers that she
Harry takes a deep gulp of his tea, then tries to return to his own breakfast.
Everything slips out of focus when Draco leans in to kiss him on the cheek. He pulls back and then does it again, pressing his mouth gently against Harry’s other cheek. His lips are so soft. Harry’s head swims.
"Fuck, Harry."
Dying has done wonders for his world view.
already thinking it. It's hard to imagine a person disappearing without a trace without assuming the bleak worst.
It wasn’t until Ron joked that it made people think he was having some kind of breakdown that Harry realised two things: firstly, that people were unsettled by this intentional removal of something they saw as so attractive about him, so iconic of the boy they watched grow up. And secondly, that he kind of
Potter makes another sound that Draco feels rumble over his lips rather than hears, before he's pulling Draco away to the side. Draco dizzily rubs the back of his hand over his mouth and once more lets himself be led. It's an exhilarating feeling.
"Why do you want to know that?" Potter asks, eyes narrowing.
But he could still do his job fine without one. It just meant that he kept asking to smell Laura’s during staff debriefings. Harry did also find he couldn't go out on the field without feeling the need to apologise to the baby every step of the way. And he was definitely still mortified about the time he’d spilled some of a Confidius Reduction on his stomach and had to Floo home in a panic to ask Draco if he could accidentally give a baby some kind of damage via osmosal potion absorption.
Draco, lost in thought as he gazes out over the dark marshland, starts slightly. “What, what do you want now, Potter?”
“Yes,” Draco stretched again. “We just discussed this, didn’t we?”
Draco leaned up onto his elbows. “Make m ―
Potter takes them past Old Town, to a club Draco has avoided going to before. The line is surprisingly short, and the bouncer waves them through with friendly disinterest. It's starkly different to the place they've just visited, larger and more recently furnished. It's packed, the dirty thump of the music winding its way up Draco's soles and sinuously rattling his bones. The press of people around them is immediate, shirtless men and bright-eyed youths, high-heeled queens and steel-capped kings holding court on the dancefloor and amidst the throngs of glistening drinkers at the bars.
Potter's hands snake up the back of his top, under his desperately too-hot jacket to touch equally warm skin, and Draco suppressed a shiver. Potter's thigh presses against Draco's thickening cock and his kisses falter as he breathes out a groan. Draco feels the vibrations of it across his lips, through the fingers he has spread over Potter's neck. Their rhythm doesn't falter, settling into a deeper grind. Potter's fingers press against the small of Draco's back as their hips roll against each other to the pounding bass of the music.
Draco kissed the back of Harry’s shoulder, a quiet brush of lips over skin. “Night, Harry.”
Potter catches Draco staring, and Draco holds his gaze for a long moment. He turns so they're no longer side by side against the dark wall, but he makes sure they're still no less close. The movement brings him into Potter's space. It's no accident.
Draco offers him a wry smile. "Thank you, Harry." He sits. Harry motions for Draco to pour the tea. They lapse into an awkward silence, which only ends when Draco makes an annoyed grunt.
On a hunch, Draco tightens both hands again, just the slightest increase of pressure, and hears Potter let out a high and needy gasp. His breathing is erratic and frantic as he presses his face into Draco’s belly, his free hand still hanging onto the open waist of Draco’s jeans as if for dear life. Dracp does it again, alternating between gentle strokes and tight pulls, following the hitches of Potter’s breath as he does. Potter’s entire body feels tense, his muscles straining towards release, and he lets out a deep and guttural groan as he rises up onto his knees. The sound is buried against Draco’s belly as Potter comes, his breathing hot and damp against Draco’s bare skin. Draco spreads his fingers through Potter’s hair, soothing and calming, as Potter comes down from the high of orgasm. It’s a full minute of Potter’s laboured breathing, the slow tremble of aftershocks running over his shoulders, before Draco hears Potter mutter a quiet spell. The zing of the Cleaning Charm running over his lower half is startling and unexpected, as is the realisation Potter has cast this wandlessly. Potter mutters the same spell again for himself, for the mess over his own hand and groin, before he looks up at Draco. He slowly moves both hands to tuck Draco’s soft cock away, to do the button and fly of his jeans back up again. It’s so surprisingly intimate, being put back together when Potter just recently took him apart, that Draco finds it hard to breath. He keeps his hands in Potter’s hair, holds his eye contact as Potter finishes. He eventually stands with a shaky motion, coming face to face with Draco.
Draco shrugged again. “Something great.” He ran his hand over Harry’s stomach. Harry laughed again, his smile turning soft.
Harry laughs, and the sound croaks out of him even as he tries to muffle it into his palm. They’re already on the thinnest of ice with their Healer, it seems, and they probably ought not to be goading him so much, but still. This situation feels stupid, this bond is stupid, and Harry has developed two rather bad habits recently: finding Draco funny, and giggling during serious discussions. The second habit is usually very closely related to the first, it seems.
“No.” Harry glared at the shape of the wardrobe. He sighed. He was being moody. And he did want a wank. “Sorry I woke you,” he said.
So, avoiding the light of day is essential. Sleeping during this time is not―and sleeping in a coffin is absolutely not required, unless Draco is inclined to be particularly dramatic. He finds dozing during the day calming though—it soothes something in him. Something
He thinks about waiting a bit to send his reply, so that it won’t be painfully obvious he was sitting there waiting for the message, but in the end he figures, fuck it. He thumbs the send button.
“It's not dark. The lamp’s on.” Harry inclines his head behind him, indicating the bedside. His fingers scrunch against the bed covers as his arms bears his weight behind him. “What were you doing?” he asks, moving his other hand away from his waistband and resting it back behind him. The change in position opens him up even more, his arms behind him and his legs parted. He watches the bob of Draco's Adam's apple as he swallows. He wants to lick at the dip of Draco's flushed throat. His mouth waters with it.
"Nothing." Potter huffs out a laugh. "Just. You're good at this."
’. He’s sure Potter gets it, regardless.
Draco shrugs, crossing one leg over the other and letting his foot dangle. “I can think of worse things to wake up to.”
Draco shakes his head, still trying to digest this information. "I doubt my father did, either," he says honestly. His opinion of his father is presently lower than dirt, and he’s certain the diary was deliberately given to the Weaselette, but still. Draco doesn’t think his father knew about what it really was.
, he reminds himself.
"I want to." Draco presses his hand against Harry's sternum, lets it slide down his chest. A duel shudder runs through them as Draco pinches at Harry's nipple. "Fuck. Can I, Harry?"
Harry frowns. “Really?” Draco nods, and Harry goes on. “I thought maybe I was obvious.”
"Well." Draco taps the nib of his quill on his parchment in three short motions, before he drops it. He faces Potter properly. "I know someone there. I was thinking about it, while you slept. She… could know something useful. Merlin knows she owes me enough favours to tell us what she does know, anyway. We could go there. Together. If you like."
Draco turns his sneer, preciously aimed at the room, towards Potter. "No," he says crisply. "Just because I drink blood doesn’t mean I have no taste, Harry."
Draco’s message just says,
Potter stops briefly, shooting Draco the withering glance that his question rightfully deserves. Draco ploughs on regardless.
“Porkies.” Harry grins at Draco, still wriggling around as he tries to get comfortable on the blasted log. “Look at you, you’ve gone all Cockney.”
Darya is a necromancer.
Either way, Draco likes seeing him here too much to risk upsetting their unexpected gentle truce, and their late night garden meetings, by bringing up difficult subjects. He can feel his cheeks heating even as he thinks it.
He’s not looking at the marsh anymore. He’s staring fixedly up at the night sky.
Harry groans.
Draco swallows, momentarily blindsided by the compliment. "At what, Potter?" Draco clears his throat, fighting the flush of colour that wants to spread from his neck and trip over his cheeks. "At staring down surly barmen and remembering puerile code?"
"Just right now?" he asks, leaning back a lot as Draco's kisses slip lower. Harry's breathing is heavy around the wet sensation of Draco's lips.
Potter's well-researched notes are just as barren in this regard. They are instructive, but devoid of any revealing clues. Draco wonders if they were created specifically to be given to him, and if there are another set of far more revealing notes sequestered away somewhere in Potter’s accommodation. Notes with scribbles in the margins, with more details about why Potter is looking for someone like Darya, why Potter has been following a chain of people to get to her―what exactly he’s searching for answers to. Merlin knows, Draco’s case notes are always covered in tangents and details.
Harry replies, wracking his brains for the few things he might know about Australia. Dudley, and for a while there his Aunt Petunia, used to be mad for an Australian soap opera, and Harry can vaguely recall a lot of beaches and very attractive people having dramas and outdoor meals and owning a lot of bathing suits.
He slips under the sheets as Draco flicks the lamp off with a wave of his hand. Harry sighs at the feeling of soft, clean bed covers against his bare skin. He’s not sure if Draco’s had them recently laundered, or if it’s just the fact that Harry’s always found being in someone else's bed to be an exciting experience, but they feel cool and crisp against his warm skin. He stretches his legs out as he lies on his back, rolling his shoulders to try and settle himself to sleep. Beside him, Draco faces the wall, his back to Harry. Harry stares at the sharp silhouette of Draco’s shoulder in the dark, wanting to curl up behind him, but not quite sure of how it would be received.
Draco feels no threat, now that he understands this broken part of Potter that creeps out in the dark night and finds foothold in dreams. He's struck with the heaviest melancholy for this being, and for the one who is no doubt still sleeping beside him. Draco has no basis of comparison for Potter's life and the experiences he's been shaped by. They are so unique, so unusual, such a mixture of tragedy and success. But this seems especially cruel, even for a boy orphaned before he could speak, even for someone who has lost as much as Harry has. Draco doesn't understand what carrying the Horcrux, the shrivelled and putrid shard of Voldemort's own caustic soul, has done to Harry. It's unmistakable, though, that it's left a hollow where it once was, a void that hasn't been filled. A fracture in what was once a perfect whole.
Beside him, Potter laughs under his breath. "Not your kind of place?" he jokes, softly. The room doesn't appear to be affecting him the way it is Draco. Draco's oddly glad of that; Potter is the most powerful wizard Draco's ever met. He can't help but feel safe around him, whether that's currently merited or not. Of course, magical ability aside, if Potter doesn't find this club repugnant then he is clearly still an imbecile.
Potter sucks cock like he loves it. Draco doesn't mind it himself. It's fun, it's good, it's hot. But it's not at the top of his list of things to do with someone else, unless the mood particularly strikes him. It’s never something he’s desperate to give. Potter sucks cock like he’s
“It’s not an ideal place for a drop off, though.” Harry frowns. “I'm surprised they’re taking the tip seriously.”
“A connection,” Harry repeats, barely a mumble. “How does…” he trails off, unsure of the words he needs to force the question in his mind out loud. He feels somewhat overwhelmed.
“Morning, Potter,” Draco says, slightly stiffly. He clears his throat, then gestures to the seat opposite him. “Hungry?”
And at worst, it’ll chew up all his indoor plants and throw up on his bed in the morning, and then Harry’ll have the inspiration for a sequel.
Harry made a face. “Okay, first,
Draco laughed again, incredulous and pink-cheeked as he stared down at Harry. “Okay, if that’s what you ―”
Draco cringes, cheeks flushing again. "Oh god, yes, sorry, I’m being incredibly impertinent. I just, I got here a while ago and"—Draco’s hair falls over his ears and into his face as he gesticulates while he talks—"sort of took over your house, I guess." He makes a face at himself.
Potter groans, deep and throaty, when Draco slightly tightens his fingers in Potter’s hair, and Draco loses it. He lets out a low and almost silent moan as he spills into Potter’s mouth, feels Potter swallow frantically around him. Potter breathes out through his nose in desperate puffs but doesn’t move away. He stays until Draco has finished, sucking him down and breathing heavily, until Draco has to pull him away from his twitching cock. Draco's entire body is on edge from the aftershocks, small jolts of pleasure still coursing through him. Potter kisses the base of Draco’s softening cock, then at his belly. He’s breathing hard, letting out soft moans on every other exhale and Draco slowly sees, through the fading fog of orgasm, that Potter’s hand is moving between his legs. He pulls himself off in quick, fast motions, with the kind of efficiency that comes with being right on the edge. He can’t pull his eyes away from Potter’s hand, the way it fits between his spread legs. He can see the glistening, flushed tip of Potter’s cock in quick glimpses when Potter’s hand moves just so, and Draco cards his fingers through Potter’s hair, stroking him gently.
Draco has no idea how to react to this.
“Fuck me. That was...” Draco trailed off, leaning his weight onto one arm and wiggling the other hand down between them. He began to stroke Harry’s aching cock. The touch was ― oh,
When he opens the backdoor that evening, he finds that the cat is waiting for him, blinking benevolently after having apparently ripped up Harry’s herb bed. He can see what looks like flower petals hanging out of its mouth, which means it's had a go at the geraniums, too. Lovely. Harry decides to let it in anyway. At best, he’ll have some company while he doesn’t write a book.
“You sleep naked,” Harry answers, stepping closer. He doesn’t usually, himself, but Draco hasn't offered him more night clothes, seeming to throw hospitality out the window the more tired he gets. Harry decides he’ll sleep naked tonight, too.
The barman ambles over, and Draco's words dry up on his tongue, evaporating like all unspent emotion does. Draco swallows the bitter taste away.
When Potter does return, Draco feels elated, but Potter's mood is distinctly different. His face is stony as he strides away from the room the barman led him to. Draco thinks he catches a glimpse of a face behind it, someone tall, a flash of crimson silk―but the curtain is flicked shut quickly behind Potter. Potter doesn't look back, glowering ahead and making a beeline for the door. Draco quickly stands, afraid Potter is going to walk right out and leave him behind. He looks pissed off enough to do it.
“Mm.” Harry tilted his head back, rolling forward against Draco's hand.
Draco doesn't tease this time, moving his lips down over Harry's prick. His mouth is hot, perfect, and Harry's own mouth waters. He laughs, breathless, when he realises what it is he's feeling―Draco's mouth between his own legs, mirrored for Harry. Harry writhes against the bed, sucking on his own tongue. He nearly chokes on it when Draco's fingers brush his prostate.
The door to The Opal Cauldron is deceptively dull. Little flecks of dust come off on the backs of Draco’s knuckles as he raps them against it in the specific rhythm needed to gain him entry. His mouth twists in distaste as he flicks his fingers to cast the dust away; someone has clearly been overdoing the Concealing Charms here. There’s no need for the door to be bloody disintegrating off its hinges. He tucks his hands back into the pockets of his jacket. It’s tan leather, coming to his waist bomber style. The evening isn’t quite chilly enough to warrant a jacket, considering he’s wearing a long-sleeved white shirt underneath, however it’ll be cold later. Draco will likely be out until the wee hours of the morning, before he needs to retire to avoid the sunrise.
, for Potter. Is it loneliness, boredom, curiosity? That he sees in Draco a sense of shared history, or just a familiar face in a foreign country? Draco doesn’t know what exactly brought Potter back to this same table to wait for Draco, but he’s sure it’s more than just wanting to make sure Draco keeps his mouth shut about seeing him. There’s no way Potter has managed to keep off the radar this long based just on asking people and goodwill alone. There's something else there. Draco sees it on Potter’s face as he shifts in his chair, mulling Draco’s words over. He looks slightly caught out, but not upset. Perhaps even he didn’t realise there was more to this until Draco put words to it.
mean?” Draco leans back himself, arms folded across his chest. “What does Shakespeare have to do with this?”
Harry sighed in relief, nodding enthusiastically. “Yeah, do it.”
Potter blinks several times as if composing himself. He looks like he is struggling with what he is about to say.
, don’t think about that. Harry scrunched his face up, his cock hard and dripping, leaving a wet smear against his belly.
Draco's finished jotting down his notes and sipping on his tea when Potter stirs. His hair is a riot, having been slightly damp when he went to sleep, and there are pillow creases on his cheeks. He rubs at his eyes and then reaches for his glasses on the side table. He looks around the room, seeming vaguely surprised to take in his surroundings, and for the briefest moment Draco wonders if Potter will regret this. Regret talking to Draco about such personal things, regret sleeping with him, regret all of it. It's a horrifying thought, and thankfully one that dissipates as Potter looks at Draco and smiles. Draco smiles back, relieved and pleased. He twirls the feather quill in his fingers, the nib resting against his paper pad. It leaves an ink smudge there, but it's no matter.
, Draco had said, the first time Harry saw him with his shirt off.
Harry feels that shiver again, eyes flicking from Draco’s eyes to his lips, and he can’t tell if the answer is
If he cuts himself, he’ll be healed by the next day without so much as a mark to show where the injury had been. If he’s scorched by the sun, though, he’s not sure it will ever truly heal. Three years later, and he still has a scar on his palm from the burn.
