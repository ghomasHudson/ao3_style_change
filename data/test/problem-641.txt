NB: I know I have this story tagged as "no archive warnings apply", but I think this chapter does have somewhat graphic depictions of violence, so if anyone needs details on that or need to know what to skip, just let me know.
“To elaborate a bit on what I’ve already told you, I’ve been… restructuring my life a bit over the last year. I've moved out of the Manor, found a job, you know, things are going well. So I've had some time to reflect on what happened during our last years of school-”
Harry looked up at Malfoy and felt anger seeping back into his blood. Malfoy was looking earnest and composed and somehow that made him even angrier.
“Wow, I don’t know, maybe because his father is in Azkaban and he wants to help him break out? Maybe he’s trying to get revenge by tricking you into a life-threatening situation and then stabbing you in the back once you trust him? I can think of a hundred reasons why Malfoy would lie to us.”
“But I already learned it. It was perfect yesterday, I’m fairly certain I’ll be able to do it again.”
“Oh, that’s the one he stopped to look at,” said the auror who had accompanied them, Jones. “The werewolf.”
Draco kept quiet and listened as they worked out the alternative routes and who should take which ones at what intervals. He had never liked Potter’s friends much, but it was hard not to be impressed by them. They hadn’t been exactly friendly this time, but they were not hostile either. As soon as the planning had begun, they all became business-like and practical.
He had beat up Malfoy. That had been a pretty stupid thing to do, he knew that, but if he ever saw that smug look on the bastard’s face again, he would probably do it again. Even thinking about it now sent new jabs of anger through him – he had been such an idiot. He knew Malfoy. He had known him for years; he shouldn’t have believed for one second that he could have changed.
“Congratulations on the ground-breaking discovery,” he said to her. “Solving the mystery of how to kill a dementor at the humble age of 18. Looks like you really do belong in Ravenclaw.”
He pulls his hands back, sits back up, still in Draco’s lap, but only for a second. Draco reaches out to touch him and Harry moves away.
Harry doesn’t say anything. He remembers that moment in the astronomy tower, when Draco lowered his wand, the rush of relief he felt. And now he feels a stab of burning anger towards Dumbledore, like he hasn’t since he was fifteen – he wanted Draco to get out, of course he did, but not like this. His head is ringing with every single ugly thing Malfoy has ever said about Mrs Weasley or about the Burrow, about Ron's second-hand robes and Mr Weasley’s meagre Ministry position. He wanted him to be safe, he really did, but he doesn’t want him in this house, doesn’t want him to look at this warm, loving place, the last untainted place Harry has left, and make it all seem small.
And it was true, some of them had. Such as Draco Malfoy. Harry could see him sitting among the other seventh years. He had known for a while that he hadn’t been imprisoned, but he still hadn’t expected him to be back at Hogwarts, and definitely hadn’t been prepared to run into him on the train.
“Well, you were a right arsehole for not telling us that Malfoy and Parkinson would be there, but we all heard Malfoy’s story, and Hermione thinks he’s right that we have to do something about it,” said Ginny.
”I really wanted to take the mark,” he said. “I thought it meant I had caught up with you. It was my chance to be the chosen one, you know?”
He wasn't sure if he wanted to. The conversation certainly wasn't very stimulating, he wasn't sure what he was even supposed to do if Potter got sick, and if he was being perfectly honest, it was getting fairly awkward, even if Potter was too drunk to notice.
“She wanted me to stay away from Potter,” he said, sitting down across from her by the footboard of the bed.
The soft silver glow flowed out around him and condensed into the shape of an animal that bolted forwards, pushing itself between the dementors until Draco came back into view. He stood as he had when Harry lost sight of him, stiff and frozen with his arms hanging down his sides, but as the dementors pulled back, he turned to look at the patronus. Slowly and with a dazed expression, he put his hand against it’s side. Harry’s breath was fast and shallow, his heart still pounding away. There was a strange buzz in the fingertips on his wand hand, like a mild electrical current. The edge of his vision was blurry, making the apparition in front of him even more unreal. The second patronus was a dream thing, bright and warm and safe, yet he couldn’t really believe it was there, even when he was looking right at it, even as Draco ran a hand over the silver fur. It wasn’t a stag either; it had no antlers.
And then Harry remembered the 10 inches of hawthorn that were still lying in his coat pocket. He watched Malfoy blow smoke out the window again while an awful, twisting feeling settled in his gut.
After Potions they had Charms, and Harry realized something was wrong when Hermione still hadn’t looked at him the entire lesson. He also had an uncomfortable feeling he knew what it was.
“These days I make it a priority to spend as little time as possible with my housemates and most other people in the school, and going to the Halloween feast isn’t really compatible with that philosophy.”
"Like the Ministry cares about that! There's an apparition point in an alley at the other end of the street, why on earth wouldn't you use it?"
There was a note of grudging respect in her tone. There was a brief moment where both of their hands were on the wand and their eyes were on each other, and there was a hint of a smile on both their faces.
The air outside was clear with frost and the wind scraped frozen teeth over Draco’s cheeks. The gravel crunched under their feet and Harry’s shoulder brushed against his as they walked.
They had gotten just a step ahead of him when he looked back. He watched Daphne running her hand soothingly down Blaise’s arm; Pansy’s shoulders still tense, and Matthew trying to act like nothing had happened. None of them turned. There was not the slightest acknowledgement that they had heard what he had said, and Draco felt a sense of dread spreading inside him, a heavy, sinking feeling in his stomach.
The voice was so quiet it almost wasn’t there. Draco opened his eyes. He had already been mostly asleep.
He saw Potter’s face fall, crumbling like burnt paper while he spoke. He saw disbelief turn to anger. He saw him move and he felt pain exploding through his face as Potter’s knuckles made contact with his jaw. His teeth clamped down hard on his tongue, he staggered backwards, lifted a hand carefully to his chin and felt the warm, rusty taste of blood in his mouth.
And the subject was dropped, so Harry decided not to ask which form Malfoy thought his patronus would take.
"Right,” she said, ”but I'm sick of you sitting there like you think someone is going to hex you in the back any moment, and you've clearly sobered up too much for your own good, so stop spitting in that empty butterbeer and go get yourself some whisky."
"Sure," he said. And then after a moment’s hesitation added: "We could go somewhere else. If you want."
“You asked me to meet you here,” said Harry, interrupting him. “You said you wanted to discuss a truce, so let’s do that.”
“Pansy, I'm kind of tired," he interrupted. "Did you want something, or did you call me just to complain about calling me?”
And then it wasn’t even something he could vent to his friends about, because it was so incredibly embarrassing. He hadn’t thought Malfoy would go that far just to humiliate him.
“My point is that maybe we should give it a bit more time. See if we can get closer to a solution for the pit before we tell the other’s what we’ve found out.”
“I don’t know if it’s anything. I – well, unless you really want to hear about it, I would rather talk about something else. Something that’s
When he returned to the studying tables, the fifth years had gone and Granger was the only student left. He decided to sit by her table despite what Longbottom had said. It shouldn’t matter when there was no one there to be puzzled by it. He pulled out a chair across from hers and put down the books. She didn’t look up. He doubted Madam Pince would be able to hear them talking all the way back there, but he still pulled out his wand and muttered a quick silencing spell just to be safe.
They all looked at him. Pansy was the only one who didn't seem surprised. She looked impatient instead.
And like the rest of Harry’s summer, his birthday is a tricky balancing act between the warmth and normalcy of the Burrow, of life moving on, and then the war looming over all of them, breathing down their necks: There’s breakfast and presents, Fred and George grumbling when Mrs Weasley volunteers them to do the dishes afterwards, there’s a game of quidditch in the garden, and then lunch is interrupted by the arrival of the Minister for Magic.
“Well, thank you for bringing your son back, I hope he enjoyed the holidays. It’s past curfew now, so if you don’t mind, I think professor Hagrid and I should escort him inside.”
She observed him calmly. He knew he was being rude, but nothing in the professor’s face revealed that she was bothered by it or had even noticed.
"Amazing. I would have sworn neither of you even knew the meaning of being discreet," Malfoy said, taking another drag of his cigarette and blowing the smoke out the window.
Harry turned around in his seat to see another person approaching their table. He was a white boy with soft, brown curls and bright, smiling eyes.
“It was mentioned briefly in one of my mother’s notebooks – she had a very interesting theory that depression was caused by dementor-possession, but-“
He threw himself towards him, still holding on to Hermione, dragging her with him as he tried to physically shove the dementors aside with his free arm, but his hand just sank uselessly into their flesh and shards of cold shot up his arm.
"No," Potter said, and Draco felt a treacherous twinge of gratitude in his gut. Because apparently he couldn't help being pathetically happy about being this close to Potter no matter the circumstances.
But of course, it is Potter. He knocks and then lets himself in. He closes the door behind him but stays hovering by it, as if afraid of what will happen if he strays too far into the room.
“Look," he began irritably, then cut himself off. He took a deep breath. "It’s… I don’t know what to tell you, Malfoy," he said. "It’s fine. It was a long time ago.”
They didn’t begin their descent until they had passed over the village and were far enough up the path to the castle to avoid risk of being seen. Malfoy landed in the gravel of the path and Harry joined him seconds later.
“Oh, please, like the famous Harry Potter hasn’t had girls throwing themselves at him with declarations of crushes every day of his life of fame. You must have gotten used to handling it by now.”
, and yet all the furniture in there looked ancient. There were ornate carvings on the bed, the upholstery of the couch looked like velvet or something like that, and Harry was pretty sure the silver handles on the dresser were shaped like tiny snakes. But then right next to that sort of antique grandeur there was the kitchen which was plain and IKEA-like and muggle, and the curtains were an odd mustard yellow with an ugly tartan pattern and a couple of stains that were clearly visible even from across the room. He didn't know what he had expected. It wasn't like he had spent much time imagining what Malfoy's flat would look like, but he really hadn't thought it could be anything other than immaculate, pristine and polished. He should probably have stopped thinking he knew what to expect from Malfoy after the pub. Or at least after the jeans.
Potter lurched forward and grabbed his arm. Draco stopped and turned around to look at him. Potter didn’t let go.
“Or maybe we were wrong about suffocating them, they were all just theories we came up with, we don’t really know anything about them, maybe we’re wrong about all of it-“
After dinner Harry, Ginny, Ron and Dean headed down to the quidditch pitch. Hermione came with them, and Seamus had been immersed in a debate with Ron and Ginny about British quidditch teams, so he walked some of the way with them too, but before they even reached the hallway, the discussion had become exclusively Ron and Ginny’s. Dean and Seamus were sending each other significant looks behind their backs when Ron started accusing Ginny of disloyalty:
“Come on, Malfoy, don’t be an arse,” he says, and Draco glares daggers at him, but he still steps back enough to let Harry inside.
Over time, Draco had become very good at compartmentalizing his feelings. It was a useful skill. It had made it easy for him to learn occlumency.
, and yet people seem to be confused as to which pure families proved themselves to be true and which ones were the Voldemort-supporters.”
“Look,” he said. “The entire Weasley-clan has managed to arrive late. Most of them graduated years ago, why on earth did they bring the whole litter?”
Draco really thought he should, but before he could begin repeating any of the wonderfully sappy quotes he had picked up, Slughorn showed up and pushed his way past the students, apologizing and rambling about how he got held up in the teacher’s lounge. Potter nodded to Draco, and then trickled inside with the other Gryffindors. A moment later, Pansy was at Draco’s side.
“I thought you had caught on to the fact that I am no longer in a position where I can order my friends around,” he said.
“I’m not sure if I am allowed to tell you this, but I know that Kingsley Shacklebolt is currently trying to pass legislation that’ll improve the justice system, possibly even do something about the dementors.”
“Oh, so you didn’t run, it was just that the stairs were a bit hard for you? Merlin, Harry, you’re getting out of shape now that you’re not chasing dark lords all the time, maybe I should write to some of my relatives-”
If he had said then that he wanted to go abroad, maybe she would have agreed to try again. She was more like herself now, more like she had been before the war. She didn’t cry when she looked at him anymore. But he did not ask her. And when a whole week had gone by she told him to go pack his things: they were leaving in half an hour.
He was probably ruining his robes, actually, sitting like this on a filthy doorstep that had likely been soiled by countless unmentionable liquids over time.
He zoned out, thoughts drifting back to the coffee shop, and then to the girl, and then, inevitably, to Potter. He put his hand over his left arm and rubbed at the mark with his thumb - he couldn't feel it through the fabric, but every so often there was an imagined itch, a slight burning… Between the bodies of the people standing in the middle aisle, he caught a glimpse of his own face reflected in the dark glass opposite him. He looked scruffy and worn and exactly as tired as he felt. The shock had mostly lifted, but there was still that lump of sadness in his gut.
A great, black creature shot up through the yellowing thicket of leaves, for a second the batlike wings swallowed the sky in front of them, they could count every vein of blood in the thin, stretched skin. And then the thestral rose higher and passed over them so closely they felt the wind moved by its body like a heavy force on their backs.
The door closed behind Granger and he was left alone with Lovegood. They looked at each other and there was a moment where he thought one of them might comment on what had just happened. But that would have been like striking an alliance after Granger had left, that would have been looking for an understanding with the other, so they didn’t say anything. Instead she cast her eyes back down to the parchment in front of her and Draco shrugged and looked away.
Draco’s eyes flashed to Potter, who looked terrified, but he was watching Draco, not the creature. Draco felt a rush of anger in the midst of his confusion –
“Merlin, it was strange to get the letter, wasn’t it? I really think we’re too old for Hogwarts, but it’s not like they gave us much of a choice…”
“You will stay here for the next couple of days and rest. You’ll continue with the skin replenishing potion every morning, as well as applying dragon burn salve three times a day, and by then you should be as good as new.”
“Or we could watch the Gryffindors,” she said. “You’ll need to know what they duel like anyway if you have to fight with them.”
When Harry arrived at the potions classroom that evening, Malfoy was already there. He stood in the dimly lit corridor, leaning against the wall. He looked up when Harry came down the stairs.
. You just want someone who isn’t tied up in any of this shit, you want things to be nice and uncomplicated and
Harry wondered why Draco thought Irie would have been in Slytherin. Everything about the way she was looking at him right then screamed of Gryffindor. Harry shook his head quickly.
“Well, obviously they’re the better team, but it’s not like I can’t support Chudley Cannons too. And no matter how much you like them it’s obvious they made a mistake with Crowley as seeker. Ernie agrees with me.”
“And about what you said, about betraying us, then you’re right, I suppose it doesn’t work like that. Unless your newfound friendship means you’ll just let it slide when he starts talking shit about all of us, of course.”
Draco laughed. It hurt terribly and sounded shallow and broken. He heard the door slam. His laughter dried out. He took a deep breath and sat up slowly, his body aching, then carefully stood up. He touched his chin again where Potter had struck him. It was sore. There would probably be a bruise, but it was nothing he couldn’t fix himself. At least his teeth were intact. He straightened his clothes, ran his fingers through his hair to put it back in place and wiped a bit of blood from the corner of this mouth.
“I know!” Harry said. “He was such a prick. He still is, but he’s also not. I think maybe he just took a really long time to grow up.”
," he snapped, looking horrified at Potter. "What were you- did you honestly think- bloody hell, Potter, Pansy and I aren't together!"
Harry had never really been able to join in the excitement. For him, summer had always meant his forced return to the Dursleys, and replacing Hogwarts with Privet Drive hadn’t given him much to look forward to. This year, he would be going home with Ron to the Burrow, and so he revelled in the same yearning for freedom everyone else did. For the seventh years, though, the elation was tinged with some nostalgia. As much as Harry looked forward to spending the coming months with the Weasleys, he couldn’t help feeling sad to be leaving Hogwarts behind. Last year, when he had been on the run, he had still, in the back of his mind, been sure that he would eventually return to Hogwarts. And it wasn’t like this was goodbye forever, but when he did come back it would be as a guest, not as a student. It wouldn’t be his home anymore.
Harry turned and saw Draco disengaging from a flock of Slytherins. He came towards them, his luggage hovering obediently behind him.
She paused as if she was expecting some sort of reaction, but he didn’t say anything. She folded her hands in front of her on the desk with a small sigh.
“We’re friends,” he said, which wasn’t discreet either, but they hadn’t prepared for this, and the easiest lie to pull off would be one that was at least somewhat close to the truth.
“Remember third year?” he asked. “When they had dementors surrounding the grounds? And they let them onto the train?”
He stood with his back to Draco, his hand resting on the knob. Draco watched his shoulders rise and fall. He was clutching his wand tightly. The room was silent. Draco could hear his own, uneven breath.
A boat was waiting for them down by the shore. It was small and battered and seemed inadequate as protection against the violent waves, but it was pulled by magic and cut smoothly through the water, as if it was running on railroad tracks rather than sailing. A spell had been cast to keep the sprays of water from hitting them too. His mother had her hands curled tightly in her lap and was staring straight ahead. He could tell she was worried, even if she would have appeared calm and dignified to anyone else. He turned away from her and wondered how far out the island was. He couldn’t see anything yet. Suddenly he was worried they might have to sail all the way to the Danish or Norwegian coast – Azkaban was unplottable, so he had never seen it on a map and had no closer idea of where it was, other than that it was somewhere in the North Sea. He was just about to ask one of the aurors how far it was, when he saw it. It appeared out of nowhere. A second ago there had only been the sea ahead of them, but now the tower rose sharp and angular into the sky. It towered over them like a mountain, immense and eternal, and as with Hogwarts, it was hard to believe that humans had created it. It was hard to believe it had ever been created at all, that it hadn’t always been there as a shadowed mark upon the world. It seemed the grey daylight never reached the stones of the walls, like the tower held a darkness of its own. Draco had never thought a building could look evil. There were no seagulls anymore.
Harry stays at Hogwarts for the funeral, then spends his last summer with the Dursleys. It’s slightly more bearable when he can keep in the back of his mind that he will never have to see them again. Or maybe it’s just that he can’t bring himself to care about their petty neglect and contempt after everything that’s happened. He keeps to himself in his room, scouring the papers for news of Voldemort, reading and re-reading obituaries on Dumbledore. He goes for walks around the neighbourhood on the days when the house is making him crazy, on nights when he can’t sleep. The pain of losing Dumbledore dulls to a slow, consistent ache, only to flare up occasionally, threatening to drag him into a pit of despair. But he carries the locket with him at all times now, letting it remind him of what lies ahead, what he has to do. He doesn’t have the luxury of letting himself fall apart, so he doesn’t. He stays at Privet Drive and he waits for the Order to come pick him up.
That night it had all become so real to him, what they were doing. Right now they were able to keep it a secret, but that couldn’t last. Harry wasn’t good with secrets. Sooner or later they would have to give it up or they would have to tell people. And so while Draco slept, Harry had made up a scenario; challenged himself to envision the most impossible situation as possible. He had set it in a distant future when they would all be more grown up and the war wouldn’t be looming as close. He had tried to imagine what it would be like if Draco came with them to the burrow. He did it carefully, constructing all the little details of the story – how nervous he would be; how Draco’s fingers would flick to the cuff of his left sleeve the way they sometimes did when he was stressed. Harry could see how he would become smaller in Mrs Weasley’s kitchen, how out of place he would look in all that homely clutter. He would be wearing his expensive robes, but his shoulders would fold in, the elbows held close to the body like sparrow’s wings, flighty and tense, every joint strained against the pull of his good upbringing, that had taught him to hold his head high and keep his back straight. A privileged upbringing where he had learned how to suavely converse with politicians, but not how to humbly enter a house where he wasn’t welcome.
“New years! You were supposed to be there. I sent you letters. I contacted your mother over the floo, and she said you wouldn’t talk to me.”
His robes caught flame even before it reached him, and then it engulfed his whole body and the flames were wrenched apart, losing all semblance of an animal. Tongues of fire shot out and coursed and curled along the body, and for a moment the body in the middle of the inferno seemed completely unharmed. Then Harry screamed: “Down!”, and Draco didn’t have time to react before the blast wave hit him in the chest and threw him to the floor. White hot pain shot through his shoulder and it was all he could do to still hold on to his wand. The world dissolved in the roar from the explosion.
He reached for his wand – he was far beyond the point where blowing up a door to wake someone up would be a drastic move, and if for some insane reason Madam Pomfrey wasn’t in her quarters, maybe the noise would be loud enough to wake up another teacher, anyone who knew anything about healing spells, and then to hell with all of the secrecy- the door was pulled open and Madam Pomfrey, wrapped in her dressing gown, blinked up at him with sleep-drunk eyes.
“We have to find the source. We have to kill them, and we’re in a hurry, so now is not the time to be a coward.”
“Well, it actually wasn’t all that terrible,” she said. “I found some interesting books. I haven’t found anything really useful yet, but I’m sure I will, I just need a bit more time.”
“We used to come here last year when we needed to get away from snitches, and the barkeep gave us this table – and don’t look so surprised, Potter. Slytherins had things to hide from the Carrows too.”
“But now you’ve come back,” McGonagakk continued. “A week later than expected – and you don’t look very well.”
“So what do you plan to do instead?” asked Draco, pretending that Potter hadn’t just tried to derail their barely functioning conversation with his unwelcome sincerity.
. You never see people or actions or history with any gradation at all and you forget that other people don’t always feel the same way you do – like the way you’ve been defending Snape all year-”
“Plotting? Are you serious? I’m done spending my time doing stupid shit just to piss you off, alright, I’m not a kid anymore. And the war is over, I’m lucky to not be in prison, you think I’m about to throw that away on some stupid revenge-scheme?”
“Not really, no. I’m pretty sure Ginny is in charge of smuggling alcohol, she’s been getting a lot of letters from George recently. Actually I’m not going either.”
“Look, I’m not saying any of this to offend you, it’s just that the houses of Malfoy and Black have donated about half the books in there, so she has a lot of respect for my family and usually just lets me go in there and take what I want.”
that had seized him – Harry started awake, the jolt of being tripped and falling. His heart was pounding. He breathed deeply. He stared up into the darkness for a couple of seconds as the euphoria ebbed out of him and was replaced by slow, sinking worry.
Harry flinches because – because no, that isn’t why he is there, but of course, that’s what Malfoy would assume. It’s been hours since he stood in Ginny’s sunlit room and they joked about the lack of dating opportunities on a horcrux hunt, but he can still recall the feeling of her hand on his neck, the press of her soft lips, the flowery smell of her that was everywhere in the room.
“I made the right choice, Potter,” he says with strangled voice, still not looking at Harry. “It took a while and I made so many mistakes, but I’m here now.”
"I'm still kind of shocked Draco has normal friends," Irie said, dragging his attention back to the table.
It was worth every single moment of failure. He raised his wand and cast the spell again. The snake reappeared. They watched the beautiful creature twisting its body in the air, the powerful muscles moving under the shimmering scales.
Draco rolled his eyes. His gut was twisting with something that felt an awful lot like disappointment and he didn't know why he had ever decided to tell Potter
They were on a low hill and could see heath stretching out all around them. It was a bright, clear night and the moon was almost full. There were no houses in sight, only small groves of trees breaking up the landscape. He assumed they must be somewhere in the English countryside and could probably place it more precisely if he found out which one of Harry’s people had picked the place. It was perfect for their intentions – no one for miles to see the light from their spells and they would have to be very loud before anyone would hear them. He turned around and saw the rest of their group getting to their feet from where they had been sitting while they waited for the Slytherins.
It hadn’t actually been that hard for Harry to ignore Malfoy’s presence at the Burrow. He rarely showed his face anyway, and Harry had enough to worry about to keep his mind occupied. Ron was pissed for almost two days, mostly on behalf of Hermione, but it eventually faded when Harry only participated half-heartedly in his contempt and Hermione remained entirely reasonable and unfazed. Fred and George gave up on trying to pull any pranks on him after Mrs Weasley caught them with a whole arsenal of stink bombs and yelled at them for an entire hour. After that, his presence was hardly commented on, except for the occasional, muttered aside of someone wondering aloud about what the hell Dumbledore had been thinking, or a concerned remark from Mrs Weasley about how skinny Draco was. Most of the time, Harry could almost forget he was even there.
are you serious? He used a key, that doesn’t mean there aren’t any curses too, how would I know if there were any curses just from seeing him unlocking it-"
Harry didn’t answer him. He stirred his potion twice counter clockwise. Malfoy still didn’t leave. He just stood there across from him, as if he was expecting some sort of answer.
"I'm fine. It wasn't… It wasn't exactly what I hoped for, but I got to say what I wanted. It's over."
Draco searched for some sort of reason to give him for why he was there at all if Draco didn’t want him for anything. He had thought he wanted to talk about the nightmare, to share his panic and explain all over again why what they were doing was so important, to put words to all those black thoughts. But now Potter was there, ruffled by night and incredibly nice to look at, and Azkaban was suddenly the last thing Draco wanted to think about.
But really it would be easier to tell her than any of the others. He kind of wanted to. Just to sort himself out a bit.
"Of course I've got a wand, I was pardoned, remember? Got a new one after the trials. Not from Ollivander, of course but… well. It’s perfectly adequate."
“So it’s just me?” said Potter, halfway smiling as if he wanted to laugh at the absurdity of the two of them confiding in each other.
“Yeah, your sincerity was really shining through,” he said. “Is this what you’re like when you try to be friendly?”
He hesitated. He didn’t know what to tell her – not about Harry, obviously, but she was looking at him now, and listening, and he didn’t want to waste that on some vague half-truths.
It is the story he has convinced himself he believes, the one that has to be true, the only logical explanation. Draco is aware that fifth year wasn’t good, that whatever they had back then was deeply fucked up, but that last time, when Potter apologized, when he stayed, that’s the memory that’s been festering in Draco’s mind, the one that all those ill-advised threads of hope are tied to, even when he tells himself he knows better.
He withdrew an envelope from the pocket of his robes and handed it to Draco. Draco took it hesitantly. It had the family crest pressed into the wax seal, so it had to be from his mother, but she must have considered it urgent if she hadn’t just waited for the morning owl post. He broke the seal and pulled out the letter. It was very short. Nott was still lingering around the room, flipping through the library books on his bedside table, when Draco had read through it twice. He read it again. A grey feeling was spreading its tendrils in his chest.
“You were scared? Of what? He would have rewarded you. Handing me over would have fixed everything for you, I imagine.”
There was definitely a blush. Malfoy's ears were getting pink too – what the hell had he done to get that number?
Aberforth gave Harry a quick glance before walking over to check if the crumpled man was still conscious.
By the time he sat down next to Draco, every student in the hall had noticed him. When Harry reached for the toast, everyone who hadn’t seen it for themselves had been told by their neighbour that the golden trio were sitting with Slytherin.
Draco’s spell missed by an inch, but Neville’s hit and the wand flew from the auror’s hand into his.
He was still within the circle of light from Harry’s patronus, but only barely, and they were still so far away from the stairs and Harry wouldn’t be able to drag him there when he was holding up Hermione. His heart was pounding and his throat swelled as the fear and helplessness welled up in him. And then a dementor slid between him and Draco, and another one, and then they all crowded around him like flies around an open wound and he was swallowed up in the mass of them and disappeared from view.
“Didn’t you? Because from where I’m standing it looks like you came up here again, in the middle of the night, and I don’t know if you’ve managed to get yourself obliviated since last night, but I haven’t. And I couldn’t care less about your
“I can believe what he says about Azkaban and I’m all for blowing up the place if it’s really that bad,” she said. “But I won’t be working with those two. We can do this as the D.A. without any snakes involved, or we’re not doing it at all.”
It was Friday afternoon and Harry, Ron and Hermione were lying in the grass by the lake near an old willow tree. It was the end of September, but autumn hadn’t quite set in yet and this was another warm day with sun from a clear blue sky. Ron had brought wizard's chess with him and Hermione had finally conceded to let him teach her how to play.
Longbottom had managed to cast a disarming spell from where he had fallen and now he was getting up to hand the wand back to Lovegood. Draco could see them stopping to talk before they split up again to start over. Pansy nudged him and he looked over at her, then followed her gaze to where Granger and Ginny were duelling – and that was a fearsome thing to watch. Granger seemed able to cast non-verbal spells just as easily as verbal ones, and even though it was hard to make out the details of her movement in the dark, the intricate wandwork was enough to tell them that she wasn’t using simple spells. There were only seconds between the sharp flashes of light, glimmers of shielding charms going up and cascades of sparks when the attacks were deflected. However, despite her advanced spells, it was clear that Granger was loosing. Ginny was ferocious, her spells fast and powerful, and there was a certainty to her movements that made it obvious who was the better duellist of the two. Draco and Pansy had only been watching them for a couple of seconds when Granger reacted too slowly to a close succession of spells from Weasley – she deflected the first one, but the second one caught her, and it must have been an
“And when I tell you that I’m proud of you, I want you to know that I’m referring to this year as well as every one that came before it. Don’t think I haven’t noticed what you and your friends have done for the school this year. There were some things I thought even years of peace couldn’t mend, and to see the relationship between Gryffindor and Slytherin change so much in a single year has been nothing short of miraculous.”
Harry thought he was feeling a slight buzz from the alcohol. Malfoy seemed more relaxed as well, but he wasn’t sure if it was because of the whisky or because Harry had conceded to the agreement.
“Good evening, Mr Malfoy. Please, come sit down,” she told him, gesturing to a chair in front of her.
Their little circles of silver light moved slowly downwards through the levels, leaving a string of runes behind them. The dementors didn’t come near them, but they were there, in the wide, empty space between the three walls along which the gallery ran; in the cells opposite the patronuses or on the lower levels. Tattered cloaks that moved like shadows over the walls. The faint sound of rattling breaths.
"Hey Draco, I know that was some odd shit before but we're pretty busy in here, so could you maybe hurry up?"
His anger curled back at her icy tone, but he did not apologize. He looked away. Narcissa turned back to Lucius. She brushed her lips lightly over his cheek. He didn’t seem to notice. Draco wanted to throw up.
“We know about the security too,” said Malfoy. “The island itself is unplottable, but there is a house for the guards on the coast, and it’s possible to apparate there. When I went, there were only six aurors stationed at the prison, four at the tower and two at the house. The tower is hidden by some sort of disillusionment, so it’s invisible until you get close. And the dementor’s pit is at the bottom.”
The voice is so quiet Draco almost thinks he might have imagined it, but when he glances back Potter’s eyes are fixed on him again.
They put on their coats and left the pub. There were quick, awkward goodbyes outside, where they both pretended it hadn't been weird. Malfoy thanked Harry for showing up, Harry said it was nice to see him and Malfoy said it back, and Harry wasn’t sure if he might have meant it, but then Malfoy was walking away up the street and Harry was heading back to the underground, and he realized it didn’t matter, because he was never going to talk to him again.
For a second Potter looked like he had been punched in the face and Draco thought he might try to beat him to death, the loathing in his eyes was so pure. But then his face closed up. He let go of Draco’s wrists and stood up.
He wondered how long it would be before Ron came looking for him. He was probably waiting for Harry to calm down. Or for Hermione to come home. He hated when they ganged up on him. He hated when they ganged up on him because they were worried. It made him feel like such a shit. He just didn't want to talk to them about it was all. He knew he was being stupid, them telling him he was being stupid just made it worse.
gotten used to a life without phones a long time ago. He looked around for a quill and something to write on. He scribbled
with that, and they all have people who are dead because of what we did, and I can’t just go home and cry about my Death Eater father and still have that-“ Draco’s voice broke pathetically.
“And where is precious Potter this morning?” she asked, interrupting Draco before he could do the same.
No one answered that – or if they did it was drowned out by the loud hiss of one of Pansy’s spells being swallowed by Ginny’s protective charm. And Draco had to admit that he was slightly impressed that she was holding her ground. He would have pegged Ginny as the best duellist of the lot, but Pansy was keeping up with her, even if there was a sheen of sweat on brow and her movements looked frantic where Ginny’s were rapid and certain. He gripped his wand tighter, knowing Longbottom was right and that Weasley was too, but Pansy would tire out soon and watching the furious look on Ginny’s face, he wasn’t sure she would stop when she did. He watched Pansy dancing around, half dodging half deflecting the barrage of spells hitting her, fighting for the chance to cast a shot, then noticed the movement out of the corner of his eye and reacted before he could think, dragging Longbottom’s arm down and holding on to his wrist to keep his wand pointed to the ground.
Thomas and Finnigan were a few tables over, but they were following the scene with interest and looked like they would jump in the second it turned ugly. Granger hadn’t gotten up to join the wall of Gryffindors between Draco and Potter, but she was watching the scenario attentively. He couldn’t tell from where he stood if she had her wand out, but he remembered the warning she had given him. He suddenly missed Crabbe and Goyle – everything had been so much easier with bodyguards. Draco turned his attention from Ginevra to Ronald.
The dementors ahead of them had parted and instead of more dementors, they stepped into thick fog. Illuminated by the patronuses it glowed pearly grey, and through it they could just make out the wall and the corpse of a man slumped against it. Thin chains trailed from his wrists to bolts in the stone and made him look a mirror image of Rabastan Lestrange in his cell above. Only Rabastan had been beaten and filthy to look at, whereas the figure in front of them seemed strangely undamaged by his imprisonment. His robes were beautiful and looked untouched by time, though the style and fabric seemed foreign and ancient. The dead wizard was thin as a skeleton, but the skin still clung tightly to his bones and it was impossible to tell what age he had been when he died. The hair on his head was white, but thick and strong and it grew long enough to reach his waist.
Draco started. He looked up and saw Potter coming towards him. Draco turned around and began walking away quickly in the opposite direction.
They stayed in the room for a while, but not much else was said. They mostly kissed, which was surprisingly easy. It didn’t leave any room for thinking.
Harry shrugged, pretending he couldn't feel his heart rate picking up. It hadn't been a secret. It really hadn't. He just hadn't told anyone; telling Malfoy was the first time he talked about it to someone who wasn't in his immediate circle of friends. It hadn't been a secret, but it had been something people didn’t need to know. They knew the media would be all over it when they found out and neither of them wanted that.
“Yeah,” he said quietly. “I thought so too for a little while, last night. But Pomfrey patched her up. She’ll be fine. Pomfrey’s brilliant.”
had shared the limited space of that couch with someone else. He also, Draco admitted, looked like more illicit things than sleep could have taken place on the couch as well.
The others agreed, Matthew added that they had probably thought it would be unfair to the kids who had been in hiding, and Draco savoured the feeling of the group clicking back into place around him, their careful distance and coldness diminished by sheer force of habit. Daphne was laughing and being charming all over the place, and he caught Matthew rolling his eyes at him when her giggles became too silvery. This was what he had to work with. His earlier popularity hadn’t been entirely dependent on the former glory of his name or their knowledge that he would one day inherit all the puppet strings of his father – he just had to keep reminding them of that until they forgot why they had ever abandoned him. He had been stepping down on his dominance quite a bit, allowing Blaise to take more of the stage. Being second was not defeat after all – it could be rational victory. That was something his father had explained to him when Draco had asked why a powerful family like theirs would act as servants to the Dark Lord. The current problem wasn’t that he was no longer the prince of Slytherin, but that his place in the hierarchy was unclear, and definitely not as close to the top as it ought to be.
It was the first Christmas after the war and of course it would have been impossible not to feel the emptiness left by all the people who had died. But the burrow was still full of people, there were guests in every bedroom and Mrs Weasley kept everyone busy with cooking for and cleaning after everyone, with entertaining guests and running errands for her.
“It’s probably not a good sign that we need to be putting ourselves in mortal danger to avoid getting bored.”
“Oh,” he said when he remembered. “No, it’s not like that with her. I mean, we pretend it is, obviously, especially to each other, but it’s really not.”
Harry grinned and glanced over at Draco, who would usually have made a snide comment about their egos about now, but Draco wasn't following the conversation. He sat rigidly in his seat, his gaze turned to the landscape rushing by outside. Harry nudged him.
“Sorry. Hermione wants me to talk; you know how she gets that look in her eyes? And she wants a therapist available at Hogwarts.”
had been pulling at his decisions. He had been seeking Potter out all year. He had deemed him his absolution at first, and then he had thought he might be his friend. He had even convinced himself that there were proper, rational reasons for all of it.
“If the first thing you did wasn’t insulting Ron. What if it had been you who helped me find the platform instead of the Weasleys? Do you think that would have changed things?”
Draco was well past tipsy and on his way towards solid drunkenness when Tracey asked when they were planning on heading to the pub. Draco looked surprised from her to Pansy.
The occlumency lessons are over before they’ve begun. There’s no way Harry can allow Snape into his head; he knows he’s skewing the proportions of things, that Voldemort having access to his mind is worse than letting Snape see a handful of random memories. But this is one humiliation he won’t stand for. Not under any circumstances.
He opened his eyes and looked into the kind face of a silver otter. He turned his head and there was Harry, kneeling down and leaning over him with a hand on his shoulder. His expression was raw, scared. He pulled back when Draco opened his eyes, allowing him room to sit up. Draco carefully pushed himself upright, grimacing at the pain from his head and his bruised elbow.
It had been difficult to get her to listen to his apologies, but they had fought before and they had made up before, and eventually she just sighed and said it was like sixth year all over again, and what was it he needed her to do? He had told her that they were meeting the Gryffindors because of what had happened while he was in Azkaban, but not much else. She had agreed to come with him, not to be enthusiastic.
Harry comes of age at the burrow and Dumbledore leaves him the snitch for no apparent reason. The trace is lifted and the last barrier keeping them from going to hunt for horcruxes is gone. Of course, they will stay for the wedding, but then the time is up. One more day.
Draco was not even halfway to the Slytherin dungeon when he realized how ridiculous it had been of him to leave so abruptly. He hadn’t even apologized properly for Pansy’s behaviour. There had been no reason to start defending her – he should have made it clear that he wanted to cooperate. It was stupid of him not to have asked Pansy to try to get along with the Gryffindors, but he had thought it would be obvious. Of course it wasn’t, since she didn’t know how important it was, because he hadn’t told her that either. It was his own fault, and still he couldn’t help being annoyed with her. She didn’t have to stand on her pride like that. It would make everything so much easier for her, and for him, if she didn’t.
He said it heavily, more to Granger than any of the others – those had been her arguments. She shrugged.
"If you've got a wand, why aren't you using magic? To light your cigarette," he added, when Malfoy just looked puzzled. "Or to boil water."
There was a rustle of paper, and Draco turned away from the patronus to see Lovegood pulling out the sketch of Azkaban that he had made for Granger for what seemed a hundred years ago. Draco wasn’t good at drawing. He apparently wasn’t very good at remembering architectural layouts either, and the sketch was pretty lacking. Lovegood took a quill and placed little marks along the wall of his attempt to do a cross section of the building. Draco clenched and unclenched his hands as he watched her. He looked from her to Granger.
“I haven’t talked to her, but you know, lots of change in the Wizengamot these days so I assume the family is fighting tooth and nail to claim as many seats as they can,” she said, sounding bored with it all. “Did you hear Goyle has been pulled out? Do you two still keep in contact or…?”
“I wish we didn’t have to talk about this while I was trying to get a potion right. You realize I have to turn this in?”
He didn’t know why he said it. It wasn’t something he told people. He had spent all his years at Hogwarts trying to sever every tie he had to Slytherin. They had become secrets and things to be ashamed of. He had hated that house because he hated Malfoy, and because everything that tied Harry to Slytherin had also tied him to Voldemort.
was seeking out Malfoy, what exactly he was looking for when he snuck out to meet him. He hated the part of himself that for some reason wanted to see him and there was no desire to examine that want any closer. He can remember every single excuse that went through his head that year, he’s been rehearsing them daily since Malfoy showed up at the Burrow; he had excuses but not a
And Draco settled down with his head resting in Harry’s lap. He asked Harry what he wanted to do after Hogwarts and Harry ran his fingers through his hair while he talked about quidditch scores, the rent of flats in London and the impossible grade requirements for becoming an auror – Draco laughed at that and told him that he could get T’s on everything and they would still let him in.
They watched the others climb the steps and disappear into the castle. Draco sent a longing glance after them. The chill of the early morning was steadily gnawing itself into his bones. Granger didn’t speak until they were gone.
Time dragged by and Draco was no closer to falling asleep. He had taken off his school robes and tie, feeling suddenly silly for wearing those in the middle of the night. He sat down again in just his shirt and trousers.
Ron was bristling, Harry could hear himself speaking too loud and the whole conversation was starting to feel like a fight.
He had entertained the thought that perhaps Potter was avoiding him – it wasn’t usually this difficult to get a hold of him unnoticed, so maybe Potter was actually trying to make sure that they were never alone. Maybe he regretted what had happened or maybe Draco had misunderstood the things he had said. They hadn’t really talked much, after all.
“Oh come on, just admit they made a mistake when they let him go. He has Voldemort’s mark burned into his skin, they can’t let him off just for saying he’s sorry. At least they could have forbidden him from ever coming back to Hogwarts. Right, Harry?”
Tonks runs a hand through her hair. Draco never met her before coming to this house. It has been the oddest thing knowing they were that closely related when she is so unlike anyone in his family, but for a second the exasperated look on her face reminds him awfully of his mother.
Something clicked into place and Harry knew that Malfoy had said too much. The meeting made sense; the small talk and the firewhisky made sense.
“I don’t know. Fear is a common denominator, I suppose? And for some reason this bloke has given them about five times as much space…”
He shrugged. He felt detached from the whole conversation. He was only vaguely irritated that she insisted on beating around the bush instead of just getting to the point. He had known it was coming at some point. He was surprised it hadn’t happened sooner.
“No, of course not now,” Malfoy snapped, a sliver of irritation slipping into his voice and for the first time he sounded familiar. “Just when you have the time," he pushed on. "Whenever you can fit it into your busy schedule.”
His heart races as he spies on the conversation, everything he already knew being confirmed, getting angrier and angrier with every second he has to stay silent and listen to them. And of course that anger has nothing to do with the way Pansy Parkinson clings to Malfoy. It doesn’t have anything to do with the way they talk about Ginny. Not at all. Last year was an eternity ago; this is about Draco’s suspicious behaviour, his vague bragging and the mark Harry suspects he’ll find on his arm. Harry forgets to stay entirely still, so when his friends leave, Draco stays behind. He curses Harry, breaks his nose and leaves him under the invisibility cloak. That, too, has nothing to do with last year.
“Well,” Hermione said, “whatever they said, they’re wrong and the wizards are right about this one. All the sensible muggles agree with them.”
He skipped transfiguration and walked the long way to the non-existent floor near the Northern Tower, where there was a hidden room behind an invisible door in an inconspicuous stretch of wall.
Harry looked at Hermione. She lay flat on her back, the rise and fall of her chest was quick, but there was no more wheezing. Madam Pomfrey gently put an arm around her and helped her to sit up. The collar of her shirt was soaked. Her skin was glistening – whether from sweat or spells or potions, Harry had no idea – but the burns were gone. Ron came back with the water. He handed it to Madam Pomfrey, who held it to Hermione’s lips.
“I’m fine,” she said, picking up the skin potion and the salve. “We’re still following the plan: We’ll be back in our beds before anyone notices we were gone and wake up this morning like nothing happened.”
“It’s not like anyone’s expecting you to have stuff like that sorted out already. Charlie didn’t figure it out until he was in his seventh year either, and he had a lot less going on than we’ve-“
“She lets you into the restricted section and she lets you read the books there – that’s probably more than she allows any other of the other muggleborn students to do.”
Malfoy nodded. Harry sort of expected him to go on, to say something else, maybe ask more about patronus shapes, but he didn’t.
When he finally returned to the common room the house-elves had been there and it was as tidy and proper as the rooms at Malfoy Manor. He found the books he had left earlier in a neat stack on the polished wood of the table by the fire. There were still glowing embers in the fireplace, they were the only source of light in the room, so it took a moment before he noticed that Pansy was half asleep in one of the soft armchairs with an open book in her lap.
“Hey,” said Harry, only turning to face Draco when the sound of Granger’s footsteps had disappeared above them and they were alone in the Entrance Hall.
Potter nodded almost imperceptibly, picked up his elderberry-leaf and returned to his seat. Draco stayed by the table, taking more time to pick out his ingredients than Potter had. When he returned to his cauldron he cast a quick glance towards Potter’s table to see if he was spilling everything to Granger and Weasley already, and he was relieved to see that he seemed to be keeping his mouth shut. He wondered if he would show up. It might have been Potter’s idea, but Draco was really the only one who had anything to gain from an alliance.
It only takes a couple of days for his head to become a weird space to be in. It does odd things to you not to talk to anyone or write to anyone and having so little contact with other people. Then he feels sorry for himself and then he gets mad at himself for feeling sorry for himself, it’s a wonderful little cycle. He can keep it going for hours.
At least that’s the plan, and then Harry finds Draco crying in a bathroom and everything about that is wrong. Draco throws the first curse, and the fight is about everything that happened the year before and everything that has happened to each of them over the summer and it’s about the war they are both being sucked into and it’s about nothing, until Draco’s chest is sliced open and he collapses onto the waterlogged floor with a splash, his wand falling from his limp hand and blood soaking his clothes and turning the water around him red.
“The mudblood, the penniless bloodtraitors, the lunatic, the half-squib, those are your friends, remember? Such an impressive group, really. It’s no wonder they all adore you, but it does say some quite unflattering things about you that those are the kinds of people you choose to surround yourself with.”
“But she didn’t want to help. And that’s exactly it – all children who have found out about Azkaban have probably told their parents that it was bad and that they were scared, but adults don’t listen to kids, and by the time the kids are old enough for people to listen, they have already learned to ignore it.”
“I thought about doing it this year too, but none of the other Gryffindors in our year are staying so…” He shrugged. “How about you, are you okay with going home?”
"Watch yourself, Harry," said Maya with a smirk. "You don't sound as posh as Draco, but your shock is starting to get a little offensive, don't you think?"
Draco stared at her. Then he turned to look down the table, making sure he was sitting with the right house. A few of the other Slytherins were staring back. Most were studiously pretending they hadn’t noticed the Gryffindors.
"You think that's what I'm doing? I couldn't keep sitting around the Manor waiting for things to go back to normal, Pansy. They are
Harry watched him. It was dark and his eyes were slow at focusing and he lifted a hand to his face to check that he was still wearing his glasses.
Harry wasn't sure how long they had been walking, wasn't quite sure where they were either. The neighbourhood had changed while they walked, the buildings becoming shabbier, fewer people in the street.
“I missed you,” Draco whispers and then wishes instantly that he had kept his mouth shut, because Harry suddenly goes rigid.
“Yes,” said Malfoy. “Even then. I could give you a lesson some time. It looks like you won’t stop being a media darling just because you-know-who is gone.”
,” she muttered, scooping up the thick, waxlike ointment with two fingers. “I’m going to have someone’s head for this…”
He had seen her throw quite a few nasty hexes by now. He remembered the unwavering defiance she had shown the Carrows last year. He stopped.
“The one who managed to keep going after the first war, who rebuilt his entire reputation and ended up standing beside the Minister for Magic for
"Shit, I'm so sorry-" he said, already reaching for a cloth to wipe it up when he noticed her face, the expression of absolute horror, and that she wasn't looking at the coffee flood at all.
Harry glared at him. There was still a thin smile ghosting his lips and Harry had no idea what the hell that expression was supposed to mean.
A second wave of nausea hit him. He was drained, unfocused - he might be able to cast the spell, but he definitely wouldn’t be able to control it.
“Oh sure, they’re studying for an obligatory class, they’ve all changed, let’s forgive them for whatever they did last year.”
“You don’t have to worry about that, Weasley. I think Potter would agree that it’s something we should keep just between the two of us.”
"Oh, you mean did I tell anyone how you were so plastered you decided to snog me in front of the most popular pub in Diagon Alley?"
He spoke quietly, keeping his eyes on her, but he thought he saw movement amongst the dementors. Could they hear? How intelligent were they, that wizards were able to give them orders and use them as guards and weapons?
“Look, I saw the letter Malfoy’s mother had sent him where she said they were going to Azkaban. And he really didn’t want to go, he got himself wasted on firewhisky because of it.”
“Right, well that’s ok as long as you’re outside the walls and on the topmost storey where we are now. But as soon as we enter the prison – close that door behind you – as soon as we enter the actual prison you have to stay close to me. Even if you don’t see any dementors, you need patronus protection down there. Don’t look into any of the cells either, that’s my advice. We keep the Death Eaters all the way at the bottom, so it’s quite a walk. Down the stairs here.”
“Well thanks for that generous lie, Potter, but everybody knows already, so I really don’t think they’ll be interested in the story when you decide to share it,” he hissed, not even able to keep up his indifferent sarcasm. “And I am not trying to show it off, just so we’re clear about that.”
He followed Blaise and Nott to the common room. Pansy was waiting for them there and they all walked together to the Great Hall. The other three made small talk about nothing in particular and Draco drifted along behind them. They came up from the dungeon and passed a window overlooking the grounds. Rain was drizzling from a grey and overcast sky. Draco stopped. The rain shouldn’t have surprised him. It was February after all, and since all the windows in the dungeon were under the lake, it wasn’t like he had had reason to expect anything else. And still, he had thought there would be sunshine. There was a lightness humming through him, like the one that comes with warmth and bright weather. He turned away from the window, hurried to catch up with the others and settled back in step behind them. He watched their backs and tried to determine if perhaps they were walking a little straighter. He felt as if a burden they hadn’t known they had been carrying might have been lifted. He wanted to ask Pansy about it, if perhaps she had noticed it too.
Draco woke when the first daylight filtered through the window. The sharp contours of the room came into focus in the cold, hard colours of winter mornings. Every joint in his body ached. His legs were stiff. His right shoulder felt numb. Potter’s arm lay limply across him. Draco pushed it off and sat up slowly, moving like a hundred-year-old man with brittle bones. He groaned. Potter made some muffled noise. Draco looked down at him.
“We should have a hand signal for your mood swings,” she muttered. “Then you could just do that and I could keep at a safe distance until you become a normally functioning person again.”
“I suppose,” he said, and it should have sounded haughty, like he only deigned to approve, but it was just breathless and toneless and quiet.
Potter wasn’t looking in Draco’s direction, but Draco found he had a hard time not staring at him. It was rare to see Potter not wearing his school uniform, and even though it was usually a mess, seeing him in a button-down shirt was still an altogether very different experience from the way this cheap, thin fabric hung on his shoulders. It revealed a lot of pleasant nooks and angles that the uniform usually hid.
Finally, he ended up with Hermione in the comfortable chairs in Gryffindor. She was reading, he sat across from her and tried not to think about the night before, which meant it was all he could think about. She seemed completely undisturbed by his brooding. He watched her turning the pages and probably read an entire chapter in the time it took him to gather enough courage to ask her the question. He knew he had to, to get rid of that tiny “if” that was nagging him and getting in the way of his righteous anger.
It was the strangest thing. Going to bed like everything was normal, while knowing that three of the five people in the room would only sleep for a few hours, and then they would head out to meet with Luna and Draco and the girls. And they would go to Azkaban. And in five or six hours it would all be over, and they would either be back in their beds at Hogwarts, or in auror custody, on their way to either the Ministry or St. Mungo’s.
“For the first time this year you were acting exactly like yourself,” he said. “Which was a good reminder of what you’re really like, because apparently I had forgotten.”
“Before Harry and I became… friends, I had this fight with him,” he began slowly. “I don’t even remember how it started, but I remember that I told him it didn’t matter what he had done, his side winning the war, because the next generation would be no different from the last one. I don’t think he has any idea how our government really works. You’ve probably noticed?”
He winced. He could hear Ron's voice in the hallway too. There was silence on the other end of the phone.
Harry started and looked back over his shoulder. A second later, Draco felt it too. A ripple. A chill. They were huddled with their backs to the wall where the wizard had sat and they could still feel the stones emanating heat like a fireplace, but on their faces, despite the protecting light of Harry’s patronus, they felt a biting chill and all around them they could hear the rattle of dementor breaths. The fog had thinned.
So he kissed him. Gently, carefully. Potter’s lips were chapped and dry, but his mouth was soft, he didn’t pull away. Draco could feel the silken warmth of his breath on his mouth when he pulled back. He closed his eyes for a second and swallowed. Then he lowered his hand. Potter had let go of his arm.
Draco reached the empty corridor and counted his steps down to the blank stretch of wall that was the entrance. He whispered the password and pushed the door open when it materialized.
“Depends what you’re asking for. He’s halfblood, so I’ve heard he gets things for the muggleborn too and that’s supposed to take a while. But if you’re not asking for anything too obscure or too illegal, I think about a day or two. Oh, and he can get alcohol pretty much immediately. I’m not sure if he has a stash somewhere or a deal with the house elves, but that should be easy.”
Harry stared ahead of him as his tired brain tried to make sense of what Malfoy, Draco fucking Malfoy, was asking him.
He sat unmoving on his bed for close to a minute. When he finally stood it was with forced, excessive calm. He picked up his wand from the table and placed it back in its holster. He walked down the stairs to leave the Slytherin dungeon while the common room was free and before anyone returned to his dorm. He wouldn’t be back until he felt absolutely certain they were all asleep. Perhaps he should also get up early in the morning, before any of them woke up. Minimal interaction seemed to be the best strategy for now, he needed some time to think. He should have tried to analyse the situation, figure out how to handle it, how to best run damage control, possibly spin it to his advantage and definitely plot how to take Blaise down for good, but is thoughts kept slipping. Out in the empty halls, even productive anger was hard to hold onto. He ascended to the upper floors without managing any more useful plans than a satisfying fantasy about pushing certain individuals into great, roaring fires. They all knew it wasn’t his fault, that she would have called them Death Eaters whether they walked around with Draco or not. It was almost like the silly Hufflepuff was in on some great conspiracy to take him down, along with everyone else in the whole wizarding world. It might have helped his situation a little bit, he thought, if he hadn’t looked so much like his father. He had no trouble imagining how his friends saw him now: He simply had to conjure up an image of what Lucius had become in the last months of the war. He had seen his father slowly fall apart, had seen the powerful, lethal, elegant and dignified wizard he had admired shrink back into exactly the type of person Blaise had described – grovelling, weak, mad with fear and pathetic. Draco had never thought he would see his father become pathetic. He had never thought he might see himself become pathetic.
”Because it’s not like we’re better or more moral people than everyone else in the wizarding world.”
“I got it right the second time,” said Ron, pointing at the stack of unburnt slices on a plate on the table. “Anyway, I still think we should get a muggle toaster.”
Harry tried to calculate the odds of how likely he would be to get away with it if he just straight up apparated out of there.
"Probably. I think George might come by too, I know he really wants to see Gin before she leaves for the aurors. I mean, he has the whole summer to see her, but he'll probably get Lee to look after the shop if he can. Percy's probably not gonna take time off work, but I'm pretty sure Bill and Fleur will be there."
Two weeks passed like that and he started seeing his own frustration mirrored on the faces of the others. There was very little progress on any fronts.
“Really, Potter?” he asked. “You want to have that conversation? Swap lists of dead people? Merlin, you’re messed up.”
“That was your father’s mistake, not yours, and it is the one I will never be able to forgive him for. But it’s not your fault, Draco.”
"What's wrong?" he asked, managing to sound fairly nonchalant. "Are you overcome with homophobic revulsion? Some manly Gryffindor urge to save me from my immoral ways?"
Harry glanced out the window. It had started drizzling. The headlights of a car cut through the darkness outside.
The article was fairly vague, the Ministry clearly still trying to hold back most of the information. There were no comments to questions of who could be behind the attack or what their intentions might have been, though the Ministry admitted that they didn’t suspect runaway Death Eaters, since there seemed to have been no attempt to free any prisoners. Most of the official Ministry statement concerned reassurance that a great number of aurors had been stationed at the prison to act as guards in place of the dementors, and that it was therefore still secure.
“None of us are happy about it, but apparently Dumbledore had made plans to get him and his family out of Voldemort’s hands. He was supposed to be sent abroad, but something went wrong. They got his mother out two weeks ago and they’ve been shuttling him between safe houses since then.”
And then, because Malfoy apparently wasn't the only one who was too awkward for this world, he added: "My ex-girlfriend is gay too," like an absolute pillock.
“As far as I know, Malfoy doesn’t have an invisibility cloak and I wasn’t spared from endless hours of Malfoy-theories, so…” Granger shrugged.
“No. I would have pulled my child out of school too if that was what their first year was like. Especially the muggleborn.”
“I haven’t seen you in months! It’s so nice you’re back and that you’re doing alright, you have no idea how relieved I am, but it would be nice if you would at least acknowledge that you have been ignoring my letters the whole summer. I was worried about you.”
Which of course she couldn’t. But despite all her oddness, there was a sense of omniscience about Luna. She wasn’t smart in the sharp, scalpel-like way that Hermione was, the way Malfoy was too, but she seemed to understand things on a different level than other people. There was something almost comforting about it.
“But I suppose we’ll have to split them up for now. You should take the restricted ones; I won’t be allowed to check them out anyway.”
He said it slowly, condescendingly, wanting Potter to understand how ridiculous his assumption was, but it sounded weird out loud. It always did. It had been a long time since he last had to tell anyone outright like that. Now that he thought about it, he might not actually have said it since he told his mum. A lot of people just assumed, and anyway it wasn't like Draco was dating, so it mostly didn't matter what people thought. Which was exactly why it was so absurd to be telling Potter, who he had in fact wanted to date since he was about 14, and who by all means should have known, considering they had been sworn enemies for years and Draco's homosexual tendencies ought to be the kind of thing a proper enemy would have sniffed out.
Harry looked around. They hadn’t risen far above the pit yet, but she was right: There wasn’t a single dementor on the landing or behind them, and none ahead of them either.
when the patronus is cast, which could just be a stylistic figure of course except”- she skipped another two pages ahead - ”here she says that they are also smaller in remote areas.”
“Anyway, even if it does help, it can’t be worth the agony of hanging around Gryffindors,” she said.
“She just said you were being an idiot and didn’t elaborate further,” said Daphne. “And I didn’t have anything to add.”
“I just wanted to, I don’t know, to say sorry, I guess. And make sure he was okay. I know how you all feel about him, I know how
She bent down and gave him a quick hug, and for a moment the scent of her hair enveloped him and suddenly he missed her terribly. He hugged her back, and for a second all he to do was hold on to her so she wouldn’t leave. Then she pulled away.
She was about to say something else, but then the portrait hole burst open and the rest of the Gryffindor quidditch team emerged, chatting happily. Ron made a beeline for the table where Harry and Hermione sat.
“Yeah, but we can’t really tell him not to bring her, can we? I mean, there’s already six of us and just two of them, so it wouldn’t be fair,” said Neville.
“They don’t seem to be pulling their load, do they? I mean, I don’t know about Luna, but seems to me Malfoy is just sort of hanging around waiting for us to do the work for him.”
Just a heads up that this is the last chapter I had finished, so since I'm caught up to the unfinished parts now, I can't say for sure when the next update will be, but it might be a while.
He put the parchment down and settled himself on the couch, resting his head on his hand and looking expectantly up at Harry.
“So don’t try to tell me about all the choices I had,” Draco continued. “When I realized I might want to get out, it wasn’t an option anymore.”
I cast my patronus, because I’m an idiot, and of course that didn’t help, so the boggart just went past me. And then it turned into Voldemort.”
, Weasley! Or are you talking about all of us, all the Slytherins? Because Evelyn Selwyn snapped her wand after they made her crucio that little one from Gryffindor, the Creevy-kid. She said she never wanted to do magic again, but her mother works in the ministry, and what do you think they might have done to her if they found out? It wasn’t a good time to decide to be a squib. You have no idea how long it took to get her to calm down, to get her to let us help her get a new wand so they wouldn’t find out. And the next day, they asked her to do it again. So yeah, I volunteered in those classes. If I could have volunteered then, I would have.”
“I know,” he said. “The truce is over, that’s fine. I don’t want you to spend time with me as some sort of charity event. I just wanted to tell you – because it seems the message didn’t sink in the last time – that nothing that happened in that tower mattered, so you can stop acting like you’ll die from shame just from being in the same room as me, because if you don’t, I promise you this is going to be a very long year for both of us. You’re making
She looked up and flashed him a quick, uncertain smile, as if she didn’t know whether or not he was joking. He wasn’t really sure either.
“I… don’t think so?” said Draco, feeling just as bewildered as she sounded. “I would expect Lovegood to listen to Weasley, but…”
What had he been thinking dragging him down here without warning? Why had he thought the boggart would be a good idea? Why on earth had he decided to hold his hand? And then the bloody
Draco was about to tell him that yes, of course he did, they had been taught in school, but of course
"No," Malfoy snapped. He picked the teabags out of the sink. "Oh, Draco," he said in a loud, simpering voice, as he dropped them in a pile on the counter, next to the half empty box. "I can't help but wonder, why are you living in this extraordinarily shitty flat in a neighbourhood with a name as unbelievable daft as
The Weasley’s took up positions by the door. It had taken forever to decide who should stand guard in case the aurors followed them. Ginny had been an obvious choice, since she was the strongest duellist, but Ron had plainly refused to stay behind and had looked like he wanted to punch Draco’s teeth out when he had called him their best “supporting duellist”. Ginny had asked for Longbottom, but he was better with the runes than Ron was, so in the end he had sided with Draco, as had Granger, and Ron had reluctantly agreed to guard duty.
They reached the wall, the stairs, and they climbed slowly upwards. Hermione’s breathing was laboured and gravelly, but she was carrying more of her own weight. When Harry glanced over at Draco, he looked like he was about to throw up again, but also more like himself; less empty. The two patronuses were still with them, Harry’s whole hand was buzzing and as soon as they reached the first landing, they stopped. Hermione disentangled herself from Harry and leaned against the wall breathing deeply. Harry pulled three chocolate bars from his pocket and handed them to the others. Draco took his gratefully and had devoured it before Harry had even gotten the paper off of his. Harry watched him pull a second one from his own pocket.
“I wasn’t,” said Harry. “We just talked a bit before the holidays. I thought he might have changed. I know, it’s ridiculous, you don’t have to tell me.”
Her eyes darted between them and he thought he could almost hear her brain whirring away. He stood up. Hermione’s eyes finally settled on Harry and she looked like she wanted to say something else, but then she shook her head and turned to Draco instead.
He nodded, chiding himself for the stab of disappointment he felt. Of course she hadn’t. The only people who went there were the aurors and the prisoners and none of them talked about it when they left. He didn’t think the prisoners could. Anyone who had ever been locked up in there would have to make themselves forget if they wanted to live even a halfway normal life afterwards. You couldn’t carry such a place around with you and still be a person. And as for the aurors – if it was Draco who had helped guard such a place, he wouldn’t want to tell anyone about it either. He doubted any of the witches and wizards in the Wizengamot had any idea where they sent the people they sentenced. He didn’t think a single one of them had ever been near the tower.
It was easier for him to fall asleep when he was exhausted, so he repeated the trip from the night he ran into Malfoy, and flew over the forbidden forest. The size of it was amazing. There had to be some sort of magical way to keep it off muggle-maps like there was with Hogwarts. He would have to ask Hermione or possibly Neville about it, and about whether wizards had hidden the forest or if it was its own magic. Of course it had to be big if there was an entire herd of centaurs in there, a herd of tame thestrals, a nest of acromantulas and still enough space left that Hagrid had been able to hide Grawp. And since none of those places had been too far a walk from the school grounds the forest was probably folding space within itself as well, like Hermione had theorized that the room of requirement had done.
"She says she's hopeful. But you know what the Ministry's like, even if everyone thinks it should get done as fast as possible it'll still take ages."
Seven cracks sounded on the halfway point of the path that led from Hogsmeade station to Hogwarts. The castle ahead of them was still mostly dark, but here and there a square of light was visible.
of October, Harry was waiting for Malfoy down by the quidditch pitch. He sat on one of the benches, his elbows resting on his knees and his Firebolt propped up next to him. He was watching the sky above, a great mass of grey, rolling clouds that misted the air with fine drops of rain. He could see heavier and blacker clouds on the horizon, but he figured they would be back inside before the heavy rain reached them. From the castle, a small figure was making its way towards him. The dishwater light of dusk made their meeting feel sinister and secret, a dark contrast to the golden light streaming out of the windows from the Great Hall where the feast had just begun. Malfoy was carrying his broom over his shoulder. The black school robes billowed around him in the wind and the white blond hair was whipped out of place across his haughty, handsome face. Harry stood and picked up his broom.
Draco had his eyes turned to the floor, not really seeing it, but he could still feel Potter watching him. Then he heard him move. His footsteps coming closer, and then he was next to him, leaning against the edge of the table. Not close enough that they touched, but close enough that he imposed on Draco’s space. He didn’t say anything. They watched the wallpaper on the opposite wall for a while.
“Not much. I’ve moved out of the Manor, got a flat in London, I think I mentioned that over the phone?”
He slammed the stall door closed behind him and slumped against it. He heaved a deep breath. His heart was still racing and his head was spinning, though he wasn't sure if that was from the beer or the conversation.
“Don’t look so angry, Malfoy. Just because we curse you, it doesn’t mean we’re not on the same side, remember?” said Neville Longbottom.
He thought he heard a disdainful snort from Malfoy, but when he looked over, Malfoy had his eyes fixed straight ahead and his expression was calm and focused. The castle was far behind them, the mountains slowly getting closer. He could hear the flapping of their cloaks in the wind and he wondered why he had never thought to do this with Ron or Ginny or anyone else from the quidditch team. He didn’t mind company up here. Here, there was space for it, around him and in his head.
“No, of course not. Everybody knows you hate me; they’d assume it was blackmail. I want us to stop hating each other for no reason, just as you suggested.”
He stood for a moment out in the hallway, gathering himself and watching the door fade away into the stones. He had no idea why he had just had this conversation. Or what exactly it was he had been trying to tell Granger. One thing did seem pretty clear though. They were never going to figure out what to do about the pit no matter how much time they spent on research. He would have to tell Harry that they had found a way to kill the dementors. They didn’t have any more excuses to wait. And it would probably turn out to be exactly as Granger predicted: they would go and try to do the impossible, probably find themselves underprepared for it, and then wait for chaos to break loose around them. It was nice to know that at least some of them had tried that before, because personally, he was terrified.
The warmth lingered and they stayed outside for the rest of the afternoon. Dean, Seamus and Hannah Abbott joined them under the willow later on and overall it was very pleasant, except Harry felt like they might have dismissed the issue of Malfoy a little too quickly. He didn’t bring it up again, but he couldn’t stop worrying and their apparent carelessness annoyed him. When they went to the Great Hall for dinner, he kept an eye on the Slytherin table as it filled up. Malfoy wasn’t with Blaise Zabini and Daphne Greengrass, or with Tracey Davis, Millicent Bulstrode and Pansy Parkinson, who came in shortly after the other two. In fact, he didn’t show up until the food had already appeared on the tables, and when he did he was by himself.
“We cut off the source,” said Draco, the realization dawning on him as from all sides dementors turned their faces towards them. “They’re choking.”
“Well, this is also the only place where we can buy firewhisky. He doesn’t care that we’re in school,” said Malfoy, gesturing towards Aberforth, who was in the middle of pouring a greenish liquid into the glasses of two figures at the bar wearing identical, broad rimmed hats with black veils hanging down from them.
Harry snorted. Malfoy's eyes snapped back to him and Harry quickly wiped the grin off his face - he hadn't meant to laugh, he just hadn’t expected Malfoy to actually say something honest in the middle of all his bullshit. Harry cleared his throat.
“Well, my new place isn’t connected to the floo. And I assumed you wouldn’t open a letter from me so…”
It’s not a fair response, even if it’s honest. He shouldn’t ask Potter to insist on forgiving him and it’s not like he actually wants him to take it back.
“An old Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom down here. I found it a few days ago, I thought we could use it.”
He doesn’t give a fuck about Weasley. He shifts on the bed, reaching for the watch on his bedside table, the bedsprings creak and wail.
“No? You have your wand out – are you sure you don’t want to disarm me just to be on the safe side?”
There was no answer and Harry glanced back over his shoulder. Draco was still following closely behind him, but he wasn’t looking ahead; he had his eyes fixed on the nearest dementor and the light from his patronus had faded to a dim glow. The snake was only a thin thread of silver. As Harry watched, one of the dementors surged forward and the patronus snapped and winked out. Draco flinched and raised his wand reflexively:
used to feel about him, but he looked completely wrong, so I sort of… held his hand. Because Hermione said this thing that wizards are different about that. Blokes and blokes and such, so I didn’t think it would mean anything, I could hold Hermione’s hand if she were upset and that wouldn’t mean anything either.”
“At least Slughorn said you could spend your detention remaking your potion, so you’ll still have something to turn in,” said Hermione.
“Watch your tone, Harry,” said Ron coldly. “I think you’re starting to take after your favourite Slytherin.”
Draco was on his second cup of coffee when the owls arrived. They swooped in through the windows and his nerves spiked again as all around him the day’s
“You can’t even imagine what it’s like,” he continued. “The prisoners, they’re… It’s so wrong. They’re not even people anymore. I couldn’t tell which ones were dead and which ones were still alive; there was nothing in their eyes. My father was just… I don’t think he recognized us. He was half dead.”
Shortly after Draco had left the Manor, Pansy had moved out of Parkinson Park and into the family's town house in London. It was an old wizarding neighbourhood and every house had an apparition point, a small luxury that Draco had never expected he would be this jealous of. At least tonight, it allowed him to be less late than he already was. He apparated to the pavement immediately across from of the old house and allowed himself only a small moment to straighten his robes before he crossed the street with even steps, forcing his shoulders down, his pace to be relaxed. He rang the door and a moment later he was let inside by a house elf, who took his coat and called him Master Malfoy, and led him down the hall to where the others were already spread out in the lovely parlour with glasses of mead and firewhisky in their hands. There were candles lit and the furniture was lovely, if a bit too baroque for his taste, and the whole scene was so achingly familiar Draco forgot for a second that he didn't want to be there. Daphne shrilled and jumped out of her seat at the sight of him, and Draco noticed the way Blaise's eyes slid approvingly over the cut of Draco's robes, and none of them actually asked why he was late, so maybe Pansy had already come up with some excuse for him. He sank into a chair and accepted the glass that was handed to him and tried to remember how to do this, how to be this version of himself. He used to love their parties. He loved exchanging looks with Pansy when Blaise's smug bragging got too grandiose, he loved Greg's horrible jokes, and Tracey's quiet laugh, but after weeks and weeks around muggles he felt like he was seeing double, the scene simultaneously the most normal thing in the world and completely foreign to him. He had gotten so much quieter now that he spent most of his socializing in contexts that required him to carefully edit his vocabulary to clear it of anything magic, and the habit lingered. And what would he have to say to them anyway? They all had careers and love lives and promising futures; Draco only had vague half-truths and amusing muggle anecdotes, and those took careful wording too, to edit out any actual facts related to his job or his flat or his new friends.
They went flying again. Over the forest, almost to the mountains before they turned back. By then the days had gotten short and even though it wasn’t that late, dark had fallen and it felt like the middle of the night when they walked back to the castle. Draco listened to the sound of their footsteps as they made their way up to the hill. The air smelled of the coming frost. They were quiet – they had been yelling and howling when they flew, but now they walked silently almost shoulder to shoulder.
“She’s a nice girl. I didn’t know she played quidditch. Do you think maybe we should head back soon?”
There was no counter attack, but neither lowered their wand either. Draco quickly surveyed the hands of the other Hufflepuffs as well as his fellow Slytherins, and no one else had their wands out yet, which was good. The last thing they needed was for this to escalate further. Of course
He hammered his cup down and stood up. He wouldn’t be able to keep himself from crying if he had to look at her crestfallen face.
She leaned conspiratorially across the table and lowered her voice. Her eyes were bright and shining.
Draco had returned to Hogwarts, but he was a ghost. He went mechanically through the motions of the day. He felt as if he had not woken up in the morning and was living in a sleepwalking state until he could go back to sleep at night. It had been more than a week since Azkaban, and it was as if he still hadn’t recovered. He still felt the dementor’s clammy grasp on his mind. He was not awake when his eyes were open. He was not sure he wanted to wake up. He thought there was something waiting for him when he did.
It seemed an odd thing to speak to the snake; it was not a magical creature or even a conjured one, just an apparition of his own magic. But as soon as he spoke, the snake raised its head and watched him attentively.
They stayed up there until the sun started to set and the air became too chilly. They didn’t talk about Harry’s friends or what would happen if they were caught or how hard it was not to look at each other in class, how hard it was to know that they couldn’t touch each other or speak to each other when anyone else was watching. They just talked about dumb things, funny things, things people had said and done during the week.
Eventually, he would have to go back in there. He had two hours left before he could go home. He swallowed hard, straightened up and pulled the pack of cigarettes from his pocket. His fingers were shaking.
Harry was laughing again, overjoyed with flight, rushed with adrenaline, it sounded maniacal even to his own ears, but he couldn’t have cared less.
It was her fault that they were here. She had made this decision, she had pressed the Ministry about it, pulled strings, bribed whoever she needed to and ignored every single one of Draco’s protests. He had been so angry with her ever since he got her letter. But he still reached for her hand. She flinched when his fingers brushed hers, but then she took his hand and held on. They shouldn’t have come here. If she had another breakdown, he wasn’t sure she would recover. He cast another glance over the edge. It was such a long way down.
“Next time I’ll cast the patronus charm before it gets past you. And if I can’t, one of us will just cast
“It’s not like that’s what he learned it for, you squib,” Pansy snapped, and Matthew didn’t say anything else.
"Only one way to get over that, mate," said one of the boys. "First beer is the hardest. Then you've scaled the wall and it's all downhill from there."
“She’s always been like that about homework… And Luna and Dra- Malfoy are working on the other thing too.”
He looked down at his essay. It had his name and the date at the top, and a sorry-looking, half finished sentence beneath. He couldn’t remember what he had just read or what he had been meaning to write. He put down his quill.
Harry went back to his dormitory to try and get some homework done. Since the mission of Azkaban had started, he had actually managed to get behind on schoolwork again. But he struggled to keep focus, he kept forgetting his place and had to start over again, so he hadn’t read more than a few pages when Ron showed up.
Despite having taken most of the same classes last year, the curriculum was different enough that Draco still had a hard time keeping up his grades. He still had to put up with being the scapegoat of Slytherin. The holidays were looming ever closer. He had dreams of Azkaban almost every night. But there was also this: Potter sending him looks across classrooms - rolling his eyes at him when Slughorn’s monologues were derailed by anecdotes about his famous former students; looking exasperated when McGonagall announced the horrendous length requirements for papers in transfiguration. He wasn’t sure if it was because of Granger’s warning, but they didn’t say hi to each other in the halls. Instead they exchanged imperceptible nods, and Draco found that this was actually better. Befriending Potter became easier the less public it was. It kept Potter’s private army of devoted fans from interfering. It kept Draco from trying to spin their every interaction into a performance.
Harry didn’t apologize to Hermione in the morning. She was unnecessarily cheery and polite to him at breakfast and clearly wanted to pretend the fight hadn’t happened, so Harry went along with it. They were almost halfway through the school year now and had long ago settled into their routines, so it was easy to go through the motions of the day as if nothing had happened. Even Harry being tense and irritable had become part of their new dynamic. He did sleep better and was doing more of his homework by day now, but that hadn’t improved much on his mood. He had realized about a week ago that this was as good as it was going to get. He had returned to Hogwarts with a knot of tense apprehension in his stomach that had never been there before, but he had convinced himself that sooner or later that feeling would go away. Even if the castle reminded him of all the things he had lost and of how out of place he was there now, sooner or later that claustrophobic and oppressive air would have to subside and it would once again become the place of wonder, freedom and safety that it had been when he was younger, and he would feel at home again. But it was November now, and he still caught himself walking on tiptoes down the stairs, keeping close to the walls, sitting hunched over his food at meals. Things he hadn’t done for years. Things he used to do when he lived with the Dursleys.
"Merlin, how drunk are you?" Draco muttered as he directed Potter to a doorway where he slumped over on the doorstep with his head between his knees.
But despite the angry protests of Ron and Ginny, of Fred and George, and the increasingly tired faces of the adults, there isn’t anything they can do about it. And the next morning, Hagrid arrives, a polyjuiced Draco and two black dragon skin suitcases in tow. Ron leaves the house in anger, slamming every door on the way and is gone for hours.
“We have to do something, right? She’s going to tell someone, and then they’ll tell someone else. Everyone’s going to find out.”
“But I imagine you’re hosting Dumbledore’s Army’s preparty now that you have developed such a great love for firewhisky?”
“I don’t know, but you’re being all snarky and condescending, and you usually reserve that for people who aren’t me.”
He jumped from the seat and the four of them pushed out of their compartment into the crowded centre aisle.
Fucking Potter had looked absolutely perfect when they met - a bit ruffled, a bit awkward, his hair had been an awful mess, but somehow that had just added to the square-jawed heroism of his overall appearance, that he could be that careless and still look that good.
They were brewing skelegro in Potions, and as with most healing draughts it was a very complicated process. The lesson had even been extended, as they wouldn’t have been able to finish within the timespan of a normal lesson. Draco was almost as good with healing potions as with antidotes, so he allowed himself to also keep an eye on Potter across the classroom. Judging from the look of hard concentration on his face, he was struggling more than Draco.
"It went fine, I suppose. I said what I wanted to but - do you remember that pub near my flat I've mentioned? I asked him if we could meet there since it's near the tube station - that's the underground trains I've told you about - anyway, I thought it'd be easy for him to find so… not that it made a difference, though, he was half an hour late, but the place is
“Shit,” he said. “This is ridiculous! Why did I ever think we could pull this off? How come it’s a dementor? I don’t see why you’re afraid of them if you’ve been able to cast a patronus since you were
“No, I absolutely agree with you. But we are all representatives of our families, aren’t we? And it would be ridiculous if the reputation of the entirety of Slytherin House and all the noble families of Britain was ruined by a few corrupted people, who were too eager to grovel in front of some self-proclaimed lord, right?”
“I’m sorry. I thought… It’s not as strong as a real dementor. I thought you’d be able to cast a patronus.”
to assume that there is a vast, hidden magical society existing invisibly in parallel with their own. They assume I'm just weird."
Draco looked back at the Hufflepuffs as the rest of the group descended on their friend,whose wand now hung limply at her side – was she crying?
He sounds pissy and obnoxious, and something settles inside Harry. It feels familiar. He knows how to talk to this version of Draco, knows the routine push and shove of their interactions. So he puts a hand on the door and pushes it back.
There was no resistance at all. He fell forwards into those black eyes, the floor disappeared under his knees as he was swallowed by a storm of memories.
Draco was very, very drunk. He had been about to fall asleep when Potter called him back. Potter said something Draco didn’t quite catch. And then he was messing up Draco’s hair. He laughed and ran his fingers through it and the touch sent a shiver through him. The hand curled around the back of his neck, fingertips still playing with strands of his hair, and the touch was warm and soft. Something was off about it. Potter was laughing. The warm hand didn’t move. Draco wasn’t sure what it was that was off, and he liked how it felt. He liked the weight of it and he liked how Potter looked this close, the brightness in his drunk eyes and the way his smile curled his lips. He didn’t think Potter had ever actually smiled at him before.
“Dad?” he said only just loud enough for Harry to hear him and his voice sent a chill down Harry’s spine.
And Potter was avoiding him. Draco could have tried to explain that he had not broken the deal, since the scene in the tower should not count as “bothering Potter or his friends” just because Potter was oversensitive and had been raised by muggles, but it didn’t seem like it would make a difference. Potter wouldn’t even look at him. He shouldn’t have cared about it, but he did. It even overshadowed the looming dread of Azkaban. At least in the daytime. Night was when the dementors came. He dreamt of meeting his father in endless, dark corridors, and then didn’t dream because he didn’t sleep. Sometimes he would lie awake tracing the Dark Mark on his skin. It was raised and uneven like scar-tissue.
Harry nodded. Luna and Ginny took off, the rest of them turned to the stairs. Draco was the first one to notice the figure who sat huddled on the top step and he jerked back in surprise. Harry recognized the green hems of Slytherin and already had his wand raised before he realized who it was.
He wishes he didn’t sound so bitter, but he can feel himself getting angry again at the unfairness of it all. There are so many things he has to do, that people need him to do, this is just another reminder that his life isn’t really his own and maybe it never was. It was the same with Ginny – they hardly had any time together, he had even less time to figure out his feelings about her than he has had to figure out his feelings about Draco, and then he didn’t even get to break up with her for normal reasons. And he’ll probably be dead by the end of this year if he doesn’t figure out a way to kill Voldemort, so does it even matter? Does it even matter which one of them he would choose, or that he didn’t know until now that choosing Draco was an option, when it’s so unlikely that all three of them will make it through the war?
And so he moves into the small attic space in the Burrow, which they have actually tried to make cosy – it isn’t, but they obviously tried. And it’s just another of about a thousand things that day that makes him choke back tears. He feels raw. He feels empty, like he has been crying all day even though he hasn’t, not once. Every emotion is tangled up with another; the guilt is homesickness is anger is disappointment is guilt.
He looked down at their hands as he threaded his fingers through Potter’s fingers. Because he was an idiot. He was a constant disappointment to himself. When he looked up, Potter was watching him again and his face was so close. Draco stared into those startlingly green eyes and tried to read the expression in them. Potter leaned in.
He moved on down the centre aisle of the train. After Ronald and Ginny Weasley followed Hermione Granger and Harry Potter, both of whom shot quick glances at the Slytherins as they passed. They left the door open. Pansy had turned to the window looking even more annoyed now, so Draco got up to close it. He heard the voices of the Gryffindors continuing further down the train and resisted the urge to stay by the door and eavesdrop. He slid the door shut. He hesitated with his hand on the handle.
Half an hour later, the train pulled into King’s Cross Station, and all four of them turned to the windows, scanning the crowd to look for their families. Harry thought he caught a glimpse of bright red hair and his heart skipped several beats. The breaks of the Hogwarts Express shrieked and Harry climbed onto the seat to pull his trunk from the luggage rack. Draco looked paler than usual, like he might faint any moment.
He poured himself a glass of water, drained it and then headed to the bathroom to brush his teeth. He did need to sleep. Despite his best efforts to avoid it, he had ended up with a morning shift, and if he didn't get at least seven hours he would definitely end up murdering someone before he was halfway through the day.
Quidditch was one of the great things about being back at Hogwarts. Most of the Gryffindor players had had their quidditch-privilege revoked last year, but everyone had been catching up over the summer and by now the team was getting really good. Harry felt lighter and happier as he walked back up to Gryffindor tower after practice. He had hurried to leave the locker-room afterwards and had pretended not to notice Ron’s questioning look when he left. It felt like the pleasant lightness would be disturbed if he had hung around to listen to the noise and chatter of his teammates.
It was only when he reached the portrait of the fat lady, that he realized that he was still smiling like an idiot, and quickly wiped the grin off his face. The fat lady was asleep in her frame. He cleared his throat, but she didn’t wake.
“It’s fine,” he said. “I need to talk to Malfoy about the patronus charm anyway. I’ll meet you back in the common room.”
He wonders if this is what it was like when his parents got married – if they also had to carve out every inch of normalcy and happiness from the closing darkness of the world around them.
Her brother followed and Finnigan and Thomas joined them on the way out. Everyone else had already gone.
His mother reached for him, and he freed himself from Slughorn’s grip and walked into her arms. She held him a long time before she let go.
He regretted that decision now. He regretted a lot of things, one of them being telling Potter that he could bring half of Gryffindor if he thought that would help, because apparently the git had taken him on his word. He had expected him to bring Granger, maybe even hoped that he would. As obnoxious as she was, he could see the use of having Potter’s smarter, more magically talented friend working along with them. He knew that Potter would probably bring Ronald, which would be a pain, but an unavoidable one that he would have to work with. He had thought it would end there. He had not expected Ginevra, and definitely not Lovegood or Longbottom, who had just followed her into the room.
of what he had done would allow him to walk into a room and not be met with immediate suspicion, or at least not be met with that from Potter. And when Potter brought him his wand, and they had talked and it had been perfectly civil, he had allowed himself to believe it had actually worked. Clearly, that wasn't the case. Draco gestured towards the bar.
“Hermione is hurt. She got burned by fiendfyre, I think it might have gotten in her throat, or she was too close when it exploded, she can’t breathe properly, I don’t have time to explain how-“
But he'd managed it eventually. He'd gotten his shitty little flat and a shitty job at a bar, which he'd thankfully replaced with a slightly less shitty job in a coffee shop. He'd learned how to use the tube and the phone, ignored the disapproving letters from his mother and settled into his new life. And it wasn't that bad. It was fine, as long as he didn't think too far ahead. He had his flat and his job, a couple of new friends, some contact with his old friends, but he knew he couldn't return to the wizarding world. He didn't have a muggle education either, and no hope of being approved for getting one. There was no way to move forward, and that thought was so hard to get rid of. Even on good days, it was there, constantly nagging in the back of his mind. Things were fine. It was just that his whole life felt temporary.
Harry leaned against the wall. There was a microwave in the kitchen. Harry couldn't remember the last time he had seen one of those. It had probably been at Hermione's parent’s house, but he hadn't visited them in forever. He really didn't spend a lot of time in muggle homes anymore.
“Do you think it would work? You think blowing it up would make whatever it is, the evil, go away too?”
“It’s been less than two months since you sat there trying to convince us all of how important this was and we both know that place is evil-“
“So you know that I can keep it a secret, and I’m sure Potter believes his people would be able to keep quiet as well, yet neither of you have told anyone?”
“Stop that,” she said. “Really. Being heroic doesn’t suit you. Besides, we’re not the heroes, remember?”
The skeletal man didn’t move. His chest rose and fell and Draco was uncomfortably aware that his own breathing had synchronized with that slow rhythm.
He wondered if the swear would still work if it wasn’t true when you said it. He honestly couldn’t remember if he had ever used the map without going against either school rules or with the deliberate intent of not following someone’s advice. He tried not to think about what Hermione had said and he tried not to feel silly. He wasn’t being silly – he just couldn’t sleep. He couldn’t sleep and the creeping sense of coming disaster had returned. He felt that if something did go wrong this year, it would be his fault. If Malfoy was plotting something or if Death Eaters were breaking into Hogwarts or Voldemort was somehow coming back to life, he was the one who had to stop it. Not that he really believed any of those things were happening, it was just a feeling. He knew what Ron and Hermione – and Ginny and probably everyone else – would say if he told them. But it didn’t matter that it wasn’t rational, it didn’t make it go away. So he found the Slytherin common room on the map and he checked and double-checked, and his heart rate picked up when he realized that Malfoy wasn’t in his dorm. Since all the other students were clustered around the common rooms, it didn’t take long to find the dot labelled Draco Malfoy, which was on its own, out of bounds and headed towards the owlery. Harry took a deep breath and for a second tried half-heartedly to dissuade himself from what he knew he was about to do anyway. Then he swung his feet over the edge of the bed, got dressed in a hurry, and left his dorm with the marauder’s map in hand.
In Gryffindor, Harry had returned to the common room to find that his friends regrouped by the fireplace and waiting for him.
“I’ve changed my mind,” said Malfoy. “Go back down to Gryffindor. I just realized I prefer to drink alone.”
After potions when everyone else was packing up, Draco left his things by his desk and walked to the Gryffindor side of the classroom. The Weasley girl was the first one to notice him.
Harry was still seething with anger when they left potions. He and Malfoy had cleaned up without saying a word to each other. Ron and Hermione waited for him and he left the dungeon with them.
She said it evenly, no one could ever have heard her and claimed that she was complaining. But there was also something in her voice like this was something she had carried around for a while, that it had been weighing her down more than she cared to admit even to herself, and he guessed she probably hadn’t told anyone else.
“And I just – I really like him. And if keeping it from them is what it takes for him to want to be with me, then I’m fine with that. I’m happy with things as they are.”
“Yeah,” Ron interrupted. “Your time is very valuable. Right now it may seem like you’re just an unemployed freeloader-“
Harry had paired up with Ron, which was obviously an unfair match. Harry was faster, his spells stronger and more varied. Weasley was mostly on the defensive and it was an easy duel to follow as he used hardly any non-verbal spells. Both his attacks and defences were very predictable, straight-forward, typical duelling spells. Draco suspected Potter was going easy on him or he would have already disarmed him.
He cleared his throat demonstratively and recited: “I swear that I am not plotting anything that will hurt you, your friends or anyone else. So you can stop stalking me now.”
Harry had braced himself for some level of surprise on Malfoy's part when he showed up here unannounced. He had lined up arguments in his head, or excuses, though to be fair they had vanished the second Malfoy's voice came out the entryphone. Anyway, they wouldn't have helped him. He hadn't exactly expected his method of transportation to be the thing Malfoy would have issues with.
“Do you think maybe we could-“ he began again, but before he could finish his sentence, a mighty crash sounded from above.
Then they went into the sea of dementors and it parted for them, but only just. Draco walked quietly beside him now, his wand held steadily, his snake patronus beside him. It had been easier for Harry to forget his own fear when Draco was panicking before. Now he could hear his words echoing in his mind:
“I still think it’s completely unreasonable to have us redo this year and then make us take the same classes all over again,” added Daphne. “At least they could let us drop the things we’ve already passed with proper teachers.”
"Right, because you're dramatic. I saw the way you and Potter glared at each other when we passed - do you really still have that grudge going?"
“What, you think Slytherins could have made it look good in second year when the Chamber was opened and everyone found out I was a parselmouth?”
Harry was seriously considering not going that evening. It would be so much easier to just pretend he had forgotten. He could talk to Malfoy later, when he was able to look at his face without thinking about the kiss.
“Dumbledore said he’d protect you and your mother. You could have gone to the Order of the Phoenix or you could have stayed at Hogwarts in the room of requirement or-“
“Look, you don’t have to worry, this is the most discreet table in here. Unless people actually come over they won’t hear us and we can’t be seen either,” said Malfoy.
It was so strange that Dean and Seamus were together. It was even more strange that no one cared. Maybe Dean did, even if he didn’t say anything. He had grown up in the muggle world too, after all.
, and despite having seen him in his muggle clothes and his muggle flat, Harry still hadn't really believed that he actually lived like this. It was so far removed from everything he knew about him, and he couldn't understand
“Hi – I thought you’d have all gone to bed by now?” Harry said and tried not to sound accusatory, even though the whole scene felt unnervingly like an ambush.
"Aren't we what? I'm not responsible for her or her bad taste, she's free to do what she likes as long as I don't have to watch."
“Wait, are you actually here to get private information about me? Did you somehow become a journalist since the last time I saw you?”
“You’re such a Gryffindor, Weasley,” said Parkinson before Ginny could finish her sentence or Harry could think of anything to say. “You love simple stories with shiny heroes and terrible villains, but that’s not how the world works.”
“My father writes a lot about magical creatures in his Magazine. I don’t know if he’s ever done anything on Dementors, we mostly do more useful or interesting creatures, but I could write and ask him about it…”
“Yeah, I didn’t see it coming either. It’s definitely in the top hundred of completely unexpected things that happened in the last year or so.”
Padma and Hannah might have left at some point. And then there had been a lot of people Harry didn't know, they might have been Terry's friends. One of them had asked for his autograph. Was that when he had decided to leave?
“Luna and I can take the brooms back to the locker rooms,” said Ginny when they were almost at the steps to the Entrance Hall. “You two just hurry and get Hermione to the Hospital Wing.”
It was not at all like duelling with Pansy. Draco would get competitive even with her, but it was something entirely else when he was facing Potter and Weasley. Longbottom wasn’t as bad of a partner as he could have feared, but they were not even a minute into their duel before it became clear that the two of them were the inferior team. Draco was sweating in his robes and his jaw was clenched as he fired a close succession of three different, non-verbal disarming spells at Potter, all of which were deflected either by Potter or Weasley. And bloody Weasley – he was turning out to be a nightmare in a duel as soon as it wasn’t just one on one. His spells were no less dull or predictable, but now they were suddenly well placed, covering Harry where he opened up, he was constantly moving about so Draco more than once almost hit Longbottom when he tried to throw a spell in his direction. Draco’s heart was pounding and he was out of breath, but the adrenaline was worth every painful stab through his lungs. Longbottom’s voice sounded far away when he yelled for him to duck. Draco did and a needle of light shot over his head. He was back up in a second, so caught up in the game he hardly noticed the growing noise to his left, the bright bursts of light were only slight irritations in his peripheral vision. It was only when a loud, resounding crash bellowed around them that he turned to look at the other group. His wand was snatched from his hand by a disarming spell a second later, and he didn’t even know if it was Harry or Weasley who cast it. When he glanced back, they had all lowered their wands too, and like him they were staring wide eyed at Pansy and Ginny.
“Alright,” he said, but he still looked sort of lost there by the door, like he didn’t know where to look or what to do about himself.
He had returned to that scenario a couple of times, mulling over it again, trying to decide if he believed in the second one. Of course it would be impossible to predict, but it was just as impossible not to try. Mostly because if he did not believe in the second one, then he could never try to bring Draco to the Burrow. If there was a chance that Harry choosing Draco would hurt Mrs Weasley, he knew there wasn’t really any choice. If he ever had to choose between Draco and his friends, he would choose his friends. That was just how it was.
“No–“ Harry gasps, getting to his feet, slipping and staggering, plunging towards Draco, whose face is shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest. Harry falls to his knees beside him. Draco is shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood, eyes rolling back into his head.
Draco walked to the restricted section at the far end of the library. It was roped off so people didn’t wander in there by mistake, though it was unlikely anyone would – it felt different than the rest of library in a way that was impossible not to notice, like some of the darkness and some of the power sealed in the books had seeped into the air and made it prickle against the skin.
They moved as fast as they could along the galleries of the fifth floor and then the sixth. The voices of people shouting curses became clearer, the light of the spells continued to flash like lightning above them, but Hermione wasn’t breathing right and each step seemed to cause her agony, so by the time they reached the second floor from the top, they had once again slowed almost to a walk. She heaved in gasps of air and then coughed hard, buckling over and clinging to Harry to stay upright.
He reached the apparition point in front of the house. He had asked Hermione about them. Apparently he had been apparating illegally all over London for the past year and no one had bothered to tell him. Harry checked that the street was empty, then pulled out his wand.
He got a beer. It wasn't as bad as he'd feared. The hangover potion had done its work, and he'd at least gotten in a decent amount of sleep before he decided to put himself in a bar again.
“The parseltongue might have been hard to get around, but a good interview could have framed it better… And seriously, even when I was 10 I could handle public attention better than you did during the triwizard tournament.”
“Whatever pleases you, Potter. I never thought you had much interest in doing anything the Slytherin way.”
Harry dragged a jar on the edge of his table towards him, popped the lid open and took a handful of the white sand inside. He let it run through his fingers into the cauldron. Malfoy didn’t go away.
“Of course not, Harry never realizes when he’s being an idiot,” she said, and Draco breathed a secret sigh of relief.
“It wouldn’t make sense for the Wizengamot to clear him of charges and then not allow him to finish his education.”
“So what, when you’re attacked by dementors you can’t defend yourself until you’ve had time to forget the horrifying thing in front of you and really focus on thinking nice thoughts to yourself? That doesn’t seem very effective. And I don’t believe for a second that you had that much mental discipline at 13.”
year when Harry knows he was falling apart, he still looked more put together than he does now. He shouldn’t have kissed him, shouldn’t have opened that door again. There had been a terrible look on Malfoy’s face, just for a moment, when Harry was about to leave, and maybe part of him just wanted to make sure he was okay. Which isn’t exactly something he can tell him.
Granger looked slightly embarrassed at that, which for a moment seemed odd to Draco, but then he remembered how dismissive Granger usually was of Lovegood. Lovegood’s handwriting had been all over their notes for the last month and a half, and he had dismissed them because she was crazy and he found her slightly unnerving, but Granger had done the same thing, and wasn’t that interesting considering that they were supposed to be friends?
“Then I don’t know what it is you think you’re doing,” he said, “because usually, when you follow people around to spy on them, that is considered stalking.”
But then they'd had time, and Ron and Hermione had started to breathe easier, and Harry had just slept less and less. He'd been constantly tired. He hadn't talked much to the other people in the auror training program, and he had never gone with them when they went out for drinks. Ron had done his best to bring him along, to drag him into conversations, and he'd been nice about it, but Harry had known he was holding him back, getting in the way of Ron making new friends. Harry hadn't wanted to make new friends. He hadn't liked any of them much. He'd dragged himself through four months of training and hated every minute of it, but it had taken Hermione sitting him down and telling him he had to quit before he'd even realized that it wasn’t supposed to be like that. He'd just assumed everyone else hated it too – half the time all they'd talked about was how hard it was and how unfair the teachers were. He supposed he'd expected it to be more like the DA or the Order of the Phoenix. Something that made sense, seemed meaningful, where he could keep doing what he was good at. It turned out fighting Voldemort didn’t actually prepare you for working in law enforcement. Most people there hadn't been like Tonks or Moody. It turned out Harry wasn’t very good at following orders. It turned out he still hated the Ministry – it was changing after the war, sure, but it wasn’t changing very quickly. His instructors, the older officers, hadn't wanted him to think for himself, but he sure as hell hadn't been going to let them think for him.
"Yeah, he's got this big tattoo down his forearm, like," Irie said, extending her own arm to point out the spot. "Snake and a skull? It's pretty cool."
“I was thinking it might be a good idea if we left them back in the secret room,” she said. “Then we’ll both have access to all of them all the time and if we find something new we can just leave it for each other up there. We’ll avoid having to talk to each other where people might notice, and we also won’t have large stacks of suspicious books on dark magic lying around our dormitories.”
“Really?” he said. “House Malfoy might have lost its political influence, that’s true, but who do you honestly expect to take its place? House Longbottom? I would say Zabini or Greengrass are both better guesses: Both ancient and noble houses with a rather more significant political history than any of the ancient houses tied to Gryffindor. Both houses are also known blood purists. I can count on two hands how many seats have opened in the Wizengamot now that you’ve flushed out the Death Eaters – one hand, probably, depending on how you define “open”. Soldiers don’t do politics, heroes rarely do politics, which means that outside of wars, they don’t have any power. Has it completely escaped your notice that that the wizarding government is an aristocracy, not a democracy?”
Potter grimaced and slumped back against the wall. He really was very drunk, clumsy and heavy-limbed, still holding a beer in his hand that he should probably give up on. It ought to have made him less attractive, Draco thought, and yet somehow it didn't. His cheeks were flushed, his eyes unfocused, his movements badly coordinated, but all of it just meant he was leaning against the wall closer to Draco than he ever would have if he had been sober. Close enough their shoulders nearly touched, and Draco wished he hadn't noticed that because now those inches between them felt burning. He looked away and took another drag of his cigarette.
“You asked me to meet you," he said. "Why? What’s with the small talk? I think we can safely assume neither of us is here for the pleasure of the company, so why don’t you drop the niceties and tell me what this is about?”
Harry wasn't particularly angry when he left the pub. The irritation snuck up on him when he missed his train by a few seconds and had to wait another fifteen minutes on a bench next to a loud group of drunk teenagers, who were pretending to push each other onto the tracks, shrieking loudly and setting his nerves on edge. Harry looked down at the scuffed toes of his sneakers and tried to tune out their voices, but then Malfoy's face slid back into his mind, formal and apologetic and Harry wished he hadn't let him off so easily. He should have asked what Malfoy wanted from him, why he had decided to call him out of nowhere, why he had decided to do it
It turned out Draco did, and it took only a couple of minutes to wipe the memories of the four aurors. Draco took care of the two who had collapsed the farthest from them, Hermione the ones right where they stood. Once it was done, a strange quiet settled among  them. They stood close together next to the bodies of the stunned aurors, hurt and exhausted and right by the door that would lead them out, but none of them moved to leave.
He passed Harry the bottle. They were a good way through it. Harry didn’t know how much was necessary to get drunk. Probably less than this.
She went through his stack of books and picked out a few of them for herself. They began going through the indexes. Once or twice he would ask her about a section or a chapter. She looked at him strangely when he did – not like it bothered her, but as if she was slightly surprised by the question, or maybe just by his presence, as if she had forgotten he was there.
Draco’s eyes snapped back to him, but Potter was looking past him now with a strange, uncomfortable expression on his face, as if he had just confessed something very embarrassing.
He isn’t lying, though. He isn’t lying, but it still takes Draco a second to comprehend the words. A second to reshape the memory. A dark tower on a cold night, a flash of green, an old man falling limply over the battlements. Draco’s wand still pointed at him, even if he didn’t cast the spell. And Potter there, watching the whole thing. Draco feels like he’s falling. His skin is jittery, he wants to run, but he remains stiffly frozen in place.
"Hey!" he called after one of the bartenders, knowing full well he was being rude, but at that moment he couldn't have cared less.
“Yeah,” she said, just late enough to give the impression sense that she actually lived in her own time and space and conveying words just took slightly longer with her because they had to travel to her realm first.
They continued down the galleries, down staircases, once again accompanied by their three patronuses. Harry kept glancing back at Draco. He regretted bringing him. He should have convinced him to stay back – he should have tried, at least.
Harry slammed the front door behind him and kicked off his shoes next to the troll-leg umbrella stand (Ron had insisted they keep it). Harry was two steps up the stairs when he heard movement from the living room.
And everything inside him froze. He still had his arm stretched out towards her and her eyes moved ever so slowly from the mark to his face. Draco felt his lungs collapse, his heart dropping into his stomach. Her mouth was moving but for a second no words came out.
Potter groaned and turned around so he had his back to Draco. They still had about forty minutes until breakfast. That meant their dorm mates would probably be awake, so they wouldn’t be able to go back to bed and pretend they had never been away, but it was enough time that Potter could get back to Gryffindor tower and change into something more appropriate before students flooded the halls. Draco picked up his tie.
No matter how many hours they had spent working together on this by now, he knew that in her eyes, this still wasn’t his place.
They stopped by a pedestrian crossing. The street was deserted. The silence was more noticeable standing still. Harry watched the light impatiently. It seemed intent on staying red forever. Harry gritted his teeth.
Draco’s skull felt like it might burst. He saw hundreds of memories of war and felt hundreds of people’s grief like beetles scurrying through his brain, a thousand tiny legs, he watched stone walls being erected around his limp body, he watched his own hand as he erected a building to hold the immortal wizard and the monsters he had spawned forever. A heaviness had settled in his chest, he was so afraid. He could feel razorblades pushing out behind his eyes and needles growing in his gums – and then the clammy touch of a mind burrowing into his, he remembered the wrists of Rabastan Lestrange and then the astronomy tower and Harry laughing and a sloppy kiss and-
Ginny had been such a big part of what got him through the war, the one good thing he knew he had waiting for him if he managed to survive, and then it had been so undramatic for them to drift apart. They had gotten back together after the battle, and it just hadn't been the same as before the war. They had both been more distant, more careful, and he wasn't sure if it was because of what they had been through or if it was because he had left her behind. He’d never figured out how to ask her about it. They hadn't fought or anything, except for the row about Snape, but that had been months before they’d ended it. They hadn't fought, they just hadn't talked much, either. And then when Summer had ended, she’d gone back to school, and things had just… faded out. They had broken up officially when they’d both come to the Burrow for Christmas, and they had managed to keep it on the down low and out of the papers until a couple of weeks ago, when the thing with Heather had happened.
He knew they had only come the first time because Potter had asked them to, and he hadn’t even told them that Draco and Pansy would be there. He wasn’t sure why they had come back. Potter still looked tense, almost apologetic, so clearly he felt responsible for them being there, but they did not have the air of people who had been talked into something they didn’t want to do. Three of them had led an army, a freedom movement and a refugee camp within the school last year, which had not been easy. He knew that because he had been fighting them. They didn’t just do Potter’s bidding anymore, if they ever had, and if they were here it was of their own volition. So it was possible that the Gryffindor heroes had decided, that this was a worthy cause.
The hard part of legilimency was getting into someone’s head and staying there long enough to find what you were looking for before their mind pushed you out. This mind wasn’t trying to push him out, and so instead of a slow crawl dragging through memories that clung like spider webs, the images rushed by like streaming water, too fast and too chaotically for him to make out anything but glimpses in the rush, too fast for him to tell them from each other, and he strained to hold on to that sensation of his own body far away, trying to stay tethered even as he felt himself slipping away between glimpses of someone else’s past.
Harry’s grip tightens around the handle and he jerks the door open. He leaves, closing the door carefully behind him. Draco listens to his footsteps receding down the stairs. He drops the watch on the floor, because fuck precious heirlooms. He curls over his knees, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes. Fuck Potter. He wants to die and he wants to kill him and he curses him under his breath until his throat is too tight for any words to make their way out.
Of course the only Ravenclaw in on the mission ought to have been part of their endless library search, but she had kept her distance. He had thought that their group was only divided into heroes and Slytherins, but that might be wrong. Maybe he had noticed that Ginny Weasley, Lovegood and Longbottom had become a trio in their own right last year, the obvious challengers of the Carrows, but he supposed he had only thought of them as stand-ins for Granger, Potter and Ronald, had never considered them to be anything in their own right. Yet here they were, still a trio, more reliant on each other than on Potter, close in a way that the golden trio wasn’t anymore. And he hadn’t noticed because even though Potter’s friends had seemed unlikely choices for heroic companions, those three were even less likely heroes. It wasn’t just Draco who had been underestimating them, overlooking them, dismissing them: Potter, Granger and Weasley had been doing the same thing.
And Draco opens his mouth to object, to clarify, because clearly Potter didn’t understand what he was asking. His face is inches away from Draco’s, and he looks angry and tired and scared, all of them at once, a complicated expression Draco might not have been able to read if he didn’t know the feeling so well.
“It’s not my fault you’re practically an elf,” said Draco, ignoring Harry’s attempts to free himself. “Besides, I feel absolutely awful. Someone had the brilliant idea that we should have a little end of the year party in Slytherin last night, I’ve hardly slept at all.”
“They aren’t like anything we’ve covered in class,” she said. “But I think they might be variations of protection-runes. And this one,“ she tapped
Blaise watched him. There was something hesitant about his figure. Draco would have asked him to go away, except he wasn’t sure he wanted him to. He didn’t want to be alone.
“I might have,” said Blaise slowly. “But I think we should make last year an exception, don’t you? I mean,
Malfoy looked quickly up at him, a strangely open expression on his face, and a thought flashed through Harry's mind, that this was what Malfoy looked like when he didn't think people were watching - when he didn't have time to put on a smirk or a sneer. He looked different.
From the day Harry arrives at the Burrow, Mrs Weasley is already fussing over the wedding and eventually everyone else gets caught up in the preparations too. Despite the oppressive darkness hanging over all of them, it really does promise to be a happy time, two small, golden weeks squeezed in between all the awfulness, and Harry is honestly looking forward to it.
He had spent a lot of time thinking about the night in the secret room. Draco had drifted off as soon as Harry stopped talking, but Harry hadn’t been able to fall asleep. He had lain there in the darkness with his arm around him and listened to him breathing. It was easy to forget how warm people were until you were really close to someone else and then you were reminded what a miracle a living body is of muscles and veins and breath, little twitches and sounds.
Harry made a strangled noise. Pansy’s eyes flashed in his direction, but only for a second. Then they were back on Draco, wide and confused, waiting for him to
“Look, can everyone just calm down for a second? I said this was a D.A. meeting and it is, so I need you all to listen to me for just three seconds before you rip each other’s heads off!”
Granger looked at him for a moment and he didn’t have time to figure out what that expression meant before she composed herself and nodded.
“You think you changed something, don’t you?” he continued, knowing he was being an idiot, but he had been wanting to shout at someone for months.
He had noticed Theodore Nott at the station earlier and it looked like he had arrived without his parents, just as Draco had. That had been somewhat comforting. He thought he had spotted the Greengrass sisters and Blaise Zabini, but they must have disappeared into the train by now.
He didn’t need to tell them that – they all knew two innocent people who had been sent to Azkaban too hastily. Hagrid had only been there for a short while. Sirius had been there for twelve years, and even though he had still been a person when he came back, the more Harry thought about it the less certain he was that it hadn’t destroyed him.
“I do. You said the auror used a key to open this last time you were here, yes? George said these could open anything locked with a key.”
It was a reciprocal game of guessing the truth, Harry thought. Because he was lying too. He made jokes, he had invited Malfoy to go flying, defended him in front of the others and joined him in his drinking. He didn’t know if any of that was true either, or if he was just playing along.
Sound didn’t travel far in Azkaban. If the acoustics had been normal, the tower would have been filled with noise from the prisoners, who were crying, whining or babbling incomprehensibly. In one cell, someone was screaming their head off, stopping for breath and then screaming again. He didn’t look. As soon as they had passed a few cells further down, they couldn’t hear it anymore. It might be the ancient magic that swallowed the sound. Or perhaps it was the dementors.
He laughed nervously. It felt ridiculous saying it aloud. He shouldn’t have told her. But Luna didn’t laugh. She watched him with a puzzled expression and a glassy look in her eyes.
It happens a lot after that. Always the same way, Draco discretely slipping Harry a note or whispering to him a time and a place for them to meet and Harry crumpling the paper in his pocket or pretending not to hear the whisper. He promises himself he won’t go, but then he watches the clock anxiously as the time draws closer and at the last minute he goes anyway. He hates himself for going, maybe that’s why he’s so rough. He never really knows if he’s going to beat him up or kiss him when it starts. Then at some point Draco will get on his knees and push Harry’s shirt up, open his trousers for him, and Harry likes that part way too much. Sometimes he gently kisses the skin on Harry’s stomach and Harry tells him to just get fucking on with it, and he usually does.
He grinned and turned away to walk down the hallway. Draco stayed by the suits of armour and watched until he turned a corner and disappeared. Then he headed back to Slytherin.
Draco crouched in front of the shrivelled man and pushed Harry from his mind. He could feel every hair on his arms standing up, his heart picking up speed at the proximity, as he kept half an eye on the spidery fingers, every second expecting them to jerk forwards and wrap themselves around his neck. He stared into the inky wells of the ancient wizard’s eyes and saw his own reflection mirrored in each of them. He levelled his wand at him.
Tracey went home after a couple of hours. Pansy halfway migrated to the neighbouring table to flirt with a semi-handsome guy in tacky robes, leaving Draco to converse with Greg, who was far past the point where he could string together a coherent sentence, and Daphne and Blaise, who were fawning over each other like they were 17 again. The place had only gotten more crowded as the night went on. Draco emptied his whisky and got up, which, despite her recently changed priorities in terms of preferred company, was apparently enough to catch Pansy's attention.
“But not to you, right? I know I’ve done some fucked up things, and I never expected you to forgive me, but then there you were, telling me you didn’t blame me for Dumbledore’s death, and yesterday you were practically making out with my Dark Mark, and for a second I thought… For a second I forgot that you sent my father to Azkaban and that you tried to murder me, and I thought that maybe you cared. But then you fucking left anyway.” Draco looks away. His hands are curled tightly into fists and Harry watches his chest rise and fall rapidly, watches him swallow hard.
