“So I just wanted to say that yes, I really like you. But I hate the way that you smell so good and I never thought I’d be admitting this but here we are. If you don’t like me back, that’s fine.” Harry let out a breath he didn’t realise he was holding.
Even he had to admit that they looked like he bought them like that, they definitely didn’t look like Draco had just fucking ripped them. Pansy had not even asked him but told him that he wasn’t getting rid of them, he “reluctantly” agreed. Deep inside he had admitted to himself that he really liked them and was thrilled that Pansy liked them too, now he just needed somewhere to wear them too.
Immediately after Potter had left, Draco had desperately tried to breathe properly again. Only just noticing how uneven and shaky his breathing was, his lungs ached for him to take a proper inhale. His heart still hammered away in his chest as he urged for it to calm down, he definitely did not want to have a heart attack before he got the golden opportunity to go and meet with Harry.
“Cockslut.” Harry muttered out the words but from the glowing blush on Malfoy’s cheeks - which seemed to have taken a permanent residency there - he knew he’d been heard.
As much as he didn’t want to answer, he also knew that he needed some water. He had to inch a little to the left in order to reach it as Harry, once again, removed Draco’s cloak and placed his wand back into his jacket.
He looked up at the clock that hung on his wall, 9:00pm. His eyes widened when he remembered that he was meeting Potter, an hour had already passed. For a minute, he couldn’t think of how long he had been given. He ran a hand through his snow kissed hair and stared at the wall, hoping to find the answer.
Draco’s incredibly pale complexion did nothing to save him from the dusting of red covering his cheek, goddamn Snape.
“Please.” Draco whispered hoarsely, even he could recognise how fucked his voice was already - he hadn’t even done anything. All he’d done was be in close vicinity to Potter, to his oh so enticing actions and dirty mouth.
“But. You must bring him back, he can’t be missing out on anymore lessons now, can he?” Ron gave the other a slight worried look, knowing Harry would not wanna come back into the classroom after this. Nobody had laughed though, but if anybody could persuade him it was Hermione.
“Oh yeah. Never thought it’d take kissing my best friend to fully realise.” Ron added, sharing in the chuckling.
Draco couldn’t take his eyes away, he knew if he wanted to keep the boner in his pants from becoming obvious that he should steer clear of Potter’s wanting and lust filled eyes but it was a near impossible task.
A love potion, one that was to reveal exactly who Potter had feelings for. Obviously, they couldn’t conjure one up in a couple hours. They had to wait at least 3 days, to both gather the ingredients needed and to do so without getting caught.
“Don’t speak with your mouth open! It’s gross.” Their sister grimaced as she scolded him, Fred cackled - also with a mouth full.
They sat like that for 5 more minutes before the court announced that Lucius was being brought out for his trial very soon. Draco had taken a deep breath like Harry had instructed him to do and squeezed his hand, he felt the anxiety ebb away slightly. He still felt the nerves rushing through his veins but nowhere near as bad and unmanageable as before.
Draco’s eyes had widened as he saw himself, the jeans had ripped. But not in the places he had expected them too, he just thought they’d ripped normally and that he looked like a prat.
“I-I-“ Draco couldn’t even fucking speak, he shook his head in bafflement and to show his friends that he was just as mind-fucked by it.
“I rarely ever use this room, the dorms are actually just outside. I prefer to sleep out there as I always have, this room is a giant mistake.”
After the laces were tied, he walked over to the levitating mirror in the corner of his room. He looked up and down his body, trying to decide if he looked good enough. It didn’t really matter what he thought anyway, he was just curious at how Potter was gonna receive him. The reminder of him had the dirty thoughts racing back to try and swarm inside his yet, he didn’t want them - not yet!
Draco’s gaze drifted back down, eyes widening when he saw Harry’s spit slicked cock. He could not believe that, that whole thing had fit inside of his mouth - let alone his throat. It didn’t surprise him how much - euphoric - pain his throat and mouth were in. He had taken in almost the entire length and girth, of a cock that he had earlier related to one of a horse. Dear Merlin.
“Bet you didn’t think Ron would be the one telling you how good of a kisser Harry was, did you.” Ginny chuckled, enjoying how the tips of Ron’s ears were now red too.
The reaction from Draco had him squeezing the flesh, the whimpers fleeing from the other’s mouth making his cock throb in his jeans.
According to Hermione, Ron and Ginny, they thought that it was very possible. Of course, Harry did everything he could not to believe them. Again, not wanting to fill his body up with that wonderful feeling of hope that was just gonna be false in the end.
He couldn’t help but beg, it slipped out of his mouth before his brain could even register it. He had also just embarrassed himself for the hundredth time just for Harry’s pleasure and it made his own cock throb in his jeans - he hadn’t even noticed himself getting hard.
“Anyway, back to the story?” Hermione yawned as she caught everyone’s attention, purposely ignoring the glare that Harry sent her.
The realisation couldn’t be hidden from Draco’s face as he forced his gaze, from where it had fallen to the floor, back to Potter. He hoped that the message of ‘please say this is the truth’ and ‘please don’t let this be a lie’ was understood by Harry.
“I can make it slightly opaque.” Harry’s words were a little like suggestion and a little like a statement at what he was about to do, he clicked his fingers again and the enchantment was ever so slightly visible from where it covered the ceiling. “That good?”
“Before I leave, I want to know something.” He leaned in closer to his ear, once again, licking the shell of it as he revelled from the way the boy shivered.
With this hands shaking, he brought his eyes up to meet Potter’s. And holy fucking shit, he now knew what he was so hesitant to look into his eyes. Draco’s cheeks burned with shame from how his prick was aching with a need to release, throbbing as their gazes locked. The pure dominance seeping from his pores doing nothing more but adding to the frustrating pleasure.
Draco prayed that his eyes didn’t show the lust that he was engulfed by, he did not need his friends seeing that. As their gazes collided, he felt his heart stutter violently in his chest. Almost as if it had stopped for a moment before viciously remembering its job and started again, the eyes of his friends were full of curiosity.
Potter whispered the words throatily into Draco’s ear, he revelled in the little noises fleeing from the other.
The whole room was so silent that if a pin were to drop, it would make everybody jump. Harry felt the heat rush to his face, he was positive that the rest of the class could see it too. His throat had gone dry, unable to get any words of defence out.
“How nice of you to join us again, Potter.” Harry sat down, full of nerves. He could once again feel the eyes of everyone on him, what he didn’t realise was that Draco also had eyes on him.
They left them there for a moment before he had warmed their hands up, they grinned with an underlying caring expression mixed in with the mischief that always seemed to reside on their faces as they brought their hands back down. Harry was thankful as he watched the twins now crack their fingers, he took a moment before he spoke again - teeth grinding slightly from the powerful feelings running through him. He then decided that he should probably answer their question, the nice coolness on his head had distracted him momentarily - though he could still feel powerful magic thrumming through his body.
Draco felt his pulse point pumping harshly in his neck, his body feeling high after the rush of heat that he got from Potter.
Harry pulled back a little, the tip of his cock now directly at the back of his throat. Draco moaned whorishly as he attempted to nod his head, which only succeeded in Potter’s cock slipping further down his throat.
Draco wanted to whimper from not only the actions of the other but at how when Potter had seen his hard on, he had blushed and sputtered like a fool; but when the roles were reversed, Potter just looked smug, teasing and oh so powerful.
Potter rolled his eyes menacingly, shaking his head and sending Draco a dangerous grin as he stepped closer - still not close enough to touch.
“We’ve never seen you like that before, it was so entrancing to watch.” Their laughing settled down as Pansy explained, mouth open a little to show her astonishment.
“4 minutes? It felt like bloody hours. Not like it was a bad thing though and I’m definitely not complaining.” A smirk that he did not consent to, played on his lips in a teasing manner. He gained eye contact with his friends before swiftly breaking it and rubbing his temples, this fucking potion.
The touch was subtle enough that he could get away with the ‘conceal attempt’ excuse, when really - he just craved a hand on his arousal. The pleasure shot throughout his body like shocks of electricity.
Draco wanted to slam his head against the wall. Before today he had never had a problem with stuttering but since his encounter with Potter earlier, it seemed it was all he could do around him.
All he wanted to do was slam Malfoy up against the wall and fuck his brains out. And it was taking everything inside of him not to do it, he felt his hands shaking as they rested by his sides from the pure effort he was using into not giving in to his horny desires.
And as if Draco couldn’t get any more obvious, he felt his cheeks increase in temperature. He had no idea how red and hot his face was going to get at this point, that all depended on whatever Potter was planning on doing to him.
The Slytherin groaned at the forceful pull as he shoved his head down just a little further. He jerked his hand at the base of Potter’s cock, pleasuring that which could not fit in his mouth - not yet anyway.
“You didn’t complete your evaluation in potions class, I want it done and given to me by tomorrow.” His low drawl was easily recognisable now as his brain started to slowly work again, he had potions again tomorrow so he assumed he would hand it in then.
“There will be questions soon, though.” Blaise’s words made him cringe, he knew it was coming eventually. - he just didn’t want to admit it.
“What do y-you want from m-me?” Draco knew the answer, he just wanted to prove - to not only Harry but himself - that he could speak.
“With our bets, we do rock paper scissors. Whoever wins gets to flip the coin first, whichever it lands on then belongs to that person. We flip the coin again and whichever it lands on, that person gets to choose. So I got heads and Fred got tails, when the coin was flipped it landed on heads. Due to our rules, I picked my answer first and Fred got the one that was left. I said yes, Harry was a good kisser and Fred got stuck with no. So, now I have 5 galleons.”
Ron smacked Harry’s arm after noticing how damn zoned out he looked, the other didn’t even flinch. Only sent a wink Draco’s way before reluctantly turning back to his friends, trying to hide his grin to avoid any questions.
“So, what the fuck just happened?” Goyle’s eyes were wide, unable to comprehend what had just happened.
They had immediately rushed back to the Slytherin dorms to tell Draco, where they had quickly formed an idea. This was obviously something private for their enemy, something that made him vulnerable. They needed anything to gain power over him.
Draco hoped that Potter couldn’t feel how violently his heart was beating against his rib cage, so full of heated arousal as his body struggled to cope with it. He was broken out of his thoughts by Harry’s temping voice.
“We had a stupid feud, all of us. Can we just, move forward?” Instantly, they nodded. Snape bit back a smile too, not wanting them to think he was too nice.
“I would like to say thank you as well. Every mother craves to do anything to look after their child and it’s so scary when you can’t do that, but you took the lead and helped today. Not only did you help my son, you taught me what to do if it ever happens again. So, thank you. Your parents had a wonderful son.”
It didn’t take him too long, as soon as he was finished he swat his feather down and rolled up the scrolls. He stood up on his numb legs and almost fell, he managed to grab on to his desk in time. He placed his work on the desk and moaned softly in relief that it was done, the cramp in his hand pulsed slightly as he stretched it out and hoped it would go away.
Two rips now showed directly under the curve of Draco’s arsecheeks, both the underneath of the pudgy flesh showing as his upper thigh was also completely exposed. His cheeks in no way were on show, but the curve of them below certainly was, again, along with the upper of his thigh.
When Harry had the heart to look up, he saw Pansy Parkinson sitting on his table. God, he didn’t think he could use his voice right now. All she did was smile, warmly at him? Before winking towards Hermione, which made the girl blush slightly, as she made her way back to her seat. She was instantly sent a questioning look from Harry.
Draco’s entire frame shook, gasping slightly as he felt Potter nudge past him. His heart completely stopped beating as he felt that cock, the same one he was drooling over earlier, rub against his shoulder. It was almost boiling on his skin, scolding him from the heat, even through his clothes. And merlin the size, he was doing all that he could to not drop to his knees immediately. What had this man done to him.
“Maybe I forgot, maybe all I remember is that you said to meet you here.” He had done everything in his power to make his voice sound stable but even to him, he could tell he was breaking at the seams.
“I’ll see you later.” Harry picked up his cloak and swung over it over his shoulder, not even bothering to hear his friends’ responses as he winked at them and turned. Walking confidently out of the Great Hall, the grin that shook Draco to his core in the best way still played on his lips.
Harry wanted to hear the other speak, wanted to hear how fucked his voice was - how fucked his own cock had made it.
“I can never go into that class ever again. Fuck that, I can never look at Malfoy again.” Finally lifting his head, his heart still hammering. His self loathing was cut short, however, when he heard his friend sniffing him.
He had a sly thought that Potter had not told him he wasn’t allowed to touch inside of himself, he quickly realised that he probably included that. Draco did not want to risk anything so if he had to hold off for longer just so Potter could be the one to touch him and be inside of him, then that’s what he was going to do.
“Think that has anything to do with Malfoy?” His name coming from Neville’s mouth had caught him off guard as he covered up his reaction with a cough, now listening intently.
“I think we both know that doesn’t change anything though. Because you wanna know what isn’t controllable?”
Draco let no other words spill from his blubbering mouth, he wouldn’t allow himself to talk himself into not cumming. His body ached for it after having not cum earlier in the day, he did not want to have to wait any longer.
“Oh yeah! That’s how he made sure of his sexuality.” Ginny rolled her eyes at how her brothers’ interest peaked up at the conversation, she was about to fill them in before Hermione decided to relieve her of the responsibility.
Hermione was doing her best to not let her smirk show, she subtly covered her mouth with her hand as if pretending to itch her nose.
Draco couldn’t help the sinful thoughts that were swarming inside his head, whirling around like a tornado of horny had struck - this was not the time for shitty similes.
He let his gaze shift obviously over to the Slytherin’s, they all had the look of ‘oh fuck’ on their faces as their hope of Harry forgetting that they were the ones who slipped him the potion got thrown viscously out the window.
Now here they were. After that disaster, Pansy had persuaded them to try forget about it and rather go to the Great Hall to study. They had all, albeit reluctantly, agreed.
“Now, how about we go and get that piece of shit of a husband and father, thrown into Azkaban; right where he belongs.” Harry kind of regretted the words as soon as they came out, he didn’t know their feelings about it and didn’t to make them feel worse.
“I’m not done with you just yet, we’ll talk about this again but not today. Now I’d like to go to Pansy for a minute.” For a moment she thought she might’ve been in trouble but after seeing Snape’s eyes, she knew she was fine.
All 5 of them couldn’t but softly smile at his words, it was rare that Snape opened up or even just complimented them. Spoke nicely, it was very reassuring and just nice.
Silence, even Snape’s angry stare had faltered. Harry didn’t understand why there was so much silence, he hadn’t said anything bad or offensive. When he caught Hermione’s stare he knew something was wrong, Draco’s eyes were also cemented to him.
With one last smile and a nod to both of them, he began his walk back to his seat - preparing to testify. He had chosen to go first, a way of making sure that neither Draco or his mother had too. He wanted them to watch him so they could maybe feel a little better, he knew that there was logic in there somewhere but he was to focused on how he should say his words during the trial to get stuck on it.
“Anyway, I wanted to prove that they worked. I was also curious of how they’d affect a person in real life rather than just reading about the effects on a piece of paper. After some secret ingredient searching we finally made the potions. Ron had the love potion and Harry, reluctantly, the lust potion.”
Draco Malfoy was going to have Harry Potter’s ludicrously large cock, in his mouth. To his own ears it sounded absurd, he would’ve never thought he’d be in this position.
thank you so much for reading! any feedback is welcome, i'm interested in what anybody has to say or any way to improve my creative writing :3 i hope you have a good day! :)
“How can being horny hurt your head? And please be clear next time, you gave us all a bloody heart attack!” Neville raised a hand to his heart to annunciate his words as he tried to control his breathing, attempting to also get the beat of his heart back down to a normal speed.
Draco’s face heated up in seconds, not only his face but the whole of his body heating up so much that he felt like she should be burning from fire. Being this close to his rival was like adding fuel to a flame, the heat oozing off the other and adding to his own heat - reigniting the flame deep inside his groin as he felt his cock become a lot harder than half hard.
“This story’s going on for too long.” Harry mumbled as he rested his head on the table, the effects of the potion hitting him all over again. His body was way too hot and the fact that he wasn’t getting off right now was pissing him off, that was his excuse for his sour attitude - he thought - as he lifted his head.
“What are you talking about?” He had asked, bewildered. His friend had just taken his hand and pulled him, he had no idea where they were going. He didn’t even bother asking either, Pansy just wouldn’t reply.
He may be under a lust potion but Draco came to the conclusion that he wasn’t looking at anybody else like that, only him. Maybe he was just making excuses, hoping that the other wanted him like Draco did.
He was terrified to meet his gaze again, the only sound was their breathing and the shoes of people outside hitting the ground. It felt a lot longer than it was as he looked up, once again making eye contact. His worries were slowly starting to melt away, just from the gaze coming from Draco.
“See, what I think you wanted, Draco. Was exactly this. For me to grab you like this, take what’s mine.”
“N-Not a lot.” Potter was slowly getting closer and closer, covering the blonde’s body like a sheet. It was turning Draco’s brain into mush, how was he going to get through this night.
“What? Is everything ripped?” Draco had asked worriedly, his first pair of muggle jeans and he’d broken the damn things.
He hadn’t meant to say it loud, his intention was for only Ron to hear. That didn’t happen, goddamn for him not realising how loud his voice was. He should know how to whisper after all this time.
The blonde pulled his hand off the wall, his grip on the books tightening ever so slightly. He turned around expeditiously, feeling his heart hammer violently as he recognised Snape. Honestly, he should’ve known from the drawl in his words. How did Snape appear behind him so soundlessly, it was as if he appeared out of nowhere.
The focus he had on his thoughts slipping away as he watched the expression on the other’s face, it was ever so teasing as Harry continued to grin; turning his head to stare at Draco. Instead of looking away like he did before, he kept his eyes trained on the blonde - now with that gaze on him, he struggled to control the lust clouding all of his senses. The words that left Potter’s mouth next had him shivering from how much he craved the other.
His gaze quickly shifted back to the boy below him, he was still shaking from the intensity of everything Harry emitted. The combat boot that had been pressed into Draco’s thighs were now gone as Potter moved his right foot over his front and stood, quickly placing them on to the ground. The blonde hadn’t moved a muscle, his quivering hands still covering the hardness of his cock.
And Draco, well, all he could do was gulp. Potter had just done wandless magic. Wandless magic. It turned him on way more than it should’ve, it was shameful how much it turned him on. He realised that watching Potter’s show of power was incredibly arousing to him, dear merlin.
His friends could only gape up at him, mouths wide open. They had no idea if Harry had even realised what he had just said, out loud. To be honest though, the twins had asked for it and they were fucking enjoying the answer they got.
Draco jumped slightly, whipping his gaze up to meet Harry’s. He took a shaky breath in at how intensely Mark was looking at him, now he didn’t trust his voice even more.
Draco, however, would never admit to the slight chill that wracked his body when Potter’s dark eyes had connected with his own grey ones. He barely even registered the muttered agreement around him at his comment.
After turning his body to leave his seat, he turned back around to face the Slytherin table. That same cruel smirk still slapped onto his features, he looked dangerous. And Draco hated the way it made his prick twitch in his pants, close to becoming a full boner as blood rushed to the appendage.
The slight nauseous feeling that apparating caused, passed rather quickly. Draco took a guess that was of Harry’s doing, always such a gentleman. He hadn’t even realised that he was no longer touching the other and that his eyes were scrunched shut, they quickly opened when he heard that familiar drawl he was growing to really enjoy listening too.
Draco started to calm down, his head becoming less and less dizzy as the urge to faint passed. He knew where he was and felt secure, safe and on the ground. His thoughts had slowed down tremendously, now at a normal pace. He still allowed himself to copy how Harry was breathing though, to make sure it wasn’t going to happen again.
As his gaze differed, he let out a heavy breath. Now looking at those curvy hips of his that he wanted to grip tightly between his fingers, leaving bruises of his own fingertips. The boy was driving him crazy.
Draco would’ve never though that Harry Potter, the Harry Potter, would have such a fucking dirty mouth on him - he could easily make the devil blush. Being dirty talked to by Harry was now one of his favourite things. Plus, the derogatory terms only made his prick harder.
“Hey, just look at me. We either stay out here or have our entrails hanged on the outside of Hogwarts for not coming back quick enough!”
He noticed that his eyes had slipped from Harry’s own, even his subconscious couldn’t handle staring back into those tempting eyes. After realising, they shot back up. He really wish he hadn’t.
Draco wanted to sob at not only the words, but as the fingers on his bare arse got infinitely tighter. He honestly didn’t think his hold could get any tighter.
30 minutes, he’d taken 30 minutes. Longer than usual but in no way the longest one he’s ever taken, he always manages to get lost in his thoughts when he showers. This time, however, they were filthy and tickled his body in delicious increments of pleasure.
“I think I’ve been slipped a lust potion.” Even Harry knew that his words sounded way too nonchalant then what they probably should’ve.
Harry muttered a wandless lubrication spell, his fingers now evenly coated in the slick substance. He couldn’t help but let himself smirk at the other’s whine, he knew it was because of the wandless magic he had just done.
“Because if you don’t then that punishment you’re getting will feel like a dream compared to what I’ll put you through. Also, you can kiss the thought of you cumming goodbye. You think I don’t have a cock ring to physically stop you.”
He squeezed his thighs together in an attempt to stop his already half hard cock from rising any further - he never stood a chance from the way the other’s eyes were observing every detail of his body.
His eyes then wandered to his friends, who also had wide eyes. Some of amazement and some of shock, just like Draco’s friends.
Those thoughts were definitely new too, he never once cared about if anyone would be pleased with him - bar his father. But even now, he stopped caring a long while ago. Ever since Lucius was locked up in Azkaban, he had left his craving to please people who didn’t deserve it in the past.
Draco had instantly scowled, he wasn’t adorable. The expression had lasted about 5 seconds, as soon as their gazes collided his face fell - leaving no more than a slight pout on his lips.
“Ow! You bastard.” Harry rubbed his cheek, the pain already ebbing away quickly under his fingers. He looked up to see Hermione hissing in pain from the pure velocity that her hand had collided with his face at, he couldn’t help but thank karma. The girl always did have a mean slap and punch. But he also understood why she had to do it and was grateful, as much as you can be for getting slapped anyway.
Draco pulled them from his wardrobe and tossed them on the bed, he hung his discarded uniform up as it wasn’t dirty at all. Now he just had to find a shirt, this is where he could definitely use Pansy’s help.
“Okay, okay! Sorry!” He could tell by the tone of her voice that she wasn’t sorry at all, he understood though. If he wasn’t using every muscle in his body to not get hard, he might’ve smiled - laughed even.
Draco’s eyes trailed down immediately, gulping as he watched Harry move his hand up and down his hard cock. The raven haired man sniggered at how entranced the blonde had become, just from such a simple touch.
“He’s so much sassier when he’s horny, I love it.” Ginny spoke, the grin easily heard through her tone - this caused Hermione to giggle.
Harry allowed himself to let go as he nipped at the milky skin, gradually increasing in harshness. He bit down, earning another moan that went straight to his crotch - that was gonna leave a mark.
“I-I’m not adorable.” To enunciate his words he had crossed his arms as he sent a weak attempt at a scowl towards Potter, and from the mischievous glint in the other’s eye, he knew he would regret it.
It was surprising how the rest of the hall hadn’t payed much attention, way too busy with their own shit to care about what Harry Potter was doing to Draco Malfoy. All of his friends and Potter’s friends, however, were completely silent. Engaged in what in the ever loving fuck was gonna happen next, the thought scared him. He felt his cock throb harder than that and jesus fuck, where had this apparent fear kink come from. He scolded himself in his mind, getting distracted momentarily.
“Harry!” Hermione both yelled at his words and actions whilst the other half of her was just incredibly amused at the same time.
Draco downed at least half of it, the freezing liquid refreshing against his incredibly sore throat. He knew that his voice would still be fucked, water couldn’t fix that, but at least now he was hydrated and eased the slight pain - he still liked the pain as it was a constant reminder of what he’d just had in his mouth.
After some quietness as Hermione tried to finish off her studying quickly, and more prying from the twins who were extremely curious about who Harry had a crush on. Hermione, Ron and Ginny only smirked at them which aided in their annoyance.
At his answer, Potter let out another tantalising chuckle that made him weak all over. He flinched at how harsh it sounded, he was starting to become addicted to the darkness that Harry carried.
Potter then yanked his hair harshly as he thrusted brutally into the other’s throat, he growled when Draco’s eyes rolled back into his head as a loud but muffled moan vibrated around him. Tears now pouring down that pretty face, it made Harry hot all over.
The waves of arousal that rocketed through his body, to his hard cock and back again, was the only source of pleasure he was receiving. Apparently that didn’t matter much, considering how insanely good he was feeling already.
The last word the came out of the Gryffindor’s mouth sounded seething, it made the blonde shiver. Harry stepped closer, his presence purposefully looming over Draco’s own.
Draco knew that he wouldn’t dare though, he may think it but he knew for a fact that he would never go through with it. For the reason that he didn’t want to disobey Harry, he wanted to show him that he could be good for him. Be his good boy.
He could fucking feel Potter’s eyes burning holes through him as his gaze dropped further to his shoulders, not taking much time before he was at his chest. The transition fluid as his gaze switched down to his lower stomach, Draco couldn’t breathe properly.
Their gazes collided and Draco already felt himself losing the battle, he’d been in the Gryffindor’s presence for not even 2 minutes and he already felt himself starting to crumble.
Potter had already slipped down the back of his throat, causing more tears to glaze over his smitten eyes; none of which had fallen yet.
Harry had taken the hand, that wrapped around his base, off. Draco wiped the spit that had trailed down his chin. He returned his hand to Potter’s other thigh, feeling a lot more stable now he was gripping both. He felt ready for more, he regained eye contact in hopes that he would be understood - he was.
“Did he say what I think he said?” Crabbe whispered to his friends, curious to know whether his ears had deceived him.
“I will, now finish it.” The way Potter spoke told Draco that he should not disobey him, the sensation of the fingers squeezing his cheeks becoming tighter telling him that he needed to answer.
“-Parkinson and Malfoy, please stay behind.” Harry gulped. The remaining class stared at them all, a fog like whisper hitting the rest like waves. Unable to do anything but discuss what the fuck had just happened.
It took him a minute to realise that he still had some heat in his groin, what was he thinking about before?
“Now can you two shut up so you can actually listen to what Hermione’s about to say, she’s not even got to the good parts yet.”
Was he, Draco Malfoy, really getting so lucky that Harry Potter had just admitted his own feelings for him. Was-Was he the crush his friends were talking about all along??
“Of course.” Hermione ignored the absolute death stare Harry was giving her, instead she focused on pushing a couple stray hairs behind her ear. Fred and George twitched their eyebrows in interest and curiosity for what they were about to hear, from the way Harry was groaning in annoyance; it must be good.
“Harry, nobody laughed or made fun. They were just, shocked. It’s not everyday that rivals accidentally admit their love for each other.” Harry couldn’t help but match his friends chuckle.
“I know, sweetheart. You want it so bad, don’t you. I don’t hear you begging for it though.” His words and condescending tone made the boy bite his lip in an attempt to stop any more embarrassing noises from coming out, Harry hated that.
He was stuck between not being able to breathe at all and then hyperventilating, his fingers pressing harshly into the suit that the other was wearing. Harry had then moved his right hand off of his shoulder, moving it down slowly to grip his left hand. Draco had squeezed Potter’s hands tightly, through the haziness of his brain, he felt himself being pulled back down to earth from the contact. Narcissa had a hand placed on his back as Harry’s hand gently massaged his shoulder and rubbed his thumb over the back of his hand, Draco was so grateful for it.
Against his consent, Harry’s hips thrusted forward - shoving his cock deep into Malfoy’s throat. He was about to pull back to apologise when he felt the vibrations of a long, drawn out moan come from the other.
Harry’s cock throbbed at the image. He knew for a fact that the pleasure he was feeling was definitely happening in real life, he was rock fucking hard. But he couldn’t do anything about it, that’s just what lust potions do.
Draco and his friends’ eyes widened at that, he’d had to go through a whole day of school whilst dealing with a lust potion. They didn’t know whether to laugh at him or respect him.
Harry brought his hands down to Draco’s thighs, his grip tight as he rapidly moved up to grab the globes of the Slytherin’s cheeks and hold them in a bruising grip.
Harry’s face then showed his realisation of what he had just said, this damn potion, and even though he had said it aloud and risked others hearing it - a sultry smirk appeared on his face. Ever so enticing, to Draco it was anyway.
The words the came out of the Gryffindor’s mouth next had Draco’s body threatening to orgasm as he clenched his thighs tightly, not being missed by the other’s watching eyes - nothing ever did.
sorry for the shorter chapter, i didn't want to post to big of a chunk but i will be updating this again soon as i've already got a big portion already written (before i had my motivation stolen lmao) but i'll hopefully be getting some more written soon. thank you for reading :)
“He started moaning about wanting to kiss somebody so I offered up Ron for a joke, took me a minute to realise Ron didn’t actually care. He said something about wanting to make sure that he was actually into boys, so he was fine with kissing him. I was like, woah.”
The blonde boy was honestly in shock himself, Potter had a crush on him? He tried his best to keep the blush off his cheeks. If he had to say so himself, he had done an extraordinarily good job at hiding his own crush. Rather than showing the affection he wanted, he made snide remarks and gave rotten stares. Having Potter act the same way back stopped any signs of feelings bubbling over, that worked in the beginning anyway. Then Draco found himself straight back in his predicament, his crush on the one and only Harry Potter.
Draco’s throat felt tight as Potter pulled away, engaging in eye contact straight away and trembling under the authoritative gaze. The pernicious grin his lips had been stretched into made the boner in his pants painful, the reason that even though the expression made it look as if he wanted to hurt him - he knew that Harry only wanted to hurt him in ways that caused pleasure. Which made the maliciousness of it all that more arousing.
He inched the constricting fabric up his thighs, hitting a full on road block once it reached his ass.
Harry rubbed his eyes before shoving a hand through his hair, doing everything he could to just not look at his enemy. Well, former enemy? He had no fucking idea. It was difficult though, Malfoy was rather good looking.
“Go on then, don’t wanna be late.” She must’ve fucking heard, he did not wanna take time thinking about it though.
Draco heard himself whine again, even though he had attempted to do it quietly, he knew for a fact that Harry would have heard it. He couldn’t see his reaction though, after his absolute failure of speaking - his gaze had shot down to focus on the floor.
Potter groaned lowly, sending his own vibrations down through Draco and making his body twitched. Even now, the other sounded authoritative and controlled.
The Great Hall wasn’t too full but in no way sparse, people only taking their time to study in the space - the room buzzed with quiet conversation.
He was sitting oh so perfectly in the v of them, he gulped - closing his eyes so tight that his vision became a whirlpool of swirls and made up patterns as he braced himself for what he was about to see and hopefully not beg to get fucked.
The assertiveness in Potter’s voice made Draco whine quietly, he really did not wanna answer the question.
“Draco.” Oh fuck, Potter sounded… He couldn’t make it out, that scared him all the more worse. His tone was so collected yet lined with malicious intent and it was driving the blonde crazy, his hands had started to cramp by how tightly he had them balled in his lap.
“Honestly, can you believe her.” Ron looked over to Harry from Hermione, his eyebrows raised with an incredulous expression.
Before Harry could even take a step, he paused - a strong smell crawling up under his nose. He recognised it instantly, Malfoy’s cologne. No matter what, it seemed he couldn’t get rid of the blonde haired git.
His lips had barely even began adjusting to the stretch before Potter started gradually pushing in his cock, the hand on his thigh was holding onto him like a lifeline.
Harry held his arm out, to which Draco looked confusedly between the other’s eyes and his outstretched arm. Potter raised a dark eyebrow at him, almost in a challenging way.
“Yeah, I know. And he only thinks about kissing one.” Ron sent a wink to his best friend, laughing more at the way Harry groaned at his crush being mentioned again.
“Kinda like lucid dreaming, in a way.” Ron added as Hermione nodded, catching gazes with the twins again.
Draco couldn’t explain it but being so close was intoxicating, the feeling that Potter gave him was almost indescribable. It was everything he needed, craved and wanted.
“He’s had bad anxiety before but never to this level.” Narcissa answered for him, her large, warm eyes switching between Harry and her son. Draco nodded his head to show that he understood, he blushed slightly at the fact that they were still touching - he made no move to pull away though and neither did Harry.
“He’s where?” Fred’s tone was incredibly curious, George - although not having said anything - had the exact same expression.
He once again had to remind himself that this was in his head, he didn’t know for sure what Draco’s kinks were. He had a few guesses though. Harry had a good idea that his fantasies weren’t all that different then what actual sex with him would be like, the thought ignited a fire throughout his sweaty body.
Pulses of excited nerves rushed through Draco’s body, the tension thick like smoke as it overwhelmed him in a way he enjoyed. Aggressive butterflies fluttered inside his stomach, he stayed silent with bated breath.
Draco was already shaking and felt a warm tingle spread all throughout his body at being under such deep observation from those, oh so alluring, almost obsidian eyes.
The words made Draco want to sob as he felt his hair get yanked backwards, pulling him off for a moment. His first instinct was to cough after having something so large not there anymore, slurping obscenely in a way that deepened the colour on his cheeks but only made Harry more turned on.
Draco showed no signs of hostility, he literally couldn’t. Narcissa had looked at the other cautiously, wondering what he was going to do. Harry had raised his hands in mock surrender as he sent a soft smile over to his mother, she looked a little taken aback at first since all she’d ever seen of him was his enraged expression towards Lucius.
“Shush! Quiet!” At first, the class just thought Snape was being how he normally was - strict. Then they saw his face, he was eavesdropping. Encouraging the class to do the same, that hadn’t changed.
Blood was not only rushing to his lower half but every other inch of his body, he knew he must look ridiculous. His cheeks a dark crimson red, richer than blood as the tips of his ears were an identical colour. He felt sweat starting to collect at the back of his neck and the entirety of his body felt like someone had just poured gas all over him and lit a match.
Hermione’s explanation worked as the boys nodded in understanding laced with powerful intrigue, the Slytherin’s now also understood. Draco’s head, however, was spinning.
Draco had his eyes squeezed tight before he remembered what he’d been told, he opened them to see a dark gaze penetrating his own. He once again, couldn’t help but whimper as Harry pushed even more of his cock into his mouth. All he could do was let his tongue slide against the underside of Potter’s hard on, the sheer size and girth allowing him no other movement - he could barely hollow his cheeks but tried his very best.
He was then ripped out of his thoughts as Potter pulled both his boxers and jeans back up, efficiently tucking himself back into the clothing. The Slytherin was confused by the strange urgency at first, he soon realised what was going on.
“Needed a moment? That’s fine, we all do.” Harry was suspicious of Snape’s words, Ron’s smile made him realise that maybe he was just being nice today.
Potter only chuckled, ominously. He took a step closer to Draco, in no means were they touching but it was close enough to intimidate the fuck out of him.
He had only seen dicks that big in those muggle pornos that Blaise had shown in, his friend had explained to him that not many guys were as well endowed. What luck Draco had to be in this situation with Potter - after he found the courage - he could not wait to tell him.
The blush, that still resided on his face, got stronger in pigment. The fact that Potter knew he was going to be so loud that he needed a muffling enchantment had his cheeks burning uncomfortably.
“T-Thank you, Harry. Really, i-it means a lot.” His voice was still extremely shaky from the panic attack but it was steadily getting back to normal, he managed a genuine smile that got wider as the other reciprocated.
“I hope we get fancy coffins for our funeral.” Harry tried his best to keep his laugh in at Ron’s word, he really shouldn’t find it funny when they really were probably going to get murdered.
“We didn’t know that it was going to last 24 hours until I finally found the description of the potion in a book, we did not expect that. We thought we could deal with horny Harry for a couple hours but a whole night and day, amateur mistake.”
Then Harry’s fingers moved down from his cheeks, finding their way to the holes in the jeans - just where his thighs met the curve of his arse.
Oh boy did he thrive off of hearing Draco beg, his shaky voice barely audible from the whimpers spilling from his mouth during every pause between his words. He got off on making the bitchy Malfoy become putty in his hands, his for the taking. Making him beg just to be touched.
He then realised what he had said and how he was acting by the twins’ entertained expressions, he groaned loudly.
Draco knew that he was being riled up, he was aware of it. He just couldn’t resist it, the growing smirk on Potter’s face only made it worse.
One hand was pulling those almost platinum strands whilst the other trailed down Draco’s heated face, he cupped his chin for a moment before moving up to hold his hand against his cheek. He could feel his cock fucking into that warm and wet mouth, one of Draco’s hands joined his; resting against it before gripping and holding it.
Draco's left to prepare for his meeting with Harry later on, surely it'll go along smoothly until then.
“So, after that whole thing. He ended up kissing, well, making out with Ron.” Hermione smiled cutely with her teeth, the whole thing was still incredibly amusing to her.
The taunting yet arousing names were turning the Slytherin into an even bigger mess, he had no idea how much things were about to escalate.
Harry could tell that the other was so sensitive, just from how he reacted to the simple touch through the clothing.
“Jesus ‘Mione, he’s boiling!” Harry made a noise of gratitude at the cold temperature of Ron’s hand against the heat of his forehead, Ron just felt bad. All jokes and teasing left his mind, his only objective now was to make Harry feel at least a little better.
Harry spoke in a slight condescending tone, no actual cruelty in his words; just joking around with his best friend. Ron mumbled an apology before snorting discreetly, well, what he thought was discreet anyway. He didn’t miss the way the corner of Harry’s mouth twitched either.
Merlin, Draco couldn’t stop his body from shaking; more turned on than he had ever been in his entire life.
His eyes were on Draco’s in a millisecond, he watched as his eyes looked down to his mouth - at the expression he had. It only made his smirk more powerful as he noted the way Draco’s adam’s apple moved in as he gulped.
Harry was hard, fully hard. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to keep it from showing, he was a little larger than average - he would just have to deal with the fact that he could not conceal the hard on that was throbbing in his pants.
Shoving them a little past his thighs, he kept his gaze on Draco - almost laughing from how shaky he was. Now all that was between his cock and the blonde’s mouth was a piece of thin, black fabric.
His glanced feverishly across his surroundings, feeling reality kicking in. It took him a little while to really come back down to earth, he tried to ignore the part of himself that was aching to go back to visualising.
Harry knew that this was all in his head, how this was just a fantasy conjured up by a lust potion about the boy he’d been thinking about for years now. He had already come to terms with the fact that nothing was ever gonna happen and as much as he hated it, he knew that being real with himself was the best way to go - false hope was something he did not fuck with.
Inside the classroom, Ron whipped his head towards the door at hearing his friends voices. Draco also looked, equally as nervous as Potter to face him. There were a few hushed whispers going around the room.
But Pansy had come up with an idea, she asked the blonde if he wanted to add some more cuts to them. Draco, albeit reluctantly, said yes. He didn’t know how muggle style worked, these had been his first proper pair of muggle clothing. His fashionable best friend had taken him and as much as Draco called a menace sometimes, she did know what looked good on him.
Potter’s large and heated hands then moved from his hips to his ass, squeezing the pudgy flesh ruthlessly.
“No, no. I mean, they’ve ripped but they aren’t ruined. They’re even fucking better, oh my god!” Pansy’s voice sounded giddy, suspiciously so. He had no idea what the girl was talking about, he furrowed his eyebrows as he turned around to look at her - a grin had appeared on her lips.
Snape was gonna have their necks, they were late again. For the third time this week! Ron and Harry gave each other worried looks as they halted their run as they approached the door.
i hope you enjoy! :) (i currently can't write anything better since i have a damn migraine but i hope whoever's reading this is having a good day!)
“What a silly, pretty boy. You know full fucking well why I asked you here and we both know why you decided to come here. Now, don’t play dumb with me.”
Draco lost focus on his inner monologue as Harry had moved his left hand to rest on the top of his jeans, it didn’t surprise him when a toothy grin appeared on the other’s face. He was just lucky that Draco enjoyed being teased with.
Draco was using every particle of power that he still had left to keep the noises in that he knew would only cause more embarrassment.
“Hermione, you may go now. You can tell the class what you smell after you get back.” The girl nodded, jumping out of her seat and jogging to the door. As soon as it was shut she began frantically looking, knowing all of his hiding spaces it definitely wouldn’t be hard.
Draco and Harry’s friends were all watching with wide eyes and baited breath, fully entranced in what was playing out right in front of them. Their eyes switching between Malfoy and Potter.
“Doesn’t surprise me, especially with this perky little arse of yours - how fucking tight they are too. And you just kept them, specifically wearing them tonight. I do wonder, Draco, if you did this on purpose.”
Harry’s hands were back in his hair, not yet pulling but a solid reminder of who was in control - Draco revelled from it.
He was brought back to the moment when Harry grasped his cock, stroking himself in a way that look tortuously slowly.
“You were imagining, weren’t you.” Hermione’s tone told Harry that she already knew full well where he’d been inside his head, they had already experienced this after all.
Harry’s eyes were set in stone on Draco, he had never seen such a darkened look come from those eyes before. It made his body tingle from the sheer intensity of the stare, he was sure that Potter’s once green eyes were now black.
He raised both eyebrows at Draco before letting them flick back down to their natural placement, he knew what that meant. He wasn’t the only one who had heard Pansy’s explanation, if he wasn’t sure it was them before; now he sure as hell did.
He let his gaze drop down to his neck where a tie hung there loosely, the same neck that he’d had fantasies about marking up. Licking and biting until Draco’s whole neck was covered in bruises, showing who he belonged too from the hickies adorning his bleached skin.
“Would you prefer for me to start jacking off right here? Because I will.” He revelled at his friends’ faces. Most in particular though was Draco’s, as he allowed his eyes to observe the boy once more.
His bottom lip was wobbling without his permission as he stared down at his legs, trying to distract himself from how he could feel the heat radiating off of the other man.
The Slytherin blushed a dark shade of crimson, he was honestly surprised that his cheeks weren’t permanently shaded with pigment at this point. His breathing was incredibly uneven, the breath being knocked out of him from the question. Instantly, Draco averted his gaze to the ground - staring pointedly at their shoes.
“It actually used to be a cupboard, me and Ron were fucking about one day and I used ‘engorgio’ - it was no longer a small cupboard. I told Mcgonagall and she said it could be used as a panic room and since I was the only one to get severe panic attacks, and from what the others had said, it was mine.”
“N-No! Of c-course not. It wasn’t e-even meant to be a l-lust potion, it was m-meant to be a l-love potion.”
Harry’s tone was commanding and dark, there wasn’t a bone in the blonde’s body that wanted to disobey the other.
He nodded desperately, wanting to cry out at the way Potter’s lips had dragged against the sensitive skin on his neck from his own movement. He was glad he remembered that he had eyes on him, or else he would’ve been emitting noises that he knew would’ve only embarrassed him. But like Harry said, he wouldn’t be keeping noises from him anymore.
“And to answer your question, I don’t know exactly. All he said to me when I last saw him was to not wait up for him.”
Potter chuckled again, but this time it was different. Before it had been lighthearted and innocent, this time it had shaken Draco to his very core. He didn’t understand how a laugh could sound so sinister yet so arousing, he refused to think about it too hard.
He could see, even through the jeans, that his eyes hadn’t been deceiving or playing tricks on him before. He hadn’t seen a cock like that except for the couple muggle gay porn videos that Blaise had shown him, even then he knew that Potter had them all beat. He could see the girth, for a moment imagining the stretch it’d put his lips under. It’d probably feel like too much, overwhelming, Draco craved to see for himself. How far his cock would stretch his lips, it was incredible.
At the mention of the word ‘cock’, his friends’ eyes slid down Harry’s body. All by accident, of course. Just hearing the word made them all unconsciously look down to said cock, they couldn’t contain their reactions in the slightest. All of their eyes widened, Harry couldn’t figure out why at first.
He tried to distract himself from the other’s highly arousing words, reverting to his slightly argumentative persona to stop himself from growing hard too soon. His body was way too sensitive from not having cum earlier.
“A bubble scent, wood from a broomstick handle and treacle tart.” He had barely mumbled the words audibly, everyone had heard them though.
“Well it isn’t hard to miss, you can’t hide that at all.” Ron tried to say it cooly but snorted at the way it sounded as it came out, cracking up the others slightly.
Then he heard Potter clear his throat, that wasn’t unintentional. He knew that for a fact, his boots starting to squash his skin a little harder - pinching his skin a little. The slight pricks of pain it caused just rushing straight to his prick, he cringed at that. Guess this really was the day of self discovery.
Then he was gone, well, kind of. As soon as Harry’s body was turned, Draco had let his eyes drop straight down to the ground to avoid the looks on his friends’ faces.
“Harry! Don’t joke about him!” Hermione scolded but was holding off from laughing, what her friends didn’t know wouldn’t hurt them.
Hermione pitched in, chuckling more when a blush crawled its way up Ron’s neck; yet again. It took Harry a moment to realise what had been said.
A large and warm hand then made its way to the other side of Draco’s neck, a possessive hold as Harry let his tongue lick in an upwards motion. He then slid his hand up to his cheek before he bit down, Draco’s jaw went slack as an unintentional moan attempted to make its way out of his now agape mouth. Potter’s hand was covering his mouth in an instinct, muffling the noise before it escaped into the air.
That made him whip his head up, so fast that he wouldn’t be surprised if he gave himself whiplash. The dark tone that underlined the Gryffindor’s words had Draco’s entire body tensing up, he had no control of it.
Draco would be incredibly stupid to pass this up, he may have been enemies with the man just this morning but he had realised that his obsession might have been something more than hatred - most likely a crush. He really didn’t want to admit to it but from everything that has happened today, he did not have it in him to care anymore.
Harry was supposed to be the one with the lust potion, not Draco! The blonde could feel his thighs tingle at Potter’s dirty words, and they weren’t even directed at him. The sultry tone had made Draco’s heart start pounding in his chest, he was still in slight shock that Harry was the one causing the spill of arousal as it slowly made its way throughout his whole body.
Harry plopped himself down right in front of Draco as he sat on the table, legs spread as his boots sat on either side of the blonde’s thighs and cock right on show for Draco.
His bottom lip wobbled at the thought, his fears coming true as he felt the stirring in his gut. One of pleasure, he wasn’t even being touched and he felt little shocks surge throughout his body - straight to his rising prick. It wouldn’t surprise him if it were somehow Potter’s magic causing his physical feelings, the thought only added to his struggle.
Harry then hissed out in pain again as he increased the tight hold he had on his forehead, scowling at nobody except the pain this potion was giving him. This hadn’t happened last time.
“Hey! I still told her, didn’t I.” Ron pouted as he took another bite of his chocolate bar before wrapping it back up and sliding it back inside his robes, glad for the cooling charm he had placed on it earlier. The twins put their hands up in mock surrender, he could practically hear the ‘touché’ wanting to slip from their mouths.
“About the fantasy shit, that’s not even the worst thing you’ve said out loud. I distinctly remember when you said you wanted too-“ Ginny immediately stopped speaking when she saw Harry’s face, much to the disappointment of Fred and George.
Draco took the scrolls from his professor’s pale hands and groaned inwardly, why didn’t he just complete it earlier like everyone else.
He would have to work fast if he wanted to have it done before he went to visit Potter, the thought made him shiver slightly. He hoped that Snape hadn’t noticed.
“Aren’t you glad that I used a muffling spell, wouldn’t even surprise me if it didn’t work - considering how you’re already on the way to moaning like a whore.”
Now that Harry’s hand was off his cock, there was nothing between Draco’s eyes and him. Since he first saw it he knew but his brain was only just processing how big the other truly was, he couldn’t help but gape again.
hey! so if you - the reader - don't want this as part of the actual plot then that's cool, it's not integral to the story and i just wanted to play around with the idea. i am honestly just glad you're reading lol.
The 5 sat back down, until Snape motioned for them to all sit at the front. Hermione made her way over to Harry and Ron whilst Draco and Pansy sat at the table beside them.
“Shit.” That was all that Ron could say as he noticed how blown out his friends' eyes were, his own widening in result. There was silence for a moment, nobody really knowing what in the hell they should say, Hermione was the first to come to her senses; as usual.
The tone in his voice made his words highly unbelievable but he was using everything inside of himself to cling on to the little remaining pieces of his control. It was a losing battle, he let his eyes slip shut as he took a deep breath. He ignored his friends’ disbelieving expressions and focused, however, he was soon gritting his teeth.
He, reluctantly, didn’t bite hard enough to leave a mark though, that was for later. Harry released his teeth as he let his tongue glide over the ever so slightly discoloured skin, it wasn’t noticeable - only to him.
The potion’s effects were having a moment of calm, which allowed Harry to be able to joke around with his friend again. He put a hand over his heart and on his face was a fake offended expression, the others giggled.
“We know.” Goyle smirked as he placed his gaze heavily on Draco, making the other boy blush just a little harder than he was before from Potter’s words.
“Oh come on, we know that you aren’t the only one that likes guys in that room.” For some reason that settled him slightly, sending an apologetic glance at his friend for his words. Hermione didn’t even have to reply, she understood.
Draco still pondered on whether or not to even try speak, he wasn’t sure that his voice would come out at all.
“It’s not at all a problem. I suffer from panic attacks too and have slowly learnt how to help others with them, I’m glad that I could help. And thank you for your kind words.” Harry didn’t really know what to say, he just felt a strange happiness at the moment. Warmth bubbling when both Narcissa and Draco smiled back, he couldn’t quite handle it.
“He always drilled in me to be perfect, the best at everything. My mother helped a lot, butting in when he went too far. But many times, she got scared and didn’t.”
Potter then leaned back down to his neck, wasting no time as he began sucking and biting the unmarked patches of his snowflake skin. He took grave enjoyment in knowing that Draco wouldn’t be able to cover these up, he’d be forced to have everyone know that he belonged to Harry.
Draco couldn’t hold back the moans that flooded out of his cock filled mouth, not only was it the harshness and the throat fucking but how his hair was being pulled so cruelly. Every strand yanked sent electric shocks of pleasure from the roots, all the way down to his aching prick. He loved it all.
Harry couldn’t help the look of sympathy on his face, his heart ached at the thought. The Dursley’s and Lucius must’ve shared some traits, just slightly different.
“You did, Harry. And pretty loudly at that.” Hermione whispered, trying to ignore the quickly growing smirk from Ginny - it only made her own smirk harder to will away.
They jumped when they heard tapping at the window, it was Snape ushering them away. Draco sighed, getting ready to speak.
From being so focused on the man in front of him, he hadn’t even took the chance to see where they were. He shifted his eyes, reluctantly, off of Harry and began to look around the room.
Draco had barely heard it from how soft the other had said it, a drastic contrast to how his voice had sounded before. Potter had his wand pointed towards the bed side table, where an empty glass stood. The blonde hadn’t even noticed its presence but watched as it was filled with icy water, it looked tempting.
“Me. You may think that your little lust potion is what snapped in me earlier, that’s partly true. But what you don’t know is that I’ve been wanting to do this to you for years, the potion only pushed me to do it. And now I have you.”
Even though he was fully clothed he felt his breathing increase, he felt completely naked. He was almost in awe as he watched as Potter repeated the process, dragging his assertive gaze up and down Draco, assessing the boy from what he could see.
The words that eased so teasingly and derisively in a way that made Draco’s “tough” exterior crumble to pieces, he was so easily taken apart by his rival and it made his skin itch with a desperate need.
“Remember what I said.” The tone was unsettling and intimidating. Draco gulped at how pissed Potter would be if he had gone against him, he sputtered on the words that hurriedly made their way out of his mouth.
Harry shoved his fingers inside of the open fabric, wrapping his fingers around the flesh of his thighs and digging in roughly.
“I-I once had to wear s-some of P-Pansy’s underwear, y-you can’t see them through the holes l-like you can w-with boxers.”
His thoughts were full of all the sin that it was before and it made his prick swell even more in the tight confines of his trousers, his bottom lip wobbled as his eyes jolted back up to Harry’s.
“Back to the story then.” George muffled out through a mouth full of chocolate, Ginny lightly punched his arm.
“Yeah, I’d still love to fuck his brains out.” A dark smirk played on his lips as he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. He once again scanned the room, his eyes growing darker when he saw the source of his sexual frustration.
His stutter undermined the intent of his words terribly, he cringed inwardly. He knew that Harry would pick up on it, probably tease him for it. And Draco could not believe that being teased turned him on so much.
His friends were shocked too, not expecting to hear such words come from golden boy’s lips. Draco knew for a fact though that his friends, although shocked, felt nothing more than intrigue and eagerness to know more whilst he was getting turned on.
The blonde sputtered, no words getting close to leaving his mouth. His mouth opening and closing like a fish, he knew he must’ve looked ridiculous but he had no power to stop it. Potter chuckled, it sent an icy chill through Draco’s body.
Whilst half of his friends were contemplating what the fuck Harry was gonna do to the snakes, the other half were looking at him with an eyebrow raised; still wanting a proper answer to Ginny’s question.
“Didn’t wanna risk walking you in here physically, apparating covers our tracks a bit better.” Harry was just glad that he could apparate on Hogwarts ground, seeing as he was from the Gryffindor line.
“We’ll explain more about the fantasies later, we’re a bit ahead in the story.” Ron explained as if he were telling a fairy tale, not sex fantasies that his best friend spewed out to him in a horny rant.
“Touché.” Ron slanted his finger towards Harry as he spoke whilst the twins’ curiosity got the best of them.
This lasted at least 5 minutes, which all consisted of Draco jumping up and down as he tried to pull them up. He looked ridiculous but he didn’t care, he just wanted the jeans to fit.
He knew he’d been told a command, that thought alone made his stomach swirl, but he just couldn’t look away. He wanted to make sure he wasn’t actually drooling as the outline of Potter’s cock strained heavily against his black jeans. Pushing so hard against the seams that Draco was surprised they hadn’t ripped from the pure amount of force against them, another shiver wracked his body.
Snape raised a caliginous eyebrow before letting it drop again, it twitched after the action. He then pulled a couple scrolls from behind his back, seemingly appearing from nowhere behind the black void of his cloak.
Every word from Narcissa’s mouth was genuine, it had pulled harshly on Harry’s heart strings. Ever since he first met Draco’s mother, he had seen her golden heart through the supposedly “evil” exterior. All she wanted to do was care for her son, protect him - just like his mother had. He found himself smiling widely at her, happy that he had helped her.
“Huge boner?” Pansy pointed out, forcing herself to giggle faintly. The last thing she wanted was to expose what they had done just because she couldn’t keep a laugh in.
“Hermione, Ginny and I have already heard most of these so we’re not that fazed. Still didn’t expect him to say that here though! But we’ll get to the fantasies later, like I said.” The twins nodded their head.
“What the hell?” Pansy queried, she related to the pure confusion she saw on Draco’s face. All of them were grossly invested in what Hermione was about to say. The other’s were sat in silence, straining their ears so hard to listen that they were probably going to pop a blood vessel.
He sent a look of ‘I’m sorry’ before quickly looking back to the Gryffindor to try and figure out his feelings by his facial expressions, he realised that it was impossible. Potter always had a way of masking what he truly felt, making himself unreadable. And that was unnerving.
“By the way, he doesn’t have a small dick but nice try. Nevermind, you know anyway.” Neville had attempted to whisper, but as usual it didn’t quite work out as he heard his voice come out louder than he meant. The last part of his sentence was said a little quieter so he didn’t know if anyone had heard him.
The addition she had added was a few extra cuts right at the thigh, asymmetrical on either side. Draco had to admit, they did look good.
The boy shook in his place as his eyes dropped straight down to Harry’s hand’s actions then back to his eyes, he repeated that for as long as Harry allowed himself the touch.
Potter’s tone was oozing with husk, so low that Draco could feel the vibrations through his quaking body. Harry’s hands had moved from that pretty face, down to his hips; gripping them possessively.
Hermione tried to ward the small grin off of her lips, the memories of Harry explaining those imaginative scenarios to her, Ron and Ginny flooding her mind unhelpfully.
Potter’s lips pulled up into an almost taunting grin, he really did not want to see the look in his eyes - for good reason too. As soon as they made eye contact, those tenebrous eyes were gazing straight into his soul. He couldn’t help how his mouth hung open a little, his bottom lip shaking from the raw intensity of the look being shot.
As soon as they landed on him, they were gone again. Half of him was dissatisfied whilst the other was rather glad, if he wasn’t allowed to cum yet then he most definitely didn’t need those lustful eyes dragging over every inch of him. Merlins beard, he was already so submissive for Potter - he both hated and loved it.
After he had started turning, his back facing Harry, he heard a noise that made his whole body freeze - stopping dead in his tracks.
Draco fiddled with his hands, fully aware that soon he’d be swallowing down the other down. He wanted to touch him but felt was too awkward to make the move, it felt strange doing it with being demanded first. Merlin, he was in deep.
The words were growled in his ear and fuck if Draco was going to disobey them, his body shivered instinctively.
“As much as I’d love to cum in that talented mouth of yours, or on that pretty face, I’ve got a better idea.”
He tucked a finger under Draco’s chin, pulling his face up to look at him. Draco couldn’t help but blush at the gesture, his heart hammering in his chest.
“You’ll be fine mate, just a couple mor-“ Ron was interrupted instantly, he could practically feel the sexual tension and frustration oozing out of his friend.
Draco’s cheeks darkened at his unconscious submission, he hadn’t even thought twice about it. Merlin, he was so gone for this man. The praise made a smile appear on his lips, one which he didn’t even realise was there until Potter smirked knowingly down at him - his cheeks gained more colour after that.
It made everything even worse when he remembered that he was being watched intently, he could feel those eyes burning into him.
“You are, just after you’ve talked.” She shared a glance with the other two, waving as she tugged them both along.
“Fucking into him so hard that all he can do is scream, shoving my cock down his throat as he lets himself choke on it, fingering him until he cries. You know, the usual.”
“P-Please, Potter.” The grin that placed itself on Harry’s lips had the blonde boy reeling, he recognised the teasing expression that always left him aching for it.
That was Ron, he listened as the two shared a quiet laugh. He always admired how Harry’s friends were there for him, constantly ready to face death because of their love for their friend. Draco had never shown it, hell, he had been awful to them - he was already planning on his apology, after tonight of course - but he respected their friendship.
His legs were still a little numb but before he got a chance to try speak some shaky words, he was being guided to a chair. He graciously sat down on it as Harry sat on one directly across from him, hands still in the exact same place.
Despite the vulgar situation, Draco found himself blushing more. Not from the gorgeous cock being stroked in front of his face, or from Potter’s earlier words - they would add to it later no doubt - but from the compliment. It may have been a strange thing to get all sentimental about but after dealing with such harsh confidence issues, it made him feel a lot better.
The slight calm buzz of their conversation was interrupted as Fred and George, who like their sister also appeared out of nowhere, sat down either side of Harry.
Harry turned to face Draco’s still cowering figure, he knew the other could feel the eyes on him as his gaze slowly lifted until they collided. His bottom lip was shaking again but was swiftly caught between his teeth, a way to try control it.
All he knew, was that he was growing hornier for the man in front of him every single second. He needed to at least try and persuade Potter that he still had a little fight left in him, that he hadn’t completely melted into a puddle of arousal on the floor - even if Draco didn’t believe it either.
“Sure.” He paused a minute before finally locking eyes with his former rival, his stomach swirling. “We’re gonna talk, aren’t we?” Dreading it whilst also thankful, it had been way too long.
“Welcome back.” He could hear the grin in Ron’s voice as his friend patted him on the shoulder, he already knew what had happened.
He looked down as soon as the boot of his shoe came in front of their table, not from not having the balls to look them in the eye but just to fuck with them.
“Okay, that’s fine. Go do whatever you need to do.” Draco felt relief overtake his body, physically relaxing as he wouldn’t have to come up with a sorry excuse for a reason.
“W-What?” He knew acting innocent wouldn’t save him at this point, only get him into deeper trouble - he didn’t know if he minded that though.
Potter still hadn’t moved, allowing his intimidating presence to wash over Draco. The lust potions effects were still circulating in his body and overruling his mind, pleasure washed over his body in unyielding waves.
Said pair was kept in Pansy’s room to make sure nobody found them in Draco’s possession, they doubted it would be an easily explained situation.
He jumped out of his skin when he heard a voice speak from close behind him, squeaking from surprise as his eyes snapped open.
Harry and Draco’s eyes were locked, instantly. The charcoal darkness in Potter’s eyes still just as strong and his gaze didn’t falter, only grew stronger. Draco couldn’t stop the blood from rushing to his cheeks, the heat in them making him want to scream in annoyance. Why did he have to be so bloody obvious.
He had heard the expression before but never really believed such thing, now he couldn’t deny it. To anybody else, this might’ve terrified them but to Draco; it only made his own prick throb harder. He never thought he’d be such a size queen but here he was, very turned on and very intimidated.
Hermione put her hand over her mouth in an attempt to stop laughing more as she noticed how Ron’s cheeks were now dusted with red pigment.
“I remember all throughout the day, Harry was just sweating constantly. Looked like a bloody waterfall, kinda like how he does now. I literally had to bring his work up to the front when he was finished so people didn’t see the huge boner showing through his jeans.”
Their gazes met instantly, Draco’s cheeks a fiery red as if he had just used a pick up line on him - not like his cock wasn’t nestled down his throat.
Before, he would’ve never allowed himself to admit it. But after the absolute shitstorm his day had been, he let himself admit it. He didn’t want to say how riled up Potter’s power really got him, he’d save that for another day of self confession.
The words had spilled out of his mouth that he liked wearing them and Pansy didn’t laugh or judge, she had just mentioned that she was gonna buy him his own pair someday soon. And that’s one of the many reasons that Draco loved her.
Harry turned the key, quickly pulling him inside and shutting the door. Actually turning on the light this time instead of using his wand. As soon as the door shut, Draco dropped his bag to the floor - as did Harry. Neither knowing who was gonna find the courage to speak first.
The smile that graced Harry’s lips, eventually, turned into the grin that he had before. Draco felt a chill envelope him as it tickled his spine with bitter coolness, he identified the feeling as power; Potter’s power. It rolled off the other with ease, in a way that had the Slytherin squirming in place.
This wasn’t what was meant to happen. After friends of Draco’s; Pansy, Goyle, Crabbe and Blaise had heard Ron and Hermione discussing Potter’s crush, it had sent their minds into overdrive.
“We do share a dorm and we have showered with you countless times before. Not to mention the showers after either a Quidditch game or just practice, everybody in those showers have seen it and I bet they’re all jealous. Or maybe they just want you to fuck them.”
Potter growled out his words, enunciating them by squeezing the flesh between his fingers almost cruelly - Draco’s knees buckled on instinct.
“-mischievous it is; sneaking Harry a lust potion.” George finished, sharing a look with his brother. One that screamed trouble, that they were usually doing.
After weighing his options and how much time he had left, he was just gonna go with no underwear. He grabbed the jeans and pulled them up his slender legs, immensely struggling once it got to his upper thighs.
Draco stayed like that for another minute or so, momentarily forgetting where he was. He quickly found out when his ears zoned in on the low and heavy breathing coming from above him, he could do nothing more than squeak and drop his hand back into his lap.
From not having cum all day, Draco’s body and mind were extremely sensitive. Harry knew that and took joy in playing with the fact.
Then Harry found his lips stretched into an almost cruel smirk as his eyes drifted lower, he saw the slight tenting in the other’s tight school trousers. So now he knew that he was definitely affecting him, he made sure to quickly look down to his legs as to finish his observation.
He especially didn’t trust it when he looked up and for the millionth time today, caught Potter’s eye.
“Yeah, thanks.” The small talk between them wasn’t awkward, it was strangely comfortable. Draco felt safe in there with Harry and he must’ve let it show on his face, Harry wasn’t grinning enticingly at him - not yet anyway - but smiling softly at him. It was nice.
“Now, say it.” Harry’s words were like venom as he dropped Draco’s hand and stopped gripping his chin, he raised a dark eyebrow.
Harry could only stare darkly at the other, seeing how his lips were swollen obscenely and he still had both spit and precum staining that pretty mouth of his. Draco’s lungs refused to work from the gaze, his heart stuttered in his chest.
“You kinda were.” For a moment they got lost in each other’s eyes, never having been this close unless they were fighting. As cliche as it is, it felt like they were looking into each others souls.
“Could you not put your cloak back on to try help..conceal it?” Hermione suggested, bringing back the earlier topic of conversation.
Draco’s eyes widened, his heart stuttering harshly in his chest once more. He’d only just been made aware of this newly foun- okay. Today was the day that he realised he’d had a crush on his rival for a long time, it was baffling how he didn’t realise sooner. Blinded by what he thought was hatred but was in fact undiscovered feelings, and the strange sexual tension that’s always been there between the two of them.
“If you don’t want this, tell me. We can forget all about it, it’s fine, I will not hold it against you.” Draco wanted to interrupt and explain how much he wanted whatever was going to happen, to happen. He didn’t get the chance as Potter continued speaking.
“You wanna come hang out with me and study for a bit?” They caught what she meant straight away, Pansy gently pulled their robes towards her and they started to walk off.
He quickly got distracted by the thought of the hard heat that was so close to him, he made the mistake of letting his eyes flick back down to Potter’s cock that was prominent against his jeans. Draco couldn’t tell, but Harry had followed his gaze sharply. Once again, an enchanting yet unnerving smirk was on his lips.
He popped open the button, his jeans opening without any effort from the strain the were under from his hard on. The grin on his lips getting wider at how Malfoy’s mouth was practically watering, he loved how eager the other looked.
He’d expected giggling at the sight, ripping pants isn’t exactly something that isn’t funny. So he was rather surprised when he heard her gasp, not in a negative way either. He remembered what she had said and what had happened, word for word.
Draco knew what that gaze meant, he still had not answered him. Potter was just circling his fingers around his rim, so damn teasingly. He wasn’t gonna do a thing until he answered, but Draco didn’t know if his voice would allow it.
“Am I really gonna be forced to answer.” He rolled his eyes to show his annoyance, exhaling loudly as Snape stared him down.
“My guess is that after what I’m going to do to you, you’re gonna be loud. And as hot and as much as I’d enjoy having everyone hear you screaming my name, I don’t want your dignity to be in complete shambles - to the rest of my house particularly - so I’ll give you something.”
Draco’s gaze then refocused on Harry, his heart stuttering in his chest at how his grin had grown wider.
“Because, seeing you embarrassed.” He grabbed Draco’s hand, placing it against the large of his cock through his jeans. “Does so much to me.”
Draco had frantically tried to complete his work, he struggled to remember what had actually happened during the class thanks to the hard heat between his legs. It was incredibly distracting and hard to focus.
Harry decided to help him out and pointed towards the dust of what was left of the glass, swiping his middle and index finger in an upwards motion.
“I like you. There’s no point denying it, you now know from earlier. I always questioned why I could never get you out of my head. I just thought that’s what enemies were like, obsessing every moment. After speaking to Hermione I realised, I’ve always liked you. I always pushed those feelings to the back because I was too stupid to realise that it wasn’t normal and that I wasn’t straight, I guess you’ve already heard the story thanks to those shitty thin walls.”
