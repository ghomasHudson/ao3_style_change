"Luckily I don't have to go through them," Draco said to himself. He knew the grounds of Hogwarts well enough to picture a bit of grassy lawn beyond the tent, and he hoped most of the guards would be posted on the side of the tent facing the battle.
"What's going on?"
"Okay, okay, enough of this emotional stuff. The kid's British. Now we need a little help," Paige gestured to the pallet lying in the dining room and its occupant. "This is Severus. Our little Draco's godfather and a very injured… witch."
"You cannot do this, Lucius."
Severus started at this. "What?"
Draco stifled a gasp of satisfaction as he got the hole big enough to slip through, and he made it into the tent in time to hear Harry growl and see him lunge at the Dark Lord. Draco muttered a curse. Harry looked terrible, blood stained and exhausted. Chances were good that some of the blood was his own and even now Draco heard Voldemort shout a curse and watched a ray of purple light lash across Harry's body. The way the Gruffindor flinched it had to hurt, but even as he saw Voldemort attack the curse light shimmered off the surface of a small metallic object.
One more chapter to go before I run out of prewritten words. The story will still need at least another 1-2 chapters to be capital-D done but I need some encouragement to finish
Phoebe snorted.
Draco knew he had to make his next request more difficult, more complicated. So, with the softest voice he could muster, he asked his father and suitor for a set of clothes that would rival the brightness of the stars in the heavens, in honor of his mother and the constellation that was his name. Lucius acquiesced, as he had with all of Draco's requests, and the work began. Suits were made and discarded by the dozens for not being exactly right, not being perfect. Lucius had all of his advisors work on it, even going so far as to consult with the imprisoned Severus Snape who refused to help and suffered mightily for it, left injured but alive in accordance with the king's orders.
"I agree," a pleasant alto voice said. Draco looked up and saw a heavily tattooed young woman.
Her mind made up, Paige walked out into the hall and saw a familiar figure in the shadows.
The blond didn't stir. Harry remembered an old muggle first aid class well enough to know that he had to get the boy warm. He gathered the slight figure up in his arms and brought him inside. A wave of his wand transformed two couches into a fireplace built up to a hearty blaze.
"He was there. He was in the hall when Shannon was visiting. And now he said something about not wanting a lifetime with you? Could he have heard anything?" Paige aimed the question at Draco, who bit his lip for a moment as he stared into the pattern of the rug.
Harry nodded; then muttered under his breath, "Yes, Mum Weasley."
When he pulled back from the kiss the blond smirked at him, then glared at the still-giggling Hermione.
Severus followed her gaze and smiled at the sight of his students and friends relaxing. It had been months since he'd seen them, and even longer since they acted like the children they still were.
Draco saw the telltale shimmer of tears in the old woman's eyes and felt a rage rise up in him. "You sympathize with that lunatic? He wants to marry me? His own son!"
With an example of vampire grace and speed, Spike was on his feet and standing behind the couch in seconds, "You know, I believe you. Don't ask me why, must be my innate trust in human nature and the goodness of my fellow man."
The red headed man nodded. "Yeah, mate. James Narcissus, if you two don't mind," he said, looking from Draco to Harry.
The man focused on Spike alone. "I know where he is, or at least I think I do. He left here about an hour ago, upset and confused." He pulled some paper from a large stack on the desk and scribbled roughly on it. Pushing it to Spike, he said, "This is where they're staying. I trust you Fangless, don't make me regret it."
"Harry? Draco's Harry? The massive crush that has haunted his heart since he was prepubescent? That Harry?"
"See Harry. It's no wood elf, just some vagrant," the red head said.
Harry opened his mouth to say something, to ask—but his throat was dry and harsh and he choked on the words, coughing harshly.
Draco pulled down the shade and opened the mirror on the back. Leaning forward, he opened his mouth, seeing the Slytherin green ball resting in the center of his tongue. He shifted the muscle slightly and watched the shining silver bar thrust through the pink flesh. Draco tapped the ball against his teeth, then caught it between them. There was no pain, but it did feel… different.
"I'm not entirely sure what's happening," was Severus's unsatisfying reply and Harry bit back a groan. He knew there was a bigger reason for a Charmed One and her white lighter to come back from California, and he needed to find out what it was.
"Just as well. They're both bent, this may be the closest either of them get to a namesake."
I love you."
"Me neither. Why the hell do muggles drink that rubbish?" A light flush began to spread over the boys face and he pulled at the collar of his shirt. "It's a bit warm in here, isn't it?"
Working his way out from under his friend, Harry rolled Draco over and saw an arrow sticking out of his arm. The wound looked minor, but the boy was sweating and mumbling already.
"Nephew?"
The Dark Lord giggled again. "My goodness, Harry. I never noticed how entertaining you can be. We should have spoken long ago."
While tension was rising inside the Halliwell from Draco's emotional upheaval, rumors about the new demonic weapon were spiking as well. Alex and Spike were keeping in contact and through their connections they passed on information. According to their sources, the Dark Lord that Harry and the others were fighting had gotten involved. When Draco heard that the already pasty white lighter turned a whiter shade of pale and almost passed out. He sat in shock for long moments muttering something about a 'Dark Mark.'
"What is it, Potter?"
Turning to Spike, Severus said, "Who was that, and what did he give you?"
Paige noticed that the dark-haired boy that had come in with the red head, Ron, was missing. She turned to look for him and saw that Draco was gone as well though she had barely noticed when he came back.
Harry's eyes were glazed and weary, but he smiled a bit. "An angel," he mumbled softly, almost too softly for Draco to hear. "My own angel."
Harry had no idea what he wanted, for the blond stranger to be Draco, or someone else completely. But he had to find out for certain.
Harry snorted, but Severus could hear that the threats of tears had been pushed back.
Severus nodded, then caught himself. "I think I fancied myself in love with her at the time. I was going through my romantic adolescence." Severus snorted, and heard Paige giggle lightly beside him.
Blaise began walking back to his bedroom before stopping and turning back to Draco. "Are you all right, really? I know you're an angel now or something, but you really don't look well."
Before Paige had settled on her feet, a cold white hand grabbed her arm, "Where the hell have you been? We were worried about- Paige?"
He turned to the red head, his heart tearing in his chest and she stood and walked over to him, wrapping Draco in her arms and swaying gently from side to side.
His head was throbbing and there was a thick metallic taste in his mouth that he didn't want to think about.
Harry's face turned tomato red from laughing so hard and Paige had to pull over to the side of the road until he could catch his breath. Slowly his laughter died away, but Paige felt her own smile fade as the laughter turned into heaving sobs.
"How long have you been dead, Draco?"
"I don't know what you're talking about, Severus."
"You can't be reassigned, I still need you," Harry shouted. Then, blushing hard, he continued in a quieter tone, "I mean, we still need you. The war isn't over."
Wiping his forehead against his sleeve, Harry took another deep breath and turned to go back into the club. As he stared into the murky smoke filled room, he thought he saw a head of platinum hair catch the light. He knew it was just his mind playing trick on him, but as the blond headed person moved through the room, across the dance floor and towards the offices, Harry found himself following, only stopped by his boss's closed door.
She turned to Ron and said, "You think you can carry him to his room?"
"Then you'd better warn them," Draco said with a carefree laugh, "if I'm this good-looking now, imagine how much trouble I'll get into when I'm legal."
Severus looked around the room. It was small. Chris had been forced to stand in the corner behind the door from lack of space. Most of the available room had been given to a large desk and a battered filing cabinet. The door was closed, a calendar covered in buxom women caressing tractor parts decorating the mottled plywood expanse.
Paige didn't know what to say. Harry looked upset when he left, but without knowing why she didn't want to get Draco's hopes up, or dash them.
After Wyatt's birth and all of the birthing classes she had tended as part of her training as a social worker she knew the sound of that scream.
"Do you?"
The room was tiny, maybe it wasn't a classroom, but some professor's quarters, back in the days when there had been more students, and more teachers needed for them. Tattered couches rested against the walls, and a small balcony opened out into the sky.
When the rocks stopped falling and the dust in the air settled he moved out of the niche and began approaching the student soldiers now scattered injured on the floor. He did triage on them, finding the least injured and sending them to help those more injured to the Infirmary and he drafted some of those who had gotten away unscathed to help him treat the critically wounded.
Gently he removed Draco's hand and pressed a kiss to the tips of his fingers. "I'm not sick. Hermione just startled me." He spared the brunette a glare, but she just giggled.
"I am a bit nervous, but I'm no kid. I-," it stuck in his throat, but Harry went on, "I want to do this."
As the peroxide blond vampire pulled back, Severus saw a bright streak of blood on the brunette's lip.
"What are they," Harry said, and Severus offered a few snap shots he had gathered that morning, angling them so Harry got a good look at what they showed.
"Don't."
The third ran ahead to the tent, where another four guards were waiting. The last four looked stronger than any Death Eaters Harry had seen so far. If he had time to think about it he would have wondered how they remained so strong a they were closer to the weapon than any others, but there was no time for contemplation.
It was a regular morning at Hogwarts. Students clustered around the long tables lined with heavy platters of everything and anything they might want, while pitchers of juice and milk were passed from hand to hand.
Unfortunately, the closer he got to the ground, the more his exhaustion and heart-sickness weighed on him. He hadn't had a proper night of sleep in weeks, since he heard what he thought was Draco giving up on him, on them, and the war had only escalated. His body was weak, his mind was spinning. Pushing his glasses up onto his forehead, Harry rubbed his eyes fiercely with the heels of his hands, the end of his wand, gripped tight in his fist, tapping against the plastic frames.
Severus snorted, "My godson is always around. In my entire life I have only known one other child more likely to be found innocent on the site of an accident. I think he must attract bad luck."
Draco wept into her chest, loud ugly sobs tearing out of his throat.
Walking in, he felt the rush of memories over his skin, "Draco? Love, are you here?"
Abandoning all of his Malfoy training in poise and decorum, which had become easier with every day he spent in the Halliwell manor, he let himself flop into one of the sturdy kitchen chairs and planted his elbows on the table. Across from him, Wyatt was strapped into his high chair and a few feet away Piper stood at the stove and stirred something that filled the air with the scent of cinnamon and spices.
"I don't know."
Paige shook her head, her eyes still focused on the map. "Apparently it's some kind of weapon and it might have to do with a power boost of some kind."
Blaise shook his head vigorously, almost upsetting the glass of pumpkin juice Snape had provided at the boy's querulous request, "No, no. It's just…" Blaise trailed off, and then continued in a stronger voice, "Ron didn't like Draco. If the baby looks like him, then Ron might not want to… to be around us." Blaise sighed, "And besides, it would kill Harry. And Ron would definitely never forgive me for that."
Saying that, he dived over the counter and grabbed her, wrapping his arms tight around her torso and trapping them at her sides. She could orb in this position, but not without taking him with her.
Draco looked confused for a minute, then blushed. "Oh stop it. You know what I meant. Now Harry, I got some of those mushroom things Piper made. I don't know how you can eat fungus, but everyone says they're delicious, so I thought you would like th-"
Harry smiled.
"This isn't going to work. I want it and I think you want it too, but until you can get over this- this- lack of trust or whatever it is, I don't know if we can have a relationship."
"I know you're here. Did you get an invisibility cloak?"
After that one sob the boy didn't cry or make another noise for hours. He just sat on the cot, staring at the wall, and breathing slow and even breaths.
"Harry, are you really recovered?" Hermione's eyes shone with concern and Harry wanted to answer, to tell her he was fine.
He could feel himself changing, and he didn't like it.
"Excuse me? Do you know where I can find the manager? I'm River Evans. I have an interview…"
Severus took the glass from Hermione and thanked her before turning to Longbottom. "You know, I'm not your professor anymore."
Draco nodded, now looking out the kitchen window into the garden beyond, his eyes hazy and distant.
As Harry struggled to his feet, the other man grimaced. "You are too flippant, Mr. Potter. With this machine I plan on destroying your precious castle and everyone inside." Voldemort giggled again, and again Harry felt that stupid high-pitched noise dig into his brain like a drill. "And," Voldemort said, "I'm going to use the magical core of your favorite spy to do it."
In silence they danced for hours, their hands absorbing the warmth of each other's bodies. There were no jokes tonight, no harmless flirting. This was the third night, this was Harry's birthday, this was the end.
Blaise adjusted the baby in his arms and sighed. "Well, I must say, I expected something better."
Severus turned to Paige and she said, "I think they needed to talk. They went into the garden a while ago."
Peeping over the counter, she directed the shining metal at him, but he dodged it.
, Harry thought uncharitably, he took the opportunity. "Malfoy? Which one, Gin?"
"No," Paige said, "I meant we can't help him here. Whitelighter healing isn't helping and I don't know his lab well enough to brew the potions we need. Plus," and she sighed heavily, "We need the book. And I can't bring it here."
Pansy rolled her eyes, "I was saying that I heard the Patil girl saying that there was a party on Friday. Daphne said that everyone was invited so I was thinking we should go." Pansy looked at him expectantly. Any excuse to dress up, Darco thought.
"I wouldn't do that and you know it." And Draco did know it. "I want you to get a cock up your arse as much as you do." She smirked.
"I saw what you did there with Potter." Pansy said when Draco reached her next to the drink table. She had been talking to Granger, who was now dancing with Finnigan near where Draco had just come from. "Genius." She clapped his back and offered him a drink.
Draco grinded his hips slightly against Potter's, feeling the hard press of his cock against his arse. He heard Potter's breath hitch as he gasped slightly. The hands on his hips tightened even more when Draco pressed back again, with a soft and barely there touch. Draco then suddenly turned around and faced Potter, to find the green eyes darkened with obvious lust. Draco pressed his hips against Potter's, drawing in a breath and suppressing a moan, he bit his lip. He brought his hand up to Potter's hair, tangling his fingers in the soft strands. He stood on his toes and pulled Potter's face down so they would be almost level, though he still had to tilt his head back slightly. He took his right hand and placed it on Potter's sharp jaw and brought his face closer. Their lips were less than a centimetre apart, only just enough so they weren't touching. Draco looked at Potter through his eyelashes, red lips parted only just with Potter's warm breath ghosting over them. "Aren't I?" He murmured so low he was sure Potter only just heard it. Then he took a step back, dropped his arms and walked away from Potter, swaying his hips.
Draco looked at her. He had taken to tuning out Pansy's insistent babbling. He had better things to do than listen to her complain about her make-up. "No."

"No shit." Draco rolled his eyes.
He continued to touch himself for a while before he heard the bedroom door close loudly. He snapped his head to the door and placed his hands by his sides on the mattress. He saw Potter walk towards him slowly, a smirk playing on his lips. Draco's breath came out in quick puffs as Potter got closer to him. He felt his cock throb in his pants and blush rise to his cheeks. Potter's smirk grew at the sight. Draco opened his mouth to say something but all that came out was a small, broken moan.
As soon as Pansy entered the empty dormitory, she burst into hysterical laughter. Draco shot a glare her way. She was shaking her head laughing, leaning against Blaise's bed post.
Draco turned to dance with a group of seventh year slytherins while he waited for Pansy to return. As he made his way to the group, he felt strong hands on his hips pull him back. His back pressed against the person's hard, muscled chest and he felt the person's breath blow softly against his exposed neck, goosebumps rising as while Draco shivered. The body was warm, and the scent unmistakable.
"Are you finished?" He asked when she took her hand away.
"Then I guess I'll just wear my normal robes then." He shrugged.
"So? His clothes are amazing, if I say so myself."
Draco was glad for the change of topic, "I don't know." He replied. "Is there a dress code?"
"I'm not wearing a fucking dress, Pansy." He said angrily.
"Shut up." He snapped at her.
"Right. This is what I think you might like." She said to him. She picked up a pair of black jeans and handed them to him. "Put these on first."
"To be quite honest with you," Blaise said, taking a drink from his own cup. "I think Potter will ignore the formalities and fuck Draco against a bloody wall, the way he's looking at him now."
Draco glared at them, feeling the blush rise to his cheeks. "Will you stop talking about Potter fucking me, or raping me, against a wall, please?" He crossed his arms, still glaring at them. Blaise and Pansy laughed.
Pansy shrugged, "I didn't choose the venue." She said. "So? Will you come?"
"Fine, whatever." Blaise's hideous - they weren't hideous, but he wouldn't admit that to anyone - clothes it was. Blaise was stylish, everybody knew that, but he didn't really know if any of Blaise's clothes would fit him. He was smaller than Blaise, obviously. He could pair it with some of his clothes, it couldn't be too bad, Draco thought.
"Sod off, Pansy." He said, although he did secretly wish that Potter would look at his arse tonight, though he would not say it out loud.
He pulled on the black, skinny jeans and did up the button and fly. The jeans, high-waisted, fit him perfectly. He walked to the mirror and looked at his reflection. He liked it, the way it fit against every curve of his body. It looked good.
Rolling his eyes, Draco agreed..
Draco parted his lips to reply only to have Potter's thumb rub softly across his bottom lip. He stared into Potter's green eyes, having to tilt his head back a fraction. The green eyes were bright, filled with what Draco thought looked a lot like desire. The thumb on his lips ventured past his lips and into the wet heat of his mouth. Potter hummed. Draco felt his cheeks blush, bright red. "So pretty." He said and Draco felt as though he was floating. He couldn't think straight. He unthinkingly closed his mouth around Potter's thumb and gave a gentle, barely there suck. He kept his eyes on Potter's the whole time, not missing the way his pupils dilated. He brought his tongue and gently caressed the tip of his thumb slowly. "So very pretty." Potter said again, his voice sounded deeper if that was possible. Draco made a small noise as Potter brought his other hand to Draco's hip, rubbing small circles against the fabric of Pansy's jeans, his skin tingling with every small caress of Harry's gentle hands.
"I'm going to get more drinks." Pansy said after a while. She took the plastic cup from his hand then turned to leave. "Wait for me here."
"Draco?" Draco snapped out of thoughts and fixed his eyes on Pansy again. "Did you hear anything I just said?"
Draco stared at Potter's retreating figure as he made his way out of the door, feeling cold. Draco let out a long breath and blinked a few times. He could still smell Potter's musky scent and he still heard his deep voice echoing in his head, '
I'm back babes. It's been quite a bit sorry for the wait i got caught up in other things. I do apologize for my irresponsibility. As per usual if you find any mistakes or anything do leave a comment, it would be much appreciated.
Draco stared at Blaise and Pansy snorted. "I wouldn't be surprised." She said while running a hand through her hair and looking back to where Potter stood, still staring at him. "But I don't think our saviour would rape anyone. Even if it is Draco. Also, Draco wouldn't mind being fucked into a wall by Potter."
"He wears muggle clothes." Draco said.
"Your clothes are all too formal, so they won't work. Blaise's shit doesn't fit you, neither does any of the other guy's. And Balise said we weren't allowed to shrink his clothes." Pansy said, tapping her fingers on her chin in thought. She thought for a few more seconds, while Draco stared at her with a raised eyebrow.
Draco stared at Pansy, he had just finished telling her what had happened in the dormitories with Potter. Pansy had sat in front of him with an ever growing smirk plastered on her face which nearing the end was bordering on insane, Draco believed that insanity had been reached at her previous statement, how could any of that mean fun? "Fun?" He voiced his confusion, feeling nervous as he noticed Pansy's manic eyes glint with mischief.
There was a knock on the door to the dormitory. "Yes?" He asked.
Pansy sighed. Draco turned to her again, "It's not like I stalk him."
They walked out the door, their arms looped and smirks tugging at their lips.
"Draco." Pansy looked at him. "Don't be so boring."
Draco nodded and Harry raised his eyebrows. "Yes, Harry." He breathed feebly.
The music, mixed with the endless chatter from the party goers, made Draco's head pound. He sipped on his Firewhiskey again, "Let's go dance?" He said to Pansy.
Blaise chuckled. "True, true."
"Yes." Draco breathed out and Potter squeezed his hip.
"Draco?" Pansy's voice replied.
He glared at Pansy. "Potter did not leave me with a-"
"Aren't we already?" Draco tried weakly, his voice hoarse and high pitched. Potter chuckled quietly in his ear.
"I'm not going to be the only one to agree with you there, Draco." She said with a little smirk on her face. "I think Potter might have a fit."
"Good." Pansy beamed. "Potter'll be there." She said after a while.
"P-Potter." Draco said, his voice cracking. Potter's hand stilled as he looked at Draco, fire blazing in his eyes. Draco bit his lip, Potter's intense gaze intimidating him. He looked away, embarrassed at the blush the painted his cheeks. Draco focused on his breath. Potter's hand squeezed his thigh lightly.
Potter placed his hand on Draco's bare knee. Gasping, Draco clenched onto his bed sheets. He looked at Potter through his lashes and bit his lip.
"Yes he did." Pansy cut him off. "Point is, hun, you're going to play his game. You're going to make him beg you for your cock, though I do believe the one begging is going to be you, you're going to make him want it so much he'll cry. Hell be pulling his cock three times a day when you give what he's playing for."
Draco nodded and sat back down on the bed. He looked at the shirts that were laid out on the bed. There were button ups and regular t-shirts. A dark green, silk button up caught his eye. He picked it up and looked at it properly. It had black buttons and a small pocket on front with a black silhouette of a snake. The collar also had snakes curling around it in black. It was soft to touch, and flowed like water on his fingers. It contrasted nicely with his pale skin, he thought, and the dark colour brought out the grey of his eyes. "This one, I think."
Draco blanched, “You mean, you can understand what happens when the diary isn’t being written in?”
“Must not be that hilarious if I haven’t even heard of him,” Draco sneered.
“Perplexed, are we?” A voice rose from the darkness. Draco bristled, but wasn’t all that surprised. He hadn’t forgotten what he was meant to be doing; even if the dazed state had left him a tad bit unfocused.
Dumbledore’s brows tightened, and a thin frown became noticeable. He was stern when he spoke, “You’ll find, Mr. Malfoy, that I do, in fact, know you are quite innocent. And, furthermore, I can prove your innocence.”
“Crabbe, Goyle, let’s go.”
Once Snape had gone, and the door was closed behind him, Draco let the darkness fall over him completely. Somehow, he made it to his bed. Somehow, he pulled the covers over himself, and let himself sink into the plush pillow and mattress. Somehow, his mind quieted enough to let himself sleep. Somehow, he knew this was only the beginning.
Ronald Weasley grew red and started toward Draco before Granger and Potter grabbed the back of his shirt and held him back. Draco stepped back a little in surprise. He thought he heard someone calling out for the red headed boy, but he couldn't be sure because his hand started to get warm, then excruciatingly hot. Had he been jinxed? He looked down at his hand and the ring he wore was starting to lightly shine. And not the way it had when it was in the sunlight either.
‘I suppose I was pushing that a bit much- even if I wasn't trying to be suspicious,’ Draco thought. As everyone stared blankly at him he finally let out a long sigh and said, “Alright fine. I wasn’t deflecting, but yes. Ginevra Weasley was in Potter’s compartment yesterday.”
“Yes. But I, ah, I’m still working on it.” Draco looked down in embarrassment; he should’ve found something already. He gripped the book tighter and calmed himself. He couldn’t show his shame- his weakness- to his father.
When Draco stepped near Snape, the older male laid a gentle hand on his shoulder and guided him towards the fireplace. The two uttered quiet goodbyes to the headmaster as they stepped in the furnace and flooed away.
He never imagined a phoenix would heal him. Would do so willingly, with complete care as Fawkes had done. A phoenix would only heal you if it wanted to- even if their familiars wished for them to heal someone, they could choose to not comply. And if they did comply, they could certainly be hasty about it. When a phoenix rushed the healing process, the tears felt scalding- making things much worse before they could get better. Yet Fawkes had been kind about it.
Draco’s mouth felt dry. Severus was right. His father would never order Draco to harm his academic or social careers; even if he requested he work on a side project, he wouldn’t expect Draco to put it above his other priorities. ‘But...hasn’t he done exactly that this year?’ Draco’s mind countered.
‘Family first.’
Mclaggen looked like he wanted to protest, but he just threw a sharp glare at the Slytherins and Fred Weasley before lumbering out of the corridor. “Come on Ginny. George is expecting us in the common room. Ron will be there by then as well, I’d expect,” Fred said as he laid an arm over his sister's shoulders and steered her out of the corridor.
Lucius turned to his son and started to address him before he was cut off by Arthur Weasley. “It’s too crowded in here, let’s go outside,” Arthur said, appearing calm and jovial. That was..before he’d seen Lucius Malfoy. He quickly fell pale and stood up straighter, meeting the other man’s eyes with a look of suspicion.
Draco lightly snickered, what sort of nonsense was this? Fate, time? Sounds absurd. Laughable even. However, as Draco looked at the ring closely he couldn't help but feel enticed by the possibility of “changing the future,” whatever that truly entailed. He had always been fascinated by Time Turners, so it would make sense that this object piqued his interest, he mused.
Lucius calmed himself slightly, he wasn’t acting as he should for this situation. It was unbecoming to let his temper get as out of hand as it had. As he met his son’s gaze he hardened his features and stood taller, letting his robes billow about him with the force of his movements. His magic cracked around both him and his son, as it usually did when he was particularly incensed but didn’t want to portray it with his features. “Do you know what you’ve done?”
Draco wouldn’t say they were friends exactly, but he didn’t bother correcting the Dark Lord’s former self. “So, are we in the diary then?” Draco couldn't imagine where else they would be.
‘Trust me. It all comes back to trust, doesn’t it?’
Sure, his dorm mates knew about it- but he wanted to avoid questions. And, out of sight out of mind- right?
“You’d be correct,” Pansy said with a small smile.
He felt awful. He was exhausted even after seemingly sleeping, or being knocked out, or whatever had left him unconscious. And his body felt immense fatigue. Not to mention his head was pounding, and his muscles ached.
As he took things in he was acutely aware of a shelf full of sparkling rings- one in particular catching his eye. The ring was...older, with a silver band and a vivid blue stone in its center. It looked to have ancient markings etched into the stone, and Draco stepped forwards to get a better look at the artifact before his father's cane lightly pushed against his foot, causing Draco to avert his attention back to his father's cold gaze. “Touch nothing Draco,” Lucius said in an icy tone.
Opening his eyes slowly, Draco blinked wearily. He kept fluttering his eyes, subtly aware of his surroundings. Things were blurred though, and noises muffled. A serene smile lifted the corners of his lips. It was quiet. His heart, his breath, his body. It was tranquil.
“Patience Blaize. Silence peaks others' interest you know.” With a glare from both Blaise and Daphne Greengrass, Pansy gave an exasperated sigh and continued. “Anyways, apparently Potter and Weasley couldn’t get past Platform 9 ¾’s barrier . So, they drove one of Arthur Weasley’s enchanted muggle cars to Hogwarts instead.”
Draco winced; he hadn’t meant to be so blunt, but it was all he had the energy for, apparently. And yet, his headmaster had the gall to sit there, looking at him quietly. This was the point where Draco should be shouted at- called vile, and monstrous- but no. No, instead, Dumbledore watched him with an air of confusion. When Draco noticed the oncoming shift in Dumbledore’s demeanor he prepared himself for the expected...but that never came.
The pain he’d felt vanished quickly, leaving him feeling numb and tired. But, as he took in the scene before him, his weakness was quickly replaced with horror. His father had had the luck of moving away just before the rest of the books from the cart came crashing down- the Weasleys weren’t so lucky. They were surrounded by books, many of which had dropped to their knees and put their hands above their heads to shield themselves from the impact. Hermione and Mrs. Weasley (who had come scurrying over as soon as things went awry) had instead taken out their wands and were levitating some books away from themselves and the others.
Emerald green eyes flooded Draco's vision as he met Potter's gaze. He instantly cleared his expression and took in the raven haired boy’s appearance. He looked slightly taller than last year, but aside from that not much had changed. When he looked back up at Potter he realized the other boy had been giving him a curious glance, like he was some puzzle he couldn't figure out. Draco frowned at that, Potter was supposed to look at him with anger, disgust, hatred. Not...whatever this was.
Draco turned back to his book. He would pretend to be reading rather than paying his full attention to her. “I "am" doing research for my father. And I brought the required books with me already.”
But Draco was different. He was this way because he had to be. And he didn’t mind it too much. Why would he even dream about a reality where he could be completely carefree when it would never be possible? He didn’t mind his situation. If he didn’t give thought to fantasies, he could adapt.
“Now, I said you had to prove you aren’t a coward, didn’t I? Unfortunately, honesty won’t allow for a test of courage. I have a task for you, one you won’t enjoy. But if you can manage it- and ask no questions afterwards- you’ll have passed.”
Draco nodded numbly. He didn’t hear the rest of Daphne’s words, but he did put on a false grin and excessively thank both girls at the end of her tirade. Once they left, Draco turned to the diary in front of him. He was back to square one. And worse, he’d already told his father that he’d given the diary away.
Reason 1, he didn’t want this diary any longer. It was too much trouble. Reason 2, his father gave him specific instructions, and Draco wasn’t about to disappoint.
Draco stuttered, his face still a furious red from the embarrassment and shame he felt. He was trying to get his mouth to move, so he could say something- anything- to justify his actions or calm his father. But his throat was closed, and he couldn’t bring himself to calm down enough to focus on a sentence. He hadn’t seen his father this angry in years, and the anger certainly wasn’t aimed at him last time.
Once he was ready everyone left to get breakfast. The girls were at the table already, and Blaise didn’t hesitate to fill them in on Draco’s mistake. Draco acted bothered by it, but really it gave him an excellent excuse to stay out of the morning’s conversation. He was still tired, and he felt sick.
“Mother, I- thank you. Thank you for reassuring me, it’s appreciated,” Draco said with a nod. He had been about to counteract his mother's statements, but she just wouldn’t get it. She would always be biased. Because she was his mother.
“That’s right. It was really strong magic,” Goyle agreed. Now, Blaise, Pansy and Astoria were looking at him too. And based on everyone’s narrowed eyes, Draco knew he couldn’t get out of this one.
“Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,” said Mr. Borgin. He then looked over and Draco, who quickly hid his look of slight disgust and instead settled for the best smile he could manage. ‘I never thought anyone could appear greasier than Snape, but I suppose there was always that possibility,’ Draco thought as he took in Mr. Borgins appearance.
Last year Pansy’s owl had died, and she was very upset. Draco offered his condolences, but otherwise just felt uncomfortable and awkward around the crying girl. He remembered the other Slytherin’s comforting her in their own ways. Theodore had talked with her, and Millicent and Daphne rushed off to the kitchens to procure some hot cocoa. Blaise just let Pansy hug him, and he quietly consoled her while she gave hiccuped responses to Theodore.
Astoria was behind her, he noted. “Draco, you owe my sister a massive favor,” Daphne smiled. Draco looked at her inquiringly, then turned to look at Astoria who was smiling shyly.
‘No. This is of the utmost importance. It’s different in that way, because my family’s future is reliant on this task,’ Draco tried to reason with himself. He couldn”t help but think that his academics and social life was the key to "his" future though, and that his father would want to respect his life too- not just his legacy. ‘He doesn’t even know I’m writing in the diary anyway,’ he added as an afterthought.
Harry said nothing ore about what happened. He wept until he fell asleep and it was only then that Severus left him. He pulled the curtain tightly around the cot and stepped out to face Hermione, Neville, and Ginny Weasley.
The blond trailed off and Harry turned to see that Draco's face had turned a delicate shade of pink.
"You're right and I was jumping to conclusions and I should have waited to hear what you were saying before I-"
The thin reedy sound of a baby crying bled through the speaker on the coffee table, and Piper looked torn between Wyatt in his crib and the unconscious boy on her couch, so Paige stepped in, "I'll watch Draco and Blaise. You go check on Wyatt."
"I'm sorry. I got a little thrown when you showed up earlier. I'm Alex-Xander, and you're Paige, right?"
Spike offered to slap the blond into his senses, but Paige pushed him away. The threat seemed to be enough as Draco shook his head and stood.
At Hermione's words Harry smirked at Draco, but the blond just smiled and pushed his arm away, walking over to the snack table.
But Xander's club? Draco knew exactly where that was.
His camera, a muggle Nikon, had been a gift from his mother, and his work with it sparked his interest in potions. He got a teacher in his primary school to teach him how to develop his own film and the idea that chemicals could turn plain white paper into the faces of his family and the children he went to school with caught his imagination.
A voice came from the opposite doorway, "It's about time, my Lord, beggin' your pardon."
"May I have my clothes now?"
"My boyfriend died. I had to leave, there were too many memories. He always wanted to come to the US . He had this stupid romantic plan to drive across country."
At the word 'Dragon' Harry focused.
Blaise threw open the kitchen door and Paige stormed through, keeping him behind her in case the demon attacked.
Harry dodged several curses, absently noticing that they seemed weak. As he looked around he saw that there were fewer fighters on the field from either side than he had expected and the fighting was not as fierce as it should have been. He knew why his side was depleted. The destruction of the wards of Hogwarts had injured a number of soldiers and sent many others to help the wounded and shore up the castle's defenses, but as Harry watched he saw several Death Eaters fall to the ground, no curse having touched them.
Struggling to rise, he drove an elbow into the black robed form of Draco Malfoy pressing him into the earth.
Severus stood and walked to the sideboard, very much needing that drink. As he uncorked the crystal decanter and caught the scent of the mucky amber within, he tried to collect his thoughts.
"Gods Draco, twice? Are you coming on to me?" Harry nudged the boy with his elbow again, but except for a slight shudder, the Slytherin didn't respond. "Draco?"
The boy's voice broke on the last words and just like that the tears came.
"Now, now, love. That ain't polite."
Looking at the mirror for the first time since he entered the bathroom, Draco saw the stains echoed around his nose and mouth, and dark patches appeared in his hair around his ears.
"Yes, you like boys and girls. And your favorite type of girl has a penis. Draco Malfoy, you are a flaming homosexual."
Draco looked alert and healthy and if she hadn't seen it for herself she would never believe that just twelve hours ago he was having seizures.
The red head went on, "For Merlin's sakes, we caught you trying on Ginny's new denims."
After a few minutes Harry cleared his throat roughly, hoping that would stop the two men, and it worked at they both pulled away from the kiss, lips swollen and red and eyes glazed.
"What," Phoebe asked, having collected herself, "we already have a whitelighter, right? Chris? Chris!"
When he was discovered as a spy for the Light he came closer to death than ever before in his life, so close that the darkness was one breath away.
And there were more obscene hand gestures.
Together, Paige, Piper, Ron, Chris, Jamie, and Wyatt took off. They took two cars and a picnic basket, planning to make a day of it.
"You're not going down there without me, buddy."
"We know who you are. Now, what are your intentions towards our little Dragon?"
Paige looked up, eyes wide. "He's using it."
Inside they saw Harry standing in the doorway and Piper was at the fridge.
"Bullshit," Harry stated, his wand held in a firm grip and pointed straight at the heart of the laughing one-eyed man.
Her happiness at seeing him was short-lived when she saw Harry in the older man's wake.
The woman, as the silhouette made abundantly clear, walked in and as Severus's eyes adjusted to the light he saw that it was Paige.
Severus said nothing, knowing Harry would talk himself out eventually.
Paige shook her head. "I'm just worried about the others."
Severus sighed. "Yes, Chris and I had quite the discussion after we found Potter. Whitelighters and their charges are always linked together, even if the whitelighter moves on to another charge. It's something in the manner of an emergency alarm. If the charge is ever in a situation they and their current whitelighter can't handle, the old whitelighters are called to assist."
Unfortunately, there had been three undercover assignments in the last month alone, and for whatever reason, Harry always got stuck wearing the silly outfits.
Since Draco and Harry had gone, Snape had spent too many nights alone in these rooms, and the silence was becoming comforting. All he had in mind was his chair, his brandy, and a raging fire.
Regaining his strength, he resolved to care for the child, but he could not look upon him without knowing the cost. He named the child, Draco, after his wife's favorite constellation, and assigned him the nurse as a nanny with Snape to teach him later. Sending them off to an unused wing of the castle, he returned to his rooms and locked himself in with bottles of fire whiskey and his grief.
After a few seconds of silence Draco looked up and paled, moving away from Paige until he was sitting alone on the rug.
He felt a lightening in his chest and moved a little faster, but as a thatch of blond hair came into view Severus found Harry outstripping him.
Severus, suddenly feeling older than he ever had before, rubbed his eyes with his arm, his hands still damp with the succulent flesh of aloe before turning his attention back to the bubbling cauldron in front of him.
The first time he saw the picture he threw it away from him and collapsed to the ground. Lily and James had been dead for six months and it felt like some sort of cruel prank, the kind he could ascribe to the mutt if he weren't already in Azkaban.
"I know, love. But it will be better soon. Now let's get you out of here."
Harry turned,
Spike's voice broke the tension of the moment and the room dissolved into giggles.
Paige looked from Piper to Phoebe as the middle sister nodded, looking confused.
She caught Severus looking at her, concern in his black eyes, but she waved him off. "Don't worry about me, what about the mommy-to-be here?"
One of the knobs began to shift and the gauge above it rose, even as Draco felt the pressure of eyes on him. He turned and saw that Harry, Voldemort, and a Death Eater were all staring at him, Harry looked horrified, but Voldemort was smiling and the air was thick with magical energy.
"And where is Spike," Draco asked.
Draco felt another laugh bubble up in his chest, but it was beaten out by a strange ringing noise. Looking around the kitchen Draco didn't see anything that could produce the noise, but it was getting louder, almost painfully so, the sound vibrating the delicate bones of his ear.
"I wonder who he'll end up with this time. I believe it was Blaise last time, and Pansy before that. Or was it Pansy
Taking a moment to wipe away tears of relief that Harry would blame on the dusty air, he walked over to the white lighter.
"No."
He took a few steps out, waiting for a break in the conversation the blond was having so he could jump out at him.
Paige felt a half smile lift the corner of her mouth. Piper had taken a motherly role with Spike, Draco, and Blaise, but the eldest Charmed One definitely got exasperated with the charming and feckless vampire.
"Harry! Duck!"
Harry's head was thumping and Voldemort's voice wasn't helping. Neither was the friendly act the man was putting on. "What are you doing, Tom? And we're on a first-name basis now?"
Harry had gathered a lot of information on those nights, but most of it was unrelated to the Dark Lord. There was a lot of muttering about Hell Mouths and Slayers, Charmed Ones, and some more about a 'Source', but no one said 'Voldemort' or even 'He Who Must Not be Named.' Even the most frightened hushed whispers concerned something called 'the First.'
Blaise was breathing heavily, but he managed to gasp out a few words. "Draco… Went to Potter… Idiot."
"Merlin, Harry, are you alright?"
With a husky whisper courtesy of the Weasley twins '
"I came to see if you had any letters or packages for anyone," the boy said before turning to
Severus couldn't fight back a shiver at the tone of Harry's voice. The sullen mourning phase had passed, but Severus couldn't help but wonder if this was worse.
Severus snorted. "Potter cannot make Draco happy. Potter can get Draco killed. You saw what happened yesterday, and they are over three hundred miles separated. In the same room they would tear each other apart."
"Some strange guy shot at Harry with a crossbow. Draco pushed him out of the way, but he got hit. It's just a flesh wound though, so we think the bolt may have been poisoned."
The professor looked rather sad to be leaving and the man had taken Paige aside for a private farewell before they left
The rest of Chris's speech was nothing more than a buzz in Draco's ears. He knew where Harry was now. He'd sent them the potion after Ron got scratched, but he never really knew their location. Orbing required a very specific idea of where to go or, according to Severus, a very strong need to be wherever his charge was. His sense of where Harry was located, and quiet constant presence in the back of his head, wasn't strong enough to trust with his physical form. He'd sent the potion that way because it was the only way he could, hoping that it would be enough to get the vial there intact.
Harry was fascinated in spite of himself. Now the man was down to an eye patch and a Slytherin green thong.
He was met by silence, so he opened the door completely and walked into the room, kicking aside pieces of splintered wood and broken glass.
The figure shifted slowly, groaning. Grey eyes met Snape's own onyx pair, and a face, the face of a strangely familiar man, smiled gently.
Paige laughed. "And sometimes even that goes wrong. The last time I went to pick up my laundry I got attacked by a demon. It turned out they were using the place as a front for a black market magic shop. I had to find a whole new dry-cleaner."
He stepped forward.
Blaise grinned. "I knew it. Then what?"
The crowd parted and Draco found himself in front of Harry before he even thought to search for the green eyed prince.
Severus and the king came to a grand wooden door and Severus tapped the pass rhythm. When the door opened, Lucius gasped in shock. It was Narcissa.
Paige smiled. "Too late now, Mister. Now come get something to eat. If you don't Piper will have my head."
"There's no such thing Harry. That's just a fairy story my mum told you. Leave it be before it turns and eats you."
"Well, he's a white lighter, and dead, and he's still a kid, really, and-"
The blond sighed. "I'm Draco Malfoy." Then he paused, as if he was waiting for something. When none of the witches said anything, he went on, "I'm your new whitelighter."
And they were kissing again.
The woman bit her lip and looked down at the floor before meeting his eyes. "Can we talk? Outside?"
The Slytherin quirked a small smile at the sound, but it didn't reach his eyes. Harry though he saw tears form in the depths of the grey orbs, but as soon as they were spotted, they were brushed away and no trace of sorrow could be heard in the boy's voice as he replied.
"Ere, Your Majesty, who's this then?"
This was the final moment, the end of the fight.
"It's the weapon," Harry said, feeling a sick realization in his stomach. "Voldemort is using it and Severus is one of the batteries."
Draco's skin was pale and clear, so Harry figured Paige healed the bruise he left on the blond's cheek. He absently rubbed his knuckles, still sore from the force of the punch.
Severus let his eyes do the talking as he looked from the pile of wood shards to Harry and back again before returning to his seat on the cot.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry stared at Alex for a moment, weighing his options. They were finally starting to make headway in this location and leaving before they obtained the information they came for would negate their entire effort and set the war back months.
Quicker than Harry could grasp the man was up out of his chair at the desk and behind Harry, his hands placed on Harry's shoulders. He wasn't pressing hard, but Harry could feel the potential strength at the other man and let himself relax, dropping his arms to his side but keeping his eyes open for opportunities to get away.
They were now on day three and Blaise, who claimed he was ready to get up the day after the birth, was demanding that he be let go.
That startled a laugh out of Harry. "Yeah, I know what you mean. We spend so much time fighting monsters and casting spells that its kind of exciting to walk to the shops and get a curry."
Warm, honey scented breath brushed against Harry's cheek, distracting him for a moment, but his attention was caught by those few words.
The blond man just licked the skin she'd touched and winked at her.
Harry felt a hand settle on his shoulder, cold seeping through the thick fabric of his robe and shirt to the skin beneath. He turned and saw Draco Malfoy looking down on him with an almost kindly expression on his pale, pointed face.
Outside the storm was raging. The gentle mist he had felt had grown into howling winds and sharp streaks of lightning across the roiling sky.
Draco felt Harry's hands at the sides of his face, the other man speaking through tears, "You weathered the storm, love. So can I."
Draco sighed. There really as no escaping Blaise when he had his head around something and maybe talking about it out loud would help things make sense. The blond took a seat on the foot of the bed, leaning against the heavy cherry footboard.
The boy opened his mouth to say something, but Piper went on, "I know you're probably a hundred something years old, but you look young and I call 'em like I see 'em. Now, what's your name and what are you doing here?"
"Harry? Is that you?"
Remembering the wrath in Draco's voice and what Severus said about the two of them tearing each other apart, Paige nodded. "I'll take him back to the Manor, but it's only going to be a temporary solution. Can you handle things on this end?"
As he spoke, Piper seemed to shrink even further into her chair, "One job to another and he's here to be your white lighter, not your babysitter. And what does he get but glares and accusations."
Picking up his shoes again, the boy made his way out of the room and presumably, out of the dorm. Harry gave him until the count of ten before he picked up his cloak and left.
"I'm an angel."
Draco looked at the older woman, "What?"
Draco was smiling softly and Harry reached out his thumb to wipe away the trail of tears on the blond's cheek. When Harry's hand made contact, Draco closed his eyes and leaned into the caress, but when Harry pulled his hand away Draco opened his eyes and Harry froze, caught in the intensity of that gaze.
Paige stood in the doorway. Draco was sitting by his godfather's bed, the same place he'd been for the past week. The black-haired man was still unconscious, but most of the burns had healed.
Echoing the baby Blaise yawned as well and Paige stood up. "I think we should get you into a bed. It's been an extremely long day.
"I'm already dead," the blond joked, but the humor of his voice fell flat.
"At a Slytherin party? On a school night?" Hermione's stare promised nothing but bloody vengeance on the Irish boy, but Harry noted that her tone was surprisingly civil.
There was a bit more stuttering before Alex jumped in, "Dragon is Spike's nephew. He's been sick recently and we're worried about him. That's all."
Closing his eyes tightly, Draco moved back to the sink, washing his face again and again while trying not to think of the reason why. When he was convinced his skin was clean of the dried blood, he blindly reached out for a fresh towel from the stack on the vanity and wiped it dry.
As the Dark Lord raised his wand, the tip glowing an ominous green, the machine began to whine louder.
Draco nodded, too frightened to talk or look up into the chef's face.
"I would think you, of all people, would take this seriously. I mean, he is your neph—"
"Oh Draco, I'm sorry—"
Harry laughed, but the sound was hollow. "You sure know how to cheer a guy up, don't you?"
Visibly recovering himself, Draco went on, "I'm trying, godfather. I'm trying so hard. But Chris thinks I'm only there for the girls and he won't let me protect him. Then the girls think I'm a nuisance, except for Phoebe who thinks I'm there for her personal… amusement. The only people who treat me as an adult are Spike and Paige."
Severus saw tears begin to build in the young blond's eyes, and as he had never been able to stand crying by anyone, he took the first thing that grabbed his attention, hoping to distract Draco from his upset.
"Any convenient sewer lines here, love?"
Night had completely fallen by this time and the sky above the house was a beautiful deep blue.
He looked exactly the same.
"You are so fierce, my beloved? You would defend this traitor?"
When he finally stopped, he said, "I'm sorry."
"Yes," Severus said. "You were called, and somehow the call caused you pain, which it shouldn't have done according to Paige and Chris. You should have heard a loud alarm the way they did and gone galloping off to the Golden Boy's rescue. Unfortunately your 'gift' as it were, decided to interfere."
Draco wasted no time and orbed a spoon from the drawer under the counter. Wyatt giggled and clapped his hands as the trail of blue sparks moved back and forth across the room. To entertain the boy, Draco orbed himself a soda and a napkin as well.
Draco?"
He began again to weep, though he thought he had no tears left. "I do not want the child, if I must lose you. Why did you do this? I will be alone without you."
For a moment, Harry could swear he stopped breathing. The room got darker, but that may have been because the dancer was finished with his performance and the stage lights were off.
"No, I mean…," Paige saw tears build up in the brown eyes and looked for anyone who could help, but everyone had congregated around the black-haired man. The first tears fell as the boy said, "It's my fault. The accident. And now Severus is hurt, and the baby…," the boy trailed off as he gently rubbed his swollen belly. Paige looked closer and saw that the boy wasn't heavy all over, just his mid-section. He reminded her of Piper, when she was preg—
Draco wasn't on the front steps where the two of them had been earlier, and Harry only hoped the blond man hadn't left the castle. Digging the Marauder's Map out of his robes, he tapped it and waited for his lovers name to appear.
"The conversation is over, Draco. You can't go."
Eventually they managed to get through everything and though Blaise wasn't happy they had kept it all a secret, he said he understood. When Paige mentioned Harry, Blaise muttered something about 'Ron' and 'making him sorry.' Phoebe perked up at word of Blaise's fiancée, but the brown-haired boy refused to elaborate.
They had also mentioned a particularly lovely bottle of Firewhiskey secreted in the aforementioned classroom, and in the interests of diligence and watchfulness Draco followed to remove the bottle from the grasping hands of his fellow students by any means necessary.
The Manor felt tense when Paige got home. It wasn't a new sensation, considering they spent most of their time either fighting horrendous evil or recovering from it, but it was never pleasant to orb into.
Chris vanquished the darklighter and removed the bolt, healing Draco in the process, but the experience shook him.
"Wake up, blondie," Blaise shouted.
Naked and pale, soaked and shivering, Draco made his way onto the narrow balcony to wait out the storm.
That lost look returning to his eyes, Draco said, "I don't know. I got here, I wanted to go home, we were eating breakfast, and there was an accident in the lab. Sev tried to help, but he got caught. I was too late."
That didn't come.
Paige sighed, but she was still smiling. "You know, I have a first name, Severus."
"From what young Mr. Wesley told me, a man appeared out of a swarm of black with a crossbow aimed directly at you."
Draco shook his head, just a slight side to side motion. He was too tired for more.
"Those were demons."
And before anyone had the chance to say anything for good or ill the blond was gone.
Spike and Alex threw a few whistles and catcalls there way before returning to their semi-decent groping.
On the dawn of his eighteenth birthday he woke early to watch the sunrise. One year ago this day he fled the only home he'd ever known and he wondered now where his friends were, Severus and Pomphrey, whether they were alive. He kept them in his thoughts at all times and hoped they managed to escape his father's wrath. On that note he wondered how his father was. In the rush and terror of the king's sudden madness Draco never had the chance to get to know the man Pomphrey and Severus had befriended. They told him stories as he grew that gave his father the image of a hero, a brave and loving man who defended his family and subjects honorably. Draco mourned the loss of that man and hoped somehow Lucius would find peace.
Passing his beloved violin to his godfather, Harry stepped down from the musician's dais and towards the blond.
"My Lord are you well? A maid found you collapsed in the garden."
Draco felt the tugging before he heard her and looked down to see that Phoebe was still in his arms. He released the woman and watched her rush into the kitchen before he stepped forward to join Severus by the couch.
"Not so fast, Mister," the red head said. "We have some questions for you. And you'd better have some answers."
"No, you have to be here for me," Ron said again, and before Harry could respond his best friend gripped his hand tight and dragged him over to the couch where Blaise sat, half reclining against the cushion, sweating and panting.
She shuddered in disgust when he, with a low chuckle, licked the side of her neck.
Harry was cold in his arms, but there was no sign of injury or physical distress.
The grey-eyed boy, suddenly looking more alert than his condition would imply, looked at his godfather. "Harry? What?"
"This- these are for everyone. I have to go," he stumbled out, taking off his knapsack and throwing it at her before closing his eyes again and apparating back to Hogwarts.
Harry could see Hermione try to smile, but her eyes were damp. Neville's face stayed blank, the quiet boy wasn't offering an opinion.
Paige heard a dim ringing noise, like one of her charges was calling her. But she didn't have any individual charges at the moment so she wasn't sure where the source was. The sound seemed to get louder over a short period until she heard a piercing scream from the kitchen.
"What?"
A quiet snuffling sound drew his attention to the matching couch a few feet away and he saw Severus sleeping on the grey surface, a brightly colored afghan much like the one Draco had to push away, draped over the older man's torso.
Knowing the speaker wouldn't leave without an answer, Harry turned and his words got stuck in his throat.
"That's not all you are." Harry's voice was shaking.
Paige looked up from the picture and met his eyes, smiling widely. "You were a cutie, Severus Snape."
The man eyed Draco suspiciously, then his face cleared and he grinned widely. "Good job, Your Majesty. You have your mother's heart and no mistake."
Severus laughed roughly. "Madness indeed. Your father thinks to take you to wife."
Severus knew Harry was still upset about Draco, and a part of him understood. But he knew his godson and if things remained like this between Harry and Draco neither one of them would be at their best. Severus could tell Draco was in love with Harry, at least as far as the blond understood the emotion, but judging by the green-eyed boy's behavior he wondered if Draco's feelings weren't returned after all.
Paige volunteered to orb home and get the bags, it was the fastest way to get there and back and Jamie's face was getting redder and redder as the little boy screamed his discomfort to the world. Piper agreed and while she and Blaise took a seat on a well-shaded bench by the gate, Paige found a secluded alley and orbed out.
He felt very like his uncle Spike at times. Not alive, but not really dead. He only hoped he could hold on to his sanity the way Spike had, when the world was a hundred years older and he never changed.
As he walked he felt a strange weight hanging from his shoulders, but it was nothing compared to the weight in his arms, the precious burden he carried.
"Another day, another horrible, disgusting demon exploding all over me," Draco muttered as he swiped ineffectually at gobs of slime on his jeans.
"I can't really picture you as a teenager, Severus. I kind of imagined you being born the way you are now, over six feet of sarcastic sorcerer."
With a shimmering fall of light the brunette appeared, Phoebe at his side. Both were covered in a thin layer of green ooze and laughing.
The blond snorted softly into his hands.
Harry turned back to the pictures which showed a very pregnant Blaise posing in front of a bougainvillea bush in front of the manor.
Severus sank back down onto the couch, his fingers still pressed to the warm spot on his cheek.
"Draco? Are you alright?"
During what was supposed to be a regular demon hunt a darklighter snuck up on Chris. Draco knew his job as a whitelighter and he threw himself in from of the brunet feeling the painfully familiar sting of a crossbow bolt and then the unpleasant burn of poison.
Then she screamed.
Groaning he stood up, stretching the cramped muscles in his arms and legs. He tucked the pictures into his pants pocket and left the small storage room.
"Piper. Leave the kid alone. If he can't eat anymore, he can't eat anymore," Paige said, grabbing Chris's sleeve and pulling him behind her as she let go of Severus and moved closer to the food.
From the corner of her eye, she even saw Spike peering around the corner at the unfolding events.
"Sure, evil creatures always turn good, and they never fake it to get to us!"
"He didn't want to give me one. Said I needed to 'learn the consequences of my actions.' I think he's just pissed at who I got drunk with."
Paige heard Blaise mumble something behind her and the next thing she knew she was wearing a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt, her robe and pajamas gone. She turned to Blaise who just smirked.
"Why doesn't it matter," Piper asked in a matter-of-fact tone.
The long hallways that circled the ballroom were empty, most of the castle's inhabitants inside dancing or flirting in the few curtained off alcoves. Waiting until the room was truly full and the music playing loud and sweet, Draco entered, silently.
"The dark-haired guy, with the green eyes. He came in with Red and almost passed out. Seemed like kind of a chicken to me."
Smiling, Draco dropped the tiny thimble in the thick broth, hoping Harry would find it and like the gift.
"Apparently you care for him more than you know. According to Chris you picked up the pain he was feeling. You were trying to protect him from a distance as well so your body fought off even peripheral magic."
There was that cajoling tone in Harry's voice that Draco had gotten so used to. The same voice that persuaded him to speak of what had happened with Voldemort when he first landed on the door step of Grimmaud Place. That same tone had convinced the boy into good behavior, into friendship, into bed with the green-eyed boy.
"What are you lot looking at? He's sick or something."
The baby was on it's way.
"Oh my God. This is you?"
"Draco told him, or he felt it or something with his white lighter powers. I'm not sure"
"Great. Then we'll get along fine."
"Husband," the blond vampire corrected.
"What?" He knew his tone was brusque, but it was a reflex.
Paige thought about orbing to the club, or asking Harry is he could crack them there the way Severus had before, but she knew she needed time alone with the guy so she led the way to Piper's car and dragged the key out of her pocket.
Inside was a picture of Lily, holding baby Harry, still a pink and wrinkled newborn, and beaming at the camera.
Harry reentered the war effort with a zeal that no one had seen from him before. The raids by Order members were fiercer and the body counts on Voldemort's side rose.
Despite some promising leads their trip to America had been a bust and Harry's team was called back to Hogwarts. Ron was going to stay behind with Blaise and the baby at Harry's insistence, but Severus would return with them.
"It's that bad?"
After he told Blaise what happened the night before, the brunet having been told the events prior by Paige, Blaise demanded a 'photo shoot' so Ron could see their baby's progress.
Severus approached it slowly. He remembered the fit Harry threw after the loss of Sirius Black and he had no desire to be hit by flying crockery, but the room was silent so the man slowly eased the door open.
"No. We're still moving and I am not letting go."
Unable to completely ignore the man writhing in pain at his feet, Harry moved him further away from the battle and under the secure cover of some thick bushes. It might not be enough to protect him from the battle, but it was the best Harry could come up with in a hurry. He knew the man was a Death Eater, and as such had done horrible things in the name of an insane cause, but his punishment would come in the courts of the Wizarding World, not underfoot on a battleground when he was too weak to fight back.
The leather pants and silk shirt had been placed in a secret drawer at the bottom of Draco's trunk, along with a few select cosmetics and some salacious pictures, for the next time Harry felt like a makeover.
As Harry's hands pressed over Draco's broken ribs Draco flinched back.
Dragging Draco's abandoned robes up around both of them, Harry transfigured two couches into a large fireplace and held on to his love as tight as he could. He knew they had to get to the Infirmary, but right this minute, he had to get Draco warm enough to be moved.
Pausing, Draco answered Severus's questioning glance, "See, a 'chip' is a microchip, a muggle device, very advanced technology. It's a tiny bit of metal and plastic that is inserted into the brai—"
Halfway through the fight, Ron had conjured gold scarves for as many Order members as they could get to. Tied tight around an arm, they were the only way Harry could tell one black robed figure from another in the smoky haze of hexes that covered the field.
"What he does," Draco repeated. "He- he went off on his own, didn't he?" When the girl nodded, Draco swore. "That daft bastard. I knew it, I knew he would." Draco struggled up from his pallet on the floor, grasping Hermione's arm and the wall to help him get to his feet. "Where did he go?"
And for the second time in less than eight hours, Paige was confronted by another pale blond English guy. This one looked younger than the other, and softer, but there was something familiar about him, as though she'd seen him before.
Crossing her fingers and saying a quick prayer for any Good that was listening to protect her family, Paige orbed to the attic.
"Too late," a sleep rumpled Ron said from the hallway. "Blaise wants to come out here and join the party but I told him he has to rest for another day or two and he decided that if he can't party then no one can, now will you lot kindly clear off so he and James can get some sleep?"
The vampire cleared his throat loudly, and Paige dug a sharp elbow into his ribs as Severus turned around and she was confronted with that face.
"Harry Potter. I'm in love with Harry Potter." It was the first time he said it out loud and it took his breath away. Draco felt warm fingers on his chin, lifting his face, and he opened his eyes to see Shannon smiling at him.
"Make me one too, there's a love," a deep British voice sounded behind her. Turning, she saw a pale, white blond man dressed completely in black sitting on one of the high stools at the breakfast nook.
"How did you hear this? You got here the same time we did."
"Well. Anyway he's with Spike and his mate, in that club Xander owns. There's a really extensive apartment complex down there. I would have been back sooner, but I had to track down the rest of his team and make sure they know what's going on…"
The prince's mouth dropped open, along with most of his advisors, but Draco felt only a hot rush of humiliation in his cheeks. Dropping the coal scuttle to the ground with a heavy crash he turned and ran out of the hall. His robe was heavy and the weight of it wrapped around his ankles. More concerned with getting away than being discovered, Draco released he clasp and let it fall to the ground, exposing the shining suit.
Everyone was gathered in the living room with the exception of Ron, Blaise, and the baby.
The food went out and Draco peered into the hall from a little used side doorway. He saw Harry and Ron and the lords and ladies of Gryffindor eat and drink in good cheer and his heart ached. They were more than master and vassals, they were friends and Draco didn't understand such a thing. He had never known anyone he could consider a friend. Pomphrey was like his grandmother, and Severus was family. No one else was ever around him long enough to know.
Severus took a deep breath and stepped closer to the witch, pressing his lips to hers and swallowing the rest of the fumbled sentence.
"Paige. Take me to them."
Severus looked to Harry and the boy nodded. Together they walked the halls of Hogwarts in silence.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Draco? Man, get in here now or your ass is mine."
The Dark Lord held up his wand and Harry felt the hot sizzle of a cutting curse run across his chest, opening up his shirt and the skin beneath, but his momentum kept him moving forward and he fell on Voldemort, knocking him to the ground.
"Chris, knock it off."
Severus smirked slightly, "They didn't fall at your feet?"
Draco's voice broke into the moment. "If you two are done, I would like to continue the conversation I was having with my godfather."
Behind her, a quiet voice came, "Is he okay?"
And with that he was on the bed next to the older man, his hands burning blue light against Snape's arm where the black snake and skull of the Dark Mark throbbed and writhed under Severus's skin.
"Tomorrow, I think. I told Hermione and a few others that I was going in case they want to get letters together, so I thought I would extend you the same courtesy."
Tried and failed as his muscles gave a lurch and then all he could do was scramble to his knees and throw himself at the toilet.
Paige didn't want to cry, but seeing him there so small, and now knowing how old he truly was, all she saw was a little boy, a very scared, very sad boy. And as tears began to trace the white cheeks, she bit the inside of her cheek to keep herself from crying.
After a few seconds Paige noticed that everyone was silent. Blaise had stopped screaming and Phoebe was no longer cheering him on. She looked up and saw that Severus was staring from the baby in her arms to her face and back again. She opened her mouth to ask him if everything was okay when she was cut off by the thin wail of the newborn and in that moment she saw a bright sad light in the potion's master's black eyes.
Opening his eyes again he saw the familiar pictures on the walls, and he could just hear Draco's voice.
Severus followed the cue and conjured a small circle of silence around them. The air shimmered briefly as the shield settled into place.
"Our babe is coming, my love."
It wasn't a question, but Harry answered anyway. "Have to. It's my duty."
Harry narrowed his eyes before turning back to Draco, still wrapped in the bear's skin and half-covered in mud.
"Draco? You talk to him?"
Piper quirked an eyebrow at her sister before turning to Severus. "Are you hungry? It's been a long day and I'm sure you could use something to eat."
Hours later Lucius woke in his bed, the heavy weight of grief on his chest as he wept. He had lost her again, it was a beautiful horrible dream.
Unfortunately he was not quiet enough as well-manicured nails pinched down on the thin cartilage of his ear, now decorated with two silver rings.
Throwing the blanket to the side, Snape rose and swept his godson into his arms. He'd never been much for physical affection, something in short supply throughout his own childhood, but he'd tried to let Draco know he cared over the years and he felt this occasion warranted something more than a warm handshake.
She heard Draco gulp loudly. "I'll just go- I mean, I can get Ron. He should be here, eh?"
Blaise nodded.
But as Draco began convulsing, Harry only had eyes for him.
The man muttered something about 'Brits' and turned around.
Though Blaise was known for his 'friendliness' he was a good bloke and he and Ron might even be happy together. The two had been sniffing around each other for years, but giving in to pale substitutes until now. Harry wondered how they had finally gotten together.
The first thing he saw as he stepped out into the club were three very angry faces.
"I'll leave as soon as the sun sets," the man said, turning to go back downstairs as the voices came closer.
Only the witch's restraining hand seemed to be enough to keep the boy back from the exuberant hug he wanted to give to Severus, and for that the older man was thankful. He was feeling better, but he didn't think he was up to a glomping just yet.
Severus pulled his hand away and Paige was half tempted to follow it before shaking her head, taking a deep breath, and focusing on her orange again.
When they arrived, Paige felt a cold hand grip her arm again.
He grabbed Neville and Hermione away from their rescue efforts. "I have to go out there. He's not going to stop and we won't survive another hit like this." The two of them nodded, then Neville looked around sharply.
Flaming chunks of stone were flying through the air, now choked with dust and ringing with screams. Harry struggled to his feet and looked at the carnage around him. Piles of rock littered the floor of the Great Hall and Harry could barely see the other teams through the gritty air. He looked down and saw Hermione under a table. He pulled her free and when he was satisfied that she was uninjured, the two of them went to work getting the other team leaders up.
Not looking at Paige, or Wyatt, or much of anything, he said, "It's for the best anyway, it didn't really matter."
After Severus rejoined the table, Draco heard him mumble something.
Paige looked at Phoebe for an answer, but the middle sister had her head resting on her hands and didn't look like she wanted to talk again any time soon.
She nodded her head. "The guards will release Severus at midnight. He knows where to go, and your exit is prepared.
After a few moments that felt like eternity he pulled away to see her looking up at him, her eyes glittering in the starlight and her cheeks pink. "So I guess that's a yes, huh?"
"Spike told me about you, and about what's going on at your house," Xander said, looking from Paige to Draco and back again. "I have some connections so the British situation isn't completely news to me. If we'd known Draco was coming we could have called you guys, or kept Harry hidden away or someth—"
He heard the music before he saw anyone, a deep and pounding dance bet and as he approached the first floor he saw Granger, Longbottom, Alexander and Spike had joined everyone and they were mingling and dancing.
And so Harry entered now, using the key Snape had given him months ago, and waited for the dead boy.
None of the others knew Draco had sent the potion, and Harry didn't want to tell them. After the Prophecy and his sexuality were published in The Daily Prophet on the same day, he didn't have a lot of secrets left, and Draco was the biggest one.
Harry felt warm hands settle on his hips then move slowly over the back of his shirt. He heard Draco hiss softly as the blonds' hands caressed aubergine silk clad muscle.
"Okay, Draco are you going to get the others, or shall I," Chris asked.
Harry helped the boy to his feet and led him to the Room of Requirement, picturing cool sheets and a fresh pot of coffee, "Maybe later, love."
He closed the photo album quickly, but not fast enough as Paige's fingers, mails painted vivid green, caressed the black leather cover.
She moved towards Harry and he flinched from her outstretched hand.
Severus nodded sharply. "I know what I'm doing and if you follow my directions they will both be fine. Now, please- It's time."
Each year he had forced himself to be harder, crueler, than the year before, in the hopes that it would hurt less when these bright eyed children died for such a cause.
Draco nodded, wrapped his arms around the witch and orbed the both of them to the living room.
"You know I don't believe you, right?"
It was a miracle that Draco had survived the exposure, barely breathing and with only a slight, soft heartbeat, he had developed severe pneumonia in the Infirmary, tossing in fever and nightmare for days.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer- (as it pertains at this point.) Spike, or William the Bloody, is a vampire. In his quest to destroy the Slayer, a teen age girl given the responsibility to destroy vampire and protect humanity, he was captured by a government organization called the Initiative. The Initiative experimented on vampires and demons and implanted a chip into Spike which would cause a painful electric shock if he attacked a human being.
Severus could see a deep exhaustion in Harry's eyes, and lines of strain crossed the boy's face. "Are you well?" It was the only think Severus could think of to say.
Then Harry introduced his tongue to the kiss and Draco closed his eyes.
Paige watched as the boy, now openly weeping, slowly knelt on the floor, pressing his face as close to the stones as he could, belly impeding his progress.
"Oh, no, Mr. Potter. You are more than enough for me—," the rest of the remark was broken off by a gusty yawn. Opening his eyes and pulling himself up to the couch proper, Harry looked at his boyfriend properly for the first time.
Piper had come in at one point and taken Blaise's free hand so Paige went to Severus's side where he crouched between Blaise's spread legs.
Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Draco waved him into silence. There was no time for this, for argument. Battle was coming. This attack on the great hall, on Hogwarts, was the most audacious move the Dark Lord had ever made. With the weapon in his possession, this was the time to strike.
Harry grinned and followed the blond towards the Great Hall as the walls of Hogwarts shuddered around them.
"Well, what did you expect, elves? It's liquor, not cookies. Anyway, the only way you can have a proper opinion of muggle alcohol is to try some."
"I'm sorry," he said, moving until his back was against the wall, "I wanted to meet all of you and introduce myself, but this is clearly a bad time. I'll come back later, shall I?"
"You don't think… I mean… But they're- it's Severus." Harry's thoughts were frantically scrabbling away from the image of his potions professor engaged in coitus.
It was on one of the all-human nights that Harry had gotten his first clue about the Dark Lord's movements in America .
Snape watched as Draco turned his eyes away, brushing Snape's hands off of his shoulders, "This is as much as I can have, Severus. They only aged me to where I would have been at eighteen. I'll never grow any more than this, any taller, any older."
"God, Draco. I just-" Harry scooted over, closer to the blond and laid his arm over Draco's shoulders. "I'm bollixing all of this up, aren't I?"
When he woke up everything hurt and he didn't know where he was.
Harry smiled as the scantily clad waiter came over, pulling a scratch pad and pen from some invisible pocket in his almost nonexistent uniform, but inside he was worried. They were still at war, and every day the wizarding population in Britain and worldwide got smaller. Voldemort and his Death Eaters were becoming bolder and no matter how happy he was for his friend, knowing how much the red head had despaired of ever starting a family once he realized he was gay, he was still afraid of what the future might hold.
"Me," Severus asked, unsure whether the red head was joking.
"So," Pansy said, nudging him heavily.
Light spilled across the room as the door opened, and a shadowy figure said in a strangely familiar voice, "What do you think you're doing?"
Chris looked up. "We have some problems right now. According to my demonic sources something big is coming. It might have to do with Wyatt or it might not, but it's too big to ignore."
"Harry, you look strange."
"Of course," Seamus scoffed, then grinned at his friend, "But if she doesn't ask, there's nothing to tell. Right, Harry?"
Draco felt the man approach and froze. Then he heard other footsteps and a feeling of anticipation filled the air around him.
"And how do you know, Mr. Malfoy? I can't imagine you sitting down in front of a pint."
It couldn't be Draco. There was no way the Slytherin would set foot in a Muggle strip club, Harry couldn't imagine it, so it had to be someone else. And yet, Draco knew where Harry was.
"I understand." Severus said.
The war had been over for a year, and on this, the anniversary of the Wizarding World's release from under the heavy boot of the Dark Lord, a ball had been thrown for the victors, the survivors.
"What's going on, Potter? I thought you wanted to do this," the Slytherin said.
"Oh yeah. Just my type."
"That was my husband, Spike."
"You have to come, Professor. You have to come!"
Chris sighed, "Now is not the time, Spike. Why are you here?"
Harry couldn't give a name to the voice. Over the past few hours it had gone from harsh and commanding to gentle and pleading, then back again, but the figure was always shrouded in deep shadows.
Spike took his hands off of his ears to perform a series of hand signs, telling Severus to shield Chris as the whitelighter orbed into the cave and grabbed Harry. Severus gestured back to see where the vampire would be and the blond man just grinned toothily before charging into the cave, the screams within becoming louder as a result.
And if the long war had taught him nothing, he knew that he could heal broken bones, but not broken hearts.
"So, you're the great Harry Potter, right? Pleased to meet you., I'm Chris. Well, pleased to be met, I guess. The last time I saw you, you were unconscious in the back room of a gay strip club."
Paige could see Phoebe leaning in to ask another question and she motioned her sister back.
He knew what was coming, the Dark Lord was a predictable evil. Draco had been struck by the Killing Curse once before and it took his life then. Now it would take away this ephemeral un-life he had been living, but maybe...
As the burns healed they left behind pale, smooth skin. With that, his dark hair, and the brooding personality Draco and Blaise said the man had, he sounded like any number of the men Paige had dated in her lifetime. Angsty loners with more problems than they knew what to do with had always been a specialty of hers.
"I am bisexual."
At this Alex turned to Spike and the two shared a meaningful look. The blond seemed abashed and his grin faded.
"Professor?"
"…Fifteen?"
"We—he needs some ice or something. Can you," she asked Severus and the man turned towards the kitchen.
The weapon.
"Draco, did anything happen when Harry came to California?"
Severus walked over and crouched down next to Paige where she was healing Draco's face. Absently admiring the shining blue light of white lighter healing, Severus mulled his answer. Both Draco and Paige were staring at him with the same puzzled look.
Finally, he was face to face with the man that had caused all of this chaos, and indeed, seemed to be thriving on it, as he was laughing out loud.
Draco closed his eyes and visualized the attic. Taking a deep breath he orbed and the next time he opened his eyes he was standing in the sunny room in front of the wooden stand that held up the Charmed One's Book of Shadows. Severus was standing next to it with a pen and notebook, writing things down while Phoebe turned the pages.
To put Leo's mind at ease, Draco went on, "My last charge was the sole hope of an army, a people. He has their entire world on his back and he, like Atlas, bears the burden well. Every day I fought monsters worse than demons, because they were human, and some of the most evil of them wore the faces of my family, my friends.
A few minutes after that Severus stood. "I'm afraid I have to leave now, but do try to prevent this happening again. I have better things to do than ride to your rescue."
Still it had been years since he got past the idea of taking it out on her son, so he walked over to the bed and settled next to the boy—no, man.
A few minutes later, before the grip of sleep became too tight, a sleepy mumble slid out into the dim and quiet room.
He began to pace up and down the small room, taking sharp turns at each corner and muttering under his breath.
"How much punch could it have? I mean, it's made by muggles, for Merlin's sake."
Draco took a deep breath, shuddering as it stuck on a sob. Shaking his head, he said, "I don't want a lifetime with Harry." That's all he could get out, the rest of his words were trapped in his throat.
"Phoebe! Put those eyes back in your head," Piper shouted, echoing Paige's thoughts. The boy turned, to see what the commotion was, and blushed lightly when he realized where Phoebe's attention had lain.
The baby shifted in his arms and Ron called everyone over to see his son smiling. Paige was pretty sure it was just gas, but she knew better than to say that to a new parent so she turned back to Harry who looked a little better.
Rising from the bed, Lucius gestured for his advisor to stand as well. "Lead me to him, Severus. Lead me to my son."
Chris flashed his small, smug smile at Draco. "Ready to go to the manor?"
"Maybe he should come to us. There are Mudbloods he—"
"I'm fine," the deep voiced man replied, "But that wasn't me."
"Wait," Paige said, cutting her sister off. "A cutie with green eyes? And he came here with Ron?"
"I don't know Harry. You've never been able to hold your liquor," Draco's voice bubbled with laughter, "I still remember that time you got all giggly after a few butterbeers, and I had to tell you they were non-alcoholic!"
Moving into the cool dim air of the hallway Draco leaned heavily against the wall. The house was silent other than the noises of Blaise in the bathroom and Draco tried very hard not to listen to that.
Harry had looked up from the table he'd been idly wiping down for the past few minutes and saw the woman staring right at him, her eyes dark from side to side, no tender iris or pupil to break the unending black..
Harry threw cutting curses and tripping hexes around along with anything else he could think of that would at least weaken the four Death Eaters. It was working and their attacks weakened, but it was still four against one and as Harry watched his shield flickered once, again, and then failed.
The light in Ron's eyes dimmed at that, but came back when Harry grinned, slapped him heartily on the back, and waved down a waiter, "This calls for a celebration, Ron! Champagne !"
She orbed directly into the kitchen and found Wyatt's diaper bag right where Piper said it would be, on the chair by the door. She moved towards the kitchen doorway, but then she heard Draco talking and froze. The blond sounded upset. Paige assumed he was talking to Harry and decided not to disturb him, instead orbing directly to Ron and Blaise's room where Jamie's diaper bag was on the foot of the bed.
Harry too was enraptured in the music he produced, his eyes closed and mouth pursed while his arms created the sound and his body swayed in rhythm.
The battle field was full of black-clad bodies from both sides of the fight. What had begun as a midnight guerilla mission into the heart of the Death Eater camp had stretched past the false dawn and into full morning light. At this point, all of the fighters were so tired that every curse, charm, or thrown potion was accompanied with the fervent hope that it had been aimed at an enemy, instead of an ally.
The next few weeks were a bright time for Lucius. He sent his secretaries to find every report Pomphrey and Severus had left for him and he learned everything he could about his son. The boy was as sweet-hearted as he seemed, and as intelligent as any father could wish. He was well-trained in politics and history, in court etiquette and warrior skills.
"Pretty strong smell, huh?"
Chris broke in with a more political answer. "Have you tried calling for Wyatt? He's half white-lighter, he might be able to orb to you. Meanwhile, you can have Phoebe scry for him."
"He was meeting with an informant. There was some kind of ambush and he staggered back to the room just a few minutes ago, bleeding and muttering something about wolves. We don't think he was bitten, but we can't be sure."
Blaise and Pansy shared a look before Pansy turned back to Draco, "Love, your father already knows and he's fine with it, in case you haven't noticed the parade of Potter look-a-likes he's been running back and forth under your nose. But one is too tall, and another's hair is too black. Another's glasses are the wrong shape and don't emphasize his eyes enough."
Once his personal business was done, he looked at his watch and saw that it was 2:30 am. Draco wracked his brain, but he didn't know where the intervening hours had gone. The last thing he remembered was fighting a demon with Chris and Phoebe, then coming back to the house to eat and the sound of baby Wyatt laughing.
Draco sent letter after letter and go no response. His earlier relief that Harry was safe turned into irritation, then rage, then despair and Paige knew she had to do something because she couldn't bear to watch the little blond fall apart.
When he awoke he groaned. His head felt pounds heavier than it should and everything around him glowed with a painfully bright blue light.
Other than that though, Draco ignored everything else. He practiced, and apparently he’d done well. Afterwards, he celebrated with the other second year Slytherins halfheartedly. It had taken him a week to finally snap out of it. Once he did, he ignored the concern lacing everyone's eyes- it wasn’t deserved, or needed. He ignored his godfather, and his housemates, and he ignored Potter also. He didn’t like the way those green eyes looked at him with curiosity, and worry, and speculation. They should only look at him with hate.
Draco just rolled his eyes at her. “I prefer to call it secretive, and scheming. Not, well...not somber, or anything,” Draco huffed.
First was family. Draco had to care for his mother and father- as well as their overall reputation- first and foremost. He had to ensure he carried the Malfoy name with pride, and bring the Malfoy’s honour. This was more important than anything else, and he would do whatever he needed to to keep his family- and their name- safe.
That did the trick, the girl instantly turned red and shied away from Draco. Potter, though, he only seemed to get more riled up. Before he could speak, two figures walked up behind him- Granger and Weasley. They looked just as irate as the golden boy himself did, glaring daggers at Draco.
Distressed, blond hair clung to his forehead, obscuring his vision. Draco promptly shoved it out of his eyes, paying no mind to the sweat and crusted blood that he dragged along his forehead in the process. He couldn’t be in the dark. He couldn’t be left with that disturbing image.
He sat up quickly, shoved his book in his bag, and swung the aforementioned bag over his shoulder angrily. Not even stopping to push his chair back in, Draco stormed out of the library. Daphne was on his heels, and had called out to him multiple times. He ignored her.
Madam Pomfrey took one look at Draco and tutted. “A Pepper-up potion for you dear? This’ll be the third one I’ve given a student this morning alone. Honestly, what are those professors thinking- giving you lot so much work you exhaust yourselves on the third day of classes?”
Changing quickly, Draco stopped to view himself in the mirror. He straightened out his robes, and he scowled when he saw slight bags under his eyes. ‘The problem with having such fair skin,’ Draco thought, ‘is that everyone seems to know when you’ve had a troubling or restless night- or multiple nights.’
“Narcissa, could I have a moment alone with Draco please?” Lucius asked, giving his wife’s hand a squeeze to placate her. She drew her brows together in irritation, but nodded and gave Draco a final hug before making her way back to the apparation zone.
His friends came after all that. To most, their friends would be in second or third place. Or, they wouldn’t even be ranked. Not to mention most people his age wouldn’t think of a possibility where they’d have to hurt and lose their friends for the sake of their own self interest.
He ran through the kitchen and out the door into the courtyard, but before he could get any further he was stopped by a giant figure, Hagrid.
This love became stronger as Lucius recognized the similarities between his son and the wife he had lost. It was more than their appearance, it was their behavior, and their minds. In his son Lucius knew his wife had come again, and he had no intention of losing her again.
"I should go, give these to Ron."
Harry didn't see him, but the room was dark and draped in shadows. On one of their visits here, Draco had hidden by one of the couches, waiting until Harry had almost given up hope before jumping out and covering him with kisses. They'd spent the rest of that day laughing about the very successful 'ambush.'
"Oh," the eldest witch replied, blushing lightly. She walked over to the tired blond and embraced him tightly. He was pink himself after that, though if it was due to embarrassment or lack of air, Paige wasn't sure.
Severus went on, ignoring the interruption. "I never thought I would live through this, but if I die I want it to be worth something. Tell me how I can help."
There were pictures of his home, and his school, and the other students.
Giving in to the idea, Harry nodded and stood, taking the offered hand and following Malfoy out of the Great Hall and towards his fashion destiny.
Chris stared at the boy, "And you are."
Just as she found the bag of cinnamon bagels Piper had brought home the day before hiding behind the peanut butter, they disappeared from her hand in a shower of blue sparks.
Severus just pulled the boy over to lean against his shoulder and accepted the loss of his shirt to tearstains as his due.
Before he knew what hit him, Draco cracked up. He felt his cheeks turning red from laughter and there were tears in his eyes. When he calmed down he saw Piper smiling indulgently at him, reminding him of his own mother when he was young and they were still playing at Happy Families.
Resolved, Harry took another deep breath, then ran his tongue over his dry lips. His thoughts wandered back to Draco and he grinned briefly. His death could be only minutes away, but he could still taste the sweet lemony flavor of the other boy on his lips. The warmth of being loved welled up inside his chest and wrapped around him as he stood behind the brushy shrubs. At least he had that. If he died, at least he had that.
Eventually the healing power seemed to sink in as Severus relaxed on the mattress.
Once he was out of sight he began running until he was out under the night sky. Rushing into the pumphouse where he had left his things, he pulled the bearskin robe back on, braided his hair away from his face, and covered his face and hands with soot.
Paige grinned wider, and opened her mouth to speak. Based on the grin and the light in her eyes, Draco shook his head, "You know what, never mind. I'm too young to hear about that kind of thing."
"Oh Spike, can we keep him? Please?"
"Of course I'm sure. He came flying out of Snape's quarters after the explosion. Tried to heal Snape and Blaise. Blaise was fine by the way, so tell Ron. Then Malfoy and his friends took Snape and Blaise and disappeared. You got the potion?"
"With whom?"
The earliest pictures were black and white, but somehow the little red headed girl still shone. She had a sense of life about her that captured his lens.
Severus sighed, "Blaise, nausea is a natural side effect of pregnancy. It's the bodies' way of protecting the baby from harmful elements in your food. And as for your… chest. It is most likely a figment of your imagination as any… nipple sensitivity should not begin for several months—." The boy opened his mouth to speak, but Severus cut him off, "If it happens at all as most pregnant males never lactate."
"Sorry, Harry. That was rude of us. Now, how are you feeling?" Alex's tone was serious, but there was a grim smile at the corners of his mouth and Harry decided it was in his best interest to go along for the time being.
"How long have you been dead, Draco," Snape asked again.
That had been Draco's introduction to the next phase of his life. Meeting a beautiful woman and promptly becoming sick all over her.
Piper seemed to relax, the daggers in her eyes at the thought of their white lighter being related to a demon now softened into darts. But Phoebe still looked sick.
The witch blushed. "Sorry to interrupt, I had to grab the diaper bags. What was Harry doing here?"
"Yes," the man hesitantly answered, not sure where this was going.
Snape rose from his seat by Draco's bed and both he and Harry left the infirmary, leaving the blond Slytherin to sleep.
Severus put on his best stern tone, but even that couldn't disguise the laughter he felt bubbling underneath. It had been a fairly pleasant morning until Draco woke up and the fighting started.
Severus heard Blaise clear his throat insinuatingly several times before he finally gave up and responded, "Yes?"
Paige nodded, then walked into Severus's open arms. She prepared herself to orb them both to wherever Draco was when she heard a sharp crack and the world began spinning.
The first was a picture of his mother, looking tired and ill, the dark shadows of exhaustion circling her eyes even as his father's shadow dominated the background of the picture.
The boy yawned and said, "Trust me, it's for the best. The boy is dangerous."
"I know what that arrow was, boy. And I know what kind of creature can be killed by that poison."
"Doesn't matter," Draco said, standing. "We have to get out there and -"
"It's the antidote."
The man nodded, grudgingly it seemed, to Draco. Then spoke, with a voice that sounded as tired and pained as his hand had felt, "How can he help, Shannon ? He's a child." Leo turned to Draco, "Please believe me, I'm not trying to underestimate you, but you've only been a white lighter for a few years and you look so…"
One of the Elders, a white lighter Draco had never seen before, stepped forward. "Whitelighter you will lay down your charge and come with us."
Severus granted his a brief glare before replying. "He is in labor."
Now Paige was speaking.
"I bloody well think it is," the brunette answered, gasping.
"He is a child; he wants what he wants and doesn't think about the consequences."
The Room of Requirement was quiet. A fireplace was the only light and flames dancing against the walls showed no one else in there. Harry hooked the cloak on a coatrack that had grown up out of the floor as he reached for it and made his way to the large couch set in the middle of the room.
"So," the elder said, pulling away from the embrace, "What do you want to do now?"
"Who the devil are you?"
The shadows lengthened and Spike moved further out into the room, "Now, now.  Nephew is just a term of… endearment, let's say. After all, the boy was blessed with good looks, not too unlike my own. Only right I feel a bit of kinship."
Spitting the last few drops of acrid bile on the floor, Harry collapsed again, absently noticing that his muscles were aching and the surface under him was not the hard stone he had been expecting, but softer, like a bed.
Draco laughed again, enjoying this new side of his friend. He opened his mouth to introduce himself, before stopping. He couldn't let Harry know who he was. Draco still didn't know if his father was looking for him, and Harry was an honorable man. If Harry knew who Draco as he would be returned to his father, and he could not allow that to happen.
Harry opened his mouth, clamped it shut, then opened it again before releasing a ragged sob and sagging heavily against Severus's shoulder.
She shook her head, knowing this wasn't the time for platitudes. "No, we're not. We have destinies and responsibilities that only we can fulfill. We will never have normal lives."
Draco, head muzzy form the alcohol and the sexual preference-based revelations, leaned back in his chair and stared up at the ceiling where small colonies of kangaroo mice hopped from stone to stone.
I do like Piper but I wasn't the biggest fan of her treatment of Chris
"No, I'm feverish, you have to feel my forehead," with bright eyes the Slytherin stepped closer, and closer still until he was only one alcohol tinged breath away.
"Yes, I think so," Draco said, closing the binder sharply. He loosed Harry's hands from his waist and turned to face the Gryffindor, taking in the view of his love in all his post-makeover finery. "I'm not going to be able to do this for a while, so enjoy it now."
"Lucius, how much did you let me drink? I feel as though my head is wrapped in cotton."
But this was where he would have to draw the line.
Harry heard the voice but kept his gaze on the sky, hoping the sun would burn away the memory of what he saw. The war and the years before it meant he wasn't a stranger to violence, but to see such a thing was harrowing, almost more so because it was voluntary.
"He is no traitor to me, My Lord. He has only my best interest at heart."
Severus watched the grin on Spike's face fade as he reached for the half-dressed man. Pulling him back against his chest, Spike pressed a gentle kiss to his cheek, then guided him to the chair on the other side of the desk.
Caught in the awkward half embrace, Severus wrapped an arm around Harry's shoulder, patting him on the back for a few moments and quietly noticing how much weight the boy had lost.
The laughter turned into conversation and Harry dragged Draco over to Ron.
In the far border of the picture Severus can see Narcissa Black and her sisters, all three of them absently mooning after the skinny blond boy, despite the ears he had yet to grow into and a flaming case of acne.
Blaise slumped back a little, cuddling Jamie to his chest. "That's it? You just kissed? No grand romantic declarations?"
Harry pondered the question, and all of the possible consequences of this night as Draco slowly warmed up in his arms. After the Slytherin had regained his normal, though still pale, coloring, he carried him down to Madame Pomphrey's domain.
"What Ron?"
The Gryffindor leered and reached out, using the collar of Draco's shirt to pull him closer, "I really think we should. Just to be sure it's completely healed."
"Are you okay," Paige asked before standing and walking over to the boy.
Draco could see waves of discomfort crossing Blaise's face. "Paige, do you know where Severus is," he asked, not taking his eyes off of Blaise.
"No, I think now is a very good time for introductions, kiddo," Piper said.
Harry snorted, which made Draco laugh, which made Harry giggle, and together they stood in the garden laughing until they were completely out of breath.
“That makes sense. So, you knew about the original plan then?”
He stood up and went to fetch the ingredients from the storage while Draco just smirked in satisfaction- Draco had clearly won this time.
“It’s simple. In order to help revive our lord I need you to give this-“ Lucius reached into his robes and pulled out a small back diary- “to Ginevra Weasley.”
The head of the Malfoy family felt a surge of pride. His son was a good choice for this; what with how he’d accepted the task so readily. He’d be a great servant to the Dark Lord when he came back. “Good. I’ll leave this with you then.”
Everyone in the room laughed, and Draco pretended to be annoyed as he got ready. During that moment of distraction though, Draco reached for the diary and shoved it in his school bag. Normally he didn’t like hanging on to it, but he didn't have enough time to hide it properly.
Draco nodded in response, and as Pomfrey continued to grumble about irresponsible professors and the like, Draco sighed internally. He almost wished he’d spent the entire night studying or working on assignments. Instead, he’d been talking to the Dark Lord as if he were a distant relative.
Draco felt a sharp spike of panic before it quickly turned to anger. He set his textbook down very slowly, and he looked up at the Slytherin girl again. Meeting her gaze, he said, “And how would you know this?”
Said bird cooed at his owner, and puffed his feathers out in greeting. Dumbledore smiled warmly at this, then returned to his subdued manner as he sat down behind his polished oak desk. With a flick of his wand, the chair in front of Dumbledore slid out. Draco stepped up to it timidly and sat down.
“Well then, your mother went with you to get your supplies last year, so I think it's only fitting if I go with you this year. Besides, I have a stop to make in Knockturn alley anyways.”
As expected, the day was a difficult one for Draco. He’d only gotten about 2 hours worth of sleep, and yet, he felt as if he’d gotten none. All his dorm mates questioned him about his exhaustion- under the impression he’d fallen asleep not long after them- and Draco had to pretend he was not as tired as he really was. Of course, when this didn't work the girls all became concerned that he’d fallen ill and promptly sent him to Madam Pomfrey.
“What do you ask of me father?”
What’s more, Draco was a little suspicious of the diary and how it worked. He had a theory that it made the reader entirely focused on the diary- doing this by placing them in a trance like state- and possibly absorbing some of their strength as well. He believed this because he could think of no other explanation for his intense exhaustion, and how he’d managed to lose track of time so easily.
The Slytherin team had egged the Gryffindors on, as expected. But Draco was still too terrified to really process much. He was afraid he’d lose his mind again. He remembered the golden trio- as well as everybody else, really- had looked at him weirdly for his lack of commentary. Briefly, Draco remembered the Granger girl insulting him.
“Draco. Is your father still donating to the team this year?” Flint grunted. Draco sighed, but nodded. The older boy laughed and hashly patted Draco on the back. Draco grimaced at that, but didn’t complain.
“Going to bed already Draco?” Theodore had called out to him. Draco shakily looked over at his dorm-mate, and gave him a quick nod. On his way to his dorm he felt shakier than ever, and extremely nauseous. Perhaps this was why he didn’t notice the other student’s growing concern, or realize that he’d felt this distortion before. What he did notice though, was Daphne Greengrass. She looked at him with fear, and then turned her head away- completely avoiding looking at him.
_______________________________________________________________________
Draco could tell she wasn't fully placated, but it didn’t matter. He wouldn’t let her change his mind. As Draco gave a short nod in response, Narcissa smiled and made her way out of the library. Once she was gone, Draco turned back to his book. He still had a ritual to find.
There was a reason Draco wasn’t planning on taking divination in his third year; that branch of magic was so obscure half of the “seers” and “prophets” were fake. Very few were actually real. And Draco had been stupid to think an artifact like this coud exist and yet, not be mentioned anywhere. ‘So much for figuring out what my destiny is,’ Draco scoffed.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“When, Mr. Malfoy, did you injure your hand?”
When he finally came to it was morning. The sound of the other Slytherin boys getting ready for the day was what woke him. Draco sat up groggily, and he groaned. The diary was splayed open next to his chest, and he was lying in bed atop his sheets with his blanket falling over his legs.
Something warm trickled down onto his hand, and he hissed, flinching his hand back in the process. It stung momentarily, but soon the pain was replaced by relief as his hand began to numb. Looking down at his palm, Draco gaped. The fog in his head cleared, and Draco felt alive again, full of a wondrous, childlike hope.
The three Slytherin’s nodded in agreement and moved accordingly. Draco didn’t mind working with a Gryffindor as long as they didn’t behave foolishly- which, they would undoubtedly do. Still, he had no energy to be upset about it today.
Pulling his hand away from his face he froze. At first he thought he was bleeding, as there was blood on his hand. But the blood was dry, and he didn’t feel any blood running down his face. He supposed the cut could’ve healed over though; but that would mean he had been unconscious for longer than a few moments- and couldn’t even remember hurting himself. But he must be hurt, otherwise...the blood was...no. He wouldn’t think that.
Second- Ministry officials. The best way to keep his family safe was to be in the Ministry's good graces. He had to know every important person's name by heart- with one glance he should be able to identify them, and automatically recall their family history. He also needed to know who was most trustworthy, and who liked him the most. He wasn’t as good at this as his father was, but he was far more advanced than anyone else his age- and that was enough for now.
“But here’s the thing; who’s not at the staff table right now? And who would gladly fight Dumbledore on the matter in front of the school board?” Pansy asked, eyes alight with excitement. She almost scared Draco when she got like this...almost, but not definitely.
His amusement was cut short when a small red headed girl with freckles turned to look at him inquiringly. If that hair was anything to go by...she was a Weasley. And wasn’t that embarrassing, being caught off guard by a Weasley like that. He threw a look of utter contempt back at the girl before realizing Potter had shakily made his way to the crowd. Specifically, right next to that Weaselette.
Dumbfounded, Draco gave the headmaster a silent, questioning look. Dumbledore, unaware, simply laid the yellow candy in front of him. He reached out for the candy and held it between his fingers- fiddling with it absently. “If you don’t want it, Mr. Malfoy, Fawkes would be more than happy to take it off your hands.”
Draco looked at Daphne in surprise- he hadn’t known she was joining him. The other second year Slytherins weren’t anywhere in sight, and she and Draco hardly spent time alone together. Now that he thought about it, it seemed as though the others had been trying to keep Daphne from being alone with Draco.
Draco couldn’t suppress his interest. He’d wondered where Potter had been earlier, but he’d just figured he had been in a changing compartment or something. “The point, Pansy dear,” Blaise broke in.
Draco is confronted by both Snape and Daphne, but one of them gets too close to the truth. Once things are settled, Draco can't seem to remember certain events, and he looks forward to Halloween where, surely, he'll get a break from all of his worries. Right?
‘What do you need me to do for you?’
Third- Himself. He wouldn’t hesitate to put himself in danger to defend his family. Theoretically, he knew he should be second on the list. But if he was being honest with himself...he didn’t care much for his safety or wellbeing. No, he wasn’t suicidal- but he did lack a sufficient amount of care for himself. Though, when threatened by others, he wouldn’t hesitate to use any means available to take the threat down.
“No, definitely not! Theory bores me. At that point, I’d purposefully fall asleep in your class.”
Sighing, he tucked the diary into his pocket and made his way out of the compartment. Outside, he was greeted by the presence of his two “friends.” Luckily, they had gotten the message- and didn’t take long changing. Draco didn’t like to wait.
Draco hopped off his broom and cleared his train of thought. Yes, he really did suppose yesterday had been most eventful. And even though he understood his mother's worry he knew things would be ok. He’d have his father there to ensure he was safe, afterall.
Daphne’s tone had changed dramatically from earlier; she was playing detective. Draco knew the conversation would have something to do with the diary- how could it not? That didn’t mean he was looking forward to this conversation. Daphne was a sweet girl, and Draco really didn’t want to lash out at her. “Nobody’s ignoring anything Daphne. Nothings going on. I’ve just been busy with the research my father’s assigned.”
Once more, the old man in front of him dismissed him altogether. “I must ask you to calm yourself Mr. Malfoy. I stand firm in my words- you are not the culprit behind Miss Greengrass’s petrification.”
And here Daphne was. Asking him a simple question for the most part- if he was ok. Practically pleading for him to talk to her about his concerns. Daphne hadn’t grown up with all the pureblood customs, and Draco decided that this was why she was looking at him like that. Worrying over him. And treating him like...like how the golden trio treated each other.
Draco nodded to Pansy and Blaise- telling them they could go straight to the Great Hall for lunch instead of waiting around for him. They gave him a short nod back, and continued to chat happily as they walked out of the classroom.
Her rosy lips curved into a small smile as her eyes met her sons. “No, I would never underestimate your intelligence mother. I got mine from someone didn’t I?” Draco said, a small smile of his own forming.
Riddle gave him a small smile, “Yes. You know, I’m glad your father’s plan didn’t work out. That Weasley girl wouldn’t have been nearly as interesting as you.”
Draco groaned. As did Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini. Daphne hesitated, but then she let out a small “Merlin…” and hid her face in her book.
Draco caught his breath and gave an icy glare to the Weasley before him. He didn’t like the arrangement, but he supposed he hadn’t lost, and he had accomplished what he’d come here to do anyways.  “Fine, it’s a deal,” Draco said begrudgingly.
Still, he had to apologize to his father. He owed him. And maybe, maybe he’ll be wrong. Just this once.
Draco’s face contorted in anger. He was behind this, he knows it! “Then how do you explain the blood? There was blood on the wall, and now blood on my hands,” he whispered.
He sighed and turned his attention to the dimming lantern near his bedside table, sticking his hand out towards it and focusing his magic towards his fingertips. He concentrated and murmured “Incendio” under his breath, letting the magic flare out his fingertips and relight the candle in the lantern.
Draco was paralyzed with fear. His father really would kill him for messing up this badly. He couldn’t give the diary back to the Weaslette; she would just return it to him, or become suspicious and turn the diary in to the professors. And he couldn’t return home during the break without the diary being delivered to someone else.
Daphne took that opportunity to shove her little sister behind her as Theodore stepped up beside Daphne to defend the two of them. The Weasley just looked surprised but...shockingly let a small smirk drift across her lips for a mere second.
He was wary, Draco always was after seeing his father smirk like that. But he had to apologize, and if this was a way to do so…
Blaise looked upset for a fraction of a second before he cleared his expression. “Fine. Sorry Draco,” he apologized. Thankfully, his performance must’ve worked if Blaise was fooled; he was the most skeptical out of all of them.
Dobby appeared in an instant, looking up at Draco with his wide eyes. He looked expectant, and ready to serve Draco in any way he commanded. “Yes, Master Draco? How may Dobby serve you?”
That left Draco with one option- struggle through the day until he could get back to his dorm and sleep.
“Famous Harry Potter. Can’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page,” Draco said, giving Potter his best sneer. Instantly, the previous look was gone from Potter’s features, and was instead replaced with anger.
Draco did love to see Snape and Potter argue, as it usually ended with Potter being put in his place. But right now, Draco wished Snape wouldn’t drag him into this mess. So, he joined Potter and gave his godfather a truly menacing glare (as menacing a glare as a second year could give, anyways).
Still, even with those thoughts to comfort him, Draco felt that same uneasy feeling the diary drew out of him. It was packed in with his Hogwarts robes at the top of his trunk- hidden, but easily accessed.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I feel dreadful Blaise. And to answer your question, Charms happened. That oaf Flitwick assigned multiple essays, you know.”
So, when Pansy elbowed him in the ribs, Draco only sent a mild glare at her. “What do you want Pansy?”
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
“He’s the golden boy of Gryffindor, and the headmaster adores him. I doubt he’ll be expelled Pansy,” Blaise mumbled, stating the obvious. Everyone nodded in agreement. Draco knew it was the truth- that Potter should be expelled, but his title would, once again, make him “untouchable.”
Draco was in the common room. His assignments were scattered around him, and the other Slytherin’s were laughing boisterously. A quill was in his hand and the parchment in front of him indicated that he’d been writing something. Upon further inspection, he noticed it was his herbology essay. Almost completely written.
Check. He had a relationship with Potter, one where he could provide information on him to whoever asked. And check again. Because clearly, he wouldn’t turn himself in.
“You claim pushing a book cart towards me is not a show of defiance and a clear attack?” Lucius snarled. “Or are you merely idiotic enough to belive that assualt is only assault if it is done by magical means?”
“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear. All those raids...I hope they’re paying you overtime? " Lucius smirked, eyes flashing in delight. He looked like a predator ready to pounce on his prey, and it was...slightly unnerving to see his father like that.
It wasn’t that she made an incorrect statement, in fact, it was a logical one. The thing was, she clearly didn’t remember this was Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley she was talking about.
For the rest of the night Draco had described Hogwarts to the Dark Lord. The staff, Dumbledore, the non-existent house unity, and the star of Hogwarts- Harry Potter. Tom Riddle seemed particularly interested in both Dumbledore and Potter, which wasn’t a surprise. But what did surprise Draco was how Riddle always brought the conversation back to him- like he wanted to know more about Draco above all else.
Pansy looked at the others- who simply looked amused- and then turned back to Draco. With a small huff, and a roll of her eyes, she said, “Because he’s hilarious. He’s much too cynical for a Hufflepuff, and everybody knows he can’t stand the Gryffindors. Well, most of them anyways.”
Draco cringed. “That Hufflepuff boy? Why do you care about him?”
There, on the wall, was a message in red. And below that, in a puddle of water...lay a still Daphne Greengrass.
The relief that overtook Draco was blinding. He still felt a pang of guilt at the confirmation of the scene- even if he hadn’t killed Daphne he’d surely hurt her- but he was soothed now- at least a little bit. Draco’s shoulders released their tension, and his taut posture faded away- Fawkes shifted awkwardly at this adjustment. His lips parted as he let out a long, slow breath, but finally, finally, he felt a semblance of peace.
“So, I suppose this means Draco will be Slytherin’s official Seeker then?” Daphne asked, stepping beside Draco.
Draco inspected the statue, looking for any hidden runes or levers. Realistically, Draco knew the office probably had a password, but he didn’t care to just stand in the empty corridor alone with only his thoughts for company- waiting until, miraculously, a professor stopped by and let him in. So, he busied himself with pointless work.
Once Dobby apparated away Draco let out a long breath. His first task was done. Dobby would get rid of the ring and nobody would ever know what he’d done. Sure, Borgin may suspect, but he’d hardly bring it up to Lucius in fear of losing a client, or the money he’d gotten from Draco. And it wasn’t like the Weasleys, Granger, or Potter were going to confront him about what had happened. So, everything was fine.
She shook her head. “You acted like a 12 year old child- which you are. And anyways, your father seemed awfully hypocritical; telling you not to badmouth Harry Potter so you don’t make a statement to the light wizards, and then insulting the family he thinks of as his own. He did exactly what he told you not to do, just more indirectly.” Narcissa reasoned. She pursed her lips together and continued, “And anyways, you certainly did not shame the family. If you’ve read up on our family history- which I know you have- then you should be able to see that what you did today does not at all compare to what those who have shamed the family have done.”
Draco stared at the object in surprise before a hand fell on his shoulder, temporarily distracting him from the burning sensation the ring was undoubtedly producing. He looked around and met the cold gray eyes of his father. His heart dropped. Of all times for the ring to be...doing something..it just had to be now.
Severus considered Draco for a moment. He wouldn’t lie to himself, the boy looked awful. And he also knew he was lying- ‘Though not completely,’ his mind supplied. A normal person would consider Draco’s words and give in at this point. He was doing remarkably well, and could probably fool a lot of adults too.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco quickly ducked behind the corridor’s wall. The Gryffindors hadn’t seen him, and though Draco had nothing to feel guilty for, he knew how the situation would appear to the trio. At least, he knew how he would perceive the situation had it been the other way around. But Draco also knew he wouldn’t be as lucky as the trio: he was a Slytherin, Harry Potter’s rival, and a Malfoy. That all allotted him a pretty bad reputation.
The two boys were almost through the brewing session when an error occurred. Potter had started to put the nettle in the cauldron when Draco caught his wrist in midair, swiftly lowering it down- and away from the cauldron. Potter looked surprised, then annoyed.
Lucius was eerily calm throughout his tirade, but his magic was sharp and forceful- indicating how furious he was behind his mask. “But, father, I didn’t attack you I-”  Draco started.
"Ah, you have returned and you are indeed more beautiful, my wood elf. I fear now in truth that shall go blind tomorrow. Even today you dazzle me almost to the point of tears." Harry's words were playful, and his voice held a note of laughter that sent a shiver down Draco's spine, but his eyes were completely serious, and this time when Harry took up Draco's fingers he did not kiss the air above them but instead pressed a kiss upon the pale skin. Draco felt a breath roll over the back of his hand and closed his eyes, opening them again as Harry took his hand and led him to the dance floor.
Severus turned back to his potions. The petite Slytherin had taken to visiting Severus's lab in the mid-afternoon, so the man took care to brew the more dangerous potions on his list in the late evening, allowing several hours for the fumes to dissipate before his next visit. At the moment he was only concocting a draft for upset stomach and heartburn at Madame Pomphrey's request. As the stress level in the castle increased, so did the need for such tonics.
The truth was more mundane. He was no more than a common apothecary, and if his potions worked better or more efficiently, they still couldn't restart a stopped heart or return breath to the dead.
The dreams weren't Voldemort's sending; the Dark Lord was dead. Tom had caught the latest nasty flu bug going around and since his immune system hadn't fully developed after his return to life he died, uncomfortably and disgustingly, drowning in his own mucous.
After thanking the Charmed Ones for their hospitality and for taking care of the wayward Hogwarts population, Harry, Neville, Hermione, Alex, Spike, and Severus made ready to go.
"It's his godfather," the brunette added.
Harry pressed his ear against the door, but the music was loud and the bass was thumping, so he couldn't hear anything that was happening inside.
"I'm sorry Blaise. I'm just distracted, I suppose."
A stifled snort drew all three men's attention to the corner where Chris was glowing a bright pink with repressed laughter. "Sorry, sorry. Couldn't stop myself." He took a few deep breaths, regaining control of himself. "Inappropriate, I know. Sorry."
Draco laughed, "Don't worry, godfather, Spike is harmless. He has a chip in his head that prevents him from hurting humans. Besides, he's my favorite uncle, my only one really, he used to sneak into the manor when I was a child and take me on adventures. I guess it should have been a clue of my parents regard when they never seemed to notice I was gone for days on end…"
Paige unwrapped one of her arms from Draco and accepted the gesture.
"Harry, are you all right?"
Charmed- Charmed is the story of three sisters decreed to be the Charmed Ones, witches who were destined to hold great power and the responsibility to fight demons and protect humanity. Prue, Piper, and Phoebe's powers were bound in their early childhood and they had no knowledge of them until after the death of their grandmother. In the course if their fight against evil the oldest sister, Prue, was killed. The surviving girls found that they had a half sister, part witch and part white lighter, named Paige. She joined Piper and Phoebe to reform the Charmed Ones. Piper has the ability to freeze time/demons and make things explode. Phoebe has premonitions and empathy though those things are suspended at this time. Paige has the ability to orb herself and objects, which is much like the Transporter used in Star Trek.
Draco swung the door open before Blaise could finish his complaint and let the boy in the bathroom, squeezing past his bulging stomach and into the hallway beyond.
Piper looked relieved, but Draco was still worried. Wyatt might be safe but no one built a weapon like this for nothing. It had a purpose, though Draco didn't know what it was yet.
Paige didn't say anything and Severus felt the urge to fill the silence.
"If you wish to know my condition I would suggest you ask me," Snape said from where he lay against the pillows. His voice was weak and thready, but the tone was as calm and sarcastic as Harry expected and the boy was relieved.
"Oi. No breeders in the club. It puts me right off."
She didn't know what to do. If this were one of her sisters, or Draco or Spike or something she would know exactly. But Harry was a stranger. Still, he was in pain, and she couldn't let him be in pain alone. She unbuckled her seatbelt and leaned over, rubbing his back and pressing her face into the back of her head so she could mutter comforting nothings like, 'it will be okay. You're going to be fine.'
"But I—"
When Draco was calm enough to tell them what had probably happened, the two angels got to work. The potion, though ultimately healing, had several stages when it was completely toxic. Blaise, pregnant as he was, and Paige didn't really want to think about that, should never even have been in the room while it was brewed, it was likely only Severus and Draco's quick action that saved the boy and the baby inside of him.
They were in a grey space. Nameless winds swirled around their ghostly forms.
Chris smiled and replied smugly, "He's bad, but I don't think he's dangerous right now. He has a chip in his head that prevents him from hurting humans."
"He's injured. Internal or something. He said it felt like a stab. I have to get out there and stop the weapon before it bring the entire castle down on us but I need you to watch over him."
"That's what we want to know," Piper replied, as she picked up Wyatt and propped him on her hip, shushing him gently. "According to Paige, Draco heard some sort of whitelighter emergency alarm and passed out, but we're all okay."
"Ah Severus, you're falling apart. No student will ever be afraid of you again," he muttered under his breath as he walked up the stairs.
His relationship with Draco Malfoy an open issue now, he was buried next to his love with great pomp and ceremony, under a head stone that read, 'Harry James Potter- Beloved and undeserving.'
"Paige," Piper squawked indignantly, "You can't have a soda for breakfast."
"See, Severus? You have to stay here. Paige can take care of you until we disable that machine."
The news held no reports of 'wild animal attacks' so Harry knew that Ron was a specific target which meant someone knew they were there and what they were doing and life had suddenly become much more dangerous.
"Before I tell you anything, who was the man who came in here?"
Ron seemed to accept that answer and turned back to the photos, exclaiming over his lover's development to the bushy haired girl.
This time when he entered the ballroom he noticed the looks he was getting and blushed. He had been looked at before by Pomphrey and Severus, and later by his father, but it was not the same. These were strangers, and they admired him as though he was some beautiful thing.
Turning back to the man, the vampire said, "Serious business here, whelp. A friend of a friend is in trouble and we know he's around here. Though you might be able to point us in his direction, what with you having your finger on the pulse as it were."
Snape reached trembling fingers up to his head, ignoring for the moment the rest of what the man was saying. When he felt the soft press of cotton bandaging against his hair, he groaned and muttered to himself, "It was real. Some strange man was on my floor."
He jumped to his feet and before he realized it his wand was in his hand
Paige was feeling a little uncomfortable as the frank way Xander looked her over, and she was thankful Blaise had given her a high-necked shirt.
"Severus," Paige said.
Draco sniffed. Pansy had always spoken bluntly to him; it was one of her best and worst qualities. But she didn't have to quite so frank.
She blushed a light pink and backed out of the room, muttering something about someone named 'Chris' who was apparently just Severus's size.
"I am not gay. And I am most definitely not gay for Potter. My father would kill me."
She sent a letter off to Severus, but according to the potion's master Harry was not fine. In Severus's words Harry was a 'moody, emotional little twat' and 'dicked in the nob.' Once Paige found out from the British contingent what that actually meant, she knew the situation was bad. Sev was sarcastic, but he wasn't coarse.
Draco nodded, his lips pressed into a thin line, and with a shimmering fall of blue sparks Shannon was gone.
Paige turned to the doorway and saw Blaise, sleep-tousled, leaning against the wooden frame.
The vampire paled, if that was possible, and Paige began to feel a spin of nausea in her stomach, "What did he say, Spike?"
That was broken by the sound of someone pounding on his doors. Severus stood up, setting his book on the coffee table and made his way to the door of his chambers. When he got there he disabled the wards and the pounding became louder without their muffling effect. He pulled the door open and stood as straight as he could, hoping the use every inch of his height to intimidate whomever was bothering him enough to send them away.
"My head is killing me and I feel like I threw up an internal organ shortly after being electrocuted. Par for the course, I'd say." The bleached blond, Spike, grinned at that, and Harry went on, "Now what were you talking about before? Dragon?"
Paige answered, "I don't know, I just got here."
Love.
Eyes closed against the rain and he felt his lover's warm arms wrap around his middle. The gusty sigh against his ear provided all the answer he was really expecting, but he listened to Harry anyway.
"Draco, are you okay? It's your ribs-"
The three of them nodded seriously and Severus made his way to another empty cot, not too far from Harry's. if he was correct, Harry would need him again when he woke and it wouldn't do to be too far away.
The castle changed over the course of only a few weeks. Though the kingdom still suffered, the inhabitants of the castle were joyous and surrounded in every luxury. Lucius had presented his son to the court, most of whom had believed the boy dead or deformed somehow. At Draco's urging the king had agreed to keep their betrothal a secret until the prince's seventeenth birthday. In preparation for their union Draco requested some specific things, in part to delay the ceremony and part in the hopes that the things he 'required' for his marriage might be impossible to obtain, thereby giving him and excuse not to go through with the ceremony.
“It’s a strange phenomenon, I know. But you get used to it,” The man remarked as he gracefully let go of Draco's hand and stepped around him. “This way, just follow me.”
At that, Daphne abruptly slapped Draco on the shoulder. “You really should know better than to leave something with an aura that strong out in the open. And losing it? No wonder your father would’ve been upset! Any teacher besides Snape would’ve confiscated it for sure!” Daphne whisper shouted- aware Madam Prince or a lurking student could potentially be eavesdropping.
With that, Draco fled down the stairs back to the first floor, merging with the crowd as he did so. He supposed he should actually be grateful for the shop having so many occupants today then. Coming to a halt in front of the Lockhart display Draco swept up his required books (nearly every single one written by Lockhart) and turned around to head over to a shopkeeper so he could pay and get out of this dratted place- ‘and get away from Potter.’
‘Greetings, Mr. Malfoy. I thank thee for the proclamation of loyalty. Though you likely know my true identity, my former self occupies these pages. So please, address me as Tom Riddle for the time being.’
Draco made his way to the Great Hall with Crabbe and Goyle; and this time he was just as anxious as the two boys to get there. The Halloween feast was fantastic, and Draco did like the decorations (even if they were invented by muggles). He supposed some muggles had a good eye, though he’d never admit this to anyone.

When the two Slytherins reached the library they found a table quickly, and started to pull their assignments out of their bags. Daphne was working on Transfiguration, and Draco on Herbology. They worked in silence for a couple hours, but of course, Daphne broke it.
She simply shrugged, “Well Flint’s a fifth year...and he looked just as tired as you did this past week.”
Draco lost his train of thought. He stifled a cry and pressed against the wall even harder. He felt his eyes burn, and for the first time in a long time, Draco thought he might cry.
Draco hesitantly joined his godfather. The two of them sat there in silence for a good while. They just observed one another silently, and Draco willed himself to clear his expressions away completely.
Draco made his face scrunch up in worry, and he let the book fall limply from his hands. “Blaise, don’t, please,” he pleaded. “I can’t find the heirloom and my father will be very upset if I’ve lost it. So, I don’t want to think about it right now.” Draco was feigning his sorrow, his worry. He was manipulating his friends but...family came first. His father came first. They’d understand if they were in his position.
Pondering on this, Draco realized he really didn’t know what spell he could’ve used. Petrificus Totalus was the only thing close to this situation that came to mind, but that wouldn’t be plausible. For one, it would have been easily identifiable. For two, it would also be easily reversible.
As expected, Snape wasn’t an easy read. Really, Draco got nothing from him. Finally, Draco gave in. “I wasn’t avoiding you professor. I’ve just been busy as of late.”
Nothing eventful happened. Sure, he had gone to quidditch practice last week, and the Gryffindor’s reactions were just as he expected them to be. Potter looked especially outraged, and Weasley was even more upset than Potter was. The boy had physically turned red with anger.
However, he supposed some of his hard work had paid off in the end. Despite getting the second best scores in his year, he had still pleased his parents enough for him to receive the promise of getting the best broom model released as of now. The Nimbus 2001 was rumored to be excellent, brilliantly fast and yet smooth enough to make the sharpest turns at the last moment. It would be wonderful to fly on. As he felt the wind wrap around him Draco realized he really had missed flying the most while at Hogwarts. He’d simply been too distracted with his classes and getting acquainted with the older Slytherins in his house to really notice, he'd supposed.
“Dobby, bring my dinner in the dining room. I’ll be joining my family tonight,” he’d proclaimed. And, as soon as he’d said that, a smile immediately found its way on Draco's face. He was usually much better at concealing his emotions, but he couldn’t help it. He hadn’t eaten with his father in weeks, and now it appeared his father was finally completed with whatever task he’d been working on.
Draco sagged in relief. He had passed the Dark Lords ‘test,’ and would be able to get this whole thing over with.
The first was a blinding flash of pain that erupted throughout Draco’s whole body, causing him to suck in a deep breath and stagger. If it hadn’t been for Draco’s rigorous training in keeping a calm composure at all times- and the presence of Draco’s enemies- he surely would’ve screamed out in agony and fallen to his knees. It felt like the cruciatus curse, only with more of a burning than slicing sensation. Draco had fallen victim to one of his father's stray curses when he was younger, and he hadn’t wished to revisit the feeling again. It couldn’t be helped now, he’d supposed.
….And he spoke too soon. Because without breaking eye contact with Potter, Snape pointed towards Draco. “Don’t be daft. There’s a seat next to Mr. Malfoy.”
Somewhere deep down, Draco felt bad that he'd fooled his friends like that. ‘Family first Draco,’ he heard his father saying. And if it took Draco a couple of minutes of repeating the mantra for him to finally get rid of the guilty feeling, then that was ok.
Lucius hissed in absolute agitation, and dragged his son to the front of the store without sparing a glance back at the Weasley family. He simply reached in his pocket, pulled out a bag of galleons, and deposited them in the shopkeepers hands at the front of the store before marching out of the store in swift strides. Once they got outside he gripped Draco’s shoulder so hard Draco was sure it would bruise, then he pulled his son into him firmly and apparated away. What Lucius would soon remember though, was that he had entirely forgotten to “gift” the small black book hidden under his robes to the Weasley girl in his haste to leave that foul scene behind him.
