“Hermione’s booked us for an exclusive interview with Witch Weekly at eleven. You know, to announce that we’re dating. I imagine they will want to take lots of pictures.” This gets Draco’s attention. He sits up and it is only as he does so that he realizes Harry has brought him breakfast in bed. A tray hovers behind the brunet and Draco can smell both coffee and bacon. His stomach rumbles.
They traipsed out of the Room of Requirement. Dobby came last as he wanted to gather his Christmas decorations up first.
“True,” Draco says. “Harry will probably be back by now.” Massi tenses at the mention of Harry. “What?”
Damn, it's been a good week for writing. However now that Wizards Unite has come out, who knows when I'll be updating this. I jest, but I think I will be back to my usual chapter every couple of weeks from here on out.
“Over there,” Potter says, pointing towards a door along the left hand wall. “Cold pantry. I assume you’re looking for the milk.”
“We’re late,” Harry says, pointing at his watch. “We should go.” He stands up. Malfoy gives a small, resigned sigh. While the blond still seems upset, he appears to be at least less angry with Harry. He pushes his chair back, stands, then picks up the coffee for one last sip. Harry watches in amazement as the blond downs the rest of the liquid in one go before wiping his mouth on the back of his sleeve.
“Snape gave me this,” he said. Draco took the phial and examined it. After a minute of turning it over in his hands and examining it, he gave it back.
“I thought you said you weren’t interested in men,” Harry says to Massi, a smile playing about his lips. Draco sees Massi shrug beside him.
“Yes,” Pansy said. They sat in silence for a long few minutes, Pansy grinding her teeth and Blaise trying very hard not to think about the fact that Pansy was still mostly naked next to him.
“Is that your way of saying we should?” Harry’s mouth was dry. This was uncharted territory for him. Hand jobs were one thing. It wasn’t that different from jerking off himself.
It’s just as Draco is reaching the front door that his own mobile starts to ring. He stops dead, fear flooding through him as he looks at the number calling. It’s the house phone he’d insisted his mother get for emergencies. It’s been programed into his phone since the day he’d gotten it, but this is the first time the number has ever flashed up on the screen.
But Greg remains tight lipped - so tight lipped that Harry jokingly asks if Pansy has obliviated him.
“Well then, Mr. Potter,” Narcissa said. She stood and made her way over to them. “It is my pleasure to reacquaint myself with you.” She held out her hand and Harry dropped Draco’s in order to shake it. “I would like to apologize for how my family has behaved towards you in the past.”
“Master Draco,” the voice at the other end of the phone squeaks. It’s one of the house elves, Shreeky perhaps, going by the timbre. “You is not to come home.”
“And you’re sure we have to do this?” Draco asks. They are standing on the front stoop of Ron and Hermione’s house in Barnes.
“This way,” Draco said. They walked out into the corridor. It was deserted, a fact for which Harry was glad.
Malfoy nods and takes a step towards the grate. He reaches up on top of the hearth and grabs a handful of Floo powder.
It does end up taking all of the rest of the afternoon, Pansy and McLaggen manage to make around to every real estate agent on the list. But what they learn doesn’t make much sense. Pansy was hoping there would be some connection between the various agents but none of them had been dealing with the same people. They haven’t even been dealing with the same mortgage brokers or banks.
“Yes, snacks,” she said. She continued to pull various desserts out of her bag and watched in amusement as Blaise’s mouth fell slightly open.
“And I read it, which seemingly was the wrong thing to do.” At this, Parkinson gives a short, humorless laugh.
coworker was going to Hannah’s party and had followed her. They had assured her that they had been invited, but she is not sure, and that’s another reason for her nerves.
“Good.” Dempsey pauses and rests her elbows on the table, making a tent with her arms. She leans forward and rests her chin on her hands as she regards Pansy. Pansy does her best to sit still and straight. After a long moment of scrutinizing Pansy, Dempsey leans back in her chair. “If it were any other one of my agents looking into an old friend, I might have reservations, but Parkinson, you have shown that you are nothing if not professional. Don’t make me regret keeping you on this case.”
“It was a little funny,” he says, looking up and smirking at at the brunet. Harry continues to glare, but as Draco watches, the corners of his mouth start to twitch up. “See,” he says. “Even you think it was funny.” Harry rolls his eyes.
Draco laughed in triumph, but it was short lived as Harry quickly figured out that he too was ticklish, and where, and proceeded to tickle him until he was begging for mercy.
“Due to the location. It is the house next to where a previous death had occurred.” He rummages around in his bag and pulls out a sheaf of papers. Pansy shakes her head.
“You’re welcome, Harry,” she said. “It’s always nice to spend time with someone who doesn’t look at me like I’m mad.” She smiled at him and Harry, who had been about to leave, found himself pulling her into a hug.
“You can’t sit with us,” Harry said. He tried to convey the thought of ‘because most of the school thinks we hate each other’ with his face, but he was neither a skilled Legillimens nor particularly good at conveying complex thoughts with his face and so it failed.
“No more of that now,” he said. “It’s time to go back to the party.” Harry sighed but followed Draco back up the tunnel.
He is glad that he is already thinking about controlling his emotions because he nearly yells in surprise when he finds Greg and Pansy locked in a passionate embrace, their faces pressed together. He stops walking, staring at the pair of them, his jaw on the floor. Then he pulls himself together and turns to Ginny.
“Be either very early or very late to this party?” Ron hazarded. It seemed like a safe answer. It covered most possibilities.
“You need to work on your subtlety, Harry,” Ernie said to him as he was standing by the bar waiting for Dobby to make him a Blood and Sand. “Anyone paying any sort of attention to the two of you would have noticed you both leaving and then coming back to the party looking rather hot under the collar. Do I even want to know what was going on in that tunnel? I seem to recall you two talking about—“
Both Draco and Blaise were wearing trousers and button down shirts, and it was all that Pansy could do not to roll her eyes at them. Bloody predictable men.
“There wasn’t the blood splatter one might expect from someone whose throat was cut. It appeared that they were dead before that happened.”
to be anything,” he says. “If anything, I wanted to be bloody normal.” He leans back into the armchair’s soft cushions. “You try having teenage angst on top of being stressed out about some asshole constantly trying to kill you, all the while people are telling you that
“Fucking Potter,” she mutters and then adds something inaudible. Harry almost feels sorry for her, but then he remembers that she had just tried to knock them out. He is surprised that she was so brazen. The DMLEHS must be really gunning to fix the situation before the Unspeakables can. He wonders if she knows The Reliquary is gone. He doubts it, or she would have been more gentle in trying to bring Malfoy in.
“As you wish,” Harry says. He clambers off of Draco and shimmies out of his jeans. And for half a second, Draco is nervous. It’s been so long since that first night.
“Yes,” Cormac says. “She arrived home this morning.” Pansy shifts her weight slightly, opening her knees more and Cormac takes the opportunity to pull her leg up and over his, sliding along the sofa cushions until his hip is pressed up next to her. He pauses there, his eyes questioning. She nods almost imperceptibly even though a part of her is telling her that this is a bad idea. But that voice is quickly drowned by whisky and hormones.
The Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes Crackers are a certified hit. When Harry and Draco pull the first one, an actual firework dragon flies out as the cracker booms. The dragon circles the table a couple of times, breathing sparks over them, before it fizzles out. Narcissa beams and claps her hands in excitement.
“This,” he said immediately. Narcissa smiled, but Harry felt like he should say more, so he added, “As it has come out, each thing has become my favorite.”
“This will be fun,” Massi says, straightening Draco’s bowtie. “It will be a very exciting evening.” Draco blinks for a moment, overcome with a feeling of deja vu, until he realizes this is a mirror of Harry convincing him everything would be fine before the opening night of La Scala. And yet, here they are.
“Not for Muggle bugs,” Harry says, pulling a handful out of his pocket. He also pulls out his wand and uses it to spell the bugs onto unseen places on all of Hermione’s clothing that he can see.
“Yes, Severus,” Dumbledore said. “I expect you to help. After all, you have been working with them on their Occlumency. And,” he paused for a moment. “You will be their new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.”
“Good,” he said. “I was just worried for a moment.” Draco reached up and scratched the back of his head.
“I hope we can still be a team,” he says. But Pansy smiles at him in a way that makes it seem like they won’t be.
“Really.” Kreacher sat down, his eyes welling with tears again, and clutched the locket to his chest. As he sobbed, Dobby came up and patted Kreacher on the back.
“Snacks?” Blaise asked. He looked up from the lemon he was cutting in two. Hermione opened her bag and pulled out the plate of cakes and placed it on the bar top. Blaise’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.
“Where are they?” Draco asked Pansy. He was impatiently bouncing on the balls of his feet, watching the door to the Room of Requirement. The room was set out in a similar manner to their impromptu Friday night party, outdoor area included, but it was decorated to the nines. Cobwebs festooned the bar and booths, along with the occasional conjured spider. There was a small graveyard in the corner, complete with ever so slightly damp grass and wreathed in fog that hung around the graves and would not shift for anything. The bar behind Draco was fully stocked with dusty, though newly purchased, liquor bottles. There was even a ghoul in a cage hanging from the ceiling that was actually just one of the First Years in costume (sworn to secrecy of course).
“The one with the power to, uh, defeat the Dark Lord, something, born at the end of July. There was something else, but the important part is ‘either must die at the hand of the other, for neither can live while the other survives’.” Draco blinked at him. He looked unimpressed.
“We know more than I’ve let on,” McLaggen says. Pansy slumps back on the couch cushions and crosses her arms. “What?” McLaggen throws his hands up in the air. “I’m still figuring out if we can trust you.”
“We’re all able to do magic, you pompous ass,” Draco says. Harry narrows his eyes and glares at him.
“Does this mean you joined our group costume?” Draco was far more excited about this than he would have expected to be.
and sees Luna Lovegood standing there. She is dressed as a multicolored unicorn. An uncomfortable knot forms in Draco’s stomach. He hasn’t seen Lovegood sine the war. Anytime she has come into the bookstore, he has hidden in the back room, too ashamed to face her after his family kept her in their cellar for months.
“We’re just going to leave him?” Draco asks. He is stalling, trying not to leave alone with Massi. He trusts the man about as far as he can throw him.
“You’re not going soft, Harry. Just because you like someone,” Ron said gently. He laid a hand on Harry’s arm and gave it a small squeeze.
“No,” Harry said, stamping his foot. “Enough riddles. Tell me what you mean.” Dumbledore smiled in a way that seemed to say that it was a fair demand.
four of us,” McLaggen says, his eyes flashing in irritation. “But then Oliver Wood killed himself.” Pansy can’t help it. She flinches. She hasn’t had any Wood nightmares recently, but the memories are still sharp in her mind.
“Yes, because we’d stopped Voldemort from getting the Philosopher’s Stone,” Harry said. They had all stopped walking now and were just standing in a circle in the middle of the dungeon corridor. Pansy was twisting the sleeve of her jumper in her hands.
“Nothing,” Draco said. “I stole it. Or, rather, borrowed without officially checking it out. There was no way I was letting her know what I was reading. Librarians are terrible gossips.” Harry nodded, deciding not to push it further. “But suffice to say, I learned all the pertinent spells. And, uh, studied the diagrams.”
Harry and Draco do not manage to get anyone on recording stating that they’re part of an international crime ring. The Battaglia family are not idiots. They know what not to talk about in public settings. But the evening is not a waste of their time. Both Draco and Harry have recording spells running the entire night, and they capture a lot of faces, along with a lot of innocuous, but perhaps not so innocuous, conversations. Draco sparks all night long, so much so that he feels like he needs to empty his brain. Luckily, Harry brought along pensieve phials, so Draco excuses himself to run to the restroom, where he puts thought after thought and memory after memory into every single phial Harry had handed him.
mentioned to Harry, was that thing he had to do. He hadn’t mentioned it to anyone really. Sure, Vince and Greg knew that
“I don’t see anyone else around,” Pansy said. “It’s not the kind of thing you can owl someone about.”
He looks back at the laptop screen and his heart leaps. There’s a dot on a map and it’s moving. He gestures for McLaggen to come over and the other man does.
“If you die, Potter, they can’t get out of the Chamber,” Snape sneered. “If I recall from your second year, you need to speak Parseltongue in order to get in.”
“Sorry, Harry,” Colin said. He waved his wand at the string and it broke. He fell and flopped down onto the bed. “I was just seeing if I could hang upside down, and then you two came in, and-”
“I just didn’t think you would want to protect yourself against the Dark Arts,” he had protested when Draco asked him why this had been news, before promptly realizing that he sounded like a dick.
Harry threw his underwear to the side and turned back to face Draco. He was nervous again, but not so nervous that it stopped him from snaking an arm around Draco’s waist and pulling them together. Harry felt his cock rub up against Draco’s and he gasped at the friction, burying his head in Draco’s neck.
“Yes. There was one at the very bottom of my extendable coat pocket. It had a note from Hermione on it that said it was for emergencies only. As if I needed reminding.”
“It was a surprise seeing you on the cover of Witch Weekly, of course,” she says once she has a gin and tonic in her hand. “But you looked so happy that I couldn’t help but be pleased for you.” She puts a hand briefly on his arm and smiles at him. Across the circle of people, he sees Draco stiffen. He jerks his head, indicating that Draco should join them, and the blond does.
“Thank you for your time, Mr. and Mrs. Swinn,” Hermione says as she and Harry leave the Swinns’ house. “I appreciate you taking the time to talk to us. Here is my card. If you should need to contact me about anything, please don’t hesitate to fire-call.” Hermione hands over a small square of parchment that has her contact information on it. Sylvia Swinn takes the card with a tight lipped half smile and hands it to her husband.
“Shoo,” he yells at it, waving his hand in the direction he wants it to go, but it clearly can’t hear him over the noise it’s making. It advances further, coming within inches of his toes. Draco jumps to the side and the creature moves past him.
“You know, you’re not as funny as you think you are, Potter,” Malfoy says, still glaring at him. Harry shrugs.
“Well at least I don’t seem to think I’m god’s gift to women,” she snaps, leaning forward to glare at him.
“What are you doing?” Potter asks. It takes Draco a moment to realize that Potter’s talking to him and not to Granger.
Malfoy lifts the glass to his nose, smells it, swills the wine around briefly and then takes a sip. He seems to consider the wine in his mouth for a moment before he nods.
They had gotten back to their hotel at around one in the morning after they had supervised as the Polizia Magica had taken both the Luczkowski and Battaglia families into custody. They had paused just long enough to peel off their clothes before they had fallen into bed and slept until the maid had knocked on the door to inquire about cleaning the room. Now they are enjoying a leisurely continental breakfast at the hotel restaurant and each other’s company.
“If I may interrupt,” Snape said, interrupting. They turned to him. “Why don’t you concentrate on what a, how did you put it? Giant arsehole he is? Sure, it might make him angry, but if it’s something you believe to the core of your being, there are no holes to pick in that.”
“That’s quite the view,” Harry says, breaking into Draco’s thoughts. Draco turns to gaze out of the window. He doesn’t hear Harry walk up behind him, but suddenly Harry’s arms are around him and Harry’s head is resting on his shoulder. He smiles and turns his head so their cheeks are touching. Harry pulls away after a moment, but it’s only so that he can whisper “I can’t wait for you to fuck me in front of that view.”
“Of course, of course,” Draco said. “Did you need some help with that?” He walked over and began to reach for the ties of Harry’s gown. Harry swatted his hand away.
Draco nods and sets the watch down. He reaches over and opens the box. Inside is a large book. Draco reaches in and lifts it out of the box. From the feel of it, it is bound in dragon hide. The pages are gold-leafed. The title on the front reads ‘The Reliquary’ in large, serifed letters, also in gold. Draco frowns at the book. Holding it in his hands, the book feels powerful. He wonders why Oliver has sent it to him. Could it be because he works at Flourish and Blotts?
“Oh, right,” Hermione says. “Of course.” She laughs. “I had forgotten I used to do that.” Harry smiles blithely at her, keeping any confusion he is feeling off of his face. After a moment, she drifts away again and Harry watches her retreating back.
“Should we all come?” Blaise asked. The plan had been for Draco, Ron and Harry to go and the rest of them to stay behind as they could only fit three people under the invisibility cloak to get out of the Hogsmeade cellar.
Potter lets him have his suitcase later in the afternoon. Potter had warmed up leftover spag bol, as he insisted on calling it, for lunch and Draco had spent the entire meal asking Potter what he wanted to do with the kitchen, which had left them both tetchy. Potter had fled the room as soon as was physically possible, leaving his bowl for Draco to clean in the sink.
He walks tentatively over to Malfoy’s side of the bed and puts a hand on the blond’s shoulder. He does not stir, so Harry begins to gently shake it. He gets a slap in the face for his efforts.
“Justin, it’s not that,” Harry said quickly. “It’s just.” He stopped, unsure of what to say next. How does one tell an acquaintance who is probably more of a friend than an acquaintance that you’re dating someone who just a few months prior would have been considered an enemy? Particularly when it was supposed to be a secret. It was difficult. But Justin was frowning at him, clearly hurt, so Harry had to say
Harry and Hermione find Pansy and McLaggen sitting on the stone wall outside of Winola Swinn’s house.
“Madame Pomfrey and a team of St Mungos’s mind healers will be on hand all day, and all weekend, in the hospital wing for anyone who wishes to speak with them. Remember, there is no shame in asking for help.
“I thought we could perhaps pick back up where we left off.” Harry nodded. His mouth was suddenly dry.
“Uh.” Harry quickly checked his watch. They still had several hours before they expected any people to show up. (Seamus had all but kissed Harry when he had told him where this evening’s party would be. Then he had promptly run off to tell every single sixth year he could find.) “I think the house elves can help. Dobby might, at any rate.” There was a loud crack and they both jumped, nearly dropping the tables they were levitating. Improbably Dobby was there, in the middle of the pipe with them.
He pulls out a pair of jeans and a tee shirt before he stops himself. He looks at them and decides he should look more put together if he is going to be brought into the Ministry. So he stuffs the jeans back in their place and pulls out a pair of navy trousers and a white button down shirt. He starts to unbuckle his belt in the landing, the way he normally would, but again he stops himself. Instead, he walks into the bathroom and shuts the door behind him. He knows that Potter has seen him naked several times in the last twelve hours, but changing somehow feels different.
“Yes, he’s ready,” Pansy says. Draco looks at her and she nods, clearly satisfied that the veritaserum is working.
“How do people feel about Pizza Express?” Potter asks, cutting into her thoughts. She looks up from her nails, which are painted to perfection in scarlet, with nary a hangnail to be seen. She shrugs.
“I actually didn’t mean to make the joke. I meant that this place is awesome.” Draco looks around the room, eyes wide.
“Wonderful,” Harry said. “No one can stare and suspect things if there’s only one table.” He nudged Draco gently with his shoulder. “Sit next to me?”
“I love you too, Harry,” Draco said. A smile spread across his face and Harry leaned in and kissed him again.
“Holy shit, Potter,” he breathes. Harry glances upward for a moment and Draco thinks he can see triumph in his eyes.
“It would appear so,” Dumbledore said. Draco’s heart sank. Dumbledore had walked over to them in the time that it had taken Harry to dress and stand up and was now looking thoughtfully at the two of them. “But he’s also not dead.” Harry released Draco and they both turned to stare Dumbledore.
His sentimental thoughts are interrupted by the arrival of dessert. One minute, there is nothing in the middle of the table and the next there is a towering cake covered in whipped cream, chocolate shavings and cherries.
“I suppose it’s so they can recognize each other,” McLaggen says. “Or perhaps it's a way of showing which people are loyal to their cause?”
“He did what he felt he needed to do to keep the Reliquary safe and out of the Society’s hands,” McLaggen says.
“You know I’m not moving in with you, right?” Draco isn’t sure if he even would if Potter asked. Not that he would ask.
“Am I really getting dating advice from Draco Malfoy?” Neville asked before his brain could tell him not to say it.
“It’s not showing off if we asked to see it,” Blaise assured her. Hermione sighed but stood up and pulled out her wand.
“You’re so fucking presumptuous,” Pansy says. She slides out of the booth and drains the last of her drink. McLaggen hasn’t moved. He is still leaning over the table, staring dumbly at her. She almost slaps him again. She can’t believe that she briefly thought about sleeping with him. What had come over her?
“No,” Massi cries. “You should definitely stay. Yes, you should stay all night. And as I said earlier, you should forget your hotel and stay with us.” Harry catches Draco’s eye over Massi’s shoulder and raises his eyebrows. Draco stares back at him and after a long moment, Harry nods.
Harry glances quickly around the room as they fall forward and spots and astonished Gregory Goyle sitting on the sofa. Pretending he has not seen him, he steadies the two of them and then on the pretense of reaching up to brush some dust out of Malfoy’s hair, he pulls the blond’s face close and presses their mouths together. If Malfoy is surprised, he doesn’t show it, instead eagerly kissing Harry in return.
Speaking of Susan, she had followed Hermione out to the main room and is now standing awkwardly by the mouth of the corridor.
“Right, but I think I’ve spotted a pattern. Starting with the murder that Potter and Malfoy walked in on,” McLaggen says.
“This Wunderkammer is the largest collection of magical artifacts on the continent,” Massi says proudly.
“Definitely.” And before Harry could say anything, Draco’s hand was on his crotch. Draco gave a small chuckle when he felt how hard Harry was and then he deftly undid the top button of Harry’s trousers.
“You were meant to bring it up more subtly, Har.” Harry laughs because it’s true. He really should have, but Ron has saved his bacon. Hermione sighs and puts down her knife and fork.
By the time they’ve finished with all their crackers, Draco is wearing a knitted hat shaped like a frog, topped with large, knitted googly eyes, Narcissa is wearing a silver sequined beret, and Lucius has a flower festooned, wide brimmed hat that Harry thinks would not be out of place at Ascot. Everyone seems pleased with their hats and their gifts and so they all tuck into the main course — beef tenderloin, roast potatoes and creamed spinach — with gusto.
“Fine. But no one wants to talk about work, Harry. I want to hear about you two.” He gestures between Harry and Draco. “When Hermione told me you were together, I didn’t believe her until she showed me the Witch Weekly cover and then it was hard
You would think with social isolation that I would have more time to write. Somehow you would be wrong. XD Trying to stick to the same posting schedule for now.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. He felt like he needed to step in and defend himself. “But excuse me for not wanting all of our sexual encounters to be in a dusty storeroom and what is ostensibly a classroom.”
“In which case, why don’t we work together to make sure it doesn’t happen,” he said. Draco raised an eyebrow.
It took the better part of the day, but Dumbledore and Snape brought the six of them up to speed on all that they knew. Harry felt like Dumbledore was still holding something back, but he couldn’t be sure. At any rate, Harry thought he knew all that he needed to about horcruxes to be getting on with.
“Fuck you. No, it wasn’t.” Draco and Pansy are both now watching their conversation with interest; the Simurgh Society is momentarily forgotten.
“Fine. What do you want me to do.” He draws out a quick sketch of where each genre of book goes. She nods once more at him and then gets started. While she sifts through the pile of books, Draco pulls out a copy of today’s Daily Prophet and starts to flip through it.
“I love the swamp,” someone yelled from the Hufflepuff table. McGonagall turned her head towards the Hufflepuffs, the smallest of smiles on her face.
The rest of the day passed uneventfully for Harry, until dinnertime, at which point, Ron sat down opposite him, crossed his arms and glared at him.
“Where’s Harry?” Ron asked, looking around the common room. Hermione looked up from the game of Gobstones she was playing with Neville.
“Oh,” Ron said, clearly disappointed that this had not been news to his new friends. And then he realized that he had thought of them as his new friends and he wasn’t sure how he felt about it.
He shuts the bathroom door behind him and releases the tension he had not realized he was carrying in his shoulders. He is not sure why Malfoy still makes him so nervous but he sure as hell does. He sighs and shrugs out of his bathrobe. He turns on the shower and brushes his teeth while he waits for the shower to warm up.
“Unless you’re scared,” he says. He hopes that Massi will take the bait. Draco will feel better about the whole thing if Harry is at least involved. There is still a knot of disgust in the pit of Draco’s stomach, but if Harry is there, Draco feels much more like he they will be able to pull this off. Even if the this in question is Massi.
“Uh,” Massi stammers. Draco shrugs and turns to Massi. He pulls the other man’s boxers down and Massi doesn’t protest. He looks him right in the eye, unblinking, as he then reaches out and wraps his hand around Massi’s dick.
“So let me get this straight,” Granger says after a long moment. “Mortimer Banks overheard someone talking about this and now the three of you, and at some point
“I just want to know how to get a hold of you all,” Harry muttered. He realized now that he should never have brought up booty calls.
“Another round?” he asked, looking around at their now mostly empty glasses. Hermione looked at her watch.
“I thought it was funny,” Draco says. He stares down at his shoes, not daring to meet Harry’s eye. Part of him had thought it was funny, part of him had wanted to just piss Potter off. He is on edge from keeping up the charade of their relationship, and it’s only been a day.
“How much time did you spend wrapping?” he asked as he pulled out another wrapped item, this one cylindrical. Harry said nothing, only grinned. What slowly emerged from the excessive wrapping was a full bar set, with several kinds of cocktail shaker (two different Boston shakers and a cobbler shaker), strainers, and utensils. At the bottom of the box was a small pile of Muggle cocktail books.
Sighing, she held out her hand and commanded a broom rise to it so that she could inspect what they would be riding. It appeared to be one of the school brooms, and she wondered how they had been acquired. But then, both Harry and Ron played Quidditch for Gryffindor, so she assumed they had “borrowed” them.
Harry swears they are playing Christmas music earlier and earlier these days. But that’s not right. It’s only nine days until Christmas. Of
“Potter,” came a voice from behind them. Harry stopped walking as suddenly as if there had been an invisible wall in front of him. He whipped around to find Snape standing in the door to his office. “I would like to see you for a moment. Alone.” Harry’s heart sank. He was not sure how he had managed to irritate the potions professor this time. Snape probably wanted to ask him alone how they had cheated on their potion, which was not fair as they hadn’t.
“Claudia Fisher. She’s in our year.” Seamus shrugged. “You really ought to get to know the Hufflepuffs a bit more. They’re really lovely.”
Various plates fly across the room and into their cupboards, narrowly avoiding the cups and glasses headed to a different cupboard. All of the drawers in the kitchen open as various and sundry cutlery and other cooking implements put themselves away. A blanket soars through the air, looking for all the world like the muggle idea of a ghost, and then settles, neatly folded, on the end of the sofa. This morning’s Daily Prophet slinks along the tabletop, down the leg of the table and then finally over to the recycling bin in the corner. The table sets itself. A set of tarnished candlesticks swoops out from the corner of the room. They are met in mid air by the silver polish and a rag. Once they are gleaming, they settle onto the table and two dark blue tapered candles nestle themselves into the holders. Another flick of the wand and the candles are lit.
“No, Hermione’s cat,” Draco snapped. “Yes you.” Harry nodded and stood up. Pansy tried to catch Draco’s eye but he purposefully didn’t look at her. He would tell the rest of them what had happened once it was all over.
“Potter,” Blaise said. “You have been blessed by the fact that most people are as oblivious as you are and so haven’t noticed your sudden close, personal relationship with Draco, but if you keep running around after him like a lost puppy, people are going to cotton on.”
“It’s not that I don’t enjoy it. I just prefer the other way,” Draco says. He’s not sure why, but he feels as though he needs to reassure Massi about last night. The lines are starting to get blurred in Draco’s mind.
“We just sat around and chatted. Ernie made us some nightcap negronis. It was lovely.” Seamus narrowed his eyes.
“Of course,” she says. She is laughing so hard that she has to lean on his chest to support herself. Or, at least, that’s what she wants him to think.
the idiot read the damn book. He’s Draco Malfoy after all and the Draco Malfoy that Pansy had known in school did whatever he damn well pleased, consequences be damned. And it seems as though nothing has changed. She could quite honestly kill him.
But he could not deny the fact that the more time he spent with Harry, the more he liked him. Sure, they had their disagreements and he wasn’t sure they would ever see eye to eye on some things, but they got along well. It didn’t hurt that Harry wasn’t hard on the eyes either, even with his forever messy hair and scruffy attire.
“Alright, Dobby,” Hermione said. “Shall we?” Dobby reached up and took her hand and a moment later, they vanished.
“So now he’s off apologizing?” Ron asked. Neville nodded. Hermione raised an eyebrow but did not say anything. Instead she moved one of her gobstones and then it was Neville’s turn to duck to the side, only he wasn’t fast enough and the gobstone sprayed him square in the eye.
“Go on then,” Pansy says. Harry turns to Draco and he nods. Harry stalks off to the bar. Pansy turns her attention to Draco.
And tonight she looked particularly fetching in her costume. He realized that this was the point, as her character from Austin Powers was supposed to be very attractive, but he couldn’t help but stare. It was miles better than his costume.
“Tell me more about this other team,” she says, still lying by omission until she learns more about what McLaggen knows. McLaggen frowns at her.
Hermione found herself tending bar with Blaise and Pansy, marveling at the fact that she was voluntarily spending time with Pansy Parkinson. Pansy and Blaise were keeping up a steady stream of commentary on a variety topics, not least of all was what the sundry members of the school were getting up to in their different parts of the room. Hermione had been tuning in and out of their conversation, depending on what interested her.
“No,” Harry says. His tone is exasperated. “You two are impossible. Professor Quirrell tried to kill my by throwing me off of my broom.”
“Nice to meet you,” Draco says. He holds out a hand, but she wraps both of her arms around him instead, hugging him the way she had hugged Harry.
“The problem with this room,” Harry said to Draco later in the evening. “Is that there are no hidden corners for kissing you in.”
“I know that,” Draco snaps. “But how to get it all organized? I never used to pack for myself at home. We always had house elves.”
Harry hoped that the others had taken care of the snake by this point — no one had gotten word to him about Nagini, but he had faith that Ron and Pansy would stop at nothing. He felt a moment’s pity for Nagini, but she had tied her life to Voldemort, so there was only so much sympathy he could feel.
“Draco.” Narcissa turned in her seat to stare at him. “Could we perhaps absent ourselves to your room?” She asked it as if it were a question, but none of them were under the impression that it actually was one.
“That’s wonderful.” Gillian’s voice sounds far away as Draco decides to lose himself in Harry’s eyes. He leans forward and presses their foreheads together, not breaking eye contact and he feels Harry shift in his arms again. Another flash. Gillian calls out instructions and Draco relaxes into the rhythm of the shoot.
think there are no security wards that will go off if someone enters the building disguised with magic?” Pansy asks. “And before you ask, no, we can’t disguise you once you’re there because the wards also prevent that.”
“Then I suppose you’ve experienced my hospitality first hand.” Narcissa picked up her teacup and takes a delicate sip. Her nose wrinkles briefly in delight.
“Not that it’s any of your business, but yes, I do,“ Draco snaps. But there’s none of the expected pain or nausea that he associates with lying under the influence of veritaserum. So it must be true. Well that’s interesting. But he doesn’t have time to dwell on that because McLaggen continues his questioning almost immediately.
“Can I have four more of these, Dobby?” he asked, thinking of his fellow Gryffindor roommates. “In fact, it might be a good idea to distribute these to the entirety of the Sixth Year.” Dobby looked at him, his head tilted to the side in question.
“Hannah,” Malfoy protests. “He was a big part of my life for almost a year, and now he’s fucking dead.”
“Um, hi,” he said once the intensity of their kissing had subsided some and he was able to pull away.
“Are we really going to fuck on a train?” Draco asks. His hand has lingered on Harry’s cheek, but he lowers it now.
trained to be cool under pressure, but his stomach is trying itself in knots as he stands there and he is worried some of his concern shows on his face.
It took several more attempts, but finally a small animal burst forth from the end of Draco’s wand. It gamboled about the floor, running in excited circles, before running up Draco’s leg and settling itself on Draco’s shoulder.
Harry looks up, grinning like a devil. Draco's erection bobs and his boxers shift around it. His face turns pink. He's not supposed to be this excited about the man he's decidedly
“No, you all fucked off to Scotland or Mayfair after our meeting.” Draco tries not to sound too bitter. He really tries.
But they’ll get out of this. Harry is sure to come up with a plan once Draco tells him what the patronus said. Draco wonders at the audacity of them assuming that Draco is harmless. But it is not the first time someone has underestimated him. Blond harlot. How dare they?
associate, but he doubted either Potter or Pansy would have known that. He was both excited to be important and dreading having to go on more missions. But both Potter and Pansy would be with him, so he was sure he would be fine.
Draco’s heart is hammering in his chest and he is worried he will falter on the walk to the house. But somehow, he manages it. And then he stares up at the Manor itself. All grey stone and gothic architecture. The doors open, seemingly of their own accord, but as he and Potter cross the threshold, a house elf peeks out from behind the oak.
“It was all planned. They recovered a horcrux from Malfoy Manor,” Snape said. McGonagall turned her incredulous stare to him. “Potter was dosed with Polyjuice potion and so appeared to be Pansy Parkinson for the entirety of their visit.”
“From my experience,” Blaise said. “Anytime someone says they’re fine, they’re actually not.” She looked at him and gave him a small, grateful smile.
“I think you and I may have different ideas about house elves,” Harry says quietly. He turns and walks into the maybe dining room. Draco sighs and follows.
“Good luck,” Draco said. “See you on the other side.” Then Harry dropped the tapestry again and he was lost to view.
“Yes and no,” he says. Potter cocks his head to the side in confusion. “Well, because I was still in school when I joined, V thought it would be best to keep that fact a secret, so instead of a full mark, I just got a small snake tattoo.” He pulls up his sleeve and shows Potter the coiled silver snake on his left forearm. “This way if anybody asked, I could say that it was a House tattoo, or something like that.” Potter nods. “And then after…” Draco finds he can’t say it.
He dithers on the bed for a moment, trying to figure out what he should do, before he tells himself to buck up and face whatever horror this is. He pulls himself out from under the covers and creeps over to the door. He tries not to let his hand shake as he reaches for the door handle. The roaring is, if anything, louder now. It seems to be coming from directly outside. He takes a deep breath and wrenches the door open.
Ron sat down next to her, careful to keep his toga covering everything that it should. He was not used to skirts this short. All of his robes were much longer than this.
“I don’t know,” he admits. He frowns and takes a large sip of his whiskey soda water. They lapse back into a silence that’s broken only by the tinny sounds of Christmas music that is being piped throughout the pub.
“Sandwiches,” he says confidently and then tears open the paper. It is not sandwiches, though Harry cracks a grin at the guess. Instead it is a beautiful remembrall that glows red as Lucius holds it.
. He lay the book flat on the table and pointed to something on one of the pages. It was a picture of a golden chalice with a badger on it.
“We can see.” They badger the helpful sales clerk until she lets them share a changing room and once the door is closed, Harry pulls out his wand. First he adds a secondary lock to the door and then he calls the house elf.
“That seems rather mean,” Draco says, walking up to Harry who is doubled over laughing. “Irrational fears are nothing to scoff at, even if they are of spiders.”
Outside, there were multiple grouped chairs, most of which were occupied. Blaise made a face and started to turn back inside when Hermione grabbed his arm.
Draco has thought a lot over the last month about the fact that Harry and Oliver had been lovers. From what he has gleaned from Harry’s infrequent comments on the subject, they had been partners for years before finally becoming a couple just a few months before Oliver was killed. (“Not that that makes it any easier,” Harry’d said.) Draco is still not sure how it makes him feel. He and Oliver hadn’t been together in
“What do you think, Granger?” Pansy asked. She glanced over at Harry and Draco who were sitting in a booth in a dark corner of the room. “Are they friends? Or what?” Hermione shrugged.
“That makes it sound like she routinely watches people in the prefect’s bathroom.” Harry nodded, his lips pressed in a grim line. “I suppose we can just go up to your bed then.”
Pansy picks up her chopsticks and begins to eat. She starts by trying a bite of everything, first a sip of miso soup, then a nibble of salad. Then a piece of tuna sashimi, a piece of California roll and what she guesses is a piece of salmon nigiri, but she could have sworn the waiter had mentioned sea trout? Either way, it is all delicious.
“I’d forgotten about that,” Draco admits. “I remember the match of course - who could forget Krum and those Wronksi Feints? I still can’t quite believe that Ireland won but he got the snitch. Who would have guessed?”
,” Hannah says as soon as Draco sits down. It takes Draco a moment to realize that she’s referring to their ski trip. So Draco does. He excitedly tells her about their amazing room and Harry learning to ski. Both Hannah and Greg laugh for a long time at the story of Harry getting stuck in the snowbank and Draco is glad that Harry is not there to be teased about it in person.
“He threw himself in front of Voldemort’s killing curse and sacrificed himself for me.” Ron looked over at Draco who was rapidly turning pink. “And, similarly to when I was a baby, his love sacrifice meant I survived.”
“Can you be trusted to clean yourself up properly?” Draco asked. “I mean, I know what happened last time.” He started to laugh, but stopped when he saw the look that Harry was giving him.
But really, was kissing out of the question? He wanted to voice this question to Draco but he also somewhat wanted Draco to go so that he could get dressed. He looked around for his clothes and spotted them on his bedside table. He reached over and picked them up.
“This is my boyfriend, Celia. So hands off. His name is Draco.” Draco turns in time to see her smirk at Harry, her fangs catching the light from the lighted mirrors. He turns back to the mirror and notices with a start that neither Celia nor Genevieve show up in them.
“What do you want?” Nagini asked, coiling in on herself. Harry had been right. She wasn’t going to hurt him. At least, not unless he gave her a reason to.
“Do you think she might allow Ron to come to the party?” she asked. If Blaise was a tad put out by this question, he did not show it.
“Make that two,” the blond says. Parkinson nods once and then busies her hands. Harry leans casually on the counter.
“I’m maybe two months pregnant,” Hermione says. “It’s well before the time when we would even normally tell anyone.”
to be where they’re keeping her. He is about to message McLaggen when it occurs to him that if he tells McLaggen, McLaggen is going to apparate over and give away the rescue plot, which would ruin Harry’s plans of Hermione spying for them. So, perhaps against his better judgement - and certainly against protocol - he says nothing and instead starts to figure out how best to get into the building.
“What?” Helena was flabbergasted. “He dared corrupt my mother’s magnum opus?” She paced the confines of the circle in small angry steps. “How dare he,” she muttered. “The nerve of him.” Blaise made as if to say something, but Hermione put a hand on his arm to stop him. He looked at her questioningly and she shook her head ever so slightly. He nodded, showing that he understood. Instead they stood and watched as the Grey Lady became more and more incensed. When she finally said, “That motherfucker”, Hermione decided it was time to interrupt.
“Well,” Harry said. “I don’t know if any of the school elves would have done this.” Ron considered this for a moment before nodding.
The blond gives a small nod. Hannah turns her head to look at Harry again, who feels himself blush crimson. “So what are you mooning over Wood for?”
“Ugh, Potter,” Draco said, grabbing Harry’s waist and pulling him flush against him. “You’re such an idiot sometimes.”
“Should we go in one at a time?” Harry asked. He looked around the room. The “party” was very low key tonight. Most people were just sitting around with their friends, drinking and chatting. In the far corner there was a loud drinking game going on which seemed to comprise of most of the Hufflepuffs and Neville. No one was paying them any mind.
During the afternoon, they played a rousing game of exploding snap and even included some of the other Gryffindors who had stayed for Christmas, namely the Creevey brothers. (Colin took this as tacit acknowledgement that he was now “cool” and Dennis spent most of the game flinching whenever any one of the Slytherins moved.) And before they knew it, it was dinner time.
“Sometimes I intensely dislike you,” Draco says. Potter lifts one shoulder in a shrug. Draco takes another sip of wine.
“If you would,” the man says and turns back to the display. Draco obliges, smile plastered to his face, and then watches from a distance as Big Dick unlocks the wards. The recording spell catches the whole thing, but in the end, the man does nothing, merely looks at the books with Big Dick and then leaves.
Draco gently extends his wand out from under his sleeve and taps the watch, following Harry’s instructions. Small words scroll around the watch face.
“I told him.” Draco crossed his arms and slumped back into the pillows of the couch, a small frown playing about his features.
“Where has this been all my life?” the red head asked, staring down at the bottle, his eyes wide and excited.
“Given that we spend all of our time at Hogwarts and have a very good understanding of the layout of the castle, we can lure the Death Eaters into hidden corridors or trap them in trick stairs, giving us the advantage. While many of them may have attended Hogwarts in their youth, it’s likely been a long time since any of them set foot here.”
“Don’t lick it then,” McLaggen snaps. He is fiddling with Draco’s hair, stuffing it into a wig cap with his wand. “And stop moving, you cretin.”
“If you want me to put it on, you need to leave,” he said. “I’m don’t want you looking at me in this condition.”
“King’s Cup,” Draco suggested. When the Gryffindors frowned at him, he explained that it was a drinking game.
“The South Drawing Room, sir.” Draco nods and goes left down the corridor. He doesn’t say anything to Potter. He doesn’t have to. The brunet is still holding his hand. Draco lets it drop.
“We’ll manage,” he said after a long moment. “We have to.” Harry shifted his knee against Draco’s thigh and the blond looked over at him, though it was clear his thoughts were now elsewhere.
“What are you doing down there?” Draco asks after a long moment. He considers jumping down, but doesn’t want to give Potter that satisfaction.
“Harry.” This was Dean. Harry turned around horrified. He had forgotten that Dean was in the room. “Why
“Please.” They stood and made their way back inside. As they opened the door to the main room, a wall of music washed over them. Harry blinked, alarmed, and waited for his eyes to readjust to the dimly lit room.
“Either way, it’s irrelevant because any good opti-wizard would tell you that you need to wait until you’re an adult and your prescription has stabilized,” Draco said.
“Right then,” Blaise said once they had all taken a sip of their drinks and nodded appreciatively at Draco who had smiled in what was only somewhat of a condescending manner. “Rules.”
“No, Potter,” she says. “Oliver is the reason that Oliver is dead. He did that to himself.” She turns and stares straight ahead, her mouth set in a firm line. Draco drops his chopsticks and they clatter onto his plate, but no one notices.
“It’s,” and here Draco hesitates for a fraction of a second. “Nice.” Potter’s mouth curls into a smirk.
“Snape tried to teach me last year, but it didn't go well.” Harry said. “Actually that's an understatement. It went terribly. I kept getting angry, which, as I understand it, makes it worse.”
“Because you knew he might die.” It was not a question. Dumbledore shook his head and Draco frowned.
“Is it about the murder?” Harry asks. He might as well ask the blunt question. Or, at least, one of the blunt questions.
“Well, enough of that now,” Dumbledore said. “That is not why I asked you here.” Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry sit up straighter. “I have some bad news. Professor Patterson has died.” Draco felt as though he had been doused in ice water.
Silence met this announcement, though this was not news to anyone. Harry hoped that Dobby would be able to provide the same hangover cure potions that Neville had brought them all the other day. But he wasn’t too worried about the following day, because while it
“Deal.” The grin on Harry’s face is positively filthy. What has Draco gotten himself into? He doesn't have time to find out, because at that point, Greg comes back, precariously carrying three pints and Draco jumps up to help him.
They take a moment to reorient themselves in the center of the bed. Massi ends up on the bottom, with Draco and Harry both hovering over him.
“Exactly. They can hardly print mean things about me if I’ve literally just saved the wizarding world.”
“Look,” Draco said leading Harry over to the bed. “Do you want to do this or not? Because you’re going to have to stop ridiculing me if you do.”
They found Hermione in the common room, reading a book. She was so engrossed in it that she did not look up until Ron put a hand on her shoulder. Then she gave a start and looked around, noticing them for the first time.
“Those bitches,” Massi says. Draco nods slowly. He has been so fixated on the Hand of Glory that he only just notices that Massi is standing in front of him. He is so close that they are practically touching. Massi reaches out and threads his arm around Draco’s waist and closes the space between them. Draco looks the other man in the face and raises his eyebrows.
“Potter,” he said, once he was sure the two of them had added everything into their cauldron and could therefore be interrupted without consequence. Harry jumped in alarm and turned around, quickly dropping Draco’s hand.
Draco is still shaking. With this new information, he has even more questions about Oliver and he can’t decide if he wants to know or he would rather bury his head in the sand. He takes another couple of calming breaths and then picks up his chopsticks again. As he does, he feels Potter’s knee press against his and although he doesn't know if it is deliberate or not, it still has the effect of calming him.
They’d had dinner and were now spending time again in the Slytherin common room, waiting for the potion to wear off.
“It’s a portkey,” Greg says finally, lowering his wand again. “The watch is a portkey. Or, more accurately, it was. It’s deactivated now.”
“Circe, Parkinson,” he says, pulling off the invisibility cloak. “You're going to have to Obliviate every muggle in that restaurant. Let's not make it the whole street.” Harry is more than miffed about this. He really likes the food there, but now he is worried they’ll never let him back in. Parkinson ignores Harry and instead focuses her attention on Malfoy.
He wonders if they are ever going to start training him in more defensive and offensive magic. He had thought he’d heard Tusneem or Croaker mention that when he was brought on board. But as he has heard nothing more on the subject, he is starting to wonder if he had imagined it.
“Good luck,” Harry says as they part outside of the bookstore. He leans in and kisses Draco quickly on the cheek. “See you in a bit.” He winks. Harry has his own role to play in their scheme. He is to provide the edible distraction that will keep Big Dick out of the way while the fort is constructed. Draco grins at him as he walks away and then schools his face into the mask of indifference that he wore so often at school, so as not to give anything away to the manager.
“Did you want me to help you put it on?” Draco had reappeared in front of him, holding the jar of ointment. Harry glared up at him.
“So he can sleep with her and then never contact her again?” Bones sticks her nose in the air. Draco turns to glare at McLaggen, who shrugs.
“Now do it again,” he said. “And really concentrate on something happy. Block out all other thoughts.”
“So where are you taking me?” Harry asked as he and Draco gathered Floo powder into their hands next to the Three Broomsticks fireplace.
He practically flies down the stairs and then skids to a stop in front of the door. He checks the hall mirror quickly and smooths down a stray hair. His reflection winks at him and he rolls his eyes at it. He tugs his shirt down one last time and then opens the door, in a way that he hopes looks casual and not like he is a giant ball of nerves.
“Where was I? Right. He came over and he was, shall we say, less than pleased. And he wasn’t alone. Some of the Death Eaters were with him, and they dragged me out of my room and made me come to their meeting while
“This was a terrible idea,” Draco said to Blaise as he stared at his reflection in the mirror in front of him.
“Do whatever feels natural,” Harry says. Their waiter comes back with the receipt and he spends a few moments figuring out the tip. He is a bit surprised at the total, but then he looks over at the stack of plates that Malfoy has made his way through and it makes sense. As he is signing the check, he feels a hand on his leg. The pen veers off the paper and onto the table as he starts in surprise.
“And, I assume, excessive PDA.” Draco says before he can stop himself. He immediately bites his tongue.
“It might be prudent to wait until Hermione’s scoped the group out a bit,” Harry says, ignoring the look that Pansy is now giving him. Draco is pleased to see that now that Harry has been working with Pansy for this long, he is as immune to Pansy’s death glares as he is. To him, it means that they’re properly friends. Not that he would point this out to either of them. They seem to enjoy pretending they don’t care about each other.
“We can’t let him win,” Draco whispered. A single tear escaped his eyes and made its way down Draco’s cheek. It splashed onto Harry’s shirt.
Hermione made a noncommittal noise as she started working on adding the kitten whiskers. Blaise began to help from the other side of the rune and she looked up at him when their hands met in the middle.
“Don’t push your luck,” she said and kissed him, right there in the entrance hall for everyone to see.
The conversation has moved on to more mundane topics, such as work, and Harry has let his mind wander, but now he realizes that they are all staring at him, so he snaps his attention back to the room.
“It’s your house, Potter,” Draco says. “It makes no difference to me.” Draco glances back and sees that Harry looks briefly crestfallen before his face smooths itself out again. And Draco relents. “Unless,” he says, “you want a proper eye to look at the place. You know, like someone who had single handedly helped Hannah Abbott fix up the Leaky Cauldron.” Harry gives him a grateful smile.
“So we will let you know if our interrogators manage to get any information out of Thiessen about who had hired him and why. Did anyone have anything else to add?” Draco realizes he has missed most of the debrief. He hopes there was nothing important discussed. He doesn’t think there had been, or they would likely have called his attention to it. He is the Reliquary after all.
“I guess we’ll have to explain it now,” Draco says, his eyes flicking to Massi and the women. Harry nods once, his mouth a thin line.
“Fine,” Harry said. “Hide them in the Chamber of Secrets.” Snape snorted derisively. “What?” Harry asked, rounding on him.
“My theory is that someone killed the victims, heard Potter and Malfoy coming, broke the window, jumped out and apparated mid-jump.”
“So, we should go pretend to make out in some bushes like we’re horny teenagers?” Draco points to a large, leafy tangle of bushes a few hundred meters away. Harry seems to weigh this idea for a moment before nodding. Draco clambers to his feet and then takes Harry’s hand and pulls him up. Then he drags him, looking around conspiratorially, to the bush.
“Draco, you’re not even wearing a watch,” Harry pointed out. Draco waved his comment away and went to go get Snape. Harry paced the room while he was gone and stretched his arms over his head. His shoulders felt tight from the stress of holding his hands steady for so long. His stomach gurgled and he checked his watch, which he
“I panicked,” she said. “You took me by surprise and I panicked.” She looked him square in the eye. “I’m sorry. I shouldn't have. And I’ve been thinking about what might have happened if I hadn’t slapped you, all week.”
Cormac has never used a washing machine before. Why would he have any cause to? He’s a wizard. He just waves his wand at a bucket of soapy water and then hangs everything up to dry. Or, when he’s feeling particularly lazy, he sends it home for his parents’ house elf to clean. (If he’s being honest, he does that more often than not.)
“Of course,” Kreachers says. “Anything for Master Draco.” He scoops up the bags, even though they dwarf his tiny frame. “Can I ask when you might be back?” All Harry can see of him is two ear tips poking out from behind a Fendi bag.
“Perfetto,” Massi says. He lets go of Draco’s bowtie, satisfied at last that it looks right. Draco turns to Harry and holds out his hand. Harry smiles and takes it.
“Who wants a drink?” Harry asks. Weasley’s eyes light up and the four of them turn towards the kitchen.
“No,” Draco said firmly. “You can’t make me. Not if Harry is in danger.” As he said this, he reached out and took Harry’s hand. McGonagall seemed unsurprised if displeased by his insistence.
“One would think that,” Terry said. “But she’s not. She won’t even help with homework. Not that I would need help.”
“So anytime that you want to talk to each other, just tap your temple quickly with your wand and say the activation word,” Hermione said, rolling up the two contracts and looking around the empty classroom they had found. Pansy and Blaise had performed the simultaneous spells as Ron had been too worried that he would somehow mess it up.
“On the contrary, Albus,” Snape said. “It’s imperative for Mr. Malfoy’s safety that the Dark Lord thinks that either he or I were the ones who ended your life.”
Draco looks out into the room. It looks like a massacre. There are bodies strewn everywhere. Some people are on the floor, others are still in their seats. No one is moving. And still Harry fires stunning spells. He seems to be firing them off methodically now, hitting every person in the room and Draco finally understands that Harry is making sure that everyone is actually unconscious (or dead, his mind helpfully supplies).
“Actually,” Harry said. “In the muggle world, when people do that with telephones, it’s called a booty call.”
He took the hint and made his way around the Hufflepuff. Once he was next to her, he reached an arm over to her and pulled her into a twirl, before putting his arms protectively around her. As they side shuffled slowly away, Hermione saw Ernie shrug and join another group of dancers.
It is not until they reach the second to the top floor that Draco sparks on anything, and when he does, he’s not even sure how he saw it. But see it, he does. It is a tiny, embroidered, purple Simurgh on the sleeve of the Undersecretary for the Muggle Liaison Office. Draco looks up at the face that the sleeve belongs to and the Reliquary informs him that he is looking at a Mr. Chester Davies.
“Nicholas,” she says and watches as the panic appears behind his eyes. “I don’t know how you expect to get out of this. You were caught redhanded attempting to liberate Flourish and Blotts of some of their most valuable items. We have eye witness testimony that you went to the store days earlier to case the place.”
“Oh, that? I was trying to portkey my presents back to school,” Draco said with a laugh. “It was an awful lot of books and I didn’t want to have to carry them, so I figured I might send them by portkey.”
Somehow he doubts any of his schoolmates have children yet. Or at least, he doubts that there are any Hogwarts aged children. The first few post war years had been a hectic, messy time for the wizarding community. A flurry of marriages, sure, but not many children.
“Mr. Malfoy is an invaluable member of the group,” Dumbledore said. “He has been working with Mr. Potter, Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley, Miss Parkinson and Mr. Zabini on something that they are here to share with you. But first, I have an announcement to make.” There was a ripple as everyone turned to face Dumbledore. “I am dying.” Even though Dumbledore had told them this weeks ago, it still felt like a kick in the stomach to Harry. He found it hard to rationalize that this man he’d known his entire Hogwarts career was going to be gone.
about my worries.” Narcissa’s face twisted in disgust. “She would just tell me that it’s an honor for you to be risking your life trying to—“ She stopped herself there, looking suddenly at Harry.
“I know,” she said with a sigh. “It’s one of the reasons I don’t like it very much. The muggle version is much less violent. I mean, the moves are all the same, but the pieces aren’t nearly so lifelike and they don’t make you feel bad for them.”
Harry. Because what if it went wrong and Harry died? No. He wouldn’t allow himself to think about that now. But if it did, they would have an upset Draco Malfoy to deal with. He could almost see it now. Draco Malfoy, avenging, angry angel, blond hair flying as he cursed everything in sight. He shuddered. It had best not come to that.
“So, whose boss do we take me to?” As soon as he asks, he knows his voice is too fake cheerful. He’s trying too hard to seem alright with everything that’s going on. Because he is sure as fuck
“You trying to make this a threesome, Harry?” Seamus asked. His face was inches from Harry’s. Harry had been so focussed on not getting scraped by the pipe that he had barely noticed.
“Well bloody good job anyway,” she says. “Granger says they’ve been after this bloke for years.” Draco can’t help but smile. He had caught a notorious book thief and saved the store all in one day.
Several hours later, Harry and Draco made their way, giggling and leaning on each other, up to Gryffindor Tower. The Fat Lady clicked her tongue at them when they gave her the password, but she swung forward to let them enter.
“I have to tell you something.” Draco’s words come out in a rush. “Massi took me to the family’s collection of magical artifacts this morning.”
As they walked back down to the dungeons, Harry filled Hermione in on their spy nicknames. He was pleased when she tried to hide her snort of laughter about Seamus’s name. It meant they had picked a good one.
because he needs to talk to Draco without worrying that Massi is going to wake up. He beckons Draco over to him, and Draco clambers out of the bed and then walks around the other side where Harry is. He sits down next to Harry who immediately pulls him into a hug.
“Should we be writing this down?” Ron asked. He stood up and walked over to the blackboard and picked up a piece of chalk. Harry nodded at him and he wrote down
“It’s a wonder you grew up so normal,” Draco says, adding a hint of sarcasm in an effort to lighten the conversation again. He had much preferred the flirting part of their conversation. He is rewarded by a small smile crossing Potter’s face.
“Then just think of this as a spin around the dance floor between friends.” Greg turns them around and they glide over the floor to a cleared space that’s bordered by gravestones. Pansy clutches at the front of Greg’s jersey and he wraps his arms around her waist to stop her from falling.
“It was Remedial Defense Against the Dark Arts,” Harry said. Blaise spluttered his outrage at ‘remedial’ but Seamus just grinned.
“Please, Draco,” he said. He stared at Draco until finally, he relented with a small bow of his head.
“I fell down the stairs. Or more accurately, the stair.” Greg lowers his wand and crouches down next to Draco. “I hurt my ankle and my wand went flying somewhere over there.” Draco points down the corridor. Greg nods and waves his wand in the direction Draco points.
They did not talk much while they worked, only a word here or there to convey what needed to happen next or what they were doing, but it was a companionable silence. And time slipped away the way that it does when you work on something interesting with someone you enjoying spending time with. Before either of them really realized it, they were done.
“Would it be possible to invite Ron and Hermione as well?” Harry usually spends Halloween with them, watching scary movies and drinking cheap wine.
Narcissa and Lucius are engaged in a game of Wizard’s Chess when they enter the drawing room. Draco is surprised. He has not seen them do much aside from drink and sleep since the War. But then, he hasn’t been home in a while.
“This is a very interesting proposal,” Signore Battaglia says. “Yes, I’ve heard through other sources that the break up of Gringotts has been good for various enterprises, what with the regulatory affairs people having to spread themselves so thinly to audit them all.” Draco had not heard that and files away that information with interest while he nods enthusiastically.
“Are you okay?” Draco asks. Harry takes a deep, steadying breath and then nods. “You’re not hurt at all?”
“Whatever,” she says. “Anything in the paper this morning?” He shakes his head. “Good. Let me know if anything comes up.” She moves a step away from him and goes back to listening to Big Dick, so Draco has nothing else to do but the same.
“I'm not overly excited about having them run rampant around the school. Have you met them?” Harry nodded once. “They're fucking terrifying. I've been trying to think of a way of stalling them. And I have one.
“It’s strange seeing her again,” Greg says to Draco once Draco is freed from Big Dick’s office and back in the main store. Big Dick had instructed Draco to train Pansy in the art of selling books. Pansy had nodded and smiled and agreed with Big Dick during the meeting, but once they had shut his office door behind them, she’d told him in no uncertain terms that she did not need training and walked off.
“What’s wrong with a party?” Blaise asked. He had made his way around the table until he was standing next to Hermione and now he swung his arm over her shoulder. “I think it’s healthy for us to forget about our worries for a couple of hours every week.”
“I don’t know,” Draco whispers back. There’s another thump. Draco frowns. It sounds like it’s coming from inside of a cupboard. Had Greg gotten a pet that he hadn’t told them about? Harry picks up his wand as well and they creep into the corridor.
“Mmm, oh,” Malfoy all but moans as he finishes his bite. “These are just as good as I remembered them.” Harry grins.
“What Massi is not telling you,” Harry says, emerging from the bathroom. “Is that he made me drink grappa.” Draco’s eyes flick from Harry back to Massi who looks pleased with himself.
“I don’t know,” Ron admitted. “But as excited as I was by these costumes, everyone else has outdone us.”
“You know what, McLaggen. You’ve told Hermione, yes?” McLaggen nods. “I’d rather wait to hear it from her. I’m not sure if I can stand to look at you any longer right now.”
“Mkay.” Draco would never admit it, but he kind of liked Harry telling him where to touch himself. He felt himself slowly growing hard.
“Also I’m pretty sure that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named would be rather pissed that you’ve gone and started dating his worst enemy and would put you at the top of his shit list and I wouldn’t want to risk your safety like that.”
The room had been transformed into a dark club, replete with upholstered booths, a bar (currently empty) and a dance floor. Music thumped quietly in the background.
“The way I do it,” Draco said. “Is I concentrate on something I want the person to be able to read and I concentrate on that like it’s the most important thing in the whole world. And I think this confidently, because someone trying to read your mind is going to seize on any weakness, as that’s how they will find what you’re trying to hide from them.
“Manners, Potter,” Snape said. Harry looked back down at his lap again. “I plan to ask Mr. Malfoy to join us as he too is quite a skilled Occlumens, and he may be able to explain things to you in a way that I cannot.”
“Like how you don’t want me to die now?” Draco asks hopefully. “Which is why you’ll let me stay as I have nowhere else to go?” Potter scowls, but looks up and nods. Draco smirks at him. “Good, chivalrous Gryffindor.”
“-You’re my son too, Draco. Not just your father’s,” Narcissa said quickly. “You don’t have to follow his path.”
“I see you brought home half the store,” Blaise said. He and Hermione had joined the them sometime in the past few hours.
“You’re welcome,” Draco said. He leaned in and kissed Harry. Harry tasted himself on Draco’s mouth. He finished buckling his belt and then pulled Draco flush against him.
“Let’s see what Big Dick says.” Because he suspects that actually Big Dick might think it looks good. Indeed, several people have walked into the store since he took Jamie aside and are now looking at the tower of books appreciatively. He spots Harry among the onlookers and sidles over to him.
Cormac’s face lights up in a smile as soon as he sees Pansy and he makes a beeline across the room to sit next to her.
“Harry?” asks a voice from the doorway. “Ron? Hermione?” The three of them turn to look and see Seamus Finnegan standing there (dressed as a leprechaun). Harry jumps up, runs to the irishman and throws his arms around him. The three of them pile around him, and then greet Dean Thomas (who is wearing a Michael Jackson Thriller costume) equally as warmly when they find he is standing right behind Seamus. Draco waves at them from afar, but keeps his distance.
The waiter looks at Harry and then at Malfoy, enquiring who should try it. Harry points at Malfoy. He had known that the wine he had brought over this evening had been good, so Harry assumes Malfoy must know more about wine than he does. Granted, that is not hard. Harry knows that he likes wine and that is pretty much the extent of his thoughts on the matter.
He pushed himself off of his stool and put his now empty glass down. Then he walked with purpose towards the dance floor. He elbowed his way into the middle and pushed an exhausted Ernie to the fringes of the circle.
“What about him?” Pansy asks but her voice is heavy. She sounds tired and like she has been expecting this question but has also been dreading it.
Pansy stares at the completed evidence board and her jaw drops open. She can’t help it. Laid out this way, it’s incredibly obvious that something is afoot.
Ron greets them all at the door. He frowns for a moment when he sees Draco, but he waves them both inside.
“Of course,” Harry said. He tried to keep the relief out of his voice. He took a sip of his drink, tipping his head back as he was down to the dregs. Ice bumped his teeth and Draco looked over at him.
“Here to socialize with you?” Draco asks. “Yes, I am. While our significant others talk about important things without us.” Draco had not been not thrilled when Harry had told him he wouldn’t be joining them to discuss whether or not his boyfriend would be going under cover, but no amount of pouting had changed Harry’s stance on this. They had to maintain Draco’s cover, after all. Even, it seemed, with the Granger-Weasleys.
He looks at himself in the mirror over the sink. His face is flushed and his hair is as messy as it has ever been. He remembers Draco tangling his hands into his hair while they were dancing, and he fumbles his trousers down quickly, taking his boxers with them. He pretends Draco is pressed up against him on the dance floor again, their foreheads pressed together, sweat mingling. He grasps himself and begins to move his hand quickly up and down. Images of Draco flash through his mind’s eye as he brings himself closer to climax. It doesn’t take long. One more thought of ‘Holy shit, Potter,’ and he comes. His knees buckle slightly and he leans against the sink as he sends spunk onto the mirror. The cold porcelain is jarring on his bare skin and he rights himself quickly. He quickly cleans up after himself, pulls on his pajamas and collapses into bed.
“Tell us about Felix Green,” Hermione says. The name sparks the Reliquary and Draco’s mind is flooded with information about the man. He’s a suspected Muggle arms dealer who amplifies his wares with magic.
Massimo is not a teetotaler, and it takes Harry and Draco all of an hour to get themselves into his good graces. Harry almost feels that it is too easy. But then, Massimo has no reason to suspect them. Massimo has, of course, heard of Harry, which means that there are no awkward ‘Are they a wizard? Aren’t they a wizard?’ interactions. Instead, once most of the Muggles have gone to sleep, Harry, Draco and Massi (as he likes to be called) take three brooms to the top of the Matterhorn and shoot fireworks from the top of it. (They would have apparated there, but they were all too drunk to be sure they wouldn’t splinch themselves.)
“Oh, right,” Harry says, though he looks unconvinced. “Probably.” As if to back up Draco’s statement, they hear a crackle as another set of fireworks goes off somewhere in the distance.
“Oh, you mean Sir Nearly Headless Nick’s Deathday party?” Pansy looked at him as though he had grown a second head.
either,” Draco snapped. He gripped Harry’s arm tightly as if this might stop Harry from giving him the charm. But Harry was insistent.
“Since Professor Snape created them, I suppose,” Neville said. Ron frowned and held the bottle at arm’s length.
Harry stares in wonder at Greg again. He is so changed from the boy he knew at Hogwarts that it is almost like he is a completely different person. He wonders what brought about the change. But then, Harry had never known him in school - not really. For all he knew, Greg had been just as affable when in the Slytherin Common room. Either way, he likes this Greg.
friends,” he says. They are more than that, but he’s never going to tell her that. The thought saddens him.
Wordlessly, the elf handed the horcrux to Harry. Harry shuddered as it touched his skin. He wasn’t sure if he was imagining it, but he could swear he felt something like a tiny heartbeat emanating from the horcrux. He all but threw it at Dumbledore before walking back to his seat.
“A promise is a promise,” Harry insists. Draco has no response to that, so merely nods and takes a large gulp of his martini.
“Aren’t you British?” he asks. “How do you not have any tea?” How could he have gotten himself stuck quarantining in a house with
“It’s good. I like it. Keep going.” Massi is breathless, his voice husky. Draco ups the tempo. He can feel himself getting close, but he won’t let himself go over the edge until Massi has. He begins to work through long multiplication sums in his head - the math taking his mind off of the rising pleasure for a moment. It is one of the reasons he prefers to be on top. He likes to make sure his partner finishes first, and it’s something he’s good at doing.
a few more times since that night. Each of those evenings had started in the Leaky Cauldron and ended in Greg’s bed. Pansy thinks she could get used to this. Not that she will admit it to anyone, least of all Greg.
“But thanks to misogynistic historians, we don’t know what either Helga Hufflepuff or Rowena Ravenclaw’s specific contributions were,” Hermione finished.
“Then what the hell are you doing working at Flourish and Blott’s?” He pushes off with one leg and starts to move them around the floor again, holding her tight.
“Not bad,” Draco says, flushing as he realizes how shamelessly his eyes have been raking Harry’s frame.
“Hey, Pansy.” Ron had run out into the entrance hall after her once she had left with the Slytherins after dinner. Blaise, Draco and Pansy all turned around.
,” Draco said. He walked over to Harry and sat down next to him. “See, you’re more than just a pretty face.”
They spend the rest of the evening drinking and dancing and not kissing each other. They stumble home around two in the morning, too drunk to apparate and so forced to use Muggle transportation. Draco tries to insist they take a bus, but Harry hails a taxi before they even reach the nearest bus stop.
“So,” Richard says, taking the time to draw out the word and therefore draw out the anticipation. No one bites. “So, the Hogwarts acceptance letters just went out. And the Hogwarts Supply Lists just arrived in the houses of every single student at that school. And do you know what that means?” He looks around at the team. He sees comprehension dawn in Greg’s eyes.
“I think you may be on to something,” he said. “But, back to your original question. The Annual Slytherin Halloween party is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. After everyone has been at the school Halloween party for about an hour, we all sneak off to the Room of Requirement for the
“Because I’m part of the group that’s trying to thwart them. That’s the special team I’m on.” Pansy snorts with laughter. She takes a large sip of her whisky and soda water.
a reason to leave the cocoon of the wizarding world, but Greg has yet to be convinced. Perhaps if Draco can bring home leftovers…
“That and you’ve both stopped denying that your obsession with each other was most likely due to you two being attracted to each other,” Hermione said. “And as you were no longer actively enemies, the obsession no longer manifested itself as hatred.”
Hermione, meanwhile, began reading through her notes again. A small frown creased her brow and Blaise couldn't help but pause for a moment just to look at her.
“Sometimes you just know.” That seems to shut Greg up. Just for good measure Draco adds, “How are you and Pansy doing by the way?”
Leaving the store, Draco expects to turn right and is therefore surprised when Harry leads them the other way. A frown crosses his face while he tries to determine where they are going, but he soon figures it out when Harry stops outside of the newly refurbished Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor.
“What? Of course not.” Harry raised his eyebrows. “I don’t need to talk you into that. I just have to say ‘let’s go’, and you’ll follow me up to the Gryffindor dorms. I’m assuming that’s where we’ll be sleeping?”
“What was that?” Draco asks once the patronus has finished speaking and has vanished. Massi is pale but trying to play it off like nothing is wrong.
“Circe, Greg. Do you really think this is going to make me tell you? It’s none of your damn business.”
“It’s delicious,” Draco said. “I promise.” He was right. Somehow the ingredients blended together in a way that made it hard to taste the alcohol.
“Potter,” he spluttered. “I am not wanking myself off with you in my ear.” Though, if he were being honest, the idea of it sent a thrill of excitement through him.
“Be my guest,” Dumbledore said, waving his healthy hand over the desk and vanishing the papers there. Harry put down the map and then took out his wand. He was very aware of Snape’s stare boring into his back.
“To being friends with more Houses?” Neville suggested. Then they all clinked glasses and downed their drinks.
“We’re going to have to bring you in,” McLaggen says. “You do know that, don’t you?” Harry regards McLaggen cooly for a moment before nodding.
“Have you called the Polizia Magica by the way?” Draco asks. He hasn’t seen a patronus go out, but he’s not one hundred percent sure what Harry’s patronus looks like. He thinks it is big, because he remembers being knocked down by something in his third year when he and Greg (and Vince, RIP) had tried to scare Harry by (stupidly) dressing up as dementors at a Quidditch game.
“Yes, and I can’t thank you enough for those hangover potions.” Neville gave him a small smile and took a bite of his own dinner. “What was in the Hufflepuff common room? Or should I ask
“We,” Pansy said between gasps for air. “We levitated him.” She stopped again, laughing so hard that she couldn’t speak. “We levitated him up the stairs. And - ha - Ron and I could have just come here without any issue.”
“Come on,” she said, taking him by the hand. “Let’s add the next ingredients and then spend the rest of the day cheering each other up.” Ron nodded. He liked that idea. He liked that idea
“They haven’t been contacted by anyone yet,” Hermione says. “But I gave them my personal information in case they hear anything.” Pansy nods, but she catches Harry’s eye and raises her eyebrows briefly as if to ask if he agreed with Hermione’s sentiment. Interesting. He twists his lips slightly to the side.
Perhaps the hardest part of it all is the fact that he has no one to talk about this to. He can’t talk to Greg, because Greg thinks he and Harry are really dating. Same goes for Hannah and Ernie and every one of his other non-Ministry friends. And he can’t talk to Pansy about it because he’s not supposed to feel this way about his handler. Not that he could help it if he tried. And fuck knows he’s tried.
He wonders, not for the first time whether this was a mistake. Should he be staying here? With Potter of all people? But he was being honest when he’d said he didn’t have anywhere else to do, so he’s going to have to make it work.
“It might not be in this iteration of the Room.” Draco narrowed his eyes. “Look, there was a misunderstanding. The Room was left unattended.”
“Then why did you slap me?” Ron asked. He propped himself up on his elbow too, so that he could be at eye level with her.
An image of McLaggen taking an Unbreakable Vow to protect Tusneem and his vision for the wizarding community.
“Have a little faith, Minerva.” He looked over and smiled at her, but this did nothing to lessen the crease between her eyebrows.
“Who wants to destroy the diadem?” Harry asked, putting his arm around Draco’s shoulder. Draco slumped sideways into him and Harry steered him to a chair. Then, as no one made a move to destroy the diadem, Harry walked back into the middle of the room and picked up the sword.
“I didn’t bring it up around Greg because,” Draco starts to say. He pauses and bites his bottom lip.
“Right-o, boss,” Greg says. He salutes. Draco rolls his eyes at him. Greg has come a long way since Hogwarts, but his impulse to follow orders from the most important person around him has been harder to shake. Draco reaches up and put his arm around Greg’s shoulder. It is a difficult feat as Greg is a good six inches taller than Draco.
“Hang on,” George said, leaning forward so that he could look both Harry and Draco in the face. “Are you two,” he trailed off, his voice rising with inflection as he waggled his eyebrows at them. Draco stared cooly back, even as Harry grinned beside him. “Holy shit, you are, aren’t you?”
aware that we’re dating, yes? Which is a bit of a conflict of interest with the Death Eaters. They want you dead, whereas I want you in my bed. It’s a little different.”
convenient sometimes, he thought as the elf appeared next to him. “Can you please bring us six glasses and-“
“No, Ludo Bagman paid them back in Leprechaun gold.” Draco snorts in amusement. “I gave them my Triwizard winnings for the store.”
“Wait,” Draco whispered as they reached the trap door. “I think I forgot my gloves at the Three Broomsticks.” Harry couldn’t help but roll his eyes.
Once all the Gryffindors had a shot glass in hand, Pansy and Draco joined them, each with their own measure of alcohol.
“How am I supposed to pack for a European sojourn of indeterminate length in a day?” Draco asks as they walk down Harry’s street towards his house. After their meeting with Hermione, they had apparated to the Leaky Cauldron so that Draco could excitedly tell Hannah that Harry was taking him on a romantic getaway. Hannah had gushed and Draco had blushed and now they were heading home to pack before their train that evening.
“It must be difficult,” Hannah muses. “Being in such high demand. I’m not sure I would want to be that famous.” Draco shrugs.
“Erm, good night then,” Draco says. The lights dim and a moment later, Harry hears the soft clatter of a wand being placed on a surface.
“No,” Harry said. “From what I could figure from how they are made, they would need to be portable.” (Dumbledore had been very vague on the mechanics of creating a horcrux, but Harry was decently sure it involved murder.)
Ron cheered up considerably over lunch, particularly as Pansy took it upon herself to spike all of their pumpkin juices. She was so fast that Harry didn’t even see her do it. He made a mental note to tell Seamus about that. Somehow when Seamus did it, you always caught the flash of a sleeve.
“I didn’t realize we had our own currency,” he says. Jamie narrows his eyes. “Look. I’m sorry about all the commotion. You know how Joe and Luca are.” But Jamie just shakes his head. Then he puts a hand on Draco’s shoulder and looks at him earnestly.
“So you don’t care about the Dark Lord?” Draco asked so quietly that Harry could scarcely hear him over the crackle of the fire.
The room behind the doors was as imposing as the entrance would have had Harry believe it would be. The ceiling of the room was vaulted and each arch had elaborate patterns carved into the wood. The walls were lined with bookshelves, most of which were filled with leather bound books and protected by filigree iron grilles. At the back of the room sat a large desk with a large, red wing back chair behind it. Harry could not help but stare in wonder, first at the ceiling and then at the bookshelves.
Once his trousers were around his knees, he opened the phial. There was very little liquid in there, so Harry assumed he only needed one application. He wished he’d had the presence of mind to ask, but there was no way he was going to go back to Snape’s office to double check now. He tipped some of the lotion onto his hand and then slathered it onto his dick. The lotion tingled, but in a good way. It was the opposite feeling to yesterday when it felt like his crotch had been covered in fire ants. This felt, well, this felt
Once Blaise had scrambled upright, he followed her lead and they looked around the tunnel in the thin wand-light. There was what looked like a pile of sticks on one side of the tunnel and Pansy walked over to it, squatting down to look more closely. They were not branches, but rather were broomsticks.
“Very fun,” Ron said, although to Harry’s ears he sounded a little put out about the fact that Seamus had not immediately recognized their costumes. Harry realized that they would likely have to stay together for most of the night or their costumes didn’t make much sense. Perhaps it would be a good idea to wear name tags. He voiced this idea aloud and Ron reluctantly agreed.
“I see you haven’t necessarily aligned on ideology then.” Snape watched as Harry and Draco exchanged concerned glances.
turn me on, and that most definitely would. And secondly, because I don't want to scar you with images of how horrible it looks. Oh and I guess thirdly, I don't want your first impression of my, ah nether regions, to be all red and inflamed.” It was rather worse than just red and enflamed, but Harry was decidedly
“That looks much more appetizing than the ones for Crabbe and Goyle,” Ron said. “Crabbe tasted like bogeys.” He made a disgusted face.
“Goodnight,” she said, as she pulled away a moment later. She was conscious of the fact that he watched her down the first flight of stairs before he was lost from view.
“Take it,” he had said. “And promise me that you will use it in the final battle against Voldemort.”
“Do we know yet who the imposter is?” Draco asks from the door. They turn to look at him. He walks into the room and shuts the door behind him. “Ron’s asleep,” he says, jerking his head towards the kitchen.
“So you were with Dumbledore,” Seamus prompted. They nodded. “Eh, you’re probably fine then. I mean, he’s Dumbledore.”
“Well, I guess that means you probably wouldn’t want a foursome then.” Now all three boys turned to stare at Pansy. “What? Just because I put my shirt back on doesn’t mean I plan on leaving here without fucking someone. A girl has needs.” Draco sighed and shook his head in exasperation.
“I suppose,” Draco said. “I guess now when you whisper in my ear late at night when I can’t sleep, I can imagine where you’re jerking yourself off.”
“Don’t be silly, Shame,” Justin said, reaching up to massage the back of Seamus’s neck with one hand. “Sleep is important.”
“Yes. No— I don’t— it’s just— this new virus. I’m quite worried about it. I almost cancelled on our meeting today if I’m being quite honest.” He starts to pace again.
Except somehow, in her mental image of this, Draco’s hair was red. She ground her teeth and put the thought from her mind.
“Very impressive,” Draco drawls, sounding so much like his irritating teenage self that Harry feels a flash of annoyance.
“Potter, I can vouch for him,” Pansy says. Harry twists his mouth to the side in irritation and leans back in his own chair, a mirror image of McLaggen.
“So you found friendship through the power of potions? How wonderful!” Slughorn clapped his hands together in delight.
“No, we’re not coming to you. They’re all here. Yes, Parkinson too.” The voice in the watch says one more thing before Croaker prods the device with a disgusted sigh. No one says anything for a long, tense minute. Then Potter says,
“Right,” Pansy says as she sits down opposite them in the Sporting Page. She is clutching a double gin and tonic. They are sat next to the fireplace at the back of the pub. It is decorated with garlands of holly and above them hangs something that Draco is suspicious might be mistletoe, but he’s not going to point it out. “How long have you two been fucking?”
It was not the normal way that she would have expected to spend her Friday night, but it had been oddly thrilling watching the six of them, who just weeks ago had all but been at each others’ throats, work so seamlessly. (Ron had been there for emotional support and entertainment).
He glanced down at his wrist, but was again foiled by the fact that he was not wearing a watch. It felt as though they had been sitting and eating for hours. He wasn’t overly worried about the polyjuice potion wearing off - that wouldn’t happen until after seven in the evening - but as is the way with British winters, the sun was weak and low and gave him no proper estimate of the time. He hoped that the others were suitably entertained at the Hog’s Head, waiting for them, though he was sure Ron would be worried more than anything else.
“For dessert tonight, we is serving chocolate mousse with blackberries. It is being contained in a white chocolate shell which is being dusted with edible gold.” Harry had to again stop himself from laughing. Edible gold? Of
But then, hadn’t Potter always fought harder for the people he loved? Wasn’t that part of his whole stupid, brave Gryffindorness? Whatever the case was, she would have to wait to question the pair of them about it. They were on a communications embargo while they were in Europe. Emergencies only. And this wasn’t exactly an emergency. Even if McLaggen seemed to think it was.
“Do you want him to be your boyfriend?” Neville asked. He looked as though the word felt strange in his mouth, but in true Neville fashion, he was soldiering on with the conversation, even if he was uncomfortable.
“It’s protocol for ex-Death Eaters,” he says quietly. Harry feels a flash of anger go through him. McLaggen is not his favorite person at the best of times and he seems to be enjoying lording his power over Harry. Harry is itching to pull out his Unspeakable badge, but there is no point in blowing his cover over something that appears to be a common murder. He blows a hard breath out through his nose and nods.
‘You don’t want to do that,’ the voice in the back of his mind says again. It sounds a lot like Harry. Oh! Harry! Draco would much prefer to get on his knees for Harry. But Harry isn’t here.
“I thought that might make me feel better, but it’s done the opposite.” Harry squeezed his hand and Draco pressed his lips into a thin line. At this point, Snape rounded the last turn in the staircase and beckoned them all forward. Harry reluctantly let go of Draco’s hand and they followed him into Dumbledore’s office.
“Dunno,” he says, sitting down next to Draco on the bed. “I left him with that house elf. I couldn’t understand what they were saying, but Massi looked worried.”
“Get off,” he says. “My bowtie is fine.” They cross the street and walk towards the main entrance to the hotel.
“Kreacher is knowing all about pureblood Christmas customs,” Kreacher intones. “He is telling Master Harry to wear complementary colored dress robes.” Draco looks at Harry again and sees that he is indeed wearing dress robes in a deep navy, which complement the rich gold robes Kreacher has set out for him.
By the time Dobby reached the end of his story, the part where Patterson was dragged into the lake by a sea of undead things after ordering Dobby to take the locket to Dumbledore, the elf was shaking. So, Harry was surprised to see, was Kreacher. In fact, Kreacher was clutching the pillow that Dumbledore had conjured for him like a teddy bear and had tears leaking out of his eyes.
It was as Harry had feared. As they were making their way down to the dining room (presumably, Harry was just following Draco), Harry’s scar seared. He gritted his teeth and fought against slapping a hand to his forehead. He didn’t want anyone to think that anything was amiss. Pansy didn’t have a scar, so he had to pretend that he didn’t either. Plus, he figured, he should raise his Occlumens shields. He took a moment to concentrate on brick walls and happy things that had nothing to do with the Dark Lord.
“Kreacher will do that.” He reached up and took the Cup out of Harry’s hands. He looked down and frowned at it. “This is not a normal cup.”
“But what about the heat tracker on his house?” Draco asks. Beside him, Pansy gives a snort of laughter.
“But he’s a civilian,” McLaggen says, slumping back in his seat. “How the hell did that happen? Why would Oliver send it there?” He seems dazed.
So he does what he has always done during difficult emotional periods, and throws himself into work.
“I dunno,” he says. “Ask Wood why he sent it to you? Take it to work and see if any of the boffins there know anything about it? Either way, I wouldn’t open it.”
“Mm, yes, that is a problem,” Draco said. They were lounging against a wall, looking out over all the students. Seamus had somehow procured a record player and was DJing from inside the basilisk’s ribs. Most people were dancing. Harry spotted Pansy and Ron twirling in the middle of the group, eyes only for each other. Hermione and Blaise were sitting together at a table, heads close, talking about something Harry couldn’t hear.
“Sounds like it’s a broomstick,” he said, his face serious for an entire two seconds before he broke into a grin. He ripped the paper off and stared at it. It was not a broomstick. It was a Wizard’s Chess set.
“Uh.” Hermione looks down at her notes. “I’m not sure,” she says after a moment. “My notes don’t say. They only say where the item is being kept.” Harry nods. It is not the first time that an informant has given them incomplete information.
“Oh right,” Pansy says. “That was the match against Slytherin.” She turns her attention to Draco. “Remember Draco, we spent most of the match laughing about how Harry couldn’t ride his broom?”
“We can’t all have affairs with members of the Wizengamot who are fifteen years our senior,” Pansy snipes back. “How is dear Hector, anyway? Has he left his wife for you yet?” Daisy makes a face at Pansy, wrinkling her nose and sticking out her tongue.
Behind the camouflage charm, the storefront to Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Shop looks much the way it did at the end of the war. The windows are boarded up and the door hangs slightly off of its frame. Many people don’t know why it has never been reopened, but Harry does.
Of course, when they get to work, it is anything but a normal morning. As Draco had guessed, he and Harry are on the cover of Witch Weekly. And it is the picture of them kissing. Because of course it is. Witch Weekly doesn’t deal in subtlety. Subtlety doesn’t sell magazines.
“I always forget which ones are the trick stairs when we come back after the summer hols,” Harry added.
He catches lime green movement out of the corner of his mostly closed eye, and opens it more to see Joe and Luca striking poses behind them. He keeps his face pressed against Draco’s for another few seconds and then pulls away. Draco’s eyes are slightly unfocused and his lips are pink and Harry’s heart melts a little bit before he pushes all his emotions down again.
“I can do that,” Harry said. He flipped Draco onto his back and then hovered above him, arms on either side of Draco’s head. “Happily.”
“As I said. We don’t know what he might pick up on.” Hermione’s eyes flash in irritation and she crosses her arms. Pansy stands opposite her and as Harry watches, she ever so slightly squares her stance to face Hermione head on.
“You’re going to explain at some point,” he says. “But right now, I just want you to do whatever you need to do to get her back.” Harry nods.
“All the time,” Draco says, pretending like it doesn’t kill him to admit this. He takes a sip of his coffee to hide the irritated twist to his mouth.
“What?” she cries. “That’s not fair.” He smiles beatifically at her and she glowers at him as she hands over her whisky.
“No feelings and nothing unprofessional has happened,” he says although it hurts. He nearly retches again. He bites his tongue so hard he is worried he will start bleeding. They move on. Draco steals a glance at Harry and thinks he can see a frown on the other man’s face, but the emotion is fleeting and he can’t be sure he saw it. He wonders briefly why Granger asked him at all.
was the idiot that went headlong into the Ministry last year, not Draco. And it was entirely fair for Draco to point that out. It was just that Harry hated himself every day for it. He took a deep breath and thought about how best to put this into words.
He pulls out a credit card and places it on top of the bill without even glancing at it. Their waiter takes it away and Harry resumes fiddling his thumbs.
He finds Potter sitting in the armchair, flipping through a Muggle fiction book that Draco had picked up the last time he was in Chelsea. He stands awkwardly for a moment, willing Potter to look up of his own accord, before coughing quietly. Potter looks up. A smile crosses his face.
Harry was all too aware of how his grades might affect his career, which was why he was so grateful to have Draco as a potions partner. As it turned out, the blond really did know his stuff and he was excited to share his knowledge with Harry. Harry, in turn, was happy to help Draco with the Defense Against the Dark Arts homework that he had been surprised to learn that Draco had. He had not realized that Draco was even taking Defense Against the Dark Arts this year. Harry had thought he had dropped it as soon as he could.
“Someone will take your statement in the meantime,” McLaggen says. He leans back in his chair and motions for another one of the hit wizards to join them. A young woman with her hair pulled back in a severe bun walks over. She gestures for Harry to follow her and he stands. As he passes Draco, he squeezes the blond’s shoulder.
“So, what? I should just walk around the Ministry and look at people?” Draco asks. From his tone, it is clear that he is being sarcastic, but McLaggen perks up at this suggestion.
“Twenty minutes ago? But you’ve been busy talking with Greg, so I’m not surprised you didn’t notice me.”
anything. I was still clueless when it came to theory. Do you remember the lesson where Slughorn had us brew antidotes to his mystery poison?”
“The Slytherin Halloween Party,” McLaggen said, lowering his voice. “I heard you were invited by Draco Malfoy himself.”
He sends a quick message on his watch, all the while watching the man out of the corner of his eye. The man has stopped in front of their rare book collection, which is behind a complicated mesh of spells that only Big Dick can undo. Draco shoves another book onto its shelf. As he does, he realizes, he should try to get an image of the man’s face, so that even if he leaves, they will have a reference. He takes a deep breath, straightens his robes, taps his wand briefly to his temple to activate a recording spell and walks up to the man.
“Excellent job, team,” Big Dick starts to say, but most of the employees have already started to leave, moving as soon as the front doors were shut. Only Draco, Greg and Emma have stayed behind. Draco hears faint yells of “pub!” from the vicinity of the break room. He figures he will join them there later, but he has to get in his evening run first, even though the day has tired him out to the point that he would really rather skip it.
“Wood was Potter’s partner almost from the start. They made an amazing team, which was odd considering they were probably the two most high profile wizards on my team.”
“As much fun as it is to watch you harass your coworker,” Draco says once he is within earshot. “I think it’s best you get back to work.” Joe and Luca fall silent and glare at Draco. Draco shoos them along with his hands and they scarper.
“Usually, but with the Halloween Party on Thursday, I doubt there will be much going on tonight.” Harry tried not to let his disappointment show in his face.
“You were fucking there,” Potter spits. “You were the last person to see him.” At this point, his voice catches and he balls his fists in his lap. Pansy’s head snaps around again.
“Damn it,” Draco said, looking around the room. “Is everyone here making out but us?” Harry followed his gaze around and had to admit, that it mostly appeared that way. Although, he couldn't tell for sure what Pansy and Ron were doing, as the only parts of them that were not wreathed in graveyard fog were their feet, but the positioning suggested that they were indeed playing tonsil Quidditch.
Also yes, I am posting this a day early. I am traveling tomorrow (for my birthday!), so I wanted to make sure it was posted before then.
“I mean just that,” McLaggen says. “We’re going to have to disguise your face, and the best way to do that is with Muggle prosthetics.”
“Come on,” she says. “Let’s go.” He glares at her for a moment but then stands. Harry briefly wonders if it is a good idea to pair them together, but then he thinks that the other option would have been to pair
The walls of the room were lined with bookshelves, all of which were full of books. Harry wanted to look closer at what was on the bookshelves, but he didn’t have the time to peruse. Narcissa gestured for them to sit, so they sat on the chairs in front of the fireplace. There was a fire crackling merrily in the grate and when Harry sat, he felt the warmth from it wash over him.
“I’ll teach you,” he says. “It will be a fun, “romantic” activity.” Harry notices that Draco uses air quotations when he says romantic, and he is grateful for that.
“Right,” Hermione said. “Here is your handbag. I’ve put your wand in there, along with a flask containing extra polyjuice potion. You shouldn’t need it, but I wouldn’t want to send you to Malfoy Manor unprepared. I’ve also put your invisibility cloak in there. It’s in an inner pocket so that it’s not immediately obvious.”
Ron chats idly about the Cannons before, after another twenty minutes or so, he falls asleep, his head lolling back on the cushions. Draco doesn’t take offense to this. He can tell from the shadows under the other man’s eyes that he’s knackered.
“Pity.” As much as he tried, Harry could not keep the amused grin from his face. Draco rolled his eyes.
“Oh good,” came Draco’s lazy drawl from inside the room. “The booze is here.” The Gryffindors filed in and looked around.
The door handle rattles again and another thrill of excitement goes through Draco. The pressure on his cock increases as Harry sucks harder and though he wants this to last longer, his orgasm has other ideas. It crashes over him and he bites his lower lip to stop himself from crying out. He grips the boxes behind him as his knees go weak. Harry swallows it all down and then slowly pulls his mouth off of Draco. He grins up at him, the look on his face a strange mix of mischievous and affectionate. Draco’s heart melts, the way that it always does when Harry looks at him like this.
“You were,” he says again and she nods. “Then you’re perfect.” He leans close and lowers his voice. “Hermione Granger needs discreet medical attention.”
“Then it’s only a matter of time before we have Daily Prophet gossip witches parked outside our house?” Malfoy looks at Harry.
Since his date with Harry, he had become rather intrigued by the idea of Muggle cocktails and had gotten out several books from the Library that Madame Pince had not even been aware were in the Hogwarts Collection. He had studied them in the little spare time he’d had over the past few weeks and convinced the rest of the Slytherins that this party should have only Muggle drinks. There had been some raised eyebrows and concern at first. But then Draco had made them all Piña Coladas and they had agreed that Draco could do whatever the hell he wanted.
it read. Draco looked up briefly at him before turning to Blaise who, like Hermione, apparently carried a quill with him.
“Crucio,” came a voice from behind them and suddenly Hermione’s body felt as though it were on fire. She fell, hard, on the floor, but she didn’t register that pain on top of the rest of the fire spreading through her body. A scream ripped itself from her throat and she yelled as she never had before. She was dimly aware of Blaise beside her, but she couldn’t see what he was doing. Whatever it was, it must have worked, because a moment later the pain abated.
“Well, I wasn’t going to stay behind in Gryffindor tower,” he said by way of explanation. Hermione slapped a hand to her forehead.
, Harry starts to well and truly panic. The entire weekend has passed and the fake Hermione hasn’t gone anywhere out of the ordinary from what he can tell. He had barely slept on Sunday night, tossing and turning as he had imagined what Ron’s crestfallen face will look like if they can’t find her in time. Draco had slept like a baby, which had been more than a little annoying. But Hermione is Harry’s friend, not Draco’s, so it stands to reason that Harry would be more worried about her.
“Of course!” she cries. She claps a hand to her forehead, and smacks herself in the face with her rag. “I can’t believe I didn’t think to invite them. Do you think I should invite other members of the DA? Goodness, I haven’t seen them in ages. I mean, Ernie will be there, of course, but I could invite Susan and Justin and...” she trails off, lost in thought. Harry waits until she remembers he is there before answering.
“Doesn’t look the the ambulance is going to do much good,” Draco says quietly. Harry presses his lips together in a line and makes a noncommittal noise. He pushes the door open and they go inside.
“Yes, well,” Harry said. “It’s Dumbledore. He only seems to tell us things when it suits him, rather than when we might need it.”
“We have all our best portkey tracers on the case, trying to figure out where he sent the damn thing,” Croaker says. “Unfortunately, as one of my agents, he knew what he was doing and how to cover his tracks.” Croaker looks pained and Pansy almost feels for the man. But then, it was one of his agents who had gone rogue and caused this mess, so she is also incredibly annoyed at him. She knows that General Dempsey is too. Pansy can see her boss’s irritation in the tight line of her mouth.
“I'm not that desperate, thanks,” he says. Even though he is. Just the thought of Harry’s lips around his cock has him half aroused. Fuck.
“A message?” Harry sighs. It is clear to Draco that Harry thinks someone else should have explained this to him.
“Tell me about my mother,” Draco says. Potter seems to start at this, and even as Draco is staring at the floor, he can see that Potter sinks slowly down until he’s sitting opposite Draco.
“I think he meant how did you get into this area of the club,” Draco says. He tries to keep the bite out of his tone, but looking at Massi’s smirk has made Draco angry. “What seeing as you couldn’t afford a better room when we were in Zermatt.”
“There’s no one to call,” Draco says finally. “I know who the box is from, or at least I think I do. But I don’t know how to contact him.” Greg cocks his head to the side and frowns down at Draco.
“Well, it was awkward at first,” Seamus said. “Justin slapped me and called me some names, which was fair as this was only a few days after the broom closet incident. Cormac made some excuse, grabbed his towel and left. Justin, by this point, was all wet from the showers and the tears, so I had to kiss him to cheer him up. And, well, one thing led to another, and I was already naked, and his clothes were wet, so they had to come off and-”
“Oh,” he says. “I mean,” he pauses, thinking carefully for a moment. “I could try to take them if you need me to?” But Granger waves this suggestion off.
“It’s perfectly legal if you’re in a private residence,” Hermione said, bustling her way into the conversation. She turned to Harry and Seamus. “Stop trying to make it sound like I don’t know how to have fun. We just have to keep the younger years in the dark about it all. Something that I see the Slytherins do not bother with.” Draco shrugged.
“Seamus,” Harry said quietly, leaning into the Irishman. “I thought you said that Cormac had rejected your advances.”
“A little levitation charm,” Greg says with a shrug. “I’ve been practicing in them all week.” He turns again and skates through the air away from them, then turns and skates back.
“And we have the cloak,” Harry continues. Draco nods again. He has a knot of worry in the pit of his stomach. Harry must notice something on his face because he puts a comforting hand on Draco’s shoulder. “It’s going to be ok.”
If anyone is curious about it, please feel free to DM me. I'm trying to put together a share-able copy.
Professor Babbling began to lecture and Severus began to pace the room, watching to ensure that the students were taking the proper notes. Unsurprisingly Granger was scribbling down everything Beth was saying, even though Beth had confided in Snape that she was one of the top Runes students. Because of course she was. Weasley had a look of mild terror on his face as Beth recounted one of the many ways that adding a Rune to a potion could go wrong. Longbottom chewed his lip nervously as Beth moved onto some of the more insidious ways that a Rune could affect a potion. Even Malfoy, who had napped through Beth’s first lecture, looked concerned. This was good. They were all just the right amount of concerned that they would be cautious with their Runes, but not so scared that they would do nothing.
