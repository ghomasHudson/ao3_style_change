"Well, I never thought that I'd end with a Slytherin. Malfoy no less. Last year and this are just full of surprises." Harry laughs.
Draco knew this could be troublesome for Potter. Last thing he wanted was his Master to get in trouble because of him. He immediately looked at Potter for permission. Potter gave him a nod, giving Draco free reign of what to say.
"Ask who?" Harry asks as if he doesn't know.
"How did you come in?" James asks.
"So, what's the occasion, Potter?" Draco asks him.
"Hook-up, marry, kill. Anyone from us." Theo gave her the choices.
"You should smile more often. Now that your hair is all curly, you look even more gorgeous." Cormac smiles.
"I'm so fucked." Draco sighed.
"But Drac-"
Malfoy stares at Harry for several moments before he shakes his head in a silent no.
Harry bends forward and presses a kiss on Draco's forehead. Draco looks at him and he nods.
Harry takes a deep breath. He can feel the warmth in his chest, of his pet thinking of him, doing this for him. He puts two fingers under Draco's chin and pulls his face up to catch it in a long kiss. Draco, as always, surrenders to the kiss.
"Beautiful. You are truly and utterly beautiful when you submit yourself like this to me, pet." Draco can feel warmth spread in his whole body at Potter's praises.
"I like you. I'm going France for few days with couple of people. I'll speak to the investors."
He's right. And Harry knows he's right. And Harry hates it that he's right so he just nods.
"Hello, Earl. What can I do for you?" Pansy smiles.
"Have your treat, Draco, for being such a good boy. Good kittens get rewards." Harry smiles.
All Malfoy does is nod. He nods and he leaves.
"Yes, child."
"The staring showdown with Potter is what." Daphne piped up.
This is fantastic! There's a D.e. meeting today. I'll try to find out about who Greyback is eyeing on. At present you just get any one kid you can out of this bloody place.
Group Sex
I take out my wallet and hand her the galleons, magic the bags to become small, stuff them in my pocket and walk out of the store.
"And I like to be a pet." Draco replied quietly.
"Potter. Please." Nott requests.
Draco's eyes narrow and he looks at Harry. Harry manages to supress his snort and raises his eyebrows at Draco with a challenging expression, hoping Draco understands and drops the topic. Which, Draco does. He sighs and looks down which pleases Harry immensely. But what Draco does next makes Harry want to spank Draco. He looks up at Hermione.
"Malfoy, you never won against me and you never will." Potter states. But oh how wrong Potter is. Malfoy is going to seduce the shit out of Potter.
"Taxi!" Draco yells as he walks towards the bus stop. He knows he's a wizard, but to apparate, he will have to find a secluded alley and that will take time. As he walks towards the bus stop, he watches Potter, sitting there, reading a book. Why does Potter take the bus? And why does he come this side of the town? Draco can't help himself, he walks towards Potter and stands on the bus stop. A bus arrives and he climbs at after Potter.
"We will need to go France." Hermione says.
"An you couldn't bookh an appointment?" The Duke's eyes narrow. "Ow zid you come zru ze wardz?" He asks.
Suddenly in the middle of the conversation, Theo calls me out.
Draco muses. He's still kneeling there as Potter hands him the shampoo back and rinses it off. He's still kneeling as Potter takes the bodywash and sponge and cleans himself. He's still kneeling as Potter is done showering and he's still kneeling as Potter takes the towel from him. He's still kneeling when Potter takes everything from him and places it back where everything belongs. And Draco, he's still stiff and hard.
Draco and Harry drop Teddy with Madam Pince. Tilly is there with him as well. Draco is really worried as it is his first time, leaving Teddy like that. While they were walking, somebody hexes Draco and he falls down. His head hits the floor and he gets a huge gash. Blood starts to flow from the gash. Harry panics and casts few healing spells. He sends a patronus to McGonagall and takes Draco to the hospital wing.
"Not so soon guys." Theo says and starts searching for something in his band.
So the spell means my bounded slave.
She will. I'm sure she will. You need to rest James. I'll get your homework and notes after this lecture and stay there with them. You can rest then.
Guys. I figured it out. The escape evidence for the kids.
Harry stands besides Draco and starts folding his shirts.
Draco Malfoy is beautiful, he's adorable, he's the best thing Harry has seen yet. Harry is sitting there on the table with a raging hard on. He's been hard since he conjured the cat ears and tail. He never in his wildest dreams he thought he would've liked this but his pet has opened an entire new world for him. He's sitting there in jeans on the chair, eating breakfast with cutlery like a human while Draco is down there on all fours, naked, is eating like a pet animal. It's a beautiful sight. Draco, he realises is still extremely graceful. His crawl, his body language, everything is graceful. Harry is sure that if it was him crawling, he wouldn't have had one fourth of the grace Draco does. Harry doesn't know what he has done to deserve this gorgeous, heavenly creature. His pet who adores him, and even though he hasn't said the words, he knows Draco loves him. Draco is not a man of words. Knowingly or unknowingly, its actions that matters to him and its actions that proove Harry how much Draco loves him. The morning starting with instrumental music, trusting him with his secrets, how he loves to shampoo his Harry's hair, how slowly he's becoming comfortable with his own body, how he trusts Harry to not abuse him and Harry also believes that slowly, Draco will trust him to stop when he says no. Although Harry is certain that he wouldn't let the situation to go out of control that Draco has to say the safeword. They both finish their breakfast in silence. Once done, Harry takes a napkin, damps in a little with water, asks Draco to kneel and cleans his face with the napkin. He unties Draco's leash from the table and leads him back to the bedroom.
We floo to Diagon Alley. I go to a shop that is specially made for kids. I go in and take a trolley. With the help of the helper, I buy some diapers for Teddy. Then I let Teddy choose whatever cups and plates he wants. He selects a set of pink cups and plates. An old witch gives me a dirty look seeing that im buying Teddy, a boy, pink stuff. I glare at her, daring her to tell me something about it. she understands and looks away. I buy some clothes for him as well. I buy a high chair, bibs, towel, few onsies. This shop has muggle clothing as well so I get some muggle clothes for him as well. Teddy kept changing his hair colour to the colours that attracted him. I go to the pay.
"Yes. Your the most expensive wine. Three bottles we'll take with us and one bottle for now. And one of your most expensive whiskey as well. Neet." Draco gave the order with a defiant pout and Harry laughed.
"To Mr Edward Remus Lupin, I leave my house. Until Edward Remus Lupin turns of age, the house will be in custody of Mr Draco Malfoy and Mr Harry Potter.
What the fuck did he say
"What made you change your mind? And why did you have to pretend to agree?"
"Mr Malfoy, I am terribly sorry about this. I wanted a professor who would not be like all past ones. The one who actually knows about dark arts. The next professor who arrives, I'll make sure that they are not prejudiced."
"They ambushed us suddenly. We have never seen them before." Blonde one says.
"Other girls are moving fast."
"We are expelling her. I can't afford the children to think they can just get off easy by just getting detention for something like this. But Mr Malfoy, its up to you if you want to put charges or no. If yes then I'll have the aurors come." McGonagall asked.
"Eh. It had been a while. I was missing it."  Malfoy says bored.
"If you beg so nicely." Potter says and shoves his cock down Draco's throat.
"I meant every word. Each and every word. I like you Malfoy. I always have even when I wasn't ready to accept the fact. I also meant when I said you can say no and I'll listen." Harry meant it.
"Wonderful." Darien smiled then narrowed his eyes. "What racket are you having here? What did you think McLaggen? I'm in the closed office so I won't know anything you're upto? The keys to your flat, who has it, what happens there, I know it all. See, if the aurors find out-" Darien is diatracted with a phone call.
"Change the music Malfoy." Harry said firmly.
"What triggered?" She asked.
"Thank you all for being here." I say in cracked voice. "Andromeda Tonks was one of the best Black family member to exist along with Sirius Black. Within one week of meeting her, she was more of a mother to me than my own mother ever was. I wish I knew she existed so that she would've been my family way before. She loved me and accepted me with her whole heart. She was a kind, caring amd extraordinary woman. I love you Aunt Romie. May your soul rest in peace and you be happy in afterlife. Thank you for everything." I give up and start crying. Belle comes and gives me a hug.
You mean siriusly wrong?
Harry raises an eyebrow.
Where is james?
"Amazing Theo." Blaise said.
"Thank you." I managed to say, my voice cracking. She gave my hand a squeaze, turned and entered the common room. Once I saw she was safely in, I walked towards the Slytherin dorms. The diary safe in my bag.
Potter laughs. Draco can feel rage rising in him. How dare Potter laugh. When he was just about to burst on Potter, Potter told him something that shut him up before he could say anything.
Bee. What's happening of phase 2 operation rescue?
"He wants to get in your pants and I won't have it. I don't like to share." Potter glares at Draco.
"He was badmouthing you after fucking you and I couldn't stand it. The least he could do is not bitch about you after touching you. He got what he deserved." Harry stated and smirked at the stunned expressions on Malfoy's face.
Nipple weights
As soon as he looked up at Harry, his eyes got wide. Harry could see the emotions flicking through Draco's face. The hurt, the betrayal, the heartbreak, and it pains Harry's heart.
"Oh, that's fine by me. I'd rather not hear about their bedroom escapades in Australia." Draco shudders.
As the lunch finishes, I put Teddy for his nap. Tilly is with him. I tell Tilly to keep Teddy safe and if anything happens, take Teddy and immediately come to me, even if she has to apparate.
If I die, I wanna be a ghost in Hogwarts. I'll scare the shit out of people on daily basis. Bliss
Draco open his eyes and flushes a little more. He shyly looks down and bites his bottom lips. Harry's curiosity increases. It's been a while since Draco has behaved like this. More than two weeks to speak of. Ever since the courtroom incident. Harry waited patiently for Draco to decide and tell Harry what he was thinking of. His patience pays off when he hears a weak 'meow' from Draco. Harry can feel his cock harden immediately as he hears the meow. He takes a deep breath to calm himself. 'Go slow.' He reminds himself. It's been a while since they have done anything remotely sexual. Just snogging. There is no way Harry will turn this into another negative thing that happens to Draco. He caresses Draco's cheek again and kisses his lips.
"Harry!" Draco screamed his name again and again as he felt his orgasm rip through.
If only Ron knew that Malfoy being a git isn't the problem. He being a gorgeous git is the problem. He mumbles his goodnights and leaves for his dorm. He enters, only to see a sleeping Malfoy on his silk sheets with soft duvets that he has definitely gotten from home. His hair falling over his closed eyes. Lips no longer has gloss but they still look pink and soft. Whatever Harry expected could've been agruments, hexes, wards up or wands drawn. Sleeping Malfoy was not what he was planning to find. Harry stares at the sleeping figure for a while more and finally leaves to change. He comes back, lays on his bed and again stares at Malfoy. His slow breath going in and out along with Malfoy's. After what feels like hours, he finally closes his eyes and succumbs to sleep.
"How do you know?" Harry asks.
"Well, if that's how she feels then I'll respect that. Okay Harry. I'll take the money." He says.
"We called Belle Bee." Pansy said.
"Stop staring." He snaps at the people in the room and stabs his pancakes.
"Yesterday. Just, pinned me down, said he wanted to, you know, do things to me pinning me down, waited for me to say no but then I didn't say no so he understood and then he was so close and my eyes was close and he came down and kissed me softly while keeping my wrists pinned on the wall and oh Merlin!" Draco spoke real fast.
Draco's heart sank. He knew he had to be careful. The ministry was still keeping tabs at him. And his display of attitude yesterday with the DADA professor wouldn not go uncounted for.
Draco puts his hands around Harry's neck and Harry leads a step forward. And a step back.
In the back of his mind, Draco knew that neither Daphne nor Astoria were amused by being ambushed like this. But Draco was.
"We were talking about potions then Slughorn then the slugclub it escalated from there." Hermione answered with narrow eyes.
"What?" I asked her beaming and clapping my hands excitedly.
"Does it matter?" Draco asks again.
Parkinsons.
"Because I don't have the permission to say yes to you. And I don't even want to. And my boyfriend will not like it and it won't be pretty for you." Draco replies.
"Mom." Bill replies.
"Hello, children." Scorpius smirked.
Harry agrees so he picks up a black leather collar and belt as well and hands it in the basket he was holding. Then he selects a pretty black and red food bowl set and adds it to the basket as well. He gives the basket to Draco and walks towards the pet beds. Without looking back, he knows that Draco is following him. Its not even been 15 minutes and he's extremely hard. He looks at Draco to see that Draco has his eyes fixed on a black and green pet bed. It screams Slytherin. Harry picks it up and adds it to the basket. Draco's eyes light up. He gives harry a shy grin and averts his eyes, obviously liking that Harry is attentive about his likes and dislikes. Harry will get his pet the world if he wants it. Harry loves Draco's reaction as he buys Draco stuff. He makes a mental note to keep getting gifts for him every once a while. Then he takes the basket from Draco, telling him to go stand by the counter. With a small nod, Draco walks away and Harry turns to the toys.
Voyeurism (watching others)
Ron's ears turned as red as his hair as he blushed. Hermione took a drop of veritaserum.
"But Harry does." Christian stated. "He keeps you happy. I haven't seen you glow this way before. It's good. Because if he didn't then him and I would be having some words."
Draco finishes the song. A song he so firmly believes in. If this song doesn't reflect his feelings for Potter then he doesn't know what does. He'll go through anything, do anything for Potter. He'll go through the darkest roads and he'll gladly suffer all the pain even if it's Potter who is giving him. Which he knows won't happen. That is how much he believes in Potter. That's how much he trusts Potter. And even if Potter does turn out to be like those others who hurt him, Draco will suffer with a smile. Because that's how much he loves Potter. Potter, who is standing there on the doorway with his expressions so soft. Always soft, while he's looking at Draco. Always gorgeous as well. Standing there all taller than Draco, with his bronze golden skin and black messy hair, that always gives the sexy bedhead look. Green eyes boaring in to his grey eyes through the glasses. He stands there looking as an Adonis and Draco can't help but be captivated. He never could help himself when it came to Potter. Finally Potter smiles at him.
- Bee
"Just a little. I haven't brought much. Just little fruits and little porridge. Please. You'll feel a bit better." Harry insisted.
"He isn't your son. He's just another orphan you have to keep. Another responsibility added on you when you could have just lived your life freely." Ron said.
He looks at Narcissa and she looks back at him confused.
"Alright." Draco smiles.
"Just shut it and come. Come." Neville says as he drags Pansy on the terrace of some muggle building.
Potter lays on the edge of the bed as he grabs that novel Draco had asked him to read so he can discuss it. He opens the page where it's bookmarked and settles on the bed comfortably to read.
"Hi. I'm Neville." Neville blushes while he introduces himself.
"What will you tell the aurors?" The healer asks once Millicent is admitted and the healers work on her.
"Anything you're comfortable with sharing. Your favorite colour or maybe what kind of music you like? Your favorite disney film?" Zabini asks.
"You know I wont say no to you." Draco smiled back.
"You have the world on surveillance, Lucius, not me. You don't allow me to know anything about my son. Whatever little bit I know about him is what the Prophet and Witch Weakly publishes." Narcissa spat.
The compliment Blaise gave me made me blush. He was so cute. His dark skin and blue eyes. He was beautiful.
And so Draco tells. He tells about waking up hurting and in dark and tied to a chair. He tells about the assault and the minister watching in which the prosecutor interrupts to drive Draco away from actual information he's giving, to which Draco smirks and replies, "I thought you wanted to know what happened. How am I supposed to tell you if you won't let me?" And that shut the prosecutor up. So Draco continued his story and told them everything.
"Good. We'll be Slytherin about this now. Not Gryffindor." Draco says.
"Oh, Mr Potter, you have never reminded me of your father and your grandfather as you do now. I think this is a Potter curse." McGonagall says.
"What is this?" Father asks.
And so Harry explained Nicholas everything. By the end of it, Nicholas was fuming. His trembling hands took Narcissa's and he squeezed it.
"Sev?" I look at my godfather's portrait.
"Three days."
"I think we should get you new glasses as well. Or you can go to St Mungos to fix your eyesight. But I think new glasses should be nice." Draco says.
"Yes, let's leave."
Harry looks at them. This huge group, Slytherins and Gryffindors together. And Ravenclaw. And Harry dreads this. Last time something like this happened, when they all got together, he lost Sirius. He's lost too many people already. He can't lose Draco. He won't lose Draco. He takes a deep breath to gather his courage.
"Eyes up here, looser." Pansy snapped.
______________________________________
Arcane: secret, mysterious, known only by few.
"Yes." Draco replies.
Harry doesn't have it in him to cry anymore. He cried himself dry the day before. Ron holds Hermione's shoulders as she turns to rest her head on Ron's shoulders. Harry feels Draco change his position a bit and instinctively, he strokes through Draco's white long hair, trying to soothe him in his sleep. How can he make Draco feel better? Draco hasn't left Harry alone even for a second. He constantly needs Harry to be touching him, to make Draco feel safe. And Harry isn't complaining. He will sit in this room, forever, holding Draco if it means Draco can feel at least a little bit better. He'll make Draco feel safe as much as he can.
Voyeurism (your Dom w/others)
"Yeah. Listen, if Darien asks, I was with you the entire day. We had gone to watch a film."
You know what? I'll try to. JUST TO SPITE YOU!
Pansy doesn't know how it started. Neville had come to wish her luck for her first day in Witch Weekly and they had lunch. Then, it became a routine. They had lunch together, thrice a week now since past couple of weeks. Somehow, this lunch with Neville became Pansy's highlight of the week.
Neville smiles.
Devil in me- Halsey
"You shouldn't have done this." He spat and left.
"Yes. I just, I just wanted to try it. We don't have to if you don't want it."
"Shut up." Draco says.
"You leave again, it'll be the last you ever do, Potter." Draco said finally.
Narcissa has to tell them to be careful. But how? She will have to find a way to use that galleon that Harry gave him. Only if Lucius let's him be alone.
"We need to test that you are not under any curse or potion and that you're in this relationship out of your own volition." Kingsley stated to Harry, ignoring Draco.
Ginny had said. Harry lost every bit of patience left in him thay day. He went to a wizarding bar, picked up a pale blond man that reminded him much of Draco,  got him home, took him in his bedroom in front of Ginny and closed the door. He had sex with him, making loud noises, making the blond scream, screaming Draco's name as he came. He let the bloke sleep in his room that night. Then he made the bloke breakfast in the morning and sent him home. He didn't bother obliviating the blond, knowing that the blond heard Harry scream Draco's name as he came. Smiled when Ginny cried, completely devastated that Harry got a random blond man home while he didn't touch Ginny nor let Ginny touch him. Rarely even allowed her to kiss him. How could he? He was gay. He told them so many times only to be brushed off as a phase. That when you have a woman, you'll understand. So Harry did the same thing two nights later, got a random blond man home and had loud sex with him with Ginny in the house.
"What if I'm in Slytherin?" Albus asked.
"Well, apparantly there a list of limits, kinks and rules that draw the borders and lines. I didn't know all these things are there like limits and safewords before Christian. He taught me a bit of the stuff. I learnt a lot more with Potter though. We are still learning." Draco replies.
I spoke to Ginny and Luna. We had transfiguration together. I meet them in Gryffindor common room in 30 minutes.
Draco's eyes snap open with a silent gasp. He feels his sleep slowly fade away and wakefulness grabs him. He lays there panting, trying to regulate his breathing in the silence. He turns his head to the right to see the sun starting to rise. Golden, pink and orange hue merging with deep dark blue sky. He sits on his bed and rubs his palms on his eyes. He stares at the sky for several moments and gets up. He picks his clothes up silently from his trunk and walks into the bathroom. He stares himself at the mirror for a while, sneers at himself, picks up his toothbrush and applies toothpaste on it. He brushes his teeth and has a quick shower. He washes his hair, dries himself and wears his clothes. He walks to the mirror, picks out his hair serum from one of the drawers, applies delicately on his hair and leaves the bathroom. He walks to the drawer besides his bed and picks out the packet of cigarettes and his wand from under his pillows. He walks to the window and picks out a cigarette from the packet. He places the pack on the windowsill and puts the cigarette between his lips. He uses his wand to light the cigarette. He closes his eyes and slowly inhales the smoke, cherishes the burn and slowly exhales it, opens his eyes and watches as the smoke slowly disappears in the morning air. He swishes his wand and music fills the room, playing from the jukebox under his bed.
"The children are mine, aren't they?" Darien asks before he walks out.
"Weasley told his family about -" Draco trailed off.
As soon as I read the letter I couldn't help but sob. I clutched the letters tightly in my hand. Belle took the letter and read it. She told everyone with a soft voice. I felt Harry hold me amd cry as well. Teddy was too young to understand anything that had happened.
"Well, Draco, hope to see you next Saturday." Potter smiles.
"Weasleys aren't known blood traitors because they are muggle loving. They are known blood traitors because they gave up on us and our traditions, brought along muggle traditions and supported Dumbledore during the massacre while so many other families died trying to keep the magic alive. Magic is dying in UK, Harry. And we are only some roughly 50 families to keep it alive. All purebloods. Without the riturals, traditions and festivals, magic will die. Our children and grandchildren will all be squibs. It is why I was never known as blood traitor. Neither were so many other families. Potters weren't known as blood traitors because your family supported our cause. Look at it Harry. We celebrate Halloween instead of Samhain. We celebrate Christmas but for what? We don't even know anything related to muggle religions. You know there's a festival that celebrates the she-wolf who took care of warewolves? Warewolves were not a pariah before all of this. Remus wouldn't have lived in poverty and unemployed. So many things went wrong since Dumbledore. Harry, he didn't help us win a war. He just delayed the inevitable he himself created in a less violent way."
"I won't ruin your stuff again. I'm sorry." He hears Draco say quietly after a few minutes of silence.
"Its not all Slytherins. Belle is a Ravenclaw." Hermione corrected.
"Can't be in love with me. I know." Christian breathes.
"Gammy! Gammy! Dwaco toys!" He shouts excitedly.
But all he feels right now is freedom as he watches the blood dripping everywhere over his father and his father's dead, disoriented face. He feels satisfaction and he feels happy. He feels free. He doesn't know where everyone else is but he feels Potter take the blanket off him. He feels as Potter takes off his clothes and he grins at Potter who smiles back at him. He watches as Potter takes the vial of the green salve he watches as Potter carefully applies it to all the remaining scars. Carefully avoiding the ones Draco got from sectumsempra. And Draco watches as he's finally, finally free of all the scars his father ever gave him directly and indirectly. He cries. He holds on to Potter and he cries. He sobs his happy tears because he's free. And now, he truly belongs to no-one but Potter. He's in every sense, truly and completely Harry Potter's and that's all he ever wanted. He belongs to Harry Potter and he's
Saudade- A nostalgic longing to be near again to something or someone that is distant or that has been loved and lost. "The love that remains.".
"Where do we burry her?" I ask in a weak voice.
"Pansy, how's Pansy?" Darien asks, Draco doesn't reply. "Whatever she told you, Draco, she, she told you the truth. I've been with someone since past two years." There's a pause. "There's no emotional attachment. It's, it's a mistake. It's definitely a mistake."
Harry says and motions towards Draco.
Early morning finds Harry waking up to the blaring music playing. He turns his head to see a mouth watering view of Malfoy's behind. His ass skinny but visible in his tight jeans and his knitted top loosely tucked in the jeans. His top drops down from his right shoulder leaving the part exposed. This definitely doesn't help his morning wood. He gets up and bolts in the bathroom. He finds himself standing in the cold shower, willing his erection to die. The metal music can still be heard under the sound of water dripping from the shower. He steps out of the shower and looks at himself in the mirror. His eyes are puffy from the lack of sleep and he curses himself for staying awake and staring at Malfoy instead of falling asleep. He brushes his teeth, wears his clothes, takes a deep breath and leaves the room. Malfoy is still standing on the window. What surprises him is that Malfoy is smoking a cigarette. He walks and stands besides Malfoy, leaving some distance. He expects some sort of comment, some sort of retort but all he finds is silence. He stares out of the window and looks at the view that Malfoy has been staring.
"Harry." He can hear Draco's weak voice calling him.
Agreed.
"I want to go home. Take me home. Please." Draco sobs.
Draco and Harry were with Luna, who had agreed to be their surrogate. Luna was in labour and was finally giving birth. Harry had given her sperm for this. They wanted Luna to be the mother because it meant that there was a chance that one of the child would have white blonde hair. Luna and Draco had similar hair. Luna finally gave a huge push and crying could be heard.
"Why are you looking for men at blind dates though? You can get anyone you want." Neville said as he stared at her cleavage.
Draco narrows his eyes at Potter, who seems like he can dish out orders. Which he can. And Draco will listen. He always listens. That's how his father raised him, to obey anyone who he can. He's been drilled to be a puppet ever since he was a child. And right now he's obeying Harry Potter. He can't help it. He both loathes and loves this trait of his. Loathes because he can't help it when even the dirtiest of scums have used him knowing this about him, thanks to his father who gave him away, literally, like people give tea and coffee to the guests,  and loves because it does take the edge of being in charge and that when Potter speaks like that, it is so fucking sexy. He realises he hasn't replied to Potter for telling him not to play the metal music he likes so he gives a short nod and turns back to look at the view.
Harry slowly picks up one album, places the box aside, places the album on his Draco's lap who is still sitting on Harry's lap and open it. He gasps. He can feel the burn in his eyes as tears threat to sprinkle as he watches a messy black haired man with bronze skin, laughing with another dark haired man wearing a leather jacket who is standing besides another man with sandy brown hair and a huge scar on his face and another man, short, with a rat like face who Harry hates. They all stand besides a hospital bed on which sits a beautiful woman with dark red hair and bright green eyes holding a small child with jet back hair and bronze skin. His hands tremble as he touches the picture. The faces smiling looking at Harry and then at each other. Tears finally flowing freely from his eyes drop on his father's face. There they are. His parents, his godfather, his ex professor and the man who betrayed them, staring at him with happy laughing faces as his mother holds the small child they named Harry Potter. With a heavy heart he realises this is Harry's first ever picture with his family. His real family. He drags his eyes from the picture to Draco who is looking at him, his own tears spilling on his face. He places the album besides him, back in the box and drags Draco into a crushing hug, sobbing so hard that it's difficult to breath. They both sit there, with Harry resting his back on the bedpost and Draco resting his chest on Harry and his head on Harry's shoulder, just sitting there holding each other, not questioning how they were able to give each other these gifts. They sit there for what feels like hours in silence, grateful for each other, holding each other, wrapped in each other's love and just breath.
Victim meaning bound or bounded
"I- I am trans." Pansy sobs. "I have both male and female body parts."
"Obviously Draco. You're not just my pet but my boyfriend as well." Harry said.
"Minnie. Bulstrode spiked Draco's drink with love potion and called him a faggot." Belle said and explained everything that happened.
Oh yeah! Prongs. You're dumb.
"Potter." Draco asked and trailed off. His cheeks tinted pink.
"Do you like him? The guy you went with today." Harry asks because of the masochist that he is. Of course Malfoy likes him.
"I love treacle tarts. They're my favorite pudding." I say. I'm glad I have something to say I like.
"Potter." Draco says, with a little stronger voice. "I want blood lollies."
"Then why do you listen and respond?" Pansy asks.
We are so ashamed of you. We kept you after you being a filthy child
"This is one eventful party." Neville remarked and all started laughing.
He can see realisation hit Cartier as his eyes widen and he swallows. He knows Harry knows. Cartier's breath hitches and Harry can see the gears turning in his brain as he tries to find out to say something so Harry let's him off the hook. As if that's going to happen.
"That's the problem. He never is. I'm surprised he hasn't found about this meeting or about Nick already. But if you find out his sources and finish those, he will have no one left. You have half way through that anyway. You got rid of the people he used Draco to get. There are a lot he has gotten through bribery and other means. Unfortunately, I can't help you with it. My loyalty bonds prevent me from doing so." Narcissa explained.
"Yeah. You've been grumpy the whole night. Wanna tell us what else is it that's disturbing you?" Ron asks.
She looked at me shocked then said she is pretty good at it.  I opened the door and looked out. Amycus was on his way here. I didn't have much time.
"After everything he put us through, Harry? Hermione asked.
Harry's POV
"Glare at me all you want but it's food you're having first. Order a milkshake if you want something sweet along with your food." Harry says gently but firmly.
He feels foolish to ever think that Potter will leave him after everything he has done for Draco. He has smiled a little more last two days than he did the whole week. He has spoken a bit more as well but still is pretty minimal. Only when he has too. He thanks all the gods and deities above that it's Potter he belongs to. Potter doesn't force him to talk. He understands that Draco needs the silence. He doesn't understand why Draco needs it, and to be honest, Draco himself doesn't understand. He just knows that he needs it. He'll come back on his feet. He ways does. And even though he has his friends to help him get there, he has Potter to catch him if he falls. And he is blessed to have all of them.
"Are you okay?" Harry asks Draco once they are in the room.
"Lets just get over with it and leave." He pleaded.
"Uncle Ron and Aunt Mione?"
"Why do you have veritaserum?" Hermione asked. Pansy just grinned and winked at her.
"What?" Draco asks.
The rest of the week passes by. Malfoy doesn't come in the dorm for a minute. He always sends someone to get his stuff. It seems like he has memorized Harry's timetable. He accidentally meets Malfoy once in the dorm when he decided to bunk history of magic. Malfoy awkwardly stared at him for a few seconds, took whatever he wanted from his trunk and left.
Harry understands his embarrassment. He has afterall brought Draco to a pet shop to buy things for him and he is going to enjoy owning draco in Gryffindor red. But he still has to make sure that Draco is okay with it. He won't buy red if Draco hates it. This is for both of them, not just him. He raises his eyebrows in silent question.
"Is your coming in dripping in blood going to be a regular occurrence?" Draco raises an eyebrow.
He is a sadist and I'm a masochist. He loves to torment and I love to obey. After giving me five seconds to breath he again tightens his hands around my neck and chokes me again.
"Define out." Draco says.
"What the fuck did I do?" Weaslette yells.
"Mr Malfoy, tell us your full name." Blackburn asks.
"The ones on your skinny, cute arse are still there. You won't be able to sit for a couple of days at least." Harry squeezes Draco's arse with his free hand.
He can't understand the gaze Millicent gives him.
"You too." Draco smiled. "Last I heard you were in Spain."
Get ready for a lot of teasing.
"Minister, I'd like the permission to question my client under Veritaserum if you and he permits." Blackburn requests.
Draco looks down at the table, his eyes shut, then stands up to walk towards the sink. Darien walks behind him.
I can't believe my boy is all grown up. He's finally going on a date with Red Moony.
"Good morning dear." Astoria replies.
"There is salad for now. You can chew on that while I make your roast."
"Please please please please. Harry!" Draco begs. He doesn't know what for but he does. He needs to cum so bad.
"No. I can't."
"Maybe. I don't know. I honestly didn't think about him that way. He does look fit now."
"You won't see Christian here as well. He's moved to Spain permanently. Mainly because Draco has got a boyfriend." Another voice comes from behind, strangly familiar. Harry watches Draco swallow.
"The things I've been through, the things father has put me through, that was abuse, Tori." He says looking down at Tori's lap. " It wasn't bdsm. It was something that shouldn't have happened at all. I hated every minute of it. But with Potter, every second of it is something I'm glad to have. It's consensual. Something I never believed I had the right to. But I do. I know when I say, he will stop. With all of those people, with my father, I wanted them to stop. I wanted them to stop so desperately. With Potter, I don't. With Christian I didn't as well but with Potter it is something completely else. I don't think there ever will come a time where I will want to say no." He smiles in the end.
Darien takes her to Millicent.
"Did you take the money I had kept?" I asked Bee.
"Bee. I'm fine. Don't miss your classes." Draco says. "Just come after your classes are done. Do the evening duty. And get me notes." He smiles.
Draco has always been an emotional wreck, feeling way too many emotions at once, all the time. But even this is way more for him. His mind provides him the flashback of talking with Potter about Cartier. He remembers Potter's promise to heal every wound. Fuck. He can feel his throat clamp and breathing stop and his heart pound. He doesn't know what to feel. He feels so many things at once. Relief, safety, satisfaction, anger, horror, scared, love. He knows Potter did this. For him. He takes few long, deep breaths and continues to read the article.
I sob on my diary. Its not fair that we have to pay for our parents choices. We will end in brutal way. How do I make sure my Buzzy Bee will be safe? Buzzy Bee. She keeps humming muggle songs whenever she's with me or the group. Its like she's always buzzing around. So I had started calling her Buzzy Bee. There had to be a way to make sure she'll be safe when this all is over and I'm not there to look out for her. Right now I have to check on Luna.
Harry took a deep breath, still not ready to open his eyes, he covered himself in the duvet. He stretched his hand to pull Draco close to him but all his hand found was Draco's side of the bed, cold and empty. He cracked one eye open. Draco wasn't there. He opened both his eyes and scanned the room to find out Draco isn't there. Harry sits up on the bed confused. Where did Draco go? The sun's up and he usually wakes up with the sun. Harry get's off the bed and glances in the washroom. Draco isn't there either. Huh. He walks out of the room and downstairs calling out Draco and Draco doesn't reply. He nears the kitchen when he hears Draco's slightly of key singing.
Reluctantly, Darien hugs him back.
Pansy, Theo and Blaise we're playing with Teddy.
Draco enters the common room with a small quirk on his lips.
"Here for a meeting. Thought I'll stay the week. I'll be leaving tomorrow. Back to Spain."
"Nope. Just some things for my pet." Harry smirked.
"We found the contract." Potter says.
"Come on Sparks, you can do better than this." Malfoy smirks.
"I don't have any problems." He almost yells.
"Of course we do. She doesn't believe in Draco and still sees him as a death-eater." Belle said with gritted teeth. Anger vibrating from her body. Blaise catches her hand, trying to calm her down.
"Liar!" Someone from the crowd yelled.
I brushed and had a quick shower. Once done I ran to my room. I found a pen, yes pen. Not a quill. Its so time consuming, filling the ink again and again. I took a pen and wrote in the diary Theo gave us yesterday. I wrote in it fast.
"If I win, I want you to think about being mine. You will belong to me and me only. Not to your father, not to anyone else, just me. And if you belong to me, then you do not have the right, the permission to say yes to anyone else to touch you sexually. To everyone else you say no. But that is entirely up to you. I want you to think about it very well and tell me your answer. Yes or no, that's up to you."
"You're so beautiful, Draco. So gorgeous." Harry says as he leans up to kiss Draco, hard, fierce as he increases his speed.
"These noises don't disturb you, do they?" Draco asks.
She raised her arm shaking and screamed. “But he’s there! Potter’s there! Someone grab him!”
We lay like that for a while and someone knocks the door. I put on some joggers and open the door while Harry runs to the lou. Its Pansy carrying a very awake Teddy.
Wait no!
"There is no Woodie and I." Draco defended.
"Oh god. Some good some bad. I fucking hate defence against the dark arts. All our school life we had just one teacher who actually I can call teacher."
[The time has skipped. Only two days are left for Christmas break. The entire time has been same. Many people inside and out of Hogwarts have died. Draco kept passing intel from death-eaters meetings. Pansy, Theo and Blaise have successfully managed to steal important information and lists of their main targets and other things. Belle has been able to help Neville, Luna and others for all these months. Draco manages to find out that voldemort is looking for a specific weapon. Its some kind of wand he thinks because they have Mr Ollivander in the Malfoy Manor cells.]
Harry reached Slughorn's office with Draco and knocked.
Draco smiled a shy smile.
"Mum and Blackburn ripped Grant to shreds. He's fired. He did something he shouldn't have done. Even the aurors are fired and Kingsley is suspended. I can't believe Kingsley let anything like this happen. They have to also pay a heafty fine to Draco as a public demand which is bound to leave them bankrupt soon enough. Luckily, the photos were recovered before the press could see it." Ron explained.
I walk towards her and pull her into a hug. She hugs back. With slow pace we all walk towards the great hall. We all walk and look at the breakfast made on the table. There are so many choices to eat but none of us feel much hungry. Half-heartedly I pick up one pancake and some whipped cream. I ate half a pancake amd left rest of the plate untouched. I heard Snape calling us.
"Will you dance for me, Draco?"
"Do not dare repeat this mistake. Get out." Darien sneers.
"Won't be a problem. The hat wanted to put me in Slytherin but I made it put me in Gryffindor." Harry says.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
Harry swallowed hard because all night he couldn't keep his eyes away from Draco. Right now he wanted Draco. He took a deep breath and got up. Everyone watched intensely to see who he would go to. He walked towards Draco and offered his hand. Everyone let out gasps of shock. Belle and Pansy smirked at each other, even though their eyes were wide with shock. Draco's mouth was opened. He froze and kept staring at Harry's hand. Harry could feel his insides burn with embarrassment.
"Oh my god Draco details!" She squeaks.
"Sorry, love. We'll have to go to a hotel tonight." Darien tells as he starts the car.
"Is it like Imperious Curse?"
"Okay then." He says and kisses my cheek.
Third person pov
"Mr. Harry Potter Sir. Please come inside." She pulls Harry by hand and makes him sit an the short dining table. "Phillip, Diane, Tim, look who's here." She yells from the dining room
"Harry Potter. Thank God. Please tell me you'll help us. Please save Draco please save him. He doesn't deserve it. He's the only family I've got. The death-eaters, they killed my parents. I have no one but him. Please Harry please!" She caught my shirt and sobbed looking me straight in my eyes while saying this.
"Albus wrote an interesting letter. About Scorpius and Rose." Harry laughed and Draco groaned.
"It's good I'm dressed up for an outing." Bulstrode pipes up.
Potter's words take slow effect. Potter is slowly calming him, telling him to breath, reassuring he's safe. Potter tells him he's safe. Potter doesn't lie to him. Potter loves him. He can trust Potter. He tries to breathe. He holds on to Potter like his life depends on it, the way it did that night in the Room Of Hidden Things. He keeps his gaze fixed on Potter's bright green eyes, filled with concern.
"She's just trying to help, Harry." Ron interferes.
*Breath Play
"Good night, Mr Potter." Harry smiled, holding Draco tighter and never letting him go.
Harry was speechless. What would he say about this? Dumbledore lead to slaughter? And Salazar Slytherin wasn't motivated to kill muggleborns but save them from the lide Harry lived with Dursleys?
"Nothing for you to worry about, my love." Harry smiles.
"Draco." Harry warns.
Malfoy silently passes the packet of cigarettes to him. Harry takes out a cigarette and places between his lips. He lights it with wandless magic and Malfoy smirks, still not looking at him but knowing Harry used wandless and wordless magic.
"You should listen to him if you want all your hair attached to your head." Rose threatens that girl and smirks as she runs.
"I swear to Merlin, sometimes it's difficult to remember that you're a wizard. The house is an ancient pureblood home, Potter. The house is magic and it's alive. It understands what we need and provides it."
"I'm talking about you attacking him and reducing his dick to mere peanuts!" He yelled. "It's barely two inches now and it was a good six and a half inches. Thanks to you now, its not even two. Why would you do that to him? Wasn't punching him and cracking his nuts enough?"
Draco rests his chin on Harry's shoulder and they just stand there together, swaying slightly.
"Unless you want to remain in your room. That will be fine as well." Harry smiles at her reassuring while Ginny holds her.
"My bus is here, Potter." Draco says quietly.
Blaise took the note and shooed the Hufflepuff away. He might've been a fourth or fifth year. Draco took the note and opened it with a shaking hand.
"Yes?" Narcissa asks.
"Yes. Yes, you are pet. You're mine.  All mine. You'll always be mine." Potter says as he pets Draco's hair, looking at Draco as he is the most beautiful thing Potter has ever seen.
"Bee, I need to say something." He said nervously. Belle raised her eyebrows. "Do you think it is wrong if a boy likes wearing girly clothes? Like panties or crop tops?"
"In my mother's side, we name the boys on stars or constellations." Draco says quietly.
"Can't say I'm upset about that one." Potter chuckles.
Shut up pads. They look cute together though
"Why? Why won't you say no?" Harry asks.
"It, it makes the person under the spell like an actual slave. That person under the spell has to do everything he is commanded to do by the caster. The magic makes it compulsion." Draco says quietly.
"Yeah, I saw her at the Wood's party. Not pug like anymore." Harry replied.
"The hat wanted to put me in Slytherin. But I made it put me in Gryffindor." Harry replies.
"Because they think that the killer is Potter and as I'm his boyfriend, I might have information. So they forced veritaserum to me. Which you know is ilegal even for the ministry to do." Draco replies again.
"I can hear you. Shut your face."
He felt something warm and fluttery in his chest at seeing Potter beam at him like that.
Potter listened to him when Draco said no but its a ruse. He knows it is. No one can stop themselves when it comes to Draco. The abuse, the uglinnes will come out and Draco is ready to be the one who breaks his illusion that Draco can say no. He never could and he never will be able to. Potter does get jealous and angry but he doesn't get angry at Draco. Draco will have to do better. Time to get someone else on his bed. Or well, too many someone elses'.
"You are here for the interrogation of the pedophile killer." Robards inform.
Harry mused. He then with gentle fingers, pushed Draco's hair away from his face and tucked it behind his ear. Then he stared at that sweet arse visible from the net and lace knickers. He sighed and resigned himself to sleep.
"He was asleep before I reached the dorm last night and today he didn't even look at me." Well, this was true.
Sirius can you stop acting childish for fuck sake!
"He said no. Now leave before I snap your throat." Potter growls and boy, how that turns Draco on.
I have no interest in getting arrested or dying, thank you very much
"It's going good, headmistress. Right now we are seeing on how matter works and how it can, it can, it-" Rose stops talking as she gets distracted looking at Scorpius.
"Draco, please." Harry begs.
"Yeah, alright." Darien replies as he shaves.
"They do. But this isn't just about you all being Slytherins. They matter to you. Everyone in that group of yours."
He pulls me by my hair again and pushes my upper half on the bed. I arch my ass up so he has easy access. I hear the plastic of condom get ripped. He catches my hair with one hand and I feel him enter my pussy. He's going slow first and I moan in the slow pleasure. Slowly he increases his pace and I can feel it till my stomach. I move my hips according to his rhythm and moan in pleasure. He then bends down and he fishhooks my mouth from both his hands and fucks me more faster. My mouth hurts from being pulled apart but I don't complain.

"Yes, my love?" Harry smiles.
Draco sobs hysterically, covering his face with his palms. He hates it. Hates each and every second that he is here and he can't help himself. He can't stop showing how weak he is. What's the point? She's dead. Gone. Forever. She will never come back.
"Can we check the wands?" Draco asks.
I hear McGonagall come in but I can't find myself looking up at her.
"You knew!"
"Listen to me very well, Draco. You deserve everything in the world. And all the love as well. Even if you can't give it back." Christian tells, his face dead serious.
"Stand, pet." Harry says and Draco get's on all fours. "Good boy." Harry grins and gives Draco another treat. "Let's teach you a new trick now." Harry says.
Harry, with some effort and pain, casts a patronus. The dragon comes out and he asks the dragon to call Astoria or if any of the Slytherins are down. He watches Draco's reaction at the dragon patronus. Draco's eyes widen a bit as curious but other than that, there is no reaction, whatsoever. Within minutes there is a knock at the door and Harry opens it, wandless. Astoria comes inside and sits on the bed, running a shooting hand on Draco's back as Harry asks her to stay with Draco while he goes to the loo to freshen up a bit. Astoria lays besides Draco, holding him. Harry quickly goes in the washroom and brushes his teeth, and relieves his bladder. He splashes water on his face and wipes it with a face towel and leaves the room. When he reaches his bed, he sees Astoria holding Draco but Draco is in a foetal position with his hands against his chest. There are tears in Astoria's eyes and she silently gets up as Harry climbs the bed. As soon as Harry touches Draco, Draco's hands come all over Harry, holding him tight. Harry holds Draco back.
"That's no surprise. You always did like pinning me down in the preface of fighting." Draco sassed.
He opened the cupboard placing the medicines, he kept the books he got for her at the bookshelf as she started on the tea.
Draco sighs and puts the note in his pocket.
"I'm sorry." Draco said. Not only for the coffee he dropped but for breaking his heart, for pushing him away from England, for not being able to fall in love with him.
"We were?" He asks quietly and looks at Harry with shocked expressions on his fake that Harry is sure are fake. "What?" He yells. "You like Malfoy? Malfoy?" He yells and sobers up. "Nope. Can't act."
We wait will midnight, skipping dinner. My stomach growls but we have more important thing to do. Once we see that the common room is empty, we take that kid out and walk her to the RoR. The door opens. Neville is already there with Seamus I think his name is and Lee Jordan and two children. I tell Luna I have to leave and leave them to their business.
"One normal year without any bullshit is all I want. Is that too much to ask for?" Belle sighed.
"He likes me." Draco said after few minutes of silence.
The blond calls the bartender and orders a drink gleefully which Harry knows is pretty expensive and not everyone will be able to afford it.  Harry gives his card to the bartender to swipe and the blond looks at him intensely.
This shocks Harry.
"She lost her parents in the war." Nott said. "They killed her parents as a punishment in front of her. One of the ways for Amycus to retaliate as he couldn't force himself on her. Her parents died believing she was abused and forced by Draco."
At this point Amycus got up from his seat and walked towards me. He walked in front of my table and asked me. "What is your name?"
Draco narrowed his eyes, took out his wand, pointed at Harry's bed.
While I looked at Bellatrix I saw something unfamiliar. Besides Bellatrix was sitting a 17 year old Draco Malfoy on the staff table. He kept looking down on his plate, his food untouched, his expressions sad and was wearing a scowl. What does that scum has anything to be upset about. This his basically his Christmas. I looked back at my plate and looked at the half eaten pancake. I have to do something. I'm not a coward. The hat was confused about which group to sort me in. I have qualities of Ravenclaw, Gryffindor and Slytherin. I'm not going down without a fight.
This man just arrived outside grimauld place, standing there in his wizard robes. Harry knows for the fact that he doesn't see Grimauld Place 12 but he knows where Grimauld Place is that is a shock on its own. And Harry doesn't even dare think about how Harry will look so much similar to this old man when he grows up.
Harry pushes himself on Draco even more, keeping no distance between them as he leaves yet another mark on Draco's neck. He can't help but moan as he licks the mark he left on Draco's neck, soothing the mark on Draco's wet skin with his tongue. He slowly opens the the binds of Draco's robes as he catches Draco's lips in another kiss. One by one, Harry opens the binds of his robes and they drop on the floor. Harry pulls back to remove the shirt Draco is wearing inside and in one swift motion, the shirt comes off. Harry drinks in the ivory skin, traces every silver scar left on his body by Harry's curse. Harry traces the criss cross scars, Draco's skin warm on his cool fingers. And then, Harry grabs his hips to pick Draco up bridal style. Draco holds Harry's arms and shoulders, his mouth parted and breathing heavy. Harry gently places Draco on his bed and then removes his wet Tshirt.
The flush and flustered look Draco gives is worth the teasing.
Oh. Sweet fucking Salazar. This was something so Slytherin. Draco takes a breath of relief. Potter covered his tracks, he's safe. Suddenly, it hits Draco, Maurice Cartier is dead. Dead. He will never ever look at Draco again, much let harm him. Draco closes his eyes. He's safe. He's safe and he will never be touched by that sick man ever again. He's owned and he's safe. And he can feel himself healing. He can feel it's Potter that's healing him. He let's out a sob and goes on his knees next to Potter's feet. He places his head on Potter's thigh. He cries. He can feel the weight looses in his chest. The relief, the safety, the love. He cries. And it's one of those times he cries happy tears. Something he's done only after becoming Potter's.
"The cabinet?" Bellatrix asks.
St. Mungo's
"Umm, Bee. Everyone except Weasley and Granger knows you." I looked at her confused.
“We had better be certain, Lucius,” Mother tells Father. “Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord… They say this is his”—she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand—“but it does not resemble Ollivander’s description… If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing… Remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?”
Harry summons his bag and lays out a flogger, a cane, a riding crop and few metal clamps. He places the clamps aside and asks Draco to pick one of the spanking toys. He isn't really surprised when Draco picks out the cane. He knows Draco is a pain slut, he'll go for what hurts the most. Finally all the practice he does with the cane on pillows and all the reading he's done about it will come in to practice now. He might be a new found sadist but he isn't outright cruel. He won't go canning Draco blindly. He tells Draco to stand and raise his hands up. Ropes bind Draco's wrist together and get stuck on the ceiling, effectively restraining Draco with his hands on top of his head. So top that Draco has to stand on his toes and will likely be loosing a lot of balance if he wasn't restrained. Harry picks up the cane and walks behind Draco, he raises it and with a swishing noise, swats one blow on Draco's pale bottom.
Harry smirks. He got a feeling that Theo liked Ginny. He was usually oblivious to the things. He hadn't noticed the way Pansy and Luna looked at each other or that they were holding hands. Ginny however, is his ex girlfriend. So this he immediately understood. He nodded at Theo and they started their lessons immediately.
"What do you need?" I nod and ask.
"He's strong, Harry. After a childhood and war like that, he's still strong. He'll be fine." Bill pats Harry's back.
"You wouldn't be insulted if what I said wasn't true. You don't know anything about occlumency and I'm not having an incompetent professor like you insut the skill we occlumence have." Draco smiled a fake smile.
Draco narrows his eyes and McLaggen rolls his.
"Hi Belle. What happened?" Luna asks in her dreamy voice. Luna is so fucking cute I wanna kiss her. Ugh this is not the time for bisexual thoughts Darling!
"Like it was brilliant. But forbidden. He's Harry Potter. He's always just been Potter for me but he's Harry Potter for the world. The world I helped ruin."
"Good for you then, because I'm going to give you pain. But first, I'm going to use that pretty mouth of yours. Get down on your knees." Sparks says after leaving his hair and pushing him down on his knees.
"Potter, I rarely call you by your own name. Don't aim so high that you fall." Draco scrunched his nose.
Rough, large, brown hands took the umbrella from his soft, small ones. He looked to see Potter smiling at him as he let the umbrella go. It had been couple of weeks since he had seen Potter. And that was while he was dropping Scorpius off for another year at Hogwarts. Scorpius, who was friends with his son Albus and godchild Rose Weasley. Potter gave him the book he was holding and stared at the umbrella. He saw mesmerized as Potter wandlessly cornjured a safety pin and tuck it in the loops, fixing his umbrella. Then he heard a honk.
"Do you know he's a metamorphmagus?" Draco asks instead.
"I'm not taking money from you, my child. This is a gift from me." Mr Olivander smiles kindly.
"I am guilty."
"Are you mad at me?" He asks in incredibly small voice, sounding so vulnerable. His voice is hoarse since extremely limited use.
Potter comes close to kiss him but Draco stops him, placing his palm on his mouth.
Harry pulls Draco in to finally give his head support and with a snap of his fingers, the ropes vanish. Harry casts a cleaning charm on both of them and then holds Draco in his arms. Draco curls up in Harry's arms immediately, babbling gibberish. Harry mutters sweet praises as he waits Draco to calm down from his post orgasmic bliss. He gives Draco so many head and cheeks kisses and tells Draco how much he loves him and how proud he is. Then with some success he manages to make Draco sip water and they lay down as Draco keeps floating from reality to dreamland, babbling incoherent sentences. It's only after a few minutes Draco stops and slowly breathes as he holds Harry tight.
Draco gasped as his umbrella broke in the heavy wind as he was coming back from another visit with his Nan. He ran to the bus stop in the muggle street and waited under the shed, secured and not drowning in rain as he tried to fix his umbrella without a wand. He cursed at the statue of secrecy.
"She's got it." Draco says cooing at Nura. The blush at being called pretty human prominent on his cheeks.
"Oh that is so romantic!" Astoria grinned.
"And lipgloss. I think he was looking very pretty." Luna piped up.
Which he does but its not like he'll accept the fact. He somehow manages to fight of the smile fighting its way on Draco's lips. Time to step up though. He can't let Potter win and he still has three weeks to make Potter lose.
"No!" I yelled before I could stop myself. All eyes turned on me. "Please." I said softly. "Please don't curse her." I asked softly but maintaining eye contact.
“But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.”
"Harry?" Hermione entered the kitchen.
He watches as realisation dawns in Ron's face.
"Are you okay?" Harry asks. Draco nods. "You want to continue?" Draco nods a yes.
Draco extended his arm and Belle took it. They walked hand in hand. Draco walked Belle down the aisle, in place of her deceased father. Blaise smiled wide looking at her beautiful bride enter. Pansy walked along with Luna behind Belle, as her bridesmaids. Ginny was taking care of Pansy's and Belle's new born daughter. Blaise stood alongside Theo. Their officiator was Harry and now it was time to say their vows.
"How do you feel?" Potter asks.
"We've got to think of a name." Cormac says.
Draco's POV
"That's what I like about you. Here, have a cake. Draco sent it. You know, Darien wasn't there for his own anniversary? Looking at their marriage sometimes, I get terrified of settling down. Sometimes I think Darien is having an affair, but Draco would've told me if anything as such was happening. We're best friends after all. He always shares things with me."  Pansy doesn't notice the shame and heartbreak in Millicent's eyes.
I dont believe this. I still have family left and I didn't know this. Potter tells me that Teddy is a metamorphosis like his mom. Luckily he didn't get the werewolf genes and I was glad about it. He also said that they had made Potter is godfather. I couldn't help but feel upset about this. Maybe if they knew the real me at that time, I would've gotten Teddy. I'd love to raise him. I'd raise him as my own. And I'd raise him as a good man. I won't put bullshit in his mind that we Malfoys and Blacks grew up learning. After a good breakfast it was time for everyone to leave. Before going out of the door, Potter kissed my cheek. I could feel my insides burning and I blushed hard. After that he left. I could see Belle, Theo, Blaise and Pansy smirking at me.
"Oh that's high of you. You can't keep it in your pants for a minute, trying to get on with anything with a hole. And you have the audacity to tell me!"
Cormac waits outside his house as he hears loud noises from the inside. He had given his house to one of the executives in the company he was working for couple of hours. Those executives came along with their girlfriends, looking for a safe place to fuck where their wives won't find out. Cormac provided his flat in diagon to safely floo and leave when done. He cursed as he heard yet another moan. Hadn't these people heard of silencing charms? It was a wonder these idiots hadn't been caught yet.  After two hours of the noises, the couple finally left. Cormac was opening his door when he heard his neighbour's door open.
Mad hatter- Melanie Martinez
"So, you belong to him now? You're wearing his collar?" Keith asks.
"Not picking up."
"I just. I. I don't. Fuck." Draco swears and then takes a deep breath.
As soon as Harry entered, he saw Kingsley with two other aurors and a mediwitch. Kingsley welcomed them with a nod while the other two aurors sneered at Draco. Harry sent them a warning glare. He would not tolerate anyone mistreating Draco.
I go back to my bed and sit there with Teddy in my arms. Harry comes back dressed in his jeans. Oh his abs on his dark skin. He's just so fucking sexy.
Peter no!
I was just sitting on my desk, reading a potions book and eating a green apple when I saw a girl enter my study and lock the door.
"Harry-"
Draco.
"It's okay, Draco. It's okay. I know you won't do it. It's done now. You're forgiven. I love you. I love you so much." Harry tries again.
"There are so many children. Then there are people our age as well. How do we fit so many people in the Room of Requirement?" She sat down and asked with a sad face.
*Impact/Percussion*
"Draco, can I hold your hand?" Harry asked.
"Darien-" Millicent stops as she watches Pansy watching them. Darien shuts up as well.
"No." Potter smirks, kneads some more and drops his hands.
She loosens her robes and looks in the air for a few moments. Before I could ask her what she's doing, tears start rolling down her cheeks.
"I'm sorry that I took it out on you." Draco sighs again.
"Sod off you lot." I said but couldn't suppress my smile. "I wasn't obsessed with him. And I definitely never saw him that way until I saw him in those leather pants." I regretted immediately after saying this. They all laughed.
"Well boy?" Asks Greyback.
"How can I Gin? Do you not know who he is? Do you think anyone I care about will be okay with me dating him? After everything he and his family put us through? How do you think Ron and Hermione will react?" Harry says quietly.
"We are here for the trial of Draco Lucius Malfoy for the crimes he has done in this war. The charges are as follows; attempted murder of Albus Percival Wolfric Brian Dumbledore, casting unforgivables on Katie Bell and Madam Rosmereta, leading the death-eaters in Hogwarts, kidnapping, enslaving and killing of muggleborns, half-bloods and muggles. We will start with Mr Malfoy's solicitor, Mr Patrick Blackburn." Kingsley Shacklebolt, the acting minister announces.
"No, thank you." He politely declines.
Draco looks at Harry and Harry smiles back to give a nod. So people here apparantly know Draco. He watches as Draco goes up on the stage and the crowd cheers. He watches as Draco talks with her, discussing something that can't be heard. She gives a nod and then gets two guitars drom the backstage then she goes to the mike.
"It's his life, Hermione." Harry cut him out.
Greyback cuts him off. “Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy?” said Greyback menacingly.
"Healer, please no. In the bathroom please." He pushes the healer inside the house. "I'll deal with you later." He tells the prostitue. He pushes the healer in the bathroom.
"Draco, I am not-"
Potter makes a motion as he's thinking about it, then smirks and shakes his head. Draco is glad he isn't being given a proper tug, just light touches and slaps. He wouldn't have been able to control if he was been given a proper hand job.
"Yes." I say immediately.
"Minnie I'll explain but please calm down." Belle said. She looked scared.
"Send me the documents. I'll invest." He says as he turns to run after Pansy only to be stopped by his gran.
"Not much, I'm afraid." Harry answers.
"No, Draco. That isn't true. You might be tainted but then so am I. Everybody is in some way or other, my love. You are exactly the person I want to be with. The only one that I'll ever be with. It's you or no one, Draco. It's always been you."
Silence.
"Mr Theodore Nott. 8 NEWTS and is opening an ngo for abused and orphaned children." The crowd cheered listening to this.
Draco can't breathe. His eyes are wide and his throat feels like its closing up on him. He can hear the maniac laughter. He feels the fear as the visions of that psychotic woman with her insane smile and crooked teeth slowly prancing towards him like a predator towards its prey hits his open eyes. He can feel himself choking on air. He can feel the burn of that fucking cursed knife carving on his chest, branding him as TRAITOR. He unconsciously starts scratching his chest trying to stop that burning like small needles which were set on fire. He vaguely registers Potter saying something and stopping his hand. Suddenly all he can see is the green of Potter's eyes. He still can't breathe.
For the next one and a half week, Malfoy avoided Harry like the plague. Harry was frustrated, annoyed and grim till no end and the fact that the soft instrumental music keeps playing when he wakes up everyday just makes him want to kill the first person he sees. And at this moment he wishes that first person is that ravenclaw boy. Good riddance, says Ron. But they don't know. They don't know what Harry knows even if he doesn't know everything, he knows enough. He's avoiding Harry and Harry has to get back to just watching him from the distance. He spends his evening with Lavender and Bulstrode and Zabini and Nott and two of those girls Harry doesn't know. And Harry hates it. Malfoy has been such a constant in his life. Negative or positive, mostly negative, but he has always been there. Malfoy avoiding him has him wanting to scream. But today Harry won't think of him. Today, Harry will go out with his friends, today, Harry will drink and enjoy, or at least pretend that he is and will not think of Malfoy at all. He won't think about those broken silver eyes and he won't think about his abused self. Harry won't think about his long hair and pretty clothes. He dresses up and meets his friends in the common room. They're all wearing muggle clothes as they're going to a muggle bar. Ron, Neville, Ginny and Luna are particularly excited as they don't really have any experience of being in a muggle place. They are going to a gay bar particularly on demand of Seamus and Dean. Maybe he'll be able to forget Malfoy.
"Leave it be, Ron. They attacked Draco. Added to his scars. Didn't you see the scars on his body?" Harry growled.
"He does not. He's just being kind. It's a stupid gryffindor thing." Draco argues.
"As a sign of respect to my dominant. It's not being in control that Potter loves. It's me consenting and obeying through my free will that he loves. It's that I can not obey him at all but I chose too. And it's not just obeying. It's shit Tori, being in control. It's just too much. Having Potter take control takes the edge off. I just have to follow, it's all Potter's burden to be in charge. He takes care of me and I trust him to give him control. But even the rules we have is mostly related to what I like and dislike. For example, the food thing, I like it. These are all small ways in our non sexual lives that just reminds me that he owns me. Like wearing this collar. And then there is this eye contact thing. You know many people apply rule that the submissive can not look at the dominant without permission any time? They need explicit verbal permission to look at their dom at any point of the day. Or they can not talk unless they have permission. They have to be quiet the entire time unless they get the permission to talk. I'd be miserable like that so we don't have that rule."
[Time skip. The trio is caught and got to the manor.]
[Full moon day]
He ruined my orgasm. I whine in need. I wanted to come but he wants to keep me on edge. He fucks me so slow for another minute. He starts fucking me fast again and I feel myself get close to an orgasm again but before I can ask, he cums. He removes his cock from me and helps me stand. He gives me a small peck on the lips then unties my wrists.
"Thanks Potter." That was all Draco managed to say.
Pansy knocked at Smith's door, wearing a beautiful red dress that shows off her best curves and assets. She's determined to sleep with him now. Three weeks are slow enough, right? It's a house elf that opens the door.
"Don't come near me dressed a a 50 knut whore, you bitch." Lucius sneers.
"You can always try. And if it doesn't work out, you can always be an auror. You're amazing in defence." Draco said.
"Harry don't leave me alone." Draco says in extremely small voice. His face in pain as though he is about two seconds away from crying.
"Can't you pick me up and take me?"
"What do you want Malfoy?"  Ron sneered.
"Every word." Harry replies.
Falling like the stars- james arthur
"Another!" Daphne yelled after draining down another shot.
"What are you both talking about?" Ginny asked.
"Draco Malfoy."  I took his hand and smiled back.
"Mr Potter, are you the pedophile killer?" Blackburn asks amused.
Draco's POV
"Miss Lovegood, is it true that you were kept hostage in the Malfoy Manor along with Mr Olivander and Mr Dean Thomas?"
"Oh good. Can you please make some breakfast for Teddy then?" I ask. Tilly nods her head and vanishes.
"So they can get out?" Draco asks, genuinely curious.
"Didn't you hear? Dumbledore lead a massacre which killed more than 100 pureblood families and he did that with the help of muggleborns. The muggleborns came in our world, killed our people, threw away our traditions, rituals and festivals, changed so many laws, you really, is it surprising that Voldemort manupilated the purebloods into a war?"
After a lengthy hour, they finally say their goodbyes and leave the office. Obviously not without telling him that this news shouldn't travel to Draco's parents. His father was a smart man. Draco is sure he knew what was happening in Britain but then again, his father had made many stupid choices like chosing the wrong side in the war and making Draco take the mark. He looked at Potter and thanked his stars that it was Harry who owned him. He remembers worrying so many nights, crying to sleep that he'd be signed off permanently with someone who will be just how his father was with his mother and him. His mother did try. She tried a lot to keep Draco safe but one command of father and mother put her hand down and backed off. She begged as well sometimes. Never worked. Draco sighed. He couldn't stop himself but turn around and just try to vanish into Potter. His forehead reached just below Potter's shoulder and as much as annoyed he was during the start of the eight year that Potter had suddenly grown more than him, he was glad about the height difference now. He liked Potter being taller than Draco. Just another of the reasons why Potter was the dominant one. He always liked the idea of his dominant being taller.
"I'm Harry." Harry says again. "Harry Potter."
Narcissa just looked at Harry and it took Harry a second to click. Then he repeated the question.
"Well, you're like a younger, male version of your mother." Nicholas chuckles.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy." Draco says in a hoarsed voice and coughs.
"It was the same for me, you know. Ron and Hermione. I gave up on them and that's when it started working out. It's weird, isn't it? Our children best friends while we were at each other's throat at all times. Surreal. Albus complaints a lot about Scorpius."
Harry asks and Draco replies with a meow. Harry pushes Draco down to sit like an animal by pushing on his lower back.
Harry woke up in the morning due to the music blaring in the room. He sighed and opened his eyes. He turned to look at Malfoy by the window, smoking, again. He got up and rubbed his eyes with his fingers.
"In an hour or so." Draco replies.
Draco laughs. "Almost everything has a name, Potter. Even nameless things have names." He replies, his eyes still closed. "What do you like about it?" He finally opens his eyes and asks.
"Harry. We have to tell Andromeda. We need to get Teddy here. He'll be the safest here." Hermione says.
Suspension (upright)
"But it disturbs you, Harry. And, I don't want to be a cause of you being hurt anymore."
"To get ice cream for Potter, Weaslette, Tori and I." Draco responds.
The blush never leaves Draco's cheeks as Harry places his paw down again. Draco gives a faint meow and Harry opens the paper bag. He takes out a marshmallow and a couple of jelly beans and holds it out for Draco. Draco gently nibs at the sweets and smiles as he chews on it. Once he is done chewing, Harry asks for his paw again which Draco gives. Harry again praises Draco for being a good boy.
"Look at me, pet." Harry says gently.
"Yeah. Just worried about Tori. She still has a year to go by in Hogwarts before she can get a job or something." Draco replies.
Shaving (body hair)
"When we're you? When I was in the office? Did you use our bedroom?" Darien asks.
"Okay Draco. Okay. Alright. Its alright. Its okay. You're okay here. You're safe. Shushshsh. Its okay." Theo tries to calm Draco down.
"How could you? You both bastards! Darien! You wouldn't have been in this position if it wasn't for Draco and you still can't afford half the shit you can because of Draco. And Millicent, you work in his company because of Draco, you backstabbing cunts. You, don't bother coming home. I'll have the elves throw your stuff outside." Pansy apparates.
Zabini nods and gives me a cigarette. He even lights it up for me. We stand there, chatting about trivial things and laughing. I never thought I'd be so calm and friendly with Slytherins. Then we took a walk in the garden.
"As long as she isn't embarrassing us by picking something ridiculous. She's still so spiteful that you chose me. Ohmygod!"
"Look at you like what?"
"She does. To be a homemaker and make her wife happy." Draco replies.
"Yes. Cormac McLaggen."
“There’s something there,” he whispered, “it could be the scar, stretched tight… Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?”
"When have you ever asked for that? You know you can." Draco replied.
"As I said, I've heard a lot about you. And it was important that this meeting happens this weekend as I don't know when I'll have the next available slot." Harry says, because isn't monologuing a thing characters like Harry do during this time?
Teasing
"You expect me to sit on that." Draco stated horrified.
"Strip." Harry commands.
Hit me like a man- the pretty reckless
"Sod off Gin." Potter said but there was no bite in it. Just amusement and without wasting another moment, Potter leads Draco to their bedroom.
"Yes Harry. I love you."
Fuck off you people.
"My apologies. What's up?" Scorpius shook his head.
"Luna?" I call out. With a flick of my wand I multiply that apple into two. "Luna?" I call out again.
"And now?"
"That she was. Doesn't defy the fact that she was still family."
"What is it?" Darien asks.
Light shines through as the metal door opens. It burns his eyes, the light. He shuts his eyes close tight to save himself from the hurt of the light as he feels rough hands grip his hair tightly and pull him to stand up. It hurts his scalp. Weak. He's so weak, he can't even stand by himself. His eyes are still closed as he is pushed through the corridors of the holding cells. He slowly opens his eyes but his visions are blurry. He blinks several times to get his vision in focus. He stumbles. It is difficult to walk when your hands and legs are secured with shackles. Magic binding shackles. How long has it been since he hasn't felt his magic? They drag him through the prisoners entrance in front of the entire Wizengamot. His trial. The court room is huge with entire Wizengamot present. Press of all papers and magazines. He is thrown roughly on the stand where he knows he will be blamed guilty. Which he is. He knows it.
Harry feels that he's broken Draco but in a good way. Two things, Draco is giggling. Draco never giggles. Second; Draco said Awesome. Harry can't even count on his fingers how many times Draco has said Awesome because the count is zero. Harry chuckles, kisses his forehead, cleans Draco and himself with a cleaning charm using Draco's wand. He was too exhausted so he didn't dare use wandless magic. He makes Draco close his eyes and within seconds Draco falls asleep. Harry waits until Draco is deep sleep just in case Draco would need him. When he's sure Draco's fine and asleep, he finally closes his eyes.
"Tilly!" I call out.
"I've left my husband. You won't have to worry about Millicent. She'll be permanently with me now." Darien replies.
"He's possessive, I see. Anyone who would have you would be. How did Woodie react?"
- Bee
Everyone left for their classes. As they left great hall, Theo and Ginny walked together.
"What?" He asks.
"He's a man through and through. He has a cock to prove it." Harry says irritated.
Harry smiles at her and squeezes Draco's hips, providing silent comfort. Draco leans into him.
Darien knows that if anyone finds out that he is with his employee, they will ask why. He knows it's because with this girl, he feels the happiness, the peace that he doesn't feel at home anymore. Whether at home or office, he is always irritated. His mind always overthinks but with Millicent, it's quiet. He feels like twenty again. Free and full of joy. And there's nothing wrong with being happy. Everyone is happy and nobody is getting hurt is what Darien feels, forgetting that someone is getting hurt. That someone is Draco.
