Draco mutters, “Disgusting.” But he pulls two cigarettes from the pack, places them both between his lips, and lights them with the only bit of wandless magic he can do, mostly just a party trick Harry taught him a few months back. Or maybe it was last year. He can’t remember. Draco hands one of the cigarettes to Harry as he takes a drag of his own, the smoke curling around his face in a way that Harry finds rather debonair.
Draco pursed his lips. He knew what he needed from Potter and that Potter wouldn’t give it without something in return. Draco needed an offering, a bribe — and it would have to be big. He racked his brain and only one thing came to mind. It was something he didn’t want to offer, but Potter was looking at him like he was about to cut the call and it was now or never. Draco squeezed his eyes shut, pinching the bridge of his nose, then spit out his best offer.
“I’m certain I could afford better,” Draco snapped, to which Potter just grinned wider. “But I’m not interested in purchasing company.”
Harry was a vision above him. His sweat-damp curls twisted wildly around his ears and fell across his forehead in tendrils. His body was hard and lean, the muscles in his stomach and arms tensing and flexing as he shifted his hips. His plush lip was caught between his teeth — a gesture Draco was becoming increasingly familiar with when Harry was in the throes of pleasure. He tightened his grip on Harry’s hips and thrust upward, just as he reached up to snag a handful of those tantalising curls and dragged Harry’s mouth against his own.
Harry closed his eyes for a long moment, his brows still drawn together, and the lines etched around his eyes more pronounced. But then his lashes fluttered open and his expression cleared and he took a step back.
“How far will you be travelling? And by Apparition or Portkey? Oh god, you didn’t plan to ride that bloody motorbike home, did you?”
” Emile said with a tilt of his chin that reminded Draco of his mother when she was disappointed. “He wants you.”
Draco ran one hand down the firm planes of Potter's stomach, his fingers skating across his abdominal muscles to curl around the waistband of his jeans. He tucked the tips of his fingers beneath the fabric only to find more warm skin. Draco tore his eyes away from the open button and zip at Potter's waist to look him in the eyes.
Harry laughed and ducked into Draco’s neck. He nipped at the sensitive skin behind Draco’s ear. He knew it drove Draco mad and Harry did so enjoy getting his way.
Draco ended up buying the suit jacket and the trousers to match, along with a fresh, white Givenchy shirt with silver buttons. He and Pansy decided to walk to lunch. It was a bit too warm for Draco’s liking, but it felt nice to be out of the flat and not alone, for a change.
Draco simply wishes Harry wouldn’t find someone new to fawn over him every single time they went out. Why couldn’t he just have fun like the rest of them? Did he always have to pull?
Something hard and unyielding lodged itself in Draco’s esophagus and refused to move until Hannah reappeared with the wine and Potter’s cup of tea. Draco took a generous gulp from his glass and coughed. Emile smacked him on the back none too gently, then left his hand there.
“America, mostly. The Netherlands, sometimes. Germany, Sweden, Italy, France. I don’t stay any place for an extended amount of time.”
remember me telling you I was coming to visit,” he replied with a roll of his eyes. “And I wish I could stay,
Granger and Blaise return to their grumbling and marking of parchment, though in better spirits now that they’ve eaten. They occasionally hand papers to Potter to sign or ask his opinion on this or that, but they are entrenched in the legal side of the project, which leaves Potter to Draco.
“Draco! Mate, it’s been ages,” Blaise exclaimed, clapping a hand against Draco’s shoulder and flashing a brilliant smile.
Potter’s responding grin had a predatory edge. He left kisses and licks against the insides of Draco’s thighs, his cheek and chin nuzzled against Draco’s spent cock. It was lovely to watch and Draco felt the flare of arousal low in his belly reignite. It wasn’t quite enough, but then Potter pushed up to sit back on his knees. He tapped the outside of Draco’s ankle with one finger.
Potter’s grip at the back of Draco’s neck was firm and unyielding, the tips of his fingers pressing into the notches of Draco’s spine, settling between the bones like they were made to rest there. There was no shyness in Potter’s kiss, no sweet swipes of tongue or teasing softness, but rather a ferocity, a growling hunger as he plunged his tongue past Draco’s lips, consuming him.
Potter sighed and flopped off his stool dramatically. “You say the sweetest things,” he said with a roll of his eyes and began collecting his mostly empty bags of food, dumping the rest in the bin. “See you, Malfoy.”
Harry leaned back, bracing himself on his palms, spreading his knees wider as Draco crowded against him. It felt fucking incredible, and Harry desperately wanted to let his lids flutter closed and lose himself in the sensation, to ride the cresting waves of arousal indefinitely — but he also couldn't bear to look away. There was something so lurid and sinful about watching Draco suck cock. He had a lovely mouth. Not plush and full, perhaps, but thin, wry, and twisting. It was expressive in the way it curled upwards or downwards, rarely flat. Even now, with his lips wrapped around Harry's erection, he appeared to be smirking.
"Oh, Merlin forbid," Draco said on a sigh and crawled off Potter's lap on unsteady legs. He retrieved his wand from his trousers and cast a quick Scourgify over himself and Potter, which left his skin pink and tingling. "Next time I'll teach you the lubrication charm, so you don't feel the need to spit on me. Honestly, Potter? Disgusting."
Draco swallowed hard. "Then I trust the competent staff at Mungo's would be kind enough to sew it back on for you, once they found it. And I'd suggest your criminals practice their aim. Merlin knows how they missed your head. It's bloody enormous."
A half-hour later, Harry’s tea was empty. He hastily made an excuse – something about paperwork for a case involving a botched batch of illegal Polyjuice that resulted in a dozen Queen Elizabeths running amok in Trafalgar Square – and got in the lift.
Draco was home. He was back to smoking cigarettes on his little balcony with the wrought-iron fence and the view of the Sacre Coeur. Back to watering his potted roses and drinking cappuccino at his favourite café next door to the bakery with the lemon tarts. Back to the clean white and gold interior of L'apothicaire Serpent d'Argent, with its huge windows, tasteful displays, and far superior floor plan.
Draco boggled. “Who the fuck would I want to see, Pans? Just because you’re skipping around merrily with a bunch of Huffllepuffs and ruddy Gryffindors these days does not, for one second, mean I want to see them. And they
did), well, this was no disappointment. He was caged in the bracket of Harry’s strong arms, pinned by his weight and at his mercy.
"You're only saying that because you know it won't land me in Mungo's so often," Harry said, and though his words were teasing, the smile on his face was pure sunshine.
At last, Harry’s hand stills and he sighs, head falling back. Draco doesn’t move, his fingers still curled around Harry’s neck, fisted into the fabric of his jacket. Harry extracts his hand from the back of Draco’s trousers to rest on his waist beneath the open panels of his shirt. His thumbs skim the jut of Draco’s hipbone, a gentle, unconscious movement that makes Draco shiver.
"You're miserable?" Harry remembered what Blaise told him at the fundraiser. He couldn't imagine Draco Malfoy feeling heartbroken over anyone. He'd assumed Draco would patch over his wounded pride and find someone else to play with — but now, Harry wondered if he'd misjudged him, if the heated looks and tender gestures weren't a sham. He didn't mean to be so suspicious; it was simply that, for Harry, everything had a price.
"I still dream about it," he said, voice faraway. But then his eyes flicked to Draco, mouth bunched to one side. "Hogwarts, I mean. I haven't been back in ages. Not since the reconstruction."
A discomforting realization came to Harry then. He’d only gone so far as to admit that he wanted the domestic bits, the saccharine sweetness that he witnessed between his friends and their partners. And here it was, sitting in front of him, and while he could see it just fine, it wasn’t enough. It would never be enough.
Draco could live his life without Harry, had done so for nearly ten years. But while he no longer saved them, Draco always checked the papers. It wasn't because he cared about the news, though that is what he told anyone who asked. Rather, his heart leapt at every mention of Harry's name in print, every scowling photo of him in uniform, or the candid ones captured by a sneaky paparazzo. Because even while it felt like a slowly twisted knife in Draco's gut to see Harry's face, to see him busy and happy and carrying on just fine without Draco, it meant that Harry was
Weasley finally surrendered the coffee to Draco and leaned his elbows against the railing, looking down four stories to the street.
The conversation continued around him, and Draco took a moment to glance surreptitiously around the room. Every face was both familiar and strange. It had been years, and he supposed he shouldn’t be surprised that there were a few more lines etched into everyone’s faces. A few people glanced over at him and he tensed, waiting for the whispering and pointing to begin. But instead, he was treated to tight smiles and polite nods.
a thing they do. But he feels like crying. He has to press the heels of his hands against his eyes to keep the stinging tears from spilling over.
Draco dozed a bit longer, daydreaming about the sounds Harry would make under his tongue, until he was roused again by the rich scent of meat and vegetables, fresh herbs, and the bright acidity of wine hitting a hot pan and filling the small room.
"Mm, yes. Must be very difficult listening to people expound upon your bravery and many virtues all the time," Draco said, moving to stand in the space between Harry's spread knees.
Mungo’s would never let him anywhere near their precious Saviour and he was fairly certain the wards on Harry’s floo at home would blast him halfway to Bulgaria if he tried to force his way through.
Potter sighed, raking a hand through his hair and leaving it standing wildly on end. “Yeah, a little bit.”
“Shite,” Potter announced as Janet Jackson went flying. “Double shite.” The Wallflowers. “Ugh, God. Just embarrassing.” Sinead O’Connor whizzed past. “Christ, is he serious?” Hasselhoff’s
Draco cancelled his Saturday brunch plans with Pansy claiming a windfall of work. He had to bribe Rosalind with a dozen scones from the expensive bakery in Hammersmith to earn his alibi. And even after dropping thirty pounds on overpriced baked goods, she still gave him that pitying look that implied he was about to get an unrequested two-week holiday if he wasn’t careful.
Draco blinked through the haze because he was quite certain that was the most ridiculous question he’d ever been asked.
"Thank you for staying," Harry said finally. The fingers of the hand closest to Draco twitched, and Draco fixed his eyes on them, because it was far easier than watching Harry's face.
Draco kicked open the door to his flat, causing it to swing back and slam against the wall, knocking a frame with a generic picture of the Eiffel Tower to the floor. He didn't bother turning on the lights and stalked directly to the potions kit he kept in his bedroom. He dug around through the mess of glass vials until he withdrew a sobering potion. Unlike his hangover cure, the stuff tasted like bilge-water and felt like being scoured from the inside with a wire brush, but as soon as the wine-induced fog cleared from his head, rage and embarrassment settled in its place.
His forehead drops against Harry’s shoulder as Harry firms his grip, a smooth stroke from the base to the tip. He pants open-mouthed into the fabric of Harry’s shirt as he does it again, his hips rolling of their own volition, chasing the friction of Harry’s broad hand.
"How’s your girl doing in London? Was she able to get things up and running again? I understand she was left with quite a mess," Draco said with a shake of his head.
Pansy Parkinson sat primly on a settee in the sitting room of her posh London townhouse, draped in a velvet dressing gown. A stack of magazines, both wizarding and Muggle, balanced next to her, and she flipped idly through the pages of one spread across her lap.
Emile looked up from the papers. "Draco, this resume could be yours. Who broke her heart and made her so ambitious?"
Draco gave Harry a shove against his chest, propelling him towards the bike parked on the kerb. “Then you better drive fast, Potter. I want to catch the sunset.”
Draco's expression cracks a little, his sharp brows going soft for half a second before pulling into a frown. “What, like a potted plant? A decorative plate for the wall?”
A delighted giggle floated up from below, and Draco peered down to see the streets filled with Muggles, laughing and shouting, huddled together to keep warm. He would normally observe such a scene with a cool detachment, but hearing Harry's voice had him thinking all sorts of ridiculous and sentimental things. Like what it would be like to do something like that — to throw an arm around Pansy, tease Blaise, tug at Greg's sleeve to get him to pick up the pace as they hurried off to the pubs or out for dinner. What would it be like to come from work to more than a darkened sitting room, a single coffee cup unwashed in the sink, a cold bed?
was so embarrassing and it was entirely his fault that Draco was falling apart at the seams, that he could barely hold his rhythm long enough to fuck him properly because he was going to come. He was going to come with Harry’s cock in his arse and praise on his lips, and it was too much.
He left plenty of room between them but still felt the heat from Malfoy’s body as if it were pressed against him. Harry had never felt so simultaneously unsettled and drawn to a person, like his mere presence caused Harry’s skin to itch and his blood to boil in his veins. And yet, he still found himself wanting to move closer, to lean into him, just to see what it felt like.
Draco crawled up his body, tracing the freckles and scars across his abdomen, some new, some exactly where he'd left them, committing each to memory with his lips and tongue. He straddled Potter's hips, the hard length of him pressed against Draco's belly as he leaned forward and kissed him. He kissed him like he wanted to consume him, like he wanted to crawl inside his body and live behind his ribcage, possessive fingers curled around his heart where he could feel it beat against his palm forever. Safe.
date, Potter. Not a Weasley,” Draco says, and Potter scowls and grumbles something that sounds suspiciously like, ‘show
He suddenly imagined sinking down onto the sofa, bracketing Potter’s hips with his knees and running a hand beneath his shirt. He swallowed hard and licked his lips as Potter watched him. All Draco could do was pray that Potter was as oblivious and as drunk as he thought he was, else he would have seen the desire flit across Draco’s expression, the hunger in his eyes, and that was entirely out of the question.
Daphne smiles sweetly at Potter and extends her hand, which Potter shakes roughly enough that Draco has to bite his tongue to keep from scolding him.
,” Draco said, pointing the wand at the empty grate in the hearth, his attention never leaving Potter’s face. A fire burst to life and Potter’s jaw tightened, his throat bobbing as he swallowed. “You can feel that?”
“It was with Severus’ things. He didn’t have any family, so his personal effects ended up with me. My mother stored them until I could go through them and I did, eventually, a couple of years ago. Found that in there. Was labeled. That’s how I knew it was her. Was quite surprised to find it, really. Probably should have given it to you sooner but…you know.” Draco cleared his throat. “Were they friends? Severus and your mum?”
The next afternoon finds Draco digging frantically through a heap of clothing, tearing apart boxes of inventory, and shooting spells at the spinning racks in the back room of his store. He huffs, annoyed, and tosses aside another unacceptable option.
Potter sat back in his chair and crossed his arms over his chest. He looked around the empty room. “So, why are you sitting here, then?” He tilted his head to one side. “Are you waiting for someone?”
Draco wasn’t so oblivious as to not immediately recognise the similarities between her case and Potter’s. He flipped through the diagnostics for what was probably the tenth time. He nearly had them memorised by now. He couldn’t stop himself from wondering if something could be done.
. Hell, they bloody loved it. It was no secret that the department was devoted to him. It was likely the reason no one bothered to inform him that it wasn't his job to risk his bollocks once a week in an attempt to save everyone's life but his own.
Draco sat, setting his half-drunk martini in front of him. He kept his distance from the table, legs crossed with one arm slung over the back of the chair and the other on his knee. Draco wasn’t a nervous man, but he felt the sudden urge to fidget, to tug at his sleeves or adjust the placement of his glass on the table. There was an intensity to Potter, a certain keenness to his gaze that left Draco feeling flayed. It only got worse when Potter leaned forward on his elbows, squinting as he appraised Draco.
Harry found the usual tea steaming under a stasis charm on the dining table, next to a carefully wrapped package with a green bow.
"Oh, indubitably. I have a hard time imagining that man looming convincingly. Ah well, can't be good at everything, I suppose." Draco pulled a galleon from his wallet and dropped it into Hannah's outstretched hand as she pushed two coffees across the counter towards him.
The Snitch darted left suddenly, and Draco lost his traction. But not Potter. Potter followed it without a moment's calculation, and then Potter closed his hand around the little gold orb and it was over.
Harry breaks this kiss, eyes still shut tight, but his lips part around panting breaths, and Draco preens, thrilled that he’s figured out the key to making Harry Potter sweat.
"Why?" Draco asked warily. He dipped the tip of his cigarette into the flame, flickering in the wind.
Draco steps up to him and crosses his arms over his chest. “We’re going to do a lot more than that. We’re going to make you the belle of the ball, Potter. We’re just that generous.”
But as time wore on, he felt his magic draining from him, a pinprick in a balloon, slowly leaking until he was nothing but a deflated shell. And it wasn’t enough. The job was barely half done, and though Draco grasped at his last reserves, he found them lacking. Found
“No, you’re alright,” Harry said, but at least he was back to smiling in that crooked, fond way that Draco was becoming a bit addicted to.
Draco scoffed. “First of all, I’m still on the fence about whether or not I like you, Marcus. And don’t be ridiculous. I like people.”
Potter watched him as he worked, a strange light behind his eyes that Draco was in no mood to try to decipher, though he felt the heat of it as well as the sunshine on his skin.
Draco clenched his jaw to keep the snippy remark behind his teeth as Potter strode around the room, picking up broken bits of Draco's displays and stepping over smashed pieces of furniture.
Pansy and Luna’s house was an odd mix of things that somehow managed to work. The cream coloured sofas and jewel-toned accent pillows were all Pansy, while the dried flowers hanging from the rafters, the windchimes shaped like Nifflers and decorated with demitasse spoons, and the lingering scent of Patchouli and Anise were definitely Lovegood.
Draco fucking lost it. He bucked against Harry and let out an embarrassingly animalistic moan, to which Harry responded by fucking him even harder.
Draco dressed carefully that evening, selecting his best trousers and a silky green shirt that Blaise said made him look slutty (which Draco took as a compliment). He tousled his pale hair and doused himself in some of Blaise’s expensive cologne, winking at himself in the mirror before setting off in search of worthwhile distraction.
Draco groans. He hands over the wallet and bends at the knees, sending a silent prayer to the fashion gods in heaven that the Muggle dry cleaners will be able to remove the stains from his trousers because Draco will never find another pair.
"I'm special," Draco preened, then examined the biscuit again. "It's probably Edith, Potter's secretary in the DMLE. She usually does something impressive for the buffet, and she's a little soft on him, I think. You should have seen the cake she made for his birthday. There were six tiers and singing pixies."
Potter chuckles at that, and Draco’s stomach ties itself into knots. Potter has a rather pleasant laugh, throaty and deep most of the time, unless you surprise him, and it comes out a giggle.
was enough to have Draco collecting his jaw from the floor. Potter stood in front of what was likely a sea of flashbulbs, arms crossed and signature scowl clouding his face. His uniform was singed enough to see the angry burns on the bare skin of his arms, the tops of his thighs, and the expanse of his right shoulder. Bloody hell, Potter had
It always played out like that between them. Blaise didn’t bottom and Draco didn’t mind. It was a convenience fuck and nothing more. Blaise’s interest in men was purely sexual anyway. He preferred to date women and Draco didn’t look at it as anything more than a rather gorgeous means to an end. They were friends and Draco liked fucking his friends. He found it a hell of a lot easier than dating most of the time. At least his friends knew who he was and knew better than to expect anything from him.
and Draco was sure he was about to be kicked out on his arse. He dropped the mug back onto the rack.
Blaise looked at Draco, stretched on the lounge, chest bare and lit cigarette hanging from his lips. He rolled his eyes. “Let me guess, Potter didn’t show up for your parole meeting.”
“I’d hurry if I were you, dear. Eleanor’s nephew followed him out there. Looked a bit friendly, if you ask me.”
Harry tries to push back, palms at Draco’s chest and Draco’s name muffled on his lips. But Draco snarls, refusing to loosen his grip.
Harry looked around the empty and unnervingly quiet neighbourhood, “Where’s Asbestos? Can’t she just sort it out?”
“Princess is a good girl. She’d never hurt a fly,” George said, “In fact, she’s terrified of flies. All insects, really. Most things even. Princess has a tender heart.”
He found the right page, charmed the creases out and cast a duplication spell, handing Malfoy a crisp new form.
Draco had waited until he was nearly late to get to class, rather hoping that he wouldn't be able to sit next to Potter and thus save himself from having to speak to him at all. And yet, despite all the filled desks, the seat beside Potter was quite empty.
ok but after the war whenever draco buys a chocolate frog, without fail he always gets a harry potter card even if he eats five in a row - all harry cards
Ron hugged him back so tight Harry could feel his bone creak, “I dunno, I just wanted to say I’m sorry, I guess. I felt like I needed to.”
Harry shifted his weight, buttering the bread for the toasted cheese, “I’ve… I’ve never been good at expressing myself with my words. I never know what to say, unless it’s the wrong thing. I’m pretty good at saying the wrong thing.”
“She’s at her bridge club until tea,” George said with a bright smile. “Funny thing about names, my neighbour's named Hicken
Harry closed his eyes for a second, remembering the moment. And then he must have fallen asleep. Or perhaps they both had, as Harry found it hard to believe that Draco wouldn’t have shaken him awaken in annoyance if Harry had drifted off first.
“I’m not saying we shouldn’t tell McGonagall,” Hermione said, her words carefully measured, “but she’s already told the professors and prefects, and the aurors and people at Hogsmeade. The forbidden forest is massive, finding something that doesn't want to be found would be nearly impossible. I don't think there's anything else to be done."
Harry blinked, confused for a second before realising what Malfoy was talking about, “Just for my hand? I can just go to the mediwitch in the Ministry, they’ll have something.”
Harry shrugged a shoulder, “Well, I mean… I’m quoting Hermione here a bit, but it’s like the wizarding world was the first place that really accepted me, that felt like home, but even from the beginning it felt conditional. I defeated Voldemort when I was a baby, and I kept fighting him to protect everyone and the two things kind of became linked in my mind? That I had to keep protecting this place and keep it safe so I could stay.”
Harry didn’t listen, he had heard Shunter’s various lectures on proper dispelling procedure to have had dreams of them, and they were just as boring the second time around.
Malfoy looked down, his finger following his eyes and curling around the edge of his black police vest, “This isn’t bad,” he tugged on the thick fabric with a faint smirk. “But that hat just does not suit at all.”
“Yes, I know,” Rowena agreed with the grumbled unrest. She told Draco, “Our croft too full, old wizard houses fell during the war and elves
Draco did not meet his gaze. Harry watched Draco, the way his throat jumped as if caught on his words.
Draco shrugged, “It’s- My father always said- I don’t know. I just assumed, and I never got close enough to find out.”
“Gold… Gold exchange! Was someone trying to sell gold here? But it would have to have magic involved, or the auror’s wouldn’t be here,” Malfoy said, back to guessing. “A gold cauldron? No… galleons are involved-” his eyes widened, “
The Juniors stiffly followed her orders, Jeremy looking like he had never held an animal in his life, clutching the dog under the armpits as far away from himself as humanly possible. As soon as Kalya released the spell, the dog-cat began squirming and wriggling trying to escape. Before it could, Shunter deftly reversed the awkward transfiguration so that it was a dog once more.
Harry pressed his face into the curve of Draco’s neck, the skin warm and sweetly damp from the press of their bodies. The cloakroom was small, made smaller by the press of winter cloaks smelling of preservation and moth repelling charms waiting for the cold to return.
“They were wizards, people who think logically and make plans! A vicious animal that’s as strong as Hagrid
“Most of the time these days, they just send you lads to the hospital, especially since they let the healer go. Budget cuts, budget cuts, they’ll be the death of me, well someday,” Bedlum said, giving her robes one last enthusiastic smack and put her hands on her hips. “What can I do you for?”
Harry smiled ruefully, fishing the last bite of cereal floating on a sea of milk tinted faintly pink by the marshmallows.
“Different people are suited for different work,” Shunter said. She turned to the tree. The addition of Malfoy and Asbestos hadn’t seemed to progress whatever the Juniors were working on, but then again they were just standing back and eating their ice cream watching the show.
!” Shunter finally snapped, “You used magic on a muggle! You broke the statute of secrecy! I do not care about your neighbour. I do not care about his dog. The simple matter is this: You broke the statute of secrecy, not accidentally, but with intent!”
Harry handed it over and turned his head up towards the sky. The gala was being held at the country estate of some old family or other that Harry couldn’t be bothered to care about, but it was darker here, and he could make out the stars unlike the grey-faded skies of London. He blinked up at a bright almost full moon, and put the cigarette to his lips again.
consequences. This time being found out would likely result in rejection and a horrifying amount embarrassment that he'd rather not deal with.
“-You can’t transfigure your neighbour's dog,” Shunter went on, ignoring Mr Hickenbotham, “It’s a blatant-”
only in his dreams that Draco had seen such an earnest expression, such a show of trust. So he nodded silently.
“-So I have an idea of what I’m doing but no certainties.” Malfoy went on, “I’m not going to lie to you, you’re unhinged enough as it is without me adding to it.”
failing, staying sleepily relaxed against Weasley. And it struck Draco, that if he were a predator, it would very, very easy to finish the two of them off right there and then.
“I try, Moony,” Sirius bemoaned, “but he’s pulled it out by lunch no matter how carefully I tie it back and I can never seem to find a moment to retie it.”
Eighth year. Draco has seen Harry watching him again and goes to talk to him about it, what it means, what Harry means.
“Like sixth year,” Draco finished. He saw Potter bite his lip like he wanted to say something and quickly cut in, “Don’t apologize again. You’re awful at it and I’m really not in the mood to endure that level of awkwardness.”
Draco’s room and the bathroom were upstairs, along with a rather plain and empty guest room. The room right at the top of the stairs was an office, filled with over-crowded bookshelves and a desk piled with notes and files.
“This way,” Malfoy called, already disappearing down a narrow alley. “So what sort of call is it? I’d like to know what we’ll be headed into,” Malfoy said once Harry had caught up.
Harry heard the unspoken question and took a deep breath, “Too much, pushy, patronising, overbearing, smothering... It’s, uh, funny, I guess. I’m really bad at taking care of myself, but when I live with someone, I really like to take care of them. It’s, erm, it’s been a problem for me. Ginny said it made her feel useless, she wanted us to split housework equally. But whenever I see something that needs to be done, I just do it. I don’t think about it. It’s not about- I didn’t think less of her for it.
His wand was in Draco’s room or lost in his robes along the way, so he grabbed the lone towel from the hook by the shower and scrub it over his hair.
“It’s only been a year,” Remus said, “And we just moved here, and we’ve moved twice before. Give him some time.”
He had no idea what he would have done if Potter had said yes. If he couldn't even get close to Potter, the plan was over. He wasn't certain if it had even begun. There was no way it could come to fruition. It was just a way to get this silly crush out of his system.
“With Robards, for certain. With Malfoy?,” Ron shrugged, “I dunno. Guess you’ll have to find out.” He pushed Harry toward the front desk, “I’ll finish the report, you do what you have to.”
Andromeda nodded to them, bringing out a small basket from the kitchen, “I’ll watch after your sweets.”
“Haven’t you held a dog before?” Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. He pushed his ice cream cone into Harry’s hand and took the dog from Jeremy, holding it close to his chest. “It’s a Pekingese, they’re meant to look like that.” Malfoy’s voice dropped to a murmur as he told the little white mop, “I think you’re cute just as you are.”
“Shit,” Harry hurried over to the stove, pulling the pot off the burner as the room filled with the smell of burnt tomatoes.
Harry either had to move closer or be pulled onto his face. He moved, looking slightly pained about the whole ordeal as
Harry moved between his knees, sliding his hands up Draco’s thighs. He felt Draco’s legs tighten around him. Draco looped his arms around Harry’s shoulders, tangling his fingers in Harry’s hair as his legs gently squeezed his hips. Harry leaned into him, nipping the lip Draco was always biting before kissing him.
“The most efficient solution is to apply a mild obliviate to erase the last couple hours from his mind, leave the dog and everything as it was before the transfiguration and leave,” Shunter said.
deadly,” Harry said weakly, knowing any defence of Hagrid’s classes in that direction was pretty hopeless.
“Samhain is when the veil between worlds is thin. We lay out a feast or a dumb supper and invite those loved ones that might be with us and eat it together. We share our food, share our stories and celebrate them.” Draco said.
Bedlum smeared the greenish paste on his palm and flipped his hand to do the back, “Isn’t he? You make a good pair. Having a similar sense of humour is important. If you can’t laugh together, how will you cry together, hm?”
"And if you hadn't had him arrested I'd have hunted him down and hung him up by his ears," Harry said.
“Right, you wouldn’t have your own form yet,” Harry said, instead of the answer, which was Auror department main reception because, well… Malfoy couldn’t leave yet. There was so much Harry didn’t understand.
“They're just chocolate frogs,” Blaise pulled out a slightly battered carton and tossed it over to Draco.
He nearly fell as Potter grabbed the front of his robes, pulled him close and kissed him. It was rough, breathless, and over far too
Draco stared after him for a second then quickly added the last ingredient, stirring three times clockwise and three times counter. He withdrew the stirring rod, watching the unappealing goop with apprehension as it took on the correct greenish colour and the sour milk scent was overpowered by the right sort of swampy smell. He would test it anyway just to be safe.
“Really?” Harry raised an eyebrow. As far as he knew, only Ron and Hermione had realised he wasn’t happy in the job.
Harry’s chair fell over as he stood and drew his wand. He hit Leon with a tripping jinx as he walked forward, an expelliarmus that sent Leon’s wand flying, and an incarcerous bound his legs. Harry stood over the hapless idiot, trying to convince himself not to break his nose.
“Because we have kid brains,” Draco tapped his forehead, “The pre-frontal cor-tex  hasn’t finished growing, so everything feels well y’know.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Pretending to be Merlin is for children. Then you grow up and find out Merlin had more power than god but rarely used it or was helpful in any way. And he was a perv.”
Draco nearly stopped in his tracks before realising that that was the worst idea imaginable. The halls were emptying, and classes would be starting soon, such as his ancient runes class which he was not going to be late to. In addition, there was the very small, insignificant detail that if Draco was alone with Potter for even a single second the world might end so he picked up his pace.
“Oh, there were plenty of times you were a complete and utter pillock all on your own,” Malfoy said, “You can’t blame Voldemort for
Harry flipped up his hood with its dragon head design, the little felt white teeth ringing around the mouth got lost in his shiny black curls.
And Harry let himself stare, studying every faint line and shadow falling across Draco’s face, allowed himself this indulgence. Their meetings had always been brief and easy. Though Harry could admit to himself that the easiness was a facade, a careful dance between the two of them, reluctant to take a step closer.
Draco sat on the edge of the bed, summoning a stack of books from his trunk and setting them on the bedside table, “Take
Draco frowned, sparing Harry a brief glare that quickly melted. He flexed his wrist, and Harry let go. Before Draco stepped back, he leaned in and kissed Harry again, lingering and reluctant to let go. He looked at Harry almost sadly, before taking a few steps back and apparating away.
“Helping?” Harry tried. He grimaced, “I went a bit overboard. I, uh, the woman who was running the betting pool told me who cursed you. I reported him. I hope that’s alright.”
“The auror I stunned, he was trying to- I just didn’t want him to kiss you,” Harry said, embarrassed.
Harry walked over, trying not to make too much noise so he could listen in on what they were talking about.
Harry wanted to shake the man, “And what if a stray dog comes through and attacks her? A small white dog like her, she looks more like a toy than another dog.”
Draco walked over and rumpled the blankets, moving the pillow so it was half off the side and knocking the curtains askew. He stood back and tilted his head, “What do you think?””
Harry wiped his eyes, taking a deep breath and slowly letting it out. He looked up at the sky and smiled, bringing the smile down to Draco, “Anything else we should do?”
these boys wear me out. they argue in my head sometimes and i just want to scold them for chatting when I'm not in front of a computer or have my phone to jot it down. inconsiderate boys
“And that’s why the dryer is better,” Harry said, pulling the sheet up over their heads and softening the light around them to pastels.
The trip ended up taking longer than he thought, as everything he thought to cook needed spices and pots and pans Harry was pretty sure Draco didn’t have. He filled a trolley full to bursting with it all and had to spend five minutes shrinking bags and putting them into other bags so he could carry it all in two, with copious lightening charms to support the weight.
Draco frowned at his knee, “A cleaning charm will get rid of most of it. Perhaps they won’t notice.”
Pansy looked like their foil with her dark hair and understated makeup and simple, elegant clothing but she used to be just like them, not a handful of years ago before the war and her mother and Slytherin conformity had dampened her.
She narrowed her eyes, “Cause of you I have to return everyone’s money, it’s a shite load of work. Next time join the betting pool or leave it well alone.”
“Bye, Hermione,” Harry said as Hermione left, giving them a distracted wave as she hurried back to work.
“Draco, you know how I feel about Halloween,” Harry said with a sigh, dropping his coat over the back of a chair in their shared flat.
“They always are,” Harry frowned, glad no one could see the expression, “Want to run away with me?” He regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth and forced himself away from Draco. “I’ve had too much to drink.”
forward, turning off the water behind Draco's back and taking his arm. He pulled Draco out of the shower onto a wet, cold floor, grabbing a towel
Harry could tell Hermione wasn’t helping her case and leaned between them to cut things off, taking the damp cloth from Malfoy’s forehead, which had almost completely dried out, to the sink. When he came back out Hermione was casting some sort of spell over Malfoy that showed a blanket of reds and oranges over his body with only a few touches of yellow. It was like a heat map Harry had seen somewhere, maybe a school book or on the tv.
Harry didn’t have to admit anything. Luna’s friends could tease her about being strange because they weren’t mean about it, but no one else was allowed. “Luna’s great.”
Sirius stood up and stretched his arms over his head, “Don’t tempt me. I can’t take time off now, I just started.” He brushed Remus’ hair back and kissed his forehead. “Back in four.”
Harry could hear him opening cupboards, “Are you hungry? I have… coco pops, lucky charms and… golden nuggets, I didn’t like them much so they might be stale by now.”
Harry heard the car long before he realised it was coming up the street. It came up far too fast, and the tires squealed against the pavement as it slammed to a stop. Harry didn’t know much about cars, but he could tell this one reeked of money. It was a white two-seat convertible and looked like the sort of car you saw in magazines, not on the road.
SO I really want to thank, J, the anon who left me a comment that really gave me a kick in the pants to get back to writing this. Thank you so much for your wonderful comment! I must have read it a hundred times.
Once Teddy was free of his Grandmother, he ran back to Harry and Draco, puffing up his chest proudly, “I’m an auror this year.”
“Late for what? It’s a bonfire,” Harry said and tried to backpedal, “I mean it’s a nice one. Very burny.”
Shunter flicked out her wand and levitated Mr Hickenbotham a few feet back into the house, ignoring his indigent squawking, and charmed the door shut behind him, “Please remain in your home until the situation is resolved! Thank you!” she said cheerfully, turned on her heel and headed for Harry once she spotted him.
“I could ruin them,” Draco said, stepping around him into the shower. “I have, in fact, many times." He looked away, embarrassment colouring his features, “I hire a house-elf to come once a month and clean everything.”
Draco knew this wasn't something she would budge on. No matter what happened there had to be an heir. The family had to carry on.
“Fine, fine,” Draco said, taking the potion in one swallow and was soon just a kid sitting on the floor.
Potter shook his head, “Last time I tried there were reporters everywhere and people wanting things, autographs, to touch me.” he shuddered faintly.
“Especially after a night of champagne,” Draco said. He braced his hands on the wall and leaned back. His shoulder pressed against Harry’s.
“If I’m going to bother with breakfast it might as well be something I like,” Draco said, filling a bowl with coco pops and grabbing a spoon.
Ron shrugged, “Can’t imagine he didn’t try. I think it was one of the curse-breaker team that did it, they know their stuff.”
Draco rolled his eyes and drank the last of his cereal milk, looking defiant. He put the empty bowl on the counter and traded it for the mug of warm tea.
Draco frowned furiously at Potter then grabbed him by the front of his robes, pulling him close and hugging him as hard as he could.
That surprised a laugh out of Malfoy, and he jostled Harry’s shoulder with a grin, “You are utterly ridiculous.”
Draco put his hand on the two hangers and slowly pushed them down, “One, I’d be cute in anything, I was exceptionally adorable as a child. Two, I don’t care what you think-”
Harry woke in an unfamiliar room. His head ached from a faint hangover, and he groaned under his breath, scrubbing his hand over his face, his chin rough with stubble. Heavy dark curtains covered the windows, only letting in a soft grey light around the edges. The bed wasn’t his, but it was deliciously soft, Harry shifted his feet in the gentle warmth, feeling reluctant to move.
“I could say the same thing about me, but that isn’t-” Harry shook his head. “I want to know how you take your tea, and your favourite dessert, how to make you laugh… the real you.”
feeling of unease grew as he sat the potion base back down, his eyes settling on the door. He had left it open but had
Theo still isn’t moving. “It was. It’s been hard. But you know what that’s like, don’t you? What it feels like to be lonely?”
Draco paused, one hand on the marble arch, cool against his fingertips. "Of course. If you're about to tell me how unreasonable it was for me to assume you would manage the shop alone, then you needn't worry. I can't believe I didn't think of it sooner. I'm already sorting through some potential candidates. I sometimes forget that people need things like
The hand that Harry wasn’t using to work Draco’s cock was in his hair, tugging him from where he hid at the crook of Harry’s neck to bring their mouths together, where he could more easily swallow every one of Draco’s gasping moans.
His body shuddered, stomach muscles tensing and releasing in time with the pulsing waves of his orgasm, and it was bloody fucking
things, like showing up at Potter’s house in the middle of the night without invitation. It wasn’t as if Draco couldn’t handle attending the party solo. And he liked to think that the newspaper articles alone were enough to exact at least some small revenge on Noah, even if it wasn’t the grand Fuck You he’d hoped.
. Sometimes he would reach down and squeeze the base of Harry's cock, pulling him back viciously from the brink.
Draco remembered a night at the club. They'd arrived separately, pretending they weren't there with the expectation of running into each other. They danced for hours, if that's what you could call it. It was probably closer to fucking with their clothes on in a room of drunken strangers. Draco had been so bloody hard, grinding against Potter's hip, one arm thrown around his shoulders and Potter's lips at his ear. Potter had nipped at his earlobe, and it took all of Draco's willpower not to grab his wand and Apparate them away from the crowd of Muggles, Statute of Secrecy be damned. But Potter must have had the same idea, because he tugged Draco from the dancefloor and all but chased him out the door.
Watts pointed his wand at Draco and he felt the phantom tug of magic pull him toward the door. Draco tried not to stumble as he craned his neck toward the poker table.
Draco flicked his cigarette into the pool and stalked back inside the flat, but Blaise was on his tail.
So, Draco opened wounds long since scarred over to Pansy Parkinson. He told her about the early days after the war, how his sleep was plagued with nightmares of the Dark Lord, of Vince's death, of the tortured screams that echoed from the Manor dungeons. He told her about his escape into the Muggle world at every opportunity, about the blond boy in the pub — the first time anyone touched him without cringing away.
Hermione shot her husband a sharp look, then turned back to Harry. Her tone once again careful, as it always was when she was trying to coax something from him.
“I have to go,” he said. Then he frowned and leaned towards Draco, palms flat on the table. “I’m really sorry.”
Draco took his time. He fucked him hard and slow, lapping up the honey-sweet sounds from Harry’s lips whenever the taste of them faded from his mouth. Draco drank Harry in like it was the last time, because he had no way of knowing that it wasn’t.
, Potter melted into the crowd and Draco was stuck responding to another long line of enquiries, as if Draco was Potter’s accountant rather than his date.
Lovegood and the girl Weasley are already outside, clasped hands swinging between them as Lovegood hums the tune to a song Draco really likes. Blaise comes tumbling out after Draco and Pansy, shouting to Seamus Finnegan and Dean Thomas about how in Spain the clubs stay open until dawn. Granger is helping Weasley dig through his pockets to find his wand, which he fears he may have left in the toilets, until Granger extracts it from beneath his pant leg, tucked into his sock. They’d broken up during Eighth Year, thank god. Draco couldn’t stand one more second of the bickering. And anyway, Granger wasn’t a half-bad study buddy in school, so long as Weasley wasn’t around distracting her with nonsense about the bloody Cannons or trying to copy their notes.
It became a bit of a game as they took turns betting competing amounts of money over the most inane things. Potter fancied the framed and autographed photos of the 1946 Parliament members, while Draco preferred the collection of postage stamps of Doctor Who, and the broken Walkman with a Journey tape stuck inside.
Potter's good humour seemed to return at Draco's prickliness. "It's that or we take the bike," he said with a waggle of his eyebrows.
It was bloody brilliant. So brilliant in fact that Draco didn’t hear the table legs creak as they scraped across the floor, skidding as Harry rutted back against him. He did, however, feel the moment the thing gave way — a grinding screech of the metal table legs against the floor followed by the swoop in his stomach as the thing tipped backwards. It all happened so fast, blindingly fast. The table crumpled, and Draco flailed for a moment, clutching at Harry’s shoulders, their mouths torn apart and then — nothing. The table stilled and Draco stared wide-eyed at Harry for a moment. He turned his head slowly to see that yes, one metal leg was bent at a horrible angle, the other three splayed wide, but the vase of white flowers and pastel biscuit box were suspended on thin air.
Draco had no idea what Potter was playing at. Even with his casual posture, there was a discomforting sharpness to his expression, something that made Draco feel like a bug beneath glass, as Potter poised over him, ready to pluck the wings from his back. Had Potter always been this threatening? He didn't think so. The Potter in his memories always seemed so loose and warm. And before that? Menacing, for certain, but never this. Never calculating and predatory, and it set Draco's teeth on edge, made him want to fidget and adjust the seams of his shirt and trousers to shuffle his feet against the carpet. And Draco Malfoy
Draco licked his lips once before crouching on the floor, dragging his eyes from the heat of Potter’s gaze to the scar at the inside of his thigh. All the humour drained from Draco then, as well as some of the heat, because it was an ugly, red thing, still jagged and so damn long that Draco found his chest tightening to the point of pain. It was too close to that artery, and Draco could still remember the icy shock of fear that flashed through him when he first saw it. There was so much blood — the life force leaking from him as Harry once again placed his survival in Draco’s shaking but capable hands.
"Thank you," Draco said. He settled back in his chair. Hermione handed him a container and a fork, which he poked at, even took a bite, but it tasted like ash in his mouth, and he set it aside.
Draco grumbles in response, tripping alongside her and out into the cold air. He shivers as the late November wind whips against his sweat-damp skin, but neglects the warming charm because it helps to clear his head. At least it isn’t raining.
"That's rich, coming from you. But yes, I promise not to do anything stupid and Potterish whilst my keeper is away." Draco stepped between Potter's spread knees, placed a hand on either side of his head and kissed him. Potter responded beautifully, as always, sighing into the kiss and twisting his fingers into the hair at Draco's nape. Draco kissed him because there was no way to tell Potter that he was afraid he might actually miss him. When Draco pulled away, Potter blinked slowly, a small smile curling the corners of his lips.
Draco couldn't get an accurate count on the number of assailants still standing, but it felt like too many. They needed a better plan than allowing Bridges to clobber them into submission with her fists while Potter brought the bloody roof down on top of their heads. The place was a damned lab! It was full of potential weapons, if one knew what to look for. Draco only required a couple of ingredients in a decent quantity to shut the whole thing down. That is, if they weren't already in pieces on the floor and leaking their noxious poison into the air. He would have to move quickly.
Draco made it until eight in the morning before waking with a start and a strangled shout from a nightmare of all-consuming darkness. The flat was quiet, and he tugged on his dressing gown and stumbled to the living room to find the sofa empty and the kitchen vacant.
Theo shifts on his feet, and Draco turns towards him, taking in the uncertain tilt of his mouth and the way he’s chewing at his cheek. Draco realises with a small pang of regret that Nott really is quite handsome, with his chestnut hair and high cheekbones. It’s a pity Draco feels nothing for him beyond a tentative friendship, if even that.
On Wednesday, following an afternoon of running errands, Draco arrived at the shop to find two large, classical grey urns bursting with blooms: begonias, petunias, and a tumbling cascade of blue lobelia, all swaying in the frigid breeze as if were July rather than late October. Hannah had tacked an invoice to the door with spell-o-tape for an exorbitant amount of money, along with a note that was mildly apologetic but good humoured. She even offered him a coffee
Draco released his hand in Harry’s hair and Harry pushed back to his knees with a sigh of relief, fucking himself down onto Draco’s cock as Draco watched, splayed across the mattress. He continued to tug gently at Harry’s jutting erection, stopping only to lick his palm to smooth the friction. Harry sighed at that, his hips stuttering slightly as he struggled to thrust into Draco’s palm while pressing down against the cock in his arse.
Draco shifted on his stool, leaning against the countertop in an attempt to appear casual, but by the way Lilian's mouth tipped to the side and her eyes slanted in his direction, he was less than successful.
Potter frowned. Or Draco thought he was frowning. It was difficult to tell through all the gauze. “I thought you were a thing.”
The air in Potter's lungs hissed out between his teeth as Draco felt Potter's forehead drop against his thigh. After a moment, Potter sat back, and his fingers pulled free from Draco's body. Draco moaned at the loss, but then Potter was over him, one hand braced on the mattress beside his head, the other sliding over his own cock in lazy strokes. Potter's face was so close to his, and he looked so different without his glasses — eyes bright and shining, even in the dark room. There was a lovely fevered flush across his cheek bones, and Draco found he quite liked the way the muscles in Potter's arms flexed. He gave into the urge to run questing fingers across the straining tendons, coming to rest on either side of Potter's neck.
Draco reeled back, the shock on his face apparent and a rejection on the tip of his tongue. But Emile shook his head and chuckled, holding up a placating hand.
Draco quite liked that place. They had excellent pastries and their almond croissant was one of his most favourite things in the world.
Draco was charmed. He was instantly reminded of a sweet garden plaza near his flat in Paris where, in the summer, he would find a shady corner to while away a few hours people-watching or reading. He could almost imagine himself doing that here and pondered as to whether the café would grow busy by midday, if they carried the sparkling white wine he preferred, or if children liked to play in the fountain during the summer months. But he shook off the thought almost as quickly as it came, because none of that mattered. He wouldn't stay long enough to find out.
She grinned. “We both know I’m only here for the booze.” She raised a glass of cloudy liquid that Draco could smell from where he was standing.
“Too right,” Ron agreed with a grin. “Remember when Harry tried to get a donation out of Lady Dalton and she thought he was coming onto her?”
“Why would you want a model when you had Potter? Brains and brawn?” She gave an exaggerated shiver. “Delicious. But then again, I’d reconsider the brains bit since he left you here all alone. And for a
Draco could tell that Potter was already teetering on the edge, his hips rocking in tantalising circles against the intrusion in his arse, pressing his leaking cock into the back of Draco’s throat.
“Aren't you precious,” Ms. Witherbottom crooned, then spun away on one heel toward a sweet little Nottingham townhouse. “This way boys! You’re going to love this place. All the original hardware has been restored. It gives the house a wonderful sense of history and character, but the appliances are all new, top of the line, of course, as you requested.”
Potter laughed, a deep sound, like waves crashing against rocks and something hot churned in Draco’s gut, against his better judgement. He wasn’t sure he’d ever heard Potter laugh like that, and part of him wanted to hear it again.
Did he know the power he wielded? Draco couldn’t be sure, and he was torn between wanting Harry to know and needing to bury that deep down where no one could see it. Because Draco Malfoy didn’t beg during sex. His mouth didn’t water over the sight of a few buttons undone on a man’s shirt or how low his jeans hung on his hips. He was a man of control and composure. Until he got his hands on Harry Potter, of course.
Draco had two hours before he was scheduled to meet Potter, but he was certain he stunk of stewed mandrake from working on a recent batch of Invigoration Draught with Eryn. After showering, he changed his shirt a dozen times until half his wardrobe lay in a crumpled heap on his bed, and Draco was still bare-chested. He eventually gave up, deciding simple was best since Potter hadn't even bothered with shoes the last time they met. And he didn't want Potter thinking he'd
He wanted it to last forever. He wanted as much to hang on the precipice for eternity as he did to fling himself off the cliff and chase his release. The aching burn was growing insistent and he was struggling to stay still, to keep from bucking his hips. And Harry was unrelenting in his ministrations.
It would have been a silly thing to say, were it anyone else. But Draco knows exactly what he’s doing. He knows that if Harry kisses him, he’s going to take him home. They’re going to leave Ron and that nameless dipshit with the tie checking their watches and staring at the bathroom door, because they aren’t coming back.
Draco rolled his eyes and snatched the packet of parchment back, returning it to its position on the shelf. "I don't know, Emile. It isn't usually polite to ask that sort of thing in an interview."
you to dinner. I’m telling you we have to eat dinner together in public. I’ll even let you pay, if you have anything left in your vaults after tonight.”
Harry’s eyes on him were fierce as he wrapped one hand around Draco’s erection and began to stoke him in long, steady pulls. He was going to come. He couldn’t stop it now, not with the way the sparks were flying behind his eyelids. With a gasp and a shout, Draco came, clenching around Harry’s cock and spilling himself over Harry’s fingers, their slick drag across Draco’s sensitive flesh warring between intense pleasure and pain. Harry worked him through it until he was shuddering beneath his hands.
Draco leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. “So, what exactly did you do to that twat Robards to get this assignment?”
Unfortunately for Pansy, Blaise arrives a full thirty minutes early, and she is still traipsing around with a Miu Miu platform on one foot and Choo stiletto on the other, trying to decide which she likes better with her miniskirt. She has to scamper to the back to make herself look presentable, though Blaise likely wouldn’t notice if she wears wellies and a poncho.
“I plan to. And anyway, it makes me seem mysterious, don’t you think?” Potter said, taking a long pull of his beer, lips curled around the mouth of the bottle in a way that was far more distracting than Draco would prefer.
pinged across his brain, bouncing off the sides, echoing in his ears over and over. Draco braced his heels against the mattress so he could better fuck into his fist, deep, rolling thrusts as he imagined horrible things, like pressing Potter face down into the sofa and fucking into him, with one hand in his hair and the other around his throat. He wanted to feel those desperate sounds rumble against the palm of his hand, wanted to taste them on his tongue and lap at the space beneath Potter’s ear, drinking in the sweet, intoxicating scent of him.
It was easier to keep his head down and mind his own business. There were fewer questions to answer that way, and Draco was telling the truth when he said he didn't need friends, because friends expected you to tell them things, real things,
Draco skimmed the gentle tips of his fingers over Potter’s hole and watched as every muscle in his body tensed, then went lax as he exhaled. Draco pushed a finger in. Potter hissed, but it wasn’t a sound of pain, rather one of relief as Draco breached his body, sliding his middle finger inside of him until the webbing was flush with Potter’s body. He held it there for a moment, watching Potter’s expression, waiting for his brows to relax, for the wrinkle across his forehead to ease, but instead, Potter said, “
Potter's broomstick listed to the left and then the right, as if swaying in the wind as Potter thought. "He's fit," Potter said. "And funny. And thinks the world of me."
Potter left the bike parked next to the house and Draco followed him to the front door, which opened under his hand — no key, no fortress of wards.
“I’m thinking about how I can convince you to quit dithering around and get your cock in me before I die of old age,” Draco said through a clenched jaw.
try to get Potter's attention by spelling his shoelaces together and covertly sticking bits of holly garland in that bird's nest he called hair?
The third candidate was already waiting outside Draco's shop when he arrived, which was annoying as the interview wasn't for another forty minutes and Draco was still only half a cappuccino deep. He was a man of middling years with a forgettable face and a moth-eaten jumper. He was highly qualified, perhaps overly so, but he flattered Draco, quoting back to him passages from articles he'd submitted to various journals. While Draco respected his theoretical approach to potion making and his interest in experimentation, there was something about him that Draco found unsettling. There was a shiftiness to his gaze, a restless twitching of his fingers that had Draco's hand itching for his wand. Draco's first instinct was that the man, Charles was his name, might be an addict. But he lacked the telltale jaundice and runny nose of a regular potion abuser, and Draco gave him the benefit of the doubt. It wasn't uncommon for intelligent people like Charles to lack social skills.
. Do keep up, Jonathan. I find it absolutely loathsome that he be so bloody attractive. Massive gits like him should have boils and patchy beards and flabby arses. But instead, he’s the embodiment of tall, dark, and brooding and I think it’s driving me mad.”
Potter chuckled but turned and faced forward, hands in his pockets. Draco fell into step beside him.
The first thing Draco did was call his private banker in New York and have a sizable sum of cash, both Muggle and wizarding, available for pick up. There was no way he was going to let Gringotts get their grubby little hands on it, certainly not when the authorities were trailing him, and Muggle credit cards left too much evidence. Cash would have to do.
Unbidden, the image of Draco with those hands that belong to Harry curled around another man’s tie pops into his head. He cringes and squeezes his eyes shut, desperate to chase the image away, but all it does is morph into Draco beneath that man, as he is beneath Harry now, gasping and sweating, mouth slack with pleasure, eyes glassy.
Draco's eyes flicked open to find Harry looking back at him. His normally bright gaze was dull, and his skin tinged with grey, but there were pale dots of colour on his cheeks. The corner of his lips twitched as Draco blinked rapidly, waiting for the fog of the dream to dissipate only to find Harry still there. Awake.
His voice hovered on the last words, then he sighed and sunk into the little patio chair next to Draco. Draco handed him the cigarette, and Emile took a drag.
Potter was using his hands too, spreading the globes of Draco’s arse wide with his palms, dipping his fingers in to chase the slick trail of his tongue against Draco’s body. Draco felt like his limbs had turned to jelly and he struggled to stay upright, his spine bowed and almost feline under Potter’s lurid ministrations. Potter dipped the tip of his thumb inside Draco’s body, stretching the rim with this finger and tongue. The hot ache in Draco’s belly had returned full force and he could feel the blood rushing directly to his cock. He was getting hard again, but it felt different from the first time. Now, it built slowly, burning its way through Draco’s veins, churning in his gut until it distilled, so razor sharp it was dizzying.
“I’ll get you to say it properly yet, Harry Potter,” he said, and then withdrew back to his side of the table.
Potter threw Draco an uncomfortable glance over his shoulder and, with a nod, Draco fell back a step. As much as he wanted to watch Potter row with his boyfriend, he figured Potter wouldn't appreciate it, and was likely planning to give Draco the boot as soon as he wrapped up his conversation. He wouldn't want Draco around when Shilmore showed up. Even if they were fighting, they were probably the types to engage in enthusiastic make-up sex, and Draco's stomach roiled at the thought. Potter was the passionate sort, and Shilmore was clearly smitten, if the angry looks he shot at Draco after the game meant anything.
Even in the low light, Draco could see Potter beaming. Potter dropped his grip on the broomstick handle, his booted feet flung wide as he hooted and cheered. The broom dipped abruptly, but Potter tightened his knees and spun with it, barrel rolling and laughing like he'd won the bloody World Cup.
Draco slumped into one of the hard plastic folding chairs tucked into the corner of the room for guests. The room was empty now, and he ran a hand across his damp brow and shut his eyes, just for a moment.
"Malfoy?" Potter said, voice rough as he rubbed at one eye with his fist, glasses pushed up onto his forehead. "It's two in the morning. What's wrong?"
Draco didn’t make a habit of drinking to excess on work nights, or at all, really. But Draco was in crisis. He’d been publicly humiliated, made a fool of in front of the entirety of Wizarding England, and if that didn’t warrant a little over-indulgence, he didn’t know what did. And the pardoning of Noah’s infidelity in the press was just insulting, as if it was something Draco
, how he wanted him. He tried to label it as some symptom of prolonged isolation combined with seeing Harry exclusively in domestic spaces – the surreal attachment that came with playacting a couple in love. But it felt like a lie.
Potter extracted his fingers from Draco's, and Draco had only a moment to suffer their loss before he felt them tracing the bruise-dark circles under his eyes. He kept his lids squeezed shut, unwilling to see the gentle concern on Potter's face for fear it might make him sick, or worse, make him cry.
"Yes, well, I was going for urban chic, but I see your point," Draco sniped, his voice edged with venom.
The movement of Harry's gaze stilled, no longer searching, and he nodded, his mouth lifting at one corner. It wasn't the cocky smirk that usually had Draco's trousers at his ankles in seconds, nor the toothy one he wore around his friends. It was soft, a little unsure and so… new. So Draco did the only thing he could. He kissed it right off Harry’s face.
Harry lowers his face, gaze boring into Draco’s. “If you didn’t want it, you could have said so,” he says in a harsh whisper. “I wouldn’t have done it if I didn't think —” He sucks in a shuddering breath as his eyes flutter shut.
Draco snorts and smiles. “The suit, yes. Not the shirt. I’m afraid you’ll have to take that up with Giorgio Armani.”
“Harry,” Draco said, the name rolling off his tongue like a purr, then announced his address, and was gone.
Harry hums against his neck, then steps back. He removes his jacket carefully, then strips off the ruined white shirt, dragging it through the mess on his skin, and tosses it aside. He throws the jacket (which is still pristine and without a single wrinkle) over his bare shoulder and waves a hand towards the front of the shop. “Well, show me what you’ve got.”
Draco squeezed his eyes closed, but it was no use. The tears pushed through his eyelids, burning their way down his cheeks. He sensed his mother's presence, close enough to be warm, but she didn't touch him, for which he was grateful.
“Mostly it’s just distracting. People cast mundane spells all day long. But like I said, I can usually tune it out, and sometimes I don’t notice it at all. But yours,” he pursed his lips. “Yours is
Harry smiled at him over his shoulder, then got to his feet. Draco watched from his face-down position in the pillow as Harry tugged on a fresh pair of pants from his dresser, then shuffled over to the refrigerator. Draco smirked as he admired the curve of Harry’s arse as he dug around in one of the cooler drawers. Because bloody hell, it was gorgeous. He pondered on the possibilities of getting Harry into that ridiculous bathtub to soak him in fragrant lavender soap of his, then spend the rest of the evening eating that fantastic arse. There was no better way to bring Harry to tears, he reckoned, and Draco’s tongue was clever with more than just words.
“Excuse me if I don’t look surprised,” Draco grumbled. “Now, is there a reason you’re sitting in my office? You aren’t meant to be here for another hour.”
It was then that Draco realised Potter was gone, his hiding place behind the palm conspicuously abandoned. Draco wanted to growl, because Potter was off somewhere without supervision, probably drinking too much and plotting to do something improper, as he so often did at such events. Only this time, Draco’s name was on the line as well.
“Yeah, well, it’s a bit easier to remain mysterious when there aren’t cameras lurking around every corner,” Potter said as he dog-eyed a wizard sat to their left, who was clearly attempting to eavesdrop — the flashbulb of a camera peeking out the top of his rucksack. “No paparazzi in the middle of the jungle or at the top of a glacier.”
Potter turns to Draco. “Is she flirting with me? I can’t tell, because it comes out sounding like an insult.”
Pansy smiled at him — or at least Draco thought she meant it to be a smile, but her mouth curled in the wrong direction and her eyes were wet. The smile Draco returned was equally strained. She nodded at him, then she left. And Draco was alone, staring at his half-packed bags and the Portkey on his dresser.
“Ronald! Don’t give him those!” Hermione said, her voice chiding. “Oh, Harry, please don’t smoke. It’s a terrible habit.”
Potter grabbed the hideous horse sculpture from the front table and, using it as a microphone, sang with him.
He wasn't in the study, rearranging Harry's bookshelves or straightening the photo of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in front of Hogwarts looking young, fresh-faced, and painfully new.
"Know what?" Draco mumbled against the back of Harry's hand, lips brushing against the scars there. Then he released him, because if he held it any longer, he wouldn't be able to let go.
"No, I mean with the Dreamless Sleep. He thinks that was his fault. He still talks about it sometimes. Harry gets maudlin when he drinks, which is why he hardly ever drinks anymore. He thinks if he'd just… said what he meant, stayed instead of left, that he could have saved you."
Draco's smirk stayed put as he placed a hand against Harry's chest and sent him stumbling toward the bed. The backs of Harry's knees hit the mattress and he let his weight give way, sinking down until he was eye-level with Draco's navel.
Draco shrugged. The truth was, he'd fallen a bit in love with the strange Muggle machine. It reminded him of the moving pictures in wizarding papers, but even more exciting because the telly had explosions and sex scenes and
Draco sips his drink to keep from croaking. “Evening, Potter,” he says, and is pleased that it comes out smooth and unwavering.
"Don't be daft," Hannah said with a wave of her hand. "He doesn't give any details. Harry is annoyingly tight-lipped about that sort of thing. Mostly, he just broods and grumbles about 'bastards' and 'right wankers disrupting his peace.'"
start doing bad things, people will start questioning everything. They’ll be all, ‘oh my word, Harry Potter’s gone to the dark side, maybe everything I’ve ever known is a lie. Maybe law and order and Merlin himself are all just figments of the collective imagination and the only real way to live is total anarchy. Fuck it all, perhaps I’ll just chuck my morals off London bridge and begin a life of crime and depravity.’”
again. It wasn't because Harry Potter was on the front page Friday morning. Of course not. It was good for Draco to catch up on current events in England. And if there was a lengthy write up about Potter, well, it couldn't be helped.
Draco loses himself to his thoughts, feeling terribly sorry for himself as he walks towards the Brixton tube station. He doesn’t see the Muggle in the faded hoodie hiding in the alleyway next to the Tesco carpark until he’s on him, shoving Draco against a wall with a hand at his chest and a knife in his face.
No, there was no way Malfoy would push him away – not now that Harry could feel the hardness pressed up against his thigh, the shortness of Malfoy’s breath against his neck. But would he push it? If Harry gave him the opportunity, would he take it? He had to find out.
"Got Potter into a pair of them for the March issue," Pansy said, sharp brows twitching upwards. "They're making a comeback. You'll see."
The man chuckled. "Actually, I've been following your research independently. The study you published in
It didn’t feel right, to just leave without a word. He had a feeling maybe Draco preferred it like that, but it wasn’t Harry’s way. So, he found a quill and left a note on the nearest piece of paper he could find – which just so happened to be the Witch Weekly March issue featuring Harry in his pants. He flipped to the proper page and scribbled across the picture in thick black script.
Draco tapped his index finger against his chin as he thought. Draco wanted for nothing. He had money and prestige, all the beautiful things he could ever desire. He appraised Potter, looking him up and down. Potter had nothing to offer him. Unless…
Something about the collar isn’t quite right. Draco collects a necktie from the display and holds it up against Potter’s chest.
The server thankfully chose that moment to interrupt and declare the additional table ready, then guided the quickly purpling Noah and his cowering intern towards the opposite side of the restaurant.
Harry Potter kissed like…well…exactly like one would imagine Harry Potter would kiss (not Draco though, he’d never imagined so preposterous a scenario as this). It was confident and bold and more than a little arrogant. Draco shouldn’t have kissed back; it would have served Potter right. But Potter tasted minty and he smelled rather nice up close and though Draco was loathed to admit it, he was rather good at this kissing business, causing heat to pool in Draco’s gut with just the brush of his tongue.
He could only hide in his room for so long, and there was already the unexpected scent of coffee wafting through the doors to his room, which meant not only was Potter awake, but he was touching things in Draco’s kitchen.
Granger was the first to rush forward, clutching Potter’s freshly healed hand between her own. Lovegood was right behind her, hands fluttering and eyes brimming with tears as she straightened Potter’s thin hospital blankets while Granger adjusted his pillow. Ronald was next, boisterous and shouting, all limbs and flaming hair.
It took a bit of searching before Harry found Ginny. She was tucked away from the party at the edge of the garden, perched on a crumbling rock wall with her skirt rucked up to her knees. She wore red Converse trainers under the yards of sparkling white tulle, and there was a very full glass of whisky in her hand. She saw Harry approaching and her lips twitched.
“Okay, gross,” Potter’s nose crinkled, but he appeared to be stifling a smile. “And don’t you think you’re being a little dramatic?”
Potter leaned forward and slapped Weasley once on the shoulder, to which Weasley nodded. Potter stood, propping one booted foot on the worn leather of the seat. He looped an arm around the overhead bar and took out his wand, which he pointed at his own throat, then tucked it into the back of his jeans. Draco watched, baffled and twisted in his seat, as Potter cupped his hands around his mouth and let out a strange sound, low and throaty, that echoed between the hills, carrying over the blast of the music and the distant crash of the waves beyond the cliffs.
“Or maybe it was just the previous company you preferred?” Potter said, his voice edged with humour, and Draco wanted to laugh at how wrong he really was.
“I doubted your motives, yes. I was certain you were here for… other reasons. Foolish reasons. But now I see you have poured your heart into this. And it is stunning. Bravo,” Emile said, clapping his hands together. “Bravo, my love.”
Potter watched him, fevered gaze flitting between Draco’s slick cock, the pink flush of his chest, and the feral hunger in his eyes. And when Draco sat back and lined himself up, Potter’s focus didn’t demur. He licked his lips and tightened his fists around the bars of the headboard, one calf sliding against the outside of Draco’s thigh. It was an oddly soothing gesture and an invitation if Draco ever felt one. Without further hesitation, Draco took a deep breath and pressed in. He buried himself to the hilt in one smooth movement, lube easing the friction.
Harry expected Malfoy to agree to the same and follow her to the door, but he stayed planted where he was on Harry’s sofa, one long leg crossed over the other and his arms stretched out over the backrest, looking as settled as a kneazle.
It’s more than a little undignified, they way they find themselves rutting against surfaces, grinding against each other in the backs of pubs again and again. They’re grown men, for Merlin’s sake, not teenagers. A bit of rubbing shouldn’t be so bloody hot. It shouldn’t be enough to get Harry leaking into his boxer briefs. It shouldn’t be enough to make Draco curse colourfully.
Potter took one step closer, but not close enough for Draco to get his hands around his neck, so Draco grabbed him by the lapel of his jacket and dragged him in. As he looped the tie around Potter’s collar, Draco tried not to think about the fact that Potter smelled rather nice — like honey and something woodsy with a touch of smoke. He tipped Potter’s chin with a finger to get a better angle as he tied the knot, then yanked it tight enough to make Potter choke.
Draco just scoffed and stumbled elegantly into his flat, where he fell asleep face-first on the sofa.
Draco tossed an Incarcerous at the body against the door for good measure, then ducked a curse that came from only Merlin knew where.
But here, on Pansy's balcony, it was just the two of them. After spending so much time alone with Harry, it was strange that Draco suddenly wasn't sure how to act. He raised a hesitant hand that hovered in the air between them, and when Harry grinned up at him, he allowed it to settle at Harry's temple. He smoothed a curl behind his ear and let his hand rest there, cradling Harry's skull.
“Where’s that Draco Malfoy confidence? Where’s the man who convinced me this would work in the first place?” Marcus slapped Draco on the back. “Come on. I’ll buy you a drink.”
Harry blinks at him, then pushes up on one elbow. His clothes are still tangled around him and Draco nearly reaches out to start buttoning him up. He can’t
Emile frowned. "What is there to understand? Did you not call me at near dawn looking as though you've seen a ghost? What are you really doing in London, Draco? That isn't your world anymore. Those aren't your people. You've told me a hundred times; they will always see you as the child you were. They have suffered as you have, and their memories are just as long." Emile paused, and he leaned forward, his expression imploring. "Tell me the truth. Have the dreams started again?"
Draco reeled back slightly, his eyebrows leaping up. “Why on earth would I have told you? I haven’t seen you in years, Potter. Were you holding out for an owl? Did you think we were friends? That you
“Yes,” Harry says, pumping his fist at his side. He turns around to face forward and bumps Draco’s shoulder with his own. “Will you get the chicken so I can get the fish?”
Draco groaned, shifting on his stool to position his back to Emile, rotating away when Emile followed him, leaning against the worktop. "Why do you have to call him that?"
That wasn't what Draco expected. "I've not seen my cousin in many years, I'm afraid. Though I try to remember to send a card on his birthday."
"I haven't decided." She was still smiling, her voice sweet and sing-songy. Though Draco wanted to distrust her, he found it difficult. She was odd, that was for certain, but there wasn't the slightest trace of sinister intent behind her soft expression. Draco couldn't fathom how she and Pansy got on so well. What the bloody hell did they talk about?
Draco gave the girl a reassuring nod, which she returned, then spun to catch the young man as he crumpled to the floor.
“What you do with your time is your own business,” Robards said. “So long as you stay out of trouble and don’t break any laws, then you’ll be free to go about your business after your time is served. You will, of course, be required to submit to regular check-ins with a parole Auror, at which time your wand will be subjected to a revealing spell, just to make sure you are staying within the parameters of your sentence.”
"Indeed." Renaud picked up a bottle of wine and filled Draco and Emile's glasses, then his own. "I grew… disenchanted with my position in the French Ministry — corrupt, bureaucratic, and inefficient as it is. I have recently come into a sum of money and am looking for worthwhile investments. My brother is in real estate and has located potential locations for boutique apothecaries along with an off-site location that could support brewing on a larger scale than your current employer can accommodate. I would like to offer you the storefront, to do with as you please, with the contingency that you increase your brewing capacity for distribution to hospitals in the greater Paris area."
. He has Pansy. And Blaise, when he isn’t working. He went on three dates with a very fit bloke from the styling department at Which Broomstick magazine in February, and sometimes his Aunt Andromeda invites him around for tea now that Narcissa has passed.
to be nice, tried to be the sort of bloke you wanted to befriend, the type you might date, the type you could hire for a job, or perhaps the type you didn’t throw into prison to rot — but sometimes, he slipped. He still said rude things to Granger when she corrected him because it was so bloody obnoxious that any person be so condescending and so unerringly
Emile tossed the dishes into the sink and, with a flamboyant wave of his wand and a sing-songy utterance of a cleaning charm, the dishes began washing themselves.
Draco turned on his heel and strode from the room. Lucius and Narcissa were right behind him, but Draco was quicker, making his way to the front door before Lucius could block his way, before Narcissa could grasp his sleeve. It was all planned and he was prepared. He snagged the leather jacket from the coat rack, recently borrowed and still smelling of wood smoke, pine needles, earl grey, and
Harry lines himself up and pushes in, tearing a shattering groan from Draco, the arms propping him on all fours shaking, threatening to give way. Draco takes it so well and Harry smiles, pleased, as he gives an experimental thrust of his hips, luxuriating in the tight drag around his cock.
"So, the handcuffs are just for fun then?" Draco asked, gesturing at the holster belt affixed to Potter's waist, visible through the part in his scarlet robes. Potter huffed a laugh as Draco turned to Hannah. "I'll take a Cabernet, pet. And make it a good one. Put it on Potter's tab."
Harry groaned. He tried to focus his magic, but it felt volatile and imbalanced. He struggled to harness it to his will as he cupped his hand over Draco's and concentrated on the spell.
"There's that astounding intellect I remember. Yes, Potter, it is. And since I suffered a fairly major setback in the form of a break-in, if you recall, I have quite a lot of work to do. Surely there is another potions expert in all of England that you could bother with this."
“This probably,” Harry said, but that wasn’t exactly true. Harry imagined more. He imagined love. Travel. Adventure. He imagined doing something besides grinding away at his job where he was nothing more than a figurehead.
Malfoy never bothered to hide his Dark Mark, Harry noticed. He nearly flinched the first time he saw it again, when Malfoy was pressed against the dank basement wall that first night, as Harry’s spell curled its way around his wrists. It appeared to have faded slightly, gone gray and bled into the lilywhite skin of Malfoy’s inner arm. Harry wanted to touch it, to know if the skin there was raised or scarred, if it felt like regular skin.
Harry’s lips hover an inch from Draco’s as he pushes in. Draco’s mouth falls open on a silent gasp. It feels as though he’s being split in half. Even Harry’s careful ministrations weren’t enough to prepare him for this. Harry pauses but Draco will have none of it, because he doesn’t care if it hurts; this pain is nothing compared to what comes after. He wraps both thighs around Harry’s hips, locking his ankles at the small of Harry’s back, and nudges him gently. Harry’s tongue swipes across Draco’s bottom lip, followed by a nip, and then he’s pushing in, bottoming out in one long, relentless slide.
Draco's brain returned to him all at once. He grabbed Potter by the shoulder and rolled him onto his back roughly and clambered up his body until he was hovering over Potter's chest. He bent forward, grabbing Potter's jaw roughly in one hand and fisting his own prick in his other hand. He jerked himself hard and rough. The dreamy look on Potter's face turned to one of realisation and a touch of awe only a second before Draco painted it with his come. He groaned as it poured from him in silvery stripes across Potter's flushed face. He squeezed his eyes shut as he rode out the aftershocks, his muscles weak with bliss.
Draco’s stomach jumped and cramped, and he ground his teeth together until his jaw ticked. He sucked in a sharp breath through his nose when Harry’s teeth grazed across the pad of his thumb.
Draco let his breath fan across Potter’s cock, watched as it throbbed, a pearly bead of precome forming at the slit. Potter’s hips twitched upwards, a purposeful plea for touch, to which Draco splayed a flat palm against the fluttering muscles of his stomach, pressing him into the mattress, stilling any further desperate movements.
“We’ll have to work on your manners,” Draco murmured, breath ghosting over Potter’s straining erection, and he chuckled as the bed frame gave another groaning lurch. “But you said please. And that’s good enough for me.”
He dared to open his eyes. Harry’s expression was crumpled, his eyes squeezed shut and his bottom lip clamped so tight between his teeth it had gone white. His hair was a mess, splayed across the sheets in a halo of raven curls. He was fucking gorgeous and when Draco raised his hips just a fraction to sink back down onto Harry’s cock, his eyes flew open.
Harry narrowed his eyes and snatched the potion from Draco, removing the cork and holding it out, “Come on!”
“...You’re still trying to save people,” Draco said, “With the fundraisers and galas, I can tell you hate them just as much.”
“At least I’ll have the suit, so it’s not a complete waste,” Malfoy said to himself, brushing an invisible speck of dust off the pristine white fabric.
She had trouble conceiving of a Malfoy outside of the one she had known for the first six years of school. But she had decided she would understand him, no matter her doubts. Because he was becoming important to Harry, very quickly; as fast as Harry had latched onto Ron when they were eleven, he seemed to be drawn to Malfoy now. Harry was one of her best friends, she would make it work.
forearms on the frame. He took the message from his pocket and smoothed the wrinkled parchment half-heartedly. He read
“You needn’t worry about him, he’s in the holding of appropriate authorities. However, if you hit your head, I must strongly recommend you seek medical care,” Malfoy said.
Bedlum stopped, and burst out laughing, in great huge booming laughs. She screwed the lid back onto the jar and put it back in the cabinet her laughing dying down only marginally.
Harry hated the thought of them being around him, watching him, watching Draco who deserved to be left alone. He swallowed, and the lump in his throat bloomed into a simmer of heat, anger and desire and frustration, “...I don’t want them looking at you. I don’t want them bothering you.”
Draco drew in deeply, the end of the cigarette burning cherry red in the night, and breathed out a slow stream of smoke into the sky. “There’s something about it, something… tactile and the way it makes my head feel that I quite like,” he grinned wryly, “Provided I’m drunk enough to put up with the rest of it.”
He had said that some things were best suffered through to better learn not to be foolish in the future.
As Harry watched, he suddenly understood, everything felt wrong because Malfoy was so wrong, so muggle and slick and…different.
Draco Malfoy, Potion Master consultant for the Auror's, is assisting Harry in finding an illegal dittany grow operation, in the middle of a swamp, and no, they aren't getting on.
Draco passed the cigarette over, and Harry took it, letting the smoke linger in his lungs, breathing it out slowly. He felt light-headed.
Draco glared at him, milk in hand as he filled his bowl and added a splash to the mug under stasis and two spoons of sugar.
“You’re finally here!” Andromeda said, wiping her hands dry as she walked from the kitchen, through the living room, her voice fading as she headed up the stairs, “Get dressed. I’ll check on Teddy.”
Someone behind his shoulder held out another chocolate frog box. Draco was a bit bored of the game but everyone was watching so he opened it anyway and blinked. The chocolate frog jumped away unheeded as he stared, the card wasn't Harry Potter.

Malfoy paused, his pen poised above the paper. He lifted his sunglasses up, resting them on top of his head so he could narrow his eyes at Harry, “Have
Malfoy ignored him and leaned close to the dog. His voice was a soft murmur that made the dog wag its tail in a gentle sweep back and forth, its flat face and bulgy goldfish eyes watching Malfoy’s face with rapt attention.
Harry scanned through the canopy and spotted a little fluff of white high up in the canopy. He used the branches to guide himself up to a Y-junction near the top where something that mostly looked like a fluffy white cat was clinging to the bark for dear life. It had the look of an animal who had panicked and used instinct to run away before realising too late that those new instincts belonged to an animal that climbed trees, while the dog mind inside it was usually at ankle height and had anxiety.
“Well, it’s not going badly. We talk about things I could do mostly. Sometimes she has me help with grading or testing out demonstrations. Everything feels a bit
“I told him I was from the council and if he kept letting his dog roam free I would call the dog warden on him,” Harry said.
Two other junior aurors left as Harry approached, giving him a nod in acknowledgement as they passed, leaving only him and Auror Shunter.
All he would have to do is squeeze, it would be so easy- Draco felt his hands twitch, his heartbeat picking up with a sudden burst of adrenaline and excitement.
Malfoy turned around, stepping close and pressing the little dog between them, “Put your arms where mine are.”
“Coming, coming,” a voice called, soon to be followed by an old man opening the door. He was pleasantly round and seemed to carry a permanent smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes.
“Ah! Princess! There you are my Princess!” the man crooned and scooped the dog, Princess, out of Harry’s hands before he could react.
Draco took out his brewing notebook and flipped to his notes wolfsbane,  “Shall I get the ingredients
, if you can believe it. Hickenbottom and Hickenbotham living side by side, getting mail mixed up and people coming around to the wrong door. Funny old world isn’t it?”
reached over and squeezed his arm, “The paper isn’t due for a week, would you rather drink fire whiskey until we pass out?”
Harry dragged himself back to the stove. The soup was canned, but Harry hadn’t learned the knack for a home-made soup that tasted half as good. He put the soup in a small pot to heat on the stove.
Draco flicked the cigarette butt onto the ground with a faint splash of orange sparks, “Vanish that, would you?”
Andromeda did up the last of the buttons with a quick charm, “But it might not have, and it was still scary wasn’t it?”
Draco held out two small vials filled with a pale orange potion, “De-ageing potion. It will make us about eight years old for two hours.”
The washer beeped loudly as it finished, and Harry went back to the utility room, pulling out the damp sheets and clothes and pushing them into the dryer.
“Morning,” Harry said, wondering if he should feel awkward, if he was overstepping by still being here. “Sorry, I fell asleep last night.”
quicksilver that made him freeze as if it might disappear. He would never have thought it before, why would Harry Potter have any reason
He spoke quietly, though his gentle Scottish brogue easily carried through the crowd, “Welcome all, friends and family, living and dead. Let us celebrate the harvest, our health, and what good tidings have come. We hope for the winter to be gentle, the coming year to be bountiful, and to find peace and happiness in this world and the next.” He paused and then jerked his hand up, and up with it came a cheer as two fiddles began to play a bright tune.
one another, as they tended to do since becoming a couple. It was gag-worthy, but meant that Potter usually had the seat open beside him.
“They did the same thing to Albus Dumbledore. He was a professor, so they pushed him into being Headmaster,” Shunter said, “You see it a lot throughout history, powerful people in powerful positions. I don’t know if they just like the tradition or believe that someone with great magic is destined to greatness like Merlin. Or, and this is very cynical of me, having them in powerful positions keeps them pinned in one place so they can’t cause trouble. You can’t learn dangerous magic and gather followers if you’re too busy working a demanding job.”
Just because Potter had a jawline that practically begged to licked didn't mean Draco wouldn't get some sort of revenge.
Malfoy turned on his heel and walked over to his car, hand catching the door handle and pausing, “Strange isn’t it that my laughing at it seems to make them all so mad.” The door swung open, the car dipping for a second as Malfoy sat heavily.
It took every ounce of will in Harry’s body not to fling the small animal off his hand. He breathed through his nose, holding very, very still except to shift his weight back and send the broom slowly descending towards the ground.
“Right before bed, nothing better for falling sleep than dull ministry stuff. I sleep like a baby,” Shunter said with a wry grin. She looked at her watch with a frown, “Bugger. Alright, Potter, you’re in charge of the scene. Our shopkeep is taking a nap behind the counter. Once the new department shows, you can get their paperwork, add it to ours and take down the wards. Got all that?” Shunter said, rolling her shoulders with new energy now that she was no longer the one who’d be babysitting an empty street.
Harry was plenty intimidating, and he would have told Malfoy that but the eponymous Dickson was getting up so it would have to wait. He stood in front of the door again, keeping a close watch on Malfoy.
“Really?” Luna walked into their little circle, sitting on the end of the couch near Pansy, “That seems fun.” She reached into her robe and pulled out a handful of things, butterbeer caps, an acorn, some string, lots of loose hard candy and two chocolate frog boxes. She passed them over to Draco and leaned on the arm of the couch, watching him attentively.
, Potter," Draco said, clinging to his growing annoyance like a lifeline, "And take this back. You don't just give your wand to people." He shoved Potter's wand at him, both relieved and disappointed to be free of it.
“Sorry, sir, I still wanted to have my pen afterwards,” Harry said, “The man accounts for half the department’s quill allowances.”
Malfoy was laughing, but it was… weird, although Harry couldn’t place why. It wasn’t a laugh he had ever heard from Malfoy, and for some reason, it made him uncomfortable.
Harry had to shrug at that, “I think some cities have them and sometimes churches? My aunt was always nervous about ‘the council’. I was just bluffing. Lucky it worked out, really.”
“We don’t see one another in public much, I’m sure this will be a rare treat for the little parasites,” Draco said, his tone flat as he absently flicked the end of the cigarette with his thumb.
He wasn’t. Harry knew he wasn’t. There was just no possible way Malfoy was some sort of not-obliviator and Harry hadn’t seen him at the Ministry before. Or heard a rumour about him.
“Perhaps,” Malfoy said with a smirky grin, “Now. We have a few things to get done before the end of the day.”
“I was there, so yes, I remember,” Draco said, “In fact, I distinctly remember you being utterly miserable. And It looks like you’re halfway there already.”
“It is. You’ll see,” Harry said. He found a wool ball for pulling static out of the clothes, and a bottle of lavender. He put a few drops of the oil onto the ball before starting the machine.
Draco glanced up at Harry, “Hold the owl, I need to respond to this.” he said before hurrying upstairs.
“Better than nothing,” Malfoy muttered under his breath. Looking around, Malfoy pointed out a narrow alley behind two rows of houses, “We can apparate from there.”
Draco turned, and Harry could just make out a green and white sprig of… something floating over his head.
Pansy twisted in her seat, “Draco says that whenever he opens a chocolate frog, he always gets Potter cards."
Malfoy didn’t waver, “A gas leak. The gentleman who came to your shop had a bad reaction and lashed out at you-”

said. She tilted her head thoughtfully, “That was wonderful all on its own. I wasn’t expecting the rest, at all, and it was even more wonderful.”
“Welco-” the woman behind the register started to say and then stopped abruptly and blinked at the small figure in the duck onesie stomped inside.
The night fell into a blur of talking and champagne and dancing, grinding glass to sand in its repetition. Harry found himself scanning the edge of the room whenever he had the chance, looking for Draco’s bright hair and robes of silver and cream. Unlike Harry, always surrounded by people plying for his time, Draco spoke to only one or two people, his back stiff and his expressions careful. He was always so careful.
Yes, it was definitely mad. But what was madder? Exposing himself to the world, or losing Harry forever?
Draco snorted at the thought. Maybe dragging themselves through the mud would prove worthwhile for the Parkinsons, but there was no redemption for the Malfoys. They may have narrowly avoided life sentences in Azkaban, but imprisonment awaited Draco nonetheless.
“It might as well be you,” Draco lowered the stick, stepping on Leon as he closed the distance between them and grabbed the front of Harry’s robes.
The answer left Draco feeling cold and inexplicably sad. He should have known better than to hope. “No,” he said, his voice sounding flat and
Draco looked over Potter’s shoulder, Weasley was holding a hand over his eyes, while Granger covered her mouth with both of hers, her eyes wide; and he burst out laughing.
Malfoy grinned, half in delight and half in disbelief, “Bluffing. That’s- astonishing. Brilliant even.”
"I know that quite well," Draco said faintly. He walked over to the door, untangling Potter’s hasty locking
“Got most of it wrapped up,” Shunter said looking over her shoulder at the shop, “Damage repaired, statements taken, suspect secured, all that’s left is waiting for the memory boys.”
Shunter nodded with a tired grin, “I like a quick auror, Potter. It’s no wonder they ranked you so fast.”
Asbestos narrowed her eyes, “Wizards only care about elves when they can use them. Otherwise filthy stupid creatures, annoying creatures, always in the way. That being why you’ve never thought of it before.”
“That isn’t the point? I was expecting gelato. Now I am inherently disappointed by the experience,” Malfoy said.
“I’m washing the sheets and pillowcases. I hung up your robes,” Harry said as Draco peered into the utility room, “Is that alright?”
The pen cap went loose in Harry’s mouth, almost falling to the ground before he managed to clumsily catch it out of the air.
The desk auror opened drawer after drawer until finally pulling out a bedraggeled looking quill, “Got ya!”
It was a moment time he had seen before but this time Harry didn’t draw his wand. He only offered his open hands, palms outstretched. Alone in that room, Draco cried into Harry’s shoulder. He let himself mourn for the future he had once dreamed of and the past he had ruined and the weight of both in his chest.
They slowed as they reached the edges of the bonfire, still being built up, crackling and popping from the damp caught in the wood. All around people were chatting, people from Hogsmeade but also from Diagon Alley. Just about everywhere there were familiar faces, including a large number of ghosts, far from their hauntings and of exceptionally good cheer.
Before Harry could reply, Malfoy dropped his sunglasses back on his nose and took off, speeding down the street with little regard for the posted speed limits.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Fine. Addendum to point two, I don’t care which costume you think I should wear because see point three.”
Harry swallowed hard as a hundred little things all seemed to connect into one very big nerve-wracking thing, a maybe liking Draco thing.
Harry drew his wand and tried accioing Malfoy’s wand, then accioed for knives, guns and, when absolutely nothing happened, tried weapons in general. There was a rattle as a baseball bat flew out from behind the counter. Malfoy just manged to duck as it sailed over where his head had been, and Harry grabbed it out of the air.
Harry turned to his charges, the juniors straightening up even further so they were in real danger of italicising themselves. The suspect was wobbling slightly, still off-kilter from the effects of a stunning spell administered when he wouldn’t stop trying to bite the arresting auror, that being Harry, who rather wished he wasn’t at the time.
“Sir! Uh, should we re-join you at the scene after we’ve- we’ve delivered him?” The brown-haired Junior asked. Harry thought her name might have started with K… but he wasn’t willing to risk a guess. He had no idea about the other one. Harry would just keep avoiding calling them anything until he heard someone use their names. It had worked so far with most of his other fellow aurors, in that he found he hadn’t really ever needed to use their names enough to learn them.
, Harry drew his wand. The growling raised an octave at the sight of his wand which the small, terrified deranged animal recognised as being vaguely connected to its current situation. Harry took a deep breath and then cast Immobulus, a mild body freezing charm as he reached for the dog with his other hand, hoping to grab it just as the spell hit. Unfortunately, just before that moment, the dog lunged forward, snapping its tiny sharp teeth into the meat of Harry’s hand,
Harry ran his hand through his hair with a sigh. He pointed to a bed strewn with horrid jumpers and chudley cannon kit, “There.”
Harry jumped, beer spilling over on the table. He turned in his seat towards Draco, managing a weak, “No.”
There was a rustle from the brush behind them, and as Harry turned to look, listening for the click of a camera lens, the scratch of a pen on paper but all he saw was a fox running out from under the perfectly trimmed hedges and disappearing into the night.
“I swear if Brewster stole my quill again,” The desk auror muttered, “You do a nice thing, lend ‘em out for the signing, and they just walk away with ‘em. Do I look like I’m made of quills?”
“A bit. But um...After I broke it off with Ginny, she stayed in the flat, and I moved back into Grimmauld Place.” Harry said. “Sirius left it to me, but it’s old and creepy as hell.”
“Sod them, they don’t know what it was like, they weren’t there!” Potter let out a heavy huff of frustration, “Is that it then? You want me to stop- Stop telling people to leave off? Stop telling people not to be arseholes?! I’m not trying to save anyone- I just- I want things to be fair!”
really paying attention, so I don't think I can manage myself. You'll have to show me again tomorrow?”
Harry took a deep breath and looked around, taking down and looking at a firefighter costume, a police bobby costume, lingered for a long time on a cowboy costume with a plastic sheriffs badge, but ended up putting them all back in the trunk. Then he found the dragon costume, with printed scales on thin green cloth and small floppy wings and tail and grinned.
Harry looked around for the Senior Auror and found Shunter standing in front of the nicer house behind him. Her hands were on her hips, and she was frowning severely, an expression that on both her and Professor McGonagall was always pants-wettingly terrifying. The rail-thin old man she was glaring at seemed unaffected, Harry had to assume he was either exceptionally brave or exceptionally stupid.
“Right you are, and I Auror Henry Smith, accept the suspect into the custody of the Ministry cells until such time as his trial or bail,” Smith said, signing the form with an well practised extravagant flourish.
“You should take care regardless. I am afraid you will find most veela will attack to defend zemselves first and ask questions later,” Margery said politely. She
Robard’s gave yelling a good go, but Harry was so distracted he didn’t catch a word of it. He was probably on probationary patrols or would have to do weekend training classes, Harry didn’t care.
“Yeah, he is,”Harry said awkwardly and managed to wait until McGonagall was out of sight before he collapsed onto the couch in utter embarrassment.
“Yeah, right,” Mr Dickson said sourly, and waved for Malfoy to go away, “…I’m just gonna close up for the day. If that’s all.”
“I’m not unhinged,” Harry said, offended. Malfoy was the weird one here with his ridiculous suit and car and not even knowing what a case was.
Malfoy’s stood straighter, his shoulders rising with his chin. If Harry didn’t know what a prat Malfoy was, he might have found him imposing, but only a bit.
Shunter hid a laugh with a hurried cough, but her amusement quickly faded. “It’s out of my control.”
careful, it broke Harry’s heart. He had to kiss him again, brushing their lips together so lightly, almost afraid to breathe.
There was a wide squat railing made of white stone running around the front of the house, and sitting on top of it was Draco. The lamplight caught on his hair like lingering shards of starlight and traced the contours of his face. He had a cigarette held delicately between his fingers and as Harry watched, breathed out a thin stream of coiling white smoke into the night sky.
“I don’t need a bloody ambulance!” Mr Dickson said, smacking his hand against the counter. He narrowed his eyes, “You got identification?”
I'm sorry if there are more typos than usual, my spacebar has decided to only work sometimes and I'm tired from fighting the beast. Hopefully, it just needs to be cleaned.
Harry took out his wand, tongue sticking out in concentration as he made the costume have slightly nicer fabric, stiff wings and full tail but didn’t change much else. It still looked tacky and horrid and knowing Harry, that was entirely the point.
Shunter took a deep breath, calming down marginally as she pulled out her notebook. “It was a minor use of magic and your first offence, so you’ll likely be let off with a fine and warning, but you will have to testify to the Wizengamont. You’ll be owled the date of the meeting once all the paperwork is filed, failure to show may result in a more severe penalty. Do you understand?”
Malfoy’s laughter was starting to escape in gasps as he clutched his stomach, his face slowly turning bright red.
“Auror Potter. Of course,” Draco Malfoy said with a sigh of exasperation, “I should have expected you. I have that sort of luck after all.”
Ron had already left by the time he got back to his desk. Harry collected his jacket only to be stopped by a short blond witch with freckles across her nose.
“You heard me,” Remus said, “I know you’re his godfather, but I don’t think you should ever allow Harry to go to those muggles. They hated James and Lily for being magic, what do you think they would do to their child?”
you.” She finished off the second truffle with a happy sigh, “I'll find some sort of work after school, I don’t intend
Mr Dickson’s glare narrowed into a squint, “I’ve heard of you government types, you won’t trick me. He was probably barmy, escaped from one of your special hospitals,” he tapped the side of his head, “Tryin’ to cover it up, aren’t you, tryin’ to pretend it didn’t happen.”
Harry gently blew on the top of the dark liquid and tried a sip that burned his lip. He cursed under his breath and set the mug back on the counter. The shower was still running faintly overhead.
"What?" Pansy struggled up to a sitting position, "Potter's helping you? I offered to help and you told me to piss off."
All around the edge of the firelight people began conjuring small tables or benches or setting cloths on the ground to lay out the food they had brought. Draco stepped out of the way and conjured a table as well, opening the small basket on his arm and taking out an array of cakes and savoury hand pies small enough to eat in two bites.
Malfoy sighed, his smiled fading. He turned away, pulling his sunglasses out of his breast pocket and opening them with the flick of his wrist. “You really are quite boring,” he said as he put them on.

Draco could almost forget Potter there when he was brewing until he reached for an ingredient only to find Potter already holding it out. Potter filled
, Mr Hickenbottom, it is the council’s duty to enforce the laws, and those include the Animal Welfare Reform Act. So I am here to tell you, if you continue to let your dog out unleashed and unwatched, we will report you to the Dog Wardens for animal negligence and have the dog removed from your custody and adopted out to someone who will care for her properly.”
table, “What is this?”  He asked, picking up one of the jars, lifting it to the light and squinting at the tightly packed jar of green... something.
Harry and Draco looked at each other, eyes meeting over Teddy’s head and smiled, both turning as the door opened and holding out their bags and saying, “Trick or Treat!”
Harry wasn’t sure how much time passed before he eased himself out of bed, walking silently to the door and slipping out into the hallway. He found a bathroom down the hall and helped himself to the shower, letting the hot water pour over his head. He washed the smell of stale smoke and champagne off his skin and hair, replacing them with Malfoy’s shampoo and body wash, eucalyptus and birch. It reminded Harry a bit of his own shampoo but sweeter.
George clutched Princess tighter to his chest, and she gave little whine of concern, “Nobody would be so cruel!”
Harry glared at him, but Malfoy was unmoved. Harry took his wand out and went to the counter, leaning over and aiming at the unconscious shopkeeper laying on the grimy carpet, “
Remus summoned Sirius’ comb and started working out the snarls, casting cleaning spells on clumps of dried tomato sauce and pudding.
Harry swung his legs over the edge of the bed as Draco summoned his shoes and tried to pull them on without losing his balance. He caught Draco’s wrist before he could cast again and pull him close, stealing a kiss, “Deep breaths. It will be alright.”
Thank you SO SO much for reading! This has been the longest and trickiest story I've ever written and I'm both happy and sad to finally see it finished. I hope you enjoyed it and ♡Thank You♡ again!!!!
There was a tap-tap-tap at the window of an owl, a letter tied to its leg. Draco hurried over to retrieve it, opening it before the owl even had a chance to look annoyed.
“Are you satisfied?” Malfoy asked as he stood and once again straightened his suit, looking annoyed even though Harry was certain Malfoy was the type to have had it absolutely covered it in charms so it never stained or wrinkled.
Malfoy turned around so suddenly Harry nearly ran into him. Malfoy leaned close, “First you’d have to convince them you work for the government, not for a costume shop that ran out of police uniforms in your size,” he flicked the brim of Harry’s cap which slid back off his forehead.
“Yeah,” Harry said. He set the half-empty champagne bottle on the ground and held out his hand, “Side-along me?”
“You probably know more about me than anyone other than my mother, after being in school together and that stupid book I wrote,” Draco said.
Margery pursed her lips for a moment, “I do not know. You ‘ave to understand…our early 'istory is made of stories passed down from mother to daughter, it is patchy, vague... what I know is veela do not ‘ave a lot of boys, it is not useful. Veela are territorial, too many males mean
meal appeared on platters all along the tables and the food looked remarkably simialr to what had been served for lunch upstairs.
“Speculate all you like, I won’t tell anyone, and you can rest assured no one would believe me if I did,” Malfoy said.
Harry took a few swallows from the bottle, glad for the burn of bubbles and alcohol, like the sear of it could burn away his unease and discomfort.
“Yeah...She was hit by a curse and..." Harry shook his head, "What happened to your owl? I remember you said something happened to it.”
Harry shook his head, “I wasn’t in the betting pool. I kind of ruined it. She- the witch running it is giving the money back.”
“Yeah, I don’t think the suspect thought that far ahead,” Harry said and then cleared his throat, “That’s just speculation. Off the record speculation.”
Harry frowned to himself, looking at the Juniors desperately waving their wands at the tree with no success, their spells bouncing off the branches and sputtering into sparks. “...Even though they want me to be the next Head Auror?”
then, from the war. Deatheaters, their families. The Manor, though I don't have to worry about that anymore,” Draco said
“Yeah… " Ron nodded thoughtfully, "her scarf’s been getting a bit natty, I could get her some nice yarn, really soft in that weird pinky-purple colour she likes.”
,” Mr Hickenbotham inflated his thin chest, all his self-righteousness returning in one fell swoop, “So
“In my experience," McGonagall said picking her words with care, "people tend to be… quite a bit crueller and stupider when they are in
Harry's new cot was covered with spells that made it as soft and comfortable as sleeping on a cloud, but it was still a narrow little cot.
Draco's doing some sad drinking after a breakup and Harry Potter shows up and he's flirting and asking Draco out and taking Draco home with him.
The first night Harry was in the tower, Draco awoke with a start from a loud thump from downstairs, followed a string of muttered curses as Potter got up off the floor and back onto the cot, and Draco laughed himself back to sleep.
McGonagall’s brow furrowed as she looked over the plaster cast of the wolf prints on the desk in her office. She pursed her
“A coincidence!” Pansy said, biting the chocolate frog in half and leaning forward slightly as Draco opened the second box.
Shunter rolled her eyes, “A laugh a minute, Potter. But this sort of work is just part of the routine.”
They landed in a small front garden in a quiet rather nondescript neighbourhood. The house they were standing in front of had a near twin built right beside it with an identical if slightly more yellow lawn. In fact, the two gardens were like a storybook illustration of the grass always being greener on the other side, with perfect green grass and flowers in full bloom on one side, as the other garden, looked well, ordinary and a bit sad in comparison. It was easy to guess which house had magic to help things along.
Harry grabbed a skeleton and a bat costume which were just designs printed onto baggy black onesies and held them up to Draco.
Draco tried to smile in what he wanted to be a winning manner but came out rather wobbly, “I’ve… been watching you as well.”
“I understand the nature of your complaint,” Shunter said with the sort of firmness that was meant to try and continue the conversation, but with the sort of weariness that came from having failed to continue the conversation many times before, “but, Mr Hickenbottom-”
Harry was sure she would make an amazing Head Auror when Robards retired. He couldn’t think of anyone better suited for it.
He pressed his palm over the clenching twisting pain in his chest. This wasn’t a good time for this, he had hardly- he
Harry collected his clothes, one piece at a time as he headed back to the bedroom. They were stale and sour-smelling from yesterday’s sweat and smoke. A cleaning charm would get rid of the dirt and lint but was useless when it came to embedded smells and sweat. He stood in the middle of the bedroom, trying to decide what to do. His boxers and undershirt were relatively clean, seeing as he had only worn them for a few hours the night, so he pulled them back on. He left the rest of his clothes in a pile and decided to look around. He could make some coffee for them, or tea, whichever Draco had.
A story of mistletoe, and workplace pranks that may be a little cruel which sometimes require a stick to even the odds
Harry left first, returning to the ballroom with its loud music and glittering lights. Bright, sparkling robes swirled around the dance floor as the band played. Harry grabbed a flute of champagne off a floating tray and emptied half the bubbling liquid without tasting it. A flashing smile of recognition from across the room sent someone hurrying over to him, and Harry forced a genial smile he didn’t feel in the slightest and went to meet them.
Harry grinned as Draco tried to pull the plant out of the tangle of his hair, “So… can I take out out to dinner?”
