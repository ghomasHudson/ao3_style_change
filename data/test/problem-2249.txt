"I'm going to go lie down," Malfoy said in a tiny voice. He turned away from Harry, and Harry let him walk away, wondering what he was supposed to do now, since he absolutely wasn't gay, except that he'd just come in Malfoy's mouth.
“Yeah?” Harry asked, taking Draco’s hand.
Malfoy reached into his own hair and pulled out the cord that kept it neatly pulled back. Harry groaned in lust. He put first his left, then his right hand as well, into Malfoy's pretty hair.
Harry stood, so Draco did as well. Harry gestured toward the door, and so Draco followed him toward it.
“Whatever Granger thinks best,” Draco decided.
“Her invitation to visit Landers remains,” Draco said, leaning back into Harry’s wet embrace. His shoulder was a sturdy and comfortable shelf for the back of Draco’s head. His hand rested gentle and stable on Draco’s thigh. “I checked with Landers myself.”
Feeling like his skin was on fire, like his organs were on ice, like his heart was winning a race with the Hogwarts Express, Draco sat in silence, watching Mother make lace.
“Remember how you couldn’t let me decide on our sex life for the both of us, it had to be mutual?”
Harry found himself unable to concentrate on kissing, and he dropped his head to Malfoy's shoulder and pulled Malfoy's hips toward his own. He was hard. Hell, they were both hard, and it was erotic and dirty and nothing like he'd ever thought he would want. But he did. Oh, how he did. He couldn't understand how someone he'd always hated could become someone he desperately wanted. But he could figure that out later. Right now, he wanted, and Malfoy wanted, and they would have it - whatever it was.
Harry’s speech was hardly slurred. “I can’t exactly relax when you have a huge problem with who I am!” He pointed at Draco’s face. “You’re homophobic!”
Harry felt his stomach swoop, but he tried to ignore it.
Harry obeyed.

"I believe I know the ring you speak of," the Merchieftainess said. "But if I am right, then I have… frustrating news. I am Merchieftainess Murcus, and have been for nearly thirty-five years. Twenty or so years ago, a child of my village brought me a ring he'd found while out gathering pretty rocks with his brothers and sisters. It was silver, with a fancy stone that shone like the moon. Engraved inside it said…" she paused and looked up to think. "It had your letters, ess ess, then a letter I did not recognize, perhaps a short tee. After that the letters ell and ee. Does that sound like the ring you seek?"

“Then please, go fuck your way through my harem, enjoy the whore I’ve had tucked into your bed, and leave Potter here with me to enjoy his reward. I will see you at breakfast tomorrow, and I expect you to have a very large smile on your face.”
“How is this good news?” Narcissa demanded, ice permeating every syllable.
"I don't know French," Malfoy said, looking confused.
“Is it?” Draco asked, and strode out,
“Second of all, you’re probably the most tenacious bastard I’ve ever met. Who the hell takes every blow you took, every setback, and comes out ahead anyway, the way you keep doing?”
This Dudders was able to accomplish with a finger snap, and Harry looked closely at his work. "I like it," he said authoritatively. "Now I want all the extra studs gone, just smooth leather left behind. Very plain."
“I sincerely hope so!” Harry said, laughing warmly.
"Hers," Draco almost whispered, and tipped his head toward Parkinson, whom Harry had damn near forgotten in his glee at humiliating Draco Malfoy.
“Why does everyone insist that I’ve fucked half of London?” Potter wailed, looking at the ceiling. “Draco,” he paused and took a large, visible breath. Then he looked Draco right in the eyes, no tease or snark anywhere on his face. “I was a virgin until last night. In the bath. With you.”

sleep at all. Draco’s version, should it ever work, prevented only nightmares, and encouraged the patient through all the stages of normal sleep.
“Of course, ma’am,” Draco agreed.
"Really? I totally thought you knew French," Harry said, and drank more Rosé. He was starting to lose his filters. Normally he would never have suggested that he thought (knew) Malfoy was posher than him.
So, cursing his weakness, Harry threw a random recording of Draco into his Pensieve and went in after it; prepared to simply masturbate, come, fall asleep.
Harry nodded. “I miss Butch.”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_in_London “In 1998, the Pride Trust became insolvent and no event was organised that year although an organisation called 'Pride Events UK' took money for tickets for one.”
Harry looked relieved. “Good. I totally had this plan, then you were naked and warm in my arms, and….”
Harry smiled, and it was as though the room warmed by several degrees. Draco felt a knot he hadn’t even been aware of loosen in between his shoulders, and he smiled shyly in return. Then, flustered, he jumped up from his couch, nearly sat down again, stumbled slightly, and then rushed into the kitchen. “Sit! You should have a seat! Can I get you something to drink?”
The view took his breath away.
The elder hesitated for the first time. "Mr. Potter," she hedged.
. Not too much. You are…” he paused and inhaled enough to expand his ribcage. “You
“Mother!” Draco said, alarmed to hear her awake. He rushed to kneel by her chair.
Harry thought about this for a moment. He'd told the Wizengamot elder he wanted his slaves to attend to his arsehole, but he hadn't actually done anything about it.
“Tell me more about that,” Harry said, leaning forward a bit.
Harry was able to step directly into a third kind. They went right through. Draco stiffened in discomfort the first time he saw it, but Harry didn’t seem to notice the gold piercing his shoulder. Then he stepped again, and both the golden light, and Harry, seemed unaffected.
Malfoy sounded slightly unsure. "I… there are a few things it might be. I'm not willing to do this alone. I want help."
He could say “of course I know, darling.”
Harry’s eyes visibly darkened.
Follow-on jaunts into the unfamiliar Muggle world were less… ideal. Now, Draco might have already learned the least expensive way to exchange galleons for pounds. (Whichever goblin looked least grumpy that morning, or — better still — find an elderly goblin training a younger one. Goblins never spoke out loud at a teller window about cheating a customer.) He might have learned how to navigate Aldi and a dry cleaner’s shop. He might have even spent a few weeks carefully determining that Aldi had better deals than Asda and Lidl. Draco had even learned the wonders of his local Muggle library. Librarians were

Walking slowly, his robes fastened cautiously up to the neck over his shirt and trousers, Draco made his way through the now quiet building, headed for the closest Floo. Despite his occasionally churlish thoughts, he really was grateful for this job.
“Harry!” Aunt Andromeda said, sounding surprised. “This is hardly what I expected!”
“I thought you preferred me to enter,” purred Harry from directly behind Draco’s right ear.
“No,” he said, and caressed Harry’s cheek. “You know what? No! I’m not. I love you, Harry Potter. You make me incredibly happy, and I love you.”

"Very well then," McGonagall said with approval. "Come with me and I shall show you the supplies the faculty has helped me put together for you."

Draco frowned at his empty glass. “Has Granger spoken directly to my house-elves? Or their Healer?”
“Draco,” Harry was looking at his own damn feet again. “I’m not interested in that kind of sex. Penetrative sex. I’ve looked into it and it doesn’t really… appeal to me.”
Your arse is tight and hot.

"Basically, Draco, bondage is about pretending to relinquish control. The man in restraints wouldn't actually be giving away any real power, assuming we have trust, and I trust you. If you tie me up, it gives you the opportunity to do it all completely at your own pace. To know, with certainty, that I won't push you too hard or too fast.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Harry cast a couple of cleansing charms, leaned over Draco, stared into his blissed face for a long second, then — clearly pleased with what he saw — waggled his eyebrows ridiculously.
"Wow," one of his slaves said quietly, and Harry just lay limply in Hole's arms, feeling them both stroke him gently. The gems chimed their way into Hole's hourglass and Harry opened an eye. Five gems he had promised for an orgasm, and five gems had found their happy way into the bottom of Hole's hourglass. But being rimmed, might just, as it turned out, be the best way to come in the entire universe. "Eight gems for licking my arsehole until I come," Harry said weakly, and the gems obeyed his command.
Draco snorts now to remember his reaction - and Severus' reaction to that.
Dumbledore did not seem to appreciate Malfoy's outburst, but he did not chastise him. "Mr. Malfoy. Draco. Surely you are aware of Harry's… relationship with Voldemort?"
"This should not be a surprise," Severus had mused. Then he stood up and began to move around the room. "I should really have seen this coming. And I don't begrudge you this, Draco, certainly not. He's not the oddest choice at all," Severus had snarked before Draco could respond. Draco wondered if Severus had guessed correctly. He had.
“Then why do you talk in your sleep about wanting me?” Harry demanded. He could hardly remember anymore that this was, in all honesty, a lie. The way Draco’s mum had reinforced it had affected Harry’s perception.
Draco merely nodded.
“Hm,” Harry said, drawing the conversation out, very much on purpose. “That idea has merit.”
pregnant. Also, she shows all signs of having a normal menstrual cycle. I assume you don't want her bleeding all over your house for two or three days every month?"
“You mean, a boy? A half-blood?”
“I’m going to miss the sex, too,” Draco said, looking down at their feet. “But we both have to get over this. Being at school together is making everything worse, not better.”
"Oh yeah," Harry said. "That twist, do that twist again. Please."
“But, to my knowledge, Draco has yet to apologize to Ronald Weasley or Miss Katie Bell. And I think he really ought, if he and Harry are to have any chance at happiness.”
“And I felt, I don’t know exactly how to describe it. I felt a falseness in the house. In the wards.”
Harry felt warm oil spilling onto his back. He felt strong hands spreading it, pressing it into his skin, his tense shoulders and strained lower back. Then he felt the oil warming, heating, intensifying. For a moment he worried it would heat to an uncomfortable temperature, but it stopped just before, the heat sinking deeply into his tense muscles and relaxing him.
hard to call the other boy Draco. But he reckoned he could, if he had a good reason. This seemed like a really good reason.
"I told you Malfoy… virgin." Harry blushed a deep red.
Harry leaned over and spoke quietly into Draco’s ear. “How’re you holding up?” They waited alone in Neville’s office, but the door was open and either Auror could return at any time. Presumably should have returned already.
“It’s late,” Harry said. “Pince will kick us out in ten minutes. Less. We’ve no time to ‘chat’.”
“While the two of us stayed behind to talk….”
"Harry, there is something we need to discuss. I know your worries about Draco Malfoy. I know you've been trying to find out what he is up to and I know you have been trying to warn your friends, and me, that he's dangerous."
“Not tired anymore?” Draco traced a vein on the back of Harry’s hand.
, Cissy? The boy is five weeks old and can't even stand without assistance. How could he need shoes?"
"Cunt or arse, you mean?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Even as they laughed, Draco marveled at how right it felt between them. Wasn’t that a surprise?
They barely remembered to have Harry cast
“I disgust you, but you just shoved my cock in your arse,” Draco said, gripping Harry’s hips and smiling like a shark.

Any request: a touch, a position, a kiss; was granted.
"That good, huh?" Draco said, grimacing, as he finally settled himself all the way down onto Harry's pelvis.
Now Harry felt awful. How did he fix this? "Hey," he tried. "That was fucking brilliant, Malfoy. My first blow job. I loved it." He put a hand on Malfoy's face, amazed at the heat of it. Impulsively, he leaned forward just enough to press a small kiss to the corner of Malfoy's mouth. He blushed at the wanting that arose suddenly in his gut.
He heard a noise at the doorway, and —expecting Kreacher— he turned toward it and smiled.
Vissy’s eyes begged forgiveness.
Soon both slaves were not only nude, their genitals were completely hairless. Amused, Harry had his elves depilate both slaves everywhere else as well, until they both had no hair around their arseholes, on their legs, around their nipples, or on their faces. Pleased, Harry pulled both his slaves close, in what might have looked like a hug. He stroked their backs and arses firmly, enjoying their silken skin.
Harry gave Draco a huge grin and kissed him yet again. "This is the best Christmas present… ever."
"No!"
It was only when Voldemort moved into his home that Draco was grateful to be an only child, if this was how his parents treated their

“No, er, I mean… yeah…” Harry said and he looked shifty, but Draco allowed him to wipe a gentle finger across Draco’s lip.
So on Sunday after dinner, when Potter stared at him all the way through the meal and eventually motioned for Draco not to leave when his friends did, Draco stayed right where he was only because he was looking forward to insulting Potter to his face.

He didn’t wank. He didn’t need to.

"Er," Harry faltered. What had seemed so obvious when he was having sex suddenly seemed embarrassing and wrong. And yet… it wasn't exactly an avenue he wanted to cut off forever. "Sure. What bloke doesn't enjoy fucking a nice tight hole, right?" He grimaced. That was asinine, and now Malfoy would know he was a real queer; not just willing to accept blow jobs from willing boys. Malfoy didn't smirk at him though. Instead he looked a bit downcast.
The Merchieftainess turned her narrowing eyes from Malfoy to Harry.
Harry pressed forward, and their noses met with a touch of force.
“I am? But this is too perfect. You
Harry blushed bright red at this, but he agreed. "Sounds good," he said, wondering if Draco was going to suggest something lascivious and half hoping he would.

“You seemed to get along with Aamin. Do you want him to call again?”
“I’m no faggot,” Draco would say, patting Harry’s arse in front of everyone. “I just know how not to bite the hand that feeds me.”
"But what we just did? Fuck, that's the best bit! This whole adventure, really, it's been more good than bad. And the parts I couldn't handle? You were great. We made a good team."
, providing a path back to lost websites and work.
Harry opened his mouth, but Draco shook his head. Harry wasn’t trying to speak, though. Draco quickly realized Harry was just… gobsmacked.
"Think I'm drunk," he said.
, hoping every tiny noise in the corridor was you.”
“No,” Harry said, and Draco allowed him to touch his quivering lip once again. His cock started to harden and his heart pounded harder. It must have been audible. They were completely alone in the Great Hall and Draco decided that was unlikely to last.
He wasn’t hungry, but the muffins looked sweet and fruity and delicious and he rather wanted that blueberry one, despite his earlier toast and egg. Not to mention, they were a gift. From
I wanted.”
The Healer shivered, and Harry cringed. So far he hadn't bothered sharing his slaves around. Truthfully, he hadn't given the idea much thought. And while he loved the idea of fucking lots of pretty girls and boys he met out in Hogsmeade or Diagon, he wasn't quite ready for that yet. There was, after all, the not unimportant matter that - in comparing his dick with porn stars, and Malfoy's, and that ugly yellow dildo Scrivener had brought, he'd learned that his cock wasn't very big. He was thinking surely magic could fix that, but he'd never happened upon a spell that would enlarge his dick, and he was loathe - unsurprisingly with this one - to ask Hermione for help.
"Take it off and put it in the keep pile," he said roughly, and turned to Hole.
The problem? Inside, Draco was positively fizzing with nerves.
, Harry looked away, then looked flirtatiously through his lashes, both hands threading through his hair.
"Not right now," Harry said. "Thanks, though." And he stared at the countryside speeding by, mulling over everything they had both said.

Draco fought an urge to check the time. “Do you need me to come along?”
The morning of the festivities, Draco had arrived extremely early to reserve the best space with his large blanket and his magical picnic basket. He was quite pleased to see he was just early enough to take the space he had chosen, for as he rolled out his large blanket and put his shoes in one corner and the basket in the opposite corner, other picnickers arrived and looked toward his area.
"Sounds marvelous," Harry decided out loud. "Please, go right ahead. I'll be right here, watching."
"Really?" Harry said, astonished. "Have you?"
“We can fuck until you come,” Draco continued, “then you suck my dick while we shower?”
“I have been thinking,” Narcissa began, “about the connection between men like Rosscot, and men like Lucius. I have been considering things I have heard, and questioning their truth.”

“Perhaps, in future, I could watch Teddy?”

is the only one who's done it in decades?" He sounded angry. He was sitting ramrod straight and gripping the wheel tightly. "Maybe the part where Snape still can't believe a pretty Muggle born girl would turn him down, when he was the sort of guy who would turn to the Dark Lord the minute she said 'no'?"
Harry had to strive not to rip his clothing away. Instead, he worked to play it a little cooler.
Harry couldn't stand it anymore. In a strangled voice, he managed "Bloody hell, Malfoy…" and carelessly yanked off his remaining clothes. Malfoy looked a bit disappointed and Harry, now nude, grabbed the other boy around the torso and rubbed their warm chests together.
He sniggered into the window, completely giving away that he was awake, were Malfoy awake to see or hear the noise. But he wasn't ready to talk to Malfoy so he pretended he'd been silent and hoped Malfoy -- who wasn't moving or making noise, so maybe it was true -- was still honestly asleep.

"Fuck yes, Tiger. Much, much better."
"Draaaycoooooo!" the disembodied voice wailed. "Kill it!"
Adjusting to the real Harry was something Draco had never once thought to fantasize about. It was simultaneously heartrendingly amazing, and utterly bizarre. It felt like apparating somewhere new, with no map, where no one spoke any of the languages he knew.
"We'll be doing that again," Harry said happily, and both slaves giggled. Giggled! "I love this reward system," Harry said happily. "I want a nap. Nap with me. If I like having you in my bed, I'll reward you."
, Harry thought, as he finally withdrew his unassailable cockring charm.
There was an angry murmur from McGonagall and then the wraith began screeching again, but Harry motioned to Malfoy and they both snuck down the stairs silently. Harry motioned again, and together they began to walk toward the great hall. Lunch had ended recently enough that they were able to scare up a house elf who happily brought them a few heaping platters of leftovers, and they ate together in an excruciating silence for a few minutes.
“Ma’am?!”
Draco blushed. “I’ve kept you up all night.” He yawned, too.
"No, Harry said, sighing, looking at the mattress, tracing a little circle with his finger and not looking at Malfoy. "Because you're a bloke. I've never thought I might be gay until I fell on you and wanted to come." He felt himself blush even though Malfoy wasn't looking at him.
Now Draco had left it too long, and hurriedly, he unspelled the enchantments that hide his lube and dildo. He opened his legs, slid a lubricated finger into his arse and sank back into his fantasy.
Eventually, they slept.
Despite Malfoy’s character, Harry couldn’t help but feel proud. Malfoy was an arse, but he was an
“I can’t help it,” he finally said, soft and low, “if your arse is incredible. Now why don’t I watch you walk it back into the tent? Sleep for four hours.”
History and Story Information
"I need," Malfoy said, sounding helpless. "Er, you…. Get off?" Then he closed his eyes and made a pathetic whimpering sound of deep embarrassment. He sounded positively agonized, but all Harry could discern from own his state of alcohol-induced stupidity was that he didn't understand what was going on.

“We have a fish wall,” Draco said, still sullen. “Father installed it in his lounge, to entertain him during his… house arrest. It is enormous.”
Only Seamus gave Harry an actual answer. “Saw him Floo out an hour ago, mate. Sorry.”
Harry wrapped his right hand around his own leaking, throbbing need, and then he turned within the nest of Draco's body and leaned his head sideways on Draco's shoulder. "I know you want to watch, but I really want to kiss you. Can I just warn you when I'm about to come?"
“I, yeah,” Draco said, licking his lips, unsure what he’d agreed, except Harry was going to fuck him. Now.
"Yeah?" Draco said sleepily. He should be napping now, Harry realized, so that they could drive night and day nonstop until they got to Lecce again. But perhaps his sleepiness was an advantage. Harry suspected Draco wasn't going to be crazy about this question. "How long have you fancied me?" Harry said quietly.
* * * * * * *
“Indeed,” Draco agreed. “Is it not five, six thousand miles from here? Even apparating all that way would be extreme.” He gave a dry chuckle.
Draco watched Mother unashamedly maneuver Harry toward Draco, and he bit back his frustrated sigh.
Draco looked at his shoes again. “You’re right,” he said.
Anal injury/damage: Negative
“That… sounds really good, Headmistress,” Harry said. He stood. “I appreciate this a lot.”
“I do not know why you are so damn amused,” Draco sniffed, but he knew his little smile would give him away.
“Stay,” Draco insisted.
Harry hesitated.
The spell obviously worked on the Dobby in the memory, but of course had no effect on Harry. Harry instead suffered the disorientation of Dobby rapidly shaking his own head in response to the spell, and then he felt Dobby cower as he reacted to being under his Master's wand.
"Did they not tell you I was coming?" Afelgate said nervously. "The Wizengamot, I mean? It's time for their weekly sexually transmitted disease checkup. I guess the Wizengamot assumed that you'd have a lot of partners. Or perhaps that you would share the slaves with your friends, or something?"
, blood connection be damned. How was he meant to respond to someone foolish enough to believe that? He cautiously rolled her words around in his mind, sipped tea, then looked at her again.

. "Right here in my pocket, see?"
"I can't keep calling you two by your names like this," Harry mused as Pansy knelt in front of him and began tonguing his soft cock. "You need nicknames. I think…" he tipped Pansy's chin and looked into her eyes. "You might do well to answer to 'Mouth.' It reminds me of that day you opened your mouth, trying to send me to Voldemort," - both slaves cringed - "but instead I tricked him into killing himself. With Malfoy's wand."
He’d just been eliminating potential magic-boosting ingredients, and now this? It was a lot to take in.
“You think I’m handsome?”
t-T-t-T-t-T-t-T-t
"Mm," Harry agreed, and shoved the dildo into Malfoy's arse again.
Harry found that while she might just, he could not. Speaking was out of the question. The miserable heat spread to his collarbone and below. Thank Merlin for the high neck on formal robes.
Harry’s cock thickened in his lap.
“So she already knows!” Draco exclaimed at the same moment that Potter cried out –
Draco wanted to swoon, or shriek, but instead he reached out to unfasten the King’s breeches, as demanded.
“The ballet?” Harry said, clearly surprised. “Isn’t that awfully…” he paused.
Harry stood, too, but only came near Draco’s shoulder. He could wait.

“As you are,” Mother said. She looked up at him, straightening her already straight spine. “And I neglected to treat you as such for far too long. I hope that I… I have attempted to correct that error, of late,” she said.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Mother merely nodded. Draco’s relief only surprised him slightly. He hated more explicit descriptions of the incident. Bad enough it had happened, even while neither of them were home.
Harry stared at Draco, his mouth open in a tiny “oh.”
"No."
Potter looks at Draco shrewdly for a long moment, and Draco holds the eye contact calmly, silently. “Assuming you are both, then,” Potter finally continues, “I should explain what I need. I have a very demanding schedule these days. I spend nearly every evening at some sort of event, memorial or ball. I field many requests for dates from the most beautiful and eligible young men and women. Basically, I require an extremely competent cocksucker to keep my testicles drained at all times so I don’t get erections at embarrassing or compromising moments.
And Draco was talking. Something about his son. Scorpius was the same age as Pandora, maybe they would be friends at Hogwarts? Maybe they should get the children together, maybe the adults, too.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Harry caught Teddy’s ball, then stood up and smiled at Andromeda, wanting her to stand, too. “Let’s play catch!”
“Hell yes,” Draco whispered, and nearly fell into Harry’s grasping arms.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Next in line is Justin Finch-Fletchley. His erection is thick and hard, and Draco caresses it with some pleasure. “A fine cock for my Guard,” he says with approval. “I suggest you go find someone to help you enjoy this.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Hush.”
“That what you want?” Harry asked softly, sipping at his Ice Vodka.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

“Bippy! Damn, that fucker really struck a blow,” Draco growled. Bippy appeared and Draco didn’t bother asking after her health. “Bippy, fetch medical attention. For yourselves.”
Then Malfoy was gone, down the stairs in a whirl of robes so dramatic that Harry thought the other boy must practice in front of a mirror.
“Hm,” Potter said. “Instead, you’ve been sentenced to extract my sperm and magically redistribute it to a half dozen women who I’ll be impregnating. Twice a week, no less.” He sounded disgusted again. “I agree, Malfoy, your scenario is a hell of a lot more sexually exciting than what the damn Wizengamot came up with.”
“What charms?”
Dudders was done fixing the outfit, and Harry smiled. "That's more like it," he said to quietly, and Dudders bowed, relief on his face.
“No ‘but’,” Harry said, pulling Draco close. “Not for me. It was just plain good. I loved it. We should do that every damn day.”
“And we can just talk right through at normal volume,” Draco marvelled. “Though I’m in Wiltshire and you’re over three hundred miles north.”
She sighed once and walked to her window. Looking out over the frosted landscape seemed to calm her, and she continued. "As a currently matriculated student, Mr Malfoy understands that since we have returned after the New Year, what had been a challenging situation, has become untenable. The wraith of Snape became… agitated. The wraith itself cannot explain the change, but the reasons why are of course not as important as the existence of this wraith at all."
“Shall we see if Draco is free to join us?” Andi asked, and Harry relaxed.
Which, ironically enough, was Draco..
“Yup,” Harry said. His smile somehow both proud and shy. “I tested it with every method I know. Then, I went through. So did Bippy.”

Pleased that the plan to retrieve the horcrux was so straightforward, Harry thanked the headmaster and went back to Gryffindor tower. He kept his mind firmly away from the idea that he and Malfoy would be alone in Malfoy's bedroom - possibly for an entire night.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"Er, no." Harry said, looking above Malfoy's head. "I've mostly been sucking at my job and going out drinking with the boys after work. I haven't had a girlfriend since I broke up with Ginny Weasley at the end of sixth year."
But how the hell did he point this out to Draco when he couldn’t admit to snooping into Draco’s private diary?
McGonagall looked into Harry's eyes for a moment, frowning. Then she seemed to remember that he was no longer her student. She straightened her back but remained seated. "Yes," she said. "Since you were last here Snape's wraith seems to have lost even more control. Two students -- a first year and a second year -- have been sent to the infirmary already today. One…" she paused and shook her head. "The Slytherin child will probably have to be transferred to St. Mungo's."
"What blow are you trying to soften, boy?" Severus had demanded so gruffly that he'd almost sounded angry. After everything they had been through together, Draco supposed he shouldn't behave so formally with Severus about anything. Not even this. Certainly, Draco knew, Severus would not appreciate any insinuation that he was too poor to afford his vices. The "hero" money he received from the Ministry might be less than what anyone else - save Draco, of course - received monthly, but Draco knew it nonetheless covered all of Severus' expenses. Severus had also assured him that the potions he sold through owl delivery earned him a decent sum every month in addition.
“Pansy,” Draco said, feeling slightly helpless despite his crown, which seemed to have gone somewhat crooked, “I wonder if I could trouble you to go on to breakfast without me.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Neither spoke for a long, heavy moment. But there was only so much spaghetti, and soon they were done eating.
“Sir,” Weasley says sternly, but Draco can see his grin.
“Hm,” Draco said, “Australia? That’s very… far?”
Of course, this meant his brain immediately supplied a million memories of Potter. Naked. Eager. Happy.
“Er,” Harry said, “I’m glad you did. Gave me courage.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Harry would not be capable of a sincere apology at Malfoy’s fucking torture mansion. Not even for almost slicing Malfoy to death. Accidentally! Which at first Harry thought was a mitigating factor, until he decided it made everything far worse.
“Please,” Draco said, calmer.
Harry came copiously down Draco’s throat and Draco came equally all over his belly, coming back to himself in his bed.
“I mean, we all know you and Ron and Hermione, separately and all three of you together, I mean, that’s obvious. Plus Ginny, I know. Dean told me himself.”

Harry looked down and saw that the box, and the cranberry muffin halves inside it, had indeed soaked up rather a lot of coffee. He frowned, and they both stood there for a long moment, saying nothing, staring awkwardly at what was left of the mess. Sighing quietly, Harry waved his wand and the muffins were gone, the box was gone, the empty cups were gone. He waved it again and the dishes were clean, and floating up into their rightful spots in Draco’s cupboards. Draco watched the creamer and sugar bowl replace themselves in his cabinet and wondered how Harry knew where everything belonged. “I have to make it up to you,” Harry declared after the clutter had been eliminated. “Let me take you out to lunch?”
Harry paused, and Kreacher misunderstood. "Sir, Dudders and I have been researching in Master's library, but we haz not yet found—"
"No?" Harry actually seemed slightly confused. "Don't you think it would be best to go slow with physical intimacies?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"No scars," Harry said, suddenly thinking of more than the moment they were in.
Draco was fastening his trousers when he realized. He’d intended to mark Harry. Dominate him. Fuck his mouth.
“As a matter of fact,” Harry said, “why don’t we start the rumour mill going right now? We have a couple days to wait until we can go to Hogsmeade. Might as well give folks something to talk about before. That way, renting a room won’t seem sudden.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Don’t stop,” Draco gritted out, electrified from the tip of one of Harry’s fingers. He knew the sudden bowstring of his neck and back might give the wrong impression. “Whatever you do, Harry, don’t you fucking dare stop. Oh fuck….”
“You were crying,” Harry said, the terrible memory so vivid he could almost smell blood.
Draco tried not to get sentimental about sharing Harry’s kitchen, but they worked well together. Soon they were seated at Harry’s little kitchen nook.
Draco picked the damp rabbit up off the floor, cleaned it briskly with his wand and handed it to Teddy, who immediately shoved it back into his mouth.
Andromeda smiled at Harry but looked at Teddy, still captivated with his levitating ball. He was enjoying a “keep-down” game Harry had taught him.
Draco had swallowed a sip of his whiskey, then another. He looked at Severus and looked away, then he looked back again. He put his glass down on the table near his chair and put his elbows on his knees. Then he sat up and looked Severus in the eye again. He picked his whiskey back up and played with the glass, hardly seeing it at all.
It was a long, potion-heavy regimen, but as Draco performed it for his owner’s pleasure every day the Auror left him home alone, he’d learned to do the entire list without cerebration.
He looked from one to the other. He: the pureblood prince, the childhood rival, the stamping foot, the bloody bathroom.
"Oh," Harry said slowly. "They didn't mention you by name, or tell me they'd set up the appointment, but now that you mention it, yeah, I remember. There's something in the contract about this." He frowned at Afelgate again. "I was hoping for someone a little more…."
"Oh," Harry said.
"Because I figured you wouldn't want my

.” He turned to discern her expression. She had abandoned the pretense of calm. He watched her smoothing circles into her temples. He grimaced. He hated upsetting his mother.

"That, er, that won't be a hardship, Sir," Afelgate said, "but if you wouldn't mind, I'd particularly appreciate the chance to do both examinations in the entire, first?"
“Need,” Draco panted, “cockring charm.”
“That won’t help!” Harry cried, and Draco laughed again, happy.
Gonorrhea: Negative
"Can you empty my bladder for me? My erection is kind of getting in the way, and I don't really feel like getting out of bed right now."
Harry was honestly impressed with her acting skills, but they just… waited.
"I figured McGonagall would have that part taken care of," Harry said, not feeling sure of this at all.
“Unh,” Draco whined.
“Great!” Hermione gushed.
Harry helped Draco decide what to eat, and he ordered for Draco when the waiter came. Despite the cafe’s name, Draco was able to order a small chicken parmigiana, which turned out to be quite nice, despite being one of the cheapest things available. He got a salad as well. It turned out to be enormous, so he shared it with Harry.
“No, pull himself up to stand. He can do it when he has something to hold onto,” Aunt Andromeda explained. “He’s been waving for weeks now.”
Draco blanched. Harry was the last person he needed right now: a boy both volatile and deeply biased. But expressing those concerns would not help.
might do to ‘loosen a sleeper’s tongue,’ however honest the spell might force a sleeper to be; Harry had no choice but to believe that Draco’s actions spoke far, far louder than his words. Especially when those words were spoken only under a spell, while asleep.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"Please Malfoy, please lie down with me? I want to touch you so bad, I'm so hard it hurts." Harry tugged gently at Malfoy's hand and Malfoy stepped forward. The two boys tumbled onto Malfoy's bed and spent a few glorious minutes just kissing and frotting, reveling in their mutual nakedness and lust. Malfoy seemed enthusiastically content, but soon Harry wanted more.
“Has he slept enough?” she asked, nearly silent. Harry bent closer to better hear. He paused, then nodded.

“That had to have been extremely difficult for you,” she said. “But your presence was immeasurably valuable to this case.” She took Narcissa’s hands into her own, and Draco watched, surprised, as his mother allowed it. Took visible comfort in it.
“Oh,” Draco said.
"Suck my dick, Hole," Harry said, unable to wait any longer, and Hole obeyed him slowly enough that Harry smacked him one across the ear.
“You’re welcome to stay for dinner, but you should head for Hogwarts if you want to see Draco before he’s gone.”
"Offer to skin his worthless hide!" yelled the disembodied voice. "Offer to kick him in the head!" the voice continued, and then began to laugh: an eerie, thin sound that sounded increasingly like a scream of pain. Things began to fall from the highest shelves. One of them shattered.
“Mm,” Harry said, smiling. He leaned forward slightly. “I like your ideas. I also liked cooking for you. I would enjoy doing that again. I like hiking around my land when the weather cooperates. I’d love to explore with you. Watch you fly, too. Always used to love that.”
“Certainly,” Draco said. But he shivered eagerly at the thought of Harry’s fingers in him.
Harry gestured to her to sit, and between bites the boys caught her up on what had happened in the Lake.
Now the only man left for Draco to inspect is Harry Potter.
“If we’re stuck here for at least two days, we should explore multiple pleasant ways to pass the time. As you can see, I’ve thought of several already.”

“It was,” she agreed, “but I fear I left my favourite biscuit platter behind. I need you to fetch it for me.”
By the authority granted us by the citizens of wizarding England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, we the Wizengamot hereby unanimously grant to Harry Potter the service, body and life of one convicted criminal:

He'd been thinking about this almost nonstop since his first night home with two sex slaves. He felt clear that "permanent marks of slavery / sexual servitude" needed to be attractive, representative and creative. And while it should reference Harry's reasons for having two slaves in the first place, it must not overtly reference Voldemort himself. No lightning bolts or snakes. No yew or Master wands. He'd finally woken from a dead sleep the night before with an image pressed against his mind's eye. He'd quickly scribbled the basics of it onto a scrap of parchment and after breakfast called on the tattooist the Elder had raved about.
Yeast Infection: Negative
And then they went to the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham Palace, watching the changing of the Guard before they went in and took their tour. As a wizard, Draco had never thought much about the Muggle Royal family, but this turned out to have been an oversight. The opulence! The art! The fame, attention, wealth! So much wealth. Draco was giddy and unable to hide it, despite being able to see that Harry thought he was being
The wedge of pillow under his arse might as well have had springs in, too. He claimed to want Harry to do all the work, but his dick hammered Harry’s wet hole. Harry was going to explode all over Draco’s tight abs far sooner than he’d expected. Or wanted.
"When we do the female slave's tattoo, does it matter where I stick my cock?"
Harry stood, but Draco still saw the shiver he’d put down Harry’s spine.
“That is correct, my Lord.”
"Potter, is that you?" Malfoy was sitting sideways at a desk looking out the window, wearing a rich-looking cream dressing gown over soft pyjamas. Harry was looking at his profile. The room was shadowy, but the moon was full.
“I almost believe you,” he said, then wondered if that had been a good idea. Potter looked very surprised.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Maybe?” she looked thoughtful.
Harry exhaled slowly before he spoke. "I hope you won't be disappointed when I come in three seconds flat, love."
8: What would you like to add?
“If I may be so bold, my Lord,” Potter says, “Longbottom’s cock may be a bit of a disappointment, but he’s one of your best Guards. He, for example, caught the thief that Seamus lost.”
Harry watched Draco’s face ice over, and knew he’d fucked up.
Nonetheless, Draco was quite surprised to find Harry Potter waiting for him in the hallway outside Slytherin when he and Pansy stepped out the next morning.
Draco spluttered.
“I haven’t got any ‘conquests’,” Potter said in a flat voice.
"Just the mission?" Draco said.

Draco nods once, and Potter smiles slightly.
Draco hoped his startlement didn’t show. “You… knew? About that?”
“Been waiting for this day,” Weasley said. “Figured out it was coming a while back.”
Draco layered on spells in an order he claimed was critical to success. Soon Harry was re-learning cock sucking.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I most certainly am not!”
“Living wards,” Harry began, sketching the Manor on parchment he’d pulled from his briefcase, “protect everything inside the grounds for as long as you live and months beyond. They protect land, creatures, objects, and structures. Up to and including your fencing.”
Defeated and overwhelmed, Draco turned to his bedroom and slouched toward the door. He could always masturbate.
“Yesssss,” Draco hissed. “Fuck me with it?”
memories! The sex had been lousy, but he could still wank to memories of sucking Malfoy’s beautiful cock. With permission.
Some random 8th year called out from the back of the crowd. “Forget that, did you Malfoy?”
So what if he had a little wank while he was naked. It didn’t mean anything.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Stripping down to nothing, Draco pulled that extra blanket from the hamper and put it back on his bed — careful to put the same, dirty side up. Then he picked up his very best dildo and slicked the ribbed, tempered glass slowly and generously with his wand. He’d come so recently, it was worth the extra care this dildo required. Then he lay down in the center of his large bed and started to work the glass shaft into his body. Stroking his cock as he pressed the dildo in and pulled it out, Draco closed his eyes and pictured Harry over him. “Mmm…” he hummed, trying to choose what Harry should say. Maybe “Open for my cock, Draco. I need to come, and your arse is just the right place to shove my dick, isn’t it?”
"Well, they're both as fertile as any normal seventeen year old witch or wizard," Afelgate said, frowning. "You or a friend could get her pregnant."
“Yeah.”
Draco really needed to curl up in bed for an hour and just… he did not suck his thumb. That would be completely ridiculous. But this was getting overwhelming.
it's all
"Then wrap a hand around my cock and jerk me off while I ride your dick," Draco said coyly, blushing and smirking and rolling his eyes a bit again. Clearly, he'd dealt with the past already, better than Harry had, for certain.
“Sir?” he said, from the floor near Potter’s feet.
The next thing he knew, he'd started tugging on Harry, pulling him to turn over, to lie on top of Draco, to rub his cock against Draco's cock - still trapped inside his fancy, silky shorts.
“No. Well, yes. But I mostly mean someone who would overshadow him in the public eye.”
“So,” Harry tried. “I feel a little more, uh….”
a nobody,” Harry said, laying back and throwing a hand over one eye like a silent film starlet.
“No,” Draco admitted. “I just thought we were dating. Thus, lesson learned: ‘Communication is important, even when it makes me very uncomfortable’.”
“I have been taught all my life that homosexuality is a horror. My son has… a boyfriend. The most desirable young bachelor in the nation. And I am realizing I was taught things that are, simply, wrong.
Harry slid further into Malfoy, who grabbed him from underneath with everything he had. He felt Malfoy's arms around his back and shoulders, Malfoy's legs around his waist, Malfoy's muscles clenching around his cock. Harry moaned into Malfoy's ear and then, feeling inspired, licked it teasingly.
They nodded at him, so Draco put his shoulders back and spoke to the air between them. “I thought I should switch over to taking correspondence classes, and not return to Hogwarts.”
Finally Harry stopped to survey his threads. Some pulsed, some hummed, others flowed. Many curved delicately away from Harry, as though avoiding body heat, or magic. Others bowed
"Indeed," Harry said, grinning. He'd not really considered polyjuicing Hole into anyone, let alone a girl. That was a fairly brilliant idea. He could tell the healer knew he liked it, and that the healer had given it to him. Harry grinned conspiratorially at Afelgate, deciding the man deserved a nice tip at the end of all this.
Harry stood silently for a moment, his hand suddenly heavy on Draco's shoulder. "Then I have an idea," he finally said.
Harry knew his blush was bright and obvious, but he didn’t know how to hide it. Wasn’t sure if he even should.
Having grown up mostly in Guyana and Belarus, Michael knew nothing about Harry. When he found out, weeks after the
"No need to apologize," McGonagall said, smiling warmly. A house elf let me know you were having some lunch. When you're done eating, I hope you will catch me up on your quest. Did you obtain the ring?"
He was not prepared for what he saw.
Teddy! Andromeda would know what Harry should do. She would know what Harry was
“Harry,” Andromeda murmured from the doorway. “Draco has been visiting with Teddy almost as often as you. I’ve simply been keeping you apart. Clearly, I was correct. Now, please come with me to the kitchen and help me plate lunch.”
“Oh, Draco,” Potter said, and he walked away to sit in his large, leather chair.
“Yes, Sire,” the servant, obviously named Jonathan, agreed. “I am to tell you when the carriage arrived, the, er, tribute was thoroughly bathed in soaps and then in precious oils. All of his body hair has been removed, save for the stuff that grows from his scalp. The leg and arm hair and such can return naturally or be magicked away permanently, whatever you prefer. He was dressed in what you see here, it came with him. He brought only a few outfits, Sire, all basically like this. He also brought trunks full of galleons, jewels, magical items and trinkets. Those have been brought to your Treasurer.”
t-T-t-T-t-T-t-T-t
wardsmiths,” Harry said, deliberately calming himself with tea and deep breaths, “in the past, have crafted wards that sloppily. But I never have.”
Harry should probably have taken a deep breath. "Don't you think this is weird?" he demanded instead, then flushed. They sat side by side in cramped captain's chairs. They were surrounded by dials, cupboards, shelves, stacks and displays. Malfoy perched in front of a small wheel, Harry in front of a set of somewhat interactive maps and view screens that showed all the other sides of the ship. They both had a good view of what was right in front of them. Nonetheless, the little drivable swimming tent thing felt claustrophobic already.
“Oh shush,” Harry groused, turning a little pink. “Don’t distract me with flirting. You’re the perfect boyfriend, and you know it.”
Draco paid the bill and hurried his mother to the Floo. “Vissy?” he called, and she was there, helping him settle Mother into a sun-lit chair with tea waiting at her right hand.
“Thank you, son,” his mother said, before continuing. “Some men feel anatomy makes them superior. Because women... open.” Mother blushed, but her voice was clearer. “But your... Harry is also a wizard. You have… choices. Physically.”
Unrecoverable. Forever.
“You don’t have to hide tears,” he said, and Draco could not help but look at his own shoes.
Neville winced.
"Er," Malfoy said, sounding uncomfortable. He stared straight ahead and kept both hands on the wheel even though Harry could see absolutely nothing in front of them but water.
“And Tuesday I had Vissy serve his favorite for dinner,” Draco said, remembering Harry’s gratitude. Shepherd’s pie had not been on the Manor’s menu since Draco had been small, until he realized how much Harry loved it.

Staring at Harry's erection, Malfoy reached for it, stroked it once, then took the head into his mouth.

Also, Longbottom must be every bit as bad in bed as Draco had assumed.
Terrifying.
Draco stared at him, horrified. “That was a good apology,” he said. If Weasley wasn’t willing to accept his apology, he was stuck.
This King addressed
"All four of them were at Hogwarts with you, and none of them took the Dark Mark or committed murder. That we know of." She frowned. "However, all four of them committed crimes for which they must receive punishment. The Wizengamot, in her collective wisdom, has sentenced each of them to ten years of community service. Three very strenuous situations await the ones you do not choose. All three will be worked very hard!

“I miss my comfortable bed. I miss my own space.”
“Well,” Draco says, his voice iced over with disdain. “Clearly you need a better solution. I forbid you to orgasm this month, as well, but from here you need to head over to the Apothecary. Professor Snape may have something that will help you grow. Frankly, there are larger dicks in town, Longbottom, and if you wish to serve in my Elite Guard – let alone have the slightest chance at serving my cock – you are going to have to grow your dick a good bit larger.”
“Working? I know this works, Harry. I’ve done it before.”
The next prisoner was a dumpy girl with spots and thick, curly blonde hair. Harry stared at her face for a few moments before realizing she had been on the inquisitorial squad with Pansy. Except… wasn't she a sixth year then? "Isn't she a year too old?" he asked the elder.
Vaginitis: Negative
"I'z will make sures Dudders learns this magic if he's does not already know it, Master Harry," Kreacher said. He looked quite pleased.
Draco pulled Harry closer. “I might keep you for the heat you generate alone.”
“So,” he said. “You were saying, Aunt Andromeda?”
“Regarding fatherhood, have you considered surrogacy?” he was saying. Harry’s eyes were clear and his hand was steady and Draco had no idea what he was talking about, but his heart leapt anyway, because Harry was talking with him about fatherhood instead of running for the hills.
"I wanted to," she responded, sullen and staring at the floor.
Robards sighed again, but this time it sounded a bit faked. "So yes, Potter. I will give you this assignment."

Panting, Draco arched his back. He loved Harry’s floating hammock. He loved
wake.”
“How wonderful, Harry,” she said. “Thank you! That really did tie you up all day, didn’t it? I’ve made a lovely dinner, and you should stay, so I can properly thank you.”
With his 8-7 office manager schedule in mind, Draco reserved Sundays for all the less pleasant tasks of a life without servants or house-elves: grocery shopping, laundry, house cleaning etc; because on Sundays he always enjoyed eating dinner with Mother and she liked to hear about his adventures with adulthood. This easily elevated Saturday up to be Draco’s favourite day of every week. He was free to relax, wander Muggle London, experiment with potions, write letters to friends, or any other sort of leisure he liked. He almost always did at least a little experimenting with his potions work.
The Wizengamot elder sank back into her large, plush chair and sighed.
Then, Harry met Michael.
They spoke about work, silly little things about the Ministry: oddly charmed window scenes, memos fluttering everywhere, strange Unspeakables who seemed to lurk obviously — as though they were reveling in their mysterious reputation, only pretending to not want to be seen. There was nothing much to say about Draco’s cramped, beige flat, but they spoke about the work Harry was doing on his house. Sirius Black had left it to Harry and apparently the place was a bit of a dump.
Harry's warm hand stayed on Draco's shoulder. "I realized during the war that I wanted you, but it was a bad time. You startled like a bird every time I came inside your personal space, and I was far too busy with being a soldier to dedicate enough time to you.
"By insisting on those two I use the one to boost the other's reputation. The irony! Since only Draco deserves even a

Score one for the boy who lived.
“Merlin fuck,” Draco howled. “I love this! I told you! Fuck me!” He straightened both legs and jerked at his erection until Harry pulled his hand off and replaced it with his own mouth. “Ahhhh!” Draco cried, and fucked into Harry’s hot mouth with small jerks of his hips while Harry fucked him with his dildo, his strokes long, smooth, and very, very deep. Harry's erection was a bar of heat against Draco's thigh.
There were one or two vendors with rainbow items, but Draco was able to wave them off without social awkwardness or discomfort. There were people with musical instruments, just sitting on their blankets and making quiet music. The closest one was pretty good with a guitar, and her girlfriend had a nice singing voice. There might not be a formal parade, but the streets were filled with same-sex couples, people wearing rainbows, people holding hands and enjoying the June sunshine. He was alone, but Draco was already glad he had come.
“If easy is overrated,” he began.
“We got really relaxed in the bath,” Draco said, not wanting Harry to be upset. “Then the sex was sweet and slow. It was just what I needed.”
Potter is fucking him thoroughly, slowly pulling his heavy dick from Draco’s arse, then ramming it back in. As though leaving is torture and returning is the only possible remedy. He does this a thousand times, surely. A million. Far too many times to count, at least.
It is with the granting of this sex slave
"No. I want them both. They'd just be… picking up garbage on Diagon Alley or something, I don't know."
“Harry is handsome, generous, intelligent, kind, and funny. He treats me with respect, yet does not take either of us too seriously. He loves his work, which he chose for himself and pursued diligently. He knows how to be happy.”
Harry wasn’t just fucking, him, either. It was a little like being worshipped. When Harry wasn’t sucking kisses into Draco’s shoulders while simultaneously fucking slowly into his arse, he was breathily praising Draco’s beauty or biting Draco’s neck.
The King stood, and Draco wanted to swoon at the breadth of his shoulders, his sturdy build, the handsome simplicity of his clothes. He wore expensive fabric, but with little decoration: only one sword, not so much as a single medal. His black leather boots were tall, heavy, nearly utilitarian. They did not look new. Draco wondered how often this sovereign still went out to practice sword and wand work with his guards and troops. Draco’s father had stopped bothering with exercises such as those when Draco had been a boy of ten. He’d had Draco do it instead, though that certainly wasn’t how he chose to explain it.
Annoyed at Harry’s presumption, but aware he might be correct, Draco raised one eyebrow.
Draco’s salad, chips and chicken parmigiana churned in his stomach as he continued to smile and nod and agree as Harry chattered on about… something. Draco should probably already know what.
Harry let him.
Harry didn’t seem to mind. He charmed the sweat and semen off their skin and cast another gentle warming charm.
“Where’d you get this thing? We need one in our other house. Immediately.”
Campylobacter Fetus: Negative
Then Harry stared as Draco grabbed the cheddar popcorn bag, poured little candied chocolates into his mouth, and captured three large chocolate biscuits into one hand. He devoured it all, seemingly too fast to taste. It was disturbing and fascinating, at the same time. Harry’d never expected to see Draco Malfoy indulge gluttonous appetites – frankly, to see him eat and drink like a pig.
“No,” Draco said as firmly as he could. “You can fuck my

7: Fuck in front of conjured mirror
She obeyed him and Harry turned to Hole, who walked toward the healer without being asked.

Ignoring the house-elf hands in front of him, Harry tried to concentrate on what he could hear, instead. There was nothing to hear, however, except soft, snuffling breaths. Harry tried to look around, but Dobby was looking only at the shoe, so he was reduced to searching Dobby's peripheral vision. To their left, he saw a white wooden leg from some sort of furniture. The furniture must not be very big, for the leg was slim, even to a house-elf's eye. Harry had a sudden thought. A baby's cot? Then he was distracted, for Dobby was scuttling into a corner, seemingly frightened.
“You were serious about that?”
“Thus our need to wash the dishes outside,” Harry said, amused.
Dudders looked uncertain, but he raised his hairy hands and the leather began to lose its deep, overdyed hue. Looking at his Master, Dudders saw approval, and the colour faded from the leather even faster. Eventually the heavy leather was a pale, nearly white tone, and Harry clapped his hands.
"Yeah?" Harry said, wanting to know what Draco meant. It was always good when misery had some company.

Draco nodded.
Mouth squirmed under his hand and cock. "Yes, Sir," she breathed out huskily, "please? I'll know you meant it all when you come in me. That's how I'll know I'm sexy."

“Wish I knew what you were thinking,” Harry said, ignoring his aching knees.
No one else was back yet, Draco noted as he slid his books and homework into his trunk and locked them in tightly with a spell combination none of his friends had yet found a way to break. He slipped back into his bed, resealed all the spells on the curtains, and completely removed his pyjamas. He took out the dildo and lube, lay flat on his back, toyed with his hardening cock, and began to imagine a long, complicated and delicious scenario. Or more accurately, rework a plot he’d seen in a Wheezes Daydream he’d owl-ordered from their new XXX line. But Draco still thought of it as his own.
Draco straightened up, a look of pleasure in his eyes and soft triumph on his face. "Drinks from the break room, Harry. Do keep up." He stalked away, leaving Harry to wonder what Draco might have in his hands when he returned.

Unable to contain himself, Harry bounced from his chair. “Who wants tea?”
Draco was pretty sure he’d spoken coolly, but he was too nervous to be quite sure of his external presentation.

Taking surreptitious care that his robes hide his own erection, Draco sweeps off his throne and down to inspect his Guards in person. First, Neville Longbottom, who peers up nervously at Draco through his fringe.
“Still, what it would be to have a man who cares for
Potter sighs happily, so Draco takes Potter’s cock well into his mouth, getting the man as wet as possible. Then, with his left hand wrapped firmly around the lower half of Potter’s erection, he jerks Potter off and sucks hard on the rest, enjoying the slightly bitter precome that begins to drip from the end of Potter’s dick. “Hmmmm,” he hums loudly, and Potter moans in pleasured surprise.
Draco swallowed and looked at Harry. Harry looked uncomfortable. No one spoke, and Draco felt his shoulders creeping toward his ears. Someone needed to break the silence. Could Draco do it? He shouldn’t have to, surely? Harry was the heroic one, the brave one.

Andromeda sighed. “My sister meant that… torrent of opinion as a sign of respect. I’ll have to reflect before I know whether I agree with everything she said, but I know she meant it. She was telling us the truth, as she understands it.”
“Sit, Draco, Harry,” Andromeda said. She had Teddy seated already. “I’ll serve. Draco, won’t you tell us all about your exciting day?”

They both stood, but only Harry stepped toward the surveillance display.

“Didn’t know,” Harry admitted. “You own much more property than anyone else I’ve ever done this for. I guess that’s why?” He patted Draco’s hand and tried to nudge Draco into laying down. “I should go. You need sleep.”
his reputation, but that’s why he’d been willing to fuck that particular boy. If any other boy had offered, Draco would have spat in his face.
Cautious, Harry took Draco’s limp hand, and Draco tried to process everything.
"I just came from his
“Nice,” the King said, and Draco could not stop himself from jerking his head just upward, enough to see the look on the King’s handsome face.
"You two
Finally, though, while Draco had ceased to pay attention to her, Granger had found the magic words that would usher him in and her out of Minister Potter’s large, handsome, deeply private office.
“The facts are evident. These superior wards conjure sentient protection around the Manor and grounds. You control them and would be aware of any attempted breach. You could imprison or repel anyone who tried.”
“Really?” Harry asked, unable to help himself. He wanted back in Malfoy’s bed, of course, but some of these guys sounded pretty brill.
