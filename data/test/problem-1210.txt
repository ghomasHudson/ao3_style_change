He was happy for Neville to be back in his life. He even got to meet his grandmother! It was awkward, but she did make a good apple pie.
"Forget I said anything."
Harry gives a small smile. "Thank you, Neville." He says.
"Are you alright? I mean, that scene was... Unnerving for sure." Harry says.
"Hermione!" says the round red-headed woman he's seen many times before. "Oh, it's so amazing to see you. I see you've brought some new faces here!" Her eyes meet his own and he begins to worry for a minute, until she gives him a bright smile and says, "Draco, how wonderful to truly meet you." She reaches towards him and gives him a warm hug.
"I will. Is that all?" Neville asks.
"But you weren't..." She sighs sadly and sits on the floor beside him. "You know, even though you're quite mean, we have a lot in common."
"Woah! Why are you in such a hurry?" They ask him.
"It was terribly awkward." Draco complains as they step down towards the dungeon. "We would just sit there until bedtime in silence. At least before that whole little event happened, there was at least arguing to fill the silence. I'm just glad they came back to tell us to go back to our dorms before the day ended. I thought I would lose my mind."
"Longbottom still hasn't done anything!"
He rushes through the halls, trying desperately to get to the common room.
The doors suddenly slam open to reveal Lucius Malfoy shouting a jerking away from Aurors carrying him out in handcuffs.
"Do it!" Aunt Bellatrix shouts at him.
His palms were sweaty. He had never done this before. How does one ask another to a ball?
He sits up and grunts and Harry jerks his head towards him.
"Tarantallegra!" Harry shouts.
Without a second thought, Harry grabs his invisibility cloak and makes his way to the second floor.
Neville gives her a strange look. He didn't want to think about something flying into his ear.
"First of all, I don't like Malfoy at all, we are just friends. Second, I really haven't noticed any of this. Third, why in the world would I give a love potion to Neville?" Blaise asks.
"That you have a little thing for him." Blaise smirks again.
Draco stands up to leave but is stopped once again. "And Draco, if you ever want to stay here for holidays, you may," Dumbledore says with a smile.
"He did? He really said that?" Harry asks.
"But you haven't?" His grandmother asks.
"Tell him he's doing great," Neville replies.
::The Children Situation::
"Because I know who it is!" Hunter sings. "But, no shame here. I fully support whoever you decide to love. In fact, all love is supported from me. So, if you happen to express your feelings for that person to me, no judgement, I promise on Helga Hufflepuff's grave! But, if you don't want to tell me, I understand too." This was the most Hunter spoke at once and it made him realize just how energetic the guy was. He spoke quick and rambled on, but was really really happy about it.
Neville anxiously looked around, hearing whispers all around him. He worried it was all about him.
His voice cracks, "S-sure." He clears his throat and stays silent.
He scans the table and notices there's chicken legs, mashed potatoes, corn, crumpets, carrots, and even grapes.
Harry gets so close he can feel his breath on his lips. They were mere inches away.
Blaise opened the classroom door with a slam and dragged him out into the hallway.
"Yes." He replies softly, opening his bag to take out his quill and ink.
"Hi." Neville says with a smile.
"Look, I'm sorry if I shout at you. I just really want to scream and punch something!" Blaise shouts. Draco quickly cast muffliato as he listens to Blaise. "I was trying to get our deal done, you know, tell Neville how I feel. I was walking down the hall and there they fucking were! Abbott got there before me! Granted, I knew I had no chance but now there is no way I can possibly tell him now! First Luna, which wasn't actually anything... And now Hannah?! How is it that nothing ever goes my way?! I was born with a mother who pays me no attention and will buy her damn boyfriend some food and leave me to eat stale leftovers. I had to learn how to cook for myself! Now the one thing that I thought could bring me happiness slips out of my fingers! Why is it always me?!" Blaise sighs before continuing, "But most of all, I hate myself! I hate myself for hating them together! I should be happy for them! I love him for Merlin's sake, but... I don't know." He sighs once more, "I want to cry but I also want to hex her into oblivion. I don't know maybe me and him were never meant to be." Blaise says, finally calming down and plopping down on the floor below him. "Maybe I'm not meant for anyone. Wow I really am embarrassing myself now."
"Oh alright... He kept talking about how handsome you were and how he wishes he could talk to you." Pansy lies.
"Hey," Neville squeaks, feeling humiliated at his horrible tone of voice.
Neville's POV:
Blaise didn't even process what was being said, he just simply nodded and stared at his plate.
His eyes meet those of Blaise Zabini and he suddenly feels nervous. "U-uh, h-hey!" Neville stutters.
"Harry's right, you are rude!" Myrtle retorts.
"Wh-"
Draco smiles a certain smile Blaise hasn't seen before. He couldn't explain it, but it felt so special. Something so authentic from Draco just didn't exist, unless it was anger or one of those rare tears. But a smile this authenic just wasn't possible to be seen on Draco, until now.
He furrows his brows in curiousity and grabs a fresh piece of parchment and writes.
"We can go catch fireflies, maybe that'll make you feel better. Or perhaps we can go feed the thestrals." Luna suggested.
"Maybe he's becoming a better person," Harry says.
"Severus will sort that out tomorrow. For now, you must go rest. You seem terribly shaken." Dumbledore says.
"I'm sorry. I was... I was just..." He trails off.
Blaise's POV:
Blaise notices him staring and smiles at him. "What?"
Even if they made him feel crazy, it was the most amazing thing he has ever felt. He only felt this once, and it was with Blaise the day they went to Honeydukes together. What can it be? Is he just so touch starved that a simple touch like this makes him all weird?
Blaise runs up to him, "You alright?"
"No thanks." Blaise says, trying to hide his irritation but miserably fails.
He whined and cried like a baby, but he couldn't help it. He ached for Neville, but he would never have him. He debated many times finding a random girl to be with for at least one night or maybe two, but he decided against it. It never made him feel guilty or dirty before, but just the fact that he considered it made him disgusted with himself.
Neville holds up the sword, ready to strike, only to be thrown backwards by a spell Voldemort threw at him.
Neville violently shakes his head, "No, no, no they won't! I've humiliated myself! My life is over!" Neville nearly screams.
"Coward!" Professor McGonagall shouts after him.
"Get out!" Draco says in surprise.
Blaise chuckles, "That's quite the compliment."
"Draco, you're early." Professor Snape points out.
"Who? Crabbe, maybe?" Harry asks.
After a while, Harry grunted.
He sat at the Slytherin table alone, but in the perfect spot. This time Blaise wore all black, but it wasn't any less fashionable. The button-up shirt was once again tucked into his black pants and neither had a wrinkle in sight. He suddenly feel a bit inferior considering his shirt was heavily wrinkled and his hair was messy. However, everything Blaise did made him feel inferior.
Draco stayed silent for a while, simply staring at Harry. He narrowed his eyes slightly. His eyes are so green.
Draco's POV:
"It's time to go..." Lupin says. Well, this explains the emptiness. He looks around the classroom to see nothing but empty desks. How long did he zone out for?
"Now, for the original subject-"
"Wait!" He shouts.
"Well... Listen, I don't want to out anyone and you might be upset with the answer."
"Are you ok? Do I need to take you to Madame Pomfrey?" Harry asks.
- Draco: Dragon (happiest memory: the times he has with all his friend's and family. It used to be the first time he talked to Blaise about his home life and Blaise gave him a hug)
"Oh! Good one!" Draco says sarcastically and smirks. "You think I'd listen to an oaf like you?"
"Well, what brings you here, Potter?" Draco asks.
"Yes, Professor," Harry speaks.
"I think you're lying," Neville says. "Oh no, I'm sorry! That was mean!" He scrambles, pulling away from Blaise. Why did he keep spilling out everything he was thinking?
He was one of those idiots.
"Then what is it?" Blaise asks.
Draco gives him a scowl, "You don't understand it. How can you help?"
"Uh, I g-gotta g-go." Draco stuttered, rushing away from Harry and stumbling on his way out. He blushed at his clumsiness and rushed out as quickly as possible.
He begins to wonder if this is what he made those girls feel. Maybe this is payback for all those times he's used them? He wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.
Blaise jerks his head in Neville's direction, "Huh?"
Blaise smiles back at him and pops a blueberry into his mouth. "I'm glad."
Neville smiles, "I love them! Thank you."
"Yeah, well... at least for me. Harry might be able to help more." Luna says.
His hand shook and he opened his mouth, but nothing came out. Dumbledore turned around and looked at Draco with the same calm expression he always had.
"Misses Malfoy, I have a few questions for you regarding your son and his father." The Auror says.
"I think I might be a bad influence." Blaise sniffs.
"Longbottom!" Draco shouts, but it helps nothing. Now Draco really did need to talk to someone.
"Ginny, I'm sorry about what I said. I didn't mean to put it that way. Well, I did but it was a mistake."
"I can't!" Draco shouts.
"I don't know..." Neville replies sadly.
"Stop!" He hears his Aunt shout. He keeps his eyes on Harry and Harry glares at him. "Drop your wands. Drop them!" She shouts at them.
Neville softly whimpered. Nothing was going to change. Surely enough Blaise would kick the bloody hell out of him if he messed anything up. It was surely over for him.
"People like you are the reason my parents will never be the same again! I know who you support, so stop acting like you're on our side! Because of people like you I will never have a normal life! I will never know who my parents truly are!" Neville's voice cracks, "I will avenge them if it's the last thing I do and no one will stand in my way, not even you."
"Definitely." Blaise smiles back.
It's not like he didn't like girls, they were great. But Neville was different. He has been with many girls, but he never loved them, he just wanted to be with them for a couple of nights to kill his mind, but now it's different. It's been different for two years. For once in his life he's felt love for someone, not to mention actual empathy. But now he wishes he didn't. It's awful.
Draco's stomach swirls and he leans into Harry's palm. He didn't have time to comprehend what was happening.
He smiled wide. He was tempted to stand up and jump all around the room, but decided against it. He may be thinking about someone that isn't him at all. Just because Neville seems to have taken a liking towards boys doesn't mean anything. The thought makes his smile drop from his face, but he needed to bring himself back down to earth before he got his hopes too high.
He can feel his heartbeat go from normal to crazy within seconds. When Harry enlances their hands and tightens his grip, it seems to go even crazier. He can't speak nor can he move.
"I'm leaving," Draco says, beginning to walk away but is caught by Blaise.
"Go apologize!" Hermione demands. He sighs but gets up and makes his way to Ginny's room.
"That too." Harry smirks. "I really want to give us a try. I'd love to show you the love and care you deserve if you'd accept it."
"That's a strange way to put it, but sounds accurate." He turns to the entrance, "Holly berries!" It opens up to reveal a group of Slytherins gossiping on the couch, including Pansy Parkinson.
"But just the other day you were ranting about how amazing Neville is. How much you just wish-" Draco is cut off by Blaise covering his hand over his mouth.
"No, but he fears he is." Xavier informs.
"Myrtle, you disgust me." Draco sneers.
"You never are to see that wretched boy again! He is poisoning your mind!" His grandmother shouts.
"Wait, who's gonna be there?" Neville asks nervously.
"Are you ok?" Harry asks him.
Neville gives a crooked smile and looks back over to Blaise. Blaise looks back and gives him a smirk.
Blaise squeezes Neville's hand and snakes his arm around his waist. Neville blushes and his stomach does that funny feeling once more.
"Ever since third year, I always kinda thought you were... attractive." Harry gives a nervous chuckle.
Draco sighed sadly. Perhaps he can obliviate him? Then he doesn't have to know about his boggart. No, too risky.
Blaise smirks at him, "You could probably guess who. Regardless, it isn't a valid excuse to not let me help you anymore."
"Of course I don't. I can finally get it out to someone! It weighs down on you a lot when you hold it in for so long." Blaise says and Draco nods in agreement. "Ever since my father divorced my mother, my mother has refused to let him see me because he's some dangerous criminal or something. Although, I'm not sure if I trust her... she lies about everything. I've even caught her in a lie and she still lied to my face. Then this boyfriend comes into our lives and starts telling me what I can and can't do and telling my mother I'm doing stuff that I'm not. He once told her he found me in Knockturn Alley and she screamed at me for it for two days! She still believes him over me. As time went on she began to give him all he wants and ignoring me. He's the first to be taken care of and I'm expected to do everything myself. When he cries, my mother stops whatever she is going and runs right to him and tends to his every need. When I cry I'm told to suck it up, grow up and stop being a baby. I always felt so dull and lifeless. It felt like nothing could possibly make me happy again, not even playing on a broomstick or messing with a toy bludger. All the childhood wonder died ."
"Do you ever do anything right?!" Professor Snape shouts. "You do understand that you could've killed us all with your ignorant choices?! What were you thinking?! The more you do this the more points you lose! I have had it with you! Next time, let Blaise do the potion. Maybe then you won't mess everything up like you always do." Snape slams Neville's book onto his desk, making Neville jump. "Get out." He demands. Neville obeys almost instantly and grabs his things in a hurry and sprints out of the classroom.
"Let's get you home." His grandmother says, grabbing his arm and pulling him away from Blaise.
"Is Luna Lovegood in there?" He asks, breathing heavily.
Draco rolls his eyes, "Fine, I'll believe you. But really, go away."
"This was all that Slytherin's fault. You should've never brought him here." He says.
With a woosh, they land right in front of an odd looking house. It seemed to have many different houses stacked upon it and almost seemed to reach the heavens.
"I snuck out." Neville says with a chuckle.
Draco's POV:
"What isn't surprising?" Draco sneers.
"Your heart is beating really fast," Neville says.
"No, I don't! Don't be sick!" Blaise shouts.
"The toast just... It's probably stupid." Draco chuckles humorlessly.
Blaise pulls him closer, "Because you deserve it."
Neville was shocked to find Harry sitting right on his old bed and staring blankly at a book in front of him, "Harry!"
Draco feels a pang of fear, but why? It's not like that's even remotely true. "No, just stating the facts," Draco smirks.
Does this mean Draco likes boys? Is that why he got so upset when Harry joked about it? "Uh... Draco?"
"Do you think I'm sexy?" Blaise teases. If it were possible, Neville's face would turn to flames at how red it was. "I'm joking, Nev." He chuckles softly.
He was pleasantly surprised to hear Harry chuckle. The sound made him smile wider. "Sleep well," Harry says before the room goes silent.
He opened up the envelope and read:
He glares at them and clenches his hand into a fist.
"The password?! Quickly, please!" The fat lady scolds. Neville finally gets the strength to stand up and sighs softly.
"You watched me?!" Draco shouts.
"I brought you Every Flavor Beans!" Blaise announced.
Late that night he was told that Dumbledore was in the astronomy tower. This was his time. It's kill or be killed.
"Hi, it's Neville again. It may not be the best time because of what's happening now but I needed to make sure you were safe and had a home to go to. I know we don't really know each other but you've been so kind I can't help but worry. Please write back soon, even if it's just telling me you're safe. That's all I need to know."
Blaise looks at him for a few seconds until saying, "Yes... I have. I have a lot of times... It was with you! Before we got together and well... after you said you might not see me again. I couldn't eat... I couldn't sleep... It physically hurt without you."
"Out, Mr. Zabini! You don't wanna see this." Madame Pomfrey says, finally coming back.
"I apologize but that isn't my place. I will have a talk with them today about it to make sure it's them but regardless, it's their decision to tell you who it is. Although, I will tell you that it's someone you would expect the least." Dumbledore says with a smile.
"Did something make you upset?" Harry whispers. "I can take you home, you know."
He now regrets telling the school about him and Hannah.
There was no way he was staying here. Besides, he had a quest. What better way to get it done now?
Harry smiles at him, cupping his cheek and leaning forward.
Harry begins fuming. "Permission to speak, sir?" Harry asks the judge.
The next day was just as expected. Everyone and their mother was talking about Neville Longbottom. Luckily for Neville, he was no where to be seen.
"Whatever," Draco says, pushing past him and into the room.
"No. I did that to my Aunt Marge... Blew her up into a balloon... Could've gotten into loads of trouble for that. I don't recommend it." Harry says.
"Draco!" He says, catching Draco's attention immediately.
"What?! How?!" Draco shouts, only to be hushed by many patients.
"Hey, if nothing else I'll feed myself. I do it all the time." Blaise smirks a bit, but it quickly fades away. They both sigh and Draco leans back in the seat.
"Neville, it's nothing, they'll forget about it!" Hermione promises.
He kissed rough, a bit sloppy even, but it was the most he's ever felt in a kiss. The girls he had before tried too hard and it was only fueled by lust. Not this, nothing was like this. They pull away and Blaise smiles at him again, which makes Neville look at the floor.
"I've come to fight! Not against you... with you." He announces.
"You'll never believe it! It's Professor Snape!" Crabbe announces.
"You don't know what I'm talking about do you?" Harry asked. Draco could hear the slight anger in his tone.
"Perhaps, I may be wrong... But maybe it's veritaserum." She informs him.
"Neville, sit down!" Blaise demands. Neville obeys almost instantly and stares at the floor. He has that same look he had when Snape would shout at him. "I'm sorry... I didn't mean to sound so aggressive. Look, I need to tell you many, many things. But first, I need to know what you meant."
"Well... We, uh, just started dating so." Neville replies quietly. Well, maybe he shouldn't have said that.
"No matter! I was just about to tell you to leave." Madame Pomfrey chuckles, "I'm just kidding."
How did Potter know? Did he stalk him and find out? Did someone from Slytherin say something?
Hannah's POV:
"No, no I can't!" Draco cries.
"He didn't want to come. I'm going to take him some food though and make sure he eats it." Harry says, grabbing a tray and walking over to the table of food.
"But it doesn't look like yours." Blaise complains.
Blaise grabs his hand and pulls him up. He stumbles up and comes face to face with Blaise. "What in the world?! How are you here?! I thought your grandmum-"
"Yeah... I second that. Nothing is easy anymore. Sometimes I wish I was a kid again... Back then my father didn't care too much about what I did, but then I turned into a teenager and now it seems like he hates me. Not that he seemed to care before, but at least before he never paid attention to me. Now all he does is watch everything I do and yell at me all the time. Sometimes worse... Will it only get worse from here?"
"Good. So... We-well um..."
"Ok... And?" Neville asks.
Blaise pulls away and looks at him, "I'm not living there anymore. Well, I got kicked out. My boyfriend, not knowing it was me of course, told Luna and she gave me a place to stay. Although, I almost got completely kicked out of there too... But I'm back there!"
His eyes open to find Harry sitting in a chair with his head in his hands.
"Uh... Fine?" He replies.
He then began to wonder how his father would feel if he happened to like boys. It ranged from supportive and loving to scary and mean. But he shouldn't think about that either. He shouldn't think about his father at all, it'll only make him upset and then he'll embarrass himself in front of everyone.
He could hear Blaise's heartbeat. It wasn't as even as he thought it would be, it was actually pretty rapid.
"I..." Neville seemed to struggle as he would open and close his mouth as if debating whether or not to say something. "You scare me," Neville says suddenly. He gasps and covers his mouth.
Harry sees this and narrows his eyes at Draco. "What are you so happy about, Malfoy?"
"What did you get from Honeydukes?" He asks him.
"Draco needs to get the first piece!" Molly says, smacking George's hand away from whatever was on the table.
"You did?! Oh..." Draco says.
He couldn't. He just couldn't.
"What will you do to help?" Draco asks.
"Yeah, what was that?"
He stopped in front and knocked violently on the door. Snape opened it, "Hello, Draco."
- Hermione: Heterosexual Heteromantic
Draco's POV:
"Neville Longbottom! What a pleasure! Come sit." says Dumbledore, startling Neville slightly.
Luna sighs, "I mean to say that I won't take him from you." She says with a smile.
I didn't randomly make up the words "parvus" and "ignis". They are both latin. Parvus means small or tiny. Ignis means flame. In short: Parvus Ignis is a spell I made up that makes your wand act like a lighter.
A "Goodnight, Nev!" and a "Sleep well, Neville!" were heard from Seamus and Dean at the same time as Neville stalked up the steps and toward his dorm room.
"Yeah, Merry Christmas." She smiles back awkwardly.
"Oh... Uh... That's been ok. I switched out partners for Blaise. It isn't too bad now." Neville acknowledged.
Draco walked into potions, head held high as usual. "Hello, Mr. Malfoy." Professor Snape says to him without expression.
"Oh... Hello." Neville replies. He looks down at Neville's wrist and smiles. The bracelet he gifted him shining in the sunlight.
"Myrtle, I could've been... You know... Doing my business!" Draco shouts.
"Woah, no way! If too many ingredients go missing, it will be our heads! Plus, those are perfect cookies, no need to make another." Hunter says.
His embarrassment felt like it was going to kill him. He groaned and pulled on his hair in frustration. Why did he have to be this way?
If she was truly terrible, she would've gotten angry and planned revenge on Draco for liking Harry. However, she came to realize that it was a completely valid reason to why her efforts to get Draco herself never worked. He was gay! No wonder! Every other boy was too desperate to turn her down, but not Draco.
"I thought the same way... But these feelings remind you that you have love in your heart, that you're human! That's something special. It may hurt, but it's a blessing to feel such an emotion. Don't take it for granted, ever. I took it for granted and now I'm regretting it. You can learn things from everyone you love, even if it doesn't work out. You have them for a reason. They teach you something in life. For example, Gellert taught me what love felt like. Not only that, but he made me realize who I truly was. If I never met him, I never would've known. Now, think about what your love towards Neville is teaching you. Even if it hurts, you need this. You wouldn't have it if you didn't." Dumbledore says, giving him a kind smile.
Blaise chuckles and sits beside him before taking out a white-colored bean. He pops it into his mouth and gags.
"I'm sorry!" Draco says quickly.
"Master, you punished yourself, why?" She asks.
Draco watches Harry walk away, feeling as if Harry just beat him in a duel in front of everyone. He suddenly feels as if he's going to scream. He runs into the nearest boy's bathroom, running into a stall and hiding. Just like at home, always finding a small little place to hide. He never knew why he felt the need to hide, all his father did was judge him and he only hit him with curses once. He's just a baby, isn't he? A weak, disgraceful, failure of a son. He'll never grow, will he?
Harry's awareness is turned to their hands. He notices that Draco's hand was soft and delicate. He is so amazed by it that he forgets that Draco is incredibly angry at him right now and getting angrier. His grip loosens and Draco jerks away from him.
"Petrificus totalus!" Harry shouts at him. He falls to the ground and his wand drops from his hand with a clang. Harry runs over to him, grabs his arm and gives it a look. "Blimey! What are doing to yourself?!" Harry shouts at him.
Draco pauses for a minute. "It took me a while... But the only thing I can think of is you two... Harry's been here to support me and he gives me affection I've never had and... You, Blaise, you were the first person I was able to talk to about my problems in life and the first person to give me an actual hug." A single tear escapes Draco's eye, "Words cannot express how much that meant to me. It may have just been a simple hug, but to me it was so much more. It was actual love someone showed me for the first time! And now Harry comes along and is showing me even more love and... It's so bizzare... It's hard to believe it's real sometimes. Sometimes I worry I'm just imagining it all and I went crazy eventually with my father and now I'm imagining every good thing to happen to me ever."
"No... Just sad." Neville says. Is he trying to humiliate himself?
As he walks to his next class, he runs into Hannah.
Without a warning, Professor Snape silently does a spell. As a result, a crumpled up piece of paper falls onto his desk. He picks it up and reads it. "Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger." He says emotionlessly. Draco hears a sigh of relief from Ron behind him. Another paper is thrown at the Professor. "Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini." In response, Pansy and Blaise high five. "Neville Longbottom and Gregory Goyle." A whimper is heard from Neville and a grunt from Goyle.
"Thank you!" Blaise smiles big and hugs Harry. "I owe you one, scar head!" He pats his back and runs out of the library.
"Hi, Hannah!" Neville says, standing up beside his bed and grabbing his stuff.
"What is it?" Blaise asks.
"You... Are... On..." He struggles to catch his breath, "Veritaserum."
"So... Uh, now that we're officially dating... I uh..." Blaise rubs the back of his neck and glances at the floor, "I thought we could go out together somewhere. I haven't really planned anything yet but uh... would you want to?" He winces slightly and waits for Neville's response.
"What? With what?!"
He takes a small bite and smiles. He hasn't had a warm dessert in a long time.
Blaise shots his head up and gives Draco a glare.
"Leave!" Draco shouts, Goyle scattering away instantly.
"Longbottom?" Draco says.
"Are you sure?" Blaise asks, hesitantly grabbing the bottle from Dumbledore's warm, bony hands.
Apologize, Draco. You should apologize. He should, shouldn't he? No, that's weakness... But he didn't do anything. Right?
"Oh, get over yourself," Harry remarks.
Blaise stares down at Neville's arm as well, but not out of anxiety but rather debating whether or not he should hold his hand. But, why was it such a big deal? He held onto Luna's hand and it was no big deal. Why does this have to be a big deal?!
Blaise smirks and shakes it. "Deal."
"What is it?" He snaps again.
"I thought you were roomates with Draco." Neville says.
- Luna: Hare (happiest memory: moments with her friends, especially when they'd take up for her and make her laugh)
Blaise held open the door to Honeydukes for Neville and watched him step inside.
"You promise to get me the frogs?" Pansy teases.
Neville grabs it from him when he finishes and smiles, "It is you..." He whispers. But that smile slowly fades. "Wait... since when? How long did you like me?"
Ron and George both run over to the table and Harry leads him towards them.
"Granted. Escort Harry Potter out of the court room, please." The judge says.
Harry sighs. He admits that Draco could be right. "Fine... But look, I'll uh... I'll talk to Blaise for you, ok? I know you guys were close... or at least you seemed close."
"N-nothing... I'm fine." Neville says. "Just... w-worried about the Yule ball." He lies. But, in all reality, he didn't know why he felt this way.
"Mister Longbottom!" He heard Snape shout. His insides began to burn and sink down. Please don't do this. "You wouldn't be such a pathetic disgrace if you managed to pay attention!" Snape scolded.
"What the hell?!" He shouted.
Something about it dissappointed him. But, after all, he shouldn't be surprised. The only Slytherin he has hope for is Blaise Zabini due to a word going around that Neville did indeed get that present. Except no one knows it was Blaise except him. The only thing that worries him is that he is Draco's friend. But, the urgency to get the perfect gift for Neville is a good alabi for him. He just hopes he wasn't fooled.
Blaise's words ring in his ears. 'I love you' he hears. It felt amazing to hear those words. Every time he thought of them, it made him smile until his cheeks hurt.
Neville stares at him and opens his mouth to say something, but is silent. "I'll prove it to you if you want." Blaise says, "I know your father is no longer around, your grandmother doesn't like to hug people... I uh... I don't know how else to prove it to you..." Blaise says.
"Mister Zabini?" McGonagall asks, her voice echoing off the walls now that the students are silent.
The Gryffindors groaned. They must be upset with him. It's all his fault.
He opens it up and sees that it's the same cookies he had gotten from Luna the other day. Maybe Luna got this for him?
"Nothing! Just that she shouldn't have given you the potion!" Blaise says.
Harry glances back and forth to Blaise and Draco before finally speaking up, "Just know that if you mess with Neville, me and all of Gryffindor will kick your arse."
As he's walking he hears soft sobbing. He follows the sound and is met with a distraught Neville with tears covering his face.
"Stay calm! The more you freak out, the worse it makes it!" Blaise shouts behind him. Luckily for Neville, it wasn't possible to freak out. "Try to relax your muscles! It can slow down the broom!" Blaise shouts to him.
Now he was supposed to fight Harry, win, and bring him to the Dark Lord?! No matter how angry he is at Harry, no matter how much he hates him, he just can't do that! He just can't.
"Who took it?!" She shouts.
Professor McGonagall shows up in the doorway, "Neville Longbottom?" He looks up and she beckons him to come with her. He stands up, grabs his things and follows her down the hall. "You're going to see Professor Dumbledore, he has something important to tell you." They stand in front of the gargoyle guarding Dumbledore's office. She says the password and leads him up the steps.
Blaise's POV:
The things Pansy said rang in his ears. But what if she lied? Pansy was one of the more Slytherin Slytherin's in their year and it wasn't uncommon for her to do things like this for her own personal gain.
"No, I can't do that! If I just give him cookies someone else made what kind of present is that?! No way, I am doing this until I get it right, even if it burns this kitchen down. Got it?" Blaise affirms, dumping the old cookies in the trash and quickly grabbing the dough ingredients once more. Hunter simply sat there watching him, pretty much baffled at his outburst.
"Yeah... uh..." He looks around and notices many hospital beds with patients in them, "Why am I in a hospital?"
"I did nothing like that." Draco responds.
"Neville, it's-" Blaise says but is quickly cut off.
"Then leave me alone."
Blaise sat beside Draco and gave him a smile. "It's been a while since I've seen you, mate."
"Not anymore, mate." Blaise says, rubbing his back softly and increasing his grip only slightly on his hug.
He looks over at Blaise and smiles victoriously. Blaise, for the first time this week, allows his lips to curl up into a smile.
"I think I will. Thanks, Professor." Neville says, standing up with his things in hand and leaving the room.
"I didn't quite know what you'd like... so I brought as much as I could." Blaise says while he pulls out a container of strawberries and another of sandwiches. He then pulls out two jars of pumpkin juice. Then finally, he pulls out a bouquet of baby's breath flowers. "That is for you," He says, laying the flowers beside Neville.
"You really do seem to like him," Draco says.
"I'm sorry if something upset you, really." Harry whispers.
He makes his way up the steps and into a room filled with warm browns and reds. The ceilings were high and detailed. He looks at in wonder. He looks over to see a long-bearded man in a large, fancy chair.
"Draco, look at me," Harry said once again. He slowly turned his eyes in the direction of Harry. Harry smiled at him making the tingling rush all through his body. "Are you alright?" Harry asks softly.
Neville's POV:
Blaise must be upset with the amount of times he has gotten cut off, but Draco is quite relieved she stepped in.
Blaise furrows his brows and thinks for a bit. He's right. If he never met Neville he never would've known what true love felt like and would've been stuck in a life of lust and manipulation. He never would've known empathy, compassion, and most importantly: happiness. Even if he did feel miserable at the moment.
"Is that good?" Blaise asks with an eyebrow raised.
Harry looks under every stall, stopping at the far left one.
"Thank you." Neville says, but doesn't know if he really believes him.
"Hey, Neville!" He said.
"Who would I tell?" Draco asks.
Harry's POV:
"Well, I'll uh... See you tomorrow." Blaise says, turning on his heels and walking away without another word.
"I feel a lot more calm. Wow." Draco says, holding his wrist to his nose and taking a deep breath in. "I still feel urges though."
"Harry, I must speak to you." She says.
They hear footsteps and quickly moves away.
"Sectumsempra!" Harry shouts. The spell hits Draco and he watches as Draco fall to the ground. The spell also managed to hit the sinks, making water flow onto the floor.
Blaise had invited him and Neville to Luna's house for an unknown reason. They seemed to be waiting for something and Blaise wouldn't let him eat anything.
"All great ideas, but don't forget we need to make sure we don't forget his little fear." Xavier smirks.
Blaise walks through the halls, trying not to think of Neville. The only thing it would get him was the thought of Luna and Neville together, which only made him miserable.
"Would they tell anyone?" Draco asks.
The whole class gasped.
"Alright," His mother says with a deep breath.
"You just apologized to me!" Harry points out with a smile.
Neville blushes heavily and says, "We gotta go. It's really late."
"Welcome, Mister Potter." The judge says, which causes Draco's heart to stop. "Now, we ask you what are your experiences with them. What did the Malfoy's do to you?" The judge asks.
"What have you been doing to yourself?!" Harry shouts.
"Great, because my friend made more. Seriously, he never stops." Luna smiles.
His thoughts were cut off by a hand flying in his face, "Hello! Neville! What's got you spaced out?" asks Parvati Patil.
Draco hears voices outside the compartment and watches Harry, Ron, and Hermione pass by. Not so far behind was Neville and Hannah. He glances at Blaise who watches them. He notices Blaise and Neville catch sight of each other, which makes Neville stop for a second. Hannah seems to sneer at Blaise behind him, but follows Neville closely.
"Open the door if you can, please." Harry mutters.
They drop hands when they come into view of the table.
"Harry!" Lupin shouts. Harry doesn't listen, he just hits Malfoy over and over until his nose bleeds. "For Merlin's sake!" Lupin shouts, sending a spell their way and hurling them across the floor away from each other. All the students sit in shock, staring down at the two boys with the blood running out of their noses.
"I want you to try again. But this time, really concentrate on it. Imagine the blueberry is already a bird. Try it." Blaise says, handing him another blueberry.
Draco can feel his cheeks heat up. He could only hope Harry didn't notice, yet realistically, it would be plain as day.
"I tried to stop it! I really did! I worried that... if... I did it... you would both hate me... I would be a dissa-appointment." Draco says through sobs, "But I couldn't stop! It wouldn't go away no matter what I did! It wanted to rip my hair out!" Draco shouts.
"Hi." He says softly.
"Draco-"
"I need advice..." Neville almost whispers.
He didn't want either, but at least Draco hurting him doesn't make him have another identity crisis. Yet, even his thoughts when he is awake make him question everything. All he can think and worry about is Draco. His boggart still involved his father. But he still thinks that was also some plan, but deep down he knows that makes no sense. While all of this is happening, he can't forgot the impending doom he knows is coming soon. He worries Draco is going to be a part of not only his, but all of Hogwarts doom.
Gregory Hullons, the Auror in the room, walks with Harry out into the hallway of the Ministry. His eyes are met with Draco's and Draco stands abruptly.
"Not long..." He replies awkwardly.
"I will. T-talk to y-you later, yeah?" Neville says.
"I missed you so much." He cries into Neville's shoulder.
Blaise's POV:
"The bloody mark! What else would there be?" Draco scowls at him.
He looks up to see Blaise. He still heaved from his new discovery and Blaise stared at him strangely.
He was dressed in a suit and tie, one his father instructed him to wear. It was nice, but knowing his father got it made him feel disgusting somehow. He tried his best not to dwell too much on it.
"Sorry, Draco," Harry says confidently.
"Aww, that's so sad! I might cry!" Pansy sticks her lip out in a pout.
"Don't be so quick to deny it! I see the way you look at him and then the way you look at me. You don't like me, but that's ok, I know why. Just know that I have no intention of taking him away from you. By the way... We aren't dating and never will. Good luck!" She then skips away with a smile on her face.
Neville's POV:
"He has a boyfriend to pay attention to and I'd probably just be a burden. I'd definitely be a third wheel with them as well." says Draco.
"I need to know who that person is. It's a matter of life or death." Neville says.
"Tomorrow at five Hermione will come to bring you, Luna, Draco and Neville to the Burrow. Be ready." Harry says.
There came a knock on the door and Luna rushes over to get it. Right in the doorway is Hermione.
"Come sit, boys," McGonagall says. They both do as such. "Now, I know you two boys haven't gotten along since first year, but this is just getting ridiculous. If I see any more of this hexing and fighting, I will expel you both." Both Harry's and Draco's eyes widen. "Now, since you two haven't been able to get along, we have devised a plan."
"Yeah, you're definitely going to the infirmary." The continue on and Draco makes an effort to keep his mouth shut. Luckily for him, he never says another word.
"Draco!" She sings. "I have to talk to you."
"Great," Harry says. Draco leans forward and pecks Harry's lips one more time. He watches as Harry smiles wide.
Just then, his Aunt throws her knife right at them, only to have it clang to the floor and their enemies dissappear.
The more people that talked to Draco and the more Draco responded, the more shocked Blaise felt.
"What-"
"Well, first of all Neville has this pretty pathetic blanket he has slept with since first year. His legs have grown out a lot and it barely covers his arms and legs. I don't know why he hasn't gotten rid of it, especially since it's pretty obvious it drives him crazy. Anyways, I'm sure he'd appreciate a new one." Harry finishes.
Harry simply looks at him before opening his mouth and asking, "Why didn't you tell them? You knew it was me, yet you said nothing. Why?"
"I... uh," He whispers, "I h-have y-your stuff." At this point he wishes he put on the bracelet before this. It seems to have some magical power that makes him confident.
Now Draco can't seem to think of who it could be. All Gryffindors are pretty confident. Which one could possibly be the way Blaise is describing?
Hunter shrugs, "A potion, maybe? Maybe you can make him a calming potion! I know you're pretty skilled at that kind of stuff, at least I've heard."
Draco sniffs in amusement, "In that case, I hate her too."
"Does that mean it's genuine?" Neville asks.
He rushes into the room, noticing Bellatrix holding her wand up to Hermione Granger's throat and Greyback doing the same with Ron Weasley. He looked over, seeing a boy with a puffy, swollen face being held in place by Peter Pettigrew.
"Do you want chocolate wands?" Blaise asks behind him.
"You tried to kill my girlfriend, you loony!" He shouts, running after them.
"Why can't I?" Draco asks.
"What's wrong?"
"Oh, great! Come on, Nev." Blaise says, grabbing Neville's hand in his own and walking towards the Great Hall, a smile never leaving his face.
Everyone sat and watched in horror and Snape, being who he is, took away twenty points from Gryffindor for 'disturbing the class'.
"I'll definitely try." The boy smirks and is remains silent. Draco is on veritaserum? But that can't be right.
"I wish I could go back to the days where I didn't like anyone." Blaise says, "Where I just went through my days not caring for anyone and being the worst person ever. I still had problems, especially with my mother, but it was much easier."
Harry's nerves jolt up inside. "Is Draco ok?"
Soon enough, however, the whimpers turned to heavy breathing then the heavy breathing turned to soft sounds. Potter was talking, but Draco couldn't make out the words.
"Yeah... I-I'll walk you." Neville says with a smile and grabs her hand, leading her away from the library. It was nerve wracking that the ball was tomorrow. A large part of him didn't even want to go, let alone with Hannah. But, he promised to at least try to be with her. It's not like he liked anyone else and he didn't have anything better to do. The least he could do was try. Besides, his grandma would send him a howler if she dicovered he didn't wear the tux she sent him let alone go to the ball she's been pesturing him to go to. Ever since Professor McGonagall made it known to his grandmother that he's being bullied and keeps to himself, his grandmother won't leave him alone about school activities and making friends. It was quite annoying. Still is annoying.
"I'll go get the ingredients." As much as it bothered Blaise to leave Neville alone near a bunch of Slytherins, especially now, he was worried what would happen if he made Neville move from his seat.
"Wait!" Blaise shouted abruptly.
His mother rushes over with her wand and Draco followers her. His mother duels Ron while he takes on Harry. His eyes are wide and he can barely breathe and every spell he throws is blocked.
"He'd be delighted to know. If you ever want to say so yourself, he's in Hufflepuff. His name is Hunter. He's pretty easy to find considering he's the only Hunter in the whole school." Luna informs.
"You won't be unless they really think you won't be able to stop yourself or that you'll continue to harm yourself. But, really, now that I'm... your b-boyfriend... if that's ok to say... I think I should focus on helping you through this." Harry says.
Blaise's POV:
"He's really worrying me." Blaise says.
"It makes everything go away... All the scary thoughts, all the stress and sadness. I guess it's just a way of distracting myself from any emotional pain, you know. I know it's probably counterintuitive... But it kind of feels nice. It's easier to harm myself but it's harder for others to harm me. Maybe this all sounds stupid... But it makes sense to me." Draco says.
Draco's POV:
Before Neville could continue, Blaise grabs two packages of chocolate wands and a large lollipop. "Anything else, Mr. Longbottom?" Blaise says in a high-pitched voice.
Again... terrible liar. "Alright. I'll see you later!" Pansy says, giving him a bright smile and skipping away.
He felt tears form into his eyes but he tried to push them down as much as possible. Is he really going to be this stupid and cry over that?
George said jokes and he would laugh along with them all while Ron and Hermione continued to playfully argue and Blaise and Neville continued to converse and stare lovingly at each other.
Pansy glances up at him suspiciously, which makes his heart race. 'She knows, she knows!' He thought, his eyes darting anywhere but at her face.
"You... You're letting me see him?" Neville asks.
When Blaise returned, not only was Snape furious but the whole class made it a goal to pester him about what just happened. That made Snape even more furious. When Snape was furious, the whole class was miserable.
"It's Draco, I'm just making sure I can come in." He replied. Harry replied with a yes and Draco walked in with a sigh.
"What the-" the door swings open, "Woah! You look like you're about to murder someone!" says a terrified Draco in front of him.
"Where the bloody hell is Draco?" Blaise asks angrily.
Harry's POV:
"But... how'd you all get them here?" Hermione asks again.
"Neville, you have a present!" Parvati informs happily.
"Then why are you agreeing to go to the ball with Ginny and not looking happy or at least nervous? Something is wrong here, I can see it. I'm not a bloody troll."
"Malfoy?" Harry whispers from beside him.
They all make their way into the castle and Harry goes to them.
"What?" Harry asks him.
"Uh... How have you been?" He whispers to Neville. Again, why does he care?!
He then begins to tear the wrapping paper. He reveals a plain white box, which he then opens as well. The inside makes him gasp. The very first thing that catches his eye is a big brown blanket. He runs his hand over it and smiles in happiness. It was so soft, almost like petting a bunny. He pulls it out of the box and smiles wider. It was much bigger than his other blanket.
He steps up to the gargoyle, says the password, and steps up the now revealed spiral steps.
Harry looked at him with a blush. "Uh..."
"Shh!" He lectures them. He puts his leg on the window sill and pulls himself up with his hands.
Draco stares at the floor as well, "Uh... N..." He struggles to say no until finally, "Yes."
"It is done, my lord." Aunt Bellatrix says with a smirk.
Laying there on the ground is Draco Malfoy. They rush towards him and Harry lays a hand on his chest, feeling him breathing softly.
"Malfoy, get your ass off that bench and do this damn project," Harry said lowly.
"I don't know... he'd have to constantly be taking it and then get more. It would just be too much." Blaise says.
Both boys gulp and do exactly as their told without wait. They exit the room only to be met with Professor Snape's stone-cold expression.
"Oh... I was just trying to find..." He sighs.
They both stand in shock. Blaise slowly looks at Neville, knowing he can't possibly hide his secret now. Neville looks at him with wide eyes and red cheeks and begins to back away from him.
"You're gonna have to talk to him about it eventually. You can't just ignore it."
"Are you lying to me?" He asks, bringing his face closer to Draco's, staring him straight in the eyes. Draco noticed his pupils weren't circular but rather skinny and vertical and his eyes were a deep red. He brought his claw like fingers up to Draco's face. "There will be consequences for lying, you know. Big consequences." His sharp fingernails scratched Draco's face, leaving a small sting.
He folded up the letter and gave it to his owl. He opened the window and the owl flew away. He didn't expect his owl to come back with a letter, but luckily enough, he came back nearly thirty minutes later with a letter in beak.
The Weasley boys make noises in agreement, their mouths full of pie.
Harry's POV:
Blaise continues to walk, almost going towards his common room until he realized: many Slytherins stay there during the ball. Then, he thought, what was a calming place to go? Well, the seventh floor was always pretty quiet and no one would be there during the ball. He makes his way and finds nothing but a dead-end and a weird door on the right. Nothing more, nothing less. He sighs. He makes his way to the bench on the few end of the left corridor.
"Yes! Just tell me!" Harry exclaims.
Snape began the lesson on the Draught of Peace and Neville tried hard to pay attention to every word, but he simply couldn't. He never could. That's why he was such a failure. His mind just wasn't good enough.
"Did you try a coping mechanism?" Harry asks.
"So what? It's not like I'm destroying my life with this! You make me the happiest I've ever been! Not to mention I flew all the way here when I couldn't have done that before. You taught me that! You make me a better person! I can't let anyone take that from me. Besides, I'm the only one who has the right to tell me what to do and how to feel. You said it yourself! Blaise... It really hurt to be without you. I don't know why exactly... But I missed you so much it physically hurt! Have you felt that before?" Neville asks him.
Ron gives him a glare along with Harry. Draco simply smirks and turns around.
"Eww, get those away!" Draco shouts.
"Dammit, Goyle!" Draco sends a curse his way, it barely missing Goyle.
His face heats up as he remembers Blaise smiling down at him and calling him 'Nev.' It was terribly embarrassing. It was even worse that he felt this strange twisting feeling in his stomach.
"Oh, uh no it's fine. I was just going to get a lollipop." Neville says softly, "I kinda did want one, though. No, I meant-"
Blaise's POV:
"Yes. You two will be living together." McGonagall announces.
"My father, he... He has very high expectations. Ones that I really can't meet. I'm expected to know every polite rule in the book from birth, always look polished, never gain any weight, marry a girl, carry on the Malfoy name... When I don't meet these expectations or I do something he dislikes..." Draco sighs and fails to finish his sentence.
Neville pulls out his wand and takes a deep breath. He remembers one spell he couldn't get right, "Avifors." He says, pointing his wand at a blueberry.
"Please look at me, Draco." Blaise begs but Draco doesn't do it. "I hope I didn't upset you or anything by not standing by you-"
The Slytherins around the Hall gasp and mutter amongst themselves.
"You aren't implying that we like each other, right? I simply went to the ball with her, that's all." Harry says.
"Headmaster's Office, now!" Lupin shouts, grabbing them both by their robes and dragging them out of the classroom.
"Poor, pitiful me!" Draco ridiculed, "Fuck off!"
"S-stop! L-let me go! I don't need to be here!" Neville shouted.
"Stupid elf! I could've died!" His Aunt shouts.
You may be saying 'what if Harry feels nothing for Draco!' Well, that isn't the case either. She tried to flirt with Draco in front of him, and he reacted exactly how she hoped. It was confirmed when they caught eyes and Harry turned his head quickly.
Harry grabs both of Draco's hands and looks at him eye to eye, "Everything will be ok. We've got you, ok? You're safe."
"Nothing is stupid. You can tell me anything, never forget that." Harry assures.
After long talks and many sips of hot chocolate, they paid and went on their way. When he was walking out the door he collided with a tall man.
"Maybe... I haven't asked her yet." Neville replies, staring at his shoes.
Neville looked up slowly and saw a smiling Blaise holding up Trevor in the air with his wand. Neville blushed and clumsily stood up.
Draco could hear her complain about how she failed the task over and over again. He just wanted her to shut the bloody hell up. He would've casted a hex on her if it wouldn't have landed him in Dumbledore's office. Good Merlin, he never wanted to go back there.
"Hey... uh, I heard you protected by sister back there." Ron says with a smile. "Thank you."
"Don't fucking call me that." Draco pushes her away from him and runs up to his dorm. How many times does he have to say he doesn't want her?! He grabs fresh clothes and runs to the bathrooms. He has a quick shower and changes, sighing in relief.
That was his first kiss... However, it all felt strange. Was a first kiss supposed to feel like nothing? Maybe it was just too quick to tell? The more he sat there, the weirder he felt. He was surprised, but also felt something he couldn't quite express. Instead of dwelling on it, he walks back inside and grabs a couple of trecle tarts, maybe more, and sneakily eats them at a lone table.
Hermione rushes towards the house and they all follow her. She stops in front of a old wooden door. She turns the knob with a creaking sound and steps inside. They all follow her closely and Draco gets a whiff of some kind of food cooking, warm pie, and old parchment.
He hears a thump behind him and an eerily quiet voice say, "Draco... Glad to see you following your father's footsteps." He turns around and almost chokes. He knew he wouldn't look like daisies and sunshine, but bloody hell. "You fear me..." Voldemort smiles softly. "No need for that, Draco. Come here."
"Before I give this back to you... I want us to have an actual conversation about this." Harry says, "No fighting, no screaming. Just talking."
"Sir, me and Mal-Draco had been enemies for a long time now, a long time. But, I will say this... I came into their home disguised before the battle at Hogwarts. Both Draco and his mother were asked if it was me. To be perfectly, honest, I really did think Draco knew it was me, but he said nothing. Neither did Misses Malfoy. Misses Malfoy also saved my life. She knew I was still alive before Voldemort did and she told no one. As for Draco, he's the one who threw me the wand that saved my life. Lucius Malfoy on the other hand, consistently tried to attack me and still had bad intentions I'm sure. But Misses Malfoy and Draco... I do truly believe they were on my side. As well as Severus Snape. We all thought he was terrible, but he did all of this because Dumbledore told him to. I feel the same goes for Draco and his mother. They were simply doing as they were told in order to survive and get through this war." Harry tells them.
"Besides, no one needs to know except you. You don't owe anyone anything, let alone the Gryffindors. The only person that needs to know about this is you and the only person that has the right to tell you what to do is yourself. Just be yourself and let yourself feel these emotions, even if you're afraid nothing will ever happen. There is nothing wrong with how you feel and you should allow yourself to feel for once. I notice this a lot in you, Neville. You always invalidate your feelings, judge yourself, and hold back your feelings and emotions. You also tend to keep your mouth shut a lot. You need to stop that. You deserve respect, especially from yourself. Don't be afraid to speak your mind. Even though you don't believe it, you are a Gryffindor! You were put there for a reason. Don't let fear shut you up. Don't let anything shut you up. I want you to start telling things like it is and allowing yourself to feel. You deserve it. Now, I wanna do something. It's a simple yes or no. I'm gonna make a few guesses to who this person is, because I do have a few guesses. This one might be completely stupid but, Gregory Goyle? Just a guess though. Next guess, Draco Malfoy? Again, probably stupid but who knows. He isn't ugly so I'd understand. The very last guess is,"
"No need to thank me. It's the least I could do. There was no way I was going to let you burn, no matter how annoying you are..." He trails off, "And I for sure wasn't going to allow you to be thrown under the bus after I read Snape's letter... And saw his memories... Why didn't you tell anyone?" He asks.
"That's great! By the way, what are you doing?"
"A plan?" Draco asks.
"He's crazy." Blaise says, struggling against Draco's efforts to push him away.
"Y-yes?" Draco squeaked, making himself blush at how girly he sounded. What was going on with him?! Malfoy's don't do this thing!
"I hope they feed you." Draco says quietly.
"Well done, Draco!" Voldemort says with a smile. Draco goes over to his parents and stands there, staring at the ground.
"Luna over there says she wants to talk to you." He says.
"What did you say to Pansy?" Draco asks.
"Yeah." Draco smiles back, "I actually don't hate you as much as I thought."
He wouldn't have thought for a second that someone like Blaise could've fallen for someone like Neville.
Luna told him that Neville would be there in the Courtyard, and he was! He sat there alone, the pages of his book flopping in the breeze and his chin resting in his hand.
The more he tried to put the thought away, the farther the thought went. He felt disgusted with himself. How perverted was he?!
"Shut up!" Blaise shouts. He stays silent for a while until he perks up, "Wait! That evil little-"
She sees Draco and smirks. Blaise was once again furious. He would always shoot angry looks at Pansy, but never was willing to talk to her about what she had done... until now. Perhaps Draco's sassiness and irritability was running off to him.
"No! We have to kill the snake." says Neville.
He stands there, his legs shaking but failing to make a move. He was frozen. The screams filled his ears and made him want to crawl into himself. He watched as his Aunt reached down and hold the knife up to Hermione's skin.
"Neville, are you alright?" As soon as Dumbledore said those words, it was like a switch. He began to wheeze like crazy, his eyes darting around the room for something. He didn't know what they were looking for, but he couldn't stop them. "Breathe, Neville. In and out. In through your nose, out of your mouth."
"You could've destroyed Ne-Draco's life! Do you have any regret at all?!" Blaise holds his hands out in rage.
"Friends?" Neville asked, looking up at Blaise with innocence in his eyes. Blaise thought he might die.
"Look, I'm not in the damn mood for your teasing. I just want to leave and forget this ever happened and completely forget Potter exists. So let me go." Draco demands.
"Parkinson, may I speak to you." Blaise says, arms crossed against his chest.
"Want one?" He asks and Neville shakes his head in response. "Alright, well, if you go back to your dorm there won't be a punishment. I understand if you do so and I'll inform your teachers."
"Draco?" He heard someone say. He gasped and quickly covered his mouth. "I know you're in here! I just heard you!"
He just hopes he's becoming less of an arse. It shocked him when he apologized earlier, but it made him really happy to hear him say that for the first time ever. It makes him have hope for him. He walks out of the classroom with Hermione and Ron.
"Yeah..." Neville replied, staring at Blaise's back as he continued to walk away.
"Uh..." Draco trailed off, trying his hardest not to meet Harry's eyes.
"Oh. Well, I didn't really find it. Someone gave it to me but I don't know who it was. Why?"
Blaise shrugs, "I hope not. I don't know if I could take anything worse than this."
Draco bumps into someone and they both fall on the ground. "Sorry, I-- Potter!" Draco stands up quickly and sneers at the raven-haired boy on the ground. "This is your fault you--"
Harry sighs. "Fine, Draco. Just try to be quiet when you get back. I'll be sleeping." With that, he hears him walk out.
"You feel like a freak, don't you?" Myrtle asks, peeping her head through the stall door.
The Dark Lord was furious that they couldn't find Harry Potter. To occupy his time, he instead found various muggles and muggle-borns to torture and kill. Many times he had done it right in front of his eyes. They all stuck to his brain like glue and he could no longer sleep, not even in his closet.
"Woah... Wait... Boyfriend?!" Draco asks.
"You seem to care a lot about it, huh?" Pansy smirks.
"They were Neville's!" Blaise replies.
They would lock eyes on occassion, but they wouldn't keep eye contact for longer than a millisecond.
His father raised his wand and stomped towards Draco, "You're a disgrace." His father said. "You're a freak. My son... A pansy. A Malfoy doesn't stare at boys! A Malfoy doesn't think about boys. A Malfoy doesn't cry and whine about every little thing! You are a boy, act like it!" His father shouted, making Draco jump. He tried to hold back his tears and instead shook like a flag in a hurricane.
Harry's eyes widen, "Oh... What did he say?"
"Oh... Oh!" Hunter exclaims as Blaise adds a tiny bit more vanilla into the bowl. Oddly enough, that did the trick and he smiled brightly.
He was worried, very worried. Even though it drove him crazy that their hands kept touching and he had to go scream in a bathroom because of it, he wished he was here right now, just to make sure he was safe.
"I'm so-" He is cut off by a sharp collision of his shoulder to his father's cane. His eyes began to burn and his vision got blurry. He tried to stop it, but it just hurt so much. He felt tears flowing down his face and felt as if he was naked.
Draco jumps and gives him a glare. "What?'
"That's wonderful that you're safe as well! Merlin, I was dreadfully worried about you. I noticed how torn up you were about Dumbledore's death. I am so sorry about that. I wished I could've hugged you and told you it would all be ok. It hurt so much to see you that way, but I'm sure you were hurting more than me. But you're strong, I know you can pull through, with or without that bracelet. But I'm so happy that my gift has made your days better. You should give thanks to Harry and Luna, though. They were the ones to help me figure out what to get you since I wasn't in your house and well, we don't speak really at all. Also, thank that Hufflepuff named Hunter as well, he was very patient with my efforts at making those cookies. I ruined it maybe twice and he still was composed, even after I nearly threw a fit about burning the cookies. Now, to answer how I feel... I'll tell you that at the moment I feel amazing. I mean, I'm talking to you and you're safe and I'm actually getting good meals and I've been sleeping a bit better. I feel phenomenal! As for what it looks like here, it's so beautiful you wouldn't believe it. Right outside my door is a field of flowers with every color imaginable and there is life everywhere you look. The birds are singing and the sun is bright. It's amazing. It really lifts your spirits. I never would've imagined being in a place like this. Luna says it isn't much, but I think it's the most luxurious place I could've ever been put in. It beats my once dark home covered in dust and spiderwebs. There never seemed to be sunlight there. As for my friend... that's an issue. I don't know where he is. After Dumbledore's death I haven't seen him at all nor have I heard from him. It worries me a lot, but I try to not dwell on it too much simply to keep myself sane. But I keep telling myself that he's alright, even though deep down I know something has to be wrong. I just hope he's safe and alive. But at least I know one person I care for is alright. Also, what do you mean by figuring yourself out and why does it make you feel like that? I apologize, I'm not a ravenclaw."
Was the boy he was talking about in the letters him?
"Yes," Neville smiles, "But... I wanted to say thank you for helping me. I really appreciate you being there. You really helped me and uh, the gifts got me through a lot. I sleep with that blanket every day."
"Come on, Neville, let's get you calmed down." Madame Pomfrey said softly.
"You're asking me if I'm alright? I told you not to be weird, Potter." Draco turns his head back to the front of the class, ignoring Harry's annoyed sigh.
"What about?" Draco asks, turning his attention to the floor.
Blaise stared Snape right in the eyes.
He couldn't stop thinking about what would've happened if he just kissed Neville right then and there, but it isn't that easy, it never will be. It would also be incredibly inappropriate and rude considering he was with the girlfriend he is clearly happy with. He thought he was finally at peace with it, but he isn't. Their encounter last night proves that. He blasted the music in his room without regard to what his mother will do if she hears it when she comes back through the door. But knowing her, she wouldn't be back for hours, maybe days, maybe weeks. If he was lucky, maybe even months.
"Well, first of all... It seems to me that Gryffindors attract Slytherins much more than we thought." Blaise chuckles.
"How wonderful!" Luna exclaims.
His grandmother sighs, "How long has this been going on?"
They go right into Diagon Alley and into a floo network. His father grabs the powder and says very clearly, and quite eerily, "Malfoy Manor."
Today was no exception. He found a new way to do it this time and he planned to try it. He grabbed his wand, pointing it to his dark mark and said, "Parvus ignis."
"Try me," Blaise smirked.
"Maybe... Just drop it ok. He had enough to deal with himself. We weren't much different. He didn't see it as an option. So please, just drop it." Draco demands.
He walks as fast as he can away from the scene, only to walk ever faster as anger began to creep into him.
"Your touch makes me happy," Draco says and sighs in defeat. What in the world was happening to him.
"Shh! No one else can know!" Draco says, "I don't even know how it happened it just... happened. Now Ron keeps giving us weird looks and it's weird to look or even be in the same room as Harry."
Harry stands there blushing. "Uh... I'm gonna take you to Madame Pomfrey." This time, Draco doesn't fight it. He lets Harry take him by the arm and lead him to the infirmary.
Draco hesitantly starts to fill his as well. He wasn't used to filling his own plate and he for sure wasn't used to getting to chose how much he could pick up and what exactly he wanted. It was all new to him.
Neville sighs, "I guess."
"What?!" Draco perks up.
Blaise scoffs, "Are you serious?!" Blaise steps closer to him, "You really think you're such a savior. When really you're anything but that! Neville is picked on every day and you don't do anything! None of Gryffindors do anything! Yet you expect them to stick up for him if I happened to mess with him?! How thick can you be?! They won't do it for Neville, but they surely will do it for you because you're the Golden Boy and all Nev gets is a sack of shit thrown at his face every day..." Blaise narrows his eyes, "Fuck you, Potter." He spits.
"Uh... Ok." Neville watches as Dumbledore sits at his desk and Neville chooses a chair in front of him. "Y-you have a nice office..." Neville says.
It's all he wanted right now. A tapping came on his window. He looked up to see an old brown owl flying right in sight. He opens the window and the owl drops a letter right in his lap. He opens it and begins to read, but the owl keeps chirping.
Blaise's POV:
"I forgive you. But, it was nice to dance with you and dine together." Ginny says.
"Look, I-"
"But... You never have before."
"Neville, I-"
After a long train ride, they finally are able to get on the ground. He was hoping to see his mother, or maybe no one at all. Sadly, he came face to face with his father. He grabs his arm and drags him away from the train.
He steps in and notices Hannah is already sitting there. He smiles and sits in front of her.
"Hey," Draco says with a smile.
Blaise didn't answer but instead kept dragging him to Merlin knows where.
He walked to potions the next day in a hurry, didn't quite know why. He sat in his seat alone, not even the teacher was here. He didn't sleep at all last night, so he just decided to stay awake. It's not too bad, actually.
Madame Pomfrey gave him a soft smile, "Here," Ironically enough, she handed him a Draught of Peace.
Neville looks at him quickly before grabbing his stuff and speeding away.
"Now, take your wrist, hold it to your nose and breathe in. It will calm you down." Blaise informs.
"Didn't have your girlfriend, Potter?" Draco teases, "Why you here so early, huh?"
- Blaise: Homoromantic Bisexual (never finds it out but doesn't seem to care)
"Oh... nothing." Neville lies.
"Whatever, Ron. We'll see how this goes." He walks past them.
"You don't have to help me just because we're together now. I can handle it on my own."
Neville closes the space between them, but instantly wishes he didn't. Blaise was amazing at it and he never wanted it to end, but Neville couldn't help but realize that he kept ruining it. Their teeth clashed and Neville's face burned. He pulled away and Blaise smiled at him.
When his finishes eating much more politely and listens to the people around them talk amongst themselves, he was free to leave. His mother insisted that he go to Hogwarts and be with his friends, but most of the time he just sat alone, not wanting to be around anyone. Not to mention Blaise was being disgustingly cute with Neville and Draco didn't want to be a third wheel.
Lupin gestures for them to go in at the sound of Harry's voice.
"Uh..." Draco stares at his desk.
"No can do, Nev. You will not go your whole life not knowing how to fly. How will you transport yourself from place to place?" Blaise asks.
He rushes that way and finds it almost instantly. He locks himself in and takes a deep breath. Why did he get so emotional over that?
"To Blaise, I worry that this will be the last time we talk. My grandmother says I can't see you anymore. It hurts so much. You've treated me so well and I care about you so much, but this could be goodbye. I'm sorry. I want to fix it but I can't. I don't want to let you go but I have no choice. Please, if I don't ever see or talk to you again, please move on. For me. I am begging you. Don't be alone forever because of me. I thank you for everything you've done and I'll miss you incredibly. I'm so so sorry. Goodbye - Neville."
"It doesn't matter that Harry's gone-"
He quietly makes his way to sit towards him and plops himself in the seat beside him. "Hi." Blaise says softly. Neville, once again, didn't react whatsoever. "Did Madame Pomfrey fix you up? I noticed Draco was in our common room this morning so..."
He had been paying too much attention to Trevor that he tripped over a rouge book in the hallway, falling over and losing Trevor on the way. Trevor hopped away quickly and Neville stumbled trying to get up.
Blaise doesn't seem to meet Draco's eyes after that. "Uh, just Lovegood... She looks awfully nutty with her butterfly hat, it was hard not to look." Blaise chuckles awkwardly.
"Yeah." says Harry, "Are you alright?"
Neville struggled as he dug into the dirt. Professor Sprout had asked him to get some plants from the garden with their roots intact.
Harry huffs, "I take one look at your arm, Draco, one look! All I can see is burns and cuts and bruises. It can't be from your father! They healed you and he's gone. So what have you been doing to yourself?!"
"Severus..." says Dumbledore, a single tear falling down his face.
"I wanna know more about your life at home, if you don't mind."
"Why?" Harry asks, furrowing his brows.
"Wait, I'll get it." Dumbledore stands up and picks up the bracelet. He gives it a strange look, one Neville can't really understand, then grabs Neville's hand and slips it onto his wrist. Neville was too preoccupied with the issue he was freaking out about to wonder how Dumbledore knew to do that.
"I'll just..." Neville gestures to the outside of the Great Hall and stands up.
It's not like his grandmother doesn't love him, she just doesn't like to touch anyone ever. She didn't even hug her own children or her own mother, that's just who she is. She only hugged him once, but it was a very awkward one which he was certain they both hated. She shows love in other ways, like sitting in the living room and talking with him about everything under the sun for an hour. However, it can feel lonely, especially when you only have your grandmother to talk to.
If it was a Slytherin, they must be some outcast and must have a Z in their name. The only one he could think of was impossible. There's no way that Blaise Zabini could be the person who gave the gift. Unless the guy lied about his house. Maybe he is a Hufflepuff?
He gets closer and can now see that it's Draco sitting on the floor, wiping his face with his hands and sobbing. Moaning Myrtle is floating above him with her hand on his back. His hair was messy and he was grabbing it in chunks angrily.
The nurse lays a metal tray onto the table beside him. It has a piece of chicken, cheese, black tea, and vegetable soup.
"You're awake?!" He looks over to see him mother looking at him with a bright smile. "Oh, we were both so worried!" Both? "We didn't know if you hit your head or if you'd not eaten enough. Oh, has he eaten?" She asks Harry.
"No." Draco says and sniffs. "I bloody hate myself. I'm sitting here on this nasty floor crying over my pitiful life and fawning over some idiot and spilling my secrets to a Slytherin. I really am a weak dimwitted failure."
"May I help you?" Luna offers.
"Oh no. What did he say?" Draco asks worriedly.
"So... you and Ginny, huh?" Fred asks, giving him a wink.
"I'm sorry." Blaise says once again and walks away as quickly as he can. He notices Blaise swinging open the doors of the Three Broomsticks.
"Neville, we need to talk." She says softly.
"We are so happy to have you here. Make yourself at home!" She says, pulling away from him.
Professor McGonagall sighs. "Very well, take a seat." Harry and Draco take a seat beside each other. They managed to agree to transfigure a quill into a frog without making too much of a scene. The frog took a liking to Draco, so he decided to take it with him. By the end of the day, Draco had a pet frog named Aristotle and two full classes of not having to compete with the famous Harry Potter. He was actually quite happy.
"Really?!"
"No, you didn't," Draco says with a smile.
"Well then maybe you should fix up your act, huh?!" Draco shouts.
Harry stares at him with surprise written on his face. Why is everyone suddenly saying things they don't mean to say?
"B-Blaise... Blaise Zabini." Neville replies. "I didn't mean to say that!" He shouts.
Blaise's POV:
"Blaise!" Draco shouts, making Blaise jump.
Draco shakes his head, "I can't do this Harry! I don't know how to explain it! It's this weird sensation on my arms and... I need to do it or it will keep taunting me. Maybe that sounds strange but... I can't stop it! It's driving me mad."
"How do I do that?" Blaise asks.
"Well, I get the joy of seeing Draco spill all his secrets to Potter, then Potter tells the whole school and bam! Perfect plan." Pansy smirks. "You should be happy! Remember when Draco threw your remembral at the wall and shattered it. You were pretty upset." The truth was, the remembral was for Neville, not him.
Blaise looked at him, wondering if he was ok. He seemed to be upset about saying what he did. Blaise couldn't explain why that would be. He wouldn't have said it if he didn't want to. "Uh, no it's ok. I understand. We don't have to be friends."
He sits down beside her at the kitchen table and she turns to him, "Neville, you've been acting weird lately. Is everything ok?"
"Huh? Oh... Hey, darling." Blaise says, his voice deeper than before.
"Oh just get back at me then why don't you! See if I care!" Draco shouts. There is a moment of silence. "Oh, can Ms. Myrtle not get revenge? Boohoo. Go the hell away."
"Well she says that Neville can't see me anymore. We didn't talk for weeks until he, get this, snuck out of his house in the middle of the night. Luckily enough me and Luna were both awake. It seemed to be perfect timing. I was so stressed about it I couldn't sleep so Luna went to talk to me about it and here comes Neville on a broom-"
"Nevertheless, we need to find him and quick." Luna says.
"Well then... Perhaps I can teach you?" Blaise asks with a smile.
"I don't need your pity, Potter." Draco sneers.
"B-but Draco and Harry are still partners!"
"You don't get it, do you?! If I don't do this... I'll die." His voice cracks and a single tear falls down his face. "I'll-"
"Draco?" Harry said.
Blaise grabs his hand and looks him in the eyes, "We all start somewhere. I'll help you practice if you need to! You got really far today with flying. You can do much, much more. I just know it."
Blaise comforts Draco in the meantime and he attempts to get his mind off things by talking about potions, their boyfriends, and even different foods. It seems to calm down Draco's shaking as well as his crying.
"Ah, I see where this is going," Dumbledore says with a sad sigh. "He's your partner, yes?"
Harry screamed, "No! Let go of me! Let go!"
"Where's my new death eater?" says the hauntingly familar voice from across the room.
His hand shakes and he almost crumples up the whole paper. Instead he continues.
Neville laughs, "That's so conceited!"
Hannah gets his attention after many tries and asks him what was wrong, to which he replies with, "Nothing."
"Oh... Uh..." Blaise struggles to find another candidate. "Uh... May I ask a question?"
"But-"
He looks back at Luna and she looks at him with a smile, "Anyways, I wanted to say that I've told all the Ravenclaws that we aren't dating. I know, if you've heard the rumors, you know what everyone has been saying." She sighs, "Some people just are so quick to believe everything they hear. Shocking to know they call me the loony one." She jokes.
Dumbledore gives him a glance before saying, "Goyle will now be paired with Pansy. You must be partnered with whoever Miss Parkinson was originally paired with."
Blaise chuckles, "I could feel that as soon as you two passed me. I'm just glad we're in the same dorm again. Crabbe and Goyle were driving my last nerve away."
"We really do. You mean the world to us, Draco." Blaise says, giving him a warm smile.
There was only one time he spoke to someone, and that was Harry. But he declined his request to join them in the Gryffindor common room, even after he told him Blaise wanted him there.
"Are you alright?" Blaise whispers beside him.
Pansy's POV:
"I got a present today." He whispers.
"Is that all?" Blaise asks.
Blaise leans in and whispers, "You'll learn, my darling. I'll even teach you if you want," He chuckles and makes Neville's heart flutter. "But even if you weren't able to learn I still wouldn't care. I love it and I love you, so so much."
"But this person is in danger. Please, Luna." He pleads.
"I'll take an unbreakable vow if I have to," Draco smirks.
A weird thought entered his head. What if he grabbed his hand? No, that's weird. But he really wanted to.
He rushes back into the castle and kisses Blaise goodbye. Everything was perfectly fine... until he looked over and saw his grandmother standing right there. Both him and Blaise look at her in horror.
"I don't know if I believe that... I'm sure you're alright physically, though. I was told they fixed your injuries." Blaise says.
Moaning Myrtle screams, "How dare you?!"
"What are some things Neville might want for Christmas?" Blaise blurts out.
"Yeah. He tries to eat my snacks sometimes." Neville says softly and Blaise chuckles, making Neville smile softly.
"What do you want, Potter?" Draco asks.
Draco scoffs, "Of course, we can't hate little Neville."
He stumbled through the window and crashed onto his bed.
"Hi, Neville!" Someone's soft voice said behind him. He looked back to see Luna Lovegood smiling down at him.
"I saw that the other day when Draco had fallen asleep. Apparently it had gotten worse. Lucius had gotten angry with him because he had a mistake when speaking to the- to Voldemort." She says, tears falling from her eyes. "Draco, I'm sorry."
But Draco didn't hear a word. He was too busy eating. It wasn't until Harry was right in front of him that he felt his face burn. He carefully slurped up the soup in his mouth and politely wiped his mouth with the cloth he had been given and sat up straight.
"Personally, I don't think anyone spiked his drink," Blaise says, causing a confused look from Harry and a warning stare from Draco.
"Go away!" She demands.
"I already promised I wouldn't say anything. I'll even take an unbreakable vow," Blaise says, giving Draco a sincere look in the eyes.
Harry works as an Auror in the ministry and Draco works as a Potions teacher at Hogwarts. After people discovered Draco and Harry's relationship, many stopped supporting Harry, which made Draco insecure, but they both talked about it and they decided to not let it get to them and are now living happily together with their friends and family supporting them fully, unless it's Lucius of course.
He should stop thinking about it! Blaise wouldn't give that gift let alone be that kind and understanding. Especially since he has noticed no one at all speaking about the things he wrote down, which means this guy actually is genuine. Even if it isn't Blaise, he really should stop thinking about the things that were filling his mind. He doesn't even like boys! He likes girls. He liked Hannah, right?
"Yeah! I wanted to say-" She stops when the door to the library opens. He follows her gaze and sees Blaise Zabini and Draco Malfoy in the doorway. Blaise glares at them and Neville stares at the floor.
Draco's POV:
"Hi." He replies in the softest most childish voice ever. So much for acting all manly and scary.
He wanted it to fade, or even dissappear entirely, but it never did. Even if slicing up his arm didn't take it away, it sure made me feel better.
"Neville, Hannah is here!" His grandma shouts from the other room.
"But... I must ask... Why did you join us? Weren't you Malfoy's friend?" Ron asks.
Blaise lays down on the blanket, taking Neville with him. Neville makes a noise in shock, which makes Blaise chuckle at him. They clutch each other's warm hand and lay there in silence.
"Yeah, bye," Draco says with a small smile.
He was torn between finding Harry and telling him everything and just ignoring Pansy completely and trying to forget about what happened with Harry.
He takes a gentle bite of chicken and almost instantly cleans his face off and feels out of place.
"I mean, you kinda pushed me to tell you... So now you have to tell me." Draco smirks.
"Will you shut up?" Harry asks through his teeth.
Luna smiles at them both and stands up, "I'll be inside. You two need to talk." She dissappears into the house and they both look at each other.
"Hmm... Well, I'm sorry you don't feel at peace. But, this is very advanced magic. I can help you but I must do the enchantment myself. I do have a very easy task you can do to it, though. First, you coat it with a lavender scent. Muggles do this as well. Lavender is a very soothing herb and Muggles and Wizards alike use it as a means of calming the nerves and inducing sleep. However, we need to make it so the scent can never fade. I'm sure I can make that happen for you." Dumbledore promises, "Do you have this bracelet with you?"
"I'd like to say something!" Neville announces.
He noticed Blaise glancing over at the Gryffindor table and he also managed to notice how truly fidgety Neville was. He seemed to look around the great hall in anxiety. It really was a wonder to how he was in Gryffindor.
"I can't!"
"Will do. Just so long as it isn't anything that is dangerous." Luna says with a smile.
His Aunt's squeaky, manic laughter fills the tower. She twirls around the room, running to the railing and hold up her wand. She sends flashes of green light in the sky. He looks up, seeing the dark mark form in the clouds. Nothing but darkness fills the world around him.
"Alohamora!" Harry shouts. The lock breaks and Harry opens the door to reveal a distressed Draco.
"Go away, Myrtle!" He shouts.
Pansy looks down in defeat. "I mean at least it wasn't Longbottom." Goyle speaks up.
"Harry!" Lupin shouts, making Harry look up. "Why don't you come up here?" Draco rolls his eyes once again. Of course, Harry needs a moment of glory.
"We will keep a close eye on his diet." Luna promises.
"I'm sure he is just upset." Draco says.
He sends off the letter and shakes his leg nervously while waiting for another response. Then, the letter dropped into his lap.
Blaise sighs, "What about..." Crap, he can't ask that. "Snape's anger about the veritaserum being gone..." That sounded pretty lame.
He wishes he had some chocolate, or perhaps a treacle tart, to make him forget it all. But he didn't want to leave his room and come face to face with his grandmother. Not now, not ever again.
"I like you," Blaise states, looking into Neville's eyes with gentleness. A certain gentleness Neville never expected from any Slytherin.
"M-ma-maybe... Maybe we c-can co-convince him to come t-tomorrow." Neville stutters, his face turning warmer with each word he says.
"It's ok," Blaise says with a chuckle. His laugh was so nice.
"Uh... Nevermind." Blaise left without leaving a chance for anyone to say anything else.
He could feel the tears coming back, but held them back with a hard punch to his thigh. That managed to stop it. He took a deep breath and looked up to see Maggie standing in the doorway with sad eyes.
He notices Goyle give Blaise a glare and whisper something to him before crashing into his shoulder and walking away. Blaise makes no effort to react but instead looks at Neville with a warm smile.
"Neville?" Luna asks.
He can hear Harry chuckle softly beside him. He looks over and Harry whispers, "This happens a lot. It's pretty fun to watch, but not to be in I'm sure."
Blaise grabs Neville's hands and holds them in his own.
"That is no way to talk to your friend who was some key information for you." She smirks.
"Right..." Harry lets go, "Sorry... We have to get you to Madame Pomfrey, she can-"
She simply looks at them and pushes them away. "I don't want those."
"Sod off, Malfoy," Ron speaks up.
He couldn't help but stand there, his heart pounding in his chest. He's not scared of Harry Potter, is he? No, Malfoy's never do that. The image of his bright green eyes and smirk pop into his head. He should be disgusted, but honestly, he's not. I kinda wish he kissed me. What the hell?!
"Uh... Well... I-I uh, well..."
"I've told you no many times. Now leave me alone." Draco felt fed up with all of them. He could never stand them, but his father would be upset if he were to break off those friendships. Of course, it's only because that's how his father keeps up his prestige. Without those connections, his family would be nothing. His father reminds him every single year.
"You don't have to. Take it back downstairs, please." says Draco.
"We prepare to fight!" McGonagall shouts. Neville hears the door open behind him and looks back. "Any students who are under seventeen or are not willing to fight... leave now." She says seriously.
"Blaise! No need to sit, unless you want to of course. I only need to talk with you briefly." Dumbledore says.
"No!" Neville exclaims. He stares at the floor for a bit until his breath begins to grow louder and louder and faster and faster. Slow tears began streaming down his face.
"How does your husband treat Draco?" He asks and Draco's heart stops once again.
"Blaise Zabini? By the way, if all my guesses are wrong, then that will be the end of it. I don't get to guess anymore. That's the end of it."
The next day Neville sat in the library eating a pastry and drinking a tea. A Slytherin sat in the chair nearest to him.
"Draco-"
His mother sniffs, "He... Draco, show him your shoulder." Draco darts his eyes from his mother to the Auror. "Please."
However, they are both quickly stopped when Hermione comes through the door with a distraught Neville. His hair was a mess and the bags under his eyes were gray.
Snape turns back to them, his robes swishing in a theatrical way.
He turns the handle and is met with a very disorganized room. The same room he found almost a year ago. He smirks. Perfect.
"It's not Harry you dumb mud-blood!" Draco shouts. Myrtle gasps. A sudden crash is heard and water fills the bathroom. "Bloody hell!" Draco screams, running as fast as he can out of the bathroom, getting his robes and pants soaked in the process.
He suddenly had a thought. 'Us Wizards make new things all the time. It just depends on how powerful we are.' He smiles once more, 'I just have to make it calming.' Then, he frowns. How in the world does he do that?!
- Ron: Jack Russel Terrier (happiest memory: first time he kissed Hermione)
"Says the man who avoided the love of his life  for three years." Draco retorts.
"I think I know what you mean... but I don't want to assume anything." Blaise says.
"Yeah?" He heard Harry say.
"Yeah, Luna Lovegood! Apparently, some Gryffindors and Ravenclaws saw them together last night." Goyle informed. Draco couldn't help but feel sorry for Blaise. He looked over at him, expecting him to be absolutely torn up. I guess Draco had forgotten how great Slytherins were at hiding their true emotions.
"Great! Just don't forget to apologize first." Draco reminds.
"Expecto Patronum!" Draco shouts... Nothing. Nothing at all. He looks down, feeling shameful.
After being healed by Madam Pomfrey, Draco and Harry sat silently in front of Professor Dumbledore. "I am highly disappointed in you two," Dumbledore says calmly. Both boys stare at their shoes. Draco has always said he hated Dumbledore, but now sitting in front of him, he is a lot more intimidating than he thought. It's not that he's done anything to put that thought in Draco's head, he's just such a calm, collected old man, that it almost freaks Draco out. "I expected you two to be mature enough to get through this year together. You both had great potential to cooperate with each other at the very least. Especially you, Harry." Dumbledore says almost sadly.
"No, you didn't." Blaise gives him a smile, "Do... Uh... Do you have pl-plans today?" Blaise stutters.
Blaise scrambles to his feet and hands Neville the broom. He grabs the basket and throws it over his shoulder and gets onto his broom. He kicks off, hovering above the ground.
"I..." Draco began, "Don't think you can hold this over my head, Potter!" Draco spat.
It was cowardly to say the least, but let's be honest, we all expected it.
"Expecto Patronum!" Neville shouts, but instead of a Patronus, a big gust of wind shoots out of his wand, breaking a couple of glasses along with it and throwing papers all over the room. Quite a lot of students chuckle until Lupin tells them to stop.
"Are you alright?" Blaise asks softly.
"Bye, Draco." Harry smiles at him.
"What?"
Blaise gave her a death stare. It made Neville quite uncomfortable.
"Or he just said that to get into our home." Her father muttered.
"Boyfriend?" Harry asks with a small smirk on his face as well.
He hid his friends well and they were kept safe for a long time until Harry showed up. He led him into the room of requirement and Fred, George, and Neville himself all greeted him happily.
Neville looks at him suspiciously. Is this why Luna was asking for him? Did she somehow persuade him to join the good side or is he just here to trick them?
Blaise looks at Harry and Harry says, "Uh... Ok um... Oh, yeah! Hermione, Ron, and the other Weasley's make me the happiest. They're like my family. We can always talk and laugh together without judgement and George always is the light of the room... even without Fred... He can always turn on a light in the darkness. Ron and Hermione act like an old married couple." Harry chuckles, "It's hilarious. And Molly and Arthur are basically a mother and father to me at this point... Blaise?"
"Well... I'm not supposed to like this person." Draco says, blushing in embarrassment.
"Wingardium leviosa!" The person shouted. "You can get up now." They said softly.
Draco sits up and releases Harry. They both sit beside each other and Harry takes Draco's wand from his pocket.
He hesitantly lowers his button-up shirt from his shoulder and is shocked himself. He didn't realize it looked that bad. His shoulder was covered in black and blue and still ached.
"No." Draco says.
He ran over to him, "Draco?" He asked sympathetically. All Draco could do was stare at the wardrobe, just waiting for it to open back up. "Draco, look at me," Harry said, grabbing his face with both hands.
"Are you sure? I would've thought you were thinking about Pansy Parkinson." Harry teases.
Draco's eyes go wide and he raises his fist, punching Harry right in the mouth. "You're a pathetic excuse for a son." His father's words ring through his head and he punches Harry again and again. Harry soon gets enough strength to throw Malfoy off of him and charge towards him, fist balled up tightly.
Ron steps into view, "What in Merlin's name, Harry?!"
"If he's gone to Hogwarts, he had to have gone through here." Harry says. They all give him a took of curiousity, but he didn't care. He simply led the way to the secret entrance to Hogwarts.
"What?!" Harry shouts, staring at him as if he just told him he was the Queen of England.
- George: Magpie (happiest memory: used to be moments with Fred. He can no longer cast a patronus)
"Alright... I will make it easier for you." He draws his wand, but Draco acts fast.
"Of course! Good night, Neville!" Luna says with a bright smile.
"Pansy! She's trying to humiliate Nev!"
Draco turns his attention to the front, "Yeah..." Draco says softly.
"I was gonna say that... It was wrong for you to do that to Draco..." Blaise says quickly. "You should apologize."
They catch eyesight and Neville's nerves skyrocket. At this point, he would need that bracelet, according to the gift-giver. But there was no way he would risk being asked questions by his new girlfriend. Especially since he was planning on using every single gift in that box.
Draco's POV:
Xavier Brankwood handed Pansy her one hundred galleons after breakfast. "Pleasure doing business with you." She says.
"How awfully pitiful you look over there," Draco replied with a smirk.
Hannah looks slightly dissapointed but she still smiles. "Of course! I'd love to see how we would work out. Maybe this can also get those Slytherins off your back."
Harry stops right in front of them, "Please, I didn't mean-"
He ignored him and stomped inside the room. As Snape closed the door, he began shouting. "What the hell is this?!"
"What the hell?! Get out!" Draco shouts.
"It's not even that! Father didn't start hitting me until I was fourteen. I was mean to Harry and his friends because he didn't want to be my friend. I even bullied Weasley on his money status!" Draco says, running his hands through his hair in stress. Harry noted how soft his hair looked, even if it was incredibly messy at the moment.
His mother looks at the floor. "Lucius... he can be strict... Maybe too strict. I've tried to speak to him about it before but he doesn't listen to me and often gets angry when I bring it up." He never knew this.
"Stupify!" Harry shouts, sending his father flying backwards.
"Uh... Ok, what is it?"
"Well... From the book Hermione showed me-"
"I didn't know she was there!"
"Do you need me?" Blaise asks him and he nods. He sits next to him and asks, "What do you need, mate?"
"You got it!" Blaise smiles.
His father raises his hand and Draco flinches, but he's too late. His hand collides with Draco's face with a sting. He hit him so hard he nearly fell from the chair.
Draco steps closer and gasps. His childhood dream was right in front of him.
Draco didn't think his heartbeat could get wilder than this. He locks eyes with Harry and looks down at his lips. They look so soft. What would it feel like to kiss them?
A part of him just wanted to reach over, stroke his hair, then lean in and-
Suddenly Blaise stands up, asks Snape a question, then leaves the room. Neville simply shrugs it off until he notices that he doesn't come back at all.
His breath hitched. He's making it worse. He wanted him to stop, but he also didn't. He didn't understand a thing that was happening.
He tries to mix it again, but it's still too thick. Blaise sighs. "I keep messing up." He nearly whispers.
"H-how do you-"
"Well, he seemed strange. He was breathing really heavy and seemed really upset. I was worried he'd start convulsing." Blaise explains.
"No you wouldn't." Both Harry and Blaise say in chorus.
Blaise smirks, "Apparently my words had impact on him... I might be the one making him rebellious. He's met up with me for, like, five nights?" He chuckles, "As for the flying... I taught him."
Blaise's heartbeats wildly inside his chest. "Oh... I'm the one who won the affections of Neville Longbottom... The first one in fact if your letters are correct." Blaise smirks proudly at him, but only to tease him.
Blaise sighs and walks out. He turns toward Draco in the doorway and waves goodbye. Draco nods back then finally relaxes as Blaise steps out of sight.
Neville never knew someone could like boys. Well, he heard of it, but everyone said it wasn't actually possible. Simply something people choose. Did Blaise choose to like Draco? No, that wouldn't make sense, right? If he could choose, or anyone for that matter, he would've chosen to like Hannah Abbott so it didn't feel so weird around her. Or he'd choose to like Luna Lovegood so perhaps he'd have a chance of someone truly liking him and not lying about it. So, how did other people seemingly choose to like others? It just wouldn't make sense!
He looks up anxiously, "Yeah?"
"Oh..." Neville says nervously.
"Oh no." Blaise says, putting his head in his hands. "You and Harry weren't there today but... Snape asked to see Neville when we were all out of the classroom. He... well... he made the potion explode today."
"Goyle... He's..." He breathes out. Draco stares at the ground. He always thought of Goyle as an insufferable, idiotic git but now that he was gone... He just couldn't believe it.
"No, not yet. I'm feeling ok, though." He replies. Harry nods his head and glances at Blaise.
"But I really am tired and stressed!"
"I could ask you the same..." Harry responds.
"Oh, you don't know? That prat stepped into the Great Hall and said he was there to help them fight. For who? Mudbloods?!" Crabbe shouts. "We lose Goyle and now Blaise has gone mad?!"
"What's wrong with the one in your hand?" Harry asks him.
"You never know until you try! Oh, by the way we still have the lemon glaze. Let's get to it. Get the sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice." Hunter instructs. Blaise walks over to the cabinet and grabs the ingredients and lays them all on the counter in front of them. Suddenly a burning smell hit his nose. Oh no.
"They were actually so good!" Neville says happily.
Neville smiles softly, "Good evening."
"Th-thanks." He stutters.
Neville steps closer and says softly, "Uh... I have this person that wants to be my friend but has a bad reputation... He kinda frightens me... I want to be his friend too but I'm worried it's all a joke..."
"We apologize, Professor," Harry speaks up. 'We?!' Draco asks himself.
Draco squinted at Snape. "You mean to tell me... This is all a way to make things easier for me?"
Neville's POV:
"Or... You gave it to someone." Dumbledore smirks and stokes his long gray beard.
Draco sighs and does just that. What shocked him was that when he came back, Neville had somewhat calmed down. He was rocking back and forth as Hermione sang him a song. Harry notices him and rushes towards Draco and pulls him into the hall.
"How about-"
They all stood outside, a crying Hagrid holding a limp Harry in his arms. It can't be what he thinks.
"I could cheer you up, Draco... We could go on a date..." Pansy suggests happily.
"Hey... maybe we can both stay here for Christmas? We won't have to deal with our families and then you can relax." Blaise suggests.
"Merry Christmas Neville!
Madame Pomfrey speaks for him, "The tests for the love potions came back negative. I even did other tests, they were negative! Nothing to worry about here!" She says with a smile.
"Yet here we both are." Harry retorts. "Draco, drop the wand. I'm not going to attack you. Not again." He promises calmly.
"I'm sorry, Ginny. You're a great person and I really love you, but as my family. Listen, a lot is going on with me right now and I'm not even sure I understand my own brain. Something is wrong with me, terribly wrong and it's freaking me out. Even if I were to have feelings for you, the way I am right now would ruin it and you. I'm sorry if I broke your heart, I really don't mean to hurt you. I'd never want that, which is why I'm telling you the truth." Harry says.
Neville can't help but feel suspicious. Why would a Slytherin want to help him? Why would anyone want to help him? If anything, they'd just want a good laugh and a reason to use those jinxes they learned.
"Over there!" Blaise says, pointing to the right of them and tilting his broom ever so slightly that way and riding ahead of him. Neville follows him closely and notices him leaning his broom down. He looks ahead to see where Blaise is going and notices him getting closer and closer to a field of wildflowers colored purple, yellow, blue, and white.
"Well, the Yule ball is tomorrow and I was wondering if we could... maybe go together?" Ginny asks.
Why was he never normal? Why was he fantasizing about Blaise? Why did it get worse? Many questions fell through his head as pulled at his hair. He kept telling himself it would all go away tomorrow. Boy, was he wrong.
"Yeah, good job!" Dean smiles at Neville widely and he reaches across the wooden table and into the jar filled with red and white circular peppermints, grabbing one and popping it into his mouth.
"Nope." Harry says. Draco runs after him and Harry runs away. They run all around the bathroom and he notices Harry try to escape from the exit.
"Perhaps the Three Broomsticks?" Neville nods in response and they agree to go as soon as possible.
Just before he can call him, a squeaking noise comes from the ceiling. He looks up along with everyone else and notices an elf, a very familiar elf. Dobby stood right on the chandelier. Before anyone could act, the chandelier crashes to the ground. Draco jumps away, bumping into a chair and hurting his already injured shoulder.
"Various things... Mostly the war and moments with my father." Draco replies.
Blaise did the same thing as before and mixed on his own, smiling at the success of the dough this time. Without another word he slaps the dough on the cookie sheet like he did before, make the lemon glaze, and practically stalked the cookies in the oven. All while Hunter desperately tries to make conversation.
You may be wondering how same-sex couples in this book can create biological children. If not, you may be wondering now. So, the children can be created with magic. The process was developed in 2003 and couples Brian and Ned from America were the first to try it. It went successfully, so then more couples decided to do it as well. It isn't an mpreg situation at all, the children actually are born instantly, but are fully developed as if they very growing nine months inside of a mother. Many people are against it because they feel it's unnatural or that couple's do it without thinking, but many same-sex couples who want to have children this way have to go through classes to learn to how take care of a baby and see if they are willing to so that way no one makes any rash decisions. Harry's children were made this way as well as Blaise's child. Many same-sex couples, though, still choose to adopt or get a surrogate.
"Thank you, mystery man. I feel much better. I'm glad you talked to me because I was honestly worried you wouldn't. I'm just really scared that my mother will die soon as well, but I hope she doesn't. I'm also pretty scared for the future. I often forget it, but then I remember that he-who-must-not-be-named is back and maybe we will all die. Again, sorry to make everything so grim. I just wish things were normal. Also, if you don't mind, I want to know about your family. If it makes you uncomfortable, then you don't have to say anything. Again, thank you so much. P.S. I'm not brave at all, but thanks anyways."
Draco sniffs and Harry takes hold of his hands. "We'll always be here to support you when you need it, no matter what happens." Harry says.
"Really? Are you kidding me?" Lucius asks angrily. "I never once hit Narcissa and if I ever hit Draco it was because he needed it. He wouldn't listen any other way." Lucius says.
"I'll go right now. I'll make sure he's safe, ok?" Luna promises, closing her book and standing up to leave. Neville followers her but they seperate soon after. He notices her making her way to either the basement or the dungeons.
"I know it might make you feel better, but you're harming yourself! It's only a temporary release and it's a bad habit! It only leads to worse things... You can hurt yourself even worse and I don't want you to do that. I really do care about you and I've been worried sick!I know you're hurting, but there's better ways to deal with it. I'll even help you exercise better coping mechanisms. I'm here for you and I'll support you any way I can. But we need to get this sorted out before it gets any worse and you get addicted to it." Harry says.
"You alright?" Neville asks.
Draco then looks up at Blaise and shakes his head. Blaise looks at him in curiousity. He catches sight of Pansy who is smirking at him from afar.
"Now--Mr. Malfoy! Care to explain--Mr. Potter?! Oh, good grief! I demand to know why you two are late!" Professor McGonagall demands.
"You guys ready?" Hermione asks.
Harry watches him walk out and notices Professor McGonagall standing in the doorway, looking at him in dissapointment.
He catches glimpse of Blaise, who doesn't eat either, and instead continues to glance over at what Draco could only guess was the Gryffindor table.
"But-"
Neville slightly blushed, "Oh," He said. Even though the thought terrified him, it was slightly flattering to know that, if bargyles happened to exist, that they'd be all around him.
"I'm fine." Neville's voice cracks. "Uh... H-how are you?" He almost whispers.
"Well, I better get to class." Neville says, walking away from Hannah briskly. He can hear her protests, but decides not to listen.
Blaise's POV:
"It's alright. Just try again!" Luna says with a smile.
"They thought we were getting along and decided it was time to move us back." Harry replies without emotion.
It's been happening for weeks now and it's beginning to drive him crazy. Every now and then he'd think of Blaise, especially his clean clothes, flawless skin, and pearly white smile. It was hard not to have the image of him resting in your brain sometimes. But now, it was every second, of every minute, of every day. Sometimes it made his stomach feel queasy, but in an oddly comforting way. In all reality, it was just him being jealous of Blaise. He looked good in everything, had a polished look, and most likely was rich just like every Slytherin. He was also incredibly skilled at... well everything. However, he was the most intimidating boy in school, other than Gregory Goyle of course. However, while Gregory Goyle made him nervous as well, Goyle made him want to curl up into a ball far away in a corner and cry. Blaise, on the other hand, was somehow addicting. It was terrible to feel because it made his face warm and palms sweaty, but he wanted to be around him. People like Snape and Goyle drive him as far away from them as they can, but Blaise just can't do that. Something about him was incredibly interesting to Neville and made him come back for more. Little did he know, it was only a poison.
Neville simply laughs humorlessly. Somehow none of his fellow Gryffindors got the message but he was glad to see them rushing to their dorms and saying goodbye. Neville sighed in relief and laid his head on the table, grunting softly in dispair. Trevor jumped onto his back and croaked into Neville's ear.
Before Harry can finish, Draco rushes towards the door and leaves, slamming it violently behind him.
"I'm sorry. Hey, I got you some flowers! But... I was actually going to give them to you so you had something to give to Harry for Christmas." Blaise says with a bright smile.
Draco's POV:
"You're so disgusting!" Ginny says through giggles.
Neville's face burned and he felt that funny feeling again. The more he looked at Blaise, the more he glanced at his lips. Then the dreadful, but rather appealing, thoughts replayed in his head. He wanted to kiss Blaise, but why?
Blaise hesitates before asking, "Is that where all the... bruises come from? You aren't really falling?"
"Don't be a prat, Draco. Kill him." Goyle whispers beside him.
"Well... I live with my Aunt, my Uncle, and my cousin. They're all dreadful. My Aunt called me and my mother a freak for having magic and they would lock me in a cupboard under the stairs without food for weeks..."
"Nothing, mate. This happens to many people. We just need to get you professional help, that's all." Blaise says.
"Shut up!" Draco pushes him back, making Blaise giggle.
"We both know that... It's just a Gryffindor thing. Merlin, it's embarrassing that I like him." Draco mutters.
"Yes." Draco sobs.
"I can't! I can't move!" Draco shouts.
"Try me, darling." Blaise smirks.
He was so lost in his thoughts that he didn't notice the man stalking towards him until they grabbed his arm and pushed him into an empty classroom. He almost screamed, almost. But the person turned him around the face them, now he noticed it to be a familiar long-nosed man dressed in full black.
Maggie sighs, "Can you at least have a tiny piece?"
However, the event still rings inside his head and many tears fall from his eyes. He crosses his arms over his chest, feeling embarrassed.
Draco's POV:
"Yes. I'm assuming the matter is urgent?" says the boy.
"They're swarming you, you know," Luna informed.
"What do you mean?" Neville asks, "I'm the one who made it weird. I didn't mean for us to have the same patronus... I just... I don't know. I didn't think I felt anything that serious."
"So it's... Happy tears?" Harry asks.
"I never do." Wow, now you really humiliated yourself.
"Yes, I'm definitely sure!" Pansy replies.
"You can tell me, you know." Harry whispers. "You wanna talk about it somewhere else?"
"As for Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, the hearing continues. Now, Lucius Malfoy, I was given information that you have been violent at home with both Narcissa and Draco?" The judge asks him. The room seems to go even more silent than before.
He sighs and walks off. Why did he still feel so terrible? Hannah was nice to him and actually seemed to like him, at least he hoped so. He trusts far too much. Yet, even when someone expresses care for him he still feels nothing, nothing at all expect dispair.
"Fine, next time I'll make sure you deal with that boggart alone." Harry finished, stomping towards the bathroom, and slammed the door shut behind him.
"Merlin, thank you!" She sobs.
"No way!" Blaise shouts.
Draco shakes his head. Everyone's taking up for him and just accepting him, but for what? If anything, he was just as bad as his father. Not only that but he was weak. Everyone else put their lives on the line while he sat their and cowered in his little corner.
They pull away and Blaise pecks him on the cheek and holds him tight once again.
"You alright?" Harry asks.
Harry looked over at him, making him quickly redirect his eyes back to his book. The sight, however, still burned in his brain. What shocked him most what that it didn't repulse him one bit.
"Right. Anyways, he said you kissed really nicely and he likes you a lot but he's afraid to talk to you after it." Pansy says.
"That was strange..." Luna says before beginning her work on a plant just two feet away from her.
"He sits there and stares at you like you're some unicorn and keeps spacing out. And don't think I didn't notice how sad he looked when the word got around that you had a little thing for that revolting Malfoy. What did you do, hit him with a love potion?!" Hannah shouts.
Draco chuckles, "No thank you. I wouldn't want to see Ron blown up into a balloon."
"No, you aren't." Blaise grips him tightly. "I know that's who it is. You are painfully horrible at hiding it. Here I was thinking you were a true Slytherin, yet your secrets are easily given away. Though, I wouldn't say it's surprising now that I think about it..."
"Draco, what are you doing?" He asks him.
The person ran over to the wardrobe. He then could see that it was no one other than, once again, Harry Potter. Bloody hell! Does he ever leave?! He opened it up and pushed the boggart back into the wardrobe and shut it tight.
"Come on, Harry!" Hermione says, smiling at me as she walks out. Ron gives Draco a glare and follows after Hermione.
Xavier chuckles, "Right! How could I forget?! So, we heard about his little wishful admiration of you and we told him you told us you'd rather eat shit than be seen with him and how disgusted you were when we talked about him with you. You should've seen his face! I think he was about to cry." Xavier finishes shaking his head. "How could anyone so weak be in Gryffindor?"
"Not really. We were just baffled a little. By the way, why did you do that?"
"W-what are you going to do?" Neville asked fearfully. Last time someone dragged him somewhere, it was to hex him senseless.
"It's not bad to cry, you know," Myrtle says. "It's not bad that you like blokes either."
"Oh, shut up." Draco says with a small smirk. "It's strange, though..." He grabs Harry's hand gently, "We've hated each other's guts for years... Well, maybe not hated but we sure acted like it. And now here we are." He smiles.
"Yes! It's a date... I am asking you on a date." Blaise chuckles nervously and Neville can't help but smile. Seeing Blaise act as nervous as he does made him melt inside. He always thought of Blaise as this cool guy who never felt anxious and always walked around in elegance and poise. The more he's around him, the more he realizes that isn't the case, which only makes Blaise much more appealing. He let his guard down with Neville, and that meant much more to Neville than he'd ever be willing to admit.
"I know what you did Malfoy!" Harry shouts. "You cursed her, didn't you?"
"Yeah," He chuckles half-heartedly. He sure does hope it gets the Slytherins to stop saying he has a crush on Blaise. After all, it's just ridiculous. Although, all the rumors really are making him question things but he always has the peace of knowing that he really doesn't like Blaise at all. Especially after he tricked him.
"It's fine, at least Snape is consistent." Harry giggles at his comment.
"Expelliarmus!" A voice shouts. He looks up to see Ron Weasley, holding up a wand.
"I believe you, but that's not the full story, is it?" Hermione crossed her arms over her chest and gives Harry a stern look. When Harry doesn't reply, she rolls her eyes. "Fine, suffer alone!" She says, stomping up the steps towards the girls dorms, leaving Harry all alone in the common room. At times like these, he wishes he still had Sirius. Maybe then he would truly understand all of this. Maybe then he wouldn't feel so alone.
"Wait... That's why you took him out of the classroom the other day!" Draco observes.
He walks over to her, "Hi, Neville!" She says happily.
He sends the letter and another comes back.
"But they didn't help you?" Harry asks.
"Helping out Professor Sprout. She wanted me to get her some plants from the garden." Neville informs.
Dumbledore sighs, "I guess I must tell you a story. Sit here right here," He point to the seat in front of him and Blaise goes to sit in it. "Well, when I was your age there was this boy I knew. He was a student at Durmstrang, I was in Hogwarts. But we were very much alike. We became lovers very soon after meeting each other. I loved him, sometimes I still think of him... But terrible things happened between us. We fought each other, becoming enemies, and he showed his dark side. I was heartbroken." He stares at his desk with sad eyes, "But I can see that love in you. I notice how you look at him. The importance of that story is that there is nothing wrong with how you feel. It's completely normal. Love is a beautiful thing and you should be glad you can experience it."
"I suppose so. But they're pretty stupid." Draco says.
"Very well. The rest of you who refuse to fight or are too young, you may exit. Professor Slughorn will guide you." Professor McGonagall announces. Many children as well as the whole Slytherin house begin to file out.
"Thank you, Professor." Blaise smiles back and Dumbledore nods in response. He takes a deep breath and walks out the door.
He looks behind him, making sure Harry wasn't following him. Stupidly, he bumps into someone, making all their books fall from their hands.
"I... I was just leaving." Harry says nervously.
He looked over at the Slytherin table, noticing Blaise was gone. He could only help but wonder... Why was he searching for Blaise? Why did he care if he was there or not? It's not like Blaise, or any Slytherin at all, would care if he was there or not. But the need to search for him kept pestering his mind. He sighs and takes a bite of his toast and simply stares at the dark wood of the table. A sense of loneliness plagued him suddenly, however, he was quite used to that.
