Harry felt like someone had punched him in the gut. He knew that he and Draco weren’t married, not in a real, emotional way, anyway. He knew they weren’t even really friends. It made sense that his lifelong enemy wouldn’t want to discuss his dead mother, or the terrors he had experienced in prison. Harry had overstepped.
Draco could not move. He knew this with a deep certainty. He could not walk into the castle that had seen him at his worst, the castle that he had betrayed. But he could not go home, either, and spit in the face of such an opportunity. He was paralyzed as surely as if someone had cast a fully body-bind curse on him.
The words had lost their initial power under the wear of repeated readings. Still, Draco felt his breath hitch, his cheeks burning. The words themselves looked kindly on paper; in his father’s voice, he knew, they would sting with scorn.
“I heard what he was saying,” he said excitedly. “‘To the house of the lord.’ I think it’s the key that unlocks...whatever this is.” He waved a hand at the pavement before them, where Fairchild had disappeared. “Let’s go!”
Lucius’s claws withdrew as quickly as they had come. Draco slumped back in his chair, gasping for breath. His throat felt scraped raw; he realized he had been screaming. His eyes couldn’t seem to focus properly. By the time he could take in information once more, Lucius was back behind the desk, watching him with a thin, twisted smirk on his pale, pointed face. He was still stroking the jeweled egg.
“I mean, not that I don’t care about—this.” He waved his hand vaguely at Draco, and the other man nodded.
“Want to try that last bit again, Malfoy?” Ron asked, casually swinging his wand back and forth by his thigh. “Or are you ready to give up the girl and come with us quietly?”
They made small talk for another few minutes before excusing themselves and continuing to circulate, leaving Harold Rose scribbling away with an air of slight disappointment.
He wasn’t sure what prompted him to ask the next question—perhaps some small vestige of his former life, when things like this wouldn’t have happened. Or maybe the illusion that since he seemed to be important again, they couldn’t hurt him. “Is it possible for me to see Mr. Potter before the ceremony?”
“Because you don’t look like you’ll live long enough to go to trial,” Harry said quickly. “I don’t want you dying of starvation before we get all this sorted.”
“Of course,” she conceded briskly. “But do let me know. The new term begins in four weeks. That should give you plenty of time to prepare.”
Riley was standing next to them now. Draco looked up gratefully. “What happened? Is a healer on the way?”
Malfoy sneered down at Harry. “She doesn’t understand English but she’s not an idiot. You’re going to have to do better than that if you don’t want to put an end to this ridiculous story of old school chums.”
“You’re terrible,” he said. “I’ve changed my mind, I’m not moving in with you anymore, it’s never going to work—”
About a month in, Harry asked a question that had been niggling at him for weeks now. They were sharing a pizza that Harry had picked up from a place he liked near the Ministry. He was watching Malfoy pick off the black olives from the veggie slice he had taken – “They taste like salted death, Potter, and no you may
, it transformed into a giant cockroach playing the maracas, and Shaver herded it back into its box.
“That’s a nice idea, Minister,” Draco said quietly, eyes still fixed on the floor. “Why are you telling me?”
Draco was still standing behind the desk. He looked at his father’s body, crumpled on the carpet. He looked at Kingsley, staring back at him in confusion. He looked at Harry, and Harry saw his eyes suddenly glaze over.
“There,” he said, crossing to where Draco was still standing before the mirror and tousling his blond hair with one hand. “All better.”
He would, he assured himself, after the semester had ended. Right now, between final papers and assignments, he barely had time to sleep, let alone dispose of suspicious objects. Even though now he was fairly sure that Harry would hear him out before calling the Aurors. Maybe. Almost certainly. Draco took a deep breath. He was being foolish, and he wouldn’t put Harry in that position. He would wait until classes were done and he could get rid of the letters safely.
(Also, P.S., I hope you and your families and communities are safe and ok. Sending a lot of love to all y'all. Drink some water. Give yourself a hug.)
) and vague promises that they would be together again someday. “If you keep this letter, I’ll know that you still love me,” the last line said. “If you destroy it, I’ll know that you have lost whatever loyalty to your family you still harbored. My dear son, I do hope that you will not destroy it.”
By the time the carriage stopped at the door to the reception hall, Draco’s heart had slowed to its normal speed.
“You’ll be thrown in Azkaban and Viola will have no one,” she said, so softly that Harry and Malfoy both had to lean forward to hear. “You have your whole life ahead of you, Draco, and she does too. Please let me go knowing that you have each other.” Malfoy said nothing, but he squeezed his mother’s hand and bowed his head.
He was thinking that, in fact, when Kingsley entered. The tall man poked his head around the doorframe hesitantly, as if unsure of his welcome, but Draco gestured him in.
“Will foster her, yes,” Hermione replied, unfazed. “She’ll have a friend in Rose, we’ve got the space, and our status as war heroes can only help the case.” She paused for a moment as she seemed to realize to whom she was speaking. “That is, if it’s alright with you.”
“Except I am still that bloke,” Draco said quietly. “My past choices will always define me. I live with that.”
“Maybe he doesn’t want your help,” Neville said slowly. “Maybe he wants to feel like he can help himself.” He was silent for a moment. “Have you asked him what he wants? How he feels?”
He had stayed numb until Harry started asking questions. Starting talking about how he hadn’t known about any of this. About how he was on Draco’s team. Then, of course, Draco had thrown away any hope of ever being respected by this man – this man, whose opinion of him mattered more than anyone else’s, had always seemed to matter more – and cried on him, into him, all over him.
“Estoy cansada, chicos,” she announced to the room at large. “Voy a mi cuarto.” Then she was gone, and the three of them were alone.
Draco did shrink a bit at that. The goblin’s eyes on him were like chips of glass, but the banker was right. There was no way Harry would agree to that.
Draco was speaking quickly now, his desperate eyes fixed on Harry’s face. “Harry, I’m sorry, please believe that I wanted to tell you, I was going to tell you –”
The bathroom was empty. Draco shut the door behind him and waved his wand, muttering “Lumos” under his breath. The end of his wand flickered and sparked, but settled into a warm glow a moment later. Draco checked his reflection out of habit, and saw with relief that his make-up spell was still holding. He had taken to using it every day, but was always slightly concerned that it wouldn’t last the full day, especially with his wand behaving more and more erratically.
Draco’s face went even paler than usual, and his eyes widened as he went from looking furious to terrified in a single breath.
Immediately, everything came rushing back: his desire to have Draco’s attention; the disaster at the Three Broomsticks; his self-loathing. Harry grimaced.
In the end, though, it was unanimous: Draco would not be returning to Azkaban. He would be moving into a Ministry-approved apartment near Diagon Alley. He would be looking for a job — low-paying, likely, but a place to start. He would be checking in weekly with an Auror named Eliza Woods, whom Harry knew from training and who had become a fierce proponent of the whole idea. Best of all, Draco would get to visit Viola whenever he wanted, and could work toward officially adopting her as her primary caretaker after a year was up.
“I’m teasing you, Potter,” Malfoy interrupted, the flirtatious smile fading to be replaced by a look of deep exhaustion. “You know I’m a hopeless tease.” He closed his eyes and leaned back once more. “I’ll see you in two months.”
“I was thinking just you and me,” Harry said, trying to nonchalance. He wasn’t sure if he’d succeeded. Draco’s face flickered back to impassivity.
The owl flew off into the night, leaving Harry lost in thought. He headed back out to the kitchen, meaning to apologize for bringing up Narcissa in the first place, but Draco had moved to the couch and was perched on the edge, his eyes downcast.
“You’re going back to Hogwarts, eh young man?” he asked jovially, adjusting his wand slightly so that the green glowing tip was aimed right at Draco’s face. “How does it feel?”
Narcissa was pale and drawn in the next one too, but standing tall and straight before a judge who was muttering in Spanish. Miles was holding both her hands, looking delighted, and Draco stood behind her, his face an expressionless mask. Then Narcissa was bending over Malfoy, who was lying on the ground under a bridge, shivering and sweaty. A man’s voice, Miles: “Do you need any help, my dear?” And Narcissa looked around, her face lifting with terrible hope.
“Now do you know how to get them into the Pensieve, or did Dumbledore always do the tricky bits for you?” asked Malfoy acidly.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Shaver said softly. Slowly, Draco looked up. Shaver was holding out a hand to him, as if offering to help him up off the floor. Draco shook his head silently and stood up slowly on his own. Shaver watched placidly as he picked his wand up off the floor where it had fallen and walked back to the desk where his bag was still stowed.
“That husband of yours is a real chef!” he had exclaimed, and Harry had nodded, smiling, before catching a glimpse of Ron angrily leaving the room.
Draco Malfoy re-entered Hogwarts with his arms full of lilies-of-the-valley and leafy oak boughs. Beside him, Hagrid was grinning. Draco felt the old defensiveness flare, then dissipate. Tentatively, he smiled back.
Draco didn’t meet anyone else between the alcove and the dining hall. He was slightly taken aback to see Potter still talking to Hermione. It felt as if hours had passed since he left, although the candles on their table had burned down only slightly. As if his return was some sort of cue, Hermione gave Potter a quick hug across the table and turned to Draco with a hesitant smile.
When Hermione arrived, she found Draco cradling Harry’s head in the middle of their living room, his head bowed and his shaking hands covered in blood.
“Find your magic’s center, you know where it,” he said quietly and Draco, nearly against his will, did so. His magic curled, deep and quiet, in the pit of his stomach. As he touched it with his mind it perked up, like a dog hearing its master come through the door, but didn’t move. Without a wand to call it up and focus it, Draco was left feeling like a first-year again.
“That’s great,” he said honestly. “I…I would really like to go, I think.” He made sure that his hands were flat on his legs, instead of balled into anxious fists. “It would give me something to do, and maybe help me get a job. Eventually,” he added quickly. But Potter didn’t even bat an eyelash.
They helped him climb into the unfamiliar seat and watched as the coachman clucked to the horses. Draco supposed the Ministry employees would then Apparate to the grove – frankly, he was glad to see the last of them, with their sideways eyes and their scripted decency. Still, now that he was alone, there was nothing standing between him and the question still ringing in his head:
, Harry thought. Quidditch was safe. He launched into an overview of the best matches that had happened so far with a feeling of relief. Malfoy listened intently with a small smile on his face, periodically replying with prompts or comments. He even gasped at Harry’s play-by-play of the Hollyhead Harpies’ winning goal against the Lexington Lightnings, and shook his head appreciatively when it was done.
He felt Harry relax marginally beside him, and was glad that he had allowed his old social instincts to take over. Harry still hadn’t mentioned anything about wanting to go back to the Ministry, or any other job for that matter. Even if he had, Draco was fairly certain that he wouldn’t want it splashed across the front page of tomorrow’s
Torey was wearing Hermione’s thinking face. “We had to say something specific to get here,” she mused aloud. “Maybe we have to say something else to get where we need to go? Or do something?” She looked up at the dark Manor.
Malfoy, seeing him advance on Viola, tried to get up but fell back, breathing hard through his teeth and clutching his rib cage. Harry saw, with terrible clarity, that his face was covered with bruises.
Draco mounted the broomstick in one fluid motion, and was soaring across the grounds before his mind caught up with him. He felt his heart beating faster and was unsure if adrenaline or fear was driving him harder. The castle was getting nearer and nearer. It looked shockingly, heart-wrenchingly, the same.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Malfoy,” the Minister said crisply. “Warden tells me you have been a model prisoner.”
They walked quickly down the hall and up the stairs, Draco tugging on Harry’s hand to direct him to Lucius’s office. Harry was sure their feet must be visible beneath the cloak, but they didn’t pass anyone else.
He scooped a large helping of guacamole onto a chip and bit into it mutinously. His eyes seemed to be daring Harry to contradict him.
Draco found himself pacing furiously up and down the hallway, and finally hurled himself into the bedroom where he sprawled on the bed, parchment spread out around him, and examined the book list like a starving man seeing food. It was a generally innocuous list of reference books, spell books, and historical treatises, each accompanied by the course, or courses, for which it was required. He ran his finger down the list and found entries for Advanced Potions, Advanced Transfiguration, Advanced Charms, Ancient Studies, Arithmancy, and Defense Against the Dark Arts.
“Yes, you do,” Harry said loudly. He stepped back, staring at Draco. “Why are you letting everyone treat you like this? Why aren’t you standing up for yourself? Gods, the Malfoy I knew at Hogwarts wouldn’t ever let people walk all over him like this. He had some self-respect –”
Of course, he could not. That wasn’t how magic worked – and anyway, the Ministry would still be able to track him through the wand they had given him. He couldn’t get away. He couldn’t disappear. All he could do was breathe, and hope that his legs would obey his brain before anyone realized he had been gone for too long.
“Ron, it’s something I agreed to do because I thought it would help,” Harry said, a little desperately.
“Do you want to start cutting up some bananas?” Harry asked. When Malfoy nodded, he passed the other man three bananas, a knife, and a cutting board. They worked for a few moments, the silence broken only by the clip clip of Malfoy’s knife against the cutting board and the sound of Harry’s whisk against the mixing bowl.
“Here goes,” Harry said, taking a deep breath and walking towards it. He half expected to be whisked away immediately, but nothing happened: just Hermione and Luna watching him in confusion.
, do you understand? It’s over, and the whole point of this marriage is to help people realize that. If my own best friend can’t be bothered to give him a chance – to, to try to help make the peace we fought for –” Something else Ron had said finally sunk in. “And what do you mean, I have a ‘savior complex’?”
“After...after Christmas,” he said, his voice trailing off at the end. Behind Harry, Kingsley snorted inelegantly and Draco flinched again, although his eyes remained fixed on Harry.
“Because I always know what you’re going to say, Potter,” he said, sounding bored. There was nothing bored about his eyes, though, trained avidly on Harry’s lips.
She nodded quickly. “Everyone is fine, Harry. I just – have you seen this evening’s special issue of the
“Actually, Ron, I haven’t been talking about work or the news at meals much at all, these days,” he said quietly, realizing the truth of his words as he said them. “I don’t like to bring it up when Malf—when Draco is around.”
He would be arriving in a carriage, as would Potter, as scripted in the traditional wizarding wedding ceremony. When he had been declared presentable, the two employees who had taken him from Azkaban grasped his arms again and the three of them Apparated again, this time to a field where two winged horses grazed on the new spring grasses and a huge carriage sat waiting, looking more like a frosted wedding cake than a vehicle.
“It’s not for you,” Harry said grimly. “It’s for her. And for every child who’s ever been hurt by the people who were supposed to take care of them.”
Shaver was looking at him, along with everyone else in the class. Draco took a deep breath and prayed to every god he knew that his voice wouldn’t tremble.
Harry said nothing. What could he say? He sat in silence until Draco took a deep, gasping breath and looked up, glaring at him through puffy eyes.
“And now, I would like to know who I will be teaching in this prestigious Advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts class.” Shaver spun to face them all again, beaming. “When I point to you, please tell me your name, your class year, and one thing you hope to learn from me this year.”
Harry crouched down so that he was eye-level with Malfoy, back in the gloom of the corner. “Why didn’t you tell me?” he asked softly.
“No, that was all Draco,” he said, glancing at the other man proudly. Draco ducked his head, a flush rising up his pale cheeks.
“How to defend myself, sir,” he said finally, feeling a small surge of satisfaction at the barely-perceptible widening of the other man’s eyes.
Harry was still yawning as he stepped out of the Floo portal the next day, his eyes bleary from lack of sleep. He and Draco hadn’t spoken much after their afternoon excursion had turned into a full evening of wrangling bureaucracy. Dinner had been quick and silent, although the silence had been unexpectedly comfortable. He was getting very used to co-existing peacefully with Draco Malfoy, Harry reflected. In fact, things had only started to deteriorate once he and Draco had said their good-nights.
As soon they mounted up, Draco realized that Potter, for all his famed talents at battling evil wizards and defeating the Dark Arts, was a terrible horseback rider. Draco hadn’t doubted that the other man had never ridden, but he was unprepared for Potter’s utter and complete lack of either bodily coordination or the ability to follow shouted instructions. They must have made a comical pair, Draco reflected: he and Lady circling Potter and Lancelot, with him giving tips and instructions and Potter doing nearly the exact opposite.
“In the names of the Old Ones and the Grove’s Kin, we welcome you here today…” Harry let the words of the rites wash over him. After a few moments, Hermione nudged him and he took both of Malfoy’s hands, as the ritual dictated. Looking back, most of the ceremony was a blur of sing-song words and organ music and vows said half wonderingly and half haltingly before the final spell of binding, but Malfoy’s cool hands in his seemed to be burning themselves into Harry’s memory.
“Me too,” Harry said as he clenched and unclenched his fists. “Ministry employees, dementors, and Malfoy Manor. This can’t be good.”
“Draco,” he said quietly, and Draco’s head snapped up, his eyes widening. He stared at Harry for a long moment. Then he began to laugh.
“Could you keep the reporters off me for a few minutes?” he asked Hermione quickly. “I’d rather be able to talk to Kingsley without our conversation ending up in tomorrow’s
he thought firmly as he packed up his things at the end of the day. He would contact Ron when he had a chance, ask if they could sit down and hash things out. Hermione would probably also have thoughts, he reflected as he cast a medium-level locking spell on his office door and headed toward the Ministry Floo deck. She usually did.
“I guess you can take care of yourself, Mr. Potter,” the other Auror said jovially. “We’ll see you there then.” The two of them moved off, toward the grass where the woman still lay. Harry grabbed Malfoy’s hand again and walked, perhaps a bit more briskly than was necessary, the rest of the way to the carriage.
Draco nodded, but Riley was already making his way back behind his desk. Draco could almost feel Potter’s eyes burning into his back, and concentrated on not turning around. He did not want to see what Potter thought about an old man complimenting Narcissa Malfoy without so much as looking at the great Harry Potter.
Short one today, folks, but we're getting there! Our boys are hurting, but Harry is starting to realize how much of an idiot he's been. See y'all tomorrow!
The emergency portkey deposited them on a hillside overlooking a vast swath of Spanish countryside. Madrid was visible on the horizon as a hazy collection of tall buildings, but the land that swept away from their feet was rolling and open. About half a mile away, a small, slightly derelict farmhouse nestled between a field of hay and a large garden. Two thin horses grazed in a pasture that extended along the front of a wooden barn set behind the house. There was no other movement.
Malfoy had been returned to his cell before the verdict was read, and Harry stopped briefly in his office to pick up a bottle of champagne a grateful citizen had given him at some point. He didn’t think too hard about it – he was grinning from ear to ear, thrilled that Viola would be safe from Miles, and eager to tell Malfoy they had won.
“I have it?” Harry finally burst out. Draco flinched back slightly and finally met his eyes. The other man’s grey eyes were terrified.
Coming closer to the house, Harry saw that parts of it were even more dilapidated than it had appeared from the hillside, but other parts seemed brand new: a shining metal roof; a new coat of white paint. Flowers were blooming in pots on a dingy concrete stoop, and there were faded purple curtains in all the clear, clean windows. Ron nudged Harry and pointed to the wires connecting to a stand on the roof.
Fortunately, McGonagall seemed to understand. Her eyes, as she squeezed his hand, were kind. “It was an honor, and my sincere pleasure,” she said firmly. Then, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, she continued, “And of course, we would love to have you back at Hogwarts for your final year.”
Malfoy, by this point, was looking distinctly the worse for wear. Harry wondered what they were feeding him – his cheeks had hollowed and there were dark circles under his eyes that suggested he had not been sleeping well. Then Harry realized that Malfoy was likely eating and sleeping less so he looked even more pitiful and pitiable before the judge, and wanted to kick himself for falling for the other man’s tricks.
“You’re going with Mr. Weasley,” he said firmly in English. “You’re going to get to make some new friends tonight, and I know you’ll be good and polite and strong. Yes?”
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy,” he said smoothly. “Perhaps you would care to explain why you have been corresponding with a convicted criminal and hiding his responses in your closet?”
He let himself out of the phone room and wandered back to his desk, busying himself by tidying up and filling in unfinished paperwork until a silver raven patronus flew over and perched on a dirty coffee mug.
“Only because I am,” Draco countered, his voice lowering. “And I think you’ve made your feelings about me and my choices very clear over the years. No need to reopen old wounds.”
Images of Malfoy Manor from the front of the Daily Prophet filled Harry’s head: the roof collapsing in, the manor aflame. It had been looted before anyone from the Ministry could restore order after the Dark Lord’s fall, and some particularly enthusiastic celebrant had set off fireworks in the main hall.
He left Elias and Malfoy talking in low voices, with a promise to return to show Elias out when he was finished. Then he contacted Miles.
Luckily, no one did, and he entered the classroom feeling marginally calmer. The calmness evaporated, however, when he saw the man sitting behind the desk.
A lot of people stared at him on the way up to the Auror offices, with Ritchie floating, unconscious, beside him. Harry glared at them all until they looked away.
“I’m coming!” Pansy shrieked, skidding along the wooden floor in her sheer stockings. She was a vision in a long, pale cream dress. He laughed when he saw her.
“Alright? It’s fantastic,” Malfoy replied, sounding dazed. “I don’t know how – I doubt I’ll ever be able to repay you for this.”
And a small, pale boy also being fitted with robes had smugly asked him if his parents were “our kind.”
He never knew, for example, how he had gotten from his position lying among formerly-Imperiused wizards to kneeling beside Draco’s fallen form. Suddenly, he was just there, cradling Draco’s head in his lap and snarling “Stay away” when anyone tried to get too close. When the Healers arrived, he remembered Hermione leading him away. Ron, Neville, and Ginny crowded around him, and Luna held his hand as they watched a Healer examine Draco, her brow furrowing. Everything else – the dozens of wizards coming out from under the Imperius curse, Kingsley conferring with Hermione in low voices, Aurors dealing with Lucius – all of that happened in the background, slightly blurry to Harry’s mind.
He realized he was crying, but he brushed the tears roughly aside and pulled out his wand. “Stupefy!”
Harry looked at him, flabbergasted. “You didn’t go to your own mother’s funeral?” When Draco didn’t reply, Harry pressed on. “I mean, I know you were in Azkaban, but they must have at least let you watch, maybe through a portal or something…?” An uncomfortable thought occurred to him. “Unless you didn’t want to go…”
“Actually, it means I want to end this,” Draco shot back, and threw the jeweled egg to the ground. It smashed into hundreds of tiny pieces with a hollow
“No, you’re not,” Harry said, annoyance rising. “And I’m going to prove it to you. We’re getting out of here. Together.”
Harry had told Draco he was on his side. Had told him that he didn’t have to worry because he was safe now: safe from dark wizards, safe from Azkaban.
–” Weasley’s breath was coming fast now, his face growing even redder beneath his auburn hair. “I will hunt you to the ends of the earth, Malfoy, and I will make you wish you were back in Azkaban. No one will protect you, no one will stand up for you, and I will not let you die until I have made you pay. Do. You. Understand.”
“I’m not going to fight you,” he said carefully. “Although I could. I know this place, this language, this land better than you. You would catch us in the end but I would make it very, very difficult for you. And you would have to obliviate a lot of Muggles. A lot of Muggles,” he repeated, staring into Harry’s eyes.
Severus Snape was standing before him, shaking his head and muttering to himself. Draco had a fleeting moment of confusion and looked around. Was the boggart seeing someone else? Shaver seemed thrown off as well. He looked back and forth between Draco and the boggart, and moved to stand.
“Yes,” the first voice agreed, sounding hesitant. “You know his lordship has his own plans, though. They may not make sense to us, but they must be in our best interest.”
“Well, because you’re my husband,” Harry answered slowly, seeming to think deeply about the answer. “And because I can tell you’ve changed. You’re out of Azkaban, this marriage saw to that. Why should you keep being punished?”
For now, they were moving in together, and that was more than enough. It had been four years since their divorce, and all was very, very well.
“And why should I believe you, when you’ve been lying to me for months?” Harry stepped closer. Draco tried to step back again, but he was up against the wall, there was nowhere for him to go. Harry felt a manic joy gleam in his eyes.
“On par with joining a terrorist organization when you were sixteen because your daddy told you to?” Ron cut in. Draco’s shoulders tensed.
“Yes, ma’am,” Draco responded quietly, following her towards the back where mirrors lined the walls. Harry perused the shelves, not wanting to intrude as the magical tape measure flitted back and forth and Madam Malkin wrote quick notes in a ledger. Before long, Draco was walking back toward him, hands full of a paper-covered bundle, and Madam Malkin was beaming from behind the counter.
“Oh, here –” Harry passed him the pages he was still carrying. He started to ask Kinglsey a question, but noticed that the Minister of Magic was watching Draco intently as the other man scanned the page. Harry, turning back to Draco as well, noticed that the other man’s face had gone even paler.
“It may well be,” Kingsley responded slowly. “At the very least, you would return to serve out the remainder of your sentence here. Another forty-six years, Mr. Malfoy. You would not be a free man again until you were sixty-eight.”
At the same time, Harry drew his wand and pointed it at Lucius, who was watching the mayhem with a kind of detached amusement.
He was making up for it now. As he and Ron began investigations into the Viola Hathaway missing child case, Harry found himself thinking about Malfoy quite a bit: where he could possibly be, what he had been doing for the past six years, why he had kidnapped this girl. What he was like now.
Draco read it again, hardly daring to believe it wasn’t some elaborate, cruel joke. He didn’t think that Minerva McGonagall was the elaborate prank type, but becoming a student again seemed equally implausible.
“Forgive me if I don’t have the same blind faith in Granger as you do.” Malfoy shook his head. “Even if it’s not Azkaban, it’ll be back in exile, unable to see or be near any magic users ever again –” He broke off. Harry realized he was trembling.
, she had laughed. Wondering whether his new husband’s silence was disappointment or disdain, Harry couldn’t help but wonder also what kind of an entrance they would make.
Malfoy was regarding him with what seemed to be apprehension. Harry snapped his mouth shut. “Sorry,” he said sheepishly. “I’m just impressed whenever anyone looks like a human being before noon on a Sunday.”
“I think the state was paying him some kind of child support,” Malfoy replied. “At least, I remember him getting checks in the mail sometimes, getting all gleeful and talking about going to the bank. If I had to guess, I’d say that someone finally figured out Viola was gone and stopped sending him that money. That explains why he’s so desperate. He could never hold onto money.”
“That’s it, then,” Ron sighed, flopping down on a chair by Harry’s desk several weeks later. “The last lead. Nothing.”
Harry reached for one of Draco’s hands and grasped it. Draco squeezed back, but would not look at him. “Thank you, Minister,” he said. “I will let you know if I want updates, but I’m feeling quite tired now, if you wouldn’t mind...?”
“I’m safe,” Draco whispered, as he had nearly every day since the marriage, and the writing disappeared, replaced by more words in an achingly familiar script.
Draco fought to keep his own back straight, instead of shrinking down under the weight of the goblin’s accusing glare. But Bogrod nodded icily.
“That’s Alanna Cowl,” she whispered. “She’s a Ministry employee, I recognize her from all the Death Eater hearings after the war. Muggle Relations.”
He watched helplessly as his own wand flew across the room to land in Lucius’s other hand. It was now pointing directly at Torey/Hermione’s chest.
“Thank you, Potter, you can go now,” he said, with an air of finality. Harry felt as if he was being dismissed, and fought a sudden urge to chuckle.
Then he pulled out his wand and set the parchment on fire: one of the few spells, fortunately, that he could do with any kind of dependability. He watched it burn, levitating it in front of him as the flames licked at the corners. In just a few moments, it was nothing but a pile of ash on the floor at his feet, which he hastily Disappeared.
“Not if I have anything to say about it,” Harry shot back. He grabbed Draco’s hand again. “Stay close.”
Three weeks to the day since Draco had been taken away, Harry looked blearily around their flat. In many ways, little had changed since that night: Draco’s parchments still covered the desk by the window; the mug that Draco especially liked was still sitting where he had left it the morning before the party. His clothes still lined the closet in the bedroom. His towel still hung in the bathroom.
do, even though you hate me. You could be here, because you’re you. But you can’t be here, because I’m me. It’s me. I’m not –” He gulped. Tried again. “I’m beyond saving.”
It became a sort of routine, to Harry’s surprise. Harry chuckled to himself, bemused, when he found himself heading down to the basement for a second time that week, and Malfoy looked positively aghast when he appeared again at the cell door, this time holding out a Tupperware bowl of leftover lasagna.
Harry looked up. Draco was watching him closely. “Oh?” he said, trying to school his expression into neutrality. “What did she want?”
“I fucked up, Hermione,” he said slowly. “I don’t know if he’ll forgive me, but I have to try to make it right.” He took a deep breath, knowing this was a lot to ask, knowing that he needed to ask it anyway.  “Will you help me?”
“Would it mean he could withdraw money at any time, without my permission or presence?” Harry asked, cutting the goblin off.
“It’s not an intern,” Harry said, reading the memo and feeling something like excitement blossom in his gut. “Ron – Ron!” He quickly passed the other man the piece of paper, his hands actually shaking.
Draco didn’t wait to be told twice. With a whoop that his former self in Azkaban wouldn’t even have recognized as his own, he urged Lady into a trot, then a canter. Her gait was as smooth as he remembered – it felt like they were skimming over the grass. Except that this was better, somehow, than skimming over the grass on a broomstick. He had loved flying, and probably still would, he reflected, if he ever got on a broomstick again. But riding a horse was something else entirely. It was connection, it was confidence, it was a radiance that had nothing to do with flying and everything to do with moving in tandem with another being, bodies joined and flowing. It was pretending, anyway, that you had some kind of presence in the world. That your body was your own, and no one else’s.
Draco froze. His entire body seemed to tense, like the air right before a storm. Harry didn’t know what to say, so he didn’t say anything. He just held him, for long moments.
Draco nodded seriously. He knew all of this. It was still thrilling to hear his father speak again, to be in the same room with him without the shadow of Voldemort hanging over them.
“No updates,” Harry said, not answering the first question. He held out his extra sandwich, wrapped in clear plastic. “Do you want a sandwich? It’s ham,” he added when Malfoy didn’t move. “I made extra by mistake.”
As they emerged into the fading light of evening in Diagon Alley, Draco was still turning Harry’s words over and over in his head. He watched Potter out of the corner of his eye. The other man seemed so sure that Draco had changed.
“She’s not here,” interjected Malfoy quickly, raising both hands. “I actually haven’t seen her in months, couldn’t tell you where she is at this point —”
“No!” Harry did laugh now as the weight of their misunderstandings came crashing down on him. “Gods, we’ve been so blind, haven’t we! I’ve been so blind.”
Draco’s eyes widened and he went very still. Words seemed to die on his lips. Harry wanted to die on those lips.
But Harry Potter knew how to get what he wanted. Draco watched in mute amazement as the Savior of the Wizarding World appeared behind Harry’s eyes. He had seen how the smaller man drew back from the limelight – had even seen, surprisingly, that Potter seemed disinclined to use his fame for his own benefit (something that a younger Draco Malfoy would never have believed). But several goblins and three offices later, Draco had to concede that Harry Potter did, in fact, know how to leverage the power he had earned while fighting Voldemort. And he was leveraging that power for none other than Draco himself.
“If you insist.” Harry followed Malfoy to the piano. He stood awkwardly as Malfoy leafed through his papers. “My sheet music,” he explained. “I’ll play a common one. It’s hard, but I like it. Very popular with muggles. It’s from a man called Beethoven.”
“Harry Potter? Wait, what’s going on here?” The girl was stuttering and trying not to laugh at the sight. Harry could sense Malfoy’s panic in the air like radiation. He knew he had to think fast. Harry isn’t the brightest bulb, but he knew one thing Malfoy always did.
“Look, Potter. You’re really the last person I want to spend my day with, and that’s because you stress me the hell out. Especially right now.” Harry was taken aback.
“Well, I suppose I should thank you for making sure I didn’t get caught; but I won’t, because you didn’t,” he yawned, waiting for Potter to walk away so he could enter the common room. When he didn’t, and just gave a puzzled look, he found this boy was quite more irritating than he had ever thought. “What is it?”
“He walked in on me playing. I guess he wasn’t expecting me to be so well, after all. Can you imagine, him thinking he’s the only one with talent?” he smirked, working up a laugh. Neither of them joined in. “What?” he said exasperatedly.
“Figure it out, and I will, too.” Harry really had nothing to say. It seemed to him like Malfoy was seriously stressed out, which kind of made sense. He was also pretty stressed, but very, very tired.
“If that’s what you want to call it,” someone said. Dean quickly removed his arm from Seamus’ shoulder, blushing and laughing uncomfortably.
“Maybe,” he guessed. That was all he said, but Harry didn’t really care. If that were to happen, they would have to go to the hospital wing and get it fixed immediately, which was fine with him.
‘I’ll sign it as well. I’ve been dying to learn how to play the flute.’ Two small X’s accompanied Hermione’s neat handwriting under Ron’s large smiley face. Oh well, at least they weren’t in trouble for not paying attention.
“Wait a moment, did you say we are going to be paired together?” Malfoy stood up, pointing to Harry. “As in, we’ve got to practice and perform and be together?” He stood taller, and his voice became louder as well. Their professor smiled and nodded at Malfoy, not understanding the obvious cues that Malfoy was about to lose his cool. Harry figured he didn’t need to be involved in this and sat silently, trying to lower his violin into his case without catching anybody’s attention.
“What? Oh God, I’ve been screwing around in that class,” he muttered. “I don’t even know how to hold the violin properly! I’ll look like a fool. I’ll hex myself and say someone else did it so I don’t have to perform. No, too risky.” Ron ran his hands through his hair in distress while Harry laughed.
“I think I’ll learn the piano,” he said, suddenly remembering that his grandmother, Druella, played it. Surely his father would be proud he wanted to take after her, a prideful member of the family. Draco grabbed a quill and began writing.
“The prodigy?” Harry was confused as to how he earned that name, considering when he played the violin he sounded suspiciously like metal scraping loudly together.
“What do you think you’re doing?” Draco asked, walked up to him. Potter turned around quickly, seeming scared to see Draco there.
“Look, I don’t know any more than you do. Snape probably knows. I should go ask him,” Malfoy said to himself.
“Malfoy, come on. You know you hate this situation even more than I do. There’s no way you’d stay sane living at my home, nor would you ever be comfortable enough to stay any longer in Gryffindor robes.” Harry waited for Malfoy’s response, which took a lot longer than he’d expected.
“Forget about that,” she hissed. Draco decided to avoid the situation entirely by pointing out that the potion should have been a dark, forest green when in fact it was a much lighter shade of green. Pansy peered into the cauldron and made a look of regret. “I think I might have forgotten to add the chopped up ginger roots.” Draco only sighed and ordered her to discreetly pour out the cauldron into the sinks at the back of the classroom before he grabbed extra ingredients from the cabinet. The rest of the class went on as Draco finished the potion quickly, with no help from Pansy, and then working on an essay for Transfiguration. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco could see Potter all too purposefully not staring at him and messing up his own potion. He could also see Granger trying to whisper to them what the correct order of ingredients were but they clearly could not listen for more than five seconds because Weasley took the whole chopping board and dumped it into the cauldron, which was about the time when Draco turned away and focused on the writing etched into the table, talking about how horrible Snape was. Draco couldn’t care less about that at that time.
“So then why are you so tense around him? And you guys share this look,” Pansy and Blaise looked at each other, seeming to mock Draco and Potter.
“Before I walked in here, all I heard was the beautiful sounds of a piano and a violin intertwining perfectly to create perfection. You did it before, I would love it if you two could do it again for the sake of showing the rest of the school these classes aren’t a waste of your time here at Hogwarts. Try it out, and if after a couple weeks you still don’t think it will work, I’ll adjust the pairs to accommodate you both.”
“Heroic Harry Potter, now going to play a musical instrument on Monday. Good luck. I bet whatever you chose to play, it’ll be almost as horrible as your Quidditch playing,” Draco said, holding his chin high. Potter just gave him an annoyed look before turning away to walk down the stairs. Draco desperately did not want to follow him, but he had no choice. Potter chose to ignore Draco’s snide comments as they strode down the hallway. He nearly ran into the boy when Potter stopped dead in his tracks.
‘Unless they’re not. Tell you what; if you sign it, I’ll sign it. We’ll learn the same instrument and just have a free period during that class or whatever.’ Ron finished the note with a large smiley face so Harry couldn’t write anything else and gave him a small grin. It was then that Hermione turned around and gave them a glare, probably hearing Ron fold the paper. She held out her hand expectantly and Harry and Ron shared a look before giving it up. There wasn’t really anything to hide after all, right? Hermione read for a few moments before turning back around and sliding the paper under Harry’s book, a happy look on her face.
Slowly, others were approved to drink their own potions, and chatter occurred throughout the room. Harry glanced over to the other side where Draco was sitting poise as ever, but differently. He realized that he and Blaise Zabini had switched their bodies and refused to be seen amazed. Blaise, or Draco in this case, did seem to be looking Draco, or Blaise, up and down. However.
“Right. That was odd,” Harry said to himself. He looked baffled before continuing down the hall where everyone was eating dinner.
“I just saved us from getting caught, no need to thank me, Malfoy.” He rolled his eyes and began to turn away, when Malfoy gripped his arm again. “Will you stop doing that?!”
“No, that sounds right. But then we still don’t know how long this will take. Or if that’s even true, is there an antidote? Maybe we just take the potions again...” Harry said. Malfoy opened another book and began sifting through the pages.
“I can be where I like,” Potter muttered, stepping down another step and trying to slip past Draco. He made it down a step below him before Draco gripped Potter’s shoulder, forcing him to pay attention.
“Uh, Ron? That answer’s wrong, you have to cut the dragon scales into halves, not crush them into powder. Otherwise, you’d technically be making.. A bomb, I suppose.” Hermione looked puzzled at that, and began writing something down while Ron scratched out his answer in exasperation. Harry watched as Leo began walking around Gryffindor table, asking for signatures. He noted that Neville Longbottom wrote his name down, as well as Dean and Seamus, but when Lavender Brown was asked, she turned her nose up at him (she explained she had better things to do with her time, like flirt with boys and make up her own spells to make lasting makeup).
“What? How do I stress you out? I’m trying to find out how to fix this, just like you. And where did that even come from?”
“About ten minutes after switching bodies, you’ll feel the same headache recur. Then you’ll know you’re switching back. It’s important to remember as always to try not to recreate potions outside of this specific classroom, as these are very dangerous. You’re lucky you get to try the potions, let alone make them, so don’t mess it up for everybody else if you get caught,” Snape drawled. Perfectly on time, Harry began to feel a tense headache, and sat down waiting for him to return to his own body. After a few short seconds, his muscles relaxed and he was back to normal, as was Ron.
“Does that mean you signed it, too?” Draco said, trying to sound rude. He couldn’t stop thinking, however, about having music lessons with Harry Potter. His life was about to get an hour every Monday worse.
“They could be doing their best,” he muttered, then regretted it. That is definitely not something Draco Malfoy would say. The surrounding Slytherins who heard him stared.
“What are you doing?” Draco said, giving Potter a shove. “Don’t you know how to walk?” Potter shushed him, and Draco decided on what hex to use on him before Potter spoke again.
“Yes, Potter?” Professor Snape’s voice rang through the silence of the classroom. Potter stood up and walked over to the professor. “You wish to use the restroom?” Potter nodded, and Snape looked him up and down. “Fine.” As soon as the door closed behind him, Draco felt uneasy. Finally making the decision to stand up, he asked to use the restroom as well. Pansy gave him a startled look before he stumbled out of the classroom. He went to the nearest bathroom and found Potter there looking into the mirror.
“Well,” Harry started. Malfoy’s shoulders tensed, and he looked up as if finally realizing exactly who was in the room with him.
“I can’t believe we basically just signed up to learn how to play musical instruments,” Ron said. “It’s kind of ridiculous. I mean, I can expect it from Hermione; but you and I, Harry?” Harry shrugged, and Hermione elbowed Ron slightly, before peering over his paper.
“Would you like to show me?” he said, surprising both Malfoy and himself. “I mean, since it’s so great and all,” he challenged. Malfoy stood for a while, but then turned around and walked towards the piano.
“Yes, what is it?” Harry said. He noted the loose tie that bore the Hufflepuff colors hanging around the young boy’s neck. Harry tapped his foot impatiently as the boy searched for words in the sky.
Once others around him woke up and began their morning routine, Harry also “woke up,” sitting in bed and realizing he didn’t know exactly what the morning routine would be like. How does Malfoy get ready? How long does he spend in the mirror perfecting his hair and robes? Will he be suspicious if he does something out of the norm? Harry settled to pretend he was too tired to get up until most of the Slytherins had left, and then attempt to style hair. Midway through, Harry realized he literally did not know why he was bothering with this when his mission was to go straight to Ron and Hermione and ask them for help. Surely then he wouldn’t need to be hiding this from anyone. The professors would help him out of this mess. Right?
“We’re only three minutes away from class. Care to explain the situation to me again?” She crossed her arms over her chest and waited while Draco groaned.
“Alright. We can head back to bed if you like. I’ll stay up with you till you’re asleep, yeah?” Inside of Harry’s mind, he was cursing. But on the outside, he just nodded and stood up with Blaise. He let Harry lead, which wasn’t a good idea because he couldn’t remember which way they came from, but eventually they ended up back in bed. Now that Harry knew the situation he was in, he didn’t think there was a way to go back to sleep, so he tried to decide if Malfoy snored or not, and if he tossed and turned in his sleep. He settled for turning his back from Blaise and just breathing deeply until he was satisfied and went to sleep.
“You know, Hermione would know what to do,” Harry mentioned. Malfoy sighed and slightly shook his head.
Harry immediately knew what he’d done was a mistake. He was mortified at the sight of what Malfoy looked like. He truly wished he could go back in time to thirty seconds ago when none of this had happened. He’d much rather be in Malfoy’s normal, weird, body. But now he saw what appeared to be himself, but with pale blond hair and boring grey eyes. Malfoy’s look of responding horror indicated that his pale skin did not match with Harry’s brown, unruly hair, and green eyes.
“I thought you were working on homework before you got here!” Hermione shouted. She said nothing else, so Harry thought she must have given up. He slipped through the doors and held himself close to the walls.
“Would you have to use my wand for that?” he wondered aloud. Malfoy let his head fall onto the book he was skimming, and groaned into the pages. “Just wondering...”
“What?” he asked, his hand still on the doorknob, itching to leave this awkward situation. Malfoy took a breath and opened his mouth, but he didn’t say anything. Instead, he just looked down. Harry decided to take that moment to, again, try to leave.
“Malfoy, can’t we figure this out in the morning? It’s late,” Harry tried to reason. Malfoy didn’t reply. Harry, his head dropping with exhaustion, had a sleep-deprived idea. He grabbed the parchment from Malfoy’s hand, and before Malfoy could realize what he was doing, recited the spell on himself and Malfoy. The same feeling from before filled Harry, and when he looked at Malfoy, his mouth dropped.
“Potions relating to transformation or body switching. It’ll be an amateur potions book, considering we made it as students in a wizarding school,” Malfoy explained. Harry thought that was one of few times Malfoy didn’t sound like he wanted to punch Harry in the jaw.
“I can hear someone, dimwit!” Harry hissed through his teeth. The footsteps stopped for a moment, then slower, began coming closer. Harry tried to shove Malfoy further into the dark corner so he wouldn’t be seen, and for once, Malfoy didn’t fight, knowing they were right outside the Slytherin dungeons.
Each holding mini glasses of their own potions, they swapped and waited for Professor Snape to approve of their work. After inspecting and smelling both of the potions, he sneered at them but allowed them to drink. “You’ll feel a tense headache seconds after drinking the potion, enough to force your eyes shut. You’ll want to be sitting, Potter, Weasley, and once your headache stops, the potion should have done the trick.” When Ron spoke from Harry’s body, cursing and leaning in to inspect his face sitting across from him, there were laughs throughout the room of those watching. Harry was struck wordless, thinking he looked so different than he’d seen in mirrors. He also couldn’t help but notice his hair looked nicer today.
“Ron, we play the same instrument. I don’t think that her intention is for us to sound exactly the same. She was talking nonsense about how my violin and Malfoy’s piano playing intertwined or something,” Harry made air quotes around the word ‘intertwined’ like it was the most ridiculous word ever. Which it sort of was. And people only said intertwined when they were talking about something...illicit.
“What is it, Malfoy? I was about to head to bed,” Harry slurred, realizing just how tired he really was.
Draco stopped suddenly, clinging onto a loose brick so he didn’t fall from the sudden surprise. He willed his voice to come, so he could find an excuse to have been up there. All he could do was turn around with a terrified look on his face, praying that his demeanor would come back to protect him. A foot and a leg was there, along with an arm that gripped a wand. “Who’s there?” Draco demanded, finding his voice back. The person stepped down one step and there he stood.
“Just wandering. I’m not feeling well today, Pansy,” he muttered. She stopped walking and look at him, her head tilted like a puppy. She had a concerned look written on her face, and before Harry knew it, her hand was warm and soft against his forehead. He froze.
“I told you. The only thing here that scares me more than the idiot running this place is that damn cat. Are professors even allowed to have animals at Hogwarts?” he wondered out loud. Potter looked like he was about to argue when Draco huffed, letting him know the conversation was over. They turned a corner and went down a few steps, startling the painting of a young boy who was sleeping at his desk.
“Oh, are you talking about me, again?” Potter remarked, setting down his violin on a neighboring chair. “Yeah, I don’t really get that. Because as soon as I begin to play, I can only hear a horrible squeaking noise that sounds like I’m murdering a child, but everyone else seems to hear Mozart or something like that.” Potter straightened his glasses and looked uncomfortable.
Draco swirled the tip of his finger into his cup, which contained a plain glass of water. The ice bounced up and down as it met Draco’s finger, submerging and then emerging. Repeatedly. It was Friday morning, and class was to start in exactly an hour. He would have Double Potions, which was always great; however the Gryffindors were there as well, including Harry Potter.
“I dreamt about such a small, tight space, that I began to feel claustrophobic. It was dusty and horrible in there,” Malfoy said. Harry saw the realization in his eyes soon after. “Is there where your home is?”
“Everyone is going to be in classes. Plus, we’re going to be in the back. Can’t have anybody finding out exactly what we’re researching, nimwit.” And with that, Malfoy straightened his Gryffindor tie and began striding out towards the exit. Harry really had no choice but to follow him.
‘Probably my dashing looks. Not even he can resist them.’ Pansy snickered and wrote something down while Draco looked up, meeting Potter’s eyes. He glared while Potter looked down, blushing. Draco became outraged; surely Potter was the most idiotic person on Earth, doesn’t he know to forget what happened? Draco thought.
“I don’t think I’ve heard that one before. What’s it called?” Harry’s voice piped up. Draco pursed his lips, and sat up straight.
Harry had always seen Draco Malfoy as an arrogant, stuck up, annoying prick. And to be quite honest, he still does. But the music that Malfoy played was anything besides that. How he can mold his soul with the piano keys, how he turns into a completely different person. How Malfoy seems to be in his own little bubble, thinking things that nobody will ever be able to wonder like he does, while the music fills the space around him with liveliness.
“I thought I was going to die. I’ll have that crazy man fired, just you see.” Potter shrugged Draco’s hand off and walked out of the hallway, looking both ways before motioning for Draco to follow.
“My father would be horrified that his only son wouldn’t be able to carry on the family name.” A grin was plastered on his face at the thought.
“Are you with someone? I thought I could hear a voice, are you alright? You know it’s late, Draco.” Harry could hear the voice getting closer and began to panic.
“What are you doing here?” he asked, but then seemed to realize what an idiotic question that was. Still, Draco decided to answer him to further prove that point.
“We’ll not be working with cauldrons today,” announced Professor Snape in his drawling voice. Draco immediately frowned. “It has come to my attention that half of this class have not finished the ten pages of written work I assigned last time we were all in this classroom. Therefore, you’re now a day behind my other class. You’ll be spending all day working on that assignment.” Somebody behind him muttered something to their friend. Everyone looked curiously to one another, and for good reason. Usually, written work was for outside of class. During Potions, they’d work with actual potions. Draco felt his mood drop, and hastily pulled out his book, followed by a few others.
After a while, it was dead silent again save for the few distant snoring. Harry turned to his other side and realized if he couldn’t get to the Gryffindor common room before being sent back here, he couldn’t get back in. He didn’t know how to get into the common room, nor did he even know where exactly it was in the castle. He doesn’t come here very often, so navigating in the dark and with the way the castle likes to move around, there’s no way he’d find his way back. He decided that in the few hours it took for morning to come and breakfast to start, he’d think of a way to find Ron and Hermione and somehow convince them to talk in private and that he was actually Harry. Which made him wonder, is there gonna be a Harry tomorrow at breakfast? And if so, is it gonna be Malfoy in that body confused and lost just like he is?
“Well, Malfoy needs to get his hearing checked. And also his sanity,” Harry said, ruffling his hair and moving to get past Parkinson. “Besides, isn’t he missing his girlfriend right about now?” he remarked. Parkinson scoffed and brought a hand to her forehead.
“Potter, are you actually empty in your head? Who knows what else could go wrong? We have to hide. We cannot be seen like this,” Malfoy said. He pinched the bridge of his nose, looked back down at Harry, and reached for the glasses. “Give me those, you blockhead.” Harry squinted once again.
That night, Harry stayed up late with Ron in the common room, working on homework they’d ignored over the past few days. Hermione had been with them, but after nearly falling asleep over the table, she was convinced to go to sleep, leaving the two boys alone. After about the tenth time Ron cursed at himself for making a spelling mistake, Harry put his own quill down. “Ron, have you heard yet about the performance we’re going to have for music lessons?” Harry decided that Ron didn’t hear anything about it, because his face dropped as soon as Harry told him.
“I’m top in almost all of my classes, Potter. I think I’ve got it handled. But what are you going to do all day, then, hm?” Malfoy leaned back to admire his hair and decided he was done. He began to look into the mirror and style the hair on his own head when he stopped and realized exactly what he was doing.
“We’re walking slowly,” she said before catching up to him. Draco took large steps and stuttered and paused as much as he could before he found them standing in front of the Potions classroom.
“Well, it’s not my fault. He stalks me or something. He gets his friends to talk about him around me. It’s his fault,” Harry retorted. Ron and Hermione shared a look, and they ate in silence. Harry felt like he lost that argument. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy stand up and walk out of the Great Hall. Curious, as always, Harry decided to follow. “I’ve got homework to do,” he dismissed before standing up and following Malfoy.
“Mr. Malfoy, we shall see. It’s a while until the performance, which is why I haven’t officially announced it yet. But when I do, I’ll have the pairs planned out according to what I hear from each student. If you don’t like your partner, then you’ll not only be learning how to play music with your peer, but you’ll also be learning how to set aside differences and show people the beauty that two people can create with music,” she sighed and swooned once more, but Malfoy’s annoyance only seemed to grow. He simply took a deep breath, grabbed his folder of music, and stormed out of the room. Harry was left alone with Professor Villareal after that.
“I don’t know. I suppose I’ll practice flying or something. And if you really want to tackle styling my hair, you’re going to need some form of magic. It’s really not possible.” Malfoy rolled his eyes and began to leave the bathroom.
“Well, Mr. Malfoy, your skill on the piano compliments Mr. Potter’s levels of skill on the violin perfectly,” she swooned. “So much talent for two young boys has to be shown off!” Malfoy scoffed at that.
“Uh, Harry.. Leo isn’t going to get those lessons. Headmaster Dumbledore may allow a lot, but he wouldn’t just add classes on because some first-year wanted them.” Hermione and Harry shared a doubtful look, but decided Ron must be right. There was no way Dumbledore would do such a thing.
“What happens in the music room stays in the music room.” And then he left, leaving Harry to stand next to the now silent piano; he stared at it. It’s just an object now, but when Malfoy touched it, when he played it, it became a thing of beauty and awe. How could someone do something like that, he wondered. How could someone touch something so simple and make it seem alive and colorful?
“He’s right, you know. And I saw Potter was uneasy as well. Did you two have another wand fight or something? Who was your second?” she interrogated. Draco licked his lips, looking for an answer.
“Ugh, you got something wet on me. Disgusting, Potter. Can’t keep in your own drool?” He snickered, and then walked away, leaving Harry to pick everything up. Snape watched the whole thing from afar, not bothering to interfere, as always.
“But now you look ridiculous without my glasses on, and I probably look ridiculous like this,” he said, wiggling the glasses on his, or Malfoy’s, face. “But this really is a problem. People are bound to notice the glasses, maybe not the height change. After all, it’s only a few inches. Maybe try the spell again?”
“No! It wasn’t like that, it was weird... anyway, Professor Villareal happened to be listening in. I have no clue why she was there, but I guess from what she heard, she thought Malfoy and I were practicing together and she said it was wonderful and she’s pairing us up for the performance.” Harry spit it all out at once, laying it on the table for Ron to be disgusted by like he did.
“Just walk with me. I still have yet to learn what instrument you’ll be awful at,” he smirked and dragged an unwilling Potter behind him.
“Uh, only a little bit got on my skin, but I wiped it off...” he replied. Hermione’s concerned look went tenfold. “It’s fine, I’ll tell you if I start feeling weird. But classes for the day are over now, let’s go outside and enjoy the sun.” Ron and Hermione both agreed, and decided to head just outside to the courtyard, where Hermione brought her homework and Harry decided to teach Ron about football.
“Oh, Ron, you didn’t crush the lacewing flies, did you?” she peered over, stirring the potion. The face Ron gave implied the answer was no. Surely, Harry wouldn’t have to drink that... Who knows what could happen to him? “Here, just pour that out and take half of mine. We don’t really have time to start from scratch and Snape isn’t the best at realizing when Harry could be in danger rather than one of his Slytherins,” she muttered. Harry smiled and silently thanked her.
“I came to practice,” he said finally. Malfoy was silent. Apparently, he decided not to mention the fact that Harry’s violin was nowhere to be seen.
Draco went to bed that night thinking about the piano, and nothing else. He imagined sitting in front of it, too scared to do anything. Then Potter’s face appeared, urging him to play, and Draco spent the rest of the night up and reading.
After walking in late and earning a very stern glare from his professor and a promise for detention, Harry plopped down next to Ron and began taking out his book, along with some parchment. He sloppily wrote down a question before slipping it to Ron, who read it under the table.
Harry nodded, “I’ve heard of him. I like his music.” The two were being very civil and Harry would be lying if he said it didn’t unease him. Malfoy began to play, and went on for several minutes. Each time Malfoy’s long fingers pressed down on a note, Harry felt the single sound resonate within the room and through his own body. Keys were pressed a million miles a minute, but Draco sat on the bench, his robes falling all around him, looking completely effortless and almost bored. Harry found himself lost in the music for so long that he barely noticed when Malfoy was staring at him afterwards, his hands no longer at the piano but at his sides.
“Actually, I think it’s quite exciting,” said Dean. “I’d love to learn to play, and Seamus and I,” he patted Seamus on the back, “are going to be learning the same instruments so we can practice together.”
Now finding out that man was in fact Blaise, Harry watched as he lit the fireplace and prepared himself for hexes and punches. But they didn’t come. Blaise turned back around, tossed his wand aside, and smiled at Harry. “Um, I know you don’t ever like talking about it, do you want to take your mind off of it maybe?” he asked Harry, tilting his head. Harry was confused about all this concern for someone who didn’t really take a liking to him.
“Potter, wait,” Malfoy snapped when the door clicked open. “I played for you, now it’s your turn. Let’s see how talented you really are when you’re under pressure.” He sat up straight once more, turning his nose up like he does.
When the two reached the classroom and Potter moved to open the door, Draco slapped his hand away. “Are you mental? We can’t go in at the same time!” Draco took Potter by the robes and shoved him backwards. “Wait at least two minutes,” before he opened the door and sauntered in. When he took his seat next to Pansy, she reached for his arm.
“Yours isn’t keen with me either. It can’t stand me any more than you can,” Harry barked back. Malfoy rolled his eyes and sighed, pulling Harry into a dark corner after hearing the chatter of some students.
Blaise Zabini sat down across from Draco, biting the tip of his quill and getting ink all over his tongue. “Are you trying to poison yourself?” Draco snarled. Blaise looked up, and realized what he was doing.
“Yes, well at least that’s what Draco says. He bets you’ve learned before, and are just trying to make yourself look better than everyone else? Haven’t you already done that quite enough?” She said, turning her nose up at him. Harry thought this was a ridiculous notion and only pig-minded people like Parkinson would believe such a thing.
“You don’t have to practice here. Your instrument is portable,” Malfoy said, sounding surprisingly not angry. He turned around and held his head high. There was a sniffle, and then he turned back around. “Fine, you can if you want. I’m done practicing anyway. Just finished a marvelous piece by a Muggle pianist,” he said, looking proud. Harry knew no piece was made by slamming one’s hands down on the piano, but he didn’t say anything.
“Yeah, I’m alright,” Harry mutters. He then also realized he has no idea how Malfoy talks when he’s not spitting at Harry or shouting at other students. “Just tired, you know,” he trails off.
“He’s actually being a teacher for once,” said Weasley from across the room (he must not have even tried to be quiet as he spoke over the shuffling of papers and chatting of other students).
“Your father doesn’t have a say in who you’re attracted to. That’s all you, darling,” Pansy laughed, brushing the hair out of her eyes.
“You absolute idiot.” That was all Malfoy had to say. He didn’t need to spit or turn his nose up at Harry. He got the point across perfectly well. Harry agreed that he was an absolute idiot at that moment. “Exactly what did you think was going to happen, you buffoon? Did you think it was all going to be resolved after the spell didn’t work the first time? I ought to hex you, or punch you, or...” Malfoy trailed off, and he pinched the bridge of his nose.
He ran straight into Draco. Or Draco ran straight into him. Or it was a mutual effort. Either way, things went stumbling. Draco was obviously not happy. He guffawed and then, clenching his jaw, sneered, “Watch where you’re going, Potter. Or I’ll gladly watch for you and make sure you never run into me again. You’re lucky I am letting you off the hook this time.” Harry didn’t say anything, trying not to let the situation escalate, although he himself was feeling his own anger escalate. His robes and part of his face felt wet, when he realized Draco’s potion had been spilled on him. At the same time he realized this, he heard Draco whine again.
“Lucky for you, I actually know more than three spells. And I know how to reverse a simple spell like this,” Malfoy lifted his chin proudly. And then he pulled out his wand and muttered something Harry had never heard before, and his vision went to a dull grey, then a bright green, and then back to normal. “There. Fixed. Like nothing ever happened. Well, after you stupidly bumped into me. Really, do those glasses do nothing? Or are you somehow infatuated by me every time you see me and lose the ability to function like a normal human being?” Malfoy scoffed and bickered and teased until Harry wanted to smack him upside the head. Malfoy kept on bickering and whining until Harry had completely zoned him out, which is when he heard footsteps coming round the corner. Alerted, he shoved his hands over Malfoy’s mouth, to which Malfoy ripped them off and began shouting at Harry. Harry hit him on the shoulder, and shushed him.
“Okay, do it,” Harry said, and stood a few steps back, allowing room between them. Malfoy nodded, took out a piece of parchment, read from it, then flicked his wand and read the words. Harry closed his eyes, suddenly feeling faint. His knees nearly gave out beneath him, until he jolted straight up again, filled with energy. It quickly dissipated, and once his eyes opened, his was staring at himself once more. His shoulders slumped.
“Not quite tired yet, and I’ve got homework to do.” Blaise shrugged, patted his shoulder, and left the common room. Save for a few other Slytherins, Harry was alone in his thoughts, staring blankly into the crackling fire. His fingers massaged the green tie he wore, and his feet shuffled towards the fire, warming up. He wondered how long this would last, how long it would be before he could wrestle with Ron, do homework with Hermione, fly his broom, use his own wand. Malfoy’s wand knew exactly who held it, no matter the face, and did not like him one bit. He thought if he would have to go to Malfoy’s home and pretend to be Draco Malfoy. Would his parents know? Would he get caught? How would Malfoy deal with his uncle, or his cousin? He hoped Malfoy wouldn’t kill them before the two got back to Hogwarts.
“Uh, yeah?” Harry answered uncertainly. Malfoy slapped his arm and made a face. “Who’s there?” Harry said, trying his best to act as insolent and prissy as Malfoy does, which made said person roll his eyes. The girl introduced herself as Kami, the second year he sees sometimes.
Hermione gave a concerned look, “Did you get any on your skin or in your mouth?” Harry wasn’t quite sure how the potion could work if it just touched his skin, and he didn’t want to find out.
“Somewhere. I’ve been taking a while to think, but I’ve decided on the harp.” She turned away and began searching for the form in her bag. Draco imagined Pansy playing the harp, and fought a smile.
“Nobody. I’m with no one, don’t worry about it. Leave me alone,” Harry tried. But the girl stepped out of the door and into view, where she furrowed her brow and tilted her head at the sight of what appeared to be Draco Malfoy shoving Harry Potter into a corner and covering his mouth. Harry quickly pulled his arms to his side.
Later that evening, while the trio sat at Gryffindor table and ate their dinners, Leo Parks walked up to Harry with an expected look and some parchment perched onto a book.”Well?” he asked. Harry had forgotten all about it after HoM, but decided he would sign the petition anyway. He abandoned his homework and began writing his name, before another caught his eye. ‘Draco Malfoy’ was written in thin and cursive handwriting. Harry sneered at the name, but wrote anyway. Hopefully enough people signed that there would be multiple periods, and Harry wouldn’t be stuck with the Slytherin. Ron and Hermione signed as well, appearing to not notice Malfoy’s name. Leo stood very excitedly, nearly bouncing on his feet as they all signed.
He scowled as he remembered yesterday’s incident; allowing his guard down around anyone was punishable, but Harry Potter was the absolute worst person to ever stop being Draco Malfoy around. If he’d even let slip that he thought Harry was marvelous at the violin, he would have to flee the country. And no matter what anybody said, he was not overreacting. If a single person knew that he liked anything about Harry Potter, lots of bad things would happen. First of all, it would get around the entire school. Secondly, it would make Potter think he could win over anyone. And lastly, everyone would finally piece together why Draco Malfoy, unlovable Slytherin, was so irritated by Potter.
But tonight Harry dreamt of a large home, where surely the wealthy lived. But it was so dim and sad, that Harry didn’t want to enter. Somehow the place felt so familiar to him, as soon as he entered, he turned and went upstairs as if he knew exactly where he was going. He ended up in a bare bedroom, larger than Harry was used to, quite obviously. There was a big bed and it seemed void of life. Most likely a guest bedroom, he supposed. Until he saw in a corner a wide desk. Inspecting the drawers, he realized this was the bedroom of a teenager around his age. There were open letters and potion ingredients and other kinds of clutter scattered around. Harry hadn’t quite put the pieces together until he read one of the fancy envelopes, which was addressed to the Malfoy Manor. This was Draco Malfoy’s bedroom. Where he spent his Christmases and his summers and where he grew up. This is where Lucius Malfoy lived, and Malfoy’s mother. Harry couldn’t help but wonder why this room was so lifeless, so void of, well, Draco. At the Weasley house, you could pretty much tell who slept in what bedroom. Each bed was different, and so was each wall. Every room had a personality in that house, and was also full of life, just like Hogwarts. But the Malfoy Manor felt so pristine that even the air was stale. Harry felt uncomfortable, and he suddenly awoke from his dream.
“Do you remember the commotion tonight at dinner? With those Ravenclaw girls asking us to play that weird game they heard of with the questions?” Blaise asked. Harry didn’t really know what to do at this point, and he was too scared to come up with the strange conclusion that he must look like Malfoy right now. “And that shorter one asked if you were gay? I think they only played that whole game to ask that one question. It’s kind of ridiculous that they’re coming up with that theory. Ravenclaws are too smart for their own good, they start thinking up ridiculous things that aren’t true, and then they can’t be convinced otherwise,” he shakes his head as he says this. Harry decides he’s just gonna listen to whatever Blaise is saying until he’s satisfied, then they’re gonna go to bed, and then he’s gonna sneak out and go back to the common room, somehow get Hermione from the girl’s dorm, and ask her what the hell is going on. “Was the nightmare really that bad? You still haven’t talked and you look a little freaked out,” Blaise asks Harry, looking and sounding concerned. Harry realized he’s going to have to act a little bit to get out of this one.
“It looks like you’re having a heart attack every damn time you look at me in there!” he shouted. Realizing there could be other people in there, he began searching through the stalls. “Pansy is beginning to think you fancy me. Is it true, Potter?” he smirked. Potter was silent long enough that Draco began to think it was actually true.
‘Some first year wants me to sign a petition for music lessons at Hogwarts. But if I sign it, I have to enroll in the class.’
“Do you think I’d get expelled if I dunked Potter’s head in his cauldron next time round?” Draco said to Pansy. She gave a high laugh and looked up.
Harry sludged his way to Malfoy’s cold, large bed, and looked to where the window right by his bed would be. He imagined seeing the moon and its craters, watching the trees of the forbidden forest rustle, hearing Ron snoring loudly and talking in his sleep. He imagined himself back in his own body, and staying far away from any kind of Slytherin for a long while, until he drifted off to sleep. Like the night before, and every night since Harry was in Malfoy’s body, he dreamt of Malfoy’s home. He dreamt of the dreariness of the manor, the emptiness and void. He made his way to Malfoy’s bedroom, again. He stood next to Malfoy’s bed, which in this dream, was ice cold to the touch.
“No, about...” he trailed off, hoping she would understand. Sighing when she gave him a blank look, he continued. “About me being gay.” He waved his hand in front of her face.
She gave him a sly smile as she pulled out her Potions book. “Pansy,” Draco started. “That’s Blaise’s chair.” She didn’t reply. “Hello?” he said, getting irritated. She looked at him in the eye and made a zipping motion with her mouth, a growing grin on her face. “Pansy, not now. Today is a good day. I get Double Potions and Flying today,” he hissed. Pansy turned away and flipped through the book, pretending to be interested in the ingredients for Pepperup Potion.
“I bet you five galleons he’s learned it before,” said a loud and shrill voice from Slytherin table. Harry knew it was Malfoy, trying to get a rise from Harry. He promptly ignored the boy, determined to get the last few bits of food left. “Bet he’s just trying to compensate for how awful he is at his other classes.” Harry unconsciously closed his hand into a fist and walked more firmly. When he was finally out of earshot, he sat down next to Ron and began eating grumpily.
“If I have to use Brachiabindo on you to get you to sit in your god damn chair, I will,” hissed Malfoy. Harry stayed quiet. He had no doubt that Malfoy would do that.
“I can’t believe I’m still stronger than you and I’m literally in your body,” Malfoy snickered. “I suppose you’re taller than me now, at least.” Harry kept his mouth shut, and became very aware of how much he was breathing, with Malfoy so close to him prodding at his scalp. “You’re going to be absent in all of your classes today, by the way.”
“You played for me, Malfoy? Really?” Harry snickered. It can be tricky to understand these past few days whether or not Malfoy is attacking Harry or being civil. Malfoy glared at Harry. He sighed, and decided he wasn’t getting out of this without Malfoy holding yet another grudge over him. He sat down and pulled his violin and bow back out of the case, the nerves filling his stomach. Harry decided to go with the only piece he knew without looking at any sheets and closed his eyes and began to play. He grimaced at the mistakes he was making and how ridiculous he thought he sounded, nothing but emptiness trying to drown out his horrible music. Feeling Malfoy’s eyes digging into him, he stopped and looked back.
“I think we should give up on schoolwork and get some sleep,” said Harry. He hadn’t realized just how much he needed to climb into bed and forget everything else that was happening around him.
“You’re Malfoy,” he stated. “How did this happen?” he asked. Malfoy just shook his head, looking furious.
Draco looked through the form for Music Lessons, feeling content as he sat facing the crackling fire in the dungeons. Pansy Parkinson stood next to him, reading over his shoulder. It was quite irritating, but today Draco was determined he wouldn’t snap at anyone (even Harry Potter), for today was a day to celebrate. He would finally be learning to play an instrument, one of his items on “Draco Malfoy’s Top Secret Bucket List”. “Pansy, where’s your form? And what instrument are you signing up for?”
“Malfoy if we don’t get this fixed by tonight, I’m going to have to come back here, you know.” Malfoy glared at him with pursed lips and didn’t say anything, but instead turned around to repeat the password,
“Unless you’re going to give me a makeover every morning,” Harry stated. Malfoy glared at him as he parted Harry’s...his...hair.
When the piece was over, Harry felt confident. He played perfectly that time, somehow. His skin was covered in goosebumps from the exhilaration he felt. Malfoy seemed content with thinking he was much more talented than Harry, once again. They sat there in silence for a moment before the doors nearly slammed open, terrifying both of them into nearly falling off their chairs. Standing there was the music teacher, Professor Villareal.
“You wish, Malfoy. I’m just still surprised you can actually play the piano well instead of sounding like a kneazle scratching against a blackboard.” Potter seemed quite proud of that, so Draco let him have it.
“Once your potion has ceased bubbling, take exactly three strands of your hair and dissolve them into your potion.” drawled Professor Snape from right behind Harry, causing him to jump and almost knock over the jar of fluxweed. “Try your best to resist the urge to stir in the hair... Let it sit on its own or the ingredients will become imbalanced and you may have either two or zero brains in a body...” A phrase that caused snickers around the room. Snape seemed pleased and strolled along to watch some of his more favorite students.
“How did you possibly know about the music lessons?” he whispered harshly, forgetting about Quidditch altogether. He realized he was still holding onto Potter and harshly let go.
“Well, my friends and I all agree that the music in this school is a bit limited. I am very gifted on the guitar, and some of my friends are quite well at it, too. We’d like lessons here at the school, but we can’t go to the headmaster without enough people rooting for us.” Harry thought this was a fair decision, and why wouldn’t he sign it? He was about to say exactly that when the boy spoke again. “But we also promised that anyone who signs the petition would enroll in the class.” Now this was a problem. Harry had no interest whatsoever in music. Plus, he was very clumsy and had limited attention span. Learning to play an instrument would be a very hard task for Harry. The large bell chimed in the distance, noting that Harry was definitely late for class this time. The young boy didn’t seem to care at all.
“You’ve got to stop letting him bother you so often. You complain about him all the time, you know.” Harry was silent at that and realized he did talk about Malfoy quite a lot. Hermione kept her firm glance.
“Fine by me,” Ron replied, and stacked all his papers together to shove in his book bag, bounding up the stairs before Harry had even finished gathering his supplies. Laid in bed, his comforter snuggled around him like a protective shield, Harry couldn’t stop thinking about the dread he felt having to practice music with Malfoy. He’d supposed it was going to be initially like it was in the music room, but more of Malfoy snickering and bickering at everything Harry did. Would Malfoy have even acted like this all these years if Harry hadn’t refused his handshake back when they were younger? He scoffed and shook his head. It was ridiculous the grudges the Malfoys could keep when they were dedicated. Harry was eleven years old, for God’s sake! He didn’t know anything, just knew that this random kid was being snarky to his new friend. Harry was frustrated that every small action he made was blown out of proportion. He chalked it down to being the “chosen one.” But nothing had even happened with Voldemort since first year! Surely people would give up on calling him a savior, and a hero to the Wizard World. He just wanted to be a normal boy.
Harry was sitting in his Charms class, at a desk in the back. His mind felt like a bowl of jelly, and he found himself drifting off to sleep every few seconds at a time. “Mr. Potter!” yelled Professor Flitwick. “Please entertain the rest of the class by explaining why you did not get enough sleep last night so that you must drift off in my class?” Harry silently cursed Malfoy’s existence and begged the Gods to tell him why it took him so long to find the Gryffindor dorms last night.
“Risky, how? If it’s wrong will I be in my body with your hair, and you in your body with my scar?” Harry asked. Malfoy bit his lip and looked down, shuffling his feet.
The Great Hall felt familiar and bright as they walked in, and calmed Harry’s nerves the slightest. His eyes automatically shifted to the Gryffindor table, where he saw Malfoy sitting awkwardly next to Ron and across from Hermione. Everyone was chattering around him, save for himself and Ron, who was stuffing his face full of steaming potatoes. Harry reluctantly made his way to the Slytherin table, sitting down with Pansy to his left and Blaise to his right.
“You do feel a little warmer than usual. But you should get some food in you. You’re skinnier than me!” Pansy grabbed his hand and locked her fingers with his, pulling him along. Holding hands felt very weird to Harry, but he didn’t know whether or not he should pull away. What does Malfoy usually do?
“Maybe she knew I could get her owner kicked out of Hogwarts,” Draco sneered, gaining his pride back. Potter just glared at him before turning away. “Wait,” Draco said, immediately regretting his decision. Potter turned, expecting another fight. “I’ve decided that, uh,” Draco paused, looking for the right words. “The halls at night are unsafe with those two running around, and you are to escort me to the dungeons safely.” Potter gave Draco a deadpan look again, before turning completely towards Draco and stalking towards him.
“I wish you would. You’ve no idea how many times that cat has ratted me out. But I don’t know why she let me go this time,” he muttered. Draco took a deep breath, still recovering from the terrifying few moments.
Draco and Pansy worked together quietly, not speaking but cursing their own mutual connection to know exactly what the other was doing. They finished in one hour and let it brew on its own in the corner of the table. As Draco doodled lazily on his Transfiguration homework, Pansy slid him another note.
“Sure, next I’ll tell my aunt and uncle how much I appreciate them for everything they’ve done for me. And then after that, I’ll plan a lunch with Voldemort,” said Harry. Malfoy had apparently had enough.
“Potter!” a shrill whisper came from the entrance of the common room. Harry was pulled away from the fire and his thoughts, to investigate. It was Malfoy, obviously. Who else would ask for Potter in the Slytherin dorms? Malfoy pulled on his robes and out into the corridor they went.
“Right, well... perhaps another piano player,” Ron suggested. “Besides, no matter what, she’ll come to realize you two can’t be in the same room for too long until you start hexing each other or just fist-fighting in general.” Harry didn’t want to be punched by Malfoy, or have a hex thrown at him, and he didn’t have the energy to keep throwing punches at him, either. Honestly, he just wanted to pretend Malfoy didn’t exist for a few weeks, and relax. Hogwarts was his home, he was supposed to feel happy here. But his home is infested with a blond Slytherin who seems to follow him around everywhere. Ron yawned, which spread to Harry.
“I asked Granger what she knew about the potion we did in Snape’s class. She thought you were finally interested in Potions,” Malfoy chuckled. “I think I know a way to fix this, but it’s risky.” Malfoy waited for Harry’s response eagerly.
“He doesn’t quite match me, professor,” and then turned to look at Harry, who was almost ready to bolt out of there. “He may think he’s all that, but surely we could never work together in any kind of situation. I think I’ll work perfectly with someone else. Perhaps another Slytherin in the class?” he persuaded. Professor Villareal looked at him, smiling.
“Oh, no,” Malfoy whined before shoving his face into his hands. He shook off the glasses, and Harry grabbed them. He put them on, and realized what else had happened.
“Oh, and our voices! I sound like you, and that’s apparently what I sound like,” Malfoy made a face. “I can kind of see why people call me snide, now.” Harry couldn’t help but just nearly laugh at that.
Harry was startled when he heard Malfoy’s father shouting. Every time he’d dreamt of this place, it was dead quiet. Malfoy wasn’t there, neither were his parents. Nobody was there. Just Harry. He froze, trying to make out the words that were booming from across the manor. He could only make out bits and pieces. Words like ‘disgrace,’ ‘disappointment,’ and other nasty phrases. Opening Malfoy’s bedroom door, Harry peered out down the long, stale hallway. And then he peered down the staircase. And then he peered into the dining room, where the Malfoy family was sat having dinner. Malfoy was sitting with his head down, staring at his food, which was just as grey and lifeless as the rest of Harry’s dream. Malfoy’s father did not look like he did in real life. In this dream, he looked taller, more ferocious, and terrifying. He towered over everything else in the house, every word he spoke shook the furniture. Malfoy’s mother looked so soft and sweet, however. She had the most amount of color in the house, which still wasn’t much. She held her hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, her thumb rubbing circles on his skin, soothing Malfoy. That hand was full of color, and the color seeped into Malfoy, but soon disappearing. Her other hand, however, held onto Lucius’ hand, while he shouted and shrieked. The color was completely gone on that side. Harry watched the scene unfold for a few moments, until everything went silent and froze. Slowly, all three turned to Harry. Lucius had the most terrifying and furious face Harry had ever seen. Narcissa looked sorrowful and pleading at Harry. Malfoy had a blank face.
He didn’t want to admit it, but he was entranced. And then he noticed Malfoy’s eyes looking right into his own. Harry was startled, and looked away. He decided to listen to Malfoy’s advice and tune out the glorious music. Looking back to his own sheet music, Harry was uncomfortable. His attempts at ignoring Malfoy’s playing weren’t going quite well, and Harry didn’t want to ruin it by torturing this poor violin. He set the bow down onto the stand, and his violin rested in his lap. Harry had truly only come here to practice in hopes of hearing Malfoy play again, but maybe it wasn’t such a good idea. He was feeling unmotivated. He felt like he was falling in love. With the piano, obviously.
“Well, you said you’d learn the same instrument as me. Have fun on the violin,” he said with a grin. Ron was not pleased by the idea; he was sure these lessons wouldn’t happen.
“Uh, using the bathroom. What does it look like?” he threw back, instantly defending himself. Draco scoffed.
“If we get to the point where we actually believe that, I’m breaking down your pride and going to the hospital wing. They’ll know what to do, and they already do know what to do. So we just probably just head over there,” said Harry. He was trying his best to lure Malfoy away from the research and towards actual help without making him too pissy.
Pansy gave him a disgusted look. “Well, at least you’re thinking about it. It’s nice to know your options.” She smiled sweetly at a light-haired girl walking past the table, as if proving her point.
“‘Thanks to Leonardo Parks, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are proud to announce new music lessons being offered. The students below have promised to sign up for these lessons and will do so for an entire year. Otherwise, these lessons will secede for everyone involved.’ And there’s Dumbledore’s name signed at the bottom.” Ron groaned and sat back in the love chair he was resting on. Hermione began counting the names for Gryffindor house.
