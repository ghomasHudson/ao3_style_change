"I'll be taking a walk, dear," Malfoy said as he was pulling on a light dressing robe. He paused, "Terence." he said firmly, and was met with a grunt, "I am going out for a walk inside the manor. Sleep alone for a bit."
"Enough, Mippy," a new voice cut in, and Mippy was thrust to the side in the wake of a much bulkier house elf, "Aurors, everything is being fine. Master Draco is being good and following rules and Gremly is requesting Aurors to be leaving now."
He knows he's pushing it a bit, but he really wants to have something over that prick. And he's gotten six B's and two A's this semester: pretty smart if you ask.
Malfoy's son looked almost exactly like him, the only differences being his hair and the way his nose turned up instead of going straight down in a slim stroke like his father's. He had the same eyes, the same pointy chin, and the same little twist to the corner of his mouth that made him look like he were about to say something nasty even if he really wasn't.
"And we're inviting everyone from all kinds of Houses!" she says cheerfully, jotting the idea down onto a bit of parchment lest it abandons her.
"Ron!" Harry half-shrieked, blood flooding into his cheeks as his hands scrambled for purchase on the silk sheets, trying his very best to salvage what was left of his dignity.
A major downside to these visions was that Harry simply never had enough time to process one bit of information before another barged right in to smack him in the face. This fact was proved rather well when, just as he was starting to process the emotional significance of seeing Teddy all grown up, Ginny walked in.
Harry did not tell him that he didn't mind at all. That he'd rather have it shouted from the rooftops and printed in the tabloids: that Harry Potter was completely gone for Draco Malfoy, and that he liked it. That he liked feeling like this: wanting something so desperately; something he practically already had, but was just barely out of reach.
"I'm assuming you're gonna show me the future?" he asked it, waiting in vain for a reply. He sighed again, "Not a talker, then. Fine, let's get this over with."
!' Harry realized with another unpleasant jolt. He'd been well on his way to jacking off to imaginary delusions of a... fifteen year old Draco Malfoy masturbating to a younger Harry Potter.
Blinking twice in succession, he shook the disdainful and eerily Malfoy-esque voice out of his head. Cor, he had to be going mad.
"They're kind of... neat," Harry mumbles sheepishly while simultaneously shooting Hermione a dark look. She promised she wouldn't tell! Well, on the bright side, maybe he could finally unshrink his growing collection of baskets and start decorating the flat with their adorable reedy goodness... "what were we talking about?"
The blond then quickened his pace, walking briskly into a room that looked to be a study of some sort. After a lingering look at his wand, he cast a silencing spell and a locking charm at the door in quick succession. Harry's cock had certainly recognized that particular combination of spells, and began its rise to attention.
.” He complied with a smile, allowing to himself be dragged up the length of his lover’s back. He adjusted their positions so that he had his chin hooked over Draco’s shoulder, and their eyes met in the mirror- green on silver.
Harry turns to the enchanted window with a huff, squinting as the sunlight stings his eyes, "Half a Hermione Point for articulacy. And I don't know what you're talking about." But he has a feeling that he does know, and that's a concerning thought on its own.
"OW!" Dudley cries, clutching his bum again, and glares at Harry who is rummaging in the fridge for something leafy, "You did that, didn't you?"
Draco's, Lucius observes with a huff. He allows the hems of his dressing robe to plop back to the carpeted floor as he twirls in his palms the snakehead cane that encases his wand.
“Weasley. Congratulations on the wedding,” he offers graciously. The redhead honestly looks like he’s not sure what to do with the comment. “I was shopping around for hats, as you can probably tell, before you began to antagonize me within earshot.”
"So I was thinking... we could get Malfoy to wear one of the shirts with the poofy sleeves!" Hermione calls out victoriously, "he's awfully skinny, and-"
"It's been two days," he said, but let his hands slide up Draco's waist anyway. His fingers ran over the silk of his lover's shirt, the skin underneath saturated with heat.
In dark brown and beige colors, however, it was still very drab as far as interior design went. He found himself thinking about Malfoy's stylish flat in London, where he'd seen him ride a dildo with Harry in mind. It felt like ages had passed since he'd seen that particular vision.
"Let's go back to the Shack," Harry says hastily, voice growing distant over the sound of the wind; they must have opened the window"I know you hate that dump, but I'll fuck your ass open on the coffee table and it'll feel just like the first time we..."
"We talk about nothing!" the blond bellows, whipping his wand about forebodingly, "We haven't talked in days, and every time we start, you just flip me over on your dinky old bed and-!"
!" he growls, and up close, he's infinitely more terrifying. His eyes are like molten steel, and currently flashing savagely at him. He's an inch or so shorter than Dudley, but he still manages to look at him down his nose by tilting his white head back. His skin is perfectly unblemished, and in the face of his panic, Dudley wonders if he uses the M-word to keep himself looking good.
The bangs grow louder as he approaches the kitchen. Typical of the freak, Harry, to be stealing food at midnight.
Ron snorted, "Yeah. Jumped off a six storey bridge chasing a dark wizard. Came out all right but Kingsley's let him off for a week for violating rules of safety or something," he scratched his head, "didn't think about the fact that someone else'd be assigned to Malfoy though."
"You look so gorgeous like that," says a whispered voice, followed by a pitchy whimper, "all spread out for me."
Ron is thankful that he can't quite remember the precise feeling of Malfoy's silver gaze piercing into his own, lips parted in a moan: "Oh, Harry!" or "Oh, Potter!" or something of the sort.
It was quite ridiculous, how different Malfoy looked with his poncey robes off, ivory skin glowing underneath the more muted paleness of Harry's.
That was Malfoy, in a tone amazingly similar to that which he used to take on at Hogwarts whilst saying nasty things about Harry's mum.
"Close your mouth," he told him softly, silver eyes gleaming as he smiled, "it's unbecoming of you."
"Rosie!" future-Harry exclaimed with a wide grin. Unlike Ginny's, his smile lit up his eyes and transformed his haggard face into something presentable. He grabbed hold of Rosie and tossed her up in the air, revelling in the excited shriek she let out.
"It seems you are in luck after all, Mr. Potter," he smiled back, "that will be penthouse number sixteen, Sir."
There comes a ridiculous amount of noise from behind the doors before his father's voice calls, "Come in."
"I thought nobody cared about wrinkly clothes," Harry chuckled, and was met with a half hearted glare.
“I want you,” Harry complied immediately, pulling at Draco’s cock in tandem with his thrusts, feeling the foreskin slide noisily over his shaft and revelling in his lover’s moans, his whimpers and his ‘
"Refusal?" Lucius interrupted with a furrowed brow, "I hadn't fancied you an idiot, Draco. Do you not realize what a prestigious event this is? Two out of three of the Golden Trio are marrying- eachother! The only event more culturally relevant would be the marriage of Harry Potter himself!"
With an air of finality, the connection fizzled out, taking Harry's heart with it. Dejected, he scuffed the toe of his sneaker against the mirror-like surface of the floor.
"Yes," he replied, walking over to the blond. His eyes flickered from arse, to legs, and back to arse. It was hell on earth, heaven in the flesh. Harry could only let out a shuddering breath, "fuck, yes."
The Grim would have rolled its eyes if it could. Instead, it put on an expression of great disdain- for a dog, anyway- and the scene began to swirl.
“Did you know,” came Draco’s soft drawling voice close enough to his ear that he could feel the warmth of his breath against his skin, “that this is the best day of my life? I’m almost afraid to close my eyes,” he said as he did exactly that, and burrowed his cheek into Harry’s chest, “lest it turn out to be an elaborate delusion fueled by alcohol on an empty stomach and sub-par head from
She raps her knuckles against the age-old "GRED AND FORGE" sign on the door, not bothering to conceal her amused smile, "Ginny! Are you in here?"
Perhaps his quest is futile after all, he panics, trudging towards the hat section and picking one up— midnight blue with black trim, and rather pointy. A bit too last-year for his taste!— and studies it wearing the calmest expression he can muster. Potter already has his sewer-water colored eyes upon Draco’s prize—hair. All is nil!
"Mate," he said gravely, with the air of someone who had seen and lived through hell. And he really had, come to think of it.
Then with a sly smile, Harry says, "You're getting married this month." Ron's smirk effectively dissolves into panic.
Ron had no idea how Malfoy's face (Malfoy! That was Malfoy!) retained its... lewd expression while one of his most disliked school rivals was watching him in the midst of getting his arse plowed. And to add to that, the one who was
"I mean, can you blame him?" the aforementioned git said haughtily, running a hand down his own torso, "I'm stunning."
Mippy began to look confused (and Ron really should have started to suspect that the Very Bad Thing was bound to happen any moment now), "Mippy is not understanding, Aurors. Harry Potter is--"
The Grim made a noise that sounded like a laugh. Harry ignored it, looking away from Ginny when it began to grow unbearable, and laid his eyes upon Teddy instead. However, that too, felt strange and forbidden, so he opted instead to stare fixedly at the unknown ginger boy who had now fallen asleep on the table.
With the slightest bit of hesitation, Draco pushes a door open and enters the far-too-large room. Lucius Malfoy sits calmly at his (very ostentatious) desk with his fingers authoritatively steepled in front of him. He's wearing a dressing robe similar to Draco's own, and his hair...
Slowly, he raised himself off the sofa and began stalking over to Malfoy. The blond sat rigid, except for his frantic foot, hands clasped gently. The milky white skin of his collar peeked out over the neckline of his robe, bones visible, but not skeletal.
right in the arse again, and there's an apology on his lips when Malfoy sweeps past him, a tin of Mum's favourite biscuits in hand.
"Then go commando," Harry says, follows it up with a deep chuckle, "Merlin knows you love being a lewd little shit. You've still got cum on your robes."
"Uh huh... so Quidditch, right?" Harry settled back in his seat, crossing his legs to mimic the way Malfoy was seated, "Reminds me of some good times... beating you, that is."
“Draco.” Harry sighed, pushing himself forward so his elbows rested on his knees. “I’m just trying to understand.”
“I haven’t been sleeping. Apparently. If they didn’t require me to use my wand only for necessities then I wouldn’t have to stay there for several hours after my shift.”
“How long have you been…” Harry gestured to the bruises under Draco's eyes, lighter but no less prominent.
“I’m not going home tonight, I’ll try to kill someone. Maybe myself. Could I stay with you? For tonight?”
"Is there another pianist that can take over for you?" Harry breathes down Draco's neck, short and sharp, making Draco shiver - with cold or anticipation... well, he can only find out, can't he?
Another silence descended and Harry jumped to fill it with a matter that he considered more pressing: “Would you like to continue your tale of woe, or do you want dinner first?”
Says the man with his head in his hands at a pub, surrounded by concern, his shirtsleeve sliding down his forearm and sticking there just long enough for someone to cough politely before he grabbed his sleeve with his right hand and yanked it roughly up so he could grip it tightly, making a fist where the button had fallen off.
Behind her drapes, Harry could hear Walaburga cackling, the mirthless sound raking through his ears.
"Harry now is it?" Lucius looked as though he'd sucked on a lemon. Just thinking about it made Draco want to laugh.
He bounced his foot on the branch beneath his heel as he watched the pink sky fade to orange, tapping his heel vigorously in time with his thoughts.
“I hate you.” Draco said to no one in particular, but maybe he was talking to the eye, of which he was already bending to scoop up, trying not to recoil at the slightly sticky residue it left on his naked flesh.
Draco hid his mouth behind his hand as he tried to keep his bubbling giggles at bay. “I’m very proud of you sweetheart - your hair’s been captured perfectly.”
He scoured the very back of the cupboard again, this time with the help of some light and the ability to move things more easily than before. Hidden under the more useless cleaning products, the rubbing alcohol stared him in the face.
“You won’t. He loves you.” Hermione said quietly. “I promise, he’ll be over the moon after all this is over. I
“I don’t really care about him right now.” This time, when Harry went to touch him, Draco did not pull away. They stood, forehead pressed against one another, watching the racing flecks swirling around each other’s eyes.
Harry’s expression mirrored Hermione’s, albeit with less hair. The pure horror that he’d divulged such information as Draco’s wardrobe choices, and apparently bemoaned them enough times for Hermione to quote his words exactly back at him was a ghastly notion.
“Whatever was in that kiss must have been strong.” Harry laughed as he stumbled over his own feet, Draco grabbing him around the waist before he could fall. They were back in Grimmauld Place, the apparition far less sickness-inducing than usual.
He turned away, rifling quickly through the drawer, fingers skating over the other items he’d left in there; a ballpoint pen, little love notes Harry had left over the years, a pack of seeds for a houseplant that had yet to actually be planted, and, of course, the box tucked at the back.
Draco, while bouncing on his heels from excitement, looked at Harry like he’d won the lottery—trying to communicate how much he didn’t need his approval, and also how much he did.
Draco, as the tallest, was pulling glasses down from the kitchen cabinet and handing them one at a time to Hermione.
While Draco digested the information, Harry picked at the hem of his sweater, eyes flickering back and forth from the slowly unraveling green yarn to Draco’s unrelenting grey eyes.
"Who taught you to do that? Not Potter I hope?" Lucius sneered, but it wasn't nearly as menacing as it had been when he was a child. If Draco thought about it, after all this time he was probably more scared of Aunt Andromeda than both of his parents combined.
He landed on a cushioning charm but it hadn’t stopped him flailing around like a wingless gull. Less grace and more fragility. The sight would have been almost intimate if he hadn’t screamed a litany of curses as he fell.
Harry took a bite of his bacon roll. “I’m sort of glad she’s not here, she’d have a fit if she saw me eating this.”
The question caught Draco off guard, if he said yes he’d look possessive and if he said no he’d look like he didn’t care about Harry’s wellbeing. Or at least he knew that’s how the newspapers would spin it.
“Oh. Right. Why am I in your house?” Draco didn’t quite believe it was a dream—everything was too defined for that—but he couldn’t process how he’d got here at all. The last thing he remembered was…
True to his word, Harry had patched up the bookcase and the books were more or less in the right order. Draco counted six that weren’t.
“Because I don’t know what you are building. You say you have the eye but how do I know that? How do I know you aren’t leading me around so you can kill me?” He hadn’t really thought about it before voicing it but now it was a very sudden reality.
It was barely work. For all Potter grumbled though, it was as though he was doing a life sentence - and it wasn't him who had to cobble together retribution speeches for a stadium-wide audience at arse o' clock in the morning.
They were allowed to move around, of course, but when you worked alongside people, you usually ate alongside them too. It wasn’t out of any sort of grudge on Hermione’s part, but she was in work from at least 9-5 and that included her break times. She couldn’t discuss work outside of the Ministry for security reasons, and even if she did, neither Ron nor Harry would care that much.
He stopped tracing Harry’s hand, instead lifting his palm up to his cheek, leaning upwards to press a kiss to his lips, soft at first, before letting himself sink into the feeling. “I forgive you for moving my books.” Draco mumbled against his lips.
The beach house was pleasent, ignoring the air of forgotten Grandma the decor seemed to suggest. The bay windows opened wide, out to the foaming waves, and the sea air blew in from the rocky coves, hanging low and salty in the air. Draco found himself turning to Narcissa, who immoderately set her newspaper in her lap, laying her hands daintily atop the image moving atop the front page.
Draco quirked an eyebrow, clearly amused. He didn't even wear cloaks to the office, hated them so much, in fact that he'd rather get formally reprimanded for dress code every time rather than just... come in in work robes. Honestly. The nerve of him.
“Quidditch.” Harry lied, thinking about how he had been caught sneaking onto the training ground on his lunch hour. Why am I in a broom cupboard?” If it were anyone else Harry would have jumped on the defensive but Draco, while clean, wasn’t in any fit state to kidnap him. He had dark circles under his eyes, almost purple in the low light coming from the single candle-case hanging from the ceiling. “Don’t you ever get any sleep?”
The tree stood, still and tall in the waning light, its leaves moving from time to time with the steady breeze. Draco had taken to watching the sunset more, the sky open and free above him as he picked bits of foliage from the branches. He’d been doing it since first year and had never really found a good time to stop.
“I don’t have chocolate on my face do I?” Harry said as he lent against the desk that was acting as their portkey.
“You think Robards’ is capable of whatever you do? Seriously?” Harry was skeptical. “And there’s no evidence. You found your stuff in your lab.”
“I can’t just not do anything until this is lifted. I have a life. Oh god what if Draco proposes and I do something stupid? What if the department make fun of him because he’s with
Weak sunlight didn't so much stream through the window as it did jump. By Draco's body clock, it was dark and then it wasn't, there hadn't been an early morning in between any of it. A weight shifted in the bed that certainly wasn't him and he almost yelled.
It would have rolled out of the door if not for the lone glove that barricaded it in. He breathed out, running a hand through his hair as he realised a single blue ball of latex that had missed the bin yesterday evening might have just saved his job.
Well, his wife knew now didn't she. "Hah." He mumbled sleepily to himself as he wiped away the drool that had collected on his pillow.
"Uh..." Harry's cheeks turned blush pink. Draco suspected if he could move the birds nest that just about passed for hair out of the way, the tips of his ears would be pink too. "It's laundry day."
“So, this one is the numbing solution.” Draco sloshed an orange substance around in the phial before pulling the stopper. What had formally presented itself as a warm gelatinous goo was now fluid, thanks to Draco testing and retesting types of numbing agent and ratios of magical interference.
He was squinting up at him, glancing from Draco’s white face to the branch and back. His eyes narrowed when he looked back at Draco. “How do I know this isn’t a trick?”
Draco nodded. The desk clicked, the whole thing popping open like the desk of a Victorian schoolchild. His lips pressed together in a thin line, the pink of his lips whitening around the edges. “No going back now.”
“Charm troubles?” Hermione levitated her shopping onto the counter so she could put her hands - balled into determined fists - on her hips. “Is that a euphemism?”
“Why me?” His voice came out whiny and infantile. Draco bit his lip. “Fine. Why do you want him, again?”
All he knew was he felt safer in Grimmauld Place than he ever had anywhere else and whether it was the house welcoming him as a member of it’s family or Harry’s presence, Draco wasn’t going to argue with it.
Obediently, Draco felt around his temples and ran his hand through his hair. He heard a soft swear word come from the end of the bed, ignoring it in favour of the feeling of his hands in his scalp. “Maybe.” Draco shrugged.
“What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.” Draco didn’t even look up as he placed the eye in a stable mix of solutions on his desk. His notes were stacked neatly, at least an inch thick with information crammed onto the pages as if he’d run out of paper.
She cut him off, pointing a finger at him. “Yes. And Draco’s going to have to hold off on… Never mind that, you were supposed to write that speech for the Minister - a month ago, Harry, don’t go blaming that on the curse - and it was Draco who saved you from possibly being fired! It was important!”
Draco opened his eyes, moonstones in every aspect; wide and granite grey. His lips parted and in those seconds he turned into a painting. He was marble until he started giggling, a laugh bubbling up from so deep in his stomach that his head ended up falling forward, his whole body shaking. “Drunk, Potter? Are you mad?”
Draco tried to look offended but his heart just wasn’t in it. “I wouldn’t work on your eyes for the good of the world or the glory of the Ministry. While I was learning about Project EYE I was… doing some things on the side. Did you hear nothing of my rant in my lab?”
He works on what he'll say to her instead - how it's probably inconvenient to drop by, how he can smell the pumpkin pasties cooking in the oven... He sees Draco drop his knitting needles, a deer in the headlights as he sits, clutching the blanket to his chest - looking for all he's worth like he wants to be clutching an Invisibility Cloak.
“No.” Harry was so glad to have his wand back from the dratted wand-box as he floated plates of casserole through the partition.
So much that after five minutes Draco stopped, swinging around on his toes so fast that Harry almost barrelled into him.
“Either you’re going to convince him to work with me or you’re going to give him a dressing down because he used his paid leave to bully Robards into letting him do paperwork.” Draco curled his fingers into quotation marks.
“Oh.” Draco hesitated. “Is that all you want me for? Because if I misread anything…” he stepped away, hands clasped at his front.
Harry had simply rested his chin in the dip between Draco’s neck and shoulder, taking in the scent of lavender shampoo.
He'd told himself this about going to see Lucius and Narcissa in their summer house in Brittany, yet, somehow, here he was.
“Oh God.” Harry brought his hands up to his face, peering through his fingers as if to check that Draco hadn’t disappeared. “I tried to stick the umbrella stand to the floor so we wouldn’t keep tripping over it. Well, so
Harry sealed the charm shut again as he watched Robards’ figure come closer, no doubt shouting something obscene at Harry as he dived between the people with clipboards that were clustered in small groups around the windows. He only glanced back once, his stupid eyes converting the lab coats to snowballs of white amidst the greying afternoon sky.
anything are you?” The mirror gleamed in the early afternoon sun as Draco leant towards it, a contraption in his hand that looked like a torture device but, apparently was just for his eyebrows.
The ball, which they’d been so graciously invited to attend, was an illustrious occasion that couldn’t really be turned down -
“Offensive weapon my arse. It’s not a gun, it’s useful. If they really wanted to bring about change maybe they could stop equipping the damn things with offensive spells. Make them like the Unforgivables.”
“I guess I always knew people were different but I didn’t really question any of it. The rich were born rich and the poor were born poor, that was just how the world worked. I didn’t realise anyone believed otherwise, I didn’t understand why they would. So when the war broke out I was just... mainly confused.”
He really couldn't bear to look up, his cheeks burned whenever Harry spoke, especially in those soft, soothing tones. Especially after a couple of nights ago when he-. No. If he didn't think about it, it would go away.
Draco jerked his head in the direction of the newspaper that had been pasted onto a bulletin board with a poorly applied sticking charm. "In the prophet. Do you reckon we should?"
“Sure you aren’t. You just climbed a tree to watch Potter for no reason in fifth year.” Pansy wasn’t even looking at him as her bob fell forward, concentrating wholeheartedly on fingerprint-dusting. “And you waxed lyrical about him for two hours in the pub.”
Draco turned over reluctantly and was greeted with a kiss on the forehead. “I suppose I’ll be able to squeeze in another invention or two... If you give me enough love.”
For the most part, he was thankful to have the manor to himself. The only thing that had really changed was the House Elf Tax, but he had enough money to cover that. Provided he pretended to shake Potter's hand in solidarity - discretely washing it quite vigorously afterwards - and as long as he didn't overdo it at Ministry functions.
“The directory?” Draco laughed. “Yeah, okay.” Draco hadn’t picked up on Harry’s stumbling, over the unsaid words caught in his throat. The only time, in all the years Harry had known him, that he wasn’t in some state of paranoia over the
“He was an inventor. Muggle-Born, not that it matters.” Draco rolled over to face Harry, who was watching him intensely.
Hermione and Ron (after some sharp words from his wife) went to help, joined quickly by Hannah Abbot and Ernie McMillon.
He heard the sound of her thin heels before he saw the rest of her. Pansy had kept her A-line bob and her severe frown, but her wardrobe choice had become much more conservative since she’d landed a high end business partnership with a Muggleborn investor in Japan.
“Have you ever looked at someone and thought am I a dumbass?” Harry said out of the blue as he watched Draco mix another ingredient into a glass bottle—an already hazy lilac liquid starting to emerge—while he was cross-legged on his carpet
His eyes were bright and his arm was slung around his friends. His hair was glossy, catching the light of the lense. His chin was a little less pointed when he laughed. He looked, for once in his life, like the angel his mother said she thought he was.
Draco was a lot of things. He was intelligent. He laughed loudly. He was oddly chivalrous when he was trying not to impress people he hated. Draco was a full, realised person, all sharp edges and fine lines.
“Oh my god, we’re late, how are we late!” Harry couldn’t tell whether it was Molly or Hermione who had spoken, amid the hustle and bustle of already assembled guests.
All fell silent as the wind started to pick up, the whistling of the trees the only sound through the shining churchyard.
What he wanted to understand, he wasn’t sure. Reaching out, Harry carded his fingers through Draco’s hair as an alternative to thinking.
He turned back to the line guiltily as it shuffled forward, the hot food calling to him, aggressively reminding him that he’d skipped breakfast.
Their foreheads pressed together, a single, perfect moment, trapped at the end of the most disastrous week of Harry’s life.
While Draco was in his element at functions, any event that required him to be anything other than perfectly manicured made him feel like a fish out of water. He was overdressed, he could tell, looking at Ron and Harry in jeans next to his pressed trousers and slightly open button up shirt.
"Shit." He scrambled back, lifting the quilt over his shoulders as he did so. "I am not prepared for this."
“It was the acetone.” Draco said in a deadpan, watching Harry’s face change to one of horror before Draco giggled. “I love you but if I was to poison you, you think I would put the poison on my own lips?”
“You have a bit of a lump on the back of the head.” Draco abandoned his shoes in favour of kneeling behind Harry, positioning his knees in between the floorboards so he was hovering over Harry’s right calf. “Let me look at it at least.”
Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second before deciding to stand, leaning over the table in order to place a hesitant kiss at Draco’s temple. “Sorry.”
“Oh never-mind I’m sure it’ll be delightful.” Pansy rolled her arms before trying to engage Harry in a conversation she obviously didn’t want.
“It fell off the table..” Harry missed a beat, tearing his eyes from Draco to check the clock above their heads, the one mounted above the brick wall of the fireplace.
As the clock let out another loud reverberation Draco placed the eye in it’s box - all the while feeling the dread that came with locking a small animal in a cage.
“Oh no-” he whispered as the tablecloth disentangled swiftly from his trousers only to end up on the floor: multiple entrees crashing down with it.
“What, like I have my whole weekend?” Harry grimaced as he lowered his head onto the table, Draco pressing his palm in circles in between his shoulder blades.
“It’s not for me!” He nodded towards Harry who was twisting his engagement ring around his finger nervously.
"I'm sorry I'm reshaping  your blanket." The blanket rises in the air and Harry sees the evident join in the fabric, the way the two shades of green don't quite match up. His face breaks into a smile as he watches Draco's delicate fingers weave stuttering patterns in the air, the knitting needles in front of his face following suit.
Someone said “cheese” and he thought it was the funniest phrase on earth. Who, upon being asked to smile, said cheese? Draco threw his head back in merriment and chose, in that moment, to be happy.
“What…” for a second Harry was thrown, swallowing as he looked down at Draco’s mussed fringe and spiderweb eyelids.
“Oculus Reparo.” this one did nothing but shock Harry’s fingers, his wand wavering as he tried to concentrate on the now blurry foreground that was his hand. Another explosion hit a rock a few metres away and Harry dropped his already mangled glasses into the dirt so he could roll into a ball. “Shit.”
"Why? Think I'm going to sell you out to the Prophet?"Draco was sure his already slight blush darkened to a maroon. Maybe a scarlet, he definitely wouldn't look out of place in the room he was in: all deep reds and bright golds. "Sorry." Harry said, "that was probably in poor taste."
He knows this will always be his house, that he'll always be welcome here, but no matter the love Molly has for him he doesn't really want to run into Ginny, It'll feel like he's trespassing. More than sneaking down the halls ever will.
Molly smiles at Draco, gently. A fragile smile that may break if it's disturbed. She lifts her wand and Harry watches the wool slide back onto the needles, the double stitch neatly unpicking itself. Draco doesn't look away from Harry, the blush rising up his cheeks involuntarily, although he does try to stop it, with growing difficulty.
It had rotated to fix itself to him. Staring, blue and unblinking as he tried to grapple with what he was seeing. Sure, magic: but what kind? It certainly wasn’t still attached to it’s user in any way: from what Draco understood, he was long dead.
“Ginny’s going in the car with Ms. Parkinson.” Molly sniffed, sticking her nose in the air slightly as she shooed Harry out of the door. “I don’t know why she chose to go with her instead of us but…”
just for you to tell me to use a Muggle solvent?” Harry spoke slowly, deliberately trying to keep his tone even.
Andrew comes back from his break, raising his eyebrows at Draco before he's whirled away into the crowd, the music starting up again, although with less poise.
Harry reached to touch the pores on his cheek before pulling his hand back right before he touched him.
The canteen was loud and hot as Harry made his way to the front of the queue. It snaked from the kitchens, weaving around the tables and chairs before stopping at the mouth of the building.
“I don’t like it much myself, Potter but what Robards wants Robards gets.” Draco’s neutrally disapproving face disintegrated into that of a sour lemon. Before Harry could answer, they were gone.
Shaklebolt’s smile was brief. “I heard our Head Auror can’t do his speech… as his partner he must have at least read it to you, could you...?” The Minister let the question hang in the air.
Harry didn’t have to think about what he meant, but Draco said it anyway. Softly, his voice cracking as he looked up at the ceiling.
The man nodded understandingly and Draco looked away while he shuffled through his trouser pocket for his wallet, just in case.
Draco had owned flat above the bookshop for a number of years before Potter came back into his life, quite allusively at that.
Draco brought his mother flowers every Sunday and cleaned her countertops when she didn’t have the energy to haul herself into the kitchen. He’d use the killing curse if it meant keeping Narcissa Malfoy safe.
Draco moved on. He knew there was nothing he could do to make up for the past. The best thing he could do was this.
“No need for that, now.” Arthur’s voice cracked as he swept Harry up into a hug that was just as tight as Molly’s had been.
He was surrounded by bottles and notes and “Hermione gave me a sleep potion. Turns out I can read my own writing when my wrist isn’t shaking from constant insomnia. I figured out where I went wrong.” He grinned like he’d won a prize and Harry couldn’t help but ask him if he wanted a hug.
He didn’t have to explain. Harry just nodded. He went to sit on the sofa instead. “So, please explain my living room?”
Hermione got to the pub when the sky had already blackened. Harry was most certainly drunk. More drunk than he’d ever been in his life, he assumed, as he watched the floor sway under his feet and the sky splinter into stars.
And she couldn’t have Harry coming into her house just to leave again, with Draco Malfoy of all people. So they sat.
A hand flew to his face, even though the dark was closing in fast enough for it to be unnecessary if he just unlit his wand. “What the hell are you
A dusting of light beer froth coated his top lip as he made a considerable effort to refrain from saying anything else that would set him off again.
“Broke my glasses, sir.” Harry jerked his head back to where a single arm was poking out of the rubble he’d kicked up.
His eyes strayed to the thick, grey blankets perched on the back of the chair propped by the door. Harry smiled briefly before he caught his reflection bouncing in and out of focus on the windowpane as the dazzling street lamps glittered on the London skyline.
“And if it doesn’t work? If I render your best Hit Wizard blind?” Draco almost spat the words, refusing to come in, to sit down, to have a glass of water, Draco, please.
Harry fiddled with the black handkerchief in his breast pocket as everyone else turned to watch Draco.
“Damn him. I can’t believe he didn’t even look at my list!” She darted into the kitchen, kneeling down close to the grate.
He thought he was doing quite well at not asking his best mate about Draco’s ring choices when the pubs side door creaked open.
“Do you understand how concerned my mother was when she found out I liked people other than girls?” There was a dry type of lilt to his voice, as if he was trying - and failing - to lighten the mood at the dismal turn in conversation.
Even with all the planning and double checking, things were bound to go wrong. Harry had mumbled this to Draco in a number of soothing tones as his financé stressed over timing, even though they both knew with an absolute certainty Draco was going to be
“All of them?” Draco’s eyebrows disappeared to his hairline as he imagined the disarray of a multiple shelf pile up, blinking in surprise at the small, silent grief he felt for torn spines.
He stared at the shoes and the stain underneath with loathing. The colours weren’t that different - it was a black floor after all - but Harry was quite a bit closer to it than he had been in previous months and he could see where the stain of the wood had chipped away and how the glue-like substance of the sticking charm had clung to the shoes, almost a perfect black outline against the tobacco coloured wood.
He pushed it away, focusing on the curl gently pressing up against his nose instead. “I mean the surgery.”
“Uh, yeah.” Harry stood dripping on his bedroom floor, a towel around his waist. “Can you both leave? I need to get dressed.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed. “What did you do then? You wouldn’t shut me in a cupboard if you didn’t do something.”
“Malfoy?” Harry’s voice was hesitant, peering around the bookshelves as if he was expecting a confrontation with a startled unicorn.
”You’ve made me feel more secure than ever before, Harry. If we can get through this, we can get through other things...”
“You’re upset.” Harry had clocked it at the time Draco had started tapping, he did it when he was frustrated. He’d noticed it when he awoke in Harry’s house, an automatic reaching of his hand to the bedside table. Tap first, wake later.
“Harry’s lost his voice.” Draco laughed easily, “so I’m going to be doing most of the talking tonight.”
“Because Harry is the best at what he does.” Kingsley held up a hand. “I would want nothing less than the best for him. That’s where you come in.”
Harry lifted his newly mangled glasses from the dirt, carrying them between his thumb and forefinger as he inched himself off the field. An explosion sounded as he crouched behind a rock to fiddle with his glasses in peace.
When Harry was finally able to think again he remembered Kingsley. “Shaklebolt called the house phone by the way. It was along the lines of Robards being put on permanent suspension?”
“Are you just being vain or are you genuinely interested?” Draco’s eyebrow rose, unconvincingly from where he lay in the leaves.
"Potter." Draco nods stiffly, but he continues to play. As if Harry's hands aren't currently covering his own, as if the warmth doesn't send such a shock through his body that he almost trips on the chorus.
The red socks were an accidental homage to his house - although Draco would have been appalled if he’d seen him in them.
Harry interlocked their fingers as Draco traced the light scarring on the back of his hands. “Together?” he supplied absentmindedly.
“I don’t think he’s able to concoct anything remotely near what I’m trying to do but that’s not really the point is it? It doesn’t have to add up it just has to be believable enough for me to be demoted at least.”
He never saw himself like this. And Harry had decided to put it on his bookcase. So he could watch Draco laugh over and over again.
Harry's been saying this for a week, and Draco is, for some reason - relenting. Or at least he isn't protesting. He can feel his feet move forward and his hand in Harry's pocket. It's warm, smooth from what he can feel through his gloves. He wants to feel it wrapped around his waist, like it was in the hall that night.
“There’s nothing to say about that.” Draco turned so his hipbone was digging into the sofa seat. “I was a bad person.”
Harry dragged his hand down his face, ignoring the scratch of two day old stubble. “You learned this from Hermione, I suppose?”
Harry rolled his eyes, smiling for a camera that was pushed in his face before the reporter went off to find another hapless victim. “Into what? I can’t promise everything but I won’t blow up the Ministry.”
Draco was sure Lucius was trying for something cunning, but since Draco didn't know what it was, he just nodded.
”-and the lady and gentleman.” The Pastor added for the convenience of Mr and Mrs Granger - who blushed profusely.
Draco Malfoy's eyes are cast downward, toward the keys, not even looking up to the scrap of music paper perched on the piano's ledge. Harry catches the sparkling greys as Draco's eyes search out the keys. The roiling sea of emotion emitting from just below the surface pours into every  note.
It took Harry all of two minutes to deliberate between a bacon roll and the egg salad. He pushed his tray onto the cramped table next to Ron. “Where’s ‘Mione?”
“And yes, actually.” Harry was still talking. “I read every one of my school books under the covers with a torch the first year. It was like stepping into fantasy-land. You can’t imagine how boring maths was in primary for me to actively want to read things.”
“His wife… She was a St. Mungo’s nurse. He noticed her hands were chapped when she came back from surgery. He invented rubber gloves. Specifically for her. I can’t believe you didn’t know about it but then again, not your area of expertise. It’s one of my favourite quotes.”
He found it relaxing, the waxy feel of the leaves coming through his fingers. The solitude was a bonus; maybe this was how Potter felt when he was alone.
After half a minute Draco leaned back on his hands, and he felt Harry pull away. His hair was sticking to the back of his neck and Harry's was more mussed than Draco had ever seen it. His lip quirked as he looked at Harry, dishevelled and bright eyed.
They stared, incredulous. The desk was organised; neat piles of parchment pushed against the edges of the inside of it, while phials of liquids were cuddled together in a box. The eye was front and centre. It looked up from the jar of saline solution it was sat in.
He sighed, realising he'd eventually have to contribute to the conversation going on over his head. "No. Thank you very much. I do not need anyone to accompany me to my mother's summer home I'm very capable of using an International Floo Connection."
He looked Ron in the eye as he swallowed the rest of his bun. “Why’s it always food with you? I’d feel less disturbed if you were having an affair.”
Draco’s dress shoes were immaculate when he’d gotten them, a low heeled leather dress shoe with a patent square toe. They were quite nice to look at, really. Or they had been. The problem was, Draco had put them on the shoe rack by the door before he’d left for Belfast, because it was practical.
The note was taped to the cake plate and Draco read as he whirled his wand around the kitchen, looking up only when he misjudged the placement of the pack of sausage, leaving the note to rescue them from the floor.
“No.” Eventually he just pulled it over his head, tossing it into the laundry basket with a satisfied sound. “Maybe I’ve been cursed.”
Of course, it had a few wards, but they'd been coming to Brittany since Draco was four, and Narcissa had only made this her permanent residence after Draco had turned eighteen. He knew the wards inside out, which was lucky considering he wouldn't put it past his father to do such a thing.
"Are you always going to be so smart when someone shows you genuine emotional connection?” Harry waved a hand dismissively, he wasn’t about to get into all that now. “Would you like me to prove it to you?" Harry's eyes searched Draco's face when he shrugged. Whatever he found there was obviously enough, because not a minute later, a brown hand was cupping Draco's chin, thumb and forefinger resting either side of his cheeks in a delicate bowl.
Including Harry coming there most nights instead of going back to Grimmauld Place. Sometimes popping in in the morning too, if he could.
The latex of the newly issued mandate gloves didn’t allow it to respond at all. He’d spent countless nights trying until he finally pulled them off in a huff, wadding them into a tight ball, which he watched unravel as they went sailing through the air. Then the eye had wriggled.
He leaned up into him, his throat a long, angular line as he craned up to meet Harry where he was kneeling on the bed, his hair falling gently over his face as he lent down to capture Draco in another kiss.
Hermione nodded gratefully. “Thankfully this curse doesn’t involve your untimely death so you just need to fulfill the conditions.” She scribbled frantically as she spoke, her pencil scratching quietly on the back of a piece of discarded parchment. “We have bigger problems than your love life you know.”
Harry found Draco draped over a statue of the French president - in France - at the foot of an out of date portkey, with drool dripping steadily onto the path beneath him.
“Harry?” Draco sounded worried, but he wasn’t really surprised, given the circumstances. “Is there supposed to be water coming through the carpet?”
”Harry.” Draco said after a minute. Speaking as seriously as he could while also trying to keep his composure.
The clock in the hall let out an almighty gong and Draco jumped, clamping his hands over the eye as he did so. It squirmed like a trapped spider beneath his palms as he headed for the cabinet by the wall, easing the metal box open with an elbow.
Draco was seated at the kitchen table, his hands shaking around a warm mug of tea. It had been hot but for the last ten minutes it had remained untouched, being slowly cooled by the roaring wind that was coming through the cracks in a window pane.
As Draco’s feet left the floor all he could think about was the way he wished to be whisked into a fictional world, once apon a time.
“Oh no you can not.” Draco lost the colour in his face. “I’m not having any obscene quotes splashed across the Prophet just yet. You’re going to have to pretend you’ve lost your voice.”
Draco sighed, shrugging a little, his black lab coat falling from a shoulder, “even without my detest for Hit Wizards, Potter included, this is the only specimen of its kind.”
Draco nodded, immediately tense until the hands went in, rooting around for a swelling. He sunk into the feeling.
The Prophet have had a lot  to say on the matter, as per usual, but neither of them have taken to reading the Prophet since Skeeter's eminent collapse. Draco focuses on the blanket. It's a deep jade green, hints of his own lemongrass cologne lacing in with Harry's signature smell.
sort of us that came right before a break-up. This us was soft. A domestic sort of us. The finality to it more of a beginning than an end.
“You’ve rubbed off on me.” Harry said in a way of response. He then ruined it by adding “or it could have been Hermione.”
“They’re creepy because they’re supposed to trap the devil, God, it’s like you never even read A History Of Magic.” Potter cracked a smile.
In lieu of an answer, Draco yawned, flipped over and grabbed the pillow from behind his head, tossing it in the general direction of the owner of the voice. "Go away!"
Draco fiddled with the water glass before giving it to Harry. He gulped, spreading his hands wide. “I’m really nervous.”
The man had gone to work this morning in mismatched socks because he’d chucked the other one in the dryer for Merlins sake! (The dryer that had only been installed because Harry wrinkled his nose at extended cleaning charms.)
“He was snooping around the other day, calling me some names. The usual. But I’m more focused on the other stuff.”
“When you put it like that it does sound bad. But you saw how your arm reacted and that eye is almost an exact working model of a human eye.”
“Oh no.” Harry whispered, his scraper clattering to the floor in favour of his wand. “Tergeo!” The cleaning spell helped as far as drying the floor went but he would have to get closer to the sink if he wanted to fix the leak.
He watched with a mix of horror and fascination as the eye rolled over itself, leaving a slug like trail around the lip of his desk before teetering on the edge. He made a grab for it and missed, the eye plummeting to the floor with barely a sound.
Whoever had carved the piece had obviously used a photo of Harry that had been taken very early in the morning; his eyes were tired and his hair was even more of a bird's nest than usual.
Breathing more slowly he tried again. “You’re offering me a solution. I'm not just going to walk away from that. I considered it and the pros outweigh the cons.”
The figure that she'd previously hidden flickered across the front page, stopping in the centre to fix on Draco. Big, brown eyes stared out from the page, like an owl, sizing up it's prey.
Now, with leaden feet Harry dragged himself through his own door only to send the umbrella stand flying and, in haste to get away from the falling umbrella stand, managed to fall over the shoes that were still well and truly stuck to the floor.
“So, what is it? Do I have to break the curse with a kiss?” Harry wiggled his eyebrows. “Am I going to have to propose to the love of my life?”
He heard Harry’s voice catch as he pointed his wand downward, and instantly jerked his hand backward. “I- it was a lighting charm.” Before he could change his mind a “Lumos” had been cast and Harry’s face was awash with light.
He did this for a few moments before Harry broke the silence; it was easier to talk while staring at the sink bottom.
Harry grabbed the blankets, the knot in his chest tightening as he yelled through the house; “Have either of you seen my shoes!”
Draco had been in Belfast for almost a week, ironing out Muggle/Wizard relations between England and the Celtic Nations. Supposedly, according to Draco, it was the Muggle/Muggle relations they needed to be more worried about.
As he was shucking off his trousers to get into bed Harry asked why Draco had come home early - He would have known if anything had been cancelled.
He didn’t realise he was holding his breath until Harry sat down. “Have you tried getting your broom?”
Everything was fuzzy around the edges, if he squinted a bit he could almost, almost pretend Lark actually did wear glasses after all.
Draco tipped his head back, panting as his heart hammered in his chest. He closed his eyes, listening to the small sounds of the night.
“I guess so.” Came the muffled reply. “But never let me do it again, you’re an awful lab rat, you twitch.”
“I’ve missed you.” Harry said softly, fog misting out of his mouth as he slipped the ring onto Draco’s finger, barely looking at his knuckles. Instead he counted all the shades of grey in Draco’s eyes as snow shook down from the trees.
Harry felt like he should be uncomfortable about this tenuous friendship - a bridge formed by a mutual hatred of authority, while simultaneously needing a job.
The silence was too much. “Do you believe wands are offensive weapons?” The question came from nowhere but Harry needed to know. Once again, like a lot of things with Draco these days, what he got was not what he expected.
He lit another cigarette, having barely let the first drop to the pavement as he ground the butt in with his heel, grimacing at the ash residue the wind insisted on imparting up the back of his shoe.
Draco sat up, hitting his head on the bed frame as he did so and for one horrible moment he was back in the manor. But Voldemort’s voice didn’t ever sound as honey-sweet, the cadence dipping down like oaken wood. Bright yellow to a deep rich brown. He struggled to open his eyes.
?” Ron was so shocked it seemed he’d forgotten to call the man Malfoy for the first time in his life. “I thought your frantic scrambling was about the Black portrait.”
He was roaring drunk, his arm slung loosely around Pansy’s. Someone had taken a camera out. He didn’t know who. He didn’t particularly care.
They entered the atrium without any surprising mishaps. Harry even landed on his feet as he shot from the floo in the back of the room.
Easing himself out of the cupboard, back-end first, Harry grabbed onto the bottle as if it was a lifeline, conveniently ignoring the dripping that had started above his head.
“If you weren’t such a good Hit Wizard those eyes would be your downfall.” Robards’ was talking to Harry’s back. By the end of his sentence Harry was across the grass and ripping a hole in the charm against the door.
“If I told you it wouldn’t be a mystery.” Draco rolled his eyes before yawning. “I was tired, Potter. I’ve been awake since four trying to perfect that.”
“Yes.” There was no hesitation and no follow up, Draco’s eyes intent on the cranking of the handle under his desk, his other palm splayed across its surface.
He’d gone suit shopping with Blaise three months ago, and they’d both picked out some shade of green.
“That’s it.” Draco announced. “As soon as we leave I’m going to force you to watch me make this Sight Solution. I’ll get it right this time.”
“If he’s looking at your feet he’s a trollop anyway.” Ron laughed, opening the door to a small gaggle of people that had gathered on Harry’s doorstep.
A short intake of breath from the both of them has Harry ready to startle back - whisper an 'I'm sorry' and bolt for the nearest exit. But there are eyes on them now, and Draco's hands are so, so cold.
Ron nodded to the back of the hall where the Level Fours usually sat, his freckles shifting from red to blonde under the sunlight streaming from the windows. Hermione, indeed, sat with them, instead of with the Level Sixes like she usually did.
Harry laughed, the sound cutting through the still night, Draco laughing with him, shoulders shaking heartilly until he fell from the tree.
“Are you mocking me?” Harry swung his legs over the side of the chair and Draco pushed his plate off his lap.
“Maybe.” Harry still didn’t believe it but he chose to keep his thoughts to himself. He’d watched Draco go through about six different emotions in the past ten minutes and the one he chose now was anger, slamming glass bottles into bags as if they were unbreakable.
Harry made a face at Draco’s back as he yanked another gold-flaking door open. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?” He gasped.
No wands in the cafeteria. No wands in the paperwork rooms unless they were in a box by the desk. No wands in the Atrium. Offensive weaponry causes terror attacks printed on black metal signs above all the doors. Harry wondered how Draco felt about it before recoiling. No one deserved to feel sorry for that bastard, least of all him.
Harry made his way over to the bed, yawning a little as he sat down, taking off his shirt more smoothly than he had in the last week.
“It’s not exactly intentional. Sir. But if you haven’t noticed, we don’thave access to anything better than those.” Harry jerked his thumb in a general backwards direction, even though his glasses were half buried in ash. “Now, since I can’t see, can I go off field?” Harry bit the inside of his cheek to stop himself from grinning. He couldn’t see Robards’ face but he could guess it wasn’t amused.
know anyway?” Harry narrowed his eyes at his friend, who laughed. He genuinely wondered whether Ron would be so cruel as to prank him with something like this.
They’d been going back and forth on the issue for long enough that they were both getting progressively more annoyed with the other.
“As if you could ever be sure with her.” Harry glared pointedly at Romilda. She stood behind the counter with the sour face of a school matron. One black eyebrow arched, her red-lipped mouth in a permanent pout. Her clear gloves shimmered tightly against her slim wrists, her wand shoved through the middle of her wild hair.
Unfortunately, the door was also practical and Harry slammed it into the shoe rack almost constantly. In hindsight, he should have moved the shoe rack. Instead, he’d just left it where it was and vowed to put all the shoes back in their rightful places before Draco got home.
They were all placed in the middle of the third shelf in such an obviously ordered way, jutting out from their usual pushed-back state, that Draco couldn’t help looking at the spines. Intrigued, he fumbled for his reading glasses, cursing softly when he realised he’d left them on the nightstand. Not that they’d really do him any good.
“I’ve wanted to do this since fifth year.” Harry mumbled against Draco’s lips before flopping onto his back again.
“Honestly.” Draco tapped the counter as he waited for the kettle—the longest three minutes of his life. “Does she think I’m incompetent without a wand in my hand?”
Ron grinned before fixing his gaze on Hermione, his eyes going bright and soft all at the same time as he watched her pop a piece of lettuce in her mouth before taking a stack of folders under one arm, her wedding ring glinting in the light as she moved. “Never.”
He’d been relegated to the back office where, officially, he’d been filing paperwork. In reality he’d been making paper aeroplanes while waiting for his new glasses to come in. They’d arrived on his desk at ten to two that afternoon and he’d barely shut up about being able to see again before Hermione had brought up the wand conversation.
He slipped back into his seat as soon as Draco was standing at the makeshift altar, nodding to Narcissa before he sat.
"Have you seen mother anywhere? I'd like to see her before dinner, if that's quite alright." Draco cringed at himself. He knew the way he spoke wasn't brilliant but here it just seemed to get worse, especially in the presence of his parents. He suspected it was because there was no-one there to correct him. (Or, as Harry had once so eloquently told him: "You sound poncey, cut it out".)
Harry shifted almost imperceptibly in his seat by the fire as Draco’s diamond white hair settled in a halo on one arm of the couch. A second later, he swung his legs up too, so that the back of his knees rested against the other arm, socked feet dangling over the side.
He half-listened to the kettle clank a bit as he cracked the spine of whatever novel he had at hand - he rarely cared about the title, just being whisked into a fictional world was good enough for him.
It was Draco's turn to quirk an eyebrow. He and his mother were playing such a petty game but it was better than airing their dirty laundry to the neighbours. Neither of them were ones for shouting; Lucius did quite enough shouting for the both of them.
“I also couldn’t find cake, so you’ll have to make do with transfigured, slightly over buttered crumpets.” He cleared their plates and whisked two more in from the back room labelled
The words blurred together and he heard himself huff in annoyance, biting back another irritating sound that cut through the bliss of his concentration.
“The one you give Draco. Constantly.” Ron shrugged before asking Hermione if she’d packed a sandwich.
He threw his arms around Molly, ducking so she could loop her arms around his neck. Her hair was coiled loosely around her face, a greying gold that caught the weak sunlight streaming through the living room blinds.
"Will-will you..." Harry stumbles over his words as he reaches his hands back from the piano, aware of the eyes on his back, Draco whines at the sudden loss of warmth.
The Potions Room was a small room off to their left, embossed with a black nameplate bearing the same name. Draco had hardly glanced at it, purposely sitting as far away from the place as humanly possible.
“If I had jurisdiction to fire you I would have you out on your ear.” Robards had shifted backwards, closer to the door, even though Draco had his wand pointed intently at the eye, magnifying parts of it so he could note down things he couldn’t immediately see.
He didn’t really need this, he was in therapy, he’d dealt with all that. But if it helped Draco, come to terms with some things in the process, he didn’t mind raking up the past just a little more.
Draco thinks about his father, a flash of a memory - and then blackness. He shakes his head decisively, clasping Harry's hand more tightly, hoping to push his emotions out, through the bond between their clasped palms.
Draco presses the blanket to his nose, breathing in Harry's scent long after he's gone. It's been a month and neither of them have broached the subject of what to call they're little affair.
He must have been missing Draco more than he thought he was, if he was thinking in his speech patterns. Maybe he needed more sleep than he’d originally thought.
Ron looked offended. “If Hermione ever cooks in this house, with or without the help of magic, call St. Mungo’s from the nearest telephone box because we won’t have a house any more.” Ron said, digging into the food.
Robards didn’t look angry, which was usually worse. He sighed heavily, dragging his hand down his face in a gesture that he seemed to reserve solely for Harry. “Potter, what the hell?”
Harry pushes his head into Draco's neck, letting him take the lead as they weave in and out of the crowd. "I liked the previous pianist much better."
“Well sure,” Harry’s mouth crinkled into a smile at the memory. “I have great friends and family-” (Draco didn’t have to ask if he meant the Weasley’s) “and you.”
“Of course, he seemed to be concerned you would set the house on fire or some such nonsense.” Draco looked towards his bedside unit.
“Parchment, Draco. It’s the thing I’m currently testing for fingerprints because you’re not only bizarre, but possibly paranoid.” Pansy held up the yellowing paper as if it were irrefutable proof that everything she said was true. “Shaklebolt wouldn’t fire you he’s like… weirdly nice to you.”
“She just left? She didn’t want to talk about it, you know, try to make it work?” Draco asked, mildly surprised.
Draco paused in his aimless wandering, his attention pulled by a lone figure walking the pathways of the indoor botanical gardens. Setting down his now empty glass, he silently slid the door open and stepped inside, taking a deep breath of the mixture of floral scents designed to encourage tranquility and relaxation.
"I'm sorry Harry." Draco's voice was hushed but he did not speak with frailty or weakness Harry expected of someone who was dying.
"Harry, Scorpius means the world to me. He gave me a reason to live, to keep fighting. You are everything a parent should be Harry. You're understanding, smart, kind, brave: everything I want Scorpius to grow up to be. What I am trying to say is that if I named you as Scorpius' godfather, would you raise him for me?"
Tilting Draco’s head back so it rested against his chest, Harry pressed a simple kiss to the tip of Draco’s ear.
"No he doesn't." Ron countered, "I ran in Parkinson in the club. She told me Draco was in a right bad place and that she was going to fix him up with one of her friends later tonight. That must be who you saw with Draco."
"Harry, this is going to hurt a bit. I'm going to cast a lubrication spell and I'll start with a finger, but if you want me to stop at any point, just…." But he never got a chance to finish because Harry cut in.
“There wasn’t any trace of human DNA that they could identify,” Harry admitted, “It’s one of the questions we’d hoped you could answer for us.”
Standing outside Abraxous Apothecary and Potions, Harry chewed his lip, wondering for the hundredth time if there was someone else who he could consult. But even as this thought crossed his mind, he dismissed it. Every other potion master he’d met told him to come talk to this Master Abraxous—he was the best. The only thing was no one supposedly knew who this person was, otherwise, they might have reconsidered their recommendation. Harry knew though and he still decided to come.
“No specifics yet. Teams are still there investigating,” Peters shook his head, “but I heard some senior Aurors talking and rumour has it, it wasn’t an accident.”
“Healer Banks notified me when you sneaked into Mr. Malfoy’s room.” She gave Harry a stern look, “We will discuss your role in this investigation later, but for now, I believe Healer Banks and I should leave you boys alone. Clearly, the sensor alarm was not caused by medical reasons.”
Shifting uncomfortably under Potter’s gaze, Draco opted for his usual approach of provocation and distraction, “So you’re trying to woo me Potter? Won’t the future Mrs. Potter be jealous?”
Draco didn’t want to let go. Didn’t want to face the possibility that this could be the last time he would kiss Harry, or feel his body pressed up between him and hard surface. But Draco’s luck at keeping Harry where he wanted him finally ran out as Harry took advantage of Draco’s roaming tongue and bit down hard, pushing Draco away as he checked his tongue for blood.
Their close proximity caused Draco to shift slightly, his hands coming to rest on Harry's hips of their own accord. They stayed still in that pose for only the briefest of moments before both moved to close the gap, their lips fitting together perfectly, as if they were made for each other alone. The kiss, which started out gentle, became progressively harder and more desperate. Draco's nails dug into Harry's hips, and Harry's grip in Draco hair became so tight it was a wonder he didn't pull any hair out, and all the while a familiar and deep passion awoken in both boy's hearts as the understanding of what could have been—what should have been—crashed over them both with an intensity that neither one expected.
“But it’s not always been like that, remember. I’m both biracial and bisexual. And a halfblood. The Dursley’s hated me because I wasn’t Muggle enough and
The rest of Ron’s backyard Quidditch team had gone home and it was just him and Harry, the round empty table covered in beer rings and empty packets of nuts.
"Fancy. What's the occasion?" Draco tried his hardest to look disinterested but it was hard to feign disinterest while staring directly at the way a piece of fabric joins over one's shoulders.
Granted. Not the best situation he could have gotten himself into. At least he was of age. Draco shivered, retching over the side of the bed once before zeroing in on the carpet.
Harry had to power-walk to keep up, Draco weaving in and out of doors and around tables with the nimble ease of a gazelle, leaving Harry yards behind. If Robards were to see him he’d definitely be brought up on how he was neglecting his exercise regime.
Draco put his head in his hands. He couldn't stand to look at anyone's concerned faces, especially not in the current circumstances. He knew his workmates all acted like buddies - going to the pub, asking each other round for curry - but really, this was bordering on unprofessional.
“I fixed your kettle by the way. It was one of the wires. You know.” He rotated his hand in a lazy arc, “Electricity and magic”.
Hermione’s hand flew to her mouth as she swore under her breath. “You can’t tell him you know. I’ve got a lot on my plate right now, I really didn’t mean to say anything Harry, I’m so sorry.”
Draco snuggles under the blanket, feet tucked into the ends. He lays in Harry's lap, as Harry runs his fingers through Draco's blonde hair, watching this years snowfall come down.
“I… don’t remember what I was saying.” Harry’s mouth was dry. It was hot here, maybe he was claustrophobic. Or maybe he just didn’t like the idea of a hundred tonnes of dirt weighing him down from above. Maybe he didn’t like the thought of being dead.
"You don't look like you're too fond of him, or me." The man laughed a little as Draco fought to school his features into something other than a frown. "Would you like a drink?"
“Yes.” Harry said firmly before wrapping his arms around Draco, assuring himself again that this was real. ”I’m glad I didn’t scare you off with... everything.”
of this.” Harry sounded exasperated. A dark tint had collected under his eyes from two nights of travel and Merlin-knows how many hours of wasteful conversation. His hosts had been quite accommodating with the tea and biscuits but less so information-wise. He’d eventually given up, sloping off to Ron and Hermione’s for a break before he looked for someone else tomorrow. Even he couldn’t function on the fraction of sleep he’d managed to get.
Draco lay back, letting Harry ease him into opening up. He teased at the cracks in his memory, wondering all the while whether dredging up the past was as good an idea as Harry seemed to think.
The floo whoshed to signal he had guests two minutes after he’d stepped into the shower. He rolled his eyes, continuing to soap his hair. “
There was a finality to it, as Draco placed his palm in Harry's, feeling the rough, calloused warmth.
“NO! Don’t come in!” Draco was an inch away from the door that led into their hallway before it was promptly slammed in his face.
Harry spoke in between bites of mince. “I can move them back if you’re not okay with me touching your stuff, I should have asked before...” He trailed off.
“I don’t know whether this is protocol or orthodox but your secret’s safe with me.” Pansy winked at Harry before turning back to the multiple plastic bags piled up on the tray in front of her. “Now. Please go away. I have things to do. Not you darling.”
“Because it’s the least healthy option on the menu or because it contains meat?” Ron asked, tucking into his salad.
The sound Harry gave was noncommittal, and Draco leant into the sensation of curling fingertips on his scalp.
He no longer grimaced at Harry when he was seen rumpled and frustrated, instead, he’d recounted the situation while he’d sat on Harry’s lap, his eyebrows furrowing at the scrap of paper that constituted as Harry’s ‘wedding checklist.’
Harry was still tying his shoelaces, not bothering to look up as he spoke. “If that’s the Prophet tell them to bugger off.”
"I knew it was trees or something- the name. I mean come on I was so close-" Draco cut himself off, fully taking in the scene around him. He wasn't in his bed. His shirt and shoes were nowhere to be found and the eyes that were staring back at him... well, they were very green.
He walks with a purpose, trying to keep his head down. Skirting the spinning skirts and the toes of men in charcoal suits. He's so focused on his footing that he almost forgets his destination.
“Never before have I been so revolted by you but you sound like Aunt Petunia.” Harry stuck his tongue out in disgust before pulling his own jacket on and following his flustered boyfriend downstairs. “What did you go out for this morning?”
Draco spelled a blanket from the basket by the church door as snow began to swirl more thickly around them, leaving it to drape itself over Harry’s shoulders. “To have and to hold…”
The words were like magic unto themselves. The last piece slotted into a long abandoned puzzle.It all made a sudden, awful kind of sense.The soft blurring of ink on creamy paper. The pain.
Draco wrinkled his nose at that. “Didn’t you promise you’d make me food?” He said instead of addressing his disdain for being compared to Granger.
“Keep your voice down or they’ll-” Draco was about to tell Harry he’d have his wand confiscated but he trailed off at the sight of the statue in the middle of the room.
“The other stuff?” Harry took a chair from under the table, wincing as it was dragged along the floor.
“Oculus Reparo.” He tried for what felt like the hundredth time. The glasses didn’t budge. Repairing spells may be good but they couldn’t salvage the blown apart glass that had landed at his feet prior, or the wonky frame. He was surprised they’d held up this long. As he thought it, the bridge between both halves broke.
Withdrawing his long fingers from where they were skating along the dusty surfaces of a back shelf. He stalked toward the table in the middle of the room. It was dark wood, but he couldn’t decipher the grain, from the amount he’d spilled on it over the years.
They were in a huddle near the floo, where quite a large wizard was attempting to squeeze himself into the space available.
It had been a long three hours that night and Harry revelled in never having to have a conversation that exhaustingly long again.
Pointing at Draco, Harry continued. “You need about a weeks worth of sleep first, don’t argue with me. I know you get up in the middle of the night to write down your ideas.”
He couldn't tell whether it had happened when he'd pulled it out of his closet this morning or earlier in the night, all he knew was there was no button on the floor, and he only knew that because his head was on the table, eyes glaring straight down at the clean slabs of stone beneath his rickety wooden chair.
“I accidentally slept through dinner. Astronomy homework.” Harry gestured to the stars as if it was their fault he overslept.
The snow cakes the roofs of the dilapidated houses like icing, settling in Harry's hair in thick layers.  Draco entertains the idea that he looks quite delectable - like an iced bun. He allows a faint smile to quirk over his lips before the icy wind hits his cheeks again. He's cold and wet, feet sinking far into the snowy ground beneath him.
Harry spent no more than a minute glancing over the ingredients, eventually finding a name imprinted on the cork seal.
Hermione glared at him. “If only we were so lucky.” She said drily, a small smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. ”God knows why Draco wants to marry you.”
Harry looked at Draco’s perpetually tired eyes and still-frazzled hair and decided it might be a good idea for him to stay somewhere where he might actually sleep.
Draco took a long swig of his vodka almost as soon as it was put down on the beer mat. He pretended with all the aloofness of an angry swan that his sleeve wasn't dampening from the small puddle of un-mopped alcohol that had spilled onto the beer mat. Especially as he was ninety percent sure he hadn't spilled his own drink yet.
He didn’t mention Ron or Hermione as Harry laughed, instead he watched patiently as Harry struggled with the buttons on his shirt.
The last ten months really had tested their relationship, he’d joked once that he hoped it would all be worth it. But, as he turned away from the shining lights outside and back to the empty portion of his bed, he realised it would. If only so he could have Draco back beside him.
He didn’t prod further. Anything pertaining to the war was shaky ground for the both of them, he knew that more than anything.
He blinked, about to wipe the sleep from his eyes with his shirt. Instead, Draco jerked upright as his long, cold fingers came into contact with his nipples. The first thing he saw was a long nest of dark hair.
“He’s Harry now is he?” Pansy rolled her eyes fondly. “He wasn’t Harry before. What changed?” She kicked him playfully under the table.
Harry could see clearly for the first time in his life. He also had a man sat on his bladder. “Could you move? Please?”
It all twisted together, a mess inside him as he started explaining: all retina and optic nerve. Cones and colour perception.
"I'm not bullying you, I was trying to be genuine." Harry rolled his eyes as he came to sit on the bed.
He’d been happy enough, alone with his tightly packed bookshelves and whistling kettle but it had been lonely, sometimes. Surrounded by lives he couldn’t live. Not really.
“Whatever you were going to ask.” He lifted a hand, piano teeth fingers caressing the air in an attempt to ask Harry to talk, in not so many words. “Ask away.”
A splash of purple liquid fell onto Draco's shoe as he spun one hundred and eighty degrees in the bar stool to watch his companion leave.
He narrowed his eyes at Draco’s wand hand. “Don’t you dare think of cleaning my jeans while I’m wearing them.”
“Oh. Gawain. What can I do for you?” Draco tapped his fingers on the underside of his desk. He hated people interrupting him, especially people who weren’t actually his boss, double for when they thought they could order him around anyway. Robards was of no exception.
"Please, Aurors," the poor little thing wailed, cutting him off, "Master Draco is being very good! Master Draco isn't deserving Azkaban! Master Draco is following all the rules!"
"Uh," Harry said articulately, before giving himself a mental shake. No, for this, he'd have to turn his charm up to 70. (He'd have turned it up to a hundred but unfortunately, he doubted it could possibly go that high. Harry's charm was inconveniently limited to an estimated level of 72.)
When silver eyes shot open and his body seized up in orgasm, Harry felt the building heat in his own loins erupt out of the tip of his cock.
In fact, the halfblood founders, Helena and Albert Moore had likely named their store so similarly just to spite the other business.
"Alright! Alright! I'm sorry- p-lease!" Dudley shouts, and is horrified to note that his voice breaks into a sob.
He finally stopped however, and looked at his son, eyes growing warm, "Alright then, Scorpius. Albus. Good night."
"Fuck, yes just- just like that. Pretty little mouth like yours, wasted on the shite that comes out of it," he continued, squeezing the shaft of his dick with one practiced hand while the other reached further below to squeeze his heavy balls, pink and ever so slightly fuzzy with minute blond hairs. Like a wicked little peach, ripe for the taking.
"And I DON'T LIKE EAVESDROPPERS," he says a fair bit louder before dropping his tone again, "but Malfoy? Ridiculous."
Harry's smiling at the boy's ridiculous order- it's certainly not a request- and Dudley knows that if nothing else, this was definitely proof that his cousin is truly a freak. A crazy freak.
"Fuck, Potter," he whispered to the emptiness of the locker room, digging clean fingers into the purpling spot where he'd just been punched, "so fucking easy to rile up, aren't you?"
"Higgs, out," Malfoy bit out, glaring the tall man down, somehow, despite being the shortest of the trio.
"Young Mister Malfoy returns home tonight from a rather taxing dinner party," the spirit informed him, and Harry nodded in acknowledgment. Though he'd only half heard him, no thanks to the way his eyes seemed to want to do nothing but run up, down and all over the long, lean lines of Malfoy's damp body.
Harry's heart stuttered for an honest moment, before he realized the blond was only reaching out to customize his tea. Not to say 'blast it' to self control and snatch the other man away so he could have his wicked way with him. No, if Draco Malfoy could spend Merlin knows how long into the future secretly lusting over Harry, he could surely bear to control himself in front of him right now.
was a question that had just begun to tickle his mind before he found himself suddenly outside of the musty locker room.
Harry blinked, very calmly, up at a ridiculously chiselled man. Said man had blue eyes, and dark hair that curled at the edges like Scorpius'. His nose was slightly upturned.
"Why there is only one way to find out!" the Spirit exclaimed, before proceeding to half-pull, half-drag Harry back to the window.
Malfoy may not have turned ugly, his hair may have stayed that beautiful shiny blond and his skin may have been clear as a baby's behind- but his eyes were nothing more than two dark holes drilled into his skull.
Bucking slightly into Malfoy's heat a few final times, Harry let out a contented sigh and flipped him over, kissing him deeply. With tongue.
“Well, what was it?” Even with the dubious nature of the broadcast, surely there can’t have been something deluded enough to have given Malfoy the impression that… what had he even been on about? White blonde bush? Bush… “Ohhh God, tell me they didn’t…”
The blond cast a surreptitious glance at the Gryffindor locker room before striding into his own with a grace that Harry honestly envied a bit. He and the Elf followed Malfoy into the now deserted Slytherin lockers, where said teenager had already chucked his shirts off and thrown them into a handsome little laundry hamper.
Dudley becomes aware of the intruder's presence at about one in the morning on a warm Friday night, via a soft thud that comes from the kitchen. His parents are out at that holiday beach resort that Mum simply couldn't stop talking about all week, and are not likely to return before Wednesday (that's when the big game is on). Even his scrawny cousin is likely to be asleep at this hour. He's been keeping to the confines of his bedroom all summer so far, anyway.
“There was this one time..." he said as Malfoy sipped his own drink. The blond spared him a glance, tipping his cup once it touched his lips, "You lost to me, and we'd had a scuffle outside the locker rooms. Do you remember that?"
Ginny's expression was so ugly, so hurtful, that Harry had to look away from her. His eyes fell upon Lily, napping blissfully in her crib with a silencing charm shimmering around her. He wished dearly to pick her up and take her far, far away from here.
Malfoy hummed appreciatively, and drew his arms languidly around Harry's neck, pulling him close and sighing into his mouth. This was, objectively no better than before, but at least those horrible eyes of his were closed and stowed away behind pale eyelids.
"We were dancing to Shakira and she did the bad thing," Harry says vaguely, and Ron nods, understanding his terminology immediately. Of course he understands. It was the worst thing to happen to Harry after Voldemort.
Harry had never seen Malfoy's cock in a properly flaccid state before now, and he had to admit even that was pretty. It had a certain heaviness to it that looked lovely in light pink against his ivory skin.
He hovered closer in disregard of his manners, and found exactly what he had subconsciously hoped for. Pictures of himself.
"Daddy," Draco says mildly, because Lucius' eyes are glazing over and that's never a good sign, "So... we're going?"
"Auror... Watson. Hi," Harry flushed deeply, although thoroughly shrouded in heavy silk sheets, "Oh, man."
tching," Malfoy said petulantly, looking far too pleased with himself. He was lounging back on the sheets as if nothing was amiss and the three of them got up to shenanigans like this on the daily. His bits were out for the world to see as if he were saying 'carry on! It's nothing you haven't seen already.'
The blond looked more or less the same. Older, yes, but in a refined sort of way. His hair was parted smartly to the side, and the creepy blankness of his eyes somehow helped enhance his features.
Molly raises her brows, amused. She's enamoured with how her daughter and Harry Potter are so mad for each other. A part of her is itching to interrupt and give the kids a sound lecture regarding underaged sex. Another part however, is  reminded of herself with Arthur at sixteen; two teenagers losing theirselves in lust and love.
Every once in a while, Malfoy cracked an eye open to take a peek at the book lying in front of him. It was open to a page bearing a single photo of Harry, looking over his shoulder with a tiny glare, his hair mussed and his face pink with irritation. "Gods, Potter, I'm so- wet. For you. Need, need you to-"
He sucked a hickey onto Draco’s skin as he quickened his pace, going at him as hard and fast as he possibly could, centering his roaming hands firmly on his hips to steady him. Draco clutched the table, bottles of cologne and decorative little trinkets chattering against the glass tabletop as it shook violently to each erratic thrust of Harry's hips. He was in bliss; the impossibly tight column of Draco’s arse sucking his cock
He exhaled, squeezing too much paste out onto his toothbrush and looking himself dead in the eye in the mirror over the sink.
"You don't mean that," future-Harry said placatingly, but the hurt was written plainly all over his face.
"Shouldn't we be giving him some privacy? You know, for his, uh," Harry said most articulately while painfully aware that him ogling this man's arse unawares to him was the very opposite of allowing him privacy. Still, he watched as Malfoy spelled his book open, naked as the day he was born. His shoulder-blades jutted out nicely, and his broad back looked strong without taking the leanness away from his physique. Two perfect globes of arse rested below his pinched waist, and Harry wondered if they were as soft as they looked. He was loathe to admit to anyone that he wanted desperately to sink his teeth into the fleshy mounds of Malfoy's bubble-butt. No, he was going to be keeping that thought to himself, thanks.
He's on top of his girl, kissing and sucking, no doubt even if their faces are out of sight. Dudley does, however, see his fingers pumping in, out, in, and out of a tiny pink little hole between her legs, her pubic area covered by another of Harry's large, rubbing hands. Dudley feels his pants growing tight around his groin and he rubs himself against the hard bark of the tree.
Indeed, the older man's formidably long hair was wrapped around pale green curlers that Draco swears he's seen on his mother before.
He must have touched his sweet spot, because Malfoy suddenly jerked hard, eyes rolling back into his skull and lips curving up into a dopey little smile. "Oooooh-" he groaned, looking- odd as it was- adorably happy, "right there."
Strangely, this felt more perverse to Harry than watching the man bugger himself to climax. Following a sleep-softened (or perhaps post coital) Malfoy as he padded barefoot through his own home seemed very personal, for some reason.
“I’m happy to hear that,” Draco whispered back, his voice deep and husky, like the first sip from a bottle of firewhiskey. A nimble hand rose to curl at the base of Harry’s neck, tugging gently at the soft curls that resided there. The smile on Draco's lips was one that Harry could feel against his skin.
She stops, abruptly, startled by the muffled voice that, seemingly unintentionally, finished the lyric for her. It's barely six in the morning and none of the kids should be this coherent before ten during their vacation.
“Don’t worry!” he placates with raised palms, “It was a compliment. Apparently, you can do it very quick.”
Harry pondered over this for a moment, but inspiration only struck him once he was passed by not one, but two sweaty, teenaged Weasley twins, both brandishing beaters' bats and wide grins.
be a better father to his only offspring. Ever since he's been rid of the dark fog that the second coming of the Dark Lord had passed over his mind, he's been able to revert to the doting father that he'd been throughout Draco's first ten years in the world.
To be honest, Draco thinks as he removes one of his hats, he’s a bit flattered. Potter’s romantic preference based solely off
“Oh hell, this probably means they’ve aired that thing about the pubes as well,” he groans, thinking back to the blond’s parting words.
that Draco was not the owner of the gruff voice. For that could only mean it's his son who lets out an answering affirmation of:
"This is simply not done," Draco mutters, pulling on a set of lovely plum coloured robes that he had originally hated with a burning passion.
“Look at him, he’s overthinking in his little bimbo brain as we speak,” says one of the men. The tall one that plays ball-foot. Oh, damn it all.
"But he's not a murderer," Harry continues, softly, "And he's got brilliant grades, by the way. Second best in our year. Can you leave?" he asks abruptly, "I don't much fancy talking to you."
With the acute hatred towards gingers and mudbloods in mind, he had joined the Dark Lord's mudblood destroying regime (before belatedly realizing how horrible an idea that was, damn you, 19 year old Lucius), as well as strengthening the ever present blood feud with the painfully ginger Weasleys. While he resents passing these ideals onto his son, he does not in the slightest regret conditioning Draco into hating those insufferable Weasleys. Merlin knows Arthur is still a raving nutter and his bleeding cow of a wife is no better-
His nerves on high alert, Harry sat up in his seat, eyes trained on Malfoy, and only Malfoy. Tepid silver eyed stared back at him, but his foot was jiggling in a most uncharacteristic way and that was all Harry needed to see.
Draco stared quietly at Harry, grey eyes darting over his face. "What?" Harry asked, starting to feel a little uncomfortable.
Malfoy was still just as beautiful as he had been before, turning around and walking towards a great mahogany desk at the back of the room. His arse moved wonderfully as he did, completely in the nude as he was, and drew Harry's eyes to it inevitably-- even when he sat the pretty thing down, bare onto the leather of his desk chair.
Of course things like this are bound to happen at some point when you're gorgeous, rich and inclined towards men (Lucius himself included, of course. Although he had had a certain affection for the gardener's son instead, at Draco's age- much to the dismay of his actual lover). He shouldn't be phased at all, really.
"Harry! He's going to kill us!" Dudley shouts in a panic. After all, this boy was an enemy of Harry's and his, both.
Harry could only nod as he stepped into Malfoy's home and closed the door behind himself. The decor of the place was, as he vaguely noted, similar to the bedroom he'd seen last night. Of course, he could have made a more accurate comparison if he weren't too busy studying the way the silky fabric of Malfoy's robe had moulded itself to the cleft of his pert arse.
"Hey! I was gonna see myself pummelling Malfoy again!" Harry whined, but the Elf raised a hand to stop both his stream of words, as well as the scene before them.
,” Draco replied cheekily before breaking into a soft moan as he surely felt the tip of Harry's cock nudging the tight ring of his entrance.
Harry did, do something, that is. Bending over Malfoy’s sweet arsehole, he pried his fingers out of it and lowered his mouth instead.
"He shouldn't have to do that," Harry growled through his teeth, suddenly very angry at Harry and Ginny from the future, "he should have this time to be a kid, not to be more of an adult than either of-" 'them', he'd wanted to say, but swallowed thickly instead, "us has been."
"POTTER!” Draco interrupted, screaming as he came all over himself- his lithe body jolting and his cock spurting thick white strings of cum on his stomach as well as his mirror. Harry held his sides firmly, even as his own orgasm threatened to overwhelm him. He all but collapsed from his climax, continuing his strokes lazily inside Draco wet heat. He felt his own spunk dribble out the sides of his lover’s hole while he slowly straightened up, sliding out gently as the blond spun around to face him, leaning heavily against the abused vanity. Harry kissed Draco deeply, gripping his face in one hand, arse in the other as the latter wound two strong arms around his shoulders and drew him in impossibly closer.
The arrival of this newly established Sweet and Mild Father, as Draco liked to call him, had certainly done wonders for the younger's lifestyle. His son had been frightfully skeptical at first at the lack of the now familiar stony lectures about responsibility and The Malfoy Image (capitalized). Increasingly more so had been his skepticism towards the reappearance of their old father-son Quidditch games (although Lucius' joints were creaky with lack of practice and... alright,
his glasses and put them back on, only to see Malfoy sitting on the ground with his leg twisted in ways one's leg really shouldn't be twisted. He furrowed his eyebrows.
He doesn't say anything else and just watches Harry stare at him with expectant eyes. The moment lasts a few seconds, Harry wanting an answer and he exclaims a little too loud when he doesn't get one. ,,Well?! Come up with a lie then but come on, you gotta give me something!"
,,Would you stop making such a big deal out of this!" Harry groaned in despair. He's been trying to get Draco to accept his help for over five minutes now but he just wouldn't. So, he's now - what really cannot be called -
friend, but he betrayed them and it's his fault that they're even dead in the first place, and, as if that's not already enough, he so happens to be my godfather!" he laughs at the end but drops it right away too. ,,So yeah, you can pick your own reason of what's actually bloody wrong!" he yells and Draco doesn't miss the voice crack at the end of his sentence. Stopping in his tracks to shoot Draco a glare, his voice echoes through snow-covered trees and grey skies and it might have sent shivers down the blond's spine.
,,Oh, that's- great... you really can't feel it?" Draco shakes his head. ,,...not even if I do this?" Harry smirks and kind of fist bumps the blond's leg. Well, it was pretty harsh. Draco hisses.
Harry helped him up and put the blond's arm around his shoulders to support him from below and put his hand around his waist, squeezing him close.
,,But-!" Harry ignored his previous comment and continued: ,,I'm not going to leave you in a forest for some werewolves to bite you because that would be on me and I would have to deal with your full moons all year, so just shut up, hold my broom, and let me carry you back!"
all of a sudden. He was sure it was just a moment though, people are more open this late at night. He knew it would all go back to normal the moment he gets out of the hospital wing. Plus, just the minor
He steps closer and the snow crunching beneath his heavy boots feels too loud. He reaches out his arm carefully, slowly, and he leans back, trying to distance his face from what could still possibly be some kind of a trick and he'd end up like that Finnigan lad in every class ever, possibly without eyebrows.
Draco closed his eyes and let his head fall back against the headboard with a thud, “Soon. Father already sent me a reminder not to be late.”
Having said his piece, Draco let go of Harry’s hand, and started fidgeting with his cuffs in an effort to ignore Harry’s stare, frowning slightly as he realized he missed the pressure of Harry’s hand in his. He was so absorbed by his cuffs and by trying to figure out what the empty feeling meant that he didn’t notice when Harry turned and pulled him into an awkward sideways embrace.
Harry made an exasperated noise. “Look Draco. I can see that something is bothering you but if you don’t want to talk about it or tell me right now, I’m going to go join the lads. We made a big arrest today and we’re gong to have a few drinks to celebrate.”
Then they saw the professors and their friends running towards them and Draco mumbled something about if they should be
,,Come on! You were all: it hurts so bad, my father will hear about your inability, professor Lockhart! I don't care, get me away from this madman!" Harry mocks and the other boy flushes red once again.
Rolling over, Draco carefully extracted himself from the blankets, stretching as he looked around the floor for clothing which had been hastily discarded the previous night. Pulling on his boxers, Draco grabbed a t-shirt off the floor, and grinned to himself as he recognized Harry’s scent as he pulled it over his head.
Dropping his cuffs, Draco squirmed a bit, freeing his arms enough to return Harry’s hug. After a second, they puled away, looking everywhere except at each other, both critically aware of something shifting around them, even if they couldn’t put a name to it.
Harry thought to himself, but it sure felt nice to be desired by someone so Harry didn't say anything. Despite Neville's earlier warnings, and Harry's decision to keep things cordial between them, he couldn't bring himself to tell Miguel to stop, so he simply closed his eyes and tried to lose himself in the music and forget the fact that Draco, the man he wanted back so badly, was sitting just across the room and was watching him grind a total stranger. But instead of forgetting about Draco, dancing with Miguel just made Harry want Draco more—Draco knew him, his body, what he liked and didn't like, and while what Miguel was doing felt pretty damn good, it would be heck of a lot better with Draco.
Harry smiled as he looked around at his group of friends. It had been a long time since he had gone out with the gang, actually it had been a long time since he had gone out at all, but right now, there was no place he rather be than with his friends, even if Draco was here too.
"I love you, Harry Potter." Draco murmured, receiving the shock of his life when Harry's eyes burst open. Draco had fully expected to be pushed out of bed and told to leave immediately, or he at least expected Harry to ask him to repeat what he said. But what happened next was something that Draco hadn't expected ever.
echoing in his brain. Acting on impulse rather than any semblance of rational thought, Draco moved around the couch and caught Harry just as he turned, so they were nose to nose. Reaching out, Draco pushed Harry hard towards the closest wall, pinning him there.
Draco snorted as Harry practically inhaled it and moved to grab some more. “Save some for me will you.” Draco said as he prodded Harry’s side to get him to move over so Draco could also lean against the headboard.
Accepting Harry's somewhat of an explanation, Draco laid back down. "What are we going to do when everybody finds out?" He asked, realizing rather quickly that most wouldn't take too kindly to the Chosen One and the son of a Death Eater loving each other.
Pausing briefly, Harry considered his next move and even though subtly and seduction weren’t his usually go-to’s, he decided to give it a shot. He moved slightly so that he was behind Draco, “I’m just returning the favour, it seems fair that since you’re so good at distracting me, I should get a shot.” He kept his voice light, but he could see Draco sit up a bit straighter and shiver slightly as he felt Harry’s breath on his neck.
"I'm sorry Harry. I'm so sorry." She sighed in his ear while rubbing circles in his back. Harry straightened up, breaking the hug with Andromeda.
"Oh, um, nothing…nothing", Harry replied offhandedly, "You go on ahead. I'll meet you back at the training centre." Harry continued to stare down the corridor, while Ron silently considered things for a moment before shrugging and walking away, muttering under his breath as he went.
“Auror Potter, you are mistaken.” He replied eventually. “I left that night because I had no interest in engaging in further activities. I’m sorry if I gave you a false impression,” He added somewhat flatly, “Now, please if you wouldn’t mind showing yourself out, I have potions that need attending to.”
They had stopped outside a set of beautifully carved oak double doors. Harry went to open the door but before he had the chance, Andromeda placed a hand on his wrist. "Potter….Harry…." she said with a surprising amount of gentleness in her voice, "This is going to be a shock for you; I know it will be, but try to be tactful. This person has suffered greatly and not just from this illness that will soon take their life. They only have a few moments left, so please try not to judge them too harshly." And with that, she released Harry's wrist and turned to leave.
Collapsing out of the sheer power of his orgasm, Draco laid on top of Harry, while both attempted to regain their breath and organize their brains back to regular functioning levels. When he could finally breathe at a normal pace, Draco lifted himself off of Harry and pulled his cock out of Harry, who moaned at the loss and emptiness he now felt. Snuggling beside Harry, Draco stole a brief kiss before his head came to rest on Harry's chest.
Harry waited until Ron had disappeared from sight before following the lone figure down the corridor, and into a boy's lavatory. The scene gave Harry a sense of déjà vu. The lean body slumped over a sink, head bowed, platinum blond hair failing forward, and the slight shaking of his shoulders indicated that Draco Malfoy was crying. If the door falling closed behind Harry startled Draco at all, he didn't show it. Instead, without raising his head or standing straight, Draco spoke. "Come to curse me again, Potter?"
He watched as Harry struggled to bring his breathing back under control, and after a few seconds, spoke.
He was just settling himself into what he thought was an appropriate pattern before movement in the hallway caught his attention.
When Miguel grabbed Harry's hand and led him towards a back booth, Harry let him. And arriving at set booth, Harry just barely noticed Draco looking at him from the bar where he sat with Hermione. An Auror to the bone, Harry made note to ask Hermione about it later, but any further speculations and observations were wiped clean as Miguel pulled Harry down into his lap, and went back to exploring the depths of Harry's mouth.
