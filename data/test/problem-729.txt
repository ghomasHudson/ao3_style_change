Draco woke up to concerned faces and soft conversations. Neville propped him up against a pillow and gave him a glass of water.
The Dark Lord's horrific, lipless smile grew as he caught sight of Draco, '' Lord Voldemort is merciful Draco. I will give you a second chance to prove your worth. Come forward but rest assured that I do not take well to treachery.''
Draco let out a mocking laugh, '' You call yourself a Slytherin? Your brash actions and insane, thoughtless behavior makes you the most talentless Dark Lord to exist. I predicted your every move and played your little game much better than you. You call yourself the most powerful wizard, an enigma, but you only ended up mutilating your magic. Your bountiful power means nothing if you don't know how to truly empower it.''
Draco saw the shocked expressions on the teachers' and student's faces when they saw his appearance. Draco's hands were chained behind his back as an unfamiliar Death Eater shoved him into his seat at the Slytherin table.
Draco looked at his mother in shock and was about to argue but his mother silenced him.
'' Well, if you need to talk then I'm here for you mate.''
''Never again.'', he promised.
'' Of course, I trusted you! It's not that I didn't. You were at risk with me! I WAS A FUCKING DEATH EATER! Voldemort had my family captive and ready to be tortured if I made the slightest mistake. On top of that, he was planning your death! Do you know how much it hurt to show no reaction when the megalomaniac bastard raved on about murdering the LOVE OF MY LIFE?!''
'' Then I shall fight by your side.'', with that, his father swiped off his Death Eater uniform and turned his back to those he once worked with all for his son. He fought against all those who had caused his family pain.
'' HARRY POTTER IS DEAD!'', Draco's legs grew weak and the Weasley twins held him up as Draco lost his voice.
'' HE WHAT? Get that fucker here this instant or I'll rip into all of you and make Voldemort look like a pygmy puff!''
The crowd was noisy as it surged against them and Harry clutched Draco’s hand tighter, following Luna through the throngs of people as Ginny piggybacked her down the street.
He waited for Draco to adjust, pausing for a second longer to admire the way he began to rut back against him, patience clearly wearing thin. Palms sweating, Harry began a steady rhythm, thrusting into Draco over and over and over until they were both groaning loudly.
to marry me," she said with a hiccup, looking up at Ron with disbelief, who rolled his eyes fondly at Harry as he pulled her into a hug.
. I know how much this means to you, having him with us, and just…in general, I suppose. I’ve probably never said it, not sober anyway, but you two- you have something, something so different to the rest of us. Me and ‘Mione, we’ve been in love for nearly double the time you’ve been, yet…I don’t know, mate. You seem to get each other more than anyone else does, and you,” he scrubbed a hand over his chin, eyes flicking from Draco to Harry and back, “don’t laugh at me, now, but you two…you
“I- you- it wasn’t- fuck
Draco stopped his rambling with another kiss, and Harry sighed against his lips, the storm raging in his heart now calm. When they broke apart, Draco smiled softly, running his thumb along Harry’s bottom lip, plucking at it affectionately. “I lied before too, I suppose. It really has been rather dreadful, living without your hero cock for this long. Speaking of-” he glanced down, ignoring Harry’s scoff of disbelief, and wrapped a firm hand around him- “I believe we have some unfinished business to attend to.”
“I know that
” He asked, clearly horrified, face a picture of pure disbelief.
As if summoned by his maudlin thoughts, Ron- a very hairy, very wolf-like Ron- appeared, sausage roll in one hand, cocktail glass in the other. This, he offered to Harry, who took it readily.
God, he shouldn't have thought about his prick.
Tongue-binding curse too, he suspected. Very clever.
“It’s been a while, Draco. I’m just being
And another.
“Is that a genuine question?”
Pansy tutted loudly. “Good luck with this one, Potter,” she said, poking Draco in the cheek, “he’s going to be a
“Oh. Well, shit.”
Feeling slightly delirious, Harry guided himself forward, pressing slowly into Draco, who’s arse, after a second of resistance, sucked in the head of his cock with an obscene squelch. Harry shuddered, hips bucking involuntarily, sliding halfway into Draco, who let out another low sound, his own hips circling slowly. Inch by inch, Harry moved deeper into him, cursing as Draco's inner muscles tightened around his cock.
made it sexy!” Draco insisted, lifting his head, and Harry laughed, unsure if the statement or the half-hearted glare that accompanied it was funnier.
Breaking the kiss, he turned his head to see Ginny aiming a third cocktail sausage and spun them round so that it bounced off Draco’s back, who didn’t seem to care at all; he peppered tiny kisses all over Harry's face, oblivious to the mild disgust they were causing around them as he ground his hips subtly against Harry’s own.
Draco reached out a hand, fingertips brushing Harry's cheek shakily before coming to rest against his lips, their eyes locking.
Vaguely aware of voices outside the room, Harry thumbed at Draco’s hole, using his other hand to cast a quick locking charm on the door. Draco wiggled his hips, rocking slightly on his heels, just enough that the tip of Harry’s thumb slipped inside, and he swore as Draco clenched around him. Heart pounding in his ears, he clumsily conjured some lube, whispering a gentle cleansing charm before pushing his middle finger straight in to the second knuckle, inching it slowly in and out, hypnotised by the way Draco’s body seemed to cling to him, as if the spell was affecting them both.
you. We have so much fun, and I hate that you stay here all alone when you should be celebrating too. You deserve to be a part of it, and I want to share the experience with you. It feels wrong, celebrating love without the person I love the most.’
Head spinning, confused, he looked at Draco in the mirror; took in his perfect cupid’s bow, his slightly turned-up nose, his sharp, high cheekbones, his skin, flushed and glowing. Harry's eyes roamed over the hair falling across his forehead, the shining white strands sticking to his sweaty temple, the silver pendant still swinging slightly against his scarred chest.
“Gorgeous, no?” Blaise said, “both Italian, both incredibly enthusiastic. They asked if I’d ever-”
“As much as I’d like to, I can’t disagree,” Blaise sighed as he joining them. “Congratulations, Draco dearest- ce nest pas souvent qu’un rêve d’enfance se transforme en réalité.”
"We’ve been in here a while.”
He began to writhe, whimpering as Harry curled his fingers into a tight press. Draco’s grip on their cocks loosened, the leg that wasn’t wrapped around Harry’s waist starting to shake.
Harry huffed a laugh, but the look on his face must have told another story because Ron’s own softened and he grasped Harry’s shoulder, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “
I put so much effort in, but apparently not. And

is, I don’t need a banner to show the world how I feel about you, and vice versa.” He sighed, looking apologetic as Harry’s brow furrowed. “I think it’s wonderful, Harry- I do, truly- and I’m glad you enjoy it so much, but it’s just not for me.”
With one last look at Ron, who gave him a massive grin and supportive thumbs up, Harry blew out a deep breath, stood up, smoothed down his t-shirt, ran a hand through his hair, checked his laces were tied, ran his tongue over his teeth, double checked he was still holding the ring, until eventually he had nothing else to do but move.
“Although it is gorgeous- and I'm really not sure how you managed it- I meant
, Draco,” - he pressed a small kiss to the corner of Draco’s mouth- “
“Don’t remind me.” Draco huffed a soft laugh, absentmindedly stroking Harry’s arm. “So...was this my present?” He asked, looking down at his ring, turning his hand so that it sparkled.
Draco kissed him again, looking at him dazedly before brain caught up and his eyes dropped to his own sequin-clad crotch.
Harry was barely listening, using the opportunity to peel the clingy leather over the curve of his arse, shoving it down to his thighs and spinning him so that they were both stood facing the large mirror above the sink.
, heat coursing through him, desperate to sink his teeth into Draco’s exposed neck, to rip the flimsy shirt straight from his body, to wrap those ridiculously sexy legs around his waist and take him right where they stood. Instead, he stood stock-still, very aware of the twenty or so eyes on them, heart pounding, head spinning, intoxicated.
“Yeah.”
asking me stupid questions”) before Harry had even unpacked, so they’d been hidden at the bottom of their wardrobe ever since. Now that he’d finally agreed to come, Harry thought it was worth a shot, because despite his current sobriety the thought of seeing Draco’s arse sparkle was still incredibly appealing.
” Ron bellowed suddenly and Harry jumped, swearing loudly as he turned to find Draco stood in front of them. He'd been too preoccupied to notice his approach and practically leapt off the bench, hands stuffed into his pockets awkwardly.

. And anyway, Harry gets it, don’t you dear? It’s difficult trying to choose when there are just so many wonderful bits out there.”
“Nope.”
had changed.
“You two have fun tonight, because I know I will,” she said with one last wicked smile before jumping up, brushing grass from her tiny, glittery skirt as she stood. “
‘You’re awful. I don’t know why I talk to you,” Harry grumbled, but his eyes were automatically drawn to Draco’s arse and, much to his own embarrassment, he began to mentally undress him on the spot.
Until he remembered the promise he’d made.
Draco’s brows raised. “The sex?”
“No, you moron,” Harry laughed, “as if you’d let me get away with that.”
.” Harry complied happily, practically bouncing off of Draco’s arse, sliding a hand underneath his outstretched arms to tug on a pink, hardened nipple, drawing a loud keen from Draco.
“Yeah. Yeah, ok, I can do that, I do it all the time.
Ron leant behind her as she spoke, tapping Harry on the arm and nodding towards the kitchen. Unfortunately, Harry didn’t find out what was so funny about the Wizard of Oz, because they broke away from the group, Hermione’s history lesson soon fading as they moved through the small crowd. The wireless was floating in the corner, amplified and blasting The Weird Sisters’ latest release-
fantastic, despite Harry’s urge to tear the shorts right back off him and fuck him frantically against a great big pride flag.
simple.
“Are you ok?” Harry shouted over his shoulder, looking around when Draco didn’t reply. He seemed transfixed, unaware that Harry was watching him, eyes wide and astonished as he took in their surroundings. His hand was limp in Harry’s, barely holding onto his fingers as he twisted around to follow the parade moving down the centre of the street, stumbling in his attempt to see absolutely everything at once.
“Are they always so…open? Accepting?”
” Draco cried breathlesly a few seconds later, “Harry, what the fuck, we’re engaged! To be married!”
Draco Malfoy in hot pants, however, would surely be imprinted on his eyeballs for the rest of his damn life.
," he gestured between them, “
Draco smiled, plucking Harry’s bottom lip with his thumb. “A stupid amount. Merlin, I love you so fucking much.”
“-I’m joking, Harry,
“Harry’s pissed because Luna’s seen your cock,” Ginny said and Draco laughed disbelievingly, looking between the three of them.
“What if I get you a present?”
this evening.”
“Why not?”
"Gee, thanks love," he chuckled, and before Harry could say anything he was tackled from behind, stumbling forward as Ginny grabbed him round the neck and roughly messed up his hair with her spare hand.
“Never.”
“Funny? Jokes are funny, Harry, eating crickets is not.”
Except...Harry’s mouth refused to cooperate. His tongue felt like it was glued to the roof of his mouth, and rather than the “hello, Draco” he’d been planning, all that came out was an undignified “nggggh.”
Bloody exquisite, for lack of a better term.
She laughed, batting him on the arm but looking more relaxed than she had a minute before.
“What happened this morning?”
“You look like you’ve been bitten by a rather vicious Doxy, but it's quite alright- he does look rather lovely. I think I'd blush too, if Ginny was dressed like that."
"Joking, joking, I’m sure you two are
“Not happening again, my dear,” Blaise called and Pansy winked at him over Draco’s shoulder, making a crude gesture with her hands.
“Damn right,” Seamus said, squinting up at them, before poking Dean in the chest. “Why don’t you ever kiss me like that? Do I need sparkly?”
“Maybe

“Yeah, he’s just getting ready,” Harry replied, standing and running a hand through his hair. “At least I
“Are you
“You like that?” He growled, the slap of skin on skin unmistakable as it rebounded off the tiled walls, one hand tightening on Draco’s hip, the other still wrapped around his throat.
. Oh, wait...”
He cut off, cursing loudly as Draco pulled his foreskin back, sucking the head of Harry’s cock into his mouth before pulling off with a pop. Refusal died on Harry’s tongue as Draco dipped his own into the slit, flicking at it with tight little movements, eyes raising until they met Harry’s. Wrapping his lips around the swollen glans, he began to slide down, excruciatingly slow, until his nose touched the dark curls at Harry’s groin.
She smiled, squeezing him back. “Thank you for letting us come,” she said softly, and he rolled his eyes.
Ron beamed. “Damn right you are!”
“You could have, you know,” he said, patting Harry’s arm to signal he wanted to be let down. “I would’ve accepted.”
if you don’t propose to that man in the next thirty seconds I will march over there and do it myself,” Ron hissed, gesturing at Draco with his water bottle and channelling so much of Hermione it brought Harry right back down to Earth.
“We should probably head back out. Party doesn’t finish for a couple more hours.”
“Nope. Nah. Never mind, I don’t need details.”
“If I’d known proposing would get me one of those, I’d have done it years ago,” he murmured, echoing Draco’s sentiments from that morning.
"Oh, brilliant- so your mum knows we’ve fucked tonight?”
“You have to admit, it is kind of funny.”
"I'd be pretty disappointed if you didn't, actually."
Draco rolled his eyes, poking him in the cheek. “You’ve
With one last glance at Ron, Draco winked at Harry before making his way over to Pansy and Hermione, who were laying down a picnic blanket.
Harry pulled his fingers out slightly, ignoring the subtle jibe, before adding a third, fucking them back in hard enough to shut him up. Draco squirmed, gasping hoarsely, fingers scrabbling against the marble counter, heels noisy as he kicked at the tiled floor.
“Excuse me, I was
“I’ve been trying to get your attention for half a century, what’s been up with you today? You keep drifting off.’
‘Hmm. Sorry. Just a lot on my mind,” he said, eyes sliding back to Draco.
Eyes burning, he looked away, blushing slightly under Ron's gaze, which had turned overly sympathetic.
Draco smiled, looking back at Harry, his eyes sparkling just as brightly.
He looked down at his own plain, Muggle suit, brushing off a speck of soot and almost (but not quite) wishing he’d taken Ginny’s advice and come as ‘Sexy Voldemort’.
“What the
Ron laughed, knocking him lightly with his shoulder. “Mate, you can do whatever you like to him, and vice versa. I just don’t enjoy the visual of you getting your cock out, no matter who you’re doing it with. It’s all you, has absolutely nothing to do with Draco- if anything, I’m happy for you.”
“You are, this is more of a…treat. For me, really, more than you, but…here.”
“Vanity will get you nowhere.”
, and putting it on the tellyvision like it’s normal? It’s repulsive!”
That, and Draco had walked out on him over three months earlier, so he was in no position to claim stakes.
retreat,” he said, scowling when Draco’s confusion cleared and he laughed, winding his arms around Harry’s neck.
Harry had prepared all afternoon for an ambush from his friends, knowing they were getting impatient; he and Draco hadn’t seen each other since that day a few months prior, when Draco had silently packed a bag, cheeks stained with tears, ignoring Harry’s protests. Harry had refused to talk about it since, never a fan of discussing his feelings and not wanting to drag it out. He hadn’t, however, missed the small looks they'd give each other when he brushed them off, or the whispered conversations that would end abruptly when he entered a room, so knew it had only been a matter of time.
, what are you-” he gasped shakily, shaking his head as if he didn’t believe what was happening.
“Before he leaves again, or disappears into the crowd, do it while everyone is here! That way we can all watch.”
Nothing to concern Ron with.
“There
, I do it all the time, what if he-”
“Hello, love,’ she greeted, kissing him on the cheek, her large Georgian-style wig wobbling precariously. “I think you look very handsome. Not at
“Because it’s a
“Yeah?”
“Heavens, Draco,” he heard Hermione say, “you look-”
“It’s...I don’t know, making a public spectacle of someone I suppose, people always love that...”
“Today?”
They were both panting, and squinting slightly, the light in the bathroom harsh after the soft red outside. Draco looked shocked, which pissed Harry off even more- it was his fucking spell, what was he expecting?
you? You really think I’d stoop that low, Potter?” He hissed, eyes blazing. “You think I’m that desperate for your attention, that I’d curse you to get it? Or, what, as well as the complex, you think you’ve been blessed with a hero
“Oh, does it now?” Draco laughed, voice catching slightly as Harry began to massage his arse, ninety-nine percent sure their friends were no longer watching and not really caring if they were. “Well, if you don’t stop, we’ll both end up
“Now, are you going to keep asking daft questions about my trousers, or are we going to go somewhere more…private, like you suggested?” He tilted his head, warm breath ghosting Harry’s cheek, before brushing his lips gently against his ear, which began to tingle. “People are watching, you know, and your dancing is
“Arsehole,” Harry murmured, kissing him again, realising with a jolt that he’d officially be doing so for the rest of his life. The thought made his stomach clench with a strange kind of joy that only confirmed he’d made the greatest decision of his life, and that really was saying something. He’d never felt elation so strong, felt like he could just float away, his arms wrapped around the man he loved more than he thought possible.
dickhead boyfriend sat at home all day. Draco was a stubborn git at the best of times, but Harry was convinced that after so much persistence from his end, he was now refusing purely out of spite.
“Don’t let Draco hear you say that, he’ll slice your bollocks off.”
‘You said you didn’t know what to wear, and I bought them with you in mind, obviously, so it seemed like a good idea...you don’t
“Let’s go find the others,” he murmured against Draco’s lips a minute or so later, grinning when Draco shook his head, eyes still shut, chasing Harry’s mouth for another kiss. He ground his hips lightly against Harry’s who laughed softly, kissing Draco again before pulling away.
Ron’s eyes lit up, following his gaze with a hopelessly fond smile on his face. “Marriage? It’s...fantastic, really fantastic. Better than I could have imagined, if I’m honest, because you do start to worry that- wait.” Ron stopped, his eyes widening as he looked back and forth between Hermione and Harry, who tried to best to keep a straight face. “You don’t mean…?”
While he and Hermione were accustomed to busy Muggle streets and the lack of magic that came with them, the rest of the group still found restricting their magic for more than a couple of hours slightly overwhelming, and the wards allowed them to relax for a little while. Hermione had been dubious at first, but Seamus had an unfortunate habit of getting drunk and almost breaking the statute by showing Muggles his
“Me?! That was
It felt like coming home, the way Draco’s mouth parted beneath his, the way his velvety tongue ran along Harry’s bottom lip, groaning softly as Draco curled it around his own. A proper kiss, not a hard, vicious one like before- this was just as desperate, but for completely different reasons.
Ron just shook his head, taking a bite of the sausage roll, pastry flakes falling and sticking to his fur. “Sorry, mate, I don’t get it. You just look normal. A bit fancier than normal, mind, with the suit and everything—”
“You won’t finish that sentence if you know what’s good for you,” he snapped and she cackled, sliding an arm around Luna’s shoulders.
, darling, who’s bits I want to settle
“I’ll leave you two lovebirds to it,” Ginny said as Draco excused himself from Luna and Dean, making his way over to them. She left Harry stood all alone, watching her congratulate Draco with a big hug before letting him go and bounding over to join the others. Draco caught Harry’s eye again and before he could blink Draco had all but

Draco smiled, and Harry had only a second to revel in the sparkle that had returned to his eyes before Draco crushed their lips together, hand fisted tightly in Harry’s t-shirt.
“You sure know the way to a man’s heart, Harry,” she sighed wistfully, her hand pressed dramatically to her chest.
“Of course, you moron."
Harry’s nose wrinkled, suddenly dreading his next visit to Narcissa; as if breaking her son’s heart a few months prior hadn’t been enough, she now knew about his thing for leather.
them, wanted to see if the desperation he saw in his own was mirrored in Draco’s.
Draco’s glare softened slightly, a new, faint blush staining his cheeks. “I can’t…I don’t…I’m afraid I’m not really qualified to answer that question, Potter.”
, and he hoped Draco would be so impressed that he couldn't help but say yes. If not, Harry'd spent an awful lot of money and wasn’t entirely sure Draco would let him take the ring back no matter
“No, wait!” Draco blurted, not looking at him. “No... you can just leave it on, thank you.”

Harry mouthed wordlessly at her, shaking his head in disbelief. “That’s absolutely
Harry, you look lovely as always. And Ron, yes you
“I never said we couldn’t give them a sneak peak,” he whispered, swiping a thumb across his bottom lip before sauntering past Harry to where Pansy was sat with a paintbrush dangling between her fingers, also grinning, kissing her on the cheek and holding her arm out to inspect the glitter. Harry stayed rooted on the spot, neck uncomfortably warm, eyes following Draco across the room and on the verge of cancelling their plans with immediate effect when his thoughts were interrupted by a soft hand on his arm.
“Again,
. His near-tirade was thwarted with a pointed look from Hermione, who’d settled a placating hand on his arm and appeared to be reading from an invisible textbook.
Harry nearly came on the spot.
"We're completely ok."
Harry followed his gaze and grinned, watching as Pansy spun Hermione in dizzying circles while Ron clapped a beat.
“Draco, oh my-” Pansy exclaimed, nudging Draco’s arm, and finally-
expensive- gemstone Draco’s birthstone, but it would appear either red or green depending on the light it was held under, something Harry had found himself transfixed by whenever he'd checked on the ring to make sure it was still safely nestled in the bottom of his sock drawer. Admittedly, he'd become slightly obsessive, dashing upstairs every time Draco left the house to dig the little box out and stare at it like a complete idiot, but Harry didn't think he could have found anything else to represent both he and Draco so perfectly, and a little jolt of pride made him smile- he couldn't have done a better job, even if he did say so himself.
“Ridiculously.”
“I mean…I’m happy for you, that he’s here.
, darlings, I really am so pleased for you both- I’ll owl you the wedding binder tomorrow, Draco, after you’ve finished celebrating,” she added with a wink, letting go of Draco’s hand to fluff her fringe. She slid a hand into her bra, adjusting herself so that she was even more on display and running her tongue across her teeth, dabbing at her glittery red lips with the tip of a finger.
“Oh, so you wouldn’t mind hearing about the night me and Hermione had last week? She did this new thing where-“
“Don’t be silly, darling, a third will do.”
Smiling tightly at Ron as his heart leapt into his throat and stayed firmly lodged there, Harry urged his feet to move, his legs suddenly turned to jelly as his gaze landed on Draco.
Harry huffed, wrapping a secure arm around his middle and plucking the mug from his hand, taking a sip as his brain racked through ideas. Admittedly, he’d tried his fair share of techniques- and some of his greatest moves- in his annual attempt to persuade Draco to come, but no matter how well-shagged and compliant he’d ended up on Pride morning each year he’d been yet to change his mind.
“You remember what happened the last time you said that, right?” Harry chuckled, hooking a finger into the waistband on Draco’s shorts.
Signalling to Hermione that the wards were all sorted, Harry flopped onto the bench they’d found on a small patch of greenery to the left of the parade, taking a swig of water and trying to find Draco in the crowd.
“You’re…
“Oh, don’t be so vulgar!” Draco groaned, flapping a hand in his face.
“So this
She was also carrying an old, battered broomstick.
“Yes, incredibly.
“I know, but still, this is-“
“Then why- why does it hurt so much?”
“Yeah, I think I’ve got a pretty good idea,” Harry said with a grin, kissing Draco just behind his ear. “You can take charge later if you’d like,” he whispered, “after I’ve de-glittered your-”
“I know! I just asked you!”
He was praying to whoever would listen that the outcome was brilliant.
His breath hitched at the sight, suddenly ravenous; the sight of Draco alone made him hungry- he wanted to run his tongue up and down his body, taste the droplets of sweat that ran under the collar of his shirt, suck on the delicate skin of his arsehole, leave great big bite marks on his pale, fleshy arse. Instead, he settled for where he could reach, licking a stripe up Draco’s neck, pressing wet kisses across his damp nape, nibbling gently on his earlobe.
“Merlin, Harry,
“Well my cock feels like it’s just shrivelled up and
He watched as Draco’s eyes, hooded with desire, fluttered shut, spit-slicked lips parted on a silent cry as Harry nudged his prostate with every thrust of his hips. He didn’t know where to look, torn between watching ecstasy bloom across Draco's face, or watching his own cock as it disappeared again and again between Draco’s wobbling cheeks, his rim pink and swollen where it stretched around Harry.
“Hey- hey, none of that,” Harry said, cupping Draco’s cheek, “you are absolutely not silly, but I promise you, we’re one hundred percent safe. This is a celebration, and one we’re fully entitled to. Everyone here is on our side. It’s important to be careful, of course, but I promised to look after you, didn’t I? You know you’re safe with me. There’s absolutely nothing to worry about, except maybe Blaise getting so pissed he forgets he’s a wizard, but that’s only happened once.”
Now he wanted to
Draco was still uncharacteristically silent, eyes wary but feelings evident through the distinctive bulge in his trousers. He shifted under Harry’s gaze, self consciously crossing one leg over the other, and something inside Harry snapped.
“So, what’s this about a wedding binder?” Harry asked and to his amusement Draco's cheeks reddened, despite his eye roll.
“Harder,” Draco choked out, knuckles white where he was gripping the curve of the sink, eyes on Harry's as they moved together. “Please, I need you to fuck me harder—oh
“Are you sure, mate? I didn’t want to invite him, but you know how him and Hermione are…”
“I’m still mad at you for not telling,” she mumbled into his shoulder, "but congratulations, dickhead."
Spotting Draco wasn’t too difficult, and not just because of his bright blonde hair or glittery arse (he'd gotten rid of the wings half an hour after they'd arrived, to Hermione's relief)- Harry had spent the last seventeen years searching for him in a crowd, and it was ten times easier now that Harry was a trained auror and head over fucking heels in love with him. Draco would draw his eye no matter how many witches, wizards or drag queens stood in between them, and his gaze narrowed in on Draco easily, chatting to said drag queens with Blaise just outside of the wards they’d set up.
“Ron’s- oh.
Draco’s head snapped up as he came, Harry covering his lips with his own to muffle his shouts, hips bucking wildly as he painted their shirts with streaks of white liquid, staining the light material.
They broke apart, breathless, and as Harry went to speak Draco stopped him, placing three fingers against his lips once more.
“Salazar, you two are such
“We’re growing up, Harry,” Ginny sighed, leaning against him as they watched Luna kiss Draco on both cheeks, pulling away to admire the ring on his finger. “You’re getting married, and I’m adopting birds. Mum’ll be delighted.”
“Good, because they don’t do refunds,” Harry said, running his thumb across Draco’s bottom lip.
no curse, Potter—”

“Dignified as ever, I see- can I help you, Potter?”
the snogging.
Draco’s eyes met his then, wide and searching, before seemingly coming to a decision. “I didn’t particularly want to leave either, but I had no other choice.” Harry opened his mouth to protest, but Draco continued. “If this is to work again, Harry, something has to change. It has to be better. I can’t- I’m not living like that again, always feeling like second best—”
a form of entertainment?”
, watching Draco disappear down the hall with a satisfied sense of achievement.
“No, you’re not,” Draco chuckled, “but you’re still the best present I’ve ever received.”
Snapping out of his daze, Harry looked at her with confusion, but she was still staring rather intently at Draco.
Shaking the tension from his shoulders, he scolded himself internally for not getting a bloody grip- he'd faced
Her gaze slid from Harry to Draco, who was laughing at something Blaise was saying. As if sensing their eyes on him, he turned to smile brightly at them both and Harry smiled back tightly, wanting nothing more than to Accio Draco straight back to his side.
who approached
“If you’re sure, mate, but you have more faith than I- blimey.”
“Always so
“Whoa, whoa, hey!” Harry laughed as Draco flung his arms around Harry’s neck, kissing him so hard he felt his glasses crunch against his nose. He pushed his hips against Harry’s until he got the hint and slid both hands under Draco’s arse, hoisting him up into the air; he wrapped his bare legs around Harry’s waist, lips soft but insistent as they slid against Harry’s, making a small noise of contentment. He tasted sweet, like candyfloss and pumpkin juice and Harry couldn't help but groan softly, palms squeezing Draco’s arse.
His chest heaved, mind whirling, unsure of his next move now that they were alone; could feel the spell mingling uncomfortably with the blood pumping through his veins.
Harry’s jaw crashed promptly into the floor along with his last remaining shred of dignity as his cock swelled in his too-tight jeans, an embarrassing gurgle bubbling in his throat as Pansy started squealing with glee behind him. After staring at Draco with a strange sort of astonishment for what felt like an eternity, mind blank except for the alarm bells screeching in his brain- although that might have been Pansy- Harry all but launched across the room, tripping over his feet in his haste to cover him up.
“Hmm?”
“Blaise and I are fucking
“Oh.” He looked back at Harry, confusion morphing into comprehension. “
Harry took a step forward, and Draco took a step back, back bumping into the sink behind him.

for so fucking long he’d made Harry’s blood boil, would end up lounging in Harry’s arms, covered in glitter and smiling so brightly Harry’s heart felt like bursting.

“I’m sorry, I’ll stop teasing you,” he said, patting Harry’s chest apologetically before waltzing away into the kitchen as the rest of their friends began to gather together.
costume.” Ron snickered as she ran a finger down the lapel of Harry’s jacket, before she glanced around, clearly looking for someone. “Ginny should be here somewhere, she was just fetching me a drink—”
He trailed off at the look Draco gave him, eyes flicking from the offending garment to Harry and then back again. He regarded them both silently, still drying his nails, holding the hot pants between his thumb and forefinger as if they might bite him.
“Sure.”
“Pretty sure he knows I’m loyal, I just put a giant fucking rock on his finger.”
“I know what
Ron grinned, wrapping Harry in a tight hug. “You’ve got this, mate. I know you have.”
- that was-“
“Harry, Ron’s got the backpack if you need to take anything,” Hermione said, interrupting him as he subtly attempted to adjust himself in his jeans, “and I’ve packed a first aid kit in mine…is there anything else we need? Has everyone got water? Oh God, I hope we’ve got enough food, maybe I should have-“
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” Harry started, thankful his voice sounded much steadier than he felt, “you are possibly the most infuriating, egotistical, cold-hearted bastard I've ever met. You’ve never learnt how to make my coffee properly, you insist on picking my outfits for me, and you leave hair potions on every available surface but claim

“Fuck. I’m getting married,” Harry said with a disbelieving laugh, scrubbing a hand over his face.
“Come on, Ron, it’s
“Sex and diamonds- he’s not that hard to read,” she chuckled, laughing harder at the offended look Harry gave her.
Maybe he was really fucking miserable, alone on Halloween, wearing a stupid suit rather than their usual couples costume and pretending he was fine.
Harry would have laughed, would have even joined in, normally, except he couldn’t really concentrate on anything other than Draco; couldn’t tear his eyes away from Draco’s face, couldn’t form a thought other than Draco’s name, couldn’t bear the loss of Draco’s lips against his own. It was like he’d been doused with an extra strong love potion, stupidly exhilarated at the mere press of his back against Harry’s chest. He wanted to drag him home and lock the doors, wanted to consummate their engagement in every room of the house, wanted to hold Draco so tightly and make love to him over and over and over again until he knew without a doubt that Harry’s soulmate quip hadn’t been a quip at all.
“Give us a twirl, angel-boy!!” Ginny called and Harry glared at all three of them over his shoulder, shuffling this way and that in an attempt to hide Draco from the room.
Make him
for it? Who the fuck did he think he was?
Draco moaned as he slid back up, tongue swirling with practised ease, and Harry’s knees nearly buckled, an embarrassingly needy sound escaping from his throat before he could stop it. God, he didn't even care- he’d missed Draco’s blowjobs almost as much as he’d missed Draco himself.
As Harry stepped out of the Floo into what was normally Ron and Hermione’s open-plan living room, stood now in a makeshift nightclub, his first thought was,
He kissed Harry again, sucking on his tongue as he tried valiantly to press himself closer, legs impossibly tight. Harry laughed into the kiss as he heard Ron groan and could feel something bouncing off the back of his head.
, until suddenly he was right behind Draco, and suddenly he’d forgotten how to breathe, and suddenly he was on one knee, and
“Do you want me to do the charm?”
“Two years of marriage and you’ve already stopped snogging? Watch out, Draco, you’d better make the most of it now,” Pansy called, shrieking when Seamus squirted her with his water bottle. Draco chuckled quietly, using his hand to shield his eyes from the sun as he watched Seamus jump up and begin chasing her in circles, using water as ammunition and the rest of their friends as armour. He relaxed back against Harry’s chest, pulling Harry’s arms around his middle- probably to use as a shield in case any water was aimed his way- bare legs stretched out in front of him as he absentmindedly traced a pattern on Harry’s thigh.
“You’re not putting that on me.”

“God, this non-alcoholic stuff really is awful... oh I’m
“I know!”
, I’m not ruining it now.”
The urge to walk over and fuck Draco silly in public was too, especially since they were no longer together and surrounded by most, if not all, of the people he knew (including Arthur and Molly, two people he could live without ever seeing his naked arse).
“I thought you said Draco was coming?” Ron asked as if reading Harry’s mind, dropping a bottle of water into a familiar rucksack as Harry double knotted his laces for a fourth time.
Harry laughed loudly, gently removing Draco’s leg from his waist and placing it on the floor. "Would you stop that?”
“Would you like some water, Harry? I’m afraid you’ve gone very red,” Luna said and Harry forced his eyes from Draco to look at her, mind still embarrassingly vacant.
. Shitting fucking fuck. Ok." Harry inhaled deeply, glancing at Draco as his heart began to pound. "I’m going to do it.”
Ron huffed a small, derisive laugh, not looking at Harry as he valiantly tried to swallow the lump in his throat.
“Will you give me the present before or after?” He asked, eyes serious as he looked at Harry.
Harry chuckled, drawing his attention away from Draco to look at Ron properly.. “Yeah, me too. He owed me though, after this morning.”
No, it was very much
?” He asked, massaging Draco’s thigh lightly.
“Are you even listening?” Draco huffed, kissing him back regardless.
Inhaling the musky scent of Draco's cologne, he began pressing small, wet kisses to the soft skin under his lips and Draco shifted, sliding a leg in between Harry’s, sighing as their cocks brushed against one another. Harry lifted his head, searching Draco’s shining eyes, and after finding what he was looking for, leant forward, pressing his lips to Draco’s.
Contrary to popular belief, it really wasn’t that difficult.
you like this, I don’t—”
“I’ve been meaning to ask all night…why the fuck are you dressed like an accountant?"
know Superman, we watched it on the television a while ago." She blushed slightly, before adding, "he’s the rather gorgeous man in the cape, remember?”
An hour and multiple butterbeers later, Pansy was painting faces, Hermione was repacking bags and Harry was left wondering just how long it could possibly take for Draco to put on a pair of shorts- he hadn't reappeared him since he’d left the kitchen and in that time Harry'd had the bi flag painted on his cheek in the shape of a little heart, extended his back pocket so that he wouldn't have to take a bag (Hermione had tried handing him a large, hiking rucksack, which he’d adamantly refused), and re-laced his trainers three times, yet there was still no sign of Draco.
“Nope.”
, Potter."
He, Harry, had designed something
- you’re not even gay! You’re-”
after so many years of adamant refusal. In hindsight, gifting his extremely attractive Slytherin boyfriend a pair of extremely tiny shorts was possibly not his smartest idea, but Draco would look gorgeous no matter what he had on and, to be quite honest, the view was fantastic.
Draco’s brow furrowed slightly, following Harry’s gaze. “Would we not be safe without them?”
"It’s always been permanent, you fool,” Draco laughed through a sob, hand shaking as he held it out for Harry to take.
Draco smiled into his tea.
“That doesn't mean I'm not-“
,” she called over her shoulder to the rest of the group as she glided through the barrier of wards and hurried after Blaise, disappearing into the crowd.
“Annual occurrence, love,” he said before looking up at Blaise. “So who’ve you found this time?”
“Brilliant- Dean and Seamus should already be there, and then we’ll walk the rest.”
He looked worried, suddenly, and Harry cursed himself internally.
All he received in response was an eye roll, before Draco turned, pressing his back to Harry’s chest. Instinctively Harry’s hands came up to grip his waist, pulling them flush together, gyrating his hips slightly and drawing a low hum from Draco.
“You didn’t
the messy one.
“Hmm. I have a pretty good idea," Draco said with a smug smile, running a hand through his tousled hair. "Well, I thought you’d be
Draco slid a hand between Harry’s parted legs to fondle his balls, rolling them with the tips of his fingers the way he knew Harry liked, pulling off to run his tongue up the underside of his cock.
“No, you git-
“Will you be quiet?” Harry laughed, shoving him away, “The whole of London can hear you.”
‘Oh, for fuck’s sake- what do you want me to say? What’ll convince you?”
. Well, mostly on.”
“I’m going to ask Draco to marry me.”
“Harry, how many times do I have to tell you? I’m not coming, you’ll have to go without me.”
appalling.’”
He wasn’t stupid, and he knew a lust spell when he felt one (he’d become well acquainted with them after the war when, for a while, it had been difficult to walk down Diagon Alley without ending up with a cursed erection), and the intense tingling feeling shooting up and down his spine- among other places- was a tell-tale sign.
“You’re really that desperate for me to come?”
If Ron doubted his sincerity, he didn’t comment, instead picking up a large bowl of crisps. “Yeah, okay, sure… look, have some food, and just avoid him, ok? I’m going to check on Hermione, but you wait here, I’ll just be a minute.” Shoving the bowl into Harry’s hands and giving him a small smile, Ron grabbed his plate and strode away, edging around people back towards his wife.
Harry had almost forgotten what that looked like.
“We were teaching those two how to do a proper quickstep,” Draco said, nodding at Seamus and Dean, who- despite Harry’s limited dance knowledge- did not look like they were doing a proper quickstep at all. They were swaying on the spot, Dean’s hands in Seamus’ back pockets as they murmured quietly to one another, exchanging soft kisses that made Harry feel like an intruder. “Or at least trying to,” he added with a chuckle, looking back at Harry. “You two have been having fun?”
“Oh, don’t even start, you haven’t touched a vagina for nearly a decade.”
You think I’ve
He stopped abruptly, pulling almost all the way out, ignoring Draco’s protesting whine and his own inner turmoil from halting the best sex he’d had for a long time.
“It’s nothing, just a ridiculous thing Pansy and I made as children.”
“Don’t fret, darling, you can tell me later.”
He pulled the hot pants out from behind his back, offering them out to Draco, who took them with an air of reluctance- or possibly disgust- that wasn’t all too surprising.
“What?” Harry, caught off guard by the blunt greeting and the drink in his hand, which he swore was not only smoking but changing colour, blinked. “
Pulling them out from under his old Hogwarts robes, he sat back on his haunches, looking down at the rainbow coloured sequin hot pants with renewed fondness. Turning them over so that they gleamed in the sunlight streaming through the windows, he thought back to the moment he’d bought them; it had been a drunken impulse, really, after stumbling down a street in Amsterdam on the third night of Ron’s stag do and spotting them on display in a shop window. He’d stood transfixed for a minute or so (although knowing the state he’d been in, it could have been an hour), unwaveringly sure that if he didn’t take them home and see Draco’s ‘arse sparkle’, he would most likely die. After fumbling with his Muggle money to the raucous laughter of his arsehole friends, he’d pocketed the hot pants with a grin and a mission to get Draco into them as soon as he got home.
“You two are worse than we are, at least we have a good reason.” Draco retorted, accepting a kiss on the cheek from Harry with a smug smile before lacing heir fingers together.
“Careful, Draco, your crassness is very telling,” he said, expertly catching the bottle of pumpkin juice Draco threw at him, “and while my congratulations were sincere, I actually came over to say goodbye.”
you,’ Draco rebuked, swatting her hand away, before catching Harry’s eye as he raised an eyebrow. ‘Ok,
“Hmm. I am, I suppose.” There was a beat of silence before she looked at him and, despite her flushed cheeks and flyaway hair and glittery face paint, Harry could see that she was. She sighed, looking back at Draco and Luna, slipping her hand into Harry’s and resting her cheek on his shoulder. “I wasn’t sure we’d get here, you know,” she said softly, “either of us. After we ended things and before I discovered the joys of tribadism, I thought that was it- I think after you live through a war, it’s hard to imagine a better future. A brighter one. And now...well, I’ve got a nest-full of feathery kids and you’re about to spend all your money on a wedding for the fussiest man on the planet, so I’d say we did alright, despite everything.”
Blaise tapped the side of his nose with a smirk, signalling secrecy, but his gaze slid to a spot behind them. Harry and Draco twisted around to find a ridiculously attractive couple sitting at a small coffee shop table just beyond their wards, bent over it to talk to one another. They appeared to be in their early forties; the man in a tight white shirt, rolled-up sleeves showing off a deep tan. He was holding hands with a woman harry assumed to be his wife, who was clad in skin-tight red dress that matched her tall stiletto heels, her long dark hair shining
person would have spotted him.
A single tear rolled down Draco’s cheek as he nodded frantically, reaching down and cupping Harry’s face to urge him up off the ground. Harry wobbled slightly, his brain suddenly turned to mush, steadied when Draco slid both hands into his hair and crushed their lips together in a kiss so fierce it felt like a promise.
“No.”
“God, Draco,” Harry sighed, collapsing onto the sofa beside him. “Don’t scream like that! I thought something bad had happened.”
“Sorry?”
“Promise?”
“Nothing, darling, that’s my point. Nothing about this…
“Portugese, I think.” Pansy said wistfully, watching Blaise and his new friends like a hawk. “I have half a mind to join them, but Blaise is too much of a spoilsport to let me...it’s worth a shot, though, don’t you think?” She asked the question seemingly to herself and before they could say anything she’d kissed them both on the cheek, giving Draco’s hand a little squeeze.
"'C'mon, love,
for it—” Draco whimpered and Harry’s face heated, his inebriated brain finally catching up. He didn’t know what had come over him; Draco’s spell had clearly loosened his tongue, reducing him to a mindless dolt, words tumbling before he could think them through.

“I bought them a while ago, but you’ve never agreed to come, so I just…”
He felt dizzy, harder than he had ever been in his life, and Draco knew, if the smirk Harry caught a glimpse of when he tossed his head back onto Harry’s shoulder was anything to go by.
“Yes, we really have,” Draco replied on a yawn, tucking his head more firmly beneath Harry’s chin, who slid an arm around his waist.
“Oh.” Harry’s heart fell slightly at the look on Draco’s face, his wide, hopeful smile. “No, my love, not really.”
Draco laughed, swinging Harry’s arm gently.
“Harry James Potter, I
“Dead serious,” Harry grinned, patting his front pocket.
“But I

, for fuck's sake! That walk was
Harry hummed in agreement, looking for Draco and panicking slightly when he couldn’t find him. “You think I don’t know that?”
“OI! Mate! Can we congratulate you or what?” Ron yelled and Harry grinned, looking over at his friends as Draco laughed, pushing Harry towards them as Pansy barrelled into him with a screech.
“So, ‘ow are you doin’ then?” Ron asked, still chewing, eyes filled with concern. Swallowing his food down with a swig of Butterbeer, he leant forward, beckoning Harry closer with a claw and lowering his voice. “You know, with Malfoy? He’s here somewhere, he arrived with Parkinson about half an hour ago.”
kinky,” he smirked, “but I really must be off. Enjoy the rest of your celebrations.”
fault,
seem a bit dramatic, even for him.
Draco looked at him for a second longer before kissing him again, standing and picking his mug up off the table.
“Just turn it off then! I’ve got the remote here, I’ll do it-”
,” he continued before Harry could contest, because he was entirely
, darling, that’s reason enough.”
“I’ll give you this then, shall I?” Harry teased, placing the remote on the sofa cushion beside Draco. “It might even inspire you...you could
“Why, don’t you like them?” Draco pouted, staring down at his own shimmer-dusted chest before looking back at Harry with feigned sadness, kohl-lined eyes sparkling with mirth.
Draco watched him as he approached, eyebrows raised, an amused smirk dancing across his lips- although, as he drew closer, Harry could see a slight flicker of anxiety behind his eyes, something few people would pick up on, but was glaringly obvious to him.
“I don’t have much of a bloody choice, do I?” Draco grumbled, “unless you-”
He reckoned he should have felt angrier, pondering the thought as he ran his tongue over a tight, pink nipple, humming as Draco arched with a gasp against his mouth, hands now clutching at his hair. He sucked on it absentmindedly, feeling strangely calm, the uncomfortable, prickly feeling gone, sedated now that he had Draco so close. Turning his attention to the other nipple, he lapped at it, still kneading Draco’s arse with a bruising grip, before sliding a finger between his cheeks to pet at his tiny, furled hole.
“I don’t know, that seems-”
They stood together in a tight embrace, swaying slightly, muffled noise from the party outside now the only sound in the room.
“'Course, Luna told me. She promised it wasn’t a sex thing, so I didn’t see the problem.”
“Ok, good, I'm sorry- can you see the others? I think we've lost them...”
“Hmmm.”
Both Ginny and Luna looked at him like he was being particularly thick. “Surely you haven’t forgotten the retreat Draco and I attended together last summer?” Luna asked and Harry blanched, gaping at her with horror.
“You- I-" Harry spluttered indignantly, staring at Draco in shock, "you wouldn't-"
Draco said nothing, just nodded his head slightly, cheeks red.
“Yes, love, don’t worry, we’re fine.
Maybe Draco hadn’t counted on confrontation- which was daft, given the typical side effects of the spell- but confrontation was what he was going to get.
“Yeah?”
- he turned around, eyes widening with shock as they landed on Harry.
, Potter…I don’t know what you’re talking about—”
“You’re joking, right? You did hear all that shit I just spouted about glowing?”
Draco smiled for what seemed like the millionth time that day, shaking his head fondly.
“At least I didn't panic,” Ron said seriously, “that could have ruined things.”
Draco shuddered as he straightened, Harry’s cock slipping from his arse with a lewd pop, shoulders tense. Turning away from the mirror, hurt flashed across his face until he schooled it masterfully, clearly astonished.
“So I don’t get to change my mind?”
Abruptly, Harry came, too far gone to give a warning; he groaned as he jerked pathetically, stomach muscles rippling, his orgasm so intense he felt like crying for a second time.
Harry froze, lowering his wand slightly. “
Harry assumed he’d come as a ghost, although the notion was far fetched; no bedsheet in sight, only a pair of skin-tight white leather trousers, a shirt, unbuttoned and almost transparent tucked into them, and as if the trousers didn’t draw enough attention to his arse, a pair of six-inch heels. His hair was tousled in the messy way Harry liked-
Slapping a hand over his mouth, Draco stared in horror as the man on screen began chomping on a cockroach, the look of revulsion on his face not dissimilar to the one on Draco’s. Turning his head slowly, he fixed Harry with a horrified look. “Are you not seeing this?”
Cursed, even.
, but it would be really fucking stupid. You think I’m willing to risk Azkaban for a shag? I thought you knew me better than that.” His eyes, smudged with dark mascara, bored into Harry’s, who looked away, abashed. “I think you’re a horny bastard, and I think this is just love, Harry. It’s not a spell. If I had to take a wild guess, I’d say you…you miss me.” He looked slightly embarrassed at that, eyes trained on a spot just past Harry’s shoulder, so Harry grasped his chin and turned his face towards him, tilting up to press a gentle kiss to his lips.
“Fuck, Draco, I can’t—” voice breaking, Harry released the grip he had on Draco’s chest to wrap a hand around his neck, forcing his head up so that their eyes remained connected in the mirror, splaying his fingers across Draco’s slender throat to hold him in place.
Draco fought with renewed determination. He fought for freedom from the Dark Lord's reign. He fought for his friends and family. Most importantly, he fought for his true beliefs.
''Are you okay, mate?'', Harry passed Ron a weak smile and nodded.
Draco arrived at his family Manor in late March. For the first time, he wished he hadn't returned. He was forced to return home.
Harry felt frustrated in his search for the truth. The mysterious flashes left him longing for the unknown. Harry felt overwhelmed by the emotions he felt through each memory. The intensity left his heart hurting.
'' Why did you do it? I promised you! I promised you that we'd both get through it together! Why did you obliviate me like that? I LOVED YOU! Did you not trust me?!''
It sickened him to see his warrior mother draw shaky breaths and struggle to walk. It hurt him to see their strength drain from them as they screamed under the Dark Lord's curse.
, so yes, I killed. I am not ashamed that I removed such filth. I am rightful in my pride in removing those unworthy of magic. I am Draco Malfoy and my arrogance is rightful and fully acknowledgeable.''
Draco Malfoy's voice rose to levels it had never reached.
The Malfoy heir, whom everyone saw as weak and cowardly, slashed his wand viciously in the air. His every move was graceful and accurate as he unhesitantly killed every Death Eater who stepped up to cover their Lord.
Many learned of Draco Malfoy's uncovered personality and they all swarmed to him. The teenager never once failed to return the comfort and assurance he had gotten.
'' HARRY POTTER IS DEAD!'', the statement was followed by the Dark Lord's screeching, high-pitched cackle. The Death Eaters echoed the sentiment and the screams they got in return to the statement rivaled their insane laughter.
Draco smiled bitterly and saw how the others flinch at the apparent pain on his face, ''The Dark Lord resides in my home. We are the main targets of his anger because of our constant presence. His anger is an indication of failure and his failure is Potter's success.''
Augustus Rookwood drew his wand and threw a vicious Cruciatus at Draco. The man stood over him as Draco writhed, '' You had so much potential but you turned out to be a blood-traitor. I should've known when you failed to kill Dumbledore last year. You never wanted the Dark Mark. We should've noticed.''
Harry cried as he recalled the blank spaces in his memories. He cried when he thought of what Draco had done. He cried because of how much Draco had hurt.
He slashed the air and sent our vicious curses to the Dark Lord's army and watched with satisfaction when they fell at his feet with anger and betrayal painted on their faces.
'' Someone shot a stinging hex at his face and Draco was called to identify him. He was the best choice for the task as he had studied with him for the past six years but Draco lied!'', Draco clenched his fists as the twins released insane cackles.
He pulled it out to see that it was a Hogwarts tie. However, the tie looked to be a cross between Slytherin and Gryffindor. The crests were mixed and the colors clashed.
The Gryffindor table tensed.
'' Yes.''
'' Why wouldn't I be, Potter?'', that had gotten a few chuckles and he saw Weasley and Granger look at the other students in surprise.
Draco hid all he was behind his cover but if there was anyone close to really knowing him, it was Harry Potter. The boy had seen him break down, had seen him suffer, had seen him lower his wand. He knew Harry was present that night even if he couldn't see him.
Draco turned at the last moment to see Harry and Voldemort's wands joined together. His heart jumped as the green light rebounded. It never failed to amaze him how much the deathly spell match his beloved's eyes.
He threw out a strong shield in front of Fred Weasley before the boulders crashed over him, '' Watch your back idiot.''
Harry Potter pushed the taller boy, ''You decided it was better to erase two years of our relationship. Why didn't you bring it up after the war then?''
Please do not repost my work. Translations are allowed but please give credit when due.
Tears streamed down Harry's face as his locked memories broke free fully.
Draco laughed at Harry's plight and kissed him softly, '' You have no need to worry, Harry Potter.''
'. Draco's breath left him as though he'd been punched in the stomach.
Amidst the wreckage and remnants of Hogwarts, between the pale and wounded bodies, the glowing smiles on the family tree shone the brightest.
'' Take it.''
Harry shook his head as Draco Malfoy's face entered the memories. He pushed away his heightened frustration and made his way to class, silently brewing in his turmoil.
With a dry sob, he gave in to the darkness behind his eyes.
Harry's gazed slid over to the Slytherin table. He found his gaze resting on the snake's table more than usual. It had been a month since Harry returned to Hogwarts. The feeling of content cheered him up immensely but even that emotion was overshadowed.
Neville rolled his eyes, momentarily surprising him, and pulled out a batch of potions. Draco silently took the various potions and put his trust in the Gryffindors.
'' Father'', he grinned mischievously and his father huffed in response.
Slowly, a branch joined to a decipherable picture next to Harry's and there was a moment of utter shock.
Draco swallowed before continuing, '' They all escaped. Only Granger was hurt but they'll nurse her back to health. They're on a mission. From what I know they've almost succeeded.''
'' Voldemort called for him. He said he has to go.'', Ron's quiet voice was followed by a deadly silence.
at the Death Eater in front of Remus Lupin and the werewolf looked at him with surprise before turning to help his wife.
It didn't help that his parents were in the Dark Lord's inner circle. He was forced to accompany them when joining the Dark Lord's presence. Draco felt his life crashing around him.
Draco knew he was due to return to Hogwart's in a few hours and he almost cried in relief. He was staring blankly at the wall when the gate to his cell opened. It was his father.
'' I saw what he did after we escaped.'', he gripped Draco'd arm causing Draco to flinch on instinct.
Neville had grown a strong friendship with the Malfoy heir and he would be sure to not lose it.
Draco was confident and prideful, but never arrogant. There was a time when he believed everything he's parents taught him. He believed in Pureblood Supremacy. He believed Muggleborns were at the bottom of the hierarchy and undeserving of magic. He believed all Muggles were filth and should be eradicated.
But then, Draco grew up. He ventured into forbidden territory. He started rethinking everything his parents taught him. By his sixth year, he thought of himself as ignorant.
His mother let out a sob and wrapped her arms around his tall frame. He flinched slightly when she pressed against his wounds.
There, in the entrance, stood a sobbing Harry Potter. He looked utterly disheveled, tear streaks running down his face, cheeks blooming red and eyes showing a large quantity of hurt.
'' I'll make it up to you?'', Harry said unsurely but exhaled in relief when Draco wrapped him in his arms.
The once-proud Lord Malfoy was staring at his son with wide, fearful eyes. Draco looked at his father, expressionless.
Draco hated the situation his parents had forced him into but he struggled to hate them. He allowed another's marking to brand his skin to protect those who birthed him. He accepted the task of murder to avoid his parents being murdered. He gave every action a second thought so that he wouldn't incur his parents to tortured.

Lucius Malfoy's eyes pooled with tears as he helped his son stand. His son who he had raised with so much care, was reduced to a mere broken shell. He felt ashamed for the calamities his actions had brought onto his family.
'' My loyalty is with my family only. You've hurt my loved ones more than enough and I'll let the world burn to the ground before I let that happen again.'', Lucius Malfoy's head was held high and the tone was befitting of the once proud and untainted house of Malfoy.
"No, Sweetheart. I don’t. And I don’t plan on having any." She whispered.
“Hey! My son doesn’t drool!” Daphne and Draco laughed and he took his son back from Olivia’s arms so the woman could cuddle her first grandson.
He moaned loudly when the Saviour pushed his finger inside of him, without any lube.
The month following Scorpius’ birth went by both quickly and desperately slowly. For the first days, they had daily appointments at St Mungo’s to monitor him and see if everything was okay. Then, when it was clear the baby was as good as he could be, the appointments went to once a week. For Astoria, however, things were a bit more complicated as she didn’t seem to recover very well. She was more and more exhausted; the pain wasn’t fading away and the paleness of her face made Draco’s heart stop each time he entered the room. The only times she seemed fairly alive was when she had Scorpius in her arms. She would feed him at least once a day, but Draco would take care of the other meals. He wouldn’t let Poppy or another House Elf feed the baby. Even at night.
“I know. But I don’t want anything to happen to you and Scorpius. Every time... I’m cursed, Draco. Every time I love someone, they die. And I can’t have this happen to you both. I love you way too much to risk your lives.”
"Good night too, Dray."
"Yes. I had soup and a bit of bread."
"Huh, sorry Malfoy. I should go and take care of it. Talk later?"
“True.” Draco grinned and waddled back into the bathroom, making the other man growl.
"What? No, just... wait for me, alright? I’ll be right back."
“Why? Because I was raised by a Death Eater? Or because I was one myself.”
“What for?” Draco asked, his voice plain and eyes everywhere but on the man. He didn’t want to be weak again. That’s what the vibrant green did to him every single time.
"Do you remember the way to my room?" Draco asked when they landed in the manor’s living room. He only used his personal fireplace from time to time, and he made it work only one way: out. The rest of the time, he, Astoria or their guests would use this one. "I have to pass by Tory’s chambers. To see if she’s okay and let her know I’m back."
When he left the room, there wasn’t any stress in him. He knew Poppy since he was born as she was the one to take care of him. So, he had absolutely no doubt she was fit for the job. With her, Scorpius was in good hands. Draco walked through the hallway and went down the stairs and into the living-room. Still no Potter. Maybe he really left, after all. He had to fight the sudden sadness than ran through his body. He knew this would happen, that’s why he wasn’t surprised or angry. Just sad. He nearly lost his son and his wife today. And now, he lost his... his what? Friend? Lover? He sighed. Merlin, he didn’t even know what Potter was for him.
"They all are good fucks, if we listen to you."
"Do you? Do you have regrets?"
"Fucking Merlin! Potter, help me walk her back to the bed. Poppy!" The tiny creature appeared; her eyes wide upon seeing her mistress. "Go search for Dr Gobler. Now!" He couldn't care being polite right now, but the House Elf didn’t seem to mind as she disappeared in a ‘Crack’.
"They will always talk, you know? But it doesn't mean you have to listen to them."
“Yes. Still tired and pale, but better. I was hoping she could spend Christmas with us, but the doctors said it was very unlikely. That it would be too much for her.”
Draco still didn’t know what they were for each other but that didn’t really matter for now.
“It went well, right?” Harry asked, slight worry in his voice.
Those words broke something in Draco. No. One night could never be better. It would never be enough. He was afraid that if he took a taste, he won’t be able to live without him. Yet, right now, he knew he wouldn’t be able to say no. Even if he had to suffer after that.
As Draco was about to answer, a short blonde guy came at their table, a frown on his face.
life?"
“Yes, Master.”
Draco immediately lifted his head from the mattress and turned it to the left, then to the right. Indeed, at the end of the bed, there was a bright orb of light.
"Are you saying you’re an idiot, Malfoy?" Potter grinned at him.
"Because you don't want to, or because you think
A few seconds later, Potter's cock was buried deep in Draco's throat and the man was moaning loudly, his head thrown back in ecstasy, his fingers in the blonde locks. Draco hummed around the cock, sending vibrations all the way up, then he moved his head back, sucking hard.
"Draco, It’s okay." Her voice was weak, terrifying.
During the kiss, he could feel Potter’s sex growing hard again and it made his respond. He moved his hand down and grabbed his partner’s member, giving it a few strokes. Then, the young blond man rose from the bed to go sit on Potter’s hips, never ending the kiss. He rolled his hips a bit, moaning when the man’s tip brushed against his sensitive hole.
He resisted turning around to look at what was holding him behind but, after nearly thirty minutes, he gave up and looked over his shoulder, only to gasp. There he was, the little shit, almost lying over a table, is tongue deep inside Blondie's mouth. What a way of dumping someone!
"Why so?"
Astoria smiled sweetly at him. "Don't worry, Dear. I just couldn't sleep, so I got up to have a cup of tea. How was your evening?" Then, she seemed to notice the dark-haired man behind her husband. "Oh, sorry! You have some company!"
"Hey, Malfoy. Parkinson."
They had shaken hands, that night and Potter had congratulated him for his wedding, but nothing more, before the dark-haired man had left with a giggling Aaron – or so he said he was called.
“Parfait, merci beaucoup.”
"Tory? Sweetheart, what’s going on? Tell me, are you hurt?"
“To be honest Potter, I can’t believe I have a son either.”
"Because he could be with you at this ball. As your date, not a friend. I was jealous to see how easy it was for you; how open you were with your sexuality."
"Not all of them. I could tell you some real horror stories. You would freak out!"
The three adults laughed at his question and the blond lowered himself to show his son to the boy. “I keep him because I love him and because he’s cute. Don’t you think he is cute?”
"Yes, but we were engaged a year before that. I couldn’t risk falling in love with someone when I knew I was to marry her and take those vows."
He felt Potter put his hands on his waist and pull his cock out a bit before pushing it in again, slowly.
“Because you never let me.” Harry moved even closer and gently kissed Draco’s lips. “I love you, Draco Malfoy. I've wanted more with you for years; I was attracted to you. But since that first night we slept together… it all changed. It's not only physical, far from it. You made me fall in love with you.”
"He just came here for a week or so before I told him to go back home. He was a good fuck, but way too clingy."
"What's bothering me is that you're gay, Malfoy!"
“Master has called Poppy?”
"’kay. Just a bit more."
The two men went back to the elevators together and a few minutes later, they both disappeared in green flames.
“Astoria told us she was happy he stayed with you, that she didn’t want you to live all this alone. She said he is a good man. Good for you
She looked at the heavy-looking brooch in awe. The afternoon sun overflowing the living-room reflected on the big emerald. “That’s... Thank you, Mr Potter. I haven’t seen this jewel in years. It belonged to my grand-mother, Irma Black. I always remember her wearing it, even if I was still young when she died. You should... Maybe you should give it to Andromeda, instead.”
and smile and kiss him. It was easy, simple and, even if they didn’t really have sex anymore, they didn’t care. Draco was a bit frustrated sometimes, when Harry was going out of the shower, his hair dripping wet and a towel loose around his hips, but those times, they would just kiss and grope and rub against each other until they came. Nothing more.
Just then, the door opened and they jumped on their feet. It wasn't the doctor, but one of the nurses. And she was holding a little bundle of white clothes in her arms.
“Could we stop talking about sex? Or else I’ll end up shagging you right here. And I don’t want us to be kicked out for exhibition.”
do it. You have to take him.
“Yes. We both know that. But we’re adults now and if anything happens or changes, we’ll talk it out. Maybe we’ll break up in a few months or in a few years, even if I doubt that. But it will never change my love for them.”
"Poor little Harry Potter." Draco chuckled, then yelped when the said man bit his hip's skin.
********
Draco winced, slightly disgusted.
But after a few minutes of light touches and silence, Potter came off his body with a sigh and slowly took his member out of Draco. The move made him moan, both at the feeling and at the loss. He loved having him inside, to feel so full he could hardly move. And now, as Potter was searching for his wand to clean both of them, Draco felt emptier than ever. As if Potter made a hole in him that could never be filled again. Suddenly, the young man felt like crying. But he couldn’t. He had to hold back his tears until Potter’s gone.
“Yes. He’s a bit tiny as he’s one month premature, but he breathes on his own and he is healthy. Here, take him.” She moved closer and put the sleeping new-born in his arms. “I have to go back to your wife. Knock on the door if you need anything.”
“Just... Why? Is the view that exciting?”
"Mr Malfoy. If you want me to save your wife and your baby’s life, you
panicking after all.
Draco could feel himself harden in his pants. And he could feel Potter too. Already hard and big under his butt. It felt nice to be the reason of a man's arousal. The blonde man rolled his hips a bit, earning himself a moan.
Draco hit him playfully and sat up. “You definitely are a jerk, Potter. Can you clean us? I left my wand next door.”
thinking about it? About
“I found it in Sirius’ house. And, as you’re a Black, I thought... It should be yours.”
Draco froze. He was rummaging inside the bag for Scorpius’ bottle and milk, and wasn’t quite sure of what he heard. “Sorry, what?”
“If it can appease you. I promise you, Draco, that I will not disappear from your lives. I promise you that I will tell you if anything happens. And I promise not to break your heart.”
Draco raised his hands in frustration. "Come on Potter! What's bothering you so much with me having a wife? That's ridiculous!"
“For the next few days, yes.”
“You know, I had doubts too-” A cry stopped him.
He was good at it and knew perfectly well how to drive the other man crazy. He sucked on Potter's member, rolled his balls between his fingers, licked at the tanned sensitive skin around his groin, again and again, his eyes never leaving Potter's, studying his face and reactions.
“Thank you, Doctor. What happened, exactly?”
"No, you don’t-" Another scream. "You don’t understand. I
"It was Luna’s mother’s name. Pandora Molly Lovegood-Weasley."
"I know that too."
Potter frowned and, after a few seconds, his eyes widened. "Oh! Aaron? Wow, that was... two years ago? Almost forgot this one. Nah, Aaron was only around for a few weeks.”
"You too."
“But it’s in two months!” Olivia Greengrass cried. “How long will it take for my daughter to recover?”
A long silence welcomed his words and Draco’s gaze got lost in the green eyes. Then, without warning, Potter walked closer and kissed him. Draco’s first reaction should have been to push him away, but he didn’t. He couldn’t. Instead, he melted in the kiss and grabbed the strong arms, putting them around his body. He craved for his touches, for his kisses. He craved for his body against his. Naked and sweaty. And, above everything, he craved to feel him inside of him again. Big and deep.
"The manor’s huge, Potter. Astoria as a full wing all to herself. I’m sure that
"Sorry, Kyle. I’ll be there in a bit. Order new drinks, will you?"
“I think that’s her way of thanking us for taking care of Scorpius when she can’t. We don’t need to do anything, trust me.”
"Good. Boring. Daphne came to visit with Oliver. He is so sweet. I really hope our son will be that sweet!"
"Y-Yes. I... it hurts, Draco."
"You never noticed because it never mattered."
“Sorry. I’m just a bit... scared to take the plane.”
"It’s my life, Potter. So, yes, I did. The question is, why are
A groom took their luggage to the elevator and led them to the third level and to their suite. It was beautiful. A big living-room was on the right, and the bedroom on the left with a closet and a sitting area. The bathroom was all made of marble with a large bathtub and a walk-in shower. All three rooms had French-doors leading to a huge balcony and a stunning view on the Mediterranean Sea.
“And you? How do you feel about me?”
The edges of his lips rose up a bit. How he loved hearing that. “Well, I know you are. What I don’t know is
“Yes. It’s very calming to look at the clouds from up there.”
Harry complied and took Draco’s hard-on in his hand and started to stroke him in rhythm with his hips. He fucked him harder, plunging deep into his hole again and again until the blonde man screamed and came hard between their bodies, struck by his orgasm. His hole tightened around the man’s member, making him come too soon after, spilling his seed deep inside of him.
“Eleven. Then we have to take the renting car and there’s a one-hour drive to Saint-Raphael. You’re sure you want to drive? We could have booked a cab.”
"Well, let’s just say I get bored easily. Kyle, for example. I met him last Saturday at a party and I’m trying really hard not to tell him to leave right know."
Draco sigh in relief. "You’re such a jerk, Potter."
enter his dreams. But, even asleep, he was the best, so dreams were just dreams. He never crossed Potter again after the night they shared, not even once at the Ministry or at the bar. He heard about Weasley and Lovegood’s daughter’s birth and thought about sending him a congratulation letter, but he didn’t. It was too painful to hope.
Suddenly understanding, the younger man opened his eyes wide and jumped out of bed. "I’m coming with you!"
"I know."
will raise him well. It will be the both of us, Tory. It’s always been.”
over him so he would sleep a bit more. He wasn’t angry about that. Instead, he would spend long minutes watching the man moving around slowly with the baby in his arms, singing him lullabies until he would fall asleep again.
"No! Doctor, I-"
"And a wife."
“You’re a Wizard too, in case you forgot. And you took the plane before, for that World tour of yours.”
Harry breathed in and out twice, closed his eyes and smiled. “Okay. Sorry I freaked out. It’s just new for me. Not taking a plane, but being in love. I’ve always been afraid of those engines, but I didn’t have anything to lose then. But now... I suddenly realized how much I have to lose, now.”
to be like that.
Now, he was just an inch away from Draco, clearly waiting for a sign, a word from the former Slytherin to kiss him, and Draco desperately wanted to, But… it was Potter. Could he trust him? Could he… surrender to him? Plus, there was the rule: no love story until the baby's birth. He wasn't sure he could stay away from Potter once he'd have a taste of him.
"Quick, Doctor! She’s bleeding!"
, Draco thought. Finally, he was his.
When he entered the living room, Draco had a dreamy smile and a flushed face, which made his wife gently laugh.
"Well, sorry to tell you that, Potter, but you sure need to higher your standards. You seem to have a type, but I’m sure there’s some pretty blond guys out there who are more than just good fucks."
The elevator’s doors opened and they both looked at each other before Potter gestured to follow him.
"Please?"
"Okay. I’ll leave you alone, then. Do you remember Dr Gobler’s coming tomorrow? For your eighth month’s appointment."
Weasley kissed Potter's cheek, got up and disappeared, leaving the both of them in an awkward silence.
"Yes. The tea worked wonderfully."
They smiled at each other and walked back to the main house only to find Narcissa sitting in the outdoor living room, Scorpius on her lap.
“Oh, it’s good you’re here, Harry Dear. I feel relieved to know Draco’s not alone to face all that. Even if they are cute, taking care of a baby alone is hard. No matter how much you love them.”
Until next time.
“You’re all warm, baby.”
"Don’t tell me you haven’t dated anyone in... three years?"
“Yes, I changed Scorpius and left him in the nursery with Poppy. I needed to get some sleep.”
Then, after five days, they finally left for Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat on the Thursday and discovered the Grand Hotel du Cap Ferrat. Harry watched in awe as Draco checked them in at the desk in fluent French.
Potter snorted and sipped at the drink he took with him. "Yeah, I kinda remember that. Was just trying to be..."
An awkward silence fell between the two.
"No. You said ‘didn’t’. What changed, Malfoy?"
“No. Just you speaking French. It’s terribly sexy.”
“I said I’m scared. I’m scared to ride that fu- that plane. Happy?”
"Why would I be jealous, Potter? I have everything I want. Name, wealth, a baby on the way…"
"Yeah." They fell silent until Potter spoke again, searching for his words. "You were... wonderful, Malfoy."
"You're a selfish little girl, Miss Parkinson."
The sun was slowly rising outside.
“Yes. He is...” His voice cracked a little. The emotions seemed too big for his heart. So big it felt ready to burst. “He is perfect.” Maybe it was the sound of his voice, but the baby suddenly opened his eyes, and Draco’s heart stopped once again. “It’s... he has Tory’s eyes.” Indeed, two very clear blue orbs were watching him. Or seemed too, as a baby can’t see really far at birth. “Hello, you.” He whispered. Then, he remembered. “Hello, Scorpius. My son.”
The door opposite from him opened and a nurse looked at the only couple in the room. "Miss Weasley? You can come in. Sir, you can wait here for now, I'll come for you in a bit."
“It’s super late, Potter!”
The man lifted his head and looked up at him. "Already?"
Her big eyes widened even more and seemed to get teary. “Really Master? Sure Master! Poppy will take care of little master as best as she can.”
“Good. Cause I really want to make love to my boyfriend, right now.”
to be a jerk as always. As Scorpius started to cry, he took him out of his baby carriage.
“I’m going to see other guests. I’ll see you around?”
Draco sighed and nearly fell on the couch. She will be fine. Those words looped in his head.
“Wait! I would like to feed him. Can I?”
"Hum, I'm waiting for Tory. I mean, Astoria. Y-You?" Then, after another look at Weasley's belly, he added. "Sorry, that's obvious I guess."
Draco slowly looked away from the window and back to the bed. There, Harry was lying on his back, his eyes closed. Settled securely on his chest, Scorpius was sleeping soundly on his belly, wearing his bunny onesie. The sight was lovely, warm. It felt like home. Draco walked to the bed, lied next to the two men of his life and smiled when Harry opened his eyes and looked at him.
Draco chuckled. “We still have Scorpius next door, you know?”
Draco frowned. “I already said I wanted you to stay, Potter.”
It was awkward as fuck. Draco didn’t know what to say and those things don’t happen a lot. He
Scorpius had been spoiled for his first Christmas. After the ton of gifts he received from family and friends back at home, Narcissa added even more to the pile. Toys, clothes, a bank account... Draco didn’t even know what to think about it. But he remembered how he was spoiled too when he was a kid, so it wasn’t quite a surprise, after all.
“You mean Harry?” She nodded and bounced Scorpius on her knees nervously. “Yes. Everything’s perfect, Mother.” He studied her face a little. What was she really thinking? She loved him enough to accept his relationship, but that didn’t mean she approved it. “I love him, you know? And he does too.”
“Just once or twice. I mostly used Portkeys. And I was raised by Muggles. So, all this,” He showed the full waiting salon of Heathrow Airport with his hand. “is quite normal to me. But you... Sorry if I’m surprised you even considered it.”
Their orgasms felt intense and endless. Perfect. When he finally came back on earth, Draco opened his eyes he couldn’t even remember closing. Potter was still on him, breathing heavily and his cock was slowly softening, allowing his cum to run out of Draco’s hole. Legs still spread wide, Draco gently run his hands on the man’s back, giving him time to calm down.
“He is so little. I’m so sorry Draco. I should have rested more. Now he is premature and...”
Potter smiled. "You thought about all that a lot, right?"
"… and Pure-Bloods fancy having an heir. A male one, preferably, but I'm not the kind to care about that. Plus, it was my father's last wish for me to marry and follow the Malfoy's bloodline."
"What?"
don’t take the plane.”
The young men got up from the couch and moved to the adjoining bedroom. Potter froze at the door again, admiring the room, but quickly focused back on Draco. They kissed again, a long and deep kiss, and Draco moaned again. Both their hands were on the other's body, caressing every inch of skin, pulling hair, groping ass cheeks and thighs. Then, they started to undress quickly, every piece of clothes ending on the bedroom's wooden floor. When they stood there, naked in front of one another, Draco frowned.
“I’m going to change his diaper.” He said quickly and left to the nearest toilets, the baby’s changing bag under his arm.
"What? There’s still someone?" As he wasn’t answering, Draco took a book on the desk and threw it at the laughing man. "Potter! Answer me! Did someone hear us fuck? I’ll kill you! I swear I will!"
"Yeah, I know." Draco chuckled and Potter kissed is reddened lips.
At the end of July, the last day of it, actually, Draco was having a drink with Pansy at a bar on Diagon Alley. The place was new, young and trendy and the two friends quickly made it their favourite place to hang out. So, on a hot Saturday night, they were very likely to be here.
"So what? Is that for... appearances? Did you marry her just for show?"
“Do you really want to go to this hotel? Or do you want to stay here with your mother?”
"Of course, you are. That gives him more chances to be smart too." They both chuckled. Draco laid his hand on her huge belly and kissed it, getting all excited when a bump followed his hand. "He’s awake!"
“Yeah. Take him to the nursery and dress him. I’m afraid he’ll catch a cold. He looks so fragile.”
Draco laughed and they parted on top of the stairs.
"You’re okay?" His voice was tense, controlled.
"I won’t, Tory. I have you. We have each other, right?"
Harry frowned. “Huh?”
“Very good, Draco. Oh! Give me my grandson. How cute are you, my baby!”
"Sorry, baby, but I’m not hungry with pasta right now."
“Did you go see Astoria today?” Her father asked.
"No. It’s been ready for weeks. Okay, Sweetheart. Can you stand up?" Astoria whimpered. "We just have to walk to the fireplace. That’s all. Just a few steps, come on."
"Get off me!"
wondering if you two were... together or something.”
“No, I don't.”
“You mean Mr Potter? He said he had to make a Floo call.”
"You're gay, Malfoy." Draco was about to tell him he was rambling, but the look on Potter's face stopped him. Despair. How… "You're gay and I didn't know. If I did… When I heard you were married, I thought I could never… but you've been gay the whole time, and I could have…"
"Your father was a git."
“Yes. We’ll pass by after going to St Mungo’s.” He leaned forward and kissed her forehead. “Sleep tight, Mommy. I’ll take care of our little one.”
An hour later, the three of them were in the plane, thirty thousand feet in the sky. Harry was seating by the window and Draco was next to him, Scorpius on his lap. Take off had been a bit stressing for the dark-haired man, but once they reach the cruising speed, he relaxed a bit. The weather was clear and they could see everything below. The Manche Sea at first, and now the land. It had snowed over France and even that high they could see it. Scorpius was strangely very calm, not at all needing the soothing Potion Draco brewed for him.
"What? No! I’m staying."
Draco moaned as he jumped on him and undressed him quickly, before settling between his legs and engulfing his cock right away. Potter sucked him hard and fast, making him see stars and frustrating him by stopping at the last moment. He did that a while and, when Draco couldn’t hold it anymore, he turned him around on all-four and fucked him by behind. Moans and screams filed the room for hours, as well as the sounds of his hips slapping against Draco’s ass and of the bed slapping against the wall. They were wild and without any restraints that night, careless and driven by lust.
Draco rolled his eyes but smiled. He
"Because that’s Harry Potter. I know you love..."
"Ah! Draco, I really feel like pushing!"
Draco moaned loudly when Harry took him in his mouth. He was beyond frustrated since weeks and needed the man so bad. Having him between his legs now, sucking at his cock felt wonderful. And his words, his husky voice against his burning skin... It was driving him crazy. He could feel his tongue licking every inch, his lips closing at the base of his cock, and the sides of his mouth squeezing it. It was wet and warm, and Draco was so sensitive already.
"I won’t."
“Huh?”
"Pure-Blood Laws, Potter. A child born out of wedlock can't be the rightful heir. It’s as simple as that."
“Poppy didn’t want to wake the young master. Poppy and the other House Elves are very happy for the birth of young master Scorpius, Sir. And relieved that the Mistress is okay.”
"In the bedroom. As always." She was laughing when he got into the bedroom.
A minute later, they were in the bed, naked, Draco in Potter’s arms, his nose hidden in the tanned neck. As he was nearly falling asleep, Draco heard the younger man mumble something in his hair.
“Fine.”
“Always.”
the baby. But if you don’t try, you’ll have regrets all your life, wondering what could have happened. Trust me, Draco, you don’t want that."
"So, no more Aaron?"
“If they die? What will I do? They’re everything I have.”
"You don’t know that, Darling. You’re not even together and you're already thinking about the end? Plus, even if Potter leaves, which I don’t think he will, the baby won’t remember him. You’re just afraid to suffer. Not the baby,
The young man nodded and helped his wife open her sleeping gown and settle the baby on her left breast. He then watched in awe as Scorpius frown slightly and instinctively found the nipple and sucked at it. The view was fascinating. To see his wife feed their son for the first time, when a few minutes ago he thought she wouldn’t make it. He should be jealous of this link he would never have with the baby, but he was simply amazed and happy. Utterly and truly happy.
“Stop torturing yourself, Potter. Nothing will happen. But if you’re not... comfortable with it, I won't force you.”
Tears finally ran down his cheeks, unable to hold them anymore. He needed Astoria to survive. He knew he would be able to take care of him on his own, just like Harry said. But he didn’t want to. It wasn’t the plan. He wanted his wife to see her son too, to see his beautiful blue eyes and the soft blond hair on his head. He wanted her to see how perfect he was in his arms and to call him by his name while looking at him for the first time. He wanted all those plans they made to happen. The party they wanted to do for the presentation of their son, the trip to France to introduce him to his mother, then his first birthday and all the firsts there could be.
Because Harry stayed.
After a last lick and a playful slap on his butt cheeks, Draco felt the lubricated tip brush at his entry. He tried to relax as Potter slowly pushed inside him, inch by inch. Damn, he was big! The young man gripped the sheets and grunted in discomfort, making Potter freeze.
"Good."
"Really? You told me to wait for you, that you'll be right back and, thirty minutes later, you're still eating your boyfriend's face? Boyfriend you were supposed to be dumping, by the way."
"Congratulation for your baby, Potter."
"I want you, Malfoy. I always did. I know I was  a dick to you for all those years, but I didn't know what to do, how to act with you, with all those feelings." Draco's eyes widened. Feelings? "You said I had a type, earlier. And you're right, I do.
"All right, sir." The guy chuckled and kissed Potter on the lips before leaving.
“Stop that! Scorpius is sleeping inside. That’s your mother’s only mistake. Choosing a one-bedroom suite.”
"Hey, you’re back! Sorry, I needed to use the loo."
"He is." Potter said and started to kiss his neck, earning himself a moan.
"No. I go there from time to time, just to make sure everything's in place. But I can't make myself sell it. Once again, too many memories."
"Until the birth of an heir, we can’t be... romantically involved with someone else. Like, as a couple."
"We shouldn’t have. This vow... You’re not happy, Dray. I can see it."
"Come with me? I’ll cook something and you can go home after."
“He is so cute.” Whispered Harry who was seating next to him and looking at the baby too. “And Scorpius is a beautiful name.”
He screamed when he felt a tongue entering him slightly, joined a minute later by a lubricated finger. That felt amazing! Draco pushed his hips back onto Potter's face and finger, craving for more, then sighed in contentment and moaned when the man added another finger. But when he started to add a third one, Draco whimpered.
Draco remained silent for a while. He knew she was right. She always was. But that didn’t made things easier.
“True.” Draco stood up and extended his hand. “Come with me.”
“Is it...”
Draco smiled and gave his son to Harry, then went to get ready in the bathroom. After a long shower he came back into the bedroom, then to the walk-in closet. As he was searching for his tuxedo with only a towel around his waist, he heard Harry gasp.
“It makes you horny? Really?”
"Dray, Darling? Is that you?" A woman's voice asked when both men walked through the front door.
The said man burst out laughing and went back in Draco’s bedroom to finish dressing up. Tonight was Scorpius’ birth party. The party he and Astoria planned months ago. He wanted to cancel it, wait for her to get better and be there with him, but she told him not to, that he had to have fun, to breathe a little bit, see other people. And, even if it didn’t seem right to do it without her, he accepted. And it was natural for her to tell Harry to stay to. After a month of being here night and day, he had every right to be at Scorpius’ party. For her, he was already a part of the family, even if she didn’t say it to the dark-haired man. She knew Draco’s feeling for him even better than Draco himself, and she knew he had to stay.
“So, this is our home?”
“Yes. And look how beautiful he is. He has your eyes.”
“Good. In the meantime, I advise you to go to St Mungo’s with your son. He’s fine, but I would like for a paediatrician to check on him. He’s premature, after all. Who did you choose?
"I know. But... I don’t think I’ll see him again. Even after the birth."
"Congrats, for your daughter’s birth."
was happening. Were they a couple? Friends with benefits? Something else? He wasn’t sure he wanted to know the answer to that question. Despite what he said before, maybe Potter changed his mind and just didn’t know how to tell him he wanted to leave.
Draco walked to the bedroom door, his son still asleep in his arms and entered quietly. The curtains were open to allow the rising sun to come in the room. There, on the bed, Astoria was lying under the white spotless sheets. For a second, Draco thought he should thank the nurse for changing them. He could not deal with more blood today. He focused his attention on his wife’s face and smiled when he saw her eyes opened wide, looking at the sheets in his arms.
"Don’t. I
"I'm big, Malfoy. You'll need the third one."
“Yes, a bit. But I’m sure it will pass very quickly.”
"I know, but I thought this one was different."
The morning after, the sunlight woke the young men up, shining brightly through the large window. They both grunted, but after a few touches that led to heated kisses, they were more than awake. They quickly fucked again, Potter making Draco scream his name in ecstasy, and ended up in the shower, kissing and washing each other.
“Draco doesn’t need to be saved, Mrs Malfoy.” Mother and son looked at the former Gryffindor who sat back next to his lover. “And I’m not a hero. I’m actually quite selfish. But I love your son and I would never hurt him or Scorpius voluntarily.”
"I… can't, Potter."
"Nothing as deadly, but not far. I could lose a lot, Potter, but mostly, I could lose my son, if I was to break this vow."
"Yes and no. Nothing… dangerous. She's just very tired and weak all the time. The Mediwizard told her to keep in bed as much as possible."
Then, he offered his arm to the man and, a second later, they both disappeared with a 'Crack' sound.
"It also means 'if you want to fuck, do it'. I'm a big girl, you know. I can stay on my own while you flirt with Potter. Maybe that way I'll be able to flirt too."
The third time was again two more years later, but this time it wasn't in the Ministry.
Harry looked at a sleeping Scorpius in his stroller in the bedroom and came to sit beside his boyfriend. “The view’s beautiful.”
"I'm not, he's…"
Harry and Narcissa looked at each other for a moment, a certain comprehension passing between them. Then, the woman smiled and called for her House Elf to bring the drinks and toasts.

Draco watched the man disappear and looked back at the tearing woman on the floor.
“I love you too, Harry. I can’t believe you’re here with me and... I don’t know what we were for each other before, but I want you to be my boyfriend. If you want it too.”
"Did you eat already?"
******
She widened her eyes. “That is what my father used to say. Thank you, Mr Potter. I really appreciate your gift.” Draco took Harry’s hand in his discreetly and squeezed it. The man didn’t tell him about this gift, only that he had an idea about what to offer to his mother. Narcissa reached into the Christmas tree and took a white envelope. “Here. It’s for both of you.”
Draco shrugged, but smiled. "I had the time to do it. And the money. So, I guess it's not that much of a deal."
The moves kept going slowly for a while, until Draco started to moan louder, the pleasure finally taking over the pain. Then, Potter started to thrust deeper and faster, making the former Slytherin moan even louder, until he was moving in and out mercilessly, clasping his hips against Draco’s ass. It felt so good Draco couldn’t even think or speak properly. There was no way he could last long with Potter’s cock brushing against his prostate with every thrust and moaning in his ear again and again.
"She’s not. Pansy’s a bitch."
"Four? But you’ve been married for three years, right?"
green eyes.
At that moment, Draco thought the look on her face was odd, but the feeling was quickly brushed away when a tray with a tea-pot and two cups and biscuits on it appeared on the coffee table in front of them and Astoria almost jump on it.
"Fuck! Where’s this doctor!"
So, when the meeting ended, Draco quickly left the room, not staying to talk to the other board members like he usually did. He almost ran to the elevators and sighed when one of them opened immediately. But, of course, unlucky as he was, Potter entered it right before the doors closed.
Draco wasn’t sure, but he thought he heard the man’s voice crack a little. Maybe it's what made him follow him.
Draco chuckled. “I know. You are too. I love how you go so deep in me and fill me. I feel... complete.”
"Hey babe! What are you doing? I miss you, over there!"
The other man looked at him and grinned. "Yeah, right. Good thing."
"Where?"
He closed his eyes. He couldn’t do that. He just couldn’t. "Don’t say another word. You know I can’t, Potter."
baby, it's better than not having any."
are my type."
The green eyes that looked at him then were brighter than ever. “Really, Malfoy? Do you really think Slytherins are immune to my charm?”
Just like his, Astoria’s chambers had three rooms. A reception room, a bedroom and a bathroom. The place was as clear as Draco’s, but with discreet tones of red and gold about everywhere. Draco thought it looked awfully like a Gryffindor’s den, but she always laughed and said she just loved the colours and the warm feeling it gave to the place.
“But what if they don’t? If... if Tory dies, what will I do with the baby? I...”
"Didn’t?"
“You? Harry Potter? The great saviour of our world is scared of a plane? You know it flies, right? Aren’t you one of the best flyers ever?”
Draco chuckled. “You’re an idiot. And you’ll always be
"Thanks."
“Oh! Right!”
Suddenly, the worries Draco had earlier that night came back to his mind. “Did they? For you, I mean.”
“I love to hear that. You’re my boyfriend, now. Mine. That’s official. Right?”
"Good. Make yourself comfortable, it could take a while."
"Wha-"
"Yeah."
Merlin, how he hated giggling pretty boys. Or just this one. Maybe.
"No. You’re a jerk, remember?" A laugh answered him. "I should go, it’s getting late."
“Sir? Your wife is awake, but probably not for long. If you want to show the baby to her, now is probably a good time.”
“Yes, he is.”
“Really? I can’t wait to meet romantic Draco. Where is he?”
“It could. Sex with you is
"You’re sure? I can wait longer if you need a moment to adjust."
Draco glared at his friend, turned his head towards the newcomer and nodded. "Potter."
“Okay, I’m ready. Your turn, now.”
Potter froze. "Next time? You're planning to have other kids? With Astoria?"
“She’s still fighting. Dr Gobler is doing his best to save her. Excuse me Sir, I really have to go back.”
She was nice, distinguished and fun and they soon became something like best friends. Although, a year after the wedding, still no baby in sight, and she was suffering for that. And he was suffering to see her suffer. They were trying, though. Maybe not hard enough, that's true, but they were. In the meantime, he was going from man to man, enjoying himself for no more than one night. Never more. It was in the contract. Until a baby was born, they had to stick together. After the birth they would both be free but, until then, neither of them could fall in love. He just couldn't.
When he opened the door, Potter was not in the seating area. For a second, he thought he was serious about waiting for him naked in his bed, but it was empty too. Just as he was about to go out again and search the corridors, the bathroom’s door opened, revealing a smiling fully-clothed Saviour.
and not Mrs Potter.
"Yes and no." He said again. "Even if I know the House Elves are here, I don’t like to leave her alone for too long. But it’s also what we agreed on when we married. If it’s not planned a week prior, no night out. We can bring someone back, but..."
So did Potter and all his friends, apparently. He spotted the young man the minute they arrived, of course. Always did.
They both walked to the fireplace and stood before it, awkwardly. Then, Potter grabbed Draco’s arm and pulled him in a kiss. When they parted a few minutes later, foreheads against one another, they sighed in contentment. It was weird. Draco felt both happy and sad. He hoped this night was just the beginning of something, but also feared that it was the only time they could be together like that. And this last thought was devastating.
“Does it bother you? For me to stay here.”
“So, if you fall in love, you lose your son? That’s... sorry, but I really think that’s stupid! You seriously never dated anyone in four years? No dinner at a fancy restaurant? No flowers? No romantic holidays?"
For long minutes, moans, pants and skin against skin were the only sounds in the bedroom. The two men were lost in their pleasure, kissing and licking at every inch of skin, groping asses and thighs, linking their hands together, murmuring sweet nothings to each other. Harry sucked at the pale neck, bit and licked the soft skin, drawing a pretty mark on it.
“Not yet. Go back to sleep.”
"I am. You’re carrying our son and..."
“Who is hot as fuck?” Marco asked and gave Pansy a drink, making them all burst out laughing.
“Calm down, Darling. We have to give her all the time she needs. If we rush things, it can be worse.”
"Draco, I..."
Her voice was weak, raw with emotions and exhaustion. Draco lifted the baby and carefully put him in Astoria’s arms, still holding a bit to ease the weight.
“And you, you’re jealous.”
"Well, we'll be going, now." He heard a discreet relieved sigh next to him and grinned. "I'll be in my chambers if you need me, Tory."
“I won’t, Draco. You can-”
"It’s not. We talked about my birthday."
Harry moved closer and smiled at the baby. “It’s not that. I’m more than happy to be here, as I’ve been for the last month. I just don’t want to make it weird or uncomfortable for you. People don’t really expect to see me here tonight.”
"Why do you always ask? I’m not moving all day, except for peeing."
"Okay. So, Pandora?"
“When? Tomorrow?”
“He went to take drinks at the bar.”
"I did wait, Potter. For thirty minutes. But when I realised you were busy with Blondie… Kyle, I left. I have better things to do than wait for you to stop playing around, Potter."
Draco was married to Astoria Greengrass for a year then, but wasn't in love with her. Just as she wasn't in love with him. She knew he was gay. Of course, she knew. You can't hide that kind of thing from your wife. But the marriage was his father's last wish and his mother's only. So, he had complied and made things clear with Astoria. He would give her his name, his wealth and freedom in exchange of her discretion and an heir. She had agreed.
Draco’s eyes opened, blinking slowly, hazy with lust and slightly bewildered.
” Draco said with a smile, and despite his panic at almost being caught out Harry couldn't stop his heart from melting a little bit, so pleased that Draco was enjoying himself as much as Harry knew he would. “Are you quite alright?” He asked, cupping Harry’s cheek, brows furrowed slightly with concern.
,” Pansy groaned, prizing their faces apart with her hands, “but can you please stop devouring each other before I get so insanely turned on I join you or, Heaven forbid, start shagging Blaise?”
Harry heard Draco turn the shower on and considered jumping in with him, deciding against it when he realised they were, in fact, already running late. He wasn’t prepared to face Draco’s wrath, especially when he was in such a good mood.
“Never what?”
“That’s it, it’s ok- I’ve got you, my love, you can let go."
Ron smiled, tapping his water bottle against Harry's in a toast.
getting naked in front of a bunch of strangers without me there! Did you know about this?” He asked, looking at Ginny, who grinned.
for you."
“Here, put your hands here,” he mumbled against Draco’s nape, manoeuvring his arms until both hands were planted on either side of the sink, before sliding his own back down Draco’s sides so they rested on his arse. Prising his cheeks apart, his mouth began to water, wanting nothing more than to fall to his knees and bury his tongue between them, but knowing they had no time.
“I do, I promise, God, of course I promise. I can’t live without you, not again, not ever- fuck, Draco, it was so hard, I didn’t think it was possible to miss someone so much, to wake up and fall asleep every day aching with it and—”
sinking his teeth into the willowy curve of his neck. The bitter tang of sweat- and underneath, something sweeter, something he recognised- burst across his tongue as he sucked on the soft skin, biting and soothing until Draco began to shift underneath him, moaning softly, head lolling to one side, hips rolling lazily against the thigh Harry had shoved between his legs.
Draco snorted, smacking Harry lightly on the chest. “Don’t be cruel, they think it’s sweet.”
“Those Muggles...they’re eating
“Because I’ve been with you!”
Harry frowned up at him, toying with the drawstring on the joggers he’d stolen from Harry’s drawer. “Is it all the Muggles?” He asked, slipping a hand under Draco’s t-shirt to curl around his waist, “because you know I’ll keep you safe, you know I wouldn’t let anything happen to you.”
“Fuck off,” he retorted just as Draco looked over, smile widening as he spotted Harry watching him.
, so I’m doing marvellously, thank you.”
Harry would have questioned it further if he wasn’t on the verge of coming in his trousers, and he just didn’t have the energy for both.
, yes, of course…Merlin, how silly of me.”
“I told you, I’m fine, Ron.”
“Entertainment?
Harry grinned, looking over at Draco. He and Luna seemed to be shouting at Seamus and Dean, who were stumbling over each other's feet in what Harry assumed to be a dance.
. People really enjoy this? It makes me fear for the world, Harry, it really does.”
“Yes, ok.
A heartbeat, two, and then something unspoken passed between them. Harry stumbled forward into Draco’s arms, which held him tight as a single tear rolled down his cheek, more threatening to overspill, everything he’d refused to feel for the last few months crashing down on him like a ton of bricks.
his answer was, and Harry almost couldn't blame him. It really was breathtaking, the alexandrite's effect subtle- which strangely made it feel all the more special- yet beautiful, and Harry snapped the lid shut before he started sobbing like a fool over the damn thing.
“What the fuck was that?”
“I’m not worried,” Draco said softly, brushing glitter from Harry’s shoulder, “just trying to work out Ronald’s big secret. He looks like he’s about to explode.”
Draco smacked his chest lightly, not even raising his head. “No, Potter, there is no spell. As if I’d need magic to get you to fuck me- I knew the leather would do it.”
Harry had quickly learnt from his short, twenty-six years on Earth that life is
“S’pose not…I can’t believe you got him to wear them, I thought you were a dead man.”
,’ he shouted, making Draco jump slightly, pushing his hair back from his face and gesturing wildly, “because otherwise this doesn’t make sense. I was fine, Draco, I
It was Harry’s turn to throw a bottle of juice at him, scoffing when he caught it without even looking.
He found Draco in the kitchen, painting his nails at the table with a delicate precision that made Harry’s heart melt, damp hair gleaming in the morning sunlight.
happy, and that was the problem, “those two are wearing less than I am, so people won’t even be looking at me.” He nodded at Pansy and Blaise, who were dripping in glitter and very little else, and Harry scowled. “Stop being so ridiculous. If you didn’t want me going
“Holy
“Not a
Still, it wasn’t enough, and Harry’s hands felt empty, aching, the need to touch every part of Draco, to grab and pull and rub almost maddening. Without preamble, he shoved them both under the tight waistband of Draco’s trousers, filling his palms with the taut muscle of Draco’s arse and squeezing roughly, massaging his cheeks in broad circles as he began to nose his way down Draco’s chest, exposed by his open shirt, revelling in the feel of him as if this wasn’t a man he’d fucked a thousand times before. It felt different, somehow,
“I’m so happy you said yes,” he laughed against Draco’s lips a minute later and Draco half-laughed, half-sobbed, shaking his head.
"Thanks, Hermione," Harry laughed, "but please stop crying before you set me off again."

you,” Draco chuckled, walking over and running his free hand though Harry’s hair. He blew his tea before taking a sip, scratching Harry’s scalp lightly. “You’re with me because out of all the different options, I came out on top. Or, well...anyway, my
That was a lie, as he’d clocked Draco the minute he’d stepped through the fireplace, although it wasn’t as though he could help it- Draco had spelled his distinctive blonde hair a dazzlingly bright white, which shone almost luminescent in the low light- a
Set underneath the diamonds, the two colours shone through depending on how the ring was angled, something the jeweller had told him was 'ingenious'.
“Fucking add another one, don’t prat around, Potter”, Draco hissed, back dipping, so Harry pulled his finger out before working two in, twisting them down until he could feel the throbbing nub of Draco’s prostate. He rubbed the tips of his fingers over it roughly, cock straining at the low groan Draco let out, his head dropping forward so that it hung between his shoulders, exposing the back of his neck where a dark flush was creeping.
“May I ask
he is,” he added with a derisive chuckle when Ron pulled a face that suggested he’d thought about checking the bathroom too.
“The shorts are good, yeah, but...you’re right, I suppose. Fuck, I love him, more than I thought possible. He...what we have...it just clicks, you know? I’ve never felt that before, not with anyone else, not even with Gin.”
Maybe he wasn’t as ‘ok’ as he’d claimed to be.
“Merlin, I hate that,” he groaned, head dropping onto Harry’s shoulder.
Harry had half a mind to check he hadn’t fled out of the bathroom window, or worse, apparated to safety up in Wiltshire.
It was ironic, really, that the pointy blonde git who’s friendship he’d refused nearly two decades earlier, who he’d nearly killed in a bathroom, who had been such an annoying little
“You want me to wear these?”
He wouldn’t put it past him.
“No buts! I don’t know why you bother asking, I’ve said no every year, and every year you’ve been perfectly fine without me. You don’t need me to come.”
“- Just do the fucking spell, Harry.”
“Fine,” Draco huffed, looking way too put out for someone who’d just had a mindblowing orgasm, “if you won’t give it to me now, we should get out of bed. I refuse to be late to your little event.”
Harry laughed loudly, shaking his head as Draco grinned.
“No, I knew I wouldn’t need to,” Draco smirked, eyes trained on Harry’s crotch before sliding up his chest, “but I’m pretty sure I left a t-shirt out for you too.”
“Oh, save it,” Harry snarled, pulling his fingers out to a whimper from Draco, unbuttoning his trousers and hissing with relief as his cock finally sprung free. He eased down the foreskin, conjuring more lube and giving himself a quick stroke, before gripping the base to keep his impending orgasm at bay. The damn spell had him hornier than a teenager, ready to burst after a single touch- he hadn’t felt this desperate for years, and he took hold of his cock in a trembling hand, rubbing the head over Draco’s quivering hole, smearing pre-come between his cheeks.
