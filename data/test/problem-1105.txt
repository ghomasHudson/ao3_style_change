Sighing he continued on. “Once we have him here I will have Severus bring a De-Aging potion as well as get his assistance in removing Harry’s memories permanently.”
“Draco there is something very important we need to discuss.” Lucius said gently.
It was a normal day for Harry. Which meant it was not a good day. He had been late getting breakfast ready. Which meant the Dursleys had not had breakfast been able to eat as soon as they had come down to the dining room. That of course led to his Uncle Vernon deciding that Harry needed to be punished for trying to starve them. The only fitting punishment for that was being spanked twenty times with the hot frying pan that he had just used to make bacon. After all it wasn’t a proper punishment if Harry didn’t get grease burns as well. Once his Uncle was satisfied with his received punishment he order Harry to clean the entire house spotless and then weed the garden. Sighing Harry went off to get it done knowing he wouldn’t be able to look after his injuries or rest until he had finished.
Mr. Malfoy turned to him. “Alright Harry you are doing a great job but I just need you to do two more things and then you will be all set to rest. Sound good? He asked. Harry nodded his head in response. The taller man with dark hair walked over Mr. Malfoy and handed him the green vile. “ This vial, Lucius, is the De-Aging potion he needs to take that one first. The second one” He said as he handed over the smoky white vial “ is to permanently remove his memories. It will cause him to remain unconscious for several days since it will take time for his mind to process through everything. Also make sure you or Narcissa is there when he wakes up.” He finished explaining before exiting the room. “Thank you Severus. I will make sure me or Narcissa is there.” He responded. Then he held out the green villa for Harry to take. It smelled like rotten eggs. Hesitating a moment to mentally prep himself Harry grabbed the vial and poured it in his mouth. He shuddered it tasted like rotten eggs and coffee. It was horrid.  A minute later he swore he could feel himself shrinking that or everything else was getting bigger. Either way it was very disorienting. “Good job Harry. I just need you to drinking this one last vial and then you can rest.” Mr. Malfoy said handing him the white vial. It had a nicer Chamomile scent to it so it wasn’t to hard for him to drink it. It actually had a soothing flavor to it. Chamomile and cream. It made Harry and of sleepy and hazy. He felt his legs start to get heavy and his eyes began to droop. The last thing he remembered was Mr. Mafoy catching him and then his world went black.
“Yes, I remember.”
“Granger—”
“How beautifully your wand still responds to me.”
"Yeah."
“But—” Harry’s brain was working furiously now. “Why didn’t you practise after seventh year? You spent all that time in New York with a wizarding family!”
Ron gave him another look.
They had just dueled twice. Playful duels with rather ridiculous hexes, but that was enough to test the wands.
To his credit, Weasley offered them privacy. But Draco shrugged that off—with him present, the conversation was less likely to drift into any awkward territory about life debts. You could never tell whether McGonagall was going to come down on the traditional or progressive side of an issue, and Draco didn’t fancy another Granger-esque lecture.
“Listen, Draco,” someone was saying.
“So why don’t you and Mum give the ferret a chance? He’s a different person now. All of us are.”
“He made pretty good use of the London system,” Ron continued.
“It has to do with the life debt and . . . boundaries.”
“No, I mean . . . will you give him a chance?”
“Would you let me make my confession before you burst into I-told-you-so?
Draco laughed too, but the rest of his response was cut off by some sort of interruption. Ron's voice, from the sound of it.
Draco snorted. "The engagement that hasn't happened yet?"
Draco inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his diaphragm so he could focus on finding the words he needed. “One of my chief sins, Harry, is jealousy. Or coveting, perhaps. Or both, I suppose. I always, you know, coveted your power, your skill as a seeker, the friendships you formed, the attention you attracted . . . and your courage. God, I wanted your courage. I made myself sick with envy sometimes. Literally sick to the point of vomiting.”
“Are you sure that’s a good idea?” Her voice was somehow gentle and pointed at the same time. “Hagrid isn’t always best at keeping secrets.”
“It would.”
Draco leaned back against the door with a nonchalant shrug, as if he had chosen to be pinned there. “I told you to go back to sleep.”
He looked astonished. "All right? You're giving in?"
"That was the first time he pulled me out of a fire, Mother," Draco cut in. He didn't like to interrupt her, but this couldn't wait. "Yesterday night was the second."
But Ron was already gone.
A quite knowledgeable partner, judging by the gentle yet intense pressure of Draco's hands. Harry really did relax, at least a bit, trying to put the whole situation with Robards out of his mind. But just that stray thought caused him to tense up all over again.
Right now, he had to prepare himself to deal with Narcissa.
Harry stretched out on his bed, satiated and almost giddily happy. Draco was next to him—curled up, relaxed, and calm—with that white-blond hair of his messier than Harry had ever seen it. That was possibly because Harry had grabbed hold of it, tight, while Draco was blowing him.
Granger sighed, presumably because she worried for Harry and Ron too. Draco twisted himself toward her and nestled against her tee shirt, perilously near her chest.
Weasley nodded, looking relieved. “Sounds like a good idea, doesn’t it Harry?”
"But—"
Draco sighed, utterly content, and pulled Harry even closer. “Salazar, I needed that blow job.”
Shit. That was fair. Harry wasn’t a therapist. Was that what Draco needed?
"Yeah." His voice was uncertain, as if he didn't know whether to be proud, repentant, or both.
Narcissa stared at the boy as he continued to ramble. She hadn’t realised how much he despised living in the full glare of publicity. Small wonder, though. She remembered how the Prophet had painted him as a deluded attention-seeker for insisting that the Dark Lord had returned, only to turn about and hail him as the chosen one when the truth could no longer be ignored.
“We both stink of petrol and smoke.” Malfoy paused for a racking cough. “My ears are ringing from that damned explosion too. And as for your back—well, you should have apparated us onto a bed instead of a sitting room floor.”
But then he turned to her and grinned. “I know. But there’s a part of me that still resents coming in second to your marks.”
"Kindly lower your expectations, Potter. Do you want to hear my idea or not?"
Ron grinned. “We’re plenty reliable. And yeah, we’ll keep an eye on you, Ferret.”
It was so easy to let the ferret side of his brain take over. He almost never had nightmares as a ferret, and when he did they were more easily dismissed or even forgotten.
She reminded Harry weirdly of Umbridge. Not in temperment; this woman didn't seem fake or cruel. And though her build was different, she definitely had Umbridge's face. But it was much less toad-like on this lady.
"Shit timing on the Ministry’s part." He paused to stroke the head of Shacklebolt’s great-horned owl. "I'll be stuck there for a week. Draco, is there any chance you can come with me?”
Harry just nodded as the queue moved up again.
Harry released him, sat up, and tried for a teasing grin. "We weren't speaking of birthdays. We were speaking of you behaving."
“I have to go. I’ll ring you later.”
"It's not that," Ron said.
He sounded oddly like Harry, in so far as he seemed to think he had a right to the answer. Draco couldn’t decide if that fact annoyed him or not.
George seemed to find that hilarious. He kept laughing and laughing, sliding down against the wall until he was sitting on the floor, almost hyperventilating.
“Look, I was never the brains of the Golden Trio.”
Harry collapsed back down, attempting to deepen his breaths and relax for real. "It wasn't disastrous. You're better than me and Hermione never has time to study the game, so she won’t play. Ron was thrilled."
"Bill, George, I'm grateful for the opportunity to meet you both properly. Especially after, well, after everything my family and I have done . . . ."
Harry sighed. “No. He's not wrong. And he knows he's not really in a position to criticise the man. I'm more upset by the things he's said about Hagrid.”
Malfoy scoffed. “Later. When I'm actually conscious—and this ferret thing has gotten old for you.”
Either way, Harry changed into a tee shirt and joggers and slid into bed. He reached out to stroke Draco, but got an angry hiss, complete with an arched back and bristling fur, in return. Shit, he was awake. And definitely not speaking to him.
“Good.” Harry smirked back. “I want you to learn how to summon a patronus. And how to apparate.”
“Yes, under certain circumstances.” He paused. “Unlike you, I'm not a saint.”
Draco nodded with mock-solemnity. “Yes, Harry. I spilled all our secrets.”
“A child by such means would be a bastard, at best!”
“The wand didn't feel right to you anymore. Not then.” Harry's voice was thoughtful now. “It was mine by right of conquest. That's how Olivander explained it.”
The house elf sniffed. “Toffee be not ready for serving the likes of Mrs. Granger-Weasley.”
Malfoy shrugged. “I had time to rehearse most of it in my head. Wasn’t hard to see his reaction coming.”
Potter stood up. “Did Robards force you to become one?”
That’s when Ron heard the knock at the bedroom door. Having no reason to suspect that anyone other than Kreacher was in the house, he had shouted an order to come in.
Harry shifted away from Draco and then pushed himself out of bed.
How did that beetle’s voice carry over the rest of the throng? And how did she manage to push herself up front like that? Ron almost snarled at her perfectly coiffed hair, her gleaming gold teeth and that damned quill of hers, which looked ready to scribble away.
"I think they take a pinprick of blood from circumcised converts." Shira bit her lip. "Maybe you can find a Reform rabbi who won't ask for any of that."
The man finally smiled and seemed to relax, at least a bit. “I do know that. It didn’t look ‘untoward’—but I didn’t realise you two were so attached to Draco Malfoy. And, Ron, I didn’t expect to hear you issuing him orders as if he were a house elf.”
“Right, you just go on Draco.” Harry shook his head at his pet/sex-slave. “Remember you'll be answering to me later.”
So Potter blithely expected him to obey orders. But Draco had no desire to be interrogated by the Golden Trio, especially since he answered—in theory, at least—only to Robards or to the Minister for Magic himself.
"No, she doesn't. But she's right about this." Harry paused again. "This is final, Draco. And while we're at it, you need to accept when I decide that you don't need any punishment. I don't care that you got angry and threw your phone. If you start breaking things regularly, it might be a different story. But until then—"
Was he joking? "Have you looked at me? Or in a mirror? We each need a shower and change of clothes. And though I doubt you have anything I would deign to wear—"
Of course, Draco had been canny enough, back at Hogwarts, to guess that Harry was unhappy with the Dursleys. His arrows had certainly struck home when he mocked Harry for spending Christmas at Hogwarts, correctly assuming that Harry was unwanted by his family.
Fuck, that went straight to Harry’s dick, so he elbowed Draco as punishment. “Get your head out of the gutter!”
Potter's face turned bright red. "I want to stop you from making an enormous mistake."
“I’m not sure, Toffee. Maybe we’ll, um—”
, Shira insisted.
George looked amused. "Never mind all that. We'll see you on Tuesday. And I expect you to come 'round the shop soon and explain why I should accept muggle money."
Very well, directly against her chest. Her sigh turned into a reluctant giggle as Draco decided that female breasts could be quite comfortable.
He tried to figure out if he was bitter about that, if he resented Harry for putting him so far in his debt. Fuck, he ought to have enough pride to be bitter. But at the moment, Draco just felt relief.
But Hagrid didn’t move. Draco couldn’t tell if he was hesitant or implacable, but he knew it didn’t matter.
“I promise.” He pushed himself up to a standing position. “Are you finally ready to see those memories of Dobby?”
"Look, Potter—"
"Yeah? Well, you're not wrong." He leaned forward and pressed his lips to Draco's chest. Just for a moment, though, and then he drew back. "I'm glad I didn't scar you. I don't want to hurt you. Maybe I did back then, but not like that. I had no idea what that spell would do."
“I know, but—” She broke off to chew on her lip. “I’m not saying you shouldn’t try to teach him to cast one; of course you should. But I wonder if he has a memory of pure happiness to draw upon.”
Harry squeezed his hands. Presumably it was meant as a gesture of comfort.
“You’re learning just fine.”
“As powerful and undisciplined as you are in every other branch of magic?”
“Yes. I don’t despise Robards’ methods as much as you do; some of his ruthlessness is necessary. But only some. Overall, your ethics will be preferable. Besides, you would be out of the line of fire.”
But Jamie waved that objection aside. “Your brothers will look after them. Harry, where should we stay to be conveniently close to your place? I don't like hostels, so a real hotel would be best. A no-maj one—I mean muggle one—is fine.”
"Understood. And that won't be a problem."
Draco didn’t say anything to that. He looked frustrated now, as if there were no way he could get Harry to understand.
That brought the holy-fucking-saviour up short. “No.” Harry shook his head vigorously. “But I—Draco, I just want to keep you safe.”
"Tell me something." Draco carded his fingers through Potter's hair. "Are you new to this because I'm another man, or are you just new to this?"
“Don’t worry.” George held up his right hand. “I solemnly swear not to do him any harm.”
“I’m sure he doesn’t hate you,” Harry said cautiously. “I don’t think he hates anyone—not even your father.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but allowed himself to be tugged. If the idiot scarhead wanted clammy skin against his own, so be it.
“It’s two in the morning,” he pointed out, his voice strained. “What does Shacklebolt want with you now?”
“Yeah, well.” A little red crept into his face as he shrugged and stared at the screen again.
“Because of the life debt.”
“That’s true. Fuck it. I probably won’t break up with you—even if they do offer me a chance to be their third.”
“Yeah, the grand prick himself.” Ron shook his head. “He went on and on about how a Death Eater like Draco Malfoy should never cross the threshold of the Burrow, that he’s directly responsible for what happened to Bill—which, all right, is true—that he as good as killed Dumbledore—”
"Or should be salvaged." Draco arched his eyebrows at Harry. "Not everything the Blacks owned should be fixed."
“Good. So he also has a right to order you to see a therapist or something.”
Harry managed a strangled laugh. “Uh, no, not really. Draco is, um—this is going to take a while to explain.”
"I still think you've both lost your minds." Granger slammed her coffee mug down on the long dining room table with such force that Draco was amazed the oak didn't crack.
Draco was spared the torture of breakfasting with the Golden Trio—and the torture of figuring out what to say to Weasley. Even if he abjectly apologised to the man, he wouldn’t want to hear it. Draco respected that; words carried little weight.
“Granger—” Draco broke off as he shook his head in frustration. Then he finally looked her in the eye. “If Potter ever becomes a proper tyrant, he knows he'll have you to answer to.”
“So we're doing the maths now?”
"Apparently. They did let me share their bed. As a ferret, but still.”
“Ron?” Hermione’s voice floated from the bedroom.
“Keep Percy out of it.”
Draco was staring straight at Benjamin as they stopped, so Harry got a good look at him. He was in his late twenties, probably. A short, stocky man with pale skin, curly dark hair, and a pair of shrewd but kind brown eyes.
What? That made no sense. “No! I wasn’t stalking you. We were in this together.”
Harry's mouth fell open. “Who told the Prophet?”
“Well,” Shira said, “It would make my mother happy. She only has two daughters, and the other one married a no-maj. Muggle, I mean. Not that she doesn’t love Benjamin; she adores him. But she’s determined to see me marry a wizard. But she knows said wizard has to accept Jamie and not be jealous. And my mother doesn’t care about bloodlines, but my father does. So it’s better if said wizard is a pure-blood. Jewish too, of course.”
->*<-
The four of them had spent the morning poring over letters published in the Daily Prophet. Some were outraged that the revered Harry Potter seemed to be supporting a form of slavery. Others were angry that the holy saviour was upholding pure-blood traditions that more progressive wizards were attempting to tear down.
Of course Weasley couldn’t accept that gracefully. No, he made a show of clutching at his heart in shock. “You want advice from a blood-traitor? Won’t your father hear about this?”
Draco slid off of him—halfway, at least. “Have you met my family, Potter? The Malfoys are all about keeping score.”
“Yes.”
Her mouth fell open and her eyes teared up. “Is Master not wanting my services?”
Draco turned his head toward him and nodded. “No. You and your muggle brawling—I still relish the moment when I found out you were all banned.”
Harry tried to stop himself from grinning, but couldn't quite manage it. "Merlin, that would be complete revenge on the man. His only child turned Potter . . . ."
Except that wasn't true. Of course he was still a Malfoy. And some other part of Harry, which was equally twisted and even more possessive, wanted him, in part, because he was one. Because, as a child, he'd been just as the Malfoys brought him up to be: spoiled and bratty and petty. That made his current submission to Harry all the sweeter.
But he didn’t have to obey gracefully, so he huffed out a purposely obnoxious sigh, rolled away from the man, and climbed out of bed. “Fine, Potter,” he said without a backward glance. “Just don’t expect miracles.”
"Oh! Right. Shira and Jamie will be here. That's who they want with us." Harry tried to dial back his astonishment. "Do they know about Jamie? I mean your parents are—um, they won't mind being seen with a squib?"
There was a smile in Draco's voice as he replied. “Not a morning person, I take it. Never mind; I'll give you to half-seven or so. I'll leave your clothes laid out over here—”
“Why are you here, Harry?” Lucius’s voice was tight as he placed a hand on Narcissa’s back. “Surely you didn’t arrive at midnight to tell us that you and our son are in the midst of some childish quarrel.”
Harry closed his eyes. He didn't have another apparation in him tonight. He still couldn't even be arsed to try for some basic healing. So he let himself drift off, hoping for the best.
“Draco, this is George Weasley,” Harry said. “George, this is Draco Malfoy.”
Jamie snorted. “I know. I’m Jamie Yarleque, from an impeccable line of Peruvian wizards. Until you get to me, that is.” She paused to sigh dramatically. “I’m a squib—can’t do a drop of magic. Just thought I’d get that out of the way.”
Harry's tone closed the subject. Or would have done, had Draco respected it.
“Don’t keep calling me that! I swear by all that’s holy, Potter, I’m going to break up with you.”
"Nothing." Harry closed his eyes as Draco rubbed a soothing ointment into his shoulders. "Your hands feel amazing. Keep going, please."
Harry blushed. “Right. Sorry.”
"Yeah, but also in general. You're mine, so I take care of you. That's how this works."
They knew, of course, that Draco had done some services for Robards to help keep his father out of prison. But Draco had led them to believe that he was quietly assisting the aurors with their financial investigations. That he was almost the equivalent of a forensic accountant, and in no greater danger than an average accountant.
Harry didn't push him any further. He just stayed there with him, half wanting just to hold him and half wanting to fuck his brains out.
“Right. Well, er, what about muggle synagogue life? You know about that. And Arthur would probably find that interesting.”
->*<-
“Shame, that. Your shoulder, on the other hand, makes an excellent one.”
“Can pick out . . .” Harry’s groggy brain struggled to complete the sentence, “. . . own clothes.”
“Oh no?” Draco snorted. “He loves having power over me. You think he’s above getting a little revenge?”
George turned scarlet, right to the tip of his remaining ear, but he laughed again as he shoved Draco off of him. “No, but I imagine Harry was thinking exactly that. He just might not have realised it at the time.”
“Yes he is!” God help him, he was surrounded by thick, bull-headed Gryffindors.
Draco rolled his eyes. "This, Harry,"—he made a motion with his hands, but it was obvious he meant the life debt—"isn't just for show."
“So . . .” Harry paused to swallow. “Are you really in love with me, or are you just grateful to me?”
“Thanks for the reminder.” He kissed the top of Draco’s head, still grinning despite himself. “Knowing you’ll be judging my every move won’t add any pressure at all.”
“No. I still don’t understand where, exactly, you keep your bad memories—or why you keep them here.”
Ron entered his flat as quietly as he could, careful not to turn on a light or cast Lumos in case Hermione was already sleeping. It wasn’t his fault that Hermione left a pile of books right where he would trip over them—although, arguably, he was responsible for the weights he managed to stub his toe on.
“I don’t want to sleep with them! Not that Ron isn’t fit, and Granger is—"
“Yes. She’s fine. Still studying to become the American equivalent of a Potions Master.”
"Enough, Draco. This decision has nothing to do with your past, as you're well aware. In fact, I think a hyphenated name for both of us would, well—it would be good. Another way of putting the past behind us."
Her voice was curious, but she didn’t seem particularly invested in the answer. They might have been discussing a recent quidditch match. Harry shook himself, just a bit, wondering if this conversation was really part of his life now.
Harry murmured an agreement as he climbed off of Draco and slid under the covers with him. At least Draco sounded more resigned than annoyed at the thought of seeing Ron and Hermione so soon. That, Harry supposed, was progress.
"Of course not. But you're not kinky, remember?"
“I don’t think it’s going to burn out,” Hermione said quietly.
But Ron cut him off. “Save it. Just don’t disappoint Harry. Or Hermione.”
Ron—it must be all right to think of him as Ron now—leaned back into the corner of the chesterfield. Draco made a concerted effort to climb into his shirt.
Weasley made a retching sound, but Draco retorted with a little bow.
“You hated sixth year.” Harry hesitated and then gentled his voice. “That was—I mean, you were undercover then, in a way. And you hated it. Merlin, you were breaking down.”
For the first time, Harry forced himself to ask why he had fallen for Malfoy, of all people. He was going to have to explain it to Ron and Hermione, so he might as well practise on himself.
She gave her husband a guilty shrug and, at length, handed the flash drive back to Draco.
“Oh, I don’t know, Potter. Possibly I was too busy doing the Dark Lord’s bidding so he wouldn’t murder me or my parents.”
He broke off abruptly. Harry would not want to be reminded that his Aunt Bella once existed, let alone listen to any advice she had given on occlumency. Hell, Draco didn’t like to remember her existence either. Meditation had certainly never cured her faults.
Ron opened his lips to speak, but Malfoy beat him to it. Good thing, because Ron had no idea what would have come out of his mouth.
"So what's the problem?"
Draco attempted to prove that point by nipping his finger, but Potter was too fast.
It was almost impossible to imagine Draco so chummy with a muggle, but Harry kept that thought to himself. “How do Shira’s parents feel about . . . about a regular muggle businessman in the family?”
“Yes, counting breaths. My occlumency is a little better now. But my legilimency is patchy at best. We don’t spend as much time on it as you’d think. Veritaserum is more reliable in the interrogation room.”
"That's not right." Hermione whispered the words, but they carried throughout the room.
->*<-
“Yes, well, living with the Dark Lord does rather teach you to keep your kvetching to a minimum.”
“He’s not going to bend on this—you know how stubborn he is. And he’s not wrong, Draco.”
"I'd offer it back, but I refuse to give up that bed."
Harry glared at him. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
"I hope your father's all right." Ron's voice was quiet and serious.
“It is not!” Harry was laughing outright now. “They’re the same thing. Whinging, kvetching—whining too. And you’re still just a whiny brat, aren’t you?”
She—Harry was pretty sure it was a she—performed a clumsy little curtsy. “Toffee at your service.”
Draco bit his lip. “You didn't specify that.”
“Yeah. What, you don’t like the look of her?”
"Harry? Are you still there?"
He was an animagus now too. Was that a requirement for deep cover?
“Of course. But if it’s your calling . . . well, then, it’s your calling. I won’t interfere with that.”
->*<-
Yet he hesitated. There was something about this door in particular. Something in Harry's gut told him to stop here, that whatever memory was hidden inside was especially important.
“They’ll turn it into something ugly,” Potter was saying. “What’s between Draco and me, I mean. And it isn’t! I swear, I’m not forcing him. I don’t care about the life debt. I only accepted it because Draco cares about it, but I told him—I said I’d still help him without that. And I still want to be with him without that. But they’ll say—”
Harry focused on the door. He had no idea what password Draco would use. Besides, Draco was almost at the end of the hall, about to turn the corner. He had to catch up. But as he started to move, he caught the faintest whiff of the memory.
But Draco squared his shoulders instead. “Harry, if you and my aunt are willing, I’d be honoured to meet them both.”
"I doubt that was his plan. I think—well, you did order him to bed."
Draco glanced up at him with a wan smile. “She never saw that side of my parents.”
Draco shifted until he was leaning back against the railing, fully facing Harry. “So why hide the facts? Why allow all the speculation to continue?”
Harry’s face was still hot. He knew he was close to fuming, but he did as Draco said anyway. He closed his eyes and slowed his breaths. His brain wouldn’t quite relax, but he felt it quiet a little.
George felt the same. “Bill, back up—I think you're scaring poor Malfoy here. He can probably smell the wolf in you.”
"You hate my family."
Harry sighed. "So I understand where muggle finances come into the estate now. Half the Malfoy fortune, at least, is in pound sterling—not the vaults of Gringotts."
“Draco, stop.”
“No. I just . . . I understood then. About you.”
That surprised a laugh out of Draco. "Probably. But I'll refrain."
Harry chuckled. "Look, you're curious and intelligent and playful. Sometimes in a dickish way, but still. And you're, you know, pointy and angular the way a ferret is."
Hermione sniffed. “Well, I’m sure Draco is still good at sucking up.”
"It's no use, Shira," Draco said at one point. "You can't blame everything on religion. I know that first hand."
“That thing?” Harry chuckled as he moved toward the window. “You had a beautiful owl yourself, as I recall. An eagle owl, yeah?”
"Probably."
“Settle down, Ferret.” Ron smiled. “I don’t count you in the bad category. Not anymore. Not ever, really. You were just . . . you know.”
"I suspect Granger would agree. She thinks our relationship might help do that—heal the past. But we still have to make it down the aisle, Potter."
“I don’t have your courage, Harry.” Draco swallowed. “Not even a tenth of it. I never did. Just remember that when you see my memories of Dobby.”
“Is that what you were thinking while you and Harry beat the crap out of me?” Draco demanded. “That I’m so pretty?”
“Trapped?” Harry supplied.
Draco looked amused. "Even my father taught me that muggles have their uses, Granger. And the sense to get their currency off the gold standard."
"Yeah."
So a magical creature injured him and he didn’t want McGonegal to find out. Word might well weave its way back to her regardless, though.
Weasley stared at him. “What did you do?”
“No, her sister—Shira’s Aunt Sarah. She’s the woman who taught me how to become an animagus.”
“Dunno,” Harry admitted. “But I’ll try not to be jealous of any former boyfriends of yours.”
Draco snorted. “Otherwise you would?”
“I have,” Harry insisted. “Look, I always knew you were a good looking git—”
“Anyway,” Shira continued, ignoring the controversy she had just kicked up, “I almost wish we had just made a baby while he was here, without bothering with marriage. But both our families would have lost their minds.”
Harry furrowed his brow. "Aren't you her plus one?"
She was flattered. The ferret was boosting her ego—in a good way, Ron thought. Malfoy finally appreciated Hermione properly. And respected her properly. The git really was over his prejudices against muggle-borns.
“They're not madly in love or anything, Ron. She's got a girlfriend. And Draco's got me.”
Now Draco knew that Snape was acting under Dumbledore's own orders; Harry had made the truth plain to everyone after the war.
It had started a while back, just before Draco’s trial. But it had really—what was the word he wanted?—blossomed, maybe. Yeah, that worked. It had really blossomed the other night.
Apparently Harry could cast Lumos silently and without a wand. Of course he could; why was Draco so surprised? The man was undoubtedly the most powerful wizard alive at the moment, however raw and undisciplined his magic.
“No? How about serving as the Holy Scarhead’s sex slave?”
Ron watched as his father sank into the cushions. “Sorry, Dad. Didn’t mean to be inhospitable.”
Harry and Draco landed smoothly in Hogsmeade, in a narrow alley just behind the Three Broomsticks. Draco, however, looked disoriented—only for a second or two, but long enough for Harry to notice and bite his lip in concern.
"It should feel later. You gained hours, remember? And don't you have a meeting this afternoon? Pull yourself together."
The ferret shrugged. “There’s this girl I stayed with in the states. One of the Baumgartens—”
Hermione considered the lot of them. “Yes, I suppose it did. They’ve been talking for hours, haven’t they?” She hesitated, frowning. “Harry, have you seen any of Draco’s friends? From back at Hogwarts, I mean, not his new ones from New York.”
Harry yelped in pain. “Draco! What the fuck—”
Bill, who was leaning forward in his chair, suddenly spoke up. "I don't suppose American guests are a good enough reason to get out of the assignment?"
“None that are acceptable in pure-blood families!” Lucius interrupted.
“Yeah. He brought me up here a couple of times. Showed me around.”
"The thing is—" Ron broke off to clear his throat before casting another glance at his wife.
“I think I understand why Mr. Baumgarten didn’t disown Noa.” Draco rested his chin on top of Harry’s head. “He’s a decent man, despite any prejudice against mixed marriages.”
Draco studied his bare chest and then gave a nod of satisfaction. "Very much. The aurors keep you fit. Here, let me help you."
"I think you're a bloody possessive virgin is what I think."
“But—” Harry broke off again, shaking his head as he sat back down.
The sneer stayed in place. "True. But I reckon Granger will keep you from becoming a proper tyrant." He raised his eyebrows again. "So are we sorted?"
“I’m sorry, Draco.” Harry was on his feet now. “I shouldn’t have . . . I shouldn’t have been prying. I was wrong, but—”
“Don’t run up after me like that! Apparate, if you must.”
What happened next was beyond Narcissa’s powers to mitigate. Potter was shouting, enraged, about the bloody Prophet and Lucius was snarling at him for his idiocy when it came to dealing with the press and somehow both men drew their wands—
"But what does he know the most about? Muggle finances and politics. Neither of those interest my dad. In fact, he despises both. So do you want me to make some excuse?"
“I think I can convince them to come to Grimmauld Place for dinner with Harry and Malfoy.”
“Oh, Arthur,” she said. “We didn’t expect you so early. And who is this you’ve brought?”
Harry had Draco's shirt open now and was inspecting Draco's chest for himself. But the slices and slashes from that vicious spell were long gone.
“They weren’t quarrels!”
“You know what I mean.” Malfoy paused to grunt. “Ironically, my parents always considered that sort of thing to be a muggle problem. We, as more advanced beings, don’t judge wizards by their skin colour or religion.”
“What did you say?”
Harry didn't have nearly that much faith in Lucius Malfoy, but, once again, he kept his mouth closed.
Draco stared at him for a long moment, his lips twitching. At length he gave into the laughter. “Very well.”
Meanwhile, if Harry were honest, he'd have to admit that Draco was probably reading Ron correctly. And, yes, the entire Weasley family would probably agree with him. There was more going on here, though. Draco was somehow being honest with him, yet distracting him at the same time.
“Yeah. So don’t keep this from him just to protect him. You don't have to tell him, but if you want to, he’ll be okay.”
“I think so, yes. I’m not sure what I’d do with it, but . . . yes.”
“For McGonagall? A few, yeah. Does he want to become an animagus?”
"Right. That. And playing up his cleverness might impress Hermione and Bill, but it won't impress my dad. And Draco can't do his pet act either, because my father's not going to drive a literal ferret to Heathrow—"
"Oh, this will play out just as you thought. No one at the ministry will touch Malfoy Manor, as long as I hold it." He hesitated, half-relishing and half-dreading the next step.
"From meeting Shira and Jamie, probably."
He shrugged. “It was another part of the equation. But I also did it for myself.”
“Why? It’s just a word. You’re not casting the spell this time. Go ahead. Say it. You have to, if you wish to get any further.”
“Yeah.” Weasley tossed a copy of the Prophet to Draco as he headed for the sitting room.
Draco shot him a withering glance.
Shira made a face, but she obligingly turned the subject. “All right, all right! How did you two end up together? Draco never said there was any contact between you. Not after his trial, anyway.”
"All to circumvent detection, yeah?" Ron shook his head. "Clever, but how far can we follow the money?"
“You wouldn’t, Potter.” He tried to make himself sound more confident. “Even if you don’t care what you put me through, you wouldn’t do that to Hagrid. He clearly has no desire to see my face again.”
And it took six months to become an animagus, didn't it? And you didn’t learn what animal you would become until after your first transformation. Although, if Draco knew what his patronus was, he might have known in advance. Harry remembered hearing that it was almost always the same.
Her face turned a bit red as she looked away. “They didn’t try to stop Bellatrix, you know.”
“Treat you as if you really are the second coming?" Draco grinned. “All right, I understand why you want to keep this quiet. We don’t need anyone seriously worshipping you or seriously attempting to lick your trainers. Again, not more than they already do.”
“Yeah, that’s true.” Harry nestled his face against Draco’s neck. “I’ll do my best to come home to you in one piece, you know.” He paused to bestow a kiss on that perfect, ridiculously pale skin. “Always.”
Malfoy complied, but not before giving him a startled look. “Why the rush?”
Harry swore under his breath as he shoved his phone back into his pocket.
“Which he might do, for a while. But only for a while.” Weasley favoured him with a grim smile. “He told me once, back when you were awaiting trial in Azkaban, that, in a way, he admired you for everything you were willing to do for the sake of your family.”
“Harry . . . .” He shook his head as his voice trailed off. “I’m sure Robards expected that I’d be able to apparate again. Eventually. I’m just—it’s not my special talent, all right? And I've got a sort of mental block about it.”
"I'm not technically authorised to review this." Granger's eyes devoured the screen regardless.
"You really are home." Ron yawned as he looked Harry up and down. "The Ferret's going to have a fit."
“The head of the aurors recruited Draco as an agent right after the war.” His voice was still frighteningly calm. “He spent the last three years spying on neo-Death Eaters.”
But Draco just snorted. "No designs, Weasley, but I'll admit it: I wouldn't kick the saviour of the wizarding world out of bed."
“Better,” Harry murmured, tugging him back into his arms. “Are you all right?”
“You two had a difficult relationship; I remember.”
“We don’t know that for sure! Besides, certain spells—”
And yet he was scarcely paying attention. He only cared enough about politics to vote intelligently and conservatively; he had lost interest in acquiring power for himself or his family.
“Yes, the ever-magnanimous saviour.” Lucius shook his head. “Thanks to Potter, Draco might just find the courage to defy us and form a—a domestic partnership or whatever muggle term covers two men who wish to mimic a marriage.”
He started their discussion by pointing out that Draco didn’t believe he was capable of casting a patronus, and that he either couldn’t or wouldn’t apparate any longer. Those two facts upset Hermione almost as much as they had upset Harry, and put her in sympathy with him.
Draco did that thing with his eyebrows. “Are you saying sex with you is only worth ‘settling’ for?”
“I thought he’d make it through three or four. But I was lucky. He didn’t find me very interesting, so he rarely bothered with me. Or rather, he did, but not as far as legilimency went."
“Good. It should be better known. It seems more real than the made up one.” Harry took a deep breath as he stared back down at the floor. “So I walked into the forest and . . . and I died. But then I was given a choice. Riddle was still a threat. I hadn’t destroyed the horcrux in Nagini. So I was allowed to, er, come back.”
Ron’s sigh was almost as forlorn as Shira’s. “So no pork here anymore, is that it?”
“Look, I’m fine with the idea of you having a boyfriend, okay? I don’t care that you’re bent. Or a little bent. Or . . . I mean, not that you need my approval—”
“Oh.” Harry gave him a sheepish smile this time. “Well, they’re both your family. And Teddy’s my godson. He lost his parents in the war; it would be good for him to have more family about. Good for Andromeda too, probably.”
“I need his advice on something, that’s all.”
He shrugged, blushing a little. "Mostly for your sake—but I also want to remind the bastard that Harry owns that obnoxious mansion of his now."
Harry's arms wrapped around him and Harry's lips brushed against his forehead, heedless of the sweat. “You stole all the blankets again,” he whispered.
“Yeah,” Ron put in. “He’ll be there for a week. Draco arranged for him to stay with the Baumgartens.”
Draco let out a long-suffering sigh. “Because we were, by my estimate, on rather uncertain terms. I had no idea how you’d react to such an offer.”
Draco raised one eyebrow at him. "You find your younger brother and Granger unreliable?"
Draco smiled at that. It would all prove rather more complicated, but he appreciated the sentiment.
It was a good meal. A brilliant one, really, and Ron found himself enjoying the ferret’s company. The bastard flirted shamelessly with Hermione, of course, but it was obviously harmless and she obviously thrived on it. And, anyway, Ron would punish him later by thrashing him at chess—Malfoy had promised him a game.
That brought Draco up short. “When did you hear him say that?”
“I gather he feels threatened by you,” Hermione said wryly. “And with reason, I imagine. You invaded a memory he had locked away, didn’t you?”
Draco stole a glance at his father, but he was still glowering at the head of the table. If he was impressed, he wasn't showing it.
Ron looked him over. “I actually didn’t mean it as an insult. I was serious before—I do like you better now.”
"I'm not sneering."
“He wants this!” Potter was losing his temper again. “And the second he stops wanting it, then it ends.”
Harry had felt an odd but poignant sympathy for his old nemesis when that article appeared. He hadn't known whether it was true or not—though his gut told him it was—but either way, it was no one's business but Draco’s.
“What do you mean?” Malfoy’s voice was sharp now. “Because he’s a bit bent?”
“Yes, we’ve established that.”
Bill grunted. “Welcome to pure-blood traditions.”
“Yes, so I assumed. But the US lets you fly into Newark Airport and start driving immediately?”
“I got into the habit at Hogwarts,” he explained. “I would get up before anyone else so I could work on assignments and revise for exams in peace. Besides, I had to make my high marks look effortless.”
"Right. Even a Malfoy's life is worth something, especially if our holy saviour deems it so."
Fuck, Draco was enjoying Ron's outrage. Harry could tell by the growing sneer on his face. So Harry kicked his foot, silently warning him not to bait Ron.
Ron wasn’t sure what to do with that confession. “Huh. I can’t picture you as part of a large clan. And I’ve heard of the Baumgartens—aren’t they a Jewish family?”
She looked shocked by the question. “Of course! It’s an honour to be serving Harry Potter, who saved the life of my Master Draco.”
Weasley took a seat next to his wife on an ugly chesterfield. “You still have to tell us what happened to you,” he was saying. “And why the hell you didn't ask me to come.”
“No!” Shit. Harry could feel his face heating up. Why was he making such a mess of this? “No. I mean it will be . . . I mean, it’s just not enough. I know I fucked up, Draco. If you want your bit of revenge, there has to be more to it than make-up sex.”
"It's why I called in your life debt. So I could protect you. Keep you safe."
That was harder to answer. And, unfortunately, it was the crux of the whole matter. “Not in the way you’re thinking. Nothing Harry and I do together will set me off.”
Harry pulled off his tee-shirt and tossed it on the floor. “Grooming, eh?”
"Is this seat taken, Malfoy?"
Draco boggled. “Circe, have you gone mental?”
“That doesn’t change all the rest.” Hagrid’s words were gruff and quiet. “I’m sorry, Harry, but— well, I can see you’re getting on with him. Or maybe you’re just being protective, him being in your service and all.” He pause as a guilty shadow passed over his face. “And I suppose Dumbledore, being how he was, would approve. But I’m not ready to welcome that twitchy little ferret here. Nor trust him either.”
"It's all right, Harry." He let his hand drop, but that fond look was back in his eyes. "Our relationship still includes, you know, affection and—well, whatever the fuck else is happening between us."
“During the trials?” Draco raised his eyebrows. “You found me attractive—when? I was a wreck back then.”
Draco tapped his foot, looking as if he'd very much like to cast an Imperious on Harry, so he wouldn't have to bother explaining things. "You'll be staying with Benjamin and Noa. One of them will pick you up at the airport, and Newark is much more convenient than JFK."
“To your father too?”
“Look, I’m not making excuses for him,” Ron said, “but he didn’t have much choice. Voldemort was threatening him and his parents—”
“Stop that,” he warned. “Now come on, Draco. We want to talk with you properly.”
So he and the holy scarhead dragged out the muggle laptop again. Fortunately—or unfortunately, rather—Harry did have both a webcam and internet access, and both worked despite the magic at use in the house. Damn all these new spells and wards that were making it easier and easier to use muggle technology.
Harry nodded. “I know. Thanks.”
“Of course you haven’t.” Surprisingly, Draco sounded more affectionate than annoyed. “Do so as soon as we hang up, please. You have your auror robes, but they probably won’t be necessary; the American wizarding community doesn’t go in for the old style. Not in Manhattan, at any event. Most of them dress as if they work on Wall Street.”
He urged Draco toward him, but slowly. Draco could have stopped him easily had he wanted to.
Wait. Harry shook himself as his brain seemed to freeze.
So he knew how this would play out: there would be a brief, poignant romance that would mellow into a sort of bemused affection on Harry's part. With luck, Harry would want Draco to stay in his life, but he would only be too happy to bless Draco's arranged marriage.
Harry rolled his eyes at the strict tone of his so-called servant. “Yes, sir.”
Draco turned toward Harry and propped himself up. "You could be generous and share the comfy bed, you know."
“I’m not disappointed. I’m just—” Harry broke off to step closer and put his hands on the door. Now Draco was trapped, rather than pinned, but he still didn’t seem to mind. “Draco, you must have known that I cared about . . . about what happened to you. Why else would I agree to keep my mouth shut when it came to your father?”
Narcissa looked at him thoughtfully. “It would mean there would be no formally recognised Malfoy heir. But Potter is correct; it needn’t mean the end of the Malfoy bloodline. A surrogate, with Draco as the biological father—”
Harry scarcely remembered the flight back; the novelty of flying had worn off, he supposed. Or perhaps he was too preoccupied.
He had switched to a different opening for that second game, one he’d been fairly certain would hold up against most of Weasley's defenses. Then he forced Weasley to trade queens a bit later. It was an even exchange in theory, but in practise Ron was still deadlier with the piece than Draco was, so the trade was really to Draco’s advantage.
He shook his head. “Don't include me in that. I was on the wrong side.”
Harry grinned. “See? That was your worst. I hated you at the time for it, but now . . . now I know that it shows your limits. And I’m okay with your limits.”
“Fuck, Harry, why aren’t you upset?”
His dad nodded. “I offered to wait in the sitting room, but she seemed to think everyone up here was, er, decent.”
"They do. The Ford Focus should do. And it's an estate car, isn't it? Plenty of extra room even apart from the extension charms."
Draco still didn’t answer—not straight away. He seemed to suck in a lung’s worth of air before finally deigning to speak.
“I do know a bit about legilimency, Malfoy.” And there was that determined look again. “Let’s do this.”
“Define ‘this.’”
Harry stared into those grey eyes of his—eyes that seemed dangerously stormy at the moment. "He's right that I want you under my thumb. And I can't promise that I won't be a bastard about it sometimes. Remember sixth year?"
“If Master wishes.” She hesitated. “But Master Draco and Kreacher are deciding which half of your clothing they might keep, and which half must be given to . . .” she paused as she furrowed her brow, apparently trying to remember the name.
Shira rolled her eyes. “You’re not even Jewish.”
"Yes!" Draco turned back to his mother. "Once by keeping me out of Azkaban; I'd have killed myself in there—"
"How about I let her know that you and I are dating? I reckon she'll be fine with that, as long as I haven't interrupted one of her potion experiments."
For now, Harry was just relieved that he'd gotten to Draco on time. He ought to have been pulled from the operation weeks ago. But the bastards at the ministry hadn't cared how much danger an ex-Death Eater was in, as long as he kept providing such valuable intelligence.
“Those were different. They were good memories. You didn’t mind me seeing them. You weren’t even trying to protect them. Not really.”
Narcissa and Lucius exchanged glances. Harry kept his mouth shut.
Weasley frowned. “Are you sure that's Malfoy? I wouldn't expect him to be so, um, affectionate with you.”
"Stay with them as a ferret? Why would Harry care?"
Harry stared at him. “Mostly?”
Draco shrugged. “Then it will have to be Malfoy Manor.”
“Yes. I don’t mean that in a bad way, but yes.”
Harry laughed. “You’re good at it. But I’m not sure that should be your career.”
To Harry’s surprise, he did. But only for a moment. Then he reached out, placed a hand on Harry’s arm, and gave him a look of sheer gratitude. “But it still helped. Knowing that it wasn’t just talk. That you really could defeat him.”
“As long as Draco’s not unduly attached to his foreskin,” Jamie said dryly.
“Harry, he has every right to despise me! And most of your friends will react the same way. You can't refuse to visit—”
“I would have accepted,” Harry said at once. “I mean, if Robards had never blackmailed you into becoming an agent, and you had just come to New York to get away from the British wizarding community—”
“Oh, good thing. That makes it so much better.”
Ron gulped as he turned to face his father, who was unaccountably standing next to a house elf he’d never seen before. A house elf who looked exceptionally proud of itself—herself? Yes, herself—as if she had just performed some heroic service.
"Are all American wizards like that?" Harry asked instead.
"Of course. Easiest way to place myself at your beck and call.”
How much did human scents change? Surely Ronald Weasley had never had such a relaxed air back at Hogwarts. He’d always been an easy target for ridicule, thanks to his hypersensitivity about . . . well, everything: his family’s poverty, his mediocre skill in Quidditch, and his general sense of inferiority.
"Yeah, yeah. I'll do my best. Where are Shira and Jamie?"
"Uh, Harry?"
“Depends. What sort of advice?”
“But you haven’t answered my question, Harry.” There was a pointed look in his eyes.
Had he? Forgive felt like a strong word, considering.
But Draco didn’t wait to hear how it was different. Instead he went through the lightning-fast ritual of summoning his most playful, curious and, paradoxically, restful self. A bare second later and he was in ferret-form, burrowing under the loose tee-shirt Harry had worn to bed, and settling down on Harry’s chest.
Draco allowed his lips to curl into a sneer as he rolled onto his back. “Yes, I should certainly bow before your superior skills.”
“What’s wrong, Malfoy?” Harry couldn’t stop the slow, mischievous grin from spreading across his face. “Afraid to drive on the opposite side of the road? If you know how to drive at all, that is.”
“Yes. Dobby and Kreacher both, actually.” Harry smiled a little. “Kreacher just went on and on about the noble cast of your aristocratic features or something. And how he’d rather be serving you.”
“Not at all. Unfortunately, we didn't have much time together, because I was only driving them to the airport, but—"
“No, he despises it.” Harry sat down on the couch and placed Draco on his lap, but held onto his scruff. “He wants to be the one to redecorate, though.”
Harry rolled his eyes. "Are you saying that Hermione isn't a Weasley?"
Draco sighed. Of course Harry wouldn’t let that go without comment.
“I’m a Slytherin. I mean that as a compliment.” He was fixing the cuff of Harry’s blazer now. “So between the two of you, I reckon you can fix some protocols.”
She shot him a curious, demanding look. "Which is?"
He kept up the 'dooking' in response. What a stupid word for it, though.
"You awake enough?"
“Harry!” A feminine voice with an unmistakable American accent cut Hagrid off mid-sentence. “So glad you’re here.”
"That's perfect," Draco piped up. "Thank you."
Harry blinked. “And how would breaking up with me upset Arthur?”
Lucius and Narcissa did the polite thing: they walked him out of the mansion and far enough from the wards guarding it so that he could disapparate with ease.
Draco hadn’t been jealous. Well, all right. He’d been a little jealous. He had hated the way Harry managed to charm all their teachers. Well, excepting Snape, of course. And even he’d cared for Harry in his own way.
There was an appraising look in Draco's eyes now—oh, right. That explained why Harry felt shy. Best to brazen it out, probably. "Like what you see?"
Harry couldn’t answer that, other than to say that it took a great deal of focus and lots of meditating. “And, anyway,” he added, “don’t you think it’s unhealthy?”
Draco swallowed. “That will be lovely.”
“So you were just waiting until you could get the most from me in the bargain? Protect your parents, protect Malfoy Manor?”
Harry fell silent. Draco was right. Well, half-right, perhaps. Harry had a responsibility to keep him safe, and that meant, in part, ensuring that he could apparate out of a dangerous situation.
Harry didn't let go right away. Instead, he tightened his grip. "I expect you to hold up your end too. This agreement isn't just going to be for show on your part."
It's, um, been a very long time! *Wears the face of shame.* My apologies to everyone who has been kind enough to follow this story. I don't intend to let so much time pass again!
Eventually Draco refocused on the conversation at hand. Both Granger and Weasley were reasonably sure they would be allowed to return to work on Monday. And Ron was betting that Robards would be gone by then—either sacked or forced to resign over the weekend.
The wands, right. That was something abstract to think about. Since both wands behaved so well for Draco, that had to mean the connection between them was real, didn't it? They weren't just two kids messing about. They had long term potential.
He looked a little guilty. “Ron and I meant to tell you. And Draco.”
“Not even close.”
“But . . .” Draco, for once, seemed at a loss for words. “You’re allowed to drive in the States without a license?”
“—and he didn't really want to harm him either.”
Draco gave him a tentative smile. "Happy to."
"I changed at our bank for a hundred quid. We've got more than enough for the cinema and dinner after."
He paused, cocking his head at Draco.
Malfoy chuckled. “That’s an embrace, Potter, not a shove.”
Harry managed a smile at that. Draco actually sounded a bit awed to have such staunch friends.
"Oh." Harry stared at him, impressed that he'd put together such a calming and, well, grown-up room. Ron and Hermione's flat looked like it belonged to frazzled, caffeine-addicted university students. And 12 Grimmauld Place was currently a gothic disaster.
“I don’t need details!” Weasley admirably bit back his distaste at the very thought. “And, anyway that’s not a crime. Or, well, not a crime on your part; you were coerced. Where’s this bloke now?”
"Granger. Of course." Draco let out a frustrated sigh. "I worship the woman, but she doesn't understand our relationship."
“Yeah.” Malfoy stopped walking and turned his head toward him, eyes narrowed. “Why? Think she’ll react like Hagrid?”
“Toffee,” Draco said softly, “is Kreacher still out of the house?”
Draco opened his mouth to retort, but Potter spoke up first.
Shit, Draco must have left tiny puncture wounds. “I’m sorry. I—”
“I—I didn’t know what to make of that. Or of the fact that you were helping us at all.”
“And Goyle’s, in fairness.”
Potter's scent was overwhelming just now. Sweat, blood, petrol, and a lingering whiff of sandalwood that was probably aftershave. And, underneath all that, a deeper, distinctive scent that was just, well, Potter.
Potter took a step toward him. “You're not going back undercover. Just . . . you're not.”
“They'll come around. But forget about them for now. Is it what you want? Marriage, commitment?
He tensed. “Can't, not won’t.”
"Don't worry, Potter,” he drawled. “I'm not assaulting your hetero virtue. Not tonight."
“Draco didn’t kill Dumbledore.” Harry’s voice was sharp and uncompromising. “You know that. You know what really happened.”
But she would not let that bother her. No one knew they were coming to Hogwarts, and the school was well-protected. Besides, she knew the job Ron had signed on for, and she was determined not to become too worried for him. Not after everything they had already survived.
“Yes.” Draco didn't elaborate.
"Good save," Ron murmured.
Harry stroked him gently, careful not to disturb him. It still amazed him that Draco had accepted his ferret-hood with good grace, considering the way Crouch Jr. had humiliated him. Merlin, just reminding Draco of the transfiguration had been enough to shut him up for weeks afterward.
It was a long and surprisingly chaste kiss, at first. But soon they were opening their mouths to each other and exploring each other. It seemed neither of them cared that they had morning breath or that Draco's parents were somewhere nearby or that this was probably a disastrous idea.
Harry found himself grinning. Draco wasn’t too protective of these memories, because without any serious effort Harry could all but live them. It was as if he were at the table with Draco and a host of people Harry didn’t recognise. One argument seemed to concern U.S. presidential primaries. That must have been sometime before the 2000 election, then. Even Harry, who purposely and resolutely remained ignorant of both magical and muggle politics, knew that George W. Bush was now president of the United States.
Harry shook his head at both of them and then turned to Granger, whose paperwork was now sprawled across the chesterfield. “Hermione, wait. I’ve got a better idea than wasting our day on filling out forms.”
Harry would go on to marry someone appropriately heroic and Draco—well, Draco would do his best to be a decent husband and loving father. And he would settle for whatever scraps Harry would spare him.
Draco snorted. "The Prophet will have a field day with that. They'll be eating up this life debt as it is."
“It was.” Harry’s tone was rueful.
Potter met the man's gaze and held it. "You know, I don't feel bad about that. Draco lived under your thumb, then under Voldemort's, and then under Robards'. I reckon he's best off under mine."
Draco shrugged. “If you really want to reform the aurors, advancement is the way to go about it.”
Draco looked relieved as he furrowed his brow. “On either the 102nd or the 103rd floor of the north Twin Tower. Cantor Fitzgerald’s offices go from the 101st to the 105th, but I can never remember which one Benjamin’s desk is on.”
Draco shrugged. "We don't have to go that far. No further than last night."
“Scared, Potter?”
Fuck. Harry's brain froze. What was he supposed to say to that?
"Are you really this clueless?" Draco stared at him, half in amusement and half in bewilderment. "You think Shira and I can't manage to shag enough to produce a couple of little Malfoys?"
“About me?”
“Well, um, I might have suggested they spend more time together. Draco could help Hagrid with some chores after all, seeing as how he'd enjoy the manual labour . . . .”
That turned out to be the wrong thing to say. Ron’s lips twisted with a jealousy that might have faded over the years, but had yet to die.
"Potter," Draco complained. He stopped rubbing.
“I still want to wipe that sneer off your face.” Harry walked over to him and put his arms around Draco’s waist. “In a good way.”
“Doesn’t matter, I suppose.” Draco shook his head and then, after a ragged breath, took a seat on the bed. “All those classrooms you saw—Harry, I told you. I keep them locked for a reason.”
“He said so. Said he wouldn’t touch Ginny no matter how beautiful she was. Or words to that effect.”
“They must have done, don’t you think? Sirius Black was your godfather. You generally acquire godparents at your christening. Unless they did something more informal.”
Draco folded his arms across his chest. “Possibly. When you convince me that this is, indeed, my forever home.”
Draco sighed as he kissed Harry’s cheek. “There’s such a thing as conversion, you know.”
Fortunately, there were some supportive letters as well. Many of them dismissed the whole story, arguing that an agreement between two consenting adults wasn't newsworthy or anyone else's concern.
"Do you want me to toss him out?"
“And Mrs. Baumgarten—she would have been furious if he tried to disown Noa,” Draco continued. “There would have been a raging battle. But, fortunately, he values the concept of peace in the home.”
Draco’s voice turned cautious. “And you . . . you don’t resent him for that?”
Draco grinned. "Small wonder. It's not as though any Weasley has ever had a servant before. The novelty of it must be intoxicating."
Draco must have caught it too, because he rushed to reassure him. “Kreacher and Toffee are both excellent cooks, even within those constraints. I promise you won’t starve.”
For a moment, Harry was certain that Draco would make excuses.
"Yes, Lucius, I have."
“You don’t get a say in this, Draco. Not unless you want to cancel this debt to me.”
“Perhaps.” Harry winked. “I do own you, Malfoy.”
“If I die an untimely death I’d want you to become their third.”
“Because he liked having it, and it wasn’t as harmful to me as he imagined.” His smile grew almost proud. “That’s a critical part of occlumency, Potter. Give the person penetrating your brain a secret that’s not nearly as important as he thinks it is.”
"I am too," Harry said. "But you can tell your parents that I'll be happy to join them for your birthday dinner at whichever restaurant they choose. It will just be a week later than planned."
Draco smirked. “Because you’re an impulsive Gryffindor who needs time to think this through.”
He unbuttoned his left sleeve and rolled it up, leaving his dark mark in clear view.
“You’re the saviour, mate,” Ron said through a mouthful of something. Muggle crisps, judging by the colorful foil bag he’d pulled from his pocket. Draco wondered where in the ministry he had gotten hold of those.
There was a certain bitterness in her tone. Draco understood why, and suddenly found himself wishing for his father's skill in networking.
Harry and Granger had been waiting for them utside of McGonagall’s office. Draco briefly entertained the idea of sneaking off on his own, but he rather liked having two aurors to protect him. And, all right, it would have been difficult to elude them, even as a ferret.
All smoke and mirrors from the powers that be at the ministry. Malfoy must have seemed the ideal choice to infiltrate a group of neo-Death Eaters. He was a former Death Eater himself, after all. And Harry knew he was skilled in occlumency.
"Draco, come on. Do you really want this marriage?"
“No, I’m not.” There was a rueful tone in Harry’s voice. “But I understand the value of occlumency now, trust me.”
Draco answered in a bored drawl, but Hermione didn’t miss the blush that crept onto his cheeks. “I’ve grown rather partial to Jewish traditions."
"Well, she was even younger than me." Potter sounded defensive.
As for Draco, he seemed to be brooding now. So much so that even Ron noticed.
“I know Harry,” Ron persisted. “He’s not going to sit down to dinner at the Burrow when you’re not allowed there.”
Draco shook his head, sneering a little. "You're quite generous in your reading of me, but never mind. You can see why I don't trust myself enough to be in charge of my own life. It's never landed me anywhere good."
“Into my shirt?”
“I know exactly what you are, Draco.” He tightened his grip. “And I still have your wand, you know.”
“Want to talk about it?”
“Why didn’t you learn during our sixth year?”
But Hagrid was having none of that. “Harry! I can’t believe you, of all people, would—”
Draco felt his eyes go wide. He bit back any response, though. He was not about to risk ruining this moment.
But Draco shook his head. “Not that I know of. He didn’t bother with every corner of the mansion. As far as I know, the other Death Eaters left it alone too.”
“It won’t hurt to have me too, you know.”
“Yeah. As  it turns out, it sucks to be a pure-blood when you’re a squib,” Jamie explained. “No one’s begging to arrange a marriage with me.”
“Dunno.” Harry gave him a brief hug that he hoped was comforting. “Suppose we’d better find out.”
“Oh.” Harry blinked at the thought of Draco or Narcissa reading books like that, and then burst out laughing too. Only for a moment, though, before remembering why he was here. “How do I access your memories? I thought the surface ones would be obvious.”
But his father knew how much he owed Potter, and he couldn’t tolerate being in the saviour’s debt.
Draco didn't even pretend to consider. "None. Shall we commence with the snogging?"
“Don’t put words into my mouth.” Hermione was exasperated now. “And, please, stop with the self-loathing.”
“Then you shouldn’t have been in the field!”
"Not in the same way Ron is."
"If I can survive the rest of my life under your thumb, you can survive one night at Malfoy Manor."
Harry considered that. “It might answer.” He paused as a thought struck him. “Toffee, would you start breakfast please? I’m not sure what Kreacher was planning to serve, but—”
“Exactly as I say! Tell me what Robards has on you. Whatever it is, we’ll fix it. And then we'll tell Robards and the whole ministry to go and fuck themselves.”
“Hmmm.” Draco yawned and shut his eyes. “Perhaps I’ll tell you sometime.”
"With you and Hermione?"
“Huh. Well, maybe Snape didn’t agree? Or maybe he thought—I dunno what he thought.” Harry paused to fold his arms over his chest. “But he really did hate me sometimes. He kept looking at me and seeing my father. And he really, really hated my father.”
"What?" Ron turned a little red. "I don't care whether your family keeps the place or not, Malfoy, but I'm curious."
Draco turned back to stare at him and then huffed out a laugh. “My bad, I suppose. I should have confessed everything to you right then.”
He snorted. “And you're still a sap.” He made to get up. “Come on, Potter. Let's get cleaned up and scourgify the linens.”
“I don't care what you believe! You have no right to poke around in my mind.”
“Bully? That’s how you saw me in school?”
"It has to be. How else to explain why you're spending so much time with a former Death Eater?"
“Please, Potter. If you can manage, I certainly can.”
First, Harry used his own wand and gave Draco back his. The wand seemed to work for Draco again. And not just in the perfunctory way that any wand will work for any wizard. No, it worked in a way that meant it recognised and acknowledged Draco.
"Oh, we're not changing." Potter’s face was fierce and determined now. "I want Robards to see just how close he came to getting us both blown up."
The house elves looked from one man to the other. Neither bothered to hide their interest in the power struggle that was taking place in front of them.
Weasley snorted at that, recovering a bit of his colour.
Ron didn’t realise it at first, because he was facing the opposite direction, but it was not Kreacher who opened the door and crossed the threshold. In fact, Ron only stopped wrestling because Draco had suddenly turned white. (Yes, even whiter than usual.) And then Hermione let out a little gasp, which she quickly turned into a welcoming smile.
“To save my life, you mean.”
Wait, was it normal to visit the father of someone who was serving a life debt to you? Even if said father was a mortal enemy? “Er, yes.”
still playing. He'd have to wait for that to come out on video, though. Or find a time turner.
It was hard to say what made this so heavenly—except that, for the first time since sixth year, Draco wasn't living with a relentless fear coiled in his gut. Thanks to Harry, he was okay, his parents were okay, and even Malfoy Manor was okay. And now Draco had the rest of his life to show his gratitude.
“Yes. Though I didn’t finish it alone. You know Neville beheaded Nagini in the end. And once that horcrux was destroyed, there must have been a way to defeat Riddle even without—”
“Show them to me? We don’t have a pensieve here.”
“Doubt it. Potter’s right—I’m worthless as a spy now. And I’m not exactly auror material.”
"I've got one." Harry tried, unsuccessfully, to keep the smugness out of his tone.
Jamie elbowed her. Hard, from the looks of it.
“Don’t talk nonsense. Can't see the Auror Department getting away with that—”
Benjamin slouched right next to him and lowered his voice. “Look, I get this much: you fucked up. And you feel like an outcast in your world—”
“Possibly, yes. Not that we can test him.”
“No.” Draco’s voice was a strained whisper.
“Of course. Look, an American can fly into Heathrow, rent a car, and drive out into London.”
"Unbelievable," Ron was saying. "Shacklebolt wants you in New York? Without me?"
“Draco, he’s not going to hurt you.”
Was this the look Draco had worn whilst working on the vanishing closet? Was that combination of curiosity and concentration—with a healthy dollop of determination too—what made him so good at magic that required time and patience?
"Quite domestic, Draco."
The name Benjamin sounded familiar, but Harry latched onto the business name instead. “Cantor Fitzgerald? That’s a muggle company?”
Harry was still smiling as he unwrapped the note. “No response required, I see. Off you go!”
Draco blinked. “He said that?”
"Yeah," Harry agreed. "But because of our history, and because . . . well, I am a bit of a violent person, I can't lay a hand on you to punish you. Not even a, um, punishment that wouldn't really hurt you."
“Doubt it. That would require you to move, remember?”
“How much of my past do I owe Harry?”
“Perhaps,” Hermione acknowledged, “but that sort of twisted idolatry was hardly compatible with any of the world’s religions. Whatever their faults," she rushed to add, forestalling another rant. "And Draco's right: humans don’t need religion to be brutal to one another.”
Harry took a ragged, shaky breath. “I’m not a saint. And I’m not proud of everything I did along the way—but it wasn’t any killer instincts of mine that defeated Voldemort. Quite the opposite.”
“For the millionth time Malfoy. You know that we can’t do that. 1) We’ve never been to South Park so we’d probably splinch and you know MACUSA doesn’t pay for medical expenses. 2) They’ve had to put an anti-apparition ward around the entire vicinity until they know exactly what’s going on. 3) You know they don’t have floo travel here. 4) We need to be seen travelling to not appear suspicious. 5) Get in the goddamn car!”
“That’s true.” Draco nodded before lapsing into a thoughtful silence. Deliberating, he decided to confide the worries of his mind that had been bugging him.
“I guess… I mean.. um I think so?” Harry was a mess of anxiety and anticipation.
His mother had been eager in her endeavours to reunite with her remaining family in the aftermath of the war. His Aunt Andromeda did not exactly welcome with open arms, but she had at least agreed to a renewed acquaintance. Several years had passed and Draco regularly accompanied his mother to his Aunt’s house for tea and to spend time with his seven year old cousin.
Mercifully they made it in one piece, with only one instance of Draco shouting in alarm at Harry about pedestrians on the other side of the road. It was fortunate that he had nerves of steel, and had half expected it from similar excursions with Ron, otherwise he might have swerved into oncoming traffic with the blonde shrieking in fear.
Blaise opened up his charmed portfolio, a clever blend of arithmancy codes he’d used to provide an update account of the store’s balances. “It would seem that the store is holding steady, in fact there’s been a spike in sales since the news articles first hit.”
“Ah, good if the date runs late.” Blaise winked before sauntering over to the bar, clearly ever aware of the many eyes upon his delectable figure. Draco was used to his friend’s conspicuous posturing and just smiled bemusedly. It was always one hell of a night when he went out with Blaise. The man could certainly hold his liquor.
“Well, if you don’t care about Potter, I can tell you right now that you won’t care for this guy.” At Draco’s look, he continued. “Because this guy is Potter.”
“I’m not sure you can ever make up for ruining my store.” Harry spoke softly with a tinge of melancholy.
Draco gulped. Why had he done this to himself? “We agreed that we’d both carry a blue handkerchief in our top pocket.” He gestured to his azure blue pocket square.
Quickly recovering the blonde smoothed out of his features, nodding in greeting, “Potter. I should have known you’d be lurking in the shadows waiting to jump out at me.”
“That I was.” Draco admitted with a soft chuckle, before letting out a minute sigh.
“Good, and competitors?” Lucius raised an eyebrow in inquisition.
Pushing down any feelings of guilt, Harry tapped his wand to the nondescript parchment and waited in anticipation for the familiar looping script of WOL to appear. It was similar in look to his Marauder’s Map, running on the same runic Harry imagined. Except, this had the latest WAPPs, Wizarding Apps, and Harry was amazed at the innovation behind the fusion of magic and muggle technology.
Kenny sighed. He wanted to help Butters, but he didn’t want to make it worse for him. He knew how shitty South Park’s social services were from first hand experience. He supposed they only had a year and a bit left and then they could both move away. He would take any job he could find if it meant he could earn enough money to look after both him and Leo.
Draco took an admittedly large swig from his glass of wine before answering. “Of course I’m not ashamed of you. I just don’t want to spend an evening being scowled at by distant family members from the ‘light side’ of the war.”
“I see. Well, as long as you still love me?” Harry smiled at his fiancé.
His father’s study was as forebodingly decadent as ever when the two were shown in by one of their legions of house-elves. Draco had grown out of his childhood taste of ostentatious opulence, preferring his spacious and minimalistic home to the gaudy gold fixtures that plagued the study.
Harry eagerly tapped his reply, happy to have no interruptions for once as he spoke inanely about his day to day life with the man who already felt like a friend.
“Fine. Whatever. Come in Malfoy.” Harry shrugged, too tired to delay the inevitable.
Before Kyle could call him out on his rudeness, there was a crash of noise as Tweek burst in through the school’s main entranceway, looking harried as he scrambled over to them.
“Likely story. Tell me, how do you sleep at night?” Harry fumed.
Meanwhile I have ideas for my usual cute South Park stuff that’s my typical fic style that I might just write.
“Alright. But just so you know my buttercup, you’ve done nothing wrong. You’re the nicest guy I know.” Butters began to protest this statement but Kenny shushed him. “If you ever need me, I’ll come get you straight away. Whatever time of day. No questions asked.”
“I’m doing just fine my buttercup. What you doing on the bus though? Doesn’t your dad normally take you?” Kenny asked, taking in the dark circles that marred the usually flawless porcelain skin.
“How can you be ‘sort of’ seeing someone?” Draco smirked but inwardly he felt deflated, he hoped Harry wasn’t dating anyone. He wanted his chance.
Draco for once was gobsmacked. “I didn’t know you had it in you Potter. You’re clearly busy, I’ll leave you to it.” He managed tonelessly. Harry had hit his mark and Draco rose despondently. The brunette watched the figure leave, guilt and bitterness filling up within him as he did so.
“You’re right.” Astoria interrupted sitting primly on their shared king sized bed. “Tuscany would be boring, we need to show we are adventurous. Maybe we could go to Rio De Janeiro? Ooh we could hire a private yacht..”
Harry couldn’t avoid the underlying worry that nagged him in the days following the announcement of Quality Quidditch’s imminent arrival. Though he tried to put on a brave face, coupled with unyielding optimism, he couldn’t help but fear that the reputation of the superstore was warranted and that it would shut down his shop with ease.
Just yesterday, there had been the return of the lobster people for the fifth time! Their intent of world domination had inevitably been thwart by the miraculous appearance of Tom Cruise and the church of Scientology that apparently had a beef with the crustacean army.. or something. In all honesty it didn’t make sense. At all. And Kyle struggled to keep on top of it, and was long past done.
In the days leading up to Christmas, Draco had had enough of the hints from both his mother and Astoria about a proposal. Visiting his mother for his weekly standing invitation for afternoon tea had always been a pleasant enough affair, now all his mother seemed to say and ask was; when are you and Astoria going to get married? Why don’t I have any grandchildren? Do you want me to get your grandmother’s engagement ring out of the vaults?
“I’m sure he’s just running late.” Harry shrugged defensively, ignoring the sting of hurt as he recalled their no-show.
“Erm… no.. they’re beautiful? I just don’t know why you got me them?” Harry really did have difficulty concentrating on anything but the figure in front of him.
“Why the fuck are they having a fight? And why here at our school?” Tweek squeezed his fists.
“Lame.” Cartman huffed as he finally took a seat, squishing Kenny into the window. A cheerful hello from a fellow passenger made both boys turn around.
“What do you douches want?” Came Craig’s surly voice when they ambled up to him in the corridor. They had noticed that despite all the cars parked outside the school, the hallways were bereft of people. Other than the perpetually pissed off Craig who was carrying a travel cup filled with coffee, presumably for his boyfriend Tweek.
“I think you should wear these jeans with this shirt. I’m not sure he’d be able to resist you like that.” Draco plucked the old jeans from the wardrobe that Harry had forgotten he’d bought when he’d first started on the gay scene and believed that he had to wear tight fitting clothing all the time.
Draco masked any hurt he felt at the throwback to their meeting on the train and simply sniffed disdainful. “It’s just not very original is all I’m saying.”
“I’m not sure what would have happened Malfoy, but I think we can both admit we’ve always been drawn to one another.”
of all things garbage. You should listen to what they call music today.”
Lucius nodded thoughtfully, “Our opening announcement sparked any waves in the community?”
Kyle was
“What plan?” He asked blithely, summoning a tumbler for his unexpected guest to drink from.
Though his professional life had been nothing but a success, his personal was starting to give him a headache. Astoria had found his invitation to his Aunt Andromeda’s annual Harvest lunch, which he’d been planning on ignoring, and insisted that they both attend. She felt that it would be the perfect way to cement their relationship with the introduction to the extended family. Draco disagreed and the argument was still ongoing.
“Hey fellas! How you both doin’ today?” Butters called from the seat behind, making Kenny automatically smile whilst Cartman sighed in exasperation.
On his way back down the stairs, he spotted a strikingly familiar head of white blonde hair. Harry, of course, needed a closer look and so followed the figure towards the drinks table.
“MACUSA are expecting you tomorrow evening, an international portkey has already been set up for then.”
“Merlin, you really are a saint Potter. That’s one lucky guy.”
Understanding what Malfoy was indicating, Harry ruffled his own hair with a self-deprecating smile. “Oh yeah it’s one of our busiest days today and we have a lot of loyal customers. Still, there’s that Quidditch Direct store coming soon that might give us some competition.”
The blonde cleared his throat. “Speaking of terrifying head of houses; got to admit Snape had that competition won fair and square.”
His doorbell rang loudly. Startled, Harry wrapped his dressing towel tightly around his underdressed body and edges towards the door. It was the middle of the day during the workweek and so it was unlikely to be Hermione visiting, and Ron would use the floo if he wasn’t in a grumpy mood with Harry at the moment. Harry had broken up with Ginny the previous weekend after the closure of his store. He was currently single and unemployed, life was certainly not working out well for him. Still, it could only get worse when he saw just who it was that was visiting him.
Draco took the opportunity to interrupt her vivid fantasy. He swallowed knowing that it must be said. “Astoria. I don’t think I can marry you.”
“Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. You’re lucky you like both. Maybe a guy would be better?”
“It seems that Paris Hilton has returned and she’s having a fight with Dolly Parton in our cafeteria later on.” Kyle answered as he scrolled through his phone on the Twitter feed. Tweek startled, he’d not even noticed the presence of the other two until that point.
“Ah.. but you was a bit of a prat.” His tone was teasing with no venom or bite.
Draco rolled his eyes. “How Hufflepuff of you. Are you saying you would still date him if he had warts on his face?”
Draco stood mutely, watching the interaction with an arched brow as Astoria bade them both a goodbye with the fondness only a tipsy person could muster.
Still not sure whether to write this... but I do have some ideas plot wise? So I’ll write it but it may be slow going as this is a fusion that is quite tricky for me.
“Are you sure?” Harry gulped as the fabric fitted to his thighs and buttocks like a glove.
“Because, I want something Potter.” Distrust filled the brunette’s eyes before he continued. “I want to be your friend.”
Draco blanched at the turn of conversation. “Now wait one second, I don’t think…”
“Potter. Look. I’m sorry okay? Can you let me in, I wanted to talk.” Piercing silver eyes implored him and Harry wavered, sighing in resignation.
It was only sensible after all, who knew what this messenger would be like? He could be a crazed neo-deatheater embarking on a serial killing rampage, Draco as his first victim. No, it was best to have back up. Though the blonde would never admit that the real reason he’d pressured his friend to escort him was that he was too chicken to meet the man he had grown to desire.
“Indeed, you are when you’ve annoyed me.” Draco smirked.
“Potter, why did we say we’d keep him?” Draco groused, groggy in his warm duvet and blonde hair ruffled with sleep.
Harry eagerly opened his mail from SN7 the following morning, a wave of happiness surging through him. He enjoyed hearing about the other man’s exploits, even if they had yet to schedule another meeting.
Harry watched him leave and head over to a pretty dark haired woman poised elegantly on a love seat. His observation was interrupted however by a warm hand placed on the crook of his elbow.
“Oh so I’m Potter now?” Harry joked, amused despite the cacophony of noise that reigned in their room.
“I wonder sometimes. If I hadn’t been a Malfoy and you’d not been the saviour whether we’d have worked? Or maybe if my family hadn’t owned Quidditch Direct and you didn’t own Quality Quidditch and we’d met again through Teddy?” The earnest tone tugged at his heart strings and he felt an urge of longing.
He was left to his own devices in the hours after the party; Ginny had decided to use the unexpected free time to hit the gym and upon returning had promptly fallen asleep, clearly worn from an extensive workout. This had given Harry many, many hours to stew about the conversations he’d shared with Malfoy and the anger that simmered beneath. How could Harry have been so stupid to think that the blonde may have changed? How could he have begun to admire the manipulative jerk? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
“Can you really
“Isn’t that the truth. Still, I guess it’s too late. You have that love letter guy to meet.” Draco sighed.
Harry shivered as he shrugged out of the clothing, trying not to feel self-conscious at the appraising stare Malfoy gave him.
“Merlin Potter! Who gave you your licence? A dimmer than average troll?” The blonde was back to sneering now he was on safe ground.
“I know.” Draco hung his head. Then, in a moment of courage and humility, he stuck out his hand once more for Potter to shake. “But I do want to try.”
“Well, don’t laugh.” Harry began awkwardly. “Do you know those W-books?”
Not finished yet but thought I’d post what I’d written previously. Get back to writing this one too since I’ve been getting back into it during my time off.
“Oh… um. Yeah. I’ll bring it.” Harry fled to the other side of the open kitchen where he could compose himself amongst the cupboards. He brought the collection he’d been gifted and placed it beside the blonde.
“Shut it Malfoy. I drove just fine. We’re here after all.” Harry gestured to the embossed MACUSA sign that adorned the non-descript building in front of them.
“Yes.” Harry nodded earnestly.
The sarcastic tone amused Harry more than it should and he felt thankful once more that he met the mysterious man in the Wizards with Web chatroom that he’d happened upon a few days after purchasing the W-book for himself. The Wizarding World was small and so to keep it fun and light-hearted they agreed to keep it anonymous for now, Harry for obvious reasons was not eager to reveal his identity for a while. Too many tedious prophet related scandals had deterred him from opening up more to strangers.
Both Malfoys ignored the muttered, ‘I bet you would’ that Blaise couldn’t help but comment. Instead, Lucius furrowed his brow; “Hmm, if the Chosen One is running the show, it could pose more of a difficulty. Surely his many fans come there to gawk at him?”
Though Harry was content in the steady thrum of his personal life; Ginny though away for the season still sent weekly owls, he saw Hermione and Ron with the rest of the Weasley family at least once a week at the burrow and he had made time to spend with Teddy (when he was sure he wouldn’t run into Malfoy), but sadly the run up to Christmas brought yet more devastating news. His store was still in trouble.
He trailed off, feeling like an absolute idiot. Malfoy had played him, coming in to his store, being all friendly and charming, trying to sabotage him! Harry fumed. Anger that had not dwelt within him since school rose up valiantly and he marched towards where the git stood surveying the party.
Ginny tried for the millionth time to get his hair to stay flat. A loud sigh later and Harry could see her reflection in the mirror, holding up her hands in defeat.
“Dangerous game.” Blaise laughed softly, “Hope it doesn’t blow up in your face when he finds out.”
“How about if he refused to shower or use a scourgify?”
Saviour’s Store needs Saving!
“That’s good, isn’t it Draco? I mean you like this guy. Though what will you say to Astoria?” Blaise spoke reasonably.
Harry was startled. He’d not seen the blonde properly in years, and now here he was accompanying his beloved godson. The lithe figure of grace sauntered its way over towards him and Harry had to swallow the dryness of his throat.
“You’ll be fine…” Ginny waved him off, “Now did you see the article Johnson had written about the team the other day? I honestly can’t believe that she’d said Hollingsworth was the star player.”
to your dad?” Kenny had to ask, he was always happy to use his alter ego, Mysterion hadn’t come out much these days. The teens had stopped playing superheroes when they’d reached high school, so now it was mainly just Kenny.
“Pretty dressed up to meet a friend?” Draco mused. “You’ve even got yourself a blue pocket square. Surprised you knew those existed. Being fashionably challenged and all..”
“Why the fuck do you carry that around with you?” Cartman demanded.
“Ah yes, I thought that had closed down a few years ago? Didn’t the owner decamp to the continent after the war?” Lucius asked with little care to the answer.
Smiling softly to himself, Draco composed his reply making sure to add in as many witty jibes he could muster. A glance at the clock told him that it had been half an hour since he’d started and that the hour was exceedingly late. Sighing, he pressed send and crept back into his bed, setting a tempus alarm for the morning. It was going to be a long day.
“Oh, I’ve heard about those.” Ginny piped up, having left her entourage of sport fanatics and reaching possessively for Harry’s hand. “Aren’t they supposed to limit your metabolism though?”
“I just can’t believe that the two men I had fallen for had both been you.” Harry remarked a short while later, ice cream sticky in their hands.
“They might have done at first, but now they’re used to him on Diagon. I wouldn’t be worried.” Blaise assured them with a nonchalant air.
Harry warily clasped his hand in the smooth and soft palm of his once enemy’s. He admired the bravery it had clearly taken, and he had to remind himself of his fixation with SN7 when the pulse of attraction thudded in his throat.
“It’s part of the charm.” He winked. “Anyway, I’m still not sure how well he can read so you should be fine.”
“I can’t believe you!” Harry snarled as he gripped the blonde’s arm forcefully and pulled him to a secluded corner.
“Yes well, sorry to disappoint, but I best be getting back to my date. I have been tasked with bringing her some water and I cannot fail my gentlemanly duty.” Draco smirked, unwilling to consider any deeper on why Potter’s appearance had discomforted him so much. He had just felt the urge to retreat back to Astoria where it was safe, rather than linger near those magnificently bright eyes.
Just the start of this chapter. I can see this fic taking a while but I’ll get there!
Impatient to hear more, Draco snapped. “So, is he passable?”
Humming to himself, he got to work with arranging his newest stock. Though he’d never been artistic, he couldn’t help but be proud of his displays, he’d tried to bring magic to the presentation of his goods. In the middle of the store was a golden chandelier of snitches fluttering in an orbital motion; a shelf to the left advertised the latest quidditch leathers upon wax models of upcoming sport-stars. It was chaotic, beautiful and full of life.
Detective Parker used the standard spell for identification with his own wand before nodding. “Okay. You guys seem above board. The wands match the ones we have on record for Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.” He opened the doors grandly and said. “You guys can come on in to the briefing room.”
“I’ll help you get dressed Potter, need to have you looking your best after all.” Harry flushed as Draco stepped closer to him, lithe fingers peeling at the buttons of the checkered shirt he’d clearly unwisely chosen to wear.
“Yes I do, and I can’t promise anything.” A mischievous smile played on his lips.
Another twenty minutes had passed and Harry couldn’t help regretting his decision to not use polyjuice. Perhaps SN7 had come and seen him, and simply had walked away when he’d seen ‘the boy who lived’? Not a lot of people would want to handle that pressure, Harry surmised. But he had wanted to start this off honestly, he couldn’t imagine the uproar that would have surely occurred if he’d revealed it later on. No he didn’t need that.
“I just know him. He’s smart, funny, very snarky actually. But at the same time, he’s got a hidden soft side and he just gets me.”
“Shut up Blaise.” Draco smiled before a frown settled over his features. “I really hope we click in person too.”
“Why ever not?” Shock plastered her carefully sculptured face.
“I have no idea why you’re here, so no. I don’t think so.” Harry snapped beginning to turn so he could close the door in the smug face. Sadly, he heard the blonde’s protests before he could shut it fully.
GoodFaith Corporation really bad?
Shocked, Harry replied. “What do you mean? The war has been over years and it’s hardly like Malfoy and I are school rivals anymore.”
“I really hope so Potter. I really hope so.”
“I can’t do it Harry. It refuses every known law of physics: muggle and magical.” She scowled at his offending scalp before shrugging and resuming the styling on her own hair. Harry surveyed himself in the mirror, he didn’t think he looked half bad really; he’d given up a long time ago on his hair, much to Ginny’s dismay. The forest green plaid shirt with his latest grey jeans suited him perfectly, Harry thought his appearance could be worse.
“You refused to shake my hand in first year.” Draco aid glibly.
“You’re pretty awesome yourself too dude.”
“Not that it’s any business of yours Malfoy, but I’m waiting for a friend I’m not sure if you’ve heard of those.” Harry replied tartly, horrified when Malfoy took this as an invitation to sit down.
“I don’t know Draco, it could be a set up. Where she’s secretly wanting us to not go and if I accept she’ll use it against me. You know what Slytherin girls are like.” Blaise sighed dramatically. “Speaking of; how did the break up go between you and Astoria?”
“I do? Um, yeah you’re right Malfoy. I guess I best be going to rescue that family from Luna.” Harry stirred, feeling like the blonde had abruptly shut down what had been a surprisingly pleasant conversation.
“Vélocipède?” Harry had to frown, not having a clue about what Malfoy had said.
“No! Of course not. I’m attached to Astoria as you know.” Draco sniffed dramatically, “I have a PenPal, a guy. He’s just pretty interesting tis all.”
“It won’t. I have a plan.” Draco smiled with more confidence than he actually felt.
“I thought I was?”
Harry shuddered at the thought, but it was highly unlikely it was Goyle of all people. The silence drew on and a pregnant pause proceeded Malfoy in taking a deep breath.
“Plus I’ve got a clean bill of health.” Kenny produced medical paperwork from his parka pocket, proclaiming all his negative test results from sexually transmitted diseases.
Harry froze in disbelief. “How did you know?”
The dark haired man had to suppress a smirk when he heard the indignant squawk. Seemed Malfoy had heard him after all. They could not arrive in South Park soon enough.
“What about if he’s so fat he can’t walk?” Draco probed with clear vindictive pleasure.
Loading, as always, took a while before the WOL server materialised and he saw that he had Owl-Mail as the icon indicated. He held his breath as he tapped his wand to determine whether it was from his PenPal. Exhilaration sprung through him when he realised it was indeed from SN7.
“Babe! What’s up?” Craig’s tone had completely softened as he slipped the blonde’s much needed drink into his trembling hands.
the fact that he’d got his driving licence and truck first, Randy had bought him it as a bribery present, and could ferry the two of them around. Kyle had to admit he loved the freedom the two could enjoy, getting away from the town for the weekend was a godsend when they weren’t swamped in homework.
“It’s not a death contraption Malfoy. I know perfectly well how to drive I’ll have you know.” Harry retorted, though he could see why the blonde pure blood might have some nerves.
Both men knew that when Kingsley started using their professional names, they had to get with the program and just agree to whatever said, albeit unhappily.
“It’s looking well. Be ready to open in a week or two. Must say the house-elves have worked wonders on the place.”
“What?! In love? No way.. I mean, I guess I love Astoria.” Draco stuttered somewhat comically.
Draco winced, the place he’d spent while waiting for trial still haunted him. “Don’t you dare talk about that place.”
“I know my duty. I just want more than a loveless match.” Draco spoke uncharacteristically truthful to his father who raised his eyebrows in surprise. His son had grown bolder after the ending of the war, but still tended to defer to their wishes.
The time for the date was nearly upon him and he made sure he was looking his upmost best with his dove grey suit and white linen shirt. Blonde hair coiffed stylishly, a small spritz of his favourite potion aftershave and he was ready to go.
A coy smile graced her lips, “Oh Draco, I can start making it up for you now.” She laughed as she pulled him from their balcony table, nearly spilling the remaining wine in his glass.
“Thanks.” Kyle drily intoned before adding. “You know what isn’t awesome? The fact that you have to find a parking spot and I’ve got a chemistry lab in like twenty minutes.”
“What’s with all these people?” Kyle wondered aloud. Usually the school parking lot wasn’t this rammed, most students still opted to get the faithful yellow bus.
“I know Astoria, what can I say? I just can’t take pleasure in his downfall.” Draco explained as he put away the items from the shopping bags she had purchased. The statute of secrecy had prevented any lightening charms so his arms still ached from the loading of clothes.
Harry’s feet were aching as he served yet another demanding customer. The frizzy haired woman that spoke to him did not seem to realise or care about the grumbling queue behind her. He smiled patiently as he signalled for Luna to come over and engage the chatty woman in a nonsensical conversation whilst he helped others. It sometimes seemed that Luna’s greatest strength laid in her patience to converse with the even most verbose of people; a trait Harry didn’t have.
The resurrection process was as disorienting as ever when Kenny, yet again, found himself suddenly brought back to life and laying on his crappy, worn mattress. This death hadn’t been too drawn out  at least, he’d inevitably ended up getting caught in the crossfire when Dolly Parton had pulled out her shotgun, firing off rounds at Paris like she was throwing confetti at a newlywed. The blonde sighed, he just didn’t understand why he was still caught in this immortality death loop. If he was meant to die, then it could at least just be over with.
Draco smirked. “Oh I know, but I wasn’t going to complain.”
Harry, who’d already answered this question with a resounding
Draco ordered two tumblers at the bar and slid them onto their shared table. Blaise grinned his thanks and downed it in one go.
“Not that Harry, I thought you knew..” She wasn’t sure whether she should continue if he were truly ignorant.
“Well, well. It would seem that despite how scandalous our image is, people still want to buy the cheaper alternative when it comes to goods.” Lucius smirked, pleased with the news.
Harry accepted her hug and quick peck on the cheek in farewell, the lingering perfume making him sneeze. A few minutes after the front door had shut, Harry cautiously inched his way to the window. Upon seeing her sporty ponytail bounce with her spirited gait at the far side of the street, Harry bounded over to where he’d placed his W-Book the night before.
The doorbell chimed the entrance of his employees (and friends), and Harry greeted them with a cheerful morning, almost missing the concern that marred the usually upbeat Hannah Abbot as she trusted in after the others.
“A guy? How scandalous! I didn’t know you had it in you.” Blaise looked positively delighted and Draco flushed.
Harry grinned at the antics of his godson. Teddy had woken Draco and himself up very early in his excitement to open his Christmas presents. Bouncing on their bed, he’d raced around the master bedroom whooping with joy as he sang “God rest ye merry hypogriff,” at the top of his lungs.
It was this desperation that forced Harry to summon his courage and reply to SN7, he needed his advice. The man had shown he was as wily as any businessman, perhaps he could help him? Thus he wrote his response to the long neglected invitation.
Harry closed his W-book in surprise, his heart thudding painfully.
“Hmmm yeah, probably be back around 7, if you want to cook for then?” She answered absently as she stood up.
Teddy, whilst adorable, was often far too excitable. His hair would flit rapidly through the colours of the rainbow, eager to hold the attention of the older blonde. He beamed emphatically when it was decided that Draco would take Teddy to Diagon Alley for light shopping and some ice cream. It was, unbeknownst to the youngster, a ploy to get him out of the house so that the women could have their tête-à-tête undisturbed.
Since the opening of Quidditch Direct, the store’s profits had been dwindling till only a loss was being made. The publicity from the articles had done barely anything to stem the lack of customers. Interest had piqued, but people still seemed to flock to the chain stores as Harry had feared. If things didn’t change imminently, Harry would have to close the store for good; he might be independently wealthy but to maintain a profitless store would impact even his fortunes. He owed it to his employees to let them know before he had to close the store for good.
Though this stranger seemed to be a bit of a bumbling fool and perhaps a closet Hufflepuff, Draco thanked Merlin that he’d discovered the man on WOL. He’d only bought the W-Book at Astoria’s behest, it was apparently the ‘in’ thing to mix magic with muggle and Draco had nothing against boosting his reputation with the masses. Sceptical at first, especially with the incessant wand tapping, now Draco’s favourite part of the day was the time he got to speak to Quidditchboy via Owl-Mail.
Surveying his store with pride, he couldn’t help but be pleased at the enormous change it had gone through in the aftermath of the war and in his hands. Initially, Harry had begun Auror training after the final battle had concluded, but his heart was no longer in it. Still plodding along through his training, he’d taken a stroll through Diagon during one of his lunch breaks. His eyes had been drawn to the still boarded up windows and the sign on the door that had announced it was for sale due to the owner moving abroad. Money and paperwork had exchanged hands shortly thereafter (much to Hermione’s disapproval at his reckless spontaneity) and Harry had quickly built it up to the success that stood before him today.
“Yes well, we knew backlash would come one day.” Draco sniffed imperiously, “How’s the store doing with all this press?”
“Why are you here?” Potter asked as he took a seat in his large armchair, taking a swig from a mug emblazoned with ‘Hapless Hero’. Draco presumed it was a gift from the Weasleys.
“Right… so I see a very fit guy over there… wait no hankie… what about him? Nope… no hankie. Oh wait, I see a blue handkerchief… hold on.. the waitress is moving out of the way. I see him..” Blaise trailed off in shock as he realised that the signature item belonged to the one and only boy wonder.
Knowing that he had to speak, if only to ease the pain in the blonde’s eyes, Harry summoned his courage.
Draco was unsure how to combine the duality of Quidditchboy and Potter. One was a dear friend that he’d grown to respect and admire, Potter was well, Potter. It was hard to understand how the two could be one and the same. Though looking back through their previous history, it seemed obvious to him. Wading through a water fountain to rescue kids was such a Potter thing to do. The connection had been there all along, and Draco just didn’t know how to feel about it. He resolved to carry on as things were, talking to Quidditchboy in the same way as before, delusion had always been one of his favourite vices after all.
All three boys nodded in agreement with Craig’s explanation. The fact that it was South Park made it so everything made sense.
“I’ve no idea dude.” Stan answered after he finally squeezed his truck into a spot next to the grass verge. Technically, he shouldn’t have parked there, but on the other hand, he just didn’t care. “Shall we find out?”
“You sound like one of those fuddy duddy people that moan about the Weird Sisters being too edgy or something.” He sniffed, glaring at his companion.
Draco muttered something that could have sounded like
“Don’t be rude Malfoy.” Harry hushed his partner, he’d noticed the official that had come out to greet them and worried that Malfoy would offend their hosts if he carried on. “Besides, they probably don’t want to attract Muggles.”
Blaise smirked as he realised that his blonde friend was in a world of his own, humming with contentment in a manner almost unheard of for a Malfoy. “Is my little Draco finally in love?” He teased, amused by the shock splashed across his face.
“Well, he’s certainly your type..” Blaise edged with a building amusement.
“Don’t be silly Harry.” Ginny chided gently with an eye roll. “You’ll be fine, I’ll protect you from your fans! Plus you know you’ve been wanting to see Teddy, he’d be gutted if you didn’t show.”
“So, you been seeing anyone since the Weaselette?” Draco asked with faux casualness on one of the occasions, causing Harry to cough in surprise.
The short walk to Quality Quidditch Supplies was filled with rumination; Harry wondered whether he should ask George if his team could come up with a firebolt inspired sweet for the latest model unveiling in October, he deliberated on whether he should let Luna have another crack at designing a display after he’d had to remove her last one for the broomstick polish (there had been one too many complaints by concerned parents). The consideration was cut short by his arrival and subsequent need of concentration to access the wards to the shop. They recognised him easily as the owner and the shutters slowly started to rise.
The tumultuous feelings that swirled in Harry’s stomach made his heart race and throat dry while he read the letter. He liked SN7, a lot. But how could he like him that much but also want to spend so much time with Draco? It made no sense and Harry felt conflicted. Still, he eagerly replied to the missive with a happy hum of contentment.
“Well, she also looked very, very disappointed with me too?” Harry protested with vehement laughter.
“Perfectly. You look great. This guy is so lucky, he doesn’t even know.”
His father strolled from his spot at the fireplace and elegantly took a seat on the sofa. It was clear he enjoyed the suspense by the small smirk that graced his lips. “No. The Greengrass family whilst wealthy are not part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.” He took a large sip of his drink before continuing. “I’d recommend finding a suitable bride soon though Draco. Your mother wants a grandchild and I need a heir.”
The redhead rolled his eyes anyway, looking out the window at the same sparse landscape on their drive to school. “I’m just so fed up of it all. This town! The people!”
“Ewww like I’d want your disease riddled mouth anywhere near me.” Cartman shuddered dramatically before addressing Butters. “I’d get yourself tested for AIDS if I was you, who knows where the walking STD has been.”
Draco couldn’t hold in the laugh he felt rising at his friend’s paranoia. “Blaise. For salazar’s sake, how could it be a trap? She suggested it as she knows it was our tradition and she knows Theo and I will keep you out of trouble.”
“It’s actually been good Malfoy. Teddy, I’ll come visit you soon alright? Behave for your Grandma and Cousin and I may have to bring you a present.” Harry felt a pang at seeing the duo leave, he told himself that he’d compensate by spending more time with his godson soon.
Andy’s place had quickly warmed up with the sheer amount of body heat it contained and Harry yearned to switch the button up for one of his comfy T-shirts. Still, it had not been too bad thus far, and Ginny was clearly having a great time as she spoke exuberantly with her old Gryffindor chums. Feeling a bit out of his comfort zone, Harry excused himself to the bathroom, if only to gather a little bit of peace.
“Last chance to ditch tonight and go out for curry instead?” Harry half-joked. Though he loved visiting Andromeda, he’d prefer it if there wasn’t the opportunity for sycophants to sequester him, and who knew how many people had received an invite this year?
“You say that at least twice a day.” Kyle smiled, he knew Stan
Draco stood nervously on the step. He’d explained to his aunt, who’d given him Potter’s address, that he wished to make amends. Her eyes had seemed to sparkle as she’d wished him luck and Draco had taken the address slip and fled before he could change his mind.
“..You can’t seriously tell me that your punishment from McGonogall was to take a biscuit?” Malfoy had spluttered in disbelief when Harry found himself regaling tales of his own exploits.
Harry spoke woodenly. “No, on WOL it just says GoodFaith Corporation..”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fine. Why are we even going to
“Your mother is not impressed.” Lucius remarked dryly, stepping into his son’s now mostly empty flat uninvited. Draco snorted. It figured that Astoria would go running to his mother. She’d had one hell of a tantrum when she’d realised Draco would not budge on the matter; she had been decidedly unladylike in her homophobic slurs.
“That you are.” Harry agreed solemnly, before pulling him in for another kiss.
“Nice to know how you feel about me Ky.” Stan huffed exaggeratedly.
“Boys? If I could just interrupt your squabbling.” Kingsley tried not to look amused as he watched their back and forth. “To answer, Malfoy’s question. There have been a lot of strange reports and sightings by the muggles of that area.”
“Now to be fair to Draco, he irks Potter just by living.” Blaise laughed, unfazed as ever.
Harry’s heart was hammering so fast he could barely breathe as he read his latest correspondence. It was time. He replied swiftly with glee, only to be startled by an imperious knock at his door. One that he’d become all too accustomed to. He fought the frisson of excitement that ran through him as he grinned at his expected visitor.
“I knew it. He had to be!” Draco practically crowed with joy, triumphant in that knowledge. Unfortunately Blaise felt duty bound to burst the bubble of delusion, at least so his friend could be prepared.
Struggling to compose himself, he summoned his Malfoy mask before answering coolly, “It’s not like that as you well know, now I think it’s time we visit my father, he’ll want to see how we are getting on.
It seemed to be an almost daily occurrence that Draco dropped by to Harry’s abode and it was becoming increasingly addictive. He would waltz in to the living room, often with a new delight to share with Harry, and make himself at home on the sofa.
? Merlin, what kind of name is that?” Draco just had to add incredulously. It was pretty much a direction and a destination.
“The plan to woo Potter, so that he doesn’t care that you’ve hidden your identity for so long.” Blaise sipped his drink before getting up to check himself out in the large monochrome mirror above Draco’s fireplace.
“No problem Malfoy. I’m always happy to see Ted.” Harry smiled at his godson fondly, the little boy was now happily engaged with licking his ice cream coated lips and scanning avidly about the store.
“I’m actually surprised Potter’s holy mission to berate me hasn’t had an effect on our profit.” Draco remarked idly as he sipped his drink smoothly.
“You’re so sweet Ken.” Butters smiled, genuinely happy for the first time that day. He had been feeling out of sorts till his friend arrived. He didn’t deserve someone as lovely as Kenny looking out for him, but he wasn’t about to complain.
Mass made and Malfoy: How ex-death eaters have managed to make money from you
“Well it makes sense to be. It could be anyone.” A mischievous smile played on Draco’s face as he added wryly. “It could be Goyle.”
Draco scoffed. “I did not use Teddy, I assure you. I have no need to spy on your little store Potter.”
“There’s just Quality Quidditch Supplies at the North Side of Diagon.” Draco shrugged.
“Shut up Cartman, you’re just jealous that I won’t suck your dick.” Kenny rolled his eyes, smirking at the brunette boy next to him.
“For Merlin’s sake Potter, why are we riding in that death contraption?” Draco gasped horrified at the black jeep in front of him. They had just gone through the check in procedure at the International PortKey Bureau- Colorado Division and had been taken to their assigned vehicle.
“Sorry for the intrusion Potter, Teddy here was adamant about seeing his ‘Uncle Harry’” Draco began as he ruffled the blonde hair of his smaller counterpart.
“Good. You got to admit. It wasn’t very fair.”
“Oh, it’s a guy. Yes I’d forgotten about your whole coming out party a few years ago..” He smirked knowingly.
Harry sat snugly in his cotton striped pyjamas under the weight of a particularly fluffy duvet, content in the knowledge that he had no work to go to today. Not that he didn’t love his job, he did in fact, but facing the crisp autumn air was not as appealing as his warm cocoon and the chance to use the WWWW, World-Wide-Wizarding-Web, undisturbed.
“Yes.. The Committee for Restoration And Peace were all for serving the breakfast mojitos in glasses made from this muggle material ‘plastic’ as it’s supposedly unbreakable.” Astoria grimaced while she waited for Draco to act suitably horrified.
“Gin, you know that place is like my home. I couldn’t imagine working anywhere else.” Frustration coloured his words as he tried to explain the deeper connection the role held for him.
“Are you sure that wasn’t her normal face? I swear she never once smiled! Merlin I was terrified of her.” Draco confided, a beatific smile emblazoned on his face.
“He’s nothing to me.” Draco shrugged, leaving Blaise to follow him in awkward silence as they strode steadily away from the shop.
Harry groaned. Yet another person had come through the door that was not SN7. But this time it was worse. Much worse. The bane of Harry’s existence (now that good old Voldy was dead) had arrived, bizarrely as this was a muggle establishment, and everyone knew that Draco Malfoy did not interact well with those. Wanting to avoid a confrontation, and possible a violation of the statute of secrecy, Harry turned in his seat so that he was slightly out of view.
If Malfoys were able to sweat, Draco would be dripping profusely. He was nervous. What’s if Potter hated him for lying to him? What’s if he didn’t want Draco at all and was expecting a wholesome do-gooder to be his PenPal?
“I don’t know father. Surely it’s not hard to find someone that truly understands you and inspires you to be a better person? Someone who’d risk their life for yours and you’d do the same?”
“Well I’m glad you find it funny Astoria. Father’s going to be furious. Of course this is all Potter’s doing.” Draco spoke poisonously.
Draco startled, then smoothed out his expression as he accepted his drink from the same house-elf. “Potter? A shopkeeper? I’d love to see that.”
“It’s only a store Harry. Honestly, just get another job when you feel like it. You don’t need the money.” Ginny had said through the fireplace when he’d called her with the news that had weighed heavily on his mind.
Draco gestured for Harry to watch as he waved his wand with a flourish, using a swift augmenti for the water. A charm encouraged the tea set to begin brewing and Draco carefully opened the first of the packets.
His father frowned in puzzlement. “How decidedly un-Slytherin. I doubt there’s many that would risk themselves for someone not of blood.”
Harry could not fathom speech with the captivating individual in front of him.
The following few days saw Harry waking up with a smile on his face and a spring in his step. He told himself that it was coincidence that this buoyant mood occurred at the same moment he’d become friends with Draco, but he wasn’t sure if he even believed his own lie. He’d been so busy, he’d not had much chance to look on his w-book which he now did with guilt and anticipation.
“That’s what a ward is for. Honestly Potter.” Draco rolled his eyes before plastering an obsequious smile on his face as the domineering man strolled forward to greet them.
“Wait! Have a look for me! Tell me if he’s good looking?” Draco pleaded. Blaise rolled his eyes but dutifully peered through the window, searching for the blue handkerchief.
“Money is money, no matter the name attached.” Draco chipped in, his headache clearing a little.
“Don’t be silly dear, it’s been years, I’m sure everyone is over that.” She said glibly. “Now, what shall I wear? I need to make a good impression.”
In just a short few days later, Draco had the beginnings of a migraine. The opening of the store had been a roaring success; he had witnessed the event under the guise of polyjuice. It would hardly help the company if their customers realised that the Malfoys were the owners. It was far better for Draco and his father to take a step back and enjoy the success from the anonymity of their GoodFaith Corporation.
“Did you say Quidditch Direct uncle Harry? Cousin Draco..” Teddy began, eager to join in the adult conversation.
Draco stepped into the cosy abode, seeing the warm grey cushions and fluffy white blanket spread upon the cream sofa and he smiled. The place oozed comfort and was quintessentially Potter.
Harry rolled his eyes. The Malfoy’s, while paying a sizeable sum in reparations at the end of the war, were still filfthy rich. Yet, Malfoy always demanded a decent chunk of the department’s budget to be spent on his wardrobe to blend in with those
“I best be going Potter, you’ve things to do after all.” Harry watched sadly as Draco left the room. He shook himself, he did have a date to prepare for after all.
“So, I told you about that guy I’ve been talking to, right?” He began cautiously as Blaise perked up in interest. He’d not heard Draco speak about anything personal since Hogwarts, so he urged him on. Taking the cue. “Well, I’ve suggested meeting up with him, and he’s agreed.”
Ginny gave him a look that he returned with a ‘help me’ expression. For once, she acquiesced and feigning a yawn she replied. “Yes I suppose it’s getting late. Need my rest during quidditch season.”
“Uncle Harry! Uncle Harry! Guess what? Cousin Draco bought me my new favourite ice cream blueberry muffin. Want to try some?” His godson Teddy bounced in glee and Harry struggled to keep the proffered ice cream spilling on himself or his stock.
“Of course I do you prat.” Draco sighed.
A response came immediately in the form of a popup chart to his WOL account. Harry startled, his pulse fluttering.
“Good, since I’m giving you a ride and all.” Stan winked, oblivious as ever as he returned his gaze to the road.
“Dude. There’s no need to be an ass. We were just wondering what was going on.” Stan tried to appease his lookalike and long time rival.
“So.. you’ve decided to go on a date with your PenPal Potter?” Draco arched his eyebrow inquisitively in response to Harry’s admittance.
“Seems you irked Potter, my son.” Lucius mused as he placed down a fresh copy of the Daily Prophet, complete with new scathing headlines about him and his store.
“Ugh! You guys are too gross, could you be sucking his dick any harder? I might actually vomit.” Cartman fake wretched and both blondes were startled by his presence, they had completely forgotten his existence.
“Honestly, you’re so uncultured Potter. It’s a bicycle, a mode of transport that became popular in the eighteen hundreds.”
“It’s so unlike you. Still I’m glad all this Potter nonsense is over. We can focus more on other things; like me. And you. Your mother says we can use your villa in Tuscany for the honeymoon..”
“Oh that. It’s going swimmingly. All I need to do is make Potter find me irresistible as both identities. That way I’ll win whichever one he picks.”
“It’s Granger-Weasley actually, and you know ‘Mione wouldn’t do that. Now are you going to get in or what?” Harry sighed. He’d resolved to keep a check on his temper for the duration of this little excursion but Malfoy somehow managed to get under his skin.
“You guess you love Astoria? That’s red hot passion, if I’ve ever heard it my friend.” Blaise chuckled to himself, “So if there’s no imminent wedding bells, what’s got you in such a good mood?”
Stan swore when he noticed that his friend had a point. The parking lot was rammed, some jerk had taken his usual place, and it was 8:37am according to the dashboard clock. Great.
“Um no thank you Teddy,” he gently nudged the ice cream away from where it loomed towards his face. Suddenly Harry seemed to notice the blonde hair that the youngster currently sported and recalled his earlier comment. “Wait, did you say your cousin Draco bought you it? Do you mean Malfoy?”
“Draco, you are aware that your mother and I didn’t marry for love?” At this he nodded solemnly. “It did however, grow into respect and admiration. That’s all anyone can reasonably expect from marriage. None of these foolish notions of soulmates and unyielding passion.”
“What do you mean?” Harry frowned, puzzled that he couldn’t recall a sign posted on his commute.
It was only a few short weeks after Christmas had been and gone that Harry had reluctantly made the decision to close the store for good. The notice sign was put up, to the dismay of his loyal customers and a final farewell sale was scheduled to clear the rest of his stock. Upon hearing the news, Lucius had smugly summoned his son to celebrate. Draco’s heart hadn’t been in it though. He now knew how much the store meant to Potter and he felt it impossible to gloat in triumph at the other’s misfortune.
“You’re right.” Astoria’s face lit up temporarily before falling as he continued. “But I think there’s someone that I could fall for.”
Still, Harry had not survived a war and defeated the darkest wizard of all time by being a quitter. With his plucky attitude restored, Harry set out on his daily excursion to his beloved shop, a determined spring to his step. He was anxious to get in and ensure his stock were in order, this Saturday was usually the busiest of the year. Parents of students at Hogwarts were sure to have received notice of their child making the school team and so would be eager to reward their offspring with the latest models. Harry loved this, reminiscing over the joy he’d felt when he’d received his own Nimbus2000, he couldn’t help the warm feeling he got by being a part of that.
Recovering himself with a sip of his jasmine infused green tea, Harry replied. “No… well I mean, not really but kind of sort of.”
The sweet blonde’s joyful expression darkened considerably, and he replied somewhat tonelessly. “Oh.. well you see.. my dad was awful sore about something I’d done yesterday… I can’t actually remember what..” Butters shook his head forcefully at that, expelling unpleasant memories. “So I thought it best to get the bus and not go bothering him for a lift.”
He watched with guarded amusement as Potter pathetically attempted to conceal himself. It had been an arduous decision to return, he’d riled against himself every step of the way, but at the same time he just couldn’t help himself. He was curious. How could Potter be the perpetually engaging Quidditchboy? The blasted boy-who-lived was barely coherent, not like his charming PenPal. So he’d returned, sans blue handkerchief of course, against his better judgement.
Harry felt a strange urge to comfort his former nemesis and offered up his hand to be shook. “We’re friends now though.”
Kingsley sighed. “Look. I don’t really want to send you myself. But MACUSA requested we send Harry Potter. He’s kind of got a reputation of getting things done. Even of there.”
It was unseasonably warm when Harry headed out towards the park at the arranged time. Heart beating faster with every step until he finally reached the sea of green that held his fate. Rounding the trees he saw the Italian bistro and gulped nervously as the sign for the ice cream came in sight and he reached the entrance. He was going in.
In amidst the pandemonium that was the business with his store, it would have been easy to forget his PenPal’s proposal to meet in person. But Harry didn’t. Harry couldn’t, the anticipation to meet this man consumed him. He couldn’t help but wonder what he would be like; Harry suspected he’d be coolly attractive, perhaps elegant? He certainly wrote that way.
“And? You think I love you? Don’t be daft Draco. Love is for Hufflepuffs and sentimental Gryffindors. We have something much more valuable. We have a shared sense of duty, familial expectations and pedigree background.” She shrugged practically as though this was a given.
This did make Draco smile as he was reminded about the story his hapless PenPal had told him, about how he had tried to stop his godchildren from wreaking havoc and had ended up being soaked from the waist down after wading through a wishing fountain to rescue/coral the imps. He’d apparently had a meeting with a client shortly thereafter and had seemingly forgotten the existence of drying charms as he wrote about anxiously trying to dry off with paper towels and napkins.
Harry closed his eyes and rubbed tiredly at his forehead. So, he had to fight dirty? He could do that. Especially if it meant saving his store. Besides, he already had his first idea.
“Thanks.” Malfoy surprised himself with the words of gratitude that slipped from his tongue. He wasn’t used to being nice, to Potter of all people.
His fingers itched to grab his W-book as Astoria continued her list of minor grievances, he’d not checked to see if he’d any messages as yet today, though he’d thought that he’d better not whilst she was with him. There was something about his correspondence that he wished to keep separate from her. Resolving to check later after she’d gone to sleep, he somewhat succeeded in pushing his PenPal from his mind and renewed his focus on his admittedly attractive companion.
“And are you wearing that?” Draco quipped with a sardonic grin.
“Hmmph. Fine. I suppose if I must.” Draco declared magnanimously before adding. “I trust that my expenses will be taken care of?”
Harry blinked owlishly, too struck by the sight of Malfoy in tight jeans and a pale blue button down to realise what he’d been accepting. Awareness of the fact that he’d been staring materialised and he flushed.
Draco had reluctantly followed his charge through the door and had been watching the encounter with barely concealed humour. His eyes swiftly appraised Potter’s physique, it had filled out in the years since the war and the toned frame clearly suited him. The easy grin and fondness contained in the man’s expression charmed Draco and he found himself relishing the opportunity to observe this carefree encounter.
“Nothing better to do? No friends of your own to annoy?” Harry fumed, temper rising. “Oh yes, they’re all in askaban aren’t they?”
“Andy, what do you mean?” He asked earnestly, a dark sense of foreboding welling up within him.
“Ooh, another woman?”
Draco couldn’t help but smile at his PenPal’s latest missive. The new store on Diagon was opening the day after tomorrow and the hectic schedule had impeded him from checking his WOL account. He could one hundred percent understand the plight of the other man; he too had experienced the heart-wrenching nausea that came from an insurmountable threat to one’s way of life. Sometimes he wished that they could reveal themselves to one another, but he was afraid that his friend would hold his defamed identity in contempt.
Harry had eagerly clicked on the message from his PenPal, expecting all sorts of excuses and reasons why he’d not shown. Instead, the man had surprised him an uncharacteristic openness filled with raw honesty. Though still hurt, Harry had decided to accept the apology, even if he was wary of suggesting or arranging a meeting anytime soon. Perhaps they would forever only communicate online.
“They sound pretty good.” Harry tried his best to be appeasing, but he could already tell this guy was pretty pompous. He kind of wondered why Draco wasn’t speaking up yet. When he turned to the blonde, he saw that the man was just standing in sullen silence, taking it all in. Must be a Slytherin trait, Harry surmised.
Which was why when Stan, the loveable goofball that he was, greeted him with a cheerful, “Some day we had yesterday!” All Kyle could do was scowl and get into Stan’s pick up truck with a slam.
Draco’s hand felt smooth in his and they fulfilled their long awaited handshake, over a decade past due.
The blonde smirked before adding a suave wink. “You just never know when you’re going to need it.”
Kingsley shot him a look that said to Harry he wasn’t being helpful. “We can discuss suitable attire during the full briefing.” He needed to urge them along, those two could argue for days if left unchallenged.
“Yup. In like a weeks time.” Harry nodded, “I’m pretty nervous to be honest with you.”
“Quiet? Sure I can see that.” Draco jibed sarcastically, placing a teasing smirk upon his face as he observed the melee of the shop. It was clear that business was booming, a hum of customers made their way steadily through the merchandise, aided by the helpful (and mostly Gryffindor) staff members.
The atmosphere felt charged as Draco’s silver met the emerald green of Harry’s eyes. It seemed to Harry that Draco yearned to say something else, but then thought better of it.
“It’s a trap, obviously.” Blaise responded with confidence. “Any Slytherin worth their salt could see that.”
“Trust me. I’m not.” Harry muttered darkly thinking about W.A.P amongst other songs. A part of him wanted to put it on, see the pureblood’s reaction to the lyrics, but he mostly didn’t want to listen to it himself, so he refrained.
Kingsley just shook his head in reprimand. “Contrary to what you might think Auror Potter, you aren’t invincible. You need a partner and this could be the opportunity needed for you and Auror Malfoy to get along.”
When he’d spoken to Ginny in the hope of alleviating his anxiety, she’d been too busy to offer much support but had assured him that the store would be fine, after all it was as popular as ever. This didn’t assuage all his concerns however and he’d taken to the WWWW to find out information on the company. Though he’d spent a good few hours on his W-book, the only thing he could see was that the owners were the elusive GoodFaith Corporation, the names of individual employees could not be found no matter how hard he tried.
“Not unless you want to stick out like a mandrake in a library.” Kingsley warned with a grin on his face. He didn’t really have anything against the youngest Malfoy, he’d more than paid for any transgressions he may have made in his youth. But it was still fun to mess with the stuffy pure blood.
“You needn’t be so rude Potter.” Malfoy merely sniffed and took an unsteady step into the passenger side.
The enthusiasm with which Harry consumed the letter surprised him; he felt a shocking resonance with his PenPal’s predicament. More and more lately, Harry had been feeling like his relationship with Ginny was just not working out, but he was terrified of the Weasleys’ reactions, particularly Molly’s. He knew she’d been planning their wedding for a very long time, even though he’d yet to show any sign of proposal. In the very deepest corners of his mind he knew, he knew that their breakup was inevitable. He’d just not even had the chance to see her in a good long while. It was not the sort of thing that you’d do over floo or w-mail after all.
And it was. He knew if Stan wanted him to stay in this dreary town full of fucked up things, that he would. In an instance. He was that far gone on his super best friend, and there was no way in hell he would risk their friendship on the off chance he felt the same way.
“I don’t know.” Harry replied, not sure how to deal with the fluttering of his pulse and the desertion of his famed courage.
“Why are we listening to this muggle garbage?” Draco whined for the thousandth time on the trip from Denver to South Park. The blonde was sitting ram rod straight as Harry drove, hiding how terrified he was by maintaining perfect posture.
Harry had puzzled over his reply for a good hour and half before eventually accepting the invitation out of curiosity. Whilst undeniably true that he didn’t have a clue where to start when making the tea, Harry also didn’t fully trust Malfoy with this overture and would feel infinitely more comfortable if he knew that the tea wasn’t laced with poison or something.
“Hmm, speaking of. You still speaking to that PenPal AKA Potter?” Blaise smirked with a knowing eyebrow arch. The blonde had always been obsessed with the Gryffindor from the second they had met.
He ruminated on her words a little longer before nodding. “I suppose you’re right. He’s only done this as he’s scared for his shop. If only this doesn’t hurt sales, otherwise father will be on his way to Azkaban for doing what the dark lord couldn’t -killing the chosen git.”
“Yes… hold on Astoria I’ll get us some more drinks.” Draco guided her towards a seat, deciding that she could use some more water. If only to prevent a catastrophe.
“Fancy seeing you here Malfoy,” Harry was gratified to see the blonde jump a little in surprise.
Thinking about seeing his PenPal in person left Harry with an unsettling case of butterflies in his abdomen. He hadn’t replied to the man yet, too scared to accept but also not wanting to decline. For now, Harry put it out of his mind. He was glad Hermione didn’t know about it, too busy with the brutal combination of motherhood and ministry work to pay him too much mind, otherwise she’d never had let him hear the end of it. Hermione had made her feelings of procrastination quite clear when he’d avoided the golden egg challenge in fourth year, and he was in no mood for more scolding.
“I brought you these.” Malfoy thrust an exorbitant bouquet of white lilies into Harry’s hands in greeting as soon as the door opened.
“What?!” Outraged, Draco stormed past the man and glared into the window. Potter? Of all the low, underhanded schemes, the saviour had tried to humiliate him with this? Pretending to be an interesting funny guy? Loathsome! Well Draco would no longer be his fool.
“Oh don’t worry Potter. In private we got our lambasting. He might have seemed to have favourites but any infraction was severely met. He just didn’t broadcast it.” Draco shuddered at the memory of the tongue lashing he’d received first year after being caught out past curfew.
Still, life for Draco plodded on like it always had; checking in at their stores across the country, compiling data reports with Blaise for his father whilst drinking, spending time with his extended family after enquiring if Potter would make it to the festivities or not. He’d still been avoiding the man after their blow out in the café and whilst he still spoke almost daily with Quidditchboy he had yet to internalise the two as being one and the same. Though he couldn’t help but feel sorry for his friend when the announcement came.
Harry watched her as she strode across their carpeted bedroom purposefully. Her athletic body displayed alluringly in a mid thigh black dress. Long and slim legs showcased by her towering heels that made it so she reached near to his height. Grabbing her purse, she indicated to Harry that it was time for them to go, looping her arm through his as they stepped into the fireplace.
A waiter cut off any response that Harry might have made snidely by coming over to their now shared table and taking Draco’s order. He proceeded to order himself a pot of tea, ignoring Harry’s vehement protests that he was not sitting there.
“I don’t know. You Slytherins seemed pretty chill with him.” Harry laughed, happy for the resumption of the conversation.
Startled from his reverie by the placing of a mug of steaming tea on his side table, Harry flashed Ginny a grateful smile. She did not acknowledge his thanks, too busy in getting ready for her training practice, to pay him any mind. The Harpies had been running her ragged this season thus far, and it was not unusual for Harry to be woken by his girlfriend slamming dresser drawers in her haste to get ready on bitter mornings.
“What? No Prada? No Armani?!” Draco would never admit how high pitched his shriek was then.
“I do. Look Malfoy-“ Harry began.
“What are you doing here?” Potter answered, without overt hostility, but not what most would consider polite.
“I will Andy. It’s been lovely, the food has been great.” Harry smiled at the warm woman he had grown to admire greatly.
“Gentlemen, we’ve been expecting you. I’m the lead on the case. Detective Parker.” He nodded, extending his hand in a respectful handshake to both aurors as he led them to the double doors of the entrance. He stopped, scrutinising them.“Before we go in though, I’ll need to see some identification.”
Draco’s heart beat faster at the friendly smile Harry shot him at the compliment. “You’ll make a lucky someone happy one day too.”
Taking a gratifying swig of the caffeinated substance, Tweek calmed down measurably after his fix. At least enough to speak without twitching too much. “I don’t know man, the school is trending on Twitter. Oh god. Do you think the president is tweeting about me again?!”
“Gah. Then why is South Park High trending Craig?” The blonde asked demandingly. He was even more done with this town than Kyle.
“Oh not the newer ones, they fixed the formula after WitchWeekly ran an OpEd on the products.” Astoria replied knowledgeably; “I’m Astoria Greengrass by the way. And of course you’re Ginevra Weasley and Harry Potter.”
“I’m not sure I should say. I guess you deserve to know, particularly if you’re to be friends.” Andy deliberated momentarily before deciding. “Just that the Malfoys are the owners of Quidditch Direct, I assumed you knew they were your competitors.”
“I don’t know Blaise. Men can be pretty petty too. You did know me in Hogwarts after all.” His friend snorted in concurrence, his friend hadn’t taken Potter’s rejection well.
“I’d help him sort out his personal hygiene but I’d still date him.
“I wouldn’t worry guys, we are known for our quality supplies not that cheap knockoff stuff, and there’s enough business for both of us I’m sure.” The staff did not look completely convinced and with good reason, Quidditch Direct had driven other independent stores across the UK to ruin with their chain store discounts that couldn’t be competed with.
“Draco? Of course it’s you.” Harry whispered in disbelief as he took in the man that stood up and offered him a blueberry muffin ice cream.
“Surprised to see you and Draco getting on so well, especially considering everything..” Andy remarked dryly.
“What?!” The look Malfoy gave him was horrified to say the least. Harry just chuckled.
“Erm Malfoy? Why did you get me flowers?” He finally managed as the blonde had already swept by him and was reclining elegantly on his sofa as though he belonged there.
with a protective caress. Kyle didn’t know whether Stan’s tendency to call his vehicles names was adorable or infuriating. It was a little of both.
“You would.” Was all Harry managed in response before Draco resolutely changed the subject for the rest of their afternoon chat.
Harry sat strangely nervous as the hour drew closer to when Draco would arrive. He’d changed out of his outfit a good few times before selecting his first outfit again. Shaking his head, he chided himself, it was only Malfoy after all.
When they had gone, Draco fixed his steely gaze back in Harry’s direction before idly commenting; “So, where is this friend? Are they imaginary?”
“Hmph so you say. I bet Granger confounded the examiner so you got your licence.” It was easy to see that the unimpressed scepticism written on Draco’s face, he had his arms crossed and everything.
In the passing weeks, Christmas loomed imminently and the whole non meet-up had been brushed aside. His work colleagues had been curious how his ‘date’ had gone, outraged on his behalf that he’d been stood up by the cad. Harry had rushed to reassure them, stating that his long distance friend must have had his reasons and that he’d made peace with the fact that his relationship would only be virtual.
He saw Blaise’s eyes widen in shock. “Wow. That’s practically a proposal coming from you. Poor Astoria’s been waiting years to hear that from you. So when’s the meet up with the lucky guy?”
“I think I always sort of knew it was you. At least I hoped so.” Harry shyly looked underneath his eye lashes at the smug prat.
“I’d never forget that.” Kyle muttered under his breath, a shade too loud since Stan managed to hear him and gave a kilowatt smile in return.
“You know, he sort of looks like Potter.. he was always your type. Dark hair, bright eyes..”
“Do you think we might have hit it off Potter? If circumstance had been different?” The blonde stared at him intently, grey eyes molten silver.
“Well, there’s WOL, a place where you can talk to each other.”
Holyhead Harpies Hero Heralds Quality Quidditch Supplies!
The palaver with Potter and the press had caused Draco’s headache to re-emerge. It was now thrumming with vengeance as he and Blaise made their way to his father’s study. The overstuffed office only caused his head to hurt more; too many swirly patterns and bejewelled ornaments were perhaps the cause.
“Well, I’ve not actually met him…” Harry admitted with a blush.
“I don’t see the problem?” Draco remarked as they entered their usual haunts. “How is her agreement of you going on a ‘lads holiday’ a bad thing?” Blaise had been itching to go party in the Mediterranean with the gang from school for a while, it had always been themselves and Theo after the war had ended, living life to the maximum after the gloom that had plagued their childhood. However, in the last two years he’d not been able to, out of deference to Pansy’s wishes and their newly established relationship.
Draco was not having a terrible time at his aunt’s house. The food had been sublime (reminiscent of the feasts they’d been served at Hogwarts), the wine had been plentiful and the other guests had not thrown many dark looks his way. In fact, the majority of the attention came from onlookers startled by Astoria’s rather vociferous laugh. It was clear that she’d had one too many drinks in her endeavour to calm her nerves for the night; her cheeks had an alcohol infused blush and her eyes were darkly dilated.
“The one and only.” Draco winked, “Are you surprised it was me?”
“Not that we know of. We’ve surveyed several focus groups, and feedback is mostly positive.” Blaise grinned as he delivered the news, he certainly had a flair for business.
I think I’ll add more to this chapter.. I’m going to keep flipping between perspectives. I’ll keep updating if people are enjoying it enough.
Harry scowled at the mention of his fame, even at the age of 30, he still was averse to the attention his childhood actions had gained him. Of course it didn’t help that he was a fairly reputable auror too. “Still not sure why Malfoy has to come though.” He muttered under his breath audibly.
“I’m kind of intrigued. How are you planning on making yourself irresistible?” Blaise laughed as he straightened up the few stray strands from his hair.
“Oh don’t worry Potter, I’ll just wait till they get here. Keep you company so no one thinks you’re a lonely loser.” He thanked the waiter who had brought him his order.
Both boys nodded in confirmation. South Park must be an interesting place if they were needed with this much urgency. Throughout the run down of details, Draco still gave him a look that suggested that this was all Harry’s fault. Somehow, Harry couldn’t help but think that maybe it was.
“It says, Quidditch Direct coming soon!” Hannah spoke softly and Harry froze inwardly in horror for five seconds before pasting an optimistic smile on his face as he addressed his team.
Feeling obligated to speak and carry the conversation onwards, Draco searched for a new conversation starter., “I didn’t realise you owned this place Potter till the other day.
“You’re right, but Potter bought it remember? The Prophet had a field day when he dropped out of the Aurors and became a shopkeeper of all things.” Blaise smirked and then took a swig from a proffered tumbler of whiskey.
“Well that went well.” Blaise remarked dryly before they began the spin of apparition to one of their favourite drinking spaces.
“Ah right cool. Well, see you later.” Blaise jauntily waved, ready to make his exit.
Harry woke up refreshed and eager to be back at work. Though he enjoyed having his Monday’s off, it certainly gave him time to finish digesting Molly’s extraordinary Sunday lunch, he adored his shop and the customers that frequented it.
Astoria continued to waffle on about outfits and colour coordination; Draco no longer had the strength to argue with her, not when he’d inevitably give in. Astoria was a force to be reckoned with and she somehow always got her own way. The Hat had placed her well in Slytherin he mused.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Of course we’re not worried. A Gryffindor cannot hope to match our business sense.”
Draco had to grimace at that. “It wasn’t pretty. A lot of name calling and items thrown at my head. Good job I’m handy with a protego.”
“That’s unlikely but I would.”
The tea Draco was offered when Potter returned from his open kitchen was perfect and he sipped gratefully in the silence that threatened to turn awkward.
“Aren’t you going to invite me in?” The blonde smirked and Harry’s face felt mysteriously hot as he saw the once over he was given. Realising his lack of modesty, he blushed further.
Trying to be reasonable, Harry took a deep breath before saying, “Look Malfoy, I don’t know what you’re doing here but can you go? I’m waiting for someone.”
“Draco, Draco? Are you listening to me?” The attractive brunette attempted to regain the blonde’s attention impatiently by clicking her fingers in his direction.
“No problem!” Harry shrugged, typing in the address he’d been given into the Sat Nav before including a cheery. “Let’s hope I remember to drive on the right side of the road.”
For now, Draco had only his vague offers of reassurance to give the man, as he was not yet able to share personally. This would have to be enough.
The teen got up with a grunt, cracking his newly reformed bones. It was unfortunate that having just arisen from the dead didn’t excuse you from school, and so the blonde would have to get a move on if he was going to make it on time.
“I was having a smoke.” The blonde gave a lazy shrug as he hopped up onto the familiar school bus, watching with amusement as Cartman reprised his daily struggle of boarding the vehicle. That guy seriously needed to lose some weight, given that he was having difficulty breathing walking up the very few steps.
In a Wizarding house a fair distance away from Diagon Alley, Draco mustered as much enthusiasm as he possibly could for the imminent outing. It was not that he didn’t care about his cousin Teddy, he did, it was more that he didn’t know how to interact with children.
“How’s the plan going?” Blaise asked as he swept into the room with a languid gait. Draco looked up from his W-book and tried to hide the happiness he felt bubbling from him.
“He uses one of those diluted dreamless sleep if he’s particularly stressed.” Astoria chipped in as she joined Draco’s side, slightly more worse for wear.
“First we wait Potter, for the optimal temperature to be reached.” Harry found himself smiling at Malfoy’a clear enthusiasm and leant in closer subconsciously.
“Yes, you wouldn’t want her telling too many tales of Wrackspurt infestation.” Draco drawled before clasping the hands of the sticky fingered boy. “Come on Teddy, let’s get back home, we’ve disrupted Potter here for far too long.”
If that wasn’t bad enough, Astoria seemed to have become fixated on the idea of their impending engagement. It appeared that a number of women on her committee had recently gotten married or at least engaged, and she wanted in on the action. Their shared home was now littered with bridal magazines stacked on their coffee table, a completely unsubtle approach for a Slytherin, Draco shook his head in disapproval. It wasn’t that he was against marriage, or even his relationship with Astoria; he just wasn’t sure if he wanted them combined.
