“Technically, I do not do dates. But this is not a no. If you really – really want to do this, do it properly. Plan something. Ask me out properly. With picking up and everything. Like a real date. Then I will say yes.”
The sky above them is bright and when Harry looks back, he can see the soft orange tones of a beautiful sunset. Right now everything is just fine. And he is really looking forward for things to come!
Dressed in a dark green leather shirt combined with a light grey button down and very extravagant tights that featured intricate flower designs as well as some gem stones, she very well fitted into the environment. Her longish dark brown hair was half up done in a messy bun, that suited her well. While looking into her green eyes, Harry was not sure if he had seen a piercing in her nose. When he took a second glimpse, it for sure was gone.
Harry had always wondered what exactly had drawn Hermione towards Ron in the first place. But now as they had gotten married shortly before baby Hugo was born (and only because pregnancy hormones had made Hermione finally give in to Ron’s pleading to become his wife she had explained later, dreamingly petting her wedding bouquet) and were still going strong as a couple he started to finally understand. Their whole living room told their story.
Harry took another sip of his ice-cold coffee and blankly stared in front of him. He had already been sitting in the small coffee shop for at least an hour. While the people around him were either engaged in conversations or just simply playing with their phones, he just sat there quietly and stared at the table on the other side of the tiny terrace.
A few minutes later Harry would receive an answer as to where the other man currently was in the form of a selfie in front of a very expensive looking tapestry, a round glass without a stem. His left eyebrow was raised and critically and he was staring into the camera as if he tried to evoke pity while still looking fabulous.
Harry honestly simply did not know what to make of that. In the past he had never received a ‘no’, at least not without an alternative date or activity. Somehow, he had assumed Draco would simply tell him to stop acting weird and simply come over. Which he had not.
“Draco, dear, please hear us out,” Narcissa begged from her spot on the couch, and Draco could swear even through the embers in the fireplace that he saw the same pleading expression in his aunt’s eyes.
“I don’t have room for Draco. He said he’d be perfectly fine sharing the guest room with his mother but honestly, Harry, he’s a boy of eighteen and I’m sure the last thing he wants is to share a tight living space with his mother for the unseeable future. So I was wondering, if it would be at all possible, for him to be able to live with you at Grimmauld? Possibly?”
And if that hadn’t been distracting enough, he had to go ahead and smile, at him, after Draco had  made an attempt at a subtle insult. Harry was becoming more and more insufferable the longer Draco thought about him.
“Draco, please do behave yourself,” his mother pleaded, coming over to him to fiddle with his shirt collar which most certainly didn’t need fiddling, “and please say hello and thank you to Harry for me.”
Draco bit his lip. His culinary skills were very much nonexistent. He’d never had any reason to learn. He didn’t know what “order” meant and was most definitely not going to give Harry the satisfaction of explaining it. As for going out to eat, he’d only have the choice of muggle restaurants as Grimmauld was a decent way away from any wizard establishments, and Draco hadn’t the slightest idea of how those worked and again, wasn’t going to give Harry the satisfaction of explaining. He’d have to ask Harry to cook dinners for him. Or maybe he could just not eat. Yes. Starving sounded a lot nicer than the thought of Harry making dinner just for the two of them. Which Draco would then be expected to join him for. Where they’d eat. Together.
Harry woke up gasping, finding himself shivering despite the warmth of the room. He took a few moments to breath and take in his surroundings.
Draco stood poised by the fireplace, tapping his foot impatiently as the auror assigned to check his luggage sifted through his toiletry bag. Which was taking even longer than the two full cases of clothes. Evidently the man had never seen products that were necessary for proper hair and skincare. The only hair grease he was probably familiar with was the kind that resulted from days without showering, or perhaps what happened when he rubbed his thick hands over his oily mug and into his hair. But Draco bit his tongue, only letting his annoyance show with his foot and some uncontrollable facial tics. The last thing he needed was to be locked up for having a row with an auror over pomade.
Let’s deal with one shocking revelation at a time here, Harry thought as he moved the carefully folded joggers that he found returned to his room to the laundry hamper.
He walked into the kitchen and found two glasses in the cupboard to fill with water. He leaned against the counter and handed one to Harry, who thanked him.
Narcissa smiled at the face of her sister in the fireplace, “you told Harry he said yes already, did you now?”
Anyways, Harry was acting weird and it all started with the piano, so Draco decided to not entertain the idea of playing again while Harry was in the house. He wasn’t sure why there was such an issue around him playing piano (it’s a perfectly dignified hobby) or if the issue was actually even connected to the piano, but he wasn’t about to try and understand the inner workings of Harry’s mind.
Draco huffed and crossed his arms around his chest, “very well, but the answer will remain the same regardless.”
“Is that how you reasoned through this arrangement then?” Malfoy asked, stepping away from his luggage to cross his arms around his chest and survey the place thoughtfully, “I haven’t been here in ages.”
He was in love with Harry Potter and he’d never been more sure of anything in his life than when he’d found himself surrounded by flames only to have those same hands pull him from the heat. He had wrapped himself tight against him, this boy who represented hope and love.
“Well now, I never claimed to be kind, nor would I ever claim to be a peach. I just stated that I wasn’t rude.”
“I could live a lifetime undoing what I’ve done and not deserve him, Luna,” Draco whispered, “I don’t want to want something I could never have.”
Draco nodded, not willing to admit that the flying was actually worth getting up for. His mind was still full of watching Harry flying underneath the sun beaming, laughing as they dived together. It made his chest tight to think he could’ve missed it.
“Please, Potter, I’m not so fragile that I can’t manage to bring luggage up a flight of stairs without help from you.”
“Yes,” Draco replied shortly, agitated at both the stupidity of such a question and the reminder of where exactly he would be going.
SORRY I HAVEN'T UPDATED! I got a job working like 40-60 hours a week and I got a boyfriend (amazing, super cute, love him) but now I'm back at school and surprisingly that means I actually have MORE time to do things XD and I REALLY miss my boy so it'll be nice to have my romantic outlet back again :) Beta read by my lovely skystorm thanks R
At this point, Draco didn’t see the point in even spending his life at all. Quite frankly, he’d like to get rid of it.
Harry had just finished putting together the plates when Malfoy came quietly down the stairs. Harry looked up at him and saw his face reflecting quiet confusion.
Draco stilled and glared at Harry, who was now wearing the same amused expression he had been wearing just a moment ago.
At the name, Kreacher’s head went up and blinked a few times at Malfoy before something that could only be described as a smile came across his face.
They both watched Kreacher disappear with the luggage and Harry nodded in the direction of the staircase.
“Oh, so that’s spaghetti? I suppose I should’ve been able to guess,” Malfoy conceded, walking over to gingerly pick up the plate, still looking at it as if it was something foreign, which, Harry supposed it was.
“And do come visit your Aunt Andromeda and I, and as Edward is Harry’s godson I’m sure he’ll plan on seeing him, you should accompany him.”
In addition to that, Malfoy had spent a week in unforgiving Azkaban. Harry still remembered second year when Hagrid had returned after his week there, the life seemingly sucked out of him. From how Malfoy had looked at his trial, Harry could only imagine how hard that week had been.
Luna continued to smile as if she hadn’t just successfully embarrassed both of them and reached out to touch Draco’s arm.
“Well, it’s not exactly like I wanted to,” Harry answered before rolling his eyes, “are you going to eat it?”
“Well, tell her I said hi,” Harry said, standing up with Luna and leading her to the door. Draco sighed and stood to follow.
“Yeah? Okay, good,” Harry replied, seeming surprised and pleased, “anyway, I wasn’t sure how you wanted to go about dinner. Kreacher isn’t too keen on cooking. There’s food in the kitchen cupboards you can help yourself to for breakfast and lunch, and I don’t know how your culinary skills are but I can cook pretty well, unless you’d rather order or go out.”
“If you, uh, have any issues just let me know,” Harry said, sounding confused and unsure, “er, goodnight?”
Draco was fuming as he sat on his bed, wordlessly summoning clothes and items into suitcases. Clothes and items that would be checked and examined before he would be whisked away to spend the next few months with fucking Harry Potter.
“I suppose Grimmauld Place is rather large and allows for two people to live under the same roof without having to cross paths too often, so I guess, if-if he agrees, we may be able to get through the summer without killing each other.”
“I’ll take silence as agreement,” Harry said with a cocky grin, “and I’ll need to do a raincheck on that bedtime story, I’m exhausted.”
Out of all the things that have taken Harry by surprise- being a wizard (complete with pointy hats and broomsticks) , surviving a killing curse (twice!), Snape being in love with his mom (...no further comment)- nothing could quite prepare him for this.
The study was wonderful. It had brown leather armchairs that surrounded a beautiful mahogany coffee table and a harp-like instrument in the corner of the room that Draco wouldn’t dream of touching. It seemed more of a piece of decor than a functional instrument. The room’s best feature was the giant cherry wood bookshelves that all but replaced the green walls they were placed in front of.
“Well, they never served it at Hogwarts and most certainly never served it at the Manor,” Malfoy answered, “my parents probably thought it was too messy.”
Draco tried to fight down the panic that was quickly rising inside of him. Nobody, and he meant nobody knew about how he felt about Harry. Pansy may have her suspicions but she definitely didn’t know for sure. Trust Luna to be able to see the thing Draco had thought he kept so carefully hidden.
“Oh, Draco!” Luna announced, acknowledging his presence even before she and Harry turned around, “I’m so happy to see you.”
Draco huffed a sigh as he examined the letter. It was from his mother. He opened the envelope and pulled out the note inside.
“What’s that?” Malfoy asked, and must’ve quickly realized how rude it sounded because he followed up with, “I’ve never seen it before.”
The disgruntled house elf appeared after a moment, fingers nervously twisting down the sides of his tattered pillowcase that was fashioned into a tunic.
“It’s June 5th isn’t it?” Draco asked, counting in his head how many days had passed since his arrival.
Draco groaned and unbuttoned his top, trying not to be self-conscious with his more tall and slim figure. He was toned too, sure, but not with the same build as Harry.
Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed it from him, “A letter came for me this morning and the first thing you propose to me when you wake up is flying?”
Harry didn’t want to think of the nightmares that must plague Malfoy. He had lived with Voldemort in his home, had watched him torture and murder. For all Harry knew, Malfoy had partaken in some of it himself. And worse, if he had, Harry knew it was against his will. To torture unwillingly was a form of torture in and of itself.
It was the day in the manor that had made Draco certain. The minute Greyback sent message that he had possibly caught Potter, Draco felt his blood freeze in his veins. They had called him to identify whether or not the disfigured man they had brought along with the “possible” Granger and Weasley was Potter. Immediate denial would’ve been their deaths just as much as admission. He knew it was Potter, knew it was him like he would’ve known himself. His face may have been morphed but his eyes were still his, defiant and stubborn and oh so wonderfully good. He’d claimed uncertainty. A claim that would give them time, and did give them time. He’d known what love felt like when his entire body felt like it had been holding its breath only to let it go at the apparition that had taken the three of them and Dobby away. He’d known because the sight of Harry, disfigured with his eyes flashing as he disappeared had been the most beautiful thing Draco had seen in his life. Despite the anger from his father and Aunt Bellatrix and the sounds of Granger’s screams that he had thought would forever echo in his brain, he had dreamt for the first time in a year. He’d dreamt of a green eyed boy with wild dark hair and strong, tanned hands.
He kept his eyes on the floor and could hear Malfoy ascend up the stairs. Once he was gone, Harry looked up to where he had been, realizing now that that had most likely been Malfoy’s version of a ‘thank you’.
Harry, curse him, laughed, causing his chest to rise and fall in a very endearing and distracting manner.
It had taken him a very long time to accept this fact. It had started as just a childhood infatuation, a reverent crush that came of the stories his mother would whisper to him about the boy who lived. There really wasn’t much to it, as Draco was more fascinated with the concept of Harry Potter than who the boy might actually be. That didn’t stop him from being excited to meet him of course, on that first day at Hogwarts where the little git that was eleven year old Draco would find himself dealing with overwhelming jealousy that Potter had chosen the Weasley boy over him. So, he did as his father would do. Forged that jealousy into hatred. Hatred that he found himself believing as well, even through the increasing attraction he felt towards Potter as he grew older. Besides, he had told himself, just because you find yourself incredibly attracted to someone doesn’t mean you can’t hate them.
Seeing as he considered Malfoy a friend now, there was no harm in buying a bottle of firewhiskey for them to share for when the bloke came back from dinner. That’s how he’d celebrated with Ron after dinner at the Weasleys and they had had fun. Even if they were wearing ‘godawful’ birthday sweaters.
He was still kind of unsure of what to think about the fact that Draco Malfoy was in his house. His guest, no less. Of course, it wasn’t as though Harry had any obligation to treat him as such. He didn’t have to make dinner, but he knew the self-entitled prat most likely had never even seen a pot and pan in his life, or a takeout menu for that matter. What was Harry supposed to do? Let the helpless git starve?
“You surely remember Grimmauld, the only spaces you’ll be sharing are the kitchen and the bathrooms. Otherwise, you most likely won’t even have to associate,” Andromeda stated.
And with that, Harry continued on eating, telling himself it wasn’t much different than any night he’d spent in the house alone.
He had been quite aware of the fact that the once scrawny Potter had filled out a bit in the time he had spent on the run, but Draco had not anticipated that. He was all lithe muscles complete with a toned chest and an abdomen that lead to some very distracting hip bones.
While picking him up to bring him to bed Hermione whispered just loud enough that Harry could still hear her: “And I thought you did not like children.”
“I am sorry, I am a bit early, if you are not free now, I can of course wait. You seem rather occupied with leaving footprints in the floor,” an amused voice came from the door. He spun around to be left gasping.
He demonstratively turned around on one heel and went to the kitchen only to return back mere seconds later with three plates and cutlery. Harry (who still felt his cheeks burning because of the thought of naked pictures of Draco) noticed the atmosphere had changed once again and relaxed a but while the two former Slytherins sat down on the couch and started placing food on the plates.
Interestingly, Harry noticed he was not as scared as he expected. Indeed, he was rather calm when he told her he was gay. She simply nodded and carelessly mentioned that she had expected same as when Sirius had told her. Harry’s raised eyebrow she read as indicator that he indeed did not know. Therefore, she told him a story about his Godfather he indeed had never heard of.
“So, this is where Mr. Too-Good-to-Be-on-Time-to-Meet-his-Best-Friend prefers to spent his afternoons, shagging cute boys he didn’t tell her about.”, she snarls at him. It was obvious that she was having a hard time not breaking out into laughter while talking, therefore her face looked quite tense, attempting to stay serious. While Malfoy only let out an annoyed sigh she turned towards Harry and for a moment lost all her cool attitude when she recognised him.
He wondered if she was going to be as loud and chirpy as her little sister when he heard Draco entering the apartment. The pink-haired man went straight for the kitchen, carrying two stuffed bags full of what seemed to be bottles and still wearing his coat. With a raised eyebrow he nodded at Harry.
Not even Ginny had used to text him. They all knew, he rarely responded. This was why he was in a hurry to check who had messaged him; it could have been an emergency. In her defence, if you later asked Astoria Greengrass, she would have considered her situation as an emergency that required immediate action. Harry’s brows rose higher and higher while reading through the texts.
Grimaud Place had never looked like this before ever. Every inch was cleaned at least twice, every cushion freshly washed, every carpet magically scrubbed, every piece of cutlery polished to perfection and every dark corner enlightened. It looked like another house. A house out of a prospect, ready for people to bring life into it and use all the carefully placed props.
This message resulted in Teddy squeaking happily when Harry read it to him. It also reminded the two boys that it was time to go back home. Before Teddy went to school, he had no friends outside the wizarding world but this had changed a lot until now. Andromeda would be home in about ten minutes to escort the boy to a playdate he had arranged himself. So, this meant that Harry’s time with him would be over pretty soon. When Teddy still had been a toddler, he would always cry when Harry left. Now it was Harry feeling a bit empty when he dropped of his godson and realized that he had a long day of doing nothing ahead of him. With a shrug of his shoulders he took out his phone again and replied to Astoria.
Although Harry had already suggested Draco was not unfamiliar to hooking up with guys, the actual notion of the pink haired man doing so still was uncomfortable for him. Really trying not to sigh audibly he turned his attention away from the pale mass of limbs and sunscreen and focused on the two girls. Friends talked about their friend’s sex life. This was totally normal and as far as it concerned Draco and him, they were no more than friends.
Draco obviously did so. Meeting them in the living room his hair still a bit wet and undone he took quite a while looking up and down Harry’s outfit, something the latter would have been embarrassed about a few weeks ago but he had gotten used to Draco’s judgemental stare when it came to fashion and somehow even felt proud because this was the very first time he had ever gotten one of those. This maybe was the greatest validation of all.
Draco studied his confused expression and was almost about to ask what was up when Harry remembered his manners and asked his guest for his jacket before thanking him for the pizza and mentioning he had also prepared a few tiny sides. Draco leant in and their shoulders touched ever so slightly, Harry was not sure if it was per accident or not.
With a surprised expression Draco left the kitchen, not saying a word and Harry immediately regretted being emotional about such a tiny matter. He focused back on the vegetables, slowly simmering in the pan in front of him. Therefore, it took him a moment to notice Draco had returned shortly after, this time without his coat. Instead, he was holding two fancy looking glasses in his hands, both filled with a liquid that was translucent at the top, slowly turning into bright red at the bottom of the glass. A single, deep red cherry was placed at the edge of it.
With the knowledge that this whole crush thing was not one-sided at all, Harry found his famous Gryffindor courage and decided it was high time to do something which would show Draco he indeed had intentions towards getting closer. Luckily for him, modern technology makes it way easier to get in contact with your special someone and now finally he had his number.
“Imagine me having to suffer through those evenings by myself before Hermione decided to side with me,” Ginny begged for pity. “You know, you will have to suffer through this every year from now on, making a happy face around those sappy people?”, she asked.
“Excuse me Potter, since when are you responsible for my hook-ups? I can take care of that very well on my own thank you very much!”
It took me a while to figure out what to say but as I tend to not find the right words, I decided to make it as quick as possible: I, Harry Potter, am gay and I am not ashamed of it. I think we live in a society where we have overcome judging people by differences and started accepting them for who they are. So, this is me, the man I have always been. And I am not hiding anything anymore. Thank you.”
He was brought back into reality by a soft pull on his sleeve. Astoria was looking at him and then pointing at the dance floor. By Merlin, she could not be serious! He was not a dancer! Looking around, he noticed, they had already gotten their next round of drinks and he was really starting to feel them. His insides felt, well, warm and fuzzy. He had always been a light weight; how did he assume he would manage to keep up with them? Searching for help, he tried to return to the conversation with Draco. Whispering in his ear would still be better as to dance, even though his stomach felt a bit weird when the other man’s lips almost touched his ears. But Draco was not in his seat anymore. Instead, he had already moved to the dance floor and stirred his head following the beats of the music.
This time the answer took a while and he could see Draco on the other end staring at his phone and typing furiously, a self-assured grin on his face while launching in an extravagant chair and drinking way to expensive alcohol.
He took a deep breath without breaking eye contact and scrapped together all the famous Gryffindor braveness he had in heart and just answered the most honest way he could:
“Well you see,” she began, taking a seat next to him but looking in the distance, “there is not only black and white out there. Sometimes you cannot be sure if you are only one thing or the other or if you are attracted to only one gender or –“ She moved her gaze towards him, facing him directly now and he knew he had to keep eye contact as she was searching for an answer in his look.
Harry would have loved to discover some of the secrets this other country might hold or even find the courage to ask where exactly they had been but somehow, he did not dare. The other three seemed to be familiar with so many exotic places he felt stupid. Luckily, he was refreshed enough to escape the trio for a while to not be forced to think about a certain pink haired man and the possibilities of liking him as in
Astoria and Daphne were both enjoying the sun shining on their oily legs, wearing giant sunglasses and sipping from exotic drinks. Both of them were wearing swim suits so fancy they for sure were designer. Astoria had stuck to a rather cute design with a lot of flowers at the bottom and frill on top whereas her sister’s bikini was more on the practical side, a deep blue triangle top and a rather sporty bottom. The colour contrasted nicely with her bright hair and rather light skin as well as her right arm. It was the first time Harry had ever gotten the chance to look at her Tattoos. There were several, a stylized sunrise in a cameo, a flower next to it, a tiny rat holding a red suitcase on the back of her upper arm and of course her Dark Mark with a neat arrangement of red circular forms in the background.
Teddy was currently kneeling in front of a table on the floor, a bright green crayon in his hand and a very proud smile lingering on his face. For the last twenty minutes or so he had been trying to paint Astoria, listening to Harry’s description, asking mindful questions on how long exactly her hair was, what colour her eyes had, how her nose looked like and all in order to do a precise composite sketch so he would recognise her when they finally met. Harry had refused to show him any pictures in order to protect their Glamour secret (and because of the binding contract hindering him to reveal Draco’s secret – as if he even had considered such a shameless thing!) therefore young Teddy Lupin had no other chance as to paint the girl of his dreams.
“I know Draco is your first male partner,” he started what would turn out to be a conversation Harry would have loved to never have. Especially not with Charlie. Not on Christmas. Not about Draco!
Harry closed his eyes and leant into the touch of their lips, pushing his face upwards, trying to get closer to the other body. He could feel his own erection rubbing against his pants and his legs touching Draco’s. Still there was too much space between them and he did the only thing his brain still seemed to be capable of ordering his body to do: He grabbed the soft strands of pink hair at the back of the other man’s head and forced the sinfully lips closer to his own, pushing their mouths open.
Nobody was allowed to go anywhere near her when she did her “magic”. The recipe for the sweet but strong liquor drink was a secret better protected than anything inside Gringotts and still there they were, happily discussing the amount of piment and how to improve the taste even more while from time to time looking into his direction and cackling together. Harry was not ready for this! Draco Malfoy dressed in a decent “I hope your mother likes me”-pullover happily chatting with Molly Weasley in her very own kitchen while they were preparing drinks for the annual Weasley Christmas dinner was too much for him. However, he seemed to be the only one who cared, the others were busy preparing the house for the evening.
Shaking his head Harry tried to get rid of that thought. He would neither cut his hair nor change his height, that would be to drastic. Pressing his lips together he instead focused on his torso, lifting his shirt a bit to reveal his stomach. By no means could he be considered fat or overweight. The skin stretched over flat muscles and showed of his defined abdomen. He could be confident about that if it were nor for the sheer lack of any signs of a six pack. He could work on that.
Spending time with children had always been something Harry loved doing. It was easier to interact with them than with adults. Children tended to say what they actually meant and did not conceal their feelings in order to protect you. As far as it concerned Harry, it had never been a good idea to do something to protect him. Usually this resulted in people getting into big danger or even dying. He hated being protected. He was not broken. Not special.
Uncertain how to proceed in this mess of a date he stayed seated, waiting for Draco to return which took longer than he would have expected. Sadly, he realized, this would probably be the last chance they had at dating and that hurt. He really wanted to – well – get involved with beautiful, proud, cunning Draco but obviously he was simply not capable of handling this guy. Not because Draco was too much, maybe Harry was just not enough.
Harry got more and more comfortable while listening to Draco babble about each hair colour, fashion choice and nonsense concerning the photographs. He even stretched a bit on the couch while Astoria was serving some tea. Time seemed to fly by and he noticed that he enjoyed spending time with Draco like this even more than meeting up in a bar. But the other guy would not have been in Slytherin for good if he didn’t somehow sense Harry’s train of thoughts.
Never underestimate the stubbornness of a Slytherin! Most of them are gifted with a silver tongue and not afraid to extensively use it to get what they want. In this case it was Harry’s company. He still wondered how she had gotten him to come over while he was waiting in front of the apartment door, already in the building. It had taken her several more messages (if you count five as a lot, for Harry who never received texts this number obviously was) to convince him it would be a great idea to swing by. She had also ensured him Draco was absolutely fine with it.
After school, everyone seemed to be so eager to start their lives. Their real lives. They all seemed to have a plan. All except for Harry, the Boy There Had Always Been A Plan For. When asked what he wanted to do with his life now that he was finally free, he just grinned knowingly and people somehow assumed he thought they were joking. That is was obvious.
He moved his head into the direction in which the two witches had been going and Harry’s gaze followed only to discover them a few feet away, dedicatedly chatting about him and Draco as they were constantly looking back at them.
“Oh dear, innocent Harry. For Draco the Night Life is ‘nothing more than a giant buffet of chances to flirt and hook up with beautiful strangers to fall in love for only one night to then become a distant memory.’”  From the concentrated look on her face he could tell that she actually seemed to be quoting someone. Had Draco really said such a thing at any time, he wondered. Of course, Harry had noticed the continuous attempts at flirting but all of them were directed onto him and no one else. Was he currently functioning as a wild card for the other man who tried so hard to be his friend and maybe had changed his behaviour patterns because of that? Was flirting with Harry Draco’s way of avoiding flirting with anyone else? The insecurity concerning the other man came straight back and once again our favourite Gryffindor had a hard time remembering what Hermione had just told him. He needed to take his time and find out whether he really was interested in Draco as a person before starting to overthink every move the other might make or not.
Draco’s hand slightly brushed over the old wooden cabinets and he carefully turned around in the kitchen a few times, as if he was sucking in the details of it. Suddenly, Harry noticed he had not put away his collection of small trinkets from times with his friends, such as the photographs on the fridge. And yes, he had a fridge in his kitchen because Molly Weasley had told him so. Something about magically preserved food always tasting a bit odd (which was not the point. The point was when Molly told you how to do something in your kitchen, she definitely had good reasons and would not stop nagging you until you gave in. Therefore, he had bought a fridge even before he had really moved in). On the wall next to it several paintings gifted from Teddy were displayed as well as the scarf Ron had bought them at the last Quidditch World Tournament or the tickets of the Wyrd Witches show he and Luna went to last year. He was insecure of how Draco who obviously refused to store such sentiments at his apartment would react but all he got was a short nod before the other man moved on exploring his surroundings.
For a short moment he felt this tight insecurity again. Maybe he had misread the signals and Draco was still hiding as much as before. Maybe this was not him showing his true self after all but another strategy of meeting anonymous.
At this time his words were already a bit slurry and he had started hugging his family members a bit too long but Arthur continued telling Ginny how proud he was of her deciding to become a professional Quidditch player before he turned to Harry.
“Andromeda, they are his family as well, he only one he has except for us and he keeps asking about them. Do you really want him to never meet them?”
“Potter, you make me feel like a two-headed unicorn at a child’s birthday party,” the pink haired man finally managed to comment. His voice lacked a bit of the usual sharpness and if Harry had believed it was even possible, he could have sworn it sounded vulnerable. (Which obviously was true, I mean, how would you react if your best kept secret was being exposed to someone whom you just started considering being your friends a few weeks ago? But we have not arrived at that part of the story where Harry notices Draco is, in fact, a human being.)
like them. And you do, otherwise you would have just called the press and not shown up at our place to get advice. And I don’t get how or why it is that git and how you manage to no hate him anymore but I want you to know, I’m ok with that. Even though you screwed up big times, Harry.”
“Care for a drink then, Mr. party saver and master cook?”, Draco asked, a faint hint of seductiveness lingering in his voice. He casually leaned against the kitchen counter, offering one drink with his left hand while taking a sip from his own glass. He was not facing Harry when the other man took the beverage. It was rather sour but has a sweet, alcoholic aftertaste, the dark-haired noticed. Nothing he had ever tried before. He softly licked his lips and searched for Draco’s eyes which now were focusing directly on him. For a quarter of a second a shiver ran down Harry’s spine when his eyes found the dark grey ones. Had they always been carrying so many emotions? He could clearly read the mixture of amusement, interest and something else out of it. A challenge. Quickly, Harry took another sip. Whatever it was, it tasted delicious, like fruits and sugar, a soft bitterness to it. Temptation. Would the taste also linger on Draco’s lips he wondered? As quickly as the grey eyes had found his, they gazed away again. Harry blushed. What was he thinking?
Draco who had already told Harry quite a few times that being seated next to a baby was the worst thing that could ever happen to him at any kind of dinner, shifted closer towards Hermione and Hugo and offered the little boy a piece of his own vegetables. Hermione curiously lifted one eyebrow as Hugo immediately took the offered food and gave Draco his full attention.
First, they even wanted him to be allowed to skip all the training and start directly but luckily, he refused. The programme turned out to be every inch as hard as Ron had complained about. The lack of sleep, the exhaustion, endless lectures on crime statistics, tests after tests of which he failed several on first try and in the end the devastating result for his classmates and the salvation for him: Harry Potter did not get assigned to the Special Task force actively hunting down dark wizards and witches. He did not meet the criteria. Instead, he became part of the research crew who helped gather evidence.
He sat in front of the fireplace – if you consider a five-year-old shifting from his knees to his bum without any rest ‘sitting’ and grinned at Harry. The expression on his face reminded the elder so much of his own god father, he could not help but feel a short pain in his chest, the feeling of being reminded that there is someone missing from your life and it still hurts when you remember them. For the first time however, Harry managed to not only see Sirius in the boy but also a hint of Draco. Maybe it was the self-confidence that seemed to be running in the family.
The next Saturday afternoon he spent as he often did, watching over his godson Teddy while Andromeda was busy finishing all the left-over stuff she did not manage to do with a quirky and very much attention seeking six-year-old around. Him playing with the boy had become a regular thing as soon as Teddy turned a year. It had always been something he felt confident doing by himself, something where he did not need Ginny or anyone else. He was good with kids. It was only after the break up that his monthly visits had turned into weekly ones and as much as Andromeda seemed to be thankful for his help, Harry could always see her hidden concern if he was alright.
“So, does it always look the same?” he asked in a low voice, cautiously watching Draco’s face, looking for any change of expression, any sign his question went too far. He was met by a coy and beautiful smile, which for the first time reached both sides of Draco’s lips, while the other man’s caught his own and slowly lead it to his lips, softly kissing the palm of Harry’s hand.
Draco insisted on bringing him to the door and when they said goodbye our favourite Gryffindor finally managed to make his house proud and stumble an apology for yesterday. The pink haired man came up with his crooked smile and simply said “Everything was perfectly fine, you enjoyed yourself but next time ask before you kiss someone, ok?” while closing the door behind a very confused Harry who tried to not overthink what he had just heard. Is was not that Draco had told him to never do it again but just to ask next time.
Harry, who had been sitting at the very edge of his armchair, jumped up and starred at him, unsure what to do or say. This was not what he had planned! How could something so simple as wanting to help a friend re-establishing his name go so terribly wrong. Cursed be his own name.
The headline sprung into his eyes and for a very brief moment Harry was wondering if this meant, Draco would give away the secret of his actual private life and how muggle he had become. But then he looked at the pictures once again. None of them featured any of the beautiful tattoos or traces of muggle clothing. Still curious he began reading.
“And you, my son Harry, I am so glad that tonight has once again proven family means more than being bound by blood. I am so happy you managed to step out of the shadow of your name this year and finally find your place in this world.”
“Is it really that apparent?”, he asked in a quiet voice, making sure Ron would not overhear them by accident. There would be a place and time when he felt it was right to inform his best friend about his sexual preferences but today was not that day.
Harry started feeling quite bad for himself. Were his looks really that much of a disaster that he needed saving? With a slowly raised eyebrow Draco looked at him and their eyes met. He could have sworn there was a mischievous spark in them, as if the other man knew something she did not see.
He brushed his left hand over the tattoo and Harry understood that it was meant as a symbol to show there were ways out of that darkness. Then Draco said something that almost broke him into pieces.
Harry still remembered the second the realization hit Ginny. He was dating her because she had always been the most reasonable choice. Later that night when they were alone in bed together, she would ask him whether he loved her. He told her, that he loved her from the bottom of her heart. And it was the truth. She still started crying.
All of the former courage had left the Gryffindor and he could barely stand to even look into Malfoys direction anymore. Instead he focused on his neglected coffee mug and desperately wished he had never asked this stupid question. Not Malfoy. Not after the blond git had already let shine through, he was very well aware of the constant starring. How stupid could one single person be, Harry wondered. There was absolutely no reason for Malfoy to not simply get up and straight forward tell the press about this weird conversation. Harry could already read the new headlines: “Malfoy heir molested by the Chosen One” “The third wheel in the Potter relationship was in fact a man – Harry’s man!”
“I assumed you might have questions on gay sex you felt insecure talking to you boyfriend about because you did not want to seem so inexperienced. Therefore, I am here now.”
Not everything was sexual by the way. In fact, Monday evening was spent discussing the importance of the right glasses.
“Well, you remember the stupid article about you being undatable and how you told me you could never be with someone in the closet? I thought to myself I had to do something spectacular – Malfoy style - to show you I am not afraid of other people’s opinions so that you would go out with me and date me!”
There was so much vulnerability in those words and at the same time longing in those eyes, that Harry for once in his life was absolutely certain he exactly knew what he wanted. Not half as graceful as he hoped he would be, he managed to detangle himself from Draco and rose up, holding out his hand for the other man.
“Yeah, imagine Teddy telling you how he told your mother what happened in the series. It’s ridiculous!”
The unexpected answer was a picture of two whiskey glasses, one still containing a bit of fluid, the other one clean and empty. And maybe, just maybe this was indeed an invitation.
Opening it Harry was greeted by a happily grinning young woman clearly dressed in what she thought was “driving attire”. As we are still talking about Astoria who has a bit of a different understanding of fashion and appropriateness, her attire of course consists of deep red gloves, leopard-print sunglasses, a giant white hat and a white thin scarf. She resembles one of those vintage commercials Harry has been gifting Arthur Weasley whenever he cannot come up with a proper present.
That revelation had hit Harry so hard, he needed to talk to someone and usually this someone was Hermione. Without wasting a thought, he had shown up at her doorstep hoping she would have some encouraging words assuring him he did nothing wrong. But life does not always go as you intend it to. Therefore, neither was Hermione the one greeting him at the front door nor was he meet with reassuring words.
Draco starred at the burning cigarette as if he had only noticed what he was doing just now before once again inhaling the smoke slowly, making sure none of it would hit Harry. Then he pulled his eyebrows together and starred into the sky absently.
An artificial cough made him look up from his misery and stare right into the face of Draco. A very different Draco than moments before. His hair was as perfect as before but he was missing his socks and wearing – by Merlin, Godric and Salazar – he was wearing Harry’s hideous grey sweatpants.
By 18:40 he was completely and utterly sure he had screwed up big times and every possible chance of getting closer to Draco now was out of his reach once again. How was it possible for one person to so much suck at texting? How could he be so bad at something so very basic?
While speaking, he looked Harry dead into the eyes, his voice sounding something between mildly offended and amused at the same time. Our beloved golden boy had to swallow hard before answering. Still, he was scared of insulting the other man and therefore giving him a reason not to meet up and talk anymore. Harry quite enjoyed these small encounters quite much.
Ron breathed in loudly and put his son aside to place his now free hands into his lap and watch Harry with a raised eyebrow. He seemed to be considering what to say next, as he was licking his lips – something he had the habit of always doing when he wanted to say something important but was insecure of how to express himself without offending people.
There suddenly was this ice cold, hard thing in Harry’s stomach, making him realize this was actually not only not going well but a complete disaster. He nodded silently, looking down to his feet, unsure what else to say.
Thank you for coming straight to the point. Indeed, Harry Potter and I have been meeting up regularly over the past months. It was him who after the war generously offered to make peace, something I gladfully accepted.
His assumption became even more clear as the waiter arrived with their first dish – a combination of fried mussels and fine meats. Draco’s face immediately turned at least one shade paler (and yes this was possible) and he seemed to be rather disgusted by the sight and prospect of eating that. Maybe it was because he was not into sharing food? Some people had a problem with eating from the same platter.
Unsecure about himself and already reconsidering the idea of impressing Draco by dressing up he was nervously playing with his choker when he finally rang the door. Luckily for him it was Daphne who got the door, gave him a short look and nodded in agreement.
As soon as little Teddy had heard the phone ring, he brought it to his godfather, eager to know what the girl of his dreams had written. It was only logical for the boy to assume it would be her writing. I mean, except for Hermione sometimes checking in on him and Arthur Weasley forwarding strange videos he assumed to be funny Astoria was the only one frequently texting Harry. While listening to the first message Teddy grinned all over his face, the second one however made him pull a face.
Harry Potter had never been the tallest guy, neither in his class nor in the Quidditch team. Even Ginny was only an inch smaller than himself which forced her to always wear flats when they were out together. Until today he had never considered his height an actual problem but when he thought about Draco and how much the other man towered him, he suddenly felt insecure. Maybe the beautiful pink haired was not into smaller men at all. Was there any hex to make him grow a foot?
He was not entirely sure if he had just imagined the tiny purring noise Draco made just before leaning in and kissing him with all he had. This time it was different. This time there was no hesitance in the movement. It was pure desire and affection he felt when the other man’s body was pressing against his, at the same time pulling him over so he landed on top, their hips grinding against each other until the friction almost got to intense. They were all hands and lips and tongues and teeth, exploring, desiring, wanting to get closer, to get rid of everything in between them. While his fingers slowly moved from Draco’s cheek to his collarbones, he could feel eager hands pushing under his shirt, desperately trying to lift it up. Grinning against the lips that were still kissing his, he reached up his hands in order to help Draco getting rid of the piece of fabric.
After the kiss, the other man let go of him pretty soon and left the dance floor with a playful wink. Harry definitely needed a drink now. He fought his way back to the table where he found Draco sitting by himself, staring at him. Still feeling the high of the kisses in his chest, he sat next to him and smiled. Draco leaned in again and asked: “Are you enjoying yourself?”
And then something clicked. Draco started moving his lips, a curious tongue playfully asking for entrance into his mouth to ravish it only seconds later. There were hands all over his body, searching, needing him. The touch on his back had turned into a strong grip, holding him securely while a long leg was pushing him backwards against a wall. The kiss grew from innocence into quite the opposite and Harry heard himself moan loudly when he could feel Draco pressing hard against his hips, clearly wanting this as much he did.
“Harry and I were just about to say goodbye before you interrupted us with matters that clearly could have waited,” Draco told Astoria in a voice that should sound annoyed but actually carried an amused tone. His eyes were focused on our favourite Gryffindor and Harry had to admit that the spark of mischief that lit them actually suited the blond man very well. It made his grey eyes just a notch warmer and felt like they were sharing a secret, not even Draco’s best friends knew about.
He could not help but smile at the comparison of the Malfoy family manor to a literal snake pit. A few years ago, he would have definitely agreed with her but now things tended to be different. He was different, the world indeed was different, not so much black and white, god and evil.
Two days later, this voice had become very silent and had been replaced by a rather hysteric train of thought that constantly told Harry to leave as soon as possible before Malfoy arrived and had the chance to embarrass the Golden Boy by unleashing the press onto him like a pack of wild bloodhounds. The blond git would definitely try to humiliate him. He would stage this meeting as some sort of date where he could act as the suffering victim who had been stalked by the mad Potter, a lovesick maniac. Maybe Malfoy would not even show up. Maybe he would just send a callboy. A stripper. Someone who would make Harry feel utterly ashamed while the former Slytherin Prince could get a fair share of laughs from his Potter-stinks-fan-club.
Only when Draco replied again, did Harry notice the undertone one could easily read into his last message. But maybe this was ok because his subconsciousness had planned to do so anyways.
When she broke it of with a laugh and turned towards Harry, the alcohol in his brain left him no other choice as to mumble “Me too.” She smiled at him softly, cupping his hips with her free hand and pushed him closer. Their kiss was short and sweet and light. He could taste the cocktail, smell the sweet odour of her sweat and perfume and feel her body having fun. This was definitely not a lover’s kiss but he liked it.
Harry decided to finally take a bite from his meal after saying that. Unfortunately, this was the exact moment Draco decided to reach out and touch Harry’s arm which lead to Draco smudging Harry’s food on the table and Harry biting into the air instead.
“Hey there, I thought I would simply bring the food today,” Draco greeted him with a playful half smile and shoved the box into Harry’s hands in order to untie his shoes and reveal perfectly fine and elegant black socks. While still starring at his guest Harry realized that his socks were no match to Draco and his inborn elegance as well as they should have talked about food prior to both of them simply going for what they thought would be right.
Curiously whom might have a reason and the guts to send him something like this, Harry carefully reached for the red parchment. This alone was enough for the magic to be triggered. Quickly, the letter folded itself into a face-like structure, interestingly enough resembling a snake kind of and a very distinctive voice started shouting at him.
Harry smiled when he had finished reading the letter. Truly, when it came to writing, Draco must have learnt more than one or two things from his mother. He genuinely felt happy for her as well as Teddy as they obviously seemed to like each other very much. Maybe Draco would feel the same. It took him quite a while to find a clean, fresh piece of parchment and a quilt to write back but he decided to keep his answer short and simple. The Malfoys might be a family of big words, he certainly was not.
Three months and 17 days and still Draco Malfoy out of all people seemed to be his only chance. Not only because Harry could be absolutely sure, the blonde aristocrat would never address the matter in a conversation with the Weasley family (as if Malfoy would even talk to them!) but also because he never made a deal out of his sexual preferences.
But tonight felt different. Tonight, he was missing someone he could actually have. Someone alive. Someone who made his heart race. A man he had to constantly think about, even when he was asleep and for the first time Harry Potter felt like a normal person.
Maybe this girl would lead him back into life, maybe she was just another escape route young Harry Potter had to take before finding his own way, she thought to herself while they were silently sitting opposite of each other, keeping company. For her, it was her duty to stay here, rebuild the school and fill it with her very own spirit, but Harry on the other hand deserved to be free of his past even if that meant forcing him to leave – for now.
He did not expect an answer as they would see each other again in only a few hours but little did Harry know about how addicted Astoria was to texting. It took less than a minute before his phone vibrated the first time. Another time. And again. Again.
He could see the relief in the other man’s face and Harry wondered if this matter might be of higher importance to Mal- Draco as he himself would have thought. He still remembered the terrible eleven-year-old boy that wanted to be his friend in order to show him how the world spun. Harry smiled to himself. Somehow the situation was not that different. This time however it had been him who came to Draco for help. To Draco. Draco. Draco.
The latter looked up from the phone and turned around to the kitchen, but not without shouting back: “Well, she is not wrong about me obviously liking you and I can’t believe you were taking showers just to impress me, that is kind of sweet and disturbing. But now listen to Parkinson, put away that phone and help me with that pizza. We have a ton of food in here and a lot of stupid stuff to watch on the telly as an excuse to snog even more.”
Another thing Harry James Potter certainly was very wrong about was the maximum of nervousness his body could survive. It had been only yesterday when he was certain he could not stomach more than the anxiety of having to face dozens of press people at once while revealing such a private thing to the world as his sexuality. He guessed wrong.
Therefore, he joins the singing girls and it takes only a short time until all for of them sing. Draco’s voice is different to what he had expected. He does not hit all the notes and he is not as loud as the others but he obvious enjoys himself.
“Well, everyone decides how they want to be seen in public, do they not?”, he answers cryptically. This is the one thing that had been frustrating Harry for weeks now. Whenever he tried to address how his outing had actually affected Malfoy, the other man always managed to either be cryptic or change subjects completely. But this time he would not give up so easily.
It was bright red, gigantic and unmistakably something he had not seen in ages. A very pretty eagle owl had managed to get into Grimmauld place and had dropped a very intimidating looking letter in front of him. It was nothing else but a Howler.
Which left him just with the problem of what to write. A part of him really wished he would be better at this. Another part considered asking his godson Teddy for help. Which was absurd. If a five-year old could do this, why was he hesitating at all? Maybe he was just simply overthinking it once again.
Most of the times he did not. Because he was sure it was true. The Harry Potter born a hero had died. The Golden Boy, the Saviour had been gone, vanished together with the darkness he had to fight. What was left was a very ordinary young man who was struggling to find his place in this world as – in contrast to other people at his age – he never had the chance and time to test out who he actually was.
As soon as it was gone, he gripped the other man’s neck and pulled him closer into a seated position, their erections rubbing against each other in the most delicious and at the same time unsatisfying manner possible while he playfully tugged at the remaining shirt. For a brief moment he was disappointed when the hungry fingers stopped grabbing the skin at his back until he realized Draco had only stopped touching him in order to get rid of his own shirt.
"Well Potter," he said while nonchalantly pulling out the chair opposite of Harry, "I know it has been quite some time since you last had the chance to lust after me across the tables but what special occasion did I miss today that forces you back into old habits?" While still talking he let himself glide into the chair, not breaking eye contact with the former Gryffindor for just a split second.
He was still sulking when a few minutes later his phone finally vibrated once again. In disbelief he stared at the message on the screen.
It has become sort of a Christmas tradition that Arthur Weasley drinks one too many after dinner. It all had started very innocently when he had decided to raise his glass for every member of his family. Unfortunately for his alcohol consumption his family had steadily grown from very to year. And when I mean every member this of course includes spouses as well. Whoever is at the Burrow on Christmas Eve is a member of the Weasley family.
to do. However, he had a favour to ask his best friend before fulfilling his plan. A big one. One, Harry knew he should have come up with without having to be told to. He had almost forgotten a conversation he definitely owed someone.
But all this was in the past now. The Wizarding world was finally at peace – as much as it could ever be. Harry had finished his Auror training without having to face off another Dark Lord or anyone equally evil, just some rogue dark mages and witches who still practiced the Dark Arts. They were however shattered across all of Great Britain and not connected to Voldemort at all.
“But I will be free in the evening. How does a comfortable evening at your place sound instead of a formal date which we both not seem to be very good at?”
Harry puts in the CD and instantly grins from one ear to the other. The first few notes of the song already remind him of easy times. It is some awful boyband classic he had heard a thousand times over and over again.
Harry clenched his shoulders together just for a moment before deciding to not even try and deny what was so obvious to her. Instead he ruffled through his hair and grinned at her sheepishly, looking at her over his glasses.
It was crowded with books, all of them neatly arranged next to children’s toys made by hand. The whole furniture was comfortable and old, yet well put together. On the table books about raising children, the history of potions brewing in Europe and magazines on Quidditch results could be found and the soft humming of Ron from the kitchen was clearly audible. Everything logical Hermione brought into their relationship was cherished with a lovely gesture from Ron. There were tons of pictures of the happy couple together with tiny gifts his best friend had given to his wife over the years as well as snippets of every newspaper article featuring her, carelessly pinned to the wall by a more than proud husband.
Harry had a hard time imagining how Draco would have looked like as a child. Of course, his hair used to be blond back than as his mother’s and father’s but anything else? Had he already been so put together because his parents had taught him to? Did he run around the house annoying Kreacher while cooking or had he always been this mindful person who calculated their steps beforehand and managed to fit into any environment easily as if it was impossible for him to create disturbance?
Texting with Draco turned out to be different to what Harry had expected. And on the same side it was absolutely like he had imagined. It was a lot about teasing, taunting but never directly addressing something. It felt like a dance whose move set he still had to learn but he could enjoy it from the very beginning.
Draco raised an eyebrow and faced him, an unreadable expression in his eyes. A mixture of amusement, disbelieve and something that turned the grey of his eyes into a stormy, liquid sensation.
“You don’t have to tell me who he is but my boy, I think it would help you a lot to say it out loud, get it out of the system.”
Merry Christmas to all of you. If you like this little story feel free to also read the main story "Ten reasons not to date Draco Malfoy " to find out how the boys got together. And also let me know what you think about the story, it would mean the world to me :)
If Harry was one thing then it was absolutely sure that he wanted to trick Draco into sending more pictures. Even more than that he would have loved to touch that delicious part of skin temptingly peeking out of the pulled down towel. The sharp hipbones were clearly visible, the muscles leading downwards well defined and Harry could definitely tell now that Draco might be lean but in excellent shape. He wondered how it would feel to run his fingers over the sensitive skin, his tongue following.
I was for a long time. I still am from time to time because this all feels very new to me. But I am certain now that I am fed up with hiding. I am not ashamed for who I am and I had enough of people assuming something about me therefore I decided to come here today to tell you the truth about me.
Giving up on that particular move he instead practiced raising a single eyebrow to look witty, which he also could not manage to do. He really put force into the muscles on his forehead but it did not help, his stupid bushy eyebrows refused to move one by itself and rather stick together like a giant caterpillar. Maybe he should thin out his brows to soften his face. The weary hands touched his own chin, pushing the stubbles forward while he pulled a face. A beard could help cover up his strong chin and the small chip in it. Or was a harsh jawline considered attractive in men? Critically he moved his face from one side to another pushing his lips around.
Harry nodded, still visibly confused and only managed to mumble “you look fine” which was met with something behind Draco’s eyes softening as if he was relieved Harry did not question the reasons behind him coming without any Glamour but approving of it.
Encouraged by strong fingertips digging into his skin he let his hand continue the exploration until finally, he spotted a bare patch of delicate skin under his touch. Testing, he moved his fingernails across it. Draco reacted in the most beautiful way as he pulled away his face from the kiss, letting out a sinfully pleased moan, opening his eyes once more.
“No, nothing about it is weird. It all makes sense, the apartment, your hair. I like all of it”, he mumbled in response. The moment he noticed what he had just said, the Saviour of the Wizarding World could have slapped himself. In the face. Very hard. In comparison to Draco he was so unbelievable clumsy with words. He wondered, why the other two would not make fun of him.
He had asked himself those questions constantly after they had actually broken up three months ago. It was Ginny's idea to keep it a secret until Ball season would start again. She told him like this the press would have other stories to cover and therefore less capacity to focus on him. She was right about that. After one week, his face disappeared from the covers, after two weeks, the double features became rare and today was the first day he hadn't spotted his own face on any newspaper except the Witch Weekly feature of him being the most wanted bachelor of the Wizarding World.
Biting his lower lip Harry once again looked down at the table, uncapable of reacting to the other man. A theatrical moan came from the blond man. Harry noticed the sound of parchment taken out of a bag. Pale hands with carefully manicured fingernails put something in front of him which looked a lot like a formal agreement he knew from work.
He stood up from his chair and leaned towards an unmoving Harry, his arms so close our golden boy was forced to look at the Dark Mark, study the intricate lines of the tattoo revolving around it. In the centre, everything was dark and his eyes had a hard time finding a path to follow which would lead to the light.
Maybe, because he used to date her only daughter. Maybe, because he would not marry into her family in the end. Maybe, because this would be the point both had to realize they would never officially become a family.
“The only one not feeling alive is you, Mr. Potter, I sadly have to admit. These days I see you walking through the halls like a ghost burdened with unfinished business,” she told him in her sincere voice and Harry’s reaction proved her right. He just looked her in the eyes, a tiredness in his own which did not suit a boy of only eighteen years. He looked at her with the expression of someone who had lived a life and now was ready to step back and let the next generation take over.
“My eyes do not get dreamy! And you make it sound as if I was in love with him! This might just be a phase! I mean, he is the first gay guy I really spent time with.
Harry had stared at him in surprise the whole time the other man was talking. He had not expected anything like that. Draco always seemed to be so put together and self-confident and now he basically had admitted he was only faking that. A gigantic grin sneaked up onto Harry’s face when he started to realize that this was it. This was Draco actually admitting he had tried to impress Draco.
This was the moment, the pink-haired seemed to have decided to finally do something himself as surprisingly cool and skinny fingers almost forcefully wrapped around Harry’s neck, pushing him even close. Their tongues started the sweetest of fights and Harry felt the goose bumps on his skin where the long fingers traced irregular patterns, driving him nuts.
“Sorry, I am not really a huge kisser, Harry,” he explained loudly with what sounded almost like hurt in his voice. For the next part he looked up again: “And you don’t seem to be much of a drinker either, huh?” If our Golden Boy had not really been quite drunk, he might have noticed the vulnerability in Draco’s eyes. But in his current state he just managed to nod when Draco offered him some water and later on did not resist the offered couch to crush on for the night. It had been a long day form him and a lot of things had changed. Maybe he should apologize to Draco for kissing him, he thought right before he fell asleep. ‘Although, isn’t it weird to apologize for something I liked?’
“I would not drink that before you have something in your stomach. That stuff can really twist your guts,” she murmured while pushing her feet under Harry’s blanket. With a dramatic gesture she leaned back onto the cushions and declared: “I would literarily kill for a slice of cheese pizza right now. Does your phone still have battery?”
Being new to idea of being into blokes was one thing. Confronting yourself with the question of what would possibly be considered attractive about you quite another.
From time to time he glimpsed at the telly, but rather because he felt like he should instead of actually paying any interest until suddenly he noticed something. There was a very handsome Asian man with a rather huge amount of glitter around his eyes making a drink for a not an inch less handsome other guy. There was a lot on tension built up in the scene and clearly the characters were drawn to each other but this was not the thing that made him look more closely. It was the clothes the first man was wearing. He knew them.
“Still, the best part was you pulling through the whole sappy family thing wearing that ridiculous Christmas sweater. I bet you’ll be getting one for your birthday as well!”
“But not like you do with Draco. You should see yourself. Your eyes get dreamy and you grin like a moron.”
With this he raised his right arm and gave Harry the chance to look at it closely for the first time. It was covered in fine lines, forming a labyrinth kind of structure. The edges were lighter and the walls became darker the closer they were to his inner lower arm. Where the Dark Mark was. Somehow it had lost almost all of its terror and when Draco turned his arm to enable Harry to inspect it closer up, he could see it as it was. An old scar. Compared to the changes Astoria and Daphne had made on their mark, Draco’s had stayed quite the same. The mark itself was untouched and stood in the centre of the dark labyrinth. Below it Harry could read the now familiar banner.
“Astoria, Astoria Greengrass, in case you can’t remember,” she added with a witty wink. Harry shook her hand, still a bit confused if he was obligated to introduce himself now even though she obviously already knew who he was. She did not seem to mind him being quiet at all, as she simply continued talking.
There was something Draco did not dare to say. It would be only logical if it were an invitation. Their messaging had led into no other direction. Harry grinned like a mad man and decided to open an own bottle of beer. He even took a (rather bad to be honest) picture of it standing on the kitchen counter and sent it to Draco with the caption “Cheers to you Draco.”
Immediately after that he had started to ramble through his closet for suitable clothes for the event mumbling to himself that he definitely needed to fire call Pansy for advice on proper outfit choice as soon as she was back in England. He genuinely seemed to be looking forward to accompany Harry. On Christmas. To the Burrow. Our favourite Gryffindor had used his boyfriend’s distraction to take a closer look at the invitation.
Waking up without your glasses in a different place than your own home is a strange experience, even if you are used to it. It is even worse when you are hung over. You are confused as where exactly you are, how you got there and what actually has happened. Your mouth feels kind of gross, your head hurts, the lights are too bright and everything smells wrong. If you now imagine how scary this would be if it was your first time ever waking up at someone else’s place after having one drink to many you can imagine how frightened Harry felt the day after.
“Well, maybe it is not actually important to him,” he suggested innocently. This cute little remark lead to a chain of events starting with Astoria literally spitting out the juice she was currently sipping from while rapidly getting into a sitting position. Daphne turned her head so quickly in disbelief you could indeed hear her sore muscles ache with pain and she had to hold her head whilst trying not to laugh at her sister who had turned another stage of pale – even compared to Draco – and looked like she was very close to vomiting because of the way to quick movement. Both stared at Harry unblinking which lead to his cheeks burning hot with shame and embarrassment. Even Draco in the distance who had tried his hardest to give the impression of someone sleeping deeply while having a grudge against his so-called friends rose his head nosily. This obviously had been a very stupid remark.
Which Harry did quite a lot, imagining his hands on the other mans body, touching the sensitive skin, licking over the pale pink nipples, scratching his teeth over the sharp hipbone.  Again, those grey eyes were prominently featured but this time his fantasies revolved around the actual Draco and not some nebulous man. He at least came imagining how it would feel like touching Draco’s cock, rubbing their errections together to create friction.
Ginny was as pretty as always, her read hair radiating with sunlight, her sun-kissed forearms covered with the most beautiful set of freckles. She watched him curiously from over the tip of her mug. Her fingers curled around the yellow piece of porcelain as naturally as she fit into his kitchen. Her presence here made so much sense that for a moment Harry had no words but simply missed the time when she would be spending her nights here.
“Well, having another man’s dick in your mouth or up your ass clearly is a good indicator,” Malfoy replied very calmly as this was the most normal thing to say. His face stayed still, only one eyebrow twitching ever so slightly. Again, the heat rose into Harry’s cheeks and he had to look away. How could he say that and keep a straight face as if it was the most common thing to talk about with your former enemy.
When Draco Malfoy came out he did it with style. Of course, a simple announcement or an interview would not do. He instead reacted to the various rumours in a way only he could. It was a feast for the media.
With an excusing smile Draco got up from his chair and said his goodbye to Harry, explaining that he actually had to leave, which – and while he was telling the next part he was viciously staring at Astoria – had nothing to do with the interruption caused by his annoying roommate. It was Harry’s time to pay so he did not feel in a hurry to get up at all. He could as well stay a moment longer and finish whatever this shake Draco had insisted, he had to try, was.
In his mind he repeated the first name over and over again. It sounded strange, unusual. He would need some time to get used to it. But the look on the other man’s face showed him, this was a step into the right direction. A Harry Potter who might be gay might also be friends with Draco Malfoy, he thought to himself and grinned a bit. His life seemed to finally be changing again after ages, finally the world seemed to be spinning again.
His gaze locked upon the chest area and he suddenly very clearly remembered that one awful night during sixth year when they met in the bathroom. The blood, the horror. But nothing of it could be seen as a large tattoo covered up most of Draco’s chest. Again, the colours were held in black and white with only a very small percentage of red in the centre. It was loosely connected to the piece on the right arm but this linework was not as clear, rather smudgy, reminding him of vermin and other crawling creatures, all running together around that red spot, wrapping around it. Protecting it. Or suffocating.
Whenever they had this type of serious conversation Draco tended to end it with something that was actually helpful. He, however, always paired it with a tiny insult – even if it was just going back to last names. Still, Harry thought, he had a point.  Do not rush it. When Hermione had given him the very same advice, he had simply shrugged it off. From Draco it seemed to carry more weight. “Maybe because he knows the feeling of being unsure”, she had explained with a knowing smile. Harry hated it when she gave him that look as if she knew a secret, he should be obvious about as well but wouldn’t want to ruin the moment of enlightenment for him.
And that was is. As simple as that. At the age of 25 Harry Potter was left by his fiancée and girlfriend of seven years because she thought he was gay. Shocking isn't it? How would the press have reacted to this part of the story, he often wondered. And more so, what would the Weekly Witch write about him knowing that not for one second he tried to argue with Ginny. Actually, he wasn't sure if she was wrong at all.
This time Harry nodded and managed to almost look the other man straight into the eyes. Actually, it was more staring at a point between Malfoy’s ears and eyes instead of his actual eyes. He can feel himself blushing, asking himself once again when exactly this had sounded like a good idea and why?
Often Harry had asked himself why nobody was interfering with his looks. Whenever they went out together, he felt more than underdressed. It was not that he actually cared about his looks, but he was rather insecure if the others were not bothered by how unstylish he was. For a while he used to wear the one chic button down Hermione got him a year ago. Astoria noticed that pretty soon and asked him whether he only owned one good shirt. When he nodded feeling a bit ashamed, she was all about dragging him shopping and getting him a whole make-over – if he wanted to, of course.
Half an hour later Harry was back at their table, staring at the dance floor and still wondering about what Daphne had told him before. Did he somehow force Draco to change his habits? Was it because of him the other man did not dare to behave naturally? He saw the other man approaching the table and tried his best to come up with a witty conversation starter but all he managed was: “Where did you leave the guy you were talking to?”
Again, he could have hit himself on the head very hard for this stupid message. Why would someone be lying about taking a shower. The response however made him reconsider his ability in texting.
“A Singapore Sling, a cocktail made famous by the Raffles Hotel in Singapore”, he explained with an eyebrow raised in excitement as he always had when he got the chance to show off with his knowledge or skills. “The main ingredients are gin, cherry liquor, Bénédictine and Cointreau mixed together with a hit of grenadine, some fresh lime juice and bitters, shaken with approximately three ice cubes, filtered, filled up with soda and served in a high glass with a single cherry. Well, at least this is how I make it.”
Which left Daphne, the one Harry had met last. She was all in all not too different to her sister but instead of dancing she obviously preferred doing shots and playing any kind of bar game be it cards, darts or especially table soccer. Fortunately, she was not as talkative as her sister which always gave Harry the possibility to flee towards her when drunk Astoria would not stop talking. Like in the night a few weeks later when the latter would not stop talking about how this and that would look cute on this and that person.
Actually, he was, he noticed while he once more pushed Teddy who was sitting on his swing, his favourite thing to do outside right now. Harry’s action resulted in a very happy squeak coming from the little boy with the purple hair. It would be foolish to assume Teddy always wore his hair in that colour but as he insisted on attending a muggle school before going to Hogwarts, Andromeda had taught him a spell to glamour his hair into a specific colour. This enchantment made sure Teddy’s hair stayed the same during the day. As his grandmother strongly believed in the power of free will and making own choices, Teddy was allowed to decide which colour his glamoured hair should have. He went with purple (after all, he IS Tonks’s son, so what else did you expect?).
“Harry, if it is just a crush, why are you here? And if it could be more you should definitely make up you mind about it. Getting closer to Draco will for sure cost a lot of effort and won’t be easy. Before you overthink what he might find attractive about you, find out what you like about him and how deep this feelings go.”
Maybe his message was the problem. Maybe he sounded as if he wanted to scold Draco, to tell him off for kissing and liking him? Maybe he had given the complete wrong impression.
She smiled at him softly, touching a few strands of his pink hair that had become loose and brushed them back behind his ear.
“Picture time”, she announced and put an arm around Harry. Daphne stepped closer as well, grinning into the camera. Draco shook his head but did not refused even though he stayed in the background. Harry had always wondered why all three of them were so obsessed with taking pictures but then he remembered the end of his first year in Hogwarts when Hagrid had given him the photo album and how much he had treasured it, still holding it high up until today. Sometime pictures help making a moment last a bit.
He prepared himself to re-enter the club when he finally realized that someone had been following him. Someone with a very distinctive pink head of hair, currently standing a few feet away, a lit cigarette in his mouth. The long, elegant fingers grabbed the small thing and pushed it away from the lips slowly, watching Harry carefully. Draco did not really smile nor did he not. There was a tiny twitching at the outer corner of his lips but nothing more when he decided to come closer.
When his curious fingers reached for the seam of Draco’s – his – pants, he surprisingly was stopped by long fingers. Breaking away from the kiss he looked at Draco in surprise.
Sometimes Harry wondered, how Draco would even get to know potential partners. As his first and only relationship had developed out of a long friendship and all his friends in relationships (which were Hermione and Ron, to be honest) had known their partners from back at school, he had absolutely no clue as where one could go to meet new people, though this would certainly change after the night that lay before or Hero.
Harry really tried hard to focus on the words instead of the sensation of having another man being so close to him. He could feel Draco’s breath on his skin, tingling all the way down to his spine. It was an irritation, odd and new sensation. Even in the crowded room he could smell the faint remains of his perfume. It was light and herbal with a distinctive sweetness to it. ‘How strange’, he thought, ‘I always assumed Malfoy would smell like citrus.’
Before Harry could react in any way, Draco took a deep breath and started something like an angry apology monologue:
“Oh no, I am not hiding anymore. I really thought hard about how to top your entrance and outing to the whole Wizarding world yesterday and could not come up with anything as genius therefore I came to the conclusion to simply let the public do what they always do: Gossip.”
Harry was so intrigued by the picture that it took him quite a while to respond. Obviously too long for Draco’s taste.
“I don’t get it,” Daphne shrugged, “there were times Draco would have dragged this cute guy out of the club and snogged him senseless half an hour ago. But since we came back to London, I never saw him taking anyone home and that one,” She pointed at the man with her pint, “is definitely his type. The hell, he even let Astoria move in permanently. Not even I would do that and she is my bloody sister!”
After needing several moments to find the right words, Draco attempted a crooked smile and managed to say: “Well, maybe I have changed a bit more than you had expected?”
”. Harry could not help himself but stare at it. In a strange way it was almost beautiful. Not knowing what to say or how to react he took the tea from her and looked into her face. She carefully observed him with a cautious smile. Astoria had not even attempted to cover it up. Like a giant scar it was omnipresent. He knew the feeling. Also, he realized that if they really wanted to become friends, him her and … Draco they one day had to talk about this. But not today. Other matters seemed to be more important right now.
Finally, the delicious skin was revealed and for the first time he could see the whole beauty of the tattoo covering Draco’s whole chest, continuing until it melted into the sleeve covering his left arm. For a second, he froze in the motion, his unconsciousness screaming at him that he had not been prepared to be confronted with what he was expecting to see, the memory of a bathroom and blood appearing in front of his inner eye. But what he saw after letting go of those perfect lips he as soon as possible wanted to kiss again, was not what he had expected at all.
He had always felt like a member of the Weasley family. This was where he belonged and therefore dating Ginny was - well it was the obvious thing to do. And it seemed to work out pretty well until one day Ron made this terrible joke about Harry dating even him if there had been no female Weasley he could court.
While sliding over the business card which now contained an address, Malfoy got up from his seat and attempted to leave Harry alone. Our favourite Gryffindor was almost tempted to think of this meeting as surprisingly pleasant had the blond man not turned around at the last moment to loudly and announced: “Oh, and you pay! However, you shall not confuse this meeting with a date or any similar activity of such kind! What would the people think of my loss of taste! See you, Scarhead!”
“I am most certainly not going to explain to you once again why I am making that distinction. The witches in MacBeth are based on the covenant in Scotland which exclusively trained females and not on the one that invented broom riding!”
When she loosened her grip on him and he opened his eyes once again, he noticed the guy from before was not gone as he assumed but still dancing closely, this time giving Harry his full attention. It might have been the adrenaline rush but our favorite Gryffindor felt as courageous as any member of his house ever did and let go of Astoria’s hand to turn towards the other man and dance. The blond guy grinned as Harry approached him, but instead of dancing, he gripped the front of the orange shirt and pulled him closer.
“Harry, good to see you. Come on in. Leave your jacket, shoes and glamours at the door!” With that words she gestured him to come inside and closed the door behind herself. Without waiting for him to take of his shoes she already went back inside the apartment which gave Harry the chance to take a look around. The hall was bright and the only thing in there were five cloak hooks, for of them currently empty. It did not seem as if Draco actually was at home. Harry did not like that thought at all. Still, he put his shoes on the shelf below the hooks and hung his old jacket next to Astoria’s which seemed to be a rather formal blazer with glittering pinstripes. He carefully made his way further into the apartment. After only a few steps he felt the tingling sensation of magic.
She carefully padded his shoulder, both sitting there stiffly, unfamiliar with the intimate gesture but she saw her message had arrived as Harry nodded slowly, glimpsing to his left where Ginevra Weasley was currently chatting with Neville Longbottom.
“One step after the other, my boy, first do what you must to show him you mean it and when you figured out all of it you can just bring him here and properly introduce my nephew to me – if you feel like you still should.”
Blowing a frustrated big breath out of his nose Harry looked around in Grimmauld Place. Before hanging around his new group of friends he had never realized how huge an empty house could feel like, how lonely indeed it was. He had tried more than once to envision this dark place as a home, at least for some people in the past. Looking at the heavy tapestry on the walls, it was hard to imagine this had even been a home to a family. Still he knew for a long time the black family used to meet up here regularly.
Harry had to listen to the message twice as Draco’s voice definitely sounded like the wine glasses were working and he maybe had one to many. Which maybe was quite a lot as far as he could judge the other man’s ability to hold his liquor. A lot of questions still arose and Harry decided it would be best to just simply ask all of them.
How could he dare? Well because he cared for that ungrateful cunt, that was why. It was just an attempt to help him, so why did he overreact so much? There was no bad intention behind this! Why was he the bad guy when he just wanted to help? His first intuition was to grab his phone and text back, maybe leave an angry text message. But would that be enough? I mean, Draco had gone as far as sending a Howler, maybe he should do the same? The other guy obviously was into dram, so why not give him what he wanted? Or maybe he should just simply show it at the doorstep and demand to talk, make a scene.
When he arrived at the apartment about half an hour later, Draco somehow already managed to stand inside the open door, coyishly smiling at him and Harry had a hard time resisting the urge to simply kiss the other man on the spot. Instead they greeted each other awkwardly without touching. Draco looked a bit tired but nevertheless breathtakingly handsome in a simple long sleeve shirt and stylish fabric pants. His hair was loosely combed back and a few strands hung into his face. Harry had stopped asking himself how someone could look so good without any effort a long time ago.
“But I always tell other people how proud I am of my friends!” he insisted which was met by a knowing smile.
This was definitely to much. Harry jumped to his feet and ran out of the living room, leaving Charlie behind who was shrugging his shoulders and mumbling he just had tried to be helpful.
But this story would not go anywhere if it only was about Harry staring at someone's back, lost in his own thoughts. The blond man turned his head for the approximately fifth time this day to notice him still staring. Dark eyebrows twitched and a smug smile conquered his lips. With what could only be described as pure elegance the other wizard got up from his chair and made his way towards Harry.
You can of course imagine how hurt he had felt the couple of days after this conversation but in the aftermath, Harry registered it had been a very wise move of his former teacher. All by himself he would have never left Hogwarts and with that his past.
“Harry, I just came back from the giganticest house in the world. It was so huge and there were peacocks and gardens and flowers and we had tea, like real tea – not the sweet kind Granny always serves and Auntie Narcissa was there and she is sooooo pretty. Like a flower. Not that Granny is not pretty as well but Auntie is more pretty like a fairy and Granny is a sunflower. And we had so much fun. We even played hide and seek in the mansion. And I was such a good boy Auntie invited me back any time I want! See, it was a great idea and maybe next time Cousin Draco will be there, too! And maybe I want everyone to call me Theodore from now on!”
“So, you stayed at the Manor for the last few days?”, he carefully asked, searching Draco’s face for the tiniest bit of a reaction, wondering if he had missed him as much as he did himself. He really hoped to read some sort of mutual feelings from the way Draco moved his lips while answering.
Harry almost spit out his tea, eyes wide open. But before he could say anything, she read his mind and continued.
Overrun by the little speech Ron had given him Harry sank back into the cushions and looked at the floor. Was it so obvious? Even to Ron with whom he had never spoken about anything concerning relationships or such? Helpless he scratched his hair and held his head with that hand, the elbow resting on his knee.
“You are really willing to be part of this sappy mess even though the sheer thought of playing the perfect boyfriend to bring home for Christmas turns your stomach?”
This year it were 15 people he toasted to. He started with his wife as he always did. He thanked her because she was the reason they all were here today.
“Are you in a hurry or why are you not taking of your coat?”, the other man wanted to know and Harry suddenly noticed he was sitting in the restaurant with his coat and scarf still wrapped around him. He must have overlooked the cloakroom. Without displaying any grace he freed himself of the garments without getting up from his chair and carelessly hung (or better say crumpled) them behind himself on the backrest from where his scarf immediately decided to fall on the floor in between two tables. A bit embarrassed he bend down to reach for it and, of course, hit his head while trying to get back up.
“Love, don’t treat yourself too harsh. Charlie could not talk to me about it for a year because he was so scared, I would refuse him. I don’t want any member of my family to ever feel like they could not tell me something so important, ever again.”
“Harry”, the pink-haired man started all over again, avoid eye contact while brushing back the stubborn strands. His voice had taken a softer tone, almost caressing the name his lips formed but wrapping them into a certain sadness.
Harry sat up in his chair a bit to look at Hermione who was taking a careful sip from her tea and still watching him, waiting for a response. He had never been able to fool her. Maybe it was a bit early to admit something so new to him but he had already started and over the years he had learnt that it often turned out to be helpful to have a partner in crime.
And then reality hit back in. There had been this guy hitting at him, getting too close and then there was Draco protecting him and then there was the kiss. Was is possible to kiss someone like that just to make sure other people believed they were here together? Maybe after all Draco was just a brilliant kisser and this meant nothing.
The result of his painting by the way was definitely not a photorealistic drawing (we are talking about a five-year-old boy in love!) but a really cute picture of stick man Teddy holding hands with a fairy. She was a bit taller than him as “she is a grown-up Harry and I like large girls; they can reach the top shelf with the candy!” Her hair was very long and ended in something that resembled snake heads. Teddy loved snakes. The outfit was very colourful as she was wearing bright orange tights, a pink fluffy skirt and a blue top which showed her navel. Teddy was very proud of his work and Harry indeed wondered if Astoria would wear this outfit.
He was afraid of the silence that followed his confession. Maybe he had misread the situation once more and this was not Draco showing him, he appreciated the big gesture. The other man leant even more towards the table, putting his elbows on it so that their hands almost touch. Something inside Harry thought this was a great imagery, the hands being a symbol for the distance between them, close but still a large step to go.
She gave him a mixture of her “know-it-all” smile and a reassuring expression to validate the obviousness for her. Carefully caressing her cup of tea while glimpsing at little Hugo from the corner of her eyes she then explained: “Well, you have certainly spent a lot of time together in the last few months as well as whenever I see you, you have to tell me something amazing Draco did.”
“Sometimes we simply fall for someone,” she finished her thought, still searching for an answer in his eyes. “Is there someone who made you reconsider your sexuality, dear? Do you have a special someone?”
When Draco got up and went towards Harry to kiss him, he thought to himself that indeed Draco was the perfect boyfriend to bring home for Christmas. All polite and friendly but still the witty, clever man he fell in love with who would try his best to make Harry’s family accept him. And he was eternally grateful to have found someone willing to be part of his world.
“Are you really sure you want to do that?”, Hermione asked him for the hundredths time. Her left eyebrow was twitching as it always did when she gave him
His face was replaced by the familiar features of Andromeda, shaking her head in disbelief over her own grandson before turning her attention towards Harry.
And suddenly he realized how hard he was, his groin not pressing against Draco’s directly but still rubbing against the fabric of both pants.
“Potter. Harry. We are having lunch. If you indeed intended on going on a date with me, you will have to ask first.”
Suddenly Harry remembered the rumours that had come up right after he left Hogwarts. There had been a time when the wizarding world was absolutely sure Draco Malfoy would marry this girl. And then he disappeared for almost a year, returning with the news he wanted to start his own business.
Harry smirked at his godson. Good, he wished dating was this easy, just ask someone if they like your vision of themselves and as soon as they agree they automatically become your significant other. He wondered if Draco would like the idea of himself as Harry saw him. Good looking, charming but a git, something between elegant and absolutely careless, funny and sarcastic, terrifyingly handsome but in a very unique way and quite a mystery. What did he actually know about Draco? About how he really grew up, what changed him so much over the past years, why he went public with being queer but not with his actual looks. The longer he thought about it the clearer it became: Liking Draco Malfoy did not automatically include knowing a lot about him.
She frowned and crossed her arms, pulling together her eyebrows furiously. Her voice sounded a bit offended even though her answer was challenging.
Astoria got up as well, grinning at the dark-haired man. She leaned a bit towards him and while fluttering her eyelashes asked something Harry would not have expected from a pureblood witch, but who was he to still make assumptions about people based on their past.
Harry lifted his eyebrows in utter surprise. This was clearly not a moment where he would have expected to hear Pansy Parkinson’s name mentioned. He looked at Draco puzzled who in return leant forward to let their foreheads touch. Draco had to lean down quite a bit which to Harry seemed to be uncomfortable but the former Slytherin seemed rather happy with the new position. The feeling of being so close to someone you so desperately want to touch was both new and intoxicating at once to Harry and he wondered if he might actually feel physical pain when their touch ended. Perhaps it would be better if it did not end at all. Nevertheless, he was curious about why Pansy Parkinson would get any credit for their current situation.
As our favourite Gryffindor came closer to the table, he began to wonder how they would greet each other. A handshake was way too formal, but what else? A hug? He had never seen Draco hug anyone before. A kiss? On the cheek? Wasn’t that kind of pretentious? A kiss on the mouth? He could feel the heat in his cheeks by merely considering it. Harry was so lost in thoughts that when he finally arrived at the table all he was capable of doing was giving Draco a short nod before taking his seat.
In the split seconds before their lips met, Harry noticed how different it felt this time, a firm body pressing against his own, soft stubbles rubbing on his cheeks. And the smell, by Merlin, the smell! It made him push closer, leaning in with his whole body. He gripped the man’s head and pulled him closer, opening his lips a bit. This was different than anything he had experienced before. Better. If there was one thing Harry Potter was certain of now, he preferred kissing blokes.
“It is delicious,” he mumbled, putting down the glass and redirecting his attention back to the dish he was currently preparing. He swallowed hard. Draco was only teasing him and he simply reacted because he was not used to get this much attention from anyone, be it male or female. This had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that as soon as he thought about Draco, his mind was fixed on an image of a crooked smile, half open lips…
He stared at the blank chest, admired the faint traces of lean muscles under the skin, clearly showing of how well built the other man was. It was not that Draco had a perfectly defined upper body, he was indeed rather slim but in good shape, maybe a bit skinny but Harry noticed he quite liked that look. Muscles only where they were definitely needed and obviously used. For a long time, he had imagined how Draco would look like underneath the well fitted clothes but this was way better than he could have ever imagined it.
“You know, Hermione told me you have been hanging around with Malfoy for a while now and I kept wondering if you pitied him or something. It never struck me that it could have anything to do with why you left Ginny, but it has, hasn’t it? You hate it when you get something free just because of your name, you never use your fame for other people. Unless you like them. Like
“I actually did, I am sorry. This whole thing between you and me somehow took place in my own head so much I started asking her for advice what to do. But actually, today was the first time I listened to it.”
This time around they ended up on the couch together, legs intertwined in the most impossible manner, their bodies touching what felt everywhere but still not enough for Harry’s personal taste. Draco was lying on top of him with half his weight resting on the other man’s body, balancing the other on his left hand, lazily watching the telly. They had turned on this one show Harry had noticed seemed to have constantly been running on repeat in the apartment. Not that he really paid attention. His hands were to busy brushing through Draco’s incredibly soft hair, fascinated by the fact that the pinkish colour fit the other man so well.
His heart skipped more than one beat while he was reading that. It was so Draco to tell him what to do and not allow Harry to not write and put effort into their friendship but he was more than happy. In the back of his mind he had actually considered their relationship to be over and the pink-haired man never speaking to him. With a tiny grin on his face Harry decided maybe he should for once do exactly what Draco told him to and buy presents.
He left the stage without waiting for the questions to come for he had already planned to do an interview with Luna on the topics of partners and so on. That was something he would want someone he trusted to talk about, not a reporter who simply wanted the most scandalous version of the story.
Boom. Harry’s heart fell into his knees, leaving a terrible dark wound. This was not what he had expected to hear. He knew he did not well but…this sounded wrong.
“Actually, I gave up smoking when I started tattooing my arm. I decided it would be a waste of money and time if I kept hurting my body with this shit when I was willing to suffer through this pain to create something that would last.”
“Yeah, I mean, I would prefer to not wear them at all but could you imagine the gossip? ‘Astoria Greengrass turning into a muggle hipster’ What is happening to the traditional wizarding families’. Oh dear, it would break my mother’s heart if once again the wizarding world would viciously gossip about me.”
All over sudden Harry had to sit up immediately. ‘Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap!’ What by Merlin and Salazar had he done? He knew very little about being friends with a gay man but running around and kissing them without their permission was certainly something you should not do. His first instinct was to grab his glasses as soon as he found them and run home as long as everybody was still asleep. But where were those darn things anyways?
Harry most certainly did not know how to move on from there. He had never been good with words. Actions were his thing but…he had already made his move and now something had to come. Something to diffuse the situation. Something like Draco telling him he liked him. Our favourite Gryffindor had his hopes high for a happy ending to happen there on the spot.
Also, the shape of the glasses added to the feline structure of his face, but maybe that impression comes from Draco licking his lips hungrily whenever he looks at Harry thinking nobody is watching.
Harry was brought back into reality by Teddy who explained to him that his pants were ringing. Surprised, Harry rose an eyebrow. Of course, he was carrying his mobile phone with him just in case of an emergency. There were some areas like here on a muggle playground where a message delivered by an owl would definitely cause suspicion so three years ago he had given in to Hermione who had bought him a smart phone. Needless to say, Harry still used the same exact model and it was in perfect condition for its age. He always took care of the things he owned, treating them as if they were irreplaceable. Also, he scarcely used his phone.
“But I mean, you did not become another person, you still look the same,” he managed to say while noticing that the blond was staring at the door behind him, a horrified expression on his face.
“Why are you telling me this?” Harry quietly asked, letting his gaze trail from Draco’s arm towards the sky. Draco chuckled audible and ran a finger through his hair in disbelieve.
She did not even give him the chance to reply before extinguishing the fire but the faint traces of her smile transmitted to his face. That finally sounded like a good start.
And there he was, Draco Malfoy in a giant blue self-made knitted pullover, featuring a huge white “D” across his chest, grinning sheepishly at his boyfriend while Molly Weasley could not be prouder of herself. Draco Malfoy was wearing a Weasely Christmas sweater and he seemed to be pretty fond of it, obviously still waiting for an answer.
Which leads us to right now where Harry was sitting at the round kitchen table in Andromeda’s house, starring at the little pile of presents he got for Draco, unsure how to proceed. And the clock was ticking. He knew on the other end of this conversation a pink-haired man was eagerly awaiting his response. Draco had reached out (if you consider a Howler reaching out) twice already after Harry had screwed up so it was definitely his time to do something, to send a meaningful gesture. If he only knew how to handle such a situation.
After waiting for what felt like ages, but really might have been 90 seconds Malfoy started talking again.
He used to have these dreams a lot after the war. Often, they were very bloody, visually reminding him of the ones he lost. Sometimes he dreamt of searching for people long gone. His parents, his godfather. But waking up meant he would not find them so Harry decided to stay in the state of uncertainty for as long as possible. As long as he was neither asleep nor awake those people were like Schroedinger’s Cat, somehow both dead and alive – but missing – in his dreams.
Draco stared at the child for a moment, obviously unsure how to interact with small children and then returned to the chat he was having with Hermione. Harry and Ron shared an awkward look, focusing on the food again. All went well until Hugo decided, it would be for his best to sit in mummy’s lap instead of here where suddenly everything seemed terrible.
Harry Potter had been growing up fulfilling expectations. For the Dursleys he had been a varmint. A boy who did not know his place and therefore he behaved as such. For his classmates he had been the Golden Boy who did not have to follow the same rules as them, so he did not. For his housemates he was their mischievous idol, so he let them idolize him. For the Slytherins he was the untouchable enemy, so he let none of them close and dehumanized them. For Dumbledore he was a stupid child, who had to be led onto the righteous path, so he let himself be controlled. For Sirius he had been a lost chance, so he accepted to give him hope. During the war he served many as a beacon of light and he let the flame burn him down. His purpose ended with the death of Voldemort.
Luckily our favourite Gryffindor actually loved dumplings. The taste of the different vegetables mixed with the hot sauce made his mouth tingle. The fact, that Astoria constantly tried to steal from Draco’s plate on the other hand made him giggle quite a lot. The other man defended his food as if it was the most precious thing on earth, climbing onto the cushions and eating while squatting on the couch. Harry wondered to himself, if secretively the Slytherins had always been like that when they were by themselves.
It was not that he did not love her. He still had genuine feelings for her, like for a sister. With Draco it was different. There was a constant pulling and longing in his chest, a desire to be close to him. They hadn’t seen each other for a week now and other than the Howler and the explanation of what he was expected to do, Harry hadn’t heard from Draco either. Which normally would not trouble him as he was used to not hear from people quite much (what happens when one of your closest friends is Luna Lovegood). This time however he was almost dying as he hated the tension between them so much.
For all the wizards and witches out there, he was The Man Who Lived Twice, the born hero, Auror and pride of the community. But maybe, just maybe the time had come to reinvent himself. But was it to early for an outing? Was being in love – because this had to be love, the feelings were way to strong for a simple crush – enough to make such an announcement?
“And this is something you could not simply have texted me? Instead you decided to stalk on me while I was having a lovely time over some drinks with a – friend?” It was only at the very last part of the sentence that Malfoy looked at him once again, an unasked question between them. While Harry was still wondering if he really considered himself and his former school rival actual friends now, Astoria Greengrass (whom he now finally remembered as the rather timid Slytherin girl two years below them) asked the exact same question:
I feel like it is time to show Draco's perspective at this point of the story, so keep an eye open in the next few days for a Fic titled "Draco Malfoy has a broken heart" ;)
He had been dreaming of Draco, searching for him, needing him in his life somehow but could not get a grip of him because in the dream reality he did not exist.
There were certain things that had always defined Harry. His name, the famous scar, him belonging to Gryffindor, the prophecy. None of them he had chosen himself. Not for the first time he wondered what kind of person he would have become if he was not born Harry Potter. It had taken him a lot of effort to overcome the fact he would never know his born family. Losing Sirius and then Remus had reopened that scarcely healed wound once more, something the outside world somehow did not seem to realise.
“Gosh, can’t the two of you stop being that adorable and get a room instead?”, Ginny ended the awkward silence, smirking at both of them while Harry wrapped an arm around his boyfriend, whispering to him that blue indeed was his colour. Somehow this whole evening turned out better than he had ever dared to dream of.
“You are definitely dressed better than my sister,” she casually explained while clearly meaning it as half a compliment for him, half an insult on her. Still, she smiled when she looked at him and gave him a silent thumbs up when Astoria dramatically slide towards the door and gave away a theatrical “Ohhhhhh”. But to be honest, her outfit was more of a surprise than his own. He could not stop himself from grinning when he saw her.
This brings us back to the day 17 days after the breakup. Harry was still sitting in said coffee shop, staring at the back of a well-known, blond haired man and wondering if he was actually checking out the other man.
Three shots later he found himself not at the outer corner anymore but in the middle of the crowd, moving his body carelessly to the music, hands linked with Astoria who was obviously enjoying herself. Again, it was her who helped him ease up. First, he had only followed her movements and felt a bit weird but the light intoxication had helped him with the overthinking and now he quite enjoyed it. Astoria’s dancing reminded him of a snake winding in between obstacles. She managed to not really touch anyone but gave the impression as if she almost would.
Charlie was out to his family and friends but not publicly. It felt more like a not so secret secret shared by a larger number of people. He had never been seen dating a bloke nor had he brought someone home yet. If he had a partner, nobody in the family knew. Malfoy had approached the matter differently. Harry estimated that the number of people knowing about Charlie being gay must equal the amount of witches and wizards not being aware that the sole heir to the Malfoy family was riding his broom the other way around.
“Actually, we do not have that much time left Draco. My Glamour has already started fading and I am not so sure about yours either.”, she explained to him, brushing through his hair with a concentrated look, as if she was searching for something on his scalp. Again, that Glamour thing. Harry started wondering what this was supposed to mean. Malfoy – Draco! – looked like always, what reasons could he possibly have to enchant his appearance?
“Well, it seems as if Robert and Daniel are back together once again, let’s celebrate that with drinks”, Daphne announced just loud enough that the other three could hear her. Astoria grabbed Harry’s wrist and dragged him towards the bar at the centre of the dancing area. How in the world were they supposed to get drinks in this crowded place, he kept wondering? But as soon as they reached their destination, Harry noticed that there in fact was an empty table next to the bar which was clearly reserved for them as a huge “Welcome back, Daphne!” sign covered half a giant chair made from red velvet to resemble a throne.
“Yes, it is,” he simply said, taking another sip from his drink and starring in the opposite direction. And with that their fight was over and Harry decided that from now on he should maybe better mind his own business. If Draco preferred to spent his evenings going out with friends that was totally fine to him. At this very moment he was not capable of admitting his heart had skipped a bit at the thought of him being important in the other man’s life.
He turned around again to face Draco who assured him as soon as they came back everyone would know who Harry’s lunch companion was.
The latter was hiding behind his boyfriend as much as he could without being too obvious about it. Of course, this was another level of family harmony and love he had not been prepared for. Harry had tried his best to warn Draco about sappy Arthur but he wouldn't believe it.
Astoria had written on the small sheet of paper marking a page-long feature in Draco, including all of his fast flings.
If Draco Malfoy was one thing in this world, he was a tease. Harry had to swallow hard, imagining him in his bedroom, carelessly assuming his impact on our favourite Gryffindor, not even imagining how close he was to the truth. And then another picture arrived and Harry’s brain stopped working and his groin took over.
But it did not seem like Draco was in any mood to talk about what happened last night. Instead he stopped at the opposite side of the couch as Astoria had and made a slow gesture with his hand, implying that Harry should move. Without a word he let himself crush on the couch as well and turned on the telly. All of this happened so naturally that our favourite Gryffindor wondered if it was part of their Sunday routine?
He found him sitting outside the house, sitting on the bench at the backdoor together with Ginny and Hermione. They did not notice Harry as the three were occupied with smoking what seemed to be cigars and sharing something out of a flask, each of them shuddering with every sip. Ginny was shaking her head when he found them and after another sip continued a conversation that seemed to have started already:
In most of them Draco looked straight into the camera but one was different. In both his gaze was fixed upon Harry, a soft expression playing around his eyes and mouth. Something so tender, it almost felt inappropriate to see the other man like this. It was a very intimate look he gave picture Harry. The final piece to the puzzle. Draco looked at him lovestruck. It was there clearly.
“Of course, I want this, you bloody Slytherin fool and now get up to my bedroom” he demanded, even it is was completely obvious that he was really nervous. Instead of getting up, Draco reached for his upper arm and pulled him back down. Harry noticed that his counterpart was actually quite strong (and he really liked the image of being pressed against a wall by this beautiful man) and followed the movement. Draco pulled his ear in front of his own lips to whisper something.
Teddy, sitting opposite of him, had found his own way to contribute to the whole drama. He was eagerly drawing a picture of himself as the idea of having a cousin he did not know personally drove him crazy. Cousin Draco had to know how Teddy looked like. Meanwhile Harry let his gaze switch between the boxes of sweets, the perfume, the ridiculously expensive scarf and the dark pullover he had bought. All things he imagined Draco might like them but was insecure if they were to personal.
He did not expect an answer at all and therefore the carefully folded letter appearing on his doorstep without the trace of any owl took him by surprise. The thick parchment felt heavy in his hands and he would have wondered who sent it were it not for the dark green wax seal closing it. The intricate design featured the letters
Harry gave him a surprised look and Draco pulled out his phone, showing him the message, he had been reciting almost word by word. Except for the cuss words he had left out and believe me there were plenty of them. Especially in front of Harry’s name.
“I grew up without knowing about my family and it would have meant the world to me if I had a living relative. Any you are refusing him this chance?”
“If I were you, I would use the chance to eat as long as he is occupied,” he cheerfully explained while Hugo had moved from his hair to exploring the tattoos on Draco’s arms, drawing his fingers along the lines and from then to then looking at the man with big bright eyes.
When Harry first fell for Draco, he was sure this was it, the absolute maximum of how much you could feel for another person. So much longing, desire, needing to be close. But boy, was he wrong.
That was a reaction he definitely had not expected. Harry starred at the Howler ripping itself into tiny shreds and still could not believe what had happened. Draco was not happy about the chance. He did not thank Harry for the chance but rather insult him. Draco was so ungrateful!
Harry just had finished his masterpiece with a last clean-up glamour and carefully placed the vegetable sticks on the table in the living room when the doorbell rang. All over sudden his palms became sweaty and he could already feel his blood pressure rising. Hopefully, this night would be better. Hopefully he did not screw up again.
“So, Potter, why me?”, he just asked instead of greeting the other man first. It was a very simply and logical question to ask concerning the situation. Still, Harry was not sure how to answer, how to start. Deep down inside of him the one voice kept screaming that Malfoy only wanted to make fun of him, embarrass him, use his weaknesses against him.
“No, no, this wasn’t what I meant. Of course, you have changed, I mean, you are not a total git anymore. Since everyone knows…you…you did not turn totally…gay” He whispered the last word, not sure if it was okay to say it out loud which lead to Malfoy responding with a crooked smile and taking another sip from his drink.
The letter Lady Imogen - as she referred to herself - had written went on like this quite a while and something so pretentious like an overly excited text about how great he was written with royal blue enchanted ink on what Harry assumed to be hand- made paper would have normally ruin his mood instantly. But this one was different. This one included one of the single best sentences Harry had read this year:
And the clients. Well, they could be difficult to put it nicely. Those who were never officially connected to Dark Magic tried their best to hide cursed artefacts and such things to make sure nobody got the wrong impression. Those who had followed the Dark Lord were not keen on Aurors entering what bit was left of their privacy and therefore not really cooperative.
And for a few seconds this perfect image took over Harry’s mind: Draco getting up in the morning, all ruffled up, hair undone and still half asleep while he himself would already be waiting in the kitchen with two steaming hot cups of Draco’s favourite tea in the old, chipped mugs. Draco would sit not opposite but directly next to him at the small kitchen table, so close that pasts of their body would always touch. There would not be a lot of talking but small gestures like Draco holding up his hand, waiting for the milk. Draco’s leg hooking in with Harry’s. Draco putting the mugs into the sink when they were finished. Draco yawning carelessly and wrapping his stretched arms around Harry, pressing a kiss onto his lips.
And suddenly all the confidence Harry had worked so hard on vanished in mere seconds. Draco was more than ordinary, a very handsome man putting much effort into his appearance whilst he himself was just plain and boring. He was basically a virgin when it came to partying, society and being gay. There was absolutely nothing he had to offer someone like Draco except for his name and he very well knew that Draco hated him for his name and the fame connected to it. Or at least he had done so for a long time.
Astoria took about 10 pictures from different angles. In some they looked serious, in some they pulled faces but in all of them Harry definitely felt good. Today was a good day to take pictures and is was a welcome change to take pictures together with friends instead of having them taken by reporters on formal events, even though he was sure Draco would do an amazing job as well. He had proven that many times for sure. And for a very brief moment pictures of himself at the Ministry Ball flashed before our favourite Gryffindor’s inner eye. He together with Draco, posing for the cameras. Not the real Draco here but the platinum blonde version with the perfect suit designed to impress other people. They would look good together and back at home Draco would put off his glamour and they would look even better, feeling cosy around each other, not needing to pretend they were someone they were not.
“Well Potter, as I can clearly not simply trust you with information on such a private matter and neither should you, the best solution will be a confidentiality pact ensuring none of us can share any details about our meetings.”
“What does the Flower of Life stand for?”, he dared to ask. She smiled at him proudly and gave away just one word for an answer: “Protection” She then lay back in her seat and seemed to doze of again, still wet from the water she had just returned from. Both Greengrass sisters seemed to enjoy the heat as much as he did. The had used a Portkey to this beautiful beach somewhere in Asia in the middle of the night, straight after coming home and Harry was more than glad Daphne had informed him before hand to bring a pair of bathing trunks with him. Instead of sleeping in their apartment they wanted to sober up her.
“You see, it is not only the penetration,” Charlie started, “you can also do a lot of things with your hands and your mouth to pleasure each other. I once dated this beautiful guy who totally got turned on when he was licking my toes-”
“So now that you have heard all about my magical hair story, is it still weird to you?”, Draco asked with a half-smile on his lips once again and Harry could not stop wondering how anyone could be fooled by a Glamour if he looked way more natural like this.
“You know, there had been several studies – Muggle as well as Wizarding – on what makes people attractive in general. I never considered you were interested in that kind of research,” she carefully mentioned, blowing some lose strands of her bushy hair out of her eyes. Pregnancy, Harry had to admit, had made Hermione prettier than she had ever been. She had gained a few pounds which she never had tried to get rid of again and it suited her very well. Her face had lost the sharp edges and her general expression had gotten much softer in the year Hugo was already part of their little family.
That look between pity and actually feeling sorry for him told Harry that Draco really tried hard to make this work, too, but somehow this evening seemed to be cursed or something like that.
He managed to use his famous name to help someone who was important to him and that felt great. Harry still grinned a bit like a maniac even long after he had put away the letter. It was all to easy. One call at the ministry to ask for the head inspector working on the Algherion case. A quick three minute chat with someone called Firsesteen, a really nervous looking woman in her thirties who would have never expected to talk to Harry Potter this morning other wise she….(this was where he had interrupted her). He plain simply told her he was interested in the case personally and she would do him a favour if she convinced the Algherions Draco Malfoy was their best choice.
Draco grabbed the flask from her hand, drank a bit and then answered her with that snarling sound in his voice Harry had almost been missing the whole evening.
This remark finally brought Harry back to reality and he realized Draco had discovered the tons of food he had prepared. Looking down at his feet and biting his lips he explained he just wanted to make sure there would be something Draco liked and that the other guy did not have to eat any of it.
Still he was wondering why Malfoy had suggested to meet at a Muggle bar, quite outside of any magical district of London. A rather cosy place, however rather fancy than old-school. The tables were made out of blank wood pieces same as the chairs and the menus which included only fancy sounding drinks or organic gluten free vegan homemade smoothies. Harry, always favouring a good old pint over anything else, had simply gone with a still water (which had already been harder to order than he would have ever imagined. As if he cared where the spring was located, which special kinds of stones had filtered the water or what kind of packaging had been used to preserve the natural quality of the drink!)
She looked at him critically, taking in a deep breath. Her eyebrows almost met as if she was really having a hard time trying to find the right words.
I don’t know if anyone did not witness my breakup with Ginny Weasley or that I never addressed the matter publicly – I honestly have never addressed anything concerning my private life in front of so many people to be honest. However, I decided now is the time.
Luckily, the place had seats inside and even though the atmosphere could neither be described as romantic or really inviting, somehow, they managed to come at ease rather soon. And when Harry reached over the counter to receive the two falafel-sandwiches, they finally were in the middle of a conversation. One of the good ones. One of those where you never have to think about your next words but simply talk about whatever comes to your mind.
His fingers traced along the black and silver he had also gotten. It’s simple but intricate design had reminded him of Draco quite a lot. Maybe this was the right idea. He searched for a clean piece of parchment and wrote what got into his mind.
He started crying and would not stop until Hermione picked him up which lead to the end of her conversation with Draco as the toddler demanded immediate and total attention. Harry already feared Draco might feel lost now he had nobody to talk to but then another Christmas miracle happened.
Quite naturally, Daphne occupied her “throne” and Draco sat opposite of her, leaving the small but comfortable couch for Harry and Astoria. The latter chose to sit closely to her sister and go on chattering about the two guys kissing in the corner. That left Harry no choice but sit next to Draco. The pink-haired man had immediately been attacked by not only one but three bartenders who obviously seemed more interested in fulfilling his ever wish than in reacting to the crowd of people who had been waiting for their drinks a considering longer time than their group had. Harry was just about to turn around to the two girls and ask them what all that fuss was about when Draco had managed to get rid of the barkeepers and leaned very closely to asked him a simple question that in that moment meant quite a lot:
Harry read out the rest of the messages while raising an eyebrow as he watched Teddy busily browsing through the closest drawers, obviously searching for something.
“What really makes me curious is why you decided to come out in a whole press conference. I mean you always mentioned you hated giving interviews. What made you go for this option?”
Maybe that was the reason he liked spending time with Draco. The other man knew about his past – their past. How it had really been. Malfoy never thought about him as being special, Harry remembered smirking, actually it had been quite the opposite. He wondered, if some parts of the arrogant brat were still inside the blond man. Well, of course there had to be. Draco was still very self-confident as well as his responses never lacked what Harry would best describe as wit. Was it possible that the former Slytherin had somehow grown into his character?
