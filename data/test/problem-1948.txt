“He’s not an arsehole.” Harry trying to reign in his defensive tone, he wishes he didn’t have to have this conversation, “And Ginny and I don’t work anymore. It was good before the war, but both of us need different things from a relationship, and honestly neither of us were healed enough to be with another person.”
“I understand that,” Says Draco, grabbing Harry’s free hand and clutching it tightly in his own freezing one, “But it’s freezing, and we’re at least a kilometer from home.”
“I’ll just go grab him and then you boys can be on your way.” Andromeda says over her shoulder as she exits the room.
Malfoy sits up straighter and tenses somewhat, removing his arm from around Harry completely. “Okay.”
But when Draco asks if Harry wants him to sleep in the same bed as him, hesitation flitting across his face for the first time that day, Harry isn’t going to say no. That’s how they end up lying in bed and sharing kisses while murmuring about stupid inconsequential things. The upcoming quidditch match between Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, a vacation Draco went on when he was younger, the time Ron, Fred and George saved Harry with the flying Ford Angela.
Harry dares to think about the possibility that Hermione is right, that Malfoy does return his feelings.
“No Malfoy, I’m not setting foot in that place. Madam Puddifoot probably still remembers me as that awful bloke who made his date scream at him on Valentine’s day.”
His mind is begging him to lean forward just a little, maybe see what happens. But he isn’t that self destructive and pulls back.
Instead of being in the pond, he’s in the lake. The locket is still twisting around his neck and he can’t tell up from down, but he can see movement below him.
Even with all the cards from friends, Harry notices that there is no package from Mrs Weasley this year. He does his best to ignore the sinking feeling in his chest when he remembers that he and Draco are bringing Teddy and Andromeda to the Weasley’s on boxing day. This means that Harry and Draco have Christmas all to themselves.
“Not everyone gets off on being insulted, Potter.” Draco snaps, his eyes flashing before looking down at hands.
After a bit of stumbling, cursing, and fighting with the tricky latch, Harry makes his way into the bathroom and sits down beside Malfoy.
Harsh whispers about how he will never be enough, after all he didn’t even use magic to open his front door, he can’t survive on his fame forever. What will he do when the awe at the Boy Who Lived finally wears off?
Draco pushes his face into Harry’s neck. Not quite wanting the comfort, but needing the contact. “Granger seems to think otherwise.”
Harry can feel his mouth hanging open but makes no effort to hide it. Draco smirks and does an obnoxious little twirl. “Looks good right?”
There, no one knows him. No one looks at him funny when he doesn’t use magic to cook or clean or for any other simple tasks. No one calls his name in the streets asking for autographs, or for the secret of how he did it all. He is able to leave the house without getting ambushed by reporters asking him what’s next for The Boy Who Lived?
“We’re gonna miss breakfast if you stay in bed too long, it’s Tuesday so they’ll be serving breakfast sausages, those were always Ron’s favourite.”
“Seriously mate, you could have had literally anyone, at least half the girls in our year- and a fair number of guys for that matter- have been dying for a chance with you since you got your acceptance letter.” Neville mutters, seemingly not able to refrain from asking. “So, why him?”
What follows is utter silence on the other end of the phone, and Harry feels the need to kick himself after the slip up he’d just made. Surely, Hermione would have liked to surprise Ron with her assistant position. Harry can practically hear hermione mentally scolding him through the phone.
Harry had felt this was incorrect, stuttering out a list of the many reasons why he must take the course. But, the professor had insisted, no one who had defeated the Dark Lord belonged in a class with a bunch of beginners and had promptly filed the paperwork that would put Harry on record as a certified Auror.
“Me.” Harry says simply, and tosses the silver and green quidditch robes that were crumpled at the bottom of their wardrobe onto Malfoy’s head.
“Next year maybe.” Andromeda says, setting Teddy down so he can crawl around on the mat and play while the grownups talk. “Do you boys want to stay for tea?”
“What are you talking about, Draco?” Harry asks, leaning in closer to inspect the present, “You’re an honorary Gryffindor now, it’s only natural to have some merch. Besides you’re the one who is always sticking your freezing socked feet between mine when we’re sleeping.”
Malfoy accommodates this new arrangement with minimal complaining, “He’s the best baby I’ve ever met.”
But then stupid Potter with his stupid hair, and stupid eyes, and stupid smile, and worst of all his stupid hero complex had to come and ruin Draco’s fucking life.
“What was that all about Harry?” Hermione asks a they clear the doors and chatter in the hall resumes.
Harry shrugs, and leans in towards Draco stopping a breath away from his lips to say, “I cannot emphasize enough how much I do not care anymore.”
“Well,” Starts Malfoy, rolling a toy car in Teddy’s direction, “My clothing is much nicer than yours, so anything you think is high quality is probably mine.”
With shaky hands he takes out his key and unlocks the flat door. He collapses on the other side, sliding down the door until he sits on the floor with his knees drawn up to his chest. He can hear his racing heartbeat, as well as a voice that sounds suspiciously like Voldemort’s in his ear.
At her voice, Teddy stops crying and looks around for the source, reaching towards her when he sees her. She gladly scoops him out of Harry’s arms and cradles the baby to her chest.
“Well she and I have special permission from Mcgonagall, it was a big thing with the ministry and I almost didn’t get one. Granger and Mcgonagall vouched for me though so I ended up getting it.”
Even though loving Malfoy would certainly make certain people in the wizarding community hate him, he’s also sure that people will find reasons to hate him regardless. His mind flashes back to fifth year when the whole school and wizarding public decided he was a liar and mad.
When he sends Draco a questioning look, Draco just shrugs and says, “I figured the Great Hall might be too much for tonight.”
“What are you doing here Rita?” Harry asks, a little pissed that she managed to find him in a sea of sick witches and wizards.
Malfoy seems dissatisfied with the lack of kissing and attempts to chase Harry’s lips with his own, “Bloody hell Harry, why’d you stop?”
A groan ripples through the table, and Harry gives them all the middle finger while pressing another kiss to Draco’s mouth. Draco laughs and twists their hands together under the table before passing a drink to Harry.
Harry says sure, and goes back to filling out the sheet. It makes him slightly uncomfortable to be so honest, especially when he’s pretty sure the answers he’s giving can’t amount to any good conclusions. But when he hands it back to Luna her face is impartial as she tally’s up some sort of score, and she gives him an indecipherable smile afterwards.
“If your basis for not being nervous around me is that I’ve known you for so long, just know that I hated you for seven years and you won be over in the span of a few weeks.”
Not a whole lot of it makes sense to Harry. He supposes he doesn’t have the mind for poetry, but it’s peaceful so he reads on. One poem catches his eye so he skims it idly. The Waste Land
He leaves the bedroom pretty quickly after that to sit on the floor with Teddy as he finishes his bottle. That’s where Draco finds them after his shower. He lowers himself onto the floor beside Teddy and Harry and leans gently against his side.
Harry can’t help but feel like this first gift exchange is vital to the success of their relationship. When he had said as much to Ron, Ron had scoffed, rolled his eyes and called Harry a giant twat. But he had taken gift shopping more seriously after that.
“You are. Being sweet doesn’t go well with my image.” Draco responds, his lips moving against Harry’s.
Hermione shakes her head sadly, “No, they have pictures of you with Teddy, and shots from what looks like Hogsmead as well.”
“I mean, I don’t know what else you were expecting.” Harry says finally emerging from the diaper bag with cheerios and a banana. He decides the banana will be easier to feed Teddy without a tray or highchair, and begins to peel it.
Harry laughs once more before saying, “They’d have to be good at quidditch, and not act like an idiot around me for starters.”
Clearly not, Draco thought bitterly as he watched Harry shovel eggs into his mouth, some syrup dribbling down onto his chin. No, clearly, the universe was not done fucking with him.
“That’s awesome, Ginny!” Harry says, truly meaning it, he almost moves in for a hug, but then thinks better of it.
The last part is said as if a throwaway comment but Harry can see it was almost physically painful for Malfoy to say.
Before long, Hermione and Ron show up. It provides enough distraction for Draco to turn to Harry and whisper into his ear, “This is a lot.”
Harry looks at Malfoy quickly and then down at his laptop, his cheeks colouring in embarrassment. “Working, Malfoy.”
The woman nods happily but stops when she sees the face of the baby he’s holding, “Oh I thought that was wee Teddy with you, but it can’t be, is this your boyfriend’s child?”
Harry doesn’t blame him though, he’s nervous himself. He knows that the Weasley’s, Neville and Luna will undoubtedly be okay with everything, but he’s slightly worried at seeing his other classmates that he hasn’t seen for a while.
Harry laughs and then stops when he sees they’re about to enter the great hall. Although he knows that the first day back is always hard, he hasn’t really prepared for the onslaught of questions he knows that he’s going to receive. Malfoy glances his way before grabbing his shoulder briefly and heading in. Harry, anxious about being left behind, follows him closely.
“Don’t be stupid.” Harry says, knowing that what Draco is saying is probably true. “They won’t hate you when they get to know you.”
Thursday night draws to a close and finds Harry and Malfoy tangled up in Harry’s bed. Malfoy’s head on his chest and playing with a loose thread on the arm of Harry’s sweater. Harry absently runs his fingers through Malfoy’s hair. It’s entirely too domestic for their non-relationship, but Harry is happy to let it happen.
Malfoy sits tense and shaking under Harry’s arm, but eventually after what must have been an hour, the shaking stops. It’s at this point that Harry realizes that Malfoy is slumped snoring against his side. The git is asleep. Harry snorts, and withdraws his arm from Malfoy’s shoulders. Malfoy wakes up at the jostling and gazes bleary and confused up at Harry. He runs a tired hand through his rumpled hair.
Andromeda doesn’t move, and Harry is suddenly sure this was a mistake, but then she pulls Malfoy into a hug.
The moment is ruined however, when Malfoy pulls back abruptly and starts searching in his bag again.
“Hmm, a little but not too weird.” Harry says, his lips brushing against Draco’s neck as he speaks. “They still have some trouble with crowds and other wizards approaching them. It’s just easier to go out in muggle London if you want a peaceful night. And from what I gathered Luna was helping Neville shop for his girlfriend.”
“You say that Harry,” Draco starts, opening his eyes and looking into Harry’s stupidly perfect green ones, “But how do you know?”
“One thing at a time, Potter.” Draco mutters, squeezing Harry’s hand once before pulling him into a small tattoo shop.
He rolls over and smushes his face into his pillow, letting the alarm go off for about a minute or so before finally getting up and out of bed, shutting off the alarm as he goes.
“Another time Andromeda.” Harry says, casually taking Draco’s hand, “We have plans this afternoon and should probably head out.”
He begins to drift off, Draco’s hand threading softly through his hair and lips brushing lightly along his neck. The words rise up again in his throat, but he pushes them down. Instead turning his head to kiss Draco’s forehead.
“Thanks so much.” Harry says, adding a larger tip to the jar outside of the truck before turning back to Draco and Teddy.
He clenches his eyes shut in the dream, hoping to block out whatever is coming, but knowing it’s unlikely that he can.
Ron looks taken aback for only a moment before his eyes narrow and he sneers at both Harry and Malfoy. “What you’re on his side Harry? He fucking tortured her!”
It’s nice to be with everyone, Harry thinks privately, Draco tucked into his side at this point but gesturing aggressively at Ron and Ginny as they argue about different plays. He isn’t sure why the group is suddenly okay with Draco, but he thinks it might have to do about the boy missing from their ranks.
He eats as quickly as he can, not really hungry but knowing that his body needs the food, and washes the dishes in the sink. Draco is in the other room getting Teddy dressed and packing up the diaper bag and Teddy’s toys.
They settle back down onto the couch with Harry resting against Malfoy’s chest as Teddy rests on his. After the bottle is done, Teddy wants to cuddle for a while so Harry holds him and rubs his back soothingly.
“Honestly Potter, I’m surprised you landed on your own two feet. I’ve heard Weasley mention that you’ve made a wrong turn before.”
Ron hurries to catch up with Malfoy, and Harry distinctly hears, “Oi, amazing bouncing ferret, hold up!”
“That’s different Potter.” He lets out a deep breath before continuing quietly, “ You’ve known me since we were 11, you’ve had an idea in your head about who I am for years now. These first years hardly know me, this is my chance to make a good impression. I know it sounds silly but these students are the future of our school and I don't want everyone to think of me as just another death eater.”
Draco’s resolve is rapidly crumbling. He would like nothing more than to slide under the blankets and snog Harry for a few hours, days, years. But he also knows that Harry doesn’t know what he wants, and if Draco allows himself to get used to this domestic side of the relationship he will be ruined in the end.
The situation is worse than Draco had ever imagined. He is not one to fuck up and say stupid things, yet that’s all that seems to come out of his mouth these days.
Draco takes a seat at one of the kitchen stools and reaches for Harry’s mug of tea. Harry pushes it to him absently, flipping a pancake with his other hand before turning and looking at Draco across the counter.
With difficulty he grits out, “Libraries are where most people do homework Potter, I thought your two brain cells were capable of figuring out where I’d gone without written instructions.”
She turns in his direction and smiles, waiting for him to catch up. When he gets there he hands her the smooth leather clutch she’d been holding.
Harry sighs again, but takes Draco’s offered hands and stands up. “I really just want to go to bed Draco.”
“Is this the company you now keep, Draco?” His eyes flit over to Harry, “There have been whispers of course, after you moved out of the manor. You always held so much promise, the Dark Lord’s very own chosen student. What would your father say about this? I doubt he’d approve of you stumbling about with so little regard for your reputation”
The something ends up being at least ten different owls. Harry sits up slowly, his mind scrambling to think of what to do. He thinks, half-hysterically, of the time when Dumbledore sent all the owls to number 4 Privet Drive. He doubts that these letters hold such happy news.
Draco’s hands come up to grip the back of Harry’s elbows, as Harry’s hands are still playing with Draco’s tie.
Malfoy looks up, face already arranged into a sneer, “What the bloody hell are you on about Potter?”
Draco looks at him desperately for a moment, before kissing him. Harry allows the kiss to last for a few minutes before breaking it and leaning their foreheads together.
Harry knows this and decides that pointing out that they aren’t in the muggle world will not be to his advantage.
The sharp crack of his apparation startles a semi conscious Malfoy, which results in him falling off his bed, hopelessly entangled in the blankets and thrashing around for his wand, his socked feet sticking out the end. Harry laughs as Malfoy tries to compose himself.
By T.S Eliot appeals to Harry for some reason. He’s not quite sure what everything means, but he likes the flow of the words.
What feels like hours later, but in reality is probably only about twenty minutes. Malfoy emerges from the bathroom fully dressed and ready to go.
It’s a short call, in which Draco is mostly silent. His cheeks tint pink at something Blaise says, and he mutters a quick, “Shut up, Blaise.” But otherwise his answers are either yes, no, or sporadic grunts of confirmation.
“We’ll be going now, Sallow. Have a good night.” Draco throws a wad of cash on the table, large enough that the tip for the waitress would be huge, and leads Harry out of the restaurant.
He peeks his head into the Great Hall and doesn’t see Malfoy’s distinctive hair, so he continues towards their room, yawning and stretching his arms above his head.
In his heart he knows that it’s because Draco doesn’t expect him to be some fantastic, world saving, intelligent, emotionally mature hero. Draco takes Harry as is. Panicking, unsure, lost, afraid and sometimes breaking. None of it scares Draco away because it isn’t like he’ll ever be disappointed by Harry being his most true self. It’s almost good that he and Draco didn’t get along for so long, Draco has no reason to believe he was any different than he is now. He supposes it might also have to do in part to the fact Malfoy is now babbling at Teddy and making flying car noises as he scoops food into teddy’s mouth. Harry catches himself staring in pure admiration.
Malfoy’s head turns imperceptibly towards Harry’s hand, craving the touch Harry is giving. He grumbles and nuzzles against Harry’s chest, eyes still closed.
Harry looks up to Hermione and shakily says, “You may be right about me Hermione. But I don’t think you’re right about Malfoy loving me back.”
This kissing is different than last night, it’s deliberate and deep and leaves Harry a bit breathless.
Ron gives a victorious whoop and Harry hears movement on the end that suggested Ron had pulled her in for a hug. Hermione murmurs something to Ron and Ron murmurs something back. It suddenly felt as though Harry was third wheeling on an intimate moment. He absentmindedly picks at a splinter in his hand that must have been from flying earlier while he waits for them to tune back in. After another minute Hermione’s voice comes through the phone again.
Finally, after what seems like ages, Draco sits up and scooches back into his original position of nearly in Harry’s lap and sets a now poorly wrapped present in front of him.
“Hey yourself.” she says, crossing the kitchen to give him a hug. “I feel like I haven’t seen you in ages.”
Without another word, Draco’s hand shoots out and grabs the phone. While Draco handles that call, Harry goes in search of his own cell, which has been ringing non-stop this whole time.
Harry stays quiet, and Draco appreciates it. He doesn’t think he could take bright, happy optimism right now.
He cleans Teddy quickly and wraps him in his baby towel, the little chicken hood pulled over his head. He dresses Teddy in a little pair of jeans and a sweater with the word “Ninja” stamped across the front. Teddy starts to fuss so Harry grabs the bottle off the counter and hands it to him while he sits on the blanket with his toys.
Harry shoots him a look but allows the comment to slide. He grabs one of the bottles from the fridge and heads to Teddy’s bed.
“Oh it happened.” Malfoy assures, “You can pretend it was sleep talk but I know what really happened.”
Malfoy’s next words are muffled slightly by his pillow, “I don’t give a rat’s ass about Weasley and his breakfast, I’m staying in bed for 20 more minutes, Kreacher will be more than happy to bring me my own goddamn breakfast sausages.”
“Once. We have to do this once and then we can put up spells so that no one can find us ever again.”
The door cracks open and Mrs. Weasley’s face peers out. It’s more lined than it was before the final battle and she’s lost weight, but when she throws the door open and pulls him in for a hug it feels the exact same.
Harry ended up getting two things for Draco. He had wanted to get more, but Draco had insisted that two was more than enough and if he received any more than that he would dump Harry instantly.
He had loved how simple and mundane the apartment was and had put an offer in the first time he came to look at it. It was strange that in the midst of everything, a place that is was so startling ordinary gave him such comfort. He hopes they continue talking about his shitty flat, maybe it will distract from the main issue at hand.
Shit, he might have had more to drink than he thought. Curse Neville and his entire rant on Gillyweed.
Harry watches as Malfoy scans the hallway, before his eyes land on a storage cupboard not that far away.
A smile lights on Harry’s face and his voice carries a teasing tone, “Don’t flatter yourself Malfoy, they want to have lunch with me, you’re just lucky enough to be my plus one.”
“Why don’t you grab us a seat and I’ll get us some breakfast and that drink full of sugary foam shit you like.” Harry motions for Malfoy to grab them chairs by the fire.
Draco sighs, but sits up and then gently places Teddy in the playpen to sleep. Harry offers his hand to Draco, who gladly takes it, and then leads the way to Harry’s bedroom.
“Hermione, I really, really don’t know what you want from me… maybe you should just tell me what you want and we can go from there?”
Malfoy continues speaking “And one of the biggest things I learned was that you can’t keep all your feelings inside.”
For the last while Harry has been so, so tired, but now? Now, Harry Potter is finally happy to be awake.
Her gaze lingers on the hand that had been fisted in Malfoy’s jacket not that long ago. Harry averts his eyes quickly, and feels colour rise to his cheeks, though he isn’t quite sure why.
He’s struggling the most with Draco, Andromeda and Teddy. Teddy is only difficult because Harry wants to get him something, namely a broom. But, he doesn’t want Andromeda to think he’s an irresponsible godfather, so he makes a note to run it by her first.
Draco squeezes his hand and shakes his head slightly in warning, but Rita is already pulling out a normal quill and looking expectedly at Harry.
“Okay,” Harry says looking up, “I’ll stop calling you Malfoy, but only if you stop calling me Potter.”
Malfoy glares at him rather pathetically before spitting out, “Typically pressure makes it easier, but I’m not about to ask you to hug me.”
As Harry tumbles out of the fireplace, Malfoy’s couch enters his line of sight and he stumbles towards it. Sinking into the cushions and leaning his head back against the soft fabric, Harry thinks about how the flat is already beginning to feel familiar, and Harry isn’t sure how he feels about that. Malfoy provides a sort of escape that no one else can give him. The other boy doesn’t expect anything from Harry, and despite all the bickering and snide remarks they share, Malfoy makes him feel grounded and calm in a way he hasn’t felt in months. Though the circumstances were less than ideal, Harry is glad it was him that Malfoy had called yesterday night with his panic attack. As Harry comes back to his senses and out of thought, he realizes Malfoy has said something.
Harry’s head lolls on the table as he turns to face Malfoy, “And how is it that you know I don’t shit gold exactly?”
Harry brings himself over to the bar and passes his glass to Tom for a refill. As he waits for his drink he glances across the room and, shockingly, sees Malfoy huddled in a circle with a couple of girls.
Just as Harry is about to answer he hears the shutter of a camera to his right and an obnoxiously familiar voice say, “Harry Potter?”
At this Draco looks up finally and meets Harry’s eyes, “I just know what the cruciatus curse is like and I don’t really think it’s laugh worthy material.”
Draco sits back down on the bed and starts fiddling with his phone as Harry examines the clothing Draco thrust upon him. The shirt is a checkered red and white one with the sweater being the same reddish colour. Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen Draco wear them, and frankly, can’t picture him ever wearing either of these things. He says as much to Draco.
Putting his wand away he mutters, “I can’t believe we’re walking home in this, I survived the war just to catch pneumonia.”
Hermione scoffs in his ear and Harry winces slightly, but waits to hear what she has to say anyways.
He expects and braces for being mobbed by witches and wizards who see them in the shops, yet so far no one has approached them. Even in the Three Broomsticks, although he knew Madam Rosmerta recognized him, given the extra helping of potato soup he received that he hadn’t ordered, even she didn’t gush. For a while he can’t figure out what it is until he watches Malfoy head back to their table from the bathroom. Witches and wizards shrink back from him. Melting into the shadows as if afraid he’ll look or speak to them. Harry marvels at the effect Malfoy has, and feels a little sorry for him. After all, it must be a lonely existence to have no one speak to you and everyone fear or hate you. Harry thinks this but doesn’t bring it up. It’s unlikely that Malfoy needs a reminder of how awful his reputation is in the wizarding world.
Hermione laughs, “It was hardly sneaking, you guys are just so caught up in each other that you don’t notice anyone else. So, I repeat, what would no one believe Harry?”
“Kreacher,” Harry starts, “Would you mind warming this place up and getting some food started please?”
Both Malfoy and Harry stare back at Mcgonagall in confusion before Malfoy says, “She never told me she was testing out! I have like three group projects with her.”
But Harry isn’t known for being afraid, he has nothing but courage apparently. He doesn’t flinch from small gestures and kind words.
With Draco pulled close like this, one of his hands clutching on Harry’s jacket, Harry almost thinks the rain is worth it.
There’s silence for a moment and Harry relishes in the fact that he can say these things and Draco will keep holding him.
Harry laughs and jogs across the street, getting under the awning just before the rain intensifies. He reaches for Teddy and Draco hands him over willingly, trading the baby for the diaper bag.
Harry holds up a box of strawberry pop tarts and Malfoy sneers, though the effect is ruined slightly when he yawns halfway through.
Kreacher has the table set and food served and is trying his best to get Teddy to eat but so far it doesn’t seem to be working. More food seems to be smeared on Teddy’s face and highchair table than in the bowl. He’s crying and reaches for Harry when he sees him.
When he does pause for a breath, Harry tries to speak but Malfoy holds up one hand and says a short, “Not now, Potter.”
“You don’t have to get anything today if you don’t want to.” Draco says quietly, running his thumb over the back of Harry’s knuckles.
Now Draco isn’t an idiot. He knows that that could have been the actions of a half conscious person, but he had wanted so damn much to stay with Harry, so he had. Now that he’s thinking about it, he isn’t even certain he didn’t imagine Harry asking him to move to the bed.
Harry runs his fingers through Draco’s hair and hums while he thinks of an answer, “I just wanted to let you rest and relax before we continue on into the shitshow that is our lives.”
Days would pass him by and he would have only a hazy realization that it was happening. It got to the point where Kreacher found him one morning lying in bed unable or unwilling to get up. Harry still isn’t sure which it was.
Ron nods silently. Hermione keeps looking at him, searching for the cracks in his calm facade. He wishes she wouldn’t.
“Alright, fine. There will be no punishments today since I think the three of you have done enough damage. However, Mr. Weasley, I’d like an explanation for what you’re doing in the castle right now, and why you saw fit to attack one of my students.”
Their shoulders jostle together as they walk and when they reached the courtyard, Harry grabs Malfoy’s arm, making him pause. Malfoy jerks to a stop, and turns so that he’s directly in front of Harry and blocking his view of where so many people died. Harry’s breath is speeding up, and Malfoy starts talking.
After the storage cupboard, Harry and Malfoy had tumbled out and into the abandoned hallway. Malfoy’s hair looked a mess, and he wouldn’t stop smiling at Harry whenever he thought Harry wasn’t looking.
Malfoy snorts and rolls his eyes, “Well it’s a good thing I’m great at it, and Professor Slughorn thinks you basically shit gold so you’ll probably get an outstanding regardless of whether or not your true talent lies with potions.”
Malfoy’s stormy grey eyes are accompanied by a flush high on his cheekbones contrasting against his pale skin. And there’s a light freckle right near his hairline that you can only see if you’re right up close.
She goes to stand up from where she’d been sitting on the bed, absentmindedly clutching a stuffed rabbit. He wonders if one of her brothers gave it to her. If Fred gave it to her. Harry holds his hands out begging her to listen for another second.
“All I mean is,” Hermions starts, brushing a stray curl out of her face, “That’s one of the jumpers Mrs. Weasley made for Harry. Did he tell you to wear it as some sort of gesture, or?”
“Reading are we, Potter?” Draco mumbles, stretching before shimmying up slightly so his face is beside Harry’s on the pillow.
Malfoy gentures vaguely to the tables full of students who are chattering away, oblivious to the two boys arguments.
He eats a quick breakfast alone at his small kitchen bar, nothing like the hustle and bustle of the great hall, then speedily throws on clothes before heading out the front door. There he pauses and murmurs a few security spells that ensure that no one can get into his flat, or even find it’s location, without his say so. Content that they’ll hold until that night, he apparates into the Ministry of Magic.
Hermione turns and looks at Harry consideringly. “No he doesn’t. And I’d like to keep it that way for the time being. You know that he wanted Draco locked up? I don’t need him constantly baraging me with messages while I’m at school to make sure I’m okay.”
Harry thinks he might be fine with the world knowing he loves Malfoy, but only if Malfoy loves him back. He needs to talk to him and figure out what’s going on inside his head.
“He’s scum Harry,” he repeats. “You used to know that and agree with it, so I’m just wondering what happened to make you change your mind. You hated him for practically seven years, and now suddenly Hermione tells me you two have been having coffee dates or something for over a month? You’re living with the guy now? What the hell is going on, and most importantly, why don’t I know about it?”
Every face in the room is shocked and their mouths are hanging open except for Hermione who’s smiling brilliantly and Ron who's looking at Hermione with a knowing look in his eye. When no one says anything, Draco nods once and turns on his heel, practically running to the door where Harry is standing and smiling at him.
It’s then that Harry notices Malfoy standing in the doorway watching him with his eyebrow quirked up.
Suddenly the point of view is switched and he can see himself. Drowning, motionless. Well known faces appear around him. Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, Cedric, his parents, Fred. It’s them, but they’re rotten and wrong and here to hurt not help.
Malfoy laughs weakly and says, “I’m in the middle of a panic attack and it only gets worse when I’m alone.”
“Sleep then,” says Harry as he flops onto one of the couches, “I’ll sleep here, I’m not going home this late, I’ll end up splinched.”
At those words a faint flush appears on Draco’s cheekbones. Harry is once again curious about how long they were both hiding ginormous feelings behind sneers and teasing.
"Fuck, close your eyes I think the wrappings might have torn." Malfoy scrambles off of Harry's lap and dashes towards his present.
From behind her back, Mrs. Weasley produces two familiarly lumpy packages and hands one to both Draco and Harry.
“If you must know, Potter, I’m not really all that eager to boss around a bunch of younger students.”
Harry pauses again in feeding Teddy and lets the baby grab the piece of pancake off the fork and transfer it to his mouth.
Harry restrains himself from snorting as Malfoy pokes himself in the eye with the arm of the glasses. He clutches his eye in pain, before catching Harry laughing at him and hastily returning to his stoic expression.
“Alright mate,” Ron says, running his hand absently through his hair, “I just wanted to let you know that I’m sorry for hitting you, but I’m not sorry for why I did it. Malfoy is scum Harry.”
Harry laughs again, before replying that he’s pretty sure that he can manage just fine on his own thank you very much. This has Hermione laughing and they continue talking about classes, and feasts, and the revolving door of defense against the dark arts teachers for hours. Just like it usually is, Harry’s mind is swimming with memories of Hogwarts. But, for the first time in a long time he isn’t recalling the corridors littered with bodies and rubble, or the quidditch pitch going up in flames. He is reminded of simpler times like pumpkin juice at breakfast and studying for hours in the library with Hermione and Ron for a test he will forget about in the morning.
Harry changes directions, neatly avoiding bowling Fleur and Charlie over, before coming to a stop in front of Mrs Weasley and once again tucking Draco into his side.
After a while, when Harry is almost certain that Malfoy is asleep, and he himself is starting to drift off he says, “I really, really like you Draco.”
If Malfoy is going to be the thing that causes the hate, at least he won’t have to go through it all alone. He can almost imagine it, revealing their relationship, the questioning looks that would follow.
Ron explains that he was in Hogsmeade for a house call, dealing with an old wizard who was convinced people were breaking into his shop, and that was the reason he had decided to visit the castle yesterday.
Draco’s breath hitches and his hands twist aggressively in Harry’s jumper, but his voice is surprisingly steady when he says, “I needed them to know that I don’t care if they don’t like me, but I also needed them to know that my plans for us don’t include heartbreak.”
“Okay.” Harry says, popping a strawberry into his mouth from off the plate Kreacher made for them an hour ago, before rolling so that Malfoy is on his back and Harry is straddling his waist.
For once he couldn’t care less about being ignored. Harry drapes his arm casually along the back of his chair as he talks to Charlie, and Draco leans back to allow the arm to be against him. Once again, Harry doesn’t say anything, his lips just quirk up into a smile, and he shifts his arm to actually be around Draco. Their seats are so close, that it takes practically no shifting for Draco to be able to lean into Harry’s side.
Harry sits on a nearby stool to fill out his form while Draco carefully takes a seat in the tattoo chair and follows suit.
“I know what a grocery store is Potter, I just don’t have a desire to cook for myself. I’m also at Hogwarts for five days of the week and can get by on coffee and biscuits on the weekend.”
“Draco,” Harry says, pulling him in by the back of the neck and into a hug, “I promise you that not a single one of the Weasley’s thinks that.”
“I was hesitant to go back there. I associate it with the war, and all the people we lost. Sirius is always going to lurk in the back of my mind while I live there.”
There’s silence for a moment as both Neville and Luna look at them. Neville with his mouth hanging open and Luna with an expression of vague interest. It’s Luna who breaks the silence first.
“It’s so good to see you Harry, dear.” She says finally, pulling back to look at him, “You’re still too thin, would you like a snack?”
“I was just saying to Longbottom and Luna that Teddy’s getting kind of fussy, and he’s managed to get peas in his hair so we should probably head home.”
“It’s the first week of October Potter,” Malfoy interrupts. “It’s not that late. Besides Granger and I already have altered coursework to make up for the fact that we have a whole year of magical experience on the others. It wouldn’t be hard to alter yours.”
Harry knows this argument is only avoiding the real issue. But still, he forcefully pokes Malfoy in the chest, suddenly aware of how close they’ve gotten before saying, “Oh, because you’re bloody Shakespeare when it comes to words Malfoy, you’re just a fountain of eloquent language!?”
“What is it, Gin?” Harry says finally, scrubbing his face over with his one hand while the other holds onto the wall for support.
Kreacher leads him to an area of the castle that he’s never been before. The corridors seem less worn down, and the decorations are muted. Kreacher stops in front of what seems to be a completely ordinary wooden door.
Draco had left about ten minutes ago to get back to Hogwarts for his classes. He’d wanted to stay, but Harry had insisted that class was more important than this. Draco had argued and kicked up a fuss, but had ended up doing as Harry asked when he said "But who’s going to take notes?"
Self consciously Harry raises his hand to his face. “I thought I had got it all off.” He mumbles, not looking at Malfoy.
He can feel Malfoy’s eyes on him, and for a moment he feels guilty at the implication that he doesn’t want to work with Malfoy. He tries to shake it off. Mcgonagall raises an eyebrow at him.
Draco squeezes Harry’s hand once it’s returned to the table, and as Harry leans towards the other boy, his brand new ink peeks out from underneath his sleeve and poorly taped bandage.
“Seriously Potter, I’m growing concerned that perhaps Hogwarts really isn’t the best place for you? If the sight of a run down shack sends you this far into a spiral of grief, how will you handle Hagrid’s hut?”
Malfoy finally hands the envelope over to Harry, who slides his thumb along the sides, ripping the envelope open. He is surprised to see a singular slip of paper inside. He lifts it up and examines the carefully scrawled ink written on the back Monday December 30th @ 11:30. When Harry flips the business card over to the front he is greeted by the photo of a heavily shadowed model covered in pristine tattoos. The words Ink Addict are printed in bold on the front.
Malfoy continues blabbering on and Harry notices out of the corner of his eye that Malfoy has floo dust tangled in his fine blonde locks.
However, on this particular day, Harry is having trouble focusing due to the increasing wave of panic and anxiety that has taken up residence in his chest. He isn’t quite sure what had caused it, just that being in this class right now is too much, too overwhelming.
“It’s 7 o’clock in the bloody morning Potter, I thought a midnight snogging session would hold you off until 9:30 at the very least.”
"Like adults? Just a few months ago you were saying he was just a kid! You fucking defended him in court because you insisted that all his bad decisions were the poor choices of a neglected child. But now, when worst comes to worst, he’s an adult?"
“Oi Malfoy,” he says, throwing a pillow in the blonde’s direction, “Come on we’ve got quidditch tryouts today.”
Before Harry knows it, Teddy is back in Andromeda's arms and he and Draco are tumbling out of the grate into McGonagall’s empty office. They head back to their room, Harry clutching Draco’s hand tighter when the other boy goes to drop it. Draco shoots him a look, but as there is no one in the corridors, says nothing.
“And that’s all it is, Malfoy?” Harry asks, cheekily sliding his hand up Malfoy’s thigh under the table.
“Oh shove off, Potter. “ Malfoy responds cheeks pink, “I just didn’t want you to draw even more attention to me than I already get.”
Draco just shakes his head and offers no other explanation, following Harry as he leads them down random streets in the hopes of finding a restaurant that serves plain pasta for Teddy to eat.
“Call me when you’re done, okay?” he’d said, thumbing the corner of Harry’s mouth before adding, “I’ll come and get you.”
“Why would I have told you? It’s not like you and Draco were great pals at Hogwarts Harry. You were obsessed and constantly convinced he was up to something-”
Harry is a little taken aback by Ron’s suggestion, but knows that Ron is doing it to ease the sting of George and Ginny’s reactions.
He turns his attention back to Neville and decides to be completely and utterly blunt. “We’re dating.”
Something like cold ankles tangled underneath the covers of his Gryffindor sheets, Malfoy’s breath fanning comfortingly across his neck as they both fall asleep.
Harry starts filling it out, trying to be as honest as possible. Luna stands up and Harry looks at her questioningly.
Harry finds himself sliding his hands up under Malfoy’s shirt and between buttons. He contemplates ripping it off but doesn’t think Malfoy would appreciate that. Shakily, he starts trying to undo the buttons in the dark.
“Come on, Potter. Teddy’s asleep and my back is killing me from this torture device you call a couch.”
The other boy arches into the touch like a cat and hums slightly. They stay like that for a while, Harry twisting his fingers and Draco’s hair and Draco rubbing comforting circles on Teddy’s back.
“What? No I didn’t, you’re absolutely delusional.” Malfoy’s blush comes back full force as he says this and Harry can’t help but laugh.
With that, Draco stands from the chair, allowing his sleeve to fall over the taped up tattoo. The tattoo artist nods quickly and goes about cleaning up everything she used for Draco. Draco calmly pulls Harry over to the wall.
“Okay.” Harry says, closing his eyes and resting his forehead against Draco’s, “We’re gonna be okay.”
“Right sorry Neville, I’ve actually got to hit the loo, catch up later ya?” Harry dashes away hurriedly. Neville had cornered him 15 minutes ago, and although Neville is one of his really good friends, his love of herbology knows no bounds and Harry isn’t nearly drunk enough the deal with that conversation.
Hermione is wearing the expression she normally has when she is about to start arguing why she’s right, but Harry cuts her off before she can even begin, never taking his eyes off his best friend, or moving from his place in front of Malfoy.
Harry nods at this, and decides to stay a little while longer to work on his homework some more. Malfoy walks out the door fiddling with his phone. A few seconds later a text pings through on Harry’s phone. He takes it out expecting Hermione or Ron, but laughs when he sees an unsaved number with a text reading “Hey Scarhead it’s Malfoy.”
Harry wakes up the next morning alone on the couch. Draco must have gotten tired of almost falling off and went to the bed.
Draco is sitting on Harry’s tiny couch with Teddy clutched to his chest. Both their eyes are closed and Teddy has his tiny fingers curled into the large D that is knitted onto Malfoy’s brand new Weasley jumper.
Ron nods and claps Harry on the shoulder before turning back to the front with a disinterested look at the guest speaker.
Hermione waves him off dismissively before adding, “You even went searching in the grocery store for that chocolate pie-”
Harry nods, but is a little angry. How is it fair that all Harry wants in the world is to do the work himself and go back to Hogwarts, and all he gets is the exact opposite. For a second he’s jealous of Malfoy, but only for a second. When he looks up at Malfoy again, Malfoy is already staring back.
Draco stays asleep, though he mumbles something incoherent when Harry wraps his arms around him. Harry smiles softly, and runs his thumb along the stretch of bare skin on Draco’s side where his shirt has rucked up.
“Not this weekend Ron, Malfoy is here with me and I really just want to have a weekend with him and Teddy.”
Harry lowers the fork full of food that was half way to his mouth, he lowers his voice “We can ask together Malfoy. If they see that we’re working together they shouldn’t have a problem scrimmaging with your team as well."
“I don’t want to go, but the idea of not being with you for it is almost unbearable. So I’m going. I might complain for a generous amount of time, drink heavily, and cling to you for most of the night, but I’m coming with you.”
“You’ll think of something.” Draco responds, smiling slightly as he steals a strawberry off Harry’s plate.
After a day that felt like an eternity, he slips out of the room as Harry gets ready for bed, pulling on his ridiculous snitch pajamas that make Draco’s heart warm. Harry looks at him questioningly but Draco waves him off, holding up his phone to indicate he is making a call.
Weeks pass. The school gets used to Harry’s presence like they always do, the awe eventually fading away to normalcy. Harry drops out of the History of Magic class after begging Mcgonagall to let him, and spends that free period helping Madam Hooch coach flying lessons.
“We all have to go through things, Potter.” He breathes, closing his eyes and leaning his head back to rest on the arm of the couch.
“Frankly, I don’t care if anyone sees us. I’ve told Ron and Hermione and they’re the people I care amount most.”
This comment catches Harry’s attention and he brings it back to the conversation. Draco is shaking his head no, and before he can ask what she’s talking about, Narcissa sighs and looks out the window.
Harry rolls his eyes and finds himself looking at Malfoy’s mouth before flitting his eyes back up to Malfoy’s.
Harry looks at her and Ron for a second and debates whether or not to tell them the truth. On the one hand it would be good to have two people know where he is in case it’s a dangerous situation, on the other, for some reason, he’d rather not have Hermione and Ron know he has been spending time with Malfoy. The latter feeling wins the battle in his head, so he lies.
He’s pouting slightly, and Harry can’t help but laugh and wish he were kissing him. Instead he lays his head briefly on Malfoy’s shoulder and says, “Please come with me on Friday?”
“And who says I won’t?” Malfoy asks, looking around the apartment for some sort of book or toy, “I’ll be the fun uncle who appears randomly and showers him in attention and toys.”
Harry feigns thinking about this question before finally saying, “Now? I was just gonna apparate from the shop I’m in.”
“This is more than enough, Draco.” Harry says, watching exasperatedly as Draco scrambles out from under the blanket and crosses the room to the wardrobe.
“You’re no fun.” Malfoy says, crossing the kitchen to pluck Teddy out of Harry’s arms. “Isn’t that right Teddy? Who’s boring? Is it Harry?”
“I know you’ve brought up Muggle counselling multiple times.” Draco says quickly, his voice pitching lower. “He needs to decide to do it on his own or it won’t work.”
Harry can practically feel Draco rolling his eyes, but the other boy doesn’t say anything, just twists in Harry’s arms and presses a kiss to his mouth.
Why Malfoy continued taking this class Harry will never know, all he knows is that he dropped it after fifth year for a reason and desperately wishes it had stuck. He couldn’t care less about the centaur treaties of the past hundred years, yet he is surrounded by his classmates who seem to be taking notes with their colour coordinated quills.
Without waiting for a response, he takes the last few steps needed to sit beside Draco. Their thighs are pressed together and Harry casually leans closer to him so that they’re touching ankle to shoulder, his one arm draped along the back of the bench. Draco glances at him quickly but doesn’t say anything, still focused on getting food into an overtired Teddy.
He’s reading the book Narcissa had gotten Draco for Christmas. It’s a book of poems, which strikes Harry as a sort of strange gift, but Draco has already highlighted several passages, and had read some of it out loud to Harry after a nightmare the other night. It was pretty good, and the only thing Harry could reach without disturbing Draco, so here he is.
Harry looks at it in horror, knowing this appears one sided, when in reality Draco’s hand had been splayed across Harry’s lower back beneath the coat. That Draco, had just said something incredibly vulnerable and sweet and that Harry was just responding in kind.
Harry smiles into his pillow at this, before falling into one of the first peaceful sleeps he’s had in a long time.
Malfoy’s hands are cool and a little rough from years on a quidditch broom. He runs his hand through Harry’s hair. It’s a soothing, repetitive gesture which soon has Harry relaxing again and falling asleep.
Harry feels is heart squeeze at the emotion in Ron’s voice and he says, “Thanks Ron, I’m glad I told you too.”
As the two teams trudge off to the showers, Malfoy leans in closer to Harry so that they’re touching from shoulder to foot. They're completely covered in thick quidditch robes, but still Harry feels that this moment isn't all that innocent.
The answer is short and sharp, and a painful memory of Lupin and Tonks lying lifeless in this very hall floods his mind. Malfoy’s hand on his arm brings him out of his head before he goes too far in. It’s the softest Malfoy’s been with him all morning.
After and hour, Luna looks at a watch on her wrist and says, “Well Harry, our time is up for today I’m afraid, but I think it’ll be good for you to come see me once a week for a while. Is there any day that works best for you?”
They’d had a row about the bloody curtains in the third week, which resulted in Malfoy doing a tricky little charm that kept the curtains open indefinitely. Harry hasn’t really tried to reverse it, and has even gotten used to it.
He turns over and grumbles in Malfoy’s direction, sleepily pulling his comforter up to his chin, “Tomorrow we’re sleeping with the curtains closed, if you like the night sky that bloody much, I’ll buy you a fucking telescope.”
Malfoy snorts, “Clearly not, or you’d know that the only way to get to Hogwarts for the time being is by walking in from the Village. If you tried to apparate directly to the front gates or to the train platform, you’d be rebounded immediately.”
“I’m bloody crazy about you Malfoy.” Harry starts, his palms already sweating, “Like a stupid amount. And I thought that maybe it was just a physical thing or whatever. But I don’t think that’s the case.”
Harry smiles at that and kisses Draco on the jaw. Draco pauses for a moment to kiss Harry properly before turning back to finish unwrapping the gift.
Draco looks up, clearly slightly surprised at being asked, “It was good, overwhelming. It would have been better with you there.”
Harry grins at this and is about to respond when a woman with two full sleeves covering her light brown skin and a ton of piercings on her face sits in a stool on Draco’s other side.
“Harry, you’re one of my best mates. And I want to be happy for you, but I can’t just yet. Malfoy is one of the people who fought for the wrong side, and if less people had done that, Fred would still be here.”
Rolling his eyes, he allows Malfoy to whisper some sort of charm over him. He feels blood peel away from his face and also his robes. It hangs, suspended for a moment, in between Malfoy and Harry before Malfoy whispers another charm and the blood is whisked away.
“It’s the weekend,” protests Malfoy. “Literally one of my two days off from that place, and you want me to go back so you can tour the place you’ve been attending school for the past 7 years?” he draws in a breath, “Merlin, I’ve changed my mind, you shouldn’t go back, my life is difficult enough without having to tutor the boy who lived on top of everything else-”
Harry tilts his head up, just as Draco’s moves his head down, and their lips crash together in the middle. The kiss tastes of cheap beer, and chips, but Harry wouldn’t have it any other way and twists his arms tighter around Draco. Not quite sure if he’ll ever be ready to let go.
Harry sputters at the memory. That’s the second time it had been mentioned in the last ten minutes, apparently his clumsiness is universally known.
Malfoy makes to turn away but Harry’s feeling reckless and loves to prove Malfoy wrong so he grabs Malfoy’s elbow and leans in to whisper in his ear, “I think you’ll find that I can be pretty convincing Malfoy.”
“A few more hours, Draco. You can do this.” Harry says instead, pressing a kiss to the side of Draco’s head before stepping back.
Draco’s heart flutters at the sight, and he takes the few steps needed to twist his hand together with Harry’s and tucks himself, as subtly as possible, into Harry’s side.
Ron seems to be finished speaking and looks around the table. Harry isn’t sure he feels safe looking at anyone else so decides to look at his hands folded in his lap. They’re shaking. But when he hears Molly speak he can’t stop his head from jerking up.
“Fuck.” Harry swears, pausing in his search for a jumper to look at Draco, who's still very naked and very still listening to whatever Pansy is saying to him on the phone. “Fuck.” he says again, turning his attention back to clothing. “Give us ten minutes and then you can come over, I’ll send you the address.”
“Oh ya and who would that be? The merpeople? Yes, it must be nice to dine with you when they can’t understand anything you’re saying.” Harry laughs through his reply and knows he’s in for it.
After this is done, supper is eaten, and the dishes are clean, he finds Malfoy sitting in the living room. He flops down next to him, laying his head on his shoulder.
As they pull back she’s smiling and says, “I fully expect you and your boyfriend to be in my colours at the first game.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes, “Simply to remind you of the time when you illegally snuck into Hogsmead and went on to torture Crabbe, Goyle and I by throwing ice and mud at us while under that blasted invisibility cloak of yours.”
He doesn’t want to allow these dreams to plague him anymore. The war has controlled too much of his life, he doesn’t want to give it any more power over him.
Harry stands beside Draco against the counter so that their shoulders are touching and says, “I was thinking we could go out to a park or something for him to play, and maybe dinner too.”
Malfoy has apparated them into the room where so much horror took place, except all that greets Harry is a large dining table and grand windows lined with silver curtains.
Harry props himself up on one arm to look get a better look at Malfoy. The moonlight from the open window throws Malfoy’s face into shadow, his pale hair gleaming softly.
“You heard her Weasley, I haven’t harmed a hair on your girlfriend's head.” He stands up beside Harry, his hand still twisted in Harry’s robe. “I’d appreciate you lowering your wand, not that you’d be able to hit me even if you tried.”
Ron looks like he is about to interrupt, but Harry isn’t done so he holds up his hand to kindly tell Ron to shut up for a little bit longer.
Harry looks up at Draco, only to see the other boy’s mouth hanging open and shock written across his face. “I didn’t think you’d thought about it.”
Specifically, his mind is focused on Malfoy who is currently stalking across the pitch towards him with a sneer on his face.
She says it offhandedly, but Harry can tell that yesterday had been incredibly difficult for her and that she had really wanted him there with her. Sometimes it’s hard to be the only non-Weasley in a house full of Weasley’s. He nudges her shoulder gently.
Harry shakes his head and picks up his own sandwich, not really in the mood to bother figuring out Malfoy’s complex relationship with eggs. He’d much rather focus on Malfoy’s complex relationship with him.
Malfoy finally unlocks the door and steps inside. Harry stands for a moment in the hall, wondering how he fucked that situation up so entirely, before Teddy makes a crying sound and Harry follows Malfoy into the flat.
It’s more often than not that Harry and Malfoy are touching in someway. Oddly enough, Harry has begun to miss the contact when they aren’t.
He allows this thought to nestle in the back of his mind but doesn't want to spend any longer on it tonight. He has his favourite baby and his boyfriend waiting for him. It can wait a little longer.
“You could look through the premade tattoo book if you wanted to. It’s easier than designing something on the spot.” Draco says, shrugging and glancing over to the various examples on the wall.
Both boys look up. Harry, with some effort, focuses on the person standing at the end of their table. He must have had more wine than he thought. Draco stiffens imperceptibly and all remnants of his loose smile are gone. Instead his cold facade is back in place, unruffled and uncaring. He moves to take his hand out of Harry’s grasp, but Harry holds on tighter and shoots him a look.
“No it’s not,” says Harry fiercely. “If anything you have a better chance of winning these people over because they don’t have a build up of hatred to get over.”
“This pillow smells like you.” Harry mumbles offhandedly, turning his head slightly but still having his voice muffled by the pillow.
As the boys swing the door to the outside open, they’re met with a crowd of witches and wizards. Most of them journalists, but some just random people. Harry wonders if the crowd is interfering with Starbucks business, as they’re standing directly in front of the entrance. He tightens his grip on Draco’s hand and casts his eyes downward, ignoring the questions being called out and flashes from the cameras.
Sighing shakily Hermione says “It’s alright he needed to find out eventually, he just needs to cool down a bit.”
Malfoy groans slightly and tilts his head back to stare at the ceiling, as if praying for patience, “I suppose Potter, but I warn you I’m going to be miserable to live with.”
While he’s contemplating this, Kreacher wanders back into the living area and informs Harry that dinner is ready.
Harry rolls his eyes but stands up and slowly lowers Teddy into the playpen. Malfoy gently grabs his hand after a moment of watching Teddy and guides him to the bedroom.
Harry takes a drink before nodding and saying, “Yes. It looks like you’ll be meeting the whole Weasley clan tonight.”
“I know we said that,” Draco says hesitatingly, “But after Ginny’s little outburst it occurred to me that us not saying anything allows The Prophet to control the story. If we come out with a little statement, nothing too detailed of course, it might ease the pressure a little bit.”
“Well you’re more than welcome to, I just figured private quarter would keep you away from more people.” gently she adds “It might be easier for the two of you.”
Vaguely, Harry notes that his players have paused in the drill that he’s running to focus on his and Malfoy’s conversation, but can’t find it in himself to look away from Malfoy.
He steps in and looks around, noticing a few more pictures of her with friends and her brothers than there were before, as well as some plants that he recognizes from the Lovegood’s house. He turns to face her only to find her still standing by the door and watching him look around.
Harry smiles slightly despite himself and sets his phone down. He almost wishes Malfoy were here. He’s not sure what good that would do for him. He’d likely just make a fool of himself and make Malfoy even less interested than he already is.
“Okay.” Draco says, clearly not knowing how to help with this one but doing his best. “The thing is, you can’t help everyone all the time Potter. That’s not your job, and even if it was it’s wildly unrealistic. Besides,” He says shifting slightly and grabbing Harry’s hand to lace their fingers together, “I’m right here and I’m completely capable of saving myself.”
“As far as I know he just had normal training today and was coming straight home. He probably just has his phone in his bag, or it isn’t working in the ministry. You know it normally doesn’t.”
Harry laughs brightly. By the time they make it to the Leaky Cauldron an ecstatic grin still covers his face.
Harry teases him in the kitchen about how much product he must use to get his hair to look just right, and Malfoy fires back that, “At least I’m not stuck with greasy hair like yours Potter.”
Draco makes to pull Harry along, but Harry pulls him back into a kiss, and wraps his arms about Draco’s middle. Draco’s hand comes up to cup Harry’s face, and Harry allows himself to forget everything for a moment while he’s kissing Draco.
As they slip under the covers and Harry pulls Dracp towards him, throwing an arm over his middle, Draco mumbles, “We are buying you a new mattress tomorrow.”
Harry’s eyes dart over towards him, and his lips quirk up a little, but he says nothing while listening to whatever George is saying. Draco once again tunes the noise out in favor of rubbing his thumb absently over the back of Harry’s knuckles.
“I’ll have you know I’m quite fond of this dump, thank you very much.” Harry says hotly, crossing his arms over his chest.
He twists their hands together in full view of the reporter and says, “Nothing too fancy yet, we will be attending the Gryffindor reunion together soon though.”
As he exits the room a ridiculously adorable sight meets his eyes. Malfoy is asleep on the couch with Teddy curled up against his chest. Teddy looks around at the sound of Harry entering the room and makes a screeching noise, his hair turning blue, he startles Malfoy awake. Malfoy tenses for a moment but relaxes when he realizes where he is and what’s on his chest.
It’s starting to snow, and Harry is all at once grateful for the coat Draco leant him. It’s sleeves are a bit long but that’s all the better to cover his hands with.
Warmth fills Harry’s chest and he squeezes Malfoy’s hand. Draco just smiles and gestures to one of the desks that has some of Harry’s favourite foods on it.
When Harry finally does break the kiss, he takes a deep breath and presses his forehead to Malfoy’s, eyes still closed.
Hey friends! Sorry for the late post today, I was driving eight hours to get home from school:) Thank you for your patience and most of all your continued support with comments and kudos, we love you<3
Harry nods and presses a kiss to Draco’s neck which elicits a shiver from the other boy. Harry leans back, and slurring his words much more says, “Are you, love?”
Harry grins up at him and starts to respond, but Malfoy crowds back into his space and soon enough his mouth is on Harry’s again.
“Bloody hell Potter,” Malfoy sneers, hurriedly putting a book away before Harry spills something on it, “Could you be any messier, I feel like I’m dining with a toddler?”
“Yes, Sallow. I do believe I am.” Draco squeezes Harry’s hand and stands up. Harry scrambles to follow and grabs his coat.
He opens his mouth to say something else, but before he can Malfoy mutters, “God you’re thick.” Grabs his tie, and kisses him.
They both nod and step towards the fire place in the corner of the room. Malfoy goes first, shouting his address before disappearing in a swirl of green flames. Harry makes to follow when he feels a hand on his shoulder.
Harry steps closer to him to share the little warmth he has before saying, “We probably shouldn’t. Teddy really really hates it.”
She immediately proves him right and starts talking about her charms essays that she still has to mark, and how much she wishes that she had her own teaching assistant. This makes Draco laugh and say, “Granger, I don’t think it’s typical for assistants to get assistants.”
Silence again, “Harry it’s not just pictures, it’s like a whole expose on your relationship. And it says a bunch of nasty shit about Malfoy and you.”
Harry slides in next to him, “I’m sorry, I panicked and I didn’t want our relationship getting out to the public through Rita Skeeter’s quill.”
Hermione takes a step towards him, her hands up in a placating gesture. “Ron, I’m fine. Malfoy is harmless.”
Harry takes a breath, waiting, but the moment is ruined when Teddy lets out an ungodly screech and flails his fist hitting them both in the face.
Harry sighs and reaches back for Draco’s hand. Draco takes it without looking up from Teddy. Harry finally gets the chance to look at Hermione.
The three of them quickly make their way to the dining hall, and Harry’s heart soars at having his two best friends at his side.
Harry looks around the room and notices and empty grindylow tank and smiles sadly, thinking about third year and all the years after it.
But after the makeout session, it had been so nice to just lay there, listening to Harry’s heart. And when Harry had finally gotten up from the couch to move to the bed and Draco had tried to reposition himself without Harry’s extra warmth, Harry had grabbed his shirt and sleepily tugged him in the direction of the bed too.
