“Blaise, you will always be my best mate no matter what happens. I don’t want to see you wind up in Azkaban for Criminal activity. And you know they’ll try and pin all your ‘families’ crimes on you.” Draco stressed attempting placate his quick tempered friend.
“Meade, Blake, Conant, Armstrong, Archibald, Carrington, Elverson, Macon, Devereaux, and even Smith, Smith was actually only his study partner for Ancient Ruins by the way. Smith was hitting on Malfoy and he wasn’t interested.” Theo listed off smirking, his leader turned friend really needed to just get over it and shag Malfoy senseless already. He wasn’t about to tell him that Malfoy was still dreaming about him. The blonde may put up silencing spell at night but he couldn’t exactly hide the embarrassed and nervous flush he’d try to hide from Theo in the morning.
Mikhail dropped a heavy strong hand on his shoulder gripping it firmly, “It means that he thinks you’re worth the risk. I truly hope you prove to be.”
“Well it doesn’t matter, you’re wrong I don’t like Potter any longer, so you’re wasting time.” Draco snapped in annoyance. Potter was just a big ugly git anyway. Who needed those chiseled abs, broad shoulders and rugged good looks. Bad! I mean ugly horrible looks!
“I’ve no idea what you mean Greengrass, do you Blaise?” Draco retorted glibly with a wave of his fork. When the Italian merely smirked, and raised a brow, the blonde turned to Adrian expectantly, “Adrian?”
Draco’s brow pinched in confusion, “Pardon?” He asked casually masking his suspicion easily as he studied his fellow student intently.
Draco was in the Kitchen making tea when he heard the floo in the Hallway, signaling someone was home.
"This will be fun,” a cold smile curled Leo’s lips as he gazed out the massive window in the Hall.
“And Professor,” the man tensed, eyes flashing wildly, Draco felt his skin crawl at the mad light in the man’s eyes. “If you ever put your hands on me or any other student again… I’ll bury you along with your career.”
Leo considered for a second, his mind working a mile a minute before smirking, "Theodore Nott."
with the knowledge that in a few short hours he and Harry would be boarding the train to Hogwarts. Where he wouldn’t need to hide their relationship, he could kiss his boyfriend breathless and it would be nobody’s business but their own.
The raven snatched up what looked like a filthy white t-shirt and began wiping his strangely black spotted hands on it. Draco blinked noticing a blue and white Flannel tie around his waist like Lyra’s hoodie.
Draco hesitated curling the first finger lightly before pressing in a second finger. Harry groaned at the pain the second finger brought panting heavily at Draco immediately started twisting and curling and scissoring them before forcing in a third finger. Harry cried out there was defiantly pain that time.
Harry sneezed as dust puffed in his face again as he moved a heavy box of books. Harry had been working on the room for 3 hours and found tons of cool stuff that use to belong to his grandmother he now had old records (Wizards still used Record players, No electricity), a classic acoustic guitar, and an antique Jewelry box he'd hidden in his room to take with him when he left. He figured he may keep the jewelry for his kids when he had them or maybe his future Wife.
"Ron calm down." Carina soothed, she had to admit though, and it really was quite unlikely this. Three friends, all discovering they were really someone else? Curious, very curious, this had Dumbledore written all over it. She need only find out why.
(See the end of the chapter for
A pathetic sniveling interrupted them, “Mummy, Granddad hates me!”
"Call her!" Sirius demanded, annoyed at the smug look on the boys face, he was too cocky for his own good.
Were those girls?
Sirius rolled his eyes, before clapping his hands together with a mischievous smile, (‘So that’s where Carina and Lyra get it’-Remus) "I say we help Malfoy."
Leo frowned, "Bulstrode."
“It’s definitely going to be interesting.” Blaise murmured in agreement, sharing a smirk with Draco. “I’m especially looking forward to meeting Malfoy’s lover.”
“What about you?” Draco and Orion chorused coolly, as the blonde helped her to her feet.
"I suspected as much," He smiled, much o Carina's shock.
The man held up a hand in a placating manner, “I understand your indignation Mr. Malfoy believe me. The reason for my request is simple. Leo needs someone in his life that can keep him grounded and make him look at a situation from a different stand point. He needs someone who WILL tell him when he’s wrong. And if the memory sent to me by my niece is any indication, you might just be that someone.”
Draco’s Mother may very well have a Heart attack if she saw the house elf in her Home, he thought warily, best to hurry up then. Nodding warily Draco allowed ‘Nixie’ to grasp his wrist tightly and with another loud pop he was standing before what looked to be a small Castle almost. Though it was definitely grander and larger then Malfoy Manor, and there were no evil Peacocks to try and eat him!
His thighs tremble with the ach and strain of Leo’s penetration. The hot and heavy slid of Leo slowly forcing his way inside. Draco whimpered and clawed at Leo’s back, it hurt a lot more than he had anticipated.
As they started their trek down the Hall Draco felt his heart begin to hammer in his chest. This was it down this Hall was Leo Potter in his own domain. What does he dress like outside of School? Was the outfit he wore on the train part of his mask or did he really dress that properly? Draco didn’t know how he’d feel about that. He pictured Leo as more of the manly rugged type, who could dress well when necessary. Draco paid no attention to the ornately decorated hallways or the gossiping paintings that they passed, to lost in his own imagination to bother. Lyra slowly as the muffled pounding rhythm shook the long since abandoned paintings on the walls.
Draco pursed his lips as he read the letter again. It seemed someone else that was close to Leo was offering to help him. Draco frowned, what could be going on with Leo that so many people around him were offering to help Draco catch him. The letter did say Leo needed to relax, maybe that was it.
Draco maneuvered them both to the head of the bed, briefly leaving the room to grab a wash cloth to clean them both up. When he finished he tossed the cloth in the hamper and turned to Harry, suddenly looking hesitant.
Leo snapped his book closed and stiffly slammed it on the table beside him, glaring at the wall as he tried to reign in his temper.
"Well he picked the wrong muggles," Harry er, Leo mumbled looking surly.
Draco watched wide eyed as the boy slipped into what Draco presumed was the bathroom. Looking around awkwardly he took a seat on a dark blue leather couch. It was surprisingly plush and soft, as he bounced curiously on it, before relaxing into it. He picked up one of the grey pillows hugging it to his chest as he kicked of his shoes and tucked his feet up on the couch, he doubted Leo would mind if he closed his eyes for a minute.
Julian opened the door ushering the other two in before him. “Alright then?”
He pulled nearly all the way out before slowly pushing in again. Harry gave a shuddering breath that actually felt sort of nice. “More” he ordered more confidently.
Draco didn’t pout, he was a Malfoy, “I just want to be there already,” No point in lying, they both already knew. Pansy had been informed of Draco and Leo’s relationship the second they’d arrived at Malfoy Manor the night before. Draco had been unable to keep it to himself. Blaise had mumbled a vague pray in Italian before excusing himself to the Library the rest of the night. The three would be spending the rest of their Holiday with Leo and his family. Draco’s parents had been relieved to hear it as they were expecting a ‘visitor’ i.e. Draco’s psycho Aunt, her Husband, and his creepy little brother. Draco had always had a sneaking suspicion that the man liked young boys too much. The suspicion only grew stronger when, during Holidays they would be ‘visiting’ Draco would conveniently be staying with Blaise. Draco’s Parents had been invited to join them Christmas Day, as well as Blaise’s Mum and Grandfather, and Pansy’s Mum, Father, and Older Sister.
Bulgarian
Leo’s friends turned back to look at him all looking unimpressed. “That was pathetic Boss,” Millicent told him bluntly.
“Insulting me isn’t going to make me want to help you.” Draco drawled coolly. Who did this guy think he was?
“Brand?!” Draco blanched, he’d heard the Potter’s family magic was a bit archaic, but to brand a year old child?! That was barbaric!
Harry chuckled grabbing his hand and leading him back down stairs, he led him into the living room and pulled him down onto the couch. Grabbing the remote he turned on the TV. Draco blinked watching the pictures move around the screen. “What is...?”
Draco chuckled darkly, catching his wrists and pinning his hands to the table as he lowered his mouth to his neck. “Are you saying you don’t want it?”
“Draco Mal-” *BAM*
“Anyway, when did you two start seeing each other, how’d you meet?” Chuckie asked in an attempt to change the subject.
“Right,” Draco nodded pulling out a small pot from his shoulder bag, “A dab of this three times a day and it shouldn’t even scar.”
“Is he always this overprotective?” Theo asked in amusement.
Julian looked up lazily, “The Fatiguing Infusion is a potion used to induce Fatigue. Inhaling the potions fumes is enough to start feeling the effects. Some identifying characteristics of this potion would be the green smoke that spirals in a slight oval pattern over the side over the cauldron as the smoke is to thick and dense to travel straight up. Some commonly known ingredients are, Fluxweed and Agrippa. But the most important ingredient is the Honeywater heat to just below the boiling point. It’s imperative that you do NOT boil the Honeywater as it’ll lose all its potency.”
A hand grabbed her arm to steady her, “Now Signorina(1) is that anyway to act, I was always taught to apologize for such rozzo(2) behavior, how rude of you.”
Harry squirmed trying to turn over so he could look at the blonde. Draco tightened his grip, “No means no Harry,” He teased, the relief making him feel playful and giddy. Harry wasn’t just using him for great sex.
“Ms Davis, we’re very busy and while I appreciate your interest I find it hard to believe you can be of any use to me that Theo or Millie can’t.” Leo drawled his eyes ran up and down her body thoughtfully before he raised a cool brow, “No nothing useful.”
“I can tell,” He panted trying to slip free and move them into the room.
“That’s not how this is going to work Draco,” Harry scowled, annoyed at the older boys emotional retreat. “I don’t care if you’ve never been in a relationship before. Like you with my virginity, it actually makes me feel a little smug being your first.”
Draco blinked as they stopped before the statue of the one-eyed witch, red flags waved frantically in his head, “Um L, Leo?”
Ron jumped, startled before quickly folding the sheet and shoving it in his pocket, “Coming… Mum.”
“Not today guys, I think I’ll stay in.” Harry sighed before hearing a rustling outside his window, sitting up he switched ears watching the window, “Hey I’ll call you back in a minute.”
Leo turned back to the front tapping his fingers distractedly on the desk in front of him. Professor Snape gave him a pointed look, but continued along with his speech.
Hermione- Carina Aurora Black (Harry's Cousin)
Leo had his head bowed, shoulders tense, “So this is how the game is to be played… alright then.”
Leo crossed his arms glaring at the group coldly. Carina shivered at the chilly gaze before nodding, “you’re right.” Leo narrowed his eyes at her so she quickly tried to calm him, “you’re absolutely right Boss. We lost sight of the main goal, and it’s completely unacceptable.”
“Because Draco’s never looked at anyone the way he looks at you.” Mikhail responded instead, shrugging like it was obvious.
2) Rozzo- Uncouth
Draco froze eyes widening in shock as he
Hermione and a red haired girl exchanged amused looks, “Sounds about right, I’m Ginny Weasley by the way.” The same calculating gleam in her eyes, Draco could understand their caution. He was a Malfoy after all. No matter how much he didn’t want to be.
Wiping sweat from his brow, Harry frowned when he saw a medium sized box in the far corner covered in a thick layer of dust, he hadn’t seen it before. Curious he walked over and crouched down before it. Gently he whipped the dust and pried open the lid to look curiously at the contents, shifting through it he found an old worn photo album, two lockets, a velvet box, a diary, and another thick leather book that was unmarked save for the imprint of a Lily on the cover. Harry raised an eyebrow and set the box aside to hide in his room, he’d look through it later.
“Oh, I’m sure you don’t.”
“Do you have lube?” Harry asked as he finally pulled away, lids hooded.
“You shouldn’t be as handsome as you are.”
“What are you doing here?” Draco gasped, pulling away quickly from Harry, still clearly shaking. “Don’t look- Merlin, Potter, get out!”
“That’s enough, both of you!” Slughorn marched over and yanked them both by their cloaks. He grabbed the last vial out of Harry’s hand as he pushed them towards the door. “Mr. Malfoy, you will go to Madam Pomfrey to make sure that the potion doesn’t harm your skin. And then you are to go to Headmistress McGonagall immediately afterward! The same goes for you, Mr. Potter. Now get out!”
Harry turned and met the eyes of Magorian, leader of the centaurs.
Draco and Harry scrambled away from each other as Draco threw his pants on, trying to look presentable as he pushed his hair back with his hands. Harry, on the other hand, quickly shut himself in the bathroom, heart pounding.
“What were you reading?” Harry asked, changing the subject.
Harry cleared his throat, looking away.
Whatever, Harry thought. He wasn’t worth it, he just had to keep telling self that. He wasn’t worth it he wasn’t worth it he wasn’t worth it he wasn’t worth-
"Okay let's see oh here we are your Mothers’ name was Violet Evans,”
The two girls ran from store to store dragging their two unwilling captives when Lyra stopped outside a store for glasses.
“The only Slytherin here willing to show you the way to the dorms,” The onyx haired teen drawled smoothly. Draco arched a brow cautiously, before replying.
Petunia glared at him looking unimpressed, "It's a flower boy don't be Daft!" she snapped.
Shivering in revulsion Draco pushed away from the wall and stomped out of the Library to see if he could find a hole or something to hide in until he graduated, hopefully Smith wouldn’t get held back or anything and they’d go their separate ways.
Carina tensed, feeling a small amount of fear when Zabini’s cold dark eyes bore into hers.
Harry jerked the phone from his ear, “Ron no need to yell remember what we talked about?”
Hermione chewed her lip anxiously, “I’m having a bit of trouble with my homework… I know you’re not really familiar with the subjects… but maybe you could sit down and try and make sense of it with me?”
After slowly leading the boy around the pond a few times, Leo smiled as he quickly gained balance and became steady on his feet, his delighted smile lighting up his face. Before he knew it the boy was darting all around the pond racing circles around him as he stood watching.
Leo could hear his blood rushing in his ears, when he saw the other boy’s glass explode in his hand. Jumping up the boy shook his hand wildly to dislodge any glass. Malfoy stepped back quickly looking startled. His eyes immediately met Leo’s across the table and a scowl formed on his full pouty lips. Leo smirked, that would teach the little tart, turning back to Julian who was looking at him funnily.
Julian had gone for a big change. Dying his hair a dark red, and using a potion to tan his skin until his freckles disappeared. Lifting weights until he was built like an athlete. He looked so different, good but different.
To be honest though, if only to himself as he’d never admit it out loud, Potter and Prewitt weren’t bad company at all. They weren’t even afraid of him, cautiously guarded (wisely so), but not afraid. For that at least Blaise could respect them. The newly discovered pureblood Carina, while a bit high strung (Much like his cugina Sofia), was quiet bold and witty with a wicked hand for curses when angered. Lyra however, a smirk teased at corners of his lips, the girl was intriguing to say the least.
Sam faltered scratching his neck awkwardly, "Um, Hi..."
Harry felt like he’d been slapped, he never wanted Draco to feel like he couldn’t say no to him, he didn’t want to be that kind of boyfriend, “Of course it would,” He grabbed Draco’s wrist trying to pull him closer.
Leo found a relatively untouched rock, brushing the snow from it he sat pulling Draco into his lap, they sat in silence just watching the faeries dance and play.
“Malfoy hmm,” She eyed the blonde appraisingly for a moment.
Draco relaxed slightly, “What’s there to tell?”
“Oma… Opa… I see you’ve met Draco,” he managed to keep his voice level, though he knew if he were to release his Boyfriends hand from the death grip he had it in, his hands would be shaking violently.
Leo nearly jumped out of his skin when a paper broomstick struck him in the ear. Subtly glancing around Leo noticed something strange. Malfoy was sitting in the row across from him taking notices instead of sitting in the front harassing other students. Weird.
The red head was staring at him in concern, “Forgot my bag,… Draco you’ve got to tell the Headmaster.”
“Not the point,” Harry hissed pouting at his supposed Boyfriends back. They walked in silence until they reached the Town Square, where everything ‘fun’ was located. He frowned as he was lead into a pizza parlor. This definitely wasn’t the cinema, “Draco?”
Theo and Millicent leaned forward eagerly. “What’s phase one boss?” Millicent asked excitedly.
Pusni ya!- Let her go!
“Hardly,” Blaise scoffed relaxing minutely, “One of my Mother’s less unsavory lovers was a secret fan of Muggle Movies… and you?”
Nearly a month passed with no word on His Dad. Harry was worried yes, but he didn’t dwell on it long. He had Remus, Sirius, and Draco to distract him. Sirius and Remus stayed in the Guest room and Draco came over first thing in the morning only leaving when it was time for bed usually around eleven or eleven thirty. Harry was happy to see him getting along with his godfathers, even going so far as to start a prank war with Sirius.
He didn’t even look up as he nodded, “Alright.”
"Leo…wait a second please," Draco was able gasp out while he continued to moan as the other boy slowly pumped his fingers in and out of him. It was getting hard to breathe for the blonde.
Leo silenced him with a searing kiss, “You and Zabini will be joining me and my family for the Winter Holiday’s. He wrote your Parents already, but we’ll speak again before then. I haven’t forgotten Love.”
Thank you all for your support! You're all amazing! I truly hope no one was disappointed by the length of this chapter. I promise the next one will be longer!
Draco’s eyes caught Leo’s for a moment before he turned his head moving toward the Slytherin Table. His fellow students there avoided eye contact with him. Most were too afraid of being Leo’s next ‘Target’.
“Tracy wanted to speak with you, care to join us?” Leo drawled off handedly, ignoring Tracy’s almost too obvious look of gratitude.
"You're a Pureblood Harry." Petunia informed him, as if she were telling him it would rain later. She brushed her fingers loving over Lily and Violet’s faces. When she'd opened the Album he didn't know, all he knew was that she’d just completely altered his reality, and she didn’t even seem to realize it.
“Well that’s one way to do it I guess,” Hermione mumbled rubbing her forehead as if staving off a headache.
“We already had dinner Malfoy,” Leo smirked effortlessly scaling the statue so they were face to face, “But I’d be more than happy to buy you anything you want love.”
“Huh?” Draco asked dumbly.
Carina blushed to her roots looking shocked at Leo's bold and inappropriate statement.
Draco cut him off musing out loud, “That doesn’t seem very sensible text books are heavy and the first years don’t know the weightless charm yet. Do they give you time between classes to fetch your books?”
“It’s alright,” Malfoy lifted his head enough that Leo could see a weak smile, but not enough to see his eyes. “Have a nice day… Leo.” And he walked off, he just walked off.
Draco raised an eyebrow, glancing back at the other boy, “It’s your name isn’t it?”
The blonde paused glancing warily at the door before looking confidently back at Harry, “He’s not here. And if I remember correctly, neither is your Mum.”
Harry fought back an amused smile, “In Draco’s defense, Sirius turned his hair pink yesterday, and spiked his meatloaf with a yodeling potion.”
“Oh,” Pansy startled, a light blush painting her cheeks. “I was just passing.”
Julian smirked, check, “Malfoy.”
Julian walked away ignoring the sniffling and curses from the girls behind him, weren’t they just fighting? Why did girls have to be so bloody confusing?
Leo paused, “I don’t like you Malfoy, that’s not going to change just because you find me attractive.” He continued on his way back to the castle, much to Draco’s annoyance. He hoped S.B. could help him. Because it seemed he may need more than Leo’s friends were willing to give.
Pansy groaned rubbing her eye sleepily, “It’s been a half hour, I could’ve slept for thirty more minutes.” She complained.
Leo scoffed, rolling his eyes in disgust, “I’d bet my left nut, more than half of those books in the restricted section were acquired illegally.”
Blaise glanced at him out of the corner of his eye, “He’s not dead.” Blaise raised a brow as if to say ‘Yet.’
Draco released a pitiful groan, while he knew Leo question was an honest one he really didn’t like the slightly mocking undertone. And while he was absolutely terrified of finally losing his virginity…
Millie sighed threading her arm around his and leading him away from the scene. “I guess this is progress, you’re not ripping anyone’s head off unnecessarily.”
Now for the explanation. To start... well I got married. Now before anyone starts congratulating me, please dont. As I may have said in a previous announcement I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a long time, and to be honest I didnt realize how much of that came from my significant other. He didnt like me writing and how much time I spent on it. He didnt like the clothes I wore or the friends I kept around. I spent so much time burying my head in the sand and telling myself he was simply worried about the effect the negative comments had on my mental health that I didnt realize what was happening. I'm happy to announce that as of march 16th the divorce is final and I've officially been no contact since... so why haven't I updated. Well to be honest it's been hard getting back into writing, theres so much I want to say with my writing and aside from working on my own original works I've also got so many new ideas, but The Lie in your Truth is very close to my Heart, but it's also been so long since I was allowed to work on it in peace and I feel like there are so many plot holes that dont link up and i also feel like so much is missing from what I've already posted. So I hope you all will forgive me... but I'm going to be rewriting this story, I plan to continue it yes, but I feel like theres more to Leo and his friends that needs to be said.
Leo didn’t know what to do. He tried apologizing again, but that got him nowhere. Theo said it was probably because he kept making excuses and blaming Malfoy. Leo thought that was a load of crap… it was also probably true. But it WAS Malfoy’s fault. If he hadn’t been such a prat all these years Leo wouldn’t hate him so much. NOW he was making Leo feel like an asshole just for speaking his mind. NOT that he meant to speak his mind. But seriously what ever happened to the truth shall set you free? That was the biggest load of crap yet. Leo was in the dog house for it.
Kleiner- Little one
“I think your attractive, and quiet talented on a broom. I don’t think I know you well enough to fancy you.” Harry admitted shrugging.
Daphne flushed, glancing at her friend quickly, “Professor Flitwick has suggested the possibility.”
Leo handed over the three measures of doxy eggs. Malfoy carefully added them to the potion, “Three measures of dragon thoraxes please.”
"Leo?" Carina called looking worried. She hoped she hadn’t ruined things with her cousin. She’d only just found out they were related! Carina didn’t HAVE to pursue Nott. She could get over it, honest she could, and she would if only he’d promise to stay!
Mikhail cocked a brow at him before looking at Orion, “Well alright then. A simple promise not to hurt him would have sufficed. But a declaration mixed with a subtle threat will do as well… I guess.”
(See the end of the chapter for
noticed Leo’s predicament. “Oh.”
Draco eyed him nervously for a moment breathing heavily, “How old are you?” He demanded.
"A bit?" Lyra raised an eyebrow skeptically.
“Please… more,” Harry gasped, dropping his head as he fought to breathe. He was feeling very warm, and their position was very intimate. Draco’s manhood pressed firmly against his cheeks, as if begging for entrance. “Draco!”
“It’s an Enochian Sigil said to have been taught to my Ancestors in the early 1300’s,” Leo explained, while buttoning his shirt again. The spell seemed to break and Draco leaned back, flushing in embarrassment. “It protects my body from unwanted intrusions. For example, Occlumency has become second nature. The imperious curse is nullified. Nothing and no one can control me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Amelia reached up to pat his cheek, “You’re a Good Boy Draco, and you are kind to my Harry, I’m more than happy to return that kindness.”
Cho huffed angrily dropping back into her seat, while Cedric slowly returned to the Hufflepuff table, both sending an uncaring Mikhail accusatory looks.
Harry squirmed impatiently in his seat, craning his neck as if he might spot a familiar blonde head near the door.
"Great and we can pick out knew glasses for you for reading." Lyra grinned, seemingly pleased that she’d won again.
Malfoy nodded flipping through his notes until he found the page he was looking for.
Dumbledore eyed him for a second before his calm demeanor returned. He seemed to understand though that something had changed. Julian, Carina, and Lyra stood back allowing Leo to control the situation for now. This was his war to start really.
Blaise and Adrian shook their heads chuckling as they passed Pansy and her nervous soon to be ex minions.
Harry sighed as McGonagall finished her speech, and made a quick beeline for the Boy’s Dorm. The quick shuffling of feet told him his friends were right behind him.
Harry laughed before he proceeded to explain a muggle Television set to the Pureblood.
“Draco.”
"Boss?" Carina asked her hidden concern clear to him in her tone.
Draco scowled as Theo and Millie chuckled, following Julian down the hall how the Library would help him he didn’t know. All that the Library had was books, old maps, and Granger… Draco paused, ‘No’. Debating for a moment Draco finally gritted his teeth and changed direction, he didn’t even know if she’d be there. Granger was spending far less time in the library than usual. Walking in Draco saw Granger and the other girl Leo spent time with sitting at a table quietly. The other girl looked up spotting him. Looking around cautiously she waved him over. As he approached, the girls stood.
Harry grinned as he watched his ‘BOYFRIEND’ climb out his window wink at him then drop out of sight. He struggled to get under his comforter before sighing into his pillow with a goofy grin on his face. He was sooo glad that he moved in next to Draco Malfoy. And also that ‘Malfoy’s Don’t Share!'
Daphne shot the girl an exasperated look from Lyra’s other side, “She obviously wanted to try something new, you could do with a new hairstyle every once in a while, you wear your hair the same every day.” Daphne on the other hand, made it a point to never leave the dorm without her ‘face on’ as she put it. Perfectly styled red, or ‘strawberry blonde’ hair always fell in perfect waves to her chest. Her lightly tanned complexion always flawless, clear blue eyes framed by faultlessly applied makeup. The girl’s modelesque appearance made Millicent sick sometimes. But none of the girls made her feel bad about herself, not like her Mother, so she enjoyed spending time with them even when they argued.
She was wearing a sheer long sleeved gray blouse that barely covered her ass. Not that it mattered as her black and red lace bra and panty set were still on full display. Lyra’s jaw dropped, she’d stood there in basically nothing and no one had said a word. Zabini had even had the gall to check her out!
Daphne twitched nervously, “I seem to catch on quickly yes and I can cast quite a few that many only ever learn after Graduation.”
Draco offered the bird a bit of toast before tossing the rest on his still empty plate. He had a letter to write. Standing up Draco hurried out of the hall and down toward the Slytherin Commons.
Draco scoffs before pulling Harry in for a kiss.
“Why do you think I said you were a bit premature?”
Harry nods and as he stands up to follow Ron out of the hall, he briefly squeezes Malfoy’s shoulder.
Hermione Granger>11:30
“Barely.” Harry groans, stretching slightly before wrapping his arms around Draco. “What was that about?”
Harry knocks on the door and hears murmuring on the other side of the door stop, and the sound of someone coming to the door start.
She nods and grabs her bag, he notices her discreetly wipe her eyes with the back of her hand. Harry grabs his things as well as Malfoy’s abandoned book and bag. He shoulders it all and gestures for Hermione to lead the way.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron’s face flushes in anger. Harry sighs and hopes not for the first time that Malfoy will drop the arrogant tone in his voice and also wonders how Malfoy has survived so long. Harry twitches his wand in a familiar action, and Ron’s wand shoots out of his hand before he has a chance to curse Malfoy.
As they navigate the busy sidewalks, full of people grabbing breakfast and running to work, Malfoy clutches the worn sleeve of Harry’s jumper so as not to get lost in the hustle and bustle of the crowd. It makes Harry feel all warm inside that now Malfoy reaches for his arm without a second thought, when a year ago he would have recoiled at Harry’s touch.
His words don’t seem to sway Draco, so Harry adds, “Hermione and Ron will be there.”
He hears himself ask the question as though from a great distance. Fleur turns back to the pot without answering, but Mrs. Weasley takes pity on him.
Malfoy raises his head sleepily from his pillow and looks at Harry. “You do know Granger isn’t normally at breakfast right? And even if she is I have no desire to get in another fight with her deranged boyfriend.”
When they get back to Harry’s flat, Harry quickly calls Kreacher who appears instantly and does not seem at all surprised to see Draco there, nor shocked by the fact that the two boys are holding hands.
“What do you think I’ve been doing all year?” Draco mutters, and shuts the door.
Malfoy glances up from Harry’s chest and uses his unoccupied hand to prop his head up.
Harry laughs once, loud and bright, before Draco pulls his mouth back to his and they stumble blindly for the bed.
With some guidance from Malfoy’s hands, Harry finds himself straddling Malfoy’s lap and kissing his neck.
Harry tenses and waits for Draco to say something, but when he looks at the other boy, Draco is pale and his eyes are pleading as they look at his mother. Narcissa either doesn’t notice and can’t respond the way Draco needs, so Harry starts talking.
Draco sits up so that they’re face to face and hardly a breath apart. Harry kisses Draco once more, softly. He’s not worried about telling Draco. He’s known how he feels for a while, he just hopes Draco feels the same way.
He puts all the nice letters on the coffee table by the couch and quietly incinerates the rude ones without a second thought. He then proceeds to cross the room, and silently lift the edge of the comforter before crawling into bed.
Harry looks at it in horror, knowing this appears one sided, when in reality Draco’s hand had been splayed across Harry’s lower back beneath the coat. That Draco, had just said something incredibly vulnerable and sweet and that Harry was just responding in kind.
Draco leans into Harry’s hand slightly, shoveling another forkful of food into his mouth before saying, “Ya, ya I love you too Potter.”
Harry desperately wishes Hermione would stay, but he nods when Ron asks her to go. Clearly, whatever Ron needs or wants to say is something he’d rather only Harry hear.
“Just made a stupid mistake, but ya I’m okay.”
“Merlin Ginny! That’s amazing!” Harry says, pulling her into a hug.
“Is this it Kreacher?” Harry asks, looking for some sort of tapestry to say a password to.
“Where are you going?”
Harry chooses to answer only the last question, “My godson, Teddy.”
- Father would kill me
“You mean what are we doing?” Harry turns to look at Malfoy before answering his question. “We’re gonna do some flying and reminisce about all the times I was better than you and almost knocked you off your broom.”
When he does pause for a breath, Harry tries to speak but Malfoy holds up one hand and says a short, “Not now, Potter.”
“And so once gillyweed has reached the second stage of growth-”
Malfoy jolts at the touch and stands up abruptly, causing the other Slytherins at the table to look over in varying degrees of confusion and interest.
The next morning dawns bright and early, Harry’s phone alarm going off halfway across the room so that Harry is forced to detangle himself from the mess of arms and legs that is Draco Malfoy.
Honestly it’s not the fact that Harry’s experimenting, hell Draco had experimented with Blaise to figure his own shit out, it’s the fact that he’s absolutely infatuated with Harry so if Harry decides this isn’t for him, Draco's heart is going to break.
Malfoy grimaces at this but nods, “Ya they’ll probably be fine to practice with your team.”
Hermione looks at him and he notices that there’s a slight twitch at her lips before she says, “Harry, he’d be mad not to love you.”
“Yes to Hogwarts you blithering idiot. If you don’t want to be an auror, or at least not yet, are your ghosts the only thing that’s stopping you? Granger is there and so is McGonagall. So you could get alternative lesson plans or altered schedules to fit your needs. Hell, I’m even there if you really wanted it.”
“What even took so long?” He sneers, pushing past Harry to get to the bathroom. “It’s not like you style your hair or anything.”
“Yes Professor.” Ron replies, getting to his feet and following Mcgonagall out of the great hall, whispers follow Ron as he exits.
*  *  *
“Filch is gonna find us in here, Malfoy.” Harry protests.
“Yes Hermione.” Harry says his eyes closed, trying to summon patience.
Ron grunts that Hermione is indeed home, she just needs a minute to get changed into her pajamas.
This has him on his feet with his wand in hand in an instant, prepared to cast an expelliarmus if need be. He hears mumbled cursing, a couple chairs screech and what sounds like a bag dropping to the ground.
Molly stills and turns to look at him from where she was rooting around for some food to give him.
“Reading are we, Potter?” Draco mumbles, stretching before shimmying up slightly so his face is beside Harry’s on the pillow.
“Oh the fact that it will drive Ronald absolutely mental also has its perks. Perhaps I can write another quidditch song in Ginny's favour.”
It’s fucking screaming at him when Harry comes back from his talk with Weasley. He’s surprised Harry doesn’t hear it when they’re nose to nose, breathing each other’s air.
Without another word, Harry stands up and grabs Draco’s hand to pull him up after him. Draco follows wordlessly, and shrugs his coat on in the kitchen while Mrs Weasley hugs Harry and tells him to visit anytime.
Malfoy rolls his eyes and says something along the lines of, “Sure entrust the man who grew up in a cupboard to know what’s good for children.” But Harry isn’t really listening anymore.
Harry swallows and Malfoy looks on with disgust, his eyes following the food down his throat before flitting back to Harry’s eyes.
Harry shrugs and swallows some more pasta salad before answering.
“What else would it be Hermione?” Harry shouts, his yell echoes in the empty stone hallway and with effort he brings his voice back down to a normal level. “What else would it be?”
Harry laughs and flies directly at Malfoy, so the other boy has to dodge out of his way.
“Come on Potter we’ve got potions to get to.”
Draco couldn’t actually believe that last night had happened at all. How often does one end up making out and spending the night with their longtime schoolboy crush? And how often does that crush look delighted to see you in the morning? Draco has been imagining waking up next to Harry for the better part of his teen years. He's daydreamed it down to the finest detail.
*  *  *
“You’re okay. That was okay. We’re home and everything is fine.”
Draco looks at him for a moment, his eyes tracking all over his face before saying, “You’re not the one looking at you. You look awful.”
Harry doesn’t turn, used to the constant talking at this point, and ducks further down in his spot.
Ron scans Harry’s face with a quick searching look, before scoffing and shaking his arm out of Harry’s grip, “I always do mate, calm down.”
Malfoy is asleep on his chest, one arm draped lazily around Harry’s middle, mouth open and drooling onto Harry’s shirt.
Harry smiles stiffly and crosses the room to shake the two older boys’ hands, “Alright Bill? Charlie?”
“Okay.” Draco says, clearly not knowing how to help with this one but doing his best. “The thing is, you can’t help everyone all the time Potter. That’s not your job, and even if it was it’s wildly unrealistic. Besides,” He says shifting slightly and grabbing Harry’s hand to lace their fingers together, “I’m right here and I’m completely capable of saving myself.”
Harry thinks for a second before saying, “So you called me? Weren’t you supposed to be having dinner with your mom tonight?”
But how is it possible to explain to Ginny how when he is with Draco all the fragments of his broken life come together to make a clear picture? How when he’s with Draco he actually can think of a future where he’s happy?
Harry rolls his eyes at that and says, “That’s what I told Hermione, but she seems to think differently.”
The next morning dawns before either of the boys are ready for it. They fell asleep some time before three, both of their phones still buzzing with notifications.
His hair is a mess and he has huge bags under his eyes, but he doesn’t look as upset as he had the day before. Harry crosses the kitchen and holds his arms up. Draco walks into them immediately, wrapping his own arms around Harry’s middle and tucking his face into Harry’s neck.
God, how does Draco expect him to be any help when he looks like this? A soft gray beanie tugged over his distractedly perfect hair, making his eyes stand out in the best possible way.
Hermione Granger>10:30am
Harry smiles at the wicked grin on Ginny’s face, happy to see something so like the old her shining through. Before he can say anything, he feels Draco come up behind him.
“What the hell Potter?” You can’t just fucking disappear on me like that.”
“Hmm.” Harry says, pushing his nose against Draco’s neck. “I’ll just wear something of yours, that way no one can say I look like shit.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry sits with this for a moment and another text rings through from Hermione.
He’s been having a hell of a time with one of his essays. It’s supposed to be a comparison between two healing potions, but he keeps misspelling their names. He's begged Hermione to write his thesis for him but she insists that she had too much work to mark from Flitwick’s class. Harry then turns to Draco and pleads for him to help him. It turns out that now that him and Draco are dating he has far more tools at his disposal (Malfoy will agree to almost anything if Harry gives him cuddles and agrees to sneak them out to the quidditch pitch under his cloak).
Harry pauses again in feeding Teddy and lets the baby grab the piece of pancake off the fork and transfer it to his mouth.
A little present for all of you guys <3
Gritting his teeth, Harry prepares for the worse.
The boys finish and place their forms on a nearby table. Harry watches as Draco calmly pulls the sleeve up over his arm, neatly keeping his eyes focused on anywhere but the dark mark. Harry casually leans forward and grabs Draco’s right hand.
Harry wakes up to morning sunlight streaming directly into his eyes because Malfoy insisted they sleep with the curtains open to “see the night sky.” Harry thinks Malfoy couldn’t care less about the night sky, but he has always delighted in any idea that makes Harry squirm.
“It’s 7 o’clock in the bloody morning Potter, I thought a midnight snogging session would hold you off until 9:30 at the very least.”
“You have no idea,” Malfoy pants, “How long I’ve wanted to do that.”
“Pretty sure that’s my sweater, Potter.”
Draco’s breath hitches and his hands twist aggressively in Harry’s jumper, but his voice is surprisingly steady when he says, “I needed them to know that I don’t care if they don’t like me, but I also needed them to know that my plans for us don’t include heartbreak.”
After and hour, Luna looks at a watch on her wrist and says, “Well Harry, our time is up for today I’m afraid, but I think it’ll be good for you to come see me once a week for a while. Is there any day that works best for you?”
Malfoy shakes his head. “No, not here anyways. I don’t trust myself to hold him just yet.”
Harry is too busy scooping porridge into his bowl to notice the genuine smile growing on Malfoy’s face.
Harry takes a moment to look around while Draco talks to the lady at the front desk. The walls are alternating dark red and black, and absolutely covered in names and messages written in sharpie. Thousands of people who visited the shop had left names and messages in silver and gold ink. It reminds him of the magic sign outside the destroyed house in Godric’s Hollow. Harry steps closer to the wall to read the names, but before he can get very far, Draco is grabbing his hand.
“Surely Miss Granger told you that she tested out of everything? She was finding the work too easy. She’s finishing off the rest of the year as a teaching assistant for Professor Flitwick.”
Harry knocks his head against Draco’s slightly and whispers back, “I know. But you’re doing great.”
“It’s the first week of October Potter,” Malfoy interrupts. “It’s not that late. Besides Granger and I already have altered coursework to make up for the fact that we have a whole year of magical experience on the others. It wouldn’t be hard to alter yours.”
Harry changes directions, neatly avoiding bowling Fleur and Charlie over, before coming to a stop in front of Mrs Weasley and once again tucking Draco into his side.
The night goes on in much the same way. Harry sees people he hasn’t seen for months, and they all act normal around him and Draco. He has a sneaking suspicion that it has to do with the huge volume of alcohol being consumed by the party, but he doesn’t really mind.
Malfoy grabs Harry’s hand and doesn’t let go, “I’m better than you at least.”
Harry takes a breath and steps away from Draco, taking his hand and walking in the direction of the Great Hall. “It could have gone better, but not the worst possible reaction.”
“Do you want to hold him?” Harry asks, shifting Teddy into a more comfortable position.
“That’s on me Professor, I wanted to eat breakfast here, and-”
Suddenly the point of view is switched and he can see himself. Drowning, motionless. Well known faces appear around him. Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, Cedric, his parents, Fred. It’s them, but they’re rotten and wrong and here to hurt not help.
“I’m a cold person.” Draco mutters, pushing the tip of his cold nose into Harry’s neck.
He takes a few steps backwards and away from Granger saying, “Don’t be stupid, Potter couldn’t dress me if he tried.”
But it’s hard to feel hopeful when the Daily Prophet still picks apart his every move. When his ex-girlfriend now attends therapy 2 times a week. When Harry can barely get 8 hours of sleep without waking up at least once, plagued by Voldemort’s eerie taunting and Fred’s body on the floor of the Great Hall. Is someone as ruined as him even meant to have love?
They use the floo network and shoot out one after the other into Mcgonagall’s office. Harry’s trunk knocks painfully against his legs as he stumbles towards Mcgonagall’s desk, and he scowls at Malfoy when he sees him laughing.
“Ooh sausages.” Ron says giddily.
“Draco now is it, Harry?” Rita says, hurrying to keep up, he heels clicking obnoxiously against the floor, “If I remember correctly you two weren’t this close before the war, what changed? Are you so damaged that you’re actually attracted to those who once fought against you? And here I was thinking you were the golden boy of the public, when really you have much darker tastes.”
“Wait,” says Harry waving the Barista off when she asks what he wants. “Is that a yes to living together?”
Harry feels his heart sink in his chest. Harry and Ginny had broken up after about a month of being back together after the war. It was too much, she said. It was her not him, she said. But finally one morning she looked him in the eye and told him that every time she looked at him, everytime he walked into a room, she saw Fred lying lifeless in the Great Hall.
“Well, he’s certainly not who I would have picked for you to be with, but as long as you’re happy dear, I can be happy for you.”
Harry had been watching Malfoy’s reaction to Hermione and taking note that he had flushed when she accused him of being oblivious to other people. He wonders why Malfoy gets so upset about people calling him oblivious. He then realizes that Hermione had asked him a question and turns to answer her.
These are all things you do with someone you love, someone you’re dating.
“Well, that was awful.” Draco says, breaking the fraught silence.
“Well I called Blaise first, just to tell him about the news breaking. He already knew about us.”
Harry turns slowly to see Rita Skeeter standing not too far from him, her quick quotes quill already speedily writing at her side.
“Hello?”
“No, Harry says, struggling into a pair of boxers from the floor, “But we know the pictures are out, so what?”
“You did!” Harry says, his voice pitching up slightly. “As soon as she asked if Teddy was yours-”
“He just gets it Neville. I don’t know how to explain it any better than that.”
Malfoy’s eyes narrow but he says nothing in response to the manor jab.
“What, Potter?” Draco asks, running his fingers along Harry’s jaw, tracing his lips.
Draco makes to pull Harry along, but Harry pulls him back into a kiss, and wraps his arms about Draco’s middle. Draco’s hand comes up to cup Harry’s face, and Harry allows himself to forget everything for a moment while he’s kissing Draco.
Draco looks back down at the menu, seemingly noticing for the first time both the prices and lack of edible food for babies.
“Alright mate,” Ron says, running his hand absently through his hair, “I just wanted to let you know that I’m sorry for hitting you, but I’m not sorry for why I did it. Malfoy is scum Harry.”
By the time he’s down the stairs Malfoy is already a ways ahead of him. And Harry jogs to catch up.
“Well I don’t know what I’m gonna get then.” Harry says.
Yet, as Harry straightens the movement catches Narcissa’s eye and she turns and casts a semi disgusted look in Harry’s direction. Some things may never change.
“God, you’re thick.” Draco mutters before pulling him in for a kiss.
Harry visibly grimaces at the memory, he could still feel the stares of his fellow customers as they eagerly watched Cho tear into him.
It also doesn’t help that the Slytherins are on the other side of the pitch which distracts both Harry and his team, though for completely different reasons.
“We’ll walk Draco. We can use warming spells and spells to keep the rain off, you have your wand right?”
“It’s the weekend,” protests Malfoy. “Literally one of my two days off from that place, and you want me to go back so you can tour the place you’ve been attending school for the past 7 years?” he draws in a breath, “Merlin, I’ve changed my mind, you shouldn’t go back, my life is difficult enough without having to tutor the boy who lived on top of everything else-”
Harry smiles in return. “It’s no problem, but I should probably get back to Teddy and Malfoy, have a great night.”
Harry can feel Draco rolling his eyes behind him as he heads off to the shower. He intentionally uses Draco’s shampoo and body wash, just to spite him, before standing out in front of the wardrobe. He honestly has no idea what to wear.
“So I see you finally made a move.” She announces quietly with a chuckle.
In the silence that follows, Harry reaches for Malfoy’s hand and squeezes. Malfoy squeezes back but releases quickly before Andromeda enters the room.
“Right sorry Neville, I’ve actually got to hit the loo, catch up later ya?” Harry dashes away hurriedly. Neville had cornered him 15 minutes ago, and although Neville is one of his really good friends, his love of herbology knows no bounds and Harry isn’t nearly drunk enough the deal with that conversation.
Harry is puzzled by the letter for a brief moment before he recognizes Andromeda’s shaky handwriting on the front. He tears into the letter eagerly hoping for some more recent pictures of Teddy, instead he finds a quick letter asking if he’s free for the weekend to watch Teddy.
Without a backward glance Harry mounts his broom and shoots off into the sky. He hears a muffled curse from Malfoy, but it isn’t long before the other boy joins him in the air. Harry lets out a whoop of joy and pulls the broom handle up, urging it to go higher and faster. It’s certainly no firebolt, this broom is old and slow and wonky, but it’s still flying and with the wind stinging his eyes he realizes, that’s enough for him. He manages to pull off a few decent loop de loops before he hears a laugh from Malfoy below and looks down.
It dawns on him that Malfoy had been in the middle of a sentence. “Sorry I didn’t catch what you said.”
“Jesus,” Harry snorts, “You’re ridiculous.”
The question stumps Draco, “What?”
At first Harry doesn't realize what Draco is saying, but with a fair amount of horror Harry realizes that Draco is saying he knows what the cruciatus curse feels like.
“Hey,” Harry says softly, tilting his head slightly. “Are you coming back to the room soon?” His voice is groggy, a half whisper. His eyes crinkled from sleep and lacking their usual glasses.
Draco finds himself saying the stupidest things around Potter. I mean, for Christ’s sake, he’s dined with the Dark Lord, he knows all about composure and appearance, but one look into those green eyes and he finds all logic going out the window. He inwardly cringes at the memory of this morning, Harry all rumpled and warm, just getting out of bed, inviting Draco to breakfast.
“Ron and Hermione want us to come for dinner this week.” Harry says instead.
Without waiting for a response or for Draco to catch his breath, Harry takes the last few steps needed and knocks on the door.
Malfoy scowls slightly but good naturedly walks with Harry in the direction of the train station. They make it onto the train with no issues except for Malfoy having trouble with the concept of an escalator, (“Muggles have moving staircases too?”).
Harry hums but doesn’t give an actual answer, content to just stand with Draco and wait for their food.
“I’m sorry,'' he says. “I didn’t mean for it to turn into a fight, I was just curious.”
“Draco and I have been working together all term. He’s had plenty of opportunities to hurt me and he hasn’t. I’m going back to school, and you can figure out your anger on your own time Ronald.”
“Yes, Malfoy. I said I would, didn't I?” Harry responds irritably.
He can feel Malfoy’s eyes on him, and for a moment he feels guilty at the implication that he doesn’t want to work with Malfoy. He tries to shake it off. Mcgonagall raises an eyebrow at him.
Harry squints at Draco, “You’re really desperate to go out tonight, aren’t you?”
Monday morning dawns bright and early and Harry is awake and in his robes by 6am. Making sure he has enough spare shirts, trousers and other necessities packed to hold him off until he returns to his flat for Christmas. He double checks that he’s remembered his extra tie, then apparates into Malfoy’s bedroom.
“You know what I mean.” Hermione says, turning to stand in front of him so that he has no choice but to stop and look at her. Her hair is coming loose from it’s tight braid, and her cheeks are slightly flushed.
It strikes Harry as funny that Narcissa says she hasn’t given them anything considering she doesn’t know anything about them. But before he can say anything Draco starts talking.
Harry begins to open his mouth in defense when he hears Malfoy reacting behind him.
He twists their hands together in full view of the reporter and says, “Nothing too fancy yet, we will be attending the Gryffindor reunion together soon though.”
“Hi Ginny.”
“What did Granger say, Potter?” Malfoy asks again, tugging gently on Harry’s tie.
What follows is utter silence on the other end of the phone, and Harry feels the need to kick himself after the slip up he’d just made. Surely, Hermione would have liked to surprise Ron with her assistant position. Harry can practically hear hermione mentally scolding him through the phone.
Harry isn’t quite shocked by Draco’s reaction, but he desperately needs him to explain why this is bothering him so much.
When they both stand up to go to potions, Harry jostles Draco’s shoulder with his own.
To highlight his point a group of first year Gryffindors come giggling up to the table to ask for his autograph. Malfoy sneers and rolls his eyes in response, while Hermione hides a laugh behind her hand and Harry tries to politely decline. The Gryffindor’s finally turn away after Malfoy threatens to use them as his next transfiguration project. After this is dealt with Harry turns back to Hermione.
Harry smiles and claps Neville on the shoulder. He turns back to find Draco sitting on a street bench with Luna and Teddy, attempting to feed Teddy some of the peas while Luna holds him. Harry smiles at the sight.
“It looks like Professor Lupin’s old office.”
But what will he get Andromeda? What do you get a grandma figure who helps pull you out of your occasional bouts of spiraling depression? He’s honestly clueless, and may need to ask Hermione for some help.
“Mmmm,” muses Harry, content in their current position. “If I can’t tease you, what’s left, Malfoy?”
Malfoy shakes his head again, as if tired of pointing out obvious things.
“What?” He asks, straightening his robes and tie, “What do you need help with.”
Groaning, Malfoy looks at Harry and then says, “You do know that we’ll be living together right? Torturing me this early is only going to make your life miserable in the long run.”
Draco tucks himself into Harry’s side like a comma while saying, “I had to tell the lovely Miss Granger that we weren’t doing class today. She took that as a personal offence and decided to show up at our door.”
Harry shrugs non-committedly, and Draco sighs and mumbles, “You are absolutely no help whatsoever.”
“You’re disgusting you know.” he hears himself say.
Harry refrains from saying that where he really pictures Malfoy living is a gothic manor surrounded by a moat filled with dangerous creatures for sacrifice. He’s incredibly proud of himself for his self restraint. Malfoy seems hesitant to answer, but also seems to know that Harry won’t leave him alone until he tells the truth.
Draco sighs but pulls his wand out, and looking around to check that no one is watching, spells them warm and dry.
“Potter!”
In his heart he knows that it’s because Draco doesn’t expect him to be some fantastic, world saving, intelligent, emotionally mature hero. Draco takes Harry as is. Panicking, unsure, lost, afraid and sometimes breaking. None of it scares Draco away because it isn’t like he’ll ever be disappointed by Harry being his most true self. It’s almost good that he and Draco didn’t get along for so long, Draco has no reason to believe he was any different than he is now. He supposes it might also have to do in part to the fact Malfoy is now babbling at Teddy and making flying car noises as he scoops food into teddy’s mouth. Harry catches himself staring in pure admiration.
*  *  *
“Okay what?” Harry asks.
For the second time that night he’s cut off mid sentence.
*  *  *
“So why was it you brought me here again?”
His father had walked in and walked back out without saying anything.
After apparating into the flat, Harry tosses his bag carelessly onto the ground and flops face first onto the couch.
Ron nods silently. Hermione keeps looking at him, searching for the cracks in his calm facade. He wishes she wouldn’t.
He begins to drift off, Draco’s hand threading softly through his hair and lips brushing lightly along his neck. The words rise up again in his throat, but he pushes them down. Instead turning his head to kiss Draco’s forehead.
“Malfoy wake up, it’s almost time to go.”
Harry is struggling to keep his eyes open after a while, and knows that he’ll never hear the end of it if they sleep on the couch, so he brushes his fingers gently over Draco’s jaw and mumbles, “Bed?”
After that, they stumble into the flat without breaking apart, clothes coming off with every step. Harry’s shirt gets stuck coming off and Draco growls something that sounds sort of like ‘fucking nuisance’ before ripping it off carelessly and throwing it onto the back of the couch.

Draco nods, seemingly content with this answer. “Do you want to grab lunch at the Leaky Cauldron or something before we head back?”
“Is everything okay?” Blaise asks, still sounding as though he is half asleep.
“-Right?” Draco asks.
Draco tilts his head back against the wall and swallows.
“Although I am delighted to see you Potter, is there a reason that you have decided to visit without announcing yourselves? You do know I only knew you two were here because of the ruckus you caused in the great hall as well as the fact that the broomshed was broken into?”
Draco groans and flops onto his back, eyes finally open, “Don’t remind me.”
“Aw, is Malfoy not a morning person?” Harry teases.
They walk up the stairs in companionable silence, and enter the warm flat to find that Kreacher has left some hot chocolate out for them. Harry silently sends up a prayer of thanks for house elves and their ability to predict his needs so accurately.
Both Malfoy and Harry stare back at Mcgonagall in confusion before Malfoy says, “She never told me she was testing out! I have like three group projects with her.”
“I don’t think so Ron.”
Harry can feel Draco shivering beneath him, and he looks at him incredulously.
For some reason he can feel tears pricking at the back of his eyes, but he shoves it down and squeezes her back tightly.
He needs time to be just Harry, without all the fame and glory, whoever that is. Sighing, Harry gets up and grabs his laptop, phone, and wand and heads out of his apartment. He needs coffee and free wifi. Luckily enough he is within walking distance of both of those in the form of a Starbucks downtown.
“I’m actually doing pretty well.” Harry says, feeling Draco’s thumb brush softly over the back of his hand, “How was your Christmas yesterday?”
“Potter, Malfoy my office now.”
Harry snorts at this and starts shoveling his own food into his mouth.
“‘Shit.” He mutters, before looking anxiously at Harry, “Let’s go before the waiter tries to take our order.”
Draco doesn’t provide an answer besides a kiss on Harry’s neck.
Harry looks back to see that Malfoy’s pale grey eyes are full of worry. This causes Harry to turn back to face him fully. He looks at Malfoy for another moment, shocked by the sadness that he sees in Malfoy’s eyes before answering.
Draco shrugs and turns back to his phone, but Harry can see the flush on his cheekbones.
What, and he could not stress this enough, the fuck. He is Draco Malfoy. He writes fucking songs about how much Weasley sucks and has the whole school singing them, yet when the boy he likes is nice to him he is reduced to the bumbling moron of his nightmares.
Harry quickly shrugs on a shirt and pair of pajama bottoms before venturing out into the cold world outside of Draco’s bed.
The last sentence is barely breathed. All the air seems to be sucked out of the room. Harry holds his breath not wanting to take in more than his fair share.
Enjoy some more of Harry being BIG dumb
With the silence stretching on for a while, Mcgonagall finally says, “You two don’t have to decide now. You can go home and let me know when you two get here Monday.”
Hermione’s shaky voice, fills his ear much closer than before. She must have taken it off speaker phone.
Harry had said of course at the time, but is now wondering if maybe she just needed time to mourn during the first Christmas without her daughter and husband. Either way, they’re at the Weasley’s now and Teddy is excited to see more people.
“Here, here!” Mr. Weasley adds.
Malfoy looks at him again like he’s an idiot.
“Do you want me to come with you?” Harry asks hesitantly, having a hard time reading Draco.
At the sight of Harry still lounged across his sectional, Malfoy throws his hands up in exasperation, “Oh my God Potter, why aren’t you gone yet?”
It gets to the point where Harry finally says, “Will you just take my number, that way I’ll know if I need to save you a seat or not.”
They end up in a restaurant that Draco insists is muggle run, but is close enough to Diagon Alley that witches and wizards frequent it. Harry is unsure about going there, but Draco reminds him that Rita already has pictures of them that could drop at any moment, so it doesn’t really matter. Harry almost drops Draco’s hand when they first enter out of habit, but realizes that he doesn’t have to and squeezes Draco’s hand tighter.
Malfoy swears and snatches his essay up while Harry quickly unties the letter from the bird. The owl takes a moment to drink from another Slytherins cup before spreading its wings and swooping off.
Harry cuts in quickly, “What about Hermione?”
Malfoy looks at him questioningly before saying slowly, “Why not?”
When he turns back, Draco has stood up from the couch still wrapped in a big blanket and is looking at Harry with sad, tired eyes. Harry smiles sadly, and crosses the room, pulling Draco against his chest and into a hug.
“Harry?”
Harry takes a sip of drink but almost spits it out when Draco says, “Already assembling the guest list to our wedding, Potter? I think that’s a bit premature.”
Draco gasps, before tossing the socks to the side and crawling in Harry’s lap, “Take it back! The slander! I’ll never recover from the indignity of being associated with you.”
Draco looks down and sits silently. Harry is rather tired of people being so shitty to Draco and tiptoeing the fuck around him when he is right there.
“They’re gonna hate me.”
“Nah I’ll be alright, I just need some air, I’ll text you and Hermione later.”
“I’ll have you know I’m quite fond of this dump, thank you very much.” Harry says hotly, crossing his arms over his chest.
Another breath, “But I won’t hurt Harry. I love him. And I won’t hurt him. And I just wanted you all to know that.”
I mean for Christ sake, the hand on his thigh feels like a bloody brand and his skin feels hot all over. If this is how he reacts to casual touch how is supposed to make it through the next week with the newfound knowledge of his attraction?
Hermione laughs, “It was hardly sneaking, you guys are just so caught up in each other that you don’t notice anyone else. So, I repeat, what would no one believe Harry?”
"Bloody hell, Potter, sit the hell down before you make a scene!" He whispers harshly.
Harry nods and sits in the chair beside Teddy, resting his head on his one hand.
“Um,” Harry clears his throat. “Andromeda this is Mal- Draco Malfoy. He’s a friend of mine and is going to help me out with Teddy this weekend.”
Malfoy’s arm tenses around Harry slightly before he says, “I really like you too.”
“I could ask you the same thing Malfoy, does the manor not have tea up to your satisfaction?”
Draco shakes his head and looks at Harry, “No. I don’t want you to take my idea.”
Harry ignores Ron’s eyes on him while he waits for Malfoy’s reply. It comes a short breath later in a tense voice.
Her gaze lingers on the hand that had been fisted in Malfoy’s jacket not that long ago. Harry averts his eyes quickly, and feels colour rise to his cheeks, though he isn’t quite sure why.
“Shit,” The voice says, “Shit, Potter it’s Pansy, you need to wake Draco up now.”
Harry shrugs and starts walking out of the counselling wing, “About as well as I expected. It’s hard.”
“Hermione, can’t Malfoy stay?”
*   *   *
Malfoy scoffs, “We’re not friends Potter, I’m just you latest charity case.”
Harry snorts and says, “I don’t have anything posh to wear out Draco-”
“Ya, ya, Potter. Whatever. Just unpack so we can do some homework, I know you dozed off in History of Magic .”
“I wanted to tell you how proud I am of you, for sticking with these talk sessions with Luna.” He casts his eyes to the side for a moment. “I know how hard it can be to open up to other people about what’s going on inside your head. When my mother sent me to a counsellor before school started it was definitely one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done.”
As he turns to leave, Luna pulls him in for one last hug. He feels her lips next to his ear as she whispers so only they can hear “I don’t know if Hermione’s mentioned it but I’m always here to talk Harry, you know I’ve received the proper training and you’re one of my closest friends. It wouldn’t be a burden, no matter what your brain is telling you.”
“Fine.” He says, stealing the almost empty mug back from Harry, “But I don’t think it’s a good idea.”
Draco nods before kissing him again. Harry allows Draco to move him towards the bed, pressing a soft kiss to the place where Draco’s neck and shoulder meet as they fall backwards.
“Yes.” He says simply, meeting her eyes once more. “Yes, I love him.”
Harry thinks, as Malfoy’s tongue sweeps into his mouth,
“Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, Potter, what is the meaning of this?”
Draco looks at him hesitatingly, “Harry. I cannot, in good conscience, show up to the Weasley's house. My family made their lives hell, and they lost a son in the war because of the side I fought on. If you’re going today, it’ll have to be alone.”
Draco snorts, and turns back to the wardrobe, clearly done with the conversation.
“How’s Ron doing?” Harry asks.
*  *  *
“Sallow came by.” Narcissa mentions, glancing carefully at Harry and then back to Draco. “He’s threatening to go talk to your father about all of this.”
“Is this the company you now keep, Draco?” His eyes flit over to Harry, “There have been whispers of course, after you moved out of the manor. You always held so much promise, the Dark Lord’s very own chosen student. What would your father say about this? I doubt he’d approve of you stumbling about with so little regard for your reputation”
Harry looks at her and Ron for a second and debates whether or not to tell them the truth. On the one hand it would be good to have two people know where he is in case it’s a dangerous situation, on the other, for some reason, he’d rather not have Hermione and Ron know he has been spending time with Malfoy. The latter feeling wins the battle in his head, so he lies.
When he almost reaches the door, Draco steps out of the room, phone held to his ear.
Harry laughs slightly at the memory, remembering Malfoy’s shocked face and scream when he realized that Harry was the one doing it.
Draco is nervous. He never used to get nervous. He used to be able to walk into any room and have everyone else hang on his every word. He was untouchable.
Malfoy turns to go, not looking any happier about the situation, and Ron makes to follow him but Harry catches his arm.
“You say that Harry,” Draco starts, opening his eyes and looking into Harry’s stupidly perfect green ones, “But how do you know?”
“Well I already know what I’m going to get. It’s just you who will have to do some contemplation.”
“You look terrible, Potter.”
“Why not?”
Words rise up in Harry that he knows he cannot and most definitely should not say, so instead he says, “I’m just really really glad I have you, and am glad that you were with me this weekend.”
Hermione snorts, “Friends right.” then after a moment, “was it him you apparated to meet last night?”
Harry reads between the lines and understands that Draco desperately would like Harry to come with him but would never ask him to set foot in the manor again.
“Let me clean you up Potter.”
Harry looks across the tavern and sees a witch and wizard, maybe a couple years older than him and Draco. The boy leans over to whisper something in the girls ear, and they both fall over laughing, hands clasped, foreheads touching.
(See the end of the chapter for
When they break apart, breathless, hands roaming each others bodies, Harry rests his head against Draco’s and says, “I have to tell you something.”
Luna had grabbed Draco as soon as they’d walked in with a quick, “Not to worry Draco we’ll stick together with a few of the other non-Gryffindors.”
Harry smiles at that and says, “Something like that, what are you doing homework for?”
Malfoy seems dissatisfied with the lack of kissing and attempts to chase Harry’s lips with his own, “Bloody hell Harry, why’d you stop?”
“Er, no.” Harry responds, sitting down and rubbing his eyes, “This is Harry, Draco is still asleep.”
He allows this thought to nestle in the back of his mind but doesn't want to spend any longer on it tonight. He has his favourite baby and his boyfriend waiting for him. It can wait a little longer.
Harry immediately stops teasing and leans forward to focus on the call.
“Not true.” Malfoy says shaking his head, “I’m a delight to be around.”
Harry had forgotten about yesterday's argument, but it all comes back to him, the disgust in Ron’s voice and the tears in Hermione’s eyes.
“Almost noon.” Harry says, propping himself up somewhat to look at Draco.
Harry looks at Malfoy for a moment before scoffing, “It’s not much different than hanging around with you to be honest, Malfoy.”
“Yes, of course.” Narcissa says, all calm facade and cool words. Harry suddenly realizes where Draco picked up most of his mannerisms from.
“I’m talking about how you clearly wouldn’t be here if you didn’t feel bad for me.” Malfoy says, irrefutable.
“That’s different Potter.” He lets out a deep breath before continuing quietly, “ You’ve known me since we were 11, you’ve had an idea in your head about who I am for years now. These first years hardly know me, this is my chance to make a good impression. I know it sounds silly but these students are the future of our school and I don't want everyone to think of me as just another death eater.”
The hate and fan mail still make appearances, but Harry and Draco decide to throw them all away. The only people whose opinion matters on their relationship is their own.
“What is it now Potter?”
“Well she’s quite good.” Harry says, allowing himself to be pulled out of the pub while waving over his shoulder at Hermione and Ron. He turns back and bumps his shoulder against Draco’s, “I told her we’d be there opening game in her colours.”
Harry, the golden boy. People talk about his greatness, huddled in groups as he walks by, praise follows him wherever he goes. Every Christmas he returns to the Weasley house with the welcoming atmosphere and boisterous activities, he has a family who accepts him unconditionally. Ministry workers and teachers talk to him like an old friend, they seek him for advice. He’s the center of so many universes.
After he and Draco have both hugged Luna goodbye- Draco after some hesitation- the two pairs head in opposite directions, but before Harry and Draco get far, Harry notices that Luna has left her clutch on the bench where her and Draco where feeding Teddy.
“Come on Potter,” Malfoy sighs, “What did he mean?”
“All babies are useless, Harry.” Draco says, kissing Harry on the jaw before stepping away, “Come on, you’re not gonna find anything you need in here.”
He ends up opening Hagrid’s first, knowing that he would never send him anything meant to be unkind. Once again it’s a short message, but it’s full of nice things. Hagrid doesn’t even mention Draco until the end. All that’s written is a quick, “I’m sure you know what you’re doing and I’m glad you’re happy. Send word if you need anything.”
Harry finally looks away from Malfoy and flops around to face the other wall.
At first, the flat had been a sort of summer home for Ron and Hermione, but Hermione had gotten permission from McGonagall to live there throughout the year and use the floo network to get to and from Hogwarts each day.
“Oh shove off, Potter. “ Malfoy responds cheeks pink, “I just didn’t want you to draw even more attention to me than I already get.”
Draco takes a seat at one of the kitchen stools and reaches for Harry’s mug of tea. Harry pushes it to him absently, flipping a pancake with his other hand before turning and looking at Draco across the counter.
Hermione waves him off dismissively before adding, “You even went searching in the grocery store for that chocolate pie-”
It’s nearly impossible to see anything in the dark, but through the cracks lining the door some light enters, and it’s enough to see Malfoy’s hair is rumpled much like his robes and shirt. His eyes are half lidded and his lips swollen and currently pouting.
“Torture!” Harry yells, laughing and struggling to pull away, “I’m being tortured!”
“And how do you suggest I do that Malfoy?”
“No, no, no.” Harry says quickly, grabbing Malfoy’s hand again. Why did he have to be so bad at communicating? “I’m sure about you, but we have to be sure about us before anything goes public because as soon as anyone catches wind of it it’ll be everywhere.”
The end up walking down the well worn trail to Hogsmead, Draco swinging their linked hands between them. He’s talking about nothing important, perhaps the weather? Harry is listening but the words aren’t processing in his brain. He’s too busy noticing how pretty Draco looks with the sun turning his hair silver, the cold making his cheeks and nose a rosy pink. The blue sky is stunning and clear and frames Draco in a way similar to that of a beautiful painting set to a plain backdrop.
“I say you won’t.” Harry says firmly, taking Teddy out of Malfoy’s arms. “He needs a bath… so do you for that matter.”
Hermione Granger>10:31am
“Come back to bed.” Harry says, holding Draco against his chest.
He takes a step back from Malfoy, and something flits across Malfoy’s face before it’s schooled back into his regular sneer.
With that, Draco stands from the chair, allowing his sleeve to fall over the taped up tattoo. The tattoo artist nods quickly and goes about cleaning up everything she used for Draco. Draco calmly pulls Harry over to the wall.
It’s all skin to skin, hot and tempting.
“We’ll be going now, Sallow. Have a good night.” Draco throws a wad of cash on the table, large enough that the tip for the waitress would be huge, and leads Harry out of the restaurant.
“Oi, mate you’re chips are ready, we added some mushy peas on the side for your kid.”
Thursday night draws to a close and finds Harry and Malfoy tangled up in Harry’s bed. Malfoy’s head on his chest and playing with a loose thread on the arm of Harry’s sweater. Harry absently runs his fingers through Malfoy’s hair. It’s entirely too domestic for their non-relationship, but Harry is happy to let it happen.
Back at the castle, Harry expects Draco to lead him to the Great Hall. Instead they walk right past the open doors and instead head for an old classroom that Harry has never been in.
“I’m almost 100% sure that you guys aren’t allowed to do that.” Hermione hisses again. Harry hears a noise that sounds like Hermione trying to get past the door and being rebuffed by Draco. He smiles lightly.
“Okay.” Harry says, closing his eyes and resting his forehead against Draco’s, “We’re gonna be okay.”
“Hey Mate”
As Harry tumbles out of the fireplace, Malfoy’s couch enters his line of sight and he stumbles towards it. Sinking into the cushions and leaning his head back against the soft fabric, Harry thinks about how the flat is already beginning to feel familiar, and Harry isn’t sure how he feels about that. Malfoy provides a sort of escape that no one else can give him. The other boy doesn’t expect anything from Harry, and despite all the bickering and snide remarks they share, Malfoy makes him feel grounded and calm in a way he hasn’t felt in months. Though the circumstances were less than ideal, Harry is glad it was him that Malfoy had called yesterday night with his panic attack. As Harry comes back to his senses and out of thought, he realizes Malfoy has said something.
Malfoy’s eyes slide back to staring at nothing and Harry sets the serving spoon he had been holding down. There’s ice in his tone that hasn’t been there for a long time, Harry almost chalks it up to nerves about quidditch, but he knows Malfoy too well now, and knows that this won’t be about just anything.
“Who says I’ll be attending Potter?”
Distantly Harry hears the jingle of a store bell as the door opens, he silently hopes there’ll be butterbeer in his future.
He can feel her glare trained on the side of his head, but he makes no move to acknowledge her or move from his position.
As he is walking, a familiar glint of white blonde hair catches his eye. Harry stops short. Surely it couldn’t be who he thought it was. It was only wistful thinking, his mind had been full of Hogwarts and pumpkin juice, and was grasping for something familiar. Surely he would never deign to set foot in a muggle restaurant, let alone something as common as a Starbucks.
After a significant portion of the food has been shared by the two boys, Harry packs up the rest and puts it in Malfoy’s fridge with express instructions for him to eat the rest the next day. Malfoy rolls his eyes and mutters something about the chosen one needing a new hobby, but Harry figures Malfoy will do as he said judging by the way he had eaten four pieces of french toast. As he and Malfoy finish up the dishes, Harry decides that he doesn’t want to go home yet and would much rather both Malfoy for the rest of the day. With this new purpose he flops rather dramatically onto the same couch he had fallen asleep on the night before. Malfoy looks up from where he’s sitting reading the Daily Prophet by the window.
“Why exactly did we agree to be the captains this year, Potter? Have I not suffered enough?”
“Alright Ron, I get it, you’d like to put a tracker on me so you and Hermione can know where I am at all times. Speaking of,” he says cutting in again before Ron can, “Is Hermione with you? I need to talk to you guys about something.”
He remembers this morning with the sunlight in Malfoy’s hair, and the wicked twist of his mouth when he was on the quidditch pitch. He thinks of the casual touches that maybe weren’t so casual, and the ever closer beds. His mind finally lands on the morning where they he had been discussing crushes and how his eyes had darted down to Malfoy’s lips.
He glances over at Malfoy to see that the lack of people in the halls had restored Malfoy to the version of himself that he had been out on the quidditch pitch. Not necessarily relaxed, but collected. This thought had barely entered his mind when a group of Gryffindor students he somewhat recognizes catch up and converge on them. Malfoy makes to step away at the first sign of people, but Harry twists his hand into Malfoy’s coat sleeve and holds him in place at his side. Harry does his best to encourage them to leave, and get back to Gryffindor tower but it does no good. He can feel his heart rate beginning to pick up as well as sweat beginning to gather on his lower back and palms. He also notes that Malfoy is beginning to look less and less kept together. He worries for a moment that both of them are going to end up cursing these fourth years away when a familiar voice sounds from above them on the staircase.
Draco watches Harry step into his washroom to have a quick shower before dinner, and once the door closes Draco allows himself to panic for a brief moment.
Before he can think of a response she’s stepping back and hugging her son again. Harry decides to ignore it and takes Draco’s offered hand, not sparing Narcissa a glance before they’re swept into the dark of Draco’s apparation.
What Draco has planned ends up to be flying. It’s freezing and snowy and honestly should be miserable. But the adrenaline soon has Harry feeling much better. And if they kiss midair and Harry imagines the stands roaring their approval? Well who's going to mention it?
“Fine, Potter. It’s not like I have anyone to tell anyways.” Malfoy says finally, looking away and taking a sip of his drink.
“Ya of course! When were you thinking of coming over?”
“While I know many of you have been questioning where I’ve been, I was not ready to tell you all that I had returned to Hogwarts to finish off my eighth year. I thank you for your support and will not be answering any follow up questions at this time”
Without another word, Draco’s hand shoots out and grabs the phone. While Draco handles that call, Harry goes in search of his own cell, which has been ringing non-stop this whole time.
Grumbling, the team mount their brooms and get into position in the air. Harry turns to find Malfoy already grabbing the ball crate and he grins at him.
“You’re right.” He says finally, he pulls Draco in for a bruising kiss, not caring if anyone sees, “I’ll see you back at the castle. I need to do this.”
Draco’s face is bright with a huge smile, “Oh no, you definitely do.” He pulls Harry in a little closer and Harry laughs trying to twist out of his reach.
“Malfoy’s with you? Does that mean you guys have everything sorted.” He says this with a very nonchalant air, but Harry can tell this is a question that both he and Hermione are dying to know the answer to.
Draco slowly pushes back the blankets and moves with careful precise movements to sit on the edge of the bed in front of Harry.
“Hmm.” Draco says, clearly thinking. The silence stretches on for a longer amount of time but is again broken by Draco. “They seemed to take the news well.”
They both wake up late and Malfoy is in a pissy mood because Harry takes too long in the bathroom for Malfoy’s liking.
The moment is ruined however, when Malfoy pulls back abruptly and starts searching in his bag again.
“What?”
Harry snorts, “Ya okay.”
Draco wakes at this and turns in Harry’s arms to face him.
“Well that was a mistake.” Draco breathes, sliding into a booth pulling his hair at the roots.
Hermione takes a step towards him, her hands up in a placating gesture. “Ron, I’m fine. Malfoy is harmless.”
“You know how Hermione treats you sometimes after a bad nightmare?” Harry starts.
Although Teddy fusses at first, not wanting to give anything new a try, he eventually starts enjoying the banana baby food and tolerates the fruit and yogurt one. Harry, although happy that he got Teddy to eat it, sighs when he sees the banana that got into Teddy’s hair.
“Thank you.”
“Well Hermione never runs off like that anymore, I wonder why she left so quickly?”
This had led to a short argument about Harry’s questionable taste in furniture, which had in turn been resolved by a lengthy snogging session on the aforementioned furniture.
Harry smiles at the attempt but says, “And why is that?”
Hermione helps a stumbling Ron over to the table to sit on Harry’s other side, and Harry leans his head absently against Ron’s shoulder. Ron pats Harry’s head and smiles across the table into the camera in Hermione’s phone as she snaps a picture of the two of them.
“Malfoy now, is it?” Draco laughs.
Malfoy looks up, face already arranged into a sneer, “What the bloody hell are you on about Potter?”
Ron nods hesitantly, clearly wondering where this is going, Harry helplessly thinks that the acknowledgement of Ron’s all encompassing nightmares is probably not helping the situation.
“Not quite.” Harry responds, gently pushing Malfoy’s hair out of the way.
“Hey Hermione, I was thinking of coming over for dinner tonight if that's alright with you? I kinda skipped out of Auror training today and need to grab some notes.”
He finally finds it stuck in the crack of one of the sofas. He fishes it out, and without looking at the name answers.
“Well Malfoy, your shock explains the lack of food in the house. There are these things called grocery stores where food is bought. Surely even rich wizards like yourself need grocery stores.”
With that Malfoy pulls out of his grip and heads to the Slytherin table on his own, head down and eyes forward.
“Man, I love you.” Harry says, brushing a strand of hair out of Draco’s face.
Ginny is the only one who keeps eye contact. She looks at Harry consideringly before dragging her gaze to Draco still eating potatoes off his plate. Harry isn’t sure what she’s looking for, but seems to find it, nodding once before turning to say something to Bill.
Harry wakes up when Malfoy shakes his shoulder lightly.
Malfoy looks pained and mutters, “I despise you both, I have a reputation to uphold.” Before gesturing that they should continue making their way to the dining hall, "Shall we?"
“Should I go back to Hogwarts?”
“I need to talk to you about something.” Harry starts, looking over to Teddy in the corner of the room.
“Ya, I think it went pretty well. If Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw are down I’m gonna ask them to scrimmage with us too.”
“I lived with the Dark Lord for a year, Potter.” Shrugging his one shoulder, he says, “It was inevitable that it would happen at some point.”
“Harry, I think it’s time we had a little chat.” She has that look on her face that she gets when she knows something you don’t.
Harry ignored him and headed for the door.
“I had help,” Harry said thickly.
“Lots of things bother me, Harry.”
“Do you think I can…?” Harry started to ask, pulling out his fingers gently.
“Nonsense,” Draco said quickly, turning to face Blaise as they continued their chess game. “You’re more than welcome to stay as long as you like.”
“Precisely. As an added bonus, this will force you two to get along. Don’t think that your incidences have gone unnoticed by the Professors. If I hear of one more, detention for both of you. Now everyone, please go to your rooms and prepare for the night.” She quietly added, “It's too late for this.”
ty for all the kudos, pls leave a comment if you'd like, i really do love reading them because it helps me better my writing!
Ron cocked his head to the side, “meaning?”
No other words were said. Neither of them would ever tell anyone they helped each other.
ɒmˈnɪpət(ə)nt/
we're getting into the plot now ooooh
And he’s crying, of course he is, it
Draco woke up, unfortunately, in his own bed. Memories of last night running wild through his mind, he could still feel Harry’s touch lingering on his skin, his hot breath panting down his neck. Much to Draco’s disappointment, they didn’t outright fuck, it was a lot of heavy snogging, blowjobs and some very shameless frotting; but it had just made Harry ten times more appetising to Draco.
“Fine. But you better have a damn good explanation for this.” He stalked out of the room, Harry followed him sheepishly.
harry wakes up, with absolutely no idea what is going on
“It’s practically criminal! First I have to live with him, now I have to spend every night for the next week with the arsehole! It’s basically child abuse!” Harry lamented, rolling on to his back, he let out a heavy sigh; the dread streaming through him, he could feel it lighting every nerve in his body. “Harry I don’t mean to interrupt your breakdown, but it’s 7:55.” Ron heaved, grabbing Harry’s legs and pulling him off the bed. Once he was upright, Ron handed him his bag and his quill, opening the door for him.
“Do I look bloody okay Potter? Please help me!” Malfoy strained, Harry pulled open the trap door properly before outstretching his hand for Malfoy to grab. “Take my hand!” He gave him a nauseated look, “I am not taking your hand potter!”
"yeah"
Harry points to the blonde boy. And nods his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was sitting on the kitchen counter, Harry was cooking something that smelled
Harry sat up a bit, barely hiding the confusion on his face, ever since Ron had put that idea in his head it had been all he could think about. He wasn’t gay, he
The battle of Hogwarts had left everyone at ease, but it left Harry confused. There were many things that had happened during the war that Harry could simply not explain, but by far the most confusing thing that has ever happened to Harry was Draco Malfoy.
Draco Malfoy discovered this completely out of the blue.
Malfoys reaction surprised Harry a lot, he didn't complain or argue, he just nodded his head; kicking the back of his seat out from behind him. “Not so fast Mr Malfoy.” McGonagall started, gesturing for him to sit back down. “Both of you are to stay here until I return with a potion for Mr Malfoy's nose, you are going to talk about this, without hitting each other.” She stood up from her desk and left them alone in her office.
“You’re bloody welcome.” He swept up his basket, slamming the door to the kitchen closed.
His second hand reached up to the metal railing of his headboard, clutching around It as his well-trained hand moved up and down his dick. Draco's eyes fell closed, the only thing on his mind was everything that was pouring out of Harry’s mouth last night.
“Judging by the layer of dust over it, I'm guessing it wasn’t successful?” Draco raised an eyebrow, Harry snorted, pushing Draco's shoulder. A comfortable silence fell over both of them, he let his head rest on Harry’s shoulder, his citrus scent running through Draco’s mind.
“Do you want to ,maybe, move in with me?” Harry blurted, surprised at what he’d actually said. Draco sat up, his eyes widening, “really?” Harry thought for a moment, living with him outside of Hogwarts sounded like utter heaven. “Yes, I have this huge house and no one to live in it with, having you there would make it a lot less lonely?” He sat up to face Draco, who was gaping. “Yes! Of course I would!” He leaned forward and kissed Harry, it was quick and chaste but it was still filled with love and excitement.
“Potter! Potter, calm down, it's okay” Draco attempted but Potter was still heaving in front of him, his eyes glazed over and filled with unfocused tears. He wrapped his arms around Potter's neck, pulling him closer and holding on to the back of his head, letting him cry into his shoulder. “Shh Harry it’s okay, everything is going to be okay.” He stroked the other boy's hair, Potter’s hair was messy but it was surprisingly soft. He let himself bury his face on the top of his head, his hair smelt like citrus.
“Tell me something.” Harry blurted, Malfoy turned his head, raising an eyebrow. “A story, a happy one.” Harry clarified.
“Y’know Draco, I wish I could ignore you the way you ignore me, because I just
This girl should’ve known by now that he was very obviously not interested in her, but Potter was way too nice to tell her to just piss off. Draco quickly shoved the bottles onto the shelf, attempting to run away as soon as he could so he didn’t have to hear this trainwreck of a conversation.
If possible, Harry’s jaw dropped even more. “Don’t I get a say in this?” Ginny shook her head. He sighed, knocking back a shot.
This left Harry and Draco alone in a room together for the first time since sixth year, the silence in the air was deep, it brought back memories of train compartments and broken bones; both of them realising they had no clue how to talk to each other without fighting. "Potter" Malfoy's voice was thick, it was rich, it was as if there was no shake, tremor or any sense of fear in it this year. "Don't even try it Malfoy, i'm not dealing with your crap this year, so can we just leave each other alone so I cant get through this bloody year." The boy in front of him faded a little bit, stepping back; he looked..disappointed? For a split second Harry thought he'd got a single sliver of emotion out of Malfoy, but then the boy rolled his eyes. "Don't be so ridiculous Potter, you would be dead if it wasn't for me" Harry scowled, moving closer to Malfoy. "As much as I am thankful, all you did was throw a piece of wood to me, we're hardly building a church in your honour" Harry cursed, Malfoy merely smirked, cocking his head to the side. "Well, a church would be ironic" and he waltzed off into the bathroom again.
things that even my own mother was angry at me for saying.” He stood up from the sofa, backing away to the door. “And lastly, I can’t be your friend because you saved the world, and i’m practically a monster.”
Harry was moping dramatically in Ron’s room, Ron shared with a Hufflepuff that was barely in his room therefore it became the trio’s new place to spend time together; the common room was just too busy for their liking. Harry was lying face down on Ron’s bed, whining loudly about his detention.
Harry realised that Malfoy had invited him to the room of requirement at the same time the other boy did. Harry had to sit down and process this information for a moment.
Draco was waiting in the Room of Requirement, he had gotten there early to do some of his own work. He looked up to the clock, he had around five minutes until Potter made a grand entrance. He glanced around the room, it was completely different from when he was normally here obviously, the walls were a soft green and a black velvet sofa was placed in front of a marble fireplace. There was also a large desk with two chairs, which Draco was currently sitting at, as expected, the door flew open.
Draco walked over, kneeling down in front of the windowsill, carving down in the middle.
Harry was surprised at a Rons outburst, but most of all he was hurt, physically and mentally. Ron spitting accusations at him stuck in his mind, did he really defend Malfoy? Sitting back against the sofa Harry realised how stupid he had been. He just got beat up by his best friend for speaking to Malfoy, and then continued to still go to the room of requirement, cry his eyes out in his nemesis’s arms, then have an actual conversation with him that didn’t end in a fight, but an apology? Had the world turned upside down?
He smirked, “and now i'm going to bed.” standing up, leaving a gaping Pansy in her room. “Wait don’t go! I want to know more!” she pleaded, he just gave her the middle finger, backing out of the door. “You’re insane!” Pansy shouted.
Harry shakes his head, this can’t be happening, can it? In his head, he’s just woken up in some random timeline and he’s being fed information that he has no clue how to handle or what to do with. “No, you’re wrong, this isn’t right.”
“Looks like someone took up smoking.” Draco smirked, Potter laughed gently, flicking the end of his cigarette. “Yeah, you got me obsessed.” He said, eying Draco up, he exhaled; pulling his cigarette up to his mouth again. A silence line the room, not an awkward one, but a comfortable one; both of them just wordlessly enjoying the ashy taste of Draco’s cigarettes.
“Okay I’ve got one, never have I ever-” A knock on the door interrupted Draco, the trio glanced at each other, Pansy groaning before getting up; throwing a pillow at Blaise on her way to the door. “Draco dear, it’s for you” Pansy said, in her sing-song voice, Draco turned to who was asking for him.
His dorm mate was still out which was strange for it being almost 1am, instead Hermione was sat on Rons bed. Her hair was pulled back into a ponytail, she was wearing her pajamas and working on an essay; she looked like she had been there a while. She noticed his arrival and beamed from ear to ear, she jumped up from where she was sitting and drew him into a bone crushing hug.
Harry almost goes limp.
Harry made a strangled sort of sound, running a hand down over his face. Draco slammed the door to the kitchen, striding into the main shop floor. He placed the box of oils on the till counter, unpacking the small glass bottles onto the shelves, his hands shaking ever so slightly from the anxiety running through him. The kitchen door clicked open; Draco didn’t turn around, hoping Harry would just walk past and out of the store.
Draco was stumbling around their room, it was graduation morning, he had lost his tie, Harry was still in the shower.
“We don’t have to, but god Harry” Draco looked up at him, “you have me, until every last star in the galaxy dies.”
“Do you wanna see my library?” Draco raised an eyebrow suggestively, Harry nodded.
Draco had worked in Lunars Apothecary store since leaving Hogwarts, he’d taken well to chemistry and science at school, but didn’t see himself as a doctor; preferring the more holistic measure of treatment. He took a job at the store on a whim, not expecting to spend morethan a few months there. Three years on and he had fallen in love with the unbridled comfort of the shop. It was hidden away on a corner of Oxford Street, filled from floor to ceiling with shelves, stocked full with every oil, tonic, salt or formula a person could ever need.
“Ginny! I’m sorry I didn’t see you there.” Harry squeaked, willing or her to just nod and leave him alone, the red-head was beaming, she pulled him into a hug. Her smell made him almost tear up, the smell he smelt for three years in his amortentia was now no longer his, he hadn’t checked to see if it had changed since they had broken up; he’d probably break down if he still smelt Ginny.
Harry and Draco return to their favourite windowsill
to trust him.
(See the end of the chapter for
from getting killed" Malfoy retorted, but his usual bite from the years before wasn't there. "You were the last person on earth I wanted to rescue me" Harry spat, looking Malfoy up and down like he was poisonous. "Well Potter.. sucks to be you, don't it?" And with that, Malfoy span on his heels and waltzed inside.
He didn’t even look at Draco before he left, leaving only the raindrops that fell from his boots.
And he is, taller than Harry anyway, long legs look even longer stretched out in an onyx suit. His deathly pale skin is simply a stain on an inky canvas.
“I can’t believe you; I’d never think you’d be so pliant, especially for me.” Draco’s mouth fell open, his hips bucking up into thin air, desperate for any friction. Harry's own dick was drawing tight to the front of his jeans, he reached a hand down, lazily palming himself to take the edge off. “Can you feel me up against your back? You did that to me love, all for you.” Draco’s hips shot up one more time before he was coming all over his stomach and Harry’s hand that was rested on his hip.
i just wanted to let you all know i'm back at in-person school now! however this does mean i can't promise exact updates all the time, but i will try my hardest to get them out on tuesdays and saturdays!
“What?!” Draco spluttered, dropping his cigarette out the window, his usual sneer returning to his face and his bratty fifteen year old self coming back, grimacing at Potter.
“Do you ever think that we could’ve been friends?”
He decided that he needed to speak to Ron, apologise first, and then ask where it all came from. He gathered up his stuff, ignoring the pain in his neck when he stood up. Looking back at the room one more time before leaving.
Harry and Malfoy looked up at McGonagall, both turning their heads to each other.
With Harry finally dressed, they were downstairs with the rest of their year. Draco was awkwardly hanging around Harry’s friends, not making any conversation but nodding occasionally. Harry and Ron had to go over to McGonagall to give her their speeches which left him with Granger.
hopefully a new chapter will be out tomorrow:)
“Potter?” Draco shouted, Potter’s head popped out the door frame, a look of slight annoyance threading his face. “What?” He grumbled, still doing up his tie. Draco crooned a finger at him, calling him over to the desk. Potter’s tie was still messily undone around his neck, giving up trying to it as he trudged over to Draco.
Draco sighed, “we can do all that, after graduation” Harry mocked sadness, Draco pulled him out the bathroom.
Draco got up, banging on the door of the bathroom, “Harry! You have fifteen minutes to get out and ready!” He shouted, the door swung open and he was hauled into the room.
He opens his eyes, they’re still sitting to his left, burning holes through his skin. Harry tries, he really does, to put names to the faces. But he can’t, as much as he wants to know them, he just has no idea who they are.
The ringing in his ears stops, the pain in his head levels out to a gentle, dull hum, his erratic breathing stops and the extreme panic in his stomach calms. Harry looks over to the people sat to his left, they’re so familiar, yet so distant. It's almost like they knew each other in some alternate timeline, or he’d read about them in a book once, but he didn’t
“We have too much unfinished business, you can’t make anything positive out of what has happened between us, it’s too much hurt, i-” he trailed off, he knew what he wanted to say but it didn’t seem like the right time, but Potter raised an eyebrow, silently asking him to continue.
Malfoy looked Ron up and down, taking his shot. “Real mature Weasley, now can we ask questions that people don’t actually know?” He mumbled, his confidence draining at the mention of the death eaters. “Alright,” Padma Patil piped up, sitting up straighter. “I’ll start off easy, never have I ever cheated on a test?” She took her shot, as did pretty much everyone else, except from Neville and Hermione. Which absolutely didn’t surprise him.
So he shakes his head.
Pureblood, rich, spoiled Draco Malfoy. Had snogged, a boy.
He walked over to the windowsill, taking the cigarette out of the metal box; he sat down and put it between his lips, leaning forward as Malfoy lit it with his wand.
“Have a look at this.” Draco moved the screen so Potter could see it properly. It was an email they had been sent from one of their bosses, telling them the price of their sales would need to increase during the Christmas period. Potter made a face, before straightening up, taking his glasses off and running a hand down his face. “Is that normal?” Draco scoffed, the man behind him sighed and shook his head.
Delving too deep into something that you weren't meant to know can deceive you into thinking that you were meant to help that situation, when realistically; you just make it ten times worse.
“Draco,” Harry mumbled against the pale skin of his neck.
please leave comments, i really do love and cherish them all
“Well, my dads getting killed in two weeks, I ruined my entire life by simply being too much of a coward to stand up to him, my mums going insane because she’s not allowed to leave the house, half my family are dead and I depend on smoking to get through the day.” Malfoy concluded, leaning his head back to hit the cold stone behind them.
He ran his fingers over the blade clutched between his fingers, the handle was a soft ivory, engraved with his initials, the silvery trim glinting in the sunset from outside the window. Draco saw the way it smoothly slipped in between the grooves of the red berries on the table, it kept him calm. Doing something like this over and over comforted him, almost lulling him to sleep again.
He pulled his wand out of his pocket, moving Harry so he was underneath him. He buried his face in the other boy's bruised neck. Pointing his wand at the door.
“You whAT?” draco’s eyes widened, Harry beamed from ear to ear. He pulled the other boy in for a hug, lifting Draco off the counter. “I’m gonna be the next DADA teacher at Hogwarts Dray!” He spun him around, meeting his eyes. The dimming sunlight was streaming in through the window, reflecting over his green eyes in iridescent beams. Harry turned his attention back to the pot on the stove, turning the heat up and dropping in some carrots, stirring the pot once again.
This plays on a loop in Harry’s head as he’s being hurried down a darkened, dreary hall, filled from floor to ceiling with antique paintings and portraits. The other lady's name is Professor Mcgonagall, she's holding onto his shoulders with frenzied haste. Madam Pomfrey has his head bowed, and a hand over his forehead, gently pushing him through the corridor. They reach a mahogany door, with a brass handle, Mcgonagall doesn’t even knock, she simply walks in; closing the door behind her.
Draco nodded slowly, there was no way he was getting words out right now.
Draco stood up, moving out of the way to give Potter some privacy, ambling down the steps to the office.
Harry spun around, following the voice to its owner.
Harry and Draco make a deal, Ron hates said deal
“Sure” He agreed, Potter nodded before whipping around and vanishing into the hallway.
"No i'm not, I'm much worse." Malfoy mumbled, getting off the windowsill and leaving the room. Harry stubbed his own cigarette out, flopping backwards onto his bed, the smell and feeling of the nicotine circling around his body.
Draco clinked their glasses against each other, smiling at Harry.
He just couldn’t wait.
Fuck. He was
“Wait until my father hears about this.”
When the letter from Professor McGonagall had arrived at twelve grimmauld place, the world around him faltered.
Harry glances back quickly at Madam Pomfrey. “Where did McGonagall go?” She is silent, picking at the lint on her sleeve. “For answers.” She says, quietly. He doesn’t know what this means, but shrugs nonetheless. A withered, but still strong, hand snatchs the curtain open, calling for Harry to stand back out into the corridor. And he’s there, bent on the wall, standing proudly; an annoyed sneer on his face.
a little bit of a nicer chapter to make up for the last one
“I can’t explain it, but I don’t know who you are.”
Harry knew no one else could hear him, but by the sounds of a low moan falling from Draco’s lips, his words were true.
Draco grunted, moving quickly over to the phone of the countertop.
. I see you; you walk into work in the morning and your hairs all still slightly messy from sleeping, and your shirts unbuttoned to you collar, you’re mumbling stuff in French and you’re playing with that bloody lighter. Draco, I see you and my heart beats differently.”
“These beds are fucking tiny.” Draco’s gravelly voice spoke from behind him, he wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, pulling him into his chest. Harry wiggled round so he was facing the other boy, “that just means we have to be closer.” He whispered, Draco ran a hand through his messy hair, “what are you doing when you leave school Dray?” He closed his grey eyes, sighing a little. “I’m not sure yet, probably get a flat and then get a job at the ministry.” Harry nodded, he would probably do the exact same thing.
Harry and Draco visit the Manors garden, and then the library.
It was a sluggish Tuesday; they were a month into their final year at Hogwarts, the usual hubbub of the common room was nowhere to be found. Harry, Ron and Hermione were sat around the fireplace, studying furiously, the reality of NEWTs hitting them like a train. Harry was bored, extremely bored. He'd just been watching Ron and Hermione revise while he tapped his quill off the table, doing everything other than studying.
He took his wand off his neck, everyone was clapping but he didn’t care about everyone. He was looking at Draco and Draco only, his grey eyes shimmering with tears. He gave Harry a small smile before mouthing to him.
“Fucks sake.”
perfect because “that’s how Harry does it.”
it made him upset, what if he didn't want to forget? Knowing that he helped Potter twice in the war made him feel the smallest bit better about all the horrible things he saw and did then.
“Pansy read it to me over the phone. I’d rather not read it again.”
Ginny laughs, “Oh how the tables have turned.”
Socks with enchanted moving lions wearing santa hats in the Gryffindor colours are the object of Draco’s mixture of disgust and amusement.
Harry reaches across the table for Malfoy’s hand, and Malfoy lets him take it.
The last part is said as if a throwaway comment but Harry can see it was almost physically painful for Malfoy to say.
This room often features in Harry’s dreams. He wakes up in a cold sweat, the sounds of Hermione’s screams echoing in his ears, the word mudblood carved into her pale forearm, dripping blood.
Harry waits to make sure Ron is done before starting to talk. He chooses his words carefully.
Malfoy smiles lazily, “It takes up about thirty percent of my brain, Potter. So no, I wouldn't say that’s all I think about.”
Mumbling, so he can reclaim at least some of his dignity, Harry says, “The socks are still fucking ridiculous.”
“Pretty okay actually.” Draco says, chewing some potatoes before turning his head so that his own nose knocks against Harry’s, “I’m exhausted after arguing with so many people about their atrocious quidditch preferences.”
Harry runs his fingers through Draco’s hair and hums while he thinks of an answer, “I just wanted to let you rest and relax before we continue on into the shitshow that is our lives.”
This Draco holds himself back, and still doesn’t let most emotion play out on his face. Harry can read the language written in the small ticks and movements of Draco’s face, but that’s only because he’s spent a very long time studying the book. He glances in Narcissa’s direction and wonders if she can read it too.
“What is it, Potter.”
Draco smiles slightly again and gestures towards the sitting area where they try to find seats near Hermione.
Harry looks at Hermione in confusion and she laughs somewhat meanly.
He clenches his eyes shut in the dream, hoping to block out whatever is coming, but knowing it’s unlikely that he can.
Ron gives him a funny look at that, but before Harry can ask what it’s about Hermione knocks on the door.
It’s from Lovegood and simply says, “Here if you need someone.”
Malfoy looks at him from where he’s peering into the fridge, where he finds only empty shelves save for the little treacle tart Harry hasn’t finished. He shakes his head. “I demanded to know what Hermione said to you, but Weasel told me to sod off and talk to you instead.”
Draco’s hands still, his eyes darting to Harry’s. His mouth is hanging open.
Before leaving though, Draco had looked around the waiting room and finding it empty, pulled Harry in for a soft kiss.
This thought is punctuated by Mrs. Weasley saying, over the clamor of other voices, “Harry dear, could you and Draco come with me for a second?”
“A baby who can’t eat candy.”
“What?” asks Malfoy, already scooping pasta onto his.
When his mind catches up and starts to really wake up, he realizes there is a rather solid weight on his chest. This realization makes him go still and crack one eye open.
“Are you gonna tell us where you apparated to last night?”
He holds the powered off phone up to his head, and breathes out, clenching his eyes shut as he does.
She looks at him, appraising, before saying, “Him?”
Malfoy laughs at that, “Well in that case-”
“I have to tell all the Weasley’s before this gets out.”
When he sends Draco a questioning look, Draco just shrugs and says, “I figured the Great Hall might be too much for tonight.”
“It’s worse this time. We’ve become friends and are now sharing a room a Hogwarts.” His voice cracks on the last word, and he rests his head against the cool brick, hoping it will ease his mind.
When Harry doesn’t say anything Malfoy looks at him again and says, “You weren’t serious right? You aren’t actually babysitting are you? Who do you even have to babysit?”
“Okay.” Draco says finally, taking Harry’s hand and pulling him down the street.
“Well obviously, Potter. It’s my bed. Speaking of which, get out! I’ve had enough of your morning breath to last me for today, thank you very much.” It sounds weak even to Draco’s ears, so he punctuates it by hitting Harry with a pillow.
Harry smiles and checks inside the fridge. All the food that he’d made a few days ago is gone, which means that Malfoy actually ate something good this weekend. Harry closes the fridge and walks back into the living room where Malfoy seems to have fallen back asleep on the floor, huge comforter wrapped around his fair hair.
Harry laughs and stops, pulling Draco’s arm until the other boy is facing him. “I’m so glad I have you.” He whispers, looking into Draco’s eyes.
Ron grins, “What about you and Malfoy come over for dinner some time this week?”
“Petrificus Totalus.”
Teddy gurgles back, his eyes shifting to match Harry’s green. Harry smiles and pulls him back down to his chest and catches Malfoy looking at him shocked.
The chosen one has fallen onto Draco's bed and has his face smushed into his pillow, arms stretched loosely in front of him curled around the cushion.
Hermione pauses in her stirring of a pot, thinking.
Harry laughs again, before replying that he’s pretty sure that he can manage just fine on his own thank you very much. This has Hermione laughing and they continue talking about classes, and feasts, and the revolving door of defense against the dark arts teachers for hours. Just like it usually is, Harry’s mind is swimming with memories of Hogwarts. But, for the first time in a long time he isn’t recalling the corridors littered with bodies and rubble, or the quidditch pitch going up in flames. He is reminded of simpler times like pumpkin juice at breakfast and studying for hours in the library with Hermione and Ron for a test he will forget about in the morning.
“Somewhere that involves me not wearing sweats you mean?” Harry asks without removing his face from being smushed into the cushions.
Curse Malfoy and his observational skills.
Harry can’t help but smile and kiss Malfoy’s neck one more time before looking at him in the face.
They finish their food relatively quickly, but sit at the table for a while after drinking tea and talking about where they want to go shopping. Draco says that there aren’t many people he has to shop for, and almost all of them require going to Diagon Alley or Hogsmead. They both agree not to head there today, but rather get some of Harry’s shopping done in Muggle London.
Draco makes a noncommittal noise and closes his eyes again. Harry watches him for another moment before grabbing his phone off the bedside table. He pauses at a message from Luna. Counselling sessions weren’t on during the holidays, so Harry hadn’t seen her for over a week and wouldn’t for a little bit still.
Harry smiles at the sight but says nothing. He comes back to wipe Teddy’s face and hands before bringing him to his room to be changed. After that he changes him into a onesie to sleep in and puts him down in the playpen he has set up for when he spends the night at his place.
“Is there anything you can do?” Blaise asks, not unkindly.
His stomach leaps for joy whenever Harry so much as looks in Malfoy’s direction with a smirk. It’s a wonder he’s got along this far without shoving Potter against a wall and snogging him senseless.
Harry considers it, and would rather do that than go to the manor, but also knows that putting off the inevitable will just make it harder. It doesn’t help that Draco looks like he’s going to combust if they don’t see his mom soon. The other boy will never say it, but Harry knows he’s slightly anxious to be bringing Harry home to visit with his mother for the first time.
Harry looks up to Hermione and shakily says, “You may be right about me Hermione. But I don’t think you’re right about Malfoy loving me back.”
His team hates the Slytherins and demands to know why they have to share the pitch. A fiery redhead who reminds him of Ginny demands that they switch the practice schedule. Harry waves her off irritably and tells them all to focus on catching a ball instead of bitching to him.
Andromeda looks at him, amused. “I’m sure they did. And Draco how was it for you?”
“Yes, Malfoy.” Harry says firmly. “I haven’t gotten everything figured out yet, but I don’t want to stop kissing you as of right now.”
Malfoy continues speaking “And one of the biggest things I learned was that you can’t keep all your feelings inside.”
Clearly not, Draco thought bitterly as he watched Harry shovel eggs into his mouth, some syrup dribbling down onto his chin. No, clearly, the universe was not done fucking with him.
“Let’s get this over with.”
Yet, despite the stiff mattress and goddamn pokey springs, Draco would take that bed with Harry over his family manor any day.
“You’re leaving?”
“Some wizard you are.” he mumbles.
Harsh whispers about how he will never be enough, after all he didn’t even use magic to open his front door, he can’t survive on his fame forever. What will he do when the awe at the Boy Who Lived finally wears off?
“Both of which can wait until later Malfoy.” Harry says lifting the blanket slightly, inviting Draco to climb under.
Harry catches himself watching Malfoy’s hand, but only after he notices Malfoy staring at him with one of his fine brows raised.
After this he turns to see Malfoy looking at him questioningly.
Harry wakes up the next morning to the sound of Teddy crying. He cracks one eye open and waits to see if he settles down, but after a minute it becomes apparent that it’s time to wake up. He presses a kiss to Draco’s shoulder before quietly getting out of the bed and going to get Teddy.
“Tell me about you and Malfoy.” Hermione says, sitting down across from Harry with her arms crossed.
He looks at Malfoy again, whose just staring at him with his mouth open.
When Harry looks up, he’s shocked to see that Malfoy is standing right in front of him.
When he does and looks more awake with a scowl in place, Harry gently leans against him. Malfoy stills, before looking at Harry.
“What happened to keeping it a secret?” Malfoy hisses, raising a hand to his cheek.
After the war, Hermione was one of the few people in Harry’s circle of friends that decided to go back to school. As far as he knew, she is the only one in his year to have gone back. Most of the students are either too messed up psychologically to consider it, or had had good enough grades that their partially completed 7th and 6th years were good enough. The wizarding world embraced them all and created special training or new jobs for the students that couldn’t or wouldn’t go back.
“Then what was it about?” Harry asks, moving to stand in front of Malfoy’s wand.
Her eyes dart somewhat accusingly in Malfoy’s direction before returning back to Harry’s face.
Harry drops his wand at his side when he feels his phone buzzing in a manner suggesting he’s getting a phone call. He takes it out and sees Malfoy’s profile staring back at him.
Malfoy snorts and rolls his eyes, “Well it’s a good thing I’m great at it, and Professor Slughorn thinks you basically shit gold so you’ll probably get an outstanding regardless of whether or not your true talent lies with potions.”
He makes it to the library and heads towards a dark corner with comfortable chairs, and pulls out his potions essay and transfiguration questions. He makes it about five minutes before feeling his phone buzz in the pocket of his robe.
“I’m not sure, a few.”
“Where to next Malfoy?”
“Morning to you too, Malfoy.” Harry says, squeezing tighter for a moment before releasing him and turning back to his pancakes on the grill.
“Not a word of it is true.” Draco says, seemingly trying to convince Harry.
Malfoy has a dark far away look in his eyes that makes Harry sit up finally and look at him. Malfoy shakes his head.
He gets in line and orders his regular tea before walking towards the back of the building for a quieter place to sit and work undisturbed.
“How kind of you.” Draco says, closing his eyes and moving a little bit closer to Harry.
Hermione and Ron’s flat is much nicer than his own. Lot’s of natural sunlight and modern appliances as well as moving pictures hanging all over the walls. Harry's favourite is one of the three of them on the last day of first year. Hagrid had taken it. Harry smiles fondly at the memory.
“Don’t say that, it’ll go to his head.” Harry says immediately, pulling Draco into the booth and flush against his side.
“I suppose Professor Mcgonagall told you did she?”
He wonders idly what could have prompted this drastic change in attitude before realizing that there really isn’t that much of a difference. Sure, Ginny is taking part in a group conversation Draco is in, but she still won’t look at him when he’s talking, and is harsher than necessary when she answers him. Draco doesn’t even seem to notice.
“I was just about to wake you, our stop is next.”
“Ya.” Draco breathes, “But like I said, that was expected.”
Harry scoffs and watches Draco riffle through his dresser and wardrobe, but makes no move to get up himself.
Ron says nothing, but Hermione starts talking slowly, “Well you could ignore it, or you could give an interview to the Quibbler again and clear the air.”
“Shove off Malfoy.” Harry says, suddenly irritated.
“What are you doing?”
“Alright, I am packed and we can go in a bit, I just want to grab a shower.”
“I was living at the manor with mother after the war,” he starts and Harry stops fidgeting to listen. “But with father in prison and so many people lined up outside the manor, it made living impossible. So much blood and dark magic were split in the halls that all the shadows seemed sinister and the wind was like whispers or screams.”
He mutters a little 'thank you' under his breath and Harry counts it as a win.
Draco just shrugs his shoulders, not wanting to say that he was trying to waste time in order to make this dinner go by faster. Harry seems to know what the shrug means anyways and places his hand on Draco’s thigh under the table, squeezing reassuringly once before turning to strike up conversation with Fleur.
*  *  *
Harry rolls his eyes but takes Draco’s offered hand and follows him out of the shop.
Harry slowly opens his eyes and picks at a loose thread on his jeans, searching for a way to answer the question without sounding like he most decidedly has not thought about it. Hermione has asked him about this before, and he knows it’s her way of making sure he’s all right.
Harry opens said fridge and finds a ton of food. Harry isn’t sure what to eat first, he just knows that he wants to eat all of it. He’s halfway through a platter of fruit when Draco trudges into the kitchen.
“I don’t know what you want,” Harry says softly, “But I want you.”
“You seeker for Slytherin this year?”
At this Harry sits up and rakes his eyes over what Draco’s decided to wear. It’s not what Harry was expecting. Draco is wearing dark form fitting jeans that do wonders for his arse, a stylish light grey jumper that looks incredibly soft while also appearing incredibly expensive, and over it, he has a leather jacket that Harry recognizes as dragon leather.
Malfoy blurted out the first sentence his lovestruck brain could supply him with- “Those sausages aren’t going to eat themselves.”
At this Malfoy turns on his heel and walks out of the office, leaving his trunk behind. Harry scrambles to follow him, ensuring that his wand is in his pocket and thanking Mcgonagall as he goes.
Harry snorts before handing the first present over, and watching as the afternoon sun glances off the top of Draco’s silver hair. Thoughts of how Draco might as well be an angel are interrupted by Draco’s gasp.
Harry startles at the voice but hurries over to the truck, excited to have warm food in his hands.
Harry takes the high road and decides not to respond, but even if he had wanted to his answer would have been cut short by Malfoy slamming the door in his face.
“And what am I supposed to do instead?” Harry sighs, not really wanting to do anything.
Resolutely, he turns back to facing the wall and decides to mention it to him in the morning.
Why Malfoy continued taking this class Harry will never know, all he knows is that he dropped it after fifth year for a reason and desperately wishes it had stuck. He couldn’t care less about the centaur treaties of the past hundred years, yet he is surrounded by his classmates who seem to be taking notes with their colour coordinated quills.
Harry stands for a moment outside the restaurant, a light mist has begun to fall as he makes his way back to Malfoy and Teddy. He contemplates Luna’s words and Hermione’s suggestion. Maybe he should talk to someone, maybe it would lessen the night terrors and paranoia. Maybe, just maybe, it might make that fantasy with Draco and Teddy just a little bit more achievable.
“Hello Harry.” She says, stepping back and allowing him to follow her into her room.
He expects and braces for being mobbed by witches and wizards who see them in the shops, yet so far no one has approached them. Even in the Three Broomsticks, although he knew Madam Rosmerta recognized him, given the extra helping of potato soup he received that he hadn’t ordered, even she didn’t gush. For a while he can’t figure out what it is until he watches Malfoy head back to their table from the bathroom. Witches and wizards shrink back from him. Melting into the shadows as if afraid he’ll look or speak to them. Harry marvels at the effect Malfoy has, and feels a little sorry for him. After all, it must be a lonely existence to have no one speak to you and everyone fear or hate you. Harry thinks this but doesn’t bring it up. It’s unlikely that Malfoy needs a reminder of how awful his reputation is in the wizarding world.
Harry snorts, and sat up suddenly comforted by Ron’s familiar tone, “Ron I was literally texting Hermione this morning.”
“Hey.”
She looks at him shocked for all but a moment before saying, “Okay. I don’t need the details. I’m not ready to forgive him, but you don’t need to explain anything more to me. You’ll have enough trouble explaining to the rest of the family.”
Draco allows them to kiss for a few minutes before he pulls away.
When Harry looks at her questioningly, Hermione supplies, “Ron said to me the other day, out of the blue that he knew you and Draco had a thing for each other but he didn’t know if Malfoy was good enough for you. He thinks the world of you Harry. And he’s willing to give Malfoy a chance because he makes you so happy.”
“What? No I didn’t, you’re absolutely delusional.” Malfoy’s blush comes back full force as he says this and Harry can’t help but laugh.
He wonders if maybe he loves Malfoy enough, but honestly the idea of loving Malfoy terrifies him. What would people say? The wizarding world would turn against him, and even though he has Hermione and Ron in his corner he really doesn’t want to ostracize himself from the only world that he’s ever been able to call home.
Hermione laughs and mutters, “God you’re oblivious Harry.” she shakes her head and lets out a short laugh. “I thought maybe that auror training might have brought you more in tune with your surroundings, but it appears not.” She looks at him in silence, at her wits end.
His close friends had understood when he had abruptly moved to Muggle London, but that doesn’t mean that they never worry.
“I love you.” Harry says, breathing it into the space between them. “Full stop.”
But when Draco asks if Harry wants him to sleep in the same bed as him, hesitation flitting across his face for the first time that day, Harry isn’t going to say no. That’s how they end up lying in bed and sharing kisses while murmuring about stupid inconsequential things. The upcoming quidditch match between Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, a vacation Draco went on when he was younger, the time Ron, Fred and George saved Harry with the flying Ford Angela.
Staying the night had been dumb.
Harry nods whenever Percy pauses in talking, but his mind is focused on Teddy babbling away to Draco.
Harry walks quickly, head down and jacket pulled tight around him to combat the cold wind that is cutting its way through the London streets. It is that time of year where a winter jacket is too hot, but only a jumper leaves you too cold.
Draco turns his head into the touch and kisses Harry’s palm.
Harry watches as Malfoy scans the hallway, before his eyes land on a storage cupboard not that far away.
“Harry?”
“Is that a yes to breakfast and shopping then?”
Harry smiles at both of their reactions before getting into it. “Ron you’ll be fine, I haven’t been to training for over a week and you’ve managed to survive. And Hermione, from what Mcgonagall says you’re gonna have a lot on your plate, what with being a teaching assistant for charms and all.”
The woman nods happily but stops when she sees the face of the baby he’s holding, “Oh I thought that was wee Teddy with you, but it can’t be, is this your boyfriend’s child?”
Your guys' feedback makes our day! Thank you for commenting and kudo-ing<3
“Believes what?” says a voice behind Harry and Malfoy.
“You can peel some potatoes, Draco.”
Harry shakes his head, not believing what he is about to do. Harry takes a couple more steps, and with a smirk that rivals that of the Weasley twins, flings himself into a seat across from the boy.
Looking down, Harry drops Malfoy’s arm and half laughing replies, “It happened enough times, I’m surprised that you didn’t.”
After saying all this, he holds his hand out for Harry to hold. Harry obliges, gently leading them towards the train station and out of the apartment, putting the old wards back in place as he goes.
Ron nods again and awkwardly shuffles forward before pulling Harry into a hug. Harry hugs Ron back tightly, extremely glad they’ve made up.
Draco rolls his eyes and mutters a charm to heat up the eggs and sausages on his plate before turning to Harry. “It won’t kill you to dress up, Potter.”
“What are you playing at, Malfoy?” He says sitting on the end of his bed and rubbing a hand through his hair. He knows he sounds tired an irritable and that Malfoy doesn’t deserve that. But he can’t help it, his brain is still a little foggy with lack of sleep.
Harry moves his eyes from Narcissa for a moment to glance over in Draco’s direction, but the other boy is already crossing the room to stand at his side.
Just as he’s deciding that this is a mistake and that he’ll leave, Luna opens a door and says, “Hey Harry, you can follow me.”
“That’s a fairly large window mate, and we don’t know where you’ve been. You could’ve been kidnapped for all we knew.”
“It was good,” Harry answers stepping into the house after Andromeda, “Everyone missed you though.”
“They’re awful, Weasley.” Draco says his voice packing some heat, “You can’t even deny it.”
Draco isn’t sure why the handshake happens, he just knows that Ron is likely doing his best to support Harry in the face of everything. He decides to let it slide without comment and turns to Granger.
“And how is it that you’ve come to know that Mr. Malfoy when Potter here still seems rather confused by your conclusion.”
So owls tapping at the window are a regular occurrence that Harry wishes he could ignore. Even worse though. is the fact that the large quantity of owls is drawing the attention of both muggles and witches and wizards. They now know that Harry and Draco are likely in the flat above the Starbucks, but have no proof as neither boy has made a public appearance since the tattoo outing.
Her face is determined as she says this and Harry feels Draco tense slightly before saying, “Thank you. I understand though, so it’s okay.”
“He’s a Malfoy for christ sake!”
“Yes, Sallow. I do believe I am.” Draco squeezes Harry’s hand and stands up. Harry scrambles to follow and grabs his coat.
Harry rolls his eyes and laughs at how dramatic Ron is being.
“Bloody hell Potter,” Malfoy sneers, hurriedly putting a book away before Harry spills something on it, “Could you be any messier, I feel like I’m dining with a toddler?”
“How was I supposed to know that, Malfoy?” Harry asks, pulling away from Malfoy’s mouth. “You were a huge twat and acted like you hated me.”
Now that Harry is a registered Auror, he could begin work immediately if he chose, but being the contrary little shit that he is, he refuses to go into the field without Ron by his side. This leads to Harry stubbornly sitting in on the uncomfortably long lectures, taking notes (no matter how messy), participating in lessons, and doing all the work. All done just so he can prove that he actually deserves his certification.
After that there are far fewer questions and a lot more listening.
He cocks his one eyebrow up in a way that makes Harry jealous of his abilities.
Harry grins at this and is about to respond when a woman with two full sleeves covering her light brown skin and a ton of piercings on her face sits in a stool on Draco’s other side.
Harry shakes his head a little and laughs at Hermione’s single mindedness, but then puts his phone down without answering. Harry has a decision to make. He knows what the smart answer is, but the pure logic is murder on his brain. He knows that if he makes the decision too quickly without further thought he might regret it later. Typically, he leaves the decision making in his life to Hermione, or Dumbledore or some other adult. After all, he’s been pushed around on quests and missions since he knew how to cast his first spell. But, he knows that this decision has to belong to him, or he’ll never be truly happy with it. On the one hand, he has his Auror certification, could go into the field immediately and live up to society’s expectations of him. Or, for once he could do what his heart wants, go back to school with Malfoy and his other classmates. He can practically smell the pumpkin pie drifting from the great hall, and hear the victorious cheers from the quidditch pitch… It would certainly prove more exciting and enjoyable than auror training. Draco stomps back into the living room, his footsteps slamming on the hardwood floor.
Ron looks amused by this display, but still has his own wand out, “Calm down, I’m not gonna curse you. Harry can I have a word?”
He moves back in to continue their kissing, but Harry stops him with a hand on his chest.
Draco just rolls his eyes and holds his hand out for Harry.
After coming to this realization, he pushes off the bar, thanking Tom for the refill, and makes his way over to Draco. Harry catches the tail end of Pavarti saying, “It doesn’t even make sense! Huge plot hole if you ask me-” before slipping his arms around Draco’s middle and hooking his chin over the other boy's shoulder.
It’s just a hand, he thinks stubbornly to himself. But he doesn’t stop himself from falling in towards Harry, their shoulders clashing against one another. He holds Harry’s hand longer than is strictly necessary. But Harry doesn’t seem to mind.
Malfoy looks at Harry without moving his head, his eyes moving slowly to look at Harry.
He steps away to avoid the scandalized look and push that come his way. But Malfoy’s hand still makes contact with his shoulder, and Harry thinks he enjoys it way more than he should.
The air is sucked out of the room at that but George doesn’t seem to notice and keeps talking, “Like I said, I’m trying to be happy for you. But I just can’t. Give me some time. I need some time with this.”
Before Malfoy has a chance to answer someone clears their throat behind them. Instantly both Harry and Malfoy have wands in their hands and are pointing them at the person behind them.
“Okay, fine.” Harry says, adjusting the blanket so it’s more fully on him and waiting for Draco to join him back on the couch.
Draco hisses at the contact but says, “Language around the brat, Potter. And I’m pretty sure you’re the one who suggested dinner and freezing.”
“To Hogwarts?”
“Can an almost 8 month old baby eat sweets?” Draco asks, looking at the various shelves.
Both Mcgonagall and Harry turn their heads in Malfoy’s direction, with almost identical looks of confusion on their face. When Malfoy catches sight of Harry’s face turned towards him he rolls his eyes and sighs.
Harry replies back with some witty comment, and Draco makes sure to roll his eyes.
Harry knows this and decides that pointing out that they aren’t in the muggle world will not be to his advantage.
“You’re no fun.” Malfoy says, crossing the kitchen to pluck Teddy out of Harry’s arms. “Isn’t that right Teddy? Who’s boring? Is it Harry?”
“Oh shove off Malfoy. Barely anyone notices.”
Draco, of course, looks absolutely flawless. He’s wearing the beanie again, but this time with jeans, his leather jacket, and a navy blue shirt that Harry vaguely remembers buying sometime earlier in the year and promptly shoving to the back of his wardrobe.
Harry is a dumb bitch, but then again when isn't he?
He opens his mouth to say something else, but before he can Malfoy mutters, “God you’re thick.” Grabs his tie, and kisses him.
“Mousse.” Harry says without thinking, “It’s chocolate mousse that he likes.”
Harry shrugs again, feeling as if he’s done that a lot in this conversation. “I do plan occasionally. When it’s important.”
“Hey Harry!”
Before he can, Hermione tugs the sleeve of his jumper, forcing his attention on her.
Harry scans the menu up top before answering. “Actually Marissa, can I please get a regular cranberry white chocolate mocha and two of your breakfast sandwiches, as well as my regular cappuccino please.”
Ron rolls his eyes at that, “Hermione, I love you, but get out of the way. You too Harry. This is between Malfoy and I.”
The conversation grinds to a halt again when Draco and Seamus return to the table with Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna in tow.
“Yep she’s pretty proud of you from what I can tell,” and without thinking he adds, “You have some explaining to Malfoy to do though, he was right pissed when he heard you’d abandoned him on those projects.”
Harry pays for his food, and Malfoy his before making their way towards Hogwarts.
Now Blaise was on the other side of the world. He had gotten out. Gone to Canada, or somewhere equally as ridiculous. He was the only person in the world who knew who Draco was, and he was gone.
“You like it then?” Harry asks, pulling Draco closer and slipping his fingers under the hem of Draco’s jumper to be on bare skin.
Harry looks up to see Malfoy turning away. Without thinking Harry says, “Don’t be thick Malfoy, saying you weren’t the bad guy wasn’t hard compared to being the chosen one.”
“Granger called. Twice.” Malfoy remarks.
Harry is shocked by the lack of security but Malfoy doesn’t seem phased. Admittedly, he already has his head and eyes down, trying to go unnoticed. Harry wonders again what life is like at Hogwarts for Malfoy. He imagines Malfoy focused, and walking through the halls, robes swaying at his feet, desperately trying to avoid sneers and gales of laughter, and at the same time trying to prove that he’s better than his father. He lets this train of thought carry him to distraction as he and Malfoy walk through the dining hall. Heads turn and voices are raised saying hi, but Harry doesn’t acknowledge any of them, he can’t. When they draw level with the Gryffindor table, cheers start up suddenly, and it has Harry reaching for his wand, his heart racing. Malfoy’s hand comes out of nowhere and wraps around Harry’s wrist, forcing the wand down before it has a chance to come up.
“Maybe later.” Harry says, his lips brushing against Malfoy’s slightly before he pulls away, “Teddy needs a bath and I want to do something fun with him today.”
Draco is still looking at Harry so Harry adds, “I’ve mentioned it. It’s just after Christmas before school starts up again. I’ve already told everyone we’ll be there.”
He can’t resist picking up his phone and opening up the camera. When he snaps the picture, he immediately sets it as his lock screen.
“He’s changed Ron, he-”
Sure Blaise was a little stupid, and could be cruel to those who weren’t useful to him, but he was a good friend to Draco when Draco had no one. And he could really use a friend right now.
Harry knows Mrs. Weasley is just saying visitors to spare his feelings, when really she doesn’t want to see him, but Harry can’t wait.
Harry finally admits defeat and sets the bowl of food in front of Teddy and directs his attention towards Draco.
A chuckle escapes before Harry has the chance to reign it in. “Come on Malfoy, you boss me around every day, you’ve certainly never been shy about telling me exactly what you think.”
Harry laughs and closes his eyes, “You won’t find any arguments here.”
After a day that felt like an eternity, he slips out of the room as Harry gets ready for bed, pulling on his ridiculous snitch pajamas that make Draco’s heart warm. Harry looks at him questioningly but Draco waves him off, holding up his phone to indicate he is making a call.
“How useless.” Draco sighs, using some kids walking behind him as an excuse to lean against Harry.
Harry groans and cracks one eye open and in direct resistance to Draco’s command shimmies under the thick blanket.
Malfoy shrugs, uninterested in the mystery of Hermione’s abrupt departure, but Harry can’t get that mischievous look out of his head, or figure out the reason behind it.
“What was Weasley talking about when he mentioned my trial?”
“You can go Potter.”
But Harry isn’t known for being afraid, he has nothing but courage apparently. He doesn’t flinch from small gestures and kind words.
Much more gently than before, Hermione says, “I’ll just ask you this Harry, if this is just friendship, what's Ron’s favourite dessert?”
“God.” She says, pinching the bridge of her nose and closing her eyes, “It had to be him? You couldn’t have picked some other bloke? There are probably plenty of guys who would be happy to help you with your gay self-discovery, and you had to pick the one who helped You Know Who?!”
As Harry lays in his bed that night looking across the bedroom at a sleeping Malfoy, he takes a second to consider what has happened.
Malfoy freezes, but Harry doesn’t. Somehow, he ends up standing in front of Malfoy, his own wand pointed at Ron his other hand moving back in a sort of protective stance.
“Not fantastic, but as well as I expected.”
Draco snorts and mumbles, “Could have fooled me.”
“This pillow smells like you.” Harry mumbles offhandedly, turning his head slightly but still having his voice muffled by the pillow.
Malfoy looks down at his laptop in aggravation and looks for all intents and purposes like he is going to keep on working and ignore Harry altogether. Harry slowly slides his hand across the table and pushes Malfoy’s laptop shut. The lights along the side dim and shut off. Huffing in frustration, Malfoy looks up again, eyes wide.
Harry is startled by the buzz of the tattoo gun and jerks over to see new ink forming on Malfoy’s pale skin. His hand tightens slightly around Harry’s, but he remains silent and calm.
Hermione Granger> 9:30
“Malfoy or Ron?”
Hey friends! Sorry for the late post today, I was driving eight hours to get home from school:) Thank you for your patience and most of all your continued support with comments and kudos, we love you<3
He and Malfoy are still laughing and pushing each other, hands pulling at each others robes, when they reach the entrance to the charms room. Hermione meets them outside the door when she hears their voices and she raises an eyebrow at Harry’s hand still holding on tightly to Malfoy’s tie. He slowly retracts his grip and looks to the ground, fighting a blush that he’s becoming all too familiar with.
Knowing his lie won’t hold up under intense scrutiny, Harry apparates right away, not allowing Hermione or Ron to get a word in edgewise.
Harry sighs and reaches back for Draco’s hand. Draco takes it without looking up from Teddy. Harry finally gets the chance to look at Hermione.
It’s a throwaway comment, clearly of very little importance to Draco, but it makes Harry’s heart squeeze slightly whenever Draco reveals that he needs Harry as much as Harry needs him. Harry pushes that all down and focuses back on Teddy, knowing Draco likely wouldn’t appreciate confronting emotions this early in the morning.
As the two teams trudge off to the showers, Malfoy leans in closer to Harry so that they’re touching from shoulder to foot. They're completely covered in thick quidditch robes, but still Harry feels that this moment isn't all that innocent.
They reach the front steps of his flat complex, and Harry hurriedly withdraws his arm from around Draco to adjust the hood on a sleeping Teddy’s head so that all his hair is covered. Draco looks around at the empty street and rolls his eyes at Harry’s jumpiness, but for once doesn't say anything.
- If he gets tired of you you’ll break
He looks over at Harry who is swinging their hands between them as they make their way back to his flat. The cold has turned his cheeks rosy, and he’s droning on about one of the chasers on his team. His unoccupied hand is waving around as he mimics the movements of the chaser.
“Oh and Potter,” Harry looks over her shoulder at her, she had moved to be behind her desk. Dumbledore’s portrait seems to be trying to catch his eye, but he focuses stubbornly on Mcgonagall. “It’ll be good to have you back.”
Draco is already convinced that Granger knows. The knowing look she sends his way every time she catches him staring at Harry terrifies him. She doesn’t keep secrets from her friends, and it’s only a matter of time before both Weasley and Harry figure him out.
Draco looks at him with a bit of disgust before saying, “You’re cooking right? If you’re going to bother me for the rest of the year I’m gonna need my strength, and that requires food that I don’t have to make.”
“Hey Hermione, what’s up?” Harry says, shifting his phone to his other ear while he holds his hand out to grab Malfoy’s bag.
Draco just nodded, and said, “It’ll never happen again.”
Harry stays quiet, and Draco appreciates it. He doesn’t think he could take bright, happy optimism right now.
Harry finally looks up after saying all that to look at Draco. He has a moment to register Draco’s mouth hanging open in what appears to be shock, before he’s being aggressively hugged by him.
Harry doesn’t blame him though, he’s nervous himself. He knows that the Weasley’s, Neville and Luna will undoubtedly be okay with everything, but he’s slightly worried at seeing his other classmates that he hasn’t seen for a while.
Harry sighs, and runs a hand through his hair distractedly, glancing at the cute picture of Draco trying to hide a smile at Luna cooing to Teddy.
Malfoy looks amused by this and quirks and eyebrow up, “Go ahead then, Potter, seduce away.”
Harry does see it this time when Draco rolls his eyes, “Of course you will. Planning is not your strong suit.”
Without turning around Malfoy shouts back, “You wish Potter!”
Harry remains standing and watches as Malfoy takes his seat. “This is stupid” he thinks to himself, and he turns to go sit down when he notices that even the Slytherins at the table are avoiding Malfoy. They’ve turned their bodies away, and shifted down the benches so that Malfoy is fully alone. His head hangs down towards his plate and his longer blonde hair hides most of his face. Harry has never seen Malfoy like this, what happened to the boisterous, arrogant, attention seeking boy that Harry knew so well?
They stand for a moment looking at each other, before Harry pulls Malfoy towards him by the sway of his waist so their chests are flush against one another.
And it’s now that Harry realises, he doesn’t remember what happened.
Harry potter knew this all too well.
Sitting on the Hogwarts express felt surreal, it almost didn't feel right. Six full years at Hogwarts and this would be the first year he wouldn't be in danger of death every five minutes.
“Y-yes.” He stuttered out; Harry could see Draco sitting up out of the corner of his eye, but he was refusing to look at him. He looked down into his lap, which was apparently a whole lot worse.
everyone tries to work out what the hell is wrong with harry, whos just trying to figure out who the blonde boy is
"If you're going to do that could you please stink up someone else's room." Harry snapped, shoving the door closed. Malfoy didn't retaliate, he just turned to look at Harry; pulling a metal container out of his pocket, "want one?" He gestured towards Harry, offering him a cigarette.
“But seriously Harry, I know now how happy he makes you, he’s good for you. And you’re good for him.” Harry pulled Ron in for another hug, when they disconnected, Ron stood up.
But trouble has never looked so god damn fine.
“Yes it is Harry. It’s exactly what it fucking looks like.” Ron scolded, his voice steady, his eyes were glaring at Draco, staring him down with fury in his eyes. Harry glanced over at Draco, he was expecting him to be cowering in a corner, but Draco was standing his ground; staring intently back at Ron. “Harry, what do you think you’re doing?” Ron said firmly, Harry swallowed, he opened his mouth to talk, but Draco interrupted. “I don’t think what Harry does in his private time is any of your concern, is it Weasley?” He said sweetly, batting his eyelashes.
“Actually ‘Mione I need to speak to both of you about something”
The wood shed.
“I think I’m falling in love with you too, Harry Potter.”
“No” he lied, but did that game of truth or dare count? Well, yes considering he spent the next week after that snogging Theo Nott in the prefect's bathroom. And when it caught up to him, Draco kicked Theo’s teeth in to ensure he wouldn’t say anything.
Potter wasn’t on the shop floor, probably just went downstairs to the office for a minute. Draco first flipped the open/close sign over, turning off the lamp that shone outside. Wandering over to the till to shut off the computer, before going to grab his stuff from the office.
he still had a good three hours until he had to meet Draco and dinner started in fifteen minutes; he wasn’t going to eat but the rumble of his stomach suggested otherwise.
After what Harry guessed was the hardest day of his life, he couldn't wait to crawl into his bed and let sleep wash over him. He climbed up the spiral stairs to the eighth year dorms, feeling the fatigue already hitting him. He ignored Ron and Hermione's complaints as he trudged past them, going straight to his dorm.
He’s not looking at Harry, body angled deliberately away from him. It feels rehearsed, well practised, which makes him wonder exactly
“Y’know I was actually meant to be in Slytherin?” Potter said nonchalantly, as if it was just a normal statement. Draco shot up from where he was sitting, almost spilling his drink all over him. “What?! You’re fucking with me right?” Draco guessed, Potter grinned and shook his head. “Nope, the hat told me I'd do well in Slytherin but I specifically asked for it not to put me there.” he said, setting his drink down on the coffee table. Draco pulled a face, “why?”
Draco could set fire to the world around him.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was just about nodding off, when the door to the common room burst open. Harry jumped out of his skin, sending his chair flying across the floor. He whipped around to see Pansy Parkinson standing in the entryway, a bottle of firewhiskey in her hand.
This time Draco didn’t even nod, lunging forward and kissing Harry full on the mouth.
wolfstar rights
“Harry?” Draco shouted up the staircase, he could hear some shuffling about upstairs, before Harry’s face popped down over the banister; smiling brightly. “Hi!” His face was flushed, shirt unbuttoned to his collarbone, dark hair covering his face a little. Harry practically tumbled down the stairs, they were squeaking as he went, signally the age of his house. He threw himself around Draco, wrapping his legs round Draco's waist.
“Your name is Harry Potter, you’re sixteen years old, you’re in sixth year at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry. When you were a baby, you defeated the greatest dark wizard there has ever been, and now, you’re probably one of the most famous people in our world. But you’re more than that, you’re funny, and you’re kind, and you’re a sarcastic little bitch, but shockingly enough, you’re my best friend in the whole world. My name is Ron Weasley, and that girl over there? That’s Hermione Granger, and we’ve been best friends since we were eleven years old. And you remember Draco bloody Malfoy over us.”
“I don’t think they ever did.”
Music was blaring loudly on the radio in the kitchen.
BUT there's some wholesome wolfstar and harry content
He spun around, leaning on the doorframe, “I have called you Harry four times today, I should be careful, it might start to stick.” Draco smiled smugly, before closing the door. Leaving Potter alone in the room.
TW-mentions of homophobia, religious trauma
He leaned back, taking another draw from his lit cigarette. His mind unhelpfully wandered to his earlier fight with Potter, he was still surprised they had been roomed together but Draco couldn't believe that when he saw his name wrote next to Potter's that he'd actually though they wouldn't argue this year. Not even ten minutes alone together and Draco was shoved up against a wall with Potter shouting at him. One particular phrase was on replay in his ears, "
“Malfoy made this; how do we know he’s not about to poison all of us?” Ron spat, shuffling away from the circle. Harry heard Draco scoff, leaning forward and tilting his head forward. “If I wanted to poison
“Meet me here at 8pm sharp, no later or I will add another week, you’re dismissed boys.” She shooed them both away, Harry nodded his head at her before darting out the room.
He yanked Harry away so quickly, pulling him the long way around Hogwarts. He ran through his favourite spots, knowing that it would probably be the last time he would ever get to see them. They went up the spiral staircase to the eighth year dorms, ignoring the paintings who were telling them to get back to the party.
we hit 1000!! thank you so much for you continued support, i love reading your comments:)
“And we probably never will be friends” Draco stated, Potter faded a little, his shoulders tensing up. “What makes you say that?” he wondered, staring at Draco with question marks in his eyes.
Ron just nodded and shut the door.
“That’s the problem! You think you don’t deserve something so you ruin if for everyone else.” The other man tugged at his shirt sleeves, trying not to show to Draco that he was nervous.
“Doing..what?”
“You have an aura” she looked up at him, scooching over on her chair to make way for him. He flopped down, his head flew to her lap, letting out a mock sob; sitting up to look at her, she was stifling a laugh. “What?” he questioned, giving her a playful shove on his shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So.. Who’s next?” Pansy’s voice was wavered, she was the one who cleared her throat. Harry downed his shot, the alcohol thrumming in his veins. “Harry, truth or dare?” It was Dean this time, removing his arm from around Seamus’s shoulder. Harry exhaled; he had a feeling he was about to be tortured by his friends for the rest of the night. He took the pussy way out, “truth.”
“Yeah, see you tomorrow.”
But it doesn’t last.
It had been a few days since their escapades, and Draco had managed to avoid Harry entirely. They had both been in the shop working, but he spent most that time hidden away in the back of the shop, his head bent over a pan; working hard on fixing the oils. Harry had walked through a few times, asking work related questions only. Draco had kept his head down, giving him one-worded, blunt answers.
“I guess this is why you kept blabbering on about Cedric Diggory in fourth year.”
