He nodded. “Yes, mother. She is…suitable. And intelligent.” And male, but he wasn’t about to say that out loud.
By the time the dishes were vaguely clean enough, Draco felt like a year-long bath wouldn’t be enough to make him feel clean. And he still had two more chores to accomplish. He sighed, then picked up a broom. But this task went little better. After all, the floor seemed to be made of packed dirt. So how was he to know when it was clean? It seemed a never-ending task.
"He was being a bully. Father always told me that was how Muggles treated us. So I assumed you were like me. I had to stop him."
"No, but it means the longer after the memory, the more likely the spell will fail, Harry," she told him.
Draco closed his eyes. Of course Snape recognized him. He couldn't help but wonder if Snape had placed a tracking spell on him that night, but it didn't matter either way, he supposed.
Harriet nodded, taking his arm, then let him lead the way down the hall, Blaise and Pansy following them a few steps behind.
"True. But there’s knowing, and there’s feeling, Fenny. And I want Draco to really understand. To feel."
Particularly when it comes to one thing: Draco wants to go out, but Harry would rather stay home. The two fight daily about it. Draco screams and rails at him, but Harry will not budge. He does not want to see Draco with other men. He doesn’t say this, of course, but we know that is his reasoning.
"It's not that, Malfoy. It's just, I never really considered it. I mean, until you started telling me these stories, I never wondered about who you might like. You…well, I didn't exactly expect a starring role. Let alone romantic."
He focused on Harry’s signature, approaching him then taking his hands. “Found you.” The handkerchief slipped from his eyes—he didn’t pay any attention to who had pulled it off—and looked up into the green eyes he loved so much. “You’re mine,” he said with a smile.
The Queen still looked a bit horrified, but even now, Draco could see his father seemed to understand. Finally, he nodded, then took the Queen’s elbow, pulling her aside so they could talk quietly for a moment. Draco could see she didn’t particularly like the way their conversation was going, either. Lucius was quick to shush her as her voice rose, but finally, she nodded, though she was still scowling. “Very well, Lucius. On your own head be it.” She turned to the girls, who had all been watching this wide-eyed, and caught their attention before leading them back into the castle. Most looked rather disappointed, now that the Prince was back in human form. Draco knew that they’d all have loved to get their claws into him.
Both boys jumped at that. Draco because he’d forgotten that they weren’t alone, and Harry because the idea was one that simply hadn’t occurred to him. “‘Help’ him?” Dumbledore nodded, and Harry turned back to Draco. “You want me to…kiss you?” he asked softly.
The words left Draco stunned, not sure how to respond. "Thank you," he finally said. "It means a lot to me."
As the last four guests approached the bassinette to give their gifts, the neglected wizard appeared.
“Go with them? Go with them where?” Draco asked in what he knew was far too sharp a tone. It was taking everything inside him to keep from shouting for the guards and clapping Harry in chains just to keep him here where he wanted him.
“No.” Potter looked crestfallen now. He pulled away, and Draco felt bereft, but he looked at the bed rather than following him with his eyes. “Never mind. A promise is a promise. I’ll leave,” he said softly. “I’m sorry I tormented you, Draco. I never meant…” He sighed. “Good bye.”
The next few hours were filled with making the Prince comfortable. He was pleased that Harry chose to stay with him. Even though they’d never met before, Draco felt rather attached to him. After all, Harry had been the only one to actually understand what had happened. Now if only he could get him to convince his parents to call off this horrific kissing contest…
“Harry,” his mother was saying now in the calm voice she saved for his father when he looked about ready to execute someone for no real reason at all, “it is a dangerous thing to encourage. It’s…wrong. He is making a mockery of those of us who try to live good, wholesome lives. Surely you don’t think he is a good example for how you should live?”
"We were never friends." His benefactor paused, realizing what he'd said. "Look, I can't trust you. You've proven that. This doesn't exactly help matters."
Harry shifted, pulling Draco into his lap, then began to kiss him again, even as his hands shifted to his back and arse. He knew Harry was trying to calm him, but he doubted anything he would try would really work. “Please…I…”
“Nothing, hm?” Potter sighed, obviously disappointed. “Fine. I’ll take this back up to the palace, but if you don’t have anything waiting for me when I get back…” He let the warning trail off, and Draco shivered, knowing whatever he chose, it wouldn’t be good. He nodded to show Potter he understood.
“My only problem is that he’d never allow it. If it was just that it would upset him…yes. You are the one I would ask for. No matter what he said.”
He ended up throwing a bunch of things in the pot, then stirring it, but at the end, it looked rather grey and gross. He wouldn’t have wanted to eat it himself, and he highly doubted Potter would either. Chancing a bit more magic, he closed his eyes and pictured his own favorite meal—a stuffed pheasant with potatoes and greens. When he opened his eyes, the food in the pot was still stew, but it looked far more edible, at least…
"Palace?" Draco asked, alarmed. He wasn’t sure he wanted to meet royalty. "Why are we going to the palace?"
“Just that it was a good thing I had a good wank in the shower. I might have done more than just held you. Might have helped.”
Draco nodded. “Thank you.” He dropped the horse’s reins, and watched as it obediently followed after its master as he continued to pull the cart up the road towards the castle.
He wasn't sure what to expect at first, but she was nothing like what he'd always been led to believe. She was highly intelligent, witty, and even sly when it came right down to it. Though Draco wanted to hate her, he found himself strongly reminded of his mother.
Draco’s throat closed as the two went to the window and looked out, Fenrir sniffing all the while, his eyes narrowed. He whispered something to Bella, who nodded, then waved her wand over the sill, and across the opening of the window.
Potter looked sad. “Because…maybe the fact that I was trying so hard to get through to you meant that I wanted more?”
“Yep. Porridge.” He held up a bowl, then ladled a large serving in and handed it to Draco, who wrinkled his nose at the grey, lumpy mess.
Still, when Harry returned with Egan, Draco was quite pleased to escape the strange man and his dog, his wish to talk with his friend long forgotten in the need to get away.
Draco shook his head to clear it, glowering into the mirror. This was precisely the problem! He couldn’t want Potter! Just the idea was ludicrous. Yet each morning, he woke with those eyes foremost in his mind. This last dream had been the most intense of all. He couldn't even allow himself to remember, but god, he wanted to. Just remembering the feeling of Potter’s lips on his; of their bodies pressed together… Just thinking of it again made his lips and skin tingle.
Draco's stomach flipped at the question, and his eyes dropped to his hands. "Yes sir. I needed to fix a cabinet."
Shacklebolt nodded. "Very well. I believe we have covered all the charges. Would you like to add anything else to your defense?"
Draco’s heart sank. At hearing that the Prince of Gryffindor had been lost for so long, he had hoped, but this man, whoever he was, was not Harry. Harry’s hair was a short mop, while this man’s was long and silken, brushing his shoulders. He even held himself like a prince. Draco knew it had been too good to hope for.
He moved back to the centre of the room, his thoughts whirling now. Potter had tricked him. Made a fool of him! He’d been keeping him prisoner here, knowing the king would never allow it. Well, then. Draco would just have to find a way to tell the king as soon as he arrived. And then they’d see what would happen, wouldn’t they?
"Well, no real harm done. Though we will be more strict should we find more of these gatherings, gentlemen. Are we clear?"
Pansy managed to keep her head, but only barely. As it was, her voice was a bit high and strained. “My hand? Why would he… He’s never said more than ten words to me the entire time he’s been your personal guard. Why now?”
It took a good deal to convince his feet to move, but finally, he stepped forward and made his way up the stairs. As soon as he was close enough, the woman threw her arms around him and sobbed. Draco met his father’s eyes, not sure what to say.
Draco wasn’t sure how to respond to that, or what exactly the other man meant by that, but finally, he nodded. “Yes.”
When the man turned to look directly at him, Draco’s breathing sped up. Caught. Well, a Prince did not hide from others. He stepped out from the shadow of the hedge and approached the man.
Blaise’s lips twitched for a second, then he bowed low. “Highness. I have brought you a princess to become your bride.”
"I don't care. It's worth it. Even for one more." Because he needed to know, even if it meant the other boy would hate him.
Even after the third reiteration, the thought still made Draco’s head spin, and he had been staring at Potter dumbly for the minutes that had followed the original request. Even now, it still made no sense. “That’s ridiculous, Potter. Why would you want to stay at the Manor? What about Black’s place? Surely you want to stay there?”
Draco had dreamed of this moment for so long, it took a bit of time before he realized that this wasn’t necessarily going to end the way his dreams always had. He pulled back and looked at Harry. “What… Wait… You can’t… Harry…”
“Look…it wasn’t…it didn’t start that way. But then you kept whining…I couldn’t resist. I always intended to marry you properly, Draco.”
“Oh, I’m sure they’ll know, Draco, but if you should get a chance, simply tell them that Tom sends his regards.”
Potter had scoffed at Draco’s complaints. “As long as you can still walk, you’re fine, Draco. Now here, have some of this rat. It’s quite tasty when roasted well.”
Draco doesn't seem startled at all at Harry's acting as though this is the first time they have met. He smiles, his fingers curling around Harry’s hand. “Draco. Malfoy. Very good to meet you…Harry.”
But that didn't mean the bloke at the masquerades who he hoped. And the worry it might be someone else kept Draco from being able to admit his identity to the other boy at least as difficult as not wanting to hear the other boy's disgust when he found out who he'd spent his weekends with.
“What, Moony? I mean…look at James! Look at what happened to him! He trusted Peter, and what did that rat do? He sold him out!” Sirius turned back to Harry. “Friendship counts as nothing. You need to protect yourself. Besides…it wasn’t like Lucius was in a rush to help your father when Lord Voldemort tried to take over his land…”
“No. Just…” He swallowed. “Obviously, this was a mistake. It’s not helping.” In fact, it was making Draco rather distinctly uncomfortable, but he wasn’t about to tell Harry—Potter! When had he started thinking of him as Harry? He shook his head to clear it. “My parents are probably expecting me…”
Harry and the new guard looked at him, surprised. Harry scowled. "What do you want now, Malfoy? Whatever it is, forget it. I'm going home, and I'm going to take whatever it takes to get rid of this headache, and then I'm going to bed. Hopefully, if it's a good night I won't think about you at all."
“All right. I suppose I’ll see you tonight? Or will I be serving as well?” he asked, shocked at how calm he managed to keep the words.
Draco stepped forward. “Of course, Harry.” A thrill went up his back at the name, and even more so when he set his hand on Harry’s back. “I apologize. It was probably a long ride. Should I send for some refreshments while you change?”
When they turned into the Great Hall, Draco glanced back at Snape. This would be worse than hed possibly thought. And he'd never managed to find out who his mystery guy's identity. It wasn't fair.
“Looks like we have at least one friend in the royal family, Sirius,” Harry said with a smile, reaching up to scratch at Draco’s head again in thanks.
Before Blaise could answer, Queen Narcissa had appeared as well. “Yes, Blaise. Who is this girl you have brought to tempt my son?” The words put Draco on edge, but he did his best to keep calm, glancing towards the girl Blaise had brought him to distract himself.
The thought made Draco uncomfortable. He looked away so he didn’t have to meet Harry’s eyes. “It was just a dream.”
Snape stepped forward. "Headmistress, this is intolerable. These students have been breaking the rules of this school, causing other students to miss classes, or to fail in completing their assignments in time."
At that, Harry beamed. “As often as you’d like.” His arms pulled Draco closer, and Draco lost himself in the kiss. It was everything he’d never thought he’d wanted. It was perfect.
Harry shook his head and stepped forward once more, meeting Draco’s eyes. “Don’t suppose you can talk, can you?” he asked Draco softly.
Now, as long as no professors found a mask on a student, and as long as none of them caught on to the fact that none of the upper years came to lunch, Draco might actually get to talk to his mystery guy. All he could do was hope he didn't react badly to his revelation. And he actually got a chance to tell him.
Time dragged, and by the time his turn for a trial came, Draco was sure he would jump out of his skin before they could impose his sentence. He wanted this
All Draco could hear in his head was Bella’s mocking voice, saying how he was fit for nothing but being her pet. And whatever else, he had to agree—he was in no way fit to be anyone’s king.
“Well, mister Potter, it seems that you will marry my son. I will have the preparations started immediately.”
Huffing, Draco turned away. "Either you're lying…" Or he'd been given a memory charm as well. If Lucius thought him a Muggle boy, that was likely exactly what he had done.
The only time we see the Malfoy heir cave a little is at breakfast. When Malfoy arrives, he tries to sleep till noon, but Harry has always been an early riser. At first he tries to wake him by tapping on the door, but he soon learns that the smell of coffee and bacon will pull Draco from his bed far sooner than any request, however kind. Draco always comes to the table bleary-eyed and grumpy, but he always comes, and can any of us truly blame him?
Narcissa beamed at him. “You have favorites? Which?” She glanced around the hall as though the hopefuls might glow so that she could pick them out to speak to them.
“I thought you said you’d done this before!” Draco exclaimed, pulling back. “You said…you already had your first.”
He decided to test out the theory. The next task the house-elf brought him, he left a note in the book addressed to Potter. There was no response. Which meant one of three things: they hadn't seen the note, which seemed unlikely, or he was wrong, and the person assumed it was a joke, or maybe, he was right, and Potter was refusing to admit it.
The dark head of the young man whipped up to see who had called to him, and his eyes widened when he saw Draco in the window of the tower. After a moment of staring he shook himself, then turned and approached the tower. "Hello! I didn’t realize that place was occupied."
And it didn’t get any better when he told his father Potter’s request. “You told him what?” Lucius’s temper had been paper-thin since returning from Azkaban, though he’d managed to keep it under control while the Dark Lord had been around. But now? Why would he even consider having the boy hero anywhere near him, let alone living in their home?
Draco saw the corner of her mouth twitch, but perhaps it was a trick of the light. "Indeed, Severus." She nodded behind him, and Draco turned to glance back at the hall. A crowd of students stood behind them. Not just the upper years, either. Third and fourth years were standing with their older friends, and even the lower years stood with their siblings.
The young man they’d been calling Harry ignored both of them and stepped toward Draco. “You don’t look so scary,” he told Draco with a soft smile.
“What?” His defenses were high, now, and quite certain he wasn’t going to like Potter’s next question.
Potter seemed to have no pity. He refused to stop or slow when Draco demanded to, or when he said he wouldn’t be able to move another step. At night, even though Draco’s father had packed feather beds and comforters for each of them, he refused to let Draco use one. “If we use them out here in the wilds, who knows what could happen to them? They’d likely be forever ruined.”
Harry blinked at him for a moment before answering. “Uh…sure. So…Blaise said that this shouldn’t take too long?”
“It is not a horrific idea,” the King agreed, eyeing his son’s new form. “But will they even consider it?”
“It is not as though it has not been tried before,” he said, turning to glare at him. “Great aunt Alabaster nearly married one.”
Harry shook his head. "He took me back to the cottage. But—" He met Draco's eyes. "It was the best day of my childhood. And he took it from me." Suddenly, he looked at Draco in a different way. "Things between us could have been different," he said.
Where the guest bed usually sat was a tower of mattresses. After a moment, a face peered out over the edge. “Draco?”
Draco sighed, but nodded as well. “Right. Make it a cold one. I don’t want you letching all over me, Potter.”
There was a strangled, “Yes,” before Harry’s lips found his neck once more, sucking hard at the skin and making Draco gasp and stretch his neck more.
Draco bristled. It wasn't as though he'd gotten anywhere near the bars, after all. Then he remembered that Harry had actually requested this, and knew cooperation would make Harry more likely to talk with him, and took another step back.
Part of his brain was marveling over the fact that Potter was so fit, and another couldn’t get over those green eyes or the black rumpled hair. It took him at least ten minutes to gather himself enough to try to ignore the images and try to sleep once more, but after several minutes of tossing and turning, he gave up and got out of bed. Maybe there would be breakfast downstairs? And hopefully Potter would already be gone.
He didn’t notice the lights of the town as they approached, his eyes screwed shut as they were. He barely even noticed as they alit in the courtyard of the palace.
So you see, though I let all the evil into the world, I also let hope escape, and because of that, he was able to destroy Voldemort, and so evil faded once more.
Well, let us turn a bit and we will see the reason. Look, there is Harry. And see who that is on his arm? Why it’s the very Ginny who wanted so badly to get his attention!
Draco couldn’t resist the opportunity. “Perhaps you should come with us. Just in case. I mean, I wouldn’t want to hurt him by pushing him too hard…”
Draco waited until he heard the shower in Potter’s room turn on, then pulled the door closed. He had preparations to make…
Harry shook his head, then stood. "No. I guess we're done." He stayed quiet for a minute before he spoke again. "But if I can help you—"
Both Malfoy men looked at her aghast. “Yes, Narcissa. But…living with us?” Lucius asked. “It makes no sense. Not unless the boy is trying to find a way to trap us somehow?”
He and Pansy began to plan a party. Not just any party, but one where all three of the upper years, sixth, seventh and eighth years, from all houses would be invited. The invitations sent with masks charmed to hide all distinguishing features of those who wore them, and the time and place of the party disguised until an hour before the party.
“No. It’s not that. I…” He glances back at the room where he changed, then to Draco once more. “Could you…wait in the dressing room there? I…need to go talk to someone. But…then I’d like to talk to you. If…I can?”
The shift in mood was enough to unsettle Draco's emotions, so he nodded, no longer able to meet Harry's eyes.
Draco stood and dressed in one of his clean outfits, untouched from the horror that had started the moment he’d left Slytherin. He didn’t use his best—he’d save that for the rescue he’d hoped would come, even in his darkest moments. Now it had, but he found he simply needed to keep going as he had, and everything would be perfect.
“I know. It’s too much. I tried to tell them I wasn’t going to go in, but…they insisted,” he shrugged, looking awkwardly embarrassed.
It was a rhetorical question. Everyone in their kingdom remembered how his grandfather had killed the Gryffindor prince, leading to years of fighting between the two kingdoms and far too many losses. “Yes. But this is different.”
Draco was glad his blush couldn’t show through his scales. He nodded, then nuzzled Harry with his nose.
“I don’t know. I assumed she would be here with you, mother.” Had Harry fallen asleep after he’d left, and not woken? “I’ll send Blaise to collect her, shall I?”
The thought worried Draco. That meant Lucius cast the spell on him after Harry, if the spell on Harry was still so strong. "Are you still in contact with your family, Potter?"
Draco’s eyes slid shut. “I wanted it so bad I could taste it.” And then Harry’s lips were on his once more, and Draco moaned as Harry’s tongue pressed into his mouth. He put his hands on Harry’s back, pulling him closer, but after a moment he pulled away. “Don’t…aren’t you dating Weasley’s sister? I thought…you liked girls. I mean…” He took a calming breath. “Aside from the fact that you hate me…”
He consoled himself by going to the Leaky Cauldron and drowning his sorrows in a Firewhiskey or two, not even noticing at first when someone settled next to him.
The Queen wavered for a moment, but at a nod from her husband, she held out her son. “Save him,” she whispered.
His minor place as a Death Eater wouldn't make any difference when it came to his sentence. The fact he was a Death Eater at all doomed him to be sent to prison. But at least he wouldn't face Harry any longer once they sent him to Azkaban.
Draco slowly made his way back towards the palace, his mind lost in thought as he walked. It wasn’t until he reached for the door that he realized something was wrong. That wasn’t his arm. He held it up, blinking at the claws and scales that moved and shifted in the sunlight as he turned his hand. What had that man done to him?
The children of Voldemort's Death Eaters, Marked or not, were also dealt with. Each gaining a guardian who would ensure their good behaviour. Should they prove upon their majority, or after five years, whichever was the longer time, they could be trusted in Wizarding society, then they would be released.
“You can. But he won’t get it for a month, I’m afraid. The mail doesn’t go out until next week, and it will take several weeks before it reaches Slytherin, because it has several stops to make before it even reaches Gryffindor’s borders.”
The wizard laughed. “You should have thought of this before you sent out your invitations, highness,” he said with a cruel smile. “You have your heir, Lucius. For eighteen years. And at the end of that time, the boy will simply waste away.” There was a flash of light, and the Prince began to cry.
“Your friends aren’t much better, P-Harry. I mean…look at how they looked at me when I came in. And that was without you fawning all over me. If they find out you like me?”
"No, sir. I do not believe he wished to offer any defense today. But I would like to offer one for him, if I may be allowed?"
Harry frowned at him for a long time, and Draco could tell he was trying hard to remember. "Well, there was a visit to Brighton once. But I spent almost all of that holiday in my room. My aunt said I'd pushed Dudley into the water… or something." He winced and put a hand to his temple.
“Inheritance? But you don’t have…” Draco swallowed the final word. His friend had always been a bit sensitive about his lost parents. No one had ever managed to find out who they might be. One of Draco’s fears was that someday someone would take Harry away, and he would never see his friend again. “What else did he say?”
Feeling his cheeks heat even more, Draco huffed. “And what makes you think you were anything more than a convenient body, hm?”
Just as he was about to give up, he saw a young man about his own age on the road, two older men walking with him. This was his chance. Surely he would be able to defend himself against three.
Draco turned to Harry. He wouldn't volunteer for that as well, was he? But Harry turned to the stands, and Draco followed his gaze. His eyes widened as an eerily familiar woman stood and made her way down to the floor where they stood. But she was dead and even if he'd somehow been wrong, why would anyone allow her to be here, let alone free?
The shrieks turned to screams at the thumping, and when his wings spread, one of the girls fainted, and another took to her heels, running for the safety of the castle. If Draco had been able, he’d have smirked. Still, there were four left. That was too bad.
But I was also certain by then we would never win. I don't mean I thought the Dark Lord would never win, but that the Malfoy family would never survive, regardless. At least under the old Ministry, we might have had a chance, but under Voldemort's regime? We would never survive. Not for long, anyway.
“He needs to be startled,” a voice came from the far side of the courtyard. Draco looked up to see an old man with a long grey beard making his way across to where they stood. “It is a difficult thing to undo the first time, self-transformation, but it can be done. Never fear, majesty.”
“Not now, Pansy!” Draco spun away from the window, then moved out into the hall, hurrying down the steps to the courtyard where Blaise waited with his prospective ‘bride.’ He hurried down the first turn of steps, then slowed, trying to regain his dignity. After all, this might not work out in his favor, and he needed to keep in control as long as he could.
He knocks at the door, and someone lets him in—after a long and awkward moment of distrust. Shall we follow him inside?
Anyone else would have cowered from the look King Lucius shot at his son. But not Draco. He met his father’s eyes, certain he would agree. It was possibly the worst mistake Draco had made in a long line of mistakes. Finally, the king drew himself up and turned to the King of Gryffindor. “I apologize for my son’s behavior, and that you had to travel such a distance to witness such behavior. However, I will spare you the fate of having to deal with him again. I hope you will at least take your rest here in the palace before you return to your own kingdom.”
"Please," Draco said, earnest now. Potter or not, he was sick of being alone. And if it was Potter… "Please stay and talk to me?"
“Please…” He couldn’t think for the pain, and Harry was the only thing keeping him from flying apart.
"Regardless, Harry, she will need to be processed. If she had stayed home…" The new Minister, Shacklebolt, didn't seem to be pleased, but it didn't make it any easier to hear.
Harry looked a bit dazed, but he was smiling. “Wow…” His hand came up to stroke Draco’s cheek again.
Potter muttered something under his breath that sounded a bit like “finally,” but Draco couldn’t understand why he would say that. Then Potter nodded and made his way up the stairs. Draco watched after him until he disappeared from sight, then made his way to the library and retrieved a book to divert himself with before going to the sitting room, hoping that he would be a bit less distractible now.
The surprised puff of breath gave way to a soft moan, and Draco gloried in the sound, his arms curling around Harry to pull him closer. When they broke apart, he met Harry's eyes. "Do you know how bad I wanted you to be the one?" he asked.
When he returned Egan to the stables later, the strange girl wasn’t there, but neither was Harry or the other stranger. They’d even taken the dog with them. Draco only hoped Harry would remember his promise to visit the ball once more. If he had to deal with the ridiculous fools on his own, he might well be inclined to hex one, no matter what his father might think of the idea.
Harry's eyes grew round at the sight of their rented house. "Wow… Aunt Petunia would be so jealous."
“There are many girls here today who might make an excellent queen for Draco. Perhaps we should make a contest of it? The girl who restores him to his true form will rule at his side?” The Queen suggested.
He was going to have to confront Potter. Find out what sort of spell he'd had placed on him, and how. Probably through the wand Potter had stolen from him. It was the only thing that made sense, after all. Otherwise, why would he have given it back? And there was nothing else of Draco’s that he’d had possession of in just that way.
Draco shook his head, backing up until his legs hit the bed, and he tumbled down onto it. "No! I haven't! Really!"
"As fast as I can with both of us on this thing. It’ll be okay. I promise." But his voice sounded kind of grim, despite his words. They both knew that it wasn’t over by a long shot. The witch and her pet wouldn’t give him up so easily.
Potter's words rang in his ears until Draco was sure they would drive him mad; suddenly an image formed in his memory. Two boys, one twice the girth and several inches taller than the other. The larger shoved the smaller boy to the ground. "You have to wait here, Potter. You aren't allowed on the beach. Mum said so."
"So tell me. When did you cast it? While I was rescuing you from the Fiendfyre? At the Manor? When?" Harry was glowering at him.
He doesn't seem to see the dejection on Harry's face. But we can. “Yeah. I thought this would work, but…you’re unhappy. I’m unhappy. It’s better if I just let you go home.”
Trying not to let the fact that Harry was gone shake him, Draco got up and dressed in his riding outfit, then made his way down to the stables. Perhaps Harry had just needed to deal with a few things early this morning? But even as he walked down to the stables, he knew he wouldn’t find Harry there.
Instead, watch him walk the London streets until he arrives at Harry’s flat. And look at the shocked look on Harry’s face when he sees who is at the door. “Draco?”
“Oh, don’t leave on my account. Daniel and I were just about to find a more private spot to get to know each other better.”
Yes! Draco was so excited, he nearly jumped into the air, but managed to stop himself, nodding instead.
So now mother and father were pointedly avoiding one another, and Draco decided it would be more fun to be out here where neither could decide he'd done something wrong.
"Don't. I mean, I know you can't. Don't make yourself feel guilty about it. It isn't your fault I'm here," Draco told him, voice soft.
Sure enough, Harry’s main stable-boy, Seamus, shook his head when Draco asked for Harry. “He isn’t here. Haven’t seen him all morning. Nor those new friends of his. I could saddle your Egan, if you liked.”
Draco wanted to rail at the man, but Potter had done it for him. "Kingsley, you can't—" He sighed. "What if it were your family? Would you have stayed home? Can you blame her?"
“Get off, Blaise,” he mumbled, shifting away, and still mostly asleep. “Go back to your own bed. Not in the mood. Told you.”
The other man’s distrust didn’t seem to fade at Draco’s reassurance. “You’re bringing them twigs and branches? Where’s your axe?”
There was a surge of joy inside Draco, and he leaned down to kiss Harry, not even caring when the edges of Harry’s glasses pressed into his cheek as they kissed. Even as they kissed, his hands moved to push up Harry’s tee-shirt, his fingers marking out the lines of Harry’s ribs, then working down over his stomach.
He nodded, looking weary. He turned to one of the guards nearby. “Send for Dumbledore. Looks like we’ll need his help to fix this.” Once the guard had disappeared, he turned back to Harry. “My apologies, King Harry. As you can imagine, things have been in a bit of an uproar here this morning.”
For what felt like forever. Sure, he had a place to sleep, food three times a day, and a guard to watch him. At least, one who came by a few times a day to make sure he was still alive (or at least, Draco suspected he was checking he was, since nothing he said made a bloody difference in getting the man to respond with anything other than the same words every day).
"His mother is my sister. And my home is empty now. He can spend his time when not helping rebuild the Wizarding World taking care of my grandson." She smiled, the expression small and sad. It was reminiscent of Draco's mother in such a way as to make his chest ache. This might be all right after all.
As they made their way through the halls, Draco's worry grew. They didn't head towards the Headmistress's office, but downstairs. Were they going to the dungeons? Or worse, would he be given to an Auror to be tried once more? Had Draco made it through the Death Eater trials only to be arrested for this?
Certainly, none of Harry's friends understand his need to reform Draco. He may well need your empathy, as they seem to have none in this regard. Not only that, but Draco continues to make Harry's life difficult. When Harry tries to take Draco out to get groceries, he complains the entire time. Especially because they go to a Muggle grocer rather than sending the house-elf to a magical one.
Of course, there was, but Draco knew quite well that his mother would be even more horrified by his choice of spouse than she was by the fact that he seemed to have no interest in the girls she’d chosen for him.
The clerk took the papers up to the Minister once they were signed, and after glancing through them, Shacklebolt nodded, then faced Draco. "Very well. I hope, Mister Malfoy, you will take this time to find a better path in life." He glanced at Harry, then Andromeda, then back to Draco. "It seems you have help. If you are wise, you will take the help offered. I sincerely hope we will never meet each other again like this."
“Yeah?” The young man who’d been hidden by the wig raised an eyebrow. “Tell me. Do you always come off this snotty, or come on this strong?”
Draco blinked after him. Now what in the hell was that supposed to mean? He sped after Potter, but his broom was still no match for Potter’s. It wasn’t fair. Time to upgrade, obviously. Maybe he’d go into London. The idea of getting away from Potter again made Draco smile, and he did a one-eighty, then swooped back towards the house.
“Well, I don’t know about that…but…if it is…” Harry reached out to stroke over Draco’s cheek. “I don’t think I’d mind,” he whispered.
He regarded Harry's hand for a long time before taking it, squeezing it in his own. "I'd like that."
“Yes,” Harry whispered, grinding against him faster now, his lips covering Draco’s once more. So real. It was all Draco could do to wind his arms around him, and then he was crying out into Harry’s mouth as he found release, clinging to him until he felt Harry do the same. Then they collapsed against the couch, both drained and panting. “Fuck.”
He had no clue how he was going to fall asleep with his whole body aching the way it was, but he must have, for suddenly there was the bright light of the sun in his eyes, and a shadow standing over him. “Come on, pretty boy. Time to get moving. We’ve still got a long way to go.”
Instead of answering, Harry pulled him close and kissed him again, and Draco could taste the hunger building between them. “Tonight,” Harry said when he pulled away. “I’ll see you then.” And then he was gone.
Were all girls really this dense? “He asked me for your hand,” he told her with a slight smirk, waiting for what he was sure would be a fantastic explosion, no matter what form it took.
Draco tried to fight another flush, raising his chin, but refusing to look away this time. "So? It’s not like you were ever going to like me, so why shouldn’t I treat you that way?"
"I'll be sharing guard duty with a few others, and doing prisoner transfers to the courtrooms. When I'm not busy with other duties."
“I said hai’llow. It’s easier than saying all those syllables, don’t you know?” she said with a grin as she approached. “Are you from the town?”
Blaise took the girl’s elbow, leading her forward to stand in front of the two royals. “Majesty, Highness… It is my pleasure to introduce you to Princess Harriet…of Gryffindor.”
“Diagon Alley. Madam Malkins. The Hogwarts Express, even. Are you saying someone twisted your arm for that?”
“Obviously, it does to you, Draco,” Harry said softly. Draco looked up to see Harry standing at his shoulder.
Draco gaped up at him. What was he supposed to say? He’d never so much as roasted a vegetable before in his life. And Potter could hardly consider it his fault that he’d been so exhausted from the chores the man had given him to do that he’d not cooked.
Draco shook his head. "Stories. Surely this can't be the most exciting job of all time. I can offer a way to make the time go faster. For every day you come visit. What do you think?" He knew it wasn't really much, which was why he'd offered the contract first. It was the more important bit anyway.
Panicking, he stepped back against Snape, purposefully planting his own foot hard on Snape's, in hopes of giving others a chance to escape. The other boy looked at him for a moment. It was a moment before he nodded, then turned and ran as fast as he could from the room. As he ran, he grabbed others, and tugging them along in his wake. Within moments, the room was nearly empty. A few other students were caught, though. Filch had two girls by the arm, ranting at them as they struggled against his hold, and two other students stood by the door, bound.
But Harry didn’t say no. In fact, he didn’t say anything. He just leaned in and pressed his lips to Draco’s muzzle.
Obviously, Harry could feel the spell as well. He pulled back on the handle, then turned and shifted sideways back into the room so that Draco wouldn’t fall off the broom, and landed once more. "Damn. I’d hoped…" He sighed. "I’ll need to go get something. I’ll be back as soon as I can, okay?"
“I said so, didn’t I?” Draco asked with a huff. He should never have told him, honestly. Coming here had been a horrible idea.
By the time Potter returned for his next guard duty, Draco was ready for him. He only hoped his plan would work. When Potter glanced in, Draco was quick to move to the bars.
Draco had to take several minutes to regain what little of his dignity he could manage to scrabble together before going back inside. And then, once inside, he was barely able to restrain himself from telling his parents that he was done and wanted to go to bed. After all, they’d hardly accept his answer if they hadn’t seen him even dancing with anyone since coming back in.
Draco wasn't sure he believed him, but the threat wasn't going to stop him. It was the only entertainment left, and he wasn't about to give that up until it was taken from him. "No? You think not?"
The man laughed. “Padfoot? Oh, he’s harmless. He knows if he’s not, he’ll get snipped, so he sticks to the growling.”
“No. You infuriate me. But…not just…” Potter reached out to try to take Draco’s hand. “Maybe we could…”
It was so peaceful. Harry scratching at his head, the hum of their voices, the soft cloth of Harry’s robe under his scales… Draco snuffled a bit, his eyes closing in pleasure. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this relaxed. And it was all because of Harry.
Despite himself, Draco winced at the slap, and even more, at the threat. If the parties didn't happen again, he might never know who his mystery boyfriend was. "You wouldn't," he said, but he knew Snape could hear the desperation in his voice now.
“Why not? I mean, in a house that size, you must have hundreds of rooms, right? There has to be one closer to yours than the guest wing.”
“Mmm…” Draco nodded. “I was a bit…obnoxious when I left, but I’m better now. So…may I come home?” he asked.
"Perhaps you missed the charges?" He couldn't believe Harry would do this. Surely Harry, of all people, knew Draco deserved his place in Azkaban.
Her eyes widened. “Ooooh, you’re that prince-fellow, aren’t you?” she asked with a grin. “So then you know our Harry?”
Potter shook his head. “Of course not. Someone has to do it, after all, and I’m going to be busy selling all those pretty things your father gave us.”
to happen. What he wasn't expecting was for the large boy to vanish with a pop the way adults did when they apparated.
It all started at a celebration of the ending of a war. It had been a year, and their world was healing. Both boys had taken part in the war, and both had been on opposite sides, but both had ended up on the same side at the very end, and so both were at the celebration.
“Brilliant observation. It took you this long to get to that point, Potter?” Draco asked him with a scowl.
Narcissa seemed to be caught off guard. “That does seem a good number. Draco himself could have done with another sibling or two. But I…never managed.” She sighed, and for the first time since this quest to marry him off had started, Draco wanted to comfort her. His father had always been a busy man, and he knew his mother had always wished for a daughter, but the few pregnancies she’d had after Draco had never made it to term.
He simply had no clue what he could do to prevent his fate. He’d never been anywhere but this tower. He didn’t even know how to escape it. There were no doors, just windows. The witch and her pet just appeared and disappeared at will. Literally. If only he knew how to master that trick… But he did not.
“They must be frantic, then. I mean…if you’re missing…” Draco nodded encouragingly. He couldn’t get close, but these three could, and at least they could tell his parents what had happened to him.
When he woke in the morning, Potter was nowhere to be seen. He dragged himself out of bed, not looking forward to another day filled with chores for the king whose hand he had refused. Still, if he was going to survive long enough to ask his father if he could come home, he’d have to try, at least, wouldn’t he?
The head of the MLE hissed something else into Shacklebolt's ear. Draco could easily make out his words. "And Dumbledore's death?"
Lucius scowled. “Then…I will…approve of your marriage.” The words sounded as though he’d had to struggle to get them out of his mouth at all.
“Good god, Potter! Do you have to go on about it? This is difficult enough without you echoing me.” He moved to a couch, dropping into it, then put his head in his hands, his fingers tangling in his hair.
It was a mistake he wished he’d never made the next morning when he woke to a body curled around his. Of course, at first, he didn’t quite realize just
But Draco wasn’t listening to his father’s words any more. All he saw was Harry, nodding. He took Harry’s hand, lacing their fingers together, then led the way up the stairs from the garden to the hall leading to his tower. Once they’d reached the sanctuary of the stairs leading up inside his tower, he pulled Harry close.
Draco looked up, surprised, and saw Harry was holding out his hand. Draco's world was suddenly spun around on its axis, and everything he'd known before stepping into this room today was turned on its head.
Mother and Severus tried to argue me against it, but I was long set on my path by then, and nothing they could have said would have changed my mind.
Draco nodded, not wanting to show how the affiliation upset him now. "Yes. My…several Death Eaters entered Hogwarts because of it."
When Potter appeared to greet them as well, Draco sneered, then moved to the gate, hoping to see his father’s carriage arriving, but it was nowhere in sight, so all he could do was wait.
Draco scowled. "Not even about father? Please… I just want to know he's all right. And mother. I know you stood up for her before. Do you know…?"
Draco stood to leave as well, but Lucius was not finished chastising his son. Neither son nor father noticed that the door had been left open a small gap, nor did they notice that there was someone just outside listening to every word that was said.
Unfortunately, Draco had no such illusion for himself. Just the thought that he might run into the other man made his heart sink in his chest. How could he face someone who was his true equal when he’d been turned into—well, there was no other word for it, really—a drudge? Especially when he’d insulted the man so badly.
“As soon as possible. I’ve moved into the Weasleys’ place, but I’m sure you can imagine how crowded things are there. Not to mention how difficult, what with losing one of their sons. I’d rather not impose on them any longer than necessary.”
“Eighteen years, actually,” Snape agreed. “But one family member was smuggled out of the country. And has now been found. And he would like to ally himself with your kingdom, sire. He knows that if he is to restore his kingdom, allies will be vital.”
"All right," Harry said, still grinning. He pulled his broom from the wall where he’d braced it, then straddled it. "Just straddle the handle, and hold on tight. It’ll probably be a bit scary at first, since you won’t be able to steer, but you’ll be fine, okay?"
After a few minutes, the man nodded. "All right. I ask you respect my privacy while I'm here. I have my reasons. Let's leave it at that."
In only a matter of moments, Draco appears in the living room of the flat, his bags beside him. “See you around, Potter,” he says, and then he is gone.
It was simply too much of a temptation for Draco to say no. “All right.” He smiled. “Thank you.” He moved to the road, where the horse was grazing, approaching it slowly, watching carefully until he was sure the horse would accept a touch. He couldn’t help but wish he had an apple to offer the beast. The horses at home had always been fond of apples. “You’re a good beast, aren’t you?” he murmured.
And so did the dreams Draco was having. As did the memory of that morning, waking to feel Potter wrapped around him. How…right it felt to him, now. And every time he thought that, Draco would grow disgusted with himself, and leave the house to find other distractions. But he was never gone for long. And Harry was always there when he returned.
He left the room without another word, going to the bathroom and going downstairs to get some toast. When he returned, his host was gone again. He hadn't actually expected him to stay. Though he'd secretly wished he would.
“I…I don’t…” Seeing Harry’s face fall at the word, Draco swallowed thickly. He hadn’t met that. He squeezed Harry's hands and nodded instead. “I think so.”
And they lived happily ever after. (Except for Lucius, who even after the boys managed to have two heirs, one for each kingdom, continued to be bitter that his son married into the Gryffindor family, rather than claiming their kingdom for his own, as Lucius had felt was his birthright.)
Even before he could stop it, Draco found himself smiling. He clasped Harry's hand. "I'd like that."
“That’s what I keep telling them, but…” Draco sighed then looked down. “They do have a point. It’s very dangerous if I end up with some odd connection to someone, and…”
worked, because he could feel Harry’s lips against his cheek, and then he was shifting his face and pressing very human lips to Harry’s, his hands going around Harry’s neck as he shifted to settle in his lap properly.
Draco sighed. If he were honest with himself, he wasn't sure why he was bothering. After all, even if Harry did remember, what would it change? Perhaps Harry was right, and he should just forget it.
Draco grabbed one of the potions, and threw it at Fenrir, which made the man howl and fall back. Draco tucked his knees up around Harry, shuddering, even as Harry pulled the broom up higher into the trees. "God…"
When Potter knocked on the door at ten, Draco was wearing not only pyjamas and underwear, but also his thickest winter robe. He pulled open the door and waved Potter in, but the other man stood there, just staring at Draco. “Aren’t you…a bit warm?”
The day of the feast, the King and Queen spent the day showing off their new son to their people. He was dressed in a long, lacy gown that had been worn by generations of princes and princesses before him, laid out in a golden bassinette so that the people could file past to get a look at the sweet face of their future ruler.
“Unfortunately it’s all I have available right now. The food is packed away in the wagon, and it would be too much hassle to dig it out. And we don’t have time to stop and hunt for anything…”
Draco blinked at the name, but now was not the time to deal with suspicions, and he turned back to his father. “Do you have a handkerchief, father?”
“Yes, well…the company’s suddenly got a bit too crowded for me,” Draco answered with a scowl in Potter’s direction.
“Startled?” The King looked dubious about this suggestion at best. “And how would you suggest we accomplish that, Dumbledore?”
Draco nodded then waited for the dismissal so he could go back to his rooms. Lucius seemed to know that he was up to something, as even with Draco’s assurances, he stretched out his permission, leaving his son standing uncomfortably in front of him for several minutes before he finally nodded. “We will see you tomorrow, then.”
“Then stand still, Draco. The poor girl is simply trying to do her job.” Narcissa stepped forward and fiddled with the collar of his robes. “At least it’s a flattering color.”
“I want to know,” Harry whispered. “Even if…” His hand made another aborted movement, and Draco reached out to take it.
But there was no choice. If I failed, not only would father not be freed, but mother would be at risk as well. He would destroy us all, merely to show he could.
At the word ‘friend,’ Draco felt as though he’d been stabbed, and he had to stand up and look away. “Right. But these…strangers apparently mean more?”
They made their way up the road, both lost in their own thoughts. At the turn-off for the hut, Draco paused, not sure if he should go with Weasley up to the palace, or go home and prepare supper. After all, it was almost dinner-time, too.
“Yes, well…I have to admit, the bed was very soft. And yet…” Harriet blushed again. “Something kept…poking me.”
Not that he knew the true identity of his new boyfriend. But somehow, they found one another each time. He'd never known anyone he felt more at ease with. The other boy seemed almost to know him better than he knew himself. Even though they never admitted their names to one another.
“Quite a bit,” Lucius growled, turning to his son. “I will give you five minutes. If you have not returned with the prince in that amount of time, I will be coming after you.”
Harry went quiet at that. “Yeah.” He swallowed heavily then sat down on a nearby bench. “Look, Draco…about that…”
The horror must have shown on Draco’s face at that, for Weasley was quick to reassure him. “I promise he doesn’t bite. He’s actually quite soft-hearted…” He blinked for a moment, then frowned. “Well, most of the time…” He muttered something under his breath that Draco didn’t catch, then turned and pulled the cart onto the road.
Harry and Weasley's sister never got back together after the final battle the way everyone, including Weasley and his sister, expected. Instead, Potter seemed more focused on his studies than Draco recalled from before the war. He watched him the first few months of school, but aside from Granger, who was obviously not interested in anything but her studies this year, he didn't seem to show  any interest in any girl. Or any boy, really.
Understand, I had no concept of what my father truly meant. Yes, I believed Muggles and Muggleborn were a blight, it was their fault we needed to be so careful and sparing with our magic. But I had no concept of why, or what might happen to those people we deemed Muggle or Muggleborn. It was an abstract concept at best.
What might surprise some is that for once, he has no fear of this place, though he should. But then, he is a Gryffindor, and Gryffindors laugh at danger, do they not? Particularly when they are coming to beard a dragon in its den, as it were.
for Harry, just pointed out someone of Harry’s size for her to estimate from. The robes weren’t finished until the very day of the ball, and Draco had no time to take the robes to his friend in person, so he sent his page to deliver them to Harry, and hoped that they would get to him in time.
Draco nodded, then nuzzled him more insistently. He couldn’t kiss in this form. Not in any way he could think of. All he could do was hope that Harry got the clue.
The King watched him for a moment before nodding. “Very well. But if I should lose my son, Dumbledore…”
“I’ll escort them, mother,” Draco said, before Narcissa could drag him off to fill his ears with reasons why he could never marry this girl.
The members of the court turned to her in shock. Even the King could do no more than blink. Finally, he waved to their guests. “Thank you for coming. I think the Queen and I should retire now. But the feast is prepared, and we hope you will enjoy it, whether or not we are here.” The wizards all nodded and moved to seat themselves, and the King and Queen swept from the room, trying to comfort themselves that they would have at least eighteen good years with their son. Even though both knew it could never be enough.
Blinking at that, Draco looked into his lap. He truly hadn’t ever thought of it that way, but it was hardly going to be something he’d admit to Potter, whether or not they were getting on. "It…doesn’t matter," he finally said softly.
“You’ll be a gorgeous bride in whatever you wear,” Harry tells her. And yet, his voice is flat when he responds. He does not seem happy at this coming wedding they are speaking of. Should not every young man who is to marry his school days sweetheart be pleased?
Supper dragged on, unendurably long, with Potter and Narcissa chatting amiably the entire time and completely ignoring the other two occupants of the table. Finally, when the last course was finished, Potter rose to his feet.
“Hai’llow!” he heard someone call, and turned to see a girl with short bright pink hair and wearing breeches.
Harry didn’t seem to want to slow, though. And really, Draco wasn’t about to stop him. "How far do we have to go?" he asked.
Draco followed suit. “At least say you’ll come again tomorrow, to give me a bit of relief from those fools inside?”
"No. It is not." He shuffled through the papers in front of him once more. "The attempts on Albus Dumbledore's life. Those happened—"
This time, it was Harry’s turn to blush, and Draco raised an eyebrow as Harry turned away. “Wasn’t so bad,” he heard him mutter.
So it was Draco Malfoy found himself in a new home, surrounded by beautiful things, but always alone save for the lone house-elf who came to visit him every day.
"Spoiled rotten… everyone told me you weren't worth it. I should have listened to them. It won't work, Draco. You won't get me to feel sorry for you. I trusted you once. I won't make that mistake a second time."
Draco glanced between Potter and his father, then moved closer to Potter again. “Will there be more lessons?” he asked, and suddenly he wasn’t sure what he wanted the answer to be.
Draco nodded, then relaxed infinitesimally as his mother swept away. He knew this was going to be difficult. It would have been even before they’d found where Harriet was from. But now? Narcissa would do everything in her power to prevent this marriage, he knew. How could Blaise handicap them this way?
Slowly, he began to undress, leaving the dirty robes where they could be found and cleaned by the servants, then made his way to the chamber where his bed sat, dressed only in thin cotton breeches.
Draco nodded. "Yes. I think so. Might be a few days in the telling, though, depending on how long you can stay."
Draco nodded slowly. “Who should I tell my parents you were, when they ask who I met in the gardens?” Something about this man was off, but Draco wasn’t sure what, beyond the way the man’s smile made him shiver.
The following weeks, Draco tried to fall back into his normal patterns, but for some reason, he couldn’t recall what they were. The few he could remember no longer felt right. Like he didn’t fit. He felt awkward, and strange, and even clubbing with Blaise no longer helped to distract him.
“So uncomplicate it, Harry.” He almost wanted to ask why Harry could ever want to leave him, but knew he could never do that. Harry wouldn’t understand the loss he’d feel if they were separated. To him, they were just friends.
As it was, Draco was quite sure he’d have to murder the git before the week was out. Everywhere he went, Potter seemed to find a way to be there before he’d arrived. Shouldn’t he be getting lost in this huge place? How did he always seem to know where Draco was going? Or did he just follow him somehow? He’d go to the Library, to find Potter standing at one of the shelves, pulling out a book—often the very book he himself had come to retrieve. Other times, he’d go out to the gardens to wander among the flowers only to find Potter wandering towards him from the opposite direction. It was like he was somehow planning it!
"Since you couldn't seem to follow a simple instruction, I suppose we will need to make certain no further parties occur."
By the day of the wedding, anyone with eyes can see that Harry is having second, or possibly even third, fourth or fifth thoughts. He is very unhappy, despite his best friends’ encouragement that it is nothing more than nerves. It is only the sight of Draco arriving for the wedding that finally draws him out of his funk. Not only is it the first time he has seen Draco since the day the blond came to see him at his flat, but it is also the first time Draco has been seen in public since that day.
“Oh, come on, Moony. I know you don’t know her, but Narcissa grabs every opportunity to control the situation, just like my dear mother. The poor boy’s doomed.”
Queen Narcissa shook her head, her expression saying what she obviously felt she could not. “Well, I suppose you will just have to learn in your own time, won’t you?” And then, before Harry could respond, she turned. “I suppose I’ll have to see if Lucius has managed to find more candidates.” Then she crossed the garden, and disappeared through the door leading into the palace.
“Thank you, father. I can take it from here.” Even as he stepped away from his father, he could sense others around and in front of himself. How he’d missed this before, he didn’t know. Each person had a singular signature, and Draco moved through the room, deftly avoiding the others, searching for the green-red-gold that was Harry, smiling when he “saw” him standing near four other signatures—one black-gold-silver, one brown-red-grey, one black-green-silver, and the last a bright burst of vibrant colors, some of which seemed to have no name he could think of.
to be groped by him. Seemed almost offended when I went off to dance with my next partner.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Believe me, he won’t be the one I choose, even if mother and father force the issue.”
When the sun reached the top of the trees, Draco began to shake. He knew what would happen if Fenrir arrived and smelled Harry here once more. And if Harry were
And Potter ended up with my wand. Not an outcome I'd have predicted, and definitely not something I was pleased about. But perhaps it all worked out for the best.
! He blinked open crusty eyes to see Potter standing over him. “You didn’t even make supper last night. When I came home, you were fast asleep. What happened?”
“No?” Harry looked confused. “Sirius…isn’t your ability a rather rare gift? I mean…it’s not something farmers tend to learn, is it?”
“She will if everyone holds up their part, Pansy. Now, are you going to help us, or…?” He let the threat dangle, knowing anything she could think of would be far more devastating than anything he might suggest.
"What?" The word made no sense. At least not at first. Until he remembered his conversation with his host. Yes, he'd suspected he was Harry. That didn't make it true. This did.
He was woken at dawn by the sound of a rooster. Not that he knew it was a rooster. Just that it was the rudest bird he’d ever had his misfortune to meet.
Draco brought a hand to Harry’s cheek. “Look at me. Please. Want to see this. I’ve been dreaming about it for…” He smiled as he realized just how short a time it had been. “A week. Well…sort of. Please don’t look away now?”
“He saved my life. Twice. And saved all three of us from Azkaban, father. If not, we’d have lost everything! What was I supposed to do?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh, please, Potter. What I feel will never change. So you might as well pack up and go back to the Weasels and leave me be, because this is getting you nowhere.”
There was a sigh, then the door opened again. “It’s okay, Hermione.” Potter appeared, moving to stand next to her. “If I can handle Voldemort, I can handle Draco Malfoy.”
Draco nodded slowly, afraid to even glance at Harry, now that he was so close to getting his father’s permission for this. It was far too good to be true. “Of course, father.”
"I do. But I can't. I'm sorry." And then Potter hurried down the corridor to the next cell before Draco could try anything more.
He towed the load home on his back, moaning with new pain in his back by the time he got to the cottage, and realized it was already noon. How on earth would he get it all done in time? Perhaps there were spells that he could use to help him? He’d not used his wand while on the road because Potter had forbidden it, but surely now… All he could do was try.
Narrowing his eyes, Potter glowered at him for another long minute, and for a moment, Draco wondered if he'd actually pushed too hard. Potter stepped back and leant against the wall.
He nodded. "Yes, headmistress." After all, it was sort of true. He hadn't planned it with Harry, but he wouldn't deny his support now.
Making a face, Draco shook his head. They’d never get anywhere at this rate. He huffed, and a small puff of smoke emerged from his mouth. He started.
Their faces were so close together now, and all it took was a slight shift, and Draco’s lips were brushing against Potter’s. Potter responded with a soft sigh, pressing back, but letting Draco lead the kiss. Draco opened his mouth, and found Potter echoing the move. His tongue slipped into the open and willing mouth, and it was all Draco could do not to groan. He pressed against Potter, the kiss increasing in intensity with every second that passed.
The kiss stretched out until one of them moaned. Draco wasn’t sure which of them it was, but it woke him from the dream-like state, and he pulled back to look at Harry. “Harry?”
The dog turned his great grey eyes on the man and muttered something, then set his head back on his paws, closing his eyes once more.
But there's another part to the story. Do you know that bit? About what else was in Pandora's box? Ah, well, that happened, too. And because of it, because I finally understood, everything changed again.
It was only a moment before Narcissa turned back to look at her son. “So…this is who you wish to marry, Draco?”
Her lips pursed, and she glanced at Draco with a far more stern expression now. "I see. And the others?"
Draco saw Harry’s eyes flash at that. “I think, majesty, that when all seemed lost, Sirius and Remus were the two most likely to stand by me, and they are the reason I am even standing here today. The rest is just so much noise. What do I care what they do in the privacy of their rooms?”
Draco groaned and sat up, then gasped as his arms seized up from the unfamiliar workout they’d been put through the day before. “Oh, god…”
The man bowed low, folding nearly in half, his long, stringy hair brushing the floor before he stood up once more. “Severus Snape, Highness. Representative to the Prince of Gryffindor. He did not wish to meet you formally this way, but would like to speak to you out in the gardens, if he might?”
He stated it as though he had given me a boon. As though I should bow and scrape and thank him for this favour of favours. But I knew it even then for what it was—a death sentence. Even should I succeed—and how could I, a mere student, ever manage to kill the greatest wizard who ever lived?—there was no way I would make it out of the castle alive. The castle itself would rise up against me, surely?
Snape, a great alchemist, gave the boy a potion for increasing intelligence. McGonagall, a shape-shifter, gave the boy the ability to change his shape. The great truth-sayer, Skeeter, was next. She gave the boy the ability to always use truth to its best advantage. And after her came Moody, a great warrior-mage, who gave the boy the ability to always be aware of the danger around him. Next was Tonks, who gave him the ability to be whoever he could wish. Flitwick cast a charm that would increase his attractiveness as he grew. Sprout brought him a plant that would grow to shield the palace as he grew, so it would eventually become a part of the castle’s internal protections. Slughorn cast a spell that would give the boy charisma, drawing people to him.
"Probably not," Harry agreed. He smiled at Draco, squeezing his shoulder, and seeming to sense his distress. "I’ll be back as soon as I can, okay?"
Both father and son looked at her, dubious. “If you say so, Narcissa. But if that boy so much as threatens…”
It wasn't until I'd faced the Dark Lord himself I understood. There was nothing but hate in his snake-like eyes. Not for me, not for my father, not for our plight…  We were all just tools to him. And we would all die at his whim.
Right now, sandwiches sounded like a feast to Draco, so he nodded, almost smiling at that. “Thank you.” Now all he had to do was last until Potter decided to stop. He could do that, at least. Right?
"The kingdom just over the border from here, actually. I was just visiting your kingdom here. They told me not to use this path, but it’s the quickest route home, and I’m very resourceful, so I wasn’t too worried. May I come up?"
Meeting his new friend’s eyes, he shook his head. "I don’t. Maybe once I did, but…not now. Take me with you?"
He’d not told any of his friends about what the boy hero had asked of him, but Blaise was good at getting those sorts of details out of him. He’d had to swear Blaise to secrecy, and even after his friend had promised, Draco had had to endure quite a bit of teasing about it.
“Of course, Draco,” Potter said with that same smile. That smile was definitely going to cause him problems.
Harry smiled wider. "Yes. I brought a broom that should hold us both. All you have to do is hold on to my waist. Can you do that?"
Draco shifted, curling deeper into his pillow. Except that it didn’t give like a pillow. And it grunted. “Ow. Draco, please…”
The queen looked stunned. “Under twenty down mattresses? Well…I would say…that definitely proves you are of royal blood, if a pea so deeply buried can disrupt your sleep so.” She stood and moved to stand in front of them.
With a sigh, Harry pulled back. “Ginny’s dating Neville. I made her wait a bit too long, I guess. And…they work together well, so…” He smiled softly. “I’m happy for them. I was a bit lonely, but… And honestly, Draco I never really think about these things until they’re shoved under my nose. So why should this be any different?”
He hurried to pack a bag, then rang for a servant. There were things he would need that he didn’t know how to access here. But a servant would know.
“That is true, Harry. But that is because it is not a spell, truly. Merely started by one. He needs to choose to come back. And right now…he seems rather more happy as a dragon than he might be as an eighteen-year-old boy who is about to be married, wouldn’t you say?”
Both men turned to Draco, and at the curious expression on his father’s face, he felt the bottom drop out of his world once more. “I see.” His father had known. And expected Draco to stay. Regardless.
A war rose inside Draco, and he couldn't decide where to start. "Knew…what was me?" he finally asked.
“Right. And that’s supposed to make me want to meet them?” Draco scowls at Harry, then stalks to his room, and all Harry can do is watch him go, and sigh. Do you empathize with his plight yet, dear reader?
For our Hope saved us, just like everyone knew he would. Potter defeated Voldemort, and it was because of me he could. For in taking my wand, in defeating me, he became the master of the Elder Wand. Not that I'd known at the time, of course, but still a far better outcome than Voldemort winning and destroying the Wizarding World.
"No. I wouldn't wish them on Malfoy, let alone you. I'll… go talk to them." He met Draco's eyes. "This doesn't mean I believe you, Malfoy."
Robards scowled down at him. "Despite Snape's dubious affiliations, this boy still had a hand in the headmaster's death."
Draco blinked. Shacklebolt couldn't really mean that, could he? Five years community service seemed like nothing. "S-sir?"
After a moment, Draco shook his head. They didn’t know, after all. They’d think he was just a beast as Harry and his friends had.
“Never you mind, Potter.” He tugged on Blaise’s arm again. “Come on. We’re leaving. Or I’ll leave without you,” he told Blaise, barely able to hold back the snarl.
"Well, I saw—" He glanced at Draco, then back up at Shacklebolt. "Voldemort forced him to use the spell to punish another Death Eater for failing him, sir."
Draco grinned. “I guess so.” He kissed Harry again. That bit was not going to get old any time soon. Each kiss seemed more addictive than the last. Finally, he pulled back to look at Harry again. “So…now what?”
Draco chanced a glance at Harry now that the worst was over. After all, Harry had kissed back, hadn’t he? That must mean something. He wasn’t disappointed. Harry didn’t look horrified. In fact, he looked—almost pleased.
"Malfoy and I hoped it might be beneficial, especially to the upper years, if we got a chance to unwind this year. I mean, after everything these past few years, well, we've all gone through a lot, ma'am."
The courtyard was filled with gawkers, everyone trying to get a glimpse of the girl that had arrived, her horse riding behind Blaise’s stallion. Draco ignored the whispers and approached his friend, chin high. “Blaise. You’ve returned.” Not even looking at the ‘girl,’ he said, “And who is this?”
The tall, regal man who faces Harry is Draco’s father, Lucius. “What do you want with us, Potter? I have paid my debt to society, and my son and wife were ruled free of any wrongdoing.”
"You. The thorn in my side, the light to my dark, and vice versa. You are…" He smirked. "Well, really, you're the only proper choice for a Malfoy."
“Yes. Though we are a bit concerned that they seem too friendly already. I mean…Harry doesn’t even know him! Just…this dragon. That’s not the same thing.”
Potter showed five minutes before it would have gone off. Apparently, he’d been taking advice from someone about how to dress to impress. Tight jeans, a loose white shirt open at the neck and revealing flashes of his chest, which made Draco flush again and remind himself that this was
Some of the hope went out of Harry’s eyes. “Oh. That’s…why you asked me about firsts, wasn’t it? You want me to…?”
But Draco couldn't shake the sudden realization, and turned away. "Did you want anything else?" he asked.
But Draco knew that it was only a matter of time before Fenny did anyway. He was growing up, and for some reason, this upset his "aunt." She told him that soon he would have to prove his worth, and that he would do so far better if he were like Fenny than as he was, which even Draco had to admit to himself some days was just a plain and rather ordinary boy.
Draco decided that maybe those dreams hadn’t been a bad thing after all. Not with this sort of reaction, at any rate. And that he hoped Harry intended to provide a
“He did? And you…why? You know…” Potter’s voice dropped, and Draco shifted closer, trying to stay hidden but get close enough to catch their words.
But unbeknownst to the two arguing, another person had entered the room, and he chose this moment to clear his throat. The two turned, and Draco’s eyes widened as he took in the sight of the bedraggled man before them. His clothing was made more of patches than of whole cloth, and his hair was horribly bedraggled—or at least, the bits of it he could see beneath the peasant’s cap was. And horribly greasy from not being washed for some time.
"Clerk, if you will get her signature and the prisoner's as well, we will be able to release him into your care, Mrs Tonks."
“But you look so good in white, darling.” She smiled. “Not that anyone would care what you wore, but it is always better to wow. Especially in this sort of situation.”
Draco looked back over his shoulder, and saw the man still standing there, glowering at him. Turning back to Harry, he made a face. “He…doesn’t seem to like me much.”
There were shouts from behind him: delight, astonishment, horror from a few, then his guards, gormless as ever, tore open the door without a word and ran up the stairs, shouting his name as though they didn’t know he couldn’t possibly be in there. Apparently, they believed their own lies. He shook his head and rolled his eyes, turning back to Harry.
“I think he should come live with me. Spend some time with me and my circle of friends. Instead of acting like a constant letch like he does. You do want him to be accepted, don’t you? This way I repay what your wife did for me, and he and I can work on what your family owes me. A fair arrangement, don’t you think?”
“Good. Because as soon as you convince father tomorrow, we’re going to be betrothed, and if you look at another guy, I’ll have to have you convicted of treason for betraying your future king,” he said smugly.
Some would say I'm taking a bit too much responsibility for the darkness we've so recently been through, but I don't. I know what I've done. I deserve worse than I am getting. Not that anyone else thinks so.
Still, it was difficult to watch Harry mount his broom and fly back through the trees. It felt like he’d never see him again.
Before Harry could explain, Fenrir jumped out at them from one side of the path Harry’d been following. He reached for Draco’s leg, making him scream as talons dug into his trousers.
“Boring, like I said. Makes my job a bit easier, I suppose. Otherwise Egan over there would still be having difficulties.”
“I don’t think so. The girls rarely stayed more than a day. So hopefully by tomorrow…” He’d be tasting those lips. They were certainly quite full. “You…do like other men, right?”
The King’s lips narrowed at this, and he gathered himself for a moment before responding. “You are the heir to the throne. I hope you realize that love must come second to duty?”
But Harry seems unwilling to see or hear now. The month spent with Draco seems to have drained him of something—hope, perhaps? “Whatever this is about, Malfoy…just…leave it.” And he closes the door in Draco’s face.
“Nothing,” Draco interrupted. He had to know if this was a one-off or more. Now. “Not compared to…what we could do. I mean…if you like.” Draco couldn’t help but hold his breath as he waited to hear what Harry would say to that.
All he could do was hope something would happen tonight that would cause that to be unnecessary. Not that he had any clue what that could plausibly be. He knew what he hoped for, but that was as unlikely as snow in the summertime.
Snape pushed Draco to the front of the hall, stopping him right in front of the Head table, where McGonagall and several of the Professors ate. She gazed down at the two of them for a moment, then focused on Snape. "Professor Snape, what is this about?"
Draco let Potter move to the far side of the bed, then watched despite himself as he took off his robe. He was dressed only in a short night-shirt. It was a rather warm night, and Draco felt overheated already. He told himself that absolutely none of it had to do with how well-muscled Potter’s calves were.
Snape wasn’t easily dissuaded, unfortunately. “If you think I will allow you to do to this girl what your father did to your mother, Prince Draco… We cannot afford another war between our two countries. Ours has barely recovered from the last.”
Once inside, he repeated his spell from the day before, this time managing a quite passable beef stew, and cut up some bread and cheese to go with it, serving it up just as he heard the cart outside. He was about to go out and ask Weasley if he wanted some food, when he heard voices.
Who am I? Oh, well, I'm sure most have heard my name. Or at least my father's. Draco Malfoy. Yes, that Malfoy. The one who let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. The one who caused Dumbledore's death. The one who foolishly took the Mark shortly after his sixteenth birthday because it was the only way he could think of to free his father. Never mind father deserved to be there.
Moony put a hand on Padfoot’s shoulder. “No…wait, Sirius. Look at him. He looks as startled as we are. I don’t think he knew he could do that…Like…he’s new to the form.” He shot a pointed look at the other man.
But Harry wasn’t alone. There was a rather raggedy man standing in the door of the stables talking softly to Harry, and Harry was shaking his head.
“No need, highness. Here she comes now,” Blaise said, moving closer to his side. When Draco looked towards the door, he was horrified. Harriet looked as though she had literally tumbled from the bed and come straight to the hall. Draco's eyes widened. What had he done? Had he ruined any chance to marry someone he was actually compatible with?
Draco was floored at this. Sirius was…a pouf? He’d never really considered the idea at all before now, really. Poufs were just people to stay away from, and deal with as little as possible. But while Sirius was a bit obnoxious, he’d in no way struck Draco as any different than he was. So…what did that mean, then?
As for Draco, the glares bounced off his happy bubble. He had everything he needed, and come the summer, he and Harry would become the new kings of Slytherin, and ring in a new golden age for their kingdom. Everything was perfect.
Draco took a long ride. After his encounter, he needed it. What he didn’t need was to run into another stranger. An even mover bizarre stranger than the one at the royal stables.
Potter pulled back, blinking. "Woah. Sorry, Draco. I just meant…" He sighed and shook his head at Draco's glare. "So…what was the next about?"
When Draco finished, Potter was staring at him as though he had a horn growing from his head. "So…wait…your father trusted
They flew on that way for another stretch of time, and finally Draco relaxed enough to look around. While in the tower, he’d had little to do but read, but he had read as much as his aunt would allow. And there had been times when she’d been indulgent enough to bring him anything he’d asked for, so he’d had plenty of stories to choose from. So he knew about trees and woods and animals and streams… Still, reading about the world was very different from seeing it first-hand. It was all rather beautiful, he thought.
Weasley watched him for a moment, as though he wanted to ask him something, then seemed to change his mind. “Well, I do hope you’ll like our kingdom here…” he paused, looking at Draco expectantly.
The boy stood, reaching for his glasses and adjusting them on his face before peering at Draco. Draco realized they were about the same age. He dusted himself off, then nodded, meeting Draco's eyes with the brightest green eyes Draco had ever seen. "I guess. You shouldn't have done that. What if he doesn't come back? What will I tell my aunt?"
Somehow, hearing the words made it scarier. He supposed he'd expected to be reassured by knowing one way or another. But his own sentence still lingered in his future.
After a moment, the man nodded. "I'll see what I can manage." He turned to leave, and Draco felt more alone than before.
The invitation stated all students should come as they were, and that the masks would disguise any house colours any student might choose to wear.
Sleep was the only comfort, now, for in dreams, he was still there. In dreams, their conversations took on new meaning. And together, they built something more together.
Draco had to bite his lip at that, and it took all his willpower to keep the blush from spreading too far across his face.
At that, Draco looked wide-eyed at the two men. They were lovers? Harry had chosen to travel to their kingdom with two who were lovers? And had felt comfortable with it?
It took a few moments before Draco could put into words what exactly was wrong, but finally, he looked up at his friend. “Have you had your first?” he asked.
Harry led the way to one of the interrogation chambers, and Draco tried to remind himself this wasn't going to be like before, with Aurors badgering him about every little thing he might have done. This would just be Harry and him talking. Hopefully about that day.
"Yes, about the spells. I witnessed at least one use of the Cruciatus curse myself, sir. And though Draco will not say as much, I believe he was given no choice not to refuse by his Master, sir."
He heard the two boys talking, and come down to see. When he'd seen the bigger boy hit the smaller one, he'd scowled. "Why isn't he allowed on the beach?" he asked, stepping out of the shadow of the tree.
As Draco felt his cheeks heat even more, he stood and moved to the window again. He was hardly going to discuss his sexual preferences with Potter, after all. “Does it matter?”
Draco wanted to laugh, but his emotions were in such turmoil right now that he wasn’t sure he’d be able. “So…if…I wanted…”
"Look, I should go. But enjoy the journal." And before Draco could say good bye, he hurried off down the hall.
He looked away from Harry and back toward the lighted windows then sighed. “I should probably get back, before father sends the guards to search for me. I don’t suppose you’ll come in?”
"It's the rules, Malfoy. Any prisoner out of their cell or in court is required to have shackles. Be glad I only bound your wrists."
Harry didn’t answer, and Draco still didn’t pull away as he leaned in and pressed his lips to Draco’s. It wasn’t a long kiss. Or even much of anything, really. Just a brush of lips, then they were gone, and Harry was on his feet. “Sorry. I…”
He let Harry lead him from the hall, noticing none of Harry's friends seemed at all surprised or worried. He kept silent until they left the castle, then stopped, tugging Harry to a halt as well. "Potter…why?"
He turned back to the stricken couple. The Queen was clinging to her husband, tears streaking her face. “Please,” she begged.
Draco’s heart sank for a moment. It was as though his father had slapped him in the face. But then he remembered that his father didn’t know the full truth. “Come inside. Let me explain, at least?”
“He’s…father made him my personal guard when I was born, and he seems to have decided that since he failed me before, now he’s got to be extra vigilant. I don’t think it would have mattered who you were.” He smiled at Draco. “He’ll get over it.”
Potter looked at him for a moment, sizing him up, then shook his head. “No…that’s all right.” He turned to the door, locking it with a spell, then turned back to look at Draco again. “So…what is it that you need to explain?”
A soft, mellow voice, but one that could never possibly pass as female, answered him. “I’m shocked not to see Muggles hanging from the trees for the least infractions.”
Draco shook his head. He hadn’t meant to upset the last one. He’d just been so frustrated by the whole process that he’d reacted naturally.
“Halfway, at least?” Harry asked. “I promise I won’t let them hurt you. That’s what has you worried, isn’t it?”
Draco felt his cheeks flush a bit. “They’re worried about the connection it will cause,” he said softly. “They want it to be someone who they will be able to keep in the family. They’re scared it would give someone too much control over the kingdom, otherwise.” He met his friend’s eyes. “What was it like?”
“He’s just enjoying himself, Sirius. Honestly.” Harry sighed, and continued to scratch at his head. “It’s too bad we can’t take him with us. I bet the Prince would love a pet dragon.”
“That…” Harry stroked his cheek again. “That I think I might…love you. That I certainly would, given time. That I wanted to make you happy.”
After the disaster of the Gryffindor/Slytherin Quidditch match, where they lost 420 to 10, Draco knew they needed to take matters into their own hands. There was no way they'd be able to manage another six months of life like this.
Draco glared at him. "Why don't you try it and find out?" Rather than give him a chance to respond, Draco tried to rise again, much slower than before, and was grateful when he was able to stand, even if his legs felt slightly wobbly.
Draco sighed. “I’ll give you my wand. Not that I could use it on you, now. It still recognizes you as its owner.”
But apparently, Harry knew. “What? That he loves a man, rather than a woman? What’s so deviant about that? Love is love, majesty.”
"Just me. Except when my aunt comes to visit." Draco wanted to ask for his help, but at the same time, he didn’t know this young man. He might be worse than the witch or Fenrir. "Do you live nearby?"
"But we agreed the charges against him are more than enough, Robards." Shacklebolt tapped his papers against the desk as though to straighten them, even as murmuring filled the courtroom. Sighing, he picked up his gavel and tapped it instead. "I must ask everyone to keep silent. This is a formal hearing, and we require silence to proceed. Any further disturbances will be dealt with as necessary." He waited for everyone to quiet, then focused on Draco once more. "Mister Malfoy, after you left Hogwarts that year, where did you go?"
Twelve invitations were sent out to all corners of the land, inviting the great witches and wizards, but in all their plans, there was one they neglected. The same wizard who had helped them conceive a child. He was a wizard most did their best to avoid, for he was bitter and dark, and usually more inclined to cause misery and sorrow than joy. So despite his help, the King felt it best not to invite him with the rest. When the wizard heard of the Prince’s birth, but no invitation arrived, he decided to make his displeasure known.
"My cousin. A great fat lump good for nothing but being a roast pig at someone's feast. Why? Going to find a way to taunt me about him, too? Won't work."
“Here, Draco.” Harry stepped out of a shadow, and into the moonlight, and Draco gasped. If Harry had been stunning in his first two outfits, this one took Draco’s breath away. Even more so because it nearly matched the outfit Draco had once seen in his dream.
Finally, on his third day of lurking in the Ministry atrium, Potter strode past, lost in his thoughts. It took three times of Draco calling out to him for Potter to hear him. When he saw who it was, his face clouded. “And what do you want, Malfoy?”
However, before Draco could respond, a great clattering sound came from the courtyard. “What in the world is that din?” He stood and moved to the window and gazed out to see what had happened. What he saw made his heart leap in his chest. “He’s back.”
“He is still their son, Harry. I mean, granted, he’s probably pretty grateful right now because you helped him, but what about later?”
"So?" Draco answered. "I didn't know what the magic would do, but I knew if he got me angry enough, it would do
Draco nudged Harry’s shoulder with his head, and Harry turned to blink at him. “What, Draco? Did you need something?”
When he arrived in the living room, it was to see him with the list. It took him only a moment before he realized what it was. "That's not…"
Raising an eyebrow and fixing his father with the most imperious stare he had ever managed in his life, Draco sighed. “Yes, father. I had noticed. But, as
Draco and his friends, there to prove they had not simply passed by their teachers the previous year, fared the worst of the lot. Everyone blamed them, Marked or not, for their families' part in the war. Each day, the ostracism seemed worse. And the teachers seemed uwilling to do anything about it.
Draco nodded. It wasn’t even lying, if he really thought about it. But the idea that Harry would be his first, as he’d always dreamed…even better, that he might be allowed more… “Harry?”
“Guess not enough to not want that.” Draco stood as well, leaning in and hesitantly pressed another kiss to Harry’s lips, gasping as Harry returned the kiss, his fingers rising to twine in that black hair he’d always wanted to touch, but had made fun of instead to convince himself he hadn’t.
Draco glared at him. "Get out, Potter!" If he hadn't already given him the tray, he'd have thrown it at him.
The words sent an electric jolt through Draco’s system. ‘This.’ He and Harry were really going to…do more than kiss. He couldn’t help but pull him in for another kiss before answering. “Does it matter?”
“Now, there’s one I definitely don’t mind so much,” Potter responded with a grin, then he zoomed in front of Draco, did a loop on his broom, and was off in a flash.
“You have to! I…” Draco took a deep breath. He was obviously not going to get anywhere this way. “One night. No touching?”
“I doubt that very much, Padfoot. He’s not young enough to have imprinted on him. Likely he’s just friendly, and was enjoying having Harry pay attention to him. Stop overreacting.”
Draco shifted to see him better, and to speak, but it felt like he was moving through treacle. "Wha…?"
So he found himself separated from his parents, locked in the cells at the Ministry along with far too many other witches and wizards who'd found themselves on the wrong end of the war.
Soon Draco was chafing under these restrictions. He was quite a clever young man, and he knew that something was bothering his parents. But as his father had forbidden any mention of the Prince’s fate, he was simply unaware of his impending fate.
Draco shook his head, then tossed his head to indicate he’d been inside the walls. Harry seemed to understand. “Can you fly us inside?”
He set the parchment aside and went on with his cleaning. It was completely forgotten when his benefactor appeared for supper that evening. He hadn't been expecting him, but it was a pleasant surprise, and Draco found himself trying harder than ever before. Potter or not, he wanted to know this person. He wanted them to like him as much as he was coming to like them.
Those stunning green eyes met his once more, and she smiled. “Are you telling me you didn’t know Kings Salazar and Godric were once the best of friends before they had their falling out?”
Harry nodded. "We could start with dinner tonight. You could tell me what worked. Before. And we could come up with a list of people who might be allowed to visit you. If you wanted?"
"Thank you, Harry," he said, nodding at him. "We will discuss the case. There will be a recess while we determine our judgment. The Prisoner will stay, but all others are welcome to speak or leave, if they wish." He dropped the gavel on the desktop, then stood and led the other two men from the room to talk.
One day, he was sitting at the window of his tower, which looked out over the surrounding woods, when he saw a stranger pass by. He’d never seen anyone in his life but the witch and Fenrir, as the tower was in such an out-of-the-way location. Without thinking, he called out to the stranger. "Hello!"
A quick glance around the tables showed at least half of the upper years seated there, though whether it they'd made it here first, or they'd never attended in the first place, Draco couldn't have said. Part of him wanted to glance at the Gryffindor table, but another part of him scared to know if Potter even attended the gatherings in the first place. He couldn't look. If he was there, he knew his heart would break.
Shacklebolt gave him a minor shake of the head and continued. "But you will need someone who can vouch for you, Mister Malfoy. Someone who will be held accountable for your actions should you fail in your duties or break any further laws. Do you know someone who you can stay with?"
Finally, out of desperation, Draco tried to leave the house. But upon touching the front door, the world flared around him, and he knew no more. He found himself waking in his own bed with a dark shape hovering over him. He couldn't decipher any recognizable features, but this must be who was taking care of him, surely?
"I can't hurt you here. The spells in the room prevent it. What have you got to lose? If I'm lying, what's the worst that will happen? Nothing. To you."
Draco turned to look at Potter, who looked charmingly sleep-rumpled in a way he really didn’t want to consider. “What are you doing in
It was a shockingly long afternoon. Draco had assumed that not having Potter pop up everywhere he went would be just what he wanted, but instead, he found time dragging. He kept finding himself looking about for Potter, waiting for him to appear, but no such luck.
Sleep-fogged, Draco couldn’t help but smile back, until the memory of the night before came to him, and he sat up abruptly. "No! You shouldn’t be here. Fenny smelled you! Auntie will know you’ve been here."
"Dumb move," his caretaker said. "That could have been much worse, you know. I wouldn't advise you to try it again."
Harry gave him a glower that said volumes about what he thought of that question. "Why would I, Malfoy? They treated me worse than you treated your house elves!"
Draco didn't know what to say. Why would Harry bother? He would probably be sent away to Azkaban, after all. Draco said the only thing he could think to say. "Thanks." He tucked it under his pillow before moving back to his bench.
Blaise laughed. “I suppose she is. As I am yours, highness. I would…like your blessing to court her. Unless…she is spoken for?”
"Ah, but you’re not his true family, are you? And they want him back." Harry swerved the broom toward her, then shouted, "Now, Draco!"
"We’re nearly there, Draco," Harry said quietly, interrupting his thoughts. "She wouldn’t dare attack us there, so you’re almost free."
And so we see Harry take his leave. But we cannot help but wonder how the Malfoy heir will react to being required to live with his former obsession? Will he be able, in any way, to stand the thought? Can the two live together even a day and not kill one another?
As their travels dragged on, Draco was certain he would die. Of heatstroke. Or possibly splinters and blisters. The bottoms of his feet felt like one solid blister. And when he’d taken off his shoes the night before, he’d been certain he’d seen some blood. Not to mention the state of his beautiful hands. His well-manicured nails were now ragged and broken where they hadn’t torn off completely. His hands looked no better than any common peasant’s already. It was horrific.
"No. I’ve never known anything but this tower and her and…Fenny." For some reason, saying the man’s true name scared Draco, so all he could manage was the nickname the witch had given him.
Harry likes to think of it as an improvement. But we are far less deluded, and can see quite plainly that it is the only improvement. We are not so blinded to the fact that the two have constant fights.
That Harry Potter could ever consider someone might not want him was more than Draco could handle, and the only thing he could think of to stop the bubble of hysterical laughter was to tug Harry close and kiss him.
The thought brought Draco up short. He glanced at Dumbledore, then at Sirius and Remus, who were ribbing each other good-naturedly, and then at Harry, who was smiling at the display. Dumbledore had said, hadn’t he, that what he needed was a friend? And that maybe Harry could be that friend? The more Draco thought about it, the more he realized that the wizard might have been purposefully nudging him in this direction.
Draco turned back to him. If he could tell anyone, it was Potter. After all, if he had to suffer through them, then Potter should, too. “I dream about you…chasing me. Or…being friends with me. Or…more…” An image from his last dream rose in his mind. The two of them twined on his bed. He turned fully away from him and looked out at the street again.
He wished he could ask Harry questions about it. What it was like to be without his parents that way. How he felt about becoming the ruler of a kingdom at so early an age. What it was like to be able to make his own choices in life… It all puzzled Draco. There was just so much to ask. But at least Harry kept talking.
“You said there were seven dreams, right? And you’ve told me a bunch already, so there’s what, one left?”
Draco blinked at the first man’s words. Niece? King? That had to mean that the man was a noble, at least…the other didn’t appear to be. And the young man seemed quite unassuming. Not to mention how familiar the two men were with him. Still, if Draco was to believe the first man’s words…this was his mother’s cousin. So they had to be coming to his birthday, didn’t they?
"Are you certain this is wise, Harry?" the man asked. His voice was so calm, Draco wasn't able to read much from it, only his concern for Harry.
The next attack came when they landed to get their bearings because Harry’d gotten turned around. Fenrir attacked, and they’d jumped back onto the broom, but not before both of them had gotten scored by the talons he had for finger-nails.
Twinkling eyes met grey. “I assure you, my lord, you will not,” the wizard said with a smile. He turned to the Queen. “If I may, highness?”
Prince Draco’s mother was driving him mad. She seemed insistent upon his being married within a year, and while Draco could not fault her for that (he was the heir to the kingdom, after all), there was no way he could ever see himself married to a woman. Even Pansy, the closest female friend he had, simply did not appeal to him in that way. It would be like kissing his aunt Andromeda. Or worse.
“No.” Harry paused, examining Draco’s face for a moment before speaking. “I didn’t realize anyone else knew about Salazar and Godric.”
If only he didn't this interminable wait. But then, he'd never been highly placed in Voldemort's circle. His visibility was the only reason he was here.
Draco blinked at the spot where the man had stood, certain something must be wrong with what had just happened. But how could there be? He was still here, after all. The man hadn’t hurt him, even. Still, it had been enough excitement for one day. Especially with a party still to come.
Unfortunately, Potter had always been tenacious. Even more than Draco remembered from school. He still followed Draco everywhere, though now he kept his distance, just watching. For some reason, that only seemed to make it feel even worse than before.
Draco Malfoy had had two bad years in a row, and even though the war was finally over, this year wasn't turning out be much better. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Potter.”
Draco caught his arm before he could move. “No. I’m sorry. She just…rubbed me the wrong way, that’s all. I’m glad you’re at least able to learn about your family.”
It was easier said than done, but those eyes had caught Draco, so he would simply have to wait and see. He nodded, then moved to offer his arm to Harriet. “So…What do you think of Slytherin, Princess Harriet?” he asked.
Draco looked up at him, and now that he remembered, everything felt different. He stood and moved to the bars, causing Harry to pull away. "What are you up to, Malfoy?"
Horrified at the words, Draco looked at Potter, who had already curled up under his patchy cloak, seemingly unconcerned. He’d thought the man was kidding that he’d make him tow it all the way. Apparently not. Already his arms felt like they were on fire. He wasn’t sure he’d be able to survive towing it even one more mile, let alone all the way to his new home.
“No, Sirius. Just talking to him. I think he needed a friend, really. He seems a bit upset by what his parents have planned.”
Once Harry had mounted, the two set off down the main street of the town, and out into the fields. The two of them headed automatically for one of their favorite pastures, then dismounted and let the horses graze for a bit. Draco moved to a large stone the two of them had spent many happy hours “conquering” as boys, and settled upon it.
Without another word to Potter, he made his way up to the palace, then knocked on the kitchen door. The woman who let him in was too busy to answer any questions, so he soon found himself at a table peeling vegetables. It was a dirty job, but simple, and when he was allowed to take a break for lunch, he set out into the courtyard to look around. Perhaps he would find that Weasley again, and he could point out the king when he arrived.
"The palace is a few hours ride. We should be there in just about time for supper. If we don’t have to take any detours, anyway…"
Draco nodded. “The earliest ones were more like…more real. But then…” He looked up to meet Potter’s eyes.
“Perhaps, mother,” Draco said, trying for a smile. He let his father lead his mother into the ballroom then followed after, moving to stand beside his mother on the dais as the new guests approached to be introduced.
"Of course we do," the woman said angrily, looking up at him, her porcelain-pale face streaked with tears. "You are our first-born. We love you."
This time, Draco did turn. “Are dead! What can going back to an empty home do to bring them back? I need you here!” The words had slipped from his mouth before he’d realized what he’d said, and he closed his lips in a thin line and looked down, not sure what to say now.
Granger peered out at him, but she said nothing at first, just looked at him. There was whispering behind her, and she glanced at whoever was there with her—Weasley? Potter? After a moment, she opened the door wider to glare at him. “Malfoy? What do you want?”
Draco was astonished by the interplay between the two men. Whatever was going on, he needed to put a stop to it or it might go on all night. “I’ll go. After all, we’re on the grounds of the palace, father. What can he do to me? There are guards everywhere.”
Settling next to him, Draco turned to meet his friend’s eyes, trying to ignore the rising feeling of dread at the words. “What about them?”
He watched the other boy tense at the question, but he nodded. "Yeah. I guess it's now or never, right?"
“You said you wanted to make me happy. I…” They’d both hurt each other so much over the years, but Draco had never considered what it would feel like to be the one to refuse Potter. They weren’t on an even slate. He’d done worse than Potter had on the Hogwarts Express. Apologies weren’t something he was accustomed to making, but he knew he’d have to try. “I…didn’t mean it. I was confused.”
“Nothing that special, but then, most of us don’t tend to make too much of a fuss over that sort of thing, really. Doesn’t mean as much to us as it would to you. Most don't even really believe that connection occurs.”
“Not about to,” Draco said. His own breath was coming faster, and he licked out over Harry’s lips, pressing his tongue into the other boy’s mouth, moaning as they ground together. He knew it could get better than this, but with this feeling so good, he knew he could wait for more. It was Harry’s first time. He passingly wondered if that meant at all, or just with a guy, then decided it didn’t much matter just now. Hopefully Harry’d be up for another round later. And either way, Draco would be his first. He tried not to think that Harry might not want this again. If this was just a one-off because he was horny…
Though he had never flown before, and had been expecting to be a bit scared of being so far above the ground, he found that now he was free of that place, the wind in his hair, and his arms tight around Harry, he couldn’t imagine ever feeling better. This must be freedom. He even managed to relax, the further they got from the tower with no sign of his aunt or Fenrir.
Draco huffed. “Wrong. His father did. Grandfather Abraxas was the one who implemented the Muggle restrictions. To keep them from hurting themselves by trying to use magical objects.” He turned to his mother. “I don’t think so, mother.”
Many of the students bagun to pair off. The couples weren't exclusively within their year or house, either, but across house lines. And the couples were not within the three "good" houses, either. Many of the Slytherins had found themselves girl- or boyfriends from other houses. Even Draco.
“I will not do anything to him, sir. At least, nothing that he doesn't want. I just think spending time together might be good for both of us.”
"Definitely," Potter said with a smile. He took Draco's tray, and hurried off to retrieve the others.
"No, it's not. That's not what I meant. Sometimes… contact with someone who experienced the same moment can help break the spell." He held out his hand, meeting Harry's eyes.
Then she spoke. "Minister, he is my nephew. I would be willing to let him come and stay until such time as the court believes he finishes his sentence."
Draco smiled. "I do. I even managed to get some parchment and a quill from one of the other guards, so I didn't forget the idea I came up with." He waved a stack of paper at Potter.
Draco went rigid, recognizing the voice immediately. “What. Are. You. Doing. Potter?” he asked, trying to keep his voice calm.
Draco nodded slowly. He knew Harry was right. The idea still scared him, though. What if the guards attacked him again?
His son, Draco, was not too pleased with this proclamation, feeling he was too young to marry just yet, and swore to himself and his closest friends that he would never marry if he could help it.
“Tom?” A common name. But Draco nodded all the same. He held out his hand. “It is good to meet you.”
The light rekindling in Harry’s eyes made him glad he’d managed it. Not even bothering with a verbal answer, Harry kissed him again then pushed him gently back against the arm of the couch they were on. They kissed for a bit before Harry pulled back, looking a bit hesitant. “Have you…done this before?”
“The food is no different, Malfoy,” Harry assures him. But Draco will have none of it, and when they return to the flat, he locks himself in his room for the night.
The place that Potter called his home looked as though it might have once been the home to very over-indulged pigs, but the creatures had moved out when it began to fall apart. The walls were spattered with mud where there weren’t holes most of the way through the plaster and wood. It was teetering to one side, as though a light breeze might knock it over. Worse, it looked like the place wouldn’t be large enough to hold more than one room. “That’s your house?” he asked Potter, horrified.
“Then we will deal with him, won’t we?” she smiled, and Draco was struck at how similar the smile was to the one Potter had given him. “Draco, dearest, why don’t you owl Potter and tell him his room should be ready tomorrow?” His heart dropped. Yes. This was going to be a very bad year, indeed.
Shacklebolt looked up at him, then glanced at the head of the MLE, who muttered something in Shacklebolt's ear, and the Minister shook his head. "You were assigned another task you managed to accomplish that year, I believe?"
Feeling much more certain of himself, Draco nodded, then curled up under his comforter and fell into the most restful sleep he’d had since the day he’d first set eyes on Potter.
They ate their supper in silence, and then both went to their separate mattresses. Draco pretended to fall asleep, but listened for Potter’s snores to begin, then sat up to watch him. What did Potter think to prove, doing this to him? And why did he think he could get away with it?
“Pansy? My Pansy?” Draco was stunned. The two were rarely even in the same room together. If they hadn’t both been in his immediate household, he’d have assumed the two did not even know each other.
And when the time came for me to choose, my path was only too clear. No one would help my father. So I had to help him myself. Show my true quality. I had knowledge even the Dark Lord did not, and through it, I would free my father, and we would rise to greatness once more.
He knew he did, but it was one thing to say it, and quite another to do it. "Easy for you to say, Pansy. You're not Marked. Besides, it could beanyone. What if…" He sighed.
"I'm locked in here, and bored. That's all, Potter. Okay? I'm not going to try to steal you from Weasley's sister, if that's what you're worried about."
"I don't know what you mean, sir," Draco said, his shields against being read by legilimancy firmly in place.
It was like a broken record. They’d already been at this for five minutes, and it still made Draco's head hurt as he tried to understand. “Why?” he finally asked, trying to free them both from the loop they seemed to be stuck in.
Draco shot a look at Blaise. He hadn’t told her, apparently. Checking to see the door was closed, he smirked. “Pansy, I would like to introduce you to Prince Harry of Gryffindor. Or…” he said with a widening grin, “Princess Harriet for the next day or so.”
Harry frowned. "You sent him into the ocean?" he echoed. He moved to sit across from Draco. "I wondered if it was just some excuse. Because I didn't even remember leaving the cottage they rented." He tilted his head. "You really did that?" Draco nodded. "Why?"
Still, Draco lived up to his end of his deal with Blaise. He and Pansy spent a great deal of time together—both to throw off the queen, and also so that he could fill her head with thoughts of Blaise. He was especially pleased that his attempts did seem to be well-received, and the two spent many hours walking the gardens, and later, as the stormy season began, over a chess table talking about the other young man.
Draco blinked at him for a moment, unable to understand, his eyes widening when he realized how Dudley ended up in the water. "I sent him into the ocean?"
Two other guards lead Draco to the courtroom, and Draco was grateful Harry wasn't one of them. The moment he entered the room, he knew he'd let himself assume too quickly. Harry and Granger sat in the area reserved for those who wished to watch the trials. He supposed he shouldn't have been surprised Harry could get seats, despite the great demand for them.
"Get it over with, Draco. Like ripping off a plaster. It's for the best. I mean, obviously you want this to go somewhere, don't you?"
“Well, one’s first kiss with someone is an astonishing thing, is it not? Surely it will be enough to shock him back to his true form,” the wizard said, his tone making it sound as though it were the most reasonable thing in the world.
"Please, just one thing. Research memory charms? Or better still, have Granger look for you. Find out the possible side-effects. If you don't see anything that makes you wonder, I won't bother you again. All right?"
After Shacklebolt left, Harry stared at Draco for a long time, and Draco's skin itched from restraining himself. He was about to explode when Harry finally spoke. "I went to see my aunt last night. She told me the reason I stayed in my room in Brighton was because I'd pushed Dudley into the ocean."
Let's follow as Harry leads him to a room in the large flat he’s bought for himself with the money from both his inheritances, and watch as Draco looks around, sniffing, then dumping his bag in the centre of the bed. “Well?”
"Like you care, Malfoy," Harry said, settling against the wall. Draco knew it had to be uncomfortable, but guards weren't exactly supposed to be comfortable, they were supposed to be alert.
“Actually, the trainer sent a note saying he wouldn’t be able to make it in until noon, so I’m in no rush,” Potter said with a pleased smile.
Draco watched him, amazed, as he swooped in a circle, then alit on the windowsill. "Wow…I’ve only ever seen her do magic before. Can you do other things?"
Draco stuck out his chin. “And why not? I’m hardly old enough to marry some girl! I’m barely eighteen, father.”
The two were quiet after that, but every time Draco glanced at Harry, he could see him rubbing at his head. He kept quiet, though. Even if Harry had taken advice from him, others would convince him he'd only done it to help himself in the long run. It wasn't worth it. Getting the headache to go away wouldn't make Harry's memories of their day together to come back. For that, he'd have to actually believe them, and there was no reason for him to.
Ron didn’t come in with Potter, nor did Potter ask how Draco’s day had gone. Draco might have found that suspicious before, but now he was certain he knew what it meant. Potter was nervous. Or didn’t want him to know the truth. It really was a dead giveaway.
Snape slammed his hand down on the desk. "Do. Not! Lie to me, boy. I know you are behind these parties, and I will put a stop to them, even if I must  keep you in detention for the rest of the year!"
“He’s not wild. Are you?” Harry asked Draco, and Draco shook his head, hoping to encourage them in this line of thought. “See?” Harry said to Padfoot. “He even understands us! He must have been trained by someone. Maybe he’s lost!”
Draco rolled his eyes. “On the palace grounds, of course. I’m certain any of the palace guards can point the way,” he added with a slightly sour smile. Then, before she could ask more questions, he pushed Egan forward and back onto the path and was out of sight before she could utter her wretched greeting again, or make up something for good-bye.
He was too young to get married! But then, he was hardly in a position to point that out just now. All he could do was hope that his mother’s plan failed. Even if it meant he had to stay in this form forever.
Pansy gave him a hard time for it. She, too, was involved with a new beau—from Gryffindor. She refused to admit who yet, but she'd admitted he was a Gryffindor, at least.
The image that looked out at Draco from the surface of the fountain wasn’t grizzly or scary, but it most definitely wasn’t his own face. It was a sleek silver snout with huge blue eyes rimmed with thicker silver scales that flashed with just a touch of gold in the sunlight. The mouth was filled with rather large, sharp teeth, and a pointed tongue that snaked out in discomfited annoyance. How had the man managed this?
Draco felt his cheeks heat, knowing how the next would sound to Potter. But he forced out the words. “Neither. It…I was a prince.”
We can see that Draco looks shocked and confused at this request, but after a moment, he nods, and the agreement brings the first smile in days to Harry’s face. “Right. I’ll…be right back again.” And then he is gone.
“Empire. Our lands far outstrip the miniscule lands your family rules,” Draco said, his chin going up.
“What next? You obviously have something planned, or you wouldn’t have bothered asking me to stay here.”
Draco nodded. “Right.” He turned and began gathering wood again, and soon the cart was as full as he could manage, and he took up the handles.
When Harry returned the next morning, he was more subdued. He wasn't alone, either. The provisional Minister was with him.
"Perfect," Harry replied. "Now…" He lifted the broom so that their feet no longer touched the floor, then moved gently forward towards the window. Draco’s arms tightened around Harry, and a good thing, too, for when Harry tried to fly out the window, he could feel himself sliding back.
Draco thought of the new tasks he had been given. The organizing projects here at the house meant nothing, but the potions… The person appeared to know his connection to Snape. Also his visitor had looked to be about his age. If he crossed off all the rest, that would reduce his list quite a bit. If he crossed off the Weasleys—they'd never have been able to afford a place like this—that left only one person. Harry Potter.
As the three of them walked back up the steps toward the guest quarters, he leaned close to his friend and hissed, “What on earth were you thinking?”
Draco considered it. It would mean a short party, and everyone dressed in their uniforms instead of party clothes, but really, it would be worth it, even if they were caught.
His thoughts chased him through what felt the longest day of his life, and by the time he made his way down to the ball in his silver-green formal robes, it was difficult to even hold up his head. Had he just given up everything he’d ever wanted to someone who did not want him back? What if Harry never showed? What would he do then?
She tried to close the door, but he caught it, keeping her from shutting it all the way. “No. I need to talk to him
Oh, this was a bad foot to start off on. “And yet you’re here. Something must have convinced you to do so?”
Landing several yards from the road, then approached them slowly, hoping that the three would not fright at the first sight of him. The young man seemed to be the leader, though he was far younger than the other two. One of the older men walked with a slight limp, and the other ranged far ahead, not merely to scout ahead, but also because he seemed to be made of energy, as though he hadn’t been out in the fresh air in years.
Harry had been kissing him, and when he’d pulled away, he’d been wearing a robe that Draco had never seen the like of in a deep red with gold trim. He’d whispered about how he’d waited for Draco to come to him for so long, and that he had no intent to wait any longer. He’d lowered Draco to the ground before a large oak where the two had played when they’d been boys, and then…
Draco took off again, following the road out of town, then into the fields around the castle. There were plenty of people along the road, but Draco was scared to approach most, as they were in large groups that he was pretty sure included fighters to protect them on the road.
Moving carefully back over to where the three were still talking to the wizard, Draco placed his head in Harry’s lap. Harry’s fingers immediately went to the ridge of his head and began to scratch. One thing that Draco had learned in all this, even despite his size, it was quite easy for people to forget he was truly human and intelligent while in this form, and he was learning all sorts of interesting things as they talked around him.
However, at Draco’s words, the man turned grey eyes on him, glowering down at him for a long time before he spoke. He certainly didn’t seem the kindly sort. And he was almost as old as the man who had directed him out here. “No. I’m not. He’s waiting for you.”
Draco didn’t relax until they’d managed to fly out the window, and he could look back and see the tower fading away behind them. But even as he looked back, he heard the crack of someone appearing in the tower. He didn’t have to see the figure inside to know who had appeared. Instead, he tightened his arms and urged Harry to fly faster.
“I…know I don’t deserve a second chance, but…I’m asking.” He held out his hand. “Could…we start again?”
Draco didn’t care who "he" was, or what he’d done. He just jumped to his feet from the bed he’d sunk to in his despair. He hurried to the window. "I don’t care! We have to get out! Now! He’ll be here any moment! If he sees you…"
Queen Narcissa seemed barely able to bite her tongue, but when Draco managed to hold his own, she nodded, then turned to the girl. “And you do not object to marrying one of the Slytherin Royal Family?”
Obsession is a dangerous thing. Most people know this. But sometimes, the obsession can be reworked into something more. This tale tells how such a thing can happen.
The Prince didn’t run from the room, but it was a near thing, and by the time he’d gotten halfway to his rooms, he’d broken into a bit of a jog anyway. Upon reaching his room, he opened the door quickly, then looked around, hoping to see the familiar mop of black hair and the bright green eyes he loved so well, but sagged when Harry was nowhere to be seen.
So, when Harry appears a few days later on the grounds of Malfoy Manor, which is Draco’s ancestral estate, it should surprise none of us.
Draco wasn't one to settle after one attempt at finding out something he wanted to know, and he wasn't about to start doing so now. He wrote a second letter, this one a trap intended to learn if his host was actually reading the notes. He doubted the man would let him see his face if he did come, but at least he'd know he could get to him if he wanted.
The words took Draco’s breath, then he took Harry’s hand and led him back to the couch they’d been sitting on. “All right. The next…mother wanted me to get married…”
“Potter? What are you…” Even as he began to ask, a thought came to him, but it couldn’t be true, could it? “Weasley said the king would be showing soon… You can’t…no…”
"Oooh, threats from the Hero of the Wizarding World. Here I thought you could sink no lower. Was the rumor I heard true? Did you formally break up with the Weaslette?"
threw, Potter? Honestly. Why don’t you throw your party, and I’ll go to the club, and we can both have our own good time?”
It was true. Harry’s muscular build was quite different from Draco’s slender one. He’d be lucky if he managed even to get an arm through a sleeve.
Draco felt his cheeks flush again. “To you? Potter that sounds…” It was difficult not to squirm. “What are you saying?”
Draco focused on Shacklebolt, where he sat next to the leader of the Wizengamot, who had a stern expression, and the head of Magical Law Enforcement, who smirked slightly. Obviously, he was enjoying the fact he had all these Pureblood families under his power to sentence. Draco recognized him as a half-blood, if he remembered right. But he wouldn't let the man see his fear. He was still a Malfoy, and he would face his fate with dignity.
Queen Narcissa glanced from Blaise to Harriet, then nodded. “Very well. Let her get cleaned up, then Draco and I will meet her in the audience hall.”
The other turned. “What is it, Mo—“ He caught sight of Draco, and his sword came out. “Fuck! Harry…get behind us!”
He was quick to move into the room adjoining Draco’s. Draco still wasn’t sure why his mother had insisted upon that room. After all, there was another on the other side of his room that would have done as well. And it didn’t have a door that opened into Draco’s room at all. Surely his privacy was at least as important as making Potter happy?
Now he had a new reason to know, though. He didn't want this to end after five years were up. He wanted to know for sure who he was spending his evenings with. And he wanted more.
“What? Impose forever? Make a fool of me? Do this to me?” The words were bitter, but even Draco could hear the longing in them.
Draco huffed again, ignoring her hand. “Highness will do.” Egan huffed as Draco’s hands tightened on the reins, and he forced himself to loosen his grip. “Now…what is it that you wanted?”
“No. Probably not. But he might be willing for a day or two. As long as it might take your mother to accept ‘her’ for your bride, and once you have her acceptance, there’s nothing she can do, is there?”
And so, like any boy placed under what they considered unnecessary restrictions, he found a way to escape from time to time.
“What better place, indeed,” Dumbledore said, casting a glance toward the two boys. Draco’d placed his head on Harry’s lap, and was only vaguely aware of the scrutiny. “He seems to have made one friend already,” he added with a pleased smile.
Draco pulled back, shaking his head. He couldn’t do that. The guards would never listen to Harry if he did.
Draco scowled at the sight, then hurried off through the dancing crowd to find Blaise. “Come on. We’re out of here.”
“Potter.” Draco doesn't look much better. He actually looks as though he has not even seen sun since that day. He is pale, and if we look close, we can see there are bags under his eyes, highlighted by dark smudges. “Happy day. I’ll just go find myself a seat, shall I?”
“What do you mean? Of course I am. They all want to rule at my side. Of course they want me. Doesn’t mean I want them…” He scowled. “Some are…especially persistent. Believe me, if I didn’t have to be here, I wouldn’t be.”
After that, both seemed to tacitly agree that silence would be better. After all, if they were overheard…
King Lucius raised an eyebrow at him. “Indeed? You think two hours of dancing and then leaving without a choice will get you any closer to finding a consort, Draco?”
"Did you plan something bad?" he asked, and the look on Harry's face stated plainly he wouldn't believe it if he said he did.
"Someone’s been here, Bella," he growled even before she spoke. He was sniffing the air around the window.
“Well…they are nice enough. But…I’d rather not say. Just in case. I wouldn’t want to end up with resentful subjects later, after all. Tomorrow. We’ve already planned for a ball then, anyway. I promise that by the end of tomorrow night, I will have a choice for you both.”
“Mmm. True. Being able to tell when someone is lying is a very useful skill if one is king, after all. Still boring, though. And mothers…that's almost frivolous.” After all, who wanted to make flowers bloom? Girls, he supposed, but even so, it seemed a silly power to have.
It was hard, after his dreams, hearing Potter calling him that. “Could you…lock the door, please? If they listen in, that’s one thing. But…I don’t want them barging in. I’m…not sure I can manage to explain more than once.”
And sometimes, just sometimes, mind you, he imagined a great deal more. Only under the covers, late at night, when he was sure his mystery benefactor wouldn't suddenly show up unannounced. Which he rarely ever did outside of meals.
“Who?” Pansy stood and moved to Draco’s side. “Oh. Blaise. But…who is that girl with him? I thought you said…”
“That right? So…why is it that more people are willing to deal with us than with you? Or that your Muggles are constantly crossing the border between our two nations to escape you?”
Lucius glanced between the two of them, then back to Draco. “Prove it, then. If he was your First, what is your power?”
The wedding plans still seemed to be proceeding, which also didn’t seem to improve Draco’s mood. After all, he’d told Potter he wouldn’t be staying. What did Potter know that he did not? The very thought that Potter knew something that he didn’t made him nervous, and Draco
After he finished his bowl, Potter grunted, then stretched out on his bed. “A man could get used to that kind of service, Draco. You might make a good wife yet.”
Draco watched him for a moment as he stuffed his mouth, then sighed when he realized no further praise was coming, and turned back to the pot to serve himself.
Still, lunch was a long ways away, and before even the first hour was up, Draco was certain he would collapse without
So many feelings raced through Draco, and he battled with himself for several moments before looking up to meet Potter’s eyes once more. “What?” he asked softly.
Draco glanced at his bed, then moved to it, pulling out the journal and settling on the bed before opening it once more, and noticed a gap in the pages. He opened the journal to those pages and found a letter in his mother's handwriting.
He hurried to a nearby fountain, glancing into the water, and recoiled at what he saw—he was a dragon!
It was worth it. Potter looked rather worried, now. Draco wished he could gloat, but that would come later. After he’d talked to the king. And preferably in private.
He blinked at the spot where the boy had been standing for a moment, glancing worriedly at the smaller boy, who was staring at him, round-eyed. "What… what did you
Draco thought about this. It might be true. But then he remembered he was the wronged party here. He huffed. “So…do I have a room here? Or should I go back to the shack?”
Harry smiled, obviously able to see how pleased he was. Then he sighed. “This is going to take us forever at this rate. Look, Sirius…can’t you talk to him in your other form?”
“I’m not! I’m…” He stopped, realizing the other man would never believe it if he said he was a prince. “I’m just…doing what I’m told.”
Lucius’s rage is barely restrained now, but Harry seems not to care. “He is my son, not a sack of meat, Potter! I won’t let you…use him.”
Draco doesn’t seem too pleased at the dismissal, but it should be obvious to anyone who watches that there is more to it. Particularly when he returns home to the Manor rather than to his flat, and proceeds to hide from the world.
Potter shook his head again, crossing his arms, his expression more neutral now. “No. I’m more than capable of defending myself,” he said confidently.
“Be careful there, Harry…their court isn’t like home. And…who knows what they’ll think when you arrive with their Prince who’s suddenly a dangerous beast…”
"Don't move. You hurt your arm. It required some healing, but it will be better by the morning. Just don't touch the front door again. Or the back door. Or the windows. I don't want to have to heal you again, Draco."
Draco sighed, then nodded. "Yeah, he probably would." Probably had at some point or other, if Draco were completely honest with himself. "But if you use it against him—"
Draco huffed at that, then turned back to Harry and nudged him with his head. If he was going to suffer through this torment, he at least wanted his new friend with him through the ordeal. Harry reached up to scratch at Draco’s head automatically, and Draco sighed happily. At least something about this was going well…
Finally, the girl was done, and she and Draco’s mother left him alone to brood. How was he ever going to manage this with someone else, when Harry had been the only person ever to feature in his daydreams of that sort? His night dreams, too, when it came to that. Draco squirmed, recalling the latest.
Potter laughed. “I didn’t. She approached me. I mean…after I moved in. She asked my intentions, and…apparently she liked what I told her.”
She glanced between the three men, then glowered at Draco. “The things I do for you. It will take me a bit. And we’ll need to do his hair…that…wig…” She glanced at the bedraggled mop in Harry’s hands. “It just won’t do. But we’ll figure something out,” she said to calm Draco before he could begin to panic. “And we’ll have to do his face, as well. No woman attempting to become the queen would go without cosmetics. But that’s easily dealt with.” She moved to the sofa near the fireplace, then waved Harry over, and began to hold the dress against him, sighing at just how much she was going to have to change.
Wife? Draco sputtered at the offending word, though he said nothing aloud, just glared at Potter. He also noticed that the man wasn’t about to make a move to clean anything. Apparently dishes were to be one of his regular tasks... He did little more than pick up everything and dump them in the water-bucket for now, then collapse on his own bed. The day hadn’t been as bad as the previous days had been, but even so…
Unfortunately, that was the moment when Narcissa called Draco back to meet with the latest batch of girls. It took all his energy not to snarl at them, but he managed, sneaking a glance over at Harry between the girls’ kisses.
Now she spoke, in her most airy voice. “And he will remain just so until someone—his true love—comes to break the spell.”
Snape gave him a shake. "I told you, boy. These parties of yours would end. Did you perhaps misunderstand me?"
Harry looked at him for another minute, then nodded once, wincing again. "Fine. I'll ask Hermione to research it. That doesn't mean I believe you, Malfoy."
Shacklebolt looked down at his notes once more, ignoring Robards, who grew redder as he continued to ignore him. "This says several instances of the Cruciatus curse were found when Priori Incantatum was performed on your wand. Are you aware of that?"
Prince Draco has refused every suitor who has come to court him. So his father betrothes him to the next man to ask for his hand--a poor beggar who goes by the name of Potter.
And we see that Draco understands now—perfectly—that it is he who is the someone else. He smiles softly. “Yeah.” He stands, but before he can hold out his hand, Harry beats him to it.
“Are you lost?” he asked. Draco shook his head. “You’re from around here, then?” Draco nodded. “So…where’s your family? Oh…right…um…did you get separated from them?” he asked.
Harry nodded. "Here. Take these. He says they might be able to track us, and we’ll need things to throw them off our trail. But you’ll need to throw them so I can maneuver around them if needed, okay?"
“Then I am afraid we will have to return without them. I have work to attend to, and I intend to bring my betrothed with me,” he said, turning a leer in Draco’s direction.
“How much longer are you going to keep this up, knowing that I will never agree? That I will never want you…”
He reached out, his fingers brushing Draco's hand, then curling around it. Before either of them could say more, Draco felt a shock of magic between their palms, and felt the room brighten for a moment. The rush of memory followed immediately after, and he had to close his eyes to block out the present to keep from being overwhelmed.
Draco glowered at him for a moment, then looked away. "My father loves me very much. But that doesn’t mean he’ll put up with anything I want, Potter."
Remus smiled softly and nodded. “They sent horses for us. Quite pleasant company, as well. Met Sirius’s cousin as we came in, too.”
Draco sighed, then let the matter drop. As it was, he did his best to ignore Potter as much as he could at any meals he appeared at, unless Potter asked him questions directly—which he seemed to do with alarming frequency. Some nights he had to go flying just to clear his head after. And even then, he worried he’d run into the git. It was absolutely unbearable.
“I hope, your highness, that we will manage two. After all, every child should have a sibling, don’t you agree?”
As soon as Potter had finished his own bowlful, he stood up and dropped his bowl and utensil near Draco. “So, while I’m at the market, I’ll need you to clean the dishes and sweep out the place. And don’t forget to wash our clothes from the travel, pretty boy.”
The two of them worked in silence for a few minutes, the red-head pulling out an axe from his belt to cut dead trunks into logs and even halving and quartering larger ones. Finally, they stopped for a break.
Draco almost nodded, but really, he just wanted this over. “Look…I should…go.” He realized now, though, that he didn’t want to. But he wasn’t going to be the one to make the first move. Not this time.
“So you’ll just…leave? And I’ll never see you again?” It was difficult for Draco to keep his cool. He felt as though he were about to crumble from the inside out.
The Wizarding World seemed truly lost, and each day after grew darker, with new and more horrific acts being played in front of my eyes. And all I could think was it was my fault. I caused this. I was the one to blame.
The Queen turned to look at her son, seeming rather crestfallen. “Hopefully the wizard will know what to do to help him,” she sighed.
And a third player in our little drama. There. The girl with the long red hair as red as the bloke sitting with his girlfriend and with Harry? That is Ginny, the selfsame Ron's sister. She’s dancing with all her old boyfriends, in the hopes that Harry will notice and be jealous.
The king looked from Draco to his father, looking disappointed despite the prince’s rudeness, but nodded. “Thank you. I will. Nor would I hold a child’s attitude against his father.” He bowed slightly. “And thank you for the hospitality, Sire.” And with that, he left the room.
Draco smiled. "Wouldn't miss it for the world." He wished he could see the other boy's features, but through these masks, nothing was distinguishable. But then, he might have put this off again. And it overdue. "Could we go someplace more private? Talk?" he asked, fighting back his own nervousness.
Potter tugged him close, and Draco noted a flash of annoyance that somewhere along the way, Potter had gotten taller than him. Not much, but enough that he had to look up into those bright green eyes.
Taunting was the last thing on Draco's mind. He couldn't shake the feeling the name was familiar. "You… talk about him a lot, Potter?" Maybe he'd read the name somewhere.
Two things fascinated me from a very young age: Harry Potter and the Dark Lord. From the time I could understand, father told me of them both. Of how our Lord tried to kill Harry Potter, a boy my own age, and failed. But some day, we would rise to greatness again, with the Dark Lord leading us.
“Annoyed? And how many times must I tell you, Harry… Call me Draco.” He smiled. “I thought I could use a bit of a ride. Is Egan recovered from his colic, or should I take Fallon today?”
Draco nodded, but he was beginning to panic. He couldn’t seem to move. Every doubt he had ever had about this came to him all at once. What if Harry didn’t like the way he looked under his clothes? He was far too pale and skinny, not muscular and tan like his friend. And what if he did or said the wrong thing? How would he ever face Harry again?
And Draco’s mother didn’t seem to be helping in the least. She kept inviting Potter to have supper with the family. Worse, she kept smiling at the git and chatting with him as though he were any other guest they might have. After their second meal together, he pulled her aside to ask her why. “He is a guest, Draco. One must always treat guests well. Surely I’ve taught you that?”
It took Draco a few minutes to remember, his flustered state bringing very different memories to mind. "I…think it was the one where we…no, wait, that was later…Oh…I remember. I was living in this tower…"
By the time Harry's replacement came, Draco was certain he'd never get another chance. "Harry, wait…"
Draco tried not to let his reaction to that show. “And why would she do that?” He knew his tone was a touch too sharp, but he couldn’t prevent it.
Finally, at the end of the month, Harry has admitted to himself that he cannot have what he truly wants. It is heartbreaking to see his realization. But we can see that Draco will never bend, and that Harry will never break him to get what he wants. So instead, he goes to knock on the other man’s door.
“But…but…” Draco watched as Potter pulled the wagon to the door and began to unpack the mattresses and comforters, then pulled the wagon to the side yard. Sighing, Draco trudged into the house, barely able to pick up his feet any longer, then collapsed on the nearby bed, and was asleep in a flash.
Draco blinked at him, then nodded, dropping forward a bit so that Harry could climb on and settle between his shoulder blades.
Draco tried not to meet those green eyes he’d always thought Potter didn’t deserve, even at the very beginning. “I want to speak to you.”
Draco’s eyes widened. How had he not managed to think of that? As soon as she gave her blessing, everything would be out of her hands. He would become king upon marriage, and while she might be disgruntled about it, she would hardly have the power to do anything about it. “Blaise! You’re brilliant! But…even so…where do we find someone who would be willing, even for a few days, to pretend to be a woman?”
The first man laughed. “Yeah, well, with that mother of mine so pleased that her sweet niece had nabbed the King…you’d have left too, Remus. Besides, I was much happier spending time with your father, Harry. He was a good king.”
Draco saw his mother react to the first name, though she said nothing about it. “We shall send riders to retrieve them. You shouldn’t be without such loyal guards. And we’ll have the best guest room made up for you, as well.”
After the war, everything happened so fast. All Draco could remember was that one moment, he was hugging his parents and being held by them, and the next, all three of them were being bound by those around them in the hall. He hadn't expected anything better, really, given their part in the battle, but it didn't make it any easier.
Draco'd debated that question with himself after realizing Potter might ask something along those lines, he'd already decided on an answer. "I'll leave it up to you. If you decide this or one of my other stories is worth more… I'll take them. If not, so long as I get my question, I'll keep telling them."
Draco was certain the guards would drag him back off to his cell before they returned, but the Minister and the other two men returned right before that would have happened. After arranging his papers, he called the court to order, then faced Draco. "Draco Malfoy, after due consideration of your case, we believe your actions were all performed under duress, and at an age where you could not fully be accountable for your own actions. As such, your sentence will be commuted to community service for the next five years, or until such time as repairs to the damaged buildings and businesses have been completed to this court's satisfaction."
“No need to shout,” Potter said, blinking at him owlishly and sitting up. “Time for me to get up, anyway. Auror training starts in an hour...” He slid out of bed, and Draco watched, wide-mouthed, as Potter padded, entirely naked, out of his room.
"I did, sir." Draco closed his eyes. He didn't know what Harry had up his sleeve, but he didn't believe it would work, regardless of what Harry might believe. "This court knows Mister Malfoy and I were never friends in school, but I learned a few things about him in the past few years. Though he stood on the wrong side of this conflict, I never saw him do anything not directly related to protecting himself or his family. I don't believe he should be held accountable for his actions, nor should he be punished for trying to save his parents."
He was about to ask why he was confused when Harry's confusion turned to anger. "How could he do that?"
“No.” Potter caught his wrist. “I didn’t seek you out in the night, Draco. You sought me. Doesn’t that mean anything to you?”
He simply couldn’t resist, and made his way to the centre of the gardens, getting drunk on the smell of the flowers, and wishing he could go down to the stables and take out his favourite horse. But the last time he’d managed to escape with his horse, the stablemaster himself had been whipped, so the likely chance of him managing that was slim to nil, he knew. Especially with everyone arriving for the party that evening. Too many people around to manage to slip past. Still, at least he was able to escape for a short time.
"I hurt so many people, Pansy. No one wants that for a lover. In a lover." He scowled. Especially if they were who he hoped.
“Axe?” Draco asked. He’d never used that sort of implement before, and the idea made his hands twitch with pain. “I…don’t have one.”
It was sobering. For a moment, seeing Potter almost helped Draco forget why he was there. "Right." He settled back in his bunk, looking at him for a moment. "How are they going?" he asked.
One day, to distract himself, Draco was cleaning out his papers from his desk, and came across the lists he'd made in an attempt to guess his host's name. There at the bottom, was "Harry Potter," circled in overwritten dark ink. It was amazing how certain he remembered feeling. Surely Harry wouldn't have gone to this much trouble to keep his identity secret, would he?
"I don't care why, Draco. You broke your promise. Here I was, stupidly beginning to believe I could trust you." He crumpled up the parchment, tossed it in the fireplace and set it ablaze. With a turn, he was gone. Draco was left alone once more.
Harry shook his head. But he didn’t look angry. Draco wished he did. That hurt, hopeful look went straight through him. “No.” This time, he didn’t fight his hand as it rose to stroke Draco’s cheek.
McGonagall held up a hand. "Severus, don't you truly believe those students caused their own problems? I do not recall Mister Malfoy or Mister Potter have have such difficulties?"
But there was another I hoped to meet. Harry Potter. Unlike my friends, I held a fascination for him rivaling my need to be a Death Eater. I was convinced, if I could have but a chance, I could bring him to our way of seeing the world. He would join us and the Dark Lord, and together we would all make the world a better place.
Shacklebolt opened the door, whispered a binding spell, and Draco winced as he found his hands tugged behind his back and bound there. "I wasn't trying to do anything," he grumbled.
Draco watched after him, confused and upset. All he could do was hope that Potter meant what he’d said, and that he wouldn’t have to deal with this any more after tonight. He sighed, paid for his drinks, then apparated home.
It took a while for Draco to understand the words, but he realized his benefactor was there. This wasn't a dream.
Draco scowled. It wasn’t his fault Potter had refused to use some of the food the kitchens had packed, but he’d insisted that they keep the food for their first night in Draco’s new home. Instead, Draco had only had a scrap of bread and some water for his supper the night before, glowering at Potter the entire time.
He packed himself a light lunch, then went outside and got out the cart, which he’d been hoping to never see again. Sighing, he pulled it down the road leading from the palace and into the woods. He wasn’t sure how to get larger pieces, but the smaller sticks and branches seemed easy enough, and by the time his stomach had begun to growl, he had a good stack in his cart. All he could do was hope what he was finding was enough.
“I’m afraid so. Even if I were the sort, the girls mother continues to find…” Draco sighed. “I don’t know what to do, Blaise. I can’t tell her why. She’d go apoplectic. And I can’t…function with a girl.” Just the thought had him feeling a bit ill.
Draco assumed the woman still hugging him and sniffling was Narcissa. That meant that Bella truly had been his aunt. At least that explained how she had managed to abduct him… "So…you…want me back?"
“She wasn’t too bad, was she?” he asked softly. He desperately wanted to reach out and touch, but he held himself back for now. After all, Harry hadn’t seemed too interested before.
"You shouldn't call me that." Despite himself, Draco's anger faded and grew into confusion with a touch of hope. "We're not friends."
Even without a vocal response or change in expression, Draco knew that his father was scanning his words for a lie, and couldn’t help but feel relieved that not a single word had been untrue. Just a stretching of the truth. He didn’t honestly know how Harry could manage to get Lucius’s approval, but he was certainly willing to let him try.
“Oh, nothing. Just…it’s not fair that they’re doing this to you. You should be able to take your time. Find someone you want to be with.”
“Moony” shook his head at this. “I don’t think so, Harry. Likely he’s just generally more intelligent than the usual beasty. But either way, we can’t take him with us. We’re late as it is. We’ll be lucky if we make it in time for the feast. Come on. We need to get moving again.”
Unfortunately, just as Draco was getting comfortable, his mother returned—followed by a small group of girls. Draco couldn’t help but laugh—or at least, as good as he could in this form—at the look on their faces. They looked as though they thought he was going to eat them, rather than that
"All of the times you used that particular spell?" Robards asked, his tone implying he believed otherwise.
Potter turned to look at him from where he was walking ahead of him. “Well, of course, Draco.” He took the water skin off his belt and held it out to Draco, who blinked at it. He wasn’t even sure he’d be able to close his fingers around it. What he was sure of was that the water would not fill his stomach.
“Actually,” Draco said with a smile, “there are a few that seem good possibilities. But…I need to think things through. I do hope that is allowed? We aren’t in such a rush that I can’t even give the matter thought?”
For a few minutes, Draco did nothing more than swoop and circle in the air, but then a shout caught his attention, and he remembered his problem. Changing back. He looked down at the palace, so small below, then dove down to see what was going on.
Draco grinned. “Still, you never know. I am Crown Prince. I do still have to outdo you…” His grin faded quickly, though. “I just wish…”
Potter nodded. “He was gracious enough to allow a poor craftsman to tag along with his group. But we will be traveling back alone. I hear that he and his entourage have decided to stay on for a few days?”
"I don't know. I guess I thought, since the stories seemed to be helping, having something more to write in might help, too. Someplace to put your more personal thoughts. I know it won't change the outcome of your trial, but at least it will give you some kind of outlet."
“Don’t tell them. If they ask for a decision tonight, say you might have a possibility, but that you need to think about it, and that you need that extra ball tomorrow to be certain. Okay?”
Draco turned to glare at him, shrugging off his hand. “Obviously something you enjoyed too much to bother with anything else, which tells me everything I need to know about
Draco couldn’t honestly answer the question. He wasn’t really sure why. Just that right now, he wasn’t ready to meet the world without Harry. Maybe someday, but not yet. Not now. "Because you saved me. Because I want to. Please?"
Draco nodded. "Well… I'm starting to. I wrote down ideas for more, but I wanted to make sure I got what I already told you written down, too. Something to think about when I'm bored, or can't sleep. Helps."
Draco nodded. Part of him was glad that Harry would promise to visit again, but another part of him wanted Harry to not leave at all. Still, better that than have the witch catch him here. "Soon," he said to hide his turmoil. "I look forward to it."
Harry scowled at him. "Whatever kind of trick this is, it won't work." He turned away and moved once more to the spot on the far wall where he could see down the hall, but also into Draco's cell.
“Look at that one, Harry,” Ginny is saying, pointing at a long, white gown in a shop window. “Wouldn’t I be spectacular in that?”
Though at first it seems Harry might actually be able to get through to Draco, over the course of the next few days, we see just how stubborn Draco can be. Harry keeps trying, true to his Gryffindor determination. He shows him his library, which Draco sniffs at for being too Muggle; shows him his electronics, which Draco avoids, acting as though they are about to pounce upon him and bite him; then finally, Harry offers to throw a party in Draco’s honour.
"Oh? You're going to 'make it all better,' like it never happened? Well, life doesn't work that way, Potter. I'm afraid you'll have to do better."
Potter appeared early the next morning, far too early, suitcase in hand, a trunk and several boxes floating behind him. He looked as though he’d been given an invitation to stay with the Queen at Buckingham Palace or something. It was enough to nauseate Draco, that pleased expression. As though they hadn’t been forced into letting him stay with them.
The rush of memory left Draco dizzy, but when it passed, he remembered every moment of that afternoon. How well they'd gotten on. How different it had been from their years in Hogwarts together.
Draco wasn't sure he'd heard right, but he did his best not to betray his confusion. Particularly when the Headmistress turned her gaze on him once more. "Is that right, Mister Malfoy?"
Draco looked up at him, suddenly not sure what to ask. He stayed quiet for a bit before finally letting the words escape. "My father—" He could see the frown growing on Harry's face, but hurried to ask anyway, hoping Harry would answer. "Have they sentenced him yet? You don't need to tell me what, or even when. Just…have they?"
The woman took a step forward, but the man—Draco knew he must be her husband—held her arm. "Draco?" she asked. Her voice was wavering, and he could hear the tears in her voice. He knew they had to be his parents, but he was scared to step away from Harry, so he nodded instead.
Draco smirked. That only proved they didn't deserve Harry, he decided. If they couldn't give Harry this, Draco would. He'd show him he did have magic. Because Draco was certain he did. He wasn't sure why. He somehow knew he was right. "Isn't it nice? It's not as nice as the last beach house we had in the Canary Islands, but I like it. The one in the Canaries didn't have that." He pointed to the treehouse, grinning as Harry stared up at it.
Harry looked up with a smile. “Your father’s Luatha decided he had nothing better to do, I’m afraid, highness. You’re looking…”
Potter—Harry—was a very good kisser. Draco was beginning to think being married to him might not be so bad after all.
“You…we…wow…” His hand came up to stroke Draco’s cheek again, and he scooted closer. “You chose me over your father?”
"No, you didn't. Which convinces me more than anything else you deserve it, Malfoy. You don't deserve to be sent to Azkaban. Not for what you've done."
Before the relieved parents could react, however, one of the others stepped forward—Trelawney. She was a rather bumbling witch, but her prophesies had a tendency to come true, despite her predilection for drink.
And they all (yes, even Ginny, who proceeds to date another Gryffindor schoolmate, Neville Longbottom, and they marry and have six children.) live happily ever after.
Draco chuckled. "Please. When are you not about saving people? How many times did you help me this past year? And you had no reason to. I deserved the fate I'd made myself."
Smiling, Harry nodded. “Yes. All right. I’ll be out here when you’re ready for a bit of escape.” He sobered. “Good luck, Draco.”
