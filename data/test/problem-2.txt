“America.” he yelled. Harry smiled.
“Are you asking me to be friends, Potter?” Draco asked incredulously.
He rematerialized at Platform 9 ¾, which was full of blueish steam from the train. Students and parents were everywhere, and he sidled on the brick wall trying to be inconspicuous, waiting for Andromeda, and looking for Ron and Hermione in the crowd.
Dean and Neville left, and Draco sat on his bed before pulling up his left sleeve, and Harry almost gasped.
“So how’s rooming with Draco? He behaving? Not too grumpy?” Daphne said mischievously, and Harry chuckled.
“It was lovely to have you, dearie.” Harry waved, then he and Hermione began threading their way through the throng towards the Hogwarts Express. A knot of anxiety began twisting in his stomach as people start to notice him.
“Now I know you’re knackered, if you’re resorting to boring insults like that.” she commented, and Daphne snorted.
“Well mate, is one tattoo of your name enough?” Ron teased.
Daphne left and he resumed his silent vigil, his silent prayers, his eyes on Harry. He looked almost as if he was sleeping peacefully. If only.
An hour later he was about halfway done, but he shoved it in his bag for later and went down to dinner with Hermione and Draco, Harry and Hermione on either side of him. Thankfully Draco hadn’t caught on yet that they were- for lack of a better word- protecting him.
“Not that I know of,” replied Draco, and Blaise nodded agreement.
“I didn’t know you had a tattoo!” exclaimed Daphne. “Let me see!” Draco coughed.
“...many different types and uses for this Elixir. Since the effects of the Everlasting Elixirs are permanent, you must…”
“Sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs?” he repeated, his eyes wide. “What- that’s-”
“You’re no fun.”
“Ooh, me too.” exclaimed Daphne. “I wonder how these new professors will measure up.” A few minutes later the two of them left the Great Hall and head up the stairs to Transfiguration.
“This is nothing. My mother can be on her feet for twelve hours when she shops. She always dragged me with her, too. And Pansy’s the same way.” commented Draco. “Here, hold on.” Harry obliged him and stopped, and they set their bags down on a bench. Draco took out his wand and flourished it at one of Harry’s bag, then peered inside.
“What did you smell?” asked Harry, and Draco had to almost drag his eyes away from Harry’s green ones.
But everything from those lessons was out the window now. Rule after rule that Draco had always lived by, well, it’s safe to say he’d sped through them. And now he didn’t know at all where to begin.
“Yeah, every week if you want, ‘Mione. But let's save the good-byes until we know I actually have a spot on this trip, yeah?” Hermione laughed.
“I’m going to teach you how to braid Draco’s hair,” she announced and Draco twisted around again to glare at her.
“I don’t give a damn what other people think, Draco!” Harry said, not taking his eyes off of Draco’s wide grey ones. “If you like me, and I like you, then that’s all that matters. Forget everyone else.”
“Follow me.” said Draco, and in a moment of inspiration, led Harry to his forest clearing. He wasn’t hoping for anything, he knew better than that. It had just been a long day of truth after truth, and this was the place where Draco was most comfortable when outside the castle. A look of apprehension dawned on Harry’s face as they entered the trees, but he didn’t say anything.
“Aren’t you sorry for what you’ve done in the past?”
When Draco’s eyes fluttered open again, it was to bright sunlight streaming in through the window, accompanied by a cold breeze. He hunkered down in his blanked at the chill.
“Is he alright?” asked Harry with concern, glancing again over at him. Hermione smiled a little.
Trouble is, there was already someone there.
“It’s a job that Muggles can have. You basically go to someone and talk about your problems and feelings and they give you advice and stuff.” explained Harry, watching with amusement as Draco raised his eyebrows at this.
“You really needed me to come across the school with you to drop off your book,” said Harry, shaking his head. Draco glanced at him, and when he spoke there was a note of amusement in his voice.
“Well,” said Draco slowly, adjusting the collar of his sweater. He always does that when he was nervous, thought Harry amusedly. “Daphne got me to, er, apologize to Harry and his friends. And we started hanging out.”
“Sue, Padma, can you come help me find something?” asked Daphne, and the two girls quickly got up and follow her away, not looking at all sorry to depart the scene. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are left awkwardly staring at Malfoy, who’s still watching Daphne walk away with a sulky expression. Then he sighed, and looked up at the ceiling as if casting a quick prayer before meeting Harry’s gaze.
“Harry, we shouldn’t-”
“We should go have a snowball fight.” declared Simon. “The snow’s sticking, I can see it on the cobblestones.”
Potter snorted. “I’m not examining you. I’m just trying to watch what you’re doing so I can retain something from class.” Draco couldn’t find fault with this so he added 7 porcupine quills and some powdered dragon claw and stirred vigorously, taking out his pent-up frustration on the potion instead of the black-haired boy sitting next to him. A beat of silence stretched out, and Potter fidgeted.
The Snitch suddenly dropped and resumed flight a foot from the grassy ground. Harry and Malfoy follow it without hesitation, both speeding downwards and pulling out of the dive with seconds to spare. Harry grinned. He’s never played a Seeker’s game like this, with someone who’s just as skilled as him. It’s bloody brilliant. Harry stretched out his arm, the tips of his fingers mere inches from the Snitch, just like Malfoy’s.
“Will you look at that, my lips are getting cold too,” Draco said casually, and Harry chuckled, leaning forward to kiss him.
He lay awake for awhile, listening to Draco’s soft breathing deepen, for once falling asleep before Harry did. Harry glanced over at him. Draco still had glitter around his eyes, but his face was relaxed in sleep, lips slightly parted.
“Headmistress McGonagall, Ron-”
“Yes. He volunteered.” replied Hermione.
“If I fall in, my mother will be furious with you,” he muttered sullenly, to Harry’s laughter, before plunking down next to him and putting on the skates. The ground was very cold, probably frozen, thought Draco as he pulled on the strings of the skates. He really wasn’t sure about this, but Harry didn’t seem too worried. Although perhaps that wasn’t the best indicator. Draco gave another heavy sigh before standing up cautiously, wobbling dangerously.
“Yes.”
“So, good early Christmas present?” asked Harry, swinging their joined hands. Draco looked at him, a spark of amusement glimmering in his eyes. He stilled the motion of their clasped hands with a long-suffering sigh, and Harry snickered.
He was getting better at not staring though. Just now, for example. Draco had been biting his lip, and it had been the most adorable thing. But Harry had forced himself to look away, even if his traitorous hand had caught Draco’s sleeve, trying to make him stay just a little longer.
“Yes, brilliant job. You got some stuff from the cupboard. Do you want a medal, or will you go get the rest of them since we both know I’m the one that will be brewing this potion?” he retorted, having given up on being civil. Potter rolled his eyes but grabbed his book and went back to get everything else.
“Merlin Harry, your penmanship is horrific,” complained Draco, squinting at the messy scrawls. Harry chuckles.
“Come on, Draco.” declared Harry, and, grabbing him by the arm, steered him out of the ballroom. Draco sputtered.
“Oh please. You are not a Death Eater. You wouldn’t kill anyone. And anyway,” she continued, a more serious expression settling on her face, “You aren’t the only Slytherin that’s going to be hated on. Pansy’s the one who told everyone to arrest Potter last year, and Blaise and I are Slytherins from families associated with Him.”
Harry dropped the thin chain over his head and it disappeared under his shirt. Draco smiled at him. It was ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. It was like he couldn’t stop grinning at Harry, couldn’t stop watching him.
“Well before she cast the spell, she asked me to think of what it wanted to look like.” Draco started, and Harry nodded. Luna had done that with his tattoo as well. “And I honestly didn’t have a decided thing, so I was in a bit of a panic, but then I thought of seeing that phoenix- Fawkes- and I thought it would fit. When I saw him, he… he brought back my positive memories, and that’s what I’m reminded of when I see the tattoo.” finished Draco quietly.
His eyes fell on the other people at the eighth year table, all chatting away merrily. It was so surreal, being back here, eating in the Great Hall, when the last time he had seen some of these people was in the Battle of Hogwarts facing off against Death Eaters.
“Thank you, Headmistress.” he replied politely, and she moved along the table to pass out everyone else’s schedules.
“Merry Christmas,” said Camille, grinning. “Thanks for the sweater, Draco.” He smirked.
Harry nodded and stood his trunk on its side. He paused for a second as his eye caught on a photo that Andromeda kept by the sofa, a shot of Tonks and Remus at their wedding. As they smile cheerfully in the photo, Harry looked away. It's painful to see them, alive and whole, in the photo, and to realize that they, like Fred, were gone. And he, Harry, was left.
“There you are!” exclaimed Camille, when they joined their friends at the breakfast table.
“Hey,” he said casually.
answered.
Suddenly there was a tapping noise on the window outside, and Draco looked up to see a handsome tawny owl, feathers slightly ruffled from the wind, a letter clutched in its beak. He frowned a little. Who’d be sending him a letter now? Maybe Pansy, but why?
Malfoy’s eyes slide to his and there’s a faint smirk on his face.
When he walked through the doors of the Great Hall, the crowds overwhelm him for a moment and Draco wanted nothing more than to escape to some forgotten corner of the castle. But before he could lose his nerve Daphne barreled down the aisle and jumped on him.
“See you at dinner.”
“So, Amortentia?” asked Harry, peering at the silvery liquid.
“Then I have ten minutes,” muttered Draco, closing his eyes again. He heard Harry sigh and move away, probably getting ready. But then he felt a rush of cold air, and Harry was standing at the end of his bed, with his blanket. “Hey! Give that back,” ordered Draco. “What if I’d been naked?”
“So,” Hermione pressed on. “We finally discovered-”
“I always make you worried. Sorry.” She smiled tenderly at him.
“While I wouldn’t put it the way Ronald did,” said Hermione dryly, “I feel the same way. Yes, he apologized, and yes, it seemed like he actually meant it, but he’s still Malfoy. Unless he does something more I’ll treat him the same as ever. Now-” she clapped her hands- “You two need to do your work still. Let’s start.”
“The new Potions professor is the dark-haired one, next to Trelawney. She’s from Australia.”
“That’s one too many, if you ask me.” And as the sky darkened and the train sped steadily towards Hogwarts, Harry felt truly happy for the first time in a while.
And when he’d left the library, he’d been so furious with himself for divulging so much. Daphne had run up to him and Draco had snapped at her, although he hadn’t hexed her like he’d promised. When she’d asked what was wrong, he’d burst out that he’d acted like a dewy-eyed girl and talked about feelings and she’d laughed at him. Then his anger had blown it’s top and he’d stormed off, calling her a fucking liar over his shoulder.
“And you didn’t tell me?” she hissed, smacking him, and Blaise snorted. Draco raised his arms to fend her off.
The second thing he noticed was Harry’s reflection in the mirror, and it took his breath away.
“Well, don’t.” ordered Draco. “If I can forgive you- and you know how little I do that- you can forgive yourself. You didn’t mean to.” Harry recognized the truth in his words with a small pang of amusement sweeping away the sadness. (Draco held so many grudges) Harry lay down next to him. Draco traced Harry’s tattoo with one fingertip, drawing comforting lines on his skin. Then he sat up, and Harry watched him, eyes sweeping over Draco’s pale skin. “Come on,” said Draco, a bit pink in the face. “Dinner.” He held out a hand, and Harry accepted it, the strong grip pulling him up and back to reality.
“What the hell is this?” said Harry furiously, glancing back up at Draco. Merlin, here we go. Draco bit his lip.
“Andromeda sent me a letter.” Harry explained, passing it over to Draco, who was sitting cross legged on his bed, reading the book that Hermione had gotten him for Christmas.
“Who’s taking Defense?” asked Dean, and Micheal answered him.
“Hey, Hermione.” he replied, noticing for the first time the boy lying on the bed next to him. Draco. He looked as if he were sleeping, but there were dark circles under his eyes.
Harry takes a deep breath, slides his hand into Draco’s. The other boy’s hand tightens momentarily around his.
“Want to go flying?” offered Harry, and Draco turned to him.
Andromeda had welcomed him, not just because he was Harry Potter, but because he was godfather to Teddy and therefore she considered him family. The very first time he had seen her, when he had crash-landed in her garden with Hagrid, he had thought her to be Bellatrix and only a few seconds later he had seen that it was not her. Now he knew that Andromeda Tonks and her sister were very much different, and she had become something like an aunt to him in the three months he had stayed with her and the baby Teddy.
“Yours too.”
Being angry about Theo, obviously, was the main thing. Feeling like he had to protect Draco, but also to (not that it was rational, at all) sort of assert his claim on Draco, which was something ridiculously Gryffindor-ish but kind of sweet if you thought about it. And Harry was also probably having niggling doubts about Draco’s commitment to the relationship, since it was relatively new.
“Don’t call me adorable, you loon.” he retorted. “Just- it’s interesting, what Muggles can do without magic.”
“Ah.” Draco replied, smirking a little.
He spent a rather enjoyable breakfast with Pansy, Daphne, and Blaise, although he had to fend off many more questions about the previous day. Then he’d met up with Hermione in the library and studied, before grabbing a quick lunch and meeting up with Hermione, Weasley, and Potter in the common room, where they spent the afternoon playing chess and bickering back and forth, and Hermione had introduced Draco to her extraordinarily fluffy and smush-faced cat, Crookshanks. Potter and Weasley had recounted the long
Coming back for eighth year at Hogwarts had not been an easy decision for him. At first he’d wanted to refuse, thinking of the wide eyes following him, the whispers. Not to mention the memories that lurked around every shadowy corner of the repaired castle. He did love Hogwarts, but now that feeling was tinged with something else. Fear. Anger. Grief.
Those words had stayed at the forefront of Draco’s mind and given him the strength to fight through his panic and finally show his scar to someone, to talk about one of his darkest days. And Harry hadn’t been disgusted, or cruel, or anything that Draco had feared. When Draco had searched his green eyes, he’d seen only compassion, empathy.
Before they went down to dinner, Draco persuaded Harry to come back to their dorm with him, saying he wanted to drop off his book.
“...and you must write to us,” Camille was saying to Daphne and Draco.
“I will.” A few minutes later he grabbed a biscuit for the road and left, feeling comforted by all of the familiar things. Suddenly he remembered Malfoy’s advice, and Harry made a quick detour to the hospital wing to ask Madam Pomfrey for Dreamless Sleep. She smiled kindly and gave him some, and he walked back to his dorm to deposit the potion there before dinner.
“Is that sarcasm, Potter? Well well. There’s hope for you after all.”
“You’re so adorable when you get excited.” she said, and Draco scowled.
“You know I like you. Only you. I don’t feel anything at all for Theo.” he said firmly, and Harry let out a little sigh.
He was apprehensive about smelling the Amortentia, for he had a strong suspicion of what he would smell and didn’t want to have to invent something if Harry asked him. But the other boy was already leaning over their cauldron, inhaling deeply before leaning back with a slightly bemused expression.
The first impression he got was white-blond hair, glowing softly in the moonlight streaming in from a window. He was sitting with his back to Harry, seemingly looking at the wall, his hands braced on either side of the desk. Then Harry’s foot scuffs against the stone, and Draco Malfoy turned around.
“Could we have some food please?” asked Harry, and the house-elves nodded eagerly.
“Should we put this in a letter back to Hermione and Ron, or wait?” said Harry, laughing a little as Ron’s shocked expression seemed to swim in front of him, and Hermione’s as well. Although she would probably be a little less surprised.
All of these things were going through his head, and he hadn’t realized them until now, but they were all true. When Harry had seen Draco earlier today, in the mirror… he’d stared. He hadn’t been able to help it. Draco had looked beautiful, ethereal. And he’d stared back.
“Oh, here we are.” commented Draco, and the carriage slowed to a stop in front of Beauxbatons. They stepped out and began the walk to their dormitories, but Harry noticed Draco was still glancing at him every now and then, so he hastened to distract him.
“Ginny got Quidditch Captain, right?” asked Hermione, and Ron nodded. Harry tilted his head thoughtfully. Ginny would definitely make a good Quidditch captain.
“I know you have questions, dear, but Ms. Granger will explain everything after I attend to you. Now, drink this. Go on, that’s it.” Harry, slightly befuddled, accepted the frothing goblet of potion and dutifully drank it, wincing a bit at the taste. Like smoke, and it tingled as it went down his throat.
“Yeah, it is. It’s nice to have our own bathroom.” Harry replied, and Draco’s eyes widened.
Harry chuckled at the memory. Draco’s Pepper-Up was making him feel loads better, thankfully. He’d be fine in a few minutes.
“Wow. My Patronus is a fox. Apparently we’ll be working on them later in Defense, I’m glad I already know how to do mine. Are you going to this club?”
“Alright,” he said, and followed Harry out of the hallway and into the quiet, starlit night.
“Probably.”
Draco and the Aurors appeared with a crack just outside of Kings Cross Station, in a small copse of trees where the Muggles wouldn’t see. He irritably jerked free of the two wizards, and ignoring them, began walking toward the station, letting no hint of his dislike seep through his façade. That was a feat in itself, he thought, for he disliked everything right now. His two silent guards, who trailed after him, the fact that in a minute or so he would be surrounded by people who hated him, that he was going back to Hogwarts.
She nodded warily, and Harry stepped back and let Daphne carefully levitate Malfoy and followed her out of the common room. As they stepped out of the portrait hole, Hermione rushed around the corner with the Headmistress behind her, and they stopped short at the sight of Malfoy.
“And?” Harry inquired.
“Close your other eye, I have to start that one. And yes. Answer the question.” she ordered in a soft voice. Draco closed his eyes again and felt her start on the other eye.
“Well, I’m dating-”
“Interesting,” said Harry.
“Ron wants to know what you think about Malfoy,” she replied, sitting back into her seat.
Harry was kissing him back just as wildly, and suddenly Harry grasped Draco’s shoulders, his fingers curling, and in one smooth motion flipped them over so that Harry was on top of Draco. Draco panted, and Harry broke away and pressed kisses down his jaw, his neck, his hands slipping under Draco’s shirt. Draco yelped, and Harry’s eyes met his again, his gaze intense and rakish and wonderful.
“Draco,” said Harry softly. “It’ll be alright. Stop overthinking it.” He squeezed Draco’s hand reassuringly, and Draco nodded silently. He was still a touch apprehensive about what lay ahead of them, whatever Harry said.
“Fine.” he said shortly, crossing his arms, and Harry snorted. “But how are you going to- hey!” he exclaimed, for Harry had scooped him up, bridal-style, and was beginning the walk back to the school. “Potter!”
Draco chewed on his lip absentmindedly. That had been one of the worst years of his life. He’d been so desperately trying to follow His orders, but also constantly at war with himself. Draco had known it was wrong, but had been so scared of incurring His wrath, of getting killed, of getting his parents killed. Some small part of him had been eager to be singled out and chosen, but after a while he’d lost that mindset as he’d continually gotten more and more stressed and scared.
“A bit off, as my desk mate’s a little slow, but overall yeah. Yours?”
All in all it had been a good Christmas morning, thought Harry. He’d been apprehensive about spending his holidays away from Hogwarts or the Weasley’s, since he always spent Christmas at one or the other, but he was pleasantly surprised and glad that he was enjoying today quite as much as he had enjoyed Christmas’s of the past.
“Alright,” she said, and Harry turned to Malfoy.
“I almost was.” came Harry’s voice. “But I didn’t want to, because you’d just been sorted into Slytherin.”
“What’s that?” he asked, and Draco sighed.
When their first class was over, Harry followed Amelie to their Transfiguration class. He spotted Ernie and Micheal sitting with their own guides, but not Draco or Daphne. Harry sat back with a small pang of disappointment; he hoped he’d have at least some classes with them. But there were still classes he hadn’t been to.
“Tomorrow, then?” he offered, and Harry nodded. “Oh, did you deliver Hermione’s letter?” continued Draco as he pulled his blanket up to cover him.
“The first word means gold, I think. The second could be anything from flower to a random word someone made up.” Harry snorted as they entered the common room. Hermione and Ron looked up from their seats in the common room.
“How did the four of them make it?” questioned Draco, fascinated with the map. He glanced at Potter and saw a small, wistful smile on his face as he watched the map.
“That’s really thoughtful of you. Thanks, Draco.” he exclaimed, kissing Draco quickly.
“No, it’s alright. I wouldn’t want you to be cold on my sake.”
The class went on in this manner, until the Beauxbatons professor cracked open the door and told them it was time to go. Harry and Amelie had just wrapped up the lesson, so that fit perfectly with their timing.
“It’s odd he didn’t say anything. Usually he’d take the first opportunity to jibe at us.” Hermione pointed out. Ron stretched out and rolled his eyes as the carriage moved forward.
“Thanks,” Harry said, letting out a breath. “It- the fire- it reminded me of...” he trailed off, slightly embarrassed.
definitely not go anywhere unless he knew whether Harry liked boys as well, though he doubted it.
He wants to say so much more but refrains. A wry smile tugs at Draco’s lips.
“Oh, what a horror.”
“Write, you prat. I’ll miss you.” she said, and Harry smiled at her.
“Draco, are you done yet?” came Harry’s voice, and Draco allowed himself a small smile.
“So. I’d like to.. apologize.” muttered Malfoy, and Harry can almost see him forcing the words out. Was this why Daphne had brought him here? So she could make Malfoy apologize to them? But why, what did she get out of it? wondered Harry.
Harry strolls through the third-floor hallway, his eyes catching on the shadowy figures of armor lining the walls. He remembers seeing them fight alongside the students and professors. Hears again the clang of metal as giants swept them aside with their clubs, off the bridge. Into the abyss.
Potter had left him to the wolves and gone to bed, and Draco had explained very vaguely that he had been outside but broken his ankle and Potter had helped him back up, which was not a good enough excuse for the three girls, but he’d refused to say any more.
“Earth to Harry?” Daphne’s voice interrupted his musing.
Harry jolted awake with a gasp. Malfoy pulled his hand away from Harry’s shoulder. It’s darker in the room now. Harry can barely make out the other boy’s pale eyes. He inhaled deep breaths.
“You can’t do anything about it,” Draco said quietly, but there was a steel edge in his voice. “The fact is that I did horrible things and I was a coward. I’m the reason Death Eaters broke into this school, I’m the reason Dumbledore is dead, what I did sparked everything into happening.” Harry’s heart broke a little to hear Draco’s voice get steadily quieter and fill with despair.
At the beginning of the summer he had been invited to stay with the Weasley’s. As much as he normally loved spending time at the Burrow, playing Quidditch with Ron and Ginny in the back field, and enjoying Molly Weasley’s cooking; Harry had known that he did not want to burden the grieving family, as much as they protested it would be welcome. He had thought it best to leave them be for the summer, although he still had sent letters to Ron.
“Good morning, students.” began Amelie with a brilliant smile, her hands clasped in front of her. “My name is Ms. Amelie, and this is Mr. Harry.” Harry raised his eyebrows at her, and she shot him a just-go-with-it look. He snorted but let her go on. “Now, could we all go around and say our names, please? In English. Your name, and your favorite food, how about that. Let’s start over here.” She motioned to the front of one row, and a small girl with curly, dark hair cut in a bob stood up.
“Alright, now we just let it simmer and stir. Can you stir?” he asked Harry in a tired voice, and Harry nodded. “Counter clockwise ten times, then clockwise ten until it turns pearly-colored. I’ll tell you when,” he instructed.
“Malfoy.” Draco snapped out of his thoughts and met Potter’s eyes. They’re wide and earnest and so different from the glares he’s usually directed at Draco.
The four of them walked up to the common room, and Draco exchanged an amused look with Harry. Hermione was walking in between them, and Ron on Harry’s other side, so they weren’t joined together by the hand anymore, but knowing Draco, he was planning a showy moment to reveal their relationship. Harry chuckled to himself.
“Second, we have new professors this year. The new Transfigurations teacher is Professor Eagry. Professor Kiva will be taking the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Rindle will be teaching Muggle Studies, and Professor Athme will cover the subject of Potions.” As each name is called, the new teachers stood and a polite round of applause rung out for each one.
“Because someone cursed your broom, Draco. Someone tried to kill you.” said Harry darkly, and Draco shivered.
“Alright. No one vomited this time. We had to teach them about countries.” replied Harry nonchalantly, fiddling with his glasses. Draco snorted.
“Not me.” announced Potter.
“I’m nervous,” blurted Harry, then abruptly closed his mouth as his cheeks reddened. He looked away from Draco, who kept gazing at him.
“I don’t want an apology that you don’t really mean,” Hermione said, her voice like steel. Malfoy fiddled with his sleeves, and Harry with a pang of amusement realized this is the first time he’s seen Malfoy feel awkward and not his usual aloof self.
“Pansy and Blaise.” explained Draco, lacing his fingers through Harry’s.
“He and I share Herbology, and we have an essay due next week. I wanted to ask him about it,” she explained, and Harry nodded, forcibly ignoring the wave of relief that swept through him at the knowledge that she didn’t like Draco or anything like that. “Oh, here we are.” exclaimed Amelie, and with a sigh Harry followed her out of the carriage and up the steps of the school, trying in vain to think of snow, little children, owls, anything but the blond, snarky Slytherin who sat in the dining hall.
“Oh, absolutely. It’s quite easy, you know,” said Draco airily.
“You should go sleep, Draco.” said Hermione gently.
“...yes.” he admitted.
“Oh, you got me one of those sweaters you have!”
“That’s wrong, Granger. Third law is the most important.” Hermione looked him up and down with thinly veiled contempt; she might’ve accepted his apology but she still didn’t like him, especially when he was telling her she was wrong.
saying last night that she was from Australia.
“Thank you.”
It was two weeks after Harry had left the hospital wing, two weeks since they’d planned the visit with Andromeda and Narcissa. Harry was slightly apprehensive, and so was Draco- he could tell because the nervous twisting in his stomach had been doubled.
“I can’t settle on any one memory. I’ve tried a few. Stargazing with my mother when I was little, the first time I rode a broom. Things like that.” explained Draco, twirling his wand between his fingers. Harry smiled reminiscently. “What?”
“Could you show me how to do one?” asked Draco. He no longer wanted to ask her to do it for him, as he’d realized going down there just for that was rude, and he’d enjoyed her company. She didn’t owe him any favors, either.
“Oh, look at that,” breathed Draco, his eyes shining with wonder as he gazed up at the sky. Harry followed suit and his mouth parted in awe. The meteor shower had started, and it was breathtaking. Arcs of light raced across the deep blue sky, and all of the normal stars were out in full force, making a kaleidoscope of dots and patterns.
“Harry, wake up.” he said, but when the other boy doesn’t stir he does it again. “Harry.” Finally Harry’s eyes shoot open, and he took great, shuddering breaths. Draco retreated back to his own bed and let Harry have some space. “Nightmare?” he asked quietly.
“You went on the exchange trip as well, did you not?” asked Narcissa, and Harry nodded.
“She, er, kind of helped me along.” admitted Harry, and Draco raised his eyebrows.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw more people stream down from the dormitories; Daphne Greengrass immediately rushed over to Malfoy’s motionless form.
“Ah, yes. You did faint a lot that year.” Draco quipped, and Harry shook his head with a smile. “But I don’t know what it is that’s not making it work. It’s-” he exhaled. “-frustrating.”
“Wow,” he said faintly. “Well, thank you, Hermione. And thanks to all of you,” he added to the knot of Healers standing a little farther from them, and they smiled and nodded at him. And thank you, Draco, Harry added silently.
“So do you have any idea of where you want to go after school?” asked McGonagall. She slid a plate of biscuits across the table. “Have a biscuit, Potter.” Harry smiled and took a
“Harry, why did you come with me? I thought you didn’t like Malfoy.” They stop walking.
“See you.”
Draco exhaled in frustration. “Keep your shit together today.” he whispered forcefully to himself. This would all be so much easier if Potter looked like Weasley. Draco would have no problems then.
“That’s wonderful. I’m showering first.” he announced, and without further ado he ran into the bathroom and closed the door behind him. Harry heard the sound of running water, and steam began seeping out from under the door.
“Yeah, we can do a joint letter.” he answered sincerely, and Harry laughed before starting to eat.
Harry glanced over at Draco next to him, who was writing neatly and concisely and biting his lip in concentration. His notes were at a stark contrast to Harry’s messy, meandering scrawl. He always found it difficult to take notes when the teacher was talking; often he wrote too slow and couldn’t catch up, or couldn’t remember the whole sentence he was supposed to be writing.
“What’s a video?” She blinked before laughing, and Draco scowled at her. “Don’t laugh at me, Granger.”
Draco suddenly realized- his mother and Bellatrix had another sister. Andromeda? Yes, that was her name. He had never met her, of course. She married a Muggleborn, so naturally the rest of his family ceased contact with her. Then he saw another figure standing beside her.
“Is this about the you being gay thing?” prodded Harry tentatively.
He hadn’t gone back to that clearing since he’d returned to Hogwarts, and he didn’t intend to. He didn’t need too anymore.
“Yeah.” said Harry, feeling a small thrill of anticipation at the promise of a Seeker’s game. “It would be nice to be alone for a while.” They were constantly surrounded by other students, and hadn’t had a chance in a few days to just be together. Or snog properly. Which Harry really wanted to do.
“Hey, Dean I’m alright now.” he replied, and Thomas offered a smile to Draco as well as they passed, and Draco returned it hesitantly. He and Harry entered the dorm, Harry still keeping a firm grip on his hand. They went over to Draco’s bed, and Harry picked up a quill laying forgotten on his bedside table.
He knew how Draco felt about this subject, that part of him still loathed himself for the past. And Harry understood, he saw Draco’s reasons for this. But he also saw the boy he’d gone ice skating with, who tried on his glasses and helped him with panic attacks. Just a boy, like everyone else. Draco saw himself as fully responsible for every bad thing from
It was December 31, New Year’s, and Harry had just burst into the previously quiet dorm room and announced that they- meaning Draco, Harry, and all their friends- were going ice skating on a nearby lake. And now here they were.
“Have fun?” asked Daphne airily, and Draco kicked her under the table. She chuckled.
“Why?” he asked quietly, staring at the blond. Draco shook his head, turning away from Harry.
“Hey!” exclaimed Harry indignantly. “I don’t have toad eyes.” Draco snorted.
“It wasn’t your fault.” he said. “I know you think it is, but it wasn’t.” Draco didn’t say anything. Harry was wrong about that, but Draco didn’t want to argue about this again. Right now he just wanted to sit with his boyfriend and enjoy the fact that Harry wasn’t dead or still unconscious.
“Oh- yeah.” he responded, flustered. Whenever he thought about Draco it felt like everyone could tell, like he was broadcasting his thoughts or being super obvious. He hoped that wasn't true.
Eventually Harry, Ron, and Hermione went back up to the school, Ron and Hermione holding hands. The sky is rapidly darkening as the sun lowered. The trio head into the Great Hall for dinner.
“As soon as it opens you do,” announced Camille, and Draco sighed.
Draco made his way to the eighth year dorms, because he’s still wearing yesterday's robes and that will not do. He stopped in front of the dragon portrait and said “Aurea Anthos.”
“Brilliant. There’s an Animagus club that me and Amelie are going to try.” Harry responded.
“Good morning, Headmistress.” he replied as he sat down.
“He’s acting weird today,” commented Daphne quietly, so only Harry could hear her.
And so they sat there on the ground, Draco’s back against Harry’s chest, hearts beating in time. Together.
“You- how did you-” he spluttered, and Daphne and Harry exchanged an amused glance.
Harry smiled to himself as he read the letter, his fingers grazing over Teddy’s near-ineligible signature, the ink splattered all around it. He would love to visit them. It would be a nice change.
knowing he was the cause of Potter
“Sounds fun,” Simon replied.
Madam Pomfrey and the St Mungo’s Healers had been working nonstop, and they’d managed to lessen the pain, although they hadn’t found a way to end the curse, which was still going on, causing Harry pain bad enough to keep him knocked out just from that. Draco had been keeping vigil by Harry’s bedside for the last two days, watching him as he lay still and praying helplessly.
Their lips were pressed together, at first tentatively, softly, but then Draco let out a soft whimper and his hands came up to thread through Harry’s hair, pulling him closer. Harry could barely think straight, what with the other boy so close, and the fact that they were kissing-
Falling in love, and Draco could already tell that nothing either of them could do would stop him. Part of him shied at the thought, because caring that much for someone… it took a different kind of courage than the courage needed to fight. Something more like the bravery it had taken Draco to confide in someone else.
Harry kissed him again, trying to express how he felt at that. It was just- it made Harry feel like he was flying, soaring. The memory of him had gotten Draco his Patronus. Draco was happy with him. And being around him made Harry feel like the most special person in the world.
Daphne walked away, taking her bubble of warm air with her, and a chill wrapped around him as he stood still, goosebumps covering his skin. But Harry didn’t care about that, he could barely feel it. There was a warmth in his chest, a glowing warmth around his heart that beat to those four words. Draco likes me back.
“Wonderful, wonderful. Let’s see.. Mr. Potter, would you like to demonstrate for us?”
“Alright.”
“That,” said Professor Athme dryly, “is what happens when you drop your jar of powdered dragon claw. Everyone please be more careful next class.” Harry blinked, suddenly grateful that he hadn’t been the one to cause the explosion, although he almost would have been if Malfoy hadn’t caught their jar before it rolled off the desk.
“I still don’t know why you’re asking me. It’s not like I have a clue what I’m getting Harry, either. You should ask him. He’s better at this relationship stuff.”
Suddenly there’s the sound of glass shattering behind them and for the second time in two days Draco is blown backwards into a wall, a deafening roar in his ears. This time he didn’t crack his head, but he coughed as he breathed in black smoke, which clouded the room. The air is searing hot. He struggled to push himself up, but something loomed out of the haze and fell on him, knocking him back to the floor.
He set his jaw. Draco never should’ve told any of them. Father was right, nothing good ever came of divulging things like this, it just made you vulnerable and it’ll come back and hurt you later. He made the mistake of confiding in Pansy, and now she had blabbed and Daphne had tried to use the information to convince him to ‘be a better person’. Merlin, he wished he’d just stormed out of the library. Talking to Granger and Potter was not something he needed badly enough that he would willingly put up with this shit.
Harry fell asleep.
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” he said, squirreled away in his dorm, and watched the ink appear onto the worn parchment, swirling into names and footprints. Harry perused the small letters, searching for the familiar name. After a few terse minutes, he saw Malfoy’s name floating out by the forest, and Harry frowned. What was he doing out
“What was the school like? The teachers? The courses? How were your programs?” Hermione asked eagerly. Harry decided to imitate Ron and let Draco do the talking, at least for now. So Draco told them about the school, and everything else while Harry sat back and listened.
Ten minutes later he was finally done and he sat back in his seat, arms crossed. Most of the eighth years had gone up to their dorms while he was talking, as it was getting a bit late. Draco could see Harry, Hermione, and Weasley over in the corner, and he caught Harry’s eye. Harry raised his eyebrows, and Draco flipped him off. He heard Harry laughing as the Gryffindor turned back around.
“Yeah, I think you’re right.” he replied. Draco started to say something else, but stopped talking when the desserts appeared, and Harry had to laugh at the way his eyes roved over the dishes. “You’d think we didn’t already eat, Draco. You know, you’re not all that different from Ron, even with all your fancy talk. You both love food.” Harry teased. Draco glared at him.
“Sorry,” he said, sounding not sorry at all, before continuing his kisses down Draco’s neck, his hands exploring Draco’s stomach, his chest. Harry sucked a tender spot on Draco’s throat, before licking down his neck, and Draco let out a small sigh. Merlin, I could die from this, thought Draco, his head spinning as he lay there, almost prone, unable to move, not wanting anything except for Harry to never stop doing what he was doing. His own hands were wandering instinctively across Harry’s back, sliding across his warm skin, feeling the muscles shift on Harry’s back.
“Why is she in the forest? Like way in it?”
“Are you always this talkative in the morning?” asked Harry dryly.
“What’s going on?” Potter suddenly walked down the stairs in front of Draco, eyes widening at something over Draco’s shoulder. “Seamus, what are you-”
“That’s the latest edition of the woolly bladder.” he said, and Hermione glared at him.
“Mother,” he said to himself, recognizing the elegant handwriting. He opened it and sat back down again.
“What happened?” he said weakly, and Harry helped him sit up.
“That was- horrible,” whispered Draco finally, listening to Harry’s shallow breaths. Draco’s heart was pounding. He could hear it thumping, like it knew how close it had come to going silent and still. Harry exhaled.
“Morning.” replied Draco, a returning smile tugging at the edges of his mouth. Harry yawned, throwing off his blankets and setting his feet on the floor.
But as they’d walked to the Owlery, he’d made a promise to himself. I’ll be a better person now. In memory of the past, in honor of the past, I will do better. Be the person I want to be. Make my own choices.
“Yeah.” replied Harry, stopping when he was struck by an idea. “Hey- you said your mother and Andromeda were reconciled, right?”
“That’s us,” he said, his finger on the pairs of footprints adjacent to each other in the eighth year boys dorm.
“Time to get up, sleepyheads,” called Camille, and Draco heard her go and bang on all of the other dorm rooms as well. He groaned and let his head fall back onto the pillow, and had almost succeeded in falling asleep again when someone prodded his shoulder.
“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, sit down, sit down,” said Madam Pomfrey, bustling over from a group of people Harry hadn’t seen. They looked like Healers, with the St Mungo’s wand and bone cross on their robes, and they followed the hospital wing matron over to Harry’s bed.
“Are you ready for the trip?” Harry turned at Draco’s voice and found him laying on his side, propping up his head with an arm.
“I remember that one you sent me, Harry.” she said. “What was it that she said? Oh yes-” Hermione pulled it out of her bag to Ron’s laughter and Harry’s spluttering- “I’m your biggest fan, I even have a tattoo of your name, so if you ever need a girlfriend, or a hookup, just know I’m here. Kisses, Julia.” They all snorted.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Well, you’re not, so get up.” Draco let out a lengthy sigh and slowly sat up.
Harry opened the door, silently cursing the way his hand was trembling slightly.
“She was my first true link to the magical world. And to my childhood, I guess. So I wanted to have something that could symbolize that connection, and memorialize her and everyone who I’ve lost.” Harry explained, pulling his shirt back up. The other boy’s eyes were still perusing his shoulder, but snapped back up to Harry’s eyes.
“Hermione’s the exact same.” replied Harry somewhat carefully, and Blaise snorted and shook his head in amusement.
“Classe quatre sois tranquille et asseyez-vous!” shouted Amelie over the noise, which quieted as the children noticed the two teacher-students. A couple of them muttered, but they all complied, sitting down at their desks and giving Amelie their full attention.
Dinner was delicious, as the house-elves always outdid themselves at feasts. Harry was about to help himself to a piece of treacle tart, before spotting Draco down the table, gesticulating wildly with an éclair in hand. Harry smiled and took instead a piece of dark chocolate, remembering Draco’s tirade about the horrors of too much sugar, but pulled a face at the bitter chocolate. Harry set it aside and took a slice of chocolate cake instead.
“Night.” Harry said, turning off his lamp.
“Don’t freak out,” he muttered. “Someone tried to kill Draco just now.” Daphne gasped quietly and Blaise raised his eyebrows. Pansy was scrutinizing him sharply.
The chatter continued on in this way and Harry was content just to listen. Every now and then, as he made his way through a piece of treacle tart, he let his eyes drift across the room and tried to spot cracks or damage from last year. But it looked as normal as ever.
“Well no, but it’s all so interesting and the point is, Ronald-” she gave him a look that Harry called the you-need-to-be-studying-and-finish-your-homework-not-talk-about-Quidditch look, “-that you can do, well, anything you want!”
And with this newfound knowledge came the extremely weird fact that other blokes that he’d known for so long were attractive to him. One of those, he was slightly ashamed to admit, was Malfoy, and Harry had been indulging in a bit of staring every now and then.
“Oh, by the way,” he added, tilting his head towards the door. “Amelie’s waiting for you. Something about an all-day excursion?” Harry groaned
“I don’t know, watching you get drunk was pretty funny.” teased Harry, and Draco rolled his eyes, throwing a pillow at him. Harry caught it and tucked it under his head.
“What’s a therapist?” interjected Draco.
It was like he was a balloon, but someone had popped his swelling emotions and now he was deflating, coming back down to earth as Draco’s words registered in his head.
“Yeah, while I was down at the village I sent it off.”
“Why? If you don’t mind me asking.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You have nothing to be sorry for,” replied Draco, his arms twined around Harry’s neck as he looked up at him. “I probably should have told you straight up.”
“What you guys did didn’t look like talking to me,” muttered Blaise, and Pansy cackled. Draco smacked Blaise’s arm, which was the closest bit of him he could reach. Daphne snickered.
They put on coats again and went outside, slowing to a stop in a courtyard in the gardens they had been using for Patronus practice, a small grassy area bordered by low hedges.
“Well, pointy blond Slytherins aside, I hope there’s sausage.” Ron said eagerly, making Hermione snort.
“If you slept more, I wouldn’t have to wake you up in the morning.” Draco smiled at that.
Draco finally relaxed and leaned back against him, the crown of his head just under Harry’s chin. “Definitely wait,” he decided. “I want to see their faces.” Harry grinned.
“About the same. It’ll be nice to…”
They worked in silence for the better part of an hour, the book ping-ponging between them. Eventually Malfoy set down his quill and neatly rolled up his parchment and pushed the book one final time over to Harry’s side of the table.
“..I heard McGonagall got a new Transfiguration professor. Makes sense, since she’s Headmistress now, but it’ll be weird not learning from her..” Susan discreetly pointed out a tall
“The classes aren’t in french, are they?” Daphne whispered, with a worried expression, and Simon chuckled.
“Yeah.”
“I think I understand.” Harry replied gently, aware that the other boy was in a fragile state at the moment. He could see it in the slight trembling of his hands, in the hunch of his shoulders.
“Just tell them that, then!”
“Why’d you choose a phoenix?” asked Harry, somewhat gently.
“Then help me to,” replied Harry, pouring all of his jumbled emotions into his voice. “Tell me what’s wrong.” He wanted to understand, wanted to know why Draco was retreating. Why he said this couldn’t work.
“Yeah, we spent the summer together in France. How were yer summers?” he added.
“Oh, Mr. Malfoy, you’re awake. Good. I need you to take this potion, dearie.” Madam Pomfrey’s cheery voice came floating across the room, and after her words reached Draco the lady herself did; he could hear her pouring a measure of some foul-smelling potion into a cup. He wrinkled his nose, at the smell and her calling him dearie, and opened his eyes again, slower this time.
“But you won’t sleep more, will you?” asked Harry dryly.
“We should get going, Draco. Classroom’s on the other side of the school.” said Daphne, and Draco nodded, standing.
“Let’s practice later today, alright?” said Harry, and Draco met his gaze slightly reluctantly.
“Draco, we were just outside in the freezing cold and you were fine.”
“If you want to put it that way.” she replied poshly, and they leave for lunch.
“Simon said he might ask Daphne to the ball,” said Amelie with a mischievous smile, and Harry looked over at her.
“Can we share it?” Malfoy paused, then sighed in what seemed to be annoyance and grudgingly nodded. He nudged the book over to Harry, and Harry started his work.
“I wasn’t going to put that in a letter!” he protested, and Pansy let out an impressive drafty sigh.
Draco nodded, a determined look on his face, and raised his wand.
“Now, as you all know, there are no dormitories for eighth years. Therefore all of you will have your own common room and dormitories. On the east third-floor hallway, in front of the portrait of the red dragon. I will take you all there in a moment.”
“You sure you didn’t miss me?” said Harry again when they drew apart, smirking, and Draco rolled his eyes.
Next to him, Daphne pulled a face. “Jumping off a tower is so messy.” She sideyed him. “Pray tell me before you jump so I can call someone to clean your guts off the Courtyard.”
“I guess. Later today, then.” Draco replied ruefully, biting his lower lip as he resumed his stare out the window, and Harry watched him, as he tended to do whenever Draco did that. It just made him look so… irresistible. Harry flushed a little at this thought, but resolutely admitted to himself that that was the best way to describe it. As odd as it was.
Draco nodded to the Aurors and grasped the handle of his trunk. As the two wizards stood on either side of him in preparation to Apparate, they took his arms. He had to fight the urge to tear free from their grips. A second later he felt the gut-twisting sensation and just before he disappeared, looked to his mother standing in front of Malfoy Manor, a solitary figure swallowed by a greater shadow.
“Yes, I remember when Fleur and Madam Maxime left with a group of students for the Triwizard Tournament. I was only in third year, but I remember wanting to go so badly and visit another school. Although I do like our uniforms better.” Amelie smoothed her skirt and Harry smiled.
As expected, Pansy let out a little shriek, drawing every eye in the common room. Draco raised his eyebrows at her, Blaise sniggering across from them.
“Oh shut up, Potty.”
“Sure,” replied Draco, pushing aside the tapestry covering the other end of the passage and holding it back so Harry could come out. “Just us?”
“He’ll be alright.” said Ron, sounding as though he was trying to convince himself as much as he was Draco. He was sitting in a chair next to Draco, watching Harry. Draco didn’t say anything.
“Draco!” Harry screamed from somewhere, but Draco didn’t know where he was. He was tumbling through the air, still clutching the two halves of his broken broom. His robes were dragging in the air as he fell. Someone was yelling- no, he was yelling. The ground was approaching, too fast, and Draco was still falling, and he couldn’t do anything, he’d left his wand in his dorm, and he let out a silent sob that even he couldn’t hear over the rushing of the wind in his ears, and he didn’t want to die-
“Ready?” said Draco, fingers clutched around the struggling Snitch.
“Don’t count on it, Malfoy.”
“Yeah.” Draco felt a sudden empathy for the boy next to him. They were both so impacted by the war, and it still haunted both of them, physically and mentally. People treated them differently after the war.
“Oh- damn. I forgot about her. She’ll murder me.” Malfoy groaned and flopped backwards so he was laying down. “Can we talk about this later, Potter? Help me walk back up to the school, because no offense but I don’t trust you to heal my ankle, and I can’t do it myself.”
“I always forget your name literally means dragon. Dragon Malfoy.” Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry turned and framed Draco’s face with his hands before leaning forward and pressing their lips together, an electric buzz sparking through him at the touch. Harry could feel his heartbeat- their heartbeats- speeding up. It never failed to amaze him how amazing it felt to kiss Draco, every time. They drew apart, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from smiling.
Hermione jumped up and hugged Harry tightly, and only when Ron cleared his throat did she let go.
thought Draco, trying very hard to ignore every single person’s eyes on them as they went to the eighth year table.
If he’s being honest he wants nothing more than to go find Finnegan and go repay the favor of putting Draco in the hospital wing, but he knew if he did he would probably get expelled. Technically he was still under probation. He could only hope that Finnegan got punished soundly.
“Yup. And Ron, and Hermione.” Potter unfolded a section and pointed his own finger at two more names in the Great Hall.”
“Oh, right. I still need that back. You better not have messed it up.” Draco and Harry descended the front steps. It was dusk, and the last faint rays of sunlight stretched across the sky, painting it with streaks of red.
“No.” said Draco firmly, and a pressure Harry hadn’t noticed eased off his chest. “He asked to talk, and then he...well, you saw. But I shoved him off, told him I didn’t like him like that.” There was a pause as Harry digested this, but he didn’t say anything. “I’m sorry I snapped at you.” continued Draco, his voice soft.
Harry had said she was a very forgiving and kind person, and that fit what Draco remembered of her. When he’d brought her and Mr. Ollivander hot food, and some healing salve for the cuts and bruises inflicted, she’d been surprisingly cheerful, thanking Draco, smiling at him, starting a conversation about some magical creature that Draco didn’t know about (but apparently, his house was full of them). It had jarred Draco then, because why would a captive be grateful to someone who wouldn’t let them out of a horrible place?
“No,” Draco repeated stubbornly, if a bit breathlessly. “I will not.” Harry frowned.
“What were you thinking of?” Harry asked. “Not that you have to say, I mean-”
“You were yelling,” explained Malfoy, his tone unreadable.
“Talking about Christmas presents. And no, Daphne, you may not tell anyone at this table what I got them.” he added sternly to Daphne, who pouted. Camille sighed.
Harry sighed. They hadn’t really thought of that, had they? Another reason he was eternally glad to have Hermione as a friend. She always helped him see things he couldn’t before.
“Is this why you were nervous earlier?” asked Draco conversationally. Harry flushed.
“You can sit there and shut the hell up, you cretin.”
Draco sighed heavily and got dressed. He was walking over to the bathroom when he spotted a slip of paper that had been slipped under their door, and picked it up. It was an envelope, decorated with delicate silver snowflakes, and embossed in silver cursive were the words:
“Si seulement vous saviez à quel point vos compliments me rendent heureux.” whispered Draco quietly from behind him, almost absentmindedly. Harry barely comprehended it; the quiet murmur was like a song.
“Watch.” said Potter simply, and as Draco did the parchment began to turn into, well, a map.
He walked over to Harry’s bed. “Harry?” he whispered. The other boy’s brows are furrowed slightly, and a sheen of sweat gleamed on his forehead.
“Hello, Luna, Draco.” he greeted, and they both smiled at him. Harry thought Draco looked rather calmer than he usually was; he supposed Luna’s gentle ways had rubbed off on him a bit.
watched, following the lines, until Draco lowered his arm. They lay in peaceful silence, until Draco sat up with a yelp.
Harry blinks, just as shocked to find someone else in what he’d thought of as his space. The two boys stare at each other, and Harry’s hand drops from the wall. He couldn’t help but think that the other boy looks ethereal in the glow of the moon.
“Well duh not you, Potter.”
stasis spells or any potions.” Draco clenched his jaw.
“Alright.” she agreed. “Warning, my wand’s going to be in your face.”
“I’ll be right back,” said Draco. He pointed at Harry. “Stay there.”
“Hey- how were classes?” Harry asked, and Draco grinned.
“Harry and I are going to go a bit early, to practice Patronuses.” announced Draco, and they said their goodbyes and left the dining hall. “Should we go get coats?”
“Ready,” replied Harry, grinning. Draco released the Snitch and they watched it zoom away into the dusky twilight, giving it a minute’s head start before they flew into the air.
“Yeah.”
Draco sat up in his bed, suppressing a yawn. He flexed his foot experimentally, but it was healed completely. Last night, after Potter had carried him up to the castle, he’d insisted they take the longer but more discreet way up to the hospital wing so no one would see Potter carrying him, and the other boy had shaken his head but agreed. Madam Pomfrey had fixed his ankle in a trice and they’d gone back up to their dorm, where Draco had been jumped by Hermione, Daphne, and Pansy, all who’d exclaimed at his appearance and started bombarding him with questions.
The hippogriff landed a ways from them and thundered toward them.
“Doing what?” asked Harry indignantly.
“I got blood on your robes,” he said.
Draco struggled to raise his head and saw Daphne laying next to him, laughing her head off. Draco rolled his eyes at her, before dumping a handful of snow onto her face, and
“Do we have classes today?” asked Harry, his hand slipping into Draco’s as they walked through the halls.
“Do you have one?” he asked, and Draco smiled very slightly.
“Can I see it?”
He and Harry had spoken of this before, on the night when they’d first gotten together. Then, Draco had been worse off, not wanting to let himself have any joyful things in life, thinking he didn’t deserve them. And being at Hogwarts and having everything happen had brought back his guilty feelings and the desperate need to atone for something.
“You’re welcome,” declared Daphne smugly. “So- so-” Her eyes darted between them, and the two French girls hurried up behind her.
The scars from the Sectumsempra crisscrossed over Draco’s chest, long and thin and silvery. Harry traced them with a finger softly. He remembered that day so clearly. How Draco had gasped and fallen backwards, the bloom of his blood in the water, across his shirt. The pained, small noises he’d made. How terrible Harry’d felt, watching him lay there.
“Eat up, Mr. Potter, you were unconscious for two days.” she said briskly as she set down the tray, and Harry nodded, suddenly feeling the ache of hunger in his stomach. He glanced over again at the sleeping Draco, and Madam Pomfrey followed his gaze. “Don’t worry about Mr. Malfoy, he should wake up soon. He’s only sleeping, my dear,” she said warmly, and Harry nodded again, a little embarrassed, before busying himself with the food and his friends.
“I never thought I’d see the day when Harry Potter was teaching small children about the world,” teased Draco, his eyes gleaming mischievously. Harry rolled his eyes, copying Draco’s position as they faced one another, his head propped up on one arm.
“Don’t be sorry. You’re the one who just went through two days of pain because of me. I’m sorry.” mumbled Draco, and Harry leaned into him, warming his side.
Draco’s established a routine now. Woken up by Harry, going down to breakfast, where he sat next to Harry, classes. Lunch, also sitting next to Harry, and more classes. The Animagus club on Wednesday’s, where they study the process, but haven’t attempted anything yet, to some impatience. Hanging out with his friends, then dinner. Then late night talks with Harry before falling asleep. Every so often the two will have a Seeker’s Game, and Draco’s pleased that he’s won as much as Harry has.
“Harry.” reprimanded Hermione sternly. “You should read it yourself.”
“Are the core classes the same at Beauxbatons? Like Potions, Transfigurations, Charms, etcetera?” Harry smothered a grin. Only Hermione would actually use the word ‘etcetera’.
“Good evening, students.” came Professor McGonagall’s voice from the portrait hole, and everyone looked up in surprise. The Headmistress smiled at their bemused expressions.
“GO!” shouted Malfoy, and kicked off. Harry cursed and did the same, hearing Malfoy laugh ahead of him. Once Harry flew up high enough, the two boys circle the pitch, eyes scanning for the telltale gold glint.
“Hey, Teddy.” he said, mussing the baby’s hair gently.
“Yeah. He’s not horrible anymore, Ron.” he pointed out.
Harry looks over at Malfoy in surprise. The other boy was leaning against the corner of the fountain, only a few feet from him. The shadows play over his face, enunciating the hollow of his throat, his cheekbones. Harry swallows and tries to keep his voice steady when he responds.
“Yeah, that too. I always forget my jacket.” She pulled a face, and Harry shrugged his off.
Harry stood to switch seats with Malfoy, who moved deftly around him without meeting his eyes.
“Sod off,” Draco retorted, taking a wobbly step towards Harry, who backs up, grinning. Draco frowned, looking at the increased distance between them. “Potter, get over here.”
Harry could tell that Malfoy didn’t want to be here. He was eyeing Daphne resentfully, and she still had a tight grip on his arm. It was an odd situation, thought Harry. Why had Daphne forced Malfoy to come?
Draco laughed and cut him off. “No, it’s alright. Actually, I was thinking of- of you. Us.” he said, for the first time sounding shy.
“Seeing Finnegan’s fucking face when he sees us.” Draco said with relish, smirking, and Ron snorted. Harry sighed and shook his head, while Hermione pressed her lips together to keep from smiling.
He sat up slowly. Where was he? And why? Harry squinted, looking with blurry vision for his glasses. And there, a streak of silver sitting somewhere next to him. He reached out a hand and fumbled for them, feeling a pang of relief as his fingers touched the familiar metal wires and he put on his glasses, blinking.
It was Saturday, and that night they’d made plans to go out to a nearby town, to a dance club that their Beauxbatons friends adored, for some reason. Draco was looking forward to it, actually. They’d missed the first Hogsmeade trip by leaving for Beauxbatons, so it would be nice to go out with friends. Even if it was to a dance club. Draco wrinkled his nose before rolling over in his bed to face the wall, arms around the pillow.
Hermione smiled mischievously. “Yep.” She showed Malfoy how to play, and Harry felt almost a little fond of the Slytherin as his eyes light up and he swiped the screen vigorously. Malfoy snatched the phone from Hermione and bragged shamelessly when the game ended, even if he didn’t get very far.
He’d never hated himself more. It was his fault this had happened. If he hadn’t been dating Harry, they wouldn’t have been together, and Harry wouldn’t have been hit by this curse.
Camille seized their hands and dragged them over next to the dessert table, which Draco eyed hopefully.
“You’ll be fine,” he replied, and Draco shook his head sadly, making Harry laugh as they turned into the dining hall. Harry spotted Daphne, her long blond hair tied back in it’s usual green-ribboned ponytail; Simon, sitting close to Daphne with a fond smile on his face as he looked at her; Camille, in a creamy sweater, chattering away to Amelie, who was eating her croissant with a pensive expression as she listened. All their closest friends at Beauxbatons.
“Get up then, Draco.” Harry said, sending him a lazy grin. A wonderful, rakish smile that took all the fight out of Draco and made his cheeks heat. Draco huffed and got up, if only so he could turn his pink-tinged face away from Harry.
But he knew that scars that ran that deep would last a long, long time. It was a slow healing process, but Harry wanted to be there for Draco along the way.
“Yes,” replied Draco without hesitation. He didn’t mind talking about this with her. He’d known her for so long it was like talking to a sister, and she never judged him. She nodded slowly, thoughtfully.
Once they’d gotten to the hospital wing he’d been given something for shock, and once it had been poured down his throat he’d been able to tell them what had happened.
“Yes, much better than last week, when two people puked on your shoes.” she teased, and Harry pulled a face.
“Yeah.” replied Harry, shrugging.
“They’re like little stars.” Harry said softly, setting down the food. Draco and Harry sat, lit by the glow of the lights. Draco could hear the soft chirping of crickets among the undergrowth, and suddenly remembered something. He muttered a spell and transfigured a blade of grass into parchment, before spelling words onto it and folding it deftly into a paper dragon, which he then enchanted to fly back to the castle.
Draco tore his gaze away from them to look again at Harry’s motionless form on the bed, aware of everyone’s eyes on him. He knew if he did this, things would be different.
“Please don’t tell me you think that whoever tried to kill you was justified, or that you deserved it. That’s not true.” said Harry, and Draco bit his lip. Harry always read exactly how he felt. It was infuriating.
“He said he would take me to Luna Lovegood.” Pansy laughed loudly, then subsided.
“I have another thing I want to show you, Draco.” announced Hermione, and withdrew her phone. Draco rolled his eyes. “It’s a Muggle game you can play.”
“Hey!”
Daphne called his name but before he could go to her, Harry caught his sleeve.
Draco sighed as he filed out behind the other students from his Ancient Runes class. He’d barely had the focus to jot down the homework, much less take notes. He’d have to borrow Hermione’s tonight, as they were both in the same course but not the same class, regretfully.
Harry woke up with the taste of mint on his tongue. It was still nighttime, and Draco was still asleep, judging from the quiet, even breathing coming from his side of the room. Harry tentatively touched his lips with his finger, the dream still vivid in his mind.
Suddenly Harry put a hand under Draco’s chin and brought his lips to Draco’s for a chaste, slow kiss. They parted, and Draco stared at him indignantly.
Draco let go of his hand and headed upstairs with a quiet “Good night, Harry.” Harry watched him ascend the staircase, feeling frustrated that Draco seemed determined to punish himself for things he couldn’t control and weren’t his fault. He blew out a breath and went to sit across from Hermione.
Twenty minutes later they were still up in their dorm, and Harry decided now was a good a time as any to try to broach the topic with Draco. He took a deep breath and prayed silently that this wouldn’t be a complete fiasco.
Hermione, the girl he’d once sneered at for being Muggleborn was a very smart, witty, nice person to be around. Draco finally had someone that would discuss the finer points of something obscure with him, like if the use of moonlace was more potent in the Draught of Living Death than moonleaf. (They’d eventually decided to agree to disagree when Potter and Weasley had moaned that they’d been bickering for three hours and could they please shut up)
“I guess so,” Ron yawned and shook his red hair out of his eyes. “I might still try to be an Auror.”
After some time he began to hear what could only be Malfoy, cursing loudly. He checked the Map again before tucking it in his back pocket; he could hear Malfoy now and therefore had no need of it. He kept walking and soon his wand light fell on Malfoy.
He’d been so glad when Draco had kissed him again. Glad that he’d accepted Harry’s silent offer, yes, but also that Draco was letting himself have the life he should. Maybe letting go of the past. Not fully, but enough to live life in the moment, like Harry had slowly been trying to do as his nightmares had ceased.
“Well, why didn’t you use your wand?” he snapped. “Only a naïve git would willingly make contact with an unknown curse.” Harry shrugged.
“Quite a few. Although the Healer and Teacher ones are the only ones that can be done in one year of study, not two. I suppose that’s why those were the only options for the ten of you Hogwarts students.” Harry nodded thoughtfully, and the two of them tuned in to Draco’s conversation with Simon.
“Says the one who has like ten sweaters.”
“Why do you know that, though?” Hermione mused as she turned a page of her book.
“Eh, don’t worry about that. Easy to get around.” Draco waved a hand flippantly as they ambled out of the clearing. Harry raised his eyebrows.
“How do you know I have them? You can’t even see.”
“It’s a hat, Ronald,” she snapped. “Well?” she said to Draco.
Draco was a little tempted to sit with Harry, Weasley, and Hermione, but he did want to enjoy one last night with his Slytherin friends, who he admitted he’d been neglecting a little lately. So he ate dinner with the three of them and managed to stop himself from glancing down the table at Potter too often.
“I hadn’t really thought about it, but Hermione suggested being a teacher, like how I taught the DA, and I liked that idea.” he said, taking a bite of the biscuit.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand, and they Apparated back to Hogwarts. There was fresh snow on the grounds, making everything bright and beautiful, and Harry inhaled the cold air with relish. Draco snickered, pointing at a group of distant figures by the lake, their shrieks echoing across the water.
On days like today, Draco hated himself. What he’s done.
So far the day hadn’t been that bad. He’d gone to classes, both of which he’d shared with Hermione and Daphne, Ancient Runes and Charms. He’d had to endure some rude mutterings, but all in all not too bad.
“Lies,” Draco muttered under his breath, and Daphne bounded over to perch on the arm of the chair Harry was sitting in.
Harry was beginning to think Hermione might be onto something when she said that Malfoy might have changed. Harry hadn’t had the time to think about all their weird meetings earlier, because of the whole Seamus attacking Malfoy thing.
“Your quills are always so fancy,” he said, meeting Draco’s eyes with that wonderful smile, and before he could comprehend what he was doing Draco leaned forward and kissed him. Threaded his fingers through that beautiful, messy dark hair and pulled him closer. Reveled in the taste of vanilla that swept through his mouth. He hadn’t realized how much he’d missed kissing Harry. Snogging him properly, being able to take their time. It was like a spark, and Harry was the wind that coaxed him into a wildfire.
As for his friends, well, he knew he couldn’t count on them. Blaise, Pansy, he knew how they thought, how much their families were like his own. And he knew that they had most likely been told to cease contact with him, as his own father would have ordered him to do if one of them was in his current position. But Draco said nothing, letting his mother imagine a happy school year for him. It was the least he could do for her.
“Sorry about bothering you that night.” Harry replies, and Malfoy shakes his head slightly.
“So,” the Gryffindor ventured, his eyes a bit soft at the edges as he watched Draco. “Why have you been disappearing into the grounds?” Draco turned his head away. This was almost the same topic, thought Potter didn’t know that.
He was in the hospital wing, laying on a bed. It looked as if it were mid-morning, judging by the bright light streaming in from the high windows.
“Then we’ll deal with it. Together.” said Harry firmly, and Draco nodded, still in a happy daze. He saw the same ecstasy reflected in Harry’s green eyes, and his lips curved up into a small smile. Harry’s hands wrapped around his waist and pulled him forward until their lips could meet, and Draco wound his arms around Harry’s neck as the sweet taste of vanilla filled his mouth.
“Right. Didn’t you yell at her and tell her I didn’t like her valentine?” he pointed out, and Draco shrugged.
“Love?” sputtered Draco. “All the pet names in the world and you go for love?”
Every night he went up early, to avoid the other boys in his dorm, and downed a measure of the Dreamless Sleep potion he got from Pomfrey before getting in bed and spelling the curtains shut. In the morning, he always woke early and left, usually before any of the other boys are awake.
“Considering you worked on it, it’s decent.” he replied, but it’s more of a teasing remark than an insult. Harry smirked.
“It’s not a necklace. Well, it is, but not really. It’s imbued with a Calming Charm. Whenever you get panic attacks, just hold it and it’ll activate the charm and help you calm down.” explained Draco somewhat hesitantly, watching Harry’s reaction carefully. He was rewarded with a smile, small at first but growing delightly.
“It’s the least you can do for me, Pansy.” The other girl rolled her eyes with a sigh.
“Because we’re friends now, and I worry when you leave for a long time without telling anyone.” Potter replied, and his words make Draco’s heart flutter. He took a shaky breath and let it out. His hands brushed parchment; the Map had dropped into his lap from numb fingers.
“I don’t have it.” insisted Harry, doing a bad job of hiding his grin. “Honest.” Draco glared at him, crossing his arms.
“Alright,” replied Harry softly, letting go of his gentle grip of Draco’s arm. Draco gave him the barest hint of a smile and slipped his hand into Harry’s as they resumed walking.
“Draco?”
“You took like twenty-five minutes!” he exclaimed.
Soon they tumbled out at the village, which was bedecked with strands of lights. The air was cold, and whipped against Harry’s face.
“Who does he think he is,” muttered Harry, glaring at Theo’s letter. “Writing shit like this.” He threw it down upon the desk and sat down, the cords in his neck standing out.
“Hey.” said Harry, and sneezed again. “I think I have a cold from last night. Sorry.” He was a slightly pitiful sight to behold, miserably huddled in his blanket, his nose reddish.
“Yes it is, but I have an image to uphold, Potty.” he snapped, and Harry snickered.
“Like his soul,” finished Harry, and Draco remembered the many times he’d said that back at Hogwarts, and the two boys grinned at each other. Camille laughed.
“I am not shorter than you.” snapped Draco, and Harry smirked.
“Not the poems?” he replies with a small smile. The sight of a real smile on Malfoy’s face is surprising to Harry, but he likes it.
He was also exceedingly quiet and withdrawn, barely participating in classes. He always seemed to do well in them, though. He was adept at every class. Harry rarely saw him in the Great Hall at mealtimes, even when all the other eighth year Slytherins were there. The only person Malfoy seemed to speak to was Blaise Zabini.
He turned to Pansy, who was scrutinizing him closely.
He could hear the water running in the bathroom, and sat up slowly. Last night… last night felt like a fever dream. So much had happened, his mind was spinning trying to grasp it all. Not to mention his talk with Harry when Draco’d returned from the town. Something had shifted between them, but Draco had fallen asleep before he’d had a chance to take it in and figure it out. For once he hadn’t had a nightmare, even though he’d forgotten his dose of Dreamless Sleep.
“There she is.” Harry peeked over his shoulder and pointed at the edge of the map. Draco blushed at the other boy’s closeness, glad Harry didn’t have a view of his face, then Draco frowned.
“Yeah.” responded Draco, repeating the spell on one of his own bags before storing all the others inside of it, so he only had to carry one. Harry copied him and soon they set off to the carriage station.
“You’re still thinking about it, aren’t you?” he said, fingers tracing over Draco’s tattoo.
Harry’s hands were trembling as he walked up the grassy hill. Oh Merlin, why was he doing this? It had been stressing him out all week, making him increasingly jumpy, and Draco had definitely noticed, although by some stroke of luck everything had gone smoothly so far. As they’d left the ballroom, Daphne had caught Harry’s eye and given him an encouraging sort of smile, but it hadn’t done much to soothe his nerves.
would let them walk all over him.
Draco glanced at him, a small smirk on his face.
The blond frowned. “Those are the strongest memories I have, though.” Harry felt a pang of sympathy, but didn’t let it show, as he knew that wasn’t something Draco would appreciate. Does he have a happy memory that’s strong enough?
Harry rolled his eyes. “Merlin, it was so chaotic. I forgot how energetic little kids are. Almost wore out my shoes chasing down this one kid.” Draco snorted but went to draw Harry down for a kiss.
“Lovely to see you again, Mr. Potter.” she said smoothly, and Harry blinked.
Inside, the temperature was much warmer, and Harry shed his coat. Soon, though, his eyes were drawn to the pale woman sitting in an armchair, a turquoise-haired baby on her lap. Narcissa Malfoy.
And when Harry had reassured him, had banished Draco’s worst fears of not being loved, cared for, forgiven… Draco had almost sobbed in relief. Those steady words had lightened his heart.
Someone caught his arm and pulled him out of the crowd.
“Oh,” said Draco, blushing. “Nothing.”
“Blanket,” he demanded, his hand outstretched as he glared at Harry. Harry smirked.
“Yes, Mother.” he answered dutifully. Draco could only imagine what the Aurors thought of all this. The young man with blond hair and a dark suit saying goodbye to his mother, who was living in a shell of a home. He wondered if their eyes were drawn to his covered forearm, if they could see the memories flitting like ghosts behind his eyes. If they hated him, as he hated himself.
“Yes.” confirmed Harry. “It didn’t hurt at all, either.” he added, and Draco nodded slowly, his hand moving almost unconsciously to his left forearm, where the scar lay. “Do you want to go get dinner?” asked Harry, and Draco frowned a little. “Or we could go grab something from the kitchens.”
He finally looked around at Harry, who was still asleep, seeing as it was the weekend and they didn’t have classes. Draco smiled fondly at Harry, seeing as Harry was asleep and couldn’t see Draco’s obvious show of affection. His hair lay messily on his forehead, and his lips were parted slightly, drawing in deep, slow breaths as he slept. He looked different with his glasses off- a little younger.
“...see over there, that’s him…”
The month of January had been quite good, about the same as the previous two months they’d been at Beauxbatons. Draco had immersed himself in Healing classes, dinners with his friends, and being with Harry. It had been- was- like a preview of someone else’s life, and Draco could still hardly wrap his mind around the fact that it was his own life he was experiencing. That the nightmarish events were over. That there was no clock ticking down the borrowed time. That it was real.
“Hey,” said Daphne, perching on a sofa arm. Draco gently shoved her over to make room and sat down next to her, greeting Blaise.
Daphne was still watching him, a speculative expression on her face.
“You like him.” said Daphne, and Harry’s heart stopped for what seemed like years.
“There’s so much sugar in that thing! It’s not healthy!” Malfoy exclaimed, and Harry snickered when he realized Malfoy’s actually concerned about this.
“Draco?” His mother gazed at him with a worried expression. He had a feeling she knew what had gone through his head. He had never been able to hide anything from her, even as a boy.
I mean, at least they’d accepted his sad attempts at an apology, mused Draco, pushing away his embarrassment. Not that he really knew what that entailed. Bloody hell, classes were going to be awkward as fuck. Every time he thought of Potter or Granger an image of himself talking about his bloody feelings came into his head and he cringed. What had come over him? He’d stopped looking at Potter when he answered Granger, but even when he’d stared at the ground he’d still seen those gorgeous eyes in front of him. He’d been speaking to Potter, really. Not that anyone would ever know that.
He was always fiddling with his quill or tapping his fingers on desks, but purposefully, like he was playing a piano. Harry sometimes saw him do this with his eyes closed, like there was music playing that only he could hear.
“I thought you might be out here somewhere.”
“Yes,” he began. “Thanks for meeting me, Professor Sudi.” he added hastily. The professor smiled but motioned for him to go on. “I was wondering if it was possible to imbue an object with a Healing spell? Like, for instance, let’s say the patient has severe panic attacks. Could we imbue a small trinket with a spell that would help during those panic attacks, maybe like if they held it it would activate the spell?”
The dim moonlight lit up the room enough that Draco could see Harry frowning.
But not unfamiliar. After all, if he thought about it the outcome of the war had depended on him, partly. If he had truly died that day when Voldemort had killed the piece of his soul that lived in Harry, countless more people would have died in Voldemort’s dark reign because of it.
They’d spent yesterday mostly in their room, snogging and talking in equal amounts. It was still very new, this thing between them, and Draco was being as careful as he could to not fuck up. But not doing that had been easier than he’d expected. It was almost exactly how they used to behave around each other, which Draco supposed made sense since they’d both liked one another for a little while. But they still bickered and hung out. Just now there was a lot of snogging involved, which had made it difficult to concentrate on mundane things like homework.
Harry snorted. “It is, pretty much. But it’s nice. Are students here in school for seven years also?”
Harry walks aimlessly around the castle, poking his head into forgotten classrooms or dusty hallways, gradually making his way to one of his favorite spots. It was quiet, secluded, and he’d come to think of it as his spot. He went there to think, and just to be somewhere by himself. Whenever he travels the corridors at night it always reminds him of being eleven years old again, wandering around under his father’s Invisibility Cloak. How he misses being so young, looking forward to the years ahead of him.
“Yeah, you did. I didn’t want to bother you.”
“I could work with you on it, if you want some extra practice,” offered Harry. Draco shot him a tentative smile.
“Goodnight.” Potter said softly from behind him, and Draco paused and looked over his shoulder.
“Is that why you planned this little alone time moment?” muttered Draco.
“Hey, you- this is all of my favorite foods and shit!” exclaimed Draco, giving Harry a surprised grin. Harry gave him a smile, suddenly glad for the dim lighting that concealed the flush on his cheeks.
“Wasn’t that the box for your mother?” he asked dryly, and Draco smiled sheepishly.
“I see,” said Narcissa, smiling gently. “I’m glad you two have overcome your differences.” Harry exhaled in relief while Andromeda nodded and smiled.
That’s what he’d said, how he’d felt. How he still felt. And when Draco had spoken French to him, he’d bloody loved it, loved the sound of the language. Loved that it was Draco’s voice in his ear.
“Gryffindor won?” exclaimed Draco indignantly. “Rubbish.”
“You can share mine,” Draco waved a hand benevolently, and she laughed.
“Yes, Madam Pomfrey told me that. I’m alright now, though.” he said, snagging a muffin and pouring himself tea. “No thanks to Finnegan.” Draco took a moment to glance down the table at the Irish boy and saw him sullenly picking at his food.
“I beat you just yesterday, Potty.” Draco retorted. It had been a close Seeker’s game; they’d both been half-frozen by the time Draco had grabbed the Snitch, Harry’s hand just behind his. “Shall we go up to Defense, then?” he continued airily when Harry muttered something under his breath.
“Go ahead, then. You need to think only of the memory, let it fill you up. Remember vividly how you felt.” he instructed, and Draco raised his wand.
“Will you just tell me what it’s about when you finish it?”
So Harry, with an inner prayer, channeled his inner Luna, who’s the friendliest person he knows. “Do you want to talk about it?” he asked, and Malfoy glanced at him again.
“Yes.” said Draco softly. “I’m fine.” It had shaken him when Harry had so openly broached the things that made up his nightmares, his foundation. But the most secret part of him had recognized the truth in Harry’s words. He’d been denying it for so long, convinced that what he was doing was the only way to pay for the past. And that he needed to pay for
“Yeah, it was horrendous.” Harry shook his head.
“She’s as smart as you. I think you two would be good friends if you didn’t dislike one another.” Now Blaise scoffed.
When their carriage pulled up to the front doors of Hogwarts, there’s no one outside.
“I doubt either of us knows how to work a chainsaw, Draco.”
“Harry,” said Teddy, sticking his thumb in his mouth, and Harry grinned even more. When he’d left in September Teddy hadn’t began talking yet.
“So tell me.” Daphne glanced at him. “What were the highlights of the little rivalry you two had? I never knew the full story, but it seemed like something was always happening with you two.” Harry smirked.
“I did not look lonely.” he answered, and he knew his tone was rather standoffish but he couldn’t help it.
“He didn’t have a clue for Hermione either. He just told me about the stargazing thing you two did and suggested I do an ‘experience’ instead of buying her something.” Weasley
“Thanks again.” replied Draco, and she smiled at him before sitting down. The two boys continued down the aisle to the eighth year table and sat across from Ron and Hermione.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, wanting to offer some comfort. He felt horrible now, for bringing this up again and again when it caused Draco so much pain to relive it. But at the same time, he was glad that Draco was talking about it and not bottling it up inside of him, letting the fear turn to self-loathing like he’d been doing before.
“Of course there’s dancing, but it’s more traditional. And you don’t have to, necessarily.” she explained. “It’s like that Yule Ball they held at the Triwizard Tournament, from what I’ve heard about that.”
“Now, I’m only telling you this because I think it’s time you two stop dancing around one other and figure out what you are to each other.” Daphne said firmly, and as she went on Harry could see a hint of Slytherin steel in her eyes. “But if you mess with him, if you hurt him, you can trust one hundred percent that I will hurt you, because Draco deserves to be loved unconditionally.”
Harry glanced at Draco in curiosity. Nott was his ex, so Harry wondered what Draco thought of him being here. Apparently not much, because Draco was draining his glass of Firewhisky with a blank expression on his face.
Harry said good night and trudged up the stairs to his dorm. It’s blessedly empty, and Harry snorted when he saw that Malfoy’s bed is green.
“Me either,” he said wryly. Andromeda had taken almost half an hour to make lunch because she had been asking him so many questions. It had been a little exasperating, but kind of sweet. Motherly, in a way.
Harry ate in the Great Hall with Ron, Hermione, and Neville, and he and Hermione head up early to the common room. Ron and Neville stay behind and join Dean and some of the other boys in a Quidditch discussion.
Draco gave a little sigh, and Harry figured he was asleep already. It was surprising how fast the Slytherin could fall asleep when he wanted too, considering he spent about half of his nights awake. Harry just gazed at what he could see of Draco’s face as he, too, became tired. His lips, the curve of his cheekbones. The bridge of his nose. He looked so innocent when he slept.
Draco stared at himself in the mirror. His dress robes looked alright, and he had managed to get his blond hair the way he wanted. His “hygiene stuff”, as Harry called it, seemed to have payed off, as his skin was clear and soft. Draco sighed.
“You didn’t cause their deaths, Harry.” The sound of his name on the other boy’s lips was startling, but oddly comforting. Welcome. Draco continued. “They made their own choices. Turned down their own paths. It’s not your fault.” Harry blinked fast. Draco’s words resonated, and Harry gave him a small smile.
When Harry arrived to Potions, he saw Daphne and Draco talking at his desk and went over to join them.
“Je t'aime. Dieu je t'aime,” said Draco softly.
“...Riley’s opens this weekend, we should definitely go,” announced Camille, and Harry groaned, while Simon and Amelie cheered on his other side.
“I never said it was, Daphne.” She looked at him, obviously expecting him to say more, and with a huff he did. “I guess- I don’t know. I know obviously they don’t like me because of how I treated them in the past, but it’s not like I want them in my life. I might not hate them, but that doesn’t mean all of a sudden I have to go to the opposite side of the spectrum and become best mates with them.”
But Merlin, he was filled to bursting with hope and joy, too. Because Harry liked him, Harry had gone stargazing with him, Harry had kissed him. It was so much more, so much better than Draco could’ve dared to dream of.
“For both of our sakes.” he remarked. Draco glanced to his left and saw Harry in conversation with Susan Bones, and didn’t know whether to feel relieved or stumped that Harry hadn’t heard his words. He supposed he should tell Harry he was gay, if only because they were good friends and he trusted the Gryffindor. Not to mention his little crush would
Draco exhaled and sent up a silent prayer.
“Thank you for telling me,” Harry murmured back softly, and Draco’s fingers laced through his in a silent reply. They sat like that, each taking comfort in the other, until the sky darkened to black and the stars began to glow.
And somewhere during all of these weeks, Draco had realized that he’d been, was, slowly falling in love.
“Honestly, I’m not that surprised.” said Hermione nonchalantly.
“Can I borrow your notes after class?” whispered Harry, and Draco spared a glance at him, eyes twinkling with amusement.
“Potter! Explain!” he said indignantly, but melted a bit when Harry turned another brilliant smile on him.
“It’ll be alright. You two will make it work.” said Draco rather awkwardly, and Harry had the sudden urge to smile, as Draco reminded him of Ron at this moment. They were both not quite in their element when trying to comfort crying people. Although Draco was better at it than Ron.
“Technically Snape taught us that in first year, Harry.” said Draco with a smirk. “And why were you drinking Polyjuice in second year?” he asked curiously.
“Come on.” persuaded Harry, and Draco rolled his eyes before the two of them walked back up to the school. As they entered Draco did find he was slightly unsteady on his feet, so privately he was a little relieved they’d returned inside. “Want to go to dinner?” offered Harry, and Draco shook his head.
The week passed rather quickly, in Draco’s opinion. When he’s not in classes, he’s spending time either by himself, wandering lonely parts of the school, or with Daphne, Blaise, and Pansy. He’s quickly becoming close with Daphne, and Draco admitted to himself that he’s glad she decided to befriend him.
“Hey.” replied Draco, and Daphne echoed him before smiling at them and going to join her desk partner.
“How’s your mum?” Harry asks as they reached the lake and stopped walking.
“Alright then, see you two later.” Hermione and Weasley left, and soon the common room was empty.
Harry and Draco and their friends left for lunch, before returning to Camille’s dorm. Harry, under Daphne’s tutelage, had given Draco two slightly sloppy French braids. Draco had grumbled and complained about the ends sticking up everywhere, but had left the braids in, which filled Harry with a warm feeling that made him rather smiley at lunch, something that Draco teased him about.
“Dislike is an interesting way of putting it. They bloody loathe one another.”
“Teddy’s sweet,” he replied. Draco sighed and shook his head. “What, you don’t like kids?”
“Yeah.” Weasley answered flatly as he directed a bishop. Draco frowned. Can Weasley even speak more than one syllable replies?
Draco gave him a small smile, somewhat reassured. They paused in front of the portrait to the eighth year common room and Harry kissed Draco’s forehead. Draco pressed his lips together to keep from smiling again.
“I liked yours too.” replied Draco softly, after a pause. They watched each other for a second, and Draco was the first to look away. “Goodnight, Harry.”
Before he entered the castle, he tilted his head back up at the starry night sky, looking for the familiar constellation that he’s named after. It didn’t take that long to find. He remembered years ago, when his mother would take him outside at night, spreading a blanket on the lawn and pointing out the stars for him. He allowed himself a small, secret smile. Then he went inside.
“That sounds really cool,” Amelie whispered to him. “I’ve never seen an Animagus.”
“No, it’s not, and no, you would not have,” responded Draco promptly as they sat down, and Harry hit his shoulder jokingly.
“Yeah, no shit, you prat.” Harry replied, jokingly shoving him. Draco shoved back. “I just meant, like, versus a full face of makeup.”
“He’s in a bad mood. I think he’s drunk, too.” Harry commented. “I’ll keep an eye out for him, alright? I’m just going to go outside for a little bit to clear my head.” He waved and went outside. It was so much better, the air was fresh and cold, clearing his head. Harry spent a few minutes outside, before heading back inside.
“Indeed they are, Ms. Granger. You will not have to do any catch-up work when you return. The material is the same. Now, I would like to remind you that tomorrow is the start of the student-teacher meetings. You would normally meet with your Head of House, but every eighth year will meet with me. The details of when will be on the notice board in the common room tomorrow morning.” And with that the Headmistress left, and there was a beat of silence before people began talking excitedly.
Hey everyone! Thanks so much again for all the love.
“He ran off somewhere.” replied Harry. Daphne excused herself and went to go look for him, and Harry almost joined her, but Amelie still had a hold of his hand and tugged him down into a seat. The lights were dim inside the club, and Harry frowned. “Wait, they use electricity here?”
“Now, that potion will take the pain down and then you have my permission to leave. You’ll get your schedule at breakfast.” Pomfrey sighed as she capped the potion bottle and cleared up. “Ms. Greengrass dropped in on you this morning after she and Mr. Potter brought you in last night.”
As they keep talking and bickering, Harry’s surprised to find that he likes hanging out with Malfoy when he’s like this. He felt like someone Harry could be friends with- he’s funny when he wants to be, as smart as Hermione, and he talked a lot, also like Hermione.
On Saturday morning, Draco slept fitfully, unable to get comfortable. Eventually he got up quietly, his light footsteps masked by the soft snoring coming from the other beds. He threw on a sweater and walked out of the school to the Owlery. It’s chilly, and the sky is still dark, in the time just before dawn. Draco could hear crickets chirping softly among the damp grass. The path up to the Owlery was rocky and steep, but Draco’s been up here so many times it didn’t bother him anymore.
“Yeah, they named a constellation after me. I’m that wonderful. You should aspire to be like me.” Harry chuckled. “Yeah, there is.”
“Yeah.”
“Nah, just more expensive.” responded Draco with a grin. He felt at ease, as he always did around Harry. Who was tapping his fingers relentlessly against the side of his thigh as they walked. “Why are you fidgeting again, Potter?”
“Well,” said Blaise. “As long as I don’t have to walk in on you two like we did with you and Theo, whatever floats your boat.” Draco snorted and Blaise went up to his dorm, patting Draco on the head, chuckling when Draco smacked his hand away with a growl.
“There’s a new password,” said Parvati Patil, coming up with her sister from behind them. “McGonagall told me, it’s ‘Fanged Geranium’.” The portrait swung open.
And now… now he recognized those emotions, he still felt them, but Harry was right. As usual. There was a better way to cope with it. He had to accept himself, accept his past, even if he was still ashamed of it. All of his past. Mistakes, fears, everything. He couldn’t change anything that happened, but he could make sure it didn’t happen again. So he had promised.
“Alright.” repeated Potter, a gleam in his eye.
“Look, there’s a table for the eighth years,” whispered Hermione in his ear, and Harry saw a smaller table up front, facing the House tables and below the professors table. A smattering of eighth years sat rather uncomfortably at their new table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione quickly make their way there, Harry determinedly ignoring the excited voices that surround him as he passed between the Hufflepuff and Gryffindor table, and after what seemed like an eternity of walking they made it to the eighth years and sat. He took a deep breath and squashed the anxiety stirring in his stomach from the crowds.
Draco dropped the knife. Fumbled for his wand and vanished it.
“Yes. After they cast the spell he passed out, but the Healers said it was just his lack of sleep and energy combined with the initial energy drainage from the spell. He’s just sleeping it off.” she said, and Harry exhaled a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.
She smiled. “Be careful.” Daphne whispered, and Draco chewed his lip absentmindedly.
“I don’t know. I mean, as long as it’s nothing like when we went to Riley’s.” said Draco, and Harry snickered.
“So they brought you up to the hospital wing, you were unconscious from the pain, I think. And the spell was still going on, they didn’t know how to stop it. You were in here for two days while they researched remedies, because nothing was working except one Pain-Relieving potion, but it didn’t get rid of all of the pain.” finished Ron.
“True. Harry Potter, the middle-aged man.” He snickered and Harry rolled his eyes with a smile. They were nearly at the spot where most of their fellow eighth years were fighting in the snow. It reminded him of that day at Beauxbatons, when they’d had a snowball fight, and Draco had fallen on him. He glanced over at Draco, who met his gaze with a rakish smile, his grey eyes bright and clear. He could tell Draco was remembering that day too.
“I can’t go on this trip, then.” commented Ron. “Mum would kill me if I missed Christmas, it’s too expensive to get a Portkey.”
“You just surprised me then,” he says, and Harry feels a little pang of relief. But Malfoy’s still waiting on Harry’s explanation.
“This place is amazing,” whispered Daphne as she came up next to Draco, and he glanced at her.
“Yeah.” Draco watched the phone in awe as the video plays, Daphne looking curiously over his shoulder. Suddenly the video ended and words popped up. Granger took the phone back. “Damn, lost the signal.” she said, and tucked it in her bag. “Well anyway, that’s what it looks like.” Draco’s buzzing with curiosity, both at the video and the phone, and began questioning Granger more about other things that Muggles can do.
“Umbridge,” responded Harry. “All those detentions I spent with her, she had this quill that wrote with your own blood.” Draco didn’t reply, but lifted Harry’s hand and kissed the scar gently, sending shivers down Harry’s spine.
The two are greeted by a cacophony of noise, as 9 year old's yell and chatter and send random things flying across the room, including each other. It’s wonderfully chaotic, and Harry has to smother a grin. Amelie sighed.
Daphne was listening intently, and some amusement had glimmered in her eyes but she sobered a bit at the mention of Voldemort. “So Draco runs off screaming and leaves me behind, and I was saved by a centaur.” Harry finished, and Daphne laughed.
“No, you’re a lovesick Slytherin who was staring into Harry’s eyes like there was no tomorrow.” cackled Daphne, and at Draco’s outraged sputters she darted into the classroom before he could catch her, her merry laugher echoing in the halls.
“Oh, you know what else I’m looking forward to now?” said Draco with an evil grin. Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Be more of a normal person.” finished Draco quietly, and there’s a silence.
Harry looked...beautiful. They’d done something to make his green eyes pop, and the overall effect was mesmerizing. The lack of glasses helped, too.
There was a realization he’d come to a couple minutes ago, a remembrance of the same kind of anger. But Harry pushed it down.
“Fine,” sniffed Daphne, but just like before, Draco could tell she hadn’t dropped the subject.
“Yeah, yeah. What do you think about that ball?” asked Harry, glancing quickly at the white envelope that lay on Draco’s bedside table. The Slytherin bit his lip, thankfully not noticing Harry’s stare. He looks so cute when he does that, thought Harry absentmindedly, before touching back down to reality and hastily stopping his staring.
And sing it did, about most of the usual things; the traits of the houses, the four founders. A song more like the first one Harry had ever heard, and less like the ones more recently, when the hat tried to advise the school. After a round of applause, the Headmistress opened a long roll of parchment and began to call forward the first-years.
“No, because when the laws are applied to all basic and advanced elemental charms you see that the second law is the most widely seen and….” Hermione began a long and windy explanation, but when she’s done, Malfoy embarked on an equally complicated tirade and soon the two of them are bickering back and forth. Harry and Ron are left in the dust, the fancy words flying in one ear and out the other.
“Thank you. For listening.” whispered Draco finally, and Harry nodded, a lump building in his throat because that broken look, the haunted shadow behind Draco’s eyes, it was fading. The knowledge that Harry had helped him like that...Harry was glad that he could. Did.
“How did you-” he stuttered, shock and panic reverberating through every bit of his body.
“Hey Weasley,” replied Draco, smirking.
So many little quirks and things he’d noticed and filed away about Malfoy. Harry kind of wanted to get to know him. Meet who he thought of as Draco, not Malfoy. In his mind they were almost separate people.
“He was making out with this boy named Theodore Nott in the Slytherin common room when all of Slytherin house walked in on them after dinner.” continued Daphne, raising her eyebrows. Draco leaned over the table and cuffed the back of her head, to everyone’s sniggers.
Harry pointed to the two broomsticks that he’d retrieved earlier that day from their spaces in the broomshed, and Draco smiled, looking as wondrous as any of the stars overhead.
“That wasn’t my fault,” said Harry exasperatedly, nudging Draco over so he could sit down next to him on the sofa. “Blame Ginny.”
“Maybe just to watch,” she answered him. “Flying isn’t my thing.”
Eventually they both slow down and fly a few laps to let the adrenaline off before Draco pulled his broom up next to Potter.
He thumbed through a nearby book, a small pang of satisfaction sweeping through him when he found what he needed and finished the sentence he was writing, tossing the quill upon the desk with a sigh. Just the conclusion, now, and then he could get started on the spell practice for Defense.
“Gryffindor won, but barely. Ginny and Demelza are still doing great, but the new Seeker isn’t up to your level. The Beaters are still doing good, and the new Keeper isn’t too bad.” Ron sighed.
“Now that wasn’t that horrible,” he said quietly to Harry. “I think you’ll still have less attention here than at Hogwarts.” Harry smiled slightly.
“Sorry.” He squeezed Draco’s hand gently. Draco turned his head away to hide his smile as they entered the castle again, making their way to the Great Hall. The murmur of far away conversation gradually grew louder as they approached, and when they entered there was a swell of noise.
“Alright. You know what to do.” Harry declared, and watched Draco inhaled calmly as he opened his eyes.
Once he’s onto Platform 9 ¾, he strode quickly to the train, giving no attention to those around him, even as they started to realize who was among them. Soon there was no one in front of him. No one wanted to be near a Malfoy. He sneered. Draco knew very well what was thought of him. He thought it himself.
“Yeah.” confirmed Draco. “Can you go get-”
Harry walks quickly away and down the hallway, making random turns until he found himself in front of his Charms classroom, a good distance away from Malfoy. He sits in a window alcove, his mind buzzing with his recent encounter.
“Oui, faisons-le!” exclaimed Camille, clapping her hands. Draco smiled, for once thinking about Potter, but solely wanting to beat him. Instead of talk to him, be near him, kiss him…Focus, you dummy, Draco scolded himself.
“Harry showed me the tattoo you did for him,” began Draco. “It’s beautiful.”
Harry stands and walks out of the dorm, closing the door behind him silently. His footsteps echo slightly as he made his way down the stairs and out into the halls of the school. It was quiet. The portraits that lined the walls had settled down for the night, a few of them snoring or snuffling in their slumber. Harry didn’t bother with a
“I guess it’s my Gryffindor optimism.” Harry says. Draco’s thumb brushes over his hand.
Harry and Ron share a look, but smiled. “Yeah, yeah ‘Mione. Night.”
“Draco, my darling, you’re already enrolled.” said Narcissa Malfoy, flourishing her wand at a pair of robes, which settled themselves on top of the contents of his trunk. “Besides, you don’t want to be stuck with your mother in house arrest, do you?”
“Can I do his eyeliner?” piped Daphne, and Camille nodded.
They spent an enjoyable Christmas morning with all of their friends, holed up in Camille and Amelie’s dorm, comparing presents and talking exuberantly.
When lunch is over, Harry shouldered his bag and quickly made his way down to the dungeons for Potions. As he entered the classroom, he’s pleasantly surprised to see it’s vastly different from when Snape occupied it. The room is brighter, and smelled less musty. The shelves that lined the walls held cauldrons, books, and ingredients, not the jars of preserved things that inhabited the shelves when Snape was professor.
“Yes.” Harry set down his trunk and ran his fingers through his hair. “This summer it’s been happening a lot.”
“Yes, but the way you were cutting, you would’ve chopped off a finger and not even noticed. I’ll finish.”
“Yes, we are.” Draco said, shaking his head at Harry and the girls. “Buggers.”
He’d deduced that in the past it had been easier to accept that Malfoy was horrible and not to think of why Malfoy was horrible. But now that Hermione had talked about it, he had made some conclusions of his own. Malfoy was influenced by his parents and the pureblood society who looked down on everyone else, then in sixth year, when he’d tried to kill Dumbledore, Voldemort would’ve killed him and his parents if he failed. He remembered what Malfoy had said to Dumbledore, up on the Astronomy Tower.
It was drizzling lightly when he stepped out into the courtyard that night. The moon was split exactly in half, one dark side, one white side. Soft footsteps come from behind him and then Draco’s next to him. By silent agreement they head to the lake, Harry touching his fingers to the stone of the memorial as they go by.
“Hermione,” began Sue Li, frowning at a book. “Does this say that Muggles can fly? In space?” Granger nodded with an amused expression.
“You just needed me as a teacher,” said Harry, kissing Draco quickly, and Draco smirked.
“What-” began Harry, confused, but Madam Pomfrey clucked her tongue at him.
“Quite good. You know, you have less Wrackspurts around your head than you did before.” Harry smiled bemusedly. “Well, this is me.” said Luna, gesturing to a spot at the Ravenclaw table. “Goodbye.”
“You didn’t see anyone, down at the pitch?” asked Harry as they walked through the doors. Harry took out his wand and locked the front doors. Probably so if the would-be killer was behind them, they couldn’t just stroll in after them.
“Brilliant,” said Harry. Eating in the common room with the three people he cared for the most sounded vastly better than going into the Great Hall. Whatever he’d said to Draco, he was still slightly reluctant to enter back into the student body. Of course like he’d said, it wasn’t going to scare him into breaking up with Draco or anything like that, but it would not be enjoyable to deal with all of the hostility. But he would. He would, over and over, as long as he could stay with Draco.
Half an hour later Draco was back in the carriage with everyone except Harry, who’s absence was one Draco felt greatly. It had started to rain, and Draco thought listlessly that the weather was reflecting his mood.
Draco and Potter said their goodbyes to Weasley and Hermione before heading up to their dormitory. Everyone else seemed to already be asleep, so the two were as quiet as they could be as they stowed away brooms and changed. Draco finished brushing his teeth in the bathroom, which is lit only the the moonlight streaming in from a window, and turned to leave.
“No. I don’t really care about him being here. I’m fine.” And with that Draco stood up and left the table, Harry frowning after him.
Draco sat up, gazing around the blue and white room and all of their belongings scattered haphazardly about it. Robes, spellbooks, a few quills. Mostly Harry’s things, his own were a touch neater.
“His words, not mine.” Daphne turned into the classroom and Draco trudged along behind her and sat down at a desk in a swish of robes. She sat down next to him and took out her books and quill, then huffed.
him, I’ll play, because Potter’s absolute shit at chess.” Potter raised his eyebrows at Draco from behind Weasley, and Draco lifted his own. “Don’t look at me like that Potter, you know it’s true.” Hermione snorted, and Weasley eyed Draco for a bit.
They stayed like that for a long while, sitting in a comfortable silence as Harry looked out the window, Draco’s comforting presence in front of him. The gardens were quiet, starlit, and it looked as though the meteor shower had finally stopped. The moon was a glowing crescent in the sky, it’s soft white light washing over the grounds. Harry smiled at the memory of the shooting stars. It had been beautiful.
Potter. Draco turned away from the window and rested his head on the seat. He had enough on his mind already without the darling of the Wizarding World intruding on his thoughts.
“Got it.” replied Harry, picking up the stirring stick. “Ten counter clockwise… ten clockwise…” Draco rubbed his eyes and closed a few jars.
“It’s snowing!”
“Fanged Geranium.” Harry said, with a little smile at Draco that made his heart- well, both of their hearts- beat a little faster. Harry smirked like he knew why as they went through the common room, and Draco blushed even more, trying furiously not to.
“We get you food!” they said, and ran off.
Harry gazed at Draco, somewhat at a loss for words. Draco was wrong about that, Harry knew that much, but how could he make Draco see that?
He reached the eighth year table and dropped down smoothly next to Daphne at one end.
“Those too.” he responds. They head back up to the castle.
“How absurd.” Draco muttered. “I’m not tickling the pear. That’s weird.” He wrinkled his nose and Harry sighed when Draco didn’t move, then lifted his own hand and tickled the pear. The pear started giggling and as Draco watched the painting swung open, revealing a stone passage from which came a blast of hot air, smelling of food.
“What?” he said vaguely, looking up at Hermione and getting the impression that he’d missed something she’d said while being lost in his thoughts.
“Yes, but I haven’t settled on anything. I figured not everywhere will take me.” he responded, his voice getting quieter at the end. He shifted in his chair. It’s ironic that Draco’s
“Just out.” Blaise opened his mouth to question more, but Pansy put a hand on his arm.
“What are you- oh, hey Daphne.” said Harry. “What is it?”
Ten minutes later people began trickling out, and Camille and Simon rounded up all of the Hogwarts students.
“What’s that?” said Draco suddenly, eyes on Harry’s collar, and Harry followed the other boy’s gaze down to his left shoulder, where a tattooed wing was peeking out of the shirt.
“Stop watching me.” Draco insisted, and Harry noticed a blush rising in his pale cheeks. He grinned.
Five hours later he was in the Gryffindor common room with Hermione, Ron, and Dean, as eighth years still had access to their respective house common rooms, even though their dorms were no longer nearby. Harry was thinking about Malfoy, Hermione was reading a newspaper, and the other two boys were engaged in a loud game of wizards chess. (Hermione had scolded Ron thoroughly for swearing colorfully in front of a group of second years when Dean had taken both his rooks)
“Yes, see? Camille and Amelie are already out there,” said Daphne, pointing to the two girls moving gracefully over the ice, farther out on the lake. Draco glanced at Harry, who was lacing up his skates.
“Yes.” Draco answered. Harry waited, but this time Draco stayed silent.
“Yeah, an essay.” he muttered. He wasn’t looking forward to this.
“But you did help,” Harry whispered gently. “You helped Luna, you gave her food and things. And you helped me when I got captured.” Draco shook his head.
“Don’t tell me what to do,” Draco murmured drowsily, and Harry smiled.
thought Draco with relief.
“Sounds very medieval,” she responded.
“Why the hell do you need slippers?” Harry scoffed.
Draco looked around and saw that an abnormally large, stately woman was making her way towards the group of students. Madam Maxime, he recognized her from the Triwizard tournament fourth year. Camille gave the two of them one last smile and a wave before heading to her side.
Five minutes later Harry had paid for a carriage and the two of them were tucked away inside of it as it trundled up towards Beauxbatons. Harry was grateful that the inside of the carriage was toasty and warm, letting no hint of the chill outside seep in. Draco was on the seat opposite him, legs tucked up on the seat with his knees against his chest, nibbling at a box of chocolates as he stared out the window. Harry leaned forward and snagged a chocolate, grinning at Draco’s small noise of outrage.
“Yeah, yeah.” replied Ron with a small grin. “Hey- I was thinking of going flying tonight. Anyone up for it?”
“Hey, Hermione, Harry, why are you- oh.” All three of them look round at the portrait hole, where Weasley had just stepped into the common room. His eyes narrow a bit at the sight of Draco, and Draco subtly grabbed his wand. He didn’t need a repeat of Finnegan.
“Nice look,” she teased gently. “And it’ll be alright. You two are close, one night won’t ruin that friendship. Trust me.” Draco let himself be soothed by her words, hoping desperately that they were true.
“You both die,” finished Hermione seriously, and Harry was silent.
“Probably not. The Yule Ball went on for ages.” said Harry with a grimace, and Draco laughed. Harry was still struck with a little sensation of awe every time Draco laughed, because it was so surreal that Harry had caused him to do that. Make him happy.
Harry felt a small wave of relief that Draco was acknowledging it, and tightened his arms around Draco briefly, letting him know he’s there for him.
Three hours later Draco had bought an ornate bracelet for Pansy, who loved anything and everything flashy, and a billowy blue scarf for his mother, as well as a box of chocolate caramels from a place she was particularly fond of. He then had found a twisty abstract, green and gold-tinged piece of glasswork for Blaise, who had a collection of glasswork, and at a Quidditch supply shop he bought Weasley some good Keeper’s gloves, as Weasley’s were a bit frayed and worn. For Daphne he purchased a little silver charm necklace and some new quills, Camille a cashmere sweater she’d been mooning over, and Simon a pot of broom wax and a book of poems, because Draco had spent one memorable afternoon with him where he’d discovered the French boy’s fondness for poetry.
“Shall we go down to lunch, then?” Draco said poshly, and Harry chuckled.
“No, you don’t have to do that,” he started, but she tilted her head.
“We should’ve kissed that day,” mused Draco, and Harry grinned. He’d wanted to, he remembered that much. The rest of the memory from that day was mostly a blur- warm skin, cold snow, how beautiful Draco had looked. Just like he did now.
“We have to share with all the other eighth years, though.” muttered Seamus in response. “I don’t fancy sleeping with Slytherins nearby.”
“What did he say?” asked Daphne, coming over from the window. Draco sat up and stared Amelie down, but she kept going anyway.
But he wasn’t sure.
“Alright. Oh, and I’m writing back to Camille and everyone tonight, if you want to add your bit to the letter.” Draco said as they stopped in front of the portrait that led into the eighth year common room. “Fanged Geranium.” Draco added, with a note of distaste in his voice, and the portrait swung open.
“What?” he asked flatly, and Harry sighed. Draco was in a mood, for some reason.
The carriage rolled to a stop, and they all spilled out, heading inside. Draco slowly uncurled and he and Daphne followed, saying good night to the other three as they walked to the exchange student’s dorms. The halls were relatively quiet, it was late. Draco was silent as they stopped in front of the closed door of his room. Daphne squeezed his hand, a comforting gesture that, while appreciated, did nothing to quell his anxiety. His breathing was getting shallow.
“Don’t you want them to know you’ve changed? That you aren’t the brat they see you as?”
“Tattoo.” replied Harry. “Luna did it for me. It’s my owl, Hedwig.” He moved the shirt down a bit so Draco could lay eyes on the simple tattoo, an owl inked simply in black, on Harry’s left shoulder blade. The outstretched wing curved up over his shoulder.
“You look cute!”
“We wanted to watch the stars, there was a meteor shower.” lied Draco, and Harry was glad that Draco was better at it than Harry himself was. Once they said good night to Hermione and Ron, Harry and Draco tramped up the stairs to the dormitory. Harry yawned before getting into bed, and fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.
“Dragon claw? Let me see. You’ll be wanting NEWT Level Animal Potions Ingredients. That book has the best collection of creature potions knowledge, although there are other books with tidbits of information here and there. Ah, but someone’s got it. That young man over there.” She pointed at a far table, and Harry saw the back of Malfoy’s blond head. He sighed.
“Yeah, I know,” he said absentmindedly.
First of all thank you so much for the love! I will try to post every 1-3 days. For this chapter there is a TW for implied self harm.
“You must be Mr. Potter.” Harry spun and saw a young, dark-haired black woman sitting at Snape’s old desk. She had a faint Aussie accent, and he vaguely remembered someone
“What about you two?” Camille looked at Draco, then Harry, and Draco swapped a look with the Gryffindor.
“Daphne?” Granger stood behind them. “Why is he here?” Draco saw Potter and Weasley sitting next to Sue Li and Padma Patil behind the bushy-haired girl. This keeps getting bloody worse, thought Draco in disgust.
“Good morning, Professor Flitwick.” greeted Hermione as they take their seats.
Draco raised his hand and slapped him across the face.
“Hey- Harry!” Hermione appeared out of the haze on the platform and wrapped Harry in a tight hug, which he returned.
“Yeah. I must’ve forgotten to take my dose.” came a soft reply. Draco glanced toward the bedside table. Sure enough, the bottle of Dreamless Sleep sat untouched, no cup nearby.
The next few minutes were filled with the crinkling sound of wrapping paper being torn and tossed away, and various clunking noises.
“Oh, here comes McGonagall with the schedules.” said Daphne as the Headmistress strode up to the eighth year table.
Honestly, of course he was mad about this. But he understood why. Not that that made it alright, but… he understood. Many of the students here saw him as, well, evil. A Death Eater. They had good reason too, especially when they thought he was corrupting their golden boy.
“It’s not because of you.” Harry replied as the staircase settled into place, and they walked up the remainder of it into another hallway. “It doesn’t matter what they think, it doesn’t concern them. I care about what you think. Not them. And trust me, I’ve dealt with shit before.” he continued. “Remember second year? Fourth year?”
Harry clenched his jaw and looked away, rummaging through his trunk just for something to do. Merlin, this was difficult.
“Yeah.”
“God, he was a self-obsessed ninny.”
“No.” came Harry’s quiet reply. “But why are you up again? You’ve been tired this whole week. You should sleep more.”
“No problem.” She gave him a small, subdued smile and Harry and Daphne walked down the empty halls to the Hospital Wing. It’s dimly lit, with only the flickering torches on the wall providing light. The windows that they pass show the dark mass of the Forbidden Forest, and Harry can just barely make out Hagrid’s hut at the border of the forest
They were walking down to the Great Hall, and since it was relatively early for lunch the hallways were clear. Harry didn’t think he would notice even if the whole student body of Hogwarts were shouting at him right now, because all that was on his mind was the boy walking next to him. His boyfriend. Draco. Merlin.
“Draco!” Harry exclaimed, chucking a ball of wadded-up wrapping paper at him.
“Very good, Mr. Malfoy.” The professor gave him an approving nod and vanished the bandages and splint from Daphne’s leg before moving on.
“Alright, Mr. Potter. One last vitals check and you’re good to go.” said Madam Pomfrey, bustling over. Harry nodded and she waved and flicked her wand, nodding in approval as a blue light seemed to glow from Harry’s chest, and Draco’s as well. Draco touched the spot where the light was emitting from. It was a little cold. “That’s because you two are linked, dear.” explained Madam Pomfrey, and Draco nodded.
“Please don’t use up all the hot water,” called Harry, banging on the door. He heard Draco snicker.
Honestly, Draco didn’t really mind. Inwardly he kind of liked it, but it would ruin his reputation if word got out that Draco Malfoy was letting Harry Potter call him love.
“So what do you think Hermione would like?”
“A dance club. It’s so much fun to get dressed up and go dance, and they have great nachos too.” Simon said. “Last time we went Camille got rip-roaring drunk and-” Camille smacked him before he could finish the sentence.
“Not the ones I know. If we eat outside it’s still a fancy thing, and definitely no one sits on the grass.” replied Draco. Harry chuckled, and for a while the two boys ate, watching the stars come out above them.
“I like them,” replied Harry, fingers moving over the familiar wire frame as he walked out of the dorm. He turned to see Draco hesitating at the doorframe to the staircase, and Harry thought he understood why. Leaving the dorm meant leaving the safety net of the room, of their honest conversation. It meant going back out into the world.
“Yeah, alright.” he responded amicably, and they walked in an easy silence toward one of the doors that would let them out into the gardens. Harry caught Draco eyeing him a couple of times.
“Yeah, alright.” he sighed finally, brushing strands of his hair out of his eyes, before looking up and meeting Harry’s gaze. There was something… different in his eyes now. Something more intense, but Draco couldn’t place it.
“Nothing, actually.” said Harry conversationally, and kept walking, tugging Draco along with him. Draco glanced back once to see the two students looking after them and muttering to each other. I knew this would happen, thought Draco.
“And how many Gryffindors?” asked Harry, humouring him as they stepped out of the shop into the brisk, cold air. Draco tilted his head.
Class ended and the two are still debating. Blaise has to shake Malfoy’s shoulder to make him stop.
“I don’t know, really. Remus and Sirius never explained.” Potter answered quietly. He looked sad, and Draco remembered that he had been close to the two men.
“Mm.” said Draco.
“Come along, Draco,” called his mother, snapping him back to the present. He walked to her side and glimpsed the outside lawn, to the Aurors waiting under a gray sky to bring him to the school train. He felt a great dislike for them, for the shame of being walked to the train like a dog. But he was Draco Malfoy, ex Death Eater, and of course could not be trusted out of house arrest by himself. Narcissa set down his trunk and gave him a quick hug and a kiss on the cheek. “I’ll see you at Christmas, darling.”
“Harry, you’ll be shadowing Amelie, she’s over there.” Camille waved to a pretty Asian girl sitting at another table, and she waved back. Harry nodded, but gaped when Draco stole his bacon.
“Oh- er- Harry’s fine.” he said tentatively, and she smiled.
“I’m fine,” he insisted, but his voice sounded quavery, even to his own ears. Harry gave him a knowing look and handed him his wand. He must’ve dropped it.
“And how’s Buckbeak?” chimed in Hermione.
“...it’s Harry Potter…”
“Why do you?”
“Yes.” agreed Draco. “Now, though, I mainly just dislike her out of habit. Like Potter and Weasley.”
“Hell yeah. I ordered my new dress robes a week ago.”
kiss, hold each other. That would be annoying.
“Can we go shopping first? I didn’t bring any good clothes for this,” he said.
“Yeah, for you,” Draco shot back. “Is this your one skill, then? Ice skating? Seems a bit depressing to me.” Harry raised his eyebrows, seemingly amused.
“Yeah,” said Harry vaguely, staring at the way Draco’s hair glowed in the sunlight from the windows. He was so beautiful it took Harry’s breath away.
“My Transfiguration teacher was one- her form was a cat. And my godfather’s was a black dog. My dad’s was a stag, like my Patronus.” replied Harry.
“I know that, Ron. I’m just curious as to if he’s changed at all.”
Draco was surprised when Potter burst out laughing, the bright sound filling up the room. And even more surprised that he felt
“Only if you do.” said Harry, and Draco rolled his eyes.
“Sorry for trying to curse you with an unforgivable,” he replied, and they grinned at each other. Harry sighed, glad that they had talked. He felt better, and he couldn’t speak for Draco but he thought the other boy was a little better as well. Now that they’d confessed to each other, Harry felt comfortable with Draco like he was with Ron or Hermione. They separate, and sat in easy silence.
“Everything except for my sweater that you have on. But if you’re going to wear it today that’s fine.” he replied amicably, feeling in a benevolent sort of mood. Harry smirked, nodding. He began to pack.
“Yeah.” replied Draco. “After that we only have a month left.”
“Hey,” he said, looping the strap of his bag over his chair. There was already a cauldron of what Harry assumed was a not-completed brew of Amortentia, softly simmering away.
“You’re one to talk.” said Harry with amusement, and Draco scoffed. He set down his coffee and pressed his lips to Harry’s, smirking against his mouth when Harry pulled him onto his lap. Draco broke away and began kissing the sensitive spot he’d found yesterday, below Harry’s ear, and Harry made a noise low in his throat and forced Draco’s face back up to his, kissing him deeply.
“My dad.” answered Potter. “And Sirius, Remus, and Peter Pettigrew. While they were at school they made it, and Fred and George found it in Filch’s office. They gave it to me third year, but I didn’t know who’d made it at the time.” Draco unfolded the map, perusing the footprints and names floating on the paper as he took in this information.
Falling in love with the messy-haired, green eyed Gryffindor. With the boy who’d patiently put up with his moods, who’d extended a hand of friendship and put the past behind them. With the boy who was nice and funny and compassionate and understood him, who accepted him as who he was. Who helped him when he’d fallen and who was a brilliant Seeker, the person who could always brighten Draco’s mood. Someone Draco trusted, cared for, truly enjoyed being around.
“Sorry about that. It was pretty horrible.”
But what he didn’t expect was for Harry to grab his arm and take Draco down with him. Draco fell on top of Harry, their legs tangling together, faces centimeters away. Draco’s hands were braced on Harry’s chest, and they blinked at each other.
“Doubt it.” he replied. Daphne took his hand, and he turned his head away from her knowing eyes. “Shut up.”
He turns into one of the rooms, his hand still on the wall. It was his favorite spot to hide away, one of many unused rooms forgotten in the bowels of the castle. It was the room where the Mirror of Erised had resided for a brief while in his first year, and Harry had stumbled across it. It was no different than the many other classrooms, but he came here anyway.
“I should have known.” he remarked. Daphne sat on one of the purple sofas, but bounded up and goes over to him.
“No,” said Draco. “I take it you didn’t either.” Harry nodded, his jaw set. Draco sighed.
“Hello, Ms. Granger!” he replied squeakily. The rest of the class streamed in through the door, and Harry’s eyes are drawn to Malfoy when he enters, trailed by Blaise Zabini. They sat across from Harry and Ron. “Good morning to you all! Today we will be taking notes on and debating the properties of Healow’s 4 Laws for elemental charms. Now, if…” Harry quickly stopped understanding any of the words coming out of the professor’s mouth, and Ron leaned over to whisper in his ear.
“Yeah, it would be wonderful if it snowed.” she agreed. Harry nodded, sitting in the armchair again, Draco laying on the floor, reading that book he’d gotten from Camille. Simon was out getting Daphne hot chocolate from the dining hall. Camille smirked and joined Draco on the floor.
“Hermione!” Harry replied, hugging her back as much as he could. She finally loosened her grip on them and stepped back to see them, beaming. Ron walked up behind her, grinning.
“Yes, it was fine.” Draco muttered. That stupid smile was still on his face, and it wouldn’t go away.
The inside of the chateau was much like the outside, mused Draco. Elegant and simple, but clearly decorated by someone with taste. The dining hall was much the same, adorned with crystal chandeliers instead of floating candles, like Hogwarts. The tables were also wood, but polished and smooth. A choir of wood nymphs was singing softly.
Draco pushed himself more upright with the hand on Harry’s chest so he could see Harry’s face. He looked quite shocked.
“Potter, Malfoy, welcome back.” said Headmistress McGonagall, striding over to them in her pointed witch’s hat. Harry greeted her, and Draco murmured a hello. “You all are exempt from morning classes, go ahead to your common room. Your things are already in your dorms. You will be expected at afternoon classes.” she continued, and they nodded before leaving the Great Hall with a few other exchange students.
“You wouldn’t have dated me if I had toad eyes,” Harry said, his eyes twinkling.
“Well? Fucking kiss me like you mean it, Potter.” he demanded, and Harry grinned wickedly before doing just that.
“You have ink on your hands,” Harry says rather pointlessly, grasping for something to say. Malfoy glances down at his hands before looking up again.
“Yes, though we sit our exams after six years of study. And from what I can tell we have a lot of the same core classes, like Charms and Transfiguration. Hogwarts doesn’t have programs for the sixth and seventh years like we do here, oui?”
“Yeah, she said about as much over the summer. Mum was a bit disappointed, but Ginny started seeing Dean again and brought him ‘round and Mum likes him too. Mostly because he let her fill up his plate as much as she wanted.” added Ron.
“Why the fuck is he writing to you? Have you been writing to-”
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” Potter said, and Draco’s eyebrows furrowed.
Harry had wanted to bring it up to Malfoy, because he was curious about the sudden fascination with Muggles. The Slytherin had insulted the non-magic people loads of times, called Hermione Mudblood because she was Muggleborn, yet now was drinking down information on muggle technology? Hermione had agreed that it had shocked her, but that it was another example of how he had changed.
“Good morning, Mr. Malfoy.” said McGonagall, and gestured to a chair in front of her desk. The room is filled with bits and bobs and oddities, although Draco could see a large bird stand adjacent to the ornate wooden desk that seemed actually in use, red feathers laying randomly at the base of it.
“Lumos,” Harry said, and in the resulting glow peered at the Map again. Malfoy’s name on the Map was almost in the forest, for Merlin’s sake. Harry let out a great sigh but walked forward into the darkness that surrounded the castle, once the torches that adorned the front door were out of sight. His wand was the only glow, and the night was surprisingly quiet as Harry tramped down the grassy hill, seeing the faint shine of the lake beyond him.
Harry bolted upright, panting hard. He could feel sweat beading on his brow, and he’s glad for the curtains around his bed so no one will see him like this. It’s pitch-dark, and he could hear the soft breathing of the other boys, asleep around him. Harry sighed quietly and pulled his knees to his chest. He knew sleep would not return to him that night. So he lay awake and watched the shadows flicker on the ceiling.
“They did all that without magic?” he said, his disbelief giving way to curiosity.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Did Ron ask you for romantic advice today? He did for me,” said Harry, and Draco rolled his eyes.
Considering all of the students in the hall, there’s a great deal of interest as to why the Savior of the Wizarding World is walking around with an ex- Death Eater. People whisper and stare, but Harry’s used to it, even though some people look a little hostile at the sight of Malfoy. Harry turned into the library, and Malfoy’s right behind him.
“Hey, Harry.” said Neville, and Dean and Seamus chimed in with greetings as well. Harry said hello and looked down the table. Aside from Neville, Dean, and Seamus, he saw Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott; Micheal Corner, Parvati and Padma Patil, Sue Li, Terry Boot, and Susan Bones. At the opposite end of the table was a group of Slytherins- Daphne Greengrass, Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, and slightly apart from them, Malfoy.
Harry strolled down the hill with Draco, taking immense pleasure in the fact that they were holding hands, Harry’s fingers curling around Draco’s. It might seem very plain, compared to all the kissing they’d just done, but it was something couples did, wasn’t it? It made Harry feel warm inside, at the thought.
“I’m not laughing at you, it’s just I always forget that wizards don’t know anything about Muggles. A video’s like a sort of moving portrait, but it’s a scene from the past that’s recorded on Muggle technology. Let me see if I can get a signal in here.” Granger fished in her bag and took out a small, very slim black box. She pressed a button, and one side of the box lit up.
“Harry, dear, are you ready to leave?” Andromeda Tonks addressed the lone figure standing by the window, idly making smoke rings with his wand as he gazed at the waving grasses behind the house.
But he shoved these thoughts aside and managed a grin as Daphne began chattering away and they eat.
“Coming?” Malfoy seemed a little closed off again. He shook his head.
Harry grinned again. “Yeah.” he said, entirely too pleased with himself. Draco sniffed daintily in response, but he knew Harry could tell that he didn’t mind. And he didn’t mind either when Harry kissed him long and slow, warming Draco from head to toe, and making Daphne and Camille hoot at them from across the ice.
“I’m better than Weasley, Potter. You, on the other hand, are bloody horrible at this.”
Harry sighs and leaned his head against the cool stone. He’s been trying not to think of Malfoy, but the more he forces himself not to, the more he does. He couldn’t help it. He knew it was probably a bad idea…
Hagrid nodded wisely. “Thas’ good. Reckon that was appreciated after all of last year.” Harry smiled.
“Mr. Malfoy, you can pair with Ms.Granger. Ms. Greengrass, please pair with Mr.Potter.”
I shouldn’t be here, Draco thought to himself in despair. He didn’t fit in among the students. He’s a horrible person, for fuck’s sake, he tried to murder a man! And he’s responsible for so many deaths, so much pain, he’s tortured people! He never stood up to the Dark Lord, never did anything more than sneak Lovegood some food and salve.
Because this feeling, this anger, possessiveness… this was what he had felt when he’d seen Dean kissing Ginny, two years ago. Except this time...this time it was stronger.
“Not really.” Draco shrugged. “Just make me look hotter than Harry.” Camille and Daphne laughed.
Besides, the nightmares had plagued him all summer, and he’d began taking Dreamless Sleep every single night. It did work, but he always woke more tired that before, the dark shadows under his eyes more pronounced. So he’d stopped bothering with it. Even if he didn’t visually see the nightmares, the memories, they were always there. At the edge of his thoughts.
“Are they dating or something?” asked Harry vaguely, still watching Daphne and Malfoy, who appeared to be being scolded by the blond girl.
At first Malfoy was a little withdrawn and snappish; Harry figured it’s the fact that so many people are around them and subtly (or not) watching them, all curious as to why the Golden Trio is eating dinner with the Prince of Slytherin, ex Death Eater. But Hermione and Harry, by silent agreement, engage him in a constant stream of chatter, and soon Malfoy opened back up again.
“For what?” asked Draco, a little amused, but curious as to what had made the Gryffindor so jumpy for the past week. Harry coughed a little.
“That is you, Harry, right?” came Draco’s voice from the bathroom. “Not some Muggle with a chainsaw?” Harry chuckled, sitting on his bed.
“What?” Draco snapped, remembering too late his promise to himself that he wouldn’t antagonize the other boy.
“I’m so tired. That Potions essay drained my brain.”
“Yeah, could we?” Draco mirrored Harry and dangled his legs off of the bed, one hand moving up to swipe his blond hair to the side. Harry nodded agreement and stood, adjusting his glasses. Draco snorted. “Those glasses are hideous, you know.”
“Do you- want to talk about it?” Draco asked, and his grey eyes turned and met Harry’s.
“Oh. Thanks for telling me. About the potion too, last month.” came Harry’s voice after a pause. “I didn’t wake you up, did I?”
They left their dorm and went down to lunch, falling back into their bickering habits on the way there, quarreling over Quidditch teams.
“Well, Harry, I don’t think that-” Granger cut off her words as she spotted him over Weasley’s shoulder, and they all turned around to face him. Weasley scowled at him, and Granger had her lips drawn together and her arms crossed, and Potter was obviously attempting to school his face into neutrality.
“Alright. Thank you, Headmistress.” It was slightly embarrassing, thought Harry, having his teacher Apparate him, but the alternative was Floo and Harry couldn’t do that. It almost reminded him of Apparating with Dumbledore, back in sixth year. He smiled a little at the memory of Dumbledore and McGonagall put a hand on his shoulder. Soon Harry felt the gut-wrenching twist of Apparation and his vision whirled, until they rematerialized at Beauxbatons.
It had been intoxicating, to be that close to him. Close enough to count every eyelash, every crease in his lower lip. They’d stared at each other, and Harry had been physically unable to look away, the other boy had mesmerized him.
Harry sighs, forcefully dragging his thoughts away from thoughts of the dead. He’s grieved over the summer, and the fall and winter months. Now it was February, and he was still grieving. Just more quietly. He’s grown tired too many times of people telling him to sleep, to take this or that potion, to go rest. Treating him as something fragile. It irks him.
“Bugger off.”
“Why are you carrying that for them?” he asked, and Simon smiled.
“Twenty minutes, so don’t take too long.” answered Harry, back to Draco as he sorted through his trunk. Draco made a noise of agreement before slipping into the bathroom and closing the door quietly behind him, leaning up against it and tipping his head back. I need to get myself back under control, he thought fiercely. Act normal.
“So what was that book about?” asked Harry, and Draco rolled his eyes.
“What do you remember from your childhood?” he asked curiously, and Draco’s face took on a pensive look.
Harry and Draco tugged their trunks out of their room and into the hallway, where their luggage joined the pile of trunks from the other Hogwarts students on one side of the hallway. Harry lingered by their dorm door, eyes skimming over the familiar features of the room, remembering memories in the dorm room with a nostalgic smile. Late night talks, kissing, cuddling. Falling asleep together, just sleeping together. Draco helping Harry with homework. Small, everyday things that blurred into each other, but that Harry remembered fondly nonetheless.
“How do you know?” Draco replied, amused.
“Colovaria,” he said, flourishing his wand, and the sheets deepen to an emerald green. He then transfigured them into silk, and admired his handiwork for a moment before leaving the room and heading down the stairs to the Great Hall.
Draco stilled beneath Harry’s fingertips, his shoulders hunching up defensively.
Draco’s lips parted and Harry ran his tongue along his bottom lip. He still tasted like mint, just like in his dream. Draco was arching up off the the ground, pressing against him, and Harry could still feel Draco’s heartbeat, reverberating through his own chest.
“What does that mean? It’s Latin, right?” asked Harry, vaguely curious.
“So,” commented Draco nonchalantly. “Why did Potter tag along with you last night to bring me to the hospital wing, exactly?” A trace of amusement flashed across Daphne’s face.
“So,” began Potter after ten minutes of silence, sweeping a hand through his dark hair, “You’re going to France?”
“Exactly,” Simon grinned at him, and Harry realized he must’ve spoken out loud. They took the drinks and threaded through the edge of the crowd back to the table.
Draco turned around and saw Theo, leaning beside him at the bar. For the past hour he’d been skulking on the outskirts of the club, trying to stay out of people’s way. Also to avoid Harry, and Theo. Harry because he didn’t want to fuck up any more, and Theo because Theo.. Theo was still looking at him like he’d done in sixth year, and Draco didn’t like him like that anymore.
“How’ve you been, Hagrid?”
“A notice should appear in your common room two weeks from now. And finally, before we go to your common room, I have an important announcement.”
“Because I hate to see you hating yourself.” said Harry softly, feeling Draco’s heartbeat increase. Though from anger, or annoyance, or something else, Harry couldn’t tell. Their bodies might have been magically linked, but their minds and emotions were not.
“Ooch, scandalous.” Draco interrupted with a smirk.
“True. But it’s better than what you had before.”
Maybe he’ll initiate something… but Daphne didn’t seem to think that was likely, if she told me Draco liked me back. She seemed to think I’d have to make the first move.
But the thing that scared him the most is that he still wanted to confide in someone, even now. He wanted someone to comfort him, to understand him, to tell him it’s alright. His mother stopped doing that a long time ago, but Draco missed it. Tears seep down his cheeks and he swiped at them, disgusted with himself for crying like a weakling. He’s shaking. The longing and anger and disgust sweep through him, leaving him empty, alone.
“But….” prompted Draco.
“That’ll take hours.” Harry protested, then was struck by an idea. “Would you let me carry you? It’ll be a lot faster.” Malfoy opened his mouth to protest, but Harry kept going. “You know you can’t walk up there, even if we braced your foot. I’ll even ask you less questions if we can just go inside.” he cajoled. Malfoy huffed.
“That was nice of McGonagall,” he whispered, his lips brushing Harry’s ear. Harry shivered a little at the sensation. Kissing will have to wait, though. This is not the place for it, he thought resolutely.
“Yes, well.” said Daphne hastily, as Pansy had opened her mouth, most likely to aim some insult at Hermione. “Sorry we couldn’t be of more help. You aren’t leaving him alone, are you?” she added. “You’re staying with him around school?”
He had been pondering getting his own place, since he would be graduating soon enough, but then he had gotten a second invitation- from the grandmother of his godson, Teddy Lupin.
“Indeed,” said Draco, and grabbed Pansy’s bacon.
Another thing Draco’s come to love is the Healer program. The first time they interned at the nearby magical hospital, he was a hesitant mess of nerves. But now with three trips down, he’s looking forward to the next one, and enjoyed all of his classes. Enjoyed learning new spells, brewing new potions, even studying past cases and remedies. It warmed him up from the inside that learning all of this could help people, could save lives. Make a difference in the best way.
“Hurry up, I’m dying over here!” yelled Daphne as she dove away from another snowball, and with a sigh and a glance at the starry heavens Draco ran to go help her.
Draco looked around and saw Daphne standing beside his chair, a concerned expression on his face. He swallowed.
“No,” he replied snidely, and Harry chuckled, his hands moving to Draco’s neck and drawing him back down and pressing their lips together. Draco lost himself gladly in the
“But you think she’ll be alright with it?” he asked, a little anxiously.
“We love your hair, ‘Mione.” he said. “Especially when you’re in Potions and it puffs up, like the cat’s.” Hermione feigned outrage and punched him gently, and Harry laughed.
“Ha ha, Draco.” Harry said, flipping him off. Draco smirked and did it right back. “See you at dinner, then.” Now he had to go find Hermione. Or Ron, seeing as she had helped Ron with the essay and Ron would let him copy.
“Go for it, mate,” encouraged Harry. Ron grinned a little self-consciously.
Draco dropped the letter on the desk, wrinkling his nose.
“Excited for the ball?” she asked, and Daphne laughed in delight.
“I passed out.” Draco snapped curtly, before exhaling and closing his eyes. Get a grip. “Sorry.” Harry leaned down and kissed him again, briefly, before pulling back. “But yeah,
Yet. Draco wasn’t stupid enough to think nothing worse would happen.
It reminded him strongly of his sixth year; when he’d spent all of his free time watching Malfoy’s movements on the Marauder's Map as the other boy had struggled to repair the Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. Could he be in the Room, for some reason? Harry wasn’t sure if the place still worked after the Fiendfyre had swept through last year. As far as he knew no one had tried.
“Ferula,” he said, with the wand motion, and a splint and bandages appeared, busily arranging themselves around Daphne’s leg. Draco grinned at the result.
“Never a dull moment, is there?” said Harry wryly as the two boys picked themselves up, and Draco laughed breathlessly.
“It’s hard not to be, with you around.” Draco remarked, and slid the chopped valerian root off of the cutting board and into the cauldron. A shoot of silver sparks went up and he poked the fire with his wand again to get the solution boiling.
“Both of you.” Hermione corrected sternly, staring pointedly at Draco, who smirked.
Draco stood in the window, watching the dark shape of the school owl he’d chosen get farther and farther away until it melted into the ever-darkening dusky sky.
“No.”
“Always so articulate, Potter,” he responds, his eyes a little brighter, and Harry grins.
It was December 24, Sunday, two days since the Crystal Ball, although that’s not what Draco remembered that day for. He remembered it because that was the day Harry had brought him up to that hill to stargaze, and they’d kissed. Started dating.
It wasn’t just the looks that drew Harry in, though, although he admitted to himself that was a part of it. Malfoy was- intriguing. He was drastically different from the Malfoy Harry thought he had known, with the snark and the prejudice and attention seeking.
“264. Everything from step 56 onwards.” Harry nodded, a bit daunted by the complicated recipe, but strolled over to the cupboard along with a few other people and began grabbing this jar or that. When he had collected an armful of things and checked the book, he walked back over to his desk, where Draco was intently watching the steaming concoction.
“Hi.” he replied. McGonagall began to talk to the ten eighth years left sitting.
“Nice to meet you, we like this place too.” said Camille, and the other two Beauxbatons students echoed her. “We’ve heard about you from them.” She chuckled.
The next morning, Harry packed his things, except for his school items. He could hear his heart beating quickly from anticipation of the trip, and he smiled to himself as he closed the lid of his trunk and latched it shut.
“Why the hell are you with him? Are you out of your mind?” exclaimed the Gryffindor boy. “What’s wrong with you, Potter?”
“What’s that all about?” said Ron in an undertone to Harry, who shrugged.
“We’ve been good. I’ve been lookin’ to find Beaky a lady friend. Meant to talk to a bloke from Greece next week about a hippogriff, he has ‘em on a reserve.”
“That’s...interesting,” Harry replied. Draco rolled his eyes and knocked his shoulder into Harry’s as he spoke.
“I’d never really thought about it, to be honest. But now I have, and I think I’ll at least try it.” Draco admitted. Harry saw his lips curve up into a rueful smile. “Not that many places
And finally, Potter. Potter, besides being amazingly attractive, was nice, funny, quick-witted, charming, and most of all Draco appreciated how Potter was good. Draco cringed inwardly, but it was the only way to describe him. He was just.. always helping someone, or protecting someone. And Potter had been the one that had been most willing to give Draco another chance, to invite him to hang out.
