She started towards the door, then stopped, turning back.  “Oh, I almost forgot.  I ask that you all be at dinner at 6:00.  I will give you more information then.  Please tell the rest.” With that, she walked out the door.
“Good,” Harry smiled.  “Glad we’re on the same page.  So, finish your breakfast, and decide where you want to go.”
, come coursing out of me.  I’m sorry that I lashed out at you. I know that spell you threw was in self defence.  I also know you didn’t know what it did.  But what you don’t know is, at the time, I wished that you had succeeded in killing me.”
Harry showed them the tapestry room, next.  “I’m going to keep it, I’ve decided.  I’m going to try and find someone that can restore it, and replace those that have been burnt off, as well as add Ted, Tonks, Remus, and Teddy to Andy’s line.”
After taking a sip, Kingsley looked back up at him.  “I wanted to talk with you some more about what you told Robards and I yesterday.  We both thi—”
“Ted, calm down!  They’re not going anywhere!  Besides, do you see your nan or auntie, yet? No.  So, let’s just go sit down for a little bit, okay?”
They spent the next hour discussing what everyone was going to bring and do.  When Harry went to bed that night, not only was he excited for Christmas, but now he was excited for all of his friends to be together to ring in the new year.
“I truly do not want to spend another night away from you, and if you live here, I won’t have to.  I hate you leaving in the mornings, going back to the Manor to change into your work clothes.  This is your home, too.  You helped make it this way, and I can see your mark in every room in this house, already.  Please?  Will you officially move in?”
“I’m sure they’ve been holding some of them back from being published until we either broke up, or got engaged, whichever came first.”
He no more than got the words out, and he could hear Draco’s grumbling stomach from across the room.  “Like I said,” he chuckled.
“Yes.  I was sitting in my study, reading, when Jissy came in and said there was someone in the floo that was looking for me.  I went into the parlor, and there was Ms Granger.  She told me what she knew, and said that Harry had asked her to bring me here.  I quickly went and retrieved my cloak, and we disapparated.”
“Good.  I love you more.”  He gripped Draco’s hand again, fingering his ring.  He lifted his hand, giving it a kiss.
Harry was now moving at breakneck speed, and knew he was close.  “Gods and Merlin above, you are so fucking gorgeous.  Are you going to come for me?  You’ve been so good, Draco, so good.”
Harry stood back up, grabbing Draco’s hand as he pulled him up the stairs.  They paused every few steps to kiss and tear off another piece of clothing.  By the time they made it to the bedroom, they were both completely naked.
Stepping through the doors, Harry was greeted by a middle-aged woman with a kindly face that reminded Harry of Molly.
Draco was the first to move back, turning to grab his coat.  Harry pulled the floo powder bowl down from the mantle, offering it to Draco.
They smiled at each other, leaning in for another kiss, when they heard a small cough behind them.  They turned around to see Professor McGonagall standing in front of the doors to the Great Hall.
Anyway, as always, thanks for reading!  And I hope beyond hope that it won't be 4 months before the next one is published!  **Crosses fingers and toes**
“Harry it is.  Draco said you were renovating this house.  I dare say it was in dire need of it the last time I was here, when I was a young girl.  I applaud you for making it a home.”
Harry could feel the warmth resonate in him as he thought about it.  This man continued to surprise him on a daily basis, as of late.
“Harry, you’re not damaged!”  Draco had again scooted forward, practically sitting in Harry’s lap, as he once again gripped his shirt in a fierce hug.  “You’re my husband.  This relationship works two ways.  You have to talk to me, so we can figure out the problem, and vanquish it together.”
Kingsley led them towards a lift that led them straight to the floor of the Minister’s office.  He led them into a large conference room, where Harry looked around in wonder at the flags that represented different country’s ministries.  He saw pictures adorning the walls of past Ministers with their counterparts of the British government.
Narcissa gave Draco an odd look as she took in his attire.  “Draco, good morning, dear.  Professor McGonagall came by this morning with some news.  Please, come sit down.”
“I know, I know.  Shhh.”  Harry popped the cap off of the tube of lube again and spread it across his cock, stroking himself a few times to make sure he was fully coated.  His eyes swept up Draco’s wheezing frame, seeing how flushed and beautiful he was.  He caressed Draco’s calf, sliding his hand under his knee, and hiking his leg over his shoulder.  “Are you ready?”
Suddenly, Draco stopped, looked at Harry, and then quickly looked down at the ground.  Harry stopped as well, with a questioning look on his face.
“We think too much alike, sometimes,” Harry chuckled.  “This time, though, it just shows how much we mean to each other.”
Harry wasted no time as he twisted away, landing precisely on the landing of the porch of number 12.
He leaned over and lightly jabbed Hermione in the ribs.  She looked over and saw that the owl was on the table.
Stepping out into the Leaky Cauldron just after Ginny, he spotted Ron and Hermione sitting in a booth just across the room from them.  Waving to them, the two of them met them in the middle and they stepped out to the brick wall blocking Diagon Alley.
She glanced up at them, giving Teddy a questioning look.  “Oh, is he pestering you, too?  Edward Lupin, I told you no.”
was going to take some getting used to, but Harry was so happy that they were happy.  He glanced over at Ginny, who looked adoringly at her brother and friend.  He knew they were going to have to have a conversation soon, and started feeling a little sick at the prospect.
Draco smiled, pulling him farther in.  “There are shops over there, food on that side, and the skating rink is towards the back.  There are also some muggle-type carnival rides, by way of the Germans.  Where would you like to start?”
He stood there a couple of moments, just staring at his godson.  A smile formed on his face when he felt what was now becoming the familiar prickle on the back of his neck letting him know Draco was near.  Without taking his eyes off of Teddy, he stuck his right arm out behind him, fingers cupped, ready for Draco to take.  He didn’t have to wait but just a couple of seconds before Draco did take it.
of you were an integral part of the end of the war, and so I feel it is right that you be an integral part of putting together the final touches.”  She looked at all of the students in front of her, but took extra care to notice the four former Slytherins, all looking down at the ground, rosy cheeks adorning their faces.  “I mean it when I say all of you.
Grabbing a few books of the shelf, Harry turned and made his way back to the table.  He just had to get through the rest of the day, and then he could get magnificently pissed.
“Yeah.  Apparently she mentioned the party to Goyle by accident, and he asked if he could come.  Blaise, I guess, said the same to Nott, and he asked, too.”
Kreacher, having somewhat gotten used to the witch, bowed his head stiffly, and moved back into his nest.
Harry smiled as he once again took in the large family that he had acquired.  He felt beyond blessed as he watched as Molly took it upon herself to feed Teddy in between her own bites.  He caught her eye, and she just winked at him with a smile as she turned to give Teddy another spoonful.
“Perfect.  I’ll see you later.”  Ron stood, leaning over to kiss Hermione again, and then headed back out into the mayhem.
Harry sighed, taking a sip of his water.   “As you know, sir, I won Draco’s wand from him at the Manor back in April.”
“Well, believe it. As a kid, I… well, I did most of the cooking.”  He looked down at the floor, thinking back on his childhood and his relatives.  He gave a small shudder.
Happy Christmas!  I hope you all liked the idea of the photos!  I've always felt that Dennis would have shown Harry the hundreds of photos that had to have been in Colin's room.  I love the idea of it.
Harry laughed too, and he watched as Teddy turned and gave Draco a look.  Draco bent over and kissed his forehead again, and then looked up and gave Harry a sad smile.
He was shocked when, as he sat down next to Narcissa, she greeted him with a smile and a small kiss on the cheek.  He quickly reciprocated the kiss, and then turned to face the front, catching Draco’s wide eyes and small smile.  He minutely shrugged his shoulders, nodding for Draco to sit down.
“I think I’m not sure I can wait until Wednesday to leave!  That sounds like perfection.”  He leant in again, kissing Harry, who immediately pulled him in for a deeper kiss.
“Definitely.  You know what I don’t understand?” He wrapped his hands around the back of Harry’s head.  “How is it that I had you, in your bed, and all we did was talk?”
.”  He grinned wide at Harry, who in turn reached for the closest pillow and slapped it across Ron’s face.
birthday, when Harry decided to throw him a surprise party.  That night, everything between them changed.
Harry looked sheepishly up at her.  “Sorry, Professor.  It’s just…”  He knew he would have to speak to the press at some point, and while it would be better that it be sooner rather than later, he still wasn’t too keen on the idea.  “What do I say?” he asked the room in general.
Harry looked up at him with a small smile.  “That’s how I feel, too, and I don’t know why, either.  This is ridiculous.”
Once his orgasm had completely subsided, and his breathing became regular once again, he cleaned up his mess, pulled up his pajamas, and released the spells around his bed.  Pulling the curtains back, he pulled on his glasses as he got out to grab some clothes and his shower things, coming face to face with the star of his wet dream.
Walking into the library, they saw that their favorite table was empty, and headed toward it.  Harry sat down and pulled out some parchment, a quill, and ink.  Draco plopped into the chair next to him, and as he scooted the chair in, his knee brushed against Harry’s thigh.
“Well, he wasn’t just taking pictures of me. It turns out, he took pictures of nearly everyone at Hogwarts and the wizarding world of Britain, as well.
After receiving several more presents from the others, it was Harry’s turn to present his.  He stood up, handing Teddy to Andromeda, and then went to stand in front of the tree.
As he stepped off the last step, he looked up and was startled to see a pair of grey eyes staring at him with absolute intensity.  Dread grew in his stomach as he asked quietly, “How much did you hear?”
He stepped out into the hall, turning to go up to his room.  He made it to the next landing before he was pulled into a hug by Draco.
“Not that it's any of your business, Potter, but my apparition license was revoked as part of my probation.  How else do you expect me to get to Hogwarts?”
“Yes, what ever do you mean?” Harry asked in faux innocence.  He too smiled as he glanced over at Nott.
Draco nodded, stomach squeezing tight when Harry took his wrist and walked them out of the room.  He could feel the eyes of everyone in the room watching them, but he didn’t care.  As they passed by the bar, George called out to Harry.  He paused and saw that George was pushing two glasses of firewhiskey at them.
Harry took in the look on Draco’s face, suddenly feeling awe at the beautiful man he was now betrothed to.  Looking to his right, he walked quickly towards Draco and took his hand as he said, “Well, we can start by getting onto the sidewalk before we get hit by a car, and our engagement become irrelevant!”
“Here, let me,” Harry said, pulling his wand.  Draco tried to stop him, but he just flicked his wrist and the welt disappeared.  Draco sighed in relief.
They passed by dozens of muggles, out for a leisurely stroll on a Saturday morning.  Teddy was running a little in front of them, occasionally peeking over the edge into the water, or watching birds walk around.
“Thank you.  It’s taken a lot of work, but I am enjoying it.  And, thank you for allowing me to host.  After everything you lot have done for me, this is the least I could do,” Harry said with a smile.
I realized late last night that when I posted this yesterday, I didn't have a summary on it, nor the picture that I was using for that day, nor an introduction...  UGH!
Everyone turned to look at them as Molly unwrapped the frame.  As she took in the photo, her eyes filled with tears.  She looked up at Harry, smiling softly at him, just as a tear fell down her cheek.  She looked back at the frame in her hands, before turning it for the rest of the room to see it.  It was a wizarding photo of Ron, Fred, George, and Ginny from a D.A. meeting.  The four of them were standing in a line, laughing, smiling and waving at the camera.  Harry, Hermione, and Luna were talking in the background, too.  George said something to Fred at the same time Ginny appeared to turn away to say something to the group behind them.  Ron laughed as Fred punched George in the arm and Ginny flipped back around and smacked George on the back of the head, causing everyone to laugh even harder.  The photo loop stopped and started again.
Just then, a rustle of fabric caught his attention, and opening his eyes, he was surprised to see said boyfriend appear out of thin air.
“Exactly,” Draco said.  “We don’t want to have to wait, mother.  The weather is unpredictable in October, too.”
Glancing down at his watch, he saw that it was nearly 11.  Everyone would be on the train, preparing to head to Hogwarts.  Harry was tempted to join them, for one last voyage, but decided that speaking with Mr Ollivander was more important.
Draco nodded, gesturing to the box on the coffee table.  He sat on the sofa, and patted the seat next to him for Harry to sit.  He opened the box, and then turned to Harry.
“What?!” Both Ron and Hermione yelled at the same time, causing several people that were sitting around their table to look over at them.  They meekly lowered their voices, again saying, “What?” at the same time.
“Harry, mate, this is brilliant.  We don’t have any photographs of us before our wedding, so this is bloody brilliant.”
He was quiet for several long moments.  Draco took a breath, pulling his hand back from Harry’s, and asked quietly, “Are you cheating on me?”
It had taken him a long time to get used to the sound of dozens of people in one place, but now he relished in it.  He had had such a lonely, quiet childhood; it was thrilling to be a part of such a large family, now.
Draco gripped back, but just shook his head.  “No, trust me, 30 days is plenty.  I was only there for three, and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone, not even those assholes.  However, I might be willing, just this once.”  He smiled at Harry.
“Have the two of you experienced the intense heat since then?”  McGonagall looked intrigued by their story.
“What the—how in the—where did you come from?  And where in the hell have you been all day?!” Draco bitterly whispered as Harry leaned down and kissed him.
Year’ than ‘the students that were unable to finish their education because they were too busy fighting for their lives against Voldemort,’ wouldn’t you?” Harry looked questioningly at Ron.
Glancing over at Ron, who just shrugged again and gave a quick nod, Harry was quick to give Molly a hug.  “I just wanted to come see you and Arthur before we left tomorrow, and to tell you what Teddy just did!” Harry suddenly remembered why he had flooed to begin with.
The pair took the bags up to the top floor bedroom: when Harry had moved back into Grimmauld, he decided that he was going to make Sirius’s old room into his.  It was truly the largest bedroom in the house, and he had many ideas of how he could make it even better once he started remodeling.
“Night, Harry.”  Draco took a bit of the powder, stepped into the fireplace, and was swirled away in the midst of green flame.
“Some boyfriend, I’ve got,” he mumbled to himself, as he closed his eyes and carefully turned on his side to try and get some sleep.
Harry took a stuttered breath.  He had definitely not been expecting that to come out of Draco’s mouth.
Wood noticed Harry’s change, and went to wrap his arm around him again, but Harry pushed the arm away and turned slowly to face Draco.  Wood followed Harry’s eyes, and upon seeing Draco, asked, “What the hell is he doing here?”
“Who said anything about a quickie?  I know you want to change into something more comfortable, and I like watching you,” he smirked.  “Besides, I promised you a surprise, and I plan on fulfilling it this evening.”
While they were wandering, they came across this tiny little café that had the greatest pastries Draco had ever eaten—and he’d had some wonderful pasties in his lifetime.  They had bought several to take home and had eaten them all before supper.  It had become a tradition for them to stop by.
“I’m his godfather; it’s my right to go overboard and spoil him rotten on his first birthday! And just wait until Rosie opens hers!” He grinned mischievously.
Harry went to reach out for his hand again, but apparently thought better of it as his hand dropped into lap.
I'M NOT GIVING UP ON THIS, I SWEAR!!!!  It's just the new year has already thrown me out the window and rolled over me with a car, and we're only 10 days in, so you know...
“Oh, I’m close! I’m so close!”  Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, making it so his cock was squished between their stomachs, making it so that with each thrust of Draco’s hips, he felt the delicious slide of his abs on his cock.
“Again with the stubbornness,” Harry mumbled to himself.  He sighed exasperatedly.  “Just drink it, yeah?”
Seeing what Harry was doing, Draco replied, “Yeah, the chasers Hufflepuff has this year are impressive.  However, not as great as the Slytherin keeper,” he added with a smirk.
Harry said nothing, just gently squeezing Draco’s hip, as they got comfortable and turned back to the television.
Harry just sat there, his arm around Draco’s shoulder.  Harry was never one for knowing what to do with emotional people, and it didn’t help that this was
Harry looked around the circle, eyes landing on Hermione’s.  She gave him a small smile.  Harry turned to listen to Ginny.
“Draco, while we still have a lot to talk about, especially as to what happened last week, no more apologizing. I forgave you as soon as you actually said you were sorry. Let’s move on, okay?” Receiving a small nod from Draco, Harry smiled, clapped his hands, and said, “Now, presents!”
As soon as he was out of earshot, Blaise leaned across the table and spat at Draco, “What the fuck are you doing here with him?”
“Well, I figured you might need one when you start Auror training,” Ron said from across the table.  “You are going to join this fall, right?”
The past several weeks had been filled with the trials of the Death Eaters.  The only ones he had attended were for Narcissa and Draco Malfoy.  He and Hermione had spoken at length of whether or not he should, but he decided to go ahead and speak on their behalves.  Both of them, after all, had saved his life.  He felt he owed it to them.  He felt no remorse, however, for Lucius.  The bastard deserved whatever he got.
Instead of flying over to Draco, though, Orion fluttered his wings as he landed on Harry’s desk, lifting his foot.  Harry took the letter, pulling some owl treats out of his desk.
Harry paused a moment, looking between the two of them. On one hand, he thought the idea was brilliant. On the other, well… No, actually, that idea sounded brilliant! He told them so, before asking, “Do you need some help?”
“I honestly don’t know.  He’s been having nightmares every night since we’ve gotten back.  He keeps thinking the worst; that he’ll be put in Azkaban for causing trouble.  I just don’t know how I can make this better for him.”
“Are you out of your mind?  A truce?!” Ron’s voice reached an all-time high, his face as red as Harry had ever seen it.
“Sorry.  I don’t really have many pieces of green cloth lying around my home,” Harry responded.  “This is going to sound strange, but there has to be a special way that you take the wand back.”
“You were badly injured.  The Aurors need to be told what happened.  I’m afraid you may be questioned.  Both of you.”  She looked at them both.  They nodded their acknowledgement.
Andromeda smiled as she handed Harry Teddy’s jacket.  “So, what sort of trouble are you boys going to get into, hmm?”
“He’s coming.  He couldn’t decide which shirt he wanted to wear, so I just left him,” she said as she descended the stairs.
“Teddy bear, the sun isn’t even awake, yet.  Why are you?”  He rolled on his side, pulling the youngster towards him, and giving him a kiss on the back of his head.
Harry slammed the door, grateful the house was still unplottable, and no one could get to the door to bang on it, and immediately went to Draco’s side.
“It needs a lot of work, but I am hoping that I can make it livable again.  The furniture in question, though, I have put in the attic.  If you’ll follow me?”
“Great, you're together!  You will never believe what just happened,” he said loudly, receiving a ‘Shhh!’  from Madam Pince.  Quieter, he went on, “We were all sitting in the common room when all of a sudden, a Patronus came zooming into the room! It was Slughorn’s, saying that he was going to have to cancel our class for this afternoon, which means our weekend starts early! How brilliant is that?”
Draco leaned up a bit, grabbing for Harry’s hand that had just left his chest.  Harry put his hand in Draco’s; Draco took it and placed it on top of the scar.
Ginny smacked Harry’s arm as she settled herself on the floor. “Yeah, yeah! You love me, and you know it!”
“Oh! She is just requesting a time to come get some more furniture.  Apparently, you are going to be seeing several new pieces in your rooms,” Harry said with a smirk.
Harry wrapped his arm around her, pulling her into a side-hug.  “I’m sorry to hear that.  I was looking forward to seeing them again.”
“Oh, how wonderful.  Well then, you two have fun on your outing.  I will see myself out.  Thank you again, Harry.  I will let you know soon about the furniture.”
“You are so damn beautiful.  Look at the way your hole flutters as I pull this out.  I just…”  He leaned in and licked the skin around the toy.  “Fuck!  I’d almost forgotten how damned good you taste!”
Harry waited until Draco had put the plate down onto the counter, before he swiftly stepped up behind Draco, wrapping his arms around his middle, and kissing his neck.
Those mesmerizing emerald eyes were immediately opened, and a concerned look was what greeted him as Harry stood and looked down at him.
Harry silenced him with a kiss.  He pulled back with a shake of his head.  “There’s nothing to thank me for.  Come on, let’s go to sleep.”
“I was afraid you were going to tell me that my mother had gotten to you and we were going to have to go to the Manor!  Spending the day with Teddy sounds like
Ron’s cheeks got even redder as he realized what Harry was trying to say.  He just gulped, nodding slowly.
“You may leave as soon as your classes are finished on Friday’s, but I ask that you return for dinner on Sunday evenings.  Any misbehaving, during classes or out in public at the weekend, will result in your privileges to be revoked.  Understood?”
“Harry!” They turned at the sound of Harry’s name, and saw Hermione and Ron walking towards them.  “What are you doing during free?”
“Let’s not worry about it.  We’re going to tell everyone on Saturday, and then we can really start planning.”
Draco pulled Harry away from the women for a moment.  “I’m going to kill either her or myself before this is all over, I swear.”  Harry could only pull him into a hug, and rub his back.
“Remember, take care around the painting,” Harry quietly said behind Draco.  Nodding, he waited for Harry, and then followed him to the sitting room.  Once inside, Draco turned and looked at the work Harry had done.
Both men were giggling as Harry placed Draco back on the ground.  He slipped the ring onto Draco’s finger, kissing his hand.
“I know for a fact she wouldn’t.  She told me just a few weeks ago how long it had been since she’d seen her.  Alright.  Let the fun begin!”  He smiled as he tugged Draco up to their room.
A sense of dread filled Harry.  Which scar was he going to ask about? Everyone knew about the lightning bolt.  But he had gained several more during the war, so the possibilities were numerous.  He turned around and looked back up at Draco.  “Yes?”
“What are you all talking about,” Harry asked, sitting down and leaning back into the front of the couch.
Harry stood as she did, shaking her hand.  Once she was gone, and he heard the floo flare, he turned and looked at Draco.  “Your mother is not at all what I imagined or remembered from this summer.”
Harry walked out the door and walked over to Arthur’s shed.  Knocking on the door and hearing an affirmative call, he walked in to see Arthur and Ginny talking.
“Okay.”  He walked over to the closet in the hallway, pulling on his coat, hat, and gloves, and handed Draco his traveling cloak.
“Well, Hermione and I were talking.  You two aren’t ‘out’ to the public, yet…  His name has been in the papers all week leading up to this…”
Draco’s erect cock was thumping onto Harry’s stomach.  Harry reached down and took it into his hand, stroking it in time with his thrusts.
Harry was turning red from the exertion of trying to hold in his laughter.  Taking a couple of deep breaths, he said, “We have tried multiple times to take the portrait down, but again, a very strong permanent sticking charm was used.  I’m afraid she will always be there.
“Um, yeah.  Well, er…”  Harry looked down at the floor.  “Draco Malfoy has helped with most of the house.”
Harry nodded as they walked into the lounge. “Yeah, there’s a little place down the street. Never been there, but it does smell amazing the times I’ve walked past. So, we have a couple of hours to kill before they get here? Whatever shall we do?” Harry smirked at Draco, who smiled back.
Harry smiled to himself as he thought of being woken up not even 30 minutes after he fell onto his bed by Noa back with a letter from Draco.  He picked it up, reading it again:
Teddy had just turned four when they started dating.  At first, he was terrified of getting to know the little boy, as his mother and aunt had still been on tentative terms at that point.  But, one afternoon with him, and he was head-over-heels in love with the little tyke.
With that, he pulled out a small red heart, made with sequins, which glistened in the light of the room.  Harry took it out of Draco’s hand, staring at it.  He lifted his head to look back at Draco.
Narcissa seemed to look between the concerned look on Harry’s face and the furious one on Draco’s face, before she said, “Very well.  I will not say anything more at this time.”
“Fascinating,” Kingsley said.  “So, the story of you disappearing in a bright, white light is true?”
The pride on her face when they came out of the pensieve was evident.  After that, she gave Harry all the information he needed to get it done.
“You haven’t seen anything yet!”  Harry went up the stairs, and motioned for them to follow him.  “While we wait for Draco, I’ll show you my bedroom!”
They began their trek down the slightly cleared path.  Up ahead, they saw Hagrid trying to clear more snow.
They were all sitting at breakfast, going over last minute reviews, when Harry heard the unmistakable sound of the owls sweeping into the Great Hall.  Harry wasn’t expecting any mail, so was shocked when a tawny barn owl landed in front of him.  The owl automatically stuck its leg out, seeming bored with its mission.  Harry barely had released the letter from the creature, before it lifted itself back up into the air.
He couldn’t help but wonder what had gotten into Draco, though.  Draco coming in during the middle of the night, Narcissa calling, and then Draco’s bizarre mood swing.  None of it made any sense.
Bracing himself for the large crowd that was no-doubt inside the store, Harry followed Hermione inside.  Sure enough, they were assaulted by noise as they walked in.  They walked towards the front desk, where a red-faced Ron was trying to help four people at the same time.
Harry could not wait to have his weekends free.  He was hoping to be able to get a few rooms done in Grimmauld before Christmas; he was determined to have Christmas at his home this year, in order to give Molly a break.
Draco laughed, pecking Harry on the lips once more before stepping away from the man.  “That is about the only spell I can cast non-verbally and wandless.  Slytherins learn that one quite early,” he said with a wink.
They started walking down the street, towards the closet apparition point.  Coming to the alley, Harry stepped in and stuck out his arm to Draco.  A split second hesitation, and then he was gripping Harry’s arm.  Turning on the spot, they were both twisted away.
“I’ve heard about that.  My sister has always been stubborn, but I’m almost positive the two of you can out-stubborn anyone, including one Narcissa Malfoy.”
They were interrupted when the young woman that had brought them to the back stepped up and asked if they were ready.  Draco nodded.  She ushered them into two separate rooms.
“Good afternoon, sir,” she squeaked.  “Mitsy will help you.”  She walked around Harry, snapping her fingers and causing the fabric to shrink in certain areas and lengthen in others.  She changed the colours several times, until becoming satisfied and stepping back.  “How does sir like it?”
Grabbing a plate and piling it with food, Harry walked over to one of the couches, and made himself comfortable.
“Oh, Harry.  It’s exactly the same,” he breathed, looking around the room, and then opening the curtains to see their snow-covered balcony.
Climbing the steps up to the front door, Harry finally released Draco’s hand so that he could take off his glove to open the door.
Harry glanced back down at the box that he held in his hand, and became very intrigued.  He glanced back up at George, who shook his head slightly and winked at Harry, again.  Harry gave him a curious look, but just placed the box back into the bag with the other Wheezes.
“I love you, too.”  He kissed his neck, whispering in his ear, “10 days, and you’ll be Mr Malfoy-Potter.”
Harry laughed, and smiled as he thought of Molly fussing over his well-being.  He had been thoroughly surprised when, on the first Christmas after the war, Molly and Arthur had presented him and Hermione their own hands to go on the Weasley Family clock.
Draco started down the stairs again, even more sure of what he needed to do tonight.  He paused again at the bottom of the steps, however, when he realized that the portrait of his great-aunt was visible, seemingly screaming words to anyone that walked past, but entirely silent.  He smiled to himself, impressed with whoever had finally managed to shut her up.
It was still a decent time, so they decided to take a walk around London.  They walked along the Thames, walking past the London Bridge.  It was absolutely breathtaking, lit up at night, with Christmas decorations on either side of the river.
Regaling his captive audience with his tales of his godson, Harry quickly lost track of time.  Before he knew it, it was coming on 6:00.  “Oh, I’d better get home and finish packing,” Harry said.
The next evening, Andromeda frantically called upon Harry to see if he would take Teddy for the evening, as one of her dear friends had taken a spill, and she wanted to go be with her at St Mungo’s.
Harry didn't tell her that they had, in fact, gone to a pub together to ‘clear the air’ as it was, over the holiday.  They were both pleasantly surprised to find they actually had a lot in common.
Harry said quickly, “Yeah! Let’s start back up in my room.  I forgot to show you some things last time.”  He and Draco put down the board that they were working with, and after each casting a cleaning charm on their clothes, the four of them made their way up the 4
She didn’t know what to do with herself for a moment, but then wrapped her arms around him.  “You’re welcome.”
Seeing the sorrow in the man’s face, Harry started walking again, looking over at Draco.  “Tonks was brilliant.  Clumsy as all, but brilliant.  She was a metamorphmagus, so she could change her appearance into whatever she wanted.  She could come up with the best disguises.  That helped her when she became an Auror.  She married Remus Lupin, and they had a son, Teddy.  He is also a metamorphmagus, and equally as brilliant as his parents.”
If he were being honest, he much preferred to do it the muggle way, as it had a calming effect on him to wrap everything by hand.  The first year he and Harry had been a couple, Harry had bought some wrapping paper.  Draco couldn’t understand what he was doing until Harry had shown him how to wrap a box.
Draco, having been smart enough to have grabbed the paint palette and picture of the rug, pulled them out and laid them on the seat in between them.  “It would go with your plans, too.  Put some colour accents on it that match the rug, and it will be perfect.  I think you should get this one.”
Ginny gave Harry a look that reminded him of the twins, and he instantly knew he was in for it.  “That can be arranged.” She looked around the room until she saw who she was looking for, and then yelled, “Seamus! Bring us a bottle!”
He pulled back, letting the cock flop out of his mouth, and licked up the vein, before pulling it back in, letting the head rest on his tongue, sucking and lolling his tongue around the slit.  He flicked open the lube and got a little on his fingers.  Still sucking on the head of Draco’s cock, he gently prodded one finger against his hole, tapping it when Draco started bucking his hips.
“But, then I remembered you taking down the walls between bedrooms upstairs, and I thought why couldn’t that work? They had just tried to take the painting off, not the entire wall.”
Ginny’s was taken during her stint as the Gryffindor Seeker, while Harry was banned in fifth year.  She made a sweeping flip, grin wide and hair flapping the wind, just before grabbing the Snitch.
“Don’t you worry about it, mate.  Those bastards will get what’s comin’ to them, and you’ll be back before dinner, I just know it.”
Draco stood and walked towards the door, but stopped when he saw that Harry was still standing near the closet door.  Draco turned to him, giving him a questioning look.  “What?”
“Of course! You've had just as much to do with the renovations as Harry has, from what I've heard,” she said with a smile.  “So, tomorrow at 7?  Great!  See you then!”  And with that, Ron grabbed her hand and twisted away.
Draco sighed as he finished the last gift he had in front of him.  “I don’t know what to do.  That sounds like the perfect mixture of your style and my style.  And I still like the thought of May or June.  Flowers blooming, green grass.  Oh, Harry!  How do I tell my mother no?”
Harry called for Kreacher, who popped into the room, and upon receiving a request for tea, popped back out.  Harry went up to his bedroom to start figuring out measurements.  He had only been upstairs for around 30 minutes, drawing a floor plan of what he thought would work, when he heard a “Potter!” coming from the floo.
As soon as they had gotten into Grimmauld, Draco had floo’d to the Manor to drop off his things and visit with his mother, but promised to be back soon to lend a hand with the kitchen.
Harry paused just long enough that Hermione suddenly said, “We can discuss Harry’s plans later.  For now, let’s eat this delicious food before it gets cold!  Thank you, Kreacher, for this wonderful food,” Hermione said quickly.
“Monday morning, we—I will take our wands to Ollivander’s and see if he can figure out what happened.  If the ministry calls attention to you, we will explain what happened, and what Ollivander found out.  We’ll make sure that they understand that you have done no wrong.”  He reached out and grasped Draco’s hand, squeezing it lightly.  “I promise.”
“Harry! Please! Oh, please!”  Draco was shuddering above Harry, now.  Harry figured he was doing something right, if this was what Draco’s response was.
Harry went to go pick it up, sitting down on the coffee table next to Draco, so they were sitting in front of Teddy.
“Not a seer, just know their writers are idiots, and can’t come up with something clever.”  Draco slipped into the chair across from Harry, hand covering his mouth as he started reading the article that took up the top half of the front page.  Harry sat patiently waiting for him to finish, before he took it back and finished from where he had left off.
,” Harry said with a smirk.  Draco turned and gave him a look, but Harry just grinned and said, “Oh, come on!  You opened the opportunity right up for me!  I had to take it!”
“Well, I’m alive, and not much worse off than when I left, thankfully.  There wasn’t much ‘mortal peril’-esque drama this time around.  Mainly it was just hiding out in abandoned warehouses and dwellings that had the possibility of falling in around our ears at any moment, to be honest.  There were quite a few nights that we wondered if we would survive until dawn, as the building creaked and groaned every time the wind blew.  That’s one way to get your adrenaline pumping, for sure.”
“Yes, I did.  But, the waking up thing was much better.”  He paused a moment as the words left his mouth, and then it suddenly hit him why they sounded so familiar.
Harry stopped talking as he suddenly felt a tingle on the back of his neck.  He slowly looked up to see that it wasn’t Andromeda that was standing in the doorway, but a nervous looking Draco.  Draco quickly glanced around the room before his eyes landed fully on Harry.
“Thanks, mate,” Harry said, grabbing the glasses.  He handed one to Draco and then motioned for him to follow him down to the kitchen.
Harry and Draco looked at each other.  Draco said, “I don’t feel any different in my core, but I do sometimes feel a bit more power when doing normal spells, especially if I’m close to Harry.”
After a few minutes of joking around, Draco squeezed Harry’s hand and then moved around the circle to stand between Hermione and Ron, whispering something to them.  They both nodded and turned to step off to the side of the terrace.
Harry took that moment of hesitation to flip them.  He straddled Draco’s waist, taking off his own shirt.  He rubbed his hands up and down Draco’s chest, pinching his nipples.  This caused Draco to moan louder.  Harry could feel his pants getting tighter by the second.
needs better reporting if they can’t even get the scoop of a lifetime: ‘Former Death Eater to Wed the Boy Who Lives.’”
“Yep!  Get your cloak; Draco insists!”  He handed her the letter, and she saw that sure enough, Draco had requested that she join them that afternoon.
Ron laughed.  “Deluge.  But, if mum is offering us sweets before supper, who am I to complain? Come on, let’s feed the masses.”  He took the plate, offering a cookie to the rest of the group, before making his way towards the others.
“Mother has mentioned a few times this autumn about contacting her, but she just didn’t know how to go about doing so.”
“You’re welcome. Here’s your other present,” he said as he pulled something out of his pocket, enlargening it with his wand.
“Merlin, I knew I loved you for more than just your good looks! You’ve got a brilliant brain, too.  You go run the water, and I’ll get us some wine and the supplies for the letters.”
“Merry Christmas!”  Harry walked over to them, shaking Bill’s hand and giving Fleur a hug.  She kissed him on the cheek, and as he pulled back he realized— “Oh, my goodness!”
He paused as he walked back past the bathroom door, contemplating on whether or not to say something to Harry, but then decided against it; he didn’t have time to deal with all that needed to be dealt with at the moment.  So, he just made his way back downstairs to the floo, calling out for the Ministry.
As they walked into the room, they noticed that it had already been cleared out.  Only 3 people remained: Justin, Hannah, and Millicent.
Draco flinched as Pansy launched herself at him, gripping him tightly in a hug.  He whimpered in pain, causing her to jump back, but then she quickly launched into a lecture of how he needed to pay more attention to his environment and who he was near, and soon his conversation with his mother was completely forgotten.
“Indeed.  It’s okay, though.  We’ll have plenty of time to continue later.”  He smirked over at Harry.
Harry cast a quick healing spell, and pulled him onto the bottom step.  “Well, so much for thinking the article and letters would be the easy part, eh?”
Just as he walked through the doorway, they floo flared up, Ron and Hermione stepping through, each carrying an overnight bag.
Draco looked at him like he was mad, telling him so. “It’s gorgeous! I love our birthstones, and the diamond is perfect!”
“Ready?” Hermione asked Ron and Harry.  Receiving nods of confirmation, she said, “One, two, three.” The trio raised their wands together, and the pieces of marble came back and fit into place.  Ron and Harry put their wands down, but Hermione cast another spell.  A bright white light emitted from her wand and fell across the stone.
Draco woke with a start when the curtains in his room were flung open, emitting the bright light of the early morning sun.
“Fucking McKee decided that I looked at him wrong, and he hexed me.  Luckily, McGonagall was turning the corner when he did it, so I don’t think I will have to worry about him any time soon.”  He looked down at his arm and the large, red welt.  It was on his right arm, so it was going to be interesting trying to cast a healing charm.  He never could get anything to work right with his non-dominate hand.
Harry leaned on the table to see who was sitting on the other side of Dean, and saw that it was Ginny, who was leaning into Luna’s chest, talking across the table to Hermione and Pansy, who were engaged in a heated debate on something he was sure he didn’t want to know about.
Harry chuckled as he threw his leg back over the bike, walking back towards where Draco was standing beside it.
“Of course you did,” Draco mumbled.  “I’m ready for the days when he becomes a lazy teenager, and doesn’t wake up until noon.”
That was all of the warning Harry was given before Draco came, spurting into Harry’s mouth.  Harry wasn’t ready for it, so, choking, Harry released Draco from his mouth, getting hit with spurts of come on his face, hair, and chest.
“For always being there for me, even when you don’t want to be.  For loving me.  For never letting me get away with anything.  For…for being mine.”
Harry moved up onto his knees so it would be easier to talk and continue to let Draco hold his hand.  “It was because of our first day of class, fifth year, actually. She didn't like that I said that Voldemort was back.”  Harry was pleased that he only heard a couple of gasps from his classmates when he said the name.  “She said that was false information, to which I basically exploded with rage, and called her on it.”
The old elf was bogged down with a large bag, which Harry was sure was full of letters, packages, and he was almost certain, a few howlers in the mix as well.
“Fine.  Great.  Wonderful.”  He pulled on his traveling cloak before he grabbed the gifts that he had sat on the coffee table and walked quickly towards the front door.  As he grabbed the handle, Harry spoke up.
The five of them were enjoying their meal, when an owl swooped in through the open window and landed on the table next to Harry’s plate.  Harry took the letter from its leg, and flicked it a couple of sausages, and then the bird was back out flying through the air.
Harry had had a talk with Kreacher, making sure there would be no issues when Molly came to cook, and was pleased when the old elf just bowed, took the items from Molly’s hands, and then disapparated out.  He was back in a split second, taking more and saying nothing.
“Come here,” Draco said, widening his legs.  Harry turned and snuggled up between his legs, feeling something long and hard butt up to the small of his back.
He had just about finished removing the paper from the largest wall, when he got that tell-tell prickle at the back of his neck.
“What do you want to do first, huh?”  Teddy started bouncing, talking nonsense.  “You are going to start walking soon, aren’t you?  Your gran isn’t going to know what to do once that happens.  And talk, too.  We’re all going to be in trouble, aren’t we?  Huh?  Can you say Uncle Harry?  Uncle Harry?”
Draco sighed.  He tightly closed his eyes and clenched his fists as he thought about the dream.  “It was about today.  About them blaming me, and sending me to Azkaban.”
Hermione and Pansy had stepped away, and were whispering to each other, nodding and gesturing.  Hermione turned and told Harry to turn around and face the stairwell.
Harry had to keep telling himself, though, that all he had to do was get through Charms, and it was Christmas hols.
Harry was pushed aside as the mediwitch started working on Draco.  He moved back until his spine came against the wall, to which he slid down until he was sitting on the floor.  Knowing not what else to do, he placed his face into his hands, and cried.
Just then, Professor Flitwick told the class about their essay that was due next class, and dismissed them.  Harry and Draco quickly put their things in their bags, and then walked side-by-side out into the corridor, where they both began laughing again.
Harry just grinned at Ron.  “So, what do you need me for?  It sounds like you have everything covered!”
“Isn’t it beautiful?  Oh, Ronald, I love it!”  Molly, Fleur, Angelina, and Ginny had all gathered around her, admiring her gift.
By this time, Draco’s hair was standing on end from running his fingers through it, and his cheeks were red with anger.
Draco’s eyes widened and he gasped slightly.  “The link,” he whispered to himself, looking down at the floor.
“I understand how, if my magic was released into his wand, that I could use his, but how is it that he can use mine if he wasn’t touching it?”
Taking one step back, Harry winced: his pants were sticky from his spunk.  Before he could even think about reaching for his wand (which had fallen on the ground when they had started kissing) to cast a cleaning charm, Draco waved his hand over both of them, casting a wandless, non-verbal spell.
“It’s the wand that I got when I turned eleven.  Harry… returned it to me right before we went back to Hogwarts.  But, wait, that still doesn't make sense.  Does that mean I apparated?  Wouldn't the ministry have called me in for using magic that I'm not allowed to do per my probation? Is that even possible, though?  I was unconscious!”
“My assistant is making the order, and it will pop in when it’s ready.  Now, again, thank you for allowing me to hear your side of things, Mr Malfoy.”
“What about you?  I should help you get off.”  Harry grinned at the way Draco sounded so sincere.  Without really thinking about it, Harry stripped out of his pyjamas and pants, cleaning himself up.
“Harry, I pledge my heart to you.  I take you now as my husband, from here on, during good times and bad.  I vow to protect you and keep you, for all eternity.  I am yours and you are mine, as long as we both live.”
“Those were some mighty fine beards.  I was slightly disappointed when Poppy removed them,” George said, with a smile and a sigh.  “Thanks, Harry.  This is brilliant.”  He looked up at Harry, his eyes watery, too.  “Seriously.  Brilliant.”  He looked back down as he took Angelina’s hand.
“So, I’d like to take you on a date.  An all-day date, if possible.  Go to a museum, or go shopping at Diagon, or ride the London Eye, or something. And then, get dinner, hopefully come back here, and maybe I can cook you breakfast again tomorrow morning.”
“He’s in there,” he said, nodding towards the dining room.  “I think he is talking with Wood and Zabini.”
“Nothing is wrong,” he immediately replied, glancing down the hall as a loud noise descended onto the floor, several of his coworkers stepping out of another lift.
They looked at each other with small smiles, but Draco’s grew as he looked down at the child in his boyfriend’s arms.  Harry looked down at the emerald eyes that Teddy was displaying.  Harry grinned, pecking a kiss on the baby’s head.  He looked back up at Draco, nodding his head to indicate they should leave the room.
“I didn’t feel like going back to the Burrow, and it was still too early for me to go to Wheezes, so I decided to walk around your neighbourhood.  I’ve never really gone into Muggle London, as you well know, but I conquered my fears and went for a walk.”
Draco cleared his throat and said, “Just talking about how much we’ll miss him when he goes off to Hogwarts.”
“Well,” Draco gasped, “There was he slight problem of me dating an idiot, and you having sworn off dating.”
Harry, who had been staring at the painting, mystified, came back out of the trance, and nodded.  “Yes, sounds great.  I will leave you to it, then, and be back Sunday around 4:00.  Will that work for you?”
“No, it’s fine! I’m just coming up with ideas on how to tease him mercilessly about how he missed me so much he would go spend Sunday’s with my family.  It’s just too sweet for words.” Harry smiled.
Draco smiled, blushing slightly as he nodded his head, and as everyone yelled “One!” they swallowed their champagne and leant in for a kiss, not caring that it was the first time they had truly kissed in front of their friends.
Kreacher bowed again, popping out of the room.  Harry didn’t have to wait for too long before his owl swooped onto the window sill.
Harry got up and brushed his teeth.  He walked over to the door, opening it slightly to see if he could hear voices coming from the sitting room, but it appeared as if a silencing charm had been used.  He crawled back onto the bed to wait.
“Great.  Sent texts to everyone I can think of.  Once we’re done, I’ll go take those down to Noa and let her deliver them.”
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle at him.  Draco tried to give him a disgruntled look, but it just couldn’t quite fill his reddened face.
Harry lifted his hand, sifting his fingers through Draco’s hair.  “Hmm? Oh, nothing. Just thinking.”
Crawling into his four-poster, he took of his glasses and laid his head on the pillow.  He was sound asleep within moments.
“What kind of project?” Harry was beyond curious; Ron and Malfoy willingly spending time together?  It didn’t make sense.
“We’re getting married, tomorrow!  We can’t spend the night together; you’re not supposed to see each other before the ceremony.”
Draco sighed deeply, clutching onto Harry a bit tighter, and then said, “6th year, I had already taken the Mark before term began. I hope I put on a brave and pompous face, but was actually terrified on the inside. You got a tiny glimpse of that in the bathroom that day.”
“Not too terrible.  I’m not sure how well I did on the third part, but Granger and I talked about it on the way back up here, and maybe I didn’t do as bad as I thought.  I guess we’ll find out soon enough.”
“He then shook my hand.  It was completely bizarre, if I’m being honest.  But, yeah, the diamond was your grandfather’s.  I thought our birthstones made a nice touch.  I wanted it to be perfect.  To show you how much I love you.”
Harry just grunted at him as they went down to the dining room, trying not to think about what had just occurred.
“But you don’t have to.  I’m so glad you decided to get help.  I still just wish you had said something.”  He sighed, running his hands through Harry’s hair.  “Come on, let’s go to bed.  I have a feeling we’re going to have an excitable ten-year old hop on our bed far too early in the morning.”
He turned to them as they walked up and pointed at the phone booth that stood on the walkway.  “Look at that!” he laughed.
Both men were in awe of the splendour.  “Thank you, Kreacher,” Draco said, to which the elf bowed and then popped away.
The slipped through the curtain and immediately found themselves in an even larger room filled with robes, shirts, trousers, cloaks, etc.  There seemed be smaller dressing rooms littered along the back wall, with mini circle-shaped stages sitting in front of each room.
Harry and Draco pulled each other towards them, smiles wide as they kissed each other to loud applause from behind them.
“Ah, it’s good to be home”, Draco said, toeing off his shoes and placing them next to the hall closet, before coming back in and curling up on the couch.  “Now all we have to worry about is New Year’s next week, and we will have survived another holiday season.”
Draco smiled at him, before taking a sip.  His grin grew as he tasted it.  “That’s delicious! Thanks.”  He then leant back against Harry’s side.
They walked up the stairs to the front door.  Draco stopped, turned, and gave Harry a chaste kiss.  “I can't get over that I am allowed to do that,” he said with a smile.
That was definitely Draco’s voice. Harry rounded the corner to the stairs leading down to the ground floor, and saw his boyfriend and best mate standing in the front foyer—working together—and picking up the still silenced painting of Walburga Black off of the ground.
He heard voices coming from across the hall, so he walked over and peered in the doorway.  He could see several of his classmates—current and past—sitting around the large room, talking.
Harry glanced over at the bedside table and looked at what time it was.  He then looked over at the orb and saw that Teddy was still sound asleep.  He looked up at Draco.
“Godric, yes.  We fell asleep still in our wedding clothes.  Thank Merlin for Hermione and Pansy, though, who made sure that we got room service the next morning.”
Harry sat there, dumbfounded for a couple of moments.  Did he really hear that right?  After all that he had said to Ron about no more fighting and getting along, could it be true that it was
He rubbed his eyes again, willing the sight of Draco falling into the flames to be wiped from his memory.
Harry finished pulling on his clean shirt and trousers, walked back out and asked, “In me to do what?”
They both leaned in, eyes gently closing, lips a hair-breadth away from each other, when there was a loud bang on the door.
Harry nodded and Draco carefully put the dragon back in the box and opened the other one.  He lifted the lid and smiled wide.  “The set.  They’re perfect together.”  He pulled out a stag, large antlers and one of the front paws raised as if it was pawing at the ground.
Draco huffed, but skated out a little way away, spinning in a wide circle, warming up a little.  He looked over at the two, Harry’s hands on Teddy’s shoulders, watching him, and smiled.  He did a lazy circle, and then brought his leg in tight to do a spin, releasing and making another circle.
Draco nodded, and then turned and made his way down to the level below.  Everyone followed, and soon they were discussing plans for those rooms.
Before they could even get out the doors of the Great Hall, Harry was stopped by Teddy hugging his legs.
By the time they had shaved, showered, shagged in said shower, showered again, and then dressed, it was nearing 5:00.
Harry turned to glare at his best friend at the same time, and gave the same reaction that Draco did.
Harry gripped his shoulder tighter and tugged him over the hearth, calling out for Grimmauld Place.  Stepping out into his lounge, he turned Draco in his arms and pulled him closer.  “As if I would let you out of my sight after that.  Give me a bit more credit,” Harry whispered in his ear.
It was flawless. If Harry hadn’t known any better, he would have said that it had been there since the house was built.
“Ron yelled at me.  He told me what you three had spoken about at the birthday party.  About your fears.  But you have to know what has been going on, please.”
“We’ve had a nice chat, is all,” Ron said as he stood up and walked over to Hermione, giving her a kiss on the cheek.
“Yeah, I sent floo’d her, letting her know.  She said she was about to floo here and ask if he could stay, as her friend is still at Mungo’s.”
They all agreed, and once the carriage stopped, they clambered off.  Walking towards the end of the platform, they said their goodbye’s.  Hermione grasped Ron’s arm, and they disappeared with a pop.  Harry turned to Draco, who clasped his hand in Harry’s; Harry thought of the ‘three D’s’ and twisted away towards London.
That Friday, Draco got off a couple of hours early.  He floo’d into their sitting room, and immediately was on edge; there was an unfamiliar traveling cloak thrown over the back of the sofa.  He pulled his wand, and quietly walked towards the door.
“Sirius put those up when he was a teenager to hack off his parents.  We’ve tried everything, but he used one hell of a strong permanent sticking charm.  I’m just going to have to take the whole wall out, I think.”
Harry couldn't help but smile, as he shook his head and turned back to the entry hall; he needed to finish his project, too.
Kreacher handed Harry a plate of food, and so he carefully placed his cloak on the table, sitting down to eat.  They chatted a bit while finishing their food, and then Hermione told them it was time to go.
“Good plan,” Draco chuckled.  “Speaking of, our portkey is scheduled to leave in about 10 minutes.  We should probably get to reception and pick it up.”
Hermione wrapped her arm around Draco, pausing his pursuit of a chair momentarily.  “Seriously, Draco.  Don’t you for one second believe what is going through your head.  Harry loves you.  Fiercely.  We’ll knock some sense into him and figure out what is going on.  Trust me.”
Harry moved a stray piece of blond hair behind Draco’s ear.  He cupped the side of his head, rubbing his thumb against Draco’s cheek, carefully avoiding the bruises that were prominent around both eyes and his nose.  Quietly, he said, “Hey.  I'm here.”
“Honestly, I thought about burning them,” Harry laughed.  He was only partly kidding, but the look on Ginny’s face told him that it was a brilliant idea.
, and that made it all the more better.  Gripping Draco’s hips, he again flicked over the head, taking more of it into his mouth.  He moaned around it, taking in all of the tastes and smells that were assaulting his senses.
, so he decided that maybe one of his school books would have something in it.  Seeing as they had a few days at Hogwarts until term began, he figured he would be able to come up with something while hanging around the school.
Draco lightly slapped his arm as Harry went and straddled the front bar of the tandem bike.  “Alright, so, we’re going to start on the left.  Fix your pedal like this, and then on the count of three, push on it and then sit down on the seat, like this.”  He demonstrated for Draco, and then counted down.  Before they knew it, they were riding the bike.
Harry gave Teddy a quick bath, and then put him to bed.  Deciding to call it an early night as well, he trudged upstairs and quickly took off his clothes.  Crawling into bed, he found his mind drifting back to his and Draco’s conversation earlier in the day, and the consequent talk with Hermione and Ron.  Harry’s mind flooded with ideas of what to say to Draco, but nothing really conveyed what he wanted to say and how he felt.  With words floating through his head, he fell asleep.
“It really does look incredible, Harry.  Did you have very many more issues with doxies or boggarts or any of the things we came across whilst cleaning?”
“Like you said, we can do it whenever and wherever we want to.  Just need someone to do the ceremony and a couple of witnesses.  And actually, I think I have the perfect place and the perfect person to do it.”
“I wouldn’t be opposed to you having a nibble,” he said with a grin, sticking his behind out and giving it a little shake.”
“Yeah, that’s what I said.  It’s impressive magic, as McGonagall and Ollivander both keep telling me.  I still don’t know what it all means, but I’ve been reminded once again that my magic is powerful.”
“Thank you, sir.  Thank you for everything.”  Lucius nodded at him, and then walked back to where Narcissa stood.
Blaise and Ron walked back up to the table carrying trays of drinks and chips between them.  They placed them in the middle of the table, and there was a flurry of hands grabbing their orders and hollering for someone to pass the vinegar.
Harry didn’t have much patience though, as he was still half-hard from Draco’s earlier teasing, so he decided to save himself a couple of steps and strip out of his clothes as he went.  As he got to 50, he was already on the landing, taking his shirt off, and headed up the stairs.  He counted 100 as he made it to the next landing, and had removed his jeans.
Draco was mesmerised by the sight in front of him.  Harry was so good with the child.  He had only seen him holding the child for less than five minutes, and he already knew that Harry would make a great father someday.
Draco leaned back, grabbing his wand from beside him.  He lightly slapped Harry’s thigh, who took the hint and gripped his calves, pulling his legs up to his chest.
Shaking his head, he turned around and saw a group of people gathering in a tight circle.  He walked towards them, trying to figure out what was going on, and was beyond shocked to see Harry pushing through the crowd, his arms laden with what looked like cups and muggle to-go containers.
“I agree, but for some reason I was allowed back.”  The addition of that voice made both Harry and Ron turn around and gasp.  Malfoy stood in the middle of the room, hands in fists, down by his side.  The rest of their classmates were peering out of the dorm doors.  “I honestly didn’t think McGonagall would permit me to finish my education, but I’m here.  I just want to get my N.E.W.T.S. and move on with my life.”
“Of course you would wrap it in Gryffindor colors, Potter.  Why did I expect anything less?”  Despite his rude comments, Malfoy’s eyes deceived him; he seemed very pleased to be reunited with his wand.
He continued frotting against Draco as they slowly came down from their high.  He leaned in for a kiss. Harry stopped rubbing, but continued leaning against Draco, whose legs were beginning to loosen their tight grip from around him.
He was awoken sometime later by a warm mouth nuzzling his jaw.  He blearily opened his eyes and saw a tuft of blond.  Draco realized that he had woken Harry, and so looked up at him, smiling.  “Have a good nap?”
He took a deep breath, forcing the tears back, and stepped through the gate, making his way to the front door.  As he pushed open the door, he was assaulted by the sheer loudness that was the Weasley family.  He smiled to himself.  This will get his mind off things.
Draco let his hands slide down Harry’s neck, back, and arse, before he dropped them to his side, letting Harry step back.
Harry and Draco looked at each other, Draco giving Harry a nod of the head before covering his ears.  Taking a deep breath, Harry pulled the curtains back, and then covered his own ears.
Millicent, Michael, and Ernie were helping with the final bits of renovations to the potions dungeons with Professor Slughorn.
Seamus turned around and yelled to Dean, who was talking to Hannah and Justin, telling him to come play. Soon, all of their classmates were joining them around the fire.  Harry moved forward a bit, so people could walk behind him to sit on the couch and on the chairs beside them, and when he scooted back against the couch, his back came in contact with legs.
Harry carefully jumped up on the bed, and grabbed Ron’s forearms.  He knew he had to be careful in waking Ron, or else he would get a fist in the face.  This had happened more than once, and he was not looking for it to happen again.
“Yeah, I wasn’t planning on it.  I was supposed to be helping Mal—” He stopped himself, turning red.
Draco smiled and wrapped his other hand around Harry’s bicep.  “I love you, too, you silly man.  Come on, let’s go home.”
Harry broke out his million galleon smile, leaning in for a kiss.  Draco turned back to look at the closet as Harry stepped up behind him, wrapping his arms around his waist.
“BLOOD TRAITOR!  HALF-BREED MONSTROSITY!  HOW DARE YOU LIVE IN THE MOST NOBLE AND ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK!  GET OUT! GET OUT AND TAKE YOUR FILTH WITH YOU!”
“So, we decided we’re going to elope.”  That caused everyone to jump up from the couch, grins on their faces.”
Harry leaned against the bar, talking with Tom and placing their order.  Once done, Harry took a breath and looked at Draco.  “You okay?”
“Orion!  I like that!  Wait, wasn’t Sirius’s middle name Orion?  Oh, Harry!  That’s perfect!”  She smiled at him, and then turned back to Ron.
“Where is Draco?  I thought he’d be here,” Hermione asked as they ascended the stairs to the top floor.
Everyone around them laughed, sans Nott, who seemed to be trying to burn a hole through Harry’s forehead with his eyes.  Harry smirked to himself.  He was going to piss Nott off enough that he’d leave before too much longer.  His smirk widened as Blaise joined in on the action.
Harry tuned them out, instead turning and walking towards the gate.  He didn't feel like trying to convince Ron that Draco and he were on good terms.  Truce was not a concept Ron would be willing to accept, Harry knew.  As they stepped up to the double winged boars, they all pulled out their wands.  At the same time, they moved their wands in a circle.  The gate, while seemingly still shut, emitted a quick white glow.  They walked through the spires of the gate, and once on the other side, again the gate glowed white.
what I need.  I heard that there is a muggle ice-skating rink set up in Diagon.  Maybe we can take him?”
Harry set the spoon down and cast a stasis charm on the pot.  He stepped over to Draco and took his hand, leading him over to the bench at the table.
Rolling his eyes, Harry went to turn around to chastise him, but before he could, Draco had walked up behind him, wrapping his arms around Harry’s torso, resting his chin on Harry’s shoulder.
“Hmmm… Want to share a shower,” Harry whispered against Draco’s ear.  They held hands as they walked into the en suite.
She glanced over at Draco, who just smiled.  She quickened her steps over to him, and gently placed Hugo in his arms, handing over the bottle.  “Thanks, Harry,” she said as she kissed his forehead.  She leant over and gave Draco a kiss, too.  “Be right back.”
Walking out to the back garden, he could see Ginny and Hermione preparing the start making a pile of his old clothes.  He hurriedly walked over to them to help with the removal.  Once they had everything set up, Ginny went to gather everyone around.  Bill walked out with a large bottle of Fire Whiskey, with George following behind with a stack of cups.  Once everyone had received a glass and had a shot of whiskey, Ron started with the toasts.  Everyone in the circle said something about Harry, much to his chagrin.  Once it got back to himself, Harry gave a toast to all of them, as well as those that weren’t there but should have been.  He didn’t want any tears, so he thanked them all for coming, gulped his drink, and then pointed his wand at the pile of clothes.  With an
He braced himself for the ridicule he was afraid was about to come, but it never did.  Draco grinned even wider than he had earlier that evening, and before Harry could even think about what was happening, Draco had pushed their bodies together and they were kissing.
No scenario Harry could have ever thought of how this conversation would go could have prepared him for the look on Malfoy’s face as he spoke that last sentence.
“Show off.”  Hearing Draco’s muttering beside him made Harry laugh and lose his hold on the objects; the book fell onto the table, with the feather floating down beside it.  Harry grabbed the book and put it on top of his bag, and then focused on the feather again.
Draco threw the ball to Harry, who sighed as he looked at his fiancé.  “Hon, we’re getting married in two days.  Yes, only Ron, Mione, Blaise, and Pans will know, but we will be married.  What’s the matter?”
“How about we go to bed and have hot, passionate, boyfriend sex!  Because the next time we do it, it will be boring, married sex.”
Harry snapped the window shut, and hopped back over to his bed, glad that he hadn’t been gone from it long enough for it to get cold.
With a slight stumble, Harry and Draco landed just on the outskirts of Hogsmeade.  They both turned and headed towards the Hogwarts gates.  Harry was glad that he had grabbed that jumper; it was indeed a bit cooler.
, and, using my magic, via his own, cast an accio charm on himself.  Ollivander couldn’t explain the bright light, though.  He did say that Malfoy would have been brought into the house, but we did such a great job on the wards, the house basically wouldn’t allow him entry.  His wand cast a charm to make the doorbell ring, instead.”
They continued down the alley, going into shop after shop, purchasing gifts for everyone on their lists.  They stopped in at Weasley’s, and Ron gave Teddy some ‘free trials’ of some new toys.  He sat on top of the counter playing with them, while Harry and Draco stood chatting to Ron and George.
Draco grinned as he pictured his best friend.  He knew Harry was right, and honestly, he was kind of impressed that both Blaise and Pansy let him leave with such little fan-fair.
“Well, I painted them.  We went on a trip, and got to paint cups and plates and stuff.  I painted a vase for Nana for her flowers, too.”
“Hmmm.  Just how much?”  He slipped his hand out from under Harry’s and moved it towards the button of his jeans.
, in order to be able to get away from Dudley and his goons. I’ve never ridden a two-seater, though.  But, how hard could it be?”
With everyone watching, Lucius made his way up to Draco.  Harry held his breath as he took Draco’s hand and looked at the ring on his son’s finger.  He then pulled Draco into a quick hug and then turned and gripped Harry’s hand.  “Congratulations.”
He finished his essay with a flourish of his quill, and then, after packing his things back in his bag, strode across the room towards their dorm.  As he passed behind Harry, he lightly brushed his fingers across Harry’s shoulders.
He took a deep breath once outside, enjoying the cold air as it hit his nostrils.  “I can’t believe London has gotten so much snow this early.  It’s so beautiful.”
“Well, that’s too bad, mate, because you know ‘Mione won’t stop nagging you until you answer her.”  Ron received another light slap on the arm and a scowl from his girlfriend, but Harry swallowed the snort he was about to emit when she turned her attention back to him.
Soon they were walking down a street in Diagon, on their way to a new clothing store Draco had discovered, called Brantly’s Break.
“I’m not laughing at you, mate.  I’m laughing at the excited faces on these two,” Ron said as he gestured to Hermione and Ginny.  The two did in fact have identical thrilled faces.
“Shut up! I have been able to keep that out of the news for a while now!  I’d like to keep it that way, if possible?”
Looking over at the clock, he realized he had only taken 45 minutes to get ready.  He still had nearly 5 hours to kill.  At that moment, though, his stomach decided to announce itself, so he went to get something to eat.
Not long after that, they all piled back inside where Molly had another batch of hot cocoa, and leftovers from earlier lined on the table.  They made a buffet line, and snacked and drank as they got warm.  It wasn’t too much longer after that that the yawning started to happen, so parents began packing their things up, and, after making the rounds, said goodbye and floo’d home.
He thought about all of the funerals he had attended, all the words he had spoken to the loved ones of those who died because of him.  Harry didn’t think he would ever be able to get the sound of Molly’s sobs at Fred’s funeral out of his head, for the rest of his life.
Draco could see Harry thinking back to that evening.  His eyes lit up after a few moments, saying, “Yes, actually.”  He turned and looked at Draco.  “Right before the doorbell rang, my leg got really hot.  It lasted just a couple of seconds, and then it was gone.”
“Circe, I was a bastard, huh?” He looked up at Harry, who just smiled and said, “Was?” with a shit-eating grin.
“Yeah, she was just a shoulder to lean on, and then I guess it started to become more.”  Ron pretended to shudder as he said, “why are we talking about my brother’s love life?  Change of subject, please!”
“Well, that settles that,” Hermione said with a nod.  The foursome started walking towards their common room together.  “So, Harry, when do Ron and I get to see all your hard work?”
“I’m going to go take this stuff upstairs,” Harry said, pulling the shrunken bags out of his pocket and enlarging them.  “’Mione, how about you put on the kettle, and we can have a cuppa before we have to go to the Burrow.”
While he and Hermione had been talking, Draco and Ron had snuck out.  They didn’t even know they had gone until they walked back into the room.
“I want this, too.  I’m sorry about everything.  I’ve written my father back.  I—I don’t want to talk about that right now, though.  I’ll fill you in later.  Just, can we…”
Draco looked back inside, and pulled out a glass penguin, handing it to Harry.  “I spent the day with Teddy on your birthday.  I knew I couldn’t spend the day alone, wallowing at the Manor, so I wrote to Aunt Andromeda to see if I could have him for the day.
“Ron! What's going on in here?” Hermione appeared at Harry’s elbow.  The two men sitting on the beds glanced at each other and then at the two standing in the doorway.
He nudged Draco, saying to the table, “Next round’s on me!  Would you mind helping?”  He then gave Blaise a look, who nodded slightly.
Continuing on their way, and walking past the Quidditch pitch, Harry readily changed the subject and said, “Ready for the Quidditch game in a few weeks?  Should be a great game.”
The creature hopped onto the inside sill and pushed his foot out at Harry.  He had barely gotten the letter off, before it was once again flying off into the distance.
He smiled as Harry sat plates of eggs, bangers and mash, and some fruit on the table in front of him.
The leaned in for another kiss, until they were interrupted by a loud, “UNCLE HARRY!  UNCLE DRACO!  COME ON!”
Harry turned away and walked up the stairs, pausing at the top of the landing to look back down at the two men. He couldn’t help the smile that lit up his face as he watched Draco flick his wand, casting a silencing charm, turn back towards Ron and picked up the painting again. He shook his head as he walked into the lounge.
The Gryffindors stood staring at the burly man for a few moments, before Harry snapped to and stepped forward, extending his hand.
“That is it, entirely.  I am so sick of the fighting and antagonizing.  I don’t think I would enjoy doing that every day.”
He saw Draco respond, but couldn’t hear what was being said.  He glanced over at Blaise who had his wand out, too, and was looking at Harry as if asking for permission.  Harry minutely shook his head, eyes flicking back over to the corner, just as Nott’s arm came up as if the hit Draco.  That was all it took.
They spoke with most everyone else, and then decided to go home, agreeing to see them all in the morning.
“Thank you, Harry.”  Draco was shocked when Narcissa stood and gave Harry a small hug.  Harry seemed to stand bewildered for a moment, but quickly reciprocated.  She then walked over to Draco, who was still holding Teddy, and gave him a peck on the cheek, whispering, “You look very handsome holding a baby, Draco.”
Harry had to admit, he liked having Teddy with him.  As he put him in clean clothes, he wondered idly if Andromeda would allow him to have Teddy for an entire weekend at some point.
Harry suddenly came to when he saw Hermione reach out and cautiously shake Draco’s hand.  The small relieved smile in Draco’s face said so much.
“His first comment was to remind me that I was to marry and provide an heir so that the Malfoy name would not die with me.  He next informed me that he could arrange an open marriage, so that I could still keep ‘another on the side.’”  He sneered as he used air quotes.  “Then, he went on to say that while he did not approve of my lifestyle, he did want to congratulate me on getting on your good side, as being seen with you would help bring back the Malfoy name into good standing with the public.”  Draco glared at the floor as he spoke.
“Well, your girlfriend will be arriving this evening.  It’s been a few days since you’ve seen her.  I just presumed.”
, so that should make it a little bit easier.  Right?  Maybe?”  He leant back to see Draco smile sadly at him.
“Is he… is he cheating on me?”  The last words came out strangled as Draco, for the first time, really let himself think about such a thing.  Hermione was beside him in an instant though, taking his glass out of his hand and setting it on the ground, before taking his hands.
1.  I'm sorry that this is late!  Real life is catching up to me, and I haven't had time to write the past couple of weeks.  Then yesterday, when I was supposed to update, I worked an off-Broadway show at my local theater, and didn't get home until 1:00am this morning!
“I am, as well. Would—would it be possible for me to floo into your home on Friday morning?  I am currently using my mother’s wand; if you accept that, I can then leave my mother her wand, and I will have mine to be able to call the Knight Bus.”
“Promised him that he would get a bigger room, in which those dreadful elf heads in the hall will go on the wall.  So, promise me that when you get started down here in the kitchen that will get done for him.”
Harry’s grip on him tightened as he pulled him closer against his chest.  “Oh, Draco.”  He kissed his shoulder.  “It wasn’t real.  Nothing bad is going to happen to you, I promise.”
Harry could see out of the corner of his eye that several of his classmates had wondered the same thing.  He took a quick glance over at Ron and Hermione, both of whom were giving him determined looks.
Startled, Harry dropped his arms and twisted around.  “Oi! You scared me! I thought everyone was gone; it was so quiet in here!”
Harry leant back in and kissed him gently again, before nodding at him to go sit down.  “Breakfast is almost ready.”
do that.  To anyone.  I thought you had changed, but I guess not.  How Gryffindor of me to think differently of you, huh?  Fine, leave.”
At first, he didn’t know what he was going to do with it, but then the idea of having a non-formal living space came to him.  He didn’t sleep at all that night, getting his aggression out by painting and replacing the floor and transfiguring the walls to add shelving.  He had gone shopping for furniture the day before, and while in the store, had fallen in love with a large muggle recliner.  He felt a little foolish, but it was so comfortable, he didn’t care.  He got a television and a new DVD player that the man said Harry ‘just had to have.’
They turned up the walk towards the stoop.  Harry unlocked the door, and Ron, Hermione, and Harry stepped inside.  Harry noticed Draco wasn’t behind them and turned around the see Draco still standing on the sidewalk.  Harry went back and stood at Draco’s side.
“Harry!  Hermione!  What are you two doing here?”  He bounded over, shaking Harry’s hand and giving Hermione a kiss, before ushering them into the back staff room, offering them a seat at a round table that had samples of some of what Harry guessed were new products.
year’, with lots of hostility and hatred between them.  It had taken until Christmas hols for them both to get over themselves, and for apologies to come to fruition for everyone.
He barely made it to the door when the floo flared up, emitting Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville, one-by-one.
Draco sighed quietly, before squaring his shoulders and looking Harry in the eye.  “You are Harry Potter: the chosen one; the boy who lived, the saviour of the wizarding world.”
“Good,” Draco said.  “And remember, you four are the only ones that know.  Well, you four and one.more,” he said with a wink.  “So, keep it to yourselves.  We’ll inform everyone Christmas morning.
“I just can't believe my eyes.  What happened to your three-sizes-too-big clothes, Potter? Finally realize you could have some semblance of style?”
Harry was confused as to what was happening, but took the hint when an outfit appeared on the hooks inside of the room.  He stripped down to his pants, and put the clothes on.  He stepped into trousers that seemed to be the same colour as the pair that Draco had been wearing, and the shirt was a mint green colour.
Harry leaned his head out of the dining room to look up at Draco, who was standing at the top of the first floor landing, and said, “Happy Birthday!  Can you come help me with something?  I want to get this done, and then we can go to dinner.”
Harry hummed as he set the stocking to the side.  He had to adjust his trousers in order to bed down and pick up a couple of bags with little bobs and bits in them.
Draco turned once more to face Harry, smoothly pulling his ring from his pocket and putting it on.  Harry took his hand to try and hide the ring until they were ready.
“Like I said, I did most of the cooking, from the time I was tall enough to see over the stove.  Even then, I had a step-stool so that I could reach.”  Harry again looked down at his hands.  “If I burned the food, I wasn’t allowed to eat.  If my cousin wanted another helping, I wasn’t allowed to eat.”  His eyes began to prick at he thought back.
“Whoa, wait, back up a moment.  You, Draco Lucius Malfoy, want to take a ride on a muggle bicycle?  Who are you, and what have you done with my husband?!”
Harry quickly stood up, striding from the room, knowing that Ron and Hermione would be following him.  Sure enough, just as he reached the foot of the stairs, a hand wrapped around his wrist, stopping him from moving.
“I have been avoiding Diagon Alley because of, you know, obvious reasons, so I was planning on going shopping in the muggle world.  Is that going to be a problem?”
“Finished it Tuesday night.  I decided the sitting room can be the formal room for guests, and this one can be for when I just need to relax.  I see you all have figured out the telly?”  He looked over at George, who had the remote, randomly pushing buttons.
Harry took the silk and threw it on the couch.  Holding the Hawthorne by the tip in his left hand, he pulled his wand out of his holster, swished it around the Hawthorne, and said the spell Ollivander had taught him.  “I surrender the powers that be.”  He looked up at Malfoy, who was looking at Harry.  As their eyes latched onto each other, he could feel the wand in his left hand getting warmer.
They grinned at each other as Teddy told them about school, and his teachers.  Harry loved spending time with his godson, and he knew that Draco felt the same way.
Well, that's it!  Thank you for sticking with me everyday!  This is the first time I've ever done a chapter-a-day fic, and it was rough going a few days there, but in the end, I got it done!
After breakfast, they bundled Teddy up and went out into the back garden, which had a fresh coating of fluffy white snow.  They spent the better part of two hours building a snow man, occasionally taking a break to throw snowballs at each other.
Harry startled, looking over at Draco.  He was staring at his textbook, but there was a tinge of pink high on his cheek.
They turned to see everyone looking at them.  Harry could see Ginny grinning and rolling her eyes, so he knew that it was her that had spoken.  He felt warmth fill him at the thought of her support.
“This is a new world we live in.  This is a new government we are creating.  As such, hate crimes such as this will not be tolerated.  Let this sentence set a precedent to any others that wish to pursue such acts.
Harry walked through the door on the left and found himself in a room that slightly reminded him of the dorm in Gryffindor tower, except this room was a long rectangle instead of a circle.  Two beds were on the left, two beds were on the right, and there was one bed at the very back of the room, facing the door.  There was a desk on the left side of each bed, and a wardrobe on the right.  On the right side of the room was a door that Harry assumed went to the bath.
Harry woke with a start.  He laid there for a moment, trying to figure out what had woken him.  He hadn’t been having a nightmare; quite the opposite, actually.  He listened into the room, and then he heard it: a muffled sob.  Peeking out of the curtains of his four poster, he saw the curtains of Ron’s bed swing violently.
Draco wiped his face, nodding at Harry said, “Good.  Now, let’s finish our dinner before it gets too cold.”
Harry walked toward him, pulling him into his arms.  “We can go shopping and get whatever is missing.  Hell, I’m sure we’re going to go shopping anyway, so it’s okay!”
Harry laughed, and with a wide grin, said, “It’s a lesser-known Gryffindor trait.  But you'll find that I'm full of all sorts of secrets and surprises, if you stick around long enough.”
Harry and Draco had a quick conversation, forgetting for a moment that they were not alone.  Hermione’s light cough brought them back, and soon they were descending to the next landing.
Harry’s anger loosened the tiniest bit as he had a flash-back of Ron saying something similar to that nearly a year ago.
The sat staring at the large tree and the many, many packages that sat underneath and beside the tree, as well as around the room, by families.
Instead of latching back on to Harry’s lips, he began kissing his chin, making his way down to his throat, collarbone, and then attached onto a darkened nipple.  Harry arched up when the tongue was flicked across his sensitive nub and grabbed onto Draco’s hips.
Harry woke with a start.  At first, he didn't know what woke him.  Confused, he sat up.  Sunlight was pouring in through the windows.  Reaching for his glasses, he noted the time; he’d had a nice lie-in, as it was nearing 10:00am.
“Thanks.  I decided to just get new everything.  Some of the plates and things had chips and cracks.  I chose something more to my liking.  What do you think?”  He desperately wanted her approval.
That had been nearly three months ago.  They had found themselves in the loo of the Leaky for a snog at nearly every pub night since, and then a few weeks ago, Draco had slid to his knees.  Tonight, Harry was hoping, that… Well, Harry was hoping they would end the night together, at Grimmauld.
Landing in an alley just up the road from Grimmauld, Harry peeked to see if anyone was near, then stepped out.  Draco’s hand was still clutching Harry’s arm, but he slowly released it, letting it lightly slide down the length of Harry’s arm, then letting it fall to his side.
He smiled as he reached back into the box again, and pulled out another small glass figurine, this one a gorilla.  “I got you this one, because I just can’t help but stare at your arse when you walk past, and it was the same with the gorillas.”
Teddy pulled both of their arms down the street, stopping to look at nearly everything.  He oohed and ahhed at the toy brooms, which Harry popped in and purchased while Draco kept Teddy occupied at the booth with the roasting chestnuts.  They wandered down to Twilfitt and Tatting’s where Draco told Teddy to pick something out for his nana.  He chose a gorgeous teal-coloured robe, which Harry was sure Andromeda would love.
“It’s an endearing term, now, isn’t it?”  Ron looked at Draco, bumping his shoulder.  Draco nodded back.  “Besides, it would be far too weird to call him
Ron jumped up and headed toward their dorm, but only got as far as a few steps before he turned back around, walking back towards the couch.  Bending over the back, he pecked a kiss on her cheek, whispering something in her ear.  Harry glanced up in time to see her cheeks turn pink, and then she swatted her hand at him, laughing.  Smiling, he gave her another kiss, then walked toward their room.
Seamus just laughed, and pointed to one of the tables near the window; it was covered in a buffet of foods.
Before Draco could say anything else, Kreacher had popped out of the room.  Draco turned to the women, saying, “I will just go get Harry.”  He smiled slightly at them, turning and walking quickly out of the room.
came back.”  Without thinking, he reached out and grasped Draco’s ankle.  “While Hermione apparated your mother here, Ron fire-called Blaise, who, in turn, called Pansy.  Millie was with her, so they immediately came back.  Neville, Hannah, and Ernie were still here, but as soon as Hermione went and told them what had happened, Hannah sent owls to Justin, Susan, and Michael.  They were all back within thirty minutes.  I don't know who told Seamus and Dean, but they peeked in a while ago.  Everyone is holding vigil in the common room, last I heard.”
Draco flopped himself onto the couch in the sitting room.  He could hear Harry down in the kitchen, but didn’t have the energy to go down there.
“Only that a certain tall, dark, and handsome Slytherin has had his eye on Miss Ginevra for a while now.”
They stood in the doorway for a couple minutes, watching him.  Once they knew he was asleep, they stepped back down to the lounge.  “Best send Dromeda an owl letting her know he’s in for the night, so she doesn’t worry.”
He leaned in and gave Draco a kiss as he thrust deep.  Draco screamed as he started coming, streaks of white painting Harry’s chest and hand.  Harry thrust once more, feeling Draco’s channel clench around him, and he came, too, slamming into Draco as he filled him.
“You know it will be.  They won’t come up with anything original, like ‘Poster Boy Potter to wed Mega Sexy Malfoy’ or ‘Golden Boy engaged to Snake King.’”
He stared at himself in the mirror, turning side to side.  The trousers were a bit big, and the shirt didn’t fit right in the shoulders.  He was about to say something when the door was suddenly opened and an elf stepped in.
Harry turned again to go up the stairs, and again Hermione grabbed his wrist, but he just pulled her along, Ron following in their wake.  Once they were up in his bedroom, Harry waved his wand, silencing charm falling in place around the door.
Pulling Draco towards him, again, Harry let out a moan as both of their engorged organs brushed against each other.  Harry didn’t even mind that there were layers of clothing separating them when he began pushing Draco to lean up against the wall that he had been previously working on.
As they walked towards the apparition point, Harry unclasped his hand from Draco’s and wrapped it around Draco’s back.  He stuck his thumb in the belt loop on Draco’s hip.
Narcissa was surprised and please to find that she was presented with a knitted lap blanket, in the palest blue Draco had ever seen.  “Something to keep you warm while you read,” Molly said with a small smile.
“Well, we had lunch with Kingsley, and told him Draco’s side of things, and then we talked Wandlore, and the renovations at Grimmauld, and then the changes that are happening in the Ministry.  We’ve had a pretty great afternoon, actually.”
Walking back into the house, Draco headed for the kitchen, with Harry following.  As Harry grabbed plates and silverware, Draco removed the food from the bags.  As they sat across from each other, Harry chanced a glance up at Draco’s face.  Draco was staring right back at Harry.
Walking back over to the table, he again rubbed his owl’s head.  “Okay, mate.  I don’t think you would appreciate apparition, so when you are ready, head on up to Hogwarts.  I’ll come see you in the owlery tomorrow, and maybe I’ll have an idea as to what to call you.”  The bird hooted at Harry, and took out the window.
Harry led them down to the second floor landing, opening up the door to the room that was where Ginny and Hermione had slept.  “I think I want to make this into an office of sorts.  Put shelves around the edges for books and the like, and then a large desk in the center.  This is what I drew up.”
“After, he suddenly jumped up and said that we couldn’t be together anymore.  He gave me no real reason, just saying that he was tainted, and it could never work because he was a Death Eater, and I was Harry Potter.  Then he left.  The whole conversation lasted less than five minutes.”
“Right.”  Harry stood, reaching for the ornaments, and stepped over to the tree, placing them all in the middle of the tree, so they could be seen from all angles.  “We will leave you to it.”  He reached for Draco’s hand, and pulled him up the stairs.
He turned and cast a charm to send them over to the tree.  He looked back at Draco.  “What else is in this box of yours?”
year.  They had talked through quite a few arguments over the years, all whilst tossing a quaffle.  The first time was in mid-February during their 8
After what felt like hours, but was probably only around three minutes, Harry finally started talking.
“Oh, yes, I can, because like I’ve said before: if they even think about accusing you of doing anything, I will go all ‘Harry Potter, Boy Who Lived To Save The Wizarding World’s Arse’ on them.”
“Well, you two were spending a lot of time together, working.  I was sure something was going to come of it.  I just thought it had happened much sooner than it apparently had.”
Kreacher seemed to perk up at the thought of entertaining.  “Why did master not call Kreacher back sooner?  Kreacher would have had everything already done.”
Before Draco could respond, their waiter walked up to the table.  Draco ordered a bottle of wine, and Harry ordered their dinner:  After their first date, every time they came to Marcella’s, they always got the same thing.  Draco would always get the stuffed calamari, which Harry was always disgusted by, and Harry would always get the chicken parmesan, to which Draco would call him a plebeian.  It was tradition.
“I can think of a few ways,” Harry smiled, pushing Draco’s face back towards his and taking his swollen bottom lip between his teeth.  Draco moaned, and smashed his lips against Harry’s.
“I saw Draco in Diagon Alley a few days before we went back to Hogwarts, and we made plans to meet so that I could give him his wand back.  We did the ritual, just as Ollivander said to, but apparently our magic is just too powerful, because we both felt as if our entire arms were being burnt off.”
“It is, believe me.  I’ve been working with George on the weekends since term started, though, so I have it.  And besides, she’s worth it, you know?”
He was just holstering his wand when he heard Hermione’s voice calling for him.  He made his way down the stairs towards the sitting room, where Hermione was standing waiting on him.
“What in the actual fuck are you two doing?!” Harry said loudly, scaring the two men, making them lose their grip on the painting and causing it to fall back to the ground. Harry could see Walburga’s face get redder as she silently screamed in the frame.
Draco seemed to flinch as he looked at the ground.  He took a breath, slowly looking up at Harry’s face.  “Can we talk?”
“Sure I do.  Neither of us had more than a few chips to eat last night.  I know I’m starving, so I can only imagine how you’re feeling.”
Rounding the corner and walking into the sitting room, Harry was awash with his earlier thoughts in the shower.  Malfoy was dressed again in a button-up shirt, with the top two undone.  Harry could see the faint beginnings of a line of blond hair on the white, silky skin.  Malfoy’s hair had gotten longer since the trials, and he seemed to have stopped using gel, instead letting it fall free around his ears.
Glancing at his roommates, he hurriedly went and claimed the bed closest to the door on the left.  He pulled his trunk out of his pocket, sat it on the floor, and waved his wand, expanding it back to its normal size.  He started pulling things out of the chest, putting his books and supplies on his desk, and then started to walk around the bed to put his clothes into the wardrobe.  As he did, he noticed who had taken which bed.  Ron was straight across from him, with Neville to Ron’s left.  Zabini was standing next to the bed and the very back, which left Draco with the bed right next to Harry.
As they entered the room, they both automatically went to their side of the bed, laying their wands down, undressing, taking off their watches, Harry, his glasses, and then crawling into bed.
Harry walked over to them.  Grinning, he leaned over to Teddy, saying, “Oh, great.  Now you’re taking his side?  Huh?  I see how it is!”  He reached out and tickled Teddy, who was giggling and gurgling.  “Here, wrap your arms around him, again.”
Draco broke his wrists from Harry loose grip, wrapping them around Harry’s neck and tugging him back down into a languid kiss. Harry broke it momentarily to carefully extricate himself from inside Draco, but quickly slipped his tongue back into the warm mouth as he turned them so that they were lying on their sides, facing each other, letting each other catch their breath.
“I'll be here.” He pecked Harry on the cheek with a chuckle when Harry reached in front of him to open the door, before stepping out onto the front stoop.  “Bye.”
“Good morning, Darling!  Here’s your coffee, and the memos that were waiting for me this morning,” she said brightly.
“Yes. Harry is worried about the house not getting finished before Christmas, and I asked if you were helping him this weekend.”
Apparently his awe shone on his face, because when Harry looked back at him, he received a questioning look.
Harry stopped in the middle of the hall, and gave Draco a confused look.  “Girlfriend?  What are you talking about?”
They smiled at him as he hugged Fleur again, and gripped Bill’s hand in a firm handshake.  “Congratulations!  I had no idea!”
“What are you up to, Harry?” She tried sounding nonchalant, but Harry knew her too well; it came out accusatory.
“Yeah, he is,” Draco said with the beginnings of a loopy grin appearing on his face.  He quickly snapped out of it, replacing it with a stoic look, instead.  “I mean, I guess.  For a baby.”  He reached back out and took Teddy from Harry’s arms, though.
Harry slammed Draco against the door, pushing their mouths together forcefully.  He tugged on the back of his head, pulling a fistful of hair, as he rutted against him.
She sighed, glancing at her husband.  “Why did both of our children have to be born only two days apart?  And so close to Christmas, too?”
“Let’s go down to the kitchen, then,” Harry said, turning around and walking out of the room.  He stopped on the landing, making sure Malfoy was following him.  Seeing that he was behind him, Harry continued down the stairs into the front hallway.  “Mind the last step,” he said quietly, avoiding hitting the umbrella stand that was sitting just beside the stairs.  Why Harry hadn’t destroyed that thing yet, he didn’t know.
They didn’t sit in silence for too long, though; because after a few moments, the sound of the floo flaring rang through the room, just as they heard the front door open and close.
They sat there in silence for a few moments before Narcissa said, “Well, it is just about the time I said I would be here.  Is it fine if I go up to attic?”
“I would like that very much.”  He leaned over and gave her a kiss on her cheek.  She smiled at him as she stepped towards the stairs.  She waved goodbye, as did Teddy, and they disappeared up the stairs.
Harry summoned the new plates that he had bought for the occasion, starting to set the table.  Ron was placing glasses on the table when he broke the silence.
As they walked towards the main part of the city, hand-in-hand, Draco asked Harry, “How are you feeling?”
Harry gave him a wide smile before leaning over and giving him a kiss.  “Come on, let’s go figure out what else we need for the kitchen.”
“Yeah,” he muttered with a sigh.  “Might as well get it over with.”  He watched as she nodded and quickly walked over to where Ron was standing.
Harry opened his eyes to find a flushed Draco, bruised lips and all, standing before him, breathing just as hard as Harry was.
Draco chuckled, as he rubbed Harry’s arm.  “Come on, whiney baby.  We’ll both be late if we’re not careful.”
“Absolutely.”  Harry sighed as he turned and leant back into Draco’s chest, watching Teddy pick up two boxes and bring them back to the sofa.  He turned his head, letting Draco lean in and give him a kiss.
He would forever remember the way the castle looked after the end of the war, all of the rubble that was strewn across the grounds.  He was impressed and very glad that everyone that was a part of the renovations were able to get everything back to perfection before school began.
Harry could hear the catch in his throat, and the tears that were threatening to pool up in his eyes. He sat back into the corner of the couch, and pulled Draco down to lay in between his legs and the back of the sofa, resting his head on Harry’s chest.
They stepped into the alley where they usually disapparated from.  Harry turned so they were facing each other.  He wrapped his other arm around Draco, too, turning on the spot.  They landed in another alley on the other side of London, which was about a block away from Marcella’s.
Harry knew his face was turning a deeper shade of pink, but he didn’t care.  “Huh.  Wonder if my gay flare for design will ever show up.  That would be mighty helpful with all this decorating stuff.”
Harry leaned up, bringing their lips together once more.  Draco opened his mouth, issuing a silent plea for Harry to invade it.  Harry took a quick swipe with his tongue, then pulled Draco’s tongue into his mouth.  Their tongue’s danced in their mouths for a few moments, and then Draco’s head jumped back, causing them both to breath hard.
Harry sighed and leaned back into Draco’s arms.  Draco tightened his grip around Harry to keep Harry’s weight up.  Draco rubbed his face against Harry’s hair, and then hesitantly dipped his head down to lightly kiss Harry’s neck, just  below his hairline.  He paused a moment, and then kissed Harry again, just under his earlobe.
“Professor Slughorn had to cancel our class for this afternoon, so we are getting a start to our weekend.”
Harry could not believe how fast this morning had flipped.  Just a few hours ago, Harry had stood staring at a sleeping Draco, pure joy coursing through his body.  Not even fifteen minutes, he’d had Draco’s cock in his mouth, and now…  Well, he didn’t want to think about it.
Thanking Kreacher, who popped back out of the room, Harry began to pull the blanket back to get out when his bedroom door was opened.  Looking up, he saw Draco standing in the doorway.
“Ah, Mr Potter!  Thank you for coming!  I wanted to show you how well it was coming along.  What do you think?”
He pulled his sketch book out of his pocket, and showed it to the three others.  Draco took a quick look at it, and then scanned the room.
They all gathered in the lounge, hugging and talking over one another.  Lucius looked like he wished he was anywhere else, but was pulled into a conversation by Blaise, and soon looked like he was at least moderately enjoying himself.
He took the steps back up to the bedroom two at a time.  He walked back in and saw that Draco was exactly where he had left him.
He waited a beat, and then did it again. This time, the door was opened, and as he walked inside the room, he saw that Draco was sitting at the foot of Harry’s bed, with Ron at the foot of his own, facing each other.
The leant back into each other, lips finally touching in a searing kiss.  Harry’s left arm clutched at Draco’s hip, while his right hand wrapped around the back of Draco’s head, tugging lightly on the blond strands of hair on his nape.  Harry opened his mouth in a moan, letting Draco slide his tongue in.
“Oh, shit! I just realized you have to pay in muggle money! We didn’t go to Gringott’s before we came!” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear.
, he thought to himself.  Putting his trunk into his pocket, he heard the familiar sound of the floo flare, and then a hesitant “P-Potter?”
He heard a small chuckle outside his curtain and then swallowed the potion in one go. The taste of rotten eggs assaulted his taste buds, but then just as quickly, it changed to peppermint.  His head cleared instantly, and he felt he could move without vomiting all over his bed and himself.
“Draco and I were just talking about going to the library to get started on this Charms essay.  What are you doing?”
He kissed him long and deep before pulling back and saying, “You know what you do to me, and that’s why you do it.  You’re lucky I know you, as well,” as he leant back, cast a hurried lubrication charm on himself, picked Draco’s legs up—bending him nearly in half—pulled the toy out, and thrust into the clenched heat in one go.  Draco screamed in pleasure as Harry moaned in relief.
’ ‘As many times as it takes to sink in.’ The thing was, it was with a… a blood quill.” Harry took another swig from his glass, before continuing.
Draco couldn't take his eyes off of the emerald orbs staring at him.  A warmth flashed through him at the thought that his classmates, majority of whom he had either been a complete git to, made their lives total hell, or didn’t even acknowledge their existence during their tenure at Hogwarts, came back early from their weekend for
Harry tried again, carefully extricating his arm from under Draco, and sliding so that he could move back towards the edge of the bed.  Once he was fully removed from Draco’s hold, he quickly got up and made his way into the en-suite.  After a few minutes, he returned to the side of his bed, taking a moment to admire the sleeping blond, who had turned back over onto his side.
“Yeah. Actually Draco and I were thinking of having a party this weekend. Celebrate my homecoming and what not.  Don’t know full details yet, but be expecting an owl.”
“Yes, please,” Draco moaned, pressing his lips to Harry’s, and pulling his shirt tails out of his pants.  “I like presents.”  He scratched his nails against Harry’s back, causing him to moan.
“I—I don’t know.  Maybe?  Like I said, I’ve gotten to really know him the past few months.  He’s…I don’t even know how to describe it.  I know it’s crazy, and way too fast, but I’ve never felt like this before.”
Draco was trying not to laugh, but once he caught Harry’s eyes, he couldn’t help the grin that graced his face.  Harry mouthed to his neighbor, “You?!”  Receiving a slight nod, Harry couldn’t help the giggle-snort that emitted from him.
Taken aback from the offhanded compliment, Draco replied with a cheeky grin, “This is true.  However, she could be worse.  I mean, really, the old Gryffindor seeker was as bad as it could get.”
He slowly made his way down the stairs, occasionally peeking into a room, when he heard a loud bang and a muffled curse word coming from what he imagined was the kitchen.  He picked up his pace and smiled when he stepped into the room and saw Harry stood at the hob.
Draco smiled tiredly, rubbing the spot where the welt was.  “The public didn’t react this bad when we started dating
Draco smiled a sad smile, leaning forward again to kiss Harry. He sat there a moment, looking back at that photo, and then turned and picked up the next one.
“Yeah?  Well, I’m not, so there you go.”  Harry huffed a heavy sigh as he stood up and walked towards the door.  He made sure not to look at either of his friends as he started down the stairs.
“Not a lot.  That’s part of the problem.  I walked in from work, thinking he would be ready and just waiting on me, but no.  He was laying on the sofa, sweatpants on, eating biscuits and watching the telly.  He had no idea what I was talking about, and then just refused to come.”
Harry snuggled further into the bed, pulling Draco towards him so that his front was wrapped around Draco’s back.  He pressed a kiss under Draco’s ear before he whispered, “Nah, you won’t.”
Harry walked back into the Great Hall, going to tell McGonagall he was going.  He hadn't told his friends what he was working on just yet, so as he stepped away from the staff table, Hermione came over to him.
Draco could see tears running down Harry’s face, too.  “I didn’t know how to tell you I was damaged.  That I needed help.  I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.”
“Just a sec.”  Harry ran back up to his bedroom, grabbing the jumper that he had pulled out of his closet earlier.  Slipping it on, he patted his pockets to make sure he had everything.  Stepping back down to the second floor landing and moving into the sitting room to lock that floo, he had a thought.
He stepped into the bathroom, looking at himself in the mirror.  I’m getting married, today, he thought to himself.  Merlin, he couldn’t wait.  It had only taken a few months of actually being with Draco for him to realize that this was his long-term goal.  He knew that he could never live without him in his life, so in the end, it would have to be all or nothing.
“Shhh, Teddy.  Uncle Harry isn’t a morning person,” Draco said, finally opening his eyes and taking in the sight of the two lying beside him.  “Nor am I.  Come on, snuggle up and let us sleep a little bit longer, and then we will make a snowman.  Promise.”
He gestured for Draco to sit on the edge of the bed, and then swiftly walked out of the door with the letters.  He quickly went down to the study, where Noa was sat on her perch.  Harry attached the letters to her, and after giving her some treats, opened the window and let her out.
“Oh, yes, Ron did mention that you had become friends.  I’m so glad.  I know his father has done some terrible things, and he was forced into a lot of it as well, but he was just a boy.  You all were.”  She sighed, turning back to the stove.  “I’m proud of you for letting bygones be bygones, and moving forward with your lives, though.  Will he and his mother be joining us today?  There will be plenty of food.”  She glanced back at Harry.
After they had all gotten some money, the quartet made their way to Madam Malkin’s.  Since they had been gone a year, and both Ron and Harry had grown taller during that time, it was determined that they would need new school robes.
Harry made sure the angle was right, and then started short, fast drives, pounding against Draco’s prostate.  He glanced down and saw Draco’s purple cock was thumping against his stomach, leaking an abundance of pre-come out of the tip.
Harry was finishing wiping down his clothes and checking his pockets, when he heard a quiet, “Hey,” behind him.  Turning, he saw Draco standing in the doorway of his bedroom.  He was wearing black fitted trousers and a dark grey button-up shirt.  Harry felt his own trousers tighten as blood fled south.
“Okay, so, for our anniversary, I had considered taking you on holiday, but then we had that big undercover raid in Bristol in May, you couldn’t get away from work during the summer, and then… I got sick.  So, I just hid the travel itinerary, and pushed it off.
After riding around for nearly an hour, they returned the bike and then decided to finish their Christmas shopping; they still needed to get something for Molly, Ginny, and Andromeda.
With that in mind, he slid off the bed, pulling Draco closer to him.  Making himself comfortable in between Draco’s legs, he opened the button and slowly unzipped the two halves of Draco’s trousers, pulling the flaps apart.  He pulled Draco’s trousers off of his hips; Draco lifted up, giving him an easier time of it.  Once they were pooled around his knees, Harry’s smoothly removed them completely.  Now, Draco was just in a pair of black, silk boxers.
A warm, fluttering feeling entered Draco’s chest as he gazed at the gorgeous man sitting beside him.
It was Wednesday afternoon and Harry was lounging on the couch, alone in the common room, Transfiguration book propped up on his slightly bent knees, trying to change the table into a teapot wandlessly.  A sudden, odd, prickly feeling formed at the back of his neck, and bending his head back, he saw Draco smiling down on him.
Before he could really start thinking how he wanted to set things up, Harry heard the floo flare up.  He stepped out into the hall and saw Hermione, Ron, and Ginny step out of the fire.
It took a split second, and then there were screams coming from one corner of the room, where Narcissa and Molly were both seated, hands gripped together.  They turned and hugged each other before they both jumped up and raced towards Harry and Draco.
“Whenever I wrote the lines on the parchment, it would cut into my hand, and the ink would be my blood.” He practically whispered the last bit, looking down at the ground.  There were gasps from around the circle.
She patted him on one cheek, and kissed the other, and then went over and did the same to Harry.  Harry kissed her back, shook hands with Arthur as he let go of Draco’s hand, and then they floo’d to Grimmauld.
“Oh, he definitely has.  Anyway, we started out with breakfast in Piccadilly.  I’ll have to take you there soon; it is delicious.  While we were eating, I kept asking him what he wanted to do.  At first, he kept asking if we could go see you.  It broke my heart to tell him we couldn’t, and he just couldn’t understand why not.”  Draco gave Harry a sad smile, who returned it, genuinely.
“Well, the offer stands.  But, please finish your lunches.  And tell me, what kind of renovations have you been doing to that old, dank, dark house?”
“So, that was the portrait of my great aunt, you said?  Seems like a lovely woman,” he added, sarcastically.
“Harry, I thought I told you to clean off the bed, last night.  There’s a giant lump in the middle of it!”
“We’ve had some decent conversations the past couple of months, and I finally have a chess opponent that can beat me!  He has a wicked sense of humour, too.  As does Blaise.  You know, the Slytherin’s aren’t half bad.”
“That explains this,” he said, glancing down at his partially naked chest, except for the white gauze that encircled his ribs, “but why is my arm bandaged?” He tried to weakly pick it up, but Harry was right there to make sure he didn't strain himself.
“Harry? What are you doing home?  I told you to stay at work!”  He stood at at the top of the next landing, having come out of the study.
“Harry’s been thinking, everyone!  Take precautions, now!”  Seamus shouted from the other end of the room.
When they finished, Harry decided now was as good as any, and started down to the Great Hall; McGonagall went ahead and readied the press.  As Harry walked in, he was assaulted by flashbulbs and his name being called from a dozen different directions.  A
Getting to the Apparition point, he swiftly pulled out his wand and twisted, hurtling himself through space and landed in front of the brick wall that led to the Leaky Cauldron.  He grinned at the sight of the people that meandered their way down the alley; it had been so sparse of people for far too long.
“They are all in the library, studying.  I needed to work on my transfiguration, though, so I was given a reprieve; I don’t think Madam Pince would be too pleased if I continuously transfigured her library tables into inanimate objects.  Hermione agreed, and so allowed me to stay here.”
Floating between two buildings, smack in the middle of the main road, was a giant angel, completely lit up with fairy lights.  It was breath-takingly beautiful, and both of them couldn’t take their eyes off it and they walked closer to where it was hung.
Draco stepped up next to Seamus as he tipped his glass up at Draco.  “Ya need to get caught up, mate!” he said jubilantly, before tipping his head back and swallowing the firewhiskey in one go.
“I thought we were getting to know each other!  We were telling each other things about our childhoods and I felt like I was learning about the real Draco Malfoy.  How foolish of me to think that.  No, I once again saw the cold features of the git I’ve known since I was eleven cover your face, and vile words spew from the lips that not ten minutes before were moving against mine.”
As they were finishing their breakfast the next morning, Harry went over to the Gryffindor table and chatted with someone.
They kissed once again, before Harry pulled back and smiled at him.  “Are you ready for that dessert, now?”
She turned to him, sensing that need, and said, “It’s lovely!  I can’t wait until you invite us over and cook us a delicious meal,” she added with a wink.
He looked towards the door to see Bev walking in with a letter in her hand.  “This just came for you.  Looks like Draco’s handwriting.”
“Harry, I’m sorry, but I have to get back to work.  We only have three hours before the foreign ministers get here for the final inspection, and it opens just an hour later.  Can we please finish this later?”
Throughout all of the commotion, it wasn’t until Draco sighed in pleasure and exhaustion that Harry realized that he had come too, completely untouched.
Harry gave him a cheeky grin.  “Yeah.  Four-and-a-half months is far too damn long of a time to not have regular sex!  I’m only 24!  I can’t live like that!”
“Oh, we were in Ireland, following a lead on the potions ring, and we had hidden up in the rafters of this old barn.  Andrews had gone out to see if anyone was coming, when I heard a creak.  I turned around to look behind me, stepped wrong, and accidentally fell out of the ceiling.  I landed hard on my left arm.  Nothing was broken, but it was really sore.  I could have used a massage, though.  That would have fixed me up.”
Exactly 33 minutes later, they joined Teddy down in the sitting room.  Luckily, he had listened, and was (im)patiently waiting on everyone else to come down.  As Harry walked in the room, he jumped up from his seat at the table, which was covered in a large Christmas breakfast, and ran over to jump up and down in front of Harry.
Harry laughed, as he went back to his closet and pulled out his favourite leather jacket.  He pulled on his coat before helping Draco into his.  They then clasped hands and walked down the stairs.  Harry released his hand to open the front door, let Draco out first, locked it behind them, and then immediately took it back into his once they reached the sidewalk, giving it a kiss.
Draco spat into the sink and rinsed his mouth out before turning to lean against the counter.  He sighed as he crossed his arms.  “He asked me if you were doing better.”
After a while, they said their goodbyes and stopped at a little café, as Teddy was starting to complain he was hungry.  As they ate, sitting by the window and watching witches and wizards rush up and down the alley, Harry and Draco started talking more about the wedding.
He didn't get a chance to finish his sentence, though, because his lips were suddenly being smashed against Harry’s.  It took a split second for Draco to realize what was happening, but once he did, Harry felt a jolt of pleasure as the kiss was reciprocated.  Harry’s gloved hands made their way up to cup Draco’s head, whilst Draco’s wrapped themselves around Harry’s waist.  As they continued to kiss, a warmth exploded in both of them, weaving its way up their bodies, and then exploding out of their lips.  They both jumped back as if they had been burned.
He picked up the letter again, and went down to the floo.  Picking up a bit of powder, he stepped into the fireplace and called out, “The Burrow!”
“He had to run some errands for his mother, but he should be here any minute.  Okay, so as you remember, this was Sirius’s old room…”
The alarm was what woke Harry up next.  Groggily, he turned over.  He didn’t hear much noise in the dorm, so he figured he was the last one up, and everyone else had already gone down to breakfast.
No, Harry was kneeling in front of him, holding a small box with a glistening ring set inside of it.  Draco gasped, hands covering his mouth, as he realised what was happening.
Harry and Draco looked at each other, smiles that equaled Ron’s spreading across their faces.  “Wicked,” Harry breathed.  “I have two more sentences to write, and then I'll be done. Are you going home, Ron?”
Draco looked at the photo, which showed a picturesque sitting room.  Underneath the coffee table sat a large rug with splashes of black, white, grey, purple, blue, maroon, and turquoise all through it, with a large black border.
After the war, while they were renovating the house, Harry had turned the old garden shed into a shed sort of like Arthur’s.  He would call the man over, and they would spend hours in that tiny room, playing with muggle items, giving both of them something else to think about for a time.
He pulled it out and opened to see, sure enough, the notice that the Ministry would be sponsoring a Holiday Market Fair this year, with cooperation from France, Bulgaria, Romania, and several other European countries.
Harry laughed as he watched his excited husband.  “Calm down, calm down!  Here.  Here is what I had originally planned.”  He reached out his hand and cast a wandless and wordless accio, causing an envelope to come flying out of the drawer that Ron had been searching through.
“Nonsense, Harry.  It will be fabulous no matter what it looks like. And besides, isn't Draco helping?” Hermione gave him a pointed look.
Narcissa smiled at him, nodding.  She glanced over at Draco as he sat down less than an arm’s length away from Harry.
They walked out of the dorm, and over to the window sill where Ron had set up the board.  Draco sat across the board from Ron, right leg curled under him and left dangling over the edge: the mirror image of Ron.
“I don’t know, Professor!  He was supposed to come over for dinner, but when he arrived, he was like this.  Please.”
Draco’s own muscles had gotten tighter and tighter as Harry told his tale.  He hated hearing about Harry getting hurt, or worse, seeing it happen.  He took a deep breath as Harry relaxed back against him, trying to keep calm and not cry.
They started towards the house.  About half-way up the block, Harry realized that he was still holding Draco’s hand.  His insides lurched and his cheeks flushed a bit.  He went to pull his hand free, but found that Draco refused to let go of it.  This made him blush even more, but a huge grin graced his face as he looked up into the grey eyes of the blond, who also sported a massive grin.
“Do you like it?  I wasn’t sure if…”  Draco couldn’t take his eyes off of the white gold band.  There was a diamond in-laid into the gold, with an Alexandrite gemstone on one side, and a Ruby on the other.
Around 6:00, McGonagall floo’d back to Hogwarts, and as Teddy was beginning to fuss, Andromeda left as well.  Harry went and helped Molly pack up the food—the food that she didn’t insist was to stay with Harry—and helped take it back to the Burrow, while the rest of the Weasley’s packed up the piles of presents they had received.
Harry grinned, moving up to pull Draco into a kiss, tasting both of them on their tongues.  “Oh, just you wait babe,” Harry said against his lips.  “That was nothing.”
They were interrupted by Harry setting the food and drinks on the table.  “What’s all this?”  He looked between them, tears in both their eyes.
“Harry, of course you could never replace her,” Hermione told him.  “No one is asking you to.  But, maybe it's time to think about getting one.”
He couldn’t believe they were here.  Draco had chosen the spot where their feud had begun; the place where they had hated each other for seven long years.  But, this was also the place where they let bygones be bygones, and became friends.  This was the place where they had spent many an hour sitting next to each other in the common room, talking about anything and everything.  Talking of their hopes; of their fears.
He was brought out of his reverie by Teddy poking his cheek.  He laughed as Draco yelped in surprise, and then started laughing when Draco countered by tickling him.
He sat down on the couch, and pulled Harry down next to him. They sat staring at each other, before Draco took a deep breath and leaned in to kiss Harry. Harry hummed as he leant into the kiss.
Soon, more people began leaving, helping drunk friends make their way home.  Harry stood in the hallway, wishing his guests a good night and happy new year as they either floo’d or left through the front door to apparate.
Taking a deep breath, he tried to keep the tears that were filling his eyes at bay.  “I was unbelievably furious when you got away with things.  Of bloody
Draco had lit candles and placed them all around the room.  The bath was full of water and the sweet smell of camomile and lavender wafted across to where Harry stood.
“What now,” he mumbled to himself as he reached for the memo’s she handed him.  Stepping into his office, he was surprised to see Ron sitting on the couch.
Harry watched as the small group of the Wizengamot, a mere 14 people, stood and followed Kingsley to a chamber of the room.  He turned back to see Mr Stotts turn to talk to Draco, and then stand and go over to speak with the other solicitor.  Draco stood and walked over to where Narcissa, Harry, and McGonagall sat.
He opened the door, and then beckoned for them to follow him up a small staircase that led out onto a roof terrace.  He stepped back and with another wave of his wand, fairie lights were lit, causing the group to see a large space with high brick walls.  It was kind of bare, as Harry hadn’t really been able to work a whole lot up there, but he hoped that by the summer it would be a proper place.
“I think so.  I’m glad it was decided that we would host this year, because I dread the thought of having to carry all of this over to the Burrow.”
Harry moved in and kissed Draco again, as he wrapped his arms around to cup his hands over Draco’s arse, pulling their groins together.  This caused Draco to moan loudly, as he could feel Harry’s obvious arousal.
He pulled him up off the bed, wrapping him in a hug. They stood there for several moments, until Draco pulled back, and pushed Harry towards the door.
“Very funny, Potter.  He just thinks he’s so funny, doesn’t he?”  Draco looked down at Teddy, who he was still holding in the harness.  Teddy giggled as Draco lightly pinched his cheeks.
, well, that was a turn-on all its own, and suddenly he didn’t care that he was inexperienced.  He felt his erection grow.
Draco glanced at Harry before turning and looking at Blaise.  “I’m sure neither of us have any idea what you’re talking about.”  He smirked and leant back against Harry’s chest.
“You’re welcome.”  He took in Draco’s face, and saw the anger and fear in his eyes.  “Want to talk about it?”
“I’m definitely not hungry.  She handed me some more sandwiches right before we left,” Harry said, pulling out a little package from his pocket.  “I say we just nibble on these for supper, and do curry tomorrow.”
Harry went into the en-suite and brushed his teeth.  Swiping a brush through his locks, he quickly gave up and went back out to stand in front of Draco.
“You dumped a lot of information on me, Tuesday.  While I still wish you had told me everything when it happened, now that I’ve had a bit of time to think about it, I guess I kind of understand why you didn’t.  I’m sorry I got angry.”
“You know, you toss it to me, I catch it, and then toss it back.  We don’t have to talk, if you don’t want, but I’m here if you want to vent.”
Harry had sped out of the Common Room in order to get away from everyone staring at him.  He had to come up with some way for his friends to understand what he was trying to do.  His ‘new beginning’ wasn’t going as he had planned.  As he walked into the Great Hall, he noticed that he was not the first one to enter.  Draco was sitting at the end of the table, with his head in his hands.  Harry walked up to the table.
Draco leant in and kissed him.  Harry opened his mouth in a moan, letting Draco slip in and trace the inside of his mouth with his tongue.
Harry could feel his eyes start to prick behind his lids.  He blearily opened his eyes, turning back to look at the blond, mouthing an
“Close your eyes.  I am going to apparate us to the location of our dessert, but it’s a surprise.  Close your eyes.”
He led Harry over to a set of tables and chairs, sitting down.  Harry sat across from him, setting the food down.  He opened the containers to show Draco food from their favorite Italian restaurant just down the road from their home.
As the door swung completely open, the two men released their lips and gently pressed the foreheads together.  They both heard a groan from Ron as he stepped into the room and saw them, before he yelped as the bottles came flying at him.
“Complicated magic that insisted I still call Privet Drive ‘home’ so that I could one day kill Voldemort.  As soon as I turned 17, though, I left and have never looked back.”
He stood back up and looked at Hermione, who was watching him.  He could tell she was trying to analyze his face, and Harry’s absence, but seemed to think better of it as she suddenly said, “come on,” with a toss of her head.  “Let’s get you a drink.”
They stepped out of the fireplace, waving a hello to Tom, and then walked out back to the brick wall that led into Diagon Alley.
“No, you don’t!”  Draco screamed as he crossed the room, causing Harry to jump, tears pooling in his eyes.  “You don’t know me!  You don’t know anything about me!  This could never work!  I’m tainted.  You’re Harry Potter, Saviour, and I’m Draco Malfoy, Death eater.  That’s all you need to know about me!”
to show affection, until you kissed me.  Salazar!  Just the fact that I feel comfortable enough to tell you all of this, shows how much you have changed me!  What have you done to me, Potter?!”  Draco, who had been laying on his back looking at the ceiling while saying all of this, finally turned and looked at Harry, who was smiling at him.
Harry showed Ron the newly finished room.  Windows lined the back wall, looking over the garden.  Harry had bought two long divans, one sitting underneath the windows, the other jutting out towards the door, making a large L shape.  In the open space behind the second divan sat a small work table and chairs.
“Oi!  Have you two kissed and made up, yet?  There’s only twenty minutes until midnight and we need to get to the champagne out of the fidgermarator!”
“Fuck! You feel amazing,” Harry moaned, as he pushed his hips up to greet Draco’s downward thrust.  “I… I have to…!  Ah!”
“Get married.  The question that they kept asking was when the big day was.  I think, once you’re married, they will have to find something else to gossip about.”
Now that they were together, though, it seemed imminent that it would happen.  Draco was determined to do it on
As they sat in the dining room, eating their breakfast, Harry gently nudged his toe into Draco’s ankle.  “What do you want to do, today?”
“No, seriously, Draco.  Do you not think I would have understood what you were going through if you had told me?  I have been wracking my brain for nearly two weeks, trying to figure out what in the hell I had done wrong for you to have said those things to me.  I couldn’t fathom what was going on, because you didn’t talk to me!”
No sooner had the thought crossed his mind when he heard, “Oi! Ferret! Fancy a game?”  Ron was standing beside the window, holding up his chess board.  Draco looked up from where he was sitting next to Pansy, smile forming on his face.
Harry laughed.  “Thank you, sir.  Not sure quite yet what my plans are after school, but I’ll keep that in mind.”
“Are you okay?”  He patted Draco down, checking for injuries.  He paused when Draco started to pull up his trouser leg.
They stepped into the bedroom, and Harry walked over to the closet.  He shucked his cloak off, followed by his trousers and button up shirt and tie.
After deciding on the couch, two chairs, a coffee table, four end tables, and a few accent pieces, both men were satisfied.  The salesman that was helping them had taken all of the tags up to the front.  They were following him, when suddenly Harry stopped dead in his tracks and grabbed Draco’s sleeve.  Seeing the look of fear in Harry’s eyes, Draco stopped and asked what was wrong.
Draco stared at the man before him, wondering what was going on.  This was the most they had spoken in weeks.  But, seeing the fear and trepidation in Harry’s eyes, Draco couldn’t make himself say no.  He had missed him so damned much.
“If it wasn’t for Harry, I would be.  Actually, if it wasn’t for Harry, I would be dead.  We all would.  I don’t want to fight.  I just... I just want to be.”  With that, he made his way across the common room and out the door.
“I know.  I don’t know what I was thinking.”  He sifted his hands through Harry’s hair, causing Harry to moan lightly and tilt his head as if to follow Draco’s hand.
He was right.  He was woken up by two knobby knees in the stomach, as Teddy tried to crawl over him to get in the middle of the bed.
Draco looked crushed as Harry spoke to him.  Harry couldn’t understand the emotions that were flicking across Draco’s face as the blond walked solemnly over to the side table, where their breakfast was still sitting, completely forgotten.  “Here’s my wand for your meeting with Ollivander.  I will come by later to pick it up.”
The blush that appeared on Ron’s face had nothing to do with the winter air that swept by their table as several people came through the door.  “Well, er, you see…”  He smiled weakly at Harry, as he sat back down at the table.  Harry sat down across from him.  “I wanted to get Hermione a necklace, and I knew that if I bought it in Diagon, somehow, some way, it would get back to her, and I really want it to be a surprise.”
to befriend Malfoy.  She had been getting to know Draco, studying together, working on projects together, etc., and knew that they would get along if they would just get over themselves.
After a few moments of Draco just standing there, starting at him, Harry huffed and said, “Well?  Are you going to help me, or are you just going to stand there?”
“He drew a hard bargain, but it’s ours!  He said that we can finish our shopping, and he will get it prepared.”
He explained again how they had taken out the carpet, and laid the wood floor.  He showed them the bathroom, again, because he was just so proud of it.  Then he turned to Hermione and said, “The thing I didn’t get to show you last time, though, is this.  You know how I met with Professor McGonagall at the beginning of term to ask for help and ideas on how to do a magical renovation?”
A lot on his mind was an understatement.  Harry had been so upset over what Draco had done, that after leaving McGonagall to take the wand—and the information they had learned—back to the Manor, Harry had gone home and ripped apart the room across from the sitting room.
It had taken a couple years after the war for shops to reopen and new ones to come in, but now the wizarding section of London was back to booming.
“It was after he sat there with his hand patting me in the back for quite awhile, that I broke down and told him everything. A part of me was afraid he would tell everyone else, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that he would never do that to me. He actually tried to help me come up with other things.
“Hmmm, yes!  I’ll see you later.  Love you!” Draco smiled as he stepped into the fireplace in the kitchen and was gone in a flash of green flames.
Harry could see Draco take a quick glance around the room, before he bent down and gave Harry a chaste kiss on the lips.  Draco then moved around to sit next to Harry on the couch.  Harry went to move his feet, but Draco just grabbed them, sat down, and put them in his lap.
Before he reached Draco’s lips, however, Draco had slipped from underneath Harry and gotten off of the bed.  Harry sat stunned for a moment as he saw Draco quickly getting dressed.  Had he done something wrong?
“Hello, Beverly,” Draco said, stepping around Harry to greet her.  He pulled her gently in for a hug, and kissed her cheek.  “Thank you for coming.”
The food, as usual, was beyond magnificent.  Harry was able to get Molly alone for a few minutes and, after giving her a big hug, told her that she didn’t always have to spoil him.  She laughed and, patting his cheek, told him that she did, and always would.  He just smiled, and hugged her again, saying, “thanks, mum.”
Draco moaned as Harry pushed his hips into Draco’s, grinding slowly against him.  Harry could feel himself stiffening already.  Before he could do much more, though, Draco released Harry’s lips, looking dazed.  Harry leant back in, but Draco pushed against his shoulder, stopping him.
Releasing Harry enough so that he could look him in the eyes, Draco asked, “Why is that?  Why didn’t you leave me?  You had the opportunity to get rid of me for good, and you didn’t do it.  Why not?”
“Hmmm.  Morning.  I’m so glad you’re back.  I get regular sex at night, a delicious meal in the morning, and a gorgeous fiancé to wait on me.”
He stood in the middle of the finishing chaos, instructing people on where to set up the booths and carts.  In the near distance, he could see the ‘Welcome to Hogsmeade’ sign and smiled a sad smile.  Harry had brought him to Hogsmeade when they were first dating.  They walked around the shops, had lunch at the Three Broomsticks (Rosemerta and Draco had had a chat during their 8th year, and were on good terms now) and just spent a lovely day holding hands and being together.
Draco carefully moved forward into the room.  He walked over to Narcissa, giving her a peck on the cheek.
Did Harry really want to tell Ron what happened?  Gods, this was embarrassing.  He did not want to know his friends’ sex lives, and he was sure the feeling was mutual.
Draco pulled back far too soon for Harry’s liking, but when he looked into those grey eyes, he smiled.
“Why?  Yes, he dumped you after you… yeah.  But, you still want to be with him, right?  So, just tell it to him straight.  Well, maybe not
“I—um, yes.  After I apologized to him, we had a nice long conversation.  I found that I could tell him things I'd never told anyone before.  I had time the following week, so I went back down to visit.  It soon became a weekly thing.  This week has only been the second time I've missed, and I—”
Harry had pulled him into his arms, rubbing his back, while Draco vented.   “I’m sorry.  I’m just really stressed.”
The grin that quickly took form on Harry’s face was as wide as he could make it.  He pulled Draco towards him, kissing him full on the lips.  Draco, taking his hand that was attached to Harry’s, pulled it around his back.  Harry took the hint, and moved his other arm to clasp his hands together around Draco, as Draco moved both of his around Harry’s neck.  After a few moments, they pulled apart, breathing hard.
He was afraid of lifting his legs, no matter how many times Harry told him to try it, so they just pulled him around, his legs firmly locked at the knees.
Making his way into the sitting room with Teddy perched on his hip, Harry hitched up the bag on his shoulder and grabbed a pinch of floo powder.  Tucking in Teddy’s head like Andromeda had taught him, he called out, “The Burrow!” and they were swept away.
“I cannot believe we have all put off our school shopping until now,” Hermione exclaimed, as she tapped the bricks.  “We leave in two days!”
Rinsing off his toothbrush, he took a long look at his face.  When did he begin to look so old?  He was only just 18, for Godric’s sake!
“That would be Mrs Walburga Black, your great aunt.”  Harry couldn’t help but laugh when he saw the blond’s face at that information.  “I wish I could get rid of her, believe me.  We’ve tried everything we can think of, to no avail.”
“Oh hush.  I’m staying with Pansy tonight, and I will see you tomorrow morning.  You’ll survive, I promise!”
Draco groaned.  “I know.  It’s ridiculous.”  They sat for a moment, staring at the fire.  “What time is it, anyway?”
“Works for me.  We can go over the guest list and details tonight?”  He looked up at Draco.  “Curry for dinner?”
“We have about 15 minutes until everyone will be back to drop off their bags before supper.  Must make the most of it.”  With that, he pulled Draco on top of him, kissing his breath away.
Hermione laughed as Draco got up and went and hugged both her and Ron, before sitting back beside Harry.
Harry pumped his fingers in and out, and decided to just go for it: he pushed in and with his middle finger, went on the search for the…
Curiosity peaked, Harry took the small object from Draco’s hand and, upon looking at it, started laughing.
He felt Draco’s chuckle, which made him feel better.  “Now, let’s go back to sleep.  McGonagall said she would meet us at the front doors at 8:30.”
By the time they reached it, both men were laughing madly.  They passed through the gate, and made their way to the closest apparition point.  Harry extended his arm, and Draco curled his hand around Harry’s bicep.  Turning on the spot, they vanished.
Dean glanced over at his friend, laughing at the befuddled look on Seamus’s face.  Before Seamus could make it bigger, though, another spell was cast at the feather, which grew and grew until it was taking up nearly half the length of the table Seamus and Dean were sitting at.  Dean was lightly snorting, nudging Seamus, trying to keep his laughter in check.  Seamus was again looking at their classmates, trying to see who was doing it.
“Wait! Before we go over there, I want to know something.  Is it true that you attended every Sunday dinner at the Burrow while I was gone?”
Harry turned towards Draco.  “I love you, Draco.  That ring around your neck is a sign of my love for you.  And I know you love me.  Very much.”
“I need you to read this.  I need you to know what has been going through my head.  I need you to love me for me.”
Draco turned around, quickly kissing Harry, who had wrapped his arms around his middle.  “No, I just got in, myself.  There was a small problem at the Market that I had to take care of.  What do you want to eat?  I can’t decide.”
The pair walked in a comfortable silence up the slight hill.  Harry could see the gates just ahead, and see a few people walking inside the grounds.  He couldn’t tell exactly who it was, so he didn’t try and get their attention.
“She then said something about how it wasn’t just my magic that could have caused it, and I automatically thought about the possible, well, probable, link between our wands.  I decided that you should be a part of the conversation, and so we came here.”
Harry growled as he forced Draco away from himself.  He turned and pulled open a drawer, taking out a pair of muggle denims and a jumper.
“Merlin’s balls, how can I be a supportive boyfriend if I can’t hold his hand, or give him a hug, or whatever?!”
Harry had gone down into the kitchen to refill platters and drinks.  He had pulled out a few more bottles of wine, and was walking back toward the refrigerator, when he realised he wasn’t alone.  He turned around to see Draco standing in the doorway, looking at him.
They looked at each other momentarily, before sagging and reaching for two pieces each.  She quietly stood by and watched as they ate, nodding when they had finished.  She banished the plate, and then strode towards the doors.  “Alright, gentlemen.  Let’s go.”
Harry’s heart rate picked up as they stood on the landing.  He released Draco’s left hand, curling his own around the nape of Draco’s head, pulling him into a kiss.  Harry started backing Draco into the doorway to the lounge.  He pushed Draco up against the wall just beside the doorway, slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth.
Draco was surprised as Harry quickly pushed the duvet off of him and literally jumped over Draco as he ran into the bathroom.  Draco smiled to himself as he heard water running, assuming Harry was brushing his teeth.  Soon Harry was running across the room to the closet.
Harry sat there, stunned.  “What do I have for this morning?  I need to go home for lunch and talk to my fiancé.”
“I’m fine!  Promise.”  Harry didn’t feel like getting into it with his friends, so quickly moved forward, leaving them to look at each other, shrugging.
Harry nodded at Blaise and then moved across the room towards Draco, eyes raking down Draco’s front.  Stopping in front of him, Harry gave him another once over—making Draco shiver slightly—before looking him in the eye and asking, “Can we talk?”
“Which is completely understandable!  I am, too, but I’m trying to keep my cool, to help alleviate your stress.”
She took in the look that her son was giving her, and shook her head.  “Moving on, what do you think of these colours?”  She pulled out several pieces of parchment, and spread them across the table.  Molly, who had been sitting at the table quietly during the disagreement, stood and pointed out several of her own ideas.
Harry cast a tempus charm and saw that there was only about a minute until midnight.  He raised he glass and said, “Again, thank you all for coming tonight.  This past year is one no one in this place will forget anytime soon.  May we all remember our past, but live for our future.”
and work on electricity.  Here, I’ll show you.”  He stood up, taking the pile of lights and taking them back to the shed.
Harry once again looked up at Draco’s face, relishing in the fact that he was home, and that Draco was with him.  Draco noticed Harry’s eyes on him, saying, “Potter, quit staring at me!”
A feeling he had never experienced before welled up in his stomach.  It was part nostalgia, part sadness, part love, and part hope.
“Hmm?  Oh, someone is helping me with some Christmas gifts, and I needed to know when I could pick them up.”
She tugged on Ron’s arm, pulling him away from his conversation with George.  He was confused until he realised she was walking him back towards Draco, and then smiled.
As his eyes cleared of sleep, he cast a glance around the room and finally realized what had woken him: there was a large, handsome-looking Horned Owl sitting on the window sill.  Harry quickly jumped up to let the bird in.  The owl hopped further inside, thrusting its leg out for Harry to un-attach its missive.
“I haven’t gotten to these yet, but I think I am going to turn those two,” he pointed to the bedrooms that Molly & Arthur and Fred & George had used when they stayed there with the Order, “into a large guest suite.  It’ll be just a little smaller than mine, but I think there will be enough room for a small sitting area, too.  I figure you two will be the ones using it the most, so I will want your opinions on some things.”
Harry sighed, vanishing the portkey.  “Alright, what first?”  He looked over at Draco, who sighed too.
It wasn’t more than 20 minutes, and the Wizengamot was settling back in their seats.  Kingsley banged his gavel once more, gaining the room’s attention.
“What in the hell was that?!” Malfoy exclaimed, standing and dusting himself off.  “How can you live with that thing in your house?”
“I’ve been collecting things over the past few months.  Whenever I saw something that reminded me of you, I picked it up.”
Smiles were on everyone’s faces as the group released each other, and Harry took in the scene around him.  Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were seated on one of the couches by the fire, with Percy perched on the arm closest to his mother.  Neville was sitting on the ground, next to where Ginny had just come from.  Luna was sitting cross legged on the window sill, next to a mournful George.  Harry’s heart leapt to his throat when his eyes locked with the glassy pair that belonged to the man.
“Today.  The green one is the official memo,” she said, nodding down at the stack of papers in his hand.
They both took three steps towards each other, and were instantly in each other’s arms.  They kissed slowly, relishing being together.  Draco moved to pull Harry into a crushing hug, kissing him over and over on his cheek and neck, nestling his head in the crook of Harry’s neck for a moment, and taking a deep breath.
Harry cleared his throat, looking up at Draco.  “Yeah.  After I went to Hogwarts, though, I went to the Weasley’s as soon as I could.”
“Trust me, it was difficult.  But, it was worth it to see your face.  Besides, you’re one of my best friends!”
Harry gave him a look, but went ahead and grabbed Draco’s hand, twisting away in apparition.  They landed in the exact same alleyway that they always did, but this time, it felt different.
This chapter was going to cover the entirety of the holidays, but with this already being nearly 11,000 words, I figured I would cut it into two, maybe three parts.  It depends on how well I can fit everything in that I want to do.
He sat up and pulled the top off the top.  Shifting aside the tissue paper, he gasped and then cackled.  He pulled out a red man’s thong with the saying, “When I think of you, I touch my elf.”
Draco thought back to that night, and the aftermath of the event.  He shuddered, glancing up his mother, who was doing the same.
“Like I said, he took pictures of random people doing random things.  I don’t know how he pulled off taking some of these shots.”
“Oh, I'll still get my dessert.  But,” Harry said with a smirk, as he leaned up to bite Draco’s bottom lip, “it won't be ice cream that I'll be eating.”
He and Harry were still in the burgeoning friendship phase, and so when he came slamming into the common room, eyes watery with tears, Harry at first didn’t know if he wanted to get involved.  But then he saw Draco lift up his sleeve, and once he saw the welt that the hex had left, he was on his feet and in front of Draco before his mind even caught up with him.
Ron chuckled as he said, “We’ve got food! Hope you don’t mind, Ginny overheard us talking to mum about supper, and she invited herself and Neville.”
“And that’s okay.  The only people that really know about my upbringing are Hermione and the Weasley’s.  They are my true family.  Molly took one look at me and stuffed me with food.  She’s the only mum I’ve ever known.”
“Yeah.  I really was going to take you to get some hot chocolate ice cream, but then I decided I’d better do this now, or else I would lose my nerve.”
