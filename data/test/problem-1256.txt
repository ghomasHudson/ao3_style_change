“Okay, that’s enough,” Pansy cut in. She waved down the waiter and ordered another round of mimosas, “Finish that, Draco.” She gestured to his half-finished mimosa. He glared at her but did as she directed.
Draco woke to a whoosh and a sudden flood of light as curtains were whipped open.
Harry could feel all of the tension melt from Draco, his whole body relaxed, only to be swiftly replaced with a surge of something entirely different.
B.J. didn’t know or care about his past, he just liked what he saw. Suddenly, blue eyes looked up and caught his and that smile was directed at him. Goldstein’s words echoed around and around in his head—
B.J. smiled lovingly as he stroked Draco gently. “Ahhh now love...I don’t know what you need to forget, and I can’t promise I can help with that.” Draco whimpered, and B.J. continued, “But I’m sorry you don’t feel good...I
Harry stilled.
“Maybe what!? We’d just kiss and make up like nothing happened!? We’d just hold hands and skip off into the sunset like he didn’t...like
“What in Merlin’s name is a plane? Why would that be a career? You can fly anytime you want with a broom. Or the odd illegal carpet…”
“I’m sorry. I shouldn't have said that.”
He magically tailors Harry’s trousers ‘til they’re more snug than he’s
He saw the club. He saw Lee leaping on him in greeting.
mattered anymore anyway either. He tucked up his side of Pansy’s bed—bitch could straighten her own pillows—and walked over to the vanity. Fuck, he looked like he felt. There was a small cut on his cheek with an accompanying purplish bruise forming beneath it; he also had a spectacular black eye and a scrape on the right side of his face from where he’d hit the pavement. How attractive. His hair was disheveled and kinked up strangely on one side from sleep; he ran his fingers through it, but to no avail. He walked down the hall to Pansy’s bathroom and opened the door as she was getting dressed.
“I need to see the cellar.”
of effort to repair things between you two. Honestly, I wasn’t sure what to expect when I got here, what you were thinking or what you fucking wanted -- but you say-- you love Draco. You want Draco. That’s all grand, but nothing will change unless you
Draco laughed. They clinked their glasses and sat in amiable silence. When the first glass was finished, Pansy ordered a second round. Draco took a sip as Pansy eyed him. The second he set it down she pounced.
“Oh.” Draco smiled weakly, but accepted the help. “That sounds nice.”
B.J. sighed and smiled back, “Yeah, s’pose it is,” he chuckled.
When he looked over at Draco, his heart clenched. Draco was curled up on the sofa, his hair falling across his forehead, and legs pulled up to his chest. A tumbler of scotch is clenched in his right hand as he stared blankly out the window.
“Yeah, thanks.” He lit Draco’s cigarette and then his own.
At first he was disoriented by the flashing lights and the loud beat. He shook his head and tried to find Draco amidst the writhing bodies pressed all around, but as he searched, the first thing he saw was himself. He was laughing and dancing. God he looked hot; he looked positively like sex on legs. Is that the way he looked when he danced? It should be illegal. Then he remembered, he saw the world around him the way it appeared to Draco. He looked to his left and caught sight of the blond, drink halfway to his lips, suddenly frozen. He looked both aroused and frightened at the same time.
I cannot overstate how much my  Alpha/Beta/friend
“Anything for my partner.” He deposited the box on Draco’s desk and picked up a few files.
“Fuck, Draco. Christ, you’re so good, so tight, yeah fuck me back, that’s it baby, take it, take my cock…” Draco started to touch himself but B.J. slapped his hand away. He wrapped one arm around Draco’s chest, the other around his prick and whispered in his ear, “Uh-uh baby, that’s mine for now too, I’m afraid.” He began pumping Draco’s dick in time with each thrust into his hole. Draco keened at the exquisite feeling of being taken. And then he heard it.
“Fuck in my own eyes. I need to be redeemed in the eyes of Harry Potter. He’s all I’ve ever known of love in this world. But you can’t help me do that, can you?”
Draco’s mouth fell open in blank shock.
“THE CATEGORY IS MOVIE TITLES! WHAT EVEN WOULD THAT MEAN CY?!” Garrett yelled.
“I swear Cylan, there is a cheese plate, two types of dip and a flatbread over there. I even made you those little taquitos you like so much, so get your arse out of my kitchen.”
Draco’s eyes were burning, because at the time, that was exactly what that kiss had meant. He just didn’t think Harry had felt it too.
What?
“He’s my first grandchild.” She kissed Orion’s forehead.
B.J. smiled again,”I have no nefarious intentions friend. You seem like an okay bloke. But lost, and if you don’t mind me saying, in need of a little bit of kindness and repair. Besides, what can I say? We fuck-ups gotta stick together. Now, let's get you to this Pansy.”
It's been six months since Draco's birthday. It's time to check in on how our boys are doing.
he did. He was hurt and scared! He’s an idiot! Especially when it comes to you. And now I find myself right back where I was a year ago with an armful of crying, broken Draco, that
Draco reached into his nightstand and fished out a bottle of lube, handing it to Harry and crawling onto the bed on his hands and knees. Harry groaned as he pulled Draco’s cheeks apart and looked at that tight ring of muscle. God, he couldn’t fucking believe this was real. He bent down and licked it in one wet swipe, then he kissed and lapped and worshipped that perfect little hole.
“You know, the last time you two were together, you never did bother to come around and spend time with us.” She nodded her head to include Blaise as well. “But then again, we also never got a chance to really get to know each other after all our past shit. So, for Draco’s sake, let’s try this one more time. Hi, I’m Pansy, and this is my friend Blaise. Nice to meet you.”
“Okay boys and girls. play nice or you can’t have any cupcakes,” Draco said as he set the plate down on the coffee table. Cy dove at them eagerly as Draco took the pen from him. “Now, how ‘bout I show you all how it’s done.”
Harry watched himself swallow deeply, and he watched something change.
The sound must have alerted the rest of the world, because suddenly it all came rushing back into focus, Lila beside him stooping to pick up the pan, clearly alarmed by his sudden immobility. The disruption in the kitchen also caught the attention of his friends and B.J. stood to go to him, “Draco are you—”
Draco just continued to stare, unsure if B.J. was being serious.
“You never said anything. how was I supposed to know? You always acted like everything was fine.”
the party Draco?”
Harry looked around again. He wasn’t sure where he was exactly. It seemed to be a garden, a rather lovely one. It could have used a bit of maintenance, but it was clearly well-loved. He turned to see an anxious, vaguely nauseated Draco speaking to a house-elf.
B.J. set the mug down. “No, you’re right. He isn’t mine. Draco is strong and intelligent and proud. He’s his own man. But I love him. I don’t stand by and let people hurt the people I love.”
“This is your receipt and proof of inspection,”  he said as he handed it to Draco.
“Merlin, today was rough,” Harry said as he collapsed onto his bed. “Good spar, though. You’re getting better at not favouring your left side.”
“My god, you’re right! What am I saying? To Draco!” He raised his beer and Draco clinked it with his own. “May he never understand the difference between yellow and red penalty cards!” The entire group cheered and toasted Draco as Draco smiled and tipped an imaginary hat.
There was a knock at the door. God, why couldn’t Hermione leave it alone! Leave
Draco, turned to look at him. “What?”
“Please sign here to confirm the date and time of the inspection, I have already signed to confirm that everything has met Ministry standards.”
Draco felt the blood drain from his face.
“What did you want to be when you grew up?”
Fuck. Slowly he dragged himself up and put on his denims. He threw on his rumpled sweater and pushed up the sleeves. It wasn’t like
“Oh good, Granger’s here. If we’re all going to that gala together, I need to discuss what she’s wearing, it wouldn’t do to clash. Ta, love.”
,” Harry coughed behind him. “We’re on a date.”
“I'm also trying to get through training the same as the rest! I
Draco choked. “What?”
Fuck it.
“Yes, Master Draco, Tilly will tell her. Should I bring the tea?”
Then he felt dizzy, assaulted by too many words and feelings all at once. He could see Anthony talking to Draco, but only caught bits and pieces…
In that moment Draco could see again the man from those days after the battle, the leader, the hero.
Draco was bouncing the baby and patting his back.
“Pans, you make it sound so easy. It was bad before but now...I mean, when this gets out, and make no mistake it will, people are going to want my head on a spike, and I could even bear that, but…he loved me Pans.” Draco felt like he couldn’t breathe. “I swear, I didn’t know, I thought...I thought I was just there. Just convenient, that he would just move on to the next guy when he chucked me. I didn’t...I mean…why would I think that he…” he buried his face in his hands. “Pans I fucked everything up. I just felt so awful, like I was worthless, and then this bloke asked me if...I just wanted to feel normal. If I’d have known…” he was trying to hold back the tears. Tears were pointless. They wouldn’t bring Harry back.
“Really? Well, then you must be as interested as I am to see what’s behind it?”
Harry just stopped and looked at him, perplexed. Draco pulled him close and kissed him, devolving into a fit of giggles. “Come on. I think we’ve had enough unpacking for one night. We’re both tired. Call that Thai place we like while I clear the couch; I’m going to introduce you to two dear friends of mine, Harry and Sally.”
“Shh...shh...shh, it’s just me. They’re gone.”
“Oh no? Are you sure?” Draco spat,”I thought “Stalk Malfoy” was your favourite game? Well, sorry to disappoint, but I’m not up to anything this time. I’m just trying to get through training the same as everybody else and—”
“But babies always need their Grandmothers.”
, Malfoy.”
Draco intended to. He hardly needed the warning. Harry was dangerous. He was a landmine. There was no way Draco could touch him and walk away intact.
He crawled on top of him, pressing their erections together as he licked from Harry’s collarbone to his ear in one long, slow swipe. Draco kissed and sucked on his earlobe as he snaked a hand down to Harry’s trousers, unbuckled the belt and pulled it through the loops, tossing it to the side.
Draco felt as if he’d been slapped, but still, he persevered. He needed Harry to understand. “I can explain, you don’t—”
“Yeah, guess so. Maybe we can make something.” Draco looked a little disappointed, but also a little pleased as he tucked himself back in beside a sleepy Harry.
“Draco, stop.” A surprisingly strong hand grabbed his upper arm and twisted him around just outside the café.
“Let him go, Pans. He needs to deal with this on his own,” B.J. said gently from behind her.
“Of course I do darling, he’s the gentleman you had sex with last night. I’ll give you this, you have good taste. He likes you, and he’s as worried about you as I am. He’s agreed to help us fix you.”
After a minute or so, Draco pulled back breathless, staring into Harry’s bright, awestruck eyes. He brushed the hair out of his face bringing his palm to rest on Harry’s cheek, leaning in and planting a sweet, chaste kiss he smirked. “I have no idea how you managed before I came along to tell you you were an idiot.”
Harry thudded his head against the wall. “No. No fucking way. Absolutely not.”
“I saw Susan slap you,” said Terry.
Seamus looked like he was slapped. “Don’t be disgusting.”
“What did Luna play?” said Harry, trying to imagine his sparkly, fluffy friend in a rock band.
Blaise looked at him. “Yes, it does.” There was a moment of silence and then Seamus, god bless him, piped up.
Blaise was leaning against a wall with Michael. No, that wasn’t right. He was holding Michael upright. Michael was giggling hysterically, in a way that was harsh with hysteria.
“And then he said to Greg “help, Greg, I think I’m a ghost” and Greg told him he should try walking through something –“
“Your parents weren’t good with it?”
Harry laughed. “Come on, Hermione. They’ll just think it’s a sports team or something.”
“Yeah,” he muttered into the comforting depths of his Camden Pale. “Yeah, I’m, uh, straight.”
“Hush, Potter, I’m getting there. Anyway. The raccoon was particularly adorable, even if they did try to get into my trash, and I quite enjoyed watching them. I saw about seven of them up in a tree one night, and my lumos glinted off their eyes, and they have these cute little masks that cover their eyes, and anyway, I was quite charmed.” Malfoy took a sip of tea, and continued with his story, growing more confident as he spoke.
“Then, of course, they had a truly ridiculous amount of kittens. The one with the snitch charm gave birth to 13 kittens, and the one with the ties gave birth to 17 kittens. All of a sudden, I had 30 Potter-themed kneazles, and a waiting list of over 100 witches, wizards, and magic users clamoring for one of my kittens. Raz helped me advertise, helped me screen the clients, and I was so touched, and so grateful, that I told her that if she wanted one, it was hers. She accepted, and one of her daughters started calling it their “Potteazle.” I thought it was fucking funny, actually, so I went to the Ministry, registered the name and coloring, and then set about finding homes for my kittens. The charms turned out beautifully, so I had two sorts to choose from, but sometimes, in litters with lots of kittens, there isn’t quite enough magic to go around, and from each litter, there were these two- one little black boy without a snitch, and one little black boy without a tie. Also, they were very little, and sometimes didn’t get enough milk, so I supplemented them with bottles, and then since they weren’t quite as interesting as the others, I decided I might as well keep them.”
Sharp, clicking steps on stone interrupted Harry from his kitten related musings. He jerked his head up, and jerked the kitten back towards him as he realized that he was, in all likelihood, about to come face to face with Draco Malfoy.
that you and I don’t have the best track record when it comes to making level-headed and solid decisions. I was simply correcting a mistake.”’
Harry smiled warmly and held out his hand. Draco reached a shaky hand out and took it. Potter’s grip tightened and pulled him up. “Well, a nice walk will do you some good.”
And there it was. That dull stab he could never quite be rid of. Maybe he needed another drink. He looked over at the bar and was trying to decide if he should go himself, or play the birthday card and send someone, when he spotted the most delectible arse he’d seen in a long time. It was round, and firm, clad in tight green trousers. He’d not wanted anyone since Harry, not remotely, but that arse should be illegal. His eyes trailed up to a trim waist and muscled arms attached to broad shoulders. Merlin, if he wanted to, he’d bet that bloke could lift him up and fuck him against a wall. He snorted as he reached for Cy’s beer and took a sip,
“Malfoy, I can tell when you lie, your face scrunches up a bit when you lie.”
. By the time the plates were being cleared away, they felt they had a good starting point.
The night air hit Draco like a rush of freedom, his heart was pounding in his chest. He took a deep breath and suddenly arms captured him around the waist from behind and a wicked voice whispered in his ear, “Hey there, stranger.”
“I don’t need you. I have a life, and a career and friends. I don’t NEED you.”
“Also how do you know when the eggs are done? I tried to get one out, but then the yolk ran everywhere and I had to start over!”
“I… nevermind, just please go.”

Draco looked down.
Draco’s head snapped up and looked straight into concerned emerald green eyes.
“No problem. It’s a fucking lot in there,” said the man as he leaned against the wall beside Draco.
A panicked voice.
And with that, she left the bedroom without a backward glance, cherry blossom dressing gown billowing behind her as she headed to the bathroom to get ready. When Pans was like this, it was best to just board the train. If you didn’t, you were either going to end up under it, or tied to the caboose and dragged down the tracks behind it. He sat up and was greeted by a knife-sharp pain in his skull. He felt like he really
It's been a month since Harry apparated away from Draco without a word.  Now he has to sort out what to do from here.
Oh yes, this was the way Draco saw him. Although, if he thought about it, it seemed about right.
“Hey, I may have just been on the pull, but I’m not such a bastard I’m gonna leave a crying, bleeding man alone in an alley with his cock out.” B.J. said “You might want to see to that by the way.”
Harry moaned and nodded eagerly. Draco took a quick look up and down the street, then Apparated them directly into his bedroom.
“A what?”
Draco had asked him to leave. That was it. Harry knew he was awful at expressing his emotions, and in the past, so was Draco. But talking to the man now, he could see how much Draco has changed-- how open he seemed. If Draco had wanted him back, if he had wanted things between them to be different -- he would have said something. Harry knows he’s doing the right thing. He respecting Draco’s wishes.
And just like that, Draco found himself in the kitchen. He was a natural. Turns out, there was a lot of overlap between potions and cooking: precise chopping, careful measurement, stirring (or flipping) at the right time, and monitoring temperature. Which is not to say there wasn’t room for creativity and improvisation once you understood the basics of flavour and technique. It was as Professor Snape had said all those years ago, it was a “subtle science and exact art.”
“I don’t know what they’re complaining about, they’re just going to start inventing rules halfway through.” Pansy lifted her drink to her lips and watched amused as their banter continued.
“Outer space, that's what they call the stars or whatever you call it. Things that aren’t on this planet. Anyway, they’ve sent out what they call probes to take pictures of the planets close up and they have space stations to study things and do experiments, and they’ve walked on the moon and— Malfoy?”
“Very.”
“Sorry Pans, we’ve already tried that, and I’m afraid you’ve got all the wrong bits.” Draco smirked up at her. “Besides, you can’t get in the way of true love!” He leaned in and planted a dramatic kiss on Cy’s cheek.
“Not so fast.” Harry says grabbing him by the wrist and pinning him to the wall. He presses himself against a squirming Draco, who stills suddenly when he can feel Harry’s growing hardness pressed between them. ”Do you want this?”
Draco closed his eyes and fought back the panic at the idea of having to go out again this weekend. Not only that, but to go to a proper restaurant and risk some zealous reporter snapping a photo and plastering it all over
”Standard procedure. I am always very
Draco couldn’t think. Everything was all a blur, but suddenly it came to him, “P...Pansy. She’s my best friend.”
“Please. I need to know.”
just go back to Laurie’s. It would kill him, but at least he could stay up torturing himself in peace without having to listen to the live show.
Draco had said they weren’t together.
************
began to touch Draco, to loosen him and Draco was saying, “make me feel good...make me forget…”
“I saw you looking at my cock and my arse.”
“Drinking my drink, what are you doing?”
The elf Disapparated with a pop. Draco walked through glass double doors and into a tidy solarium.
He walked to the kitchen and uncorked a bottle of pinot noir. He poured himself a glass, grabbed the bottle and headed to the bathroom. He turned on the taps; the idea of a nice bath with his wine seemed like just the thing to help him shut down his mind so he could reboot the old Draco and soothe the aching need-monster within him back into dormancy.
“You what, Draco?” Harry said softly.
Just then, Patrick returned and plopped himself down on the bench beside Harry.
“Fine.”
“DRACO! Listen to me…”
“OK, so what are we going to do about this little predicament you’ve gotten yourself into?”
People started to turn and pay attention as the woman continued to shout. “A likely story! I know what your father did! I know who you are! If only Harry Potter were here! He’d deal with the likes of you!”
Silence hung in the air, till Draco finally said, “She’s a good woman, she really loves you. You’re lucky.”
He opened it and saw the last person he wanted to see on his front stoop.
He watched as
Together they form my Beta DREAM TEAM.
Dammit this was beginning to feel like that night all over again. Harry had been overjoyed. He’d dared to hope that Draco could be his completely, and then he’d found him with another man. Maybe he should just go. He put some money on the bar and was about to turn to leave when he decided
“You have to understand, back then I wasn’t really around for Harry very much. There were the wedding plans, buying a flat, figuring out and starting careers. Everything was so hectic and Harry, well, he seemed fine most of the time. But I knew he was struggling a little. Then something changed with him. He seemed to brighten. Harry’s always been a bit...adrift. Nothing in his life has ever really felt like it was his, and he was always being pulled in one direction or another to be a symbol or a hero. Even the adults in his life manipulated him endlessly. I don’t think he ever thought he would live beyond the war and if he did, I don’t think he ever thought of what he would do.” She paused as she chewed her lip,  “He’s always been a little emotionally stupid. I think maybe he figured he’d just move in with Ron and I and we’d all just play house and be teenagers forever..”
“Yes, yes, I got your strawberries, you wanker,” she said, holding up the bag in her hand to show him. “I also got you something even better!” She reached just outside the door and pulled in a grinning Blaise Zabini.
“Oh, certainly!”
“Nghhhh… It’s late… what, Potter?” Draco said as he burrowed into his pillow.
“But Draco…”
“Draco?”
“You know, I think I can still make a betrothal for you with a lovely girl from the Greengrass family. Our name would benefit them and there are two sisters. We still have enough for a relatively decent dowry, we could get you and a wife started in great-grandmother’s estate in France—”
“Goodnight Draco.”
Either way, why were they watching
“Yeah, sure.”
“It’s just a cellar! Your report shows ’no major alterations’, why do you need to see the cellar?”
“Okay your highness, off, I’m up first,” Cy said as he pushed Draco unceremoniously from his lap.
There was a loud clatter of pins from the next lane followed by an explosion of shouts from Patrick’s team.
Draco wanted to scream. He downed the rest of his drink and looked over at Potter and his friends. They were happy, carefree, and Harry, that bastard, didn’t even notice he was missing. Fuck it. If they thought he was a piece of shit who didn’t give a fuck about anybody, then he’d be one. At least he was good for something. Fuck Harry. So what if he might feel a little angry or upset if he found out. He could take any one of them home. Tonight, Draco was going to be a regular guy getting what he wanted from a handsome stranger.
“He said, that you and Harry—“
“Yes, of course. What is it?”
“Well I’m sorry, Garrett,” Pansy said taking a sip of her drink, “but as I vastly prefer drawing pictures to prancing about like an idiot, I can neither confirm nor deny seeing any illegal manoeuvres.”
Draco smiled and licked Harry from root to the tip before taking him into his mouth humming in satisfaction, never taking his eyes off Harry’s. He found a teasing, gentle pace that made Harry arch and tense, obviously trying to keep from pushing up and fucking Draco’s mouth.
“Because he doesn’t pick at the food like a savage.”
Draco unbuckled his own trousers as he began to work Harry’s shaft in earnest. He kicked off his shoes and stood, divesting himself of the rest of his clothing and stripping Harry from the waist down. “God, take off your shirt. I need to see all of you.”
Harry swept them out of the flat and led them to a posh italian place not far away. He gave his name, and as they waited for their table he suddenly looked nervous. “I hope this is ok...er…I mean, I didn’t exactly ask what sort of place you felt like going to, and I read some good things about this one and...you know...it seemed nice and I thought…”
Draco pulled Harry up and their mouths melted together. He couldn’t believe this was his life, he had a career, a family, and soon a husband. He felt like he’d finally been redeemed for all his past sins, better than that,  he had all he’d ever need of love.
The pretty dark-haired hostess handed him a folded note, “Someone left this for you, Draco.”
“God, you’re thick. You're not even asking the right questions.” B.J. just rolled his eyes and sipped his tea. He walked past Harry into the living room, making himself comfortable on the sofa and placing his feet on the coffee table. “You don’t mind, do you?” he asked, eyeing the empty carton of chinese and the papers strewn about. “God, I can’t imagine Draco living in this shithole. No wonder he was miserable.”
“Ok, so look, maybe it wasn’t entirely accidental, but really, it’s harmless. Honestly, wouldn’t you rather have your face on a sweet little kneazle than on a bath towel? Or those bags of popcorn that has the kernels popping into the shape of your head? Kneazles are sweet and intelligent creatures, very brave, it’s really a compliment when you think about it. And also, it’s not your whole face, just a couple key features, really. And honestly, it would have been easy to make some sort of commentary about your hair, hair lengthening charms are a snap, and I’m sure I could have worked out for it to stand up on end, but really, I didn’t, and so there’s very clearly no need to be mad!” Draco gave a thin smile with those last words, clearly not believing them even as he spoke them.
Kreacher shook his head, still gently scritching at the ears as the kitten purred and stuffed its face with tuna.
Her voice may have been stern, but Harry caught another glimpse of her expression through her long, dark braids as she leaned down to examine the sleeping kitten more closely. He thought she looked fairly charmed by the kitten, despite her initial protestations to the contrary.
They got a few good moments of laughter in before Rowena decided that she’d had quite enough of this, and did not appreciate being shackled to a laughing maniac. Harry learned of her displeasure through the form of sharp,  needle-like teeth sinking into the soft meat of his hand. With a yelp, Harry let go of both cats, and then, realizing that he’d tried to drop them in front of their owner, tried to scramble madly after them, still giggling to himself.
“Well, it’s just that he apologized, and then he asked,” said Harry, still looking at his hands. “Everyone in the whole world uses my face, and they act like it’s not a big deal. They don’t apologize, they don’t ask, they just have their Harry Potter bars, and their glasses, and their posters, and they act like I’m supposed to be happy about it.
“Also, she? How can you tell?” asked Harry.
“Chrysanthemum” interrupted Malfoy.
Harry stared. It was hard to be intimidated by someone who was being chastised by a cat- or, well, probably a kneazle, given the business card that Harry still had clutched in his hand.
“Minnesota?” Harry interrupted. “Where’s Minnesota? Is it by New York? Or California?” He’d never been keen on geography, and Hogwarts hadn’t helped that, and he realized he had just listed almost his entire knowledge of the United States.
“Really Malfoy, it’s ok. I’m not mad, and I’m not here to pass judgement on anyone’s abilities, kneazle or otherwise. I just wanted to ask you if you knew where she came from, and since it seems like she’s yours, I suppose I’ll just leave her here, and you can…  get ready for your inspection? Which, again, I am not here for, I’m just here to return the kitten.” Harry tried to lift Chrysanthemum off the shoulder of his robes as a gesture of good faith, but she dug her claws in and refused to be moved.
“Oh fuck off,” said Seamus. “It was after word got round school you had punched Malfoy. I thought you were bloody brilliant, that’s all.”
crap,’ and explain that a Goldberg was a machine designed to do a simple task in an extraordinary complex chain of cause and effect – balls rolling along shelves to drop into buckets to lift up pulleys to spray water on delicately balanced scales. She would show them a video, which Harry had to admit was pretty funny. Blaise would complain that she could have just used a chain of dominoes as her metaphor, and why did she always have to make everything so unnecessarily complicated?
“Are you and Draco all right?” Dean asked him a few days later over a post-lecture pint. He had a smudge of blue high on his neck that Harry wasn’t planning on telling him about.
“There are – “
“Blaise,” muttered Harry, but Blaise shh’d him.
“Oh, it very much is. The twinkling lights and the Christmas spirit have gotten to you, and now you want a bit for old times’ sake. Don’t worry, you’ll be back to your senses by New Years.”
Dean was up, stalking down the hall. Harry followed him – he had a doom-y feeling building inside him, and these feelings were rarely wrong.
“Um, have you two been out expanding your sexual horizons?” said Harry. “Because I thought you’d mostly just been coming to the pub with us.”
“But you turned me down,” said Parvati. “I – you can’t keep playing with me like this.”
But it would be a nice dance.
“Ok, and I’m realising now that maybe you didn’t realise that half the Ravenclaw boys have had a crush on you since fourth year?”
“What?”
“Because of my blood?”
because I ran into him last night, and it’s very clear that it’s not something he wants to hear yet.”
“I have – I think I have a bottle of wine in the fridge?”
“Oh, of course you don’t get it, Harry. You’re gay.”
“I’m not – “
She sighed and went back to her books.
Pansy drank. “Fuck you, Ronald. We’re not playing this.”
As soon as he left, Dean collapsed. He was shaking, actually shaking on the bed. Harry was angry and aroused and much, much more sober.
loneliness.”
“Harry, Malfoy is not going to uni
“Nothing doing, I’m afraid. As you pointed out, I’m all alone in the world now. I do need to ply a trade somewhere.”
“Susan, please,” said Blaise. “Please, just hear me out – “
“God, Potter, look at you. Such a slut. You love this, don’t you?” cooed Draco, which would have been irritating if it wasn’t such a turn-on.
chastity, Bones. Now Harry, about the loneliness – “
“He got you drunk on purpose,” said Parvati, her voice so low it was almost a whisper.
“Hey, Harry. You look rough.”
She dragged Hermione onto the dancefloor, red dress against gold as she looped an arm round her waist. It was confusing and dark and she couldn’t dance, and then Parvati put her hands on her waist and suddenly she could. They moved against each other, red against gold. Hermione had a feeling she couldn’t place, and then she could. It was the same feeling she’d had when she and Harry and Ron had reunited after getting the Philosopher’s Stone. A sense that she was part of a set. Belonging.
“That quote is misused,” said Hermione.
“The Bones?” Parvati raised an eyebrow. “The most serious and well-respected family of legal scholars, politicians and all-round serious doo-gooders? Approving of Blaise?”
“I can wait on that too.” He turned his head, and brushed a kiss against Draco’s ear.
“So black and white,” sniffed Blaise. “Well, the reason I wasn’t on your side was because I’d been in classes with you for nearly six years, and I was fairly sure that any army lead by you was headed for total death and destruction, and I didn’t really feel like that. And I wasn’t on the Death Eater side because my father was a muggle.”
“Go on then, Draco. Blaise – good points, bad points, marks out of ten?”
“Uh, thanks. I pretty much just shoved on the first thing I found in my closet.”
at the beginning of every song. Harry ended up sharing a joint with Dean, Seamus, Morag and Parvati outside, once Draco confirmed the staff wouldn’t give a fuck.
Dean grimaced. Seamus was no longer a persona non grata, but there was still an edge between the two of them. “Fine, as ever. He apologised to me, again. Properly this time. Apparently your man Malfoy set him straight.”
Harry took one sniff of the sambuca and had to hold his breath and count to ten before he spewed all over the table. “Nope. Pansy?”
“Are you looking for Hermione?”
“Hermione.” There was Ron behind her. “Hermione, I didn’t mean to – “
You do not have to walk on your knees
“Not yet, Bones, that would be gauche.”
“So can bravery. Dear old Aunt Bella wasn’t scared a day in her life, and I give thanks every day that she’s dead. She was also loyal, so there’s a Hufflepuff value used for the bad side too.”
“That was pretty good.”
“If you think learning is the point of the next few years, you’re not doing them right,” said Blaise.
He was halfway down the corridor before he remembered and turned. “Malfoy.”
“Spectacular,” muttered Draco, but he followed Harry out of the stifling air indoors and down the little alley that led to the courtyard.
“Ok,” said Draco.
“Yeah, I’d definitely never cast an Imperio to save her life.”
Blaise sat down, heavily. “People… I wasn’t trying to… I mean…” He put his head in his hands. “Oh, fuck. I just… I’m just used to people liking it when I talk like that.”
“I left my card in his room,” she whispered. “I guess Seamus is asleep? I could go stay with Susan.”
“I don’t – “
“You and Parvati, I suppose.”
“And Nott,” said Harry, deciding that his charitable feelings extended beyond one person.
“Don’t like what, Seamus?” said Dean. “You’ve been dancing round it all term, trying to avoid coming out and saying it, and I’m sick of it. What don’t you like? Come on, tell me.”
“Well, Potter? I suppose you’re here for the yearly inspection- I will say, when I got a card this evening, I didn’t think it would be quite so soon. And you didn’t have to kidnap one of my kneazles- I would have let you know, you know! And not that it seems you or the Ministry cares, but tonight is a sensitive night for us all, and we’ve been a little stressed, since Chrysanthemum has been missing for almost an entire day, at this point, and really, I don’t know that two hours is enough notice to get the kneazelry into shape! Not that I’m hiding anything, of course, but you must understand that kneazles require a good deal of care every day, and sometimes things get a little bit messy. But come on in! Why not! After all, they can’t just send anyone, oh no! The Boy-Who-Lived himself sent out on a standard licensing inspection, since of course we can’t trust big bad Malfoys. Which is to say-” Malfoy cut himself off with what looked like effort, and glared at Harry.
“Yes,” said Ron, relieved. “I am, in fact, talking about racism. Thank you, Harry, I’m still working on giving it its proper name, like Hermione tells me. Because I don’t think you’ll have much fun, if you have to constantly worry about what he’s thinking, if he’s looking down on you for your parents, for having a muggleborn mum or an Indian dad.”
Hermione frowned, and fixed Harry with a pointed stare. Her dark eyes were narrowed, and her voice was full of disapproval, but she answered nonetheless.
Fairly short, but that will probably be my norm for a while. Enjoy!
Harry walked into Grimmauld Place, shaking the rain from his hair and shrugging off his outer robe. It fell to the floor and lay limp and accusing on the dull hardwood floor. Harry stared at it. He knew he should pick it up, put it away, and ensure that it was ready to go again in the morning, but the thought of even that level of effort left him feeling bleak. He trudged into the house, dripping on the floor, ignoring the vague voice in his head that kept softly saying that being an auror was not supposed to feel like this. He shoved it down, and went to sit on the couch. He could smell something savory wafting from the kitchen- it seemed that Kreacher was making a French Onion soup.
Harry stared at his hands. Ron had grown up secure in the knowledge that his family loved him, even if he felt a bit overshadowed, and it showed. He’d never really gotten Harry’s rabid, anxious desire to belong, and to have someone care about him. However, a bizarre little voice in Harry’s head that sounded like Ron himself, told Harry that Ron never WOULD understand if Harry didn’t make the attempt and use his words to tell him. He could at least try. Ron would like that.
Before Harry could respond, a pitiful wail rent the air, and with a pop, Chrysanthemum the hairless kneazle kitten apparated onto Harry’s shoulder. She began to purr and rub her face frantically against his chin, and Harry realized that a) she was enjoying the rasp of his stubble against her skin, and b) the presence of said stubble meant that he had forgotten to shave that morning.
Harry walked to his desk, which was just as he had left it the day before, covered in parchment, quills, and empty tea cups.
Harry followed suit wrapping his arms around Draco and stroking his back.
“I swear, you boys.” She looked utterly frustrated, but her eyes bored into his. “Draco, I need you to answer me honestly. How do you feel about him now.”
“No, it’s ok. Have you gotten anything fired for table eight?”
“Oh! I’ll go get them!”
“No, I’m not. It’s a real thing. Muggles have studied space too—”
“You only won by five pins! If I hadn’t been distracted that one time, I would have had that spare!”
B.J. burst out into laughter. “I told you the classics always work.” And then he kissed him. B.J.’s kiss was sinful and decadent, but there was still a hint of laughter bubbling up between them. He tasted of whiskey and cigarettes and he smelled of cotton and leather. He felt himself being slowly guided backward till they were in the alley, and Draco was pushed up against a wall.
“And if we win, I pick,” Patrick said as he stood holding out his hand to shake.
“Yeah, but I need to at least try.”
to say, it was just something stupid.” Draco smirked good-naturedly and Harry seemed to relax slightly.
“Yeah, well I seem to be particularly gifted.”
“B.J.’s not my—”
The whole table was silent for a moment.
Harry blanched.
“My, what a dreadfully boring name Harry Potter.” She grinned at him.
Draco looked away, unsure.
“You what? I don’t really give a shit.” Harry whirled around, his eyes blazing, “And why should I? I don’t even fucking know you. I thought I knew you when you were a teenager: a spoiled, evil jackass who liked hurting people.” Harry spat, “I thought I knew you a year ago, a manipulated child who became a man and was a funny, surprisingly sensitive lover.” Harry ran a hand through his messy hair looking frustrated, “But even then, I knew I wasn’t getting the whole picture. I knew there was
“Really?” She was clearly not buying it, he thought, as he put on the kettle and searched through his kitchen for his least dirty mug.
Narcissa looked up at her son. “But maybe we could find a nice...boy...for you. If that’s what you want.”
“Merlin, Potter, you are going to be the death of me,” Draco said running his fingers through Harry's hair and gripping his skull. “Nghhh...Stop it.”
“Look, get out of here, I’ll see you back at headquarters.”
this is stupid
In which Hermione does what she does, and takes care of Harry.
He felt like he was being X-rayed, but he refused to crumble. “Well, as pleasant as it is to have a nice coffee in the morning, may I ask why you wanted to have this little chat?”
“Alright, alright, whose team am I on?” Draco asked as he walked towards them.
The following week passed as every week before it had. Draco went to work in the lower levels of Gringotts, handling people’s boring accounts and finances but grateful to be out of the public eye. Harry went to work training auror cadets and came home with various bruises from sparring practice, entertaining tales of who fucked up on the practise course by failing to anticipate that the cat in the corner was an Animagus, and an endless stream of gossip about the sordid lives of various coworkers. Then they ordered take away and watched crap telly.
“No... Draco... This is different. The Aurors got a memo from the D.O.L.T about a suspicious case and…”
“Oh god yes,” Draco groaned as he pushed Harry against the wall. He gasped and Draco kissed him deeply, his tongue plundering Harry’s mouth. God, Harry had missed this. Draco’s chest pushed firmly against his, those long elegant fingers hooking into his belt loops, the taste of Draco—
He should definitely stop this.
“Draco!”
“Oh darling.” Pansy placed her hand on his, her thumb rubbing gently caressing the back of his hand “We’re going to fix it. I promise, my love.”
He took off his chef’s coat and headed over to join them when he heard a familiar voice and froze.
Draco chuckled to himself as he added a candied strawberry to the top of each strawberry cheesecake cupcake, grabbed his drink and carried them into the living room. Everyone was gathered around a very frustrated looking Patrick, who was pointing wildly at what he’d drawn. In Cy’s defence it did appear to be the backside of a person and then a clock. Patrick was pointing to the clock’s arm and gesturing in a circular motion…maybe something about time?
“Malfoy?” Potter whispered into the dark room.
“A loss is a loss,” Garrett said. “ And I beleive that means I get to pick the next 5 game nights. So I’ll see you next Saturday for…drumroll please…MONOPOLY!”
“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me,” he mumbled as he hunched over, cigarette between his lips, hands shaking and flicking the goddamn thing till he finally chucked it into the street. He collapsed back against the wall dejectedly.
“Yes. Thank you Dennis.” Draco sighed as Dennis scurried out the door. “Do you think when he fell in the lake as a first year, his brain got water logged?”
“I bought you a ring the day after your birthday.” Harry looked at him with sincere open eyes and took a knee. ”Do you want it?”
Harry looked up sharply.
Harry laid back down and shifted over to Draco’s side of the bed, burying his face in the pillow and inhaling his boyfriend’s intoxicating scent, it was lemons and clean cotton with a hint of mint from the gum he'd been chewing to give up smoking. It helped remind him that this was all real, that he wasn’t going to wake up alone in his dingy, lifeless flat.
So a few things for you folks that have been reading along. Can you spot the reference I've made for Draco's restaurant and the coffee shop down the street? Also, there have been lyrics from the song this fic was written about peppered in in each chapter. I hope you enjoyed them and that they weren't too obnoxious. ;) Join us next week for the resolution of some of this angst... All my love!
People were chatting amiably and finishing their plates when it was decided it was time to get game night going. They did pub nights, they went out to clubs and in smaller groups to the cinema, but game night was everybody's favourite. It was always held the second Saturday of the month at 6 by standing invitation. Draco would make a wide array of incredible food, and depending on how many people came, they’d play cards or board games, or in the case of a turnout like tonight, a large group game. Patrick and Garrett were the most outspoken of the bunch and always had very strong, and somehow very opposite, ideas for what they should play. Sometimes Draco thought they just liked to argue so they could enjoy the victory when one of them won. There had been some very creative bets and challenges in the past to determine who got to decide. For the most part, nobody really cared; it was just fun watching them duke it out. Tonight, it seemed, it was an arm wrestle for either charades or Pictionary.
Still no Draco in this one, but we edge ever closer! Soon, soon!
When he read the paper, he began to laugh. It seemed like his day was doomed to be as awful as possible. His inspection scheduled for that day was for none other than Kneazles, Inc, Proprietor D. Malfoy.
Harry stared. He knew his experience with cats was limited, but still, surely he wasn’t that wrong about one of the basic components.
Raz beamed at Harry, and reached out to scritch the kitten on the cheek, who leaned into the affection and purred loudly at the contact.
Putting this out of his mind, Harry stepped onto the front steps of Grimmauld Place and apparated to work.
“So it seems to me like we have two options here. You can send your regrets to Malfoy, tell him you can’t actually go, so sorry, whatever, or we can maybe have a little chat, and see if we can’t figure out why you said yes. Or why you panicked, either one. I’m not fussy.”
Harry shuffled into the en suite, brushing his teeth and accioing his work robes. They were brown, and while that was not in any way the robes’ fault, Harry resented them, and their drabness. It felt like a personal insult on the state of his drab life, that he needed to not only go to his drab job and spend time in his drab office, but he had to cover himself in the drab brown as well. It seemed like a bad omen.
Harry felt all hot and uncomfortable. The desire to stand up and leave on any pretext was very strong. He ignored the roiling in his gut and stayed where he was, examining his nails as if they were the most fascinating thing in the world.
Harry took it, and noticed with interest that it was indeed glowing slightly, and that the parchment it was on felt thick and luxurious. He flipped it over to look at the information and almost dropped the card in his shock. In swirling, silvery ink, the business card read:
Malfoy was not immune to the mirth- it seemed Harry’s hilarity was catching, as he too smiled, and then gave an undignified sort of giggle that only set Harry laughing harder.
Putting a hand over the kitten to prevent any sudden or fearful leaps, Harry pressed into the store. Once inside, he found that the animal sounds weren’t quite as stressful as he had feared, and that they mostly formed a pleasant background noise as he walked into the shop. He was immediately greeted by the proprietor, a tall, round woman with smile lines and a mop of curly, frizzy hair. He was reminded of a weird cross between Hermione and Hagrid, and this thought made him smile.
“Let me assure you that this is in no way- wait. Did you just agree?” asked Malfoy, who had been about to launch into another attempt to sway Harry into going.
All at once, it was too much for him. The cats, Malfoy, the idea that he’d needed a year to work up to defeating Voldemort- Harry felt laughter bubbling up from within him, and before he knew it, he was doubled over, practically howling with laughter in the foyer of Malfoy Manor.
“Oh, stuff it Malfoy, I’m just looking. Uhm, I mean, as an official Ministry representative, I have the right to examine the animals as needed,” said Harry. Draco looked highly agitated, but nodded.
Hermione must have seen something of that in his expression, because she took pity on him and offered up a flurry of suggestions as she ,
“A fine little beast indeed, who is eating to grow big and strong! What an example for others to follow, what an inspiration, yes. Kreacher does not mind that a kneazle kitten now lives in the house, oh no, of course he does not, but he does wish that perhaps he might have been informed before hand, so that he might make the necessary preparations- poor, good kitty, Kreacher does not even have a bed to offer in this trying time!”
“Hi.”
“Well I’m still oblivious, stubborn and sort of an idiot.”
Once again and for always she is amazing.  She is my best cheerleader and without her you wouldn't still be reading this. Also to one of the best beta's I know, I am unworthy of her talent,
Something good for right now.
"Harry... please... don't make me…”
------------
“Oh please, he says that now, but he’s never complaining when I use the time I save not watching the game to play likeable gay wingman and chat him up to the girls he points out
“No! You what, Draco?” He his voice was pleading but insistent. “I need to know what you’re feeling. Please?”
“Look at you,” Draco winked. “It seems you aren’t a total heathen after all, and here I thought you weren’t paying attention.”
Draco leaned back in his chair, dumbstruck. “Of all the gin joints…,”
Cy walked up to grab his table’s order off the pass, looking like he’d rather be anywhere else, “They’re coming in a bit, they texted. We had a bit of a late one last night.”
“You didn’t know I—” Harry sputtered, “Draco! Are you—”
“I have to go… I have to be up in the morning—”
Draco set down his book as calmly as he could pretend to be in the face of the one person who, despite his best efforts, never failed to evoke some sort of emotion in him whether for good or evil. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know you cared—”
“Naturally, M’lady,” he bowed to her.
Harry hadn’t known what to expect from Draco’s friends. He’d seen photos, but it was nothing like being in the middle of this lively, playful family. He was beginning to get a glimpse of what it must have felt like for Draco all those times at the club, being the odd man out in the midst of a group already so bonded to each other. It was a bit overwhelming and exceptionally intimidating. Harry didn’t even have the added burden of history and baggage with this group. Well, that wasn’t entirely true. He felt the careful scrutiny of B.J., Pansy and Blaise everywhere he went. Their hackles were up and they were ready to pounce if he made a false move. Draco seemed to sense Harry’s discomfort however, and returned to his side, bringing along a jovial dark-haired man.
Draco shook his head no, and Harry set the carton on the coffee table. He leaned back and gestured for Draco to rest his head in his lap. Draco complied, and Harry did that thing Draco loved where he ran his fingers through Draco’s hair. Usually, it made him feel sleepy and relaxed, but tonight all it did was fill him with dread. Someday, he was going to lose this. He closed his eyes and pretended to sleep, trying desperately not to cry.
“Oh, hold still you baby, your hair looks ridiculous. Besides, it’s technically my face I’m touching so calm yourself.”
“YOU!”
“The way your mind works astounds me.”
They walked down the street into the brisk night air. Harry was swinging their arms back and forth like a kid. God, he was naive. Naive but wonderful. He knew they couldn’t live like this forever:happy normal people walking down the street, swinging their arms and skipping like one of them isn’t a cowardly, lying bastard. Fuck this. A few blocks from the club, Draco had had it. He may not deserve it, but he was a Slytherin goddamnit, and if in this one moment he can take what he wants and not be punished for it, then he was fucking going to.
“Next time, I call captain, you boys are idiots.”
“Harr--” He tapped his wand on the device and the flames vanished.
He was curled up in a ball as memories swam through his head; Harry petting his hair, Harry’s excitement when he had agreed to go on a real date, Harry looking sheepish and nervous at the restaurant, Harry saying “I always pay attention to you Draco”, the look of bliss on Harry’s face when Draco had kissed him against the shop window.
Draco gave a barely convincing smile in return. “Whenever you are.”
B.J. rolled his eyes. “It wasn’t that hard. Not too long ago Draco and I were stumbling to the tube from a pub near here-- Greg’s or Graham’s or something. Anyway, we got to this street and Draco suddenly became extremely quiet and sober, so I asked him what was wrong. From there, I just looked for your name on the bell. Even so, I’m sure Blaise knows who to bribe find your address. As to your wards, God, no wonder there’s so few of you compared to the Muggle population. You haven’t keyed your words to keep out Muggles, genius. After that, all I had to do was knock on the door and you let me in. For someone so concerned with security, you didn’t even check to see who was on the other side of the door before opening it.”
“Well, actually,” Pansy said smugly, “you have the damndest luck. Not only did B.J. here not leave you to die in an alley, he also already knows about our kind.”
Draco grinned, “You don’t like it when I smoke.”
“I...well...when you put it that way, I guess. But it's not like any of this matters. I can’t deny what I’ve done. Now I just have to accept my fate and suffer through it. I don’t really see that there is much of a solution.”
“Why do you even bother asking? You know my credibility is shot! I was lucky to get the one chance I had!” He knew he shouldn’t raise his voice but this was too much.
“Oh, hello. Can I help you, Potter?”
The waiter put out his hand, “The name’s Cylan, but my friends call me Cy”
happy. I would have done anything,
This will not be abandoned!  I am one chapter away from the ending and I promise a new chapter will be published every Sunday until the story is complete :)
“Why not? I thought you were starving!”
Harry shrugged and let out a nervous laugh. “I don’t really know actually. It just seemed like something to say.”
Draco blushed furiously, “Yes well, anyway. I thought you might like to try them.”
“They are a type of fungus. I have a rule, if it’s related to something that makes you itch and requires a special foot cream to cure, I’m not putting it in my mouth.”
“Hmm,” Harry murmured against his hair. “You think so?”
Draco looked around his flat at the chaos and decided he didn’t remember when he had been happier. His world was exploding with life, color, laughter and mayhem.
The world shifted slightly and suddenly they were outside the club. He remembered now: he had confronted Draco. “Don’t you dare sell this story to
“Draco?” Harry’s voice was so sincere and concerned. Hearing his given name for the first time from those lips made one of the walls Draco had worked so hard to build between him and the world crumble.
“Yeah, ‘course I did. It’ll be fine.” Harry leaned in to kiss Draco on the forehead. “Just relax, you’re with me. They aren’t going to say anything.”
Potter took in a deep breath. “Look Malfoy, I don’t like this any better than you do but—”
Harry’s eyes sharpened and his wanting gaze pierced him. “Jesus, Draco…” he panted, eyes wide in amazement. Draco smirked, leaned in, and planted another firm kiss to Harry’s lips before stepping back. Harry nearly collapsed. He looked ravished and beautiful and like he’d won the fucking lottery. He smiled and launched himself at Draco, holding him firmly in a tight embrace, one arm around his waist the other tangled in his har. His face nuzzling into Draco’s neck. Then he backed up and offered Draco his hand. Draco took it and Harry kissed him sweetly on the lips.
Harry reached the door when Draco finally exploded.
Harry’s face lit up and he was about to speak when they were interrupted.
“WHAT THE FUCK, DRACO!”
, until the pillow under his head was unceremoniously ripped from his grasp and smacked him in the face.
She nuzzled against him. “I dunno, die probably.” She sighed. ”Just promise me you’ll get better. I don’t know who the bloke that’s been walking around in your clothes for the past 7 years is, but I want my Draco back. He was amazing.”
Draco coughed out a puff of smoke and turned.
“Uh huh, yeah, well let’s see what you got there, Lebowski.”
B.J. and Ron leapt up at the same time, warning looks in their eyes.
She rolled her eyes. “This isn’t going to be easy. You know that, right?”
It was another morning in Harry’s flat. Draco was making breakfast and with all the clanging and spitting it sounded like he was engaged in a battle.
He would have been tempted to skip the shower, but he was covered in Phillips’ blood and sweaty from the day. He showered quickly but thoroughly, then hopped out and grabbed the outfit Hermione had picked for him: soft brown leather boots, fitted olive trousers, a white v-neck t-shirt and an unbuttoned, sapphire collared shirt with the sleeves rolled up. It was all a little tighter than anything he’d ever worn in his life and he felt a little on display, but Hermione had insisted that that was rather the point.
“And she LOVED it.” Draco winked. He made himself a plate, grabbed his drink, and settled in his favourite armchair in the living room to eat accompanied by Blaise and Pansy.
Laurie took his hand and pulled him in close for a deep, languid kiss.
“We have, we
“Yeah.”
B.J. smiled softly. “Draco’s my best mate. I’d do anything to make him happy. He thinks you’re it. Me? I’m a bit harder to convince.” He chuckled. “I just hope you feel the same.”
Draco heard a
Then he got on his hands and knees to inspect the fireplace.
“Pansy!” Draco turned to her in horror, “You could be be brought up on charges for breaching the International Statute of Secrecy! You can’t flout Ministry law just because you’re worried about me!”
“I could do that.”
He thought about Draco, his quick wit, his determination, his brilliance.
“What?”
It had been 5 years since he was acquitted and people were no less angry at him now than they were the day he walked out of the Ministry a free man. After his trial, he’d had to adjust the Manor’s wards to refuse all incoming owls to stop the howlers. For most people, this would be an inconvenience, but since there was really nobody left that would want to send he and his mother mail anyway, it didn’t much matter. Now for the most part he tried to avoid all wizarding communities. This wasn’t foolproof given the amount of wizarding youth living in muggle London, but it was something.
He heard shouting and saw pavement.
Draco stilled. “Well… no… but it was valuable and—”
“I believe in the classics.”
His lips met Harry's and the world stopped as he breathed him in. Then suddenly Harry was kissing him back,  desperate and hungry. Harry pushed his hands into Draco’s hair and Draco almost cried with longing and relief, it felt like coming home. He moaned into Harry’s mouth and Harry cupped his face, snaking a hand around his waist, pulling him impossibly closer. Harry began to tremble as he whined and tangled his fist in Draco’s shirt. Then he shoved him back violently.
“Mac and Cheese?” Blaise said as he quirked an eyebrow. “ What would your mother say?”
“Draco, I got you a present!” Pansy said.
Harry hadn’t even worried about what had happened to Draco after he’d been beaten in an alley.
Goldstein blanched. “Fine. If you all want to be blind, that’s your prerogative. But I certainly won’t be eating here again now that I know this whore touches my food.”
“Hey there stranger,” Harry beamed at him. “God, you look gorgeous tonight,” he said, tucking a loose strand of hair behind Draco’s ear and planting a gentle kiss on his lips. “We better get going; we don’t want to be late for our reservation.”
As they began to make their way towards The Leaky, he thought he felt someone watching him. When he turned to look, he could have sworn he saw a flash of green eyes, but then they were gone. He must have imagined it. He felt like he saw Harry everywhere these days.
“Hmm?” Draco sat with his back against the wall, knees drawn up, face buried in a training manual, and unstyled hair falling into his eyes as he read.
“And by like this, I mean so infrequently…” he purred.
Patrick laughed. ”Lee inherited the best hangover cure from his gran, works wonders. What’d you say was in that again?”
“Sure, just a sec.”
“My dear, I just think it’s a bit silly, this refusal to enter your own home.”
“Yeah, so I understand why Harry’s threatened to call the Aurors if I contact him—”
He took a seat across from her and greeted her genially. “Hello Granger, although I hear it’s Granger-Weasley now. Best wishes to you and your husband.”
“It’s because I love you, Harry Potter. Now go back to sleep. I gotta dash, I’m running late. Usually, I’m punctual, but I had a hard time waking up this morning.
The music was too loud, the liquor was overpriced and the company was miserable. He hated these outings; really outings of any kind. He was reminded every time he left the house that if he stubbornly insisted on existing that he should do it somewhere where his presence wouldn’t be a burden to his fellow wizards. A short trip to the shops resulted in cold stares, snide comments, and shopkeepers refusing to serve him. Occasionally people threw things. Once a woman walked right up to him in the street and slapped him.
“Ok,” she said, loosening her grip. “But call if you need me. I have a nine pound bowling ball and I’m not afraid to use it.”
“I’m all in too, Draco.”
Harry pushed himself off the wall and turned to leave.
Harry looked like he’d been slapped in the face.
He stood and led Harry to the bedroom.
Draco froze, took a deep breath and looked up with as much cool indifference as he could muster.
“A mistake… you think that we were a mistake…”
“I love you, too.”
“Mother. I am not going to have this conversation again.”
“Never learned much about Muggle things, Father…” Draco trailed off. “Well, nevermind. Interesting that that’s what you wanted to do... Now you can fly anytime you like.”
Harry noticed now that Draco didn’t look reassured. He watched his own gaze search the room as they entered and, in his excitement to see his friends, let his hand drop. He watched Draco slowly approach as people eyed him warily and then stand awkwardly until Harry reached back and grabbed him, pulling him forward into the crowd. Draco looked terrified. Well, he looked terrified to someone that knew Draco. To the outside world, he looked stiff and cold, but Harry wasn’t even looking at him.
“OH FUCK! Yes, give it to me Harry, fuck me, give me your big cock, baby.”
Draco turned around and saw Harry eyeing him, standing there in just his pants and vest.
He watched Draco’s eyes go a bright and sharp silver. “Why is anybody here? I wanted to get laid. I come to Muggle clubs because here, I can be anybody. I wanted to forget who I was and be with somebody who didn’t care. I wanted to feel good, even if it was just for right now.”
“I’m sorry.” Harry groaned as he felt wet heat around him. “I’ll never try to get you to eat mushrooms again.”
Draco had woken that morning wrapped in Harry’s arms, with one long tan leg thrown over his, fully enveloped in the other man like a cocoon. He didn’t remember Harry being like that before. They cuddled occasionally and they’d wake up close sometimes, but not like this. Draco looked back and thought that maybe it was him then too. He’d shift away once Harry fell asleep, afraid to become too accustomed to the presence of someone he thought he couldn’t keep in the bed beside him. But now when they slept they were always touching, always close, as if their time apart made them determined to hold on this time, constantly needing reassurance of the other’s presence.
For right now.
Several hours passed before Harry came back to him and collected him like he was picking up a child from daycare.
“I win! You’re making breakfast.”
“Night, Laurie.” Draco could practically hear Harry blush as he kissed him and sent him on his way. Harry shut the door and leaned against it for a moment.
“Darling, is the baby okay? Tilly said it was urgent!”
“I am behaved, Pans.” He smiled sweetly then shouted, “I call team captain!”
else I wasn’t getting. There was more Draco in there I couldn’t reach, and I wanted to more than anything.”
I'd love to hear your thoughts if you'd like to share them. I hope you aren't too disappointed by the lack of an ending this week. Also, I think I should address that Draco made a mistake that was his own fault. He admits to that. Harry made some mistakes that hurt Draco. These boys were idiots in an unhealthy relationship. But I think maybe, just maybe there is something that can be salvaged if they can get their heads out of their own asses.
Blaise got up and headed to Patrick, pointing back at Draco. “Only for
“I didn’t know you came here! I just heard amazing things about their brunch and had to check it out. Have you been here before? It’s exquisite!  How did you hear about this place?” Without invitation Anthony took a seat in the spot Harry had reserved for Draco. “Oh, who am I kidding! You must know of all the best spots, a well-connected guy like yourself.” He grinned lasciviously and leaned forward resting a hand on Harry’s shoulder, completely oblivious to the now silent table. “Do you know of any place more intimate perhaps? I’d love your opinion.”
She looked him over with an appraising eye. “Thank you, Malfoy.”
Their courses came and went and Draco became pleasantly lightheaded from the wine, especially when he felt Potter’s ankle brush his under the table. It was like he was living someone else’s life and he could pretend for right now that it could go on like this forever.
“Oh B.J.,” Pansy winked. “you are
Draco swallowed hard, “Oh, right, sorry, must be the wine going to my head.”
“Potter, I think we can
Draco’s eyes grew wide and he swallowed. “What?”
“I’m not moping Hermione!” Harry said to the tiny flame in the shape of Hermione sitting in the centre of a stylish lantern on his counter. It had been a rather clever invention of hers. She had noticed that with an overwhelming number of wizarding youths moving into urban flats that didn’t have fireplaces, there was a growing communication problem. This mobile lantern enabled Floo could be moved about the flat, and it was an especially convenient way for young wizards and witches to stay in touch with more traditional wizards, who couldn’t (or wouldn’t) adapt to muggle technology. Harry secretly thought the main reason she’d created it was to keep Molly from continuously popping up unannounced after she and Ron had gotten married, but Harry kept that notion to himself.
“Meh. Sometimes, frankly, I’m a little over the whole scene in there.”
Harry scowled, a small huff of indignation escaping him.
He quickly tossed his pyjama bottoms into the corner and threw on his trousers and T-shirt,  “I ought to get going anyway.”
Draco lost again.
“Keep your trousers on!” Draco said as he stalked down the hall and towards his front door.
“Draco, please?”
“What’s space?”
He rolled over into her soft down pillows, and as he drifted to sleep, he felt for the first time in a long time that maybe, just maybe, everything was going to be okay.
“Say it baby, tell me you love my cock, Draco,” Harry said as he began pounding into him.
Thanks for still being here! Or for joining us!
“You ready love?” Draco nodded and B.J. turned him around lowering his pants and trousers and reaching into his pocket for lube. He prepped Draco carefully, almost tenderly. Draco braced himself with his arms against the wall and his cheek against the brick. B.J. slid on a condom and lined himself up. “Are you ok?”
Harry had been right. They hadn’t said anything. But he hadn’t done anything to make it easier for Draco. He was agonised as he watched himself chatting with Dean and Parvati, and turned to see Draco looking very much like he’d rather disappear.
Harry shoves him away. “You have to go.”
Harry just continued to stare, looking at everything from the game night trophy, his posters of Muggle films, to the photos of him and his friends that adorned the walls and end tables.
for you Draco?”
Inside...Harry...Stupid Harry who was too good for his own good. That beautiful man who thought that the world could change because he wanted it to. Who thought that he could wash Draco clean and that somehow he’d be worthy. He’d figure it out soon enough and then where would Draco be? Alone in his cold Manor. A prison of his entire life’s making. And when that day came, he wouldn’t even have the memory of this one person that wanted him like he was any other bloke standing outside a club. Who didn’t flinch at the name Malfoy. Besides, even if Harry knew, would he really even care? He might be a little upset, sure, but what was Draco in the end to him really, when he could pick anyone he wanted?
This was enough. It had to be enough. They were toxic to each other. They had tried. They had failed. He wanted, but he couldn’t have him anymore…too much had happened.
“Can’t just what?” He asked looking up, something feral and angry glinting in his eyes. “Walk into your territory and begin messing with your things?”
“He what?” Her voice was hard and quiet.
Draco’s mind began to wander. He thought, not for the first time, that he was unbelievably blessed to be surrounded by these vibrant, loving people. He’d never really had a family, not like this, not one he could just let his guard down around. Here, he could just be himself without having to worry that anything he said or did could later be used against him. As Pansy walked past him to take her turn, he reflected that he’d never thought he’d see
. Not this time. Draco could reject him if he wanted, and that would be okay. It would gut him, but he’d know he had made his thoughts and intentions clear. He would at least have the satisfaction of knowing he’d done all he could. He took a steadying breath and prepared to turn around.

“I had no idea… and they did all that without magic… I…”
It had been six months since Draco’s birthday, and Harry still couldn’t believe how lucky he was. Draco was everything he didn’t know he’d wanted until he’d met him. Occasionally he still looked back at the day he’d first met Draco in that club and shuddered. He couldn’t believe there was a time when the most beautiful and fascinating man he’d ever met spent his weekends trolling clubs and getting fucked by strangers in alleys, or, even worse, that Harry had been one of those men. He couldn’t believe that he’d later gotten him, and then nearly lost him again. Not this time, he vowed to himself. He already had the ring; in fact, he’d bought it the morning after Draco’s birthday. He was just waiting for the time to be right.
“I love you.”
B.J. walked into the kitchen and began rummaging in the freezer for some ice. “You know, you’d make it a lot easier on yourself if you just let me order a bunch of pizzas for these things. This lot will eat anything.”
He sighed, closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the wall. “I’m such an idiot… I thought you saw that but didn’t want
“Liar.”
They took their seats, Pansy ordered two mimosas, and told the waitress she would let them know when they were ready to order. When the mimosas arrived, Pansy looked at her phone and held up a finger. “Aaaand…Now it’s 11. Drink up, it is officially a respectable hour for champagne.”
. He finished his wine and poured himself another glass. Now he really needed this bath. He settled himself into the bath and put a warm cloth over his face. Just when he thought he had his life in order. He took a breath and tried to let it all fade away.  As he sank deeper into the water he could almost forget the note on the counter.
Hermione’s surprised face popped up. “Harry. Is everything alright?”
Draco crinkled his eyebrows in confusion.“Harry, I don’t know I—”
“I wouldn’t be where I am now if it hadn’t, and I will never regret that. The man you knew was no kind of partner. Not really. You’d never have been happy with him long-term. But...” Draco swallowed. “But don’t think I didn’t love you.”
night.” He winked.
“Well as the guest of honor, naturally mine, my liege.” Cy bowed low in his seat at the console and Draco looked up to see the name ‘King Draco’ on the screen.
“Because, I may hate you for what you did,” he said as he looked at Draco, green eyes blazing, “but I couldn’t bear watching you be spit on and beaten on my account. I couldn’t allow people to tear you apart publicly and vivisect every of second of what we had. That—that was too important to me, and you—I didn't want you hurt.”
And then B.J. began laughing hysterically, “God Draco, where did you find her and where do I get mine? You are one lucky son of a bitch.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yep,” said Cy, holding it up and as he passed. She took it from him and followed.
kept me up most of the night doing unspeakable things to my person.” Draco kissed him on the forehead and stood bringing his hips roughly level with Harry’s face. Harry grabbed his ass, pulling him close, and mouthing at his clothed cock, looking up at Draco through dark eyelashes.
“B.J.”
He froze.
Harry sees their time together from Draco's perspective.
“What? What are you talking about?”
It had been several weeks since they were assigned the case, and Harry had to admit that Malfoy wasn’t all that bad. The years had mellowed him. He was still sharp tongued and sarcastic, but mostly funny, He always seemed to express exactly what Harry felt but didn’t say aloud.
“But we both wanted to fly up and away from the world. Isn’t that interesting?”
Draco reached into the tub of drinks and handed him another beer without even looking up from his sautéing.
“You dropped your beer and you went a bit funny for a second there,” Cy said, putting a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Are you okay?”
“Hey!” Pansy exclaimed as she swatted Cy, “I’m the queen here!”
. After the shite you’ve put each other through you both will. But if you don’t take this chance now, don’t you dare show your face ever again. Because next time, we won’t be having this nice little “chat”. I am getting too old for this shit. Do you understand me?”
The smokers returned and everybody began to say their goodnights, gather their belongings and migrate outside. Harry was given several hugs and wishes that they’d see him again soon.
“When I was a kid,” Harry said, “I dreamed of coming to a place like this. The Dursleys would go on holiday and leave me behind. But they never went very far from Surrey. Nothing like this... Dudley would be so jealous if he could see me now!”
Harry took a seat, took a breath, and leaned forward into the swirling chaos of Draco’s memories.
He walked away, tucking his hands into his pockets, grateful this conversation was over and praying he could put Harry behind him once and for all.
Draco froze.
Draco shifted them so they were on their sides, somehow managing not to slip Harry out of him as he hooked one leg over Harry’s and wrapped his arms around him holding him close.
“You think I had something to do with this?” Potter’s face turned red, green eyes flashing. “Merlin, Malfoy! Get over yourself! You aren’t the center of the bloody universe! I’m no more pleased about this than you are!”
“No I’m not.”
“Wow. And I thought my wife and I had problems.”
“Morning.” B.J. lost some of his mirth but remained pleasant. “I assume you’re here for Draco.”
“Harry, we’re talking in circles. I’m sorry. You will never know how much I regret what I did to you. The second I saw your face, I would have given anything to take it back. In some ways though, I’m glad it happened.”
Remember this.
“I am nothing if not civic minded!” Patrick said from across the room.
Harry looked adorably helpless as he glanced over the wine selection, so Draco smiled and ordered wine and appetisers for them.
See you next Sunday!
Harry cleared his throat and politely moved Goldstein’s hand. “Actually, my boyfriend is the brunch chef here.”
Suddenly a tomato, a grape, a piece of bread and a taquito all came flying at him at once. “Gaaah!” he shouted as he ducked his head and threw up his arms to defend himself from the onslaught.
Draco kissed him.
P.S. for those playing "Spot the Sherlock Reference" along at home, I hope you enjoyed, Harry's very terrible Auror Trainee. Also as it is the 2000's how could I not reference Friends  ;) it should be obvious to most Friends fans. ;)
“Whatever, I hope you know I’m charging you for the whole hour. See you next week.”
Harry’s unable to breathe. What. The actual. Fuck.
“No, I’m not a wizard Draco.” B.J. said, “and don’t worry, Pansy didn’t risk anything. I figured it out. Practically had to drag it out of her to get her to admit it though. You boyfriend’s mate, Neville was it? Well, when he was screaming in that alley, he said something about calling the aurors. That sounded familiar, but I just figured I’d misheard or misunderstood. But then he was talking about a war and I put two and two together. My sister Caroline’s a muggle-born, a bit older than me. I remember turning 11 and hoping I was too so I could go to Hogwarts, but turns out I’m ordinary.”
“You know why, mother.” Draco’s tone was clipped.
She set down her cup. “Why did you do it?”
Thank you all SO much for being here. I've been a reader/lurker in the fanfic community for 17 years and I NEVER thought I'd be able to write anything of my own. All your love and encouragement means the world to me. Also high five to anyone who spent their mornings playing MarioKart64. I ALWAYS play as toad, If I can't be toad, I don't play. I use his lightweight as an advantage in several places, but my brother always uses it to knock me around, because he's the worst.
“Why wouldn’t it be? You’re a free man. Have fun.”
Harry slid in and out of Draco slowly and gently, marvelling in the sensation of warmth that spread through his body. Gradually that warmth became a heat and he picked up his pace, thrusting greedily into the body below him as Draco writhed and cried out.
Draco opens his eyes, searching Harry’s face, trying to figure out what’s going on, then nods slowly.
Harry saw stars as he emptied wave after wave of come deep inside his lover.
“Because it’s the only food I’ve ever tried to cook that fights back!” There was a hiss and a pop followed by a yelp from Draco as grease spat from the pan onto his hand. He was also cooking a pot of beans and slicing tomatoes as he stared at another pan that presumably was frying eggs.
“OW! Pans! Stop it!”
They had never been friends, but something passed between them in that moment. A mutual understanding of their love for their exhausted sons, and for their new grandbaby. In that moment something blossomed, mother to mother. No matter their past, today, they were family.
“Nope, you lose! We’re playing Pictionary!”
They made their way down the street to a little restaurant they loved, called Hudson’s. It was the kind of place that felt trendy and comfortable all at once.Usually they sat outside on the quaint little patio, but as they approached, Draco said, “Inside please, my head hurts and the sun is killing me.”
Harry lost it as his rhythm began to falter. “MINE!” He could feel Draco beginning to tip over the edge. “Come for me baby, come on my cock!” Draco stilled as his back arched and he shot pearly streams of come all over his chest.
Harry and Draco chuckled, and Draco gestured for him to join the party, “Go, sit, I need to wrap up here.”
Potter walked into their tiny shoebox of a room, rucksack slung over his shoulder, looking oddly sheepish. “So, I guess we’re meant to bunk together.”
“B.J.?”
to help me make it a home. I want
“Finally!” Draco says, pushing himself off the wardrobe. “Ok, here. Take this,” he wriggles the signet ring off his finger. “God, you look atrocious. Nobody is going to believe you’re me.”
Draco had pulled him slowly and gently into the alley beside the club and Harry had fucked him. He remembered being nervous, but wanting it. When it was over and Draco was putting himself back together, he’d panicked.
“Harry...Did that dog just talk?”
“Laurie! Hey! I thought we said eight?”
“Sorry mate, family secret.”
“No,” Harry chuckled. “I…” He set his cup down. “Hermione said I needed closure.”
“I dunno.” Harry shrugged. “But you seem different recently. Is something bothering you?
Harry was perfectly still. His eyes were locked on Draco, his jaw tight, expression cold and unreadable.
“What? Why?”
“Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it!”
“He insisted that you were different. That you had changed.
“Knock! Knock!” Draco turned to the door and saw Dave enter, a case of Fosters in one hand and a bottle of Sprite in the other.
So first of all.....I'M SO SORRY!! You know how punctual I am, but frankly, since this is the last chapter (well besides epilogue) I really wanted to make sure it was perfect. This started out a bitch to write and then Easter slowed me down. So I'm a tad late, but it was because I didn't want to publish something subpar before I was ready just to be on time. :)  Never fear dear readers I will NEVER abandon you. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this chapter! Now, without further ado, the moment we've all been waiting for...Harry gets hit by a bus and Draco gets married to a very nice pureblood witch!  (Just kidding ;) )
something...something beyond sitting in this shithole trying to figure out the most pitiful way to die alone.”
“What?” Draco choked, it was such an extreme measure. “Why?”
“God,” Harry said, smiling at him in wonder. “Do you have any idea how sexy that is?”
“What is this?”
“Yeah, I guess I am.” He set his cup down.” You are too. You look happier now than you ever did with me. He seems nice. I’m glad you found him.”
“So it’s still your fault then, isn’t it,dummy?” Draco smiled and nudged him.
“I’m enjoying an evening with my friends.” She smiled. “Harry looks like he could use a hand.” She chuckled.
“We’re having a bit of an existential job crisis here, our little Draco needs work and he’s not sure where to start.”
and to one of the best beta's I know
From the other side of the kitchen island, Patrick howled with laughter. “I told you you couldn’t sneak one past him!”
“Yes, well, Harry saved the world. I think he can handle a drunk girl.”
am apparently supposed to put back together again. Even though you now have some insight into what Draco was going through back then, and how he’s grown and worked to improve himself as a result, you still can’t be arsed to put forth even a
“Patrick, Harry here is a big fan of football too. Harry was always giving me a hard time about never getting into watching the matches.”
------------
and you have the balls to sit there, calm as you please, like you don’t see why I am upset you FUCKING ARSEHOLE!”
Harry began to come undone at those words that he’d wanted to hear from Draco for so long.
Harry could sense the tension build in the street as Draco hurried as quickly as he could to the nearest Apparition point.
! So when Laurie made it clear that he was interested, I was so wound up and frustrated, I just wanted to get you out of my system and move on for the sake of our friendship. But then, even that went wrong,because you were pulling away from me. I felt like I lost you and I didn’t know why. It was killing me, and the more Laurie pushed and tried to be my boyfriend and get me into bed, the more wrong it felt and I just… I couldn’t anymore. So I broke up with him and I came to our room last night and you were gone. I thought you were just out training or something, you’d been avoiding me so I didn’t think anything of it. It wasn’t until this morning when you still weren’t there that I noticed your things were gone that I panicked.”
Yes, there was a time Draco could never imagine being this happy.
Harry took Draco's hand and examined his knuckles. “Are you okay? Cy, can you get him some ice?”
The years had been kind to Lee. He was no longer the short, smirking, kid with a microphone, his face had refined itself till it was all sharp angles you could practically cut yourself on, not to mention he’d grown taller and broader. The bloke looked like a bloody supermodel. If he was honest with himself, he’d always liked Lee. Sure, he was a twat to the Slytherin team in his match commentary, but Draco had to admit he was always clever and quick on his feet, and he would have been bloody hilarious if the jokes weren’t at Draco’s expense. The things he could have done with him had he been in Slytherin. Harry could be happy with someone like Lee.
“I love you too.” Harry smiled and smoothed Draco’s hair from his face. “I think I knew the day you smacked me with a pillow for snoring, and said you were not murdering me ‘as a kindness’, then gave me breakfast in a napkin since I overslept, then called me an idiot, then hit me in the face with my robes and told me that if I was late people would think you murdered me so I needed to show up for ‘proof of life’. You could have left, and gone to class, but that was you caring. And after years of smothering by Hermione and Molly, I liked the way you said I love you.“
Together they form my Beta DREAM TEAM.
Harry threw his rucksack on his bunk.
He saw spit on leather—he saw himself, green eyes leading him outside—he heard Draco’s thoughts.
“I’m busy Harry,” Draco said refusing to look up at Harry “Go away.”
Draco whipped back around and hissed “Pans! What are you doing! Do you know who that is?”
“Good boy.” Draco said placing a quick kiss on Harry’s lips. “Go back to sleep, love.”
Draco fell back in his chair as if he’d been slapped. He felt like he might be sick. He stared blankly at the spit on his shoe. The world was blurring down to that single viscous spot on brown leather...
His denims landed on his head, followed by his jumper.
Draco stopped.
“An airline pilot! I wanted to fly planes. I always thought it would be fantastic to wear a uniform, and be a Captain. People respect Captains and the girls all fawn over them. But I guess it was mostly that I wanted to take off from the ground, and leave the world behind, fly up in the air and travel to new and interesting places.” Potter smiled as he thought about his childhood fantasy.
“No.” B.J. said simply, as he sat up and placed the mug on the table before him. “So, what are you going to do about it?”
Harry smiled, chest still heaving, softening prick still buried inside Draco. “I think I may have some idea.”
“Oh… well… actually, I can’t.”
“They ordered without us?”
“Is he a good man? Is he intelligent? Does he love you?”

” and winked going to join the group.
“Yes,” he said, without looking up. “Why wouldn’t I be?”
“Sorry, I’ve been a bit distracted, I’d really thought…” He shook his head. “Never mind. Let’s make this the best birthday you’ve ever had.” He lifted his glass. “To you.”
Thanks so much for reading! Tune in for Chapter 2 which will be published on 3/3!
“This is never what I wanted for you. I gambled everything I could to keep you alive, but I never thought about what it would be like for you later.” She looked at him with earnest, loving eyes. “It was too late by the time I realised where I had gone wrong. But now—” She bit her lip and looked away. “I don’t know what else I can do to make it better for you.”
"Well, now you do. Stay still, it’ll be over with more quickly"
Draco chuckled, “Come back here and kiss me you colossal idiot.”
“Want to play hearts?” Harry reached towards their shared nightstand. “I can grab the cards. It’s my turn to pick the game so—”
, ” Hermione hissed, “that you two might finally talk like two grown-ups about what went wrong! I
“Ughh, sorry.” Potter opened the door and flopped into the passenger seat. “Here, I ended up with a street masala.”
“I’m curious.” Potter sat up on one elbow peering at Draco.
Draco looked anxious. “No.”
“Because, for one, you’re dating fucking Laurie. Who is gorgeous, and not former Death Eater scum, which means that he’s better than me in at least two aspects, probably more. And second, because there is no possible way you could want this in the long term and I…”
“Yes, he’s an exceptionally good man, one of the finest and bravest and kindest.” He smiled. “As to intelligence, no, he’s a bit of an idiot. He tends to get by on bravery and sheer dumb luck, I think.”
Someone startled him out of his reverie by plopping down next to him and leaning back against the plush seat. “Oh hi,” said a highly relaxed Lovegood.
——————
Harry looked up abruptly, “Anthony?”
“Oh, so NOW you want me to be choosy about what I put in my mouth.”
He saw himself pushed against glass. He saw that kiss: the kiss that had been burned into his mind from the moment it happened.
They'd hurt each other enough. They needed this wound to heal. No matter how much he wanted to, he’d never contact Draco Malfoy again.
“Oh, Hello Harry!” He smiled a cheeky smile as he leaned against Harry’s door frame. “How nice to see you! I hear you’ve put the kettle on!” His voice bright as he pushed past Harry and followed the shrill whistle into the kitchen.
Draco knew it was wrong of him and he was prepared to meet a very protective, very pissed off Granger. He ordered his coffee and wished he could make it Irish.
“Shhh,” Harry said as he reached out to take Orion from a frantic Draco. “Did you call--”
B.J.’s cock unceremoniously flopped out of him and he hastily tucked it away. Draco saw the edge of Harry’s shoulder as he collapsed back against the wall and slid down it.
He turned slowly and looked at her. He didn’t see malice or contempt, only honest concern. He resumed his seat and waited for her to continue.
“I’ve been thinking about you.” Draco popped the button of his denims with one hand and slid the other into his pants, cupping the soft bare skin of Harry’s arse.
“Mais fica.” he said as he pulled Draco’s portion into his lap.
Draco took it warily but allowed himself to be hoisted up. “Why are you doing this?” he asked,  eyeing B.J. suspiciously.
They stumbled upon landing and Draco took advantage of their lack of balance to push Harry backwards onto his bed. Harry looked up at him with glazed, wanting eyes.
Neville remained seated, and looked at Anthony calmly. “Anthony, I can’t speak to what you fought for. I fought for a world where we believed in the good in people, rejected the idea of superiority, and power of love to redeem people that were hurt and lost. I personally fought so that I wouldn’t have to sit at a meal with my friends and be interrupted by someone spewing hatred at a person they haven’t really gotten to know, particularly when it's clear to me that what you want isn’t justice, it’s to get into Harry’s pants.”
