He may have fallen asleep in the chair. It was difficult to tell, with how much the trees outside filtered out sunlight even on the brightest of days. But he opened his eyes when he heard a shriek, and sighed when the familiar eagle owl swooped into the room, dropping a letter on his lap. It then settled on the window sill next to the other owl, somehow giving Vince a disdainful look.
He was buried so deeply in his thoughts that he didn’t even hear the crack of Apparation and had to blink a few times before he realised that yes, Potter really was in his cabin and no, he wasn’t imagining things.
Amazingly there was no cursing, no stomping, no dramatics of any sort as they made their way through the woods. Once they’d arrived Draco took a seat on the dry ground, crossing his legs, and accepting the mangled broom that Potter handed over.
Instead his arm wrapped around the man’s waist and held him, as his hips continued to twitch, as his eyes remained shut, as his throat was choked with what felt like the most terrifying of emotions.
“You think?” A heavy sigh, then, “No, don’t do that. Because if something does happen I want to know about it. Kreacher, stop him from doing anything stupid, please.”
“Scared Malfoy?” Weasley said with a sharp grin that was more than a little mocking. “He won’t bite, you know.
“It’s fine,” Potter said, shrugging easily once he’d stepped up beside Draco. “Gives us more time to see the sights, anyway.”
“Listen, Malfoy,” he began, and Draco threw a glance over his shoulder to find him standing in the doorway awkwardly holding a hand to the back of his head. “I might not be able to make it out next week. It’ll be the run-up to Christmas, and half the office is out with spattergroit since McLaggen brought it back from his Belfast trip.”
“Fuck no,” Potter breathed and in one fluid motion had flipped open the blanket and straddled him, one hand still gripping Draco’s and the other delving into his hair. His lips were hot where they pressed against Draco’s, and his tongue brushed against his, licked at his lips, stroked the inside of his mouth, not stopping, every movement sending a jolt of arousal through him.
He felt the sharp inhale, the air rushing past him and through Potter’s parted lips. And then their lips met, both slightly chapped from the alcohol and the weeks spent under the Mediterranean sun. Potter’s were warm, and soft, not tentative but at the same time unhurried, brushing gently across his, each touch coaxing his hammering heart higher and higher in his ribcage.
He nodded. “Clear sky, though. I haven’t heard back from the shops so we’ll be working on the brooms today.”
die. And even once they had you under stasis here they had no idea what was wrong with you! Hermione needed to go out and consult with a muggle doctor and then come up with her own treatment. I—just please, don’t fight me on this.”
He and Potter ate breakfast together and at nine o’clock they made their way to the front hall. After some deliberation Draco had decided to wear wizarding attire, in case he was actually photographed by some enterprising journalist—not that he cared about how the public viewed him, he assured himself.
Draco read the words twice, then folded up the heavy linen paper, holding it under his nose and breathing in the familiar floral scent. He knew that his staying here hurt her, and that she didn’t understand it at all, but at the same time. . . .
A flicker of old irritation ignited in his chest and he sighed, exchanging a look with Vince. Then he rose, taking the two steps over to the cabin door and swinging it open.
One of the nearby workers laughed and made eye contact, having clearly overheard at least some of his words. “Never seen a lobster, eh?”
Sadness flickered in Potter’s eyes and Draco felt something clench inside his stomach. “Are you two not close?” came the careful question.
It was becoming more difficult to understand the words and form an intelligible response, since Draco just wanted to sink into the warm pressure. At least a minute passed before he replied, “I’d assumed they were affected by the curse scars being there. Those can prevent healing.”
“I know you just woke up, but do you want to get some sleep? Or we can have a drink and I’ll catch you up on what’s been going on.”
“Draco! I didn’t know you were joining us!” Hermione exclaimed, jumping to her feet and ambushing him with a hug. Draco froze, startled out of his mind, and thankfully the moment only lasted two seconds before she was stepping back. “I think you know everyone, but maybe some introductions just in case?”
“Did you finally realise that the holiday season is long over?” he asked when he entered the room, catching sight of Potter carefully removing decorations and placing them into padded boxes.
“Oh. Thanks. I’ll just bring it up—actually, I’ll walk up with you. That’s fine,” he stammered, and Draco allowed the final fleeting thought of escape to pass across his mind before burying it.
?” he blustered. “Hermione, don’t tell me you knew that he was here and you didn’t even say anything?”
Potter proceeded to tell him the tale behind each of the child-made ornaments, and each one did have its own special story, amazingly enough. There was a light in his eyes that Draco only saw when he spoke of his godson Teddy, or of Weasley’s son Eddie, and he also learned of the children of that Delacour girl and one of the older Weasley siblings, and another Weasley’s adopted daughter, and the twins of yet another Weasley sibling, and so many more.
He found it more and more difficult to distract himself with his research so turned instead toward the trunk that Kreacher had brought him. It was one of those that he had ordered for his space project, and he hadn’t yet begun to enchant it nor any of the other trunks and tents. So, after emptying the clothing and towels into the room’s wardrobe he set to work.
He shook his head as he switched his stirring direction, focusing on his count. Then he set his stirring rod aside and turned toward the man. “I can’t say that I understand that, no. Any of my fond memories of my family exist in my head. I didn’t go back to the Manor for any
“I don’t deserve it.” There was a moment of shocked silence, then his eyes widened in horror at what he’d admitted. He saw the pained look spread across Potter’s face and he couldn’t handle it anymore—as Draco saw his mouth open to say something he Apparated back to his cabin and stumbled backward until he was leaning against the wall, adrenaline causing his heart to hammer against his throat, his breaths coming in short gasps.
He felt the ghost of a hand at the small of his back and then Potter greeted his mother in an even voice. “Mrs Malfoy. Shall we get going?”
There was a shifting sound off to the side, and then from a bit closer he heard Potter tapping on his mobile. Draco opened his eyes warily, looking at the way the bluish light cast a glow over the bottom half of Potter’s face and lit up the lenses of his glasses, their rectangular wire frames glinting slightly.
There was silence for several beats, then Draco said drily, “It’s heartwarming that you care, Potter.”
“Listen, Malfoy,” Potter said quietly many minutes later and Draco swallowed uncomfortably. “Nimbus has told me that they’re not planning on bringing the junior designers in until second quarter, and testing season doesn’t start up again until the second half of March. I’ll be able to come by earlier in the day until then, if that’s better for you?”
He reached out and grabbed one of those hands, sucking in a silent breath when it gripped his fiercely. The mobile fell out of its hold and landed facing upward, where Draco could see in its tiny square display that the primary image there was of them both, appearing lazy and sated on an afternoon that he remembered spending at an olive grove somewhere in Italy. They’d practically gorged themselves on fresh bread and even fresher olive oil, not to mention the bottle of wine shared between them, and had fallen asleep there on the proprietors’ porch before they’d been found and gently asked to leave.
“I imagine you can throw quite impressive tantrums,” Draco said quietly, trying and failing at levity.
Draco frowned at the enthusiasm she was presenting. “There aren’t ingredients here?” he asked, thinking of the long line of purebloods who surely would have had their own stock, at least of the more common items, if not the rare and valuable ones.
“Hmm? Oh, sorry. Just remembering.” Potter cleared his throat. “This was an umbrella stand right next to the front door. No clue why it was left there all the time, since Tonks would trip over it every single time she walked by. It was impressive, actually, her reliably consistent clumsiness.”
He kissed Potter with a desperation he hadn’t felt in years, needing to have his lips, have his tongue, have
A few of the adults laughed, though he spotted a rather conflicted expression on Weasley’s face. Draco swallowed and looked to Hermione helplessly, who she simply smiled kindly and said, “Eddie’s introducing you to Norbert.”
It was a relaxing way to spent the afternoon, he decided, walking the woods, keeping an eye out for the papery bark, listening to the sounds of the shifting temperatures as branches creaked, as melting ice dripped to the forest floor, and as birds called to their neighbours.
“You missed out on some entertainment today, Vince,” he announced after he’d pushed the door open and shut himself inside the warm room. “Potter was so confused about everything that he forgot to be furious.”
“Oh, so you are going to pretend to ignore me. Real mature, Malfoy. And what, are you going to pretend I don’t exist when I keep coming back so that you can work on your brooms? Because I’m not going to let this go. You can’t just—shit fuck!”
Potter huffed, then gave him an odd look that was half frown half smile. “Are you okay to take a break and work on brooms now, or did you need to finish up with this?”
The weather let up on Saturday and Vince returned late that afternoon, proceeding to sulk on his perch and not meet his gaze.
Feeling like he himself was a kettle about to boil Draco ended the moment, breaking eye contact and suddenly standing to bring his glass to the wash basin with a slight tremor in his hand. He may have set it down hard; it was difficult to tell, with his senses alight and every sound magnified. He took a ragged breath, hoping he wasn’t making a fool of himself.
He hesitated, then nodded. “Yes. It was unexpected.” He pursed his lips, then added, “That doesn’t mean that I’m going to be okay with it if you decide to invite all of your friends over, but she was fine. Nice, in fact. In an intense and somewhat terrifying way.”
Draco couldn’t contain his snort any longer and Potter shot him a look, then glanced away. Feeling particularly merciful, he decided to respond. “Yes, Potter, I do plenty without magic.” He looked out at the woods ahead of them and took a deep inhale of the crisp air, releasing it slowly. “I didn’t use any magic for ten and a half years. Some things I do without magic now so that I can feel them, and remind myself that I’m in the real world. Some things I do without magic now because when I put honest work and effort into them, there’s no need to justify to someone who’s already made their mind up about me that the magic was good, and not evil.”
“Yeah. You should be able to start with the Bubble-Head. I held off on my adjustments since you’d be best off starting with the heat protection, and layering that one in as the base before the others, but you said you were going to research that a bit more. I wasn’t sure if you were ready yet, but if you are I can get started with that process on another broom while you work on that one.”
“Are you sure? I’ve learned a bunch of healing spells over the years because of Teddy. I’m sure I can heal it—”
He opened his mouth but no words came out, so he closed it again, biting his lip, thinking of all of the things that he would say if he were a braver person. Then he opened it again and simply said, “I’ll be back within the hour.”
He didn’t hear any stomping following him, though there was some cursing in the distance. Once Draco was back indoors and wiping himself dry with a towel he asked, “Say, do you think he’ll storm back here to yell at me some more?”
Draco looked up, wondering what had happened to Potter. He sounded like an even-tempered, reasonable human being. Then man was looking at him expectantly, gnawing on his lip, so he shook his head and said, “No, I haven’t figured out what I’m going to do about the heat yet.”
Mercifully the man was lying on his stomach, so Draco didn’t have to see his dark nipples, the abs, the trail of black hair leading down to—
He then wondered if it had been partially intentional, as it meant that Draco would need to return to the house for more brewing.
Then Hermione and Azzy were rising to her feet, and as they were the last to leave Draco stood also.
“He absolutely did,” Potter replied in a grim tone. “Apparently Hogwarts is boring, after all the stories he’s had his head filled with. He didn’t get to fight a troll before Christmas so he decided he didn’t feel like returning. Managed to sneak off the train before it left the station, Flooed back to Grimmauld Place, and hid upstairs before I got back home. And Kreacher’s been sneaking him meals.”
Potter cracked a grin. “Yeah, I guess it’s a bit warm.” He stretched out indolently on the bed and Draco swallowed convulsively as his eyes couldn’t help but follow the sight of those rippling muscles.
“I’d planned to go through the safety manual next,” Draco called from the doorway when it became apparent that Potter wasn’t going to wait for him to follow.
The eagle owl gave him an absolutely filthy look before launching into the air, and Vince let out a low, plaintive hoot.
Maybe that was because they knew each other so well, so deeply. Maybe that’s because so much of what had made them not work in the past was dead and buried, and ultimately only important to them insofar as how much they’d grown because of it.
“The wall is wood. It’ll come down.” He looked at the section of wall that he’d be removing, and Potter followed his gaze.
Potter cracked a wry grin and replied, “A little yeah.” Then he sobered and continued, “She refused to tell me anything or listen to anything I had to say until she’d interrogated me about my personal life for the past ten years.”
When they arrived back at the cabin Potter kissed him hard against the front door, then released him, then said his small, “Later, Draco,” and Disapparated without another word.
Potter dithered about the matter for the next hour, because of course he did, but finally agreed to invite his usual group of friends over for lunch. At half ten Draco gathered up his notes from the drawing room and retreated to his room.
“No, but they did demand a considerable amount in reparations. I decided to hand over the Manor since there was no way I would ever step foot in there again, and it was worth more than the gold they wanted. Though I did keep the woods on the grounds,” he added, gesturing around him.
“I can’t believe it,” Draco fumed as he stalked out of the small alcove where the Apparition point was tucked away, letting the heavy door metal bang shut on Potter behind him. He couldn’t even be pleased by the short yelp that the man uttered before he pushed through the door as well.
The light from the mobile returned, though it only captured Potter’s hands which were twisted together in his lap.
There was a loud sigh, then, “I’ll be here the week after. For sure. Just—try to enjoy Christmas, yeah?”
Draco frowned, and set down his fork. “You mean to tell me that you told Granger, and she didn’t feel the need to share it with Weasley.”
When he didn’t make any move to sit down again Draco stood as well, his hand gripping his mug tightly. Vince clicked his talons over on his perch.
Draco nodded and lowered his gaze to focus on his food. An orphan of the War. He should have known better than to ask.
When he arrived he could see his mother strolling up the front lane as if the land was still hers, while Potter had opted to wait by the gate.
It was a minute or two before he heard Potter’s feet hit the front step. “You ordered a dozen brooms. No one needs a dozen brooms, unless it’s a team, or a school, or a company that sends employees out on long flights. What could you possibly need that many brooms for?”
“Then you can live with your mother for the next month.” There were a few beats of silence while Draco considered how much of a nightmare
He gave a curt nod and stalked around to the front of the cabin to retreat inside, gathering up his mass of partially-frozen hair and tying it up, then getting to work with a towel. He’d just dropped a towel onto his chair and slumped into it when Potter entered, dried himself off with a charm, then put the kettle on like he owned the place.
Draco was just looking over the assortment of ‘junk’, as Hermione had called it, when Kreacher popped in.
“I promise you,” he continued, “that yes, it was a stupid mistake, but I have no intention of endangering myself with these tests. The whole reason for the tests is so that I can anticipate and prevent anything bad happening when I head up there. I’m sorry I worried you, but it was not intentional, I assure you.”
The weight of it felt glorious on his tongue and the taste, the smells, they filled his senses. Draco savoured the moment, briefly overwhelmed before the stinging in his scalp grounded him and he moved, mercilessly sucking him down, one hand stroking himself while the other held onto Potter for dear life. He heard groans and gasps from above him, each sound prompting an uncontrollable moan from himself.
“Hmm,” came the verbose reply. Draco finished with one branch and placed it into a hole, packing the earth tightly into place around it, then moved onto the next branch.
“At least you haven’t had to deal with Mother’s bird, right? She doesn’t seem to be sticking to the weekly guilt letter anymore.”
Vince returned in an almighty snit, dropping a mangled and bloody field mouse on his chair after he was let in, then promptly swooped out again to spend the next several days in the woods.
Potter squeezed his hand then, but didn’t look up, so Draco said, “It’s all right. I’m alive, and it’s all right.”
They sat there in the quiet drawing room for a little while longer, before Draco said, “I’m not necessarily going to attend more Saturday lunches.”
Off to the side Vince clicked a bit as he shifted on his perch, and glancing over he saw that the owl was apparently communicating something to Potter. Bloody traitor. He finished with the dishes and turned around, leaning back against the counter.
Draco replied, “Absolutely not,” at the same time that Potter firmly said, “Yes.” He looked at the other man with a brow raised.
“What do you think, will today be the day?” He let his head rest back against the cushion, his eyes sliding shut of their own accord. “It’s been six days since the last letter.”
There was a rough sigh, then the question, “And despite that, and the fact that there’s the same danger in space, you still want to continue your work and go up there?”
Finally he lifted his gaze to meet Draco’s and said, “Look, I’m sorry I told her. I know that you value your privacy here, and I shouldn’t have ignored that.”
“I know,” Draco said through a sigh. He looked at the conjured loveseat that was still there, taking up valuable space inside, then rolled his eyes and stood to push it against the wall. There was no sense in Vanishing it when Potter would probably just want it again the next time he returned.
At the next thrust Potter’s eyes widened impossibly further and he gasped a hoarse, “Yes!” and Draco couldn’t have stopped if he’d tried. Their movements grew more and more frantic the longer they pressed on, and he found that he couldn’t look away from those bright green eyes, even as he saw a flush burning across the man’s face, neck and chest, even as Potter’s hand reach up toward him to tug at his hair.
Then he sat there on his heated front step thinking about the warming temperatures and realised it was probably late enough in the season that the birch trees would be ready for tapping, and set out with several containers and his tree taps.
His insides clenched at the use of his name. “Potter. Thanks for putting me up last night, I don’t know what came over me.”
Her gaze somehow became even more piercing. “What was the significant danger with spaceflight that I brought up when I came to see you the first time, one which we have
A few hours later, after he’d eaten, stared vacantly at the ceiling for a bit, packed away the leftover stew, then trimmed some of Vince’s shed feathers into quills for the hell of it, he grabbed the blanket that hung by the door and traipsed outside, navigating the dark woods with ease until he reached a wide clearing.
The words were quiet, but they reverberated in Draco’s mind, and he considered them. He thought about his interactions with Potter since he’d first come to the cabin that autumn, angrily brandishing Draco’s letter. He thought about the questions, the demands, the outbursts, and how they had transformed into confusion, and flustered awkwardness, and kindness. That transformation had occurred in such a short amount of time that he couldn’t believe it would last. It would be foolish of him to believe such a thing.
Finally Potter managed to find his words. “We’ll need a bigger space if you’re doing anything to the brooms today. Unless you just wanted to check them over today, and then get to work another day?” A pause, then, “Or does this room expand?”
Not an Auror. That was unexpected. Suddenly, his tiny amount of interest in this conversation vanished as exhaustion swept through him. “Merlin, you always were so much work,” he muttered, running a hand over his face, before saying louder, “Well, say your piece.” Then he turned walked back into his cabin, leaving the door open while he retrieved the previous day’s soup from the pantry and set it to heating on the small wood stove.
They walked over to a bench not far along and sat at opposite ends, their cans between them as they faced out over the water. He took a cautious bite, and the sweetness of the lobster contrasted beautifully with the saltiness of the buttered and grilled roll, the crunch of the little bits of celery, and the creaminess of whatever else had been mixed in to hold it all together.
Potter shrugged, seemingly oblivious to the effect he had on Draco, and scooped up another mouthful of red-tainted food.
“It doesn’t matter either way for me. I’m usually up with the sun, so by around eight o’clock this time of year. And as I’ve said before, if I’m not in when you arrive then I’m around,” he said, gesturing out the window.
“He seemed out of sorts today,” he said, and heard Vince clicking from his spot at the window. “I hope he finds his brain before his next visit, otherwise progress will be unbearably slow.”
“We can probably test them out tomorrow. We can try an overnight infusion on a few brooms that haven’t been enchanted yet?”
Draco remained for several seconds, taking slow, steadying breaths, before turning on his heel and Apparating to the front step of the townhouse in Bristol. Immediately Potter’s concerned gaze was on him, but he didn’t say anything and only waited for Draco to rap on the door with the polished pewter knocker.
His lips quirked slightly and he concentrated on the weight of the arm on his chest, and the fingers that were tracing lines across his ribs.
They mostly ate in silence, with Potter occasionally looking up at him with a concerned expression. Draco felt some relief when Hermione arrived and saved them from the tension, though she was giving him far too many assessing looks still.
But the people seemed friendly enough, which was certainly a point in their favour because with a 12-month assignment as part of the latest International Cooperation Initiative, it was somewhat concerning how many countries Potter had already managed to piss off with his inability to just be a normal adult.
“Sometimes I wonder if you have an internal clock that screeches at you if you haven’t blown something up in too long,” he said once they’d arrived and made their way to the attic brewing station.
So he ignored the man, focused on not dropping the thing and crushing his feet, and only turned once he’d placed it on the next row.
The exchange went smoothly, and Draco considered then nodded. “I think this one’s stronger between the two,” he said, shaking the broom with the stone in the handle. “Agreed?”
Finally he lowered himself to the bed again, resting his head on Potter’s shoulder while his hand splayed across his chest, his fingers playing with the damp hair there.
Draco nodded mutely. The dishes, or maybe even the bag, must have been charmed because the smells of the foods were quickly filling the cabin, and he could see steam rising from several of the platters.
The breeze made the leaves in the trees at the edge of the clearing whisper. The night air was crisp, but it was warm compared to the frigid air in Azkaban.
“Reading my post now, are you? If I’d bothered to think about it, I’d have guessed you might have left your unfortunate stalker behaviour behind. Say, a decade ago.”
. His hands scrabbled at the clasps of his cloak, releasing it and fumbling with his robes, letting out a groan of frustration when he found yet
Draco shook his head, a wry smile hinting at the edge of his mouth, and brushed past him to step inside. “Come on in, you idiot, before you hurt yourself.”
“It’s been in the bag the whole time. The bag’s been here, my place, and the office. Oh, and it also came with me to the stadium outside of Liverpool by mistake but your brooms stayed inside the whole time.”
And then Tuesday arrived, and Draco found himself feeling bereft. He certainly didn’t miss the stupid classes, and he enjoyed the solitude, but at the same time he wasn’t able to immerse himself in his reading, nor did a long hike around the woods help to assuage his listlessness. On Wednesday he felt much the same, and ended up heading out in the snow to the forest’s edge to collect some rose hips and haws, spending much of the rest of the day preparing them to be dried for lack of anything else to do.
He took a slow sip of his soup, waiting. Based on the shifting expression on Potter’s face, he was having some sort of internal crisis.
He busied himself with the tea, trying to get himself back under control. By the time he turned to hand over Potter’s mug he felt like he’d mostly managed, though Potter looked out of sorts as well. He was certainly carrying himself much more awkwardly than usual, which was saying a lot, and he was avoiding Draco’s gaze. Once the mug was passed off he grabbed some dishes and utensils, and they prepared themselves each a plate.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up. He knew that his mother had said she was lonely, but to only ask to be reacquainted with her estranged sister. . . . He frowned. “What else.”
The following day Draco was aware of some speculative looks being directed at him by Hermione but he blithely ignored them and focused on their work.
“Hello boys!” she called brightly as she entered, taking a quick moment to glance at each of them in their seats before she shut the door. “Draco, I hope you’re still behaving?”
Vince shifted on his perch and opened his beak for a moment, but the rain was hammering too loudly on the roof to hear the clicking of his talons nor the sound of his hoot.
Hermione didn’t take a seat. She remained standing, leaning back against the counter with her arms crossed.
Kreacher immediately disappeared, then reappeared a few seconds later along with a long dining table that looked like it could easily seat twenty. A snap of his fingers later had the table arranged along the length of the room, running under the open window.
He was aware of Potter’s receding footsteps but decided it didn’t really matter to him what the man was up to, so he finished his work, made his marking on the ground, then circled back around to the front to stow the spade. He then found Potter slowly walking around one end of the cabin, running a hand along its log wall while he looked at it as if he hadn’t ever seen it before.
Potter nodded. “All right. We’ll do that.” Then a faint crease formed between his brows in the barest hint of a frown. A few seconds later his expression cleared and he gave Draco a slanted look, asking, “How else can we be of use to each other?”
“And when Hermione and Ron broke it off for real she was there for him at work to make sure he held it together when they were out in the field, and things just took off from there, the way they tell it. When they started talking about starting a family Ron left the Auror force and helped George open up a branch of the shop in Hogsmeade, and he manages it now. They didn’t want their children to have two parents risking their lives daily.”
He scratched at his beard, and sighed again. “If you hadn’t spoken at our trials I’d have probably gotten life. They wanted to make an example of me, for the pureblood families and for the sympathisers who were still in Hogwarts. And my mother probably would have suffered far worse than house arrest.”
Potter’s smile was a pleased one. “She’s a terror in the kitchen, but she does know how to cook,” he said fondly.
“It’s empty up there. It’s quiet up there. There’s no good. There’s no bad, or wrong, or evil. No letters. No expectations. No people.”
Well, he could Disapparate but he knew that it would upset not only Potter but also Hermione. And ultimately it would not be worth all of the shouting that would ensue from one of them, nor the threats from the other.
“Harry, it’s two-thirty in the morning. You have until nine to enjoy your sanctuary before I come by to see Draco. Don’t even think about locking me out.” It took Draco a few seconds to spot the silvery otter that was perched on the floor next to the coffee table, and once it had relayed its message it dissipated into silver mist.
A minute later the air was clear and all signs of the trunk vanished. He sat on the edge of the bed staring at his reflection, dabbing at the litany of scratches that covered his face with the corner of the towel.
The new addition gave Draco plenty to do throughout the rest of the week. On Tuesday he went on a long hike out to the creek and slowly brought back several large flat stones to install as the floor. The entire process took many hours, since he didn’t have any sort of wagon to assist with transporting them, and refused to use magic on principle. By the time he’d returned home it was quite dark out and he could make just make out Vince watching him through the front window, looking utterly unimpressed.
Once the toast was golden he slathered on some butter and marmalade and nibbled at it, his appetite beginning to take form. Once he’d finished his second slice the kettle was whistling and he prepared himself a cup of tea. The muffled sound of raised voices made its way down from the ground floor so he poured a second cup, and a third in case Hermione wanted one.
Potter huffed, raking a hand through his hair. “Well, we knew that, didn’t we? Look—I’ll explain something. You’ll want to heal that, though,” he said, waving toward Draco’s face.
Draco swallowed and looked away, hating the thought of needing to be near another person constantly for a whole month. He liked his cabin. He liked his quiet forest.
He knew enough to not bother blaming the alcohol when he held onto the warm body next to him tighter than he’d done before, unable to face those bright green eyes but feeling them burn into him nonetheless. He fell asleep to the sensation of fingers carding gently through his hair while his heart continued to hammer in his chest, his guilt and fear refusing to let him go.
Potter sighed, lifted his hand toward Draco and then dropped it, worrying his lip. “See you there, then.” A moment later he Disapparated.
So instead he rose, grabbed one of his towels, and set off toward the clearing, grumbling to himself because Vince wasn’t there to complain to.
On Monday morning Draco sent off requests for owl order forms to half a dozen companies he knew of that made luggage, tents, and sheds, then immersed himself in some reading. If the texts he had purchased on space previously had been easy enough for him to understand, given his moderate knowledge of muggle terminology, Hermione’s book was not the same. He was frequently flipping to the glossary to check on the complex words, and had even started a list of words that weren’t defined in the glossary nor in the text itself. But she had told him that she would look through any words or concepts that he was confused about when she visited next, and explain what she could.
Potter huffed, a reluctant-looking smile spreading across his face. “Always such a prat,” he mumbled, before taking the two steps forward and leaning into him, bringing their lips together for a long, tender kiss.
“I told her because I know that she can help, and that she’d want to help, and because I don’t want you to fucking die.” And despite the fact that Draco was a good three inches taller than Potter he felt small, trapped between the man’s intensity that seemed to fill the room and the edge of the basin, unable to do anything except look into his eyes.
“You managed to fall asleep at the table last night. I hope you don’t mind that I brought you up here.”
“I remember coming here a few times when I was young. Before my grandaunt passed. The house looks much less . . . sinister now than I remember.”
They were too close now, and he could feel the hem of Potter’s cloak brush up against his calves as it fluttered in the breeze.
Then there was a huff of laughter, gentle in tone, and a murmur that Draco didn’t understand. What he did understand was the brief squeezing sensation and the loud crack before they were somewhere else entirely.
“Draco, we’ve had posh food at every island stop so far. You can have your caught-an-hour-earlier whole grilled octopus tomorrow when we get to the next port. Tonight we’re doing souvlaki.”
Draco tried to not look around while he made his way to the family’s gravesite off on the north side of the grounds but he found his gaze drawn to his old home, taking in the tall windows, wondering if its new residents were standing inside watching them pass by. After several minutes of walking his mother stopped at the edge of the cemetery and Draco stepped up beside her, noting that she had brought with her the flowers she’d mentioned, and was holding them against her chest.
All trace of pleasantries vanished as they delved into a discussion of the various items on their list, and it was determined that they would be testing the thresholds of the Atmospheric Charms, Hermione having prepared some spells that would send the temperature plummeting within a designated radius. They had moved onto a conversation about muggle heat sources when a loud crack outside announced Potter’s arrival.
“Drink straight from the bottle then if you’re so inclined,” Draco replied. He had a small sip of the ouzo, letting the burn coat the inside of his mouth before taking a longer one, shutting his eyes with a soft groan.
Draco looked away and stared hard at the hearth. “I didn’t understand half of what he was saying. More than half.”
He nodded, curious about the supposed secure facility that she had access to. “Absolutely. We’ll meet here?”
The sting of his scalp shot a piercing jolt through him, his arousal intensified by the confusing slice of mild pain and he screwed his eyes shut, his head dipping slightly as he fought to hold on and not come just quite yet. And then there were fingernails scraping down the sensitive skin of his scarred and mottled chest and he cried out, the sensation surprising him into a few uncontrollable snaps of his hips and then he was spilling his climax into Potter, hips jerking hard into him.
The rest of the day passed agonisingly slowly. He thought it odd, given that his time in Potter’s house had been fairly lazy and unproductive overall, but a long walk through the woods failed to settle him, and he found himself unable to focus on reading for more than half an hour at a time.
And yet, here it was, that moment. And it was fine. Better than fine, actually, given that Potter had strangely invited him to share in his reminiscence.
“I made it!” Potter said barely half a second after the crack of his Apparition sounded in the empty car park. Draco shuffled the photo back into the stack that he always carried around with him, tucking them all into his pocket. “Were you waiting long?”
A minute later, once Draco’s face looked much more intact, he asked drily, “I suppose you’ll be taking my trunks away now too?”
Potter gave him a lopsided smile then said, “Later, Malfoy, Vince,” and a few seconds later had stepped out the door, grabbed the broom, and Disapparated.
And suddenly it was as if the afternoon of academic discussion hadn’t happened, and he was out of his depths. He rose to his feet as she stood and donned her coat, and he followed her out to the front of the cabin. She bade him a perfectly polite and friendly farewell, told him to give her love to Harry, and then she was gone.
“Silly me, I thought you were the confusing one.” Potter’s face contorted into a wry smile, though it looked stilted. Then he sighed again, the expression dropping into weariness.
Draco took a deep breath and looked over, taking in Potter’s disheveled appearance and visible weariness. “I think you need some proper sleep.”
, but also after reading his muggle books further the larger surface area of the shielding would likely cause even
He shook his head, then gestured broadly toward the collection of vials and jars at the right end of the table. “Nothing left, at least until we test those.”
The next day Draco rose with a headache and after tidying up a bit, he set out on a long walk, enjoying the crunch of his boots through the ice-topped fresh snow, keeping his eyes on the ground in order to spot the various wildlife tracks.
“Yeah,” Potter muttered, stepping close and clasping a hand over where Draco held the Portkey. “Maybe we should just not go back.”
He was languidly sprawled on the loveseat some time later, trying it out while he enjoyed his morning tea when a crack sounded outside and was shortly followed by a knock at his door.
Unable to summon forth any words Draco nodded, and grabbed his coat. As he prepared to Disapparate he heard the words, “Later, Draco,” and then he was standing on his front step shivering from something other than the cold.
“I didn’t promise anything about you,” Potter repeated firmly. “And she’s not going to suddenly show up here either. She knows that when she sees you again, it’ll be on your terms.”
“Ready?” Potter asked and he nodded, then an instant later they were standing in a drawing room that contained a very tall Christmas tree.
“That should be good for today,” he announced, handing the broom back over to Potter. “Keep it out of the bag. If it manages to retain the Atmospheric Charms for another week then I’ll move along to the Sticking Charms.” He frowned, thinking about how he’d want to place those so that they’d be secure enough to hold him when he wanted them to, but also release him without needing to be dispelled. “I might need to commit further assault, so prepare for that.”
“Okay. . . . Then I can probably get those together within the next few days. Are you going to be working on them here, or at the Manor?”
“Well, that’s the good thing about this,” the man said, glancing up at him briefly before looking back down.
“And I swear that you were only half-taught how to speak English,” Draco returned, feeling the corner of his mouth twitching.
He was just hesitating before putting on the garment when Potter said, both sounding like the word was a question and at the same time not, “Stay?”
Draco leaned forward to swing the door open and the man stepped in a moment later, giving him a shy smile.
Then he stripped his clothes and vanished into the bathroom, deciding to wallow in a hot bath and try to forget about the turbulent thoughts and emotions were ceaselessly coursing through him.
For the first half hour of flight through the water Draco kept a careful eye on the size of the bubble, the quality of the air he was breathing, the temperature, and they remained constant as far as he could tell. Then he began to actually pay attention to his surroundings, and while the sand, rocks, and seashells of the ocean floor near the coast weren’t terribly interesting, the landscape changed once he reached Mewstone Ledge and glimpsed the forest of kelp swaying in the current, the tiny fish flitting in and out of sight.
“Malfoy. I didn’t hear from you to say this week was bad, so I figured I’d stop by and see how you were doing.”
me for trying to answer a reasonable question, instead of telling you if you can make a broom breathe. No, brooms can’t breathe, Malfoy. But sure. Slap a Bubble-Head on one, why the hell not.”
“Please tell me she doesn’t have any other portraits that she can travel to. The last thing I need is for her to be visiting my mother.”
“That’s all for today, I think,” he then said, turning back toward Potter. “I don’t want to add anything else until I can be sure that those charms won’t unravel.”
“You know that’s how they immediately know we’re foreign, right?” Draco said once his could control his face. He went to take a bite of his eggs then had to set his fork down, wincing as the hot sauce residue in the air made contact with his
“Honestly, you and Harry are just as bad as each other! Rest!” And she had the nerve to smack his arm.
Something about the house was familiar, but with the aching in his joints and the exhaustion that was catching up to him Draco couldn’t spare the focus to try to figure out why. He was led to a bedroom, where felt an overwhelmingly warm sensation in his chest when he saw Vince sitting on a perch next to the window, and somehow managed to get himself onto the bed before sleep overtook him.
Draco and Hermione both agreed with that and set to work copying over the entire set up of their current working model to a new broom. Once they’d finished that Hermione checked her wristwatch and pursed her lips.
“I still don’t know why that’s any of your business,” he replied, stirring his soup as it warmed, his back to the man.
Even tied back in a knot, his hair was wild. And he’d known that, in a disconnected sort of way, but seeing how it clumped together like an animal’s matted fur was a different sort of understanding. It was also no longer the uniform platinum that it once had been, instead looking more muted, some sections more golden, others dulled like dishwater, and he had some strands of silver in a few spots.
He nodded. “It’s not constant anymore, but just after waking, and if I spend too long sitting without moving.”
Then Hermione led them to a small dimly-lit room with a glass wall that overlooked a tall empty chamber built like a lift shaft.
They remained silent while Potter prepared their mugs, helped himself to the tea bags, and stood next to the wood stove not looking at Draco, intermittently clenching and unclenching his fists. Several minutes later he handed a steaming mug of tea over to him, then dropped into a conjured chair and pinned him with an intent look.
The next morning several owls arrived bearing order forms and after perusing them Draco sent off a note to Hermione asking her opinion on a few of the selections. He received a response by that afternoon and soon after sent Vince out with several orders for luggage and portable structures.
He hadn’t needed to wait long for the books he’d ordered to arrive and those kept him occupied while the leaves outside turned to rusty oranges and fiery reds. Those same leaves were just starting to fall a few weeks later when his usual late afternoon nap was interrupted by the loud crack of Apparition outside and his eyes snapped open.
He set to work heating up some dinner, washing the mugs while he waited, replaying the conversation in his head. He supposed he shouldn’t have been surprised that Potter was worried about him dying. The man would likely blame himself should anything happen to Draco, since he was involved in the project. And Potter did have a bloody complex.
“She said that she wanted you to be here on Thursday mornings so that the three of us can work on things together.”
“I know that I have always put so much pressure on you, so many expectations. Know that I only want you to be happy.” She reached up and rested her cool hand against his cheek, and held it there for a moment before reclaiming it. Then she set off down the lane.
If pressed, Draco knew that had he been inclined to order their meals at any one of the stops over the course of this assignment, he’d have been able to handle things just fine for both of them.
“Really. You know, I’ll leave the window open from now on. It’s decently warm out already, so you’re free to come and go as you please again. And I’m sorry.”
He finished the adjustments on the broom and handed it back to Potter, then asked for a new broom. He applied the same charms to that one and conjured a bow on the end in green and silver with a flourish, startling a laugh out of the other man. Then he dropped onto the ground next to the rock, only realising how close he was to Potter’s legs once he was seated.
There was a snort beside him and he cracked his eyes open and looked over. Next to him Potter was now sprawled out on his side facing him, his head resting in his hand as he propped it up with his elbow.
There was silence for the better part of a minute as Draco watched Potter, while he seemed to have some sort of internal crisis.
On Wednesday he dug up the earth in the space where he would be building and busied himself with setting the stones. The rest of the week and into the weekend he carefully measured and cut logs for the walls, and planed planks of wood for the roof.
like nothing else has been, not since—well, it’s been real. And Britain will always be there later. I can always go back. But. . . . I don’t want to not do this now and always regret it when it’s ten years down the road and I feel trapped.”
Draco nodded; he’d noticed the same when the front step had failed to accumulate any snow, slush, or frost over the past week.
“You really need a table,” he said as Draco retrieved two plates and some cutlery and popped the kettle on.
“I don’t think I’m ready to do any spellwork today, but you’re welcome to come in for a bit,” he allowed, hesitating a moment before pushing the door open and stepping inside.
“No,” Potter interrupted quietly, and his eyes blazed. “That is such bullshit and you know it.” He took a step closer.
When the lift doors opened a pair of witches emerged, and though their eyes slid over Draco when they walked by they gave no hint of recognition. And then the lift doors closed, and he spun to face Hermione.
Then on Sunday Hermione revealed that she’d made some calculations and had a solution for the radiation protection, and they tested the strength of that protection until the levels showed adequate in the chamber.
Potter’s next moan contained a whimper and Draco set to work, sliding those fingers in and out of the warmth, curling them, twisting them, seeking the spot that would make Potter scream.
The package from Flourish and Blotts arrived the next day while Draco was in class, so when he returned he dealt with the rest of the woodpile, finished assembling the perch for Vince, and settled into his chair with a mug of tea, a quilt, and his new books, not rising until it was too dark to make out the words on the pages. Then he lit a lantern and placed it on the windowsill next to him, and continued to read for hours.
Draco nodded. “You’re still welcome to stop by,” he said, unable to help himself. Potter chewed on his lip and looked down, so Draco added, “I’d like you to stop by.”
that were stacked in a corner of Potter’s kitchen. Draco hadn’t read a single issue since his release, not wanting to face how the world had carried on without him. And as he read the more recent issues, he felt a muddled mixture of jealousy and pride for his former friends who seemed to be doing rather well for themselves, considering.
He started to ascend, squinting upward, looking for signs of faint daylight filtering in through the water. But the water remained dark, after he’d ascended what surely should have been the majority of the distance to the surface. Even the light of his wand was dimming, in fact, and he blinked rapidly to try to bring the area above him into focus. Or was it above him?
Potter broke their skin contact then, releasing the mug and sitting back in his chair, running one hand through his hair while the other one rested in his lap. “All right. I get that. I completely understand being hurt because of stupid mistakes,” he admitted, then asked, “I confuse you?”
“Not quite 800. I’m glad we checked that.” She opened the drawer and removed the broom, handing it over to Potter who whimpered faintly. Draco rolled his eyes at him; yes, the bristles were slightly singed but otherwise it looked much the same.
In direct counterpoint to the literal meaning of his words the man then left the kitchen, leaving Draco to the spinning of his thoughts and the hammering of his heart.
“You don’t. . . .” There was another of his painful-looking facial contortions, then he somehow managed to look both chagrined and curious. Though perhaps the curiosity shouldn’t have been all that surprising given that Potter was a perpetually nosey individual with no concept of privacy. “Never mind. Right. Er, how long are you out of classes for?”
Draco bend down to retrieve the bottle of oil, then looked for his wand where he’d dropped it, frowning when it wasn’t there. Then he noticed that his wand was securely tucked into an inner pocket of his coat, where he’d put it earlier that day.
Draco turned away to check the temperature of the jars. They were still quite hot, so he stepped away and sat in his chair. And he took some pleasure in not offering his visitor a place to sit.
He sat down in his chair and flipped open one of his science books on his lap to read while he slowly sipped at the broth. When he found that his thoughts were drifting too much to be able to focus he set the book aside, and instead curled up inside his quilt, allowing his mind to wander.
He sighed, thinking of the reasons that he’d wanted to go to space in the first place. Draco held his steaming mug in front of his mouth, mulling it over, deciding how much of that subject he felt like broaching, and finally settled on the cowardly answer of, “I’m not sure.”
“Potter.” He spoke slowly and took care to enunciate clearly, wondering if it would help the simpleton understand. “I am going to be enchanting the brooms. These charms will be adapted to work with the brooms. You are supposed to tell me if these charms will cause any issues with those that are already on the
All too soon it was mid-afternoon and Hermione kicked them out of her lab, escorting them to the lift before retreating into the Department of Mysteries.
Vince clearly sensed something because he suddenly let out a rare throaty growl and beat his wings a few times from his perch, causing them both to start.
He swallowed. He could certainly handle those types of barbs. Just not children. Or smiles. “That’s right. Because I’m not calling you anything other than Weasley.”
Then the footsteps approached again, and from too close he heard, “Very nice, Malfoy. I’m impressed.”
Draco furrowed his brow, then took away from Potter and lowered himself onto the sofa, wincing as his hips throbbed. “You mentioned you’d be getting in touch with Hermione?”
There was a definite hesitation, and he was mildly curious about what sort of expression or gesture the man was doing behind his back, but a few seconds later he heard footsteps then the door closed.
When he finally awoke it was to find Vince perched in a tree on the edge of the clearing giving him a judging stare.
There was movement next to him and Potter sank onto his own towel, extending his legs ahead of him and holding out a pair of glasses that he must have grabbed. Draco poured a measure into each then took one of them after he’d screwed the lid back on the bottle and set it aside.
He remained in his spot on the landing as the two men climbed the stairs, Potter’s arm brushing against his as he passed and Weasley pinning him with a look of suspicion. Once they were behind the closed door of the drawing room he finally followed Hermione down to the ground floor.
The fact that his partner was actually saying the words, and not simply racing off and doing it, gave Draco pause. “How long have you been considering this?” he asked carefully.
He spun around. “What do you mean, this isn’t going to work?” he hissed, his eyes narrowed. “I’ve paid for the brooms. I’ve allowed you to put ridiculous restrictions on my access to those brooms. I make the simple request to know what charms are on the bloody things and you wait until now to tell me that I can’t?”
Draco approached, feeling the bubble of warmth in the air intensify once he was close enough, the charms on the rock overlaying those on the brooms he held, noting that Potter stiffened slightly at his proximity. So he stepped back, giving a bit more space, then handed over the broom with the stone set into the handle.
“No, I’m not telling you how you should remember your past. I’m simply saying that I personally cannot relate.” Then he frowned as he cast his gaze over the stacks of refuse again. “Then again, I can’t imagine you have a reasonable excuse for retaining this quantity of taxidermy.”
Potter smiled fondly. “I’m his godfather, I get to be the fun one. Then again, he didn’t hear any of those stories from me.” His smile turned sad and Draco looked away, feeling a bit of relief that they’d arrived at the clearing.
He imagined that he could hear Potter’s teeth grinding. Something that he’d considered long-dead inside him smirked at the thought.
“Oh, for—” Potter huffed, rolling his eyes, then grabbed his arm and hauled him down the hill until they bottomed out in a wider intersection, taking a quick look to either side before strolling leisurely across.
On Monday Draco rose early out of habit and after a quick breakfast he set to work cleaning off a few of the extra planks of wood that he still had left from his roof extension and set to work fastening them into a door, which he was able to install by that evening.
at how Potter could somehow turn being the most infuriating man on the planet into something charming.
Frequently Draco would be working on his research and Potter would approach from behind and release his hair from its hold, and the next thing he knew they would both be in a sweaty heap on the drawing room floor. Or the kitchen floor. Or the hallway floor.
“Plantain crisp?” Potter offered, holding the bag out while he pulled out his mobile and began tapping at the buttons.
Draco was drinking his breakfast tea in a post-morning-blow-job-against-the-counter haze the following week when Potter asked him something, then had to repeat the words because they absolutely did not make any sort of sense the first time.
He stumbled to the nearest bathroom and showered as quickly as he could, hearing Kreacher briefly popping in to leave a towel for him while he was rinsing the conditioner from his hair. After quickly drying off and aiming a Cleaning Charm at the previous day’s clothes he got dressed and tripped down the stairs while working a comb through his hair.
They hadn’t yet made it to the bedroom, nor had they managed to enjoy each other in any new ways; as soon as Potter looked at Draco like
There was silence for a few seconds, but he felt the bubble of warmth from the broom wrap around him, giving away Potter’s approach. He kept his head facing upward and shut his eyes.
Amid the loud bang of the trunk shattering there was quite a bit of screeching from Vince, understandably. As the splinters rained around him Draco was distantly aware of the noises from downstairs changing, then the sounds of rapid footsteps pounding up the stairs.
“I don’t think I’d ever realised he was this awkward in school,” he mused as he poured the hot liquid into a large mug.
He considered, then gave a tight shrug, wincing slightly as he felt a dull throb in his right shoulder. “If you wish. She lives at number nine Isambard Park in Clifton. And you can relay that what I told her when I was released still stands.”
Once they’d made their way to the clearing Draco compared the lingering charmwork around the piece of wood, the two brooms, and the rock, determining that the Extension Charms on Potter’s bag did in fact cause the Atmospheric Charms to fade much faster. In comparing the materials the stone seemed to retain the heat better, so Draco located a smaller one nearby and set to work enchanting it. Then he looked over at Potter.
Draco reflected on the past couple of hours and blinked some more. “I can honestly say I’m not quite sure what happened. I somehow managed to entertain Eddie, though I’ve no clue how. They were all rather friendly though, so I suppose you can say ‘I told you so.’”
Draco looked at him steadily for a few seconds, not detecting any sarcasm, only a strange sort of bumbling awkwardness so he snorted softly and shook his head. “Get out of here, Potter, before you somehow manage to strain yourself.” Then he stepped inside.
Potter’s face was doing its painful-looking contortions again, so Draco finished his meal and rose to deal with the tea. When he brought the mugs over the man asked in his most hesitant voice yet, “Would you want to meet them?”
A moan tore through him as he rocked up against the man above him, the friction wonderful and agonising at the same time. As Potter’s lips finally released his own to lick and bite along his neck he murmured, “Off,” tugging at his shirt.
Draco did sneer at that. As horrid as Potter was, McLaggen was practically a caricature of his worst personality traits. “Absolutely not. It’ll have to be you.”
Finally, when Draco was feeling less surly and Potter appeared to have as much energy as a new crup, they headed out to the car that had been arranged for their journey. He ignored when his partner jokingly offered him the keys, then leaned back against the passenger door when the man abruptly turned and jogged back toward the counter.
The remainder of the meal was spent quietly; their sleep the night before had been atrocious between the International Portkey from London and the time difference, so once they’d finished eating they each nursed several cups of incredible coffee.
Draco was just contemplating reaching over to the half-empty glass of water on the table next to the bed when a woman wearing bright green Healer robes entered at a brisk pace, followed by Potter.
Draco brought his hands to his face and rubbed over his cheeks harshly, then scratched at his beard. He didn’t even know what to say to explain how much of an idiot he’d been. He could practically see the words on the page in front of him, explaining about the different gases in his body forming into bubbles where they didn’t belong and wreaking havoc.
“Teddy’s coming home for the Easter hols,” Potter said carefully, and Draco was momentarily thrown by the non sequitur. “His birthday is a few weeks later than that this year but we’ll be celebrating it then. I know that I can’t ask you to not go to space, but . . . I’d like for you to meet Teddy and Andromeda. At least once, before you go.”
Draco frowned as soon as his hand closed around the handle. There was a trace amount of heat lingering in the wood, but it wasn’t emanating and circulating warm air as it should have been following the previous week’s session. He immediately set to work, sinking onto the cold, slightly damp ground and was peripherally aware of Potter taking the dozen or so paces toward his usual rock.
Before he forgot Draco jotted out a quick note for Flourish and Blotts and set it on his work surface, hoping that they could be as quick with fulfilling this request as they’d been with the previous order. “Vince, do you mind grabbing that once the rain lets up? No need to head out in this mess.”
“Ah, no. We discussed things like civilised adults.” Vince shifted on his perch, his talons clicking mockingly, and Draco shot him a dirty look.
He was working on his third row of heavy logs for the walls of the addition when a loud crack rang out followed immediately by the sound of his door banging open, a yell that he couldn’t make out over the sound of the ice pellets peppering the ground, then a screech from Vince. Then the door slammed shut and seconds later Potter stomped around the corner.
Draco worked slowly and carefully, wanting to make sure that whatever happened, the tests the following day were productive so that they could return to their prior progress. By the time his stomach was demanding dinner he had finished, and after a quiet meal he and Potter retired to the drawing room, where Kreacher had two glasses and a bottle of some sort waiting for them.
“So, as I was saying,” Draco said while he turned to look out the window, “Hermione came by yesterday.”
Potter’s nostrils flared, and Draco watched in interest as he seemed to be already working himself up into a lather. “Yeah, well, that was before you took it upon yourself to assault a perfectly good broom.”
Draco looked at her mulishly and didn’t answer, knowing that she was right, but also that as an Unspeakable she probably
Draco spent much of the following few days in the same way, though not all of the collected sap was turned into syrup. Some he bottled as it was, and a few bottles-worth were mixed with syrup and allowed to ferment.
“Enjoy!” she said cheerily, then looked away as a couple wandered over, looking to be perusing the menus of all of the little huts.
Instead, he spent the time digging deeper into his muggle books about space, learning what he could about the
Draco shrugged. “Just the part where the door will go. I still need to do measurements to make sure I line things up properly.”
He was given an intent look then, as Potter slowly and almost carefully sat in his chair. Which was slightly amusing, but Draco figured that he had been possessive enough about it in the past that it wasn’t such a surprise. He just gave Potter a small smile, which seemed to confuse the poor man further. Which led Draco to hide his broadening smile behind his mug.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up, he was so surprised by the insight from someone so utterly unexpected. “Very good, Potter,” he said slowly, giving him an appraising look.
one’s apparently going to sit there until I write my mother, though, so perhaps that’s what you heard.”
Draco brought a hand to his jaw and scratched at his beard while he thought. “I’ll also need to test how shielding reacts to the environment around the broom, specifically as regards heat. See if your Elliott can confirm up to what temperatures the broom can withstand.”
Sometime later, as he drained the broad beans that had been boiling away and methodically mashed them smooth with some garlic and spices, he allowed his imagination to drift through the possibilities of what could have been on Potter’s mind to cause him to behave so strangely. A few of those possibilities made him laugh out loud, while others brought a pensive smile.
And this was exactly the reason that Draco hadn’t wanted to get involved in the mess that was his mother’s manipulations. Just seeing what Potter had managed to tangle himself up in over the course of a few hours made him want to return to his cabin. He sighed, raking a hand through hair and looping it into a knot.
“Draco,” Potter whispered and Draco’s pulse was racing in a confusing mix of panic from Hermione’s interruption, and the heady need of his arousal. Without thinking his free hand rose to trace Potter’s cheekbone, and he bit his lip as the man’s eyes fluttered shut. Then he dropped his hand when his brain caught up with the words that had been contained in the message.
Potter gave him an odd look. “I promise you, they were. Look—” He pointed toward a collection of huts some twenty yards farther down the pier, one of which had a large red painted rendition of one of those horrible carapaced insect things on the side of it. “We can grab something to eat up there and ask the locals all about lobsters.”
“This isn’t going to work,” came the voice from behind him and that old irritation finally ignited, spitting inside his chest.
When the light outside was quickly fading he finally allowed himself to sink into his chair, leaning back until it reclined, waiting for its comfortable familiarity to soothe his aching shoulders.
“Thank you, Draco,” she said mildly, as if he had made a bland comment about the weather. “Have you apologised to Harry?”
During the weekend he dug out his book on plumbing that he’d bought the previous year and set to work rearranging the pipes, preparing the hookups for when the bath would be installed, transferring the existing facilities from the little nook with the curtain into the new space. Plumbing was one of the few things in the cabin that he helped along with magic, though he did use actual physical pipes, connected to an actual nonmagical water source. He just didn’t want to deal with the mess of a pipe bursting, or things not draining away properly.
Maybe he could try to live, and not just work at picking up the pieces back home, always putting in three times the effort for half the respect.
“Vince, I have no idea what has happened to my life.” When there was no response, he looked over at the empty perch and remembered that he’d let the owl out. “Right, and now I’m talking to myself. Fucking perfect.”
“Like I said. Enjoy the sights.” Then rather than draw attention to the fact that Draco was obviously staring, he dragged him along the pier, occasionally pointing at the odd building, wandering into a few and acting oblivious to the fact that he had no reason nor right to be poking around in random warehouses.
“Good evening. Lovely weather we’re having. So good of you to visit,” he said flatly, needing to raise his voice slightly over the sleet.
Draco did stand there and watch for a few minutes, his eyes following the man’s movements as he stretched up to the highest branches, the back of his jumper riding up to reveal a strip of bare skin, before bending down to place an ornament in its box, the fabric of his trousers pulling tight across his arse as he did so.
And then all too soon Hermione was gone and it was just Draco and Potter in the clearing, and he felt like he was spinning out of control.
After a small helping of pudding, when he was feeling warm, and full, and quite content, Potter pulled out a bottle of amber liquid and held it up with an inquiring gaze.
She smiled. It was a friendly smile, though slightly nervous, but certainly not false. “Draco! And please, call me Hermione.” Her jaw hardened a little but she retained smile.
There was another long pause, and Draco could imagine the facial contortions that were taking place behind him. But he felt some satisfaction when there was a rustling of papers and Potter started speaking about the broom enchantments.
The next thing he knew he was being wrapped up in the man’s warm embrace, a tangle of sweaty limbs sprawled across the length of the sofa, the heady smell of sex surrounding them.
He immediately shook his head. “I don’t have anywhere to be other than classes, and those are done after the 18th.”
The man shot to his feet immediately, then did a double take upon seeing him, mumbling something that sounded like, “Fucking hell.”
The orders hadn’t come in by the time Thursday arrived. Draco was just looking over the list that was pinned to his wall when he heard a crack outside, followed by a few quick raps against the door.
Amusement played around Draco’s mouth. “I thought that might hurt your delicate sensibilities. But, as it was your idea,” he said, unsheathing his knife.
“Not today,” he replied, looking down at his hands. “I let Vince out, and I’ll need to let him back in since he’s a princess when it comes to winter.”
“Kreacher popped out to retrieve some things from the cabin,” Draco explained. “I hope that’s not a problem?”
“Outside,” Potter said, nonplussed. Draco shrugged and rose to tidy up. “You’ve been sleeping outside.”
Draco swiped his wet hair back out of his face.“If you wait too long you’ll need to fight the woodpecker for it. And she frightens you,” he helpfully pointed out, with a smile.
And then it was Thursday, and Potter arrived early again to share a hot breakfast with him before Hermione arrived.
Draco and Hermione quickly got to work, marking out their circle in the snow and proceeding to test the temperature thresholds. They found the lower limit to be sufficient for the coldest locations on Earth but not enough to comfortably withstand a temperature drop near the planet’s atmosphere, should he remain there long enough for the residual heat within the bubble to slowly dissipate, and that didn’t factor in the colder temperatures in deeper space. Hermione then took out her notebook and proceeded to work on some incredibly complex calculations, before beginning to adjust the charms on the broom.
They’d arrived at the clearing, and Potter simply looked at him for several long seconds before retrieving the broom with the ribbon and handing it over.
“You two seem to work well together,” he said once they were walking between the trees, his feet occasionally kicking up clumps of snow ahead of him.
The horrible bird swooped in through his bedroom window and dropped its letter on his chest before careening over to Vince’s perch; fortunately it wasn’t occupied as he hadn’t yet returned from his latest hunt. Once landed the eagle owl stared at him unblinking.
“Agreed.” After waiting for Hermione to fiddle with the buttons a bit more and lead them out of the room, they returned to her office and Draco donned his coat.
Draco opened the bottle and sniffed at it, then poured two glasses of thick ruby liquid. Port, possibly. He took a cautious sip and nearly sighed at the warmth that filled him.
He took a sip, then leaned back in his chair. “So far I’ve layered Atmospheric Charms for warmth, the Bubble-Head Charm, and Sticking Charms that can be toggled. I haven’t done any strenuous testing yet, though I was planning on going to the coast to test the Bubble-Head at some point. Other items on my list are adapting the steering and braking for flight in a vacuum, and protection against the radiation that will be present in space. And protection from the heat of the atmosphere.”
His partner dragged him into what definitely appeared to be a shady warehouse on the way back, though the people there happily enough sold them a bottle of something alcoholic as long as they also purchased a case of horrendously overpriced water. And so, with the moon high overhead and the seaside town becoming quieter with each step, they made their way back to the yacht.
Draco blinked a few times, absently thinking that his face felt rather tingly. “Extension Charms and Atmospheric Charms don’t mix,” he said, bemused.
The snow was still falling heavily when Hermione pounded on the door on Sunday morning, looking like she’d Apparated directly into snow that came up to mid-calf on his front step.
Draco considered. What Potter was mentioning was. . . .  Well, it was certainly a level of commitment that he hadn’t been expecting. Running away together? When this was still so new between them?
“Sure, we can start after I’ve finished this cup,” Draco said, lifting his mug a little. “The water’s still hot if you want one.”
The other man slowly rose to his feet as well and then took a few steps back, widening the space between them. “No, I can keep it out. I’ll store it at mine, then, so that it doesn’t get carried off by anyone around the office.”
Potter looked at the towel with what may have been confusion before he slowly hung it up on the spare hook by the door and instead used a spell to dry himself.
Draco swallowed. “Right. Listen, Gr—Hermione, I really do appreciate your generosity in helping me with this, especially considering what I’ve done to you over the years, and your suffering that I’m responsible for. I know that an apology doesn’t undo that, but . . . I
Then Hermione reached into her bag and produced a trunk that she had apparently taken the liberty to
Potter gave him a slow nod, then said, “All right. You said that’s in Bristol, yeah? I’ll head there later today then.”
Draco stood there feeling horribly trapped for about a minute before he could do anything more than blink. Releasing a shuddering breath he slumped backward against his small kitchen work space, clutching the edge of the counter behind him.
“Almost 1200. Certainly an improvement, but not enough. Harry, did you want to apply those same ones to that broom? Are there any other modifications on that one?”
He felt Potter mumble something unintelligible against his neck and a moment later their bare torsos were pressed against each other, an intense heat crackling between them. And as Draco threw his head back when Potter found and sucked mercilessly at a particularly sensitive area he used his fingers and palms to explore the canvas of the man’s body, stroking along the edges of his pelvis, brushing through the sparse hairs on his chest, discovering the way his breath caught when he just barely grazed a hard nipple.
Soon they set off toward the clearing with a collection of brooms and a trunk, and spent several long hours finessing enchantments. Once the three brooms that had been modified with the enhanced heat protections were all set they moved along to the headache of the Extension Charms, and attempted a few of the things that Draco and Hermione had discussed the previous month.
A faint flush rose on Potter’s cheeks and his hand was in his messy hair. “I did,” he agreed, his eyes wide. “I didn’t expect you to come.”
Draco exchanged a look with Vince, who had been so put out by the loud outbursts that he’d retreated into the cabin and was perched on the edge of the wash basin.
“Did you want me to remove any particular tamper-proofing enchantments ahead of my next visit, or is there more that you wanted to do with the Bubble-Head first?” Potter’s voice didn’t reveal any particular emotion, though he was once again chewing on his lip, his brow furrowed.
He couldn’t think of a way to respond to that so they sat in silence for several minutes, listening to the crackling of the fire, until the kettle started to whistle. A few minutes later he was sitting back down and they both held steaming mugs.
“Potter, upstairs. Now,” he ordered, knowing that regardless of what his sober mind decided for him the next day, he’d at least have tonight with the man.
On Saturday she arrived a good hour early for lunch and popped her head into Draco’s room long enough to order him up to the attic before marching up there herself.
A stray part of him was cognisant of the additional intimacy present, given their surroundings and his heightened emotions. And that seemed to stoke his arousal higher rather than frightening him, as he stretched out on top of Potter and licked and sucked at his neck, then proceeded to taste his way down the man’s torso. He spent an eternity teasing those sensitive nipples, feeling his cock twitch with each of the man’s moans and gasps, each sound punctuating a flick of his tongue or a graze of his teeth.
Draco clenched his jaw for a few seconds then let out a heavy exhale, unable to even maintain the pretense of cutting disdain after so long without practice. “I can’t,” he said simply, breaking eye contact and looking up at the ceiling.
They sat there in a companionable silence for some time, until Draco’s glass was empty. He was just preparing to stand so that he could turn in for the night when Potter reached out and put a hand on his knee, stopping him.
The next few minutes were spent in silence. When his soup was hot he poured it into a large mug and dropped the saucepan and spoon into his wash basin, giving the water pump a few presses. Then he turned, glanced longingly at his empty chair, and settled for leaning against the wall.
Draco shook his hair out of his face and leaned over to gather up an armful of the split wood and proceeded to carry the pieces back to his woodpile, neatly stacking them. When he was done he walked over to his front step, taking a moment to rinse the mud from his feet under the water that was running off the roof before grabbing a towel from inside, first wiping down the axe, then beginning to dry himself off.
The tone was what made Draco pause and actually consider the question. They hadn’t been working together long as Aurors before they’d gotten the assignment, but even then they’d managed to act . . . well, not professionally, but certainly more maturely than he might have thought possible then. There was plenty of snark and attitude, from both sides, but nothing malicious. Nothing spiteful.
Draco spun around, seeing a disgruntled sort of expression on the owl’s face. “What the fuck was that?” he blustered, waving his arms around before remembering that he was still holding his mug, scowling as tea sloshed out and sprayed across the wall.
“They do,” Potter agreed just as quietly, reaching across the few inches that separated them and letting his hand rest next to Draco’s, their fingers just barely touching.
Within the following week Fry had talked about spaceflight three more times, during lectures about the Tube, David Bowie, and the EFTA, as though any of those things were remotely related. But it was fascinating to hear of the moon landing. And then, to learn that there were people living in the ISS every day, orbiting the planet?
“Yeah. You’d almost think that,” Potter agreed, though his tone lacked the levity Draco had been aiming for, and instead made him feel more anxious.
Potter grimaced. “We put a lot of work into it. It still tends to not really let the sunlight in through the windows unless I’m hungover, and doxies keep finding their way to the curtains, but other than that it’s definitely not the museum of horrors that it used to be.”
He was just sitting down when the woman stalked back into the kitchen with Potter in tow, the man somehow appearing more disheveled than he’d been the day before, with half of his hair standing straight in the air and the other half sticking straight out to the side, though he’d changed into a v-neck and some joggers.
The hand that wasn’t in his found the part of his leg just above his knee, not sliding higher, but the possibility of it stoked the fire that was building in Draco, one which had been collecting its kindling for months—for years, if he was honest—but which had never even considered igniting until now. He let out an involuntary groan, parting his lips and Potter didn’t hesitate to deepen the kiss, the taste and smell of ouzo filling his senses as a hot tongue slid against his own, awakening every nerve in his body. Then it retreated, only to suck his bottom lip into that warm mouth and bite on it with a sting of his teeth.
Draco’s eyebrows had been climbing steadily higher, but Hermione voiced his thoughts perfectly when she demanded, “And no one at Hogwarts noticed!?”
“Well, it looks like you do remember those discussions after all. Draco, I want to talk to you alone. Harry?” The man’s expression was shuttered, of what was visible while he continued to look down toward the table. He made no move to get up so Hermione made a sound in the back of her throat and strode toward the stairs. Draco rose to his feet and followed her to the front hall.
Draco rose and grabbed two glasses in lieu of answering, and soon settled back into his chair. He swirled the liquid around in his glass, watching as the light of the fire was transformed into ripples of golden light under the surface. He allowed his thoughts to drift, simply enjoying the surprising turn of the evening.
Draco felt like he was choking, the words startled him so much. Swallowing hard he looked over at his mother in alarm. “Pardon?”
Given the gently snoring Potter in the chair next to the bed, he figured he had a good idea of the how.
Of course she was already several steps ahead of him and produced a list of her own, which he pinned to the wall above his bookcase. The next several hours vanished amid a discussion of all manner of scientific detail, past space missions, and muggle space engineering. It wasn’t until the light outside was beginning to dim and Vince started making noises about going out for a fly that he realised how long they’d been at it.
“The Hogwarts Express will bring him to London next Saturday. So—you don’t need to stay all the way to Easter if you don’t want to. Just . . . another two weeks. Not quite two weeks.”
Draco cast his mind back to the previous evening, spent enjoying that massage in the kitchen. He’d been content, he remembered. That was a nice thought. He was quite content now, in fact, and he felt a smile form as his thoughts drifted.
“Draco. . . .” He felt Potter lift his chin then drop his forehead to Draco’s shoulder, his breaths unsteady, fingers digging into the cloth of his shirt.
“I’m surprised you didn’t just hack bits off with your knife to make it identifiable,” Potter replied sarcastically.
Draco rose to his feet and slipped on his boots while Potter guzzled what must have been the rest of Hermione’s coffee. “Oh?” he asked casually. “Pray tell.”
Draco let out a slow breath, clenching his eyes shut. Despite the small size of the lawn he knew that he was shielded from notice from any muggles who might happen by, but that didn’t prevent him from feeling exposed, standing in a city he wasn’t terribly familiar with, out in the open with all of his emotions. And he hadn’t even had to say more than three words to his mother yet, nor had he approached his father’s grave.
“Yeah, I know,” he muttered to Vince before rubbing a hand over his face. Then he looked up toward Granger and asked, “Do you mind if we make up a list of all of the concerns that you think we should consider?”
The sounds in his ear changed to little huffs of laughter, and that was ultimately what grounded him. Taking a steadying breath he let go of Potter and took a shaky step back, noticing that at some point a Cleaning Charm had been cast. As he bent down to collect his clothing he asked, “What exactly is so amusing?”
Potter nodded and seemed to be deliberating over something, then wandered over to sit on a large rock. Draco proceeded to ignore him, getting on with his work.
Draco narrowed his eyes and reached into the bag, hesitating before selecting a single curl of paper-thin, salt-dusted plantain. He put it on his tongue, his mouth immediately puckering at the salt and sour—
“No, you go ahead. I don’t have an overly large collection of texts and I haven’t had much occasion to do any brewing, so my recollection of recipes is not the best.”
After lunch Draco spent some time stretching, mostly focusing on his arms, then retreated to the drawing room to continue his potions research.
On Monday Fry declared that the week would be spent reviewing all that they’d covered in the previous year, and Draco imagined he wasn’t the only one hoping their teacher would get laryngitis and cancel their classes.
“Excellent,” said Draco. Glancing up he noted that the sky overhead was getting quite dark so he stood, tucking away his wand before turning to make his way back to the cabin. He was peripherally aware of Potter shadowing him, while Vince silently flew on ahead. When he arrived at his front step he turned at the sound of a throat being cleared.
That afternoon when he slowly walked back to his cabin he scooped up the fallen hornbeam seed clusters along the way. He was just picking a few seeds out of their husks when he stepped around to the front of the cabin to find Potter sitting on his front step.
Draco allowed his head to thunk back against the wall and let out a long breath. “No. She acts as though nothing has changed, as though the War never happened, as though my father dying in Azkaban was some tragedy, or noble sacrifice. I can’t talk to her.”
It was on the tip of his tongue to refuse to answer but hearing the pain in his voice, and reflecting on what the past two weeks must have been like for him, Draco decided he deserved at least this much.
of a clue what was happening. I—I yelled a lot more, at that point. Didn’t do any good though,” Potter added with a hollow laugh.
A doleful hoot sounded from a branch above, arresting his motion mid-swing. He let the axe drop to the forest floor, looking over at his stack of firewood and wiping his brow. “Thanks, Vince. Sorry, I’ve had a day.”
There was an odd sound on the other side of the cabin and he glanced over his shoulder to see Potter giving Vince some owl treats. He didn’t own any treats, so the man must have brought them. Draco swallowed hard and looked back out the window, not wanting to think about that.
He followed as Potter led them over, the smells of shellfish and butter filling his nostrils as they drew close. Then the man ordered them each a lobster roll and a can of something effervescent, which they cracked open and sipped at while the woman inside bopped around to some music and assembled their food.
Then his eyes widened in alarm as a burning heat filled his mouth, only to be momentarily blinded by a flash as Potter, the bane of his existence, snapped a photograph of his pain and suffering while he laughed merrily.
Draco ended up joining her, not wanting to be left alone in an area of the Ministry that he wasn’t entirely sure he was supposed to be in, despite her assurances, and they retrieved Potter just past the spinning room. The man looked at him with suspicion until Hermione whispered something in his ear, then his eyes widened with what could have been recognition and he gave Draco a small smile.
There was a loud gulp then Potter leaned forward to refill his glass, and out of the corner of his eye Draco could see that his hands were shaking.
“Did you want me to pass along a message for you, then?” The question was posed in an even more hesitant manner than the previous one.
“I’ll see you tomorrow,” Potter said quietly, then stepped in close for a warm kiss before stepping back again, hesitating a moment before dropping his hands.
There was a single hoot and a clicking of talons in response, and Draco ignored him in favour of focusing on his stretches. Then, feeling much more limber he rolled up the towel and strolled back to the cabin.
Once they’d arrived back at the cabin Potter followed him inside so Draco threw together some sandwiches for both of them and put the kettle on.
Draco took the opportunity to lean further into the man, bracing his hands on Potter’s thighs as he dipped his head to catch one of those dusky nipples with his lips, at first gently running his tongue over it, tasting the salty skin, then taking it into his mouth to suck and nibble at it, feeling Potter’s entire body quivering in tension.
Draco swallowed at the tension he could hear in Potter’s voice at that statement, despite the easy way he spoke the words.
Draco was comparing those points against his list and nodded when they all seemed accounted for. “That sounds good. Potter, do you still have that first broom in your bag? We can use that one for the initial test.”
Vince swivelled his head to look outside, before turning back and shifting, his talons clicking lightly against the wood of his perch.
His mother stood there for some twenty minutes, and Draco could make out the sight of her lips moving, though whatever words she spoke were quiet enough that he couldn’t hear any of them. Then she gave a small smile and crouched to lay her flowers on the snow-covered patch of earth next to the marker, and left to return to Draco’s side.
“I want a broom that I’m familiar with. I can sacrifice a bit of speed, and whatever other bells and whistles have been added, for the sake of a broom that I know.”
They continued to walk in silence and had nearly arrived at the clearing when Potter asked quietly, “Is that why you don’t wear shoes? So that you can . . . feel the woods?”
“I’ll need you to put some sort of identifying mark on this specific broom,” he finally said, “and bring it out the next time we get to work. I need to see if the warmth remains, or if it needs to be reapplied.”
Draco rolled his eyes and left the clearing, instead choosing to walk the woods and collect any fallen seed clusters. The majority went into a pocket, but a few he kept in hand and unfurled their papery husks while he made his way back to the clearing. He emerged from the tree line with a palmful of seeds a quarter of an hour later.
“Department of Mysteries,” announced the lift’s female voice when they stopped at the next floor. The doors opened and Hermione stepped out, looking at him expectantly.
Draco awoke at dawn, more out of habit than anything, and slowly sat up. He probably had a bit under an hour until Hermione arrived, and he had seen a bathroom a few doors down the hallway. The moment he stood from the bed there was a quiet pop near the door.
Potter didn’t lose his concerned expression in the entire time it took to return to the cabin, and once there he seemed to take a keen interest in the interior, letting his gaze roam as if he hadn’t seen it several times before.
“Well, I’m sorry that I needed to put you through that. But I can assure you that you’re not being monitored any more closely here than you are regularly at home, and that you’re certainly much safer from interference here than you are there. Now, I’ll need to go collect Harry. Did you want to come along, or wait here? Oh, you can leave your coat here if you wish, and as long as you keep that badge on you won’t be hassled.”
“It was an honest mistake,” Draco replied lowly, hating the fact that he’d been so foolish but needing her to know that it hadn’t been intentional, though he couldn’t see why anyone would intentionally do such a thing.
“I was able to get the information you wanted from one of the designers who was around back when the 2001 came out. So we can go over—would you look at me?” The last words came out in an exasperated huff.
“Right,” he repeated, then he glanced past Draco and flinched at whatever he saw in Vince’s expression, but Draco didn’t turn back to look. “All right, well I should get going, then. I’ve got to talk to some of the other parents still about Teddy’s tricks. Er, I’ll be off then. Later, Malfoy.” And hardly two seconds later then man was gone.
“You said you’re going to put in a door? How will you do that? It’ll have to be magic, right, since you didn’t leave any openings when you built the rest of the place.”
The first thing Draco did when he entered his home was get a fire started in his wood stove, then clear out the perished food that was in his small cupboard.
With that she reached up to the shelf above her and grabbed a few paper napkins, then did something out of sight and shortly handed them each a long roll absolutely overflowing with lobster meat.
Once he’d caught his breath he reached over and flicked the lock. He knew it wouldn’t keep Potter out, but he hoped that he’d respect the request for privacy.
Then he slid his hands under the man’s thighs and lifted them, spreading them wider and licking lower, before swiping his tongue firmly over the circle of puckered skin hidden there.
Numerous owls arrived over the course of Friday and Saturday, each looking more weary and bedraggled than the last as a snow storm rolled in. By Saturday night the wind was a roaring whistle outside, there was hardly five feet of visibility outside the window, and much of the limited space inside the cabin had been given over to trunks and tents.
A few spells later and the trunk promptly clattered apart into a pile of wooden slats so they decided to call it a day.
“They had no idea what was wrong with you. And even though you had a pulse, you weren’t breathing, and then your skin started to go all patchy, and they had even
“Yes, the last of them headed out a few minutes ago. Harry mentioned that he’s got a plate for you in the kitchen if you’re hungry,” she said absently as her eyes scanned over the list, then she looked up at him. “This looks fine. I should be able to swing by with everything tomorrow.”
There were shouts, and desperate cries, and he continued his movements, until it was only the weight of his arms holding those hips against the bed that prevented them from thrusting into the air, and he was swallowing the thick ropes of come, lapping it all up, kissing along the entire expanse of skin up to Potter’s gasping mouth.
Their mouths met in a clashing of teeth and tongues, and Draco could faintly hear the clink of one of the mugs being kicked across the room as he pushed Potter backward, their feet knocking together. He felt the other man’s groan in his bones when they impacted against the far wall and Draco pushed closer still, his thigh pressing firmly between two legs, the bulge of a hardening erection digging into his hip.
“I’ll grant you that after a month of making use of a decent bed I am considering purchasing one for myself. I just haven’t had the opportunity yet,” he admitted, mentally reasoning with himself that the words were mostly truthful. Sort of.
He was just marking out where to set the hole that he’d insert the stand into when he heard the crack of Apparition, followed immediately by the clicking of Vince’s talons a few feet to his left.
Draco could feel his shoulders tensing again, at least until the hand was joined by a second, pressing more firmly, thumbs working the sore points in his joints.
help, even if it’s just to offer an additional set of eyes, or a different perspective. Harry doesn’t want you to get hurt.”
“Besides, I think the project is fascinating. I looked into it of course and did you know, there’s been no recorded research into magical spaceflight in Britain? It’s silly, especially since muggles have been going to space for longer than the Internet has been around.”
He followed the man out onto the bow, sitting on his towel where he’d left it to dry in the heat of the day’s sun while they’d been sailing. He cracked the bottle and gave it a cautious sniff, his nose wrinkling slightly at the herbal aromas and the burn of alcohol.
“I thought you died in Azkaban,” he murmured in wonder, resting his head back and closing his eyes as he continued to stroke himself, pulling harder and faster, it having been so long since he’d been able to do more than entertain the mere idea of a wank. Flickering thoughts of dark hair filled his mind’s eye, too fleeting to hold onto, as frantic as he was, and soon he was groaning and coming all over his stomach.
Draco smoothed the indent as best as he could with the sharp edge of his blade, then sheathed it and added a few layers of charmwork. After a brief hesitation he sat on the broom, then pressed his thumb into the indent.
Draco took a sip even though it was still far too hot. Eyes watering slightly as his tongue burned, he reminded himself that he was doing this for himself. Even if a part of him wanted to answer the questions, and talk to someone other than Vince about what this meant for him. Because as much as he loved the bird, Vince didn’t really understand.
Draco nodded, not turning around. “Thank you, Potter,” he said quietly, his voice sounding unsteady to his own ears.
Potter gripped the edge of the wash basin and leaned against it. “Good. Will you consider getting someone to help you with this then? Someone who might know more about this than you do, and who could help you not get yourself killed?”
Once they’d arrived at the cabin Draco selected a piece of wood from his woodpile and applied the same charms to it, then tossed it back and forth between his hands while he decided where to put it. He ended up setting it vertically next to his front step, partially buried so that it wouldn’t be carried off by particularly strong winds.
It was generous of her, he decided, to allow them to pretend that they were new acquaintances without a horrible shared history. And though Potter had assured him that his friends would be reasonable, he kept waiting for the other shoe to drop as they each politely greeted him and shook his hand. Susan—because of course Hermione insisted on first names for everyone—even had a small smile for him, which he found quite surprising given that she as an Auror should certainly be one of the most suspicious out of those present.
His beard wasn’t as wild, though it was certainly longer than he’d realised, with it bunching up into a dense thickness in the spots where he habitually scratched at it, and hanging more scraggly and wispy in the areas where he didn’t. It was thick enough that his thin mouth was completely hidden when closed, and even his long, pointed nose appeared small.
He sat there blinking the bright spots out of his eyes. Just as he was able to make out Potter’s face in the darkness the other man burst into laughter.
Draco had a few more bites before he asked, “I’m guessing she doesn’t know you’re sharing it with me?”
Draco finished dealing with the last tangle and leaned against the wall of the narrow hallway, tucking the comb into a trouser pocket. “She didn’t know I was in there. She doesn’t know about spaceflight yet.”
Draco felt entirely bewildered by the events of the past ten minutes but he carefully sat up the rest of the way and swung his legs off the side of the bed. “Do you mind giving me a few minutes to get dressed?”
Potter, and he knew that the man was on the edge of doing something immensely stupid because that’s what he did when he panicked.
“From this side of the island we’re blocked from view, so the muggles in Wembury won’t see us. There are apparently plenty of wrecks in these waters from the past few centuries so I figure that will be something interesting to explore while I’m testing things out.” He flicked his gaze upward, then added, “I’ll keep a
It was probably about ten minutes later that he heard footsteps approaching and the door opening once more.
“Whoa.” Potter’s eyes widened and darted around, clearly taking in the effect, then dropped the broom on the ground. The faintly visible outline of the bubble vanished immediately.
Draco took some rough visual measurements of the trees and slowly walked around his cabin, looking at the walls, and thinking.
Finding his mind wandering to the strange things that had certainly already happened with the man upstairs Draco made his way down to the kitchen to find the promised plate on the table waiting for him. He was just bringing it over to the sink to wash up when he heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs and tensed.
Draco nodded and withdrew his wand, planning on casting the several protective spells that they’d previously discussed at length. Then he hesitated. “Actually, it’s probably better if I’m not the one to cast these, at least not here. I’d rather not be under suspicion because I’ve cast multiple advanced defensive spells within the Ministry, even if those spells aren’t restricted for me and you’ve said that I’m permitted to be here.”
Draco tossed the broom over to him and kept his gaze on his face while he caught it, watching as a large bubble immediately formed around his head.
“I didn’t—” He heard a huff, then blessed silence until the kettle started to whistle. A few minutes after that the tea had steeped and he was holding his mug in front of his face, letting the scented steam seep into his skin.
Suddenly, Hermione’s cross voice filled the room and Draco started, though Potter tightened his grip on his hand when he instinctively pulled away.
Potter had a mulish expression and wasn’t letting go, but based on strength alone Draco knew he could wrestle the broom free. He had the calluses on his palms and the build of nine months of putting his body to work daily. Potter apparently worked behind a desk. Knowing that the idiot was too stubborn to let up he abruptly gave the broom a sharp jerk and stalked out to the centre of the clearing with it, prying about half of the bristles free of the fastening, then took off again.
Draco couldn’t help but snicker, while Potter rolled his eyes and bumped against his side. “I’d like to see you do better,” he said in a put-upon tone.
He prepared two mugs then lowered himself into his chair, gesturing for her to sit in Potter’s conjured seat. Once she’d done so he simply looked at her expectantly.
Potter entered, looking endearingly ridiculous with the enormous snowflakes clinging to his hair. It took him a moment to find Draco in his unusual seat, despite the cabin being tiny, and stared at him for a few seconds before shaking himself. “Hey, Malfoy. I hope you don’t mind me coming by earlier today. I just figured, since you’re not in classes. . . .” He trailed off, then gave a bit of a shrug. Then he looked over toward the chair, then back at Draco.
Draco blinked in surprise, then nodded. “Yes, that’s fine.” He shrunk it down to the size of his palm and brought it down to the front hall with him, tucking it into a coat pocket.
“I’ll need to apply some infusions to a few brooms tonight so that we can test them with Hermione tomorrow,” he managed, and he absolutely knew that his voice sounded wrecked.
Then his hand rose to rake nervously through his hair and Draco couldn’t help but allow a small smile to escape, a fond tendril of warmth curling through him.
He heard the heavy exhale from the man next to him but he couldn’t look away from the door. “Right then. I’ll see you there. I’m with you, remember.” Then there was a loud crack.
“If you’ve been raising him with stories of your exploits,” Draco said cautiously, hoping he wasn’t about to stick his foot in it, “I’m surprised he didn’t somehow find a dragon egg to satisfy his Gryffindor tendencies.”
He didn’t expect the puzzled look that Potter gave him. “But Ron doesn’t know.” Then he tilted his head, and added, “Well, he knows that you’re out of Azkaban, I’d imagine. But I didn’t really know how to bring up the broom thing, and it doesn’t really affect him at all, you know? You’re entitled to live your life, and whether you choose to do something absolutely barking with some brooms doesn’t really affect anyone other than you and Nimbus, and therefore me.”
When it had been seven days since Potter’s last visit he was awoken from his afternoon nap by the crack of Apparition from outside, which was followed by some irritated barks and growls from Vince. Sweeping his hair up into a knot he rose from his chair and swung open the door.
His hand came up to nervously mess up his hair and he looked away. “Er, right. I just mean, if you aren’t supposed to be using a wand anymore, then I don’t want to witness anything that I shouldn’t.”
“I’m noting that down as a yes, with Mr Potter listed as the responsible party. Well then, you are free to go.” And with that she swept out of the room.
Based on the clock on the mantle and the darkness outside the large windows, it was just past two o’clock in the morning.
The interior of the cabin smelled sweet when a loud crack announced his visitor. He stepped away from his stirring long enough to open the door then returned to his task.
“Oh, right. Underwater flight? I suppose that could work. I mean, you can cast it on yourself and fly on a broom just fine.”
There was a clicking of talons from the direction of Vince’s perch, and Draco felt a bubble of laughter rise from his chest and burst out of his mouth as he was overcome with unexpected relief.
“Yeah. Eddie’s two. Always laughing. He’s a sweetheart. They’ve been trying for a second.” And Draco knew without looking over that Potter was smiling.
A strange series of sounds and vibrations later, she declared that magically expanded space should provide the protection from pressure changes that they were after, and that any further tests should be done with a trunk in mind.
With that settled she left after giving Potter a brief hug. The man then gathered up the two brooms and they set off together in the direction of the cabin.
The next weekend he sent off a letter to Flourish and Blotts ordering several books on the subject of spaceflight, authorising a Gringotts transfer of at least triple their value for the hassle of the store clerks needing to get muggle books in. Well, it wasn’t like he had much to spend the gold on, since he’d all but told the goblins to amuse themselves with whatever investments struck their fancy and to leave him out of it.
“There isn’t anything for me here,” he whispered. “Or there wasn’t. Now, I have this faint thought that there might be, but you confuse me so much that I can’t possibly count on that tiny chance. Our whole community—it has nothing left for me, and I don’t want anything from it. I just want to live to see the next day, and if I can do that alone, then that’s probably the best thing I can hope for. I can be alone in space.”
Draco was abruptly pulled out of the unpleasant turn of his thoughts by the sight of Potter taking a seat in his chair. As if he had any right to.
“Yes, but there are dangers to you as well. It’s—oh, I brought something. Hold on.” She rummaged around in her bag and pulled out an enormous textbook, then flipped it open on a page that she’d marked with a purple sticky note.
He was trying to tug it away from Draco, and failing, as Draco’s grip tightened. He gave Potter a hard glare and said, “As I told you, I need to test it. I’ve purchased this broom. It belongs to me. I can do what I like to it.”
“Testing season started up again today. So I can’t come by in the mornings anymore, at least not for our usual Thursday, and—well, I wanted to see you.”
Potter hadn’t looked away but his gaze shifted to one of intensity. “Don’t you dare. Ron, let’s go look for Norbert.”
“Would you mind telling my friend here if that decoration on your back wall looks anything like a lobster?” Potter asked, raising his voice over the sound of the music and flashing a smile when the woman looked back toward them.
Potter let out a heavy breath. “All right. I’ll need to let Hermione know once we get there, since St Mungo’s will have probably already told her that you’ve been released, but I’ll try to hold her off for a day or two. Given that she hasn’t calmed down yet and it’s been over two weeks I’m not going to lie and say that you won’t get a verbal lashing.”
Draco gave her a nod and followed her down the stairs as she made her way to the ground floor. When they were just passing the first floor landing there was a loud crack of Apparition and Draco flinched.
Well, he imagined he might look a fright. He didn’t own a mirror, and frankly didn’t care what the others in his Muggle Appreciation classes thought of him, and it wasn’t as though he ever saw anyone else. But he hadn’t trimmed his beard since they’d updated his photo with the Ministry upon his release, and his hair was in a messy knot at the back of his head, and if today’s shirt was like most of his others it was probably covered in wood chips.
Then he rose to his feet. “That broom can go back in the bag for transport,” he said, pointing at the one with the red ribbon. “The other one should stay out, so that I can compare the two next time you’re here. Will that be a problem?”
“Make your own kid if you want one, Malfoy, this one’s coming home with us,” Weasley said loudly as he reached down and scooped Eddie up, swinging him up in the air and surprising peals of giddy laughter from the child.
Those were the thoughts that occupied his mind during the entirety of their meal. Draco was absolutely not preoccupied with the heat of the other man's legs that were pressed up against his under the tiny table. Nor did he even notice the way that Potter was making a mess of his food and kept pausing to lick his fingers clean.
Frowning, Draco pulled out his knife again and just as he was about to pry at the fastening that held the bristles to the shaft to loosen them Potter marched over and snatched at the handle.
He nodded firmly, then turned back to the child and said, “I’m pleased to meet you, Norbert. My name is Draco. I was also named after a dragon.”
Draco blinked at that, then lifted his head to meet the man’s gaze. “I don’t know why she’d think that.”
Though those thoughts were promptly stalled when Draco caught sight of a stack of strange cages in one of the warehouses. Forgetting himself, he reached out and clutched Potter’s arm, nodding toward the
His eyes widened slightly at that. “How did you manage to keep that from them? I would have guessed that if Weasley knew, they all would. I thought they were a close family,” he hastened to clarify, not wanting to start a row over a perceived slight. Especially since Potter had more or less managed to contain his emotional outbursts recently.
“Well, you got your photo of this moment, then,” he said. “Now will you put that bloody thing away so that we can
Draco slid his gaze over, but didn’t see anything other than interest in Potter’s expression. Well, interest and nervousness, perhaps. And that nervousness seemed to intensify the longer he didn’t answer. The part of him that used to thrive on needling Potter was waking up, enjoying this strange tension, so he remained silent.
Then Draco finished dealing with Potter’s overabundance of clothing and released his erection, dropping to his knees without warning and pressing his face against the hot flesh, inhaling a deep breath of the man’s musky scent.
He shook his head. “That’s fine. If you need anything else from there, probably best that he goes to get them. Don’t—please, just don’t disappear. If you absolutely need to leave, tell me first.”
He was explaining the difference in sap-collection from various types of trees to Hermione’s . . . friend? Partner? Person? A somewhat familiar-looking androgynous individual with the gender-ambiguous name of ‘Azzy’ and alarmingly green hair, in any case, when Potter re-entered with several platters of food hovering behind him.
“Er, yeah. Probably,” he replied, his hand rising to run through his hair, a familiar nervous gesture. “Testing season has wrapped up and it’s senior designers only working on the next model right now, so until it’s time for Christmas sales I can be spared. Well, it could also be McLaggen, I think he returns from his sales trip next week.”
Draco glanced up at his face, noting that Potter was avoiding meeting his gaze. “Well now I insist on hearing it.”
By then they’d carried on between two buildings and a breeze picked up, one which carried away the somewhat stale smell of the alley and brought instead freshness. Salt. Childhood memories of summer days spent at a small beach in Cornwall.
“Thank you, that’s all I needed,” he said, then opened it up to reveal his own clothing and towels from home.
It was probably for the best that he was so immersed in his task. He knew he was talking to himself, enough that Vince had demanded to be let out for a hunt rather than put up with him, but he could honestly say that he didn’t know which of the two subjects he was ranting about.
Eventually Potter rose and set his empty mug in the sink. With his back still turned he said, “I’m just so tired of people dying.”
Potter met his gaze, mumbled some assortment of sounds in greeting, then sank into a chair and pulled his steaming mug toward him, staring into its depths.
Potter huffed and followed him inside, removing a platter filled with eggs, bacon, and fried tomatoes, along with a few steaming rolls from his bag and setting them on the work surface.
The words shot straight to his groin and Draco swallowed, feeling the heat of his own flush rising on his neck. “I can think of a few ways,” he said slowly, the words coming out lower and huskier than he’d intended.
Then he sank heavily into his chair, wrapping his quilt around him, with nothing to distract him from his spinning thoughts.
And his emotions hurt so bloody much. He could feel them clawing at him, the turbulent fear of leaving behind the known for the unknown, the guilt over leaving behind Harry bloody Potter, after he dared to make Draco actually
?” Draco glared at the liquid that was running down the wall to form a puddle on the floor and grabbed a towel to clean it up.
Mess was certainly putting it lightly, as he looked around. The largest piece of wood was about the size of a sparrow, and the entire room was coated in wood fragments and dust. Two of the brass fastenings were lodged into the door of the wardrobe, one was embedded in the ceiling, and the rest were out of sight.
It was a feeble excuse, and he knew it, and surely Potter knew it, but the other man gave no indication and simply hummed in response. They continued to sit there quiet for another ten minutes or so before Draco finally found his resolve and stood, walking with Potter to the front hall.
“Just shy of 1800 degrees. I think that’s as far as we’ll get with charms, unless one of us invents a new one that’s more powerful than anything else currently in use.”
do you want to go to space so badly? I mean, I get that it would be an amazing accomplishment, and an incredible experience, but why the rush? Why the secrecy?”
The mulish expression was back. “We’re not just going to hand over the company’s intellectual property to anyone. But I’m part of the design team, so I can answer your questions.”
The following Monday after class he was marking out measurements on the logs that would become his corner posts when Potter arrived, and he let out a low whistle when he rounded the corner and saw the stone floor and neatly-arranged lumber.
Draco’s gaze skittered over to the broom and he stepped away, focusing on making his movements casual. “No, I haven’t figured that one out yet. More than anything I need a safe area to test ridiculously high heat. Not to mention access to a heat source.”
He took another minute to collect himself before opening his eyes and following Potter to the front gates of the estate where he’d grown up, his stomach still churning.
But then the man continued speaking before Draco could share those dangerous thoughts, and he was spared.
“Hmm. Not really, they were a few years under us I think. Mind you their older sister was in our year—Daphne?”
“I’ll need to return to your house,” he said as their feet crunched through the snow. “I need to do some brewing if I’m to have enough to apply to an entire trunk.”
Potter walked over and dragged another armchair next to Draco’s, then lowered himself into it. “You were really good with Eddie,” he said, and he still had
It didn’t take terribly long to anchor his Atmospheric Charms to the broom, though he spent a considerable amount of time finessing the range, and the duration. The success of the former was measured by ordering Potter to walk around the clearing, stopping at certain distances and describing what he felt; Draco remained professional outwardly but there was certainly something about bossing him around that was appealing. The success of the latter remained to be determined.
“The way Minerva tells it, he arranged for his friends in the other houses to help cover for him. And his house mates swear they thought he was in the Hospital Wing.”
“I’d almost think you unable to stay away,” Draco said lightly even as he felt constricted by the words.
Potter grimaced in sympathy. “That’s rough. At least it’s getting better, yeah?” Then his expression shifted and Draco braced himself.
After setting off in the direction of the clearing Potter cleared his throat and asked, “So, how did you learn that stuff anyway?” Draco raised a brow and he added, “Well, building a cabin, to start.”
Potter glanced over at him then just as quickly looked away, appearing to be staring intently at the fire. He cleared his throat, then said, “Er, yeah. I’ve got the notes on the, er, heat stuff. And the spells.”
“You know, when Hagrid first brought out the Blast-Ended Skrewts I thought they looked like shell-less lobsters.” Then he snorted. “They were horrible, weren’t they,” Potter added with a faint smile, the expression softening his features. His eyes seemed to shine in his remembrance and Draco swallowed, looking away as the full force of those words hit him.
Thinking over the events of the previous evening and morning he let out a shaky breath. He needed to shower, then find Potter to relay some sort of excuse, then make his escape. He could do that. Three simple steps.
“I’m around back,” he called, continuing to pry up the small rocks that were embedded in the partially-frozen soil.
After they looked at each other quietly for a few minutes, neither of them moving, Potter said slowly, “I noticed some bottles out in the cabin?”
There was the sound of the loveseat shifting slightly on the floor as Potter stood. Then there were a few footsteps, and a touch that ghosted through his hair, then the door opened and closed.
“I didn’t really notice the cold, at first. I didn’t feel it. But I knew that my body needed shelter, so I did what I had to do. I threw together the barest example of a shelter at first with a campfire so that I wouldn’t die of exposure, and then spent the winter building the cabin.”
He was still muttering to himself while he tidied up from lunch, then he leaned back against the kitchen work surface, attempting to think. Feeling that his face was still uncomfortably warm with his frustration he decided to head out for a long hike to cool off, organise his head, and think about nothing related to aggravating men.
Two days later, after a particularly miserable class involving role-playing the act of shopping in a muggle grocer’s, Draco returned home to find a red-faced Potter pacing outside, yelling for him.
“Well, not really,” Potter admitted. “At first I did. It gave me something to focus on after the War, you know? But once he was, oh, four I think? Yeah, once he was about four Andromeda gave me a right scolding and told me to stop spoiling him and wallowing in self-pity, and to live my own life a little. After that I tried a few jobs, hated most of them, and became a godfather who visited plenty rather than a live-in one.”
“I can leave this here with you since you should definitely read through it in more detail, but basically, humans are adapted to living on a planet with gravity, keeping our organs and fluids where they are in our bodies, but also pressure, which does something similar. In space there’s comparatively such little pressure that the dissolved gases inside your body can form into bubbles, which can kill you. There are other effects too like deoxygenation of the blood and tissue, lung collapse. . . . Those might be mitigated by the Bubble-Head Charm, it’s hard to say without tests of course, but the pressure is very important as well.”
He led the way to the clearing, enjoying the sensation of the crisp leaves and broken twigs crunching under his bare feet as he walked, focusing on the coolness of the light afternoon drizzle misting his face. Somewhere nearby there was a woodpecker, its rhythmic tapping only halting when a loud curse sounded behind him as Potter jogged to catch up.
“Oh, right.” Rather than a Floo call he conjured a Patronus, because of course he needed to be flashy about it, and murmured to it before the bright silver creature streaked out of the room.
“Granger—Hermione,” he corrected after she gave him a hard look, “I appreciate your coming by. Really, I am realising how much I’d missed in trying to do this alone. Would you mind if I continued to run some ideas by you as this project progresses?”
Their conversation carried on rather professionally from there, astoundingly, with Draco occasionally interjecting with questions, and Potter needing to flip through his notes to find specific details but otherwise replying without losing his head. After about thirty minutes the mixture had thickened enough so he took the saucepan off the heat and poured its contents into half a dozen jars, leaving them on his small work surface to cool while he tidied up.
Potter shook his head. “Oh, no. I’m talking about the hag.” He gestured up toward the heavy curtains that Draco had assumed concealed a window.
After the quiet pop of the house-elf appearing Potter shut the door, the sound of his heavy footsteps fading as he descended to the first floor.
“But you’re on the Ministry’s restricted list for purchases,” he interrupted, “and when you’re buying
They didn’t stop until several more hours later, when it was truly dark outside the attic window and Kreacher was hovering nervously, displaying the usual type of house-elf anxiety when a master wasn’t taking care of themselves properly. Draco rolled his shoulders, wincing as they popped, and followed Potter down to the kitchen, hearing himself sigh as the smells of a stew that had likely been bubbling away all day hit his nose.
