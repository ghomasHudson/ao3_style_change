Doom only settles when he is at his desk, staring at his mailbox. Just as he’s about to take a deep breath, calm himself and maybe drink the coffee that he made earlier, a voice says his name.
A sense of peace washed over him and he took a deep breath, exhaling through his mouth. He closed his eyes, listening to the gentle whispering of the trees and when he opened them he was lying on his back and staring into molten stars of two eyes glittering in the dying fire.
It’s a little bit more complicated than that.
”. He blinked a couple of times, startled, his heart beating fast and not only because of the stress. He went forward and followed the voice to the end of the corridor, where he turned left to stop a few meters before a man kneeling in front of a stone sarcophagus.
“But you’re looking for somebody to replace Padma temporarily?”
The last time somebody wished him a nice day was probably at his first job, years ago, when his dreams were still real and attainable, his family had some renome left and his father was proud of him.
The wall from which they had undoubtedly come out was as solid as he was; two metres high, built from  red bricks that were crumpled around the edges. It seemed not to belong to anything: a wall built in the middle of nowhere was an unusual sight. A wall built in the middle of nowhere in a fairy world was highly disturbing. But still: it was a wall. Going around it didn’t make Harry see anything else apart from even more plants and how the red bricks looked on the other side, but there was nothing extraordinary about it.
With a small sigh under his breath Draco sets out to work, one small step -- the step being an email in this example -- at a time.
. He felt as if a pit was dropped into his stomach and it sank and soured and sprung out roots that started to grow inside him, tipping him not only off balance but changing him into something he was not.
, objectify them to the point of them changing into a walking and talking mass of meat made specifically for his attraction? Was

He inhaled, sharply, his stomach growling, but the only thing he reached for was the golden goblet full of fresh water. As he drank he felt the water eased his anxieties; the knot in his stomach loosened and so did his hold of Draco’s hand for a second, but the other man grasped it tightly, as if he wanted Harry to remember that he too was still there. And how could he forget? He thought, licking his lips and watching Draco Malfoy from the rim of his cup, taking another few sips. In Hogwarts he was nearly obsessed with him and even though
“I would not stand there if I were you,” said the man, not even bothering to turn Harry’s way. “You’re standing on somebody’s grave, that is,” he added as if it was the most obvious thing in the world, said a spell quietly under his breath and made a complicated gesture with his wand, and then swore not so quietly.
, just dandy, nothing to see here folks, just a normal man trying to live his normal life not knowing what normality was and faking things all this time, a lie after a lie.
And Harry Potter — him, but not him, at the same time — stepped out, in a cozy thick jumper with two steaming cups in hands. Before he handed on to Malofy he leaned in and kissed him on the cheek, a wide smile on his face and Draco kissed his neck and they both walked in, arm in arm.
cologne lingering on his right sleeve that barely brushed Ha --
“What about the project we currently have?”
“Potter. That’s the third time this month you have been… unsatisfied with the work you were given. Are you telling me that the cases assigned to you are not up to your standards?”
“Sir,” said Harry, really trying not to sound like a spoiled child. “I just think that after three years of being an Auror you would stop treating me like a teenager. You do not need me in the papers,
, thinks Draco standing silently and opening the doors to the meeting room.
“Yeah,” Harry dug the heels of his hands into his eyes to wipe the excess of the sandiness that he still felt and had to blink rapidly for the world to come into full view. “You don’t happen to know where he went?”
Their hiding spot was a magically enhanced bushes, that Draco made grow and Harry obscured so that anybody who would walk to the garden could see just that; a bunch of plain bushes, thin branches that grew outwards in a manner that screamed for some cutting. But from the other side he and Malfoy, comfortably sitting on folding chairs (Malfoy just scowled at them when Harry took them out of his bigger on the inside pocket, but ultimately sat on them, hands crossed, as if their existence offended him. Harry smiled to himself, covering his mouth with his scarf, so that Malfoy wouldn’t just scoff at him, or worse, talk to him.) seeing everything that was happening in the garden with full clarity.
Harry wanted to stop him; grab him by the arm and shake him, scream at him that they were in this mess because
What he saw was his own reflection; his unruly, brown hair plastered to his forehead, the clearly visible bags under his eyes, the wearines in them. His brown skin also looked a tad bit paler than usual.
Harry didn’t miss that their ‘host’ didn’t confirm if the land was truly theirs and could only hope that Draco caught it, too. No, he didn’t just hope; he knew the other man caught it, he worked with him for the past weeks and knew how bloody intelligent he was. He was just afraid that all the other things would get in the way. So, he squeezed Draco’s hand hoping it would convey the massage he wanted to say: don’t be afraid, you’re not alone, I am here for you and with you.
“But don’t worry, Potter. There will be a job for you to do.”
He swallowed nervously. “Um…” he was about to say something, anything really, but thankfully it seemed that Draco woke up and was alert enough to grab Harry’s left hand, squeezed it — for courage? Or reminder that he wasn’t alone? — and started talking.
*frowning gif*
“Sane?” Harry shrugged. “Haven’t been in a long time. Serious? Deadly. So, does Friday, 8pm work for you?”
“Oh please, you don’t have to keep the Prophet photographer waiting on my behalf, you can take the pictures by yourself.”
“Rather good,” said Malfoy approaching him, careful as not to step on the flat stone he laid on the ground earlier, to create a path from one object to the other. The rune was dug the closest to the entrance of the mausoleum — it’s door opened wide, the black maw of nothing creeping the hell out of Harry — and the path Malfoy created would lead the being to the circle and trap it in it.
, the reality was far worse than that. “I’m trying to think.”
“He said to thank you.”
Just as Draco is putting his bag in his chair, still thinking about the man in the elevator he hears the characteristic grunt and closes his eyes for a split of a second, waiting.
“I was not!” Draco turned fully towards him, eyes wide in horror, mouth agape. “I was definitely not, Potter, take that back!”
Draco looked at him as if suddenly he grew a second head. “Do
. He wants to know Potter -- no, in this case it’s Harry -- better, maybe just a little bit. How he wants to know why Harry started talking to him in the first place, what made those dimples appear on his face, how the hell it seemed he still has a soul working in one of the most soulless departments on the corporation ladder. He wants to know
“Oooh, good combo, babe.”
(His family did, once, but it was either sold or lost in an unfortunate card game that was probably rigged. It now belongs to somebody else together with all the portraits of the generations of Malfoys that wouldn’t fit into the manor)
Draco!?
“Yes, Padma will be with us as long as the little one will allow her,” says Lockhart, still smiling.
and it thrills Draco as much as it scares him.
He stops only when Draco shakes his head and huffs a laugh.
Harry always thought that Malfoy would be the Master of Potions; he was good at it, he basically worshiped the ground Severus Snape was walking on and the course work… It wasn’t that it didn’t suit him either (Harry allowed himself a glance at Draco’s lean body, how his brows furrowed as he was looking at the runes, his mind clearly elsewhere).
Lamps are already lit by the time he makes the first steps onto the pavement and Draco sighs into his scarf, wondering when was the last time he saw the sun outside of work. Or when will be the next time he will see it. Sometimes he thinks about the long autumn and winter months as one period of time, where he feels and behaves like a zombie, living without a thought in his mind. He has nothing against a routine, in fact he likes it very much. But in those months from mid September to even late March everything seems to be a bit of a blur. He wakes up, takes a shower, makes himself breakfast and green tea, listens to a podcast or watches something on YouTube and then he’s off to work at seven-forty. After arriving at eight he will spend the next eight — but more like nine and a half — hours in the office, go back home, drink some tea and stare at the ceiling, his mind completely wiped out. It’s easy for the days to become one and the same, but he always knows the date: the job demands it. So he knows, with each passing hour, with each morning and late afternoon how much time has passed, how close Christmas and New Year is (one of the busiest times of the year for his team) and how much overtime he has. The monotony of such life would kill many people but Draco… if Draco is absolutely honest he knows the rhythm of it like the back of his hand, the face in the mirror that stares at him day after day. The familiarity of it doesn’t make him bored or unsatisfied with his life, it’s just the fact how quickly it passess and how much he puts into things that technically make him proud but ultimately lead to even more time he doesn’t spend on himself.
Oh yes, there's nothing better than having an executive meeting and an existential crisis in the same room.
He had to hide his surprise when Draco squeezed back; his long fingers wrapping around Harry’s hand, hand slightly trembling and Harry wanted nothing more in the world to just hug the other man and protect him best he could.
Penelope is young — everyone the company hires now is younger than Draco’s thirty-one — bright and still full of energy when she comes and finishes work. It’s her second week as a Junior Cash Management Specialist and while she still can’t do much and doesn't have the access to all banks, she does what she can.
Something squeezed Harry’s chest, a feeling that was dormant before inside his body and it took every ounce of restraint not to walk to Draco and outline his throat with his tongue.
Harry turned towards the other man, brows furrowed, a question forming in his lips, but it died when he saw the far away stare that Draco had, as he focused his gaze on the fire. Suddenly he looked older than his twenty-seven years; like a man who had been through hell and saw things that could not be unseen, but then weren’t they all like that?
And waited.
,” or, “
The nothingness seems to have consumed him. Everything should fit, like pieces of puzzles, into one image; however, after the war nothing went as it was supposed to be. Harry felt as if the race — the race of life — had begun long ago and nobody told him to start. Now, others were way ahead of him while he had only just begun to start to jog.
It started, as all stories do, innocently. More so, not only because of who called the case in but by who took it over. Because Harry Potter didn’t like to think that he was an Auror figurehead, nice for pictures but not so welcomed on the ground, but for the last couple of weeks, months even, he found himself assigned to cases that were high profile, not very challenging and boring as hell. And to make matters worse he couldn’t do anything to change it; by now even the Aurors around Robart’s office knew it because Harry has been more and more vocal about his dissatisfaction with the arrangement of cases that were assigned to him.
Draco grits his teeth and puts his phone screen up on the desk counting to ten backwards. Is it a good idea? Probably not. He loves his friends, he really doesn, but sometimes they are just a tad bit too much.
Draco looked at him, eyes wide. Then, after a couple of seconds he seemed to acknowledge tha yes, Harry Potter was indeed standing on the threshold of his bedroom, nervously biting his lower lip and rocking on the heels of his feet. Then it seemed that something dawned on him, some ancient knowledge as he closed his eyes and with a patient of a saint said, “So, my mother and your Granger?”
“Unorthodox for who? Me, because I’m a Malfoy or because I’m an ex-Death eater?”
A man who sneered at his close ones; who envied others and who were selfish beyond measure.
“Remember, the last time I saw you, you were a mumbling idiot who had more luck than brains.”
Or can he?
With anxiety in check and his breathing back Harry hummed under his breath. “I can give you any distraction you need.”
“Is that a proposition?”
Harry stopped, a few steps after he came down, and listened, wondering if he didn’t go crazy. He had to be, because what he was hearing was a voice that he thought he forgot, mumbling some words weaving here and there a “
Draco frowns at his screen and closes the message window.
“Finally!” Says Penelope, who send a message asking about the constant changing of languages and a couple of more things that just weren’t working with the Icelandic site
‘his name is Haaaarry’ I can SEE you twirling your hair around your finger!!!!!!!!!! you slutttttt
Blaise, I beg you, less capslock, please.
A knock to the bathroom door startled him and Harry nearly slipped on the wet shower’s floor as Hermionie screamed from the other side. “Harry Potter, I swear to god, you defeated Voldemort and you’re not going to chicken out now! I will beat that stupid ass of yours if you do!” And really, he thought with a smile on his face, turning the water off and taking a fresh towel, he did have the best friends. They kept him honest, gave his shit and he didn’t want to think about where he would be if it wasn’t for them. Probably dead in a ditch somewhere.
low and gutteral and also muffled by his hands with which he covered his face.
“Hello guests,” said the voice, like the rustling of branches on a winter night and Harry froze. “Welcome to my kingdom.”
“Two…” With free hands Harry touched his wand and the end of the magical line that was still tied to his jeans. He closed his eyes for a second and took a quick and deep breath…
Draco’s door was wide open; Harry swallowed nervously as the blond man was standing before his bed, his suitcase open and half filled with what looked to be some smart clothes and some fancy wizard gowns. He was wearing a black shirt with rolled up sleeves, his Dark Mark stark pale against his skin and Harry wished Draco was as comfortable in his presence as he was in his own house.
Draco opens his mouth, closes it, then opens it again. Harry --
“You… don’t have to drink it if you don’t like it.”
“So, you’re going to sleep and I have to keep a watch all night?”
Draco is amazed, honestly. Since he talked with Pansy and Blais the idea of quitting has been drilling a hole in his mind, slowly but steadily. And here comes Penelope, a fresh hire, not caring how her CV will look like for her future employee.
“Well,” he said, when he saw the two men; dirty, bloody but still alive, leaning away from each other with faces that clearly indicated that he had interrupted something important and vital. “At least you’re alive. I own Hermine ten pounds, she told me we would find you this week.” He added, lowering his wand and gesturing at the other aurors to do the same.
“In other words,” interrupts Padma, “it’s too much of a hassle. The upper ups don’t care how things work, what matters to them is the fact that the payments are made, simple as that.”
There was a time when he loathed how much he wanted this, needed this to function like a normal human being. People who thought that after saving the world everything returned to normal were deadly wrong and Harry would gladly punch them in their faces, because the reality was quite different. He missed those time; when he felt young and so afraid that the anxiousness of the whole situation became his everyday and he wasn’t frightened but felt alive. It was like a drug and partially that’s why he joined the Aurors, and partially because he simply wanted to help. His body thrived on those dangerous moments and Harry didn’t know when his work and his actions would be deemed ‘too dangerous’ for his supervisors, but he dreaded it and wanted it to be
The message on Teams tempts him. It would be so easy to just write and agree, give a time and place and just see where it goes.
But there was none. Nothing moved, except the leaves they cleared out from their path, nothing made a sound, except their long breaths, rustle of leaves and their feet stomping on a branch.
“Since I stepped on this bloody soil it feels like it.” Malfoy said unders his breath, but shrugged when he was done. “Sorry. I don’t like to be in England. It… brings unwanted attention.”
The email was sent at twelve-thirty and he remembers getting the notification in the right corner of his screen, clenching his jaw and trying not to swear even under his nose. The follow up, with the same title, but with the addition of the irritating red exclamation mark was sent twenty five minutes after the first email and Draco cannot believe that there’s somebody in this world as air headed as Harry Potter from the IT Department.
“Well then,” the blond man gave him a mocking smile. “Let’s put you to work, shall we?”
“You get used to it.” Draco clicks to change the language again and for some reason it sticks for more than two seconds. “Alright, let’s move on to the payments for rent…”
He did hear soft, “Boys,” coming from Hermione and a quiet chuckle from the older woman.
So, there was Miss Perrywinkle, her four cats and her chattiness.
“We’re sorry to hear that, our guests. We were not aware that our subject breached the gate to your world. We will fix it, and soon. In the meantime, would you like to join us for a feast? We would not like you to leave without a proper welcome. Our guests are very important to us,” said the creature and with the last sentence parted its lips in what would be an encouraging smile if it wasn’t for rows and rows of sharp, needle like teeth that the lips hid. Harry stared at it, probably a very improper thing to do, but he couldn't turn his eyes away.
“I’m…. not trying to undermine anything you saw, Malfoy, just checking.”
I… don’t really know?
“I think I know how to get us out,” Draco whispered to his cheek so soft Harry thought he imagined it.
The email is just an invitation for a meeting on Monday morning, but already it has all the points they will go through, the documentation that the previous transitions needed to fill and how it looked previously. Out of curiosity Draco looks at the other invited people and one name stands out from the rest, one name he only knows superficially, the only person he hasn’t met face to face yet: Harry Potter, IT consultant. Draco frowns, looking at the empty and gray icon, and thinks,
Enter the stage a man shorter by at least a few inches, with cute dimples and a nice smile, who’s currently looking straight at him with his green eyes and round, gold-frame glasses and
“Come to gloat, mother?” Said Draco not turning back but he almost cracked his neck as he spun around when Harry, very politely, cleared his throat and said, “Um, hi, not your mother, sorry.”
Draco looked at him for a heartbeat and for a splint of a second Harry thought that he was going to say something but changed his mind at the last moment. He turned to the sarcophagus, scowling.
When Petunia opened the back door and found him sitting on the steps she gasped and forcefully grabbed his arm to bring him inside. There was no warm tea, no blankets, just accusations that he “did it on purpose, to bring even more attention to himself,” while Dudley smirked at him from the other end of the room.
The sky is dark and the lobby is almost empty. The guard behind the long, stone desk nods back as Draco walks past and then stops just before the automatic door to tie the scarf tighter. The middle of October isn’t merciful this year; the sun sparsely comes out from behind the clouds, the rain seems to never end and Draco doesn’t remember the last time he left work while there was still some light outside. Maybe in July? Or August? He thinks, going through the automatic doors. A cold wind immediately hits him like a wall, making his eyes water as he huddles into his black coat.
that the ‘something’ he's about to annouce will not be to Draco's liking.
. Draco feels goosebumps on his arms, and
that’ll be his problem and not yours, innit?
Well. Do things.
After five minutes Harry was unbuttoning the top of his shirt, his coat lying on the grass with his yellow scarf made by Ron’s mum — a gift from few Christmas ago — thrown on top of it, and he was rolling the sleeves of his shirt up to his his elbow when he head the leaves rustled behind him and he turned in one swift movement, wand already raised. He then stopped abruptly when Draco Malfoy, with his coat slung over one shoulder and slightly damp hair, emerged from the ferns and nearly screamed.
“Shit,” repeated Draco, lowering his wand. “Holy shit.”
. Does Potter still… want him? Can he even say that? No, the better question is: does Draco want him?
“That sucks,” says Penelope under her breath and Draco shakes his head.
Although…
“It has a name, you know. Some called it Feywild, many people think that Dungeons & Dragons creators just stole the name.”
Against himself and better judgment, Harry smiled. Because no one gave him shit like Draco Malfoy did. And in the light of the few torches Draco had on and which gave the inside of the mausoleum a soft glow the man looked… good? Better than the last time Harry saw him, which was at the trail. Even though, at that time, the Malfoy’s were put under much scrutiny by the judges and the community he still walked to that jury room as if
“What Potter, you don’t want to sit on a cold floor, do each other's hair and laugh at the memories of how we tormented one another at school?”
“But a whole bar or just a piece of it?” Asks Penelope as she puts her empty, plastic container in her bag and also sits.
The moment his eyes meet Harry’s he wants to stand up and leave the room to have at least five minutes for himself. To cry or to scream, he doesn’t really know. But what he understands is this: the man that hit on him in a bar and… whose interest he somewhat reciprocated, on some level at least, is now sitting on the opposite side of the room listening intently.
Malfoy laid back, head on his coat, hair spilling like silver threads on the dark wool; Harry swallowed and took his eyes off the man, not wanting to test his control.
“Gosh, never in my life would I have thought that I could eat this much and still want a bar of chocolate,” she says as she unlocks her computer and checks for any new emails on their shared email box. Draco looks at her, lifting one of his brows.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but it seemed that he had changed his mind; he strode forward, trying to add some sort of assurance into his step.
They stared at each other for what felt like an eternity, Harry’s skin prickling with an electricity, buzzing just under the surface.
He isn’t shaken when he comes to his desk. Draco can swear the smell of seashore still lingers on his clothes and skin as he unlocks his computer and answers Padma’s questions about the meeting. He still can say that Potter had an earring in his ear, a simple gold stud that matched the rim of round glasses, that even though the trousers were a big on the too baggy side in Draco’s opinion Potter still made them look professional with the shirt and rolled up sleeves. Thankfully, he did not have flip flops, but dark-brown leather boots. And when he cocked his head and looked with interest, Draco could not focus on anything else.
“I know what that means Potter, I’m not an idiot!”
“Did you?” Draco arches his eyebrow. And then, adds, after a heartbeat. “Well. That’s good you did.”
(If Harry were honest with himself, he would have proposed to do that for him, alas, he didn’t know how Draco would react, that was the thing. How do you know if someone is into something without asking them? But then if you ask you kinda show that you’re also into the thing you’re asking about. Harry just thought that the world was much more simpler when he was at school, that’s all.
if you tell him beforehand that you want to keep things professional at work and he doesn’t do that then its on him and not you
“You don’t agree?”
After a pause Draco shrugged and it would have been nonchalant if the rigidness of his body didn’t betray him. “After you lived through hell you cannot expect anything worse to happen.”
“Hey,” said the voice and strong and warm hands took his face and turned it right. Draco’s eyes were grey like a sky just after the storm and you could see the first rays of sunshine trying to get through. “Hey, breath with me.”
Everything is alright, thanks for your help, if anything else comes up I'll write you.
IT Consultant
Hi Draco,
I’m already regretting writing
And this time Harry Potter was right. Maybe, truly, for the first time Hary did exactly was he said he would do; he gathered up a ton of dry leaves, also carefully pulled out some of the lower branches, muttering apologies to the trees, just in case, and in half an hour they had a small but very bright fire just as the sun was setting down.
And yes, his dreams about that involved kissing. And more. Sometimes. He wasn’t proud of them! He thought, before, that he dreamed about… combinations with Malfoy because he  put a nasty spell on Harry, when he wasn’t looking.But, apparently, when you don’t think about your sexuality when you’re a teenager because you have other things to do, like saving the world and so on, it comes back at you and bites you in the ass when you’re twenty and confused why you’re attracted to both men and women.
“The noises, for one thing,” Draco straightened his index fingers, counting. “There are also things missing, not much or many but still it’s a noticeable loss. Then,” third finger went up. “There are the doors.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco sights. “Unfortunately. Let’s just hope that Lockhart will actually talk with management about this, but don’t get your hopes up. In every team meeting we had, even before you, we had asked them about possibilities of hiring another person, and each time we heard that he is preparing a business proposal for the upper management.”
“I never thought about it that way,” he said and wasn’t offended when Draco snorted and said unders his nose, “No, you wouldn’t,” as he carefully took his coat, folded it and used it as a pillow as he laid down, eye closed.
And then he and Malfoy were moving as one; Harry firing Patronus spell and another one, that George taught him and fireworks bigger and better than ones of New Year’s Eve in London erupted from his wand while the white stag, sparkling like frozen snow on a sunlit day trampled the bowls and the fruits and the dishes laying before the two men. The fae shrieked and only then Harry saw the little fairies, very much like the one who came through the magical door in Miss Perrywinkle’s cemetery, popping up into existence, hissing with their teeths out like animals ensnared, wanting to attack but not really knowing how.
. Judging by the emails he received from Potter he’s either going to be working with somebody who is super competent or who’s chaos incarnate.
When Malfoy took the Kit Kat and slowly opened it, Harry let out a long and silent breath and took the Snickers, tearing the plastic with his teeth.
,” the creature said in low and enticing bones. Harry took a sharp breath and held it, waiting for Draco’s reaction; the other man had his eyes tightly shut and was biting on his lower lip almost drawing blood.
It wasn’t he who gasped, but it might. Harry peared at his right, just as the surface of Draco’s bowl shivered and transformed into an image… of a house.
at the same time.
“Draco,” he said, feeling the anger rising almost every time he talked with the other man. “First of all shut up. Second of all: I saw what you saw in that bloody bowl and I’m not offended! I’m here because I want to ask you out for dinner, a date to be more specific, because I’m bi for Christ sake!”
What is the code on flirting with your co-workers?
“Do you hear that?” He asked, voice more rugged than he thought. He felt rather than heard Draco stopping behind him, feeling the waves of heat that his body emanated. He silently gritted his teeth and made himself stay where he was, because one step back and they would probably collide, which was bad, and if he shuffled awkwardly to the front, just a few steps aways from Draco, that would be plainly suspicious. The man was a curse breaker and was definitely not stupid.
Draco is in hell because he just doesn’t understand what it
.” Said Ron, nodding thoughtfully.
It takes Draco’s brain a minute to catch on what he did, and when he send a text to his friends it simply reads:
“Well, maybe some of it will rub off on me,” Draco looked at him and Harry had to nervously swallow.
Robart narrowed his brown eyes. After a heart beat, another, then the third, he faintly shook his head.
Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, would
It was the same intensity of fear he felt right now.
The house was lovely. Very lovely. Probably lovely and Harry would think so if nervousness wasn’t burrowing a hole in his stomach as he ran up, his steps swallowed by a fluffy carpet on the stairs and in the hallway above.
“No, no objections, I think. I would have, if the fairies themselves were giving us the water but if it’s local I think we can try.”
“Because it's you! The Boy Who Lived, the one who single handedly saved the world…”
Draco shrugged again. “Do you have a better idea, Potter? Would you like us both to be sleep deprived?”
Who grabbed whose hand first was a debated they wouldn’t clear, but Harry felt his fingers closing around Draco’s hand, warm and
He was looking at his design now, hand on his hip, a triumphant smile on his face.
He collapsed against the desk surface while Harry carefully began to pull out.  He reached for his wand and cast a cleaning charm over both of them before gathering Draco in his arms and sinking to the floor.  They lay like that for a while, though neither could really say how long it truly was.
"What's wrong?" Blaise's deep voice jolted Draco out of his wishful thinking. The dark-skinned boy was leaning over the table from where he sat next to Pansy, in an attempt to read the mysterious note upside down.  The blonde blushed and hastily rolled the letter back up.
"Last I checked, you're still a Potter.  Technically, I do use your name."  Draco knew all too well what Harry was trying to say, but he was in a difficult sort of mood.  The prank letter had gotten deeper under his skin than he had initially thought apparently.  He glanced at Ha-Potter and was met with narrowed eyes and a slightly clenched jaw.
Soon enough, he had the first finger in up to the last knuckle and was thrusting in and out slowly.  He began to pick up the pace when Draco moaned and started to push his hips back on to Harry's finger.  After a few minutes, the raven-haired boy withdrew his finger and added another, slowly thrusting in. Draco winced at the slight burn and Harry waited for him to relax again, rubbing the blonde's lower back and placing kisses between his shoulder blades, before thrusting in all the way. He began to scissor his fingers, stretching Malfoy. Again, he pulled out and added a third finger, letting Draco adjust before thrusting in and out, finding his prostate in the process.  Draco gasped loudly when Harry found the bundle of nerves and moaned when he hit it again. Harry started to scissor his fingers again, making sure to brush them up against Draco's prostate each time.
That was until Harry knelt down and angled Draco's member towards his mouth, placing a chaste kiss to the tip before parting his lips and sliding them over the hot and heavy penis in his hands.  Draco had definitely been wrong. This was the most wonderful thing he had ever experienced.  Holy Merlin, it was good. He gasped as the tip of his cock hit the back of Harry's throat. He moaned when Harry kept going, taking him deep into the recesses of his mouth and throat. He cursed loudly when Harry began to suck, hollowing out his cheeks and bobbing his head a few times before swallowing around the thick head and shaft. By now, Draco could hardly breathe. He was trying and failing to not buck his hips and thrust deeper into Harry's mouth and somehow his hands had wended their way into Harry's messy hair, gripping at the base of his skull and tugging at the follicles.
"Malfoy."  Potter greeted, bringing Draco out of his momentary daze.
"But you'll fuck me elsewhere?" Harry asked breathlessly, his voice low and husky with desire.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
"Are you sure?"
While it was true the war had ended just over seven years ago, the Wizarding World was never quick to forget one's mistakes, no matter how hard he tried to make up for them.  He had spent the first two years after the war at St. Mungo's helping them brew potions and heal the sick.  He had planned on going back to the hospital after and becoming a Potions Master but figured he could do just as much good in helping to shape the minds of the future.  Plus, he could always brew healing draughts and tinctures during his free time and send them to Mungo's.
It was a day like any other at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, just as Harry Potter was hoping it would be a year like any other. Well maybe not quite like any other year, considering for the past seven, he'd been nearly killed countless times, actually killed once (although he's still wondering just how he got himself out of that sticky predicament), and hunted to exhaustion and all by one rather pissed off psychopath and his cronies. So no, maybe Harry Potter wasn't hoping for a year like any other. This year he was hoping for some peace and quiet. He was hoping to finish out his education and his Eighth Year with his friends, as they healed from the war and began to at least attempt at moving on.
"Well, yeah, I guess that would have worked.  It just seemed too…small?  I don't know.  I just...I don't know."  Potter tilted his head to the side, a small line forming between his dark brows. Draco couldn't help but think that he looked, rather infuriatingly, like a confused puppy.
"Yes! For fuck's sake, Harry, yes!" Draco was just about ready to beg for it, if he wasn't already. He was achingly hard and needed Potter like he needed air. Harry gave him a quick, blinding smile, and grabbed his wand. Before Draco could even flinch at the drawn wand, Harry had cast a silencing and locking charm on the door of the study room, ensure absolute and total privacy. He set his wand down and turned back to Draco, only to be pulled into a rough and wild kiss by the eager blonde. Draco began trailing his hands along Harry's torso, working their way down until they reached the hem of his shirt. His hands slid under the fabric and began to explore the muscled expanse that was Harry's chest. The shorter boy inhaled sharply as Draco's fingernails rasped against his hardening nipples, causing Draco to smile wickedly into the kiss.
"I'm just here for a book, Malfoy," Harry drawled. "I'm certainly not looking to start a fight."
Slowly, Harry lifted his head and let his gaze meet Draco’s.  The blonde could tell he was trying to work out some sort of inner turmoil and decision, so he waited for Potter to speak.  After a couple of minutes, although Draco could have sworn it was an eternity, Harry reached for his own mug and then indicated for Draco to take a seat.  As Draco took his tea and sat, he tried to calm the riling fear and anxiety swarming within him.  He’d come to care for Harry a great deal since the beginning of term, well before that if he was to be honest with himself, and he didn’t want to lose Harry’s friendship.  However with how Harry had been acting recently, Draco was petrified Harry was already lost to him.
"Just because he was a capable professor doesn't mean I had to like him personally.  He was far too liberal with his detentions and took points off any house save his own much too quickly."  Potter's eyes held a mischievous glint to them as he stared at Malfoy, willing the tall blonde to get riled up.
So, with his hands shoved deep in his pockets, he began to slowly walk towards his ex-rival.  It wasn't until he was about ten feet away that Potter finally took notice of him, seemingly startled by the knowledge that he wasn't alone anymore.  His head whipped around, right as he let loose another stone.  Only this one didn't skip, it hit the water with an impressive splash and sank to the bottom of the lake, while Potter stared.  And stared and stared.
"I'd heard about you becoming a Potions Master.  You'll make a good professor, much like your godfather."  Potters words were quiet yet firm, as if he was daring Draco to say otherwise.
Harry's attention snapped to Draco's lips as they moved.  "Hmmm?"  Slowly, he dragged his eyes back up to meet Malfoy's grey ones.
“Harry, I believe it is past time we talked about what’s wrong,” he began, as he pushed open the office door and stepped into the slightly cramped space.  The sight that met him was more than slightly disconcerting.  Two mugs were set out on the desk as usual, with Harry sat behind the large mahogany piece.   However, what concerned Draco was the way in which he was sitting, with his forehead resting upon the surface as he heaved out a rather large and loud sigh.  Draco softly shut the door and leaned against it, staring at the man before him.  “See, now this is precisely what I am talking about.  Clearly there is something wrong and I might be able to help of you would just tell me for Merlin’s fucking sake!”
Draco frowned a bit as they continued to wend their way through the maze of hallways that eventually led to the potions classroom, and subsequently Draco's office.  The corridors were quiet in the Sunday calm and seemed to be nearly deserted, save for the odd prefect on patrol, leaving him to his own thoughts and Potter's distant words.  If he was being honest with himself, Draco was focusing more on that particularly disturbing floppy flutter, and what it definitely did not mean, than on Potter's deep, rumbling ramble.
Draco raised his brows at that.  He knew Potter had left the Aurors after three years on the force, but he hadn't known the Golden Boy had become a professor at Hogwarts. He had gone right into the Auror Training Program after Hogwarts, and then had suddenly quit, saying he needed something else out of his life.  It had been all anyone could talk about for nearly three months, making Draco gag endlessly every time the spectacled buffoon came up in conversation.
"Harry."
"Do you ever watch where you're going, Boy Wonder? Or do you simply expect people to get out go your way, now that you're famous?" He drawled, making sure to inject his voice with an extra dose of Malfoy venom. Harry just laughed as he crossed his arms, his biceps flexing deliciously according to Draco, and leaned back against one of the many book cases surrounding them. Ever since they had returned to Hogwarts, Harry to finish his education and Draco to fulfil one of the requirements for his parole after the war, the two boys had managed to come to an unspoken truce. It was a 'you don't bother me and I won't bother you' type of silent agreement and they had stuck to it almost religiously. As such, this was the first real encounter they'd had in the month and a half they had been back.
“You love me?”  Draco asked breathlessly, as he tried not to smile too much, receiving only a painfully hesitant nod in return.  “I see.  And just when did you come to this shocking conclusion of self-discovery?”
Potter chuckled quietly, crossing his arms and leaning against the stone wall of the corridor.  "Ah, Minnie didn't tell you, did she?"  He shook his head in amusement and looked Draco up and down before smirking ever so slightly.  "I'm the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.  Have been for two years now."
Harry was finding himself rather surprised by Malfoy.  It wasn't that he had been expecting the pointy git to still be evil (if he had ever truly been evil to begin with), but he hadn't expected the warm civility the man radiated either.  When Minnie had told him she was hiring none other than Draco Malfoy to be their new Potions Professor, Harry hadn't exactly been thrilled.  He'd known Malfoy was the natural choice to take over Horace's position, but he just hadn't been prepared for that day to come so soon.  His face must have shown his thoughts, because as soon as Minerva was finished breaking the news to him, she went right into, what was probably a well-rehearsed, speech about professionalism in the work place and the merits that come along with letting go of old rivalries.
"Well, Potter? Are you going to say anything, or are you just going to stand there and brood all damned day?" Not that Draco minded the brooding, Harry had the sexy brood down to an art, but it wasn't as if he'd ever let the Golden Boy himself know that.
"Nothing's wrong?  Why does something have to be wrong?  Does it seem like something's wrong?"  Draco winced at how high pitched and panicked his voice sounded, even to him.
"Ouch!" He narrowed his eyes and glared at the offending creature. "Well what the bloody fuck was that for?"
Harry’s head snapped up and he turned to stare in shock and rising horror at her.  “Minnie knows!?  She’s going to think I’m so unprofessional!  And after she gave me that whole speech about being professional in the workplace.  I know that was about letting old rivalries die, but the principles are the same and I’ve completely cocked it up”  He bemoaned.
"I guess we should, huh?"  Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly as Draco donned his jacket.  He smiled though, when the tall blond offered him his arm to lead him out of the, now crowded, pub.  Neither spoke as they wove their way through the mass of people and headed towards the door.  The rush of cool, winter air was a shock as they stepped outside into the chilly evening.  "Well, I guess I'll see you around," Harry blushed as he began to pull away from Draco to apparate home, only to be stopped as Draco tugged his arm.  Harry looked up into those fathomless grey eyes, his blush deepening as Draco's eyelids began to droop shut and his face began to slowly descend to Harry's.
"Well...," and so Draco began to tell Harry about his day before moving on to tell him about his week.  Another two drinks in and the was listening to Harry about his day and his week, all the while getting lost in those hypnotic jade eyes.
"If I recall correctly, you never particularly got along with Severus."  Draco quirked one immaculate brow up, carefully ignoring the implication that Potter did indeed know about his relation to the late Potions Master.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at the endearment that seemed to slip so effortlessly from Draco’s kiss swollen lips.  “I am a pillock.  And a dolt.  Not to mention a moron, idiot, or any other words that mean oblivious.  I really thought you would want nothing to do with me after I told you.  I didn’t dare let myself hope you’d feel as I do.”  Harry smiled gently at Draco and touched their foreheads together, sighing contently.
The early September air was crisp, with the lingering warmth of summer slowly giving way to the cool breezes of autumn.  Draco Malfoy could already tell that this year would be particularly chilly come winter.  But for now, he was perfectly content to stand outside, on the stone steps leading to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and enjoy the already setting Scottish sun.  As he stood there, on the second step, his trunk sitting one step below him, he took in a deep breath and tilted his head back to stare up at the looming castle.  He hadn't exactly been all that surprised when he had received a letter from Minerva McGonagall on the third day of the first week of July, asking if he would like to return to Hogwarts as the new Potions Professor.  He knew it would come one day, as Horace Slughorn was bound to retire soon, and Draco was the only other Potions Master in Great Britain.  However, he certainly hadn't expected the letter to come so soon, not when he had only become a Potions Master this past May.  Though, he supposed that he should be glad to have found a job so quickly, especially one that would take him considering his past allegiances.
It took him a few seconds to come to the conclusion that he wished the blond hadn't left. It took him a few more to realize just why he wished the blond hadn't left. And it took him a few more seconds to decide to go after him. A total of thirty seconds after Malfoy's escape, Harry had found him still walking through the stacks of books, towards the front of the library. Seeing as they were still relatively far back in the library, Harry had absolutely no qualms about what he was about to do.
Draco Malfoy blinked twice as he stared into Harry's mesmerizing emerald green eyes before narrowing his own grey ones and hastily scrambling off the ravenette's chest. A chest he tried not to pay too much attention to as stood up. Well, tried and failed, quite miserably in fact. It took a moment for him to realize that he was still staring, as Harry managed to stand. His gaze travelled up the expanse of the shorter boy's incredibly muscular chest, to his broad shoulders and finally to his face. He took in his square jaw, straight nose, shining eyes, and his hair that somehow always seemed to look as if he'd just had the most mind blowing, life changing sex ever. It simply wasn't fair. At last he forced himself to focus on Harry's expression. With one pure black eyebrow raised in question and eyes alight with confusion, Draco saw just how much he had accidentally revealed in what must have been no more than a five second encounter. Boy was he fucked. He needed to stop that slow dawning of realization that was creeping into Harry's expression fast.
Harry groaned softly and let his head fall into his hands.  “Do you guys think everyone else knows?  Do you think he knows?”  He didn’t really need their answers though, the hesitant silence from both of them were confirmation enough.
"I think we ruined my letter," Draco's voice was almost a whisper in the contented silence.
(See the end of the chapter for
The second Friday of January had gotten off to a bad start for Harry.  He had woken up late, had spilled tea all down his Auror robes, and had hit yet another dead end in what was turning out to be a particularly flummoxing case.  So, when he had arrived at the usual pub, just off Diagon Alley, at six in the evening he was looking forward to a night of relaxed fun with his mates.  However, at precisely 6:05 Hermione's owl dropped a hastily penned note on the table before him.
Draco looked down at Harry's face, trying to read just what was going on in that mind of his. Harry had to have known about the scars, he had put most of them there in sixth year, not that Draco blamed him. He obviously hadn't known what the spell was for, and if he was being perfectly honest with himself, he was a bit of an asshole back then.
"Firewiskey, please."  Was Draco's only response, still not looking up from the table.  As Harry made his way up to the bar to put in their drink orders, Draco groaned.  Of course Pansy would leave him to Potter alone.  "
“Mmm I usually am, but what about this time, love?”
a friendship with me?  You want more than a friendship?”
"Yeah!  I'd love that."  Potter's face visibly brightened as his head bobbed up and down in an enthusiastic nod, causing Draco to smile just a little more.  He turned back towards the looming castle, determined to not look back at Potter's overly jubilant expression.  He set a brisk pace as he walked back up to the looming doors of Hogwarts, only pausing once he made it up the massive steps to let his companion catch up to him.
"Oh fuck, Draco!  You feel amazing. So hot and tight and perfect," Harry groaned out as he pounded into Draco. Each thrust bringing them both closer to blissful oblivion.
"Haven't the faintest, Ms. Marks." Harry managed to squeak out, before shaking his head and continuing on with his lecture.  It was almost ten minutes before the end of class and by the time he let his students go for the day, all Harry could think of was Draco and his office.  Apparently, many of his students were in the same boat, as they shot a good deal of poorly concealed curious glances at the wooden door as they left.
Draco leaned down, so his forehead was resting on Potter's, and spoke softly, but firmly. "Harry, listen to me. We all make mistakes. Merlin knows I've made plenty. I forgave you for that a long time ago. Plus, if my memory serves me right, I was attempting to crucio you in that moment, so technically you were defending yourself. I don't blame you." Carefully, he brought his hands up to Harry's face, cupping both cheeks softly. He looked into Potter's eyes and made sure the boy saw how honest he was being in this moment. Potter gave a shy smile before Draco fitted his lips back onto his.
He clenched his fists at his sides as he nearly stomped his way back across the chilly Hogwarts grounds.  He had just reached the outskirts of the courtyard outside the Entry Hall to the castle when a hand wrapped itself around his wrist and he was yanked around, coming face to face with the very source of his inner turmoil.
"I believe in efficiency, Potter."  Draco murmured, shortening his stride nonetheless and earning himself a crooked grin in return.  He decided not to dwell on the somewhat floppy, fluttery manoeuvre his stomach did as a result of that slightly mischievous smile.  He told himself it was nothing really, that it was his stomach's peculiar way of reminding him he'd skipped lunch earlier today and that was it.  It had to be nothing, because what else could it be?
“Of course, you pillock,” Draco said fondly, as he rolled his eyes.  “I mean, it’s not as you’re not absolutely gorgeous yourself.  Not to mention almost sickeningly kind and deceptively clever, well, most of the time.  Honestly, Potter, how could you ever doubt tha-oomph,” Draco’s sentence was cut off as Harry launched himself across the desk, spilling both their tea in the process, and pressing their lips together in a heated, yet reverent, kiss.
"I think the poor thing wants a treat, Draco darling," Pansy drawled, raising one perfectly shaped brow at him.
"Out of anyone in the Wizarding World, Potter, and you decide to have a chat with me?"
"No, not a thing," Pansy drawled, sharing a look with the dark-skinned young man next to her.
He pulled his hands away from Harry and couldn't help but smile at the look of utter loss on Harry's face.  "I do believe it is time for us to be heading home."  He said softly, his voice caressing over Harry as he stood too.
"P?  Who the hell is P?"  He muttered aloud. "Pansy maybe?  No, it's not her handwriting."  He'd know Pansy's handwriting anywhere, with its flowery loops and delicate slant. No, this definitely wasn't Pansy's writing. Not to mention, she wouldn't pull a prank like this. She might send him a letter like this to cheer him up, she hated when he acted so self-conscious, but she certainly wouldn't add any of the sexual shit. Draco was pretty sure she was gayer than he was, which was saying a lot.  Letting out a frustrated sigh, he set the letter down and leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes.
"I want you. Merlin, I want you," Draco whimpered, not even caring how weak and desperate he sounded. All he could think about right now was the feeling of Potter on him and how to get it back. Harry looked him in the eyes and nodded.
"Would you just wait for a second?"  Potter was breathing heavily, his chest rapidly rising up and down.  "Holy shit, you're a fast walker."
"Right.  See?  Nothing is wrong at all.  Everything is great actually."  Draco ran a hand through his white gold hair.  "Look, I'm going to go.  I, uh, I've got to go to the, uh, library.  We have that essay for Binns, you know."  He managed to stutter out as he stood, putting the letter in his bag and slinging the leather strap over his shoulder before walking out of the Great Hall.  He could feel Blaise and Pansy staring after him, confused by his decidedly odd reaction to the letter.  However, what he was completely oblivious to, was the bright green gaze that tracked him from the Slytherin table to the doors of the Great Hall.
“Well, I couldn’t say if Draco knows, but people have definitely started to notice, Harry,” Hermione said quietly, while placing her hand on his knee.  “However,” she spoke again, a little louder to be heard over his groan of embarrassment, “I wouldn’t be surprised if he reciprocated.  From the letters McGonagall and I have exchanged, it seems as if he’s fairly taken with you as well.”
Draco groaned internally at the utter stupidity of his damn emotions.
He looked straight into Harry's eyes for a few seconds before lowering his gaze to the ground in defeat. "Sorry, Scarhead." He mumbled as he began to turn away. He had a sudden urge to be as far away from Harry Potter as possible. It wasn't as if he'd ever have a chance with him anyhow.
, he shut the door and made his way to the desk where Malfoy was seated.  "That wasn't exactly an invitation, Potter."  Draco drawled, watching from the corner of his eye as the shorter boy grabbed a chair from another desk and dragged it over.  The blonde let out an irritated huff when Potter sat barely a foot away and settled his piercing green gaze on him.
"Harry....oh fuck....Harry, you have to stop."  Harry pulled his mouth off Draco's cock with an audible pop, looking up at the blonde with concerned eyes.
Harry was pondering just what to do as he wandered further and further into the maze of books that was the Hogwarts Library. Earlier that week, the Eighth Years had been assigned a project in Defence Against the Dark Arts and Harry was having a particularly frustrating time with it. The green-eyed boy sighed heavily as he continued to search for books to use for research. He was certain he was nearing the very back of the library by now and he had still found nothing he thought to be useful. He had just turned the corner to start on a new row when he suddenly found himself on the cold stone floor, with a rather suspicious weight on top of him. He grunted and fixed his, now completely askew, glasses before looking down at his chest and more importantly what, or in this case who, had crashed into him. Needless to say, he was rather shocked to see a head of white-blond hair, a sharp nose, and light grey eyes staring right at him.
By the time Harry reached Draco's collarbones, Draco was a whimpering, moaning mess. His head was thrown back, giving Harry more access to the sensitive skin of his neck and his hips were bucking against Harry's, desperate in their quest for any sort of friction at all. Draco's erection was straining painfully against his trousers, the head already beginning to leak.  His head snapped up when Harry began undoing the buttons to his trousers, releasing his aching cock and shoving both his trousers and pants down.  He helped Draco step out of the rumpled pile of clothes before lifting the boy onto the desk and stepping between his parted thighs.  He gingerly grasped Draco's cock and began to lightly stroke up and down.  Draco threw his back again, his lungs going tight as he attempted to haul in a breath.  The pleasure was so incredibly amazing. Draco had never experienced something so wonderful in his life.
“You’re what?” That statement made Draco turn and Harry swallowed nervously because the man looked as if something chewed him out; there were dark circles under his eyes, his shining hair was less shiny and more floppy and all Harry wanted to do was hug him and say that everything’s is going to be alight.
you open your mouth and you say it, you’re doing it all the time.
But only a little.
“As much as I would like it, no. We would have to send an official email to the Treasury Manager in Sweden, then he would have to look into this thing, make a business plan if we can even afford the change and to which bank we could switch. There’s also a link between the current bank and the programme,” he points with his hand at the second screen where their accounting program is open. “So the IT would have to check that…”
“So, if the water is enough, maybe I can offer something more?” The creature said and the leaves rustled gently in a sudden breeze Harry looked around gingerly and didn’t notice that the plate suddenly disappeared and instead two golden bowls with a crystal clear water stood before them. He tentatively peered in, drawn to the surface like a moth to light and he heard Draco’s voice quietly saying his name so full of tension in one, single word that normally Harry would pause and think, but the desire to see the bottom of the bowl was stronger.
“...and your bi? And you want to go on a date with me, and ex-Death Eater? Are you sane?”
The fire crackled and after minutes — maybe then, fifteen — he smiled to himself as Draco started softly snoring.
Yes, please
“It’s not,” said Harry, his voice suddenly soft and lower than normal. He cleared his throat and continued, “It’s not, I’m only stating a fact.”
exactly but he knew that it was currently laughing at him in earnest.
“Ah, yes. As always
“Oh, right,
After an hour and a half, Draco feels glued to his chair. His mug is empty, Penelope is already sitting at her desk checking her calendar for the usual trainings, the Icelandic invoices are paid. His mailbox is still full of new emails, but one catches Draco’s attention: from the Transition Manager, Susan Bones. Draco closes eyes for three seconds, thanking God for Susan, one of the two Transition Managers but definitely the more competent one. He does not want to think about the second.
It's pitiful, really. No, he needs to be honest with himself: he is bloody pitiful. He knows that he should be happy for Padma and he is, but a part of him, one that is still a Malfoy that was ingrained in him by his father and mother and their aristocratic family, wants to squash Padma’s happiness because it means he won’t be happy in foreseeable future, not at all.
“Yes, maybe. So, what’s your take on the case?” Harry preyd his eyes away from the handsome man’s face, hoping that the blush didn’t claw it’s way deeper inside his cheeks, making his freckles more pronounced. He inherited his dark skin and wild hair from his father, but the freckles and eyes were from his mom.
god Pansy you’re SO FUCKING SMART
Draco’s, “See you,” is as quick as his exit from the meeting room. Safely in the elevator -- alone -- he can swear he still smells Harry’s --
“Had to try.”
“Eloquent as ever.”
“Carefull, Potter,” Malfoy shouted from the other side of the garden, wind making the strands of his silver hair move like branches of a willow tree on a gloomy Saturday morning. “You don’t want to know how much these cost!”
“He woke up three hours ago and signed himself off. Believe it or not he was in better shape than you were.”
That made Harry open his eyes abruptly. “He said what?”
It looked like a lightbulb at first, slowly floating in the air, radiating a warm light, the colour of coffee with too much milk inside rather than the starkness of sun’s rays when it woke Harry up in the morning and he had to aggressively blink and swear that yet again he forgot to install the blinds.
to get away from them!”
“So, I take it that you come here quite often, then?” He says, voice low, only for Draco to hear.
“Shit,” said Draco and Harry immediately abandoned staring at his surroundings and turned towards the man who was glaring at the wall behind them. It was solid red brick with no sign of any doors, whatsoever.
“Alright, Penelope,” he turns to the woman. “How would you answer it?”
“Have you tried to write to them on Teams?” Was what Lockhart wrote in between the many meetings he had and Draco balled his hand into a fist; otherwise he would probably try to punch the screen. How this man got the job of being a Team Leader to both Treasury Management and the Accounts Receivable is something Draco will never understand. He knows Lockhart too well and as the member of Treasury Management Team with the highest seniority he can predict, with the precision of an olympic archer, in how deep shit he is with his superior based on the way he puts  punctuation in his messages. He’s still good, but if there was space between the last letter and the question mark, well, Draco could book a room for a thorough conversation.
If he’s writing this on Teams then it means he is definitely interested.
“Yeah?” Harry turns his head slightly right as if trying to figure out something. Draco feels the wave of heat on his skin and bites the inside of lip. He only nods in response, clutching his laptop to his chest as if it was his baby while Harry has his dangling by his right leg. “See you on Teams?” Harry adds to which Draco nods, but with a shy smile.
“It seems to me like the two of you have a lot of things to talk through.” She said at last after a long and tense moment of silence.
His hand was squeezed harder then, as if Draco was reading his mind, but it made Harry finally look up from the cup to see their host watching him thoughtfully and he blurted, “Sorry, what?”
“No,” said Malfoy absent minded, leaned in and corrected the outline of the circle by a millimeter. “I went to Poland and Ukraine for some time. Then I spent a year in Russian, came back to Poland for a year and went to Egypt to do curse work.”
Elaborate?
They stood up, hands clasped, and Harry felt Draco’s hand trembling. He looked at the man, his lips tight, breathing hard through the nose and before he knew it he was pressed to his side, his other hand on the small of his back where Draco’s shirt was already sticking to his skin, and he said to his ear, “You’re doing great. Say a word and we’re out,” squeezing his hand. He could feel the warmth of Draco’s body and it was tempting, so tempting, but the time and place weren’t
What struck Harry the most — and he thought about it, much much later — was the fact that the both of them looked
“You’re a fucking idiot,” said Draco, before he leaned forward and braced his hands on his knees while his shoulder shook with laughter. Harry hadn’t felt so light
“Can’t we just… change the bank?” Ask Penelope and
“What if we never come back?” He asked, voice raspy and quiet and for a moment he thought that Draco didn’t hear him.
, told Ginny that they should split up, that even though it sounded so cliche it was really not her but him, he never felt so afraid as he did then. Fighting Voldemort was easy because fighting Voldemort was something he could prepare for. But breaking a loved one’s heart? That’s not something you can train for under the cover of the night.
“I am not panicking,” he lied, rolling up his sleeves even further.
Thank you for reading! This little thing of a fic kind of went out of control as at the beginning it was supposed to be one shortish thing and not a four chapter monster.
The man had longer hair — it would reach his jaw if it wasn’t gathered up in a messy bun — but they were still almost silver and even in this light they looked almost like silk. Harry thought that maybe, if he had enough courage to touch them, they would feel like the most luxurious thing in the world. The man’s face was sharper and a little bit tanned, his eyes focused in front of him. He sighed, deeply; Harry watched the rise and fall of his chest under an black, woolen coat, how impatiently the wand flickered in his hand, fingers long and slender.
“Good, eh?”
“I’m looking and not seeing anything remotely interesting,” Draco muttered and Harry laughed, titling his head back.
He isn’t proud of taking a deeper breath to try to smell more.
“Did anybody tell you you’re funny as hell?” He asked, opening his eyes and stopping mid laugh, seeing Draco’s flushed face, which was turned away the moment Harry’s eyes locked on his, as if in embarrassment.
Draco Malfoy
“Yeah, well, you weren’t better either.”
“Far from it,” Draco laughed, the sound echoing from the walls. Harry closed his hands in his pocket, trying not to flinch under the hollowness of the sound.
Draco looked at the thermos in Harry’s hand, at Harry and he sighed. “Please tell me it’s good tea.”
“Really?”
you’re a menace you know that
The moment he sends the email the website loads up and Draco smiles, seeing the confirmation of the transfer. Their factory in Mexico will have electricity for the upcoming week, rejoyce!
Harry looked at Draco who nodded in return and they were sprinting, ground still shaking underneath their feet, towards the mausoleum when the light started to disappear as it went down, further into the ground. Harry muttered
Draco sighs and hides his phone back in the drawer. And then he does something he hasn’t ever done since starting his job at Stanson: he logs into messenger on the browser, makes a screenshot out of the last conversation with Harry and sends it to his friends
He saw some of that boy in the man standing before him, in the way he held his head up high, how he looked at him and didn’t see The Boy Who Lived but just a menace from school that seemed to follow him even to his job.
The ghost wasn’t the main issue that Miss Perrywinkle had with the house. It made some noises in the night, shook the house a couple of times, but overall it wasn’t why the called for the Aurors.
do you want to pin him against a wall and kiss him senseless while humping his leg?
His relationship with Ginny was fine; their house was fine; their life was fine. But now, as Harry was lying in the middle of the night, seconds slowly ticking by, Ginny still asleep at his side, he felt only resentment. Not for the woman next to him,
Draco does not have a lot of friends, but then, who at thirty years old has? There are friends that you see once a year or even less frequently; there are those  you stay in contact with but you meet in real life once all the planets are in the right phase and the moon is full and bright in the sky which also doesn’t guarantee you will meet them at all.
“No, they only taught us to get back to civilization as soon as possible,” answered Harry, without heat or anger in his voice, expecting the jab from Draco anyway. He took another sip of the water and stood up in fluid motion. “I’m going to gather as much as I can and we will have a fire in no time.”
Draco grimaced and nodded to himself, as he felt the heated flush of embarrassment creep its way up his neck.  "Right, well, I'll just...uhm...you know," he pointed back towards the castle with one thumb before quickly turning on his heel and striding back up to the school.   How could he be so stupid?  He'd let the general civility between him and Potter this past month and a half cloud his judgement.  He should never have said anything.  Or better yet, the moment he knew just who it was down by the lake, he should have turned tail and ran in the opposite direction.  Because all he had done with that pathetic little display down there, was make a complete and utter fool of himself.  Of course Potter didn't want to talk to him.  Of course he was suspicious.  Draco had been an absolute twat to the man when they were growing up, and he knew it.  Why he thought Potter would ever want to speak with him after everything he did, he didn't know.  Merlin, he was such a fucking idiot!
" he tried to remind himself.  He sighed heavily and dropped his head to join his hands on the table.  "
Harry didn’t want
Draco had decided he was done waiting for Harry to tell him what was wrong.  It was almost mid-December by now, and Harry seemed to be growing more and more distant.  They’d still have their daily chats over tea and sometimes they’d even accompany one another into Hogsmeade for their Christmas shopping.  However, despite their near constant company, Draco could feel Harry was distracted or troubled about something.  At first, he’d thought he’d something wrong, or had offended Harry in some way.  But he hoped Potter would be mature enough to tell him if he was angry with him for any reason.  Regardless, he was tired of waiting for Potter to get his shit together and tell him just what in the ever-living fuck was going on in that impossibly thick skull of his.  It was high time he confronted the infuriating man to figure out what had changed between them.  So, it was with no small amount of trepidation that Draco wrapped up his last class of the day and made his way to Potter’s office for their daily tea.
Harry groaned around Malfoy's cock, the vibrations going straight to the base of Draco's spine. He was moaning loudly enough for the sounds to echo off the walls of the room, making him immensely grateful for the silencing charm Harry had cast.
Draco felt a cold spike of anxiety lance through his stomach.  “Can’t keep doing what, exactly?”
"One firewhiskey.  Ogden's Finest,"  Harry said as he set the glass down with an audible thunk in front of Draco, still smiling.  Draco looked at the glass, and then back at Harry before returning the shorter man's smile and thanking him.  "So," Harry's deep voice washed over him as he sat down again.  "How have you been?  I mean, I know we just saw each other a couple of days ago,  but we didn't really get the chance to catch up."  Draco looked, meeting Harry's bright green eyes with his own grey ones.
_____________________________________________________
Harry broke their eye contact with a self-deprecating huff.  “How can I not want something more, Draco?  You are amazing and witty and gorgeous.  But I know you don’t want anything more from me, which is why I can’t keep doing this.”
As Harry's mouth was devouring Draco's, he quickly began to work on undoing the buttons of Draco's shirt, brushing his fingertips over each newly revealed inch of creamy, pale white skin. Finally, he had Draco's shirt open and began to run his hands over the taller boy's shoulders and chest, stopping short when he ran into the scars that littered Draco's lithe torso. Slowly, he brought the kiss to a halt and leaned far enough back to look down at the scars, tracing a few of the particularly long ones.
"Give him a chance, Harry."  She'd told him, her face as stern as ever.  "He just might surprise you."  Of course she'd been right, he groused to himself, as he pretended not to stare at the blonde over the pages of the Daily Prophet.  It had been exactly one week since the start of term, and Dra-no, Malfoy had been nothing but cordial.  It was certainly a far cry from the cool indifference Harry had been expecting.  He gave his colleagues polite nods and courteous smiles and managed the children with warm efficiency.  If Harry was being honest, Malfoy rather reminded him of Minerva.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draco gave one last little nip to Harry's jaw. "The Room of Requirement, ten minutes." He stated, sounding more like a command than anything to Harry, before striding away towards the exit, and presumably the seventh floor and Room of Requirement.
Blaise smirked and rolled his eyes.  "Oh, yeah, nothing's wrong at all."
"Do you always walk so fast?"  Potter huffed, shooting him an amused look from where he was walking, his shoulder lightly brushing against Draco's.
The Second Wizarding War was over.  Voldemort was finally dead, and all that was left was for the survivors to pick up the pieces of their lives and move on.  It was easier said than done as the Wizarding World slowly began to put itself back together.  The Golden Trio went back to Hogwarts along with the rest of their class mates and finished their education.  They mourned their losses, patched up old rivalries, and settled down to study for their N.E.W.Ts.  As their Eighth Year passed, Ron, Hermione, and Harry found peace with the rest of their students, particularly with Slytherin's favourite three.  Blaise, Pansy, and Draco had approached the Golden Trio in mid-November to call a truce.  By January, a budding friendship had emerged between the six, and by march, they were inseparable.  What was most surprising to all of Hogwarts, and the Wizarding World, was the friendship between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.  In fact, the only two who were not utterly dumbfounded by the development were Hermione Granger and Pansy Parkinson.  They had simply shared a knowing look and a smirk when Harry had been the first to break down and call Malfoy by his given name.  They had smirked again when Draco had called Potter by his given name, and for the first time, actually smiled at the shorter boy.  When graduation finally rolled around, Harry and Draco were the best of friends, and insisted that they all get together at least once a month to catch up after they left Hogwarts for good.
"Well, yeah. I thought that was obvious.  Was it not?  I mean, considering what just happened and all.  The letter was actually what I had initially come to talk to you about."
“RONALD,” Hermione shrieked, hitting her husband in the arm and receiving a rather indignant ‘ow’ in return, much to Harry’s amusement.  He let them bicker on while he pondered his situation.  If Draco truly did reciprocate his feelings, what would be next?  He would assume they’d date, but it’d been so long since he’d had a proper relationship, he wasn’t entirely sure he would know how to go about it.  Of course, there was always the possibility Draco only saw Harry as a friend, and then what?  Would they be able to stay friends if Harry told Malfoy how he felt and he was turned down?  He would hope so, but he wasn’t sure he wanted to risk it.  As Molly called out that dinner was a ready and Ron and ‘Mione stopped bickering, Harry came to the decision he would need more time to think about Draco and the possibilities surrounding their relationship.  He’d fucked too many things up by just rushing in with his Gryffindor courage and stupidity (as Draco would call it).  No, he needed time to weigh out all the options and possible consequences.  He was not going to fuck up what he had with Draco because he was too busy following his dick instead of his brain.  Besides, as much as he wanted a relationship with Draco, there was no way he was going to force the man into something if he didn’t want it.  Draco deserved to be happy, and Harry wasn’t sure he could be the one to make him happy.
After their third drink each, Harry was leaning a little closer to Draco as he talked, and Draco was inching his hand ever so slowly over the table  towards Harry's.  By now it was 9:00 and both men were completely lost in each other.  The alcohol in their systems giving them the courage to start flirting, and the lack of rejection fuelling their bravery.  It was 9:30 before Draco finally mustered up the courage to cover Harry's hand with his own.  Harry froze, sucked in a breath, and looked down at those long pale fingers twining with his.  He smiled and dragged his gaze up to Draco's, squeezing the man's hand to let him know that yes, he was alright with this, and yes, he felt the same way, before continuing their conversation.  By 10:00, Harry had reached out to take Draco's other hand, his thumb grazing over his pale knuckles as they talked.  By 10:30, Draco decided it was time for them both to leave.
It had been three weeks since Harry and Draco had first had tea together and it had quickly become a daily ritual.   Each day, just as Harry was finishing up his last class, Draco (and yes, he had taken to calling him Draco by now) would saunter into his classroom, past the whispering students, and waltz right into Harry's office to make them both cups of tea.  The first time it had happened was the day after the lake incident, as Harry now called it.  He had been so stunned when Draco had breezed through his classroom and up into his office, he'd stopped lecturing his fourth years on the uses and properties of the Homenum Revelio spell and merely stared at his, now shut, office door for a few seconds.
Harry watched him as he left, or rather he watched his ass. He let his head fall back to rest on the book case one last time as he grinned up at the ceiling. He'd have to remember to thank his Defence Professor later for that damn project. It did lead him to the library after all.
“Well it’s hardly surprising, Ronald,” Hermione quietly interjected.  “It’s not like we didn’t see this coming.”
Harry scowled even more and shook his head to rid himself of that particularly disturbing thought.  His eyes flicked back up to Malfoy, sat just across from him at the professor's table, eating his typical breakfast of oatmeal with a light sprinkling of cinnamon and meticulously cut up apple slices.  Really, he had to stop noticing these things.  His scowl deepened some more, it was like sixth year all over again and Hermione would
"Oh...I....uhhh...I just wanted to...um...." Harry's eyes flitted down to the desk, spotting the letter, and then back up to meet Draco's, swallowing thickly before opening his mouth again and quickly shutting it.
“You defeated Lord Voldemort,” Malfoy smirked as Harry rolled his eyes. “Let’s see if you can do a more basic thing.”
Harry nodded, dumbfounded, staring at the empty clearing; the grass was green and lush, but in contrast to the one they were walking though, this one wasn’t so high as it barely went above his ankles and it looked soft more like a fur than a grass. The stream that cut through the middle of the clearing was a small one, the water flowing without obstruction. The pebbles were polished and flat inside of the stream, the water was clear and there were no signs of any other animals. Still, he stood, like the greek sculptures on his bookshelves that held the few tomes he had — most for Aurors training, but he enjoyed a pulp romance or fantasy book written by a witch or a wizard from time to time — and let Dracon lean in even closer, the grip of his hand tightening (the material of his shirt clung to his sweaty body and no, Harry did not want to think further, he wanted to be brain dead at this point), his other hand with a wand extended above Harry’s arm. He muttered a few spells, some of which Harry knew, most not, and after a brief silence Draco said, “All clear, we can go.”
remember, we will support you no matter what but DAMN get that pussy! (or a dick! love is love *kiss emoji*)
“Of course Aurors first,” Draco smiled fully at him now; Harry had to look at the palms and the ferns that swayed gently under a breeze that for a moment made the air more breathable. He didn’ want to do anything stupid.
"So it wasn't a prank or from Pansy?"
"Harry, please," Draco begged. He wiggled his hips a little to let Harry know he was ready. The ravenette grabbed Draco's hips and held him against the desk as the thrust hard and fast into his ass, causing both to scream out in pleasure.
"Tell me, when did you get so eloquent, Harry?"  Draco arched a well-shaped brow at Potter, a smirk settling over his pale pink lips.  Pale pink lips that Potter was now staring at rather intently.  They both stayed silent for a few moments as the air shifted and became charged with an electricity neither could explain.
Harry was staring at his two friends in slight indignant shock.  “Hey now!  I am perfectly capable of figuring out my feelings for myself,” Harry declared, studiously ignoring the matching arched eyebrows from the newlyweds.  “Besides, it’s not like it was that obvious…right?”
Draco hadn't exactly been lying when he said he would be going to the library.  He had simply been lying about writing that essay for Professor Binns. He had finished that assignment days ago and had already turned it in. Instead, he went to the very back of the library, to the secluded study rooms hardly anyone knew about, let alone used. Draco himself had found them on a fluke, in sixth year, when he had needed a fairly secluded and secret place to plan out just how in the hell he was going to deal with the task The Dark Lord had given him. So, he knew he would be relatively safe from prying eyes as he tried to figure out what the fuck this letter was.
a friendship with you, Malfoy.  It’s too hard.  You’re killing me Draco, and you don’t even know it.”  He finally looked into Draco’s eyes, his viridian gaze bright with what looked like unshed tears.
"Me too, Draco.... ohhhh fuck!"  Harry screamed out as he came hard and fast inside Draco, coating his insides white with come.  The feeling of being filled by Harry sent Draco over the edge.  Letting out a breathy, high pitched scream, Draco spurted come over both the desk and his stomach.
"It has to be a joke. A prank. Who would write something like this to someone like me?" He muttered to himself, rather dejectedly, running a delicate hand through his white-blonde hair. Taking the letter out of his bag and unrolling it again, he sighed and sat down at the worn and scratched wooden desk in the centre of the room. The scrawling, messy handwriting seemed vaguely familiar, but he couldn't put his finger on it. "Of course it's a joke, Draco. Don't be stupid." He told himself irritably. There was no way it wasn't a joke.  He sighed and began to read the letter again, brows scrunching together, and lips pressed into a thin line.  When he reached the end of the page, he scowled even more.
“Oh I had great help.”
He was lying in his bed, feeling the outline of Ginny’s body at his side, her steady breath the only thing he could hear in their bedroom apart from his hammering heart.
“Oh,” said Harry simply. “I didn’t know.”
Malfoy blinked.
Draco scoffed and took another sip. “Truly horrendous.”
He had drops of water on his eyelashes, Harry realised, and it took everything he had not to lean in to feel the man’s skin under his palm, to brush the water away.
They stand up at the same time, the girls chatting as they move behind Draco and Harry who wait for them to leave the room. Suddenly it’s hard to breathe as Harry -- Potter for now, they are at work after all -- moves first to the doors.
After a beat of silence Harry said, ”Wait, what? You should iron your jeans?” To which Draco laughed, head tilted back and for a moment Harry lost his ability to breath, seeing the other man’s smiling face, the outline of his delicate throat.
“I am not asking for another Lord Voldemort,” he said to Robart just two weeks prior, after throwing a very thin folder with a case that had a lot of publicity and politics involved but not much Auror work. “Just… Give me something worthwhile! I am a good Auror, am I not?”
“We were charged by a Lady From Above to find who were their mysterious visitors who trashed her garden. We tried to talk to them, however, they didn’t, ah, agree to the terms of the talk and escaped the circle.” Draco explained, voice steady and unbreaking and Harry felt warmth blossoming in his chest because clearly the man knew what he was doing and he was doing it carefully which filled Harry with a sort of pride that should be examined if he had time.
“Yeah, no shit,” muttered Harry, brows drawing closer as he tried to decipher Draco’s writing. It was sort of all over the place and not, runes draw carefully with a precision that he never could muster — run drawing wasn’t his strongest suit, never was, he just sort of, ah, went for it? His gut feelings have helped him in the past and he wasn’t going to not listen to them anymore — the lines were straight and perfect, as if Draco had a layout he used. The runes went from the wall all around the sarcophagus to the others side of it, creating an ominous half circle.
“Mate, you were gone for almost four weeks. We got an owl from Miss Perrywinkle that you and Draco just disappeared from the case so we started looking. You will tell me everything after the healers look over you, alright mate?” He added, tightening his grip on Harry’s shoulders and without a warning they materialised on the hospital’s front law and then it was healers asking him questions, looking through his cuts and bruises, giving him elixir after elixir to drink and when they finally let him sleep Harry woke up unknown amount of time later still tired but groggy, quiet lethargic and with a hallowing and aching need to see Draco Malfoy’s face.
“What?” He asked. Draco smiled with the corner of his lips and shook his head. “Nothing. Shall we?” He made a small bow, pointing with his hands towards the wall of green. Harry rolled his eyes. “Aurors first?”
“That's why you married me.”
You like him and he likes you, so the feeling is mutual. Question is, what do you want?
but oh my
Draco rolled his eyes, “Yes, well, I have something that you’re lacking,” Draco tilted his chin up. “And it’s called manners,” he said with an utterly serious face but his eyes, the way they sparkled with mischief and held back laughter, betrayed him.
He flicked his eyes back to the Prophet and attempted to read an article about werewolves in the ministry.  It was supposed to be a scathing exposé about the supposed corruption in the Magical Creatures Department but seeing as it was written by none other than Rita Skeeter, Harry knew to take the article with a grain of salt (or a block of salt, really).  However, he just couldn't seem to focus on the words.  His mind was still going over every encounter he'd had with Malfoy over the past week.  He hadn't had a direct conversation with the man since the very first day, but they'd seen each other in the halls and at meals.  Each time, Malfoy had given him a subtle nod and a small smile, nothing too warm or friendly by most people's standards, but for Malfoy it was downright sunny.  Harry scowled at the thought of a chipper Malfoy, with the blonde hair and wiry form, it reminded him of Luna.  Well that was just great, now he had an image of a Luna-esque Malfoy, wearing her cat spectacles and bright pink and purple jumper while talking about wrackspurts and crumple-horned snorkacks in that low, drawling voice of his.
Draco had to clear his throat a few times before his voice would work properly and even then his affirming 'yes' was still shaky and somewhat gravelly.  Harry's smile widened before he stood up and took Draco's hands, pulling him up as well.  Bringing their bodies flush against one another and wrapping one arm around the blonde's waist, he placed one hand on a pale cheek and guided their lips together once more.  This time, the kiss was slow and gentle, yet still passionate and fuelled by desire. Slowly, Harry began to walk Draco back until the backs of his thighs were pressed against the edge of the desk. Draco moaned loudly as Harry began to roll his hips, grinding their growing erections together. As they rutted against each other, Draco moved his hands to grab Harry's ass and pull him closer, causing the raven-haired boy to groan into the kiss.
"Oh Harry, yes!  Fuck!  Harder, please."  Draco's words were high and breathy as he begged Harry to pound into him harder and faster, moaning loudly when he got his wish, every thrust hitting his prostrate perfectly. "Harry, I'm...nghn...fuck I'm close."
“Why?”
have more than a few choice words for him concerning the breaking of old and "destructive" habits.  Come to think of it, Ron would have a few comments himself on the matter.  Harry clenched his jaw and looked back down at his morning paper.  He had to snap out of this.  So what if Malfoy wasn't the same slimy git as when he was a kid, Harry had grown up too, although he was beginning to question if that was actually accurate.
“Oh I wouldn’t worry about that, Harry.  She seems rather amused with the whole situation.”
“You’re right,” he said breathlessly, as he pulled away from Draco.
By now, Draco was beginning to squirm under Harry's gaze. He could feel those penetrating green eyes as they travelled down his torso, past his hips, and back up again. He swallowed hard, expecting the boy to snipe back at him. Instead, Harry let out another low chuckle and focused his inspection on Draco's face, quirking his brow yet again.
"And I'll owl Draco at ten past six to let him know that Blaise and I will have to cancel."  Pansy replied, a devilish smile tugging at her lips.
Potter was walking along the corridor leading to the professors' lodgings, obviously coming from his rooms, when he suddenly stopped mid stride to stare at the man standing awkwardly at the mouth of the hallway looking rather shocked himself.  All these years, and Draco still couldn't believe how absolutely gorgeous...no, not gorgeous, stupid...Potter looked.  With his stupidly ruffled, raven coloured hair, his doubly stupid emerald green eyes, and his triply stupid golden skin.  It really was quite infuriating.
Of course, when you have been obsessed with someone for seven years, it can be hard to put them out of your mind and simply move on. "Not that I have ever been obsessed with Draco," thought Harry. "I was merely curious as to what he had been doing. I was suspicious, is all. And rightly so. So then why haven't I been able to get him off my mind?" Harry continued to speculate over his habits concerning the Slytherin as he let his eyes rove over Draco's lithe form. With his slender hips and gorgeously tight ass, Draco Malfoy was the epitome of what Harry considered to be sexy. "Wait? Did I just...? No, I'm admiring him. That's all. I find him aesthetically pleasing. I am most certainly not attracted to Draco Malfoy of all people."
"It attacked me! I would hardly call it a 'poor thing', Pans," Draco rolled his eyes and returned his stony gaze to the owl. It merely cocked its head and stared at him with massive eyes. "Ugh, fine. Whatever," he sighed and passed the pesky bird a piece of bacon. It hooted softly, took the offering, and flew off, leaving a smattering of feathers in its wake.  Draco glared after it as a few feathers landed in his oatmeal, thoroughly ruining it. "Damn bird," he muttered as he returned his focus to the paper in his hands, studiously ignoring Blaise's poorly muffled chuckling. The blonde scowled as he unrolled the parchment and began to read the messy writing.
Draco sighed and picked his trunk up, it wouldn't do to dwell on the past, and he needed to get inside before the barrage of students began arriving for the infamous Begin of Term Feast.  He had made a promise to both himself and McGonagall that he would be an outstanding professor, even if that meant bearing the company of his fellow colleagues and his pupils at every feast Hogwarts threw...and he wasn't about the break that promise on his very first day.
"What's wrong?  Are you okay?"  His voice raspy from Draco's dick down his throat and his brows furrowed together in obvious worry.  Draco would've laughed if it hadn't been so damn endearing.
Harry smiled and nodded ever so slightly.  “I promise to come to you whenever I am having doubts.  About anything.  I want to share everything with you, and I am sorry I caused you worry these past weeks.”  Draco smiled back up at him as Harry leaned in once more and sealed the promise with another kiss.
Harry read the note twice before writing out a short reply telling Hermione to get well soon and that both her and Ron would be missed.  With that, he gave the note to her owl and sent him off just in time to look up and see Draco striding towards their customary table with a small scowl marring his gorgeous face.
"So...?"  Draco looked expectantly at Harry, brows raising ever so slightly at the ravenette, who seemed to be lost in thought as he continued to stare at the blonde in front of him, smile still plastered on his face.

“I had hoped I could get by without telling you,” the man across the desk finally said, his voice low with emotion.  “But damn it, Draco, you make it too fucking hard to not say anything.  I mean, look at you!  It’s just not fair and I simply can’t keep doing this.”
"Didn't you hear me shouting for you to wait up?"  Potter looked into Draco's eyes, his viridescent gaze full of worry and a small amount of amusement.  He let out tiny chuckle at Draco's obvious expression of surprise and confusion.  "Look," he started, letting go of Draco's wrist and shoving his hand through his unruly ebony curls.  "I didn't mean to freeze up back there, I was just...well, I was startled is all.  And I didn't know what to say or even how to start.  I mean, it's us.  We've never exactly been the best of friends." Draco let out a delicate snort at this, causing Potter to smirk.  "I guess I was just figuring out what to say, and then you just took off."
"I guess that makes us colleagues, then,"  Draco said tentatively.  He watched as Potter regarded him before nodding curtly.
"Hm?  Oh, right, sorry.  I got caught up in my own thoughts I guess."  He shook his head slightly and took out his wand, shooting a quick
