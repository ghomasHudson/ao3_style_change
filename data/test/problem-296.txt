“All right,” Draco said in resignation. And so he told Potter about the prophecy, from bumping into Trelawney in the hallway back in Fifth Year, to Astoria’s untimely passing, to Myrtle’s rejection.
“I’m no dancer, so my strategy is just to lay myself down and start speaking in tongues like I’m possessed,” Lady Cakes explained. “I’m giving you Country Church Revival Realness, Sugha!”
Draco studied them both. Millicent nodded with a shrug. Granger’s expression, on the other hand, dangerously approached the determination that she usually reserved for liberating house elves, standing up to Death Eaters, and slapping h— no, it was better not to risk her ire.
He looked around the bookstore. “Why, you’re rather bold to be hitting on people as a married man, aren’t you? Isn’t your little wife here? What happened, did she finally run off and leave you?” He winced. He didn’t know what inspired him to say that thought out loud.
,” Lady Cakes told the camera, “then you need some of RuPaul’s Thick-n-Juicy Chicken. It’s sooo good—” she winked, “—just one bite will have you moaning in delight!”
So what do you think of this episode? Other Drag Race thoughts? Holy crap, Widow Von Du brought chocolate cake to the Snatch Game! Is Jackie Cox the Pandora Boxx of Season 12? Did Jan achieve the impossible by being “too much” for RuPaul’s Drag Race? State your opinions in your initial post and then reply to at least three other posts by -- Sorry, eLearning is doing something weird to my brain.
“So, Draco wants to be memorable, does she?” Courtney seethed from under a pound of cake on her face. “Oh, I definitely won’t forget this.”
“Oi, Chicken Thigh!” Weasley guffawed. “Never would have pegged you for a breast man.” Blaise chuckled.
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul appeared in the doorway and entered the werkroom in a teal and purple suit. The queens cheered in greeting.
Crabbe, however, was not perturbed. He positively waggled his eyebrows and floated over to her. He held out his elbow, which she wrapped her hand around.
Out of the corner of her eye, she caught Kali watching them. Kali seemed to be muttering something under his breath but Draco couldn’t make it out.
“Wait in here, please,” she merely said in response, gesturing toward an open door into a small conference room. And then she left.
Acacia was dancing up a storm. By this point, she had already twirled in a giant circle around Draco, death dropped, and landed in the splits.
“For our first trick, I’m going to use our magic wand,” Draco announced. She picked a plastic wand off a table to the side of the stage.
After the episode ended, Draco introduced Harry Gryffindor for his first performance. The crowd roared. Knuts, sickles, and even a few galleons soared onto the stage. To Draco’s utter dismay, Harry Gryffindor was a hit, that bitch.
“Tonight on the runway, I am serving a high-society witch,” Draco explained. “She was caught on her way to the annual Halloween gala at the Ministry of Magic, but there will be no burning at the stake this time! I feel strong, sexy, and powerful in this look. This is pure Draco.”
There were 28 sacred families in Britain who had remained pureblood into the twentieth century; only 25 had survived the last war. Hogwarts had an average class size of 40 per year to represent all of the United Kingdom’s wizarding youth. The Dark Lord, at his most powerful, had commanded 63 Death Eaters and a few dozen other acolytes and wannabes. After the war, the Official Harry Potter Fan Club boasted over 200 fans.
Draco rolled his eyes and took the item, popping it into his mouth. It was horrible. The things he was willing to do to help a friend, honestly. His reaction must have shown on his face because Potter laughed.
Draco pouted. “Can’t you take the day off? Time is of the essence if I’m going to submit my application video by the end of the month.”
“I’ve been having some trouble getting my costume to hold together,” Kali whispered. “Maybe you could take a look at it, and maybe...
“Thank you, candidates,” RuPaul addressed them all. “That concludes our Frock the Vote debate. Remember to come early on Election Day — oh, and don’t forget to vote. Goodnight, everybody!”
Lorena looked like she had bit into a particularly bitter lemon, pursing her lips in resignation. That only left Draco and Goldie.
“And you’ve survived another week, Lorena,” Draco said, intentionally changing the subject before Steve could pick another fight.
After Lady Cakes went back to his room, Draco picked up the letter the owl had delivered and sat down on his bed. The source wasn’t a mystery; Draco had recognized the Malfoy crest on the envelope immediately. He opened it with some trepidation.
After a few minutes of speculation, the large television screen lit up to start RuPaul’s opening message.
“I think you can use that to your advantage,” Warren said. “As someone from another country, you have an outsider’s perspective on the United States. What insights do you have about America that you could talk about in the debate?”
Harry wrapped his arm around Draco’s shoulder comfortingly. “I wish I could have been there with you,” he whispered.
, several wizards and witches had written letters to the editor expressing their disapproval. Draco’s slight reveal about Hogwarts and Slytherin’s view into the Great Lake (and implied Melvin the Pervy Merman) had rankled an older generation that saw any description of magical life — however veiled — as a violation of the Statute of Secrecy.
The next day was Elimination Day. The theme for the runway was Cosplay, the fictional recreations meant to provide a switch from the non-fictional portrayals of the Snatch Game.
Steve-as-Taylor-Swift twirled her hands in the air delicately. “It’s great to be here! Whoo!” she exclaimed at a low, demure volume.
“In this challenge, we are each portraying famous women from the 1990s, and I’m assigned the part of Cher
“I’m afraid you’ll have to settle for the chance to win drag-related gifts or cash prizes instead,” RuPaul replied dryly.
“Honestly, and don’t take this the wrong way, but if I had to choose the bottom two based on what the judges said, and this is just based on that, nothing personal, but I think it would be Lady Cakes and either Steve or Lorena,” she rambled, gesticulating her arms more than necessary.
“I mean,” Potter waved his hand nervously, “I totally get it if it’s too private. You don’t have to share, it’s just that it seems like a lot of other people know about it, so…”
Draco sighed. He pushed his breakfast and tea across the table and gently banged his head against it in frustration.
Bianca laughed. “Honey, everyone is a horrible prat when they’re a kid.” Draco gave her a faint smile. “Look, no one else has your life experiences. But the trick is to take those experiences and find something about them that you can look back on and laugh at. And then make us laugh with you.”
“Oh, do you want us to give a Spice Girls pose, maybe?” Courtney suggested. “You be Posh and I’ll be Baby Spice. Tell me what you want, what you really, really want!”
“Then why did it take them so long? I mean, I was just seven and a quarter then. I’m practically eight now. I could have grown old and died, waiting for this!” He pressed the back of his wrist against his forehead and fell back into another death drop. The Black family's legacy of melodrama had not skipped a generation in Teddy.
“So there we were, five little wankers,” she continued. “And one night, I happened to look up at the window. What did I see? One really massive fish looking in and watching us!” Draco bugged out his eyes and opened and shut her mouth several times in imitation of a fish, trying to make it look as lecherous as possible.
“And once again, we are the sisters of Alpha Beta Gamma Omega Zeta Jones!” Paris added. The audience cheered yet again. The trio struck dramatic poses before sashaying off the stage.
“Well, listen ladies, I cannot wait to see what you bring to the stage. I’ll leave you to it!” And with that, RuPaul walked over to the other team and began asking them questions about their act.
“I love you,” Draco looked directly at the camera with a sultry expression and batted her false eyelashes. “You deserve so much more, luv.”
Venus laughed. “Bitch, how much of a lightweight are you?” she pointed at the empty drink in Kali’s hand.
After the war, he fell in love with Astoria and they had been happy. Astoria had given him several years of joy, as well as a son and heir. When she got sick, he focused so much of his energy on trying to find a way to improve her health that he stopped seeing friends.
On the other side of the room, the hooded figure was still there. Draco tried to ignore it and focused back on the episode.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t know! I just learned how to post and check my number of followers!” He wrung his hands. Then a thought occurred to him. “Wait, Thomas said to check the direct messages.”
“Kali Sister, you are safe.” Kali thanked her and joined the others. “Steve Donovan, you are safe.” Steve’s bottom lip wibbled before she sobbed and walked back. “Intoxia...you are safe.”
Malfoy’s office was not what Harry expected --- full of sunlight, plants, and a small tabletop water fountain in one corner. On one wall he had framed his diploma from Hogwarts as well as another certificate proclaiming him a Certified Accountant of the Wizarding World, Junior Class.
After two days of searching Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, Harry had finally tracked down a box of files related to the house and the Black estate. The estate was apparently somewhere in the Cotswolds and had a small acreage of farmland that had been managed by a wizard named Thomas Pendleton who lived on another piece of farmland nearby.
His eye caught a group of people in front of the doors holding signs. A man on the end held a bright pink sign that read “Draco Malfoy,” and Draco approached him. He was wearing a black T-shirt, cutoff shorts, and the ugliest sandals Draco had ever seen. Even Harry Potter, The Boy Who Most Certainly Never Lived For Fashion, never wore such a ragged ensemble, but the man seemed to be content with himself.
“I’m sad to see Steve go,” Lorena Gucci commented with a sigh as she took off her oversized rhinestone earrings.
“I see you finally found a use for your lucky stick and broom,” Kali winked at Draco. Draco peered around the corner and saw the aurors watching them.
Draco vaguely registered the gasps and cries from the judges in front of her — as well as a few queens behind her — as several people raised their hands and shouted, “WERK!” RuPaul herself had dropped her jaw and bugged out her eyes in shock. Draco herself was in something of a state of shock, and stayed in the splits with her arms out on either side for a few beats, catching her breath, before remembering that she still had more song to lip sync.
“Ladies and Gentlemen, I am Kali Sister, coming to you from Middle America, and if elected, I will be the first South Asian drag queen president of the United States. I will spice up our country with delicious dal curries and hot Bhangra beats. America: go from bland to grand.”
“All that bollocks about Bob Marley’s ghost having to wear chains because of his crimes was utter shite. Do you see
“I think Draco got picked last because she’s the least experienced of any queen here,” Ivana explained to the camera. “I may be older, but I have more performance experience than all of these bitches combined, and they know that. Aside from some acrobatics, there’s no telling what Draco has to offer.”
Potter appeared around the corner and made his way past the woman and her children until the two of them were face to face.
“Very well,” Burbage huffed. “I know of a good muggle theatre in Salisbury we could haunt. Come on, Aura! Put some hustle in your bustle!”
“And then, what do you suppose is the proper thing to do in that situation, when one’s mates are all wanking? Why, wank along in solidarity, of course!”
,” she explained to her specifically. The woman laughed, a little red-faced, but didn’t appear to mind the attention. Draco felt truly fired up now, hearing more laughter.
The old man brought Malfoy up to speed on the issue over another round of tea. Harry tried to concentrate more on his cuppa than on the familiar blond nemesis, who was trying to hide a smirk behind his own cuppa.
Potter and Weasley whipped their heads around fast enough that Draco was surprised they didn’t injure themselves. “WHAT?!” Weasley cried.
“Bored enough to stop by and say hello? I see how I rate, then.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest as he scowled. This was not an auspicious way to start the day.
Lorena huffed and rolled her eyes. “I don’t think I have to worry, either,” she said. “My look was on point, the audience liked my number, and I deserve to stay here...but I can’t say the same about everybody here.”
“Imma let you finish—” Lady-Cakes-as-Nicole-Byer interrupted. “But first I just wanna say that Beyoncé had one of the best answers of
After each pole solo, the queens resumed dancing around each other in a circle and struck a final pose, half of them out of breath.
“This is actually my first time sewing with carpet,” she told them. “I found this old rug in my boyfriend’s attic. It wasn't easy material to work with, mind you, but I’m happy with the way it turned out,” Draco said, smoothing a hand down the narrow sleeve of her jacket.
The others all agreed. The rest of the conversation dissolved into small talk as they changed out of drag, the aches from their heels and tucks setting in as the high energy of Elimination Day waned.
“It was my father who disowned me,” Draco explained, “but my mother — I never expected her to go against him...or even to record a
“Ladies, you all really knew how to work that produce — but two of you really stood out: Steve Donovan and Intoxia Madison!” The queens cheered. Intoxia clapped and Steve curtsied.
Harry could feel the frustration pushing against the edges of his control. “I don’t suppose you could recommend an accountant who is familiar with the property?”
Carmelita wore a black latex catsuit and jacket with short, slicked-back black hair. “You’ve been down
don’t know her as well as I thought, either. I never would have dreamed she would do something like that.”
“Don’t bogart that chicken, baby,” Lady Cakes said, then grabbed two chicken thighs and murmured, “I want your thighs on my face.” She rubbed the pieces of chicken on her face, smearing sauce everywhere, and moaned.
He’d been shocked. He really did respect muggles, of course. He just hadn’t been prepared for the reality of a real, in-the-flesh muggle treating her so condescendingly. Treating her like she wasn’t better than all of them combined.
Lorena and Goldie gave her a pitying look. Draco and the others looked away. They had all seen the contents of Steve’s rack and hadn’t been impressed.
“Condragulations, my queens! Now remember — if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love someone else? Can I get an Amen in here?!”
Teddy jumped up and started tugging the zipper in the back of Draco’s gown. “Wow, this is really tight,” he commented. “Have you gotten fat?”
“Harry, I can’t believe you haven’t been paying your taxes!” Hermione cried in disbelief shortly after Harry flooed to the house she shared with Ron and showed her the letter in a wild-eyed panic.
“I’ve been thinking about your wrists,” Draco said, uncertain how to go about what he was to offer. Too late to back out now. “If you’re interested, I have a salve that might help.” He held up the small tub. “A sort of home remedy, if you will.”
And where did Draco fit into this range of ability? He felt slightly more confident after his workshop with Bruce Vilanch, but as a queen who had never performed before a live audience prior to appearing on
Eventually, the unsafe queens stumbled back into the Untucked lounge and sank into the sofa with their cocktails.
“Winner, winner, chicken dinner,” RuPaul drawled. “Lady Cakes McMansion, Lorena Gucci, Draco— Condragulations, you three are the winners of this challenge.”
The queens danced. The music was available on iTunes. It had become a familiar drill by this point in the competition, one which Draco was glad to continue for another week.
“I may be less experienced as a queen, but I know better than to let someone else take what is meant to be
“Lorena is the type of person to punch down when she knows she’s not doing well,” Draco said. “It helps her feel better about her own performance. What she
, Draco thought. Kali looked up to the lights, then at Draco, and raised his eyebrows questioningly. Draco took a deep breath and held it for a few seconds before letting it out.
Draco replayed the nights events in their head, blushing slightly. They were getting harassed, Harry had come over and saved them, they had a conversation with Harry, they came out to Harry and they kissed Harry on the cheek.
"I'm aromatic, Harry, so I'm not quite sure how to want me to respond to that." Ron deadpanned. "Anyway, who are you not sure about being in love with?"
Draco refocused on the fact that Harry could be all alone right now. Harry hated being alone for long periods of time, he got really scared and anxious, his thoughts became too big and he often had flashbacks to when the Dursley's locked him in the cupboard under the stairs for days on end. Harry had told Draco the reason he was so scared was because he was scared someone would find him and hurt him, like the Dursley's did. Draco can remember his heart breaking when Harry told him this and he remembers holding Harry close to him and telling him 'I'll never leave you alone'.
Harry look at the hand that had been holding Draco's the entire afternoon and wiggled his fingers slightly. His skin felt warm and tingled where Draco had interlocked their fingers with his own. Harry brought his knees up to his chest and placed his chin on his knees, getting lost in his thoughts as he watched Draco.
The two boys could only see each other as they danced. Harry still wasn't the best dancing and stepped on Draco's feet a couple of times but the two just laughed it off. The two stopped dancing and just stood, swaying to the music.
"Every year, since Pansy and I came to Hogwarts, we've done this thing. It's turned into a tradition now but Pansy's going away so we can't do it so I need you to do it with me instead." Draco said, a little embarrassed.
Draco grabbed Harry from his seat and started performing the Heimlich Maneuver. After around 20 seconds, the object lodged in Harry's throat came lose and came flying out of Harry's mouth. Harry collapsed into Draco's arms, coughing. Draco sat him down and got him a glass of water.
Draco's eyes locked with Harry's and Draco couldn't describe what he felt. Looking into those emerald pools, it felt like everything just came at Draco at once. Every emotion came flying at him but few chose to stick, happiness, relief and love.
Harry and Hermione got together later that day to talk about the advert and how much they loved it. Christmas had officially begun.
Pansy just rolled her eyes. The walk to Hogsmeade was uneventful, the two engaging in basic conversation and Draco walking a little faster than usual. As they entered the village, Draco had to slow down to Pansy's pace as he didn't know where the makeup shop was.
The pain was unbearable. It is the sort of pain that burns, as if some invisible flame was being lit inside of Draco. It seared through Draco's abdomen but the worst was when it hit his heart. It felt as if someone had sent a spear straight through the middle of his heart. He felt as his heart broke and shattered into a million pieces across his chest. Draco began to claw at his chest, desperate for the pain the go away. Dark red scratches lay above his heart as if he was trying to rip his heart out.
"I don't care. I love snow and you can't change that." Harry shoved a biscuit in his mouth. "I'm gonna go talk to Draco."
As soon as he reached her, Pansy started studying Draco's face. She reached up and placed a finger just below his eyeliner.
"Are you sure that's a good idea? We nearly burnt the house down last time we tried to bake something." Draco shuddered at the memory
Harry and Draco both wore their Christmas jumpers to Pansy's party and Draco received a lot of compliments about his and every time he got a compliment, Harry just smirked and winked at him.
Harry followed the rest of them, trying to calm himself down. He was just going to a ball. He was just going to a ball with Draco. He was just going to a ball with Draco who still gave Harry butterflies whether he saw him. Well, Harry was fucked.
"No." Harry said firmly as he pressed gentle kisses to the side of Draco's face. "You're not. You're anything but, actually."
Draco had no idea how long he had been running for but he found himself at his and Harry's place. Not their flat but a forest. There was a small forest about a ten minute walk away from Harry and Draco's flat. If you walked into the forest far enough, you would come across a small stream that you could dip your feet in. It was so peaceful and calm. Draco wasn't sure anyone else knew about this place. He and Harry came here every weekend without fail. It was their safe space.
"For the last bloody time, I don't want to ask anyone to the bloody ball." Harry sighed, exasperated.
It wasn't until Draco had reached the far corner of the graveyard that he spotted the graves. Draco felt oddly lost as he stood in front of the graves. He knelt down and used his wand to place a wreath of flowers by each grave. After he had finished, Draco didn't stand up, he just stayed kneeling on the floor.
Draco fired a locking spell at the door before crossing his arms and facing Harry. Harry glanced at Draco, his gaze flicking over every part of his body. Harry looked away, mentally trying to pull himself together.
He opened Harry's contact and scrolled through the messages Draco had sent over the past few days. Draco had found his coping method, he liked to send Harry texts and voicemails. He has no idea if Harry is able to read the texts or listen to the voicemails and he knows there will be no reply but just knowing that Draco and sent them made him feel slightly at ease.
Jesus Christ, chat? Chat? A chat is what you did when you went for afternoon fucking tea, not when you're reporting a missing person.
Draco sat down on the sofa and out his hand to his head. What was so bad about not wanting to wear a Christmas jumper? There's too much colour on them, they're so bright and it's like they demand attention. Draco got interrupted from his thoughts when the door opened quietly.
Draco was nervous, not because of the party, but because of the small velvet box he kept touching in his pocket. As soon as the has got the invitation to Hermione and Ron's Christmas dinner, Draco thought that it would be the perfect time, but now Draco was here, he wasn't to sure. Would Harry want a big scene? Probably.
Their petty argument continued as Draco changed out of their clothes and into an old t-shirt and jumped into the bed and slid up close to Harry's side.
And as Draco's feelings for Harry grew stronger and stronger, so did his feelings for makeup. He always wore his eyeliner and lipstick at any chance he got. Draco found himself watching intently when anyone around him put makeup on and he always made excuses to be in Pansy's room in the morning when she was applying her makeup. He wanted to learn about it so he knew how to do it when he could get his hands on some more.
Draco watched his friends converse. He was hanging onto every word they said. Usually, he'd zone out of conversations but today he desperate to hear something, anything, to reassure him that they felt the amount of pain he felt right now but Draco wasn't even sure if it was possible for anyone to feel the level of pain he felt.
"Oh, yeah. Cool, yeah." Harry said, awkwardly. He wasn't really expecting that reaction from Ron, he was almost expecting Ron to freak out because he and Draco had never exactly been the best of friends.
Draco sat down and sighed. This promise was all he could think about and Draco couldn't understand why he was getting so worked up over a promise. He needed to push away this feeling that he was making an empty promise but he had no idea how to do that. He could just not promise it anymore but then it would become a broken promise and the thought of that seemed so much more painful to Draco. He could actually say the promise out loud to somebody and promise them that he was going to find Harry but he didn't have anyone to tell. Yes, he had all of his friends but they didn't seem like the right people to make the promise to. Draco needed to make that promise to someone who needed it, to someone who was so helpless in this situation, but he simply had no idea who he could tell.
Everyone else in the common room was quietly watching the conversation between the two boys. Well, they were mainly listening to Harry because sassy Harry was the best Harry.
Draco was met with silence. No one knew what to say but, then again, what were you supposed to say in this situation?
Draco was honestly stuck on how to get some more makeup until Pansy had mentioned something about a makeup store in Hogsmeade. It was only a passing comment but it was enough to drive Draco's imagination wild. He couldn't help but wonder what the inside of a makeup shop looked like, all the palettes and tubes lined up. There would be so many things to choose from as well. Draco knew he needed to visit this makeup shop.
It was more than crying, it was the kind of desolate sobbing that comes from a person drained of all hope. Draco's body wracked with an onslaught of sobs, tears and screams. The screams ripped themselves out of Draco's body as the sound of wailing and suffering echoed throughout the flat.
Hermione had made the best Christmas dinner ever. The turkey was cooked to perfection, and the potatoes were roasted amazingly. Everything was perfect. Lots of crackers were pulled, Harry winning none. He stole Draco's paper crown though and placed it on top of his messy curls. After dinner, presents were opened from each other. Lots of hugs and 'thank yous' were shared.
Draco, Harry and Hermione say in the sofa while Ron, Pansy and Blaise sat on the floor. They spent most of the morning listening to christmas songs and opening presents for each other and their family. Harry and Ron were wearing their Weasley Jumpers. Ron's was blue with a black R and Harry's was red with a yellow H. Ron had one present by his side all morning but no-one asked about it. Finally, when everyone had finished opening all their present and exchanging hugs and kisses, Ron brought the present onto his lap.
Ron sighed but got into place without another word. Ron simply didn't like apparating, Harry however, had never dealt with it very well due to the fact that he either threw up or passed out nearly every time he apparated. Harry felt his palms become slightly damp with nerves and Hermione softened her gaze and looked at Harry.
"Ginny, Luna, George, Neville, Pansy and Blaise. We're just waiting on Seamus and Dean to arrive." Hermione replied.
"Sure buddy, you keep telling yourself that." Harry stood up and ruffled Ron's hair earning a slap on the arm. "Rude. Anyway, to answer your earlier question, probably 2:15 to get to 'Mione's for 2:30. That gives us enough time either way."
Draco sniffled as they pressed their face into the crook of Harry's neck. "I don't know." They whispered as they clutched onto Harry's shirt.
Harry held it up and watched Malfoy apply the eyeliner with practiced ease. It was so mesmerising watching the black liquid begin to frame his eyes. Harry knew his mouth was forming a small 'o'shape but there was nothing he could do to stop it.
Draco woke to the sound of his alarm. Bloody hell, he hated that alarm. He opened his eyes but immediately closing them after the light literally blinded him. He stretched his arms above his head and flopped one to the other side of the bed. The impact of arm on sheets surprised Draco and he opened his eyes. He looked over to the vacant space on the bed and sat up.
"Draco." Pansy suddenly said, making him jump. "Why the fuck didn't you tell me you could do makeup? Like, this is amazing, where did you learn how to do it? Do you realise how many hours of conversation we've missed out on? This is literally the best thing that has ever happened to me."
Draco couldn't put up with it anymore. Pansy's voice was beginning to sound like nails on a chalkboard that never fucking ended. At this point, Draco was seriously considering avarda kedavraing himself because anything would be better than Pansy pestering twenty four fucking seven.
Harry's eyes widened and a brief look of shock and hurt passed through them. Harry remained silent as he took Draco's hand and led them to the mirror in their bedroom.
"That'll teach you to never throw another snowball at me again. Ever." Draco said, before turning to walk away, holding his hand out for Harry to take.
"Of course we won't know for sure until the patient confirms it but all the signs are pointing towards it." The paramedics voice was laced with sympathy.
"What are you? My mother?" Draco asked, moving the cushions off the sofa as they heard Harry getting the food.
It was confusing, to say the least, not knowing who you are. Everyday Draco's head was screaming at them 'this is not who you are', over and over. Always being labelled a boy, everyone always using he and him. It made Draco hate the world along with themselves.
It was christmas time in their final year at Hogwarts. Hermione had managed to convince Harry, Ron and Draco to come back to complete their final year and they were all thankful that they came back. Christmas at Hogwarts was as beautiful as ever. The tree in the great hall seemed even more magnificent than the previous years. Stars, baubles, snowflakes, tinsel and lights were delicately placed on the tree to make it look perfect and an angel sat at the very top of the tree. The ceiling of the great hall was charmed to make it look as if it was snowing and decorations were spread all around Hogwarts. Christmas was a truly magical holiday at Hogwarts.
Both Harry and Draco shrugged, waiting for Ron to catch on, shooting each other an amused but also mildly concerned glance when he didn't get it after a couple of seconds. It was only when Hermione opened the door and pressed a kiss to Pansy's lips did Ron finally seem to understand, stopping dead in the hallway with his mouth hanging open.
Draco went on to show Harry all the notes. At first, Harry was awful, he pressed all the wrong keys and created a horrendous sound but by the end Harry had kind of got it. It went extra messy when he tried to add in the left hand. The two spent hours at the piano. It was one of the most magical things Harry had ever experienced; he was there with the boy he loved and they were having fun. They didn't have to worry about getting caught by anyone. After listening to Draco play
Harry walked over to the fire place and prepared it. Once it was prepared, he stuck his head into the fire.
The rest of the walk to the apartment was filled with light conversation. Harry was so glad that both Ron and Hermione so easily accepted Draco and held no grudge against them for their school days. It was a welcoming and refreshing reminder of just how amazing his friends were and just how lucky Harry was to have them in his life.
"Go. I can't stand to be bullied in my own home anymore." A teasing smile made its way onto Ron's face. "Have fun."
Draco sighed. It wasn't just a plausible suggestion, it was a perfect suggestion because it made sense. Draco had never considered this before but now it had been said, it made sense. Draco seriously underestimated Ron sometimes. But, just because it made sense, it didn't bring them any closer to figuring out who took Harry. Draco couldn't think of anyone who would kidnap Harry. Draco didn't think any of them had an evil bone in their body. Their friendship group consisted of Harry, Draco, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Dean, Seamus, Ginny, Pansy and Blaise and they were all so close. Draco didn't want to believe that maybe one of them had taken his Harry.
Draco checked again that no one was around before walking up to a mirror and pulling out the eyeliner and package that contained the lipstick. He quickly put the eyeliner on with ease, looking flawless as always, before gently opening the package, revealing a black tube that was thicker than the eyeliner with gold writing on it. He opened it carefully, a soft click echoed around the room. He placed the lid on the ceramic sink before twisting the tube and watching the lipstick rise. The colour was stunning. A deep, rich red that looked like velvet.
Draco caught that. The first thing that he caught of the conversation was the question that made him want to scream whenever he asked himself it. The thought if it alone made Draco want to cry because what if Harry never came back to him? Draco wouldn't know what to do with himself, he would be lost, Draco didn't think he'd actually know how to live.
The two filled the air with their usual jokes as they walked to Draco's apartment. Harry was insanely excited to see Draco in the dress. Actually, Harry thought, he was more excited to see how Draco felt wearing the dress. Harry longed to see the sparkle in Draco's eyes when they were truly happy.
"Draco, where the fuck are you?" The voice got closer to where they were sitting. Draco groaned into Harry's lap.
"Well, not if you don't burn the first two batches and have butter explode all over your microwave." Harry grinned sheepishly.
Draco pulled the material out of the box and placed it delicately against themselves as they walked over to the mirror. Draco could almost see the twinkle in their own eyes as they took in what they were holding. The Strawberry Dress designed by Lirika Matoshi.
The dress flowed down their body perfectly and fell to halfway down their lower leg. The deep v neck accentuated their collar bones and their pale skin complimented the pale pink colour perfectly. The string like belt pulled them in perfectly at the waist and Harry would be lying to himself if he said he had seen something more beautiful that Draco in the dress.
Why would anyone love them? They wore skirts and dresses, they painted their nails and wore make up. Draco scoffed bitterly to themselves, they did all of those things yet society would never perceive them as anything but a boy. Draco couldn't help but think it was pointless, who were they even doing it for anyway? Themselves? No, they didn't deserve that much.
"Let's just go and buy some. I give up with baking. This is the second time we've nearly burnt the house down."
tw: homophobia, mentions of physical and emotional abuse, mentions of rape and sexual abuse, mentions of depression, anxiety, PTSD and anorexia, mentions of homelessness, mentions of suicide and self-harm
Harry's self-harm got a lot worse too. All of his old scars were covered with fresh cuts and burns. Draco had all the lighters, matches and razors in the house to try and help Harry stop but he couldn't prevent Harry from going out and buying his own. There was several times when Draco found Harry in the bathroom, blood dripping down his arms and waist and tears dripping down his face. Draco carefully tended to every cut, cleaning them and bandaging them so they wouldn't get infected and he always made sure Harry felt love and cared for afterwards.
He groaned into his pillow. Tonight seemed so far away, he just wanted to see Draco again. He was so fucked but he didn't care one bit. All Harry could do was feverishly await the evenings arrival.
Once the two were back in their flat, Harry put the calendars next to each other in the kitchen and sat down on the sofa next to Draco.
Harry woke up in the middle of the night due to a nightmare. He knew he wouldn't be able to get back to sleep so he decided to go for a walk around the castle. He did this quite often, he nearly got caught by a few teachers his first time so from then on, he wore his invisibility cloak. Harry tried to be as quiet as possible as he crept out of his dorm and out of the Gryffindor common room.
Draco stood up after ending his call with Luna and made his way out of the forest and headed towards Seamus's flat. Draco kept telling himself that it was nothing and Seamus had probably been really busy because after all, Seamus had no reason to kidnap Harry, right?
"Right, can I go please? I'm going to be late because of you wrestling me to the ground over Christmas socks." Draco asked, a little annoyed.
Draco's knees buckled from underneath him as he fell to the floor cradling his Harry. All of his emotions were overtaking him. He let out a choked sob and buried his head in Harry's chest. Draco finally felt like everything was going to be alright. His Harry was finally home.
As Harry approached Draco's apartment block, he found the blonde just leaving the building. As Draco walked towards him, Harry felt the blood waking up his brain, even though he already thought he was awake. His smile grew of its own accord and Harry didn't want to hide what Draco ignited. Draco could easily become the most fun thing in Harry's world.
Every nerve in Harry's body burned with the desire to do something because he couldn't concentrate on anything else but Malfoy. He knew he would have to wait until tomorrow though and the wait seemed painfully long. Harry wondered if he was putting on the eyeliner and lipstick now, did he have anymore makeup?
"Draco, I've called Ginny, Luna, Neville, Dean, Seamus, Pansy, Blaise, everyone and they all said he's not with them." Hermione said, running her hands through her hair.
Harry and Draco spent the rest of the day together before parting their separate ways to go to their dorms. Harry went to sleep praying it would snow overnight.
"Shit, Seamus. You're gonna make me cry. Thank you, that's means a lot to me." Harry said, trying hard not to cry.
Ron had been like this all week, pestering Harry about who he was going to ask to the ball. Harry was at his wits end now, he was struggling to put up with Ron's whining and bitching about how Harry's 'so boring because there has to be at least one person he liked'. Even Hermione couldn't help, or more like wouldn't. When Harry first denied he wasn't going to and hadn't asked anyone to the ball, Hermione just rolled her eyes and said 'sure' before walking off and ever since then, she's looked at Harry with a knowing glint in her eyes.
"Hello. Where did you come from, eh?" Draco took off his scarf and wrapped the shaking puppy in it. "Gosh, you must be freezing. I haven't seen any missing posters, you must be a stray. Well, I can't just leave you here can I? No, you'll have to come home with me. My Harry has been asking for a puppy for ages. You know what, I'll take you to the vets and then to a pet shop. I'll get you everything you need and I'll take you home to Harry. Sound like a plan?" Draco said to the puppy.
"Yep. Neville took us all here when it first opened and I thought it would be fun." Harry smiled at the slight sound of wonder in Draco's voice
"I'm sorry Dray. I didn't mean to worry you. This is going to sound like the shittiest excuse but I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry." Harry wrapped his arms around Draco.
Draco stubbornly turned away from the mirror, not willing to let themselves see them look like that. They took a deep breath and tried to clear their head and heart of fuzziness. Draco took their clothes off and quickly glanced in the mirror. They had always appreciated their body shape, long and slender, lightly defined by muscle.
Draco stared at the three in disbelief. He couldn't take it anymore. He couldn't stand being in the presence of these sick people anymore. Draco turned away and walked out of the house and slammed the door behind him. As soon as the door had shut, Draco ran.
"Not bad." Draco took another bite from the cookie, which admittedly, was actually quite nice. "You've improved. You'll be ready for the Great British Bake Off soon."
"I feel like I've been forced into a situation I don't want to be in and there's no way out. It's like being forced to get the dark mark again. I was trapped, there was no way out, I had no choice. This feels like that all over again but worse because then, I had people who could help. They could've gotten me out of the situation if they wanted to but now, I'm completely helpless and I don't know what to do anymore." Draco said.
The two had been together for a month, and very early on, the topic of Voldemort and the war came up. They had had a long conversation about Voldemort and the war and how it had affected them but they had come to the conclusion that it was okay to make jokes about it, but the minute either of them felt uncomfortable, they would stop.
Draco heard a crack of twigs above him and immediately opened his eyes. He searched for the cause of the sound and his eyes landed on a little rabbit. He smiled softly, Harry loved rabbits and it never failed to make him smile when he saw one running around the forest.
"Of course." Vernon said. His voice matched his looks, obnoxiously posh and his accent obviously over exaggerated.
Draco had decided to go home for Christmas in his 8th year to keep his mother company and see how she was doing. Draco had pondered over whether he should go home or stay at Hogwarts with his boyfriend, Harry Potter. Harry was actually the one to push him to go home for Christmas. Draco knew he had to see his mother at some point but he wasn't too sure about going back so soon after school had started. He had spent all summer away from the manor and many people thought that Draco couldn't wait to go back but, actually, Draco was a bit scared to go back. So many bad memories were held in that house, but Draco had to go back to see his mother.
And Harry Potter had protected them from a creep. And he had accepted them. And it happened all in a gay bar, which meant that Harry was in the LGBTQ+ community. And that fact filled Draco with hope, they had always had a crush on Harry during Hogwarts, not that they'd ever admit that allowed. Well, not to anyone but Pansy.
Harry and Draco spent the rest of the evening watching Netflix. Draco went to bed very excited for the next morning. When Harry woke up the next morning, he was very surprised to find Draco not lying next to him. He wandered into the kitchen to find Draco opening his calendar.
Draco pushed back the curtain of the fitting room and stepped out, standing in front of Harry. Draco spun on their heel and saw that Harry's mouth was open slightly, a light pink dusting his cheeks.
Before Draco payed, he picked up several brushes, some setting spray and some makeup remover. Draco swung his bag happily as he left the shop and met up with Pansy who was waiting outside. Pansy looked him over, looking suspicious.
Draco was waiting for around 30 seconds before he saw Harry. His breath was taken away, Harry looked stunning. He was dressed in jet black dress robes and his curl looked adorable. Harry reached the bottom of the stairs.
"You were right when you said the earlier ones were better." Draco said, when the compilation ended.
Soon enough, the pair were the only ones left skating around the rink. It felt like they were in their own little world where they could both be who they wanted to be without fear of judgement. Words didn't need to be spoken at that moment, there was no need.
Draco nodded his head before turning back to Harry. Tears were streaming down his face. "Please do something baby. Anything. I need you to wake up. Please Harry. Please. Just something. Please. Please. Please."
When the two pulled away, Draco pressed a kiss to his cheek and when Draco did that, Harry felt like he was going to melt into a puddle of emotions and affection because he loved Draco
Hermione walked back in holding two cups of tea. She handed one to Draco before sitting back down on the sofa. Draco took a small sip before placing the mug down on the coffee table.
Draco and Neville went their separate ways on the floor. Draco got to Harry's room. It was at the very end. He slowly pushed open the door and saw the same sight he saw every day. Harry, his love, laying there, eyes closed.
Draco just let out a breath of amusement before leaning down and pressing a kiss to Harry's lips causing him to break out into a smile despite wanting to maintain the angry façade.
"Best Christmas ever." Draco said, whilst running his hands through Harry's hair. The two were disturbed by shouting.
The person was too perfect. Their smile was soft with a hint of femininity, their bone structure was delicate and sharp. Harry let his eyes linger for just a lot longer than was customary. The person turned their head and locked eyes with Harry, their gaze unguarded and calm. Their eyes were a beautiful steely silver colour and for a fleeting moment, recognition flooded through Harry. It was faint but it was there.
Draco nodded before being pulled into a hug by Ron. Draco returned the hug and felt a single tear roll down his cheek. Draco pulled away and stepped into the fireplace. They took the Floo to the ministry, it was the fastest way.
When they had finished doing that, Draco set the Christmas pudding to steam. He lounged around for the rest of the day, filling the pot up with water when needed. By the time the pudding had finished steaming, Draco was ready to go to bed. He hadn't started making it until mid afternoon so it was quite late by the time it was cooked. Draco got ready for bed and jumped in next to Harry who had gone up around half an hour earlier.
“Don’t be ridiculous, I’m all right. See?” She stood up and walked around the table before sitting back down. “My legs healed up just fine. I know Ron is holding a grudge, but I’m not. I chose to be there, you didn’t force me to do anything.”
A/N: This chapter is mainly flashbacks and graphic content (abuse, CSA (child sexual abuse), self-harm, suicide attempt). Do not read if it will trigger you. You can skip this chapter and not miss out on information, as everything covered here will be covered in later chapters in a briefer way. My inbox is always open for those who need to talk.
The goblin at the main desk, Ragnok, grumpily showed them to the cart that would take them down to Harry’s vault before passing them off to Griphook. The cart ride was as nauseating and exhilarating as Harry remembered it, and they were out of the bank before Harry knew it. The goblins certainly knew how to get wizards in and out as fast as possible, likely due to their dislike of them.
The morning came quite quickly, and Harry found himself waking at the crack of dawn. Hedwig was pecking around the bottom of her cage, trying to find any scraps of salvageable food. The house was silent, aside from Vernon snoring down the hall. Harry’s door had been left unlocked for the night, which was an oddity, but considering Arthur Weasley’s impending arrival, it made sense. Harry dressed himself in some of his cleaner clothing before making his way downstairs to cook breakfast. All he had to do was prepare a decent meal and stay out of their way, and soon enough he’d be out of Privet Drive until next year.
Harry blinked slowly, the light of the infirmary hurting his head. Wincing, he sat up and looked around. His eyes fell on Draco, who was still curled up asleep in his chair. Draco’s head was rested on his knees and one arm was lazily wrapped around his legs, and the other laid at his side, his fingertips resting on the edge of Harry’s bed. Memories of what had happened the previous night played through Harry’s head and he moved his gaze to his arm, which was now heavily bandaged, probably to prevent Harry from slowing the healing process. He sighed and laid back down. “You didn’t have to stay, you know.” He said to Draco, knowing Draco was still sleeping. There was no reply from Draco obviously, but Harry was bored of the Infirmary already. He sat up again and poked Draco on the forehead. Draco made a small sound of irritation. “Wake up!” Harry whined, poking Draco again. He didn’t really know why he was waking Draco up, he just knew he was bored and he needed to talk to someone, anyone before he started to feel the crushing coldness that he felt on most days. Draco blinked and straightened up in his chair, stretching a bit to ease the soreness from sleeping at an odd angle. “Good, you’re awake. Now I have someone to talk to.” Harry stated, turning to Draco and sitting with his legs crossed.
“C’mon Harry, you can room with me and Fred, since Ron is being an idiot.” George said gently, lifting Harry’s trunk and owl cage. Fred nodded and linked arms with Harry to Apparate them back to the twins’ room. Harry smiled gratefully and with a pop, the three of them were in the twins’ room. George set Harry’s things down, while Fred went over to the small couch they had placed near their window and unfolded it to make it a guest bed for Harry to sleep in. “Sorry about Ron, I don’t know what’s gotten into him.” George stated, his usual cheerfulness gone.
I ended a friendship with my former best friend in August 2019. It wasn't a healthy friendship and it needed to happen, but it affected me deeply and it was hard to use the internet without getting panicky for a while, since we had been internet friends.
“I only followed because I thought Sirius was actually in danger! All I had to go off of was your stupid vision which turned out to be fake! Ginny could have lost the use of her legs! I could have lost my arms! But all you care about is Sirius! Wake up, Potter, he’s
Draco sank to his knees on the grave, his umbrella and bouquet of roses falling to the ground as well and he leaned against the gravestone, sobs racking through his body.
“I thought I told you to keep that bloody bird quiet! We take you in, out of the goodness in our hearts, and you repay us with your absolute
The next day, Molly woke them all up bright and early to head into Diagon Alley to shop for school supplies. They Flooed over to The Leaky Cauldron for a quick breakfast before starting their long day of shopping. Fred and George tagged along, mostly just to bug their mother all day long while she tried to keep Ron and Ginny on their best behaviour.
His things had already been packed up, not that he ever unpacked at the Dursleys’. His trunk sat in the cupboard under the stairs with all of his school supplies, Hedwig remained in her cage in his room, and he had a small, worn backpack filled with clothes that were less disgusting than the rest. His backpack was shoved in the bottom of his wardrobe, hidden away from Vernon who would surely tear it apart if he saw it, just for the hell of it. Knowing that he was all set to depart in the morning, and that Vernon was done tormenting him for the night, Harry curled up on his bed and fell into a dreamless sleep.
“And do tell me, what am I playing at? Because I sure as hell don’t know.” Harry replied, his voice quiet and hoarse.
Draco grabbed his coat and an umbrella from next to the door and rushed out of his flat, not even bothering to open the umbrella. In his left hand was a bouquet of roses, which he had purchased the night before, knowing today he’d not have the strength to do anything other than visit Harry.
“You said you didn’t want to take it, right? So, why did you have to?” Harry asked, inching closer to Draco. Harry knew nothing on how to comfort someone, but it was clear that Draco needed some comforting.
In the bathroom, Harry inspected his injuries from Vernon. They were healing somewhat decently, the bruises fading from the bright purple to a nasty yellow-green. However, the parts of his back that had been dug into with a belt buckle weren’t faring so well. A few of them looked infected, and all of them were puffy and red. He finally let out the breath he had been holding, momentarily releasing the tension in his body. Quidditch had been fun and freeing, but all of his muscles had been already aching and that certainly hadn’t helped them any. He tugged on his clean trousers and was just about to finish pulling his clean shirt over the last bruise when Ginny barged into the bathroom. He flinched, and quickly crossed his arms over himself.
“Go on. You’ve probably heard some pretty horrible things about my life, share something of yours.” Harry prodded.
That evening passed by in a blur for Harry. There was so much chatting and more chatting that Harry felt his throat would surely give out before everyone was ready to retire for the night. It seemed as though all the Weasleys were overcompensating for Ron’s rude behaviour. He caught Ginny’s eyes from across the living room while they were all relaxing on the worn furniture, although she quickly turned away when Ron elbowed her in the ribs. Feeling a little disappointed that he couldn’t even talk to Ginny, he politely excused himself from the living room and made his way up to the twins’s bedroom, where a cot had been set up for him. After changing into his pajamas and brushing his teeth, he crawled into his bed and pulled the soft, hand-crocheted blanket up to his chin. Breathing in the comforting scent of the Weasleys’ home; the smell of fresh baking, cinnamon scented cleaning products, and happiness, he fell into a deep, peaceful sleep. He was so exhausted that he hadn’t noticed Ginny pop her head into the room on her way upstairs, a sad and curious expression on her face. The twins came up to their room shortly after, whispering amongst themselves. Soon, everyone had slipped off to bed, and the sound of a soft breeze could be heard through the drafty house, as well as an owl hooting, which may have been Errol, Pigwidgeon, or Hedwig.
Times like this gave Harry the opportunity to really think. And whenever he did think, it always seemed to cause an unusual feeling that Harry couldn’t really place. It was like a bitterly cold chill was seeping through his body, deep in his bones. It was unnerving, to say the least. As Harry laid on his bed, he thought of Sirius who had died mere months ago. Harry had witnessed it, Harry had seen Sirius fall through The Veil. He shuddered to think about it. That night in the Department of Mysteries had not only hurt him, but had hurt his friends too. Ginny had been severely injured, and Ron would suffer permanent scarring. Ron was understandably pissed at Harry, but he still wished his best friend would come around. He had received letters from Ginny and Mrs. Weasley, but he hadn’t gotten anything from either Ron or Hermione. He had hoped that Hermione would still try to stay in contact even if Ron was upset, but it seemed that she was sticking to Ron’s side throughout this. Harry didn’t know what to do. The Weasleys had arranged for him to come spend the last week of summer vacation with them, but if Ron was still angry with him, he could only imagine how painfully awkward the week would be. Still, he had agreed to go, and even if Ron hated his guts and didn’t want to speak to him, it would still be better than staying at the Dursleys’. Swallowing hard to get rid of the lump in his throat, Harry rolled over and pulled his worn, scratchy blanket over himself.
No one truly knew Draco was hurting this badly. Pansy and Blaise had their suspicions, but they never pressed him for information.
“Coming!” Harry yelled back, scampering down the stairs and into the living room. Vernon turned to face him, lowering the volume of the TV so he wouldn’t have to shout.
“Well? Nothing to say? That’s what I thought.” Ron laid back down on his bed, opening up his Quidditch magazine and resuming it where he had left off. Harry bit the inside of his cheek and left the room, closing the door behind him. He took a shaky breath, subconsciously noticing that the conversation downstairs had come to halt. Twin pops came from either side of him and he found himself squished between Fred and George, both wearing identical expressions of confusion. They looped their arms through Harry’s and began walking down the stairs.
“It’s nothing, I swear. I just couldn’t let her out with everything that’s been going on, you know, with the Death Eater sightings and all. Hedwig is too distinct. My uncle just wanted to make sure she would stay in, so we’d all be safe.” Harry knew he was rambling, but it didn’t matter. It was a bullshit excuse and he was sure Molly could see right through it, but instead she sighed and nodded.
“Even if I was… upset with you for saving me last night, I…” Harry paused, looking down, “Thank you.” He mumbled.
“Ron hasn’t been writing? That’s quite out of character.” Arthur mused, and the car lapsed back into silence.
woooo bad chapter aleRt i'm tired asf and i just can't get my ideas written correctly please don't be cruel to me
“Well now that that is sorted I’m going to pee. I’ll be right back.” Draco said lightly as he exited the room.
For the first couple of months after Harry’s death, Draco had convinced himself that he was dreaming, and that it had all been a terrible nightmare. He’d spend hours trying various ways to ‘wake up’, wanting to finally escape this endless nightmare.
The rain was only drizzling for now, but the muggle weatherman had predicted it to be raining horribly by late morning, and as much as Draco didn’t want to be out in the rain, he couldn’t bear the thought of staying inside today.
“Surely you wish to say goodbye to your nephew? You aren’t going to see him until next summer,” Arthur tilted his head curiously, peering behind Petunia to look at Vernon.
“I’m going to go get the necessary potions from Severus, you’re free to stay if you wish. I’ll expand the curtains, so another bed will fit in here.” And with that, Pomfrey left, and Draco was vaguely aware of the curtains expanding. Harry was fast asleep, and Draco didn’t want to be alone with his thoughts, so he did the only thing he could think of. He pulled his legs up into the chair with him and fell asleep.
Harry nodded, and hoped that she understood his silent ‘thank you’ before snatching a dinner roll and running up the stairs as fast as he could. He could hear them all settling down at the table to eat and he breathed a sigh of relief as he tore his roll in half. He pushed one half of it into Hedwig’s cage, and despite the fact that it wasn’t her usual food, she devoured it within a few seconds of it being given to her. Harry, on the other hand, tore his piece into smaller bites and ate slowly, savouring the small bit of food he had been given. The roll was warm and soft, and Harry felt as if he could eat at least twenty of them. The roll didn’t really alleviate any of the hunger Harry had been feeling, but he still felt better after eating it nonetheless. He laid down on his bed after he finished eating, staring up at the ceiling.
“So, moving past your little pity session, I’m dating Dean. Don’t make that face at me!” Ginny cried, giving Harry a soft smack to the shoulder. “I don’t know if I really like him anymore though.”
“No, I don’t think I will. You see, we’re all alone here, and I can finally teach you a lesson.” Ron practically purred at him, his sneer turning into a malicious smirk. Harry did the one thing he could think to do, he opened his mouth and screamed as loud as humanely possible. Ron released one of the hands on Harry’s robes to clamp it over Harry’s mouth, stifling the scream somewhat, although the scream still could be heard to those nearby. Ron shoved Harry to the ground and pinned him down, pulling his wand from his pocket and aiming at Harry.
“Of course I believe it! Harry has been fooling us all for too long!” Ron stated harshly. Fred and George looked at him with disgust.
A few hours passed, and Petunia and Vernon returned home from their date and movie. Vernon came stomping in, grumbling about traffic and having to pay for their outing. Petunia followed behind him, carrying a large purse and their lunch leftovers. They moved to the living room and the TV was turned on, blaring loud golf commentary. Harry winced as the loud noise reached his room, it was only a matter of time before he would be called down for chores. His whole body ached from the yardwork he did the day before, any movement he made increased the aching. Sure enough, not even ten minutes after the TV was switched on, a loud yell came from downstairs. “Boy! Get down here!” Vernon shouted, his bellow nearly shaking the house.
After breakfast, Harry would scurry off to put on some clean clothes, usually right as the twins and Ron were coming down the steps to the kitchen. Harry usually did his best to avoid Ron, but one morning Ron elbowed him right in the ribs, where a pretty nasty bruise from Vernon was healing. It took all of Harry’s strength to keep from groaning in pain, his ribs screaming from the impact. He could hear Ron snickering as he walked away. Harry grit his teeth and continued up the stairs, on a mission to change out of his pajamas and not make a big fuss out of things.
“I’m just putting him in his place for betraying the Light.” Ron scowled. Harry simply shook his head and shrunk further back, not wanting Ron to explode again.
The rain poured down on Draco and he stood at the grave, his mind going blank, forgetting what to do. It was always so hard to see Harry’s grave.
A/N: The next chapter is going to contain graphic flashbacks and graphic self-harm / suicide attempt, so you may skip that chapter, since everything covered in it will be covered in a lighter way in the chapters after. I was going to put off it for longer, but I’m impatient and this needs to happen. Everything will probably come off as very cliché, but I’m trying my best so bear with me. I couldn’t write Neville to be bad, so I made him do what he did. I’m debating between having Dean or Seamus be kind to Harry, but I can’t decide which of them it should be. It’d be unrealistic to have them both be kind, seeing as the majority of his house believes the article/won’t go against Ron, so now I’m stuck debating between who I like better. Comment who you think it should be! It would help me a lot. I’m also adding in a total word count for each chapter (the total of all the words in the book, not total of the chapter).
“I like girls. And guys, I guess, but I think I like a girl right now.” Ginny blurted, the tips of her ears tinging pink.
“Sorry, dear. I had to leave them off while you were healing.” Pomfrey said, helping Harry out of bed after he had dressed. Harry wobbled a bit since his legs hadn’t been used for a couple days, but once he regained his balance, they set off for their new room.
Soon, the day was over, and Harry was back in the Room of Requirement. He stared at himself in the mirror. A feeling of despair crashed down on him and his face contorted as he tried to stifle the sob that rose in his throat. What was the point of continuing to be the Boy Who Lived, the savior, the person who the Light was relying on, if his life was going to continue to go downhill? What was the point of any of this, if he was just going to be shunned, alone? He realized at that moment what he wanted to do. He was going to finally give the Dursley’s what they wanted, he was going to stop being Dumbledore’s pawn, he was going to end his existence.
Harry jumped awake at exactly 4:30 in the morning in a cold sweat. The dream had been one of his relatives, but the details of what had happened escaped him. He stifled the cry that rose in his throat as he scrambled out of bed and began rummaging through the dresser drawers for his school robes. He snatched them up quickly and made his way to the shared bathroom, locking both doors and turning on the shower. He undressed rapidly and practically flung himself into the shower, finally let his cries out as the sound of the running shower would mask them. He leaned against the shower wall as his body shook and the warm water ran over him. He eventually sank to the floor of the shower and curled up, sobbing. The water ran over his face and blended with his tears. After what seemed like ages, he pulled himself together and stood, shampooing his hair and washing his body. He got out and dressed in his robes which were slightly wrinkled from sitting in a pile for several days. He didn’t bother doing anything with his hair. After brushing his teeth, he unlocked the bathroom doors and went back into his room. His school bag, a simple beige bag that was to be carried across one’s shoulder, laid on the floor at the foot of his bed and he snapped it up, checking it briefly to make sure all his books were in there. Once he was sure he had everything he needed for the day, he grabbed his wand from his nightstand and left both his bedroom, and the small room that the two boys had been gifted. He wasn’t sure where he was going, just that he needed to walk around for a bit to clear his head.
A small Harry, who looked to be around six years old, was cowering in the corner of a rather smelly cupboard. Outside of the cupboard, a large man began unlocking the many locks that decorated the outside of the cupboard. Vernon threw the door open and grabbed Harry by his left leg, flinging him out of the cupboard and against the wall behind him. Harry crumpled to the floor, whimpering. “Boy! What did I say about not breaking things?!” Vernon shouted, towering over Harry, his belt clutched in one hand.
“I haven’t heard from Ron. I wrote to Mrs. Weasley and Ginny, though, but they sent Errol and I was worried about working him too hard.” Harry replied truthfully.
” Vernon shouted, never mind the fact that he was angry about Hedwig being loud at night. Harry knew better than to talk back, especially as Vernon raised his free hand and landed a harsh slap to the side of his face. Harry’s cheek stung but he clenched his jaw to keep from making a single sound, still forced to make eye contact with Vernon. Vernon landed another strong blow to the side of Harry’s face, making his vision blur slightly. Vernon jerkily released Harry’s chin, before shoving him back hard enough to slam his head against the wall, resulting in a rather dull thud. Harry closed his eyes instinctively.
Well, I guess I should tell you all everything that's new and life-y! I'll just make a list since a lot can happen in a year (whoops, I'll try not to go so long without updating :') )
“Erm…” Draco didn’t know what to say. He had one major secret that seemed fair to tell since he knew such personal things about Harry, but he knew that telling Harry would probably not go over so well.
At around seven in the morning, Draco awoke as bright light from a nearby window shone on his face. He slowly eased out of bed and got himself ready for the day, making sure he looked as elegant as always. He peeked through the shared bathroom into Harry’s room and noted that he wasn’t in bed. Draco shrugged to himself, perhaps Harry had gotten up early and was just hanging out in the sitting area working on his missed work or reading a book. When Draco checked the sitting area and found it empty, an uneasy feeling settled over him. Surely Harry wouldn’t just leave? After rushing through both Harry’s room and the sitting area looking for any note Harry might have left about where he went, and finding no note anywhere, Draco sprinted out the door and down the hallway. He could barely think straight, all that was playing through his mind was finding Harry on top of the tower several nights before.
“Oh, I’ve been fine, but let’s get going now. Molly is preparing a nice meal to celebrate your arrival!” Mr. Weasley said, picking up Harry’s trunk and lugging it out to what appeared to be a rental car. Harry followed, carrying Hedwig’s cage. Mr. Weasley gestured to the passenger door. “Hop in, Harry.” He said cheerfully as he hopped in on the driver’s side. Harry got in and held Hedwig’s cage on his lap, sitting stiffly. “So, Mr. Weasley, how is Ron? I haven’t heard much from him this summer.” Harry asked after a rather long and awkward silence.
The article went on to provide theories for how Harry was linked to the Dark Side, all of which made Harry increasingly angry. “You seriously believe this, Ron? It’s written by Skeeter! You know how that woman is!” Harry shouted, unable to contain his anger and hurt.
Harry slid one leg up onto the edge, his whole body shaking. ‘I have to do this,’ Harry thought, pulling his other leg up onto the edge, so he was now kneeling on the edge. Blood dripped down his cut arm, his cuts stinging as his robes brushed against them. The blood loss made his malnourished body feel shaky and weak, and he felt extremely lightheaded. He was just about to throw himself off when strong arms grabbed him from behind and pulled him off the edge. Harry struggled against the arms. “Get off me! Go away! You saw nothing!” Harry hissed.
Draco wished for the day he could visit Harry without crying. He knew Harry wouldn’t want him to be so torn up, but he felt as if his heart had been torn out and put in a blender.
“Don’t be so sure about that.” Harry managed to gasp out between laughs. Draco’s eyes widened, and Harry froze, realizing what he said. ‘Shit, shit, shit, he’s going to get up and leave now!’ Harry thought, panicked.
The memories faded from view as Harry screamed awake, tears streaming down his face. He sat up, pulling his knees to his chest and rocking back and forth, a steady stream of tears coursing down his face. He checked his watch. 6:30 am. He didn’t have enough time to go back to sleep, even if he wanted to. He stood and grabbed a clean set of robes from his trunk before going to the bathroom and turning on the shower. Merlin, he felt so dirty. The memory of that day when he was nine stuck in his mind as he showered, making him shudder with disgust. He got out of the shower and dressed quickly, making sure to avoid his reflection in the mirror before getting dressed. He hated the sight of himself without clothing, it always triggered more memories of incidents with his uncle. He pushed his memories aside and began thinking about his classes for the day. He had double Potions with the Slytherins in the morning, then in the afternoon he had Charms and Transfiguration.
Heya! Sorry it's taken me so long to update. This chapter is super convoluted, but I wanted to add a chapter between Harry arriving at the Burrow and the train ride to school. There's a loooooot of dialogue in this chapter, which is a pretty weak spot in my writing, and I feel like I made the characters OOC (which is understandable because it's fanfiction and their lives are really different here than in canon, but still). It's gonna take a while to build up to Drarry, but I hope you all will stick around! I love getting comments and criticism, but please be respectful! I'm trying my best here :'). Life-y updates at the end notes as per usual, they'll probably be super ramble-y and weird. For some reason, the last time I updated the ending note got stacked with the one from the previous chapter, so I don't know what's up with that but I am a total noob at this site, despite being here for a year or two now.
“I d-didn’t mean to!” Harry cried, gasping and covering his mouth as he realized he had back-talked.
Little did Harry know, he had been followed. Not the whole way of course, but someone had seen him as he drew near to the tower. Draco Malfoy had seen Harry walking towards the tower and decided to follow him. ‘Maybe he’s meeting with a girl! Maybe that’s why he was acting so weird on the train!’ Draco thought. ‘Or a guy.’ He added quickly, almost hopefully. Draco counted to ten before following Harry, making sure he wasn’t spotted. He went up the steps after Harry extremely slowly, knowing the steps were prone to creaking. Once he got to the top of the steps, he crouched in the shadows next to a bookcase of Astronomy books. He watched as Harry wrote the note. ‘Weird,’ Draco thought, ‘I wonder who he’s writing to.’ Harry rolled the parchment up and slipped it into his robes pocket, which confused Draco even further. ‘What is he doing?’ Draco thought. The moonlight illuminated the tower and Draco could see how dull Harry’s eyes were, although Draco convinced himself that he was seeing things. Harry was fine, right? The Boy Who Lived had every reason to be happy, right? Draco watched in utter confusion as Harry raised his wand to his wrist. His stomach twisted as he heard Harry mumble a cutting spell. Harry winced at the pain, but he repeated the action at least a dozen times, until blood was dripping off his arm onto the floor of the tower. Steady tears fell down Harry’s face, and in his head, he could hear Vernon screaming insults at him. ‘Useless. Worthless. Freak. Whore.’ The list went on and on, and Harry became desperate to get the horrible, insulting voice out of his head. Draco was frozen in his hiding spot, he had no idea what to do. Draco closed his eyes and counted to ten, steading himself. When he opened his eyes, Harry has discarded his wand to the floor of the tower and was now leaning over the edge of the tower, swaying slightly. Draco snapped out of his shock and stood slowly, doing his best to not startle Harry.
Draco found Harry’s grave and stood there, swaying, as all of his emotions crashed down on him at once.
“You deserve this for what you did at the zoo today.” Vernon took a pocket knife out and began carving a word into Harry’s skin, which Harry would later find out was the word ‘worthless’.
Draco rolled the scroll back up and pocketed it. He had to admit, he was impressed with how bold Harry had ended the note, but his worry for Harry’s mental health soon overtook any bit of impressment he had. Pomfrey had said he had more injuries than just the self-harm, which brought Draco to one conclusion. Abuse. He decided not to think about it until Pomfrey confirmed anything. And at that exact moment, Pomfrey stepped around the curtain, a somber expression on her face.
” He smirked at her. “... Was that how Hermione would have reacted?” He added quietly after a moment.
Blaise x Seamus (I haven’t seen this ship before, but something tells me it would work? Let me know what you think of this pairing)
The door swung open and Harry swallowed, his entire body tense as he tried to hide his fear. Vernon stood in the doorway, his face purple with rage. Harry huddled in the corner of the mattress, making himself as small as possible. Vernon stomped over and jerked Harry’s head up by his chin, forcing Harry to look at his face.
“Sorry, Draco, so sorry, worthless, useless, stupid, waste of space, freak, burden, whore, queer…” Harry rambled on, his voice shaking. He wasn’t sure why he apologized to Draco first, but then again, he was barely there at the moment. He was aware of Draco in the room, but in his mind he was stuck in the place that caused him the most pain. He curled in on himself, pulling his knees to his chest and tucking his head down. Harry’s shoulders shook as he tried his hardest not to fall completely apart. Draco slipped off of the armchair and sat down next to Harry, wrapping his arms around him protectively. Harry stiffened at first, but soon relaxed, although he continued to shake. “Harry, it’s okay now. I’m not going to let anyone hurt you.” Draco said soothingly, running a hand through Harry’s hair and holding Harry close to him. He continued to quietly reassure Harry for what seemed like hours, before Harry finally fell asleep, still looking extremely troubled. Draco scooped Harry up and carried him to Harry’s room and tucked him into his bed, lingering for just a moment to study Harry’s features. He shook his head and mentally slapped himself for the strange fluttery feeling he got from looking at Harry. Now was simply not the time to have anything other than platonic feelings for Harry. Draco made his way back out to their little sitting area and plopped down on the couch, thoroughly confused with his feelings. Right as he was about to doze off, there was a rather loud knock at the portrait.
