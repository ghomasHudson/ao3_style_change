He didn't much believe in divination or psychics who claimed to see the future. But he had come to believe that the future could be made better than the past. All he had to do was keep living. Keep taking steps forward. And inch by inch he’d carved himself a new life; one he was proud of even if it wasn’t glamorous or what people expected of him. He could handle the way people still looked at him with distrust because he knew his own intentions. He knew what he wanted. He had his own place now, still had his mother and his few but true friends. So he could appreciate that this was perhaps just how Potter comforted his own friends. He did seem to want friendship at least. Even if it ended with this case Draco decided that it would be enough for him. He would take what happiness he could get - even if his heart would always twinge with regret. And now he just wondered how to disentangle himself without waking the other man. Potter so rarely slept enough these days (a fault of his own as well) and Draco didn’t want to wake him when he was finally getting some rest. Though he did immediately miss the warmth, just the warmth he told himself, when he got up to see what he could do about breakfast.
Beth let out another snort, quieter this time, and raised a thick brow at him,
Fluff!
Draco’s thoughts had wandered back to his previous partner as he’d made the trek back to the apartment. Eldreda hadn’t deserved to die like that. Why couldn’t she have just had him accompany her that night? Why had she not trusted him? And now she was dead. She was dead and he still hadn’t caught her killer. Draco let out another heavy sigh as he collapsed into his desk chair, hand wrapping around the comfortable weight of his pocket watch. Did he even want to know the answers anymore? He took out the old silver heirloom and stared down at its face, the only answer he got and it made no sense to him. The time is not yet right.
“He was planning to kill Dumbledore! I was watching him! For evil behavior! He was a wizard fascist!”
Harry groaned and put his head in his hands. “Can’t we go back to babies? Please?”
“A what?” Remus asked.

Blaise and Draco exchanged a look.
Malfoy was in his armchair.
She rolled her eyes and squeezed his hand three times. Their silent I love you. He squeezed hers back.
“Oh, no, I’m good,” they said, brandishing an Irn-Bru. Hermione pulled a face at that drink choice but like, Harry was an adult who could rot their teeth out of their head if they wanted.
“Why don’t you do something from that American show you watch with the er, roses, or—” Sirius waved his hand in the air.
“Moony, I’m going to die, you have to apply the kiss of life,” Sirius moaned weakly. “Quickly, or you’ll be a widower.”
“Well, you know,” Florian said as he paused before opening the door. “It’s a Fortescue’s sworn duty to keep a Potter in ice cream.”
“But anyway, I talked about the ideas I’ve been having about the book. Draco gasped and was like, that’s why my dad hated Dumbledore. Because like, really, people don’t get that upset about school policies or whatever.”
“Yes, that.”
“I assume you two are not currently on good terms.”
“Wait, wait, do a spell now,” Harry said, suddenly curious.
encouragement, which was the closest thing to electricity he’d come up with—Harry finished drawing a diagram of a computer on the blackboard for his afternoon class and pulled down a map of Britain just seconds before a giggling mob of fifteen-year-olds streamed into his classroom.
“YES?” he yelled back, and she grinned in the kitchen. He used to come back into the room and, almost as though he was being puppeted, recite, “Pardon, I missed what you were saying. Please repeat it?”
Draco waved his hand.
Anyway, thought you might have some thoughts (I write songs, believe it or not), given the dope legal work you did on the elf contracts. And the vampire stuff, and the giants, and … well, your entire career, basically. Undoing the bad magic laws, that’s our girl. Sorry, that’s our learned professor.
“Sorry,” he said. “It sticks. I should have warned you.”
“Think about what?” Harry gasped, sliding back into the room.
With a sigh, Draco opened the floor to questions from the audience.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Harry said. “My dad’s family came here after Partition.”
“I didn’t see a dog before,” Harry said.
“Zabini?”
⚬ ???!?!!??
Harry grunted and gestured to the box. Malfoy flipped open the case, found the interior snaps holding the snitch, unclipped them, and held it in between two long fingers.
“No worries, mate,” Neville said. He squeezed Blaise’s gloved hand, wrangled their conjoined hands into his pocket, then held out his other arm to Draco. “Let’s go.”
“And you go around telling people that I ruined your O.W.L.s!” Remus gasped.
He was left tapping his fingers along the table as the rest of the faculty and staff filed into the headmaster’s office and gathered their tea things. The room was filled with a gentle hum of chat.
Arthur waited a moment, then said slowly, “He was just a boy, it’s true. Even if he could have made better choices.”
none of which were work-appropriate.
“Look, Har, I’m not trying to like, cut you out of something. The kids at the castle definitely aren’t the target here.”
“I’m sorry,” Malfoy was saying, “I didn’t mean to be culturally insensitive about the—”
There was a silence, broken only by the now-muffled sounds from the pitch.
Malfoy wouldn’t stop laughing. It wasn’t the screechy, evil cackle of his teen years. But it kept going and going, ringing in Harry’s ears until he yelled, “Shut up, Malfoy! It’s not funny. I’m much better than you at Quidditch. Shut up.”
“The bathroom you’ll have to use is the one down the hall, but since my bedroom is on the ground floor, we won’t have to fight over it. And now I need a cup of tea.”
1:18 pm, July 25, 2007
loooooooooollllllllllllll
Malfoy let go again.
“It didn’t work. They gave him the Kiss anyway. They were going to send me to Azkaban, but my mother still had some pull in the Ministry.” He let out a broken laugh. “They exiled my mother and I for five years. I still don’t know what she did, not really, to get that outcome. I doubt it was strictly legal.” Malfoy was staring down at their limbs.
“Honestly, Potter, your face. It’s so easy to rile you up.”
Then she shook it out again.
Draco’s head shot up.
“Oh, yes, so my older brother Jacob had disappeared before I got to Hogwarts. He’d somehow got entangled with the Cursed Vaults,” she paused, but neither Harry nor Draco gave any sign of recognition, “you know, secret chambers filled with big nasties to guard various Hogwarts treasures.” She took another look at them but nothing rang any bells.
Harry found that his face was wet again.
Narcissa blinked. She’d forgotten this was Andromeda’s house. How was it that Andromeda could see her son and she couldn’t? Lucius had fucked everything up. Everything.
He wedged himself onto the bed.
Perry almost jumped out of his seat. He pulled on one of his blonde curls and stuttered, “Uh, he, we, Shakespeare?”
“Probably,” Draco said with a short laugh. “He was fucking stupid. And I never understood what happened to his nose.”
Draco tilted his head. “I don’t remember Andromeda saying we would be having company for dinner.”
Another cup of tea was certainly in order.
) that did little to settle the welter of conflicting emotions in Harry’s mind.
There was some good dirt in there, somewhere.
“Oh, no, no, not like that, I didn't mean it like that,” Sirius wailed and dropped to his knees. “You’re part of the family, Kreacher.” He threw his arms around Kreacher and hugged him tightly. There was a sniff.
Talbott considered this for a moment, and then shrugged. “So,” he said casually, “I’ll kill either of you if you mention it to anyone,” and Harry felt the magical air shift around the couch, and he knew it was some variant of an unbreakable vow. Talbott’s red eyes bored into him.
“Ah, mate, she’s off on the American tour right now. Won’t be back until May.”
Draco scowled. “It’s close enough.”
“Our students are expected to know the ins and outs of Muggle life. The arts. The culture. High and low,” Harry said and pulled Malfoy’s chair back. “This type of dance is common in Muggle dancing establishments, known colloquially as ‘clubs.’ An important part of Muggle social life is an event called ‘clubbing,’ in which a group of Muggles gather to drink and dance to music like this—” he raised a finger and conjured a CD player. He set it down on the table, thumped it twice.
Pomona pressed her knuckles against her mouth. This was all too absurd.
“Oh, good, why not hop to that, then.”

“No,” he said evenly. “I get my wand back today.”
“I assume so,” Narcissa said, running her finger over the alchemical runes. “Well, not entirely. I think it’s an elongated, inverted version of the original contract ceremony. They didn’t want to make it easy to break.”

“Alright, Bourne,” Malfoy said. “See you Monday for double period. Make sure you proofread your essay this time. Don’t distract from your good ideas with spelling errors.” Harry rolled his eyes but didn’t miss Bourne’s timid look of admiration.
He didn’t need them, no, but he sure as hell wanted them.
She looked down at her tea and waited for Harry to respond.
─────── ⎎ ───────
“I am,” Draco admitted with a shaky breath, “starting small.”
Malfoy didn’t appear on the walk to the grounds. He still wasn’t there when the captains shook hands or when Andre blew the first whistle.
Draco murmured a drying spell towards Harry’s sleeve and gave Pansy a look. Harry was still a bit shaken from her threat and was trying to avoid eye contact with the tiny, terrifying woman.
Andy dropped her knitting. Shit, shit, shit, Draco was dying, someone had broken in and attacked him—she got up, then fell over the basket of yarn at her feet—when Draco burst into the room, brandishing a letter.
and put his hands on Draco’s waist. There was a little sound from Draco, one that Harry didn’t really understand, but he was trying to concentrate on following the leg movements and didn’t really have much brainpower to untangle how Draco smelled vaguely woody and clean at the same time. He hoped he wasn’t holding on too hard.
“It’s not meant to be for two adults,” Harry hissed back. “You can’t walk that fast.”
“I thought you were trying to be kinder,” Harry shot back. “Anyway, come to mine after dinner.”
“It’s just some Arithmancy,” he said. “Modified with a calculating charm and a nanoparticle cloud, based on one of Chang’s latest articles—”
“I ended up writing my dissertation on the varied sexualities and genders of the
It was all there in black and white.

“It’s air,” she said. “Shared breath. A kiss.”
“Ah,” said Malfoy with a raised eyebrow, “It tends to be more literal in the wizarding world. When one says ass,” he gestured with one hand, his silver ring glinting in the sunlight, “one tends to mean it.”
Malfoy slid the cufflink out of his left sleeve. He folded the crisp white fabric neatly and rotated his hand, laying his forearm bare. The Mark was blackish-blue.
“I GOT IN I GOT IN,” he yelled, handed her the letter, then bounced around the room.
But, more excitingly, Neville might have a boyfriend.
“It was not, you uptight bi—”
“What?” Neville demanded.
This was very collegial.
idk thought u would want 2 kno
Neville blushed to the roots of his hair. It was less blond now, but that happened to some people. It hadn’t happened to her.
“Non-magical person,” Hermione said.
Neville and Draco appeared to reach some kind of conclusion, or at least Neville did, because he put one hand on Draco’s arm and propelled him further into the room.
“You’re fucking kidding.” Andy was staring at the risotto, not moving.
Even though his face was glowing, Harry felt a tingle of ice down his back.
“You—what—nude—” Malfoy was sputtering now. His pale skin was flushed from his cheeks all the way down to the tight black collar encircling his neck.
But he still wasn’t sure what Draco’s whispered words had meant, or why he was avoiding him.
“You don’t know what they’ll say until you ask.”
“Oh, no, mate,” Florian said with a shake of his head. “I don’t fuck with that anymore.”
─────── ⎎ ───────
And Claude Oliver-Winger. Harry was too drunk to deal with a violet-eyed, grey-haired twelve-year-old who didn’t believe in inside voices, could recite every Hogwarts rule back to front so he could defy the spirit but not the letter, and knew more secret passageways than anyone without the Marauders’ Map. Oliver-Winger was a handful. And there were three more, he’d heard. Something to look forward to in the coming years.
Draco nodded. “I did my er, community service, with him.”
He blinked up at her and asked, “Astoria?”
“I’m not a dog, Ronald,” Harry said.
And now they weren’t kids.
Harry broke out in a sweat. Had he had a nightmare?
“The noted creature comforts of Azkaban?”
“Nothing,” he said.
“Give off, Malfoy,” Harry said. He could barely see out of his fogged glasses. “I’ve won! You haven’t even touched the snitch. We’re on the ground and I have the snitch. I won.”
“I was in exile.” Without his eyes leaving Harry’s, he continued in a toneless voice. “I did everything my father wanted. Everything.”
Anyway, this means that we are at a stalemate of stolen possessions where each owes the other nothing, unless, of course, you prefer the coconut, in which case I suppose I could return it to you.
“Don’t worry,” Harry said, “I’ll brush my teeth after.”
“Hello—”
Pansy looked over at Harry and rolled her eyes. “Fine, Potter, you too. I apologize.” She turned to Draco and shrugged a little, as if to say, there, I did it.
The spoon stopped.
Draco huffed. “Fine, Potter, maybe a concerned parent who just happens to be a cat burglar took it and they’ll throw this cursed necklace at me in the Great Hall.” He still didn’t seem terribly bothered.
“It’s a stupid, foolhardy plan, Potter.”
it’s coconut shy, not shy coconuts, nerd. i don't know if u can act high and mighty about games u tried so hard to splat the rat. also i actually have a strong emotional attachment to that coconut, so i’d really prefer it to a bottle of mass-produced spirit. you could return it to me on the 28 when u come to me and nev’s birthday which starts at 7 at the spoons just around the corner from diagon alley.
. He grabbed the map and spread it out on his desk.
“Oh, sorry, were you close to him?”
He blinked.
Malfoy looked at the ceiling.
So much for acting normal around Malfoy.
“Malfoy,” Lavender said. “I’m a medium. You can believe me or not, but I know how to read the emotional valences of objects.”
“And stickies!”

“She’ll do antidotes first,” Draco said with a faint smile. “I told her that’s where she shouldn’t start.”
“Ah, yes,” Kreacher said, “
Draco had gotten that tight, shut-in look to his face again. “Potter, I really think we should talk about this cupboard business, or you should talk to someone about it.”
Harry nodded. He could barely hear his own thoughts.
“Sorry,” he said. “This window sticks.”

Hermione rolled her eyes at him and lifted her feet into his lap. He raised an eyebrow, which meant after I finish my tea, but he owed her a foot massage now, and she was going to collect.
“Ok, Dr. Lupin,” Harry said and rolled their eyes.
He shook his head, and his eyes overflowed.
Draco was sticking the note to Harry’s desk and peeling it off, his expression gleeful.
“Pity,” Draco said, “I’d have liked to see Potter break out in boils.”
“Ugh, don’t therapy me,” Harry said around the biscuit remnants.
“How’re ye supposed to sit in that, Harry?” Hagrid boomed out. “What are you? A dirty Quaffle?”

“We have a whole unit on Shakespeare because the Muggles think he was a Muggle, but there are some recent theories that he may have been a Squib, so—” she broke off as Britney Smith elbowed her in the side. “Britney!” she hissed. “We did! We just learned this!”
“You just have to find uh, a better spell. Then Ginny won’t mind. It’s the, uh,” Neville gestured with one hand and dropped a banana chip on the ground. “Wounds.”
“Technically it’s Ms. Black,” Narcissa said, hating herself before the words were out of her mouth. But any small error might compromise Draco’s life—if what Sirius had written had any ounce of truth in it, that is.
“Oh, please, my apologies,” Andy said, stirring faster and faster. “Carry on, milord.”
“Good morning,” she said and strode to the end of the classroom, where Filius used to stand on his pile of books. She looked at them, then turned to face her students. “As many of you know, Professor Flitwick had a heart attack after last night’s welcome feast.” There were hushed murmurs. They already knew this, but fourth years

Kreacher has preserved hair from all members of the family in a scrapbook, so don’t think you’re safe.
Malfoy's lips twist into that awful smirk that Harry hates, and he knows even before Malfoy speaks that it's going to be something awful. "Now, what would Dumbledore say if he heard you speak like that? Aren't you meant to be his staunchest defender? His prized golden boy, the muggle champion, the bastion of goodness we should all aspire to?"
"Are you an idiot?" Malfoy asks. "And yes, that's a rhetorical question. I know you are."
"Nothing," Harry tears his eyes away. "We need to make a plan and stop arguing."
"This is
Harry continues, unperturbed by the insult. Frankly, it'd be more unusual if Snape
"So Dumbledore wants me dead, while you're trying to save my life. What a world."
"Then you know a way to get it out?" Harry asks, eyebrow raised in clear scepticism.
Draco hums, apparently happy to have got yet another good shot in. "Mhm, Beauxbatons, the other school on the absolute bottom rung of wizarding institutions, and Durmstrang, who the ministry had to practically bribe into attending. What about the other schools? Have you even ever heard of them?"
"If I was going to harm you, I'd have done it while you were still asleep, fool child!"
but no doubt Snape isn't going to deem it necessary to answer. Still, he can't help himself from arguing. Five years of an incredible contrary teacher student relationship isn't easy to combat, after all.
"I'm not here on Order business," Snape says simply, as if that explains why he's at Privet Drive in the middle of the night in Summer Holidays. "But we have somewhere to be, and like I said before,
end the Dark Lord. The Prophecy names you as the one Chosen to defeat him? Become worthy of it!"
"Explain," he says, unwilling to wait even a second more. "Explain or I'm going back to Privet Drive." It's clear that Snape isn't trying to harm him in any way, but this need for secrecy, even from the Order of the Phoenix and especially from Dumbledore, has his guts churning with nervous suspicion.
You think people are fighting this war for
"Right then, Africa," Harry agrees. "I'll take your word for it."
Malfoy looks at him with challenge in his eyes, but Harry has no idea why. "Obviously. I don't want to live like a muggle, either."
"What did he even say to you?" Malfoy asks. He sounds serious, but then he turns with his usual asshole smirk painted on his pointy face. "I mean really, how did he figure out a way to make the so called hero want to run off with his tail tucked between his legs?"
"Well, staying in Britain is

At least by leaving it would give him the chance to study, to find a way to get Voldemort out of his head and kill him without sacrificing his life in the process.
Still, Harry has something he wants to ask.
Harry does his best to shout a retort, but all that comes out is a muffled whine. Still, he does his best to glare holes into Snape's face, for all the good it does. The fact that Snape has a point burns him up all the more.
Harry stresses. "I really don't want to go anywhere with either of you."
"Just go and book in to a room for the night, and I will explain everything."

All the heat is gone from Snape's voice when he answers. "Professor Dumbledore has accepted what he thinks must be—that you must die for the Dark Lord to be defeated."
decision in this scenario. No matter what he chooses, this war is going to continue, and he's going to have to fight it. This way at least gives him the chance to come back prepared. If he has to put up with Malfoy for a while, so be it.
The realization makes Harry want to reach for his wand again, but he swallows the urge. Dumbledore has been lying to Harry since he was eleven years old, and his trust in the old headmaster is at an all time low. Besides, some instinctive part of Harry realizes that attacking Snape is the wrong move to make. Like he'd said, if Snape wanted to hurt him, then this is the strangest, most roundabout way of doing so.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow in what looks like genuine disbelief. "You really
Harry rolls his eyes and looks pointedly away.
"And here I thought we were having such a good time," Malfoy drawls. He's still looking out the window, and his tone is sullen and depressed. "Today's a real dream come true."
More than arriving in his room in the middle of the night, more than hiding things from Dumbledore, Snape wanting Harry to get
"Severus," Malfoy says. His voice cracks. As soon as Snape turns towards him, Malfoy hugs him, wrapping his arms around the Professor in a display of affection Harry didn't think Malfoy capable of. "If I don't see you again—"
Bill parted the wall of humans in front of their couch. Fleur made a confused face at him, because who knew what the fuck any of this was about, so Bill settled down on Harry’s other side.
Standing at the counter, Harry rubbed his eyes. He’d really passed out there. He smiled awkwardly at Starr as they waited for Draco to pick something.
⭑ true of Astoria, but ?
. Draco Malfoy was written below in block capitals. It was about five hundred pages and weighed almost a stone. Harry flipped it open, saw the miniscule font and a table with numbers in it, and shut it immediately.
We celebrated our fourth anniversary in
“What? No,” Andromeda said. She was completely at fucking sea now and wished that nice little sociatrix was here. She always seemed to know what to say. “Sirius isn’t a werewolf.”
Harry laughed. “Nev’s been out of his shell for a while.”
“Half credit, but only if you want to get a house with a yard for the dog.”
Thirteen minutes in, just as Perry announced a second goal for Hufflepuff, “And they’ve really got legs, this Puff team, well, they’ve really got brooms, anyway, yes, thank you for the correction, Justin—” Malfoy appeared at his side, sweaty and a bit disheveled. His cheeks were pink from the cold breeze, and an emerald-and-yellow scarf hung around his neck.
“What? What?” Ron hissed. “Are you using legilimency?”
“Yeah, see, exactly, like, he gets like that, too. Apparently.”
I’ll ask Andy if I can bring you over to my apartment so I can show you on the computer. Explaining it in writing would take too long.

Astoria slipped the iPod out of his hand and scrolled through the playlists.
“I don’t want to go,” Neville said, and suddenly his large hands were on Blaise’s shoulders, kneading away the tension.
It was strange, he thought. Four months knowing this new Draco Malfoy. He’d been snarky, sure, cocksure, prickly, and defensive, but he was also good with kids, firm but encouraging, put thought into his Christmas presents, had written Harry a fucking novel and brought him information about his family he’d never known—
At that, Malfoy burst into laughter. The high, bright peal pressed against Bastian’s charm and he shot them a dire look. Minerva shot another spell at the two of them without turning around.
Re: Re: Electronic Mail
She couldn’t keep his schedule straight. There was the non-magical class, some other thing about being anti-blood purity, the thing with Neville. She knew she should be properly tracking all this shit, but he still couldn’t leave the house unaccompanied and he didn’t even have a wand.

Susan Bones ripped her eyes away from the letter and blinked at her girlfriend.
There was a crunch on the gravel behind her.
Malfoy, mouth filled with sandwich, motioned to one of the chairs. Harry sat down and stretched his hands out to the crackling blaze. He continued his visual perambulation, tallying family photographs (one of him and Narcissa on a beach, the other him holding Teddy’s hand in a garden somewhere), Slytherin paraphernalia (a scarf, some kind of plaque, a small silver cup, and, most intriguing, a stuffed snake on the bed), clothes (all over the floor—how did he always look so pressed?), the absolute state of his desk (teetering with papers, it almost gave Harry vertigo), the pots and bottles cluttering the top of his dresser, the broom propped in the corner (was that a Firebolt?), the open closet door spilling even more robes into the room (how many clothes could one person own?), the several handwritten letters and cards tacked to his full-length mirror.
Harry nodded. “Or stuff like, I was talking about how Dumbledore was gay and maybe that was why we vibed—”
“Some people think it’s a soulmate thing,” Dr. Grimke said, and handed Cho the box of tissues.
She removed the sunglasses and slowly blinked her perfectly-lined eyes at him. 	“Where’s Draco?”
She raised an eyebrow. “He’s coming to the middle of nowhere to see you. You. And do sexual things to and with you. I hardly think the decor is going to be high on his list of desires.

She swallowed and said, “You know, they only talk to each other in English. She yells at us in Hindi, but my dad’s family speaks mostly Marathi. They met in English class at uni. My dad brought her snacks every day until she said she’d go on a date with him. She always told us make a man work for you. I mean, turns out neither of us wanted a man, but—"
“Like flamenco!” Filius cried. “Or salsa!”
Yes. 3.
Draco studied her face. “Is it?”
“That’s alright. Your presence is enough.” She said it with the same cadence as her mother.
And. Of course. Of course it would be the Lovers.
“Fuck off, Malfoy.” This was back to where Harry was comfortable, this prickly, obscure Draco who made vague half-claims and vindictive threats. Just like he had when he was a teenager. Malfoy whirled around.

Harry narrowed his eyes and shook his head. “You have a crush on Addie, Padma, and that doesn’t excuse the rest of them. Well, Khan is fine. He’s older. He’s also not white or a pureblood, so he’s practically guaranteed to be at least half decent. But Malfoy—”
“It’s not allowed,” Ollie agreed and squeezed one of her pudgy feet.
Harry stared at Ron. “I’m a civilian?!”
Neville turned a little towards Draco, who seemed to be rooted to the spot and was just blinking in their general direction.
He didn’t want to sit with that thought. And what that thought implied. And how Malfoy’s bottom lip was caught in his teeth, and the way his hair glowed in the soft purple light, and how his eyelashes were so clear and long. He was too fucking pretty, ok. It was enough to do anyone’s head in.
Draco shook his head at her a tiny bit, his eyes on the side of Pembroke’s face.

“See?”
Ron couldn’t breathe. They were chewing. Still.
For some reason, this irritated Harry. He wanted to say something cutting, but then he remembered the mission of Operation Sandwich, which was to see if Malfoy was alright (he was) and perhaps ask for forgiveness (which didn’t seem like such a pressing issue anymore).
“Susan is stable,” Bertram said. “We don’t know if it’s safe for you to see her, though.”
He stopped moving and glanced at her. “Er, should I not have?”

“Go on, girl, go to Hermione and Ron’s.” Ulula blinked, pushed her head under his hand, and left after she’d been given a few scratches.
It doesn’t seem like it’s going to provoke some kind of violent crisis or negative backsliding, as he seems more confused than anything else, but I would love to be able to provide Draco more resources about the topic. Or if you wanted to bring it up after class or reach out to him, but in a calm, low-key way—he’s still quite fragile in many ways. I know he didn’t get off to the greatest start in RNMWC, and I thoroughly appreciate you being willing to give him another chance.
Malfoy had paused midway through Patrick’s tirade and met Harry’s eyes.
Hermione herded Malfoy into the kitchen.
He felt particularly daring at the sudden flash of Jason’s smile, so he bumped his knee against his under the table and was rewarded with another grin.
He glanced over at Draco, who had settled back into the couch in a pose quite different than his usual rigid posture. Draco’s hair glinted in the firelight, and he was watching the sleeping dogs with a look of—wait, was that jealousy?
Draco shrugged. “Maybe I don’t want to pass.”
“Potter, if that’s like a waltz, I am a drunk Erumpent.” But this lacked the crisp retort of a Malfoy insult, and he seemed a bit dreamy as he let go of Harry’s shoulders.
He spun on his heel and stormed out of the classroom. His robes billowed behind him. Should Harry tell him he was becoming a bit Snape-like in his old age? No, no, better to leave that as future ammunition. Well, future ammunition for if this flirting plan failed.
“A heart is the size of a fist, so it has to be bigger than a fist.” Susan wrinkled her forehead in concentration. “Maybe it was a dad phrase.”
Lavender dragged a chair over to Astoria’s side of the bed. Wrapping her arms around her, Lavender mumbled, “This better fucking work.”
Well, fine, if that’s how it was going to be.
Draco tilted his head. “Yes. That was covered in module three of Respecting the Non-Magical World. I understand the concept. We also discussed homosexuality.”
“I expect an owl by ten pm with the name of the bath bomb you picked.”
But Draco didn’t seem to think it was awkward.
─────── ⎎ ───────
Draco’s face went lax.
“There’s only a few olds left,” she continued. “Hagrid’s head of Gryffindor; they’ll probably be grooming you for that, but he’s got a few years left in him. Minnie retired last year but she keeps popping back in to pick up a book. Pomfrey and Pince moved to Brighton in 2000. Trelawney’s down in Wales somewhere. Filius keeps saying he’ll retire, but, you know. Men. Tricking themselves that they’re irreplaceable.”
Ron rolled his eyes and said, “Ok, yeah, sure, fine. It won’t.”
They didn’t have to wait long for an invitation to the Oliver-Winger household. Audrey announced at the next faculty meeting that her daughter Alina was turning eleven on the eleventh, and that they were all invited down to their cottage for a bit of cake.
“Have you been under a rock, or?”
“They should!” Draco sat up straight and began practically shouting about how students needed to learn multiple languages when they were young, and wizarding kids and muggle kids learned languages in primary school or through their at-home tutors, and how it was stupid to throw away multilingualism at the young age of eleven, and, besides, there were magical schools in other countries and they could do proper exchanges if they knew other languages.

11:53 am, July 25, 2007
Then the beat of Akon’s ‘Smack That’ filled the air and Malfoy turned beet red. He hustled away from Harry and fell upon on two unsuspecting Hufflepuffs who’d gotten a bit too grindy, hitting them with a quick bubble spell. Malfoy’s neck was bright red.
Fifteen minutes was a bit tight, but he could manage it. Slipping his trainers off and leaving the rest of his clothes in a pile on the floor, he hopped to the bathroom (the stones were so cold; he should ask Kreacher if there was a spare rug somewhere, though Kreacher was just as likely to have removed the rug just to watch Harry suffer a bit; Kreacher pretended to hate both Harry and Hogwarts, but Harry caught him humming occasionally and he was a fierce member of the Elf Union) and settled into the tub before turning the taps. He knew it was odd, but he loved being in the bath while it filled. It was just a reminder that he could luxuriate in the bath for as long as he wanted, free from the grimy feeling of Dudley’s cold bathwater. Feeling rather chipper, he began humming and conjured soft silvery bubbles. He splashed happily about and belted out the few words he remembered from that catchy James Blunt song—“You’re beautiful, it’s true—”as he got up, shaking a bit like a dog to get the water off.
Susan’s head lolled to one side. Astoria swept the hair away from her face. “Please, please, please,” she whispered, over and over, then bent to kiss Susan’s forehead, but when she pressed her lips to Susan’s skin, it burned.
Draco pressed his lips together. “In what sense?”
“It’s not that bad,” Malfoy said at last. “I’ve only had to Ebublio one couple.”
It was colleaguely to teach someone about a new culture.
Ron groaned.
And now he was sitting there, usually so confident in his broad shoulders and thick arms and capable thighs, suddenly thirteen again and bumbling around after a long-dead toad.
Astoria closed her eyes. The tears seeped out anyway.
Cho winked at Ollie, then snapped at the bread lion, which floated into Posie’s hand.
“Maybe it ought to be a whole school thing. Fourth-years and above.”
“Come here,” she said, sitting up. The bed moved with her. Draco tried to fluff the pillow, but only succeeded in making it more uncomfortable. “Sit.”
Vane now has an entire line of Curavi potions, from the giggle-boosting Giggular (which tastes and looks like honey made by bright pink bees) to the sensuality-heightening Donna, brewed with an extremely diluted tincture of belladonna to slow down and amplify sensations. Your editor has tried many of Vane’s potions over the years, and let her be the first to recommend these new, ethical “love potions” for anyone looking to introduce a new element into their sexual explorations. Go forth, imbibe and procreate joyfully! ✰ ✰ ✰ ✰ ✰
Dear Draco,
Addie snorted. The older professors looked like someone had just dropped them here from another dimension. Padma was vibrating with barely-suppressed laughter. Bastian had his lips pursed.
Fuck, he was going to have to go buy condoms and dental dams in Edinburgh as demonstration objects. God, probably on the same trip that Malfoy had talked him into. Maybe they could just grab some stuff at Boots quickly and GTFO.
Malfoy drew himself up, took a deep breath, and crossed his arms. His voice sounded a bit thinner than usual as he said, “I spent the last years in exile from wizarding Britain and seem to have missed the spectacle of your coming out, Potter.”
The therapist had suggested she counter with more positivity. The therapist also wore linen well into November.
, because, yes, we are those romantics who got married on Valentine’s Day. 4 years of marriage! Who would have thought when we were glaring daggers at each other on the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch?! (Turns out there’s something called ~unresolved sexual tension~ that you’ll figure out in your 20s, kids. Bone your enemies. It’ll be great.)
Andromeda curled her hand into a fist. She pressed the knuckle of her index finger against her lips.
“What?”
mimbulus_fan80@yahoo.com
“I hope it goes well,” they said. “I think I’ve explained everything that’s in there to Draco. No need to bring it back when you’re done. It’ll be better used at a school.”
“Ah,” Draco said and dropped the pestle into the mortar. Neville started at the thud. “I thought I was being subtle.”
“Why are you so cheerful today? It’s so bloody hot.”
,” Elspeth supplied.
“My parents gave mine to me when I turned fifteen, but organizers are on the list of banned items because Filch had this absurd idea that you could use them to cheat in exams, which, of course, you can’t. Unless you’d modified the magic somehow.”
Ron allowed Harry a few more shrieks of joy, and then pointed his fork at Hermione. “I mean, we know she’s got the better career and would lose her fucking mind at home, plus I hate desk work, and they kinda herd you in that direction when you’re nearing thirty, so, yeah, it’s perfect.”
Nope, nothing at all.
─────── ⎎ ───────
There was a silence before Harry burst out.
“I KNOW!” Harry exploded. Showers of green sparks flew out of their fingers.
Ron fought to keep his expression neutral and then burst out, “We know.”
A tear fell down and obscured the last word. Harry watched it wrinkle the page (Hermione was definitely going to murder him) as though he were floating above his body.
“Oh, hey, Harry,” she said as they slumped on the couch next to her. “Yeah.”
1:17 pm, July 25, 2007
“Thanks for agreeing to come,” Draco said. “They wouldn’t let me go off with Blaise alone. Er, no offense, Blaise.”
At least the terrace was dark enough that Lavender could let her smile slip. Of course she had to find Hector. Like. Fair. Totally. Chill. Yay. 2007, woo. Harry bumped against her, three sparklers in each fist, their grinning face lit from below like some kind of bad Halloween jumpscare. Lavender transferred the bottle and flute to one hand, then wrangled one of Harry’s sparklers away from them.
Pansy opened her mouth, closed it, and then opened it again. “I don’t believe in love,” she said finally, “Maybe I haven’t met the right person, or maybe my brain and heart just don’t get it. C’est la vie.”
His hair was starting to come back. He was bent over the
Harry barged into Draco’s classroom after lessons and said, “We’ve got to go today. We don’t have condoms or bananas or lube or anything—”
“No names, though,” Remus insisted. “No one else watches it.”
“Hardly,” he said. “You opened the door.”
Turning around the corner, still humming the Gorillaz ‘Feeling Good Inc.,’ he smacked directly into someone who’d been lurking just around the corner.
Harry subsided.
Introductions
Draco snatched it back. “Don’t be absurd.”
“Well, as long as you’re not ragging on Muggle society,” he managed after swallowing a mouthful of the sugary and alcoholic fizz.
Draco smiled.
want 2 hold her before she loses that baby smell lol
Draco stopped grinding. “Yes. I do know that.”
He did have red eyes. Even at this distance, Harry could tell that they were the color of blood.
Malfoy leaned back from Harry’s chest, one hand on his cheek, “What the fuck are you wearing, Potter, armor?!”
“What the fuck, Potter?” she said, scowling at him. “I would have done it this year for you.”
They stumbled out of the Floo and onto the windy streets of Edinburgh.
“No, it does, I want to know.” He felt like he had to say something else. “I’m your colleague, and like, maybe your friend?”
thats what I meant
“That seems quite unfair to the elves,” Luna said, a harsh tone creeping into her dreamy voice.
─────── ⎎ ───────
Harry was definitely pacing now.
Pomona shot Neville a look.
“Intense discussion about what?”
“It really suits you,” Malfoy said, looking miserable.
“Sweet, Potter,” Malfoy said, nodding at the space where Perry had been. “You’re very reassuring.”
Harry chortled and then was brought up short by a thought. “Wait, isn’t her husband the Head Auror?”
Harry’s world was shifting quite a bit to the left. He shook his head. No, Malfoy was still there, examining one (perfectly manicured) hand and seemingly waiting politely for him to respond. Well, he definitely might have to hold off on murdering Malfoy, because it wouldn’t look good to his larger project of promoting tolerance to murder a fellow queer wizard, even if he was a fascist. (Or maybe a former fascist. But that remained to be seen.)
Neville nodded. Hopefully they could start talking about plants again soon.
“Black.” That answer came out far too fast.
“Sirius?”
Harry dropped the book and ran to Draco’s quarters. He pounded on the door.
Andromeda Tonks ran her hand down a worn, quilted pillowcase and considered her nephew. He stood with his arms crossed in the doorway, a scowl on his face that was so like his mother’s petulant expression at being cheated of the last Blood Pop, but she thought she’d better not mention this to a twenty-five-year-old nephew who’d just been paroled from maximum security wizard prison.
─────── ⎎ ───────
“Ready, Malfoy?”
“The one by Luna Lovegood.”
“Just because a lot of wizards and witches have a hard time accepting that not everyone’s as straight as a fucking board doesn’t mean these kids should think they’re abnormal—”
continued to plaster euphemisms and hatred across its pages.)
Draco cleared his throat and looked miserable.
So he reopened the parlor, right in the middle of a fucking wizard war.
But he’d been alone for so much of his life.
“What?” Harry’s mind went white with rage. If Malfoy thought he could write a history of Harry’s family without telling him, he had another thing fucking coming. “How dare—”
“Neville hasn’t been able to find one.”
Audrey paused while prodding a sunflower into her messy bun with her wand and said in a dreamy voice, “Ben always had chocolate frogs, just in case we ran into a Dementor.” She shook her head (the sunflower didn’t budge) and continued, “They didn’t really find each other until after Hogwarts, but a lot of people do fall in love as teenagers. Don’t be too harsh with them tonight, Padma!”
and fucking
─────── ⎎ ───────
I don’t really know what would help him come to terms with the information in module 3, because there’s thousands of books about each subject we sprint past.
He wasn’t going to be putting condoms on bananas in front of Malfoy.
The bath was nice, but he couldn’t stop pacing.
Neville drew his hands out of his pockets and Malfoy flinched backwards. Neville froze.
“Oh, darling,” Astoria said with loving irritation. “Nevermind.”
“Oh, you make me suffer enough,” Remus growled.
Perry scratched his head. “I think I’m fine, sir?”
Required: 12 classroom sessions, 2 field trips, 1 certificate examination
Ron snorted. “Fair point.”
“Right,” Draco said. “I think you’re being a bit …” he trailed off and studied Harry, who had begun pacing again. Mostly because Draco was in the only comfortable chair. Not because his blood was racing through his veins. “Paranoid?”
The weekend had gone off better than expected. He and Malfoy had flooed to London, spent far too many Galleons in Diagon Alley buying Teddy a slightly-larger children’s broomstick (Harry) and an animorph stuffed dragon (Draco; Harry rolled his eyes), then ate grim sandwiches at a Pret (Malfoy complained the whole time about the lack of mayonnaise, only he called it aioli and Harry wanted to barf), spent too much money at a Muggle toy store buying Teddy art supplies (Draco) and a wooden go-kart kit (Harry), and then wrapped up their day at a Waterstones, where Harry could barely see Draco behind a towering stack of contemporary murder mysteries (he refused all help carrying them, but then ducked into an alley and shrunk them, much to Harry’s relief). They’d gotten on a Muggle train, and then Hermione came and picked them up in a little red Clio.
? He’d been halfway through it. Had Malfoy taken his bookmark out?
Harry let out a sharp, “Fuck!”
She tried to keep her voice even because Harry hadn’t grown up with parents so of course they’d imprint on the first adult who was even kind of nice, but, Jesus fucking Christ, she wished they’d imprinted on Hagrid. Sure, he wasn’t super responsible, but at least he wasn’t actively leading Harry down a cryptic path towards death.
“Lions make us honest! It’s horrible but it’ll be good for you!” she shouted as she strode away before disapparating with the telltale crack.
“Sit, sit,” Andre herded him towards a stool, and then ran his fingers through Harry’s hair diagnostically. “Hm, yeah, I’ll just even it out a bit.”
All Harry could do was nod, which Malfoy took as permission to espouse a long-winded narrative about his experiences and opinions.
“Mum,” Ron groaned, “He’s not still a Death Eater!”
Professor Malfoy raised his eyebrows and looked innocent.
Copy sent to Ezekiel Jezrah Murdock, Solicitor.
Florian’s whole world changed.
Draco snorted. “I used to be.”
“Why are you here, darling?” She settled behind her desk, pushing the pile of ungraded papers towards the edge—thank God LIMS no longer required submissions on scrolls or parchment—and leaned back in her chair.
11:30 am, Jan. 30, 2007
Harry reached out and patted his shoulder.
“I could write it in a book, but I couldn’t ever say it to you,” Draco said, his grey eyes fixed on Harry’s green ones. “I’d never be worthy. You’re so, so good.”
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA
Harry opened his mouth to argue but when he saw the set of Malfoy’s mouth, he collapsed back into the wet grass.
“What is this?” Harry said. He leaned forwards and read the first page.
Remus folded his latest slip—Schiller’s
She cracked her neck and turned her attention to her lipstick collection. Tonight she was going to get laid. Somehow. With someone. Or at least kiss someone. It had been ages, ugh. Which meant that she had to go for a subtle lipstick—some people were easily intimidated and she couldn’t have even the slightest challenge towards ending this dry spell—and it had to stay put.
And then he was leaning forward, pressing his lips against Draco’s, and when Draco’s mouth opened beneath his, it felt like coming home. It was like soft yellow light and the perfect cup of tea and warm blankets wrapped around him. He had his world and his future in his arms. They’d both fought so hard, and they’d found peace and resilience in each other. It was a gentle, breathing magic that wrapped itself around their beating hearts. It was love. It couldn’t be anything else. And Harry knew that, ten years later, all was well.
“Uh, sure.”
"Scientists are chill people,” he said, clearly still thinking about the floss, which he ran off and returned with (it’s three inches in diameter, folks, not something you can buy at your local Boots).
Harry stumbled backwards, spilling tea all over his arm, just as Draco swanned in with a cry of surprise.
Well, fuck.
“You’d really have to get an acidic thing going,” Florian said with his eyes shut. He always had to see his way into recipes. “Or it’ll just taste basic.”
A not-not-there.
Blaise made some kind of noise. His brain was scrambling. Static.
“Right, so I’ll just post up in this Costa and work on my grant,” Neville said, pointing to the cafe in front of them. Hot chocolate incoming. Blaise kissed him on the cheek, then dragged Draco—who still stared at their PDA—away.
Draco wrinkled his nose.
“Just gotta keep digging,” Neville said with a determined nod.
Ever.
“I really don’t want to go.” His voice was like one of those manual coffee grinders, and then,
draconis_xx@hotmail.co.uk
with it Sirius; the contract has existed in one form or another for at least five hundred years, which you’d know if you read your Evilian or used any part of your brain instead of inhaling that werewolf’s dick when we were at school.”
“How do you even remember that?”
Harry leaned closer. His stomach turned. Before he could stop himself, he was running his fingers across where the snake coiled out of the skull’s eyes—the gentle bumps of the bleeding ink were almost unnoticeable beside the jagged white lines of scar tissue.
“I, er,” he said. “Harry brought me this.” He reached inside the robe and brought out a little black square.
“What?”
He made to the pitch at 6:37 and landed with a thump next to one of the regulation kit boxes.
If Death Eaters didn’t want to learn about non-magical pharmaceuticals, Florian wasn’t going to be the one to tell them.
Irritation pricked Harry. “And it must have been really important to take precedence over supporting your students.”
Sirius scratched his nose. “Yes.”
Cho smiled at Cedric’s voice. He’d never left her, not really. He wasn’t a ghost. But at the same time, he wasn’t imaginary. He said things that would never have occurred to her, not with the way her mind worked.
“He could just be into plants.”
“I meant the Manor, and you know that,” she said, and continued her perambulation of the room that might have one day been for a grandchild if only Tonks hadn’t gone and gotten herself killed during the Battle of Hogwarts and if she’d settled down and found someone since that little affair with Remus had fizzled out, and she shook herself and demonstrated how the window latch worked. “It gets a bit stuck in warm rain.” Draco made no effort to work it himself, so Andromeda slammed the window shut.
Harry closed his eyes for a minute to imagine it.
He felt it shining out of her, coating her house in the strongest magic known to mankind, turning a cottage into a fortress. How had he and Draco ever assumed they’d go unrecognized?
“Like, sixth year? You were obsessed with him?”
“And what’s worse,” he continued, “is that sometimes you really like someone, and you don’t even know if you’d have the wrong bits that they wouldn’t like or something, because like people don’t go around wearing labels and some people are really only into one kind of bits and it’s stupid!”
She felt a sudden urge to smooth her hand over his hair.
“It’s not,” Sirius said and stalked across the room. He glared down at her.
The librarian has figured out how to make accents. She had to do some research, as she is not comfortable with the electronic devices either.
“That’s what I told Draco,” Astoria said, “that it was a really thoughtful and special gift that clearly means a lot.”
And it did. He sped towards the Forbidden Forest. He could feel his nostrils freezing and wiggled his nose to delay the process. He should have worn a balaclava. Speeding along the tops of the trees, he filled his lungs with the frigid air. The pain felt fresh and somehow cleansing.
Harry flicked his wand at the CD player and it went silent.
wish theyd come back from oz
There wasn’t time to deviate from the plan now. Not at this point.
“Shit, Harry, no,” Malfoy said. He looked distressed. “That’s awful.”
→ [material implication]
“Not in the spirit of the request,” Remus said. Andromeda raised her eyebrows at it and it disintegrated into ash.
Bill shrugged. “You could always get some data about whether he’s likely to fuck with Remus. Or if I need to come, you know. Menace or something. Bare my canines.”
Harry flopped back onto the bed and groaned.
“I think that’s what gets me most,” he said, staring out the window. “None of it was even kind of true. But we just didn’t—we didn’t go anywhere else. Didn’t meet anyone who wasn’t already—”
Neville looked miserable. “I promised Ginny,” he mumbled. “Last time you, you know, the yellow one, and then when you tried aqua, you got that rash, and then, you know, Ginny.”
“What?” Draco asked, baring his teeth in a kind of tired grimace.
“You’re going to choke,” Remus said. “Smaller bites.”
He wasn’t gonna go back to trading stocks.
Electronic Mail
“What? Being an Unspeakable?”
“Oh, er,” Harry said. “I’ll put some in a cup for you.”
Harry let himself drift away again before he lost his poker face. Blink. Addie was pushing for a scholarship fund for gold cauldrons, which were required for many N.E.W.T.s potions. Harry voted in favor. He’d wanted a gold cauldron once. Hagrid hadn’t let him. He couldn’t imagine Snape’s face if tiny eleven-year-old Potter had rolled up with a solid gold cauldron.
“Three, I said! Not a fair contest!” McGonagall straightened her pointed hat.
She bit her lip.
Draco
Harry didn’t know what to say. There thrill running down his spine. Up his spine. Tingling in his pelvis. Thrumming in his neck. Was he becoming ill?
Then, remembering once again she was a witch, Luna raised her wand to her eyebrow and Neville blurted, “Don’t!”
“They’re on the third-year exams,” Hagrid said, stabbing one large finger into the table. “We’ve got to have ‘em.”
“You’re absurd, Potter.”
Luna flapped her hands at him. “He won’t care, trust me.”
Mum barked a laugh, then caught Ron’s eye, and they both collapsed into laughter.
“Not like this.”
Thanks!
:DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
“Wait,” Harry said, and Florian snapped back to the present. “You didn’t bring yourself one!”
He’d had two lines of ice creams during the war. Ordinary flavors for ordinary customers. Something a little spicier, a little spikier, a little fucked up for the Death Eaters who tried to swan in and, after smacking him around, bully him into giving them free treats.
??? yoga???
n fred i guess lol
But Snape, and Dumbledore, and now, Malfoy, now that he knew, they were all grey. Malfoy certainly darker than Dumbledore, but—Harry couldn’t stop a hiccup.
6⟞ ⧉ meet ginny @ helen’s, 2:00
“Yes,” Harry said. “You’re—” and then he was stuck. He couldn’t exactly say, I want you there, and he also couldn’t say you’re a flamboyantly gay man, and we haven’t got one of those at the meetings because Bastian is polyam and Mervyn is about one thousand years old and I don’t know think he even knows students have clubs, but Harry didn’t want him to think he just wanted to tick off the “gay man” box or something, and then his thoughts were getting all twisted and too much time had passed so he just. Left it there.
“Funny?!”
“All good things, I hope,” Lavender said automatically with a giggle.
“Who knows,” Draco, whose eyes were slightly glazed and whose hair was tousled, supplied.
“Yeah, whatever,” Harry said. The Louvre was stupid. Art was dumb. Fuck the French people and their fancy foods and all that shit. He didn’t need anything other than bangers and mash, but mash was actually from South America, and he’d read recently there were over one hundred kinds of potatoes in Peru.
─────── ⎎ ───────
Malfoy exhaled slowly. “It’s an abbreviation of Doctor Magicorum, or doctor of magic. The word magic is plural, but it doesn’t really translate well into English. Magics? Doctor of magics? See, it sounds awful.” He paused for a moment. “I’m not surprised you never learned Latin, but frankly, for anyone with a magical education, it should be mandatory.”
Hermione’s eyes were a clear, dark brown. She blinked slowly, then glanced at the cottage. “I’m not sure if he knows.”
Neville swallowed. This wasn’t even really The Talk. This was a lite plant version of The Talk. If it got bad or weird, he could just sort of float away and start talking about rhizomes or soil quality. Ok. It was ok.
She poured Draco and Neville more tea. “Still don’t quite understand why you’d allow generations of students to be abused just to keep your little spy ring going. He could have been a secretary or something.”
“No one’s gotten into the Amortentia yet.” Padma grinned. “Probably because I labeled it ‘Bubotuber Pus Poison.’”
How could Malfoy get under his skin so quickly?
“I don’t see why we’ve got to hide in the closet as well,” Harry mumbled.
Draco Malfoy
Harry couldn’t look at Draco. He was still laying on top of him.
“Oh, no, no,” Starr said, horrified. “I couldn’t charge you for educational tools! They were all just sitting around in the back, anyways. You know, things people returned or whatnot.”
“Honestly, Potter, I cushioned the entire ballroom the minute he grabbed your ridiculous little broom,” Malfoy huffed. He had his wand tucked behind one ear, and it reminded Harry a bit of Luna. If Luna were prickly and had a sharp jawline.
Potter,
“Quite Victorian, really,” Ginny said. “Didn’t know we should bring our own fainting couch.”
“You—what—” he hissed.
─────── ⎎ ───────

“Your door was open.”
“Fuck,” Harry whispered. “I don’t think he likes you, mate.”
“God, I’m so sorry we’re not on the Floo yet. It’s been like eight months, but they always want to send the installation wizard during the week and we just don’t have time,” she groaned once they were all in the car. Malfoy was scrunched up in the back seat, but he didn’t say anything.
Thank you for the recommendation regarding e-mail etiquette.
Draco smiled then, a soft smile that grew into a beautiful beam.
“Your glasses are on the bedside table,” Malfoy said before Harry could even open his mouth. “Which is where they should always be, if they’re not on your face.” He didn’t look up from his book but pursed his lips. “No wonder they’re always a bit crooked, since you thrash about in bed with them on.”
She’d purchased The Howes after her husband’s death, when she couldn’t stand coming into their old sitting room and not finding Ted in the wingback chair near the fireplace, and she’d thought maybe she should have done the same thing with the cottage after Tonks’ death, but at that point, she’d been too tired to go on teaching and the housing market down south was becoming quite excessive, so she’d battened down at The Howes and pretended it didn’t bother her to catch glimpses of her daughter out of the corner of her eye when she’d had a glass of wine or finished a maudlin novel.
“Fuck, she’d have been good.”
It looked so good that one Draco Malfoy walked straight into a chair in the Great Hall.
﹡take up boxing w/ florian
“Exactly, that fucker bound Draco in a blood marriage contract.”
“Ok, so, Professor Malfoy told us all about the Globe Theater, and I had to go on this field trip in my Muggle primary so I kind of knew a lot about it already, but he made this like, magical model of it that showed like how they moved through the space, and like, how all the seating areas were separated by class and cost and stuff, and how they threw rotten shi—er, fruit—at the actors when they thought it sucked, so that was cool, and then we talked about the most famous plays, like
There was another moment of silence before Draco broke it with a little cough and said, “Shall we go for hors d’oeuvres, Potter? It looks like there are some vol-au-vents, and of course, enough shrimp for you to stuff your face several times over.” He moved lightly across the room away from Harry, but Harry felt himself drawn after him as though he were on a string.
Just wait until Ron and Hermione heard about this; he hoped his owl had made it to their cottage. They must be home by now. But they both worked late, so Christ knows when they’d actually read his (absolutely livid and practically illegible) note.
Remus laughed.
“You have a lot of time to think in prison,” he said. “But I kept thinking the same things.”
Yes, that was it. That was exactly it.
Best,
“Four more years, ‘Mione. Then we’ll do it.”
He urged his broom higher and then went into a spinning nose dive he’d perfected during lazy summer Quidditch matches at the Burrow. Malfoy flew down beside him (quite a bit slower, obviously).
“How dare you—”
“I might have meant George, or any of your more handsome brothers.”
“Fuck, mate, that’s wild. Percy and Oliver engaged. Wow.” Harry laughed. “Wait, how do I get invited to the wedding?”
Ron shook his head. None of this was real.
He skimmed the next few paragraphs, where Draco laid out the series of forces that had influenced his decision to become a wizarding fascist, chief among them the desire for his father’s approval in the face of paternal homophobia.
Hermione sighed and scratched Harry’s scalp. It felt like something weird was getting under her nails, so she checked and, “Glitter?”
“Well, yes,” Sirius said with a smirk. “Not great for the charity.”
Padma wrinkled her nose. “Honestly, Potter, you’re the worst desi wizard ever. Who raised you?”

“I think Harry might be a nontaster,” Astoria said lightly. “But I haven’t wanted to bring it up to them, because, free alcohol. Gift horses and so on.”

Luna poked Harry in the side and said dreamily, “She wrote a lovely article for the Quibbler, even though nargles are very real.” Harry blinked a few more times. What was happening? How had Parkinson charmed her way into his friends’ circles, and she’d just threatened him?
Harry burst out laughing. “That’s your best insult? You sound like you’re about twelve, Malfoy.”

But when they came back, Draco bestowed a kiss upon his bride and the pact was sealed.
“Each world has, at various points, vilified the other, but we are much more interrelated than the current Hogwarts curriculum allows for. In order to propose these changes which will, of course, involve eventual Ministry participation, I have adapted Professor Potter’s seven-point curricular reform plan for the subject of History of Magic, at all levels.”
Andromeda tried not to let her confusion show. “He’s Sirius’s husband, so they spend Christmas together.”
He glanced at her. “You’re not as pale.”
Harry had their hands tangled in their hair.
Kreacher’s eyes filled with tears.
“Mhm,” Harry said. “I’m completely sorted, thanks, though.”
13th March, 2007
“Honestly, she’s like an overeager Crup,” Draco continued. “Do you think she even knows what Unforgivables are?”

“Anyone would think you were pregnant, Potter,” he said without any venom. “You’re mental.”
“No,” they said with a grin, “A mango.”
“Oh, very allowed. It’s always technically been legal, magically, anyway, well, according to magical law, but there was the whole,” Andromeda sighed and waved her hands around, “Closeting and blood purity thing in the 80s, so it wasn’t like, talked about. But it’s always been legal.”
“Oh, fuck,” Draco said quietly.
Minerva cleared her throat and stood. “Harry, this outburst is exactly why I chose not to tell you before. Now you only have six hours to contemplate Draco’s wickedness before the young devil himself appears. Wasn’t that kind of me?”
Harry started feeling a bit ill himself. That meant what Teddy said was true. It had to be true, otherwise—but—how—it was too strange to consider. It meant—no, he couldn’t—but then why—but why else would it have taken that form—and then why had he left? It didn’t have to mean something, he told himself, fighting the urge to run after Draco.
♚ Sirius
Tonight was shaping up to be a good evening, Val thought, surveying the dance floor. It was only eleven and it was already full. There would be the drag interlude at midnight, then the new DJ was going to start playing. It was all coming together.
Harry flicked him a two-fingered salute just as Minerva got up from her desk. She looked at him with a grimace. She didn’t like meetings either. Dumping a pile of papers at the head of the table, she went to the tea cart and returned with a steaming cup. With a sigh, she gestured for everyone to take their seats.
“Yeah,” Harry said and sucked his cheeks in. “Like, half the time he doesn’t know shit about anything, like, doesn’t know what a jam roly-poly is because Luna brought one last time, but instead of being a judgmental dick about it, he writes it down in this notebook.”
“Fleur? Fleur?”
“Hear me out! So she cornered me at a family dinner one time and was telling me it’s all about aligning your auras and shit, not like, positions or whatever, so like, there’s probably a couple of kids who are super into that, and then you balance her out with like, Hermione. Who’s all in there with the facts and teaching them about condoms and Plan B. Perfect. Panel sorted.” Ron leaned back in his chair with his scone, satisfied.
Harry snorted. “Posh sounds about right.”
It was, of course, just a ruse. Remus attempted to concentrate on writing down some responses on the gilt-edged slips Kreacher ordered engraved with
Harry turned to Ron. “Oh, low-level shit, huh? That’s why they’ve called out the Deputy Head Auror and the Unspeakables’ evil jewelry expert? For a routine B&E?”
True to his words, Malfoy cheered equally for both teams, though his polite clapping was somewhat overshadowed by Harry’s wolf-whistle. It lasted a whopping five hours before the Hufflepuff seeker grabbed the snitch just under the professors’ box while falling off her broom. Harry had to close his eyes, but there was a hand on his arm and a voice whispering, “Andre’s got her, don’t worry.”
Harry threw himself into the investigation the rest of the day. He scoured the area, checking and recharging dormant spellwork they’d cast. Going over even leads he had cast out as unlikely. He didn’t go back to the apartment for lunch and he didn't go back for dinner, opting instead for food that was as fast and cheap as his poor judgment had been. He wanted to give Draco space despite knowing he couldn't put off his partner, his auror partner, forever.
“I-” he licked his lips in a nervous fashion, that only made Draco want to kiss them again, “Are you sure you want this?”
Mercifully, Beth and Anne were on time despite the snow that had started falling once again. They greeted him with a hug that after the initial surprise Draco was happy to return. He made introductions for “Henry” and he took their coats before he made to join them at the table.
The shorter woman’s warm brown gaze was twinkling with amusement when she smiled at him, offering a well manicured hand out to shake in greeting, “Hello Damien, it’s good to meet you. Beth mentioned your wonderful taste in cafes.”
Harry rubbed his eyes and replaced his glasses, checking the time on his watch, it was nearly time to close up shop. Mr.Ollivander's low voice suddenly came from behind, "Still here Mr.Varma?”
If only things could remain so simple.
“So, truce yeah? Let’s agree not to kill each other in our sleep and actually go back to the dedication to the case we had before. Renewed effort. And if one of us pisses the other off again then just fucking let it out and move on. We can’t afford to keep arguing can we?”
“Yeah, I, uh, well Ginny was always going on about how we should have a set date night. So work and stuff couldn't get in the way.”
Harry raised a brow, “Scoot over.”
“You have no idea how much I want this.”
Draco’s kiss was not gentle. It was not a soft gesture of affection, but rough force and left Harry’s lips sore like a demanding question when Draco finally allowed him to come up for air.
It wasn’t easy, interviewing Anne. The glimpse he saw of Beth as they left only stung more; she’d clearly come straight from work, her cafe’s familiar apron still tied on. Things were silent between him and Potter on the way back and when they reached the apartment he now felt like the cheery décor was mocking him. Accusing him of slacking off. Of getting comfortable and complacent when there were still lives on the line. It was horrible to think of Anne as lucky. Yet, she was lucky, so lucky, to have gotten away. If she hadn’t had some muggle invention called pepper spray he doubted anything she tried would have thrown the wizard off as much. And it was a wizard. They had a description now. A description from the hoarse but steady testimony of one very brave witch.
“Can’t even properly sort his attire, those vests are going to get so wrinkled, ugh.”
So when Anne Kazan, healer at this very hospital and latest victim of this serial killer woke it was to the serious face of Healer Cherrie and the surprisingly gentle face of the wizarding worlds savior, Harry Potter. And his withdrawn partner, Draco Malfoy.
And he waits.
“Trust, Mr.Varma. And trust reciprocated. I gave her all of myself for all of hers. That is how I learned to see what others hide. Because such an amazing creature as Anise chose to grant me entrance into her heart and mind. Once you've come to understand someone so complexly as we knew each other you start seeing those little things in strangers. To know her was to know a stranger who became half my soul."
Draco probably hated him. At the very least the other man was angry at him and Harry would have to apologize for crossing a line in their professional relationship. Because as much as Harry may have wished otherwise a professional relationship was the only relationship they had. He had to stop thinking about Draco like he did. Stop thinking about how soft his lips were and how the man’s faint stubble had felt as he ran his lips over his jaw. Merlin, why had he done that? He thumped his head back against the wall.
They checked out two more florists, another bakery, an altier and three bridal shops before deciding the day was over. Not picking up much except a few rude or stiff shop attendants, that very well could have just been animosity for their job rather than their clientele and decided to call it a day after picking up some groceries. And aside from a petty argument over what type of breakfast foods were superior, they managed to keep things between them pretty civil.
Harry shrugged, "I've had worse, and if it shuts you up I can live with it."
“What are you doing?” Potter grumbled, coming back from wherever he’d been lost in thought.
Things fell back into their normal routine almost too easily. Harry didn’t know how to bring up their falling asleep together, twice now, and for some reason when he tried his words caught in his throat. His words had started to do that a lot around Malfoy. He was a stranger to this version of Malfoy; they were no longer two teens on opposite sides of a war. They were on even ground for the first time. The way this Malfoy was stirred up something in his chest - something he ignored, buried deep like when they were still in school. Harry knew he should keep it that way. He wanted to ignore it. And he didn’t. And that just caused him to wonder ridiculous things like what Malfoy thought of him. Did he still hate him on principal or was he over him by now? Did he see the same kid who’d followed him around Hogwarts accusing him of being up to no good? Or did he see the chosen one the papers so loved to gossip about? What did Draco Malfoy see when he looked at him? Why did that question suddenly seem to matter so much to him?
“You- you were worried about me?”
They chatted awhile, the topic eventually turning to the elephant in the room; the recent murders. They’d been discussing wedding planners when it came up. Beth’s knuckles had gone white at her side.
Potter never gives up though and he just replied, “Harry.”
"Its classified, 'Mione." He sighed, walking over to the kitchen counter to start them a pot of tea, "All I can say is I won't be here anywhere between a few weeks and months. If it makes you feel better Robards assigned me a partner so I won't be going undercover alone."
By the time night falls and they’ve finished their evening patrols Malfoy has ordered them takeout from what had quickly become their regular indian restaurant. And opening the container Malfoy handed him to his favorite order of red chicken curry, well Harry blamed the warmth he felt in his chest on the still warm container. He glanced over at the other man, watching as Malfoy tried to balance a rava-dosas in one hand and his quill in the other as they were eating at their desks. Harry has the strange urge to wipe away the little bit of sauce Malfoy had smudged on the corner of his mouth. Before he can do something stupid like reach out and act on that feeling though, Malfoy licks his lips and Harry feels his face heat up, shoving a forkful of curry in his mouth so he could blame the spices for the heat. Really. He didn’t know if he should thank Malfoy for comforting him  last night or if that would be overstepping some line. This was unfamiliar territory between them. This- friendliness or whatever. He looked at Malfoy again, saw how pinched his face had become as he stared at the writing on the paper pinned to the board in front of him. His writing had stilled and he’d abandoned what little was left of his dinner. Something in his chest clenched as he read the paper Malfoy was lost staring at.
Harry settled back into the couch, untangling their hand from Fleur’s and wrapping their arms around their knees. “He’s just out of Azkaban.”
“What happened?”
“Oh, I haven’t got any on,” Sirius said with a groan, “Moony, you’re killing me.”
Harry’s neck prickled. “I can’t tell you. It’s private.”
Percy leaned forward and rubbed his hands together. “Exactly, the book was all about forgiveness and the ability for people to change, which I think—"
“Ugh, what do you think?”
does percy have aim
“He’s on parole,” Sirius said. “With Andromeda.”
Luckily, Andre answered the door. He was wearing a midnight-blue silk robe and had a mug of hot chocolate in one hand.
Minerva took off her hat and rubbed her forehead. Hagrid was sputtering and insisting that the slugs didn’t mean to hurt anyone.
“He’s quite... you know,” Blaise said.

After the meeting, Harry caught up with Draco in the hall. “Ta for the name-dropping, even if you couldn’t resist dragging me a little.”
Harry raised his eyebrows and ran his hands through his hair. Perry was really going to have to pay more attention if he wanted to pass the O.W.L. He was almost sure Perry had some kind of learning disorder, but as far as he knew, wizards didn’t seem to recognize alternative learning strategies, though that was definitely why his classes were mostly discussion and hands-on activities. Too much lecturing disadvantaged kids who struggled with paying attention. “Britney?”

Malfoy’s gaze pierced Harry.

Harry laughed weakly. It seemed too complicated to correct her. Draco didn’t say anything either.
Harry’s mind was buzzing with a soft static. Words seemed impossible. This pain was nothing like the sharp Horcrux pain. This was more like suffocating. White feathers filled his mouth.
LITERALLY
“Oh,” he said. “I’m not sure.” He blinked. He’d always done the Weasley’s for Christmas Eve and Andromeda and Teddy for Christmas morning. Why hadn’t he just said that?
The gold trousers had gotten a bit tighter in the waist, thank God, he might be filling out a bit.
─────── ⎎ ───────
Harry considered her bowed head. “You don’t know until you try it. I mean, I don’t know your parents, other than that they’re madly protective, but they probably just want what’s best for you two. They let you both come back for the battle.”
A tall, thin blond man appeared in the doorway. She almost wouldn’t have recognized him, but for the brief flash of judgment in his grey eyes. Pansy straightened.
“I can’t believe I didn’t realize it—” Harry said, raking his hands through his hair (it didn’t make it look better, but Draco didn’t mind). “I kept saying we were colleagues.”
“Hug?” Andy asked, suddenly afraid that she’d overstepped. Let him reestablish the boundaries. She wasn’t going to feel bad if he didn’t want one. She wouldn’t. She would be an adult about it all.
Malfoy looked him up and down—a bit longer than professionally necessary—and rolled his eyes.
He nudged open the matte black paper and felt something solid drop into his hand.
“Yes,” she said, holding out one hand. “I’m a lesbian. Welcome to the Thursday Night Social Club for Currently Queer Former Hogwartians.”
Malfoy’s pale eyebrows rose above his glasses.
Harry couldn’t move his eyes, apparently.
Sirius’ glanced back. “Yes.”
Re: Re: Re: Welcome 2 the interwebz
It was fine. This was all fine. Harry James Potter, aged twenty-six, war hero, former Horcrux, survived Voldemort just to be killed by Malfoy’s thighs. He flopped back onto the pillow and closed his eyes.
He glanced over at Talbott Oliver-Winger, a man whose hair and skin were the same tawny light brown. He had high, sharp cheekbones and was wearing a full suit and bowtie. He smiled at his wife, then cast his glance around the room. When it landed on Harry and Draco, the smile vanished.
The next day, Harry slid into the seat beside Draco at lunch and whispered, “We need to talk.”
“Actually,” he attempted a more serious tone. “That’s why I came.” Harry sat back down in the other armchair and tried for remorse.
─────── ⎎ ───────
Someone who’d come fly with him when his skin felt too small.
Malfoy poked him in the side. “You wouldn’t be a half-bad stripper, Potter.”
Harry blinked at him. “What?”
“Neville just said it was a surprise.”
“You know why I disappeared after the war?” Malfoy’s eyes were fixed on his knees.
“Potions?”
“NINE!”
◼Hogwarts internships?!
“Yes, fine,” Narcissa said, shooing them away. She turned her attention back to Draco. “What’s going on?”
Which of course would be exactly when the Senior Fellow in Kathartic Runes popped out of his office and raised an eyebrow at her before sweeping down the dark hallway in majestic purple robes. Another quality reminder that she wasn’t quite from this magic world, she thought and flushed in anger and irritation. Despite all the shit that they’d worked towards after the War, there was still so much superiority and snobbery and—Hermione squinted and pushed her office door open with magic, just to prove that she could while levitating her teacup.
His knocks went unanswered each time.
“There’s not usually a moment at which,” he said, stabbing one finger into the table, “One can point and say, this is where it changed. But that was it. The internet.”
“How lovely!”
Harry stopped, his hands tangled in his own hair. The perfect plan for revenge uncoiled in his mind.
“What are you doing for Christmas, then? Malfoy Manor, big party, dye the peacocks green and red?”
After a vigorous class, since Britney insisted that they all get up and act it out “properly, because Shakespeare is so physical” that included Justin refusing to sing Ophelia’s song and attempting to beat box it instead, a startlingly charged scene between Claudius and Gertrude, and actual wailing over Yorick’s skull, Harry collapsed into his desk chair.
Malfoy turned around with a wicked look in his eye.
“The silhouette is,” Blaise sighed, “All wrong.”
Harry sighed. “He doesn’t get out much.” He gave him a ten pound tip.

“Hello, Parkinson,” she said after staring down the smaller woman.
“Perry, it’s ok. I’d recommend talking to the person. Just ask them.”
“Cool,” Ron said. His brain was feeling kind of scrambled. Hermione came up behind him and scratched his neck. That didn’t help the brain scrambling.
He should have said thank you.
“God, Potter,” Draco said, when they were meters from the cottage, his breath puffed into light clouds against the midnight-blue sky, “You do go on and on sometimes.”
His eyebrows drew together. He handed it over.
Magnifying her voice, she boomed across the hall, “All students to their common rooms now. Anyone found in the corridors after the next ten minutes will lose their house one hundred points.” Noises of shock and horror—and a few shrieks from canary victims—broke out across all four tables at this draconian threat. One hundred points. Harry hadn’t lost points on that scale since Snape’s reign of terror in the potions classroom.

“Side effects,” Luna objected.
Malfoy’s gaze was back to piercing. He gave Harry a once-over, pausing on the grey joggers with a considering hum, and then laughed at Harry’s shoes. “You’re going to fly in high tops?”
Malfoy curled his lip.
He had dirt underneath his nails.
Into the fog.

The day after the Ball, the students left for the Christmas holidays and a blessed silence settled over the castle. Christmas Eve itself dawned grey and snowy. Harry spent the day fiddling with wrapping paper and wishing he could at least enchant things to be neat. They loved him and it wouldn’t matter, he told himself.
“Good,” Kreacher said ominously. Andy wrinkled her nose at him. “Now you will lose at charades.”
Harry snorted, flipped a piece of French toast onto their plate, and was reaching for the syrup when Sirius yelped, “The fucking icing sugar!” He levitated it over to the table and released a powdery cloud.
Hermione waited. “Biscuit?”
Astoria believed her, if only because the room was now perfectly silent and all eyes were glued to Draco.
Narcissa glared at him. “So I assume we’ll be going there directly.”
Malfoy was fucking heavy. And he was panting.
“What’s that?” Potter had finished his dinner in silence and gone to work some time ago. Draco hadn’t noticed him come to stand behind him in his concentration. Potter leaned over Draco’s shoulder and was squinting at the photos, green eyes moving rapidly from photo to photo.
"What's the hold up?"
Draco let out a frustrated groan from where he sat in the middle of their office, map and files and tips spread around him on the floor in a pattern that made sense to him. Separating the helpful from the useless. The similarities and clues adding up before him like a half solved puzzle. He rubbed the balls of his hands into his eyes, relishing the pressure and relief the motion provided. He knew there was more he just wasn't seeing. Not yet. It frustrated him incredibly as he once again went over the information they had, not even noticing Potter had reappeared in the office until he cleared his throat.
Draco was, admittedly, confused, “Okay?”
“Ah, Henry, I was just about to come check on you!” Malfoy- Damien laughed in a way that seemed almost genuine, turning back to take a card from Surrey, “We’ll have to come back after we’ve settled on a date! Monsieur Surrey here is telling me about this new trend, naked cake, that we have to consider.”
Draco hummed in response squinting at Potter’s still turned back. He looked fine. His attire at least was as pristine as potter ever got and there was no sign he’d gotten into any trouble. Except that look when he’d walked in. Draco bit his lip, worrying it between his teeth as he’d always done when stuck on a problem. Potter was keeping something from him. That much was obvious. But what? If it pertained to the case and the pig headed fool wasn’t sharing… Draco turned on his heel and paced back to the windows. Potter was definitely keeping something from him, but how could he get that stubborn Gryffindor talk? The only times they even remotely relaxed around one another was during meals and… well never. Draco looked around the room before walking over to the wizard chess set neither had touched, checking the compartments. All the pieces seemed there at least. Perhaps Potter’s tongue would loosen over a match? Gryphindoors didn’t back down once challenged after all - no matter how foolish. Draco smirked at the idea, because even if Potter didn’t talk Draco was confident he would win the game. He was confident of his skill in this. Decided, he waved Potter over when he left the little kitchen area with two steaming mugs, “Fancy a game? Bet I’ll wipe you off the board in fifteen minutes.”
“Yes, and scarhead and potty won’t work I suppose. Ah, what was it you called me?”
And he found himself shifting to make room in the bed. There was room. So much more further to the side but Potter made no comment as he slipped under the covers and they lay there. Shoulder against shoulder, hands still entwined. Draco thought surely the sound of his heart beating would drive the other man away. Then Harry let go of his hand and shifted and Draco thought he'd gone to far. But Potter shifted toward him instead, arm held out in hesitation, silent question on his face Draco was now close enough to see. And of all his sins, his failures due to weakness, of all his shames he knew this would be the greatest. Yet he nodded anyway, whispering his answer, his demand, his plea,
Harry glared back gripping the portkey tighter, "You wish."
And it was just his name. He'd always been Draco Malfoy. He'd heard his friends, his family call him Draco since the day he was born. So why did the name feel so different at this moment? Why was it he couldn't let go?
“Had a few things to check up on but all dead ends.” He sounded defensive and Draco heard rustling. Potter was no doubt discovering his takeout; chicken marsala kept warm by the charm Draco had case over an hour ago.
“Watch you all the time with a dopey expression and jump to support you in every conversation we’ve ever had?” She was shaking her head in amusement now at Draco who could only gape, “I swear the two of you look at each other like the other hung the moon. It’s sweet.”
Harry just started at him for a moment before it click. This is where they would live, and as a soon to be engaged "couple" they of course were only given one bed. Oh. Harry rolled his eyes. Of course Malfoy had claimed the bed.
Harry walked over and stood, arms crossed less than a foot from Malfoy, “That all you’ve got?”
Harry did not in fact move, or rather he wouldn’t have but suddenly there was a tapping coming from the living room. A paper bird fluttered outside the french door style windows and Harry opened one to let it in. The only people who knew of their location were Robard’s and the unspeakable witch. He doubted anyone they’d met as Henry and Damien would have needed to contact them in such a discreet fashion either.
Harry scoffed and didn’t hesitate to return the insult, “Ferret face.”
They said their goodbyes to the very friendly Mr.Surrey and once a safe distance from the bakery Malfoy asked him lowly, “So?”
"Really, Potter?" Draco sassed but there was no malice in his voice. Only fondness as he continued, "I think you should at least be able to recognize a ring box and when someone is proposing to you?"
Draco frowned and subconsciously moved forward speaking softly,
Despite Draco’s frown Harry grinned,
“For catching that asshole.”
Apparently he cleaned so long that Olivander had to come see why he hadn’t left for lunch. The older man seemed bemused rather than angry to find him so distracted and when Harry started to apologize for losing track of time Ollivander just held up a hand, shaking his head.
“Yeah,” Was all Harry could manage suddenly.
“Move you oaf.”
How- What an absolute heathen. No manners. Really. Draco thought with a huff, sitting on the sofa with a huff. His face felt warm and he resolutely ignored his heart thumping in his side.
The apartment was empty when he got back though, so he ordered takeout for the both of them and went to work in their hidden office until the food arrived. Potter still hadn’t come back and Draco was annoyed. If that idiot had gotten hurt-
“Please, Draco. Trust me.”
Malfoy sat back in his chair taking a long sip of his tea, somehow making the action look both arrogant and elegant, “Ah, yes. We were creative children. I don’t see why we’d have trouble finding something to call each other.”
Harry shook his head but Malfoy looked her over with a critical eye before speaking,
Draco didn’t have to elaborate for her to know who he meant. There was only one person he could mean. Beth let out a heavy sigh swiping a hand over her golden hair, adding another streak of flour to a few endearing others, before she found her voice,
“Harry! Oy, I think he’s waking up!”
When he turned from looking out the window Malfoy did not. Instead he had his chin propped up on one hand and though his eyes were scanning the bakery still Harry got the distinct impression Malfoy’s mind was elsewhere.
"Draco, I-"
Draco’s smile fell and his eyes darkened as he shook his head, placing the button down on the desk once more. A heavy silence weighed upon them at the motion. When Draco didn’t answer him, when he wouldn’t meet his gaze but chose instead to stare at the button with an unreadable look Harry could feel a heavy weight settle in his stomach.
“Uh-huh,” Beth’s disbelief was clear in her tone and expression but she didn’t push. Draco sighed softly before lifting his gaze back to hers. He caves quietly,
Malfoy let out a sarcastic huff, because of course Malfoy could make a huff sound sarcastic, and turned his hand to grip Harry’s almost painfully. His eyes were empty but his voice thick with anger,
“Harry?!”
Both Harry and Beth found their attention wandering often back to the other side of the room. Anne was laughing at something Draco had said in their own quiet conversation and Draco’s lips were twitching in an obvious attempt to resist a smile. His glare more playful than reprimanding. Beside him Beth let out a soft sigh that drew his attention back to her. She was still gazing fondly at the other pair when she spoke softly, “That woman is going to be the death of me.”
Face flushed to the tips of his ears Malfoy sputtered, “Shower free then? Right. Good night.”
The aliases!
Right, for the case, of course. Draco nodded and they finished dinner in an unusual silence before they set out for the areas they’d already selected to patrol. Draco made comments about the fairness of Potter’s invisibility cloak and Harry fought back till they left the building. Not that someone with Draco’s extensive potions skills needed an invisibility cloak to go unnoticed but still, the fighting was unavoidable. Almost comfortable at this point. Not that either man would ever admit to that. After a disappointingly fruitless night spent walking around cold despite the number of warming charms they’d each cast, Draco was in no mood for this frankly silly argument, “Really Potter, you're not the one who stepped into frankly I don’t want to consider what and got their shoes and a perfectly nice pair of trousers ruined. My toes will freeze off if I don’t shower first!”
Yet he was entirely stumped as to if such feelings would be welcomed or not. Sure, undercover they were close. But could it be more than just a cover to Draco? He could just be doing his job, not meaning anything more but to maintain the facade of a couple. Harry hoped it wasn't the case and yet at the same time felt guilty for even thinking it.
Silence met him.
And he was looking at him now. Living with him. Working with him.
Harry was taken aback, opening and closing his mouth like a fish out of water. For one he didn't know how to reply to that- having been the auror who informed her himself. But her other statement… of course he was worried about Draco. But love? He- No, he wasn’t- He didn’t- He’d begun to care for Malfoy sure but what Beth saw was just that. Care. For his partner. They were just partners; in the auror sense and nothing more.
Malfoy was fuming. He'd told Eldreda not to follow any lead without backup! Now the crazy old bat was comatose and inflected with an unknown curse. He pulled at his hair. He half wanted to rip it out in his frustration. They'd only been working this case for a month and while the motive seemed clear enough and they'd narrowed down an area they still had no idea who was committing the murders. What in Merlin's name did she find that led her to that alley and why hadn't she contacted him? He'd really thought they were starting to become a team, he- no. He didn't need a partner to find this sicko.
And Potter was facing him. His three piece suit and transfigured frames a reminder of their cover but his perpetually disorderly curls and worried green eyes the same Harry he'd always known. Draco had allowed himself to be pulled in by that mix of familiarity and newness. There was only one thing left he could do to keep himself sane, so he shoved Potter out of his way.
Potter's eyes narrowed and for a moment Draco felt the familiar spark of challenge between them. Until he was suddenly being hoisted over Potter's shoulder; Draco definitely did not squeal in surprise. He was however insistent the other man put him down. Even if the view wasn't half bad- he wasn't going to tell Potter that.
“Oh, should I just wallow in grief like you? Don’t act like you don’t blame yourself just as much for everything that’s gone wrong!” Harry fumed, “Or did you forget that I live with you, work with you, see every day just how responsible you feel. I blame myself just as much when things go wrong and it’s got nothing to do with some hero-complex; I just want to keep people safe!”
Harry clenched his jaw at that, “Shut up.”
Harry was more confused than ever, “I don’t follow, sir.”
It was spoken like a command but it wasn’t. It was a plea. And finally Draco nodded and only hesitated for a moment before replying,
Hours later, frustrated, cold, and hungry from the rash decision he’d made to skip breakfast in favor of vacating the apartment Draco found himself standing in front of a now familiar storefront. “Tokens of my Confection”, declared the pastel script across the door and on the sign above. Draco couldn't help the smile that felt half a wince at the cheesy name Beth had chosen. It must have made Anne laugh for her to have picked it, perhaps it was even Anne who suggested it- it did seem something the shorter woman would come up with.
He shoved past the other man and sat at his desk, resolutely getting back to work. They had a killer to kill and anything else he might have been feeling just wasn’t important.
The Unspeakable looked almost offended at the question but replied evenly,
Unsurprisingly she didn't elaborate. Unspeakables rarely did. Her reply at least seemed to satisfy Malfoy who nodded once more but remained silent. Taking that as consent the woman cleared he throat and pulled out her wand before turning to Harry first and performing an unfamiliar spell. Though he felt a momentary warmth radiate about him he felt no other effect and when he looked down at his hands they seemed almost the same. Except the scars were gone. He looked up at her in surprise.
As if to punctuate his statement Draco’s shielding charm once again broke and a flurry of curses were flung their way, he and Harry only just managed to remain out of range or block them as they came. Minutes that felt like hours of grueling spellwork later they once again panted behind the crates. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand in his own as they locked eyes again, “Go, I can only hold him off awhile longer before I won’t be able to cast anymore.”
Draco is vaguely aware of leaving the café as his brain continues to short circuit. Beth was clearly reading too  much into their facade. Clearly. She had to be. Right. There was no way Harry bloody Potter looked at him of all people the way Beth described. It was impossible. Laughable. Because if Harry felt that way for him then- then-
Potter stepped into view at this, wand thankfully tucked away once again and a smile that only grew into a genuine one as he saw who was at their door.
Across town, as the sun made its descent in the grey winter sky a certain healer made her way home after her shift at St.Mungo's, mind on the idea of a nice fire and dinner with her fiancee to keep her warm. It had been a draining shift, magically, and she wanted nothing more than to reach a familiar bakery already and rest up. So preoccupied in her thoughts was she that she didn’t notice the shadow of a man creeping ever closer. She didn’t notice she was being followed until rough hands wrenched her off the street and into a shadowed alley with impossible speed.
Anne stepped inside opening the door to reveal Beth behind her. They looked over Harry and Draco and it was Beth who spoke next,
“I think, given the circumstances, we can forgive you.”
“Draco,” He placed a hand on the other man’s shoulder, turning him firmly but gently to face him, “who’s button is that?”
