"I believe that he has made six of them." Albus regarded his spy with a hard stare to prove that he was being serious.
"Well I overheard them talking about him using the term the Dark Lord and Nott looked pretty worried, but Astoria didn't seem very bothered." Pansy said smoothly, not using either name. She wouldn't seem a coward in front of all the Gryffindors, but she also wasn't about to say the evil wizards name.
"Is he going to be okay?" Harry asked, looking worriedly at Draco.
The three Slytherins nodded, holding on to Harry again, trusting him to keep them safe. They bounced through three more locations, each just a remote as the last, but this time the Slytherins didn’t ask where they were or how Harry knew about them. Their last stop was the vast fields just outside of their property.
"If you don't mind me asking, why are you here? I mean, what made you need a room." Harry went for the jam and added a generous amount to his pancakes, taking in the delicious smell wafting up. Normally he wouldn’t care, he’d never pried any of his past guests and he didn’t know what had made him want to start, but something was drawing him to speak. Harry really needed to sleep more.
"Silence!" Voldemort roared and every in the room went stone silent. "How will you benefit from the attacks to stop?"
Vipera cried, lunging at her brother, forcing the other snake to jump back.
"Alright, sounds fair." Pansy nodded her consent and Hermione called cushions from the room and spelled them in a circle around them.
"It would be tricky, but I'm sure with everyone's help we could pull off at least a few transformations by the time spring rolls around." Severus mused out loud, voicing the same thoughts that Harry, Hermione, and Draco had discussed just the night before.
"What if I don't want to talk about it?" Harry whispered and Draco sighed.
Draco stood still during the entire encounter, not sure what to make of it. Quickly he spelled the floor clean of his release and then slowly made his way toward the warm, inviting water. His mind still hadn't caught up with everything that just had happened, orgasm included, so Draco spent the short shower with very little on his mind. It was in the same zombie-like state that Harry found him as he wandered into the kitchen.
“Why would his house be listed in the a History of Magic?”
He had returned from their meeting knowing more about Voldemort’s plan, however, and he found that it helped him little. He had known that Draco had never been the intended murderer, but he had never thought that Voldemort would task him to strike down the old wizard. Things must be becoming drastic if Voldemort thought that having Severus openly turn on the Light was necessary for his plans. He would have to report his findings to Dumbledore, but he supposed that he deserved a stiff drink first if nothing else. Of course that would be the moment that a panther patronus leapt through the door and sat in front of him with expecting eyes.
In the days that passed since his meeting with Dumbledore the core worked on what information they would provide to the rest of the Junior order and to the DA at large. They didn’t intend on lying to anyone, but it was obvious that the horcruxes were extremely sensitive information and the fewer who knew of them the better. Luna often sat out during these conversations, being too much a free spirit to hammer down strategies and hard lines and she spent the time with Harry instead, the pair setting up camp in front of the fire in joined silence as the arguments raged on behind them. Harry wasn’t ready to put his own ideas on the table as of yet, especially when he wasn’t sure just what it was he was feeling.
“Do you think that this will go over well?” Ron asked, voicing the worries that had been on all of their minds since the day before.
“There is a barrier there.” Harry pointed to the empty air with his wand. He dare not cast any spells or touch the invisible barrier until they had a better understanding of what its purpose was.
"Oh, I'm not sure I know what you mean." Dumbledore smiled, playing dumb to push Severus' buttons.
“Then we should go. There is no sense in wasting more time. Is there anything you think I might need?”
“I have something to show you.” Harry quickly stood from the couch, pulling Draco up with ease. He could be overreacting, of course, there was a lot he didn’t know about the Wizarding world and while his cloak was undoubtably special, Draco would know for sure just how rare it was. He hadn’t been surprised when Ron hadn't known much about it, the Weasleys wouldn’t have reason to know useless information about magical artifacts, but such studies would have been normal for Draco’s upbringing.
“Wow that nearly sounds normal,” Harry teased and Draco lightly punched him in the shoulder, though his smile gave him away.
"That's Dennis Creevey, his older brother is the one who was petrified through his camera four years ago. Thank Merlin he didn't pick up his brother's bad habit of following me around asking for my photo and an autograph." Harry smiled and brushed his hand gently on Draco's arm as if he had read the boys thoughts. "I think we should have Ginny, Demelza, and Dennis play against the last group of three, you want to gather them up Katie?"
“Okay, no more shields.” Harry gasped for breath as he leaned against the back wall. Dumbledore stood beside him also doing his best to reagin some composure. “How are we going to get past this thing?”
“I think we need to bring the twins in on this. They are on the outside and I trust them to get the job done.”
Harry waited with bated breath for the man to continue. When he did, Harry wasn’t disappointed. Without any hesitation, Dumbledore began to explain to him about horcruxes, the diary, and how it would take destroying all of them to finally defeat the man. Harry sat patiently, taking in all of the information, waiting for Dumbledore to stop and let him react.
?" Draco asked, looking to Harry, thinking that Hermione would take offense to the comment.

"When you're around Molly enough you pick up a few tricks around the kitchen." Harry served up their lunch and Draco just shrugged.
"I never did thank you for helping me with her today." Harry smiled, reaching out to pull Draco into the bed and laying him down so his head fell on his chest.
“She cries for you, how
"I don't think I will ever understand all of that pureblood decorum. It seems like a lot of rules to follow with little gain." Harry shook his head, sitting back in his chair feeling much more comfortable with this form of intellectual banter.
"Good." Harry rolled off the blond, making sure to pull him closer. His hands roamed up and down Draco's naked torso, feeling the ridges of his quidditch toned body.
"Detention, Potter, for your insolence and fifty points for your tongue."
It was an odd question and very out of place, but Harry answered anyway, “Yes, he was meant to kill you.”
Tuesday afternoons were normally very relaxed for Harry and the core. They all had a study period at the same time, minus Ginny and Luna who were a year bellow them, and they often hung out in the common room or out on the grounds depending on the weather. It had been decided that morning that they would have a meeting after dinner so Ginny and Luna could be present, but Harry knew that his friends were all very curious to know what information Dumbledore had given him and their none too subtle glances were putting him on edge.
"I know that I'm like your child, but you know that you can talk to me right? Even if you can't tell me everything, you can still let me know some of what is going on, it might help."
"May I remind you that you are the one who wants to redo my home, not me? Why do you need me to help?" Harry whined, but got up anyways. He also wanted to tell her that he could pick out his own clothes, but he refrained. There were only so many fights he could pick with the woman before he gave in and he was quickly coming to that limit.
"I'm sure you don't mean that." Harry protested, making sure to keep his fake emotions real enough so he would not be caught.
"We need to have another DA meeting, and I know that most of the house is listening at the stairs, so I'm sure we will only need to inform the other houses. We will meet tomorrow, in the usual place at 10 o'clock. I will answer all your questions then." Harry was looking up at the stairs while talking, smirking when he saw the edges of robes disappear as the Gryffindors hiding there did there best to leave before being caught.
“You filthy brats, stealing from me! Who do you think you are?” He rounded on Harry as soon as the boy made it through the door way. “You! I should have known, filthy Potters sticking their noses in places where they don’t belong!”
"I've taken a leaf out of your book, it seems to be working." Ron smirked at the green-eyed boy across from him. "But something really needs to be done about him. This was not a simple mistake."
"Why did you agree to come again, Harry? You're not being very useful." Hermione whispered to her friend as she passed him and Pansy stifled a giggle from his other side.
"Stay out of this, Mr. Potter." Dumbledore warned coldly, all kind pretenses gone. At his words, Harry rose again. Draco held on to the boy's wrist for a moment before letting go. He knew better than to get in his way when he had his mind set on something.
Harry felt very relieved to hear the comforting words form the mediwitch. She had patched him up a great number of times over the years and she had never lied to him before. If she said that Ginny was going to be okay, he believed that she would be okay. Silently, Harry followed the potion's master into the back office. The air between them was tense, but for the first time since they had met, the tension was not due to whatever contempt they might have felt for each other, but for their shared distrust of another person. It was a mild improvement in Harry's mind. Snape stepped into the room first and took a seat behind the desk, Harry followed and took the open seat across from him. Snape locked the door with a flick of his wand and put up a silencing spell. Had it been anyone else, Harry would have felt vulnerable and would have gone on high alert, but Snape had slowly become one of the few adults in the school that he completely trusted, which was a concerning thought to dissect at later time.
"She's right." Harry turned, hissing the password to Salazar, who had been watching their interaction with interest.
“Not nice!” Draco gently punched his arm before kissing it better. “Getting out of here does sound good though.”
"That's the problem, I don't have that many happy memories." Draco said, head down as if he was ashamed.
“It was a gold locket, a real old one with a snake on the front, it was a pretty dark object from what we’ve been told.” Fred said as he stayed by Mundungus, his hand firmly planted on the man’s shoulder to keep him in place.
The barely perceptible nod was all the answer he got and Severus closed his eyes in concentration. It wasn’t as if he had never called upon his patronus, for a man with his history it might have been surprising how often he had been able to cast it when needed, but here, in the dark, dank cellar with a half mad Narcissa Malfoy shaking in his arms, Severus found himself severely lacking in the ‘happy thoughts’ department. The standard ones like receiving his letter to Hogwarts, being sorted into Slytherin, the short friendship between he and Lily in the grand scheme of his life all fell short and the Potions Master began to grow desperate. A gentle tug on his collar brought his attention back to the woman in his arms. His dark eyes locked with her pale blue and he allowed his occlumency shields to lower. He knew that Narcissa was gifted both in occlumency and legilimency, she would have to be to hide her distaste for her husband and his choice of company for so long. It was also part of the reason she hadn’t fully lost her mind to the torture.
"When my broom was cursed during the game, Dumbledore completely ignored protocol and didn't alert my parents that anything had happened to me. He also dismissed the incident and labeled it as an accident even though we all know that it was an attack."
Snape left the Manor as quickly as he could without drawing attention to himself. It wasn't until he was safely on Hogwarts grounds that he let his walls completely drop and the bile that he had been keeping down finally came up. He wretched on the lawn of the school by the gate, leaning on the iron rods to keep his body up. When he finished emptying the contents of his stomach, he spelled the mess away and steadied himself. He knew that he had told Draco that he would go to him first, but there was no way he could face his Godson in that moment. Instead he pushed his tears further back and made his way up to the castle, the Headmaster's office his destination. It would be easier to report to the man first before talking to Draco. At least then he wouldn't have to leave the poor boy behind to give the report. He knew that he wouldn't be able to leave him just as much as the boy wouldn't have been able to let him go. He made the rest of the walk in silence, his mind blank. He wouldn't open up all of his emotions again until he knew that it was safe to do so. He stopped for a moment before the gargoyle statues to collect himself. The irony of the matter, the fact that he had done just the same before facing the most evil wizard of their time, was not lost on Snape. He gave the password and started to make his way up to meet his other puppet master, vowing to make everything right again for both his and Draco's sake, the second that he could manage.
“Oh, now you’re suggesting caution?” Harry snarked back, though he followed his former mentor and fell into a defensive stance.
Vipera asked, moving away from Harry and closer to her brother.
"Whatever is necessary. Don't forget, you must convince the boy." In all of the years that Snape had known the Headmaster, he had never seen the man look so old and tired. He knew then that Albus was not evil, but rather that he was getting far too old and starting to lose his grip on reality, just as Harry had assumed.
“Artikus’ home is to the west,” Harry said, pointing toward the location nearly across the way from their position. “Hermione and them did a good job with their guess.”
“Okay, well then I think we know what we need to do. It’s probably best we if introduce her to everyone slowly for now.” Harry said gently, pulling the attention away from Neville to give the boy a moment to breathe.
"Okay. I wish there was more we could do though. Get sleep, okay? Tomorrow is going to be a busy day." Harry stood taking Draco with him. They both leaned down to kiss Ginny on the cheek, bade Blaise goodnight as well, and made their way to bed.
"So the great Harry Potter doesn't do anything for free." Blaise jabbed again, the ease that had just been created between them dissipated.
"Yes well last year when I was talking to Professor McGonnagal I mentioned that I might want to consider teaching. She told me that when you go into teaching you're supposed to have at least two subjects that you specialize in. Of course I told her that Defense would be my first choice, but I had no idea about the second. She suggested transfiguration and told me that she was friends with the editor and that she would ask for an exception for a subscription to be sent to me. If you want you can read the old editions, I have them all saved up in my trunk."
"Good, now be a gentleman and walk me home." Draco rolled off the Gryffindor who moaned at the loss.
"So I am a child now?" Harry asked from his spot on the bed. While all of the teens were sitting watching the scene all of their wands had been drawn again when the other teachers had arrived.
." Harry screamed when he felt the ice touch his hips. His eye flew open and his pupils were blown wide. Draco looked up to meet them with a huge smirk on his face. He continued to kiss along his hips and upper thighs until the ice was gone and only his mouth was cold. He repeated the process twice, once on each of Harry's nipples, soaking the sounds that he was making. "If you keep this up, I won't last long." Harry managed to say between moans.
“Harry’s a wreck.” She finally says, and Draco looks up at her. “I don’t know exactly what happened between you two, because he doesn’t want to talk about it. All I know is that you said you don’t want to see him again. Now, I understand if you don’t love him back, Malfoy, but you must have made that clear to Harry in the most horrendous way because he is utterly destroyed.”
“You only call me Pans when you’re hiding something.” Damn, she’s right; of course, she’s right. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad to tell them, they already know about the shagging, they might as well know how pathetic he is, developing feelings (or already having said feelings, shut up) as well. And then he can get smashing drunk and not worry,
“You thought I told my friends that you loved me, and what? Laughed about it?” Harry wonders, sounding indignant.
As Draco’s distracting himself with paperwork, he hears the floo network swoosh to life, and he steels himself.
“Well, yeah. I might have been projecting my fears quite a bit now that I think back on our conversation. But you said Granger told you that you were using me, and I assumed that you were using me for sex, despite knowing about my
would have been mortifying when I knew you didn’t love me back. To have these feelings that I wasn’t supposed to have and to have you tell others about it. People knowing that you’re pounding me into the mattress on the regular isn’t humiliating at all. Besides, I told Blaise and Pansy long ago, so that would be quite hypocritical of me, wouldn’t it?” Draco smiles what he hopes is a reassuring smile as Harry contemplates his words.
, you were using me for my
“It’s nothing, Pans, truly.”
“You weren’t supposed to find out, not like that anyway,” Potter mumbles, refusing to look Draco in the eye.
“Malfoy” Potter flashes his million-watt smile as soon as he lays his gorgeous green eyes on the blonde.
“What do you want to talk about, Potter?” Draco knows he’s stalling, and Potter’s coming towards him. The couch dips as Potter settles down on the opposite end from Draco.
“If he honestly doesn’t like you, then that sucks, man,” Blaise says and gets up to get another beer.
“Of course he loves you, you moron!” Granger exclaims, exasperated. “He’s been in love with you since our sixth year, Malfoy. Why did you break it off if not because he’s in love with you?” She looks as perplexed as Draco feels.
“I have plans, Potter.” He lies and throws Potters arm off him, not too gently. His bare feet touch the cold wooden floor and he shivers.
“Shut it! Whatever. The problem is that I’m the only one with feelings.”
“You did?” Draco makes his way over to the couch and flings himself dramatically down upon it. If they’re going to have a talk he isn’t going to stand awkwardly, shuffling on his feet.
“Yeah. Hey, get me another bourbon as well!”
“I told you, Potter. I’m not having sex with you. You’re drunk.”
back and that’s why he was going to end it that Saturday.
. I thought he was breaking it off with me!” Draco’s mind is going haywire, trying to process this information. Potter is in love with him? Potter is in love with him!
the sex
He steps out of the fireplace and into Potter´s living room. He’s been here many times before over the past three years, but it feels different this time. It’s quiet. Draco’s heart is beating in his ears as he scans the room and then heads for the stairs. Maybe Granger is right and Potter’s lying in bed, Draco thinks and then he runs right into a wet, naked chest. He knows it’s Potter before he can lift his gaze to meet his stunned gaze.
When they're finished, sweaty, panting, and happy, an owl flies in through the window. It drops its letter on Harry’s head and flies off again.
“Yes, you said so in your letter.” Potter shifts a little in his seat and looks as if he would rather be anywhere but here, talking to anyone but Draco. It hurts Draco a tiny bit, even though he always knew it was going to come eventually.
“I missed you yesterday,” Potter says, looking more hesitant again.
Potter’s face instead turns the shade of the Gryffindor common room, or what Draco imagines the room to look like.
he thinks to himself and walks over to pick the underpants up and puts them on.
“About us having sex?” Potter pretends not to understand. “I only told them, I didn’t know it was a secret, Malfoy. I’m sorry.” He looks sorry, too, which infuriates Draco even more. How can he pretend to be sorry and then laugh and make fun behind Draco’s back? He genuinely thought Potter was above that sort of thing.
“You’re leaving me for some prat at work. Why wouldn’t I drink?” Potter mutters, slurring his words a bit. The warm feeling that settles in the pit of Draco’s stomach is all kinds of wrong, but he can’t help it. Potter has gotten drunk due to being upset because he thinks Draco had gone on a date. He decides it’s the best lie he’s ever told, maybe excluding the one at the Manor, when he’d lied that he didn’t know if it was Potter or not. Excluding that lie, this was absolutely his best lie ever.
“No, I didn’t mean- I meant sleep as in sleep, Malfoy. Let me sleep with you, please.” This is not a good idea. He and Potter are strictly just sex, nothing else. Draco can’t afford to let Potter come that close to him in any other way. His heart won’t be able to take it.
“You think Potter would fuck someone for three years that he didn’t have feelings for?” Pansy’s words give Draco pause. Would Potter have continued their relationship for so long, with anyone that he doesn’t have feelings for? But Draco isn’t just anyone, he’s a great lay and he gives amazing blowjobs. Besides, if Potter isn’t looking to settle down, it’s easier to have a fuckbuddy, or whatever, instead of a relationship, and Draco’s an easy option since they already have something regular.
“She did? I’m so sorry, Malfoy. I didn’t kno-“ Potter begins to apologize, but Draco interrupts him.
Friday evening Draco finds himself out drinking with his two best (only) friends; Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini. If Potter isn’t going to fuck him, he might as well fuck himself over with too much alcohol. But he isn’t precisely getting drunk, not yet anyway. Blaise and Pansy can see he’s down and if he gets too drunk they will weed out of him what it is about and he doesn’t want them to know that he has fallen head over fucking heels in love with Potter of all people. He suspects they already know, but he doesn’t want to confirm anything. They are Slytherins after all, and there’s no telling what they might do; how they might hold it against him.
“I met up with Ron and Hermione yesterday, you know.” Potter begins and Draco wonders where the fuck this is going. Whatever Potter wants to talk about, Draco could never have imagined that it would begin like this.
“Does it really matter, though, Draco?” Harry asks and Draco shivers at how his first name rolls off Harry’s tongue. Last time he’d said it, Draco hadn’t been able to enjoy it, considering the circumstances. “If you’re in love with me, and I’m in love with you, then does it matter how we got here?” Harry moves from the armchair and gets on his knees between Draco’s legs and holds Draco’s hands between his own.
But they’ve been slacking off the rules lately, especially Draco. Which is stupid, he was the one who wanted strict rules in the first place. Draco needs to leave, take the floo to his own apartment, get ready for work. Except it’s a Saturday. No work, then, but he still needs to get out of Potter’s flat. He carefully lifts Potter’s arm and untangles himself, hoping not to wake the gorgeous man up. Of course, he fails, and Potter stirs.
“Draco…” Pansy begins, and Draco steels himself for the coercing that’s coming. “What’s going on with you? These past few weeks you’ve hardly said a word.” That’s more direct than Draco was expecting, but that’s better; he can stop her assault for information head-on.
“So, you weren’t using me for
“What? That doesn’t make any sense, Malfoy. You said I was humiliating you. You said that being with me was mortifying.”
“Malfoy!” He hears Potter’s voice, and it sounds like he’s drunk. He is drunk. He comes stumbling into the kitchen, spotting Malfoy at the table, and then he’s grinning, a foolish, dazzling smile.
I’m in love with you, and I used sex as an excuse to be with you. Hermione said it wasn’t fair, on either of us. She said that you had a right to know about my feelings and decide if you were too uncomfortable with that to continue our relationship.”
“No, Potter, I’m glad she did. She said you’re in love with me.”
“No, I wanna stay here. Let me sleep with you, Malfoy.” Potter slurs; his breath heavy with the smell of firewhiskey.
“Malfoy, let me fuck you?” The words aren’t a question, but the tone is.
Potter is behaving differently. Draco had gotten an owl the following morning with an apology for showing up drunk at Draco’s place and bothering him. He’d also written that he had plans with Weasley and Granger on Friday, which might not seem suspicious, but when you’ve been fucking someone every Friday without fail for almost three years, it’s fucking strange when you suddenly have plans.
“Oh.” Harry becomes quiet, as he contemplates again.
“We need to talk, Potter.” Draco thinks Potter’s going to refuse, to throw Draco’s words about never seeing Potter again back into his face, maybe even get angry, but he doesn’t. He just nods.
When Draco wakes up, Potter’s arm is slung around him and his chest is pressed up against Draco’s back. He feels content for a second before he remembers that this is Potter. He’s in Potter’s bed once again, in Potter’s apartment. When they started fucking, almost three years ago, they made rules. One of those rules was that the one who came over to the other’s place was to leave afterwards. No need to sleep in the same bed after the deed was done.
“I still think you should tell him. You never know.” Pansy lifts her wine to her equally red lips.
“Screw you, Potter. I’m leaving.” He buttons his trousers and stomps out of Potter’s room and to the fireplace. Before he calls out the address of his own apartment, while throwing the floo powder into the fireplace, he hears Potter calls after him.
“Malfoy?” Potter breathes. He’s right out of the shower, his mess of black hair plastered to his face, almost entirely covering his scar, and water is dripping down his toned chest and disappearing into the towel he has around his waist. Draco shakes his head; he’s not here to get fucked, he’s here to talk.
, and that you’d told Granger and Weasley.
“Tell me what? That he loves me? You’re seriously misinformed if you think Potter’s in love with me.” It just doesn’t make sense. Why had Potter said he’d used Draco if he loves him?
“I don’t understand anything right now, Granger.” He says and she glowers at him, disbelievingly. “I genuinely don’t. Potter doesn’t love me!” Her look of utter surprise makes him even more confused.
“What did you mean by that anyway? That you were using me.” Draco asks because he still can’t fathom what else Harry could have meant. But if Harry was, is, in love with Draco, then he wouldn’t have been using Draco at all.
A thought had struck Draco as Potter and Smith were leaving. What if Potter had found someone? Was he going on a date on Friday, and was scared to tell Draco? But that couldn’t be it. Potter would end it with Draco as soon as he found someone else and he wouldn’t be anything but blunt about it. Potter didn’t know Draco had any feelings that could get hurt in the process. Or maybe he did. Maybe that was why Potter was so fucking weird; he’d figured out that Draco was in love with him and he was thinking of how to end it without hurting Draco’s feelings? Potter was nothing if not a bumbling fool, but he was very keen not to hurt people, no matter who they were. Fuck! What the fuck was Draco supposed to do now?
, is Draco’s helpfully sobering thought.
Monday at noon, just a little over two weeks since their relationship ended, Potter’s friend Hermione Granger shows up at Draco’s work. She’s not there to get healed, that much is clear. Her eyes are filled with angry fire and her steps in the corridor are menacing as she marches up to Draco.
“Fuck you, Potter” Draco mumbles, even though he knows Potter is right. He’ll always come back to get fucked into the mattress by the Boy-who-lived, as long as said man will have him.
“Sorry.” He smiles at Potter, but Potter wrings his hands together.
It’s Sunday night, and Draco is sitting in the kitchen, looking over some papers for work. Work as a Healer isn’t only practical, there’s paperwork. Luckily, paperwork is easy to take home, a perfect distraction from his unfortunate situation with Potter.
Draco thought.
Two weeks come and go, and Draco can’t seem to shake himself out of his dejection, this misery. He doesn’t sleep well, and he’s distracted at work. The hospital chief, Rosenstein has lectured him more than once, but Draco just can’t concentrate. He doesn’t cry anymore, not after that first night. It’s like he’s just empty; he doesn’t feel anything but a dull ache in his heart. He misses Potter. Potter’s hands all over his body. Potter’s hot breath in his ear as he gasps out moans and groans, whispering how good Draco feels around his cock. He misses Potter’s cock in his ass, in his mouth. Mostly he misses Potter’s lazy smile after they finish, Potter’s arms around him as they fall asleep. Loving Potter is atrocious. The worst mistake of his life. (Maybe becoming a death eater was a worse mistake, but not by much)
feelings for
“I’m going there. Tell Rosenstein that I’m off work for today.” He’s already out of the chair and heading for the door.
They go into his office, and he cancels the lunch-meeting he had scheduled. He sits down behind his desk and gestures to the patient's chair in front of the desk for Granger to sit down. She chooses to stand, glaring at him.
felt about
“Mhnm..” Potter grunts and then throws his arm back around Draco, tugging him impossibly close, closer than is good for Draco’s heart. “Stay” he murmurs into Draco’s ear, his hot breath sending tremors down Draco’s spine. It’s tempting. Very tempting. Too tempting. He needs to get the fuck out.
"Thank you, Rachel, I will have to commend him for his insight." Harry smiled back. The young witch had never ogled over him and he was glad that he didn't have to deal with an adoring fan every time to call.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry lay there for what felt like hours, wallowing in self-pity before the first sound erupted from his left, hurting his eardrums and shocking him well and good enough that he found himself moving to curl up into a protective ball before he realized that he could move again. The pain from moving so suddenly set in just as suddenly as the sound had come and Harry was crying out, regretting making such a loud noise instantly.
Harry couldn't wrap his mind around his own emotions and so he did the only rational thing he could think of, he headed to his room where a bottle of firewhisky and shot glass sat waiting for him.
"Well I speak for everyone when I say I'm glad that you can consider this home." Ginny smiled, knowing that Draco was hardly paying attention to anyone, but Harry. "And as much as I adore seeing you two make love eyes across the table, I have an essay to write before tonight." The unspoken understanding that there was going to be a DA meeting that night was obvious and Ginny bid her goodbyes, even going so far as giving Draco a chaste kiss on the cheek while winking flirtatiously at Blaise and then Harry. "See you boys later."
Hermione was busy ushering the rest of the younger students out of the room while Dean and Seamus where rearranging the cushions for the smaller amount of members still present. It took longer than necessary to organize everyone back into a group, Fred and George where making it difficult with their constant jokes and pranks. By the time everyone was situated, Draco and Ginny had cleaned up and it was nearly eleven o'clock. Hermione, Ron, Blaise, Ginny, and Draco took their seats on the stairs around Harry's throne. The green-eyed boy merely rolled his eyes and sat on the stairs with them, avoiding the ornate chair.
“My Lord,” Severus immediately got on his knees, hoping that his groveling would win the man over. In truth, he did it so when Voldemort began to torture him his body had less distance to fall. “I am afraid I have nothing to report. After Potter and his gang disappeared from the school I haven’t been able to find anything new.”
"Don't worry I'm sure I'll be back before the week's up. Also could you please owl me if you figure out what's going on?"
"I can, but I promise I'll explain everything to you and Severus when I can, it seems I have business to attend to today. Luna, are you free?" Harry reread the letter once more as he asked her. It seemed that Snape had heard back from Bill and the man was willing to meet up with him that day at noon at Gringotts. It also seemed that Snape had been able to get him permission to leave the castle by Dumbledore himself, he only hoped that he would be able to get Luna permission too.
An apparition appeared in the center of the room of a young Tom Riddle Jr. It was certainly created when he was still in school as he was in his Slytherin robes and he still had a boyish look to his face.
,” he tried again and this time he realized that he couldn’t hear himself speak. There was no noise in the pitch black cavern.
"Sev, what's wrong, you need to tell me what happened." Draco said quietly and the man finally pulled away, his red-rimmed eyes nearly causing the two boys before him to cry as well.
Draco sat alone on the couch, his lower half wrapped in a heavy quilt. He was reading a book, though the way his eyes seemed to flutter closed every few seconds as if they where too heavy to keep open made Harry guess that he was falling asleep more than reading. Sighing, Harry did his best to pull himself together before joining the boy on the couch. The blond jumped slightly in surprise when he felt Harry sit next to him. He set the book down and spread the quilt out to cover Harry too. When he looked up, however, the sleep seemed to clear from his eyes and concern replaced it.
They made it to the top of the tower before long and Dumbledore stopped to face him. “You will need to trust me for this Harry. I know that might be hard given the past few months, but we will not return alive if you do not trust me.”
“I take it we’re done with the important talk for the night,” Draco laughed and Harry pulled away looking a little dazed.
"Look, I understand that you are afraid for Draco and his safety, I get it, but if this is going to be a long conversation, I would rather go clean up first and be comfortable." Harry said, realizing that this was going to be one of those long, drawn out conversations that would end with very little actually happening, but would at least clear the air between the two.
"Of course Blaise. Also, Harry, your secrets are safe with me."
To demonstrate Hermione began to pull all sorts of things from the little pouch. Books of varying sizes, neatly folded clothes, packages of crackers and dried foods, and even an astrology telescope.
“I know in muggle culture, these types of stories are just fiction, but is this story based on truth?”
Harry took his seat and watched as if in a trance as Draco moved around the kitchen to serve them. He moved with confidence, as if he had been doing this for years and this wasn't the first real meal that the two were sharing in such a peaceful setting. To Harry's delight, Draco had made a simple pasta dish with spinach, mushrooms, and shrimp. The sauce smelled like lemons and when Draco sat down and poured them their wine, Harry delicately took his first bite.
"Alright that was a really great tryout guys, I will have the results posted in the common room by the end of the week. If you want you can hit the showers down here, the locker rooms are open still, otherwise you can head up to dinner, I'm sure you're all famished."
"Calm down Ron. It's much too early in the morning for this." Harry stood his ground despite his casual tone. His fingers twitched and he felt his want resting against his arm, waiting for the simple flick of his wrist to come free. He didn’t think it would come to blows, but Harry was always prepared. War did that to you.
"I'm fine, Dragon, just stressed." The old childhood nickname make Draco smile even wider. It had been ages since anyone had called him that, though the only other person who used to was his mom.
"They're friends, not followers." Hermione spoke back cooly and Harry rolled his eyes.

"I can try, but no promises, I honestly don't know how they will react to me."
"And I don't have to worry about you?" The Slytherin looked skeptical.
Harry was so far gone that he didn't even feel Draco's eyes on him, something that the former war survivor would normally have noticed right away. He continued to stroke himself as he lathered up his hand with soap. Slowly he spread his legs, gingerly circling his entrance with one finger, before sliding it in, adding a second moments after.
The second snake reasoned, clearly the more adventurous of the two as it began to move closer toward Harry.
The tender moment was short lived, however, when Snape pulled back entirely, hissing in pain. His right hand immediately went to his arm and his eyes widened in shock.
Hermione pronounced the spell perfectly, being precise with her wand movements. A beautiful silver otter soared from the tip, swimming around Hermione's head for almost a minute before disappearing in a haze.
"We'll said," Harry did his best to smile at the blonde. "Come along now."

"Better." Was her only response and everyone in the room couldn't help, but grin.
“It is astonishing the decline of the modern wizarding curriculum,” Pansy tutted every part the well groomed pureblood woman. Harry felt very out of place amongst this version of his three friends and he was more than thankful that they had agreed to come with him. In a matter of magical prowess and skill, not many would have a match to Harry, but in this he was obviously inferior.
“No, it’s not that.” Harry started, but stopped himself. He had told them already that they wouldn't understand, that they couldn't possibly get what he was going through and every time it never ended well.
"Mr. Potter, was there any reason you decided to disrupt my class with your little squabble." Snape intoned when all of the students had left and Harry stood in the center of the room. As much as Harry was able to hold in his emotions around his peers, there was always something about Snape that hit a chord in him.
"Fear of the name only causes fear of the thing itself." She said smartly.
“Not telling him seems the wisest course of action.” Severus wasn’t sure if Dumbledore actually thought that he hadn’t already talked to the boy, but he had learned a long time ago that allowing those who consider themselves powerful to believe that they could control you always worked to your advantage.
"Fine." Snape groaned, running his hand over his face before beginning. "Do you know what horcruxes are?"
"Draco, my son, I am so sorry." Severus' voice cracked several times, it was obvious from the raw sound that he had been crying for a while before he had made it to their rooms.
"What were you tasked to do?" Harry asked suddenly, pulling Draco from his thoughts back into the present.
“Remember what I told you.” Severus whispered from Harry’s left.
Harry wondered if he truly meant that all of his actions this past few months had been to force a divide between them to bring them to this moment. He wasn’t sure if he could truly believe that, but he also didn’t have time to consider just how messed up his thought process was.
"When I came to school and everyone expected something from me I didn't understand why. I didn't know who I was, or what had really happened to my parents. Sometimes I still think that everyone that grew up in this world knows more about me than I ever will. I don't know what that has to do with my recent behavior, but I do know that I'm so sorry, and I've never shared this with anyone. I just want you to know that I have such a hard time saying these things and I really am trying. I am so sorry, Draco. I just don't think about telling other people because I'm just not used to having anyone else that I can talk to. Ron and Hermione have always been a duo. Even though we're all very close, they've never been able to understand and most of the time when I tried to talk to them we just got into fights. I'm so sorry, I hope I can make this up to you."
"Time is not something we have, Severus." The calculating look that the man gave him was enough to make Severus shiver outwardly, though he made sure to keep it subtle enough. He wanted it to look like he was trying to hide his fear, but not enough that Voldemort wasn't aware. It would do him little good to have the man believe that Severus didn't fear him at all. Voldemort seemed pleased with the reaction, however, and Severus took that as his cue to continue speaking.
"Correct, I believe your father's was a stag as well, was it not? Five points to Gryffindor. So as you can see-"
“Well if you can fit anything in that, why not keep it? You never know,” Neville commented smartly and the others agreed.
"You promise?" Draco asked, mirroring Harry's question from earlier in the night. He captured Harry in another kiss before he allowed him to respond.
"Me? Wouldn't it make more sense for it to be you?"
"We saw it from the crowd, Snape was even trying to use an anti-curse just like he had when you were knocked off your broom. I'm telling you that someone is doing this intentionally, but I still don't think it's Pansy." Draco chimed in.
"I already filled everyone in on the small matters, I think we just need to go over the animagus
"You can't be serious. After everything we've been through you're ending it over
Harry awoke early on Friday morning to the sound of an owl scratching at his window. Wincing at the light from the rising sun pouring in through the same windows, Harry let the owl in, instantly recognizing Pig. With a frown Harry took the rolled parchment from his foot and gave the little owl treats, watching as it nearly flew into the closed window narrowly missing it as it zoomed out of the still open one.
"Well I'm sure that Harry can absolve the situation." The headmaster replied cheerily, looking to the boy for an answer.
“That slippery, filthy man took it.”
"You will tell her no such thing. A man has to keep some of his reputation." Harry rolled his eyes at his antics, but agreed. "Very well, off with you lest someone things that I actually enjoy your company." At that, Harry outright laughed. He felt the man silently drop the wards on the office before he let himself out into the cold, drafty corridor.
"Then I trust her too." Harry smiled, leaning down to kiss his lover gently on the lips and Draco moaned into it. Harry pulled away before they could go too far, starting off for their rooms once more. When they passed the alcove that Harry knew Pansy was in, Harry stopped again. "You can come out now, Parkinson."
“You’re in an awfully good mood.”
"Yes and no, I have connections in other ways, old friends that I've fought beside that still think they owe me life debts despite what I might tell them. But yes, I don't think I ever want to be in the public eye again because the power that my name alone seems to hold over this country. It is very dangerous. It won't take long before the public creates a monster out of me again, before they think that I am turning evil again, and before I am cast out. Again."
"Try." Albus reached forward to pick up the ring. "The only way to destroy this will be to wear it."
“Now you listen to me, Malfoy.” She seethes. “I have a lot I want to say to you, and I can either do it here, where your co-workers and patients can hear every word I say, or we can go somewhere private.” Faced with those two alternatives, he doesn’t have much of a choice.
“Get out. I don’t want to see you again.” And Draco’s stalking out of the living room and into his bedroom, slamming the door shut behind him. When he finally hears the sobs cease and Potter’s shaking voice pronouncing “12 Grimmauld Place” into the floo, he breaks. The tears are pouring out, overflowing, and he’s whimpering, howling with the emptiness he feels in his heart. The place where Potter is and always will be, deep in his core, feels like it’s being repeatedly ripped out of him and stomped into the ground. It’s finally over, done with. But it hurts more than ever. He never should have been with Potter from the beginning. He only set himself up for this terrible, harrowing heartache.
for you, which I can’t blame you for; I’m an excellent lay.”
“You don’t think I checked? Granger’s birthday’s in September, and Weasley’s in March.”
“No, you git. It’s because you’re drunk. Why are you even drinking on a Sunday night?” Draco stands up from the chair and makes Potter sit down instead. He’s getting Potter some water and then sending him home.
Well, even if Draco gets hexed at work, it is still completely worth it.
“No!” Draco protests, quite franticly, because now he understands what Harry thought he meant by those words. “No, I thought you’d found out about
“But you’ve still liked him for quite some time, so what’s the problem? I thought you were screwing Potter anyway, as disgusting as that is.” Pansy prods.
“Granger came and chewed me out at St. Mungo’s” Draco begins and Potter’s face drains of colour.
“I’m great in bed, Pansy. He won’t leave my ass just because he doesn’t like me.”
“Both of you are absolute knobheads!” Granger exclaims. “Talk to him, Malfoy. You need to sort this mess out, now.”
“I’ll tell him, but be sure to fix this mess, Malfoy!” She calls after him as he runs for the floo.
“Shut up, Blaise” Draco is getting so fucking drunk tonight.
“I’m afraid he might already know; he’s been acting weird. Normally at this time he’d be screwing my brains out-“ he ignores Pansy’s sounds of disgust “but suddenly he’s meeting with Granger and Weasley.”
He spots his trousers in the opposite corner of the room, forcing him to go around the bed to Potter’s side to get them.
“Yuck” Pansy interrupts. Blaise pretends to vomit.
“I need to talk to you, Malfoy.” She snarls at him, like an angry cat. He briefly flashes back to his third year when her fist met his face and he blanches.
“Let me get dressed, and we’ll talk.” Potter’s voice is hoarse, and his eyes are red-rimmed, and Draco realizes that he’s been crying. Guilt tugs at him again, but he pushes it down. He’s here to fix things after all, and if Granger’s right, then things will turn out all right in the end.
“Well, I’m glad I found out somehow. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t be here now. You know, I love you back, Harry.” And Draco can’t help the dopey smile on his face as he finally says the words that have been weighing on his heart since forever.
“Merlin’s rotten balls!” Potter curses under his breath, and Draco can’t help but laugh. At Potter’s angry and embarrassed glare, he stops laughing.
“You mean the feelings you’ve had for him since our fourth year? You climbed a tree to mock him, and I had to help you climb that tree, Draco.” Blaise raises his eyebrows and his beer.
“Good evening to you too, Potter. No, you cannot fuck me.” Draco sighs, and puts down his parchment.
“No. Someone I met through work.”
“You told Granger and Weasley?” It isn’t truly a question. “Who else have you told?” The words leave Draco’s lips in a rush, forced out against his will for Potter to see, for Potter to laugh at. How Draco is so fucking desperate to keep his deplorable feelings hidden, how Potter can hurt him by spreading it around, how he can humiliate him.
“Oh” this time Potter sounds deflated, but that’s only Draco’s hopeful imagination, so he shrugs it off. “Is it anyone I know?”
“Boyfriend, huh?” Harry chuckles. “Well, I guess he would be delighted.”
“Where is he? Is he at the ministry?”
“Go on then, Granger, or did I cancel my meeting just to have you scowl at me?”
“Maybe it’s someone’s birthday?”
“Oh, what plans?” Potter asks, and Draco isn’t sure if he’s calling him out on his obvious lie or if he truly wants to know. He scans the room for his clothing that Potter had ripped off of him last night. His shirt is on the floor and his underpants are flung on the lamp on the dresser.
“I obviously wouldn’t want you spreading that kind of information around. It’s humiliating, it’s mortifying.” And he pushes Potter’s hands away. He needs to get Potter out of the apartment before he starts crying himself. Potter falls in a heap on the floor and he’s shaking with sobs. Frankly, Draco is confused, why is Potter the one crying?
“I… might have developed feelings for Potter.” He admits, swirling the drink in his glass, an awful bourbon, but the taste doesn’t genuinely matter when you’re out to get drunk.
“Yeah, well. Hermione said it wasn’t fair on you. She said I’m using you, and I guess I kind of am, even though I didn’t mean for it to happen.” Draco feels a sudden cold run through his veins. Potter talked to Granger (and Weasley too, probably) about Draco. He told them about his feelings for Potter, took their advice. It makes Draco suddenly furious and humiliated. Potter has no right to tell anyone! Did he laugh with his friends about how pathetic Draco is to have fallen for him?
Draco turns as he’s buttoning his shirt, scanning for his trousers. Potter is laying on his side, resting his head in his palm, his elbow holding him up. His hair is a mess, but when isn’t it? It stands up in the back, and Draco knows he made it that way when he pulled on fistfuls of hair as Potter pounded into him last night. The memory makes Draco pause, his brain focusing on the way Potter felt against him and the feeling of Potter’s stupid hair between his fingers. When he re-emerges from the memory, he meets Potter's expectant gaze and realizes that Potter asked him a question.
He tenses up even more while the inner battle with his conscience continues. Malfoy seems to take this as his cue to finally let go of him. He moves away from him and Harry suddenly worries he might leave. Despite his embarrassment, he really doesn’t want to be alone right now.
“I was a mess. My emotions were all over the place.”
“— and… Hey, where did Baxter go?” She craned her neck and narrowed her eyes as she pushed aside some of the leaves. “That’s strange.”
“Oh? Please, enlighten me. What’s the difference?”
Harry’s eyes darted to his friends again when Hermione leaned over to Pansy and whispered something to her. Looking exasperated, Pansy nodded. Harry still wasn’t used to the fact that they were all getting along so well now. Pansy could be fun but, still, Harry was a bit wary around her.
, feels Malfoy’s lips on his.
Oddly enough, Draco knows exactly what Potter means. But never in a million years would he have thought he’d hear those words from Potter, directed at him.
“Her name is Celia,” Draco said, unable to stop himself. He went over to them and knelt down beside Potter.
He sits back on his heels, not knowing what to do about the emptiness he feels in his chest. He blinks away the tears that are threatening to brim over. So this is it. He doesn’t dare to hope. He can’t let himself hope. It will be so much more painful. He sinks down to the ground, not caring if his robes get dirty. It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters anymore. Even if Potter were able to survive, would he be the same person? Would he be the person Draco unknowingly took into his heart? Honestly? It wouldn’t matter. Any version of Potter is better than no Potter.
“You did that on purpose!”
were busy.” Potter nods to the rolls of parchment neatly stacked beside Draco. “Man, I hate when there’s nothing to do.”
“And he said you don’t have a mummy and a daddy, either, just like me.”
“Show me the room you become when Draco Malfoy goes in there.”
“Oh, and you think you’re that reason?” Draco sneered.
“For fuck’s sake, Draco, will you just listen to me? What happened that night has nothing to do with you or your bloody Dark Mark.”
She sniffs at him, as though she doesn’t believe him.
Oh bugger.
Draco’s eyes dart to the floor, his face twisting into something painful.
Mentally preparing himself for Draco to attack or hex him, he slowly reaches out and puts his hand on his shoulder. He feels the jolt that goes through the other boy’s body, but he doesn’t turn around. His grip on the shelf seems to be getting tighter, turning his knuckles white. He lets out a shuddering breath and Harry has no idea what to make of it. He steps closer, unsure of what to do, his eyes burning into the back of Draco’s head. Despair bubbles up inside him, along with a presentiment of doom. He wants to be honest with him, he wants him to know how he feels about him, and at the same time, he wants to take that secret to his grave. He’ll get his heart broken as soon as he says something. And yet, staying silent seems so much worse.
A wave of panic washes over him. Is he supposed to tell Potter? Because… what happens if he comes and his cock is still in Potter’s mouth?
“Merlin, what are we waiting for?”
“Potter,” Draco whispered, shaking his head. This man was just full of surprises. “Hold on.” He turned around, narrowing his eyes at the koala. “Who the hell is this then?”
“Yes,” he practically moaned, before his own tongue met Harry’s. He buried his hands in the thick black locks, pulling him closer to him.
“Even you can’t deny I’m the best in this class,” Malfoy drawls, his eyes pointedly darting over to Hermione.
“What?” Potter whips around, his face ashen.
It didn’t eradicate all the terrible things Malfoy had done but it was the most significant to Harry. Because it showed Malfoy had chosen the right side in the end. And he had risked everything in doing so, hadn’t he?
“You’re actually serious,” Malfoy says, putting down his toast.
“Oh!” Draco swallows. Okay. He gets the idea. He moves slowly at first, pulling his hips back and pushing them forward, all the while staring at his own cock as it slides against Potter.
He imagines Malfoy looking into the mirror, and seeing the reminder of what Harry did to him. Every day. For the rest of his life.
“Yes! Oh, yes!”
“You think I’m being selfish,” Potter murmured. “But things are so much easier when I’m a koala. There’s no pain and… you and Teddy…”
“She told me a bunch of things, actually,” Luna said mysteriously.
“I have it under control,” Harry says, hating how unconvincing he sounds.
Draco swallowed, suddenly feeling extremely uncomfortable. He turned around, still feeling the koala’s eyes on him.
“Very well, then.”
crotch. Damn it, why didn’t he keep his cloak on? He’d even take Potter’s bloody Gryffindor robes right now.
“Malfoy, you said—”
“You’re all I can think about.”
“I know at least one thing.”
That’s why, when Madam Pomfrey clears away their dinner plates, Harry gives in to the gnawing feeling in his chest.
“Oh god, please, I need—Nnngh! Please!”
“No,” Potter interrupted him. “That’s… um…” He bit his lip, looking unsure. “That’s the last thing I remember.”
Draco nods. He agrees. He can’t understand it either. The Dark Lord’s cackling, as the life is drained from his victims’ eyes, still haunts his dreams.
Potter seems to ponder that for a moment. “We were at the edge of the Forest when you heard it. Both times.”
Harry is torn between feeling bad and irritated as he listens to her stomp out of the hospital wing. It’s been two weeks. She must be frustrated as well. Maybe Harry should have shown a little more enthusiasm at the good news after all. But he doesn’t feel enthusiastic. At all.
“Sure,” Harry said with a smile. Wow, he hadn’t even given Draco the chance to give him some lame excuse.
Harry doesn’t even have to ask what she’s talking about. He looks down, his stomach twisting at the sight of the Grand Staircase basically being transformed into one gigantic lavender field.
“What the fuck, Potter!” Malfoy stomps his foot. “Did you seriously just put a fucking flower crown on my head?”
“It’s Malfoy.”
“I don’t think so,” Harry replies. He takes out his quill and parchment and keeps his eyes on Slughorn.
Draco arched an eyebrow. “And you think we won’t like you in your human form?”
“Fuck!” Draco inadvertently arched his back as Potter started to stroke him, letting his head fall back on Potter’s shoulder.
Draco coughed, feeling heat rush to his cheeks.
“What?” Creevey looked at him with wide eyes.
“I may have hated him,” Potter said quietly, “but he was your father. I know a thing or two about losing parents.”
“Oh.” He swallowed, his eyes locking with Draco’s. Draco drew in a sharp breath as he felt Potter’s erection pressing against his.
This strikes Harry as incredibly sad. That’s not what he’s been doing. Is it?
was the way to do it?” Potter yells. “God, for someone so intelligent, you’re such a fucking moron!”
“What rumours?” Harry asked, getting more and more irritated.
“I shouldn’t have done that. And I shouldn’t have— What I did to you… I think about it every day. And I want you to know I’m sor—” Before Harry can finish, there’s a finger on his lips. He inhales sharply and shakes his head.
“Oh, I—I didn’t mean—”
“What was what?”
. Seriously, it was all Potter’s fault. If the git hadn’t kissed him-
“Potter!” He takes a step forward as Potter closes his eyes, horror washing over him. “Potter!”
“Who’s the coward now?”
“Yes, about that.” Dumbledore sounds unusually stern. “Severus, do you know what happened in that bathroom?”
“Shut up, Blaise. And you,” Draco pointed a warning finger at Pansy, “you promised to keep your mouth shut. So much for that.”
The koala gave a squeak and hugged itself closer to Draco.
“What’s your name?”
That night, Harry pays extra attention to Draco’s body while they’re making love.
“Anyway,” Potter continues, “that’s not the real problem.”
“Merlin,” Draco wheezed, “this is just too absurd.”
Usually, he can deal with these kind of things on his own, but he’s tired of it. He’s so sick of being regarded as the Chosen One, a hero, when, in reality, he can barely hold it together. He doesn’t want his friends to see this side of him. They’ll start to worry, make a big thing out of it. They’ll try to help him, probably give him lots of unsolicited advice, whereas Malfoy might just laugh in his face. But, Harry thinks, that’s probably unlikely, given how scared he seemed when he talked to Myrtle about Voldemort.
He took a step backwards and Apparated to the Manor. He was still shaking with anger when he tossed his clothes on the floor and climbed into bed, completely ignorant to the fact that it was only seven o’clock.
“Malfoy,” he hisses. “Malfoy, wake up!” Harry has to say his name five more times before he jerks and finally stills.
“I know.”
“Don’t change the subject, you— Wait, what?”
“Oh.” At least that means she’s fine. Although Myrtle’s version of the story might be a hundred times more dramatic than what actually happened. As if it hadn’t been dramatic enough.
~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~
“Is—Is Baxter a boy or a girl?"
With his last energy, he hoists himself up and clutches, he hopes, the sink. His breathing is coming in painful pants now and before he can even begin to think straight, he’s heaving and suddenly tastes all the bitterness he has felt in the pit of his stomach for days.
“Well, believe me or not,” Harry said, tightening his grip on Draco again, “from now on, you won’t be able to get rid of me.”
“Firenze, I don’t mean to be rude,” Potter starts, “but you obviously know what’s going on here. Why can’t you just tell us?”
Draco blinked. What? What did Potter mean by ‘nice surprise’? Was he taking the piss?
“—but if he makes you happy, I’m on board.”
“Did I wake you?” Potter asks, his voice low. Draco’s heart skips a beat at the sound.
That’s the funniest thing about this, Harry thinks. Everyone is avoiding Malfoy and Harry is trying to avoid everyone. Everyone except Malfoy. At least when they’re alone.
“Something I never would have even considered,” Malfoy snorts and shakes his head. “Me, apparently.”
“Merlin’s saggy—”
“What?”
Wincing, Draco propped himself up on his elbows, glaring at the koala. “Did you seriously just headbutt me in the chest?”
“I—I’m sorry,” Potter mumbles.
“See you soon.”
Harry Potter was alive and that was all that mattered.
“I can’t believe I didn’t even get to see the guy. He’s going to be living in my room! I should have had a say in this.”
Countless people had called him beautiful, handsome, attractive… It usually meant nothing to Draco. He knew he was good looking. It wasn’t the compliment he was craving. And yet, the fact that
Draco frowned.
He doesn’t. He doesn’t. He doesn’t.
“I don’t whine,” Draco says indignantly. “Now feed me the damn—Whatever it is.”
“Just because Teddy let you sleep in his bed, doesn’t mean I’m—WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING?” Draco raised his hands as though he was being attacked. He kind of was. The koala was crawling onto him and before Draco knew it, it had wrapped its arms and legs around his midriff. “Are you fucking kidding me? I can’t sleep like this. You can’t sleep like this. Get off me!”
Draco watched as Potter mounted his broom and waved at him as he zoomed off.
“Hermione, no offence, but I’m not really in the mood to talk right now. Why don’t you go over to Ron?”
“What’s wrong?”
Draco’s heart jumps, but he tries to keep his face impassive. Is Potter ready for phase two of his plan? No, not yet. Draco has to make sure everything is in place first.
“Ugh, I don’t want to eat anything,” Harry croaks.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. Why was everything involving Potter always so irritating?
Potter didn’t respond immediately. He bit his lip and put his hand over Draco’s on his face. “I— I know what I want. At least, um—”
“Why did I just say that?” Malfoy whispered, horror-stricken.
“It’s—” Potter hesitates. “It’s the Resurrection Stone.”
They stayed in the armchair for hours that night, simply holding each other while Draco choked up several times. Maybe it would be best to try and keep his distance a little bit from now on. Maybe that would make the separation easier in the end. He didn’t know if he could do it, but it was the only thing he could do to keep his sanity intact.
“I know,” Harry says, his stomach giving a violent jolt. “Do you believe me now? Snape is evil!”
“What?”
“She didn’t say no, did she?”
Draco had to question himself, which he normally never did, the next day, when he sat in Transfiguration. When he looked up, his gaze automatically wandered over to where the Gryffindor’s sat, catching green eyes staring at him. Potter turned away quickly, knocking over his ink bottle with his elbow.
Draco’s eyes dart to the window, right beside the bed, where a screech owl is tapping its beak against the glass. He crawls forward, opens the window and unties the letter from the owl’s foot with nimble fingers. His eyes scan the words, relief washing over him. Nick finally has time for the firecall Draco suggested.
“It can be fun,” Harry said, not being able to contain his laughter any longer. Draco shot him another dark look, which only made Harry laugh louder.
“Um… something like that,” Draco said, shooting her an apologetic look over his shoulder.
Harry nods, even though he feels hopeless, and lets his head fall back. It sounds like they’re going to be stuck in here for a very long time.
“Yes,” he hisses and clutches Malfoy’s… arse, apparently. “Oh Merlin, please,
Potter shifts in his lap, rubbing his crotch against Draco’s while his tongue traces the seam between Draco’s lips.
“Yeah. People have deemed our parties the best,” Harry said, scratching the back of his neck. He just wanted to crawl back into bed. Cleaning was the last thing he wanted to do right now.
Draco looks unsure, but he nods his head ever so slightly before he turns around and walks to the door.
“So Stella went to the lake first?“ Draco asks.
Harry handed Draco another tissue before sitting down next to him. He lifted his hand and gently put it on Draco’s forehead.
“That’s what I thought. Malfoy, if you’re still feeling guilty—”
.” He jerks his chin towards Draco. “I thought it was only one-sided.”
“You’ll see,” Hagrid winks.
“I’m just going to the loo,” Ron yawns. “But don’t blame me if I’m gone for a while. I really need a break.”
Harry opens his mouth. Then closes it again. Then opens it again. All that comes out is a weird, embarrassing sound.
“What?”
Harry’s stomach plummets as Draco slowly narrows his eyes, his lips pressed into a tight line.
Potter pauses, but he doesn’t turn around. Draco’s lips stretch into a triumphant smirk, which quickly falters when he thinks he hears Potter mutter,
“The Headmistress is awaiting you in her office. With the information we’ve received, it appears you two will be staying there for a while.”
One night, he couldn’t take it anymore. He just couldn’t watch Harry go into his room and close the door.
“Please, Draco.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, was I supposed to send you a memo?” Potter said in an amused tone.
“What?”
Oooh!
It took Draco a while to calm down after that. When he peeked up at Harry, his eyes were puffy and his face blotchy.
As soon as Blaise had vanished, Draco’s gaze dropped down to the koala. He snorted when he saw it had its paws stretched out to him once more.
“Imagine what that would feel like on your cock,” Malfoy whispers.
“Now, if it had been your entire soul, I am certain the Whomping Willow would have turned out to be a good-natured tree spirit. However, since, as I suspect, it absorbed only the darkest part of your soul, it became dark in turn.”
“It was,” Potter said. “But… to me, it was more than that.”
He puts down the fork and lets his head fall onto the pillow. He ignores the lecture Madam Pomfrey gives him a few minutes later as she carries away his mostly untouched food.
“I guess I just can’t stay away from you,” Draco says, his voice low.
“Who?”
Draco whirled around and the koala gave a little squeak. Blaise was leaning against the doorframe, his eyes full of curiosity.
“Well, Draco? Is it him?”
“Yes, dear?”
“I’m coming with you.”
Potter shifts again. “I can’t help it if your—your arse is—”
Draco’s pulse quickens. It worked. It worked!
“What?”
Much too soon for Harry’s liking, Malfoy gets up and walks over to his bed. Harry listens as he gets under the covers and tries to ignore how weirdly empty his hand suddenly feels.
Malfoy blushed even more. “Whatever you did to me, Potter, you’ll pay for that!”
Potter burst out laughing, slapping Draco’s thigh. It was so nice seeing him like this. Before Draco could say anything else, Potter reached out and cupped both of his cheeks with his hands.
“You’ve never been in my kitchen.”
Thanks for reading :)
“You—You know?” Harry asks, dumbstruck.
“Yeah… Kinda risky, running a magical school in the city, isn’t it?”
feelings aren’t on the line, isn’t something Harry wants to think about for too long. Instead, he slowly lowers his head until his forehead joins his hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“Huh?”
Ginny throws her hands in the air. “Like he’s the greatest invention since treacle tart!”
“Oh, I think we can make use of them in a much better way,” Potter chuckled, burying his hands in Draco’s hair. Draco groaned. He couldn’t believe this was really happening. After all this time. Finally!
“Like I said, Potter, these scars are part of the past. But they’re also part of who I am today. They’re a good reminder, you know.”
“Oh, fuck!”
Funnily enough, he doesn’t feel that wary about the Forbidden Forest. Even though he technically died in there, it’s kind of a reminder that he was able to overcome the impossible. Plus, the Forest is so full of life, Harry developed new appreciation for it. It’s still a bit scary sometimes, but for the most part, it also feels like home now.
Relief floods through him. He knows it isn’t as easy as that. He knows there’s is still much to do and talk about. But hopefully, this time, Draco will be there with him.
Harry chokes on the cake in his mouth, obviously trying no to burst out laughing.
As he reached for the doorknob, his eyes fell to the koala once more. It had stretched out its little arms. Was it… asking to be picked up? To be cuddled?
“Why is it called the Wise Monkeys?”
“Ron, I haven’t—”
“You’re not coughing them up, are you?”
“I’m serious. I can already feel everything creeping back. I don’t want to feel any of it.”
“That was… different,” he whispers.
“Yeah,” Draco said, clearing his throat.
“I’m—I’m not sure.” He turns to Draco, his eyes wide. “You didn’t feel anything?”
“Let’s not get into that,” Draco said, waving a dismissive hand in the air. “All I’m saying is… children like you or me only know what their parents, um, or guardians taught them until they arrive at Hogwarts. I know from first-hand experience how that can turn into a problem. We can’t eradicate prejudices or idiocy, but we can teach children to be more open-minded.” He tried to appear as nonchalant as possible while Potter kept staring at him. “It’s pretty simple,” Draco continued, mostly to fill the awkward silence. “Basically, Muggle-borns learn about magic before they come to Hogwarts and pure-bloods learn more about Muggles. Most importantly, they do it together.”
Sweet Mother of Merlin!
“If only I knew, Minerva.”
“Would you rather I kissed your dot goodnight before I go to sleep?” Harry counters. But… wait…
Potter let out a sigh. “I guess I should have been more open with you.”
“Malfoy, do you want me to touch you?”
He isn’t sure, at first, if he’s imagining something pressing into his back and the warmth on his cheek, until he tries to turn his head and finds that he can’t. Because Potter’s cheek is pressing into his, his arms are around Draco once more. He’s drawing circles on Draco’s back with his palms rather awkwardly.
“You little shit,” Draco growled.
“Oh, I see,” Draco said, bending over a little. “Oh yeah, that’s much better. It’s like- pfffffffff!”
Draco feels himself go rigid when Potter moves his head and lets out a low moan.
“God, Draco, I—” Potter groans into his mouth.
“This is our first date. We can’t just—” Harry breaks off, biting his lip.
Draco flinched. “He hurt me,” he murmured.
“What?” Potter snaps, and it makes Draco halt. He looks him in the eye, not liking what he’s seeing there.
“What? What is it? Is it the unicorns? Are the fairies bothering them again?”
It’s a stone. It has a strange symbol on it. Draco can’t recall having seen it before. Damn it, Draco shouldn’t have touched it. What if it’s a dark artefact?
Potter has always been this unwanted constant in his life, something inevitable and something he wasted far too much time thinking about. It doesn’t really help to get all this information now. His mind is reeling, wandering off to dark places Draco doesn’t want to be confronted with.
“I’m sorry,” Draco blurted. Even though he had used those two words more in the last four years than ever before in his life, they still felt foreign on his tongue. He watched carefully as Potter’s face went blank.
“How much?” Draco repeated, getting a little impatient. “You just took a bunch of pictures of… Potter.” Draco made sure to put as much venom into the name as possible. Creevey’s face twisted in confusion.
“Sometimes… Sometimes, everything just gets to be too much.”
“What?” Harry blurts, completely taken aback.
He starts running as fast as his wobbly legs can carry him, mentally pleading that he won’t be there too late. He almost trips a couple of times, but his mind is so fixated on getting to Potter, it doesn’t really register. He stumbles down the hill, his heart almost leaping out of his chest when he finally sees the Whomping Willow. And Potter.
He lets go of Malfoy’s hand and slowly shrugs out of his pyjama. It lands on the floor with a splash. Harry shivers, even though he doesn’t feel cold. He can feel Malfoy’s breath on his face, sending a tingling down his spine that reaches all the way down to the tip of his toes. That’s when he remembers he’s still wearing slippers. He corrects that a moment later, kicking them off. He pauses as his thumbs slip beneath the waistband of his pyjama bottoms. The air seems to be crackling around them. It’s almost too much.
Well, that was easier said than done. Harry kept moving, ever so slightly, and basically rubbed himself against Draco. Oh God, this was not good! Harry was basically feeding the beast. But without giving it what it wanted.
“Oh… Oh no.” Realisation hit Draco hard, like a Bludger to the head. “I’m such an idiot,” he murmured to himself.
“Like you don’t have one as well,” Draco retorts. He blinks when Potter flicks his wand wordlessly and the dividing wall vanishes.
Draco sighs, mentally opting out of Potter’s questioning. His eyes roam the tables; it’s much quieter than he expected. Many students are huddled up together and the Hall is filled with hushed whispers. It’s only been two days since the last student vanished. They’re probably frightened.
“That bad?” Draco asks, raising an eyebrow. “Is it Robards?”
Harry nearly tells her off, but then she walks over to them and throws her arms around Malfoy’s neck.
“Draco! Stop!”
“I’m still here, aren’t I?”
“Nice touch,” Draco laughs and nods in approval. This evening will be perfect. Absolutely perfect. Except for the fact that Potter is late. Of course he is.
“If you’re not, I can—”
Draco blinks. “What?”
Malfoy twists around, keeping his hands in Harry’s hair. “Yes, boss?”
“You know how it is with us reporters, we never rest.”
“Please.”
Potter lets out a sigh and turns back to the window. His shoulders seem tense as he presses one of his palms against the glass. “I slept with him,” he says quietly.
Rolling his eyes when hears something else about Shepherd's Pie, Draco swings his legs over the edge of his bed and trudges into the bathroom. He splashes his face with cold water over and over again. It doesn’t feel refreshing. It’s almost painful.
“Summon a book or something,” Harry barks.
“I thought we had something,” he whispered. “I—I thought—” His mind was screaming at him to stop, to not make himself more vulnerable. But what else did he have to lose? “Maybe I should have been more open about my feelings,” he murmured. He pulled back and tipped Potter’s head back, forcing him to look at him. “We could have found a way. Together. We could have—I mean, I didn’t really know what we were doing, but… you didn’t even give us a chance. Do I really mean nothing to you?” He stared into Potter’s empty eyes, panic and trepidation coiling in the pit of his stomach. “You selfish bastard.” He buried his face in Potter’s fur, his resolution not to break down sobbing crumbling more and more.
“What, you want to free some house-elves, too?” Draco quipped. He watched as the koala leaned forward and sniffed at the paper. Draco frowned. What was it doing? He paused when the koala stretched out one of its paws and gently put it on Granger’s bushy hair.
There’s a moment of silence, in which Draco considers going outside and digging a hole in the pumpkin patch, so he can bury himself in it and never come out again.
“I want you so much,” Potter whispers.
Draco snorted, his cheeks getting warm again, but this time, it wasn’t from anger.
“Pfft,” Draco scoffed automatically. “Who said anything about liking you.”
“I—I didn’t—I just—I didn’t know that it could do that.”
Not wanting to make a scene, Draco reluctantly stays silent and hurries after Potter, swallowing down the pain as best he can. As soon as they’re alone, Draco will give him a piece of his mind. Potter won’t know what hit him. The arrogant prat.
“You said I should leave you alone,” Harry says quietly, looking down at his hands.
“Use me,” he breathes into his face. Draco stares at him, trying to make sense of all the emotions rushing through him. “Use me,” Potter repeats, tilting his head, as though to invite Draco to kiss his neck. Draco gulps. Can he do this? Can he do this without giving himself away? He blinks when Potter pulls back. Within seconds, Potter gets rid of his trousers. And his pants. Merlin. He’s completely naked. He lies back, grabs Draco’s wrist and pulls him down with him. Draco tries to stay balanced; he’s on all fours with Potter lying underneath him. Merlin.
“You’re so full of yourself,” Harry snorts.
“We’ve all been through a lot. And I’m responsible for so many—”
“Merlin, Potter, you have no idea.”
Oh, thank Merlin!
“How is that—”
And then he feels it, Malfoy’s lips softly brushing his. He’s teasing Harry, giving him a little taste, but not quite kissing him. It’s frustrating. It’s exhilarating. He inhales sharply and a low moan rumbles through his chest. Malfoy pulls away and Harry wants to grab him and crush their lips together. But he doesn’t. He waits, inwardly screaming, wondering if that’s all Malfoy is going to do.
Harry freezes. Malfoy’s wounds.
“What?” Draco snapped.
“Did you, or did you not, send a letter to my mother?”
“What the bloody hell is that?”
“So… what you’re saying is… you like my jawline.”
“What? This is ridiculous.”
He kept his eyes on her as Hermione strode over to him.
Draco shook his head, his smile widening as he looked at the drawing. He instantly recognised Teddy and his turquoise hair and also himself. Wedged between them was Baxter; Teddy and Draco were each holding one of the koala’s paws. His heart sank a little at the sight. Teddy was counting on him.
Harry frowns, wondering why Ron sounds so awkward. He gets his answer when the door swings open, revealing blond hair—flower-free—and Slytherin robes.
Potter almost toppled over backwards, his mouth hanging open.
“I know.”
“This is insane,” he murmurs once more as he starts to unbutton his trousers. He pushes them down, along with his pants, and kicks them aside. Penelope squeaks at him.
“You’re lucky you’re so cute,” Potter murmurs, “otherwise I wouldn’t let you boss me around like this.”
“Malfoy,” he breathes, chuckling when Malfoy doesn’t stop kissing him, even though Harry’s nudging him to pull away. “Malfoy.” He feels his features twisting into a more serious expression, his heart pounding violently as Malfoy gazes at him in contentment. “Malfoy, I think—I think I might be falling in love with you. Or maybe… I already have.”
As relieved as Draco was, part of him was also irritated at how quickly Potter had agreed. Wasn’t that what he wanted? Was he already tired of it? Well, it wasn’t like Draco was dying to be cuddled. Not even in the slightest. Especially not by Potter.
And there it is again, the anger. It turns into fury.
Malfoy probably doesn’t know what happened just now. Or maybe he does. There have been enough articles in the Daily Prophet, questioning Harry’s sanity. Articles based on rumours, Harry reminds himself, Malfoy has helped spread. Given their current circumstances, that does feel like child’s play now. Still, it makes Harry tense up. But Malfoy keeps doing this, acting like he’s worried about Harry’s well-being. Maybe it is just that, an act.
“Nooooooo!”
“Ugh, Robards isn’t going to be happy about this,” Potter says, making a beeline for one of the barn owls.
He throws the socks to the foot of the bed and rakes his fingers through his hair. He sits there for a few minutes, not knowing what to do with himself. Of course Malfoy doesn’t want to keep him company. One brief conversation, which, really, had actually been a monologue on Harry’s end, and a bit of hand-holding don’t mean anything. But, why had Malfoy done it? It would have made things so much easier, if he had just left the first time. Harry wouldn’t be so confused and he wouldn’t be so downcast because Draco bloody Malfoy doesn’t want to talk to him.
“It—What?”
“That’s not—Draco!”
He peers over at Draco, wondering if he’ll ask Harry to leave. But that would mean he’d have to stop ignoring him and that, apparently, isn’t going to happen. Partly relieved, and partly irritated, Harry takes his quill and scowls at his parchment.
“Right,” Malfoy smirks. “You must really like it, then, since you live on the other side of town.”
He keeps having these dreams about Malfoy, disturbing ones, in which he scoots closer, lays his head on Harry’s shoulder, or wraps his arms around him. It always results in confusion and Harry being flustered in the morning. Because dream-Harry really seems to like what Malfoy is doing.
“Fuck you, Potter! You act so high and mighty, but you told me you just wanted to be friends.”
Draco peered at Potter from under his lashes. He looked a bit nervous.
“Great. Come over to mine at seven. I’ll cook dinner.”
, Harry thinks with a cringe. He’s the only one who nearly killed someone. But, again, Malfoy was about to fire an Unforgivable Curse at him. That git. And now, he’ll probably try to kill Harry. At least the teachers confiscated their wands. But still, it would be so easy, being in the bed next to him and everything, for Malfoy to just silently slip out of bed at night and smother Harry to death with a pillow or something.
“I should go up there, shouldn’t I?”
“Oh!” Potter noticed them, too. “Fairies,” he breathes. “I’ve never seen so many at once before.”
“You remember? I thought you didn’t remember.”
“Well, I have to get up pretty early tomorrow,” Harry lies. “Not that this hasn’t been fun.”
“If you want him to forgive you, you’ll have to convince me first.”
“I didn’t expect to see you here,” he continued.
“Merlin’s beard,” the dark-haired bloke exclaims. “You’re Harry Potter.”
The ripping sound intensifies.
“She’s still unconscious.”
“Yeah, me neither. I mean, I didn’t have anything really. I guess that’s the big difference between us.”
Harry says nothing to that, his mind inadvertently wandering back to what Malfoy just told him. Harry has to like him? Doesn’t he like him? Is it not enough? Ugh, this is bloody confusing. Also. Malfoy didn’t say anything about having to like Harry. Is that because Harry’s the one who cast the spell? Probably. Which brings him back to the question — who does Malfoy like? Harry can barely concentrate on anything else the rest of the night. He keeps peeking at Malfoy out of the corner of his eye, trying to picture him with… someone. Anyone. He finds that he can’t. No matter who he pictures him with, something seems to be off about it. Like… Malfoy doesn’t really fit with anyone.
Bedtime rolls around much earlier than Harry would have preferred. It feels awkward, standing in front of the sink, brushing his teeth with Malfoy next to him. Well, the most awkward thing is undoubtedly taking a piss with Malfoy right behind him. Thank god for silencing charms. And it’s not like Malfoy hasn’t already had a good look at Harry’s arse. That tosser!
“I— I can’t—” Stubbornly, he tried to hold back the tears that were forming in his eyes.
“I guess she felt bad for me. She read your report.”
“Yaaaaaay!” Celia started jumping up and down, clapping her hands together. It didn’t take long until Teddy joined in.
“Yeah, well— No, you know what, let’s not get into that. It’s in the past. I forgave you, you forgave me.”
“I’M GOING TO KILL YOU!”
“How domestic of me.”
“Stop complaining, Malfoy. It won’t change anything,” Terry Boot called from across the dorm. Their newly shared dorm. One student from each house, that was the new rule. Dumbledore had announced it two weeks ago and Harry’s only consolation was that he was still in Gryffindor tower, in his own bed, while the other Gryffindors had moved into other dorms.
“Hmpf.”
“No, not the gummy bears,” Potter breathes.
“That’s my line,” Harry grins.
“Well.” Malfoy rubs his temple. “I guess we don’t really need any books.”
Draco snorts.
“You know what, you go through what he’s been through, then we can talk again!”
“Uh.”
“I—What do you mean?”
Yet again, all Harry can do is stare at her.
Harry only hopes he won’t have to see it. It seems like forever until the screaming finally stops. But instead of being relieved, an irrational fear bubbles up inside Harry’s chest. He knows Draco didn’t die, but the sudden silence makes it seem like Voldemort has finished what he started.
“Come on, if we go now, we can still— Draco?”
“Um, what?”
Nobody had gone as far as to declare him dead, but every once in a while, he read a crazy story about how he got attacked by dragons somewhere in Bulgaria and was suffering from amnesia. Of course they would turn the whole thing into a massive, tragic sob story. People loved that, apparently. And given how crazy his life had been up until then, it actually wasn’t that hard to believe. But in reality, his life had turned out to be anything but a tragedy.
“Is something wrong?” Potter puts down the letter.
“Can we please not dwell on this? This is embarrassing enough,” Potter said, pressing his body against Draco’s. “So, you still haven’t answered my question. Would you kiss me again?”
Sighing deeply, Harry pats Ron’s forearm before lying back down on the bed. He hears Ron return to his own. Part of him wholeheartedly agrees with his best friend. Who actually slaps a blind person? Wait, not blind. Just… unable to open his eyes.
“This? This is where he lives now? This is a joke, right?”
“Yes, I’ve been meaning to have a word with Uncle Charlie about that,” Hermione said, looking less stern than she sounded.
“Is that who I think it is?”
“I don’t think we can keep the school open any longer,” McGonagall says. “We need to send the children home in the morning.”
“Malfoy,” he breathed.
“I don’t think it’s going to fit into our house, sweetheart.”
“So… you’re not opposed to being… physical?”
“Oh.” Draco had no idea what else to say.
“Right.
“I think we should pick a spot near the Forest,” Potter says. “Maybe beside the pumpkin patch.”
“Good,” Potter grins. “Come here.” He stretches out his hands and waits until Draco takes them. He pulls him up and Draco realises Potter wants them to switch places. He raises an eyebrow when Potter lies down on his back and takes off his glasses.
“Fuck!”
“Don’t play dumb,” Harry says with a scowl. “I know exactly what you were doing in there.”
“Sit down,” Malfoy snaps and pushes him into one of the chairs.
With a swift hand pressed against Ron’s mouth, Harry silences him. He puts his index finger to his own lips, fixing his friend with a glare. And then he waits.
“I know. But it’s obvious how much you miss it.”
seeing someone?” Potter called after him.
“I love our Friday afternoon kisses,” Harry murmurs.
“I don’t care,” Draco growled. He waited until Potter slowly removed his fingers and moved to adjust himself.
“You’re trying to manipulate me, but I won’t feel sorry for you, I—”
“Okay, good,” Harry mumbles in relief, feeling like an idiot. Malfoy shivers against him, prompting Harry to tighten his arms around him.
As if Potter had just read his mind, he asked, “If I take off your trousers, will you destroy my whole bedroom?”
“I guess,” he finally whispers.
Potter stares at him.
“Of course you’d take it that way,” Draco mutters under his breath as they ascend the stairs to the Entrance Hall.
Before he knows what he’s doing, he’s pulling him into a tight embrace, burying his face into his neck, wishing he would never have to let go.
“Holy—”
“Outside my bedroom,” Draco whispered.
God, he wants to kiss him. He wants to kiss him so badly.
He sees him in the library, watches him as he stares at one page for almost an hour. He deliberates leaving him alone but he just can’t help himself. He sits down beside him, takes his book and starts reading it to him.
Draco feels Potter’s legs jerk beneath his arse. He startles when Potter’s warm come oozes down his fingers. He finds himself unable to move; it’s like his hand is frozen on Potter’s cock. It takes another few moments until Potter has caught his breath while Draco just stares at his own hand like an idiot. He only realises Potter has grabbed his wand when he’s pointing it at his own cock.
Draco felt his lips stretch into a smile as he watched his flatmate approach, a bowl of popcorn in one hand and a blanket in the other. They were so in sync by now, they barely needed any words to know what the other needed. Draco took the bowl from Harry while he draped the blanket over the both of them.
“I would never let that happen. You’re my best friend.”
“What?”
“Is this a joke, Potter?”
Malfoy sighs. “Potter.” He squeezes his hand. “Only you can be such a massive dolt.”
Potter blinked some more, before he rolled his eyes and his lips stretched into a lopsided smile. “Clearly, you haven’t lost your charming modesty,” he snorted.
“Happy birthday, Harry!”
“Be patient with him, Draco,” she whispered.
Heart pounding, Harry hurries out of the Room of Requirement. He has no idea what to make of this. He knows some people are obsessed with him, but this? This is a bit much! And he still hasn’t figured out what Malfoy is doing in there!
“How is that not—” Weasley breaks off when Granger throws him an admonishing look.
“But I don’t.”
The room falls silent, and for a moment Harry thinks Malfoy has finally drifted off to sleep. But then.
“Whatever,” he spat. He was so mad, he couldn’t even look at Potter. “Don’t be late.”
“The Manor.”
Now Draco really wants to throw something at him. But he knows that would only get him into trouble. So instead, he takes his Charms textbook, opens it at random and starts ripping out page after page.
“Just tell me what’s going on, Harry! Didn’t you hear what McGonagall said? I think there might be a good chance the potion will work.”
“This is important!”
Draco lets out a long breath he didn’t realise he had been holding. Potter shakes his head ever so slightly, and then, something strange happens. Draco tightens his grip on Potter when he feels a tremor go through his body.
Malfoy gives a quick jerk, as if he just coughed. Or maybe he snorted, Harry isn’t sure. He knows this is absurd, but what else can they do?
“Oh? What happened?” He watches gleefully as Potter scrunches up his nose.
“How about I wait for you in the common room after everyone has gone to bed?”
“Rightfully so. This was a mistake.”
He buries his face in the crook of Malfoy’s neck as the Slytherin’s movements become more frantic and he pants down Harry’s neck. Harry lets his fingers wander upwards, until they slip beneath Malfoy’s pyjamas and clutches at his back. Malfoy presses his cheek against his and Harry shivers as the hot breath tickles his ear. He wishes he could hear Malfoy moan, hear his voice as he loses control. Instead, Harry is the one moaning as Malfoy pushes his cock against Harry’s with frantic urgency.
“You fucking arsehole.”
“Not really,” Potter murmurs. “It’s… No, it feels different. This anger… it feels familiar. I just—I don’t know how to explain it.”
This must be a dream.
Draco’s eyes are suddenly impossibly wide as Harry cups his cheek, mirroring the gesture the Slytherin had almost done to him.
fault they’re in this mess. It hasn’t escaped Harry that Malfoy didn’t answer his question. Then again, he was probably just being nosy and trying to spy on Harry. That git.
“I do,” she shrugged, her lips stretching into a smile. “But it’s nice seeing you being passionate. You’re usually so stiff.”
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Draco says, turning away from him and feeling his cheeks burn up.
“Merlin, Potter.” Malfoy sighs and closes his book. “I’m not trying to start a fight, so I’m going to say this as nicely as possible. You and your enormous ego need to accept that you aren’t the answer to every bloody problem on this planet.”
“Not exactly,” Harry admits. “But I will.” Eventually.
“There you are! I’ve been looking all over for you!”
Harry leans forward, feeling a zing go through him when his nose touches Malfoy’s. He hesitates, waits for Malfoy to push him away or take a step back or do anything that tells Harry he doesn’t want this, but he’s staying perfectly still, maybe he’s even holding his breath, and Harry wants to scream because he can hear his erratic pulse rushing in his ears and his head is going to explode and he really can’t stand this and he just… he has to do this.
against his skin.
“Hold on, is that why you wouldn’t come out of your room for a week, after I told you about that date I had with a Muggle a few months ago?”
It takes a moment for Harry to realise that this basically means he’s going to die as well. There’s no cure. And according to this story, he’s… he’s… with Malfoy! God, no!
“Sounds an awful lot like what he said.” Draco jerks his head in the direction Firenze disappeared to.
“Doesn’t matter,” the Death Eater replies and pushes Draco aside.
“Dear Merlin.” Another sigh. “I really have to explain everything to you, don’t I?”
Draco snorted but hurried up the stairs and made his way to Teddy’s room. Of course he had a room at the Manor. The second Narcissa and Andromeda had made up, she and Teddy became frequent guests. It hadn’t taken long before Teddy had asked to sleep over. And while he had been content with sleeping in Draco’s room the first few years, Narcissa insisted he get his own as he had grown older.
It took so much effort not to move, not to break out into tears, not to shiver from Potter’s gentle touch.
Annoyance flickered over the wizard’s face, which he quickly tried to mask with a smile.
~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~
In the distance, he heard Malfoy scream after him.
It’s the last thought he has before he closes his eyes and welcomes the darkness.
“Wait, who are we talking about?” Harry asks.
“It was nice, not being in control for once,” Harry shrugs. “Or rather, not having to be.”
Harry heard Terry snort.
Harry snorts.
“Um…”
“Allowing?” Harry echoed. “Excuse me, but what exactly do you think we are doing here? We’re just flatmates. I’m not the boss of him.”
“Fuck, you feel so good,” Potter moans. He starts moving, slamming into Draco hard.
Potter raises an eyebrow, as though he’s challenging Draco.
“Expecting you? What? I—” No. What? No way!
“Stay here,” he commands. “Whatever you do, don’t leave the tent.”
“What is it?” Malfoy whispers, his eyes boring into Harry’s. “What is it that’s bothering you so much?”
The koala’s answer was to bump its head against Draco’s jaw.
He decides to look for him in the room by the kitchens, but he stops dead when he sees flaming red hair vanish behind a corner.
“I just remembered this bedtime story my mum read to me a few times when I was little. The book was my dad’s and it was too painful for her to read it, that’s why I only heard it a couple of times, but I remember there was something in there about flowers and how they appeared spontaneously. Anyway, I asked my mum to send it to me.”
He pays careful attention to his hand, currently resting against his collarbone. Under no circumstances is it to touch Potter’s. He has to make sure of it.
Harry can’t deny he’s enjoying it. Very much. But it hasn’t escaped his notice that Malfoy is still clutching the small of his back and hasn’t moved his hands an inch.
“Give me some of that,” Draco says as soon as the disgusting bean sprouts are gone.
arse, didn’t I?”
“No?” Harry all but squeaks. “Your hand is, um—” What? What exactly was he about to say? God, this is awful.
“Do you like the new one? You’ve been whining about it so much, I thought I’d just replace that awful old-timer.”
As much as Draco would have liked to wake up entangled with Potter, this isn’t such a bad alternative. Not at all.
The kiss turned from tender to heated within seconds. Draco bit back a moan when Potter’s hips started grinding against his. His cock was already half hard and if Potter kept moving like that, Draco was sure he’d be coming in his pants in just a few minutes.
“I am not sick,” Draco growled. He turned his back to Harry and made his way to the sofa, plopping down on it.
“There’s, um, one last person I’d like to set you up with.”
Draco threw back his head, laughing, and wrapped his arms around Potter’s neck. “If you ask nicely, I’ll let you stalk me in the hallways and my quarters as well.”
“You’ve
“Not love?” Harry asks before he can stop himself. Dumbledore is probably smiling at him.
His eyes are closed, Harry notices, but he’s furrowing his brow every now and then, accompanied by a drawn-out exhale. This, Harry decides, is the most arousing thing he’s ever seen. He can feel his own excitement growing and just when he decides to touch himself as well, Draco lets out a low moan, and Harry, almost falling over, thinks he might come in his pants, completely untouched.
“Is it supposed to vibrate like that?” Draco asked in astonishment.
“It’s not like I haven’t thought about it before, I just… never had the opportunity, I guess.”
“Can’t you just tell us what we’re dealing with here?” Draco says, a little impatiently. “Have you seen it?”
Malfoy cuts him off with a scorching kiss. Merlin, how does he do that? How does his tongue feel so soft and yet so fierce?
“But where did it lure him? Ugh, this is driving me mad!”
Ah, Draco has been wondering about that. “Yeah?”
“You have no idea what you’re—”
Draco sighed and put the letter down on his desk. He let his gaze drift over to the eucalyptus branches where Baxter sat with its back turned to him. That koala was really stubborn.
“Potter!” Draco draws his wand. “Diffindo,” he shouts, waiting for the branches to break. They don’t. “Impedimenta! Petrificus Totalus! Stupefy! His voice breaks. None of the spells are working. Is the Whomping Willow immune to them? Is it because it’s a tree spirit now? “Finite Incantatem!”
.” Potter tried to keep a straight face, but couldn’t suppress a snicker. “I might even let you touch my
Draco rolls his eyes. “I’ll make sure they’re taken into custody before they wake up. And you,” he points a finger at Potter, “you go back to the Ministry and report to Robards. No arguing, Potter! I can’t believe you cast
“That’s what you want to do, isn’t it? Hit me!”
“Hush!” Draco looked around anxiously. If anyone found out about this… “Just tell me how much you want for them.”
“Exactly,” Potter said with a loud exhale. He propped up his elbow on the bar, leaning his head against his hand. “But do tell me, what
Great. Now he’s naked. In front of his cabin. With Malfoy behind him. Supposedly naked as well. Merlin’s balls.
“I don’t think it’s guys in general,” he breathes before he pulls Malfoy down to him and finally,
“I would, if you tell me where the coffee machine is,” Potter grinned, shrugging off his coat. “You do have a coffee machine, right?”
“Draco?”
“Did—Did you hear that?” Draco breathes.
“Everything I need is in here,” he says, tapping his index finger to his temple.
They jump apart, Draco’s heart slamming against his chest. Madam Pomfrey rushes over and studies him, her fingers cool against his face. And yet, Draco feels his cheeks heating up; Potter is holding his hand, even though Madam Pomfrey can see.
“Hey, I didn’t know what else to do, okay?”
“Well,” Draco said with a sniff. “You agreed.”
Harry shudders when Malfoy lets out another breath and gently tugs at his hair.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled. He quickly turned his head back down Diagon Alley, searching for grey eyes but there were just too many people.
“Oh, you know, I was in the neighbourhood,” she shrugs.
“Well, you can’t sleep here.”
“Biting your lip like that.”
Potter makes a noise somewhere in the back of his throat.
It’s hard not to regret his decision when his mother lies in a pool of her own blood shortly after, his father lying knocked out beside her, and Draco screams at the top of his lungs as the Dark Lord tortures him. Still, he couldn’t have let the Dark Lord kill Potter. It was the right thing to do, aside from his selfish reasons.
Harry jumps when Malfoy suddenly shuts him up by pressing his hand on his mouth.
“I’m not sure if I’m asking for too much,” he murmurs quietly. “I don’t even know what the hell we’re doing here. But…” He takes a deep breath. “I don’t like it when you leave.” He swallows. “ I— I want you.” He swallows again. “Here. I want you here,” he adds hastily, feeling too vulnerable again.
Potter scowled at the table.
With one hand on the wall and one hand outstretched in front of him, he makes his way through the castle. He hates being so slow. He can hear students chattering from afar, and suddenly, he wishes he hadn’t left the hospital wing after all. He’s still in his pyjamas and he’s blind for crying out loud. Do the other students know about that?
“So… what, you don’t care?”
“Sorry,” Hermione says sheepishly.
“What do you mean?”
“What? That’s disgusting!”
Oh. Something’s off. Potter stopped moving. Draco’s eyes lock with his and the intensity of his stare is almost enough to make him come on the spot.
He stays completely still as Potter moves closer and lets out a shaky breath.
“Oh, well… We could try and study together. I could read to you from the textbooks,” she offers.
“Oh my,” Ginny chuckles. “You’d think Ron has a sunburn already.”
“HARRY JAMES POTTER!!!”
Potter made a gurgling sound and bit down on his lip. Hard. The sight sent sparks down Draco’s spine.
“But you will. You’ll tell me you have no choice. Because your fucked up family will—”
Draco said nothing. It did mean a lot to him and it was such a strange feeling to be sharing it with Potter.
“She did at first,” Ginny confirms. “But when she realised I wouldn’t go until she agreed, she said yes. Very grudgingly so, but still.”
“Ah, girl, then.”
“Just one tree. We have no idea which one or how it ties into this whole mess.”
They both jump as the door to the hospital wing bursts open, revealing three very angry looking figures.
Draco can’t believe he lost control like that. He’s been so stupid.
“Oh,” Harry says. Unsure of what to do, he just mumbles, “Um, okay.”
“You think I’m disgusting!” He pushed Potter away and hastily zipped up his trousers. “You just wanted a quick one-off. Of course! I’m not good enough for anything else!”
“So, this is what a headmaster’s office looks like.”
Draco couldn’t tell if Potter was displeased or not. At least he had only found out part of the truth.
The pressure of Potter’s lips isn’t as powerful as his hand, but, oh, does he make up for it with his tongue.
The silence that follows feels stifling. Potter always has so much to say, why is he staying quiet now?
“Because I don’t think you would have opened up to me the way you did if I hadn’t accidentally turned myself into an animal. I guess it helps that I’m such an adorable creature.”
He startles out of his trance when his ears pick up a strange noise. A hiss that fills him with dread.
“Well, I think Hermione nailed it, mate.”
“Hold your hippogriffs, Malfoy.”
Draco snorts.
This is, Draco imagines, what it must feel like to get hit in the chest by a Bludger.
“Ron and I drank Polyjuice Potion.”
“For fuck’s sake, Potter!”
But now, as Draco stands in front of him, Harry is smiling at him fondly. Merlin, Draco just never tires of that smile. Even after all these years.
“Ten points to Hufflepuff,” Draco deadpans and removes an invisible lint from his sleeve.
Draco balls his hands into fists.
“Don’t be—”
“I’m not,” Harry mumbles against Draco’s hand.
Malfoy makes a weird sound. And then—
“Um. Nothing,” he murmurs. “Nothing you’d understand.”
“Alright, here we go.” Slowly, he lowered it and let out a gasp when the vibration intensified.
“I—” Harry has no idea what to say to that. He’s never looked at it that way. And yet, he feels caught. But, somehow, it feels like Malfoy’s being the vulnerable one here. Harry wonders what made him feel like it’s okay to open up all of a sudden.
“Why didn’t you use magic?” he asked timidly.
Potter nods.
Malfoy. If Harry had known what that spell would do, he never would have used it. Right?
“Potter, Malfoy. I wish I could say I’m glad to see you. Well, at least I wish it were under better circumstances.” McGonagall greets them both with a warm handshake and gestures for them to sit down.
He climbs out of bed, feeling grumpy and groggy. He hates having to get out of bed in the middle of the night. And now that he can’t see anything, it’s even worse. He grumbles under his breath, and keeps his fingers on his bed as he slowly starts to walk. He knows it’s simple. The bathroom is straight ahead. All he has to do is keep walking. But, Harry realises, it’s hard without having someone to guide him. He feels extremely stupid, with his hands outstretched in front of him, feeling the air, waiting for his hands to connect with the wall. Only, they don’t.
“Where did you—Oh!” He almost stumbled when he felt something warm on his leg. “And what exactly do you think you’re doing?” he asked, fixing the blinking button eyes with a glare. Before he could move to put the koala back where it came from, it curled its little paws around a trouser leg… and yanked.
“No,” Draco said promptly. “I want to see you.” It was the second time he’d said this, and, surprisingly, he didn’t feel as embarrassed about it as he thought he would have.
Blaise and Pansy started snickering, elbowing each other. Harry wasn’t sure what was going on.
“That’s why he’s being so weird?”
“Aaah!”
Draco inwardly smirked. Potter’s voice was dripping with disapproval. “I already have plans.”
“Um… yes?”
“I— I’m not—” He kept his eyes on their joined hands. “I— I quit the Auror program.” His face twisted, as though he was in pain. “I’m sorry.”
“Look, I don’t care about your love life, just… keep it down, will you?” Feeling too hot and too irritated to look at Malfoy any longer, Harry jumps off the sofa and marches into his room. He flops onto his bed, blinking at the ceiling.
He steps closer once more, until their bodies are pressed against each other and their foreheads are touching.
“You sleep here almost every night. I don’t even remember the last time you slept in your own bed.”
“Oh?”
Potter made a sound that almost sounded like a sob.
Madam Pomfrey insists on Harry spending the night in the hospital wing, and after a visit by a very agitated Hermione and a grumbling Ron, Harry is more than ready to let his head fall onto the pillow and pass out.
To Harry’s astonishment, Malfoy doesn’t seem surprised. His lips simply stretch into a smile, a genuine one, and he leans down once more to claim Harry’s mouth, his entire existence.
“Potter, there’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
Was he implying… he swung both ways? Merlin’s pants!
An hour and a half later, Harry stomps back into the cabin with Malfoy at his heels.
“What do you think you’re doing?” he snapped, slapping Harry’s hand away and smoothing down his robes.
Did Malfoy even understand that mumbled gibberish? Should he say it again?
“Well, I was here first,” Malfoy said defiantly.
“They’re waiting in the kitchen.”
“Would you mind if I take a look at them?”
And Draco couldn’t help wondering what that would be like… letting his fingers slip underneath Harry’s shirt, caressing his stomach… moving his hand to his back, sliding his fingers up and down his spine. At that point, he’d probably take off Harry’s shirt. What noises would Harry make if Draco started kissing his chest? He’d have one hand buried in Harry’s hair and move his mouth up to his neck from time to time, before slowly moving down again.
“Yeah,” Harry murmurs absentmindedly as he unfolds the note. His eyes widen and his heart rate picks up rapidly.
“Oh.”
“Is that so?” If Malfoy felt caught, he didn’t let it show. He was the picture of calmness and indifference.
Celia and Teddy both looked at Draco with their best puppy dog eyes. Harry knew he wouldn’t be able to resist them long.
“As if you wouldn’t be doing the same if the roles were reversed,” Draco pointed out and tried to hide his own blush.
He stares at Potter, panic rushing through him. It was a slip. His mind wasn't working properly. It happened once before, in the showers. Draco mouthed his name soundlessly over and over again. But this time, he can’t take it back. Potter heard it.
Harry makes a face, putting his glasses back on. He sighs, screwing up his eyes and concentrating hard. When he opens them again, he blinks against the glare of his desk lamp.
“You’re our great Saviour,” Malfoy says. “Now is your time to shine.”
“The cake,” Harry says excitedly.
“At this point, I think I have every right to do so,” Potter retorted.
“At once?” Potter exclaims.
“You made it pretty clear— Ugh, you know what, no.” Draco’s heart sank at the tortured expression on his face. “If you came here for another fight, so you can accuse me—”
“You—” Draco pulled back, suddenly realising how lightheaded he was. Salazar, he should have come up for air sooner. “You— You want me to push my tongue inside you?”
He watches him, out of the corner of his eye, wondering if he’s thinking about his death march again. Draco can’t imagine what it must feel like.
But doing the right thing, Draco learns, apparently means you have to be willing to make sacrifices. And suddenly, he’s terrified again, because there’s one person who always does the right thing and he might be willing to sacrifice everything.
“I guess so.”
It’s yet another cruel twist of fate, Harry thinks.
Draco kept gaping at her as she took her seat and ordered a lemonade.
Malfoy wasn’t in there with a girl after all. He was in there with another bloke. What?
“The office gossip is quite amusing this morning,” he shrugs.
“Oh, no. I was actually thinking it’d be just you and me.”
While the two of them glare at each other, Draco notices out of the corner of his eye, they’ve attracted an audience. These damned cubicles.
Overcome with dizziness, he relaxes his shoulders and tries to catch his breath. He stops breathing completely when Potter slightly pulls back and his nose brushes against Draco’s. He stays there, his eyes locked with Draco’s, as though he’s too mesmerised to move. At least that’s how Draco feels. His right index finger twitches and in the back of his mind, he wonders why whatever he’s touching feels so unfamiliar. Oh. Because it’s Potter’s beard. Draco’s hand is on Potter’s cheek.
“Just shut up, Potter,” Malfoy says, in a much softer tone than his words warrant, and slowly puts his arms around Harry.
“So you didn’t like the kiss?” Harry said, teasingly, but also a little worried.
“Baxter!”
Without his permission, his thumb moves and Draco marvels at the texture of Potter’s beard and the smoothness of his skin as his thumb reaches his cheekbone. It’s as though Draco’s insides just turned into that Muggle candy Blaise once bought him at the funfair; fluffy, like clouds, and sweet. Draco could stay like this forever. But, of course, ‘forever’ only belongs in fairytales.
Harry’s heart stops when Malfoy pulls away and gives him a curious look. What he wouldn’t give to know what he’s thinking right now.
Harry cleared his throat, which actually sounded more like a whimper.
“THEN LEAVE,” Draco yells. He grabs a vase from the windowsill and smashes it on the ground. Harry stares at him, his mouth hanging open. “I told you this would happen,” Draco says agitatedly. “We keep having the same fight over and over again.”
“I liked you better when you were too cold to talk.”
Draco’s eyes snap up. Oh Merlin, why is Potter looking at him like that?
Draco snorted. “As if anyone would employ me.”
“Oh fuck! Oh fuck! Oh—”
“On the way home? What, you want to grab some poor wizard’s scone while we floo past him?”
“Fuck, yes! Oh god, Draco!”
“I’ve told you before, I’m just helping out a friend,” Draco shrugs. “Besides, I’m getting tired of watching you mope around. You’ll turn into Moaning Myrtle. And if I ever become tired of being an estate agent, I might open my own matchmaking agency. Having you as a client reference wouldn’t exactly hurt.”
“Draco wouldn’t think about me like that even if I did have a penis.”
“From now on, we shall call you Pansoyle,” Blaise declared with a flourish.
“Am I to take it that means no?”
He forces himself to relax. There’s nothing he can do about it now. Besides, what does he care what Malfoy thinks? Except… he does. He can’t help it. They’ve been at each other’s throats for six years now and, somehow, in a very twisted way, it’s become such a habit, Harry finds himself waiting for the Slytherin’s taunts. He should enjoy the silence and not having to look at Malfoy’s scowl, but instead, Harry shifts from side to side, feeling uneasy. It’s ridiculous. He doesn’t miss being teased by the git. He could very well live without it. And yet… this just doesn’t feel right. He would never admit it out loud, but he desperately wants to know what the Slytherin is thinking right now. Maybe he could… try and find out? Snape has only taught him Occlumency, but maybe if he just concentrated on Malfoy hard enough…
“What?” Harry asked, throwing his hands up in the air.
“Don’t be so dramatic, Potter. We’re not kids anymore. A lot of time has passed.”
Draco mentally cheers. Phase two is also going beautifully so far. He just has to get Potter and himself a little tipsy; whatever happens next won’t be his fault then. He can always blame it on the alcohol.
“Did you just say ‘please’?”
He felt Draco slowly pushing him towards his room and even though his heart was ready to jump out of his chest, he trusted Draco. They would take it slow.
“As a matter of fact, I am sick,” he grumbles. “Of your stupid, sultry voice,” he adds under his breath.
Malfoy makes a weird little sound and looks up at the sky as though he’s trying to calm himself. Or maybe he just doesn’t want to look at Harry.
“You told her— Why are you even talking to her?” Potter exclaimed, turning to Luna.
“It’s not the same,” Teddy pouted. He almost looked like he was about to cry. Draco was tempted to tell him he was a big boy now, it was his sixth birthday after all, and big boys didn’t cry, but Draco had always hated it when his parents had told him that. It had taken him a long time to realise there was nothing wrong with crying. But it always broke his heart a little, seeing those silent tears roll down Teddy’s face.
Harry closes his eyes and takes several deep breaths. He wills his pulse to slow down and tries to shove Malfoy and his beautiful body out of his mind. He peeks down at his hands and sighs in relief when he finds he isn’t invisible anymore. Good. He straightens himself, avoiding the stage and letting his eyes roam the rest of the room instead. Everybody seems to be mesmerised by whatever Malfoy’s doing. Did he… take off his boxer briefs? Is he—No! Harry can’t risk it. He can’t look. He can’t—Damn it!
“I didn’t mean to freak you out,” Draco muttered after a moment. “Forget everything I said about marriage, okay? Harry? Are you even listening to me? Are you okay?”
“This,” Potter points at it, “was in the Snitch Dumbledore gave me.”
Potter finally stopped walking when they entered the storage room, and closed the door behind them.
The realisation crashes down on him, leaving him numb. He’s probably been too arrogant. Potter can have anybody he wants, why would he choose to be with Draco?
He puts down his empty glass on the table and wraps his arms around his legs. He wonders if he sounded too reproachful. It’s not like he needs validation from Potter. He shudders at the thought that his words might have implied that.
“Is that a yes?” Potter grinned.
“Come on, Penelope,” Malfoy says. “Let’s go inside.”
“You know,” Ginny says as she guides Harry a little more to the left, “there’s been some talk amongst the team.”
Draco jumped up, clasping Luna’s shoulders.
contact her!”
“Why?”
“I’ll do it,” Potter sighs.
“Ask him what spell he used in the bathroom.”
He shoves a forkful of eggs into his mouth and scowls at the wall. Fuck Malfoy. That prick better pay his rent on time or Harry will—
He blinks some more, as though it will resolve his confusion.
“Please, Madam Pince, this is an emergency!”
Celia and Teddy resumed clutching each other’s hands and hopped through the kitchen.
“Here we go,” Draco groaned as he put the koala down on the worktop. “Stay here, okay? I need to—” As soon as Draco had taken a step back, the koala stretched out its little paws. Draco snorted, shaking his head with a smile. “I can’t carry you around all the time.”
“Something funny, Malfoy?” he says waspishly. “I don’t hear anyone volunteering to help
“Do you think you can forgive yourself?”
“This is not my journey, Harry Potter. It is yours. Only you can find the answers to your questions.” Firenze’s gaze is so intense, it nearly makes Draco shudder and he notices how Potter squirms.
“Besides the blind dates, what else did you do?”
“Oooooh!” Teddy’s eyes were wide as several thick branches appeared at the far end of the room. “Those are just like the ones in the zoo!”
“Are you happy?” Potter suddenly asked. Draco’s mouth dropped open involuntarily. His instincts told him to reply with something snarky. But… after Potter’s honesty, baring his insecurities, it just didn’t feel right.
“What? Why?”
“More firewhisky?” Draco asks innocently.
Draco stays stock-still, only his chest vibrating in the rhythm of his erratic heartbeat.
The only ones who make this whole situation somewhat bearable are Ginny and Luna. And, to his own astonishment, a third person he never ever would have imagined to one day call his friend. Or at least somewhat of a friend. They’re keeping it secret for now. So the only people he socialises with in the open are Ginny and Luna. Harry is almost tempted to smile whenever Ginny sees someone staring at him and draws her wand. Her infamous Bat-Bogey Hex, or at least the threat of it, does keep the other students at bay.
Draco was just about to go downstairs when he felt the wards of the Manor warning him about an intruder. Who the fuck was coming here, unannounced, at this hour, on a Sunday? It couldn’t be Blaise or Pansy, the wards didn’t react to them.
Potter looked as shocked Draco felt.
“I expect it on my desk no later than this evening.”
But first, he’s going to get those gloves Hagrid gave him. Just in case he asks Harry to do something ridiculous again.
“Oh, so you haven’t been using me?”
Draco shrugged. “There are several others in the countryside, but it would have been a pain in the arse for the families who live here, especially the Muggle-born children, since this isn’t a boarding school. What? Why are you looking at me like that?”
He’s sure Ginny would ask something like “How can you forgive him? Have you forgotten everything he’s done?”
“It’s still a—”
Harry nods, and then stops when he hears a rustling sound to his right. He can just picture Malfoy, a smirk on his face, soundlessly mocking Harry for his incapacity.
Oh, for fuck’s sake!
Within seconds, they’re surrounded by a horde of house-elves, who stare at Potter adoringly. Draco scoffs. What else is new.
“So,” he says, holding her out to Malfoy. “What does she look like to you?”
Draco suppressed the urge to roll his eyes but did as he was told. He paused when the koala turned its head.
Harry lets out a little sigh in relief and leans back in the chair.
“Oh yeah?” Harry says challengingly. He raises his chin. “I bet you’re too much of a coward.”
Potter’s forehead creased. He was silent for several moments, either racking his brain or trying to stay in character to keep up this ridiculous charade.
“Because you already know! What, you want to gloat?” Potter seethed.
“So, she said she was taking a walk on the grounds?”
After a quick detour to the kitchens, Harry finds himself in front of the Niffler’s burrow once more.
The sudden urge to hex Potter seizes him like a flash of lightning. He knows this isn’t technically Potter’s fault. Not all of it at least. Still, the pettiest part of him takes control and sneers.
But Harry doesn’t. He keeps bobbing his head, trying to ignore the burning in his cheeks. With a silent ‘pop’ Malfoy’s cock suddenly disappears from Harry’s mouth. The hand in his hair tightens and then he feels something warm and sticky oozing down his chest. Perplexed, Harry brings his fingers up and touches it.
“You have no idea what you’re up against, Potter. Don’t be foolish and run while you can. Save yourself.”
“But you want to.”
“Oi, Malfoy,” he snaps, balling his hands into fists.
“What are you—” He breaks off as a door handle suddenly appears.
He decides to test the water, rubbing his hand against the base of Potter’s cock. He moves his hands in circular motions, slowly creeping towards the tip. Potter groans when he reaches it.
“Ugh! Get out of my head,” Harry yells, pressing his hands against his temples.
“Go on, Harry,” she says.
McGonagall thrusts her hands onto her hips.
Hoping it’s not too late, Harry races through the castle while grey eyes, scrutinising him coldly, still linger in the back of his mind.
Ugh. Well, unfortunately this is also part of his job, isn’t it? Why the Forbidden Forest though. Why?
“I’m not. I just want to know—”
Against his better judgement, he puts his arms around Malfoy and pulls him closer. He doesn’t know why, but, somehow, this feels even more intimate than what they just did. And, inexplicably, that doesn’t bring him joy, it makes his heart grow heavy.
” He puts his elbow on the backrest and gives Potter an expectant glance. “I’m waiting.”
“We talked to Moaning Myrtle.”
“Would you’ve treated me differently, if you had realised who I was?”
“Have you heard from him lately?” Harry asked, reaching for his wine glass. Only, it wasn’t his wine glass he was grabbing right now.
“That’s the next thing we’ll have to figure out,” Hermione says. “You don’t—” She hesitates yet again. It’s so unlike her, which only adds to Harry’s irritation. “You don’t think he did this to you. Do you?”
“Awesome,” he exclaimed. “You’ll officially be part of the family, then!”
“Hmmmm, so good,” he murmurs after the first bite, to which he hears Malfoy snort. “Do you disagree?”
Whimpering. Sobbing.
“No, I’m just full of surprises,” Harry retorted, rubbing their cheeks together. He loved doing that. Draco always acted as though it annoyed him, but it always made him laugh, just like it did then. He pulled Harry into another kiss that made his heart stutter.
With a burst of frustration, Harry realises that will be impossible. He can’t see anything. How is he supposed to spy on Malfoy when he can’t open his eyes?
The relief Harry feels doesn’t last long, though, as Lucius pressures Draco into confirming Hermione’s identity and all hell breaks loose.
“Shit! Potter!” His fingers dig into the soft skin of Potter’s arse.
Potter looked as though Draco had just punched him. He opened his mouth, but before he could speak, Draco raised his hand.
“None of your business.”
“This isn’t happening right now,” he murmured, staring at the ceiling. The koala made a little squeaky noise. If Draco didn’t know any better, he’d say it was a noise of contentment. He blinked in the darkness, wondering what had become of his life. What did he do wrong to end up here?
Potter just shrugs.
“I’m not using you either, if that’s what you—” Draco breaks off when Potter’s eyes snap up to his.
A weird sensation, something almost resembling fear, washes over him and against his better judgement, Draco finds himself rushing forward and sinking down to his knees. He grabs Potter’s shoulders and starts shaking his limp body.
“Oh Draco, this place is wonderful,” Luna said. “And the teachers are so nice! They said I could give it a go.”
Feeling much bolder and encouraged, he put a hand on Potter’s chest and leaned closer, until their noses were touching.
“What? What is it?” Harry says in surprise. “Do you need something?”
“Is it working?”
Harry stays perfectly still; this is… unexpected.
“Ah, no, I think he is indeed beyond help.”
Potter shrugs and turns his eyes to the ceiling innocently. “It feels like doing homework,” he says after a moment.
“Excuse me?”
“Good for you, Potter,” he says, trying to shove away his hand.
“You don’t think so?”
“Yeah, well, I, err—”
“I seem to have grabbed a Muggle tent by accident,” Potter says with a trace of sheepishness.
Draco blinked.
“Malfoy! Potter!”
This time, Harry didn’t miss the undertone in Draco’s voice, although he wasn’t exactly sure how to interpret it.
“Oh wow!”
Draco rolled his eyes while he brushed his hair out of his face with the back of his hand.
“Um.”
“Well, you’re still pretty bony,” Potter shrugged.
“Oh, no. She dated Ron for a couple of months in sixth year.”
,” Blaise said teasingly.
Malfoy opens his mouth to give a sharp reply no doubt, but is momentarily distracted by Penelope, who crawled over to him.
“What? What?” Potter looked around, disoriented, his eyes still hooded.
When Potter makes an impatient gesture, Draco takes the vial wordlessly and downs the whole thing in one gulp. It tastes like peppermint and… ugh, Mandrake leaves.
“It makes you vulnerable.”
“Merlin, Draco,” Potter whispers against his mouth, “I like you so much, it hurts.”
“What?”
“Damn straight,” Draco barked.
Mind reeling, Harry wobbles into the Charms classroom, unable to listen to anything Professor Flitwick is saying. All his classes pass in a blur while his mind spins out of control. It’s only after McGonagall finishes her lesson that Harry’s startled out of his numbness by a hesitant hand on his shoulder.
“I swear to Merlin, if you take back what you just told me and we go back to being friends, I’m going to hex your testicles off,” he growled against Potter’s lips.
He tried to move, but found himself unable to. He was pinned down on the bed. What in Merlin’s name was going on? He had to blink a few times until his eyes adjusted, but when he saw who was lying on top of him, he suddenly wasn’t sure if he was still dreaming.
“I want to. But the thing is, you don’t really care about your family name anymore, do you?” He waited for Draco’s reaction, but he just kept staring at him. “I mean, your mother took her maiden name again, so you’re the last living Malfoy and I know you wouldn’t want the name to get extinguished completely… Just like I wouldn’t want my parents’ legacy to be forgotten.” He brushed a few strands of hair out of Draco’s face. “I just thought…”
“Do you think someone did this to you?” Draco asked.
Harry scratched the back of his neck, completely at loss.
If only Malfoy knew how eager Harry actually is to reciprocate. He feels him tense up against him.
Draco chuckled. “Ready?” he asked. Slowly, Potter nodded. Draco took a pinch of floo powder, trying to calm Potter with a smile. It almost seemed to be working. Until…
And, lastly, thank you to the amazing
“I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you,” Potter murmured. “I guess fate brought us back together. But… I’m sorry for disappointing you again.”
