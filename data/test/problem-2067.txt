He rolled it up quickly and ran up the endless sets of stairs to the roof where his new owl preferred to roost. He hadn’t necessarily expected the great grey owl to be as affectionate as Hedwig, but he certainly didn’t expect it to not even want to sleep inside unless it was winter. It made him miss Hedwig all the more. The unaffectionate owl was nowhere to be seen when he finally made it to the top of the townhouse.
“Why can’t he just kill me? Leave my parents alone.” Draco rinsed the bile from his mouth. “I’d welcome death, at this point.”
“Right.” He scoffed.
“You aren’t your father, Draco,” she said softly, rubbing soothing circles on his back. “you are not doomed to repeat his mistakes.”
“Then what happened?” Pansy pressed when Blaise paused for dramatic effect.
“Oi! Don’t poke my eye out with that thing.”
It cracked open, revealing Marvolo Gaunt’s ring. The cracked black stone had the mark of the Deathly Hallows engraved into it and he suddenly knew what it was.
“For just about two years now.” George piped up.
“Or steamy snogging sessions?” Harry tried not to sound petulant.
“Is he serious?” Draco turned towards Harry with a horrified expression.
“Attempt to interfere again and you will suffer a worse fate.” Snape snarled, flourishing his wand around with a demented relish.
“I can’t seem to stay away.” It was meant as a joke, mostly, but Draco obviously didn’t find it funny.
“He lives...he can’t- he needs a ride.” Draco choked out, feeling empty and sad.
“I know it is,” George pulled him away from the rest of the family. “If anyone understands, it’s me. You can’t cut yourself off though.”
He opened the door and put the green apple he had brought with him inside. He closed the door and held his breath. An odd thumping reached his ears and Draco frowned. The cabinet had never made that sound before. He could only hope it meant something good. He held his breath before yanking the door back to reveal the apple. He was almost disappointed until he noticed the apple had a bite taken out of it.
“I suppose so.” He shrugged.
“Know what?”
“Lucius and Narcissa will be there. I feel the five of us can handle just about anything.” Harry offered.
“Better luck next time mate.” Ron said bracingly.
“The Lupin-Black center. Harry started it so that children whose parents died or were rendered incompetent during the war had a place where they would be loved and welcomed. We have on-site housing and daily programs for the kids. When school is in session we provide primary schooling for those who are too young to go to Hogwarts. Harry out-did himself. It’s truly a genius system!” Pansy gushed, clearly passionate about her job.
"Harry Potter."
“Guess you’ll just have to find out.” He smirked seductively.
Blaise opened his mouth to say something, but Draco didn’t catch it. The front door had opened to reveal a sullen-looking Harry walking beside a much too chipper Luna. Harry’s eyes found his almost immediately before they flicked away and Draco stiffened. He gave up on getting any more stretching done and abandoned his friends without a word, wandering aimlessly backstage. He still had twenty minutes until rehearsal officially started, but he couldn’t stand to face him yet.
“In a word, hostile. We had never had a friendly encounter before then. I was properly shocked when he gave me back his own son’s wand.” Harry said with no inflection, glancing at the subject of his answer. Lucius was staring at him with a strange expression on his face. He looked both shocked and hopeful. It was almost comical.
“I did. It was very thoughtful, and I needed a tea set too.” He was glad Pansy was still poking at his eyes so he didn’t have to see the knowing look in both of theirs.
“Are you ready to experience a real beach?” Draco had a lovely day planned at Sandbanks beach in Poole.
“Yeah, they dispense out of here when you're done playing the game.” Harry pointed to a horizontal slot that was right beneath the vertical slot Harry had pushed the token into. “Every game will give you tickets if you win, then when you’re ready to leave you take all of your tickets to the front counter and trade them in for a prize.”
“That I’m one of your best friends.” She smirked.
"You just need to find your center of gravity. " Harry chuckled. "Here, cross your arms and grab both of my hands."
“I don’t know.”
“Good luck with your date!” Ron snickered as Harry stormed down the hall.
“No. We have to move Fred’s body. We can’t let anything happen to him.” Harry said as firmly as he could manage. He joined Percy who had taken Harry's place, weeping over his body. “Come on Percy, we need to take him somewhere safe.”
“It worked!” Harry grinned as soon as he walked into Draco’s office.
“I’m sorry I didn’t have the chance to get to know her.” Draco frowned, lowering his gaze to the tiled floor.
“Try me.” Pansy arched an eyebrow at her friend.
His voice sounded tight and Draco wasn’t sure but it sounded like he might have been crying. He was saved from having to respond by the study door flying open.
Draco groaned as he became aware of throbbing pain in his chest. Dying shouldn’t be so painful.
“I-” Draco started to object, then sighed. “Yes, that’s the gist of it. Any kind of attention from you was better than no attention at all.”
“Stay back!” Thranduil was backing away from them, pointing his wand first at Zach and then Harry. “You can’t prove anything!”
Happy reading!
"I did, actually." Draco led the way back into the community center. "You have yet to disappoint me in planning a fun day despite my constant skepticism."
“Shut up and sit down, Potter.” Pansy snapped, pointing at the open seat and glaring at him. “Those pipes will still be there when you get back.”
"At the beginning of the night, you wanted nothing to do with me. Yet you danced with me anyway and I just… why?" Harry felt heat flood to his ears. He had never been eloquent, but now he felt downright stupid.
“Then here is to you, Amelia.” He raised his glass to hers and they both threw it back. Sweet and tangy flavor exploded on his tongue and his eyes widened. “You have excellent taste.”
"She's Andi." Harry shrugged. "She's grown a little more eccentric and cares a lot less about what other people think since the war."
The sun was just starting to dip below the far horizon, painting the sky in vibrant red and orange. Draco drank in the sight of London bathed in the glowing sunset as their pod began to rise. He couldn’t be entirely certain, but he suspected that there was nothing quite as breathtaking as the London Skyline. Much to Draco’s elation, Harry stood behind him and wrapped his arms around his waist, resting his chin on Draco’s shoulder like he had at Canterbury Cathedral. Draco placed a hand over each of Harry’s wrists, anchoring him in place. He didn’t know why, but having Harry hold him like this made him feel safe and protected. Harry pointed out major landmarks and tourist attractions that they hadn’t visited yet, whispering trivia in his ear until they reached the top. The view was absolutely stunning. Windows glittered like diamonds from within the inky silhouettes of buildings set against the backdrop of the setting sun and the Thames looked like it had been set ablaze. They could not have picked a more perfect time to ride the Eye. Draco turned his head to give Harry a chaste kiss before leaning his head against his as they stared out at all of London beneath them. It was so incredibly perfect.
“I didn’t know it came in so many colors.” Harry shrugged. “I may have gone a tad overboard, but I wasn’t sure which one to get.”
“Sorry? For what?” Harry blinked, forcing himself to focus on the present.
“You know what, I think I’d like that.” Harry tightened his arm around Draco’s waist and Draco considered everything Harry had missed out on because of the Dark Lord.
He took a few moments to collect himself before attempting the spell, doing his best to focus despite the raging battle outside.
"They must have been a memorable two. Weren't you with one of the Weasley twins at some point?" Draco supplied helpfully, thinking back to when Pansy had done some digging for him.
"Can I ask you something?" Harry reached out to touch the faint scars spider webbing across Draco's chest that he had given him in sixth year.
“Thank you.” He ached to be back on his broom again.
Sod the Dark Lord, Draco was pretty sure an enraged Pansy would be his boggart if he ever met one again.
Happy reading!!!
Harry laughed, though. He set his own mead down and grabbed a couple of napkins off the table.
“This seems too easy.” Draco noted.
“Really?” Draco sat back in shock. “I’m surprised you remember that.”
"Why?" Malfoy gave him a calculating look.
"For what?" Harry blinked.
“I already look nice, I don’t need a sodding bowtie.” He gestured at his dark teal trousers and light grey button-up tucked loosely into the waistband. He had the sleeves rolled up to the crook of his elbow, showing off his freshly tanned forearms.
“What happened then?” she leaned over the railing with bated breath.
Teddy just smiled and nodded, stretching his arms up in obvious agreement.
“Salazar, is that what’s going on in your head?” Once he was sure Harry wouldn’t bolt he let his hand go, using both hands to work the tension out of Harry’s neck and shoulders.
“I’m a Slytherin, for one thing. I don’t tend to get along with Gryffindors.” Draco’s tea set had never been more interesting. He watched the stars twinkling against the inky black, following the delicate lines that connected the constellations with an inordinate amount of concentration. “I’m a Malfoy, for another. My family doesn't exactly have the best reputation. Not to mention the fact that I’m a Death Eater.”
“Draco Malfoy helped me the most.” Harry said quietly and Draco’s head snapped up.
“Ron and I turned into Crabbe and Goyle and you let us into the Slytherin common room.”
Of course it wasn’t. You can’t control who you fall in love with. Theo knew that better than anyone. He had fought against his feelings for Draco until the summer before their 4th year. Watching him lose it over the World Cup had sealed his fate. He was just so bloody adorable when he was excited about something. Unfortunately for both of them, pureblooded wizards were simply not allowed to be gay. The most important thing to their families is that they get married to a respectable pureblooded witch and produce a male heir to carry on the family name.
“Thanks.” Draco plopped down next to him and offered him the fire whiskey. “Something for the nerves?”
“I accept the charges.” Draco spoke first, his voice ringing loud and clear. He looked determined, making eye contact with Kingsley.
"I think I understand why this is a popular muggle date destination now." Draco laughed. "It definitely has its perks."
“Terms of endearment, right Weasel?” He sent him a cheeky smile and the Weasel returned it, if a bit apprehensively.
“What have I missed?” He asked cooly instead.
“What about that pretty little Ravenclaw you came to my party with?” Draco seemed to dethaw ever so slightly and Ron saw Harry let out a little sigh of relief.
“Come now, Potter. Surely you’re not going to sit out the whole reception? Even at the Yule Ball, you danced to at least one song.” Draco smirked, enjoying the look of alarm on the ginger’s face.
“What are you doing?” Draco didn’t even try to hide the disappointment in his voice.
Almost.
“You must be joking.” She leveled the pompous wizard with a hard stare.
Draco froze, unsure of what to do. He didn’t want to capture Harry. Or stop him from destroying the horcrux he was holding.
Draco just stared at him, silver eyes alight with judgment, stubbornness and something else Harry couldn’t quite place. The silence stretched on but Harry refused to break it. He had asked a question and he wouldn’t say a word until it was answered. The dull tolling of the emergency alert was the only sound in the room.
His Slytherin green collared shirt was left open, revealing a tight black tee with a silver dragon design. The long sleeves were rolled up to expose his wrists but left his dark mark completely covered and he seemed to have the same taste in tight black pants as Regulus. What captured Harry’s attention the most, however, were his eyes. They were accentuated with thin lines of black and seemed to glow when he smiled.
He made a sharp turn and suddenly the tall grass melted into a maze of empty tables and chairs that were so massive he couldn’t see the tops of them. He raced through the larger-than-life table legs, dodging falling drops of champagne until he found his way to the dance floor.
“Our apologies, Mr. Malfoy. Please proceed.” An elderly witch glared at her noisy compatriots.
“Vanilla.” He accepted the cold cup from Harry and took an explorative pull on the straw. He was a little surprised by the resistance. He sucked harder and was rewarded by a cold, thick, creamy substance coating his tongue. “What is this?”
“Don’t ask me.” Dean shrugged. “Been dating for almost three years and what goes on in that man's head is still a mystery.”
“We don’t want this war any more than you do.” Theo pulled Draco until he sat on his bed with him.
It came to the point that when Harry had to cancel one of their engagements, Draco wasn’t quite sure what to do with himself. First one day passed, then another with no word from Harry and Draco realized just how much he had come to depend on his daily dose of the wizarding savior. He gazed up at the night sky through his glass ceiling, contemplating his next move. Harry had mentioned being able to purge the Manor of its dark magic with the help of a powerful curse breaker when Draco had shared about his panic attacks. It was a bit of a shock, though he supposed it shouldn’t have been, to learn that Harry suffered from panic attacks too. They had a lot more in common than he had ever realized.
“What, that you’re gay? Or that you’re gay for Harry Potter?” His father asked with a straight face.
“Not a chance.” Harry snorted. “We still have two more places I wanted to show you before we head to the Manor for dinner.”
“Difficult is my middle name.” Draco retorted before leading her on stage for their first scene together.
"Enough." Harry said evasively. "There's one more thing in the bag."
"No problem." Tonks nodded curtly at him. Even in the dark of night, she looked miserable and Harry didn't know how to help.
“Oh, but Potter doesn’t mean that, does he? That isn’t how you work. You’re a survivor, just like me. Who are you going to use as a shield this time? Hmm?” The Dark Lord jeered.
Theo, Pansy, and Macmillan were staring at him too, so Draco didn’t feel like he was cheating on his new resolution to stop looking at him.
“It pulls the outfit together.” Pansy pouted.
“Harry.” He corrected automatically. “Here, I got you a chicken pesto panini. It’s the best sandwich they offer.”
“You guess?” Ari scoffed. “What do you mean you guess?”
The lemon ricotta pancakes were divine and he even tried a bite of Draco’s skillet, which was also delicious. Draco seemed rather pleased with himself for picking two things Harry liked so he felt he was forgiven for making him order for both of them. When breakfast was over they wandered around the boardwalk, window shopping and testing the waters of their new relationship. Harry tentatively took Draco’s hand as they walked and Draco rewarded him with a happy sigh. It felt strange, holding hands with Draco Malfoy- but it also felt incredibly right.  Eventually, they found their way inside a muggle record shop and Harry enjoyed the look of wonder on Draco’s face as he saw the vast rows of classic vinyls and CDs.
“Fuck you!” Harry growled.
Draco hardly noticed as Dumbledore spoke. He gave a shite eulogy about a student he rarely interacted with and then told them all The Dark Lord was back. As if that weren’t obvious. Could there really be people who hadn’t figured it out? He glared around the hall. How many people would shout ‘death eater’ at him when they came back? At all 5 of them? Then the most terrifying thought of all… How long until those accusations become true?
“Thanks for...everything.” He said somewhat lamely. He wanted to comfort her, tell her Snape was vile, and to not listen to a word he said.
“I was just trying to say that I’m sorry.” Percey huffed.
“Well, Harry, thank you for another fun day off from studying. I quite enjoyed it.” Draco pulled off the New You amulet and handed it back. Harry was surprisingly happy to see Draco morph back into himself.
He placed his glasses on the counter and set to work cleaning himself up. It was a slow process because his mind was on other things. He cast multiple drying charms on his clothes. It didn’t look perfect, but it would do. He looked critically at his hair. Godric, Draco was right. He did look like a drowned rat. He muttered one last drying spell, trying to get the tangled mess brushed out with his fingers but it was no use. Hermione’s carefully applied makeup had washed off and he looked even more tired than before. Maybe he could use this as an excuse to leave early. He was mildly cheered by the thought.
As soon as they heard the study door shut behind him all three men visibly relaxed.
“Your driving scares me sometimes.” Harry teased.
“You mean you don’t know?”  Draco all but whispered.
“How did you-” Harry started to ask but he was cut off by Neville.
The sound of a dying hyena erupted into the night and both Harry and Draco turned towards the disturbance. Ron was almost doubled over, laughing hysterically.
There was no sun but the sky was a brilliant golden color that made the Quidditch pitch glow. When Harry looked down he found he was holding a Nimbus 2001 so he mounted it and kicked off. He immediately rose high into the air, but he wanted to fly higher. He tilted his broom up till he was vertical and spiraled into the sky, loving the weightless feeling and the freedom that only flying could bring. He flipped into a steep dive, racing towards the ground and pulling out of it at the last second. He couldn’t remember the last time he had flown. It was a shame, really. Nothing could compare to it.
“I honestly haven’t had the chance. I haven’t seen him since everyone else started to get here.” He moved away from her fingers, trying to dodge the next round of rib poking.
“And he will want it to be quick. He will want it over with.” Lupin nodded sagely.
“What kind of gift do you get for someone who hates you?” He asked idly as they sorted through racks.
“I try to be.” Harry sighed, taking a sip of the wine. It was a little dry for his taste but still good.
Harry tried to think of a quick coping mechanism as they drew nearer to the front steps. He frantically cast his mind back, thinking of all of his chats with Sirius.
"Oh, hey Daphne." He grimaced as she came over to him.
“Die? That night at the Ministry. He was dueling your aunt.” Harry seemed to shrink in on himself and Draco immediately regretted the question.
“Yeah, one of the Carrows told us something like that before they ran off shouting about Ravenclaw tower. I can never tell them apart.” Vince nodded.
The party appeared to be at a secluded villa that was lit up blue and white. Harry could hear contemporary music floating out of an open balcony door and he raised his eyebrows at Hermione.
“Mc-what?” Draco frowned at the unfamiliar name.
“Besides, the Age Line Dumbledore made was foolproof. Adrian Pucey tried taking an aging potion so he could get past it and it chucked him out. There is no way Potter was smart enough to get past the age line.” Draco drawled.
“Sorry, didn’t mean to sneak up on you.” Harry tried not to laugh.
He suddenly discovered he didn’t know what it was he had wanted so badly to say.
Draco shot her a grateful glance and she winked. Pansy Parkinson was ruthless, bossy, tenacious, and manipulative, but she was a damn good friend. She was also cunning, brilliant, dedicated, and loyal to a fault. She always knew exactly what Draco needed without him having to ask. Merlin only knows how they ended up as such close friends, but he was eternally grateful that they had.
“Veritaserum?” Harry stared blankly at him. “Is that even legal?”
“Absolutely. I just wasn’t sure you wanted people to know.” Draco felt his cheeks grow hot and looked away.
Draco let him take the lead, closing and locking the door with a quick flick of his wand.
“You sure?” Harry asked uncertainly.
“No! Not at all, it’s perfect. This whole day has been...phenomenal.” Draco felt heat rise in his cheeks. “No one has ever done anything like this for me.”
“Salazar, Snape’s going to murder me. I’ll catch you two up later.” Draco didn’t even wait for a response before fleeing to the dungeons.
They descended the stairs and walked through the foyer together, chatting and laughing. When they reached the outside Draco almost stopped dead in his tracks. Pansy had positively transformed the patch of beach that he more or less owned. She had set up poles made out of driftwood and strung up netting and fairy lights between them to make a sort of canopy that protected the muggle style boombox, drinks, and snacks from the sun. A table was set up with disposable cups and plates and large bowls filled with enough snack food to feed an army. The boombox got its own table with a large selection of compact records next to it. Hermione had called them CDs. Beyond the canopy was a roaring fire with massive pieces of driftwood circling around it to serve as benches. What shocked him the most, however, was Harry chatting animatedly with his father while the Weasel and Weaselette were going through the CDs together.
“Breakfast will be ready in the kitchen when you is ready for it!” The elf replied before disapparating with a loud crack.
He knocked four times in quick succession before stepping back. He stabilized the teetering pile of sketchbooks that were threatening to topple out of the box just as the door swung open to reveal a very confused Draco Malfoy.
Draco took in a couple of deep breaths before disentangling himself from Harry and sitting up properly.
“I mean that the verdict is still out. No one has come forward with any indication of a decision on the Malfoy case.” Kingsley sighed, sitting back in his chair.
“I’ve no idea. I haven’t really seen them interact before.” Draco gave Bill an appraising look.
“It’s still a little too early, I don’t want to say.” Harry waved them off. “We’ve only been on a couple of dates.”
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake.” Granger heaved a frustrated sigh. Pansy could definitely empathize.
“I can manage, thank you.” Draco stood and walked up to the Minister of Magic without glancing back.
Flashes of Malfoy dancing with both Parkinson and Nott ran through his mind and Harry repressed a shiver.
“If you like to think of it that way, yes, I suppose it was due to my love for Draco.” Lucius allowed. He honestly couldn’t say either way.
“So I did.” Harry sighed, stretching his stiff muscles. A glance at the clock told him their little staring contest had gone on for an impressive twenty-something minutes. “What if all of those reasons are true?” He asked softly.
Hello my lovely readers! This chapter is heartbreaking. To be fair, I did tag major character deaths- so you can't be mad at me! Shout-out to my darling beta readers AlexClio and SandZhark for putting up with me and helping me make sense of my ramblings.
Harry’s face was set with determination as he jabbed the buttons on the side of the machine to keep the tiny silver ball in play. It was adorable. Draco had to admit Harry was rather good at this particular game. Well, to be entirely fair, Harry had been good at all of the games they had played. Draco smiled as a rare feeling of contentment settled over him. He had a feeling he would remember the laughter they shared as they raced their electronic cars, each one intentionally trying to sabotage the other by pushing them in the shoulder or grabbing at the other’s controls, the look of consternation on Harry’s face when Draco had beaten him repeatedly at air hockey, and the verbal abuse they hurled at each other to try and throw the other off their game during the hunting simulation for years to come. Draco had to hand it to Harry, going to the arcade had been a great idea. Draco let his mind wander until movement caught his attention. Two people were dancing on top of a glowing platform that kept flashing different colors and Draco was mesmerized. It was some sort of game- a dancing game! He watched the two teenagers with interest, noting the peculiar dance style the game seemed to require. It looked like a lot of fun. He scarcely noticed when the incessant dinging of the silver ball game stopped and almost jumped out of his skin when Harry’s voice sounded behind him.
“You’re an artist, Draco.” She said as if that explained everything. When he stared blankly at her she rolled her eyes but deigned to explain herself. “Your art has always been the best part of you. Even after you took the mark you never stopped drawing, not until that last year when everything went to rot. I was hoping you would pick it back up again, but it’s been almost three weeks and you still haven’t drawn anything… it hurts my soul. You need art in your life. It’s a part of you. So I started leaving different types of art supplies out to see if anything caught your interest.”
“Merlin’s beard, you’re Harry Potter!” He gaped foolishly at the bespectacled bronze-skinned angel standing in front of him.
Draco whipped around and narrowed his eyes at Harry as if he had done something nasty to him. Harry’s heart plummeted when he realized he actually had.
“Oh, yes! The one from Surrey. What was his name again? Henry?”
“Pie it is then.” Harry nodded, pulling the birthday candles out of his pocket as he made his way over to the counter. “Go ahead and sit down, I’ll bring it to you.”
“Save us if shit tries to kill us?” Harry winked.
"I love you." He brushed a quick kiss against her cheek.
“If you were following my advice, of course it worked. I’m bloody brilliant.” Draco rolled his eyes.
When he got back upstairs he stuck to the shadows, casting pain relief spells non verbally with his wand pointed surreptitiously at Granger. She was the brains of their operations so Draco needed to make sure she survived.
“Of course. Mother is quite the fan of theater.” He nodded.
Pansy knew she shouldn’t still be here, eavesdropping on what was clearly a private conversation, but she couldn’t help herself. Not only was the information totally juicy, but now she was genuinely curious.
“You drew this?” Harry asked breathlessly, gently tracing the delicate pencil strokes.
Harry rubbed at his face, trying to find the motivation to get out of bed and start the day. If he wasn’t downstairs in thirty minutes Kreacher would be back with cold water. He deeply regretted making Kreacher his alarm clock, but he couldn’t deny that he was a very effective one.
“That’s because you made it up.” Daphne flipped her hair over her shoulder impatiently. “Granger is too cowardly to use a love potion.”
“Of course I mean you and Draco.” She laughed. “I am extremely happy for you.”
"Harry, I can't breathe." He groaned. "Potter!" He shoved futilely at his muscular frame.
“That’s all a load of shite.” Pansy waved her hand dismissively. “There have been muggleborn Slytherins before. They’re rare, and I don’t think we’ve had one in over a century, but it does happen.”
“Oh, Harry you look absolutely wonderful!” Hermione grinned sheepishly.
They swapped stories all the way back to their spot on the beach, which as Harry predicted, was empty again. It was nice and strangely familiar like they had been friends all along. Eventually, they got cold and headed up to the fire where they were pulled into different directions, but Draco didn’t mind. They had a coffee date tomorrow.
“Why did she think that?” the same wizard quipped.
“Potter!”
Draco led him into his living room and Harry almost stopped. His eyes were immediately pulled upwards to the vast expanse of sky that was visible. The vaulted ceiling had been completely replaced with glass panels. Harry could imagine how they would allow natural light to bathe the room in a rich warm glow during the day, but right now they served as a window into the heavens.
“I got… held up at the manor.” He grimaced, sidestepping the sore subject. “Clever of you two to follow orders and keep out of trouble.”
“Happy birthday.” Harry’s heart fluttered in his chest at Draco’s reaction.
“Much better. What is it?” He tried to hand the cup back but Draco rolled his eyes and reached over to grab Harry’s latte instead.
“I- I can’t be sure.” Draco stammered, looking anywhere but at Harry. “What happened to his face?”
There was a roarous answering cry from the students around him and Draco marveled that the Dark Lord’s silencing charms didn’t seem to stick.
“Hands in the air, Thranduil. We have you surrounded.” Harry pulled off his cloak and stuffed it into his pocket, canceling his disillusionment charm on Zach before pointing his wand at Thranduil's heart.
Harry laughed at that, refreshing their ‘Notice Me Not’ charms when he heard someone ascending the stairs.
Harry was vaguely aware that he was dreaming.
“More cries for our death?” Draco sighed, picking the paper up with an air of disinterest.
“Harry! Are you alright? What happened?” She cried.
“I’m glad you had fun.” Harry reached into his pocket and unshrunk the slightly lopsided elephant he had made. “Here, I want you to have this.”
“Oi, Weasley!” Pansy called after them.
“Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot, we are gathered today to pass judgment on the Malfoy Family. The charges are as follows:
“Then go to a muggle shop!”
If you want to skip the smut stop reading when Draco tells Harry to put his seat back and pick back up when "Give me Love" starts playing.
Draco became hyper-aware that Harry’s hands were still on his shoulders and that his face was mere inches from his own. He could feel the warmth of Harry’s breath on his skin and it gave him chills. Now his pulse was racing for an entirely different reason. It would be so easy to just lean forward and press his lips against Harry’s. Harry’s eyes darted down to his lips and for a moment Draco thought Harry might kiss him.
“You’re a terrible liar.” He whispered in Harry’s ear.
“You did what you could under the circumstances, and I am grateful.” She waved him off as Pansy rejoined her and took her hand. “Pansy and I wanted to take you out for lunch while we discuss immediate plans for getting you reintegrated into society.”
"As ready as I'll ever be." Draco sighed.
“Draco went ballistic when Harry’s Uncle smacked him- balls to the wall blind with rage. It took everything Luna and I had to hold him back.” Blaise relished.
“I’ll do that, thank you.” Harry nodded, grateful for the chance to escape.
Harry cast his mind back, trying to discern the last time he had felt truly happy. His first thought was of the world cup, but even that event had been marred by the dark mark and Death Eaters. When the Weasleys had come to pick him up this past summer was also taken into consideration. Watching Dudley eat the ton tongue toffee had been a virtual riot, but that night had been plagued with copious amounts of anxiety. His thoughts strayed to Sirius and the night he had asked if Harry would want to come to live with him. Despite the danger of Professor Lupin turning into a werewolf and the fact that Pettigrew had escaped, Harry had felt elated at the prospect. That was before they both almost died down by the lake and Sirius was taken into custody to be kissed. Harry wracked his brains, trying to remember a single instance his happiness wasn’t short-lived. He supposed it must have been when he and Ron stole Mr. Weasley’s Ford Angela in second year. They might have hit the whomping willow, but they hadn’t been expelled and Ron even got a brand new wand out of it. His cheerful mood was dampened ever so slightly as he realized it had been over two years since he felt really truly happy.
“So you’re done? For now?” Harry wanted to clarify.
“Thanks, ‘Mione. What would I do without you?” He took off his glasses and handed them to Ron.
“I’m sorry, I should have realized it sooner- but then I had already made plans with you, and I don’t want to give up my time with you, so I thought...” Harry began babbling and Draco watched him flounder for a bit, enjoying the flush on his cheeks.
“Last one to the Astronomy tower is a poisonous toadstool!” Vince shrieked as he took off without them. Draco wasn’t far behind.
Remus stumbled under the unexpected weight when Harry went limp in his arms. He grit his teeth and shifted Harry’s weight so he was helping him walk rather than holding him. He couldn’t break down. Not here. Not yet. He had to be strong. Sirius would want him to be strong, for Harry. Dumbledore soon made his way over to the pair. He patted Remus’s shoulder in silent sympathy before relieving him of Harry’s grieving form. Harry would be safe with Dumbledore.
“Us? Who is us?” Pansy pulled up short.
“Let me guess, you suddenly have to go?” Granger sounded resigned, like this type of reaction to her offered support was normal.
If Draco succeeded the castle would be crawling with Death Eaters.
“He doesn’t hate you! Stop being dramatic.” Hermione’s tone was impatient as she examined a green shirt before putting it back with a huff.
He flipped her off over his shoulder and took another swig of the fire whiskey.
Lucius bowed his head in thanks, walking back to his family as quickly as he could while still appearing calm and collected. He locked eyes with Potter as he passed and Lucius was relieved to find no animosity in the young man's eyes. If nothing else, at least they had the Savior of the Wizarding World on their side.
“What do you mean since third year?” Harry demanded.
“When did he get transferred to your unit?” Draco inquired, settling in for a long chat.
When the tea was gone and Draco was just starting to feel relaxed Harry dropped an unpleasant bomb on him.
“I think I’ll go with them,” Daphne said thoughtfully. “I want to get some extra practice now that I know there are going to be scouts too.”
“Summer before first year.” Pansy jumped in. Draco’s eyes flashed to her face in a mixture of horror and shock. “Oh come off it, it didn’t take a genius to figure it out. You wouldn’t shut up about the prat. He met him in Madam Malkin’s. They were both getting fitted for school robes and he didn’t even know he was Harry Potter. From the way he tells it, he was trying to show off and was mortified that it didn’t seem to be working on the scrawny kid next to him. When he saw him on the train and realized he was Harry Potter of course he tried to befriend him.”
“Ah, Draco. Welcome back.” Severus sneered. “The Dark Lord wishes you to infiltrate the castle. Your friends are already waiting for you at the other end of this secret tunnel.” He strode purposefully across the room and moved a large crate to reveal the entrance to a small tunnel. “Your orders are to watch the Room of Requirement and to follow and thwart Potter should he enter it. Thwart, not kill. Am I understood?”
"It would be a shame." He hummed.
“Of course. Why don’t you go home and spend some time in Regulus’s room? That should make you feel better, yeah? I can fill Draco in on the rest.”
There was a quiet pause while George finished Harry’s right eye and capped the eyeliner. He cupped Harry’s chin in one hand, tilting his head this way and that before he nodded in satisfaction. George motioned for him to back up and once he was far enough away from the counter he jumped down and looked him dead in the eyes with a twisted expression.
“Here, try this on with…” she handed him a dark blueish-green button-up and moved on to the trouser section, pulling out dark grey cargo shorts with silver embroidery around the pockets. “These shorts.”
As always a huge shout out to my lovely Betas SandZhark and my Precious Baby Puff Ari! Sand is the reason the end of this chapter even makes any sense at all. 😬 As someone with a particularly painful past revolving around this type of abuse, this was a little hard to write for me. But Sand called me out on some bullshit and helped me make it more coherent, so please worship them for the ethereal diety they are!
“It’s unorthodox, but I see no reason why you can’t.” he frowned thoughtfully and Harry felt a small rush of victory.
The way he saw it, he would either win or die trying. The thought occurred to him that he was playing right into the hands of whoever had put his name in the Goblet. Whoever had entered him had obviously wanted him dead. But he had survived the dragon. He had the gilly weed. Harry was determined to finish the third task and win the Tournament. But he was getting ahead of himself. He still needed to survive this task before worrying about the third. Everyone threw him an irritated look and multiple people were asking where he had been as he joined the other three champions lined up on the shore of the lake. All sound faded into the background as he tried to hype himself up for this task. Cedric gave him a curious look but Harry just shook his head, focusing on chewing the rubbery plant. It tasted like seaweed and slugs. It was all he could do to keep it in his mouth.
He bent down to give Fleur a quick kiss on each cheek and a slightly awkward hug.
“Harry, you have to save me.” Draco cried. “I’m going to die here.”
They needed to go.
“I am too.” Harry sounded equally unsure. “I suppose I should leave you to sort through your...things…” He trailed off awkwardly, staring forlornly at the box.
“Harry! Look out!” Granger shouted, running towards them.
Harry’s eyes lit up as he sipped his tea and he gave Draco a wide-eyed look.
“All of them, I suppose?”
"What's the matter, Potter? Got a cock in your mouth?" Malfoy sauntered into the kitchen and hoisted himself onto the counter next to where Harry was chopping ingredients for dinner.
"No, you're not." His father narrowed his eyes at him.
“More power to you.” Blaise snorted. “See you tomorrow, Greengrass!”
“Sod off, you’re not fine and you know it.” another familiar voice sounded behind him.
“Inviting you, of course.” Harry’s tone left little doubt that canceling on Draco had never been an option and it made his heart skip a beat. “If you’d rather not go, we can do something else.”
Draco complied, using the long straw to swirl the contents of the glass before taking a hesitant sip. Mint and lime together sounded atrocious, but it made for an incredible drink. His eyes grew wide as the unique flavors coated his tastebuds and Harry seemed delighted by his reaction.
“Is that the last one? Can you destroy it?” Draco sidestepped the question.
“No, I bloody well won’t be.” Draco grit his teeth. “I don’t know what happened. I didn’t even think! One minute I was in complete control of myself and the next Harry’s fist is in my face...and I-”
Blaise seemed to need this as badly as Draco did. In no time at all they had each other undressed.
“Draco, it’s fine.” Harry ground out stiffly.
Harry jumped back, glancing around to see if the guard meant them. When his search came back empty it dawned on him that it was impossible to blend in somewhere they weren’t supposed to be. Of course the charm wouldn’t work in forbidden areas. Draco looked like he didn’t know if he should laugh or be repentant.
“Oi, Parkinson! No talking until I can think without getting a bloody migraine!” Theo called, wincing at the loudness of his own voice.
“Harry!” A familiar voice boomed. “Working hard, or hardly working?”
“Are you stalking me, Potter?” Draco huffed after they both regained their balance.
“So the article wasn’t a hoax, then? It wasn’t the prophet just spouting off nonsense, you actually said all of that?” Dean looked scandalized.
“Oh! Damn.”
“I’ve got something I need to do! Meet you at the three broomsticks in a couple of hours!” Harry called before taking off.
“Ignore them.” Ron shrugged unconcernedly.
“What do you mean?” He queried as he brushed the soot neatly from his shirt.
“Agreed.” Bill nodded curtly. “Let's move on.”
“I think he’s been devoting all of his free time to Draco.” She laughed.
A moment passed when their eyes met and Harry exchanged a loaded glance with Seamus.
He set his salvage down and drew his knees to his chest. All of the Death Eaters were off to kill the only person he knew for sure that he loved. It was safe to fall apart.
Do you wish to accept these charges and proceed?”
Why had he suggested an entire date day? He didn’t have a clue what a proper date consisted of past the classic dinner and a movie. What was he supposed to do? What did normal people do on day dates?
The sound of the floo activating went completely unnoticed by either of them.
“You’re lucky I believe you.” She snipped venomously.
Inhale for 5 counts, hold for three counts, exhale for 5 counts.
“The use of last names harbors animosity. Behind these doors, I would like you to call me Draco. ”
“Greg!” He laughed, finally returning the hug. “Where the hell have you been?”
“It’s just the two of us now. We have to look out for each other.” Hermione sat in the chair Harry had just vacated and picked up The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore from where he had left it.
“Then we both stormed off and we haven’t spoken since.” Draco snapped, pushing away from him to focus on stretching his traps.
An hour later found him shuffling the helium balloons and gift bag around so he could knock on Draco’s door without upsetting the pie.
“Let me get this straight, you want my help.”
“He does, yeah.” Harry smiled.
“Speaking of great ideas involving the socialization of a certain blonde pain in the ass,” She smirked “I was hoping you’d come to Draco’s housewarming party next weekend. I’m thinking of a beach bonfire, a muggle style boombox, fairy lights, copious amounts of alcohol- the works.”
“Fine.” Harry cleared his throat as he stood up. “I’m great. Did you enjoy the show?”
“Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” Fred grinned widely at the entire room “He wants a kip, and his bar’s been turned into an underground railway station.”

The curse breaker hesitated for only a moment before breaking into a wide grin and shaking Draco’s hand with all the force of a steam engine.
Narcissa Arae Malfoy you are accused of being a death eater sympathizer and of willingly housing the fugitive known as Tom Riddle; alias Lord Voldemort in your home.
“I’m s-s-sorry.” Harry gave another massive yawn and stretched while Draco snatched the parchment off the coffee table and read the note.
“Don’t worry, Potter. Who do you think taught Pansy?” Malfoy smirked, extending a hand towards him. Harry took it hesitantly and let Malfoy pull him into a dancing position. “Just follow my lead, you will be fine.”
Theo couldn’t help but watch the blond as he downed his drink and glided onto the dancefloor. He seemed to scan the other dancers for a moment before dancing his way over to an attractive muggle in the middle of the floor. Theo had never been happier to be interrupted by the wait staff in his life.
“I see. Did your previous students ask you a lot of questions about the war and the role you played in it?” He inquired without looking up.
“He said it was an allergic reaction.” Fenrir chipped in.
Ron’s face flushed in embarrassment and Harry instantly regretted the snub.
“And to shag Potter.” She interjected slyly.
“Alright, Potter. It’s our fun day, where do you want to go?” Draco tried to keep the excited expectation out of his voice as they left the cafe together.
“He wants to learn, and more importantly it guarantees more than one...encounter. You know how convoluted our history is.” He smirked.
Bill and Fleur shared a meaningful glance and Harry was mildly put off by their silent communication. What did that look mean?
"Harry, you were brilliant!" Hermione squealed. She had bright red scratches on her face from where she had been clutching it in fear. "You were fantastic! Really, you were!"
“I appreciate that. Really.” He assured her, not only because he was scared of enraging a volatile Veela- he was genuinely grateful for their show of support.
“Why can’t they help?” Hermione said thoughtfully.
“Oh.” He said simply, fidgeting with the hem of his shorts. “Well, maybe you could...bring me up to speed?”
Harry’s head whipped around the room and hope blossomed in his heart when he saw it was an overwhelming majority.
“Dumbledore left it to me in his will, so I pulled some strings. I saw the way you looked at it after you killed Nagini. I also saw you transfigure a scabbard for it so you could keep it. I figured if anyone deserves it, it’s you. They have the fake that was in your Aunt's vault on display at Hogwarts. We’re the only ones who know this is the real sword.” Harry made it sound like it wasn’t the single most thoughtful thing anyone had ever done for him.
Without warning a flash of green light arced across the top of the tower and Draco watched in mute horror. The spell sank into Dumbledore’s chest and knocked him off the tower. Was it possible to be graceful in death?
Ron had been oddly supportive of him getting together with Draco from the very beginning. He had been prodding Harry to get a move on for over a month now, but everything was different now than they were actually dating. He trusted Ron implicitly and his blessing meant a lot. He hadn’t been able to receive it with the twins because the twins had wanted to keep things private, so his approval of Draco seemed to mean twice as much. He gave Ron an appreciative grin before turning to find Draco already out of his seat and ready to go.
“Eloquent, as ever.” Draco smirked, stepping out onto the porch and locking the door behind him. “Where are we going?”
That scream was not caused by any curse or fire. It was more raw, and it scared him more than anything else in his whole miserable existence. Three bright blurs of red caught his attention and he forgot how to breathe. Two red-headed figures were bent over a third.
“He gave me a full-time position with painting lessons during downtime as an incentive to say yes. It would have been rude to refuse.” He smirked just a little.
“I love you, Harry James Potter. And I do not regret a thing.” Fred reached out to touch him, stopping just before he would have made contact and let his hand drop.
“There has to be some way we can-”
It was easy for him to say. He didn’t currently have his crush’s hands firmly planted on his hips. It made it rather hard to focus on anything else. Draco flexed his hands to stop Harry from moving and he complied, staring hungrily into those silver eyes.
“No! I just-” He sighed in frustration. “He said he didn’t have many friends and he’s been locked away and cut off from everything for a year, and I…. I just know what it feels like.”
She was waiting for him just off stage. Her violet eyes were regarding him with a mixture of exasperation and pity and Draco braced for the concerned friend speech.
It didn't take Malfoy very long to get Harry close again. All he had to do was look down into Malfoy's eyes and lose himself in the smoldering pools of molten mercury. His hips jerked forwards and his toes curled as his orgasm hit him with all the force of a tsunami.  He came harder than he had ever come in his life with Malfoy's name on his lips.
Draco blinked up at the bright midday sun as they exited the building.
From there the conversation moved on to Quidditch, then the uncomfortability of dress robes, then the merits of sparkling wine versus champagne. Draco was surprised at how easy it was to talk to Harry, and even more shocked that Harry continued to dance with him without complaint. They must have been on their fourth or fifth song by now. Yet here he was, in Draco’s arms, chatting happily away.
When he turned around he found his father standing there with a guarded expression and his mother hovering directly behind him. Lucius Malfoy cut an intimidating figure against the post-show chaos. He was wearing an impeccable black suit and tie with his white-blond hair cascading over his shoulders. He didn’t look angry, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t. Draco’s gaze flicked over to his mother who gave him an encouraging smile.
“That you have feelings for the boy. It’s painfully obvious.”
"Well, good thing you'll never have to find out then." Sirius barked a laugh and Harry joined in.
It all started at the Yule Ball so many years ago when she had asked him to dance. It happened slowly after that. A kind word here, a playful interaction there. When she started spending more time with Hermione in sixth year Harry had been happy to include her. After the war, he was only mildly surprised when Pansy started dedicating her time to help him start up the children's center. When it was up and running Pansy had begun volunteering on a daily basis until Harry had just hired her. She was in charge of all of the day-to-day management while Harry continued his work as an Auror. Her vision for the center was surprisingly similar to his own, so it was a convenient setup.
Their first date! 😍😍😍 Fair warning: there is cute fluff overload in this chapter. Not sorry at all, the boys deserve it after 24 chapters of angst. Now that I have reached such a good pausing point,  however, I *do* need to give my other fic some love. It's what would have happened if Regulus didn't die in the cave and ended up destroying all of the Horcruxes before Harry was even born. Pairings are Jagulus (Regulus Black/James Potter); WolfStar; Jily; and EVENTUALLY Drarry. It's called Power to Save the World if you're interested and you can find it on my profile. Keep in mind this doesn't mean I'm abandoning Home or going on hiatus with Home, updates will just be happening a tad slower because I'm going to be working on Power as well now.
“Yes, exactly.”
Even Theo had to admit the normally deliciously disheveled Gryffindor looked wretched. What had it cost Draco to make him look like that? He reached out and squeezed his thigh reassuringly and Draco flashed him a grateful smile, joining in the conversation again with just a little too much enthusiasm.
An incessant buzzing noise was the first thing Draco became aware of. He groaned and muttered the spell to silence his tempus charm, glaring at his clock. Why did they have to get started so early? Only the thought of seeing Harry got him out of bed and into the shower. The hot water relaxed his muscles as he fought off the grogginess that always accompanied rising with the sun. He would have to forgo tea today, he was in desperate need of a much stronger source of caffeine. The familiar scent of his apple shampoo helped wake him up and he soon fell into his usual morning routine. He finished showering quickly and dressed in comfortable black trousers and a long-sleeve black shirt. He paused when he grabbed his eyeliner, looking at the tube thoughtfully. His parents hadn’t seen him wearing it yet. Would they care? He had been wearing it almost daily since Harry had said it looked good on him, but he wasn’t sure his father would approve. He set it back down on the counter, deciding not to risk it, and went downstairs to make a pot of coffee.
“I’m sorry, I guess the memory is rather one-sided.” Harry allowed.
“Hey,” Harry replied with a smile that suggested he was just as elated to see Draco.
Shocked gasps and hurried whispers consumed the cloud of purple before they collected themselves.
"My mother is very wise." Draco gave her a tentative grin.
The pain of never being good enough.
“Morning, Potter!” His partner popped their head over their cubicle, leaning on the wall that they shared.
“You relatives never…?” Draco trailed off, unsure how to finish the sentence.
“Why not?” Draco took the white ball and placed it on its designated dot on the table.
“No no no.” Ron reached over Dean to flick Seamus in the ear. “Only I get to call him that.”
“I can’t even imagine you being simple.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Other than Hermione, you’re the smartest person I know.”
“I love you.” Draco collected their teacups and the now empty pot before ducking his head to give her a quick kiss on the cheek.
“Break a leg!” Everyone cheered and excitement began to overtake his panic.
“I’m sorry.” He all but whispered.
TRIGGER WARNING: There are mentions of Conversion Therapy towards the end of this chapter and evidence of egregious physical abuse. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term, conversion therapy is when parents send their gay children to the church to be converted or "cured" of their homosexuality and turned straight. Some...methods of conversion are more volatile than others. If this is triggering to you skip from the sentence that starts "Burns and scars..." to when Harry shouts "Fuck you!".
“Not broken, just coping.” he muttered as he turned on the shower.
“Draco.” He sighed in relief when he reached him.
“How did you know it was my birthday?” Draco stepped back and relieved him of the pie before ushering him into the kitchen.
"Drive safely." Draco said weakly.
Harry responded by rapping them over the head with his wand, casting the strongest disillusionment charm he possibly could.
“Hey.” Harry smiled as he sat down.
He heard his father’s voice mutter something behind him and watched in awe as Rookwood fell into a crumpled mass on the ground. He was screaming and twitching in pain as his father advanced on him.
“I’m sorry, she’s a what?” Draco choked on the fire whiskey he had been trying to drink.
“Why spoil the surprise?” Harry winked, offering his arm.
Harry looked like he had just been clubbed over the head before his expression darkened. He drew his hand back as if to slap or punch, but Draco never got the chance to find out which. At that exact moment, Vernon grabbed Harry’s wrist and the sleeve of his hoodie slipped, falling to expose a large portion of his forearm. All at once Draco was nauseous and filled with disgust. He had suspected self-harm was behind Harry’s constant use of long sleeves, but he could have never prepared himself for this.
“Can you do anything about my eyes?” He asked her, pointing unnecessarily at the black bags he knew stood out like a sore thumb.
"I told you." Harry placed a quick kiss on his cheek. "Now we do that exact same thing all the way around the rink."
Harry was trembling next to him, in rage or fear Draco didn’t know. It didn’t matter. They were upsetting Harry, and that was enough.
“You called me back for this? To tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure.” The Dark Lord smirked.
Draco had been right.
Draco cursed as he watched them apparate away. He had forgotten to set up their next study date.
“How can you possibly be this good when it’s the first time you’ve played?” Harry huffed back.
“Oh, it was undoubtedly the highlight of mine as well.” Draco picked up his wine and took a refined sip.
They played two games before Draco determined that he simply sucked at skee ball. Harry was a rather gracious winner and assured him that everyone was just as bad on their first go. They meandered over to something Harry called an air hockey table. Draco didn’t take a lot of convincing to try this game out and Harry was soon feeding two tokens into the table with relish. When the table began to hum Draco could feel cold air rising from the hundreds of tiny little holes on the table’s surface and ran his hand across it curiously. Harry handed him a heavy rubber disk with a round handle in the middle.
“All of those times I insulted you and called you spoiled- I mean, from what little you’ve told me I gathered your childhood wasn’t pleasant, but this-”
His chest felt tight- suffocating as if he was being squeezed to death and his head was caught in a loop of terror, shame, and remorse. He couldn’t think. He couldn’t breathe. A small part of him recognized he was being irrational. He knew he was overreacting, it was just a stupid room. Every time he was almost able to talk himself down the screams of the people he tortured would play on repeat in his mind and it set him off all over again. When he was finally able to stop his tears and unintelligible stammering his mother tightened her arms around him, allowing him time to calm his erratic breathing enough to where he could speak again.
“I can't believe they still leave this door unlocked after everything that has happened.” Vince snorted as Draco tried the door and it swung inward at his touch.
“Well, yeah.” Harry blinked. “Unless you don’t want me to?”
“Yeah, I guess I have. We actually get along surprisingly well.” Harry said bemusedly. “You know, when we’re not trying to hex each other.”
She stopped walking abruptly and grabbed his wrist, pulling him around to face her.
“Billiards, love. Are you good at billiards?” Harry smiled when Draco handed him one of the cue sticks that was apparently not quite up to his standard.
Harry was braced for ridicule but the laugh seemed genuine, not cruel or snarky. When she didn’t continue he tried again.
“Alright then.” She narrowed her eyes at him. “Midnight is in two hours, if I don’t see you before then come find me before the ball drops.”
Draco was rather pleased with how comfortable his new home had become. He had worked hard to make the place his own, and gazing around his kitchen he felt that he had succeeded. It felt warm and welcoming, almost calming. Draco was the farthest thing from calm. Hermione gave him a sympathetic smile and patted his hand reassuringly. Draco did not feel reassured in the least.
“Is literally everything still one big joke to you?” She shot him a sharp glance as she slid down the wall next to him and sat down.
“I don’t, really." She said matter of factly. "That’s just part of being in a long-distance relationship, I’m afraid. Whenever I start missing him too much I write him a letter. That’s the best we can do. In the meantime, I have you and Ron to help me feel less lonely. You can lean on us, you know that right?”
“Merlin, you’re going to make me say it.” Draco looked mortified as he pinched the bridge of his nose. He let out a heavy sigh before looking him straight in the eyes. “I fancy you, you sodding insufferable, idiotic, brain dead prat. I mean, honestly, is your skull filled with rocks, or just cobwebs?”
“Merlin’s baggiest testicle, how oblivious are you?” Ron slapped him on the shoulder.
I do not own Harry Potter or any of the characters.
“I can’t do this, Myrtle.” He moaned, wiping his lips with the back of his hand before standing up and heading back to the sink.
"You need to tell your father what?" She frowned.
“Perhaps your younger students were not old enough to hear about your role in the war or understand how much you had to go through to make the world they live in today even possible. To them, it may seem like you’re just forcing them to listen to tales of your glory days. I can think of a particular professor who did the same thing when I was in school and I thought he was an absolute wanker. Have you tried omitting anything personal from the curriculum now that you’re getting students who were too young to take part in the war?” Malfoy was twirling his quill thoughtfully.
“He is really dead. All of the horcruxes were destroyed before our duel.” Harry assured them.
“I was just thinking-  erm, it might help Malfoy feel more connected or whatever. If they did and he was invited” He said in a rush.
“Well, I've never seen Potter and Granger do anything to suggest a real relationship between them. I bet it’s a load of codswallop. Even Potter has got to have better taste than Granger.” Theo snorted, shooting Draco a conspiratorial wink.
He had always wanted to learn origami. Making intricate shapes and animals from a couple pieces of paper had a strange allure he just couldn’t explain.
“Nevermind that, you’re still dating Victor Krum?”
"You're covered in blood mate." Ron was staring pointedly at the dried blood on his chest.
“How would you feel if I was in love with someone and didn’t tell you?” She snipped.
“You get the same thing every time. Branch out, live a little. Try something new, Harry.” Pansy snarked, picking up her own menu to study it.
Draco stared down at his wand for a moment, appreciating the subtle shine of the polished hawthorn. Harry inched closer and Draco knew it was now or never.
“Yeah, fine.” Harry pulled the locket off and gave an involuntary sigh of relief as soon as Hermione took it from him.
“Yeah.” George smiled. “We need to at least grab a coffee or something so we don’t fall out of touch.”
“Harry, the snake....” Hermione said gently when he didn’t move after putting Fred down.
“No one is paying attention.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Dance with me?”
“It’s bureaucratic code for ‘we filed your request in the trash’.” Draco exchanged an exasperated look with his father. “No one wants to help us because we’re marked.”
Death Eaters who would have zero qualms about killing any muggleborn that crossed their path. Unfortunately, Hermione always ended up in just the wrong place at just the wrong time. It was part of her Gryffindor charm; she was a danger magnet.
“ORDER!” Kingsley had to use to sonorus charm to be heard above the din of shouting. The only people in the room not on their feet in outrage were himself and the three Malfoys. When quiet finally settled over the Wizengamot Kingsley canceled the charm and spoke in a calm, clear voice. “All questions need to be relevant to the case. We are examining Lucius Malfoy’s crimes. Let’s keep on topic.”
“I’ll have you know, my father is a saint.”
“The coffee. I took Pansy’s advice and tried something new. I don’t like it.” Harry wrinkled his nose at the strange nutty flavor that was lingering on his tongue.
Was he sure about that shirt with these pants? He would be going to meet Harry for coffee after the manor, shouldn’t he look his best?
“You’ll see, just trust me.” Harry beamed.
Harry's eyes flew open as he turned to see his two best friends standing in front of flickering green flames. His climax faltered and faded as he caught the looks on their faces. Malfoy pulled off his cock with an embarrassingly loud pop as he looked over at them in stunned silence.
“Sounds simple enough.” Draco smirked. “Anything else I should know?”
There were sounds of disapproval from the surrounding crowd, but Draco didn’t care.
"You have no idea." Harry laughed bitterly. "Thank you."
"Okay, that's all valid. Your feelings are valid, but Harry, don't think for one moment that those thoughts are true." Sirius reached out and pulled Harry into a hug. "You're not broken, you're coping."
“Take your what?” Ron was flabbergasted and Harry laughed despite himself.
"I thought as much. You have quite the swarm of Wrackspurts hovering around you. Come on, I can show you how to get rid of them." She grabbed Harry by the hand and began pulling him away.
"I'll pick you up at five thirty. Wear something comfortable." Harry stroked his jaw once before heading towards the hall.
“Cheaters!” Greg cried as he took off after them.
“Don’t touch me.” He hissed, finally braking from his detached demeanor to yank his arm out of Harry’s grasp. It happened so suddenly that it caught him off guard, knocking him off balance.
Alright, my lovelies! I am sorry for taking so long to update! I wanted to get my present for my best friend, better half, love of my life, and amazing beta reader finished. (It's called Dirty Little Secrets; Drarry pairing Muggle AU if you're interested.)
Blaise settled next to him, sitting much closer than he normally would dare and Draco made a snap decision.
The sound of soft voices caused his heart to hammer in his chest and he sped up. When he finally found his way into what might have been considered the living room of the shack he could feel himself noticeably relax.
“Harry, I-” He started.
"Weasel," Draco smirked at him.
This was a home. It was a good home. He definitely felt comfortable and welcomed here, but it wasn’t his home.
“What happened when Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley escaped the cellar?”
Draco's poetry is original poetry by yours truly.
Godric, what was happening to him?
“No one could ever like you.” Vernon snapped. “You’re a freak, a nobody. These people feel sorry for you, but eventually, they’ll see what a worthless waste of space you are and they’ll abandon you too.”
"But I'm not depressed, I'm not sad all the time and I don't want to kill myself I'm...I'm just… unhappy, I suppose. There are people who have it way worse than me." Harry couldn't look him in the eye so he stared at his wine instead.
“Then they’re going on about each other?” Ron blinked at her. She bit back a laugh when the comprehension dawned in his eyes. “Oh. They’ve got...they’re not… attracted to each other?”
"I make you happy?" Draco's chest flooded with warmth at the prospect.
"I thought you two…" Harry left off awkwardly, letting Draco spin him before pulling him back into his arms.
As soon as the door fell shut behind him Draco flicked his wand and set the lamps blazing. The dark blues and greens made everything feel like an underwater palace. The peculiar light from the bubble-like lanterns cast flickering shadows across Draco’s skin and Harry stared at him hungrily. When Draco moved farther into the entrance hall Harry’s eyes were drawn like a magnet to his unearthly attractive hips. He made a strained noise as the alcohol entwined with his hormones and he felt his cock twitch like he was a horny fourteen-year-old. Draco turned and looked at him with a strange expression, eyes darkening with lust when he took in Harry's rather hard predicament. Harry felt his blood grow hot at the lecherous want written all over his face. Without a word Draco stepped closer, reaching up to gently caress Harry’s cheek.
“Harry! The Horcrux!” Draco screamed.
"Tell us about Lucius Malfoy. How did he save your life?" the same witch squinted her eyes at the Malfoys.
Of course he would be here. Would he ever be done haunting him?
“Here you are, here’s the bathroom.” Luna said brightly, opening the door for him.
“We could meet up afterwards?” Granger sounded uncertain and Pansy was struck with a brilliant idea.
"No. Although if I liked girls, it might be her. I'm rather fond of brunettes. " Draco felt his face go scarlet. He did not just say that. To Harry bloody freaking Potter. The older students must have spiked the punch. That was the only explanation.
Harry reached out to take Bill’s hand and they both raised their wands, facing the window with their backs to Draco. Draco withdrew his own wand and retreated to the doorway to give them space, ready to cast at the first sign of trouble. Harry and Bill started chanting in Latin together and Draco could feel their combined power washing over the room. From what he could make out they were talking directly to the dark magic and banishing it in the fashion of the pagans. It was an ancient, powerful magic that Draco had thought was all but extinct.
Draco couldn’t stop the convulsions,
“What?” She gasped in outrage. “They’re the heathens! They’re polluting this place with their debauchery!”
As Deputy Head Auror, surely Harry would be more than happy to cleanse the Manor or all of the lingering curses and dark magic. It was a win-win situation. Not only would he be able to visit his parents without being overwhelmed by anxiety, but it would be an excellent excuse to see Harry. He pushed himself off of his black leather couch and strolled over to his desk, grabbing parchment and a quill.
Draco paused, trying to reign in his thoughts. He refused to confess his undying love for the Savior of the Wizarding World while on trial for being a Death Eater.
“Hold on Dobby, are you saying this….gilly weed will help me breathe underwater for an hour?” Harry dared not to believe it.
“They’ve only officially been together for two days.” She reminded him.
Seamus loudly asked Harry how being an Auror was treating him and they left Ron and Neville to their awkward little bubble.
“Ron! It’s your dad- He’s been attacked!” Harry was shaking so violently that his teeth started to chatter.
“You don’t have to follow him.” Theo muttered “What can he do to you? You don’t owe him anything”
He didn’t care if his behavior got him taken out of the lead role. Let them re-cast Tom Riddle this close to opening night. At least then he wouldn't be forced to deal with Harry when Harry clearly didn’t want to deal with him. He could hear someone chasing after him but he didn’t slow down. He was almost out of the auditorium. He pushed through the double doors and took a left in the atrium, ignoring the sound of a door opening and slamming as footsteps followed in his wake.

"I see." He said brokenly.
Harry’s words started to sink in and Draco felt the blood drain out of his face. There were only two marked Death Eaters in this castle. Pansy certainly was not one of them...but he was. Harry would never defend his honor like that. Not now that he had been tainted by the Dark Lord. He felt a sick twinge of jealousy towards Pansy before he was able to regain control over his emotions and shove his errant thoughts back into the farthest recesses of his mind.
“Yeah, alright.” Draco nodded, but his lips were thin with anxiety.
Except for his mother.
“You guys were always flirting in class.” Neville looked over at Harry with wide, round eyes. “Care of Magical Creatures that year was brutal. The tension between you was electric! I’m actually still shocked you guys didn’t get together back then. One way or another you guys were going to either get together or kill each other, no in-between.”
“Muggles come up with the strangest things.” Draco beamed as he watched the balloon bounce into the others.
“They also said the Dark Lord would be coming here tonight.” Greg failed at hiding the fear in his voice.
Ron smiled at Neville when he caught his eye and he flashed Ron a reassuring wink. Neville joining him on his crusade to make Draco feel welcomed filled him with a warm affection for the other man that had nothing to do with the alcohol already thrumming through his veins.
"I know that now." Neville chuckled. "Wish I would have realized it before wasting almost a year of my life on him, though."
“Oi, get a room that is preferably not mine.” He groused, smirking ever so slightly when they jumped apart as if they had been electrocuted.
“I’m so sorry, Ari.” Draco pulled him in for an uncharacteristic hug and Ari relaxed into him.
“Good. Take care of him, yeah? He tends to forget to take care of himself.” Bill locked eyes with him and Draco couldn’t help but feel he was missing something.
“Get to the door! We can negate the fire by vanishing the room!” He cried.
“We’ll catch you later.” Dean narrowed his dark ocher eyes at his boyfriend. “I’ve got to get this one home before he passes out on me and I have to carry his arse.”
“When you say you died in the forest, what do you mean? You look alive and well to me.” The demeaning wizard shot at him.
“Sorry if I was a little caught up in my own life. I’ve had my own issues to deal with without having to notice Malfoy’s.” He snapped.
“Thank you." She flushed beneath his praise. "Now that we’ve done a shot together, do I get to know your name?”
He grabbed for his friends in a panic, but it was hard to see. The massive room was already filling with smoke.
They were going to save Draco.
They took them to a muggle establishment that was off the beaten path and Draco stole glances at his father. Out of everyone, he would have the most issue dining with muggles. He looked perfectly at ease, however, and Draco relaxed.
Draco gave him a fond, exasperated glare before pulling out more bunched up tissue paper. He gasped softly when he found the sleek black box, pulling it out of the bag with a flourish.
Shite.
It turned out that an arcade was a dimly lit space overrun with kids and young adults screaming and laughing. Their shouts of joy and amusement only added to the cacophony of strange music and loud clacking of games in progress at every turn. Harry seemed to know exactly where he was going and led Draco straight to a blessedly less crowded alley of long sloping table-like structures that were only about knee-height.
“I did as I was told. I brought the rest of them to the cellar, but I cut their bindings. I didn’t know how, but I wanted to help them. I told them to keep quiet and that I would do what I could.”
"They don't count, numbskull." She rolled her eyes. "Who else in our year?"
“Just leave me be… I don’t want any company right now.” He whimpered, letting his head droop as his heart constricted. The squeezing sensation spread to his lungs and Draco struggled to breathe.
Draco let out a quiet sigh of relief and then leaned forwards to softly press his lips to Harry’s. It was a gentle, quick kiss, but it was enough to make Harry’s heart pound. Draco pushed Harry backward until they were both lying down and Harry held his breath.
“I see, what do you need? I can grab it for you in a moment, I just want to finish off this letter to my old mentor. He likes to keep in touch.” His father said distractedly, his attention focused on the parchment in front of him.
How had he gone from being mad at Malfoy and Snape to having a full-blown panic attack? There hadn't been any early stages, he just jumped right into the middle.
Shame and guilt fought for dominance in Draco’s overcrowded head. He let himself fall back onto his bed, running his fingers through his normally immaculate hair.
“Later, losers.” She rolled her eyes before taking off after Pansy and Theo.
Pansy caught his eye as she approached the tense knot of people and it reminded him of his father’s innocent match-making venture. Draco shook his head infinitesimally and she shot him a worried expression before joining Theo and Blaise instead. He took a deep breath and turned his attention back to his father.
“Kreacher.” Harry said warningly.
“Right.” Draco acknowledged. “Thank you.”
Bill’s expression grew slightly perplexed and he looked between him and Harry quickly before nodding to himself as if he figured something out. Draco had half a mind to ask him about it but decided it was better manners to pretend he didn’t notice.
“I missed you, Pans.” He said softly, returning her bear hug with one of his own.
The pub was overcrowded as usual, even for a weekday. The dim overhead lighting did nothing to brighten the atmosphere. The dark wood walls seemed to absorb any light before it could reach the patrons and the stench of stale beer and sweat was heavy in the air. There was a cacophony of angry drunks shouting, wasted witches loudly singing along with the Weird Sisters off-key, and the strange clacking of multiple games of billiards being played on the opposite end of the bar. It was almost overwhelming and Harry wondered idly, not for the first time, why they always used this particular pub for their monthly Gryffindor nights.
Harry took off, gliding across the ice. He seemed to be shifting his weight to whatever foot was in front as he moved and Draco thought it looked simple enough. He turned around and looked at Draco expectantly and Draco took a steadying breath. He pushed off, trying to copy Harry's movements. At first, everything was fine, but then his left skate slipped and Draco went down. He sat on the ice for a moment, blinking rapidly as he tried to deduce where he went wrong. Harry was in front of him in an instant, offering his hand to help him up while he tried to hide his laughter.
“This is definitely the most challenging role I’ve been in.” Harry hummed in agreement. “But I don’t think I’ve ever been this confident, both in the rest of the cast and in myself.”
Draco had owled him last night asking if he knew any good curse breakers, and Harry had a feeling he knew why. The remnants of Voldemort and his followers still haunted the halls of his childhood home. Harry would gladly have purged the Manor on his own, but there were just some things that you needed curse breakers for. This was one of them.
“The Malfoy trial.”
“It has been a while since the three of us got together.” Harry agreed.
“I’ll take that as a compliment, Potter.”
Bellatrix started laughing once more and Voldemort’s harsh laughter joined hers. Harry felt like his head was about to split open. He sat up so quickly he almost bashed his head against the top bunk, not that he would have noticed the pain.
Merlin, his soft hands felt absurdly good on his dick.
“If Healer Grey trusts him, then I suppose I do too.” Harry tried to sound polite.
“I think I have just enough tokens left.” Harry started walking towards it and Draco followed.
"You were depressed at my age?" Harry was skeptical. He seemed so confident in all of his younger pictures.
“Draco? What about him?” Pansy scrunched up her face in confusion.
“How did I do?” He asked breathlessly.
“For a brand new artist without any kind of renown? I might be able to sell it for three hundred galleons. Possibly more if we find the right buyer.” He held his chin in his hand thoughtfully.
There! Just now! Draco saw Harry’s eyes open infinitesimally.
“Yeah, alright.” Harry said weakly.
“Godric, are you always this much of an arse?” The red-headed lemming snipped.
“They made a deal with Death, what, like the Peverell brothers?” Harry perked up.
Now that he was painfully aware that he had feelings for Draco, what was he going to do about it?
He frowned when his quill made a line too thick, throwing the entire image off balance. This was the problem with drawing using a quill. There was no margin for error. He pulled back and looked at his handiwork. If he could darken the details on the other side….
“Embarrassing secrets, you say?” Draco picked up the bottle and took a quick gulp. “Such as…?”
"It isn't fair. I've been so happy- I have no reason to feel this way.” Harry growled in frustration, pulling at his hair with the hand Draco wasn’t currently holding captive.
*******
He had faced his dragon and he had won.
“I’m starting to understand why this Tournament was discontinued two hundred years ago. I can't believe they brought it back...” Theo frowned.
“My mother would skin me alive if I just ignored him. That’s rude” Draco almost laughed. He welcomed the support, leaning his head against Theo’s for a moment.
“Could be.” Draco almost choked. “I never really interacted with them much. They’re Gryffindors, you see.”
“Any action she might have taken in support of Voldemort of her own free will was simply her performing her wifely and motherly duties to the best of her ability. Her loyalty is to her family and she was only doing what she thought was best for them. You can’t fault her for loving her family.”
Draco didn’t know how to respond to that.
“Draco!” a high pitched squeal announced the arrival of the other party guests.
Maybe his mother could bring one of her friends.
“As soon as possible. Tomorrow?” Harry wasn’t sure he could hold out for another day after getting used to seeing Draco on a daily basis over the past three weeks. It was ridiculous how much he had come to enjoy his time with the Malfoy heir.
“Like this,” Harry grabbed the blue balloon and brought it down to eye level, pinching the latex so he could poke a hole without popping it. “Hand me that quill, will you?”
Percy’s jink hit Thicknesse square in the chest and he dropped to the floor, clawing at his abdomen in obvious discomfort. In the blink of an eye, the man was replaced by some form of sea urchin.
“Can I just reschedule for when Healer Grey will be back?” Harry held onto one last shred of hope.
“I feel...comfortable around you, I suppose.” He finally said once he felt like he was back in control.
Draco blinked rapidly when he pulled back and Harry couldn’t help but grin at his stunned expression.
“So it is.” Draco hummed, hiding an amused smirk behind his own cup.
“She just-”
Hello my lovely readers! I had originally intended on making the Final battle one big chapter, but Draco's side of the story demands to be written- so here we are. This is The Final Battle Part I. As always a HUGE thank you goes out to my lovely beta readers, AlexClio and SandZhark! If it weren't for them this fic would not be nearly as good! If you've stuck with me this long, THANK YOU! If you're just joining, WELCOME! Please please please please PLEASE comment! (and leave kudos if you haven't yet!) Your comments fuel my writing. The more comments I get, the faster you get a new chapter! With that said, this chapter is a feels trip. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it!
“Thank you, Pansy.” Draco leaned into her embrace, letting her hug bolster his strength. “I really appreciate you.”
“Father lied.” Draco said, his voice flat.
Harry shot one last wave to his friends before trudging off towards the Dursleys. It would be nice to not have to pretend to be alive. The Dursleys wouldn't notice. Even if they did, they wouldn’t care. He was free to wallow. To watch Cedric die every time he closed his eyes without needing a silencing charm. It would be a relief to just stay in his room, make no noise, and pretend he doesn’t exist. So in between scavenger hunts for news and the occasional walk to blow off steam, that is exactly what he did. As time wore on he became less apathetic and more angry. Why didn’t anyone trust him? Why wouldn’t they tell him anything? Why was he, the one who watched Voldemort return, forced to find clever ways to listen to the Muggle news because no one would tell him what was going on?! Anger was an emotion. Emotions were healthy, right? Being angry was better than being numb, so he ran with it.
He had tried multiple times to get the hearing date moved up, but apparently, there was some red tape even the Savior of the Wizarding World couldn’t cut through.
“Cheers, Potter. I thought we had made progress.” Draco winced, appearing offended. “Run along then. You can tell Healer Grey what a terrible healer I am next week.”
“Brilliant.” Harry started to smile and immediately stopped. Apparently, certain lip movements tweaked his nose just enough to make it shoot pulsating pain through his cheeks bones.
Draco tried to answer but he couldn't find the breath to say anything. He couldn't even nod or shake his head. Flashes of the past two months rendered him motionless. Greg and Vincent's voices sounded like they were getting farther away the more he tried to focus on them. Draco couldn't move a muscle. It was like he had been petrified, but this wasn't due to any type of magic. Pure panic rolled off of him in waves. Greg wasted no time in slapping him across the face.
“There will be time for that later, now you need to rest. I will leave these two with you, but be warned; I will be back in twenty minutes' time to collect them and have Poppy administer you a strong dose of dreamless sleep. Am I understood?”
“And knowing their true names binds them to the king?” She clarified and Draco was impressed with how much of the story she was able to retain. “How can he control Thorn? Does magic even work on dragons?”
“Did you witness Narcissa being placed under the imperious curse?” A wizard from the back row called.
“You won’t use anything I say against me?” Harry snorted.
How could the Wizengamot be so incredibly stupid? It was an open and shut case. There was overwhelming evidence. He had even testified under veritaserum. What was there to deliberate over?
“Er, just that it’s kind of like...us. We’re so different and people would probably never think that we’d be good together, but I think we complement each other.” Harry tugged on his ear in embarrassment and Draco reached across the table to take his hand.
“We’ll see if it sticks.” Harry shot him a lopsided smile and Draco’s heart melted just a little bit.
“It must have been an interesting relationship. How did that happen?” Draco climbed up onto one of the stools with as much poise as he could manage.
Draco.
“Why do I like you?”
“I wonder why she’s back empty-handed.” Theo frowned.
“Whatever he wants.” Draco mumbled just as Harry said “My boyfriend.”
“Hagrid was delayed in coming to the feast, much like our precious chosen one.” He sneered malevolently, moving to allow Harry to enter the grounds.
“The logic here is pretty simple. You’re not the one who attacked me, therefore it wasn’t your fault. Lighten up, Malfoy, or I’m going to have to make you sit with your parents.” Bill poked at him.
"Shite, Draco are you ok?" Vince was squinting at him.
It wouldn’t last. It never did.
“How dare you strut about, boasting that mark so brazenly?” A younger witch hissed, pulling away from him as if he were venomous when someone in the angry mob shoved him towards her.
“This isn’t the usual stuffy Ministry party.” He observed as the opening notes of the HobGoblins’s latest hit took over the last few strains of a song by the Weird Sisters.
Maybe he had misread the signs. Every lingering glance might have simply been professional courtesy. All of the playful jokes could have been just an attempt to diffuse the hostility of their past. Every fond eye roll could have merely been for his benefit. Each casual touch that had set his skin on fire could have purely been accidental. Was he projecting his inane attraction and reading too deeply into things?
“Thank you. I thought the Witch Weekly readers would eat it up.” Pansy smirked. "I think it was quite clever of me."
“Thank you so much for your time, I really appreciate it.” She shrunk the painting and put it safely away in her bag before digging out her coin purse.
There was a commotion to one side and everyone but Harry and the Dark Lord turned to look. Augustus Rookwood pushed his way into the circle, took one look at the situation and pointed his wand at Harry’s back.
"Andi, would you mind if Draco joined me and Teddy for our zoo trip?" Harry interjected as Teddy tried to wiggle out of his grasp.
She was free.
If you read the last chapter summary and were left confused, this chapter is what the last half of that summary was referring to. If not, then you probably didn't read this one either and it's a moot point. Cheers!
“What? Oh, yeah…” He pulled the diadem from his wrist. It looked like it was bleeding, a sticky black substance leaking out of the yellowed crystals. It let out a quiet scream of pain before shaking violently and breaking apart in his hands.
“If he decides to show up.” Pansy rolled her eyes.
“Oh, Merlin. What?” Draco rolled his eyes dramatically.
“Hey, stranger. Funny meeting you here.”
He lifted his head wearily, checking the reflection in the mirror to make sure Myrtle was keeping her distance. His heart froze then kicked into overtime.
Draco was frozen in shock for only a few seconds before melting completely into Harry. Harry let out a soft moan of approval as Draco pulled him closer. He released Draco’s face in favor of wrapping his arms around his neck, pulling himself up to Draco’s height so he could deepen the kiss. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, tossing the forgotten drawings onto the sofa behind them as he tentatively licked at Harry’s lips. Harry granted entrance instantly, meeting his tongue in a playful struggle for dominance. Eventually, Draco won and Harry simply let himself get lost in the bliss that was kissing Draco Malfoy. Harry loved the feeling of having Draco in his arms and the way their bodies seemed to fit together like a puzzle. He loved the overwhelming scent of jasmine, cloves, and petrichor that filled his nostrils as he pressed himself impossibly closer. He loved the faint taste of tea that lingered on Draco’s tongue. He loved the feel of Draco’s incredibly soft hair slipping through his fingers and the overwhelming blaze of desire that was raging in his veins.
“You mean I know some gossip that you don’t?” Draco laughed incredulously.
They arrived in one of the private rooms in the Three Broomsticks without incident and were directed out of the bar and down the lane. Of course the Dark Lord would want to set up camp in the Shrieking Shack. When they finally found a way inside Draco almost turned right back around. His murderer of a godfather and the other Death Eaters were already in council together. Draco was sickened by the sight of Severus. He supposed he should be grateful, if he hadn’t killed Dumbledore Draco would have had to. That logic failed to reach his churning stomach, but nevertheless, he had to endure. Sod the world, save himself. Harry too, if he could help it.
Theo’s jaw dropped as the redhead turned and pulled Draco into a passionate kiss. When they broke apart they both downed their drinks and slipped out the back. Was he dating both of them?
"Oh, sweetheart, of course. I would love to have a relationship with you." Andromeda couldn't contain herself any longer, rushing forward and wrapping him up in a motherly hug. "In fact, I already sent an owl to your mother inviting her for tea this weekend. I penned it as soon as I got home."
“Look, I know I have a lot to answer for. I’ve been forced into some disastrously bad decisions and blinded by my upbringing, and I know that this is only the beginning- but I don’t want to talk about that tonight.”
“Well, my hair was boring and bland for one.” Ari made a face at the memory of his mousey brown hair, running his fingers through his now emerald green locks to reassure himself that he was no longer hopelessly dull. “Completely unremarkable and certainly not memorable. We never directly interacted either, so I’m sure that doesn’t help.”
"Any time." Harry rolled his eyes, holding out his arm. "Shall we?"
"Oh, I am more than serious, Potter." Malfoy breathed before crashing his lips onto Harry’s.
