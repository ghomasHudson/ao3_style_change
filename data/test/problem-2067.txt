So I ended up cleaning the windows, mowing the lawn, trimming the flowerbeds, pruning and watering the roses and repainting the garden bench on my birthday. And when I was finished Aunt Petunia gave me two slices of bread and a lump of cheese for dinner, while the roast pork was sizzling in the oven for their dinner party.
And I don’t know if you know what happened then, if the slivers I saw were you, or if they were just lingering parts of you. And it doesn’t matter. The words you, or your lingering parts told me gave me the strength to get home, and that’s all that matters.
“No,” Harry shouts as Pettigrew raises the wand and then grabs Draco’s arm with his other hand. He pulls Draco towards him, turns him around and then points the wand at Draco’s throat. Harry freezes on the spot. His heart hammers in his ears. His eyes are locked on Draco’s.
“And what is that?” Harry asks. He places his free hand on the table and leans a little forward. Draco wants to pull him back into his seat, wants to tell him it’s all useless. There is no way a Muggle treatment can solve their problem. Nothing can.
Hermione hugged me and then we both went our separate ways. Hermione up the west tower and me down to the dungeon. All my roommates were already asleep when I got there and I went to bed quickly. It wasn’t until the next morning that the Slytherins heard about the attack on Mrs Norris and that I had been in the middle of it all. I got asked if I had lost us any points and when I guaranteed them I hadn’t most of them let it go, except of course Nott and Crabbe. They keep joking that I will go after the Mudbloods next, me the great Harry Potter, the heir of Slytherin.
“I’m not sad,” Draco answers. “I’m jealous. Of them, of Hermione, of Pansy.” He shakes Harry off him and storms away.
Harry snaps his head around and looks at Draco. Draco looks straight at Harry and repeats his words. “This is not a fluke. I mend it when I just told you that I love you. Just because I’m not ready to switch sides in this war, doesn’t mean I didn’t mean them. Because I do. Harry, I mean them. I love you and, Salazar, I’m scared of what that means.”
“Yes, it is. But what can you do about it? Just be glad he never took that job at the Aurors, or you would have had to see him every day,” his wife answers.
Just when all hope seems lost a bright wolf runs up to them. The Dementor raises and turns around. Harry looks and sees his Uncle Remus standing in the door of the carriage, his wand stretched out and a stern look on his face.
It’s Hermione that shows up moments later and who helps Neville. Neville gets up, turns to Harry and hugs him. “You fool,” he says. It’s enough to break the dam. Harry slacks against his brother and cries. Neville holds him up and lets him. Harry can hear Ron mutter behind him, asking what the bloody Merlin happened.
It’s almost time for the Easter dinner now, I can’t believe how the time flew when Malfoy and I were talking. We first talked about the plan to stop Nott and Crabbe. And then we talked about the upcoming exams. Malfoy told me his father expects him to be top of the class, but he thinks Hermione will beat him in most subjects. I told him his father would still be proud of him when he becomes second. I don’t think Malfoy thinks that is true, he still smiled at me and thanked me. I told him that my aunt and uncle won’t care how I do with my exams and that they don’t really care about me at all. Malfoy found that hard to believe.
‘I asked Professor Lupin, my uncle, if he knows of ways for you to learn to cast. Because I think you can’t. And if you can, I’m sorry. That’s why I should have talked to you first. And also to hear if you want any extra help with this. Lupin told me to go talk to you first. But he thinks that Professor Flitwick might be able to help. Lupin said he’s been reading up on how to teach deaf wizards to master magic. He could help you. But Lupin won’t go talk to him until you say it’s okay. I’m sorry. I really am. I should have come to you first. I just want to help. I don’t want to make it worse.’
“But what I was about to say. I’m here to ask a favour from all of you. As you might have heard, as nothing ever stays a secret in this school, our champions will have to retrieve something from the Great Lake tomorrow. These somethings are the person that they will miss the most,” Dumbledore explains.
“Malfoy walked away,” Neville says. He waves his hand in the air without lifting his head. Harry tugs on his tie and then pretends to focus on what Binns is saying.
“Doing my homework with Malfoy and practising BSL with him,” Harry answers. He won’t be able to keep it from his friends and Hermione was right. Ron and Neville won’t make fun of it.
“I have no idea what you're talking about,” Draco says. “All I can say is that during dinner, Teddy wants to make an important announcement, and until then, both of you know nothing.”
Riddle looked at me with an angry look. He said I disappointed him. He had been so curious about me ever since Draco had told him that I had defeated the Dark Lord twice in my short life. And then I tried to kill myself, like a helpless little child. He just had to meet me, and seeing how much Draco and I care about each other, he just knew that I would come to his rescue if Draco would be in danger. So Riddle had made Draco write his own farewell on the wall and come down here. Draco cried at first, Riddle said, he thinks Draco finally realised that had been him all along. Only it was already too late, he had put too much of himself in the diary, into Riddle, so much so that Riddle could leave the pages of his diary, slowly killing Draco while he was waiting for me.
“I wasn’t scared,” Pettigrew says. “I was the only one who understood. The Dark Lord was the way forward for wizards.”
Another week went by without Hagrid. Hermione and I even got into a small fight because of it all. She said something about how good the Care for Magical Creatures lessons are now and I just lost it. Draco tells me I should control my anger better, that it’s not Hermione’s fault and that I shouldn’t blame her. And I know he’s right, so the next day I apologised to Hermione. She also said that she should have been more considered and all is good between us again.
Hermione is driving me insane! She has made herself a study schedule because exams are only eight weeks away. And she’s been bugging me, Ron and Neville to do the same. She’s been complaining about it for the last two weeks, saying the exams will be here before we know it. As if it isn’t bad enough already that we have stacks of homework for this Easter holiday. It’s been really hard to relax with Hermione reciting all her work or practising wand movements. I’m hiding from her right now. Malfoy thinks it’s very funny, he’s been trying to hide his laugh since I walked into the dormitory.
But that wasn’t the most surprising thing that happened that afternoon. Once Moody had taken Neville to his office, Ron and Hermione walked back to the Great Hall together and talked during a rushed dinner. I couldn’t keep my eyes off it, seeing Hermione smile at Ron. But then she hurried off, back to the library that she had been visiting a lot these last couple of days, leaving Ron to just stare at the doors where she had disappeared through.
“They would die before they would give us up,” Harry says. They would have run for cover by now if they wouldn’t. They went down the trap door with them and faced danger to keep Voldemort from getting the Philosopher’s Stone. And last year they defended Neville, even when the entire school turned against him. They are here for it all. And they would never betray Neville and Harry. Only Neville doesn’t seem convinced.
Blaise’s eyes stay on Draco, and Harry feels grateful knowing he's not the only one concerned about Draco's wellbeing. And it’s a legitimate question. One Harry has been asking himself for weeks now.
‘Professor Lupin said we can use his classroom to practice BSL,’ he writes. ‘I thought you would prefer that. Then nobody can see.’
We got to spend the night in the Great Hall while the Professors searched the castle. Headmaster Dumbledore waved his wand around to clear the Hall of all the tables and make purple sleeping bags appear. The colour of the sleeping bags lightened the mood a little when Blaise joked that Dumbledore was as gay as they get with his love for purple. We all crammed together in a corner (we is Blaise, Greg, Daphne, Luna, Hermione, Draco and I) and wondered how Black had gotten into the castle. Which turned into a lesson from Hermione about how the castle was protected and you can’t apparate in. And then Draco wondered out loud why Black had gone for Gryffindor Tower when it was Harry he wanted to kill. Well, you can imagine that this was a shock to all our other friends and we had to explain to them that I had overheard the Tonks family when they had a fight about telling me or not. We think that maybe Black thinks I’m in Gryffindor since both of my parents were in Gryffindor. That it was a mistake on his part.
“Someone didn’t believe that Malfoy would be the person I would miss the most,” Harry tells her. The pinkie on top of his squeezes lightly and Harry feels his cheeks heat up. He isn’t sure, but someone wouldn’t hold your pinkie if they didn’t care, would they?
Andromeda shakes her head, and Harry laughs. “That’s good advice from your grandma. We wouldn’t want to spill the tea you made us,” he says.
Harry turns so he can look at the Shrieking Shack. “No, I don’t think they ever considered that friends could do something like that,” he says. Wormtail used to join them on the nights Remus needed his friends. He was one of them. He was supposed to fight on their side and help keep Neville and Harry safe. Harry will never understand what could have made Pettigrew betray all his friends and side with Voldemort. Nothing is more important than friends and family.
I brought up Professor Moody. I still don’t like him, not after how he treated Draco. But Sirius says he’s a good guy, always tried to bring in the Death Eaters alive. He’s not a killer, according to Sirius. So, for now, I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt, even though I still think he’s crazy for blaming children for thinks their parents supposedly did. But Sirius trust him and I trust Sirius.
Draco doesn't answer. Harry sighs and walks into the bathroom. He turns on the light and looks into the room. He doesn’t move as he stares at the bottles on the floor. Harry didn’t think they had any left in the house. He would have gotten rid of them otherwise. He closes his eyes and then turns rapidly. He’s at the edge of the bed in seconds.
“Oh, fuck,” Harry says. He turns around and grins at Wood. “I’ll be right there, Wood. Family emergency,” Harry tells him.
James’ features soften and he reaches out so he can ruffle Harry’s hair again. “Fuck,” he says, “this is worse than when Padfoot came out. At least he wasn’t as clueless as you.”
“I won’t,” Harry says. He shuffles his foot over the dirt path. “I’ll manage. Exams are still a couple of weeks away.” He has no idea how he will manage it. He can’t open a book without missing Draco. But he also knows his friends are right. If he doesn’t get his act together, he might need to repeat third year. And it will also mean he will have to stop Quidditch. Students with failing grades are not allowed on the team. And that will put a big dumper in his plan to become a professional Quidditch player after he’s done with school.
And that is how this year went from being fun to being a nightmare. I’ve got no idea how I’m going to get passed all the trials ahead of me. Not now there are so little friends left that want to help me. But at least I’ve got Draco and Hermione on my side, a godfather that looks out for me and a head of house who’s let me know that if anyone is giving me a hard time, he will put them on detention, making them clean slugs and other nasty tasks.
Neville hasn’t said another word about their little talk in Hogsmeade yesterday. Not that Harry is afraid Neville will out him or anything. It’s just weird that more and more people know. Mum had written a long letter to Harry after he told his dad. She went on and on about how brave Harry was for sharing and that she will stand by him no matter what. Harry had smiled when she started about Malfoy and how Harry shouldn’t listen to his father or his Uncle Sirius. Not everyone in Slytherin is horrible. She used Professor Snape as an example, how he is her friend and a good man. Harry doesn’t see that. Professor Snape is horrible. He always takes points from them for no good reason. And he hates that Harry is a better Seeker than his dad ever was, eliminating all chances for Slytherin to win the Quidditch Cup.
Harry turns away from the mantle and looks around the room. Next to the couch stands a basket filled with magazines and books. Harry points his wand and utters another Evanesco.
“He got past them before,” Harry says. “He’s got a special way to get around. He will be in the castle in no time. Trust me.”
“You don’t have to lie and say it’s different, or all in my head,” Harry says. “I know he doesn’t want me. It’s just hard to forget.” He pushes his hair out of his face. “And it fucking hurts.”
The minutes dragged by and I felt sad and lonely, even with Draco walking next to me. So I dog up my courage and told Draco I was sorry he had gotten into trouble because of me and that I missed him. Draco didn’t say anything back and when I looked up at him I saw he was crying. When Draco noticed that I was looking at him he whipped an arm over his eyes. In a soft voice, he said he missed me too. But his father had been very angry with him and it had scared him. I said again that I was sorry and asked if we’ll ever be okay. He said we would and he said he was sorry for ignoring me.
Draco places a kiss on Hermione’s forehead and then one on Rose’s. “I’ll see you both soon,” he says. Then he takes Harry’s hand, and together they walk out of the room.
“I don’t understand,” Harry says next to Draco. “Everything was fine. He’s still sick all the time.” Draco can hear the tears in his words, knows Harry’s heart is breaking. Harry’s free hand strokes some of Draco’s hairs out of his face, and then his thumb slides over Draco’s cheek.
It all happened in a flash, one moment we where patting Buckbeak and the next Draco was lying on the ground, blood pouring out of his arm. Buckbeak was standing over Crabbe and Hagrid tried to wrestle him back into his collar. Of course, Crabbe was fine, Buckbeak hadn’t hurt him, but he was still screaming that he was dying. Hermione told him to shut up and she and Blaise almost got into a fight with Crabbe and Nott. I don’t know how that ended, because I was running after Hagrid who had taken Draco in his arms and was rushing him up the hill back to the castle.
A soft knock on the bathroom door brings Draco and Harry back to the rest of the world. The bathroom door opens a little. “I’ve been by the cafeteria and got you guys some fish and chips. Hermione says greasy food always helps, so we decided to deliver some. I’ve left it on the kitchen counter under a stasis spell,” Ron tells them.
Malfoy still doesn’t show up to the DADA lessons. Harry worries that Malfoy might fail this year if he keeps away for too long. So, after classes end on Wednesday, Harry goes to Remus’ office to ask for his help.
“I wanted egg sandwiches,” Draco tells Teddy. Teddy laughs and tells Draco he can have them when Teddy is at his grandma’s. Draco shakes his head and then lifts Teddy into the air. Teddy giggles and holds out Dragon to make him fly with him. Draco pulls Teddy back against his chest before he walks them out of the room and down the stairs.
I’ll keep you informed on how Sirius is doing, I know you would want to know. And about all things concerning the war against Voldemort. Dinner is ready, so I’m off now.
After that, the Headmaster introduced Professor Lupin and both me and Draco didn’t miss the look of loathing on Professor Snape’s face. I wonder why Snape hates Professor Lupin that much, I know he wants the DADA job, but I’m sure it’s more than just that. Draco thinks they maybe know each other somehow, says they are around the same age, so maybe they went to school together and didn’t get along or something.
“Shut up,” Harry says. “I’m kissing my boyfriend. I’ll catch you up later.” Then he turns back to Draco and places another kiss on his lips. Draco laughs into the kiss and then pushes Harry to the side.
We could all see the dog drag Ron backwards into a large gap in the roots of the Whomping Willow. We tried to get close, but the branches of the Whomping Willow prevented us from getting to him. Ron had hooked one leg around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground. There was a horrible crack, followed by Ron’s screams and then he had disappeared. The dog had pulled so hard that it had broken Ron’s leg.
Harry knows that Malfoy studies in the library from time to time. Hermione loves to drag Harry to the library in the hope Harry will focus on his homework for once. The last couple of times Harry has spotted Malfoy there. Always at the same table. It didn’t help Hermione’s plan to get Harry to study. Normally he already is bound to find ways to do as little for school as possible. And there are always people that want to talk to him. About the upcoming Quidditch match against Slytherin or other non-school-related stuff. And now Harry has an extra reason to be distracted. He can watch Malfoy in the library and figure out how to make him talk to Harry. And today, Harry has figured out the perfect plot. He’ll join Malfoy in the library and study with him, no matter if Malfoy likes it or not.
“What are you on about?” Lily asks when she steps up to them. Her dress is dirty from the work in the garden and she takes Harry’s empty lemonade glass from him.
A tear falls from Harry’s eye as he raises his wand. It’s the only way. Harry has tried everything else. Even two bottles of whiskey hadn’t been enough. It’s time to take drastic measures.
Remus checks Malfoy and nods his head. “He’s still in one piece. Only unconscious at the moment. Let’s get him into an empty compartment.”
"Look, just spend a quiet Christmas with him, show him you love him, and I'm sure things will start to get better soon, " Ron says.
Draco knew something was bothering me, but I told him I would tell him later, where not everyone could hear. Draco agreed and we eat in silence. Hermione joined us later with the cloak hidden underneath her robes. Once dinner was done we hid away in an empty chamber off the Entrance Hall until the coast was clear. It was a bit tricky to all fit under the cloak because we’ve all grown a bid, mostly Draco, but we managed. Draco pulled me close to him with his arm around my waist and Hermione pushed into Draco’s other side.
“Fuck no, I don’t want to start my new year at the place that scarred me for life,” Draco says. He hands some glasses to Ron, takes one for himself and pulls a bottle out of Hermione’s hand. He walks out of the kitchen and back to the living room where the rest of the party is booming.
‘That explains why you are so lousy at every subject that is more difficult than Divination,’ Malfoy writes
Things got even worse during our last lesson on Monday: Defence Against the Dark Arts with Professor Lockhart. Hermione thinks he’s amazing and Ron is acting all jealousy. I just wished he wouldn’t single me out, so Nott wouldn’t have fuel for his new jokes about me dating Lockhart. And his lessons are an even bigger joke than those of Professor Quirrell. The first thing he made us do was take a test where all the questions were about him. Like what his favourite colour is and things like that.
“Since he drooled all over Digory last year during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff,” Ginny says.
“Yeah, fuck yes, Draco. Forever,” Harry answers. Their hands intertwine on Harry’s chest, and Harry turns his head to the back so he can kiss Draco. Something sharp hits his lips and Harry can taste his own blood on his lips. Draco doesn’t seem to mind as his trust intensify and the kiss deepens. He takes Harry in his hand and strokes him in tandem with his trusts. A perfect pleasure fills Harry and he comes hard.
Hermione puffs. “Please God, help us,” she says. “The Potter brothers are going to get themselves killed.”
“Gross,” Teddy comments from the doorway making Harry and Draco laugh into their kiss just before they separate. Harry slides his free hand over Draco’s stomach and leaves it there while he rests his head on Draco’s shoulder again. Draco looks at Teddy who looks at them with small eyes. Draco wonders what the little kid thinks of them from time to time.
Remus looks at the Willow and then smiles at Harry. “Sirius will take care of me,” he says. They moved into a little cottage in Hogsmeade a couple of days ago, so they can be together on most nights and during the weekend.
Time goes on. Christmas comes and goes and soon the next year has started. Draco spends a lot of time with Sirius when Harry’s uncles are at the Potter household. Harry says he doesn’t mind, but he kind of wants to be included in their little talks. Only, Draco looks happier than Harry’s ever seen him, so Harry swallows his own wants and stays out of their way. Neville teases him constantly with his crush. If he wasn’t Harry’s brother, Harry would have hexed him already.
I’ll keep you informed of how my holiday is going and will let you know as soon as I know how Draco is doing.
It seems that Dobby is bound to serve one family and he had to punish himself because he almost spoke ill of them. He will also punish himself when he gets back home because his family doesn’t know that he came to see me. He can’t escape them, he needs to be set free. So I asked him if I could help him and that just made him wail again. He said he had heard of my greatness, but not of my goodness. I told him I wasn’t great, that I’m not even top of my class, that Draco and Hermione are fighting over that position. It was painful thinking of them, so I stopped that line of the conversation.
Uncle Remus pretends as if Malfoy hasn’t missed multiple lessons. He just gives Malfoy a note that he wants to talk to him at the end of class. Harry helps Malfoy with the assignment of the day. Malfoy can’t cast, but he practises the movement and that is good enough for now. Harry waits for him after class and they walk to the library together. Malfoy explains that he has to do some extra work to catch up on the subjects he missed. Harry helps him with the work and before they know it, they are extremely late for dinner and Harry has to run to not be late for his Quidditch practice.
“I won’t fail them,” Harry says. But he does pull his Charms book out of the pile and looks up the Glacius Charm. He might just try to get something on paper. His hand feels heavy when he picks up his quill. Harry stares at his parchment. Why is it so hard to focus and just do it? Harry used to do this all the time. It was no issue when Draco was by his side. Draco, whose grey eyes would glitter when Harry would finally get something after Draco explained it to him. Draco, who studied so hard to learn BSL so he could keep up with the conversation around him. And he did it all next to all the extra work he did for school. Harry is sure that if Draco hadn’t been deaf, he would have been the smartest person in their year, giving Hermione a run for the top of class each year.
“Oh, that’s a Grindylow,” Remus says. “We’ll be talking about them in your next class. You want to take a closer look?”
Harry takes a better hold of his broom and points it upwards. The Snitch goes into the cloud and Harry follows it. Cold rain slashes against his face, but Harry doesn’t take his eyes off the Snitch. It’s so close. Harry stretches out his arm and speeds up a little more.
I found Draco lying on the floor, between the feet of a high statue of a wizard with a face that was ancient and monkeyish. It had a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard’s sweeping stone robes. I sprinted towards Draco, begging him not to be dead. I flung my wand aside, grabbed Draco’s shoulders and turned him over. His face was white as marble and he felt cold to the tough. His eyes were closed and I was afraid I was too late. I hugged Draco against my chest and begged Draco to wake up.
Healer Burke just makes a note on the file and smiles at them. “Okay, well there isn’t anything else I can do for you. Well, maybe there is. There is this test Draco could take once a week to see when he’s most fertile. I could prescribe that, to help you both pinpoint the moments the sex will be most effective. But I must warn you. This can put a strain on your love life.”
Professor Snape escorted us both to the castle, all the way to the hospital wing. He said something about giving us some privacy, that today was already hard enough for me. Madam Pomfrey followed us and checked us out at the hospital wing. Later I heard that I came second in the task, this because the Mer-people had explained to the Headmaster that I had arrived second at the statue but had been to upset to act when reunited with my hostage. Blaise told me that the Merpeople had been furious with headmaster Dumbledore. I asked Professor Snape if he knows why and he explained that the Mer-people had sensed what he had suspected, that Draco and I are connected in a way that is more than just love.
First I need to tell you about Hagrid. Hermione, Draco and I went to visit him last week, the day before everyone left for the Christmas holidays. When we got to his place that looked like an iced cake in the snowed up landscape, he first didn’t answer when we knocked on his door. We could hear noises inside, so I called out for him. When the door opened Hagrid stood there like a lost puppy. His eyes were red and swollen and tears splashed down the front of his leather vest. He flung himself onto me and I had to be saved by Draco and Hermione. Man, Hagrid is heavy! We helped Hagrid back into his cabin. He just kept crying and I was really worried. There was a letter on his table and Draco read it. He started to walk up and down the cabin and he kept shaking his head. He was really angry by the time he finished the letter and passed it on to Hermione, who read the letter out loud.
I’ve been thinking a lot about the package that Hagrid and headmaster Dumbledore are hiding in the castle. I’m sure by now that Snape is after it. When I was dragging myself back towards the dungeon one evening after dinner I passed Snape his office. The door was ajar and I could hear him talking to someone. I decided to listen in and to take a peek through the open door. Filch was with him and Snape was holding his robes above his knees, making it possible to see the bloody and mangled wound on one of his legs. And then he wondered out loud how he was supposed to keep his eyes on all three heads at once. So he had tried to get past the dog again. I told Hermione, Ron and Neville the next day. Hermione is convinced I’m wrong. In her eyes, teachers can do no wrong, but Ron thinks I have a point and Neville agrees too. He’s afraid of Snape, ever since his potions incident during the first week at Hogwarts.
I did see him again a couple of times in the maze. The first time was when he jumped out of a corridor where he had encountered Hagrid’s Blast-Ended-Skrewts. He said they were enormous. This was around the same time I was wondering what the deal was, as I hadn’t run into any obstacles yet. I just felt like someone was watching me all the time. It was creepy.
Hermione opens her mouth to say that the creatures don’t exist, but Ron stops her by placing his hand on her mouth. “That’s great, Luna. I hope you will spot one too,” he says. Then he throws a small piece of parchment at Draco to get him to look up from his essay. “What are your plans for Christmas?” Ron asks.
In the end, Slytherin won the match and Draco came to greet me with a sweaty kiss before heading to the showers. Daphne and Hermione wooed us and started laughing. Ron looked like he had just witnessed a murder being committed to the amusement of his brothers Fred and George (who are on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but didn’t seem all that upset with losing, their captain Wood, on the other hand, walked away with an angry scroll as soon as the game was finished because Terence had caught the Snitch). Come to think of it, that was our first kiss in front of others, I hadn’t realised until now. I wonder if Draco thought about that.
“She wasn’t kidnapped, Weasel,” Malfoy says from Harry’s other side. He sits next to Harry, their hands close to each other. Malfoy’s pinkie on top of Harry’s below the blanket that falls around them to keep them warm.
When I woke up again I was in the hospital wing and headmaster Dumbledore was sitting next to my bed. I freaked out a little and told him that Quirrell had the stone. But he told me to relax and that everything was fine. I looked around then and saw that the table next to me was piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. The headmaster said they were tokens from my friends and admirers since the entire school seems to know what happened in the dungeons, even though it’s a complete secret.
“He’s going to find out,” Neville says. “More and more people know that you’re gay. He’s going to overhear.”
Not that Neville never gets in trouble. But Lily doesn’t see that. She only sees that Harry gets hurt saving his brother over and over again.
He leaves the ring. He might not understand why he has it after tonight. He might take it off and never glance at it again. But it’s too much to vanish that too. The last evidence of his life with Draco.
"Just get on with it," Draco tells Harry. Harry lifts his head and looks at Draco. He's annoyed. Draco tries to find a reason why he should be worried about this, but he can’t.
Burke has the decency to look guilty. “Draco is the official patient. He has to be the one to agree with whatever we are going to do now.”
Draco closes his eyes and tries to catch some more sleep. The nausea doesn’t help and Draco wonders if maybe he should just get up and go live in the bathroom for now. The prospect doesn’t appeal to him, so he pulls the covers over his head and closes his eyes.
Draco made red sparks come from his wand while we were running. We didn’t stop until we were almost back at the spot where we had split up from the others and Hagrid was running towards us. I fell to my knees when I saw him and Draco kneeled down next to me. He asked me if I was alright because I was holding my free hand over my scar. The other one was still in Draco’s hand. I told him my scar hurt but that I was fine. That the pain was already going away.
Harry’s head spins. All the crazy gifts were tokens and Draco wants to marry him. His hand slides into his pocket and holds onto the little piece of fabric hidden inside. It comforts Harry as it has done for the last two months. He hardly listens to Ginny and Zabini’s conversation. He needs to tell Malfoy that he accepts, that he wants to see where this goes.
But the worsted of the night happened when Hermione and I left the party. We were halfway the hallway towards the stairs to the entrance hall when I heard that voice again. You remember, the one I heard when I had detention with Professor Lockhart. It said it was hungry and that it was time to kill. It was moving upwards and I ran after the sound, up the stairs, into the entrance hall, and then up to the first floor. Hermione followed me and it became clear quickly that she couldn’t hear the voice. I told her it was going to kill someone. It was saying it smelled blood and I was afraid I would be too late to stop it. I ran after it, turning corners until I arrived into a deserted passage. And there it was, written on the wall: The chamber of secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware. And Filch cat Mrs Norris was hanging underneath it, stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring. I wanted to help, but Hermione said we needed to get out of there.
But I never made it to Professor Snape’s quarters. When I came out of the Slytherin dungeon I found Ron and Neville looking around in the hallway. Ron came running up to me, saying they had been looking for me. They had overheard Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick talking about a student that had been taken to the Chamber of Secrets. That there had been a message on the wall saying ‘His skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.’ So they followed them all the way to the staff room and then overheard that Draco was the student that had been taken.
We didn’t sleep in on Christmas morning. Both too excited to give each other our Christmas presents. I had Daphne order some beautiful hair ties and elastic hair bands. We picked out some stuff from one of her beauty catalogues, so I would be able to make even prettier braids into Draco’s hair. Draco really loves them, by the way, and I love how they brighten up his hair. Draco got me some very soft sweaters and a magical set of pens that change colour while writing. I’m wearing one of my new sweaters now, I love how Draco can’t stop hugging me when I wear them.
Oh and it was fun to see Fred and George Weasley try to get passed the age line that headmaster Dumbledore had placed around the goblet. They’d taken ageing potion and stepped over the line, only to be hurled out of the circle. Once they were back on the floor they both sprouted identical long white beards. Everyone in the Hall was laughing, even Fred and George.
“Harry, if young Malfoy’s family is anything close to Sirius’ family, he’s been raised to believe that a man is only allowed to marry a woman,” Remus says. Harry sits up a little straighter so he can look at Remus. Remus his features are soft and he keeps steady eye contact with Harry.
Harry nods. He closes his potions book. He hasn’t written a single word for his essay in the last half hour. Snape will be happy when he can again take points from Gryffindor. Harry doesn’t care anymore.
Harry laughs out loud, and Draco chuckles without a sound. Harry sees a sparkle in Malfoy’s eyes and Harry’s stomach flips a little when he spots it. He closes his eyes briefly and shakes his head. He can’t get a proper crush on Malfoy. He’s supposed to help him, not scare him away. He focuses on the parchment between them and changes the subject.
Draco doesn’t answer. He stares at his hands again. Harry wants to pull him close and tell Draco that all will be alright.
Granger’s eyes widen and her mouth freezes before any sounds escape. The insult she planned to fling at Draco lost at the sight in front of her.
Professor Lupin took us to the staffroom where a Boggart was hiding in an old wardrobe. After a short explanation of what a Boggart is and how to fight it, we all had to take turns to face it. A Boggart is a shape-shifter, by the way, that turns into whatever frightens us the most. The professor started with Neville. He asked him what frightened him the most. Off course it surprised no-one that this was Professor Snape. Professor Lupin told Neville to imagine his grandmother's clothes when he would say the spell Riddikulus so that the Boggart Snape would be forced to wear them. He told us we would all get a turn and that we had to think of what frightened us the most and how we could make it comical. Draco moved all the way to the end of the classroom, shaking his head. I followed him, asked him what was wrong. He wouldn’t say, just said that he didn’t want to, that he didn’t know how to make it comical.
It turns out that Headmaster Dumbledore thinks that the disappearance of Bertha Jenkins and Mr Crouch are connected. Only the minister doesn’t see it that way. He thinks that Mr Crouch has finally cracked and lost his mind.
Ron turns and takes a handful of snow. Hermione tries to hide behind Draco, who makes sure he gets out of the way when the snowball flies towards them. Only Hermione believes he’s the perfect shield and it doesn’t take long before one of the snowballs lands on his chest. Draco looks at Ron with a gaping mouth and then looks at his chest where the snow colours his black coat grey. And then he ducks to the ground and makes the perfect snowball and aims it at Ron for revenge.
Harry runs through the train, passes by other students who yell at him to slow down. Harry doesn’t listen. Draco is on the other side, making his way towards him. Harry can’t get to him quick enough.
Harry doesn’t respond. He stares at the ceiling of his four-poster and wonders if he’ll ever get back to being his normal self. He wants to be that popular kid again, who chats with everyone and loves being in the centre of attention. He hates the person he’s becoming. This quiet boy who hates the world. Hermione is right. He’s been a prat. Only Harry doesn’t know how to change that. He has no idea how to forget about Draco and the pain in his heart so he can get back to being the person he was before he fell in love.
A car stops next to him. Draco shakes his head. He doesn’t want to talk to some Muggle who wants to be noble. But it’s a familiar voice that says his name. A gentle hand rest on his back and Draco looks up at the friendly smile of Luna Lovegood.
Harry and Neville both laugh and then place their hands flat on their desks. Remus shakes his head with a smile on his face. He must know that Neville and Harry won’t be stupid enough to try and communicate with signs on their DADA exam, with their uncle who signs supervising. They did get away with it during the History of Magic exam. Hermione was outraged when she spotted them and told them off afterwards. Even threatened to tell Professor Binns, until she realised the man wouldn’t care either way. And at least this way, Harry won’t have a failing grade on the most boring subject ever.
We ended up in a tunnel. Hermione wondered where it would go and I told her it probably goes to Hogsmeade. We moved as fast as we could and the tunnel looked like it went on forever. Until it finally started to rise and we ran into a disordered dusty room with our wands raised. All the furniture in the room was broken and the windows were all boarded up. Ron and the dog weren’t in the room, but a door to our right stood open and led us into a shadowy hallway.
“All Harry, I promise you. I told him he shouldn’t spoil the boy, but does that man ever listen to me?”
‘Not unless you have a Time-Turner lying around,’ Malfoy writes. ‘Still doesn’t mean I want your help.’
“Three, two, one, Happy New Year!” the room shouts. Draco turns his head and kisses Harry. They share an intimate moment in which they wish each other a happy new year before Hermione pulls Harry away from Draco. Draco turns and is just in time to catch Pansy when she jumps and hugs him with her entire body.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says. He doesn’t know what else to say. He knows Harry is right, that they can’t expect the entire world to put their life on hold just because theirs is.
I was halfway down the steps towards the basement when Professor Snape came out of his office and told me to get in there at once. I did what I was told, glad I left the cloak at the end of the passageway, just behind the stone witch. I’ll have to go back for it later, but at least I didn’t have any evidence of my escape on me. Snape told me he just had a visit from Parkinson and Nott, claiming they saw me at the Shrieking Shack this afternoon. Well, my head floating in mid-air. I tried to make a joke out of it, said that maybe Parkinson and Nott need to go see Madam Pomfrey. Only Professor Snape wasn’t fooled. He told me that my head wasn’t allowed to be in Hogsmeade, just like the rest of my body. And that if my head was in Hogsmeade, which was very likely since Malfoy was seen at the crime as well, the rest of me was also in Hogsmeade.
Neville and Harry both laugh as Ron looks affronted. It’s not easy for Ron, Harry knows this. His best friend wants to have a father with an exciting job, just as Harry and Neville’s dad. It’s not his fault his father just loves Muggle artefacts more than he loves fighting criminals.
Marcus was beside himself when he heard I had gotten a Firebolt for Christmas, but that Professor Snape had confiscated it to make sure it is safe. I think he went to see Professor Snape to explain to him how important it was that I would have the broom back before or next match against Ravenclaw.
“Oh no, he isn’t,” Neville spits out. He slams his fist on the map, making Draco jump from the sudden movement.
Harry looks up. His eyes widen and he opens his mouth to come up with something. But his mind is blank. He messed up big time. Nobody is supposed to know. It might cost Remus his job if others find out.
“Nothing, mum is just being difficult,” Harry says. He shrugs and shows Draco around the house. Draco doesn’t seem to mind that he gets his own room and Harry wonders if maybe Draco knows that Harry wants more from him than just being friends.
Hermione has been reading a lot the last two weeks. She feels stupid that she didn’t bring her copy of Hogwarts, A History, because all the copies of the library had been taken out by other students. She wants to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets. She even asked about it in our History of Magic class last Wednesday. It was a nice distraction during the boring class. Professor Binns just talks in his flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class is in a deep stupor. It was my favourite class at the end of last year because it was the one where Draco would play with my hand all class. And now the only thing I can do is daydream about how amazing that felt and how much I want it back. But he’s sitting with Pansy now. I think they are dating. That’s what everyone has been saying at least.
Malfoy nods his head and then turns back to his homework. Harry shoves his Potions book into his backpack and hurries out of the library with a smile on his face. Malfoy has finally accepted Harry’s help. Harry wonders what Hermione and Neville will say now. They thought it was a hopeless case. How wrong were they? It’s all going to work out. Malfoy and Harry will become friends, and it’s going to be amazing. Harry is sure of it.
Hermione had been waiting for us outside the staffroom. She wanted to make sure we were okay before she went off to the library to do her homework. Her schedule is a mystery to me, she has so many classes a day, I don’t know how she does it. Somehow she goes to Divination but also talks about her lessons of Arithmancy, which is weird because those classes are at the same time. She has no free periods at all because she somehow is following all subjects. I already find it hard with the two extra classes and the massive amounts of homework we have. Oh and even now that Ron and she aren’t a couple they still fight like one. Daphne let slip that they both yelled at each other at lunch after our first Divination lesson. She asked Dean about it and he said they were fighting about divination and if it was real or not. I don’t think they had a normal conversation since.
I will keep you informed about what’s happening with the stone and with Malfoy, but now I really need to get ready for bed.
Draco stands in front of the Coco Pops. He reaches for a pack and places it in his cart. He’s in joggers and a simple t-shirt. His hair is pulled back in a messy ponytail. And when he looks away from his cart and spots Harry he freezes.
Draco looks at his watch. Only to discover that just one minute has passed since the last time he checked. Draco closes his eyes and tries to block out the sounds around him. The whispers of two men, the rustle of a paper and most of all, the sounds of the little toddler and the baby crying at the other side of the waiting room. Harry’s arm around Draco’s shoulders helps. It keeps him grounded, stops Draco from running away, back home, where nobody will tell him what a failure he is.
Harry looks behind him. What is keeping Hermione and Ron? How difficult is it to get back to their trunks and get some parchment?
Harry places the note on top of the wizard BSL book and slides them towards Malfoy. Malfoy looks at the book and the note but doesn’t read it yet. He points a finger to his parchment and Harry nods his understanding. Malfoy smiles and then continues his work. Harry opens his bag and takes out some of his homework and sets to work. Time ticks by and they work in silence. When Malfoy is done with his essay, he puts his quill down and picks up Harry’s note. He doesn’t answer. He takes the book in his hands and studies the front. Then he opens it and leaves through it. His face doesn’t show what he thinks about it. Harry hopes it’s not bad. Malfoy loves books. Sure he will love a book about something he wants to learn. He will probably learn BSL quicker by reading that book than with what Harry can show him.
And you will never believe what I found under my sheets. Neatly folded with a note on it saying: just in case. It was my invisibility cloak. I was so happy to have it back. That and the fact that Draco is talking to me again make everything just a little easier. We are still scared about Voldemort coming back and I’m still going crazy from all the studying, but Draco is helping me again. He also noticed that Nott was hitting me again and he now makes sure I’m never alone in the dormitory. We study together almost all the time. Hermione said she misses me, so I told Draco I’ll have to go study with her tomorrow. But for now, we are just hanging on Draco’s bed trying to remember the names of Jupiter’s moon and all the other stuff we need to know for our exams. They will start in two weeks, so I probably won’t write again until after.
Harry stares at Draco. At his soft smile. His grey eyes and blond hair. He’s so beautiful. And so strong and brave for facing all his struggles alone for so long. Harry never wants Draco to be alone again.
Neville and Harry laugh. Harry leans his head on Hermione’s shoulder. “He’s better when he’s asleep,” he tells her.
“Shut up Myrtle, and let us have our moment,” Harry says. He steps away from Draco and picks up his broom. “I’ll see you on the field,” he says before he exits the bathroom. Draco stares at the door for a couple of seconds before he grabs his Quidditch robes and pulls them on. He straightens his hair again and waves at Myrtle before he leaves the bathroom and hurries down the back stairs so he can sneak back to the dungeons, get his broom and run up the stairs making it look like he’s just come from the Slytherin dormitories.
“And I’m not saying that Draco has feelings for you,” Remus continues. “But if he has, he might be frightened of them. You told me his father is already angry because it came out he’s deaf. I’m sure his father won’t take it lightly if being gay piles up on that.”
When they were done snapping at each other, Hermione started flicking through the book and then told us that Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone. I had no idea what that mend and I was glad that Ron and Neville also looked confused. She then explained it to us by reading the book. The Sorcerer’s Stone can transform any metal into pure gold and it produces the elixir of life, which will make you immortal. It also said that the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Flamel, who’s already six hundred and sixty-five years old! Can you believe that? Over six hundred years old, that must be weird, all your friends will have long died and you’ll be all alone, or you need to make new friends like every eighty years or so. I don’t think I would like that. It was already hard enough to get the friends I have now, and I also don’t like the idea of losing them. I don’t want to be lonely again.
“Okay,” Draco answers. He’ll go to a healer. He will let them do tests, let them find out that it’s all Draco’s fault. That the mark he still carries on his arm is to blame for everything. And then he’ll watch how Harry will slowly distant himself, how he will leave and find a man that can make his biggest desire come true.
Ron also has a younger sister, named Ginny. She seems to have a crush on me. Every time she sees me she turns red turns around and walks out of the room. Or she knocks things over whenever I enter a room. It’s kind of cute. Ron said she had been talking about me all summer. Fred is surprised she hasn’t asked for my autograph jet.
A huge smile forms on Harry’s face. “I can see,” Harry signs back. His heart hammers in his chest and he’s glad he doesn’t have to speak. “You stopped him,” Harry signs.
“No, just the usual,” Neville says when he sits down next to Harry and takes out his sketchbook to draw some more plants in it.
“Ew, gross,” Teddy says. He struggles to get out of Harry’s lap and then walks towards the door. “I’m opening my presents,” he tells them.
“I know, alright. I’m an idiot too,” Draco says. “Now hold your promise and don’t open that can of worms again.”
‘But Flint worships you now,’ Draco writes. ‘They would never have won. Zabini is a horrible Seeker.’
I’m not really good at charms. I did manage to finally make my feather fly with the levitation charm. I got it before Malfoy and that was a fun victory. We’ve also been working on the wand-lighting charm and the Lumos Solem. I haven’t managed to make them work, but Hermione promised me she would help me practice them one of these days.
The man looked up at Draco. His cheeks were hollow like he hadn’t eaten in days. His lips were cracked and dry and his eyes were bloodshot from tears shat.
The weather gets warmer by the day. Exams are sneaking closer. Not that Harry studies for them. He and Neville are occupied with other matters. Every afternoon after class, they go outside and walk around the castle. Together with Ron, they researched the spells needed to detect and trap rats. And now they go out every afternoon to check their traps and place new ones, in the hope they will catch Pettigrew.
And then Harry is back, his arms around Draco’s waist. “Let’s go outside and watch the fireworks,” he says. Draco agrees and follows him outside. Seamus is already setting up his show for the night. It’s a good thing that Hermione and Ronald’s cottage is so remote. No Muggle would believe that the fireworks Seamus comes up with could be bought in a regular store.
Neville and Hermione laugh. It’s no secret that if it’s up to Ron, breakfast will never be finished. It will just extend to lunch, and then into dinner until he falls asleep to wake up at the breakfast table.
Harry’s mind races. He doesn’t understand. How did he make things worse? He only tried to help Malfoy. Isn’t it better now that the teachers understand why he can’t answer them?
Snape made all of us stop with a simple Finite Incantatem and I could see Ron apologise to Neville for whatever his broken wand had done. Hermione and Millicent looked like they were fine. Only Draco looked worried at Nott like he was afraid Nott had read more in him working with me that there was. And this was the moment that Professor Lockhart decided that it was time for a volunteer pair to teach us all a blocking spell. And of course, Professor Snape volunteered Draco and I. Professor Lockhart showed me some complicated sort of wiggling action before he dropped his wand, expecting me to now know what to do. Meanwhile, Draco was almost fighting with Professor Snape, and when the professor told him he should, Draco just ran out of the Great Hall. I think he was crying and I wanted to follow him, but Professor Snape had already found a replacement for Draco and now I was facing Theo Nott.
Another thing I’ve been talking about with Miss Davis is Draco. I think he’s my boyfriend now. We never really said it out loud, but he’s always holding my hand and smiling at me. He makes me feel good about myself, stronger. But it still hurts what he did to me, ignoring me for so long. I know he had good reasons and that he didn’t want to hurt me, but he did. Miss Davis said it might be a good thing to tell him, to talk about it, but I don’t really want to. I don’t want to push him away or make him think I don’t like him.
“I don’t think it’s supposed to be funny,” Hermione says. “It looks more like an apology or something.”
“Boomerang,” Zabini answers without protest. “Down the stairs, second door on the left. Don’t knock, he won’t let you in if he knows it’s you.”
And then I told him I had heard him a few weeks ago, sobbing, and that I thought that Snape was threatening him. That made a spasm of fear flitter across Quirrell’s face. He said that he sometimes finds it hard to follow his master’s instructions. I stuttered my next question, asking if Voldemort was there in the classroom with him. The thought scared me.
“It’s okay, Draco. We don’t both need to die today,” Harry says. Draco shakes his head and tightens his grip on Potter’s arm. He won’t let go. He can’t let go. It will be the end of everything.
Hermione is reading all the extra books we need to read too. She finds the bond fascinating. It’s very rare and she wants to know all about it. I asked her if she could maybe write a summary of it all, so I don’t need to read it. But I’m sure you know by now that Hermione won’t do something like that, so I have no other choice but to read the material. The only problem is that they are old books, written by dull people, so I struggle to get through it. Draco sometimes tells me to skip chapters because they are useless.
Draco stares at her. She said ‘kill them too’. Does that mean that it’s over? That all hope is truly lost?
After some time, Harry walks back into the room. He doesn’t say a word when he grabs a duffel bag and starts to push some of his clothes inside it. Draco can hear him sniff and he knows Harry’s cried. Draco doesn’t want Harry to leave. He wants him to stay. Draco loves him and will give him whatever he wants, if only he could. But now he needs to let him go, give him the freedom he deserves. Harry should be happy, not locked in a fruitless marriage that will only destroy him.
One of the girls that were also sorted into our house stated that I was only a half-blood and therefore not a real Slytherin. It was then that a ghost sat down next to Malfoy. The boy didn’t seem to like it and it made me smile a little. Malfoy saw that and he kicked me under the table. The ghost is the bloody baron. He’s our house ghost. He said it was a good thing I was in Slytherin, that with the famous Harry Potter it was a given that we would win the house cup for the next seven years. Everyone around me started laughing and Malfoy stated that it was more likely that I would make them lose the cup because I wasn’t made to be a Slytherin.
Harry nods, forgetting that Ron can't see him. He wants to believe Ron, wants him to be right. But the empty look on Draco's face, his pale complexion, and the way he's distancing himself from everyone, even Harry. It's so similar to sixth year, the year Draco started to abuse potions, it scares Harry.
Ron nods and then his eyes scan the table around them. “I think Hermione already knows,” he says. “Ever since Professor Snape made us write that essay on werewolves.”
I should tell you all that has been going on since my trip to Diagon Alley. First off, Ron did get over the fact that I'm bent. He said he was sorry, he just felt like a fool for not noticing and trying to fix me up with his little sister. He told him it was okay and that I was also sorry for never telling him. After that my new broom got delivered and we spent the rest of the day taking turns flying it. Fred and George joined us after a while and it was a lot of fun. We almost flew every day after that. It were two nice last weeks of the holiday. But we were also looking forward to going on the train and hang out with Hermione, Neville and Blaise. And with Draco, if he would at least talk to me. That was a stupid dream of me. I don’t know why I thought everything would be better when we would get back to school and his dad wouldn’t be around to stop him.
“I wouldn’t know, Mrs Prince,” Harry tells her. Even though he also doesn’t like Malfoy’s father all that much. He’s the reason why Malfoy doesn’t want anyone else to know he’s deaf. And that is just plain wrong. But he won’t say that out loud. It will only upset Malfoy. And that is the last thing Harry wants.
This is the last part of year four. I'll be taking a short break from this story to read book 5 and work on some other fanfics and my original novel, so it might be some time before this story gets continued. But I do promise I'll get back to it once I've figured out where I want to take the story next.
“I know I’m not. It’s not necessary for you to tell me again that this is all just a fluke, that you can’t get distracted by this, no matter how much you love me. It already hurts enough that you still treat me like dirt when others are around, I don’t need you to hurt me now.” Harry stops in front of a window and looks out over the grounds of Hogwarts. Sometimes he wonders what would have happened if Voldemort had never excised. What it would have been like to grow up with the love of his parents. Would he have rejected Slytherin then? Maybe he could have found out much sooner what an amazing person Draco is and that he’s worth fighting for no matter what. Not that Draco feels the same. Harry knows this. And no matter how much it hurts, it won’t stop him from coming back here and share these fleeting moments.
Harry looks at Draco who’s turned back to his homework. He never minds that he can’t follow any of them. He loves the silence. Harry has learnt that by now. But still, it would be great if all their friends would be able to communicate with him without the need for translators or pieces of parchment. But that doesn’t change anything to the fact that Draco will be all alone this Christmas. Harry doesn’t think any Slytherin ever stays over at Hogwarts during Christmas. It will be so depressing. Harry can’t stand it. He has to make sure that Draco has a good Christmas, one he will enjoy.
Harry looks at the piece of fabric that has fallen from the envelope. It’s just a piece of fabric. Harry looks into the envelope again. There is nothing else in there. No explanation or even a note of who it’s from.
So Draco hasn’t said a word about what happened up in the sky, or about the promises before the match even started.
We didn’t waste any time with showers that morning, or hair braiding, or breakfast. We pulled on the first clothes we could find and started to make our way out of the castle. Only to get stopped by Professor Snape. He took one look at the Firebolt and demanded to know where we had gotten it. We told him it was sent to me for Christmas. Snape took the Firebolt from me and examined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. He wanted to know from who it was and when we couldn’t tell him because there had been no card or message with it, Professor Snape decided to confiscate it so it could be checked for jinxes. He said something about Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick stripping it down and I think my heart stopped right there. Draco uttered something and Snape just said it was necessary and that it would only take a couple of weeks. He was sure I would have the broom back in time for the next Quidditch match. And with that, he walked away with my beautiful new broom.
The days after Halloween, everyone in the castle talked about Sirius Black. The theories about how he made it inside became crazier by the day. Hannah Abbott from Hufflepuff is convinced that Black can turn into a flowering shrub. It’s kind of funny how sure she is of herself. Hermione is just annoyed by it all. She says that having Sir Cadogan as the guardian of their door is driving everyone insane. I’m glad we just have a piece of wall and no crazy portrait guarding our dormitories.
Draco pulls Harry closer towards him and then lays his chin on Harry’s shoulder. “Thank you,” he says.
Later that night, Draco told me why Neville had been so upset and why Moody had mentioned Draco’s aunt. His mother’s oldest sister is in Azkaban for torturing Neville his parents, and her favourite curse to use was the Cruciatus. Draco isn’t sure what happened to Neville’s parents, but we all know that he’s being raised by his grandmother, so it can’t be anything good. Draco told me that his aunt Bella and uncle Rodolphus were loyal followers of the Dark Lord. That they still are if he has to believe the stories his father told him when he was younger.
“Fine, I won’t say another word,” Hermione says. She stands up and drops the newspaper on Harry’s books. “You’re such a prat ever since Draco dumped your arse.”
“How is this good news?” Harry asks. “We’ve had all these tests just to get told to keep trying. We’ve been trying for months.”
I hate Malfoy. I really hate him. I never believed I would meet someone I would hate more than Dudley, but I was so wrong. He tries to sit next to me in every class and keeps hitting my right arm when he makes notes. He says it’s the only way he can write properly and that I should stay out of his way, but how am I supposed to do that? He keeps pushing me to the left side of the tables and taking the seat next to me so our arms keep bumping into each other.
In the meantime, Pettigrew talks to Neville. He says that betraying Neville’s parents was an easy choice. That they were of no concern to him.
Harry and Neville grin at Ron and a plan starts to form. Together they go over the different spells and traps they can set for Pettigrew. They will find the idiot before the exams start. And then they will be the heroes of the school. And everyone will forget about Harry being gay and his misfortune with Draco. Everything will get back to normal once they capture Pettigrew.
"The potions, please, Draco, did you take them?" Harry’s voice cracks, and he knows he has tears in his eyes by now. He should have seen this coming. He should have dragged Draco to get help, should have listened to Blaise and let them help him. He should have made sure Draco didn’t feel like he had to fall back into oblivion again. Hermione was right that it was wrong to ignore it, to just let it happen, to let it destroy both of them in the process.
Hope. It’s a strange concept. Draco sits at a table, surrounded by Death Eaters. The Dark Lord sits beside him. And he’s just been told that he and his mother will both die at the start of the coming summer. Draco will die by Dumbledore’s hand. Harry always spoke highly of Dumbledore. Said that he was a good man. Will Dumbledore be willing to listen to Draco? Could he be the help Draco needs? He is powerful enough to save both Draco and his mother. Harry trusted him. When he finds out that Draco and Harry were in love, he won’t let Draco down. Dumbledore is the hope Harry mentioned.
There is also another mystery I’m trying to solve, and that is the mystery of Hermione disappearing in thin air. She thinks we didn’t notice that we were all walking to Charms together and that Draco and I were to only once to arrive. We did cheering charms by the way, which is really fun. But the crazy thing is, that Hermione was there one minute and gone the next.
The next thing I remember is holding the Sorting Hat, while the Basilisk was coming after me. I pulled the hat on my head and just thought ‘help me’. There was no voice but the hat contracted and something very hard and heavy thudded onto my head. It almost knocked me out. It was a gleaming silver sword and I took it out and used it when the Basilisk lunged for me. The hilt drove into the roof of the Basilisks mouth, making it keeled over sideways, twitching to the floor. I slid down the wall, my arm hurt so badly and when I looked I could see one of the poisonous fangs of the Basilisk sticking out of it. I crawled toward Draco. I was going to die, I knew it. A white-hot pain was spreading slowly from the wound and my vision started to become foggy. It was a lot like when I had slit my wrist and the world had started spinning while the blood pulsed out of my arm.
On Christmas morning I slept in a little, and that was a big mistake. Someone had stepped on all my Christmas presents. So the tin of treacle toffee Hagrid had sent me was ruined, just like the luxury eagle-feather quill I had gotten from Hermione. The Dursleys had gotten me a toothpick and a note telling me to find out If I would be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation. And like I said before, Mrs Weasley had sent me another green sweater, this one in a different shade of green. Draco would probably know what kind of shade it is because it’s not the Slytherin emerald.
Draco smiles at Harry and kisses him on the nose. Harry laughs and takes Draco’s face in his hands to give Draco a proper kiss. When they part again, the firework show has started, and they both look at the fantastic animals Seamus has created in the sky. The entire party has gathered outside, and Draco tells Harry they should go for a walk once the show is over. Harry nods his head in approval without taking his eyes from the sky. Draco struggles to stay focused on the display of fireworks. He loves to watch Harry while he stares at the light-up sky. The pure joy so clearly on his face while he rests his head against Draco’s chest.
“There is something I wanted to tell you,” Harry says. He looks to the other side of the hospital wing. He’s the only one here, nobody will overhear. And his dad isn’t going to mind. His two best friends are gay. Sure he can’t have an issue with his son being bent.
“Hermione, you are brilliant,” Harry tells her. He leans over Ron and gives Hermione a peck on her cheek.
The bell rings and all the other students put their quills down. Remus waves his wand and the exams fly to the front of the room. The silence is replaced by a thundering noise as students get up and start to talk about the exam. Neville and Hermione step up to Harry and together they find Ron at the back of the class.
And then everything got even more messed up. Lupin asked Black where someone was. Black pointed at Ron. Lupin made no sense at all. He said something like ‘why hasn’t he shown himself before now? Unless he was the one, unless you switched without telling me.” Black nodded and then Lupin lowered his wand, walked to Black, helped him up and then kissed him. And not a small peck or anything, no it was a full-blown kiss, with hands disappearing in each other's hairs and tongues and everything.
But back to the point. I asked Professor Lupin if he could help me with the Dementors. I remember that Draco told me that Professor Lupin made the Dementor on the train go away. The professor promised he’ll try to teach me some defences next term. He’s really busy right now. He’s been ill and has a lot of work to catch up to.
We had a great time with our friends on the train. At one point Hermione let Crookshanks out of his cage and Luna fell in love with the cat. Not long after that, Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean came by. Crookshanks jumped at Ron’s pocket straight away, somehow knowing that is where he keeps Scrabbers, his rat. Ron was all upset and the Gryffindor boys left soon after that.
We had lessons all day and I couldn’t wait for it to be over so we could go check on Hagrid. We knocked on his door and a window for over ten minutes, only Hagrid wouldn’t open the door. I know he was there, we could hear Fang’s barks, but he wouldn’t open for us. Hagrid didn’t show himself for the entire week and on Saturday, Draco and I were back at his door, begging him to open up. We screamed that we didn’t care. But it was all for nothing.
He does the same with the blanket on the couch, the vase on the window still with dead flowers. Maybe Harry should have just thrown away the flowers and kept the vase. It was a present from Hermione when she and Ron moved out, something to remember them by. Draco always made sure it wasn’t empty from the first day he’d set foot in this house.
“You are powerful,” the Dark Lord says. “And smart.” Without another word he turns and sits back down. “Now, let us start dinner.”
“You killed the boy,” the Dark Lord says. “Unintentional.” He laughs. Draco shivers from the sound. “Isn’t that poetic. I’ve tried for years, and always failed. But you, you didn’t plan to, didn’t even want to, and you succeeded.”
Malfoy laughs. He shakes his head. ‘I won’t help you. You made everything worse. Just leave me alone.’
Harry reaches for Draco again and their lips slam against each other. The food in the picnic basket gets forgotten as the kiss deepens. Draco loves Harry and Harry loves him. The world is perfect. Pettigrew might have got away. Is probably on his way to the Dark Lord if Trelawney’s prediction is correct. But they are all still alive. Draco saved Harry. And they’re in love. Nothing could be better.
“Yes, that is perfect,” Hermione says. “Then you have to pay attention in class for once, instead of trying to steal my notes all the time.”
“Sometimes that is where it starts, Harry,” James says. “I had to be friends with your mum first too. She hated me a little at first, but by showing her who I truly was by being her friend, she came to love me. Maybe it will be the same for you.”
I still have bad days, where everything just seems to be too much. Draco gives me the strength to face those days and without him here, well some days I don’t leave my room at all. The Dursleys don’t care, they are happy to see as little as possible of me. Miss Davis has given me some exercises to do this summer that will help me fight the negative thoughts. She says they are Muggle techniques, so they don’t acquire me to use magic. I have to write down all my negative thoughts I have in a notebook she has given to me and then write behind them why they are not true and what I can think about instead to make it better. And I also have to write down when something good happens, so I can remember all the good things in my life when I’m having a bad day. I haven’t written down a lot of things yet since I’ve been mostly just been alone here. Writing down the negative thoughts is easier until I have to figure out why they aren’t true and what I should think instead. But I’m trying and that is all Miss Davis asked of me.
It’s enough for the Dementor to slide away. Some warmth sweeps back into Harry’s body and he lets out a deep breath. A bar of chocolate is pushed into his hand and Harry smiles up at his uncle.
“And what if they don’t? What if it’s just bad luck?” Draco doesn’t know if he can handle that. Or maybe it’s even worse. Perhaps they will tell them that it truly is his fault and that there is no solution. That will make Harry leave him for sure. Once Harry finds out that Draco can never give him the family he wants so badly, it will all be over.
Off course I got a lot of other presents. Hermione gave me a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland (which Draco is reading right now), Sirius got me a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot, Hagrid had sent me a box of all my favourite sweets. Ron and his mother had gotten me a sweater, a green one with a dragon on it. Draco also received a sweater from Ron’s mother with a little note that said he would always have a home at the Weasley’s if he ever needed one. But the best present was from Draco. When all the others had left the dormitory he gave me a small box that contained a ring which beard the Malfoy crest. He said he wanted me to have it since I was his family now. As you might understand, that ring hasn’t left my hand ever since I put it on. Daphne joked it looked like we were married already, but that she still expects to organise an elaborate wedding party for us one day.
If there was only a way to stop hurting. A way to stop the thoughts in his head to spin, to prevent them from breaking him apart. If only he could forget again.
Draco asked him if he knew why my scar hurts and he wasn’t happy with the answer. Dumbledore said he had a theory and no more than that. He thinks it’s because of the failed Killing Curse from when I was a baby. Because of my scar, I feel pain when Voldemort is near and when he feels a strong surge of hatred. Draco hates this, he doesn’t want me to be connected to the Dark Lord in any way. He says that one soul biding connection is enough for a person. I told him it’s not the same as our connection. I don’t feel Voldemort all the time, as I feel Draco. This calmed Draco down a little, but he is still upset about it all.
Draco forces a smile on his face and steps into the room. He looks at the little girl in Hermione’s arms. “She’s beautiful,” he tells Hermione.
James ruffles Harry’s hair. “Thanks for telling me, kiddo,” he says. “And now, who was that boy that ran out of here the moment I showed up?”
"Maybe we should stop with the tests, " Harry says after some time. Draco doesn’t want to hear this. He doesn’t want to know that Harry is giving up.
“I’m sure he’ll be there,” James says. He doesn’t need to be told why Harry’s mood changed and Harry loves him for it. “The Malfoys have made sure they have tickets for a private box,” James says.
Neville is a big fan of Herbology. He loves plants and I like partnering with him for this class. He knows a lot about the subject. We’ve been working with Wormwood, Mandrake Root and Dittany. We’ve also had theory lessons about the severing charm. I’m not sure what I think of it, I don’t think I have the green fingers necessary for this subject.
At that moment Malfoy stirs. He blinks with his eyes and then sits up a little straighter. He looks at Harry and then towards Remus. Harry smiles at him, in the hope Malfoy understands that everything is okay. Remus fishes another bar of chocolate from his pocket and hands it to Malfoy.
Andromeda holds up her hand and stops him. “It’s okay, Harry. You two need to take care of each other right now, and once you’re both up to it, you can start taking care of Teddy again. I’ve managed for three years before you two started to help out more than the occasional day. I think I’ll survive an extra weekend with Teddy.”
The Auror’s eyes flash around the room, and his lip trembles a little. Harry points his wand at the man and Draco closes his eyes. He doesn’t need to see what Harry will do to defend Draco’s honour.
Hermione had calmed down a little by then and she was able to tell what had upset her so much. It seems that last night she and Ron had a fight. Ron doesn’t want her to be friends with me anymore. And when Hermione told him no, he broke up with her. I know they had also already been fighting on Wednesday, after class. Ron had said something bad about Slytherin and Hermione had defended me. But they love each other, so I had thought they would be okay. Clearly, I was wrong. Hermione is really sad about it all, but she said she had promised me that we would stick together in this place and she was not going to break that promise. I told her she didn’t have to, that I would be fine, but she wouldn’t hear it. I was her best friend and she knew I hadn’t done it, so there was no reason to stay away from me. And if Ron wanted to be a stubborn ass-hole (yes Hermione really used the word ass-hole, I couldn’t believe my ears) than she was better off without him. I’m really glad she said that, because I wouldn’t know what to do without her.
A sniffle is heard from the other side of the clearing with tables. Harry looks up and spots Pettigrew giggling. His two large front teeth stand out of his mouth a little. His face looks more like a rat than shown in the pictures. He holds his hands in front of him, the fingers bend as if he’s still a rat. But he doesn’t have a wand. He won’t be able to curse Harry. Unless Pettigrew has learned wandless magic in the last twelve years.
And now it’s time for Harry to just agree so he utters an okay. He gets it. He wants to find Pettigrew too and hurt him for all he’s done to this family. “We’ll do it together,” he says.
“You can, you’re much stronger than me,” Harry says. Draco doesn’t understand where Harry’s confidence comes from. Doesn’t he know that Draco is a coward? That if it wasn’t for his friendship with Harry, Draco would never even thought about going against his father, against his family, against the Dark Lord.
Draco swallows. He needs to show the Dark Lord something. It won’t be the truth. Draco will never share that true memory with the man. Those words were only for Draco. Words that were overdue and heartbreaking. And it wasn’t as if Draco didn’t know. It had been clear for weeks, months even, that Harry felt that way. And no matter how much it hurts, Draco is glad that he’d heard them come from Harry’s lips.
Ron had been there when they arrested him. He had looked at Harry as if he was a stranger. And maybe he is that now. A stranger. A killer and murderer. He’s no longer the boy Ron became friends with. He hasn’t been that boy for years. Just like he hasn’t been Ron’s friend since he made his choice and ran with the only one that mattered.
After that headmaster Dumbledore awarded Ron and I both Special Awards for Services to the School and he gave out points for the house cup. Neville got 100 points for finding help, Ron got 150 points for facing danger to save a friend and he gave me 200 points for bravery and courage to face the Basilisk to save the boy I love. Professor McGonagall escorted Ron and Neville back to their own common room and Professor Snape took Professor Lockhart to the hospital wing, leaving me alone with the headmaster. He first thanked me for showing real loyalty to him and then he told me something disturbing. The only reason why I can speak Parseltongue is because Lord Voldemort can, as a last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin. Headmaster Dumbledore thinks that Voldemort has transferred some of his own powers into me the night he killed you. I don’t know what to think of that. It scares me. I wondered if I was only Slytherin because of that part in Voldemort inside me since you both had been Gryffindors. Headmaster Dumbledore assured me that the hat would see more than just the little part of Voldemort that is inside me and that I myself had qualities that Salazar himself valued in his students, like my determination and cleverness. He also said that I cherish the once I love abidingly and unconditionally and that that was very Slytherin of me. And then he continued that I could have also been in Gryffindor because I also have a lot of traits that are part of that house, like my bravery (even though I don’t feel brave most of the time) and my heroic actions last year and now. And the fact that I had pulled Gryffindor’s sword out of the head should tell me that house placements aren’t as black and white as we would like to pretend. And that I shouldn’t worry about the small part of Voldemort inside me because that was not what made me the person that I am or determent my placement in Slytherin.
Remus stares at Harry and then puts his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Then why don’t you prove to Sirius and James that they are wrong and that this Malfoy is different,” he says. His hand moves from the shoulder to pet Harry’s hair. Remus shakes his head a little and gives Harry a soft smile. “And now you need to get back inside, and I need to go see a man about dinner.”
“What’s up with you this morning. First, the staring at the door and now you stand there like the world is ending any minute now. Please don’t tell me if it is, I would like to stay ignorant to the very end,” Malfoy jokes.
Draco’s father claimed he didn’t know how his son had gotten a hold on it. And then I accused him of leaving it in Draco’s room, knowing Draco would use it since he had forbidden him to communicate with anyone outside of the family. Draco’s father's white hands clenched and unclenched and he hissed: ‘prove it’. Draco’s hand then slit back into mine and he asked his father in a broken voice if he had done this to him, to his own son. Professor Snape got up from his chair, ready to step in if needed, but Draco’s father just said in a cold voice that Draco was no son of him and then turned around and kicked Dobby out of the room. I turned to Draco and tears were streaming down his face, but he looked determent. He asked Professor Snape if he could give the diary back to his father. Professor Snape seemed confused, but agreed and told us we could go back to our friends. Draco ran out of the office, pulled off his shoe and his somehow always clean white sock and stuffed the diary into it. He pulled his shoe back on and ran down the dark corridor towards the sounds of Dobby’s squeals of pain.
“Hermione,” Harry warns her. “Let it be.” But of course, Hermione doesn’t listen. Doesn’t she understand that there are things they don’t want to talk about? That she doesn’t have the right to know everything?
Harry’s eyes are still on Draco. They have been staring at each other, sharing a pain that won’t leave them alone.
“Yeah, well not everyone falls pregnant on their first try,” Draco answers. “I’m sure you will hear it when we’re expecting again.”
I had a very long conversation with Sirius on the Saturday after he was cleared. Most of the school was off to Hogsmeade, but Draco, Hermione and I stayed at the castle. We first chilled by the lake, even taking a dip to cool off. Hermione complained it was no fun since Draco and I ended up kissing each other. Hagrid walked by and we tried to comfort him. I had all forgotten about Buckbeak and how he was sentenced to death. Hagrid said it was hard, knowing he was gone, but that the execution had been quick and painless.
Harry’s eyes fly open. Pettigrew stands bend over. His wand free hand clutching his stomach. Draco rolls over the floor. His eyes search and then he reaches out for Harry’s wand. Pettigrew lifts his wand. A red light flashes from it. It goes straight for Harry. He should duck. Get out of the blast zone. Only Harry is frozen. He lifts his hands to stop the spell.
The line stays quiet. Harry stares at his feet in front of him. His vision blurs as tears start to flow. “I don’t want to lose him,” Harry says. And he will if he forces Draco to get help. Draco will shut him out entirely, and then all hope is gone. He’ll start using again, and Harry will find him dead in their bed one day.
“But there are ways? For him to learn?” Harry asks. He shoots to the edge of his seat. This is good news. Malfoy will be able to get better grades and his father won’t be so upset with him anymore.
Draco nods and then takes his Potions textbook from his bag. Harry follows his example and soon they are both bent over the book while Draco tries to explain to Harry how to make a Wideye Potion. The potion has two steps, but Harry keeps messing them up.
Nott offered one of the badges to Hermione but told her not to touch his hand, that he didn’t want it to get slimed up by a Mudblood. And that seemed to be too much for Draco. He reached for his wand and everyone around us was backing away. Nott also pulled out his wand. They both cast a spell. Draco went for Funnunculus and Nott used Densaugeo. Jets of light shot from both wands and hit each other in midair. They ricocheted off at angles, one hitting Crabbe who got great ugly boils on his nose. The other hit Hermione. Ron was next to her in seconds to help her. Her teeth were growing at an alarming rate, making her look like a beaver. This is when Snape arrived. He sent Crabbe and Hermione to the hospital wing and he gave Draco and Nott detention.
After some time, Harry helps Draco pull on his trousers, and they walk back out into the exam room. Draco sits back down on the exam table. Harry takes the space beside him. The healer sits in front of them and holds out some tissues.
Draco is hanging over my shoulder now, reading what I’ve just written down and I just want to lay in his arm for a while. I’ll write to you soon, tell you all about my new subjects and stuff.
A tear escapes Draco’s eye. Why does Harry always have to be so considerate? How come he always knows when Draco is struggling? It’s been this way ever since that last year at Hogwarts. The year Draco had to fight an addiction, the hatred from his peers and the pressure of finishing seven N.E.W.T.s. It’s why he fell so hard for Harry in the first place. Only now he hates it. He needs Harry to hate him, to blame him, to push him away. Then at least Draco wouldn’t hurt him anymore by taking away his most prominent dream.
It’s not that this hasn’t crossed Harry’s mind. He’s heard the stories about Uncle Sirius’ upbringing and how he was kicked out when he told his parents he was gay. But Draco wouldn’t have pushed Harry away the way he did. There is no way he could have looked that horrified when he feels the same. Harry is sure of this. Draco doesn’t want Harry in the way Harry wants him. And there is nothing that Harry can do to change that.
Harry shakes his head. “He’s still amazed by the fact that you are pregnant. And that magic is real. You would say that after a year and a half he would get used to the idea.”
Draco stands up, and Harry rushes over to him. Together they walk after healer Burke to the now-familiar room. Draco sits down on the bed, and Harry sits down on a stool, just like healer Burke.
After that we had tea and Professor Lupin asked about Draco, if he was doing okay after the Bogart incident. I told him all was fine. I didn’t have it in me to tell him that Draco has nightmares still and then just clutches onto me when I wake him and cries. I don’t know what to do to make it any better. I told him I wasn’t going to die any time soon, and I know he knows I don’t want to die anymore, but the nightmares won’t stop. I asked Miss Davis if she knew what we could do about them, but she said it will just take time. Really she’s becoming more useless every day.
Hermione shakes her head in her disapproving way and Neville pretends to study a plant close to the water edge. They all sit and enjoy the September sun that still shines bright. It won’t be long before it gets too cold to sit outside, and Harry will hate being stuck in the castle for all of winter. But for now, he will enjoy this time outside with his friends. Hermione has already taken out a book and Ron has gone to see what kind of plant Neville found.
At the Quidditch pitch the wind was so bad we all staggered sideways as we walked out onto the team, except for Derrick and Bole. They are so big, it was like the wind was no match for them. And only five minutes into the game I was already soaked to my skin and half frozen on my broom. I could hardly see my teammates, let alone the Snitch. The commentary wasn’t to be heard over the winds. My glazes kept getting clouded by the rain and I was glad when we had a short time-out. We were fifty points ahead. Draco complained that his hair was getting too long, that it was sticking to his face and getting in his eyes all the time. He used a small band to tie it at the back, but it kept slipping out. We’ll have to look into a way to keep it out of the way for the next match. I’m sure Daphne will be able to help with that.
It got worse after that. We were paired up by the professors and against complaints from both of us Professor Snape paired me with Draco, saying it was time we tried to work out or differences, so Draco could start helping me with my Potions homework again. Professor Snape was tired of reading my horrible work. Hermione was forced to partner with Millicent, a girl in my house that is I think dating Vincent at the moment.
The headmaster stood up without saying a word, leaving the hospital wing hopefully to get Draco’s wand. Once the headmaster has left, Draco sits down next to me on my bed. He asked me if I was still mad about him stopping me from killing Black and I told him I wasn’t, that if it hadn’t been for him I would have killed an innocent man. We linked our hands and took some of the chocolate Madam Pomfrey had left for us.
The morning of the 1st of September started really good. I woke up wrapped in Draco’s arms. We kissed some until Dora banged at our door telling us that we had 5 minutes till breakfast. We hurried to get dressed for the day, eat breakfast and hurried to the floo with our suitcases. Hedwig was being difficult, she didn’t want to go into her cage until Draco promised her that we give her treats every hour on the train. We use the floo to go to a special room at King Cross for wizard families to arrive by floo to catch the train.
Well, I’m sure you will understand that Draco’s father wasn’t all too happy about that. That afternoon Draco got a very long letter from his father. It went on and on about how Draco was ruining the Malfoy name and that he should be ashamed of himself for showing these feelings to the world. He should know by now that even though he might think he loves me, that he will marry a good pureblood girl one day to continue the Malfoy name. Draco was really upset about the letter. He still pretends he doesn’t care what his father thinks of him and that he hates the man. But I can see that it’s hurting him when his father talks to him like he’s the biggest disappointment ever.
He is the king of Slytherin. The one who destroyed the boy who lived. The person others fear for his boldness. He is the man his father wanted him to be. The one to save the Malfoy name. The person that gets them back into the Dark Lord’s good graces. The one thing Draco decided he didn’t want to be anymore.
Remus crouches so he can look Harry in the eyes. He gives Harry a soft smile. “Harry, some families are different than ours,” he says. “Not all parents are supportive of their children. You know that Sirius’ parents didn’t support him. And more families are that way.”
The next day, Harry sneaks off to the library again after his last class. He finds Malfoy and sits down opposite him, just as the day before. They both do their homework without acknowledging each other until it’s time for dinner. Neville is the one that asks Harry this time where he’s been. Harry doesn’t tell them. If he does, Hermione will want to join, and that will ruin his entire plan. Or Neville and Ron will pop by, only to find out Harry’s still trying to get Malfoy’s attention. Harry doesn’t want to know what Neville will have to say about that. Harry already knows it’s not healthy to obsess about Malfoy. He doesn’t need Neville pointing out what it might mean. Harry isn’t even sure himself what it all means. The only thing he knows is that he needs to do this.
It’s the start of something new. Harry has thought about it. He will just leave Malfoy notes. At the end of every class they share, Harry slides a note onto Malfoy’s desk. Sometimes he even does it when he walks into the classroom. Most notes just have comments about the class they just had. Explaining why the entire class laughed or pointing out an important thing mentioned for their assignments. Some of them are offers for help and some have silly drawings of how to sign simple words. All the notes end up in the bin, without being read.
Pansy gets up to hug Draco and congratulates him, and that is the last they say about it until the entire family has taken its place at the dining table. Before Molly can tell everyone to dig in, Teddy climbs on top of his chair so that everyone can see him.
“I survived the family,” Ron says when he steps back into the room. “I think we have about five minutes before mom arrives and maybe ten more before my entire family thinks they need to see Rose.”
“I love you. We’ll be down in a couple of minutes, and then we can all have some hot chocolate,” Harry says, and then he’s gone. Draco looks at the mess he made. He waves his wand around to clean up all the glass that is covering the floor. And then he pulls a blanket over himself and hides away from the world.
It’s when I told Hermione, Ron and Neville that I’m not brave, Neville gave me the card of his chocolate frog he was eating. He said it was because I collected them, but I know he did it to try to cheer me up. I think he understands a little, he confessed not long ago that he thinks he was misplaced in Gryffindor because he’s not brave at all. I looked at the card and it was of headmaster Dumbledore. Just like the first card I got. And when I was reading the back of the card again I got so excited, because I had found Flamel! The card said: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’. When I told the others, Hermione jumped from her seat and ran out of the Great Hall, telling us to wait for her. When she came back she had an enormous old book in her arms. She called it light reading and Ron commented on that, making them snap at each other again. Really this girlfriend, boyfriend stuff is confusing.
“Don’t, Harry, please don’t,” he whispers with a choked-up voice. Tears fall from his eyes and he doesn’t care. Not while the only person who matters is slipping away from him. “I can’t do this without you.”
Neville pats Harry on his shoulder and then closes the curtain again. The door of the dorm opens and then it’s all silent around Harry. He doesn’t plan to get out of his bed today. He might not be able to stay in his dorm for the rest of the year, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to.
I knew he was lying about the homework because I’ve been studying with him a lot since Hermione went into ‘oh no, exams are only a few weeks away, we need to stress out and drag everyone around me with me into a study frenzy’ mode. It’s really nice to work with Draco. He’s really smart and I think I might even pass potions with a decent grade now thanks to him. If he starts talking to me again that is. He also got detention, and that is kind of my fault.
Harry laughs now. “He won’t overhear,” he says. Not as long as the few people that know sign languages don’t sign it in front of him.
“No, thank you. I do not enjoy witnessing heterosexual sex,” Draco says. Ron laughs and that traitor Hermione grins.
And I don’t know why Draco is doing this, but it hurts. I feel so sad all the time now. Did I do something wrong? Had he expected me to do something while still on the train home last July, or was I supposed to send him a letter straight away to tell him I also like him? Or was it all just a joke? A nice way of bullying silly Harry some more? Was he never really my friend, but just pretending?
I was very happy when Hagrid found me there in Knockturn Alley (a sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told me the name of the alley). Hagrid dragged me back to Diagon Alley and helped me find the Weasleys. He also asked me why I hadn’t written back to him and I explained him all about the Dursleys and Dobby the house elf that had stolen my letters. Hagrid started growling about those lousy muggles when Hermione found us. She ran up to us and threw her arms around my neck and hugged me, saying she was glad I was okay and that summer had been too long without her best friend around.
“Yeah, who are you looking for?” Harry asks. He pulls his bag up from the floor and searches for the map.
With that, Harry ends the call. He walks back into the bedroom and crawls into bed with Draco. He tells Draco he loves him and puts his arms around him. They don’t say another word, and they don’t wish each other a happy new year when the fireworks start to light up the room. It’s so different from last year it frightens Harry. All he can do is hope that this year will be better than the previous.
Harry is allowed to spend a week at Ron’s place. They fly around the large garden most of the time, joined by Ginny, Fred and George. The last two teach Ron that he’ll never be good enough to join the team, but Ron for once doesn’t let his twin brothers destroy his mood and doesn’t give up.
“Keep your voice down,” Harry snaps while he looks around them. Nobody sits close      enough to overhear them, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. “Nobody is to know.”
“Harry, don’t go reading it now, I need breakfast,” Teddy says. He’s playing with his new Duplo, building a castle and rescuing the dragon from the evil princess by the sounds of it.
The timer rings and Draco takes a deep breath. He tells himself again that it doesn’t matter what the result is. They are still young, and they have all the time in the world to start a family of their own. Draco gets up and walks back to the counter. He stares at the vial. The liquid inside is a clear red. Draco grabs the instructions and skims towards the section that explains how to read the results. His eyes water and he looks back at the vial.
“Have a good swim,” the woman says and then she continues her walk over the beach. Harry follows her with his eyes. He can’t move. The energy he’d had only moments ago has evaporated. The truth of what has been robbed from him and Draco slamming in like a hammer. They could have been that woman in a year. They could have had a new little addition to their family. And now it’s all gone, just like everything else in Harry’s life.
And then the other teachers were moving in around me. Professor Snape was there and he stepped next to me, shielding me away from the others. The headmaster asked me calmly if I had put my name in the goblet and I answered him truthfully. Then all the teachers were discussing how it could be that my name came out of the goblet and that it was unfair that Hogwarts would have two champions. Professor Snape stood up for me, saying that I wouldn’t lie about something like this. I opened my mouth to tell them that I can redraw, that I don’t want to compete anyway, but I never got the change. Professor Moody came walking in that instant and told us all that it was a magical biding contract and that there was no choice but to compete.
On the day of the match, Marcus placed my Firebolt on the breakfast table. Most students loved how the other house stared at it jealously. Marcus was most pleased with Wood’s disbelieved reaction. They are both so determent to win the cup this year it’s has become a dangerous rivalry. I believe professor Snape had to stop the two from fighting in his class the other day. Wood thinks it’s unfair I fly a Firebolt, that it gives Slytherin an unfair advantage. Diggory, the team captain of Hufflepuff is a lot nicer. He came by to congratulate me on my new broom. He even apologised again for not realising I fell off my broom when he caught the snitch in our last game. I told him it was fine as long as he would lose all his other games. He laughed and said he couldn’t promise anything.
I’ve told Draco about the visit of Aunt Marge, and he told me I missed a perfect opportunity to take advantage of the situation. He told me I should have played Uncle Vernon, tricking him into signing my permission slip for Hogsmeade. In return for behaving around Aunt Marge. Off course it wouldn’t have worked, since I kind of blow her up and everything. But Draco is convinced it could have worked, that it would have helped me keep my temper. I told him that if I hadn’t lost my temper we wouldn’t have seen each other at all this holiday. And Draco agrees with me that would have been horrible and that our current situation is preferable.
“Doesn’t change the fact that he hates me. And is straight.” Harry looks at the blond hair again and signs. It’s hopeless. Even more hopeless that Harry’s crush on Cedric.
“He trusted you!” Granger continues. “Said you changed. That you aren’t the evil bastard you pretend to be. And you used him. You knew he loved you, and you used him.”
“Okay,” Draco answers. He wants to look away from Harry’s eyes. Away from the love that shines through. Somehow this little question made Harry forget all about the fight they just had, and Draco doesn’t understand. Just like he doesn’t know why he hates Pansy so much right now. Pansy who just had a baby boy.
Harry rolls his eyes but says yes anyway. Iris’ eyes are red and Harry never meant to make her worry. Neville pulls her back a little so that Harry can look around him. Hermione and Ron stand at the end of the bed. Ron’s face is redder than usual and Harry is glad Ron at least feels a little bad about wanting to rush off to dinner. And then someone on his other side moves. Harry turns his head and then has to close his eyes when the world starts to spin.
The kitchen is next. Harry vanishes Draco’s favourite mugs, his special tea that helps him sleep. The plates Draco had made for them for their wedding. The pictures on the wall disappear, just like the pile of Muggle newspapers Draco liked to read. It all has to go. Harry doesn’t want to question a single thing in his home when he’s done. It needs to be Draco free. Everything he left behind needs to go.
Once Professor Moody was seated Headmaster Dumbledore continued to explain why there won’t be a Quidditch Cup this year. It seems that our school is hosting the TriWizard Tournament this year. Students of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will join us this year for this tournament. It’s a competition between the three schools that was stopped when the death toll mounted too high. Each school gets one champion to represent them. Don’t worry, I won’t be able to try (not that I want too) or Draco either (who’s still kind of keen on it) because there is an age limitation. You need to be off age to compete. Adrian and Miles both are going to try to get in.
“Yeah,” Harry confirms as he stops in front of Draco. “I thought it was appropriate, as I’m about to kiss you.”
And it’s not only the mean words of Malfoy and the beatings from Nott, Crabbe and Goyle anymore. Malfoy and Nott also decided to start practising jinxes on me. They enjoy making me trip in the hallways using the trip jinx. And Malfoy locked my legs together with the leg-locker curse just outside the library the other day. Malfoy had waited until Hermione had gone and I was alone. Malfoy joked that he had been looking for someone to practice that on. I didn’t know the counter curse so I had to bunny hop all the way to the hospital wing to get Madam Pomfrey to help me. She asked me who did that to me, but I didn’t tell her. I don’t want any more trouble then I’m already in. When I told Hermione, Ron and Neville what had happened they said I should stand up to him and that Malfoy is used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier. I told them I’m not as brave as them, if I was I would have been in Gryffindor with them. Malfoy said the same to me. That even though I hang around Gryffindor’s, it won’t turn me into a brave idiot like them; it only showed how stupid I was thinking they would stand by me when it would really matter. Didn’t I know that Gryffindor’s can’t be trusted? He said I must have damaged my head badly when the Dark Lord came for me. And maybe he’s right, it’s not like I’m any good in school. Every time I have to use my wand I get scared and then I mess everything up.
I hope others will start listing to him soon because I hate how everyone looks at me like I’m some dangerous person.
“Yes, I do,” Harry says. “I have the hots for Draco Malfoy. You’re happy now?” he snaps. Harry drops his head backwards and looks at the sky. Some clouds have hidden the sun that was shining this morning. It’s a shame. Draco’s hair always lights up so beautifully in the sunlight.
The dog attacked again and this time it went straight for Ron. Its jaws fastened around Ron’s arm and it dragged Ron away. Hermione was screaming and Neville tried to catch the dog but it was no use.
The kitchen door opens again, and Harry walks in. “What is taking you all so long. Seamus is about to explode, afraid he won’t get his glass of champagne in time for the count down.”
Sometime later, more familiar footsteps make their way towards them. Harry is on his feet before Ron is even in view. And when they look at each other, they share massive grins. Draco bites his lip not to say something mean. He wants to hurt Ron, make him less happy. He wants Harry to feel pain.
And then it was weekend. No classes to distract me and hardly any homework, since I’ve done most of it already during the week with Hermione in the library. I still got up early so I could have breakfast before Malfoy and his friends woke up. Afterwards, I walked around the grounds and met up with Ron and Neville, who was released from the hospital wing. We talked about their families and what it was like to grow up in a wizarding family. I wish I had grown up with you, mom and dad, so I could have had magical toys and stuff. It really sounds amazing to be able to grow up like that. Ron asked me why I was hanging out with Hermione so much and I told them it was because the library felt like a place where Malfoy and his friends would leave me alone. And Hermione was just always there and she was nice to me. I asked them about how it was to be in Gryffindor House and they talked away about living in the west tower. I had fun that morning and they invited me to sit with them for lunch. Some of the older Gryffindor students were not happy about it, but Ron’s brothers Fred and George told them to back off and that Gryffindor should feel honoured that the great Harry Potter wanted to join them at their table. After that everyone left us alone. Seamus and Dean, the two other Gryffindor boys joined us and we had a nice afternoon, talking about Quidditch and how horrible Snape was. Dean apologized for being mean about my head of house, but I told him it was okay, that I also didn’t like Snape. I stayed at the Gryffindor table until after dinner and I had a lot of fun. But when the Gryffindor’s went to their common room I had to leave them and head back to the dungeons.
Harry doesn’t look at her. His eyes are locked with Draco’s. Draco lifts his hands and signs “You okay?” Harry nods his head and then smiles. Then he points towards Draco. Draco first nods but then he shakes his head. He grabs his bag and pulls out his parchment and quill.
The feast was amazing. The Mandrakes had matured so all the petrified people were there and Hermione had joined Draco and me at the Slytherin table. It was good to have her back and she was pleased to see that Draco and I were now boyfriends. Ron and Neville also joined us halfway through the feast. It was a bit awkward, seeing Ron and Hermione trying to be civil for my sake, but it was fun. Daphne was very interested in everything that had happened and Greg wanted a word by word account. And at the end of the feast, Hagrid walked into the Great Hall. I got up and ran towards him and hugged him, glad to have him back.
“Sweetheart,” Harry says. He holds out his hands and is relieved when Draco looks at him instead of Ron. “It’s okay, I’m here,” Harry tells Draco. Tears are on Draco’s face, and blood drips from his left arm. It’s worse than Harry has ever seen before. Usually, Draco stops before the blood can start to pool. Harry should never have taken them to this party. They should have just stayed at home. Everything was fine when they were at home. Draco was doing better, was getting back on his feet.
Dobby was excited to see us Said he’d been hoping to see us and that now we were visiting him. He is working at Hogwarts now, told us how Headmaster Dumbledore was kind enough to hire him and pay him for his services. Draco wanted to know all that Dobby had done since he was set free and Dobby told us all while we had some tea. It turns out that Dobby has only been at Hogwarts for a week. He’d been travelling the country for two years trying to find a job, but nobody would hire him because he wanted to get paid.
Professor Snape guides Draco out of the dungeons. “Where are we going, sir?” Draco asks. He has no clue what this is all about. Surely it can’t be about his little tumble down the stairs with Potter last week. Madam Pomfrey healed all the wounds and cuts and that was it.
I decided to turn around, walk back to the road and call for the Knight Bus again and go to London. I could wait till morning and then get my money and disappear. I would write to Draco and tell him what happened and maybe meet up with him somewhere to say goodbye.
I was still crying by the time Malfoy came into the dormitory a little before dinner. He didn’t say a word, just opened his own trunk and search for something all the way at the bottom. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw what he dug up. He was holding my notebook and cloak. He placed them on the ground next to me and walked out of the dormitory again. I didn’t go to dinner that night; I just curled on my bed, holding the cloak and notebook to my chest.
Harry draws a breath and then releases it slowly. “The rat traps are stupid,” he says. “They don’t seem to do anything.”
I did get my Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder’s Map back. Sirius convinced Professor Lupin that they belong to me, that you, dad, would have wanted me to have them. I did have to promise Sirius I won’t use them if it could put me in danger. But I could do all the pranks I want with them, saying you would be proud of me dad for not following school rules. I get the feeling you and Sirius were up to no good more often than not and I look forward to learning more and more about you and mom from Sirius.
“Did you truly already finish all your homework?” Hermione asks when Harry again changes position on the couch.
Harry is proud. And so in love. And so grateful for everything Draco did tonight. “Thank you for today,” he signs. “You saved us.”
Harry repeats his signs, but slower this time. Draco shakes his head and Harry pulls Draco’s parchment towards him and writes down Ron’s question.
He looks at Hermione. Tears are on her cheeks, a hand on her mouth. She finally understands how Harry had always known where to go next that final year. Why he never minded having the graveyard shift on watch. It was the moments he would meet up with Draco.
Harry walks into the walk-in closet. It wasn’t originally in the house. No, after hearing Draco complain for over six months that he had no decent place to put his clothes, Harry had it build. Now it’s silly. Three-quarters of it is empty. All the fancy suits are gone, all the Gucci shoes taken without saying a word. Harry looks at his shirts and fancy clothes Draco bought for him over the years. His fingers slide over the expensive fabrics. Harry never like them as much as he liked his sweaters and jeans. But Draco had loved it when Harry would dress up if they would go out. So Harry had never complained.
And Harry does. He tells how Pettigrew tried to kill him. And how Draco punched Pettigrew in the stomach and cast a protection spell to save Harry. He explains how Pettigrew got away and how Remus and Snape had shown up.
Neville stares at Harry as if he'd grown another head. Harry grins his teeth together and spits out: “What?”
Malfoy doesn’t smile. He turns towards the window and shivers. The rain outside has intensified. The world has turned black. And is it just Harry, or is it getting cold in here? He breathes out and can see his own breath. Malfoy moves closer to Harry when the lights in the train go out.
Harry puts his diary away and looks at his friends. They sit in the Great Hall, finishing up some homework before dinner starts. It started with just Harry, Draco, Neville, Hermione and Ron. But just a few minutes ago Ginny and Luna joined them. It’s still more than half an hour until dinner, but it seems the Great Hall is already filling up. Ever since the Christmas decorations went up last weekend it’s the favourite spot for most students to do their homework.
