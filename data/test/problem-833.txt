‘No, you’d think they’d all had a meeting about how to keep us busy. There’s far too much due around the same time.’
Now Hagrid was cursing large frame and wheezing through a brisk jog. He’d had to shove off his fur robe in favour of lightening the load on his poor knees.
Like Draco would put any stock in what the Headmaster deemed safe or dangerous. Especially not after he chucked Draco into the Forbidden Forest after, rightfully, telling McGonagall that the Weasel was galivanting about after dark. For merely doing his
He set it aside, trying not to dry heave. Harry couldn’t understand why deer and other leaf eaters went crazy for the stuff; it was truly awful.
Harry could see the markings on his arms swirl nervously in jagged motions as he approached the bed. It was a far cry from the pile of blankets Harry was used to. With a tentative step, he edged onto the bed and let out a gasp for how much his body sunk into it.
Stone laughed humourlessly. ‘You don’t know that he did. Even then, doesn’t mean we go about killing babies! God, could you imagine what would happen if The Prophet got a hold of that? No fuckin’ way am I going to have that kind of blood on my hands.’
Hagrid was a half-giant and that meant sometimes he didn’t know his own strength. He was mindful to be extremely gentle as he tapped the salve on the gaping wound.
He stroked a hand down his green scales as he sank a shiv under the skin where his markings converged on his back for safekeeping. ‘Yes, come pick berries with me.’ Harry asked politely, because you always had to be polite to snakes – else they might nibble on you.
had but a moment’s notice, it barely turned before Harry brought the shiv down, its pale back was now gaping and bloody. The pain had it slumping forward, its flesh now beginning to become sickly. The blood which had been thick and clotted before was now a dark brown. Harry’s magic was seeping into the beast, its wound decaying like it was already dead.
After a few beats of dead silence, the boy peered from the branch he stood on and then jumped from the great height with a grace that belied his age and height.
‘I’d put them away.’ Hagrid said carefully, keeping his tone soft for the lad’s sake. ‘He doesn’t seem particularly fond of them.’
'…Small black spirit?' Dumbledore had questioned the boy when Hagrid led them to the Headmasters office.
when inquisitive, inky fingers reached out and squashed his cheeks together. And a chuckle escaped when the boy pulled at Albus’ hat and the boy put it on, only for it to swamp his head completely.
‘He might be able to glean something off any trail offered to us, though Hagrid has informed me whatever it is leaves very little to trace. The rouge wolves might know something if they can be bribed correctly.’ Albus mused.
Harry’ mind glanced on a time before his hut, Colther, and the wolves and shuddered slightly with the pain of it. Screams and blood were all he could piece together in the cracks of that pain, and it revolted him – the part of him that remembered
He ran with the wind as his guide, billowing through the trees that shifted their branches from his path. And then heard the growls of wolves following him. He glanced back, the wolves keen eyes were sharp as they trailed his steps. They had heard the forest’s call and now flanked him, protecting him, guarding his path. His leapt over brook and bog, closely followed by the soft thumps of heavy paws.
‘Yeah. Last time I tried, a whole tree rotted away.’ Harry sighed. ‘It’s always the same.’ Then Harry eyed the snake. ‘You can climb those quite easily-.’
For days after, Harry was too anxious to return. He really hadn’t wanted to be seen by one of those creatures. Colther had explained that they were many in number and probably wouldn’t be best pleased that Harry was among the creatures of the Forest or that he’d been so close to them all this time. He said that they tended to harm that which they did not understand, or those they felt threatened by.
Lily’s eyes began to burn with determination. The love for her son was as fierce as it was unshakable. James took his wife’s hand, his support and protectiveness over his family was equally unwavering.
Draco’s fingers had reached out from the shadows that hid him to take it. His hands were so close that he could feel the heat rise off the boy’s bare skin.
Hagrid softly repositioned the boy in his arms and helped lift the hat that they boy was now struggling with. His cheeks hurt with how hard he was smiling.
Clambering now, Harry then flopped onto it and as he sank, his body let out an involuntary hiss of pleasure.
Draco was peering into the shadows of the trees behind him, half expecting McGonagall to jump out an snatch him. Then, suddenly, he heard a shuffling noise come from the far side of the enclosure below him.
The two Auror’s snapped their own shields up, nearly clipped by the fall out. The air now smelled electric and sickly-sweet, like the bodies on the floor still staring at them all.
Hagrid brought some crusts of the dried pastes to Albus and Severus; eyebrows raised when he’d told them that all of wounds had cleared up, as if the Unicorn’s had never been injured in the first instance. Even the young male was now trotting about the place, its hind leg was not perfect, but a damn sight better than what it would have been otherwise.
He had quickly sought out his family friend, understandably still shaken over finding himself in close quarters with a
‘I’m- I.’ Stickes words failed him, the past hour had caught up with him in the ten minutes of utter silence.
Unconsciously he settled on the latter and sank onto his haunches. He held his head in his hands and stared through his fingers
The Gamekeeper’s hut offered a little light, thought the sight of it made Draco still slightly. Dark trees loomed over him then, and suddenly a night-time walk in the Forest didn’t seem like such a good idea.
Snape sighed. ‘Albus, whatever it may be is something that can clearly survive among that rancid lot – something that may not want to be found.’
The boy stared on as if he’d just witnessed a miracle. He approached the rag cautiously, poking at it, sniffing it. Draco sighed and spelled the soaped rag to rub at the boy now who yelped. Then, when the boy saw that the rag was getting rid of the dirt and sludge, he let out a pleased hum.
soft. Not like an adults voice.' Malfoy mumbled. ‘It’s was much shorter that the mare, about heights with its chest.’
After crafting a ring of fenced dead wood like the hairy creature kept, Harry then slapped paste on them all, muttering about
And all the creatures in black were looking up at him. There were far too many to fight at once, Harry’s stomach dropped with the realisation.
‘The first, and the most important, is that you must not direct you magic at any living thing. But, as I have noticed, you are already employing this, yes?’
‘Your magic is highly unusual. And can be somewhat dangerous. People in our world tend to dislike either of those things. Plus, there are things that revealing your identity would…complicate.’
Harry didn’t do this. But that not what the papers had written. No. The Ministry had killed an innocent child and were
?’ Albus arched a brow at that. Both men knew something so benign as a fat, clucking bird should be able to survive in the Forest – never mind an entire flock.
‘Quite right you are Hagrid.’ With a quelling gesture, Dumbledore pushed the others to pocket their wands as he popped his down his sleeve.
found of tea, but Harry had never seen milk or sugar. Harry could only compare Albus’ knowledge of what creamy or sweet was with what he
‘Watch it.’ Harry murmured. ‘Or we’ll both end up with sore legs – what use would we be then?’ He said gently.
The boy then stood before trying to scrape the muck off himself. He grew visibly frustrated when it seemed to cling to his skin. Draco itched to help; they had just learned about gentle cleaning charms that mimicked a sponge bath of warm soapy water. Draco feared that the boy had never seen soap and was appalled with the notion.
Turning to hide the boy away from the bodies for a moment, Stickes cast a few quick cleaning charms and cast a glamour on them.
The Headmaster paused a little longer, looking between Harry and the hatch, before he sighed slightly then offered Harry a small dish of lemon drops.
‘Stop chasing ‘im, yah bleedin’ nutters! You’ve just gone an’ spooked ‘im!’ Hagrid shouted out to four very deaf ears.
It was quick: the boy grabbed the bowl, snatched the rest of the red cloth, and then disappeared into the shadowy trees on the far side of the enclosure.
‘Keep it in your sights.’ Harry whispered to himself as he tracked its frenzied movement between the trees.
The child was a comforting weight in his arms and strangely quiet after the Apparitition. Andrew used so scream bloody murder after he or Laura arrived anywhere, and it always took aged to settle him. And then Stickes almost laughed again when he realised he actually missed that god awful noise.
Then the boy started prodding and pulling at different things on Hagrid’s face as if he’d never seen a face before and was trying very hard to work out what it was. He seemed particularly taken with the mass of Hagrid’s hair; he’d grabbed large clumps of it and pulled the frizz out to its ends as if he’d never seen anything like it before, making odd hissing noises as he did so.
‘Stupid creatures.’ Colther had hissed as he watched Harry do all the hard work. ‘Can’t even accept aid gracefully, and they are meant to be light,
‘I’ll need to hunt soon. You joining me for that?’ Harry asked as he spied a cowberry bush, the red fruits ripe and glistening with the morning dew.
Albus’ expression was something between fascination and wonder as he took the boy in. His features slowly bloomed into a beaming smile when the boy visibly relaxed. He grinned stupidly when the little one climbed round into Hagrid’s surprised arms.
The female mare seemed to snort in agreement before huffing against another wave of discomfort. Harry got back to rubbing her neck and stomach, guiding the mixture and pushing at the knots in her stomach, just like the centaurs taught him…
In Albus’ mind there were rules, opinions, conjecture, thought, feelings, society, environment, knowledge, skill, motivation, subtext, and cues that Harry couldn’t begin to understand.
‘You planned this. Brought us here to kill a kid.’ Stickes said lowly, his nausea racked up a few notches.
He wished fervently for the courage to approach the boy, to stand up and call out a greeting, to introduce himself, to hear the boy speak, to learn the boy’s name, to know what his voice sounded like, what
The Potions Master let a highly unusual giggle escape. Mortified, he cleared his throat and schooled himself.
Harry turned his face into the warm air against his cheek, wishing it would stay longer than it did. He then kneeled and let him pack scent him. Wolves were creatures of tactile comfort, they needed to know he was safe and calm before they would release him.
Then the boy’s features lit up before he nodded. Hagrid scooped the boy up who climbed atop of the half-giant’s shoulders as Minerva walked alongside them with a pleased smile.
It was all he could think about. The margins of his textbooks were filled with small doodles of hippogriffs and unicorns. He sketched out the boy’s figure, small on the page like it seemed from the distance Draco maintained from him. He’d try to imagine his face, what it must look like up close. But with each drawing he tried, he quickly scribbled out.
‘Albus…’ Lupin spoke hesitantly and turned his wide amber eyes to the Headmaster who’d stilled a little too. ‘…Moony.’
Green, focused eyes locked with his. ‘Albus.’ The boy said before he turned. ‘Minerva.’ He stated to the abnormally shaken witch.
The process was normally revolting, but in this heat is was downright revolting. Taking breaths through his mouth did not help, he could taste it – the spider silk cloth over his mouth did little to help.
With a growling hiss Harry clapped his hands together, and the earth rumbled and shook under the red-wool being. The earth split, and it cried out as it was swallowed into the chasm Harry had created.
But it stopped when Hagrid turned. The half-giant followed the boy’s line of sight which narrowed on the wands the others were holding and was darkened by the strange inky markings around his eyes.
‘I know you!’ Harry cooed at the foal who had followed him about when they healed the mares. ‘You’re pretty far from home…we’ll get you back, eh? We’ll need to.’ Harry said to himself as he sized up the small herd of foals and started to plan their capture. ‘The hairy creature might follow your trail up here.’ Harry said whilst looking pointedly at his hut.
There was just enough of a gap in the canopy above to let in a little sunlight today. He wished he could stay in the long grass and play. But he needed to pick the high berries and fruits creatures like Harry could reach.
Harry shifted his weight forward a bit to get a better look of it; this one didn’t have anything covering its face. And he was stunned to see it looked somewhat like him – except its skin was all pale and blank. It didn’t have the face markings like Harry’s – which right now had moved to form a straight band across his eyes, pitch and inky from ear to ear.
When he finally got back to the hut, it dawned on Harry that he hadn’t hunted for a few days. Mood soured, he grabbed the bow and quiver with a moan and slammed the door on a fat, chuckling snake.
He stretched out his bow, his arms roiling with the tension as his arrowhead tracked something in the distance Harry could not yet see, only feel. Harry feared the creature was back again and quickly he rushed up the nearest fir with feline grace to get a better vantage point.
He rushed in straight to where the water was at its deepest. When it reached his ribs, he took a breath and sank into it completely. He let the current wash away the stinking pulp and the heat induced haze.
The male then nudged into the crook of Harry’s shoulder, and with a low crooning sound then went to tend to the foal Harry had fed. Harry felt a warmth in his chest at the sight. He felt like he’d finally got a little of the thing he wanted when he watched the hairy creature tend to the herd and the beasts in his hut.
He then learned that the creature was welcomed by the Forest. It herded and fed the creatures within, always with his calm noises and gentle hands. Harry had seen him birth beasts, clean hooves, brush wings, and nuzzle into them when he was done.
With a grin on his face, Harry heard the rest of the boys leave, all of them shuffling out and shouting something about
The Potions Master regarded Draco shrewdly before sighing and motioning for Draco to return to dormitory immediately.
air was hot and cloying that morning. It was sleepy in the forest; both animals and plants alike seemed to drop under the blanket of constant, almost wet heat.
‘The Potter child, Harry. He was found alive with the victims, mortem says its been a week.’ Cross continued with a furrowed brow. ‘Healers say he’s healthy and that magic your sensing? Well, it’s his apparently.’
‘Severus? I mean, there is no need to be embarrassed, it happens to the best of us…well maybe not me specifically because of those potions I was just telling you about. But as an infant I’m told I suffered a rather bad case of cradle cap-.’
Embarrassed, Draco buried his head into the crook of his elbow. He listened to the splash and wade of the water. Despite himself, he looked up to see the boy sniff at the bar of yellow soap hesitantly before sneezing and the soap slipping from his wet hands.
Looking up, he realised that there had been an entrance of some kind hidden in the tower, and now Harry was lost in whatever it held. Also, he noted that there was no way he could climb back up.
‘Tha’s a good lad.’ Hagrid murmured as then capped the healing salve up with a bloodied hand. He stared at the boy’s face, a face he knew a long time ago.
‘Ah!’ Harry exclaimed when the moths suddenly burst towards him. His magic automatically lashed out and caught a few, killing them with a rot before the fell to the floor with a quiet
Getting to know Harry better had been an interesting experience. On the one hand, Draco was relieved to find that the alpha was kind and patient and would undoubtedly make a good father. On the other hand, the more Draco learned about Harry, the more he fell hopelessly in love with him.
“Nah,” Ron swallowed a large gulp of his drink, “you know Mione hates clubs. She trusts me though,” he added hurriedly. Harry smiled, his friends seemed to have been doing better recently with Hermione having decided to apply for the one year internship in the States rather than the five year.
Harry disappeared in to the bathroom and Draco could hear the creak of the shower pipes turning on. He waited a few more minutes, watching the bright flashes before deciding to get down after all. His body was starting to ache having been stuck in one position for an extended period of time.
Harry turned to look out the window, wincing a little at the pale light. The rain was coming down in heavy sheets and he could see that the grounds were already becoming waterlogged, great muddy puddles bubbling up on the grass.
“There you are!” Katie grinned as she jogged towards Draco. She was wearing a loose white blouse and blue and white striped linen shorts. “You’re going to be late for your own birthday party.”
“Oh, well, don’t worry about that,” Harry grinned ruefully, “like I told you, I don’t spend my galleons on anything really and I honestly wanted to.”
Harry smiled, kissing Draco on the forehead. They had already decided that Hermione and Ron were going to be godparents but Harry had had a feeling Draco might also want to ask Katie. “Of course,” Harry told him before pulling back the curtains and sticking his head out.
“N-Nothing,” Draco stated quickly before Harry could even defend himself. “Please Sev, d-don’t tell him.”
“Regardless,” Hermione said breezily as Draco knew his scent was starting to get notes of embarrassment, “you
Draco’s cauldron was still bubbling happily away in the corner. His latest project came from one of Sev’s diaries and was linked to a seemingly self composed spell. Draco had interpreted as much of the theory as he could from his godfather’s faded calligraphy but it seemed the spell was to prevent someone from feeling alone.
“Yes,” Snape bit out miserably. “But spells like that never work how you want them to. Fickle genies listening to ill formed wishes. Draco had no idea the spell would cause him to get pregnant with Harry’s child, but the magic sensed his loneliness, his desire for a family, and so that’s what it gave him. It gave him a part of Harry to keep.”
Snape gave a small strangled sound as Remus stood up and walked out of the garden, resting his hand on Harry’s shoulder before leaving across the lawn.
“I hear the auror trainers have been working you guys hard,” Colum smirked, his eyes flickering appreciatively to Harry’s muscles.
“All good,” Harry replied, “I was just going to pop to the loo if you’ll be alright for a few minutes?”
“We watched Rosemary’s Baby at Halloween,” Remus explained drily to Harry and Draco, “It’s a muggle horror movie.”
Draco had only seen Harry Potter twice since the incident with Bella and Rodolphus. The dark haired man would turn up at Madam Pomfrey’s office a little after Draco in order to siphon off some of his excess magical energy and feed it into Draco’s core.
Draco flushed and beamed before tapping at Harry’s biceps. “Why don’t you turn us over? You can lie down on the bed and I’ll be on top.”
Harry figured he must have drifted off at some point because the next thing he knew was Draco lightly shaking him awake. Harry blinked groggily, noticing that the fire had fully died down to just glowing embers. “What’s happening?” Harry sat up, immediately concerned something was wrong.
Harry crossed over to the large oak door, studded with iron nails and creaked it open. On the other side stood the Hogwarts headmistress, Professor McGonagall, looking extremely harassed.
The younger boy was fresh from the shower, Harry having insisted Draco warm up after they had returned from Hyde Park. Draco’s skin was still flushed pink and his slightly damp hair was stuck to his neck and forehead in places. Harry had offered to cast a drying spell, however after his accident, Draco had become very reticent about the idea of having spells aimed at him, even if Madam Pomfrey had assured him they were baby safe.
“He’s not a lout,” Draco rolled his eyes, “he’s just protective. It’s a good thing Uncle Sev, you should be happy I’ve found someone who loves me.”
“You know Draco got his mock NEWTS results back yesterday,” Hermione shifted on her uncomfortable looking chair that Madam Pomfrey had fished out of a cupboard.
Harry resumed his task with enthusiasm, Draco’s slick was like ambrosia feeding his own arousal until he felt like he might burst. Harry groaned as he laid himself down against the bed, allowing himself to rut against the friction the sheets provided, whilst continuing to eat Draco out. Harry’s thick tongue wiggled and thrust in and out of Draco’s hole whilst the omega squirmed and thrashed, trying to lift his hips back further, seeking his own mindless pleasure.
“Yes Ron,” Harry couldn’t help but laugh, “I happen to fancy the person I just asked to bond with me.”
“Y-You can turn around now,” Draco said after a minute. Harry hesitated before looking back into the room. Draco was now fully dressed in a navy corduroy smock with dark tights and blue plimsolls.
Draco felt his hackles rise, he was sure if Harry had actively been pursuing an omega then he would have told Draco by now.
Draco chewed on his lip before nodding, still averting his eyes as he rolled over. Harry had to help him slightly due to the weight of the baby bump. However, soon they found a comfortable enough position as Draco rested his head on his arms and tilted his hips so as to present his arse to Harry.
“Am I sick?” Draco asked, lifting up his small, slender hands to place them on his belly. “Is the baby okay?”
“Ah,” Harry’s face fell as he reached for a glass of pumpkin juice and gave it to Draco. “I’m guessing you still feel a bit too uncomfortable around me then?”
“No,” Draco replied, holding his breath as the mattress dipped heavily and the much larger alpha got into bed beside him. Draco couldn’t help the small strangled noise he let out when he realised that Harry had actually gotten in
“I don’t claim to understand what happened sixteen years ago,” Harry said carefully. “All I know is that my parents loved me and they died to protect me, and everybody else, from a genocidal maniac and they were successful in that endeavour. My godfathers adopted me and gave me the best childhood I could have hoped for and now I have a mate who couldn’t be more perfect if he tried and soon I’ll be a dad myself.” Harry paused for breath, “All I’ve learned today is that you were in love with my mother. Well, from what Sirius has told me, so was half of Hogwarts.”
Draco’s eyes opened momentarily, just enough for him to stare at Harry for a few seconds before he gave a tight nod. Harry toed off his socks before climbing into the bath and positioning himself behind Draco’s small frame. This way, Harry could wash off any smells that weren’t his own, comforting the other boy with his alpha presence, whilst making sure Draco didn’t fall unconscious.
“Watch it,” Harry snapped, shaking his head at his friend before glancing in concern back at Draco. “You okay?”
“Of course,” Draco declared, eyeing the suddenly very dark and expansive looking forest. “It will be fun.”
Draco reminded himself that he could currently be recovering from omega termination whilst facing criminal charges and the outraged ire of general wizarding society. Instead, he was warm and safe and, even if only for a little while, had Harry right beside him, offering to take care of him.
“Yes please,” Draco nodded, his cheeks were obviously red and he could see both Remus and Sirius looking at him with degrees of amusement.
“Draco?” Harry called out, opening the bathroom door in a cloud of steam. The older man was still clearly mid shower as there were shampoo bubbles in his hair and he had hastily wrapped a towel around his waist. “I could smell distress, what’s happening?”
“You’re an omega and a pregnant one at that so I highly doubt any one will have any complaints,” Hermione reassured him. “I’ll find you some clothes to change into and then we’ll sort out your burns okay?”
“Mrs. Lestrange is already on her way,” Professor McGonagall’s nose wrinkled up as if she had smelled something distasteful. Harry vaguely recognised the surname from the war history, guessing that, similar to the Malfoys, the Lestranges had been on the opposite side to his parents. “However, whilst Draco is technically with child, all decisions fall to the charge of his legal alpha, the other parent.” McGonagall spoke stiffly and awkwardly as a chill ran down Harry’s spine.
“She might be expecting Draco to turn up on Boxing Day with a mating bite though,” Ginny smirked as Harry groaned. “Honestly, apparently the other day Fred tried to tell her it wasn’t like that and she nearly yelled his ear off about how she knows you’re an upstanding young man and would never abandon a pregnant omega.”
“Someone who clearly wanted their wedding day ruined,” Harry muttered, shifting anxiously in his new dress shoes which felt altogether too tight. In fact, his entire suit felt too tight and he pulled the shirt collar away from his throat.
“Don’t be so hard on yourself,” Harry told him, “this is the first time you’re having to learn all of this stuff.” Harry took a deep breath, “Do you…do you want me to try and help?”
The four women stepped back to give Draco space enough to change, chatting pleasantly to each other about the upcoming winter celebrations down in Hogsmeade when the door slammed open again. The scent of alpha rapidly flooded the room with bonfire and cinnamon.
“Right,” Colum said, looking unconvinced. “Well I guess I’ll see you back inside then.” With that, the beta walked past Harry and back into the thrumming noise of the club. Harry groaned and leant against the nearest wall, hoping to Merlin no one had pissed on it recently, though in Camden that seemed unlikely.
“Just go talk to her,” Harry grinned, stroking the stubble on his chin. Ron and Hermione had been dating for four years now. However, recently Hermione had been floating around the idea of doing an internship with the U.S. Ministry of Magic after graduating.
“Yeah,” Sirius nodded, a little more softly now. He sat down on a nearby armchair, Draco absently noticed that it had a lever attached as if to turn it into a more reclined position. “We got on pretty well as kids. You can keep that photo if you want. I’ve got loads that I never look through.”
Harry tried not to snort, thinking of how Fleur’s omega cousin had regularly paraded around their holiday villa in hot pants and a bikini top. There was something so lovely about Draco’s excitement at the prospect of being ‘daring’ that Harry didn’t want to say anything to the contrary.
,” Harry insisted fiercely, leaning down to kiss Draco hard and encouraging so that when he drew back the omega was breathless and dazed.
Draco’s eyes wandered across the little symbols and drawings. There was an Igloo Café, an ice rink, various rides, a carousel, about a hundred food stalls, Santa’s Grotto, a Christmas tree maze that the others seemed rather keen on, a market area and so much more that Draco struggled to take it all in.
“Okay,” Harry shrugged, still not understanding where this was going. There were several omegas in the seventh year and Harry hadn’t made it his business to get to know many of them by name. The only ones he did know were because they had introduced themselves. Male omegas were rarer of course, tending to only herald from pureblood lineages. The name ‘Malfoy’ also vaguely rang a bell but not from any matters regarding Hogwarts.
“I do?” Draco asked, his eyes widening. It wasn’t unheard of for omegas to inherit one of their parents’ scents but it was quite unusual, especially if the child wasn’t raised by them.
Draco’s chest was puffed up with two small breasts crowned by rosy pink nipples. Just like below his right ear, there was a group of three small freckles on the swell of his right breast in a perfect constellation line.
Draco scrunched his eyes shut and tensed himself, feeling slightly disappointed as Harry let out an amused sigh and wrapped his arms around Draco’s middle, hugging him.
Draco knew that even though it was his first time it shouldn’t hurt due to his omega nature, unless of course the alpha was careless or overly rough. Harry however, was clearly taking his time to worship Draco’s body, seemingly more preoccupied with the omega’s pleasure than his own. It also always helped if the omega had already accepted the alpha’s scent and Draco knew he had fallen in love with Harry’s many months ago.
Draco rolled his eyes and wriggled further back in the chair to try and better support his aching back, “Harry says I’m p-probably richer than him, and when Remus’ legal petition goes through, I’ll get my full inheritance!”
.” Sirius pointed accusingly at Remus, “know full well you’re banned from my garage on account of knowing sod all about engineering and
Draco chewed on his lip as Harry fussed over creating a constellation of twinkling stars in the sky above the bells. Draco recognised the pattern as that of Canis Major, the Dog Star.
“F-Fine,” Draco nodded. “That was silly of me. I just wasn’t thinking and suddenly smelled an alpha, I forgot we were in public.”
“Merlin, no!” Harry shook his head quickly. “I’m not thinking of doing that.” He shivered, having heard nothing good from Percy Weasley about the way omegas were treated by the legal system.
“Hello little one,” Harry smiled softly, stroking the side of Draco’s face and vowing to get the younger boy in a soothing bubble bath as soon as they were able to move.
“I think I know h-how to get there,” Draco told them both, patting Harry in order to be gently put back down. Draco hurried over to the nearest wall of trees before touching one of the branches with his fingers. “Your friend Neville was doing the right thing!” Draco leaned in to the foliage before whispering.
“Harry,” Professor McGonagall began, jerking Harry’s attention back to her at the unusual use of his given name. “When we introduced the higher education programme at Hogwarts, we understood the implications of having a large number of adult students mingling with the younger cohorts.” McGonagall paused to levitate a pot of tea over to them, refilling her cup with something that smelled strongly of valerian, the calming root.
“I’m good,” Draco whispered back. Harry smiled in seemingly relief and began to engage Remus in a humorous conversation about Draco’s pickle cravings.
The younger boy remained asleep, his nose occasionally wrinkling and his breath warm and calm, but he was most definitely purring. Low and quiet against Harry’s chest, he could feel Draco’s throat vibrating. When a loud ringing went off and the purring stopped, Harry had a momentary urge to hurl his alarm into the bottom of the Great Lake.
The older man plunged his cock into Draco, harder and deeper each time. It was only when Draco opened his eyes again that he realised Harry had leaned down into him, their faces close together.
“Oh don’t be absurd,” the woman muttered, “what did I tell you Rodolphus? Omega hormones, that’s what it is. If you think, for one moment we’d let you swell with some mudblood knothead seed then you’re as stupid as your father was.”
“Yeah,” Harry pulled a contorted expression, “I can see why you wouldn’t get the best impression from her.”
Draco made a noise of protest as he felt someone gently pulling him away from Harry, however he relented when he realised it was Hermione. The beta woman hugged Draco against her side, her frizzy hair tickling his cheek as Draco turned to see Harry striding over to Smith, who had managed to stagger to his feet but with a bleeding nose.
Harry could smell the creamy sweet scent again, emanating from Draco’s chest. Although the padded bralettes had arrived from Amberly’s in the post, it was still more comfortable for Draco to sleep without them. Harry had assured the omega that he shouldn’t be embarrassed about leaking overnight and had made certain that he never stared too long at Draco’s occasionally damp chest.
“You done in there?” the woman’s voice called out as Harry and Draco jerked apart as if burned. Draco remained kneeling on the snowy ground for a few moments before he felt Harry’s hands gently help him up to his feet.
Hermione frowned, reaching over to gently lay the back of her hand against Draco’s cheek. “He doesn’t normally feel too much warmer than this actually,” she said. “I think omegas run cold, especially during pregnancy when they are directing most of their body heat towards the baby.”
“So thoughtful, your alpha,” Katie whispered to Draco, the omega flushed, glancing up at Harry shyly with a pleased expression.
“Yes, Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall levelled him with an unimpressed glare. “I think you should.”
“Right,” Severus snapped loudly a moment later, clearly back to his old self. “I’m about to mix hydra bile and giant’s toe so unless you want to turn up to your wedding ceremony bald, I suggest you leave me to work in peace.”
“So who raised you then?” Sirius asked, crossing his legs and putting his clunky boots up on the expensive looking coffee table. “I know it wasn’t Andromeda.” Upon noticing Draco’s confusion, Sirius gestured back to the picture. “Andromeda Tonks, née Black. She’s your aunt.”
“Awfully young though isn’t he,” Muriel pulled a face, “I never agreed with that Higher Education programme at Hogwarts you know, embarrassments like this were bound to happen. Makes you wonder how many of these ‘indiscretions’ that McGonagall woman sweeps under the carpet.”
“Here,” Katie smiled as she sat up on the bed next to Draco and interlocked her fingers with his, “squeeze me if it hurts.”
Draco had offered to tell people about the spell but Professor McGonagall had swiftly shut him down. Insisting that it could be dangerous for Harry if that information were to get out, not to mention that Draco would be arrested.
“Like the great Harry Potter hasn’t got a seventeen year old omega up the duff?” Harry asked wryly, lifting an eyebrow.
Twenty minutes later, Draco walked into the Great Hall wearing stretchy emerald green leggings and a large blue cashmere jumper that comfortably covered his bump and grazed the top of his thighs. The collar and cuffs had embroidered patterns of ivy with little sewn in pearls and Draco had chosen dark green socks with shiny leather, round toed shoes, a thick strap going over the top of his feet and feeding into a silver buckle.
Harry vaguely recognised the boy, he was pretty sure he had helped the omega a month or so ago in one of the school corridors. But apart from that, Harry was certain he hadn’t interacted with this omega in any other capacity, definitely not one that would get him
“This…is for me?” Draco blinked, looking up at Harry who was still frowning down at him before the alpha’s face relaxed.
Whilst not threatening enough to warrant Draco’s transfer to the Hospital Wing, Sweetbridge had given them detailed instructions on how to control his temperature, an ice bath being one of them. Apparently the fever was the body’s reaction to when the omega would normally have been going into heat. She also mentioned that Draco’s symptoms might evolve or change, anything from disorientation to arousal. Harry had begged the heavens that he wouldn’t have to deal with the last thing.
The boy then took a tentative step closer to Hagrid as he stood up from a crouch. Hagrid nearly grimaced when he saw how deep the cut actually was from this angle. He made a beckoning motion with his arms and the boy continued the few paces between then tentatively. The boy hissed as he walked, the cut obviously nipping him.
He leapt from Hagrid’s arms as approached a horrified Severus with a swiftness that seemed magical. It was starling to see Snape laugh uncontrollably
’ Severus asked incredulously as he picked twigs out of his hair, spluttering as if she’d gone mad – or he had already. ‘Minnie, the boy is a bloody
It had been Lupin who’d spied the little one first and quietly pointed to where he was perched on one of the higher branches of great oak. They had all stared at the boy for a few beats in shock as the child stared out into the distance. Hagrid was thinking the poor boy looked a bit forlorn when Snape had decided in his wisdom to shoot the boy with a
It was then that Draco stopped staring at his now diseased hands and inched his head up to look at Severus’ expression.
Hagrid was a comfort throughout the walk to Albus’ rooms. The fact that these people had multiple rooms boggled the mind.
deep. He knew the enclosure was just over the little incline in front of him. But it was with shaky legs and a voice in his head whispering
‘Here, here.’ Stickes agreed, feeling that everything around him had finally cracked and the coo-coo’s were out the nest today.
After that, new life had clambered in the belly of the forest, constantly stretching outwards. The area which Hagrid had first visited was now impossibly larger, as was the life within it. Odd new plants sprung up, peculiar animals Hagrid had never seen nor heard of grazed and scuttered around him.
The forest enveloped him in darkness and embraced him into its shadows. He was mist, and peaty fog crawling over the forest bed.
Then Stickes hear the tell tale sounds of the Obliviator Squad from the floor below them. Stickes and Stone shared a knowing look and both men sneered at Cross.
Severus’ expression turned dark and made as if to start shouting at him before he took in Draco’s slumped shoulder and furrowed brow.
He stared at it frozen, not understanding what he was looking at. His mind could not wrap around the notion of there being something beyond the Forest. It was his world, the only thing he’d known.
A slow hiss sounded between Harry’s teeth, a chance to run for creatures who knew to take it as a warning. The smaller creatures heeded his call, the predators watched – waiting to see if he failed.
Like a frightened animal, Draco’s head snapped to where he last saw the boy. In that space, there was a small bowl discarded, its contents spilled to the floor.
‘Nothing so simple.’ Albus finally settled on, too far gone to explain this experience, his typically extensive grasp of words and theorem were muted by it. ‘He isn’t merely searching for a translation, he’s reshuffling his mind to
‘Probably. He is your kin, in a fashion.’ Colther turned South as if scenting them before he shook his head worriedly. ‘They don’t ever travel this deep. Often those who do are either lost or hiding and tend to be picked off quickly. Though it is curious why it was feeding on the pure beast.’ Colther inclined his head to the dead mare, its silver blood shining over its belly.
Hagrid had sniffled then grunted angrily at the third body he’d found – this one was much deeper in the forest. It had died painfully; bite marks, welts and bruises littered is neck – most of which was missing, like the beast had fed on the flesh too.
‘We can ‘elp yeh'.’ Hagrid nodded to his side again, trying rip his eyes away from the swirling marks. ‘After we've said our sorry’s first, of course.’
‘I can’t be sure.’ Colther grumbled. ‘All we know is that he’s a friend of the Forest, even though he’s aligned with the others the Forest doesn’t permit. But that doesn’t mean he is
’ between swats, Harry climbed, crawled and shuffled all around Snape and his robes. Albus was beside himself, clapping like a child would at the comical sight of Snape being inspected by the curious, clambering lad.
As Hagrid started to enthusiastically explain Hogwarts to Harry, who was straining to understand his accent, Dumbledore, Lupin, and Snape walked behind them.
‘You don’t need to see this. Go. Go home to Sheila and the girls.’ Stickes sounded like a Muggle robot.
‘Terribly so.’ Albus agreed. ‘I am not envious of your situation, Harry. There will be a lot to earn, most of it basic.’ Albus nodded to himself.
It was the hoot of an owl behind him that made Draco jump out of his skin. Then it was the snap of a branch that echoed loudly around the small clearing.
‘Sch-ool, ma-gic, wiz-ard.’ The boy spoke without harsh sonant, his eyes closed tightly and eyelids flickering rapidly. He spoke as if he each word had a flavour and he was tasting them on his tongue.
He slowly walked back into the nursery, his wand in hand, the tip always glowing green. Each step felt like a thousand, he feet were leaden and numb.
Stickes had lost his son. Like Jim it was nothing glamourous but it was horrifically quick. Cot death, the Healer had explained calmly to him and his sobbing now ex-wife. Little Andrew just fell asleep and didn’t wake back up again. There was nothing they could have done.
Hagrid felt the familiar puff of pride. Albus always treated Hagrid like an equal, even if the half-giant didn’t think he’d deserved it.
Stickes took a breath. ‘Avade Ke-.’ Then the boy moved, he flinched at the green light. Then he was reaching out between the bars of his cot in a panic. Moving and straining his little limbs in order to touch his mother and father. The boy grunted softly, trying to reach them and missing his mothers head by mere millimetres.
After climbing down, slowly, the corridor started to brighten again. Moving around another corridor then revealed an arced, wooden door covered with moths. At either side of the door were other paths. Peering down them both, he noticed that neither of them were lit.
‘Ah, Stickes and Stone – my favourite dynamic duo, beautiful mornin’ eh?’ Cross beamed like a fucking spotlight.
Though, as Draco began to voice his grievances with Dumbledore’s lax duty of care policies and ask more targeted questions about what he might have seen in the Forest, Draco noticed that he was being pointedly
‘You?’ Harry asked, a tone of danger which belied his years coloured his voice. ‘It smelled like that, only stronger.’ Harry was now baring his teeth. ‘Did you drink from them too?’ His questions shot from him like bullets as he stepped forward threateningly. ‘Did you hurt them too?’
It was too much for Stone. He could only shake his head and back away from Stickes like the man sickened him.
Firenze was right, Jonah was sodden with guilt towards the boy. It was probably the natural reaction when one left children in this forest.
‘Is unusual, yes.’ Albus interrupted. ‘But not indicative of moral fiber. He was a babe, he is a child.’
People spoke their feelings; those emotions coloured their voices. But those sounds did not always match what was happening within them. They held secrets within them, so many false pieces to save themselves, to remain unburdened by not becoming a burden.
Albus nodded when the boy turned to him again. ‘Your magic is a little different to ours Harry – it always has been.’
‘It’s a bit chilly.’ She said to the group. ‘-and it’s getting dark.’ She pointed to the horizon. ‘Shall we continue this in the castle?’ She turned to look between Harry and Albus. ‘You are more than welcome to join us Harry – unless anyone is expecting you?’
Again, oddly enough, Draco found himself marched out of Severus’ private labs, only this time he was told quite firmly to go make himself useful some place else.
He whispered to them like the huge beast would, trying to calm them. The sickly mare had even kicked back when he first touched it, but Harry trudged on with a bruised stomach and gentler touches, determined to stop that awful look off of the huge creature’s face.
‘Subtle my friend. Some might say you’re losing your touch.’ He grinned, his chest now tonnes lighter.
The shadows slid across Draco’s skin as he inched forward to get a better look. The tree that stood with him on the top of that small hill offered him a perch from which he could spy uninhibited.
Next thing Draco knew, he was on his arse outside the Severus’ quarters and the door was slammed shut behind him.
Snape levelled another bizarre look at him. Perhaps the man was confused, and he’d never been hunting?
The boy then smiled and flicked his wrist. Suddenly, thick vines crept from the ground, blackened and looming over them all.
of Harry’s wrist, the earth then flew on top of the shrieking creature, capturing its weak legs, dragging, crushing and burying him.
The forest floor was teaming with life here. Deciduous trees thrived and bore fruit, others flowered, and all stood tall
The young couple were on the floor of the nursery, staring up at the ceiling. Their bloated skin was already putrefying, and the maggots were getting a meal. Scorch marks and rippling black magic coated the floors and walls, as did some of their now scabby blood.
The two ragged Aurors made their way into the cottage. Once they passed the muggle-repelling charms, both of them soon woke up properly. Their wands were instinctively unholstered, though neither were raised – two decades on the job meant protocol and crime scene safety were instinctive too at the point.
when the boy suddenly clambered up his tall frame before perching on his shoulders. Hagrid tilted his head back and saw green eyes staring back at him with a blinding smile.
The boy seemed to do the same to him, searching Hagrid’s face until he found something that seemed to calm him. He reached out to Hagrid, his eyes still flicking over everything like hummingbird wings.
In times of War, many people often went missing in the name of Magical Security. Stickes never thought it would happen to him, they were just rumours. But now it was his unavoidable reality.
Albus looked at the concentric rings again, utterly fascinated. Hagrid knew Albus could feel the magic in it, Hagrid could too. The old magic, deep in the roots and soil. Such old magic that it was rare nowadays. That only made the whole thing more curious.
He had happened on the first when he was collecting feathers for his arrows and Harry had happened on an egg nest - the ground had suddenly started shaking.
Colther snorted when they tried to herd them; the young ones were swift, and the winged ones were more than a little snappish when Harry tried to near them. He ran and dived after them, falling and slipping in mud branches and huffing in frustration. Harry rushed at them, using his slightly larger frame and arms to swoop them up before tying a length of soft cord around their necks.
‘Well, Harry. That was quite impressive. Though, I must apologise for what happened earlier – we are very sorry we startled you.’ Albus watched Harry, assessing if he had followed what he’d said.
Draco swallowed worriedly. He hadn’t been serious when he said he feared for his life after seeing the demon-spirit thingy, but if Severus was concerned…
‘I am – fine. Hagrid healed it.’ Distracted, he rubbed a hand along the red fabrics on his side, dyed darker from the cut. The boy then looked around Albus. ‘Hello Hagrid – I – I have wanted to say that for a while now.’ He announced with an odd unaccented voice. It was monotonous and indicative of someone who hadn’t yet learned to connect speech with their feelings or thoughts.
It spoke a tongue that Harry didn’t understand, but its body communicated enough; it was shocked, then enraged and murderous.
‘Impossible.’ He’d said before charging off to collect his samples. His arms and bags were full by the time he’d gotten his fill, his cheeks were oddly flushed as Hagrid guided him back to the castle. Snape moved so quickly that even Hagrid had to lengthen his strides.
And it wasn’t simply the age old ‘innocence of babes’ that fuelled that intuition, no – it was more of an educated guess afforded to him by his liaisons with the Potters.
It was magic that should have been beyond his age and stage, but neither of his parents had been a stickler for Ministry rules when it came to underage magic. Thus, Draco knew far more about specific pieces of magic – namely those that would impress the guest at the gala his parents threw.
Harry’s eye looked up and caught a flash of red and black, the elderberries were higher up this season. He groaned and placed the bowl down.
He looked right in the boy’s eyes then, holding them like he would with any creature that had its hackles risen. Hagrid then held his hands up, showing the boy that he was defenseless, that he wasn’t going to harm the boy.
They followed cross up the carpeted stairs. As the arrived nearer the nursery, the air thickened, and the stench rose.
‘How could they- I mean you of all people too. Fucking cunts!’ Stone kicked a small table down the stairs, the crash sounds as if in slow motion to Stickes sluggish sentences.
There had been a bad thunderstorm and the Hippogriff and Thestral’s enclosure had been torn down. A few of the younglings had gotten lost in the chaos of it all. Hagrid had been sweating trying to find them. He’d been crestfallen when after two days they’d remained lost; their mother’s still moaning for them with heart-breaking calls.
‘Don’t listen to that mean old bat.’ She said to the young lad whilst the boy was playing with a ball of yarn from her pocket, pinching his cheeks lightly. ‘He has no sense, it’s all those potion fumes I tell you.’ She said before totaling a pointed glare over her shoulder at a now purple Potions Master.
After that Lupin dismissed him, telling Harry he could spend the next couple of hours at his leisure – as long as he did so within these new rules. He was meant to meet with the Headmaster again tonight, and Harry would be lying if he said he didn’t have serious questions.
There was a small pause and a strange look on the boy’s face, as if it were taking a considerable effort to dissect the words.
After learning a creature’s language, Harry learned a bit about them. He could tell what snakes like Colther liked to eat or how the ground felt beneath their bellies when they were full. He knew that wolves thought of their family almost constantly, they moved and breathed as a group, and never solitary thing. He learned that centaurs thought in circles of
‘It’s for your babes…and you.’ Harry smiled at the mare. ‘I’ve plenty back home. Might bring more if the hunt’s fair before the frost.’
He could sense it. And for a moment, a blink, he felt off-kilter. He knew then that whatever this was like him and his mother, the forest – but so awfully different at the same time. His gooseflesh was a testament to that.
It was one of the more hair-raising sights Draco had witnessed and it led him to the horrid thought that the boy might have been bitten on a full moon.
‘Was.’ Albus nodded. ‘You have what we call Wild Magic – or Old Wild. It presents in a few people every so often. It’s terribly powerful, and thus can be difficult for young people to wield with any sort of success. Though, I suspect because of your upbringing, you are leaps and bounds beyond those who are more like you - and your peers who are less so.’
Harry bit his lip as he stared forward unseeingly from his treetop perch. He wanted to know Hagrid with his soft noises and the gentle way he treated everything. Before Hagrid, Harry hadn’t really seen behaviour like it except maybe what he’d seen happen between wolves and their cubs.
Harry was on his haunches again. He motioned for Colther and the wolves to make themselves scarce. His eyes stared north-west, the sound of the footfalls were ridiculously loud. It was calling out to something, its voice high pitched and panicking.
‘I should think so.’ Albus nodded as he moved to open a trunk, and then a wardrobe and set of drawers. ‘Your magic is a little different, but not so much so that you cannot cast illusions if you wish.’
Cross nodded slowly then looked over his shoulder. ‘You should come see – makes more sense once you do.’
a good morning.’ Stone answered, and thank god cause Stickes was far beyond pleasantries at the moment.
Harry had tried to follow the scent the afternoon before Albus and the other professors had found him. It had led back to the castle and with it, he’s footsteps similar in size and gait as his own.
Cross exhaled sharply, like an animal backed into a corner. ‘You don’t? Then you’ll be charged and let go.’ Cross threatened.
The Aurors and their assistants were used to this now, gallows humour and grim smiles all round. The Potter being fairly well known just made those smiles a little more grim than usual – it was always easier to bury a complete stranger than someone who’s name your already heard.
‘I will care for him until he can stand on his own two feet, as you humans put it.’ Firenze smiled, rocking the infant slightly. ‘Harry Potter will be a great man. One day you will realise you’ve done the right thing, do not feel as if you are abandoning him – that is if you choose to not forget.’
With his heart in his mouth and sweat on his palms, Draco steeled himself and pushed forward. He reasoned that he survived the Forest before, and that he was not going in
Harry didn’t allow himself to be stunned. He simply followed. Raising his hands, he swept the decaying matter on the forest floor between them and shifted its form into pointed, creeping vines. The sharp ends were then sent out, flying forward with a twist of Harry’s wrist.
from the thing it kept tight in its right hand. It slashed, severed, and slit at Harry’s gnarled, blackened vines. Its breaths were laboured and wet sounding.
The creature snapped some of the vines, but Harry kept hurling more forward. It’s grunts and growls increased sharply when Harry pushed it back, the vine never relented because Harry didn’t. They all reached out to the creature like clawed hands seeking to maim and poison.
Lupin was also a werewolf, though he hid it well. Stranger still was that Lupin’s wolf seemed to know Harry, if the scent of
Albus thought it sounded almost like a question, so he nodded at those curious eyes. He hoped the boy understood his affirmation – that and he hoped he hadn’t just agreed to anything
‘Probably because we are the only ones who wouldn’t run away screaming – plus the fact neither of us are in a position of authority to pass it on like the cunt Cross is.’ Stone said mockingly.
As Relga hiccupped and belched after a particularly long swig, Draco inched the door open and slowly made his was outside into the cold, brisk night.
He nearly broke one when he heard the creature return; Harry hightailed it out of there without letting it seeing him.
So engrossed in the task, Harry hadn’t heard the creature arrive behind him. He didn’t have a clue he had company until the thing whimpered in shock.
But all those thoughts stuttered to a halt when he saw the boy bend down to the bucket, peer left to right, and then pull of the red cloth that covered his torso.
This informed Draco’s second serious question – why was Severus, his typically attentive friend of the family, snubbing him?
Covered in shadow, Harry could see the boys shake their heads and Draco stare at the spot Harry had just jerked back from. For a moment it looked like he was staring straight at Harry before he frowned, shook his head and then made to leave the bedroom.
He breathed a sigh of relief when he crested the hill and saw roughly twenty mares all mowing about within a fence of rough woven dark wood.  With a furrowed brow, he noted that he hadn’t heard his professors yet, despite having listened in on their plan earlier that day stating they’d be here.
The hairy creature made distressed noises whispered into the ears of the mares, trying to offer small comforts to ease their pains. Its massive hands shook went he petted at the too thin Unicorn, which was curled up on the ground, its breaths laboured, its leg clearly broken and bent at an awful angle.
Harry then nodded as he agreed with the entire concept of a bed – mattress, duvet, pillows, sheets, and all.
Harry hunched low in the tall grass, his face markings diffusing his outline to the unsuspecting outsider. The wolf pack, all seven of them, sank low and prowled through the dry earth with him.
Nodding to himself, he completely missed Nott, Crabbe and Goyle’s calls from the common room couches. Now in his dorm, he committed himself to a brilliant plan; wait until everyone was asleep, sneak out to the Forbidden Forest, hide out at the Hippogriff enclosure, and then confront the ugly, shy, dark spirit demon.
‘Come to watch me stew Albus?’ Severus slurred from an armchair. It was nearly pitch in the room, except for the dwindling light of the hearth.
His eyes roved over the bed and the drawer beside it. With a small smile he carefully opened each drawer in turn, the first few held clothes, others had small knick-knacks and object Harry hadn’t a name for yet.
Harry took it and pushed back his sleeve. The boy stared at the Dark Mark as it was revealed, the symbol was greying, but still swallowed all the light around it.
After he had entered the castle once more, Draco had halted in front of Severus’ rooms. He wondered if he should tell the Professor about what he had seen. He shook his head and continued to his dorm; it was late, and he didn’t want to have to explain himself. Draco’s covetous nature wanted to keep the whole encounter secret.
Draco could have whooped as he ran from the exit, through the grassy banks of the Hogwarts grounds until he neared the shadowy edge of the Forbidden Forest.
‘Big bad men want me to kill you.’ He admitted. ‘But I won’t.’ He whispered. ‘You remind me too much of my wee Andrew.’ Another sob choked him. ‘And I cannae’ watch another babe die in their cot.’
‘The Prophet won’t know. No one will. Fudge’s already speaking to executives and editors and all that rot. Comes under Magical Security and with one whiff of its magical signature the Wizengamot were gave its full support.’ He seemed to pale further as he explained. Cross clearly hadn’t thought much beyond the potential threat and the need to neutralise it.
was he there at all? Like all simple questions, they have quite straightforward answers; Dumbledore is an incompetent fool who surrounds himself with even more inept minions.
Harry could hear the creatures approaching, their colourful power lighting up the darkness between the trees. He could hear Hagrid bellowing and the loud thumps of his footfalls and bellow shouts.
Severus was holding a vial with gloved hands. With am extremely steady hand, the Potions Master was extracting flakes of something from the bottom of the glass with a set of comically long tweezers. Draco peeked over Severus’ shoulder and spied four more vials, all filled with the same flaky substance, only these were coloured differently from the first and each other.
‘Keep me posted if anything else crops up, let us hope it doesn’t.’ Albus exited quickly, murmuring.
It was with careful, quiet steps that Draco made his way from his bed, down to the common room, past the dormitory portrait, through the dungeon corridors and up the winding stairs to the small door.
Albus suspected he looked somewhat like Snape and Lupin did then - tense, pale, and a little haunted.
‘Thank you.’ Jonah said loudly, any quitter and his voice would have warbled. ‘I need to go back. They think he’s dead.’
it.' The boy wrung his hands and eyed Hagrid's bow as if he should do something with it and preferably soon.
The three watched Minerva translate Hagrid's enthusiastic detailing of the Hogwarts Greenhouses before the boy touched Hagrid's temple. Harry now spoke a strange mix of Dumbledore's polite tone and Hagrids rowdy bubbling.
Harry trailed it until the trees of the Forest started thinning, so much further East than he ever traveled before. Hesitating, Harry stopped following for a few beats; it was far too open here, and these parts of the woods were dark and felt too still.
One morning Harry woke up to bleating Thestral colts and winged, beaked foals he had no name for after a night of battering winds. This time the hooved beasts were young and clearly lost; they had meandered up to Harry’s hut calling out to their mother’s.
But the hairy creature never used his, even though Harry could smell it on him; a light musky scent that spoke of home, hearth and happiness. Instead he befriended the Forest’s children and nurtured them without hesitation.
Albus moved swiftly forward with a spring in his step that belied his age. The two men behind him looked on worriedly.
But he needed to endure, tonight was the big hunt. Soon the warm, sunny evenings – no matter how unbearable – would give over to the barren cold of winter. Harry only had a small window to work with; he needed to begin hunting and foraging early enough when the bounty was still plentiful and late enough in Summer that the meat and fruits would last the winter once he cured and cried them.
one was searching for its kin. They both smelled similarly awful, like they had been in close contact for a long time.
Harry stretched and took note of the suns position as Colther snapped at the wolf circling him. ‘Well, that was enough excitement for one day I think.’
Hagrid carefully took out some healing balm Poppy had gifted them all for this trip. The boy tracked his movements as Hagrid kept pointing to the wound.
‘Bedtime, I think.’ Albus smiled as he waved towards the bed. ‘I will be in my office, or chambers. Both are up the stairs outside the door. Call on me if you have any questions, otherwise I’ll meet you here in the morning before breakfast.’
‘We can’t move him. He won’t let us.’ Cross interrupted. ‘Two Aurors are already at St. Mungos and Bagshot barely dodged when she tried too – not to mention the Healers.’
Harry stayed on his haunches as the ice-white creature lifted a long piece of shining wood – just like the creatures Harry fought before had done.
‘No.’ He said gently. ‘But we knew your parents when they were still alive.’ Albus thought it was almost cruel to tell the boy so quickly that his parents had not lived – but lies and deceit were quick butchers of good faith, and that was what he needed from the boy then. To trust them.
With his heart in his mouth, Harry backed behind the wooden door a little more before sitting on the dusty floor.
Severus shook his head before leaving Albus and the hearth, a few minutes later a door slammed shut.
‘We would prefer it if you came with us.’ Minerva stated gently. ‘The castle is safer than the Forest.’ She then titled her head. ‘If you like it, you could stay with us there.’
‘Then why wont you let me lend my service to something as important as this, Severus?’ Draco griped at the door…quietly.
The stream never looked so attractive. The glistening water promised to be cool against his over-heated, sweating skin. Shaded by heavy trees and guarded by high boulders, Harry stripped off his threadbare cloths, their orange-red dye bright against the brown green of thirsty grass.
Then the creature cast a strange smoke from the branch in his hand. Harry could sense the poison it had created, and he threw air at it with a dismissive gesture.
But there it was, still laying on its side as it had been for a couple of weeks now. Though now, it had orange sludge and threadbare fabric wrapped around its leg staved with an oddly straight piece of dead wood. What was even more curious it that when Hagrid had checked on them last night there was none of this. And to his disbelief he found a small green hand print on the young mares hide.
Before leaving, Harry thought what it might have been like to have had this. To have grown up around boys like Draco, with a family, and friends. It wasn’t until he’d for others like himself that he’s known how terribly lonely he was. How much he needed to speak to others like him, people who thought like him. A snake and a pack of wolves were poor replacements for what he’d found here. The animal’s lives were straightforward and small, and Harry felt like his life till now had been terribly small too.
Harry’s eyes snapped to the left and he bared his teeth in a strange grin. He looked over and a strange giddiness overtook him; manic, gleeful impatience.
He could look away from time to time. Like right now, he was staring at the sliver of sky between the break in the never-ending cover of pine, ash, fir, and spruce. The cloud rolling up above gave him the sensation of moving, when felt in tandem with the rolling current around him it calmed the deeper parts of his mind, but tension prickled at his muscles forcing him to stand to shake the feeling off.
‘There’s sets of prints.’ Hagrid said as his mind was turning over what he’d learned these past months. ‘They’re difficult to track – might get abou’ forty paces before they simply stop, as if th’ thing making them disappeared.’
Something had been hunting the Unicorns, some of the carcasses he’d found not thirty paces from his cabin.
‘Do people live in the Forest?’ Draco asked Severus absentmindedly as he stared into the fire from his favourite overstuffed armchair.
What was even more exasperating was trying to get them back to the herd near the massive creature’s hut. Colther, being unusually helpful, recommended meat as a lure. Hence, Harry was then found carrying a deer carcass, followed by a screed of wobbly legged foals each trying to steal from him with fluttering wings and small nips. Harry smiled back at them after he warned them off. Covered with twigs, drying mud and now deer blood, Harry guided them through brook and glen until he arrived at the rickety enclosure.
But then the thought of returning to the forest where he would be largely alone again made him curl in on himself.
‘Do you think he’d attack us?’ Harry asked the snake in a small voice as they lay within a burrow of blankets and hay in the corner of the hut.
Again, Snape did not answer him. He was too engrossed in whatever it was that he was analysing. He did so with an intensity that suggested the substance would solve all of Severus’ problems and woes. Or maybe make him fantastically rich in the process.
But luck was on his side tonight, the forest did not take kindly to loud intruders -not even infants.
‘That is brilliant Harry. Really! Almost all magical children struggle with transfiguration, never mind attempting to accomplish it wandlessly!’
he found an old marker. He looked up and saw no break in the trees, no sunlight could have chanced through here to help it grow.
Dumbledore then left his chambers and descended into the dungeons. The castle was eerie and too still, as if it mourned too.
‘Here you go wee’an.’ He crouched down with the boy in tow. ‘Say bu-bye to mummy and daddy.’ The wee one reached down and put his hand on his mums face and then made a happy gurgling sound. Stickes put him on the ground and he watched to boy move and trip slight to his dad too, he touched his dad forehead with his and patted him a little strongly.
Then a twig snapped behind them and the boy stilled a little, his attention returned to the other three Wizard’s behind them, the strange marks flooding his eye’s in a band from ear to ear.
Now at eye level he could see the crust from spilled tears on the babes face, the dirt and soot covered the rest. There was no way this kid killed his parents, if he did it was an accident.
Harry had been tending to a female Unicorn who’d ate the leaves off some sort of nightshade vegetable. Her stallion budged at Harry as he had fed her a thin, minty reed water to calm her stomach. He whined until Harry huffed and petted him, letting him smell the concoction.
despite there being hardly any sunlight for them to grow to such heights. Small animals flurried and frenzied away from Hagrid, the noise of them all surprising him after miles and miles of too-quiet and too-tense. There was fungi and flowers that Hagrid had never seen before, big blooms and heady scents wafted towards him, making him sneeze on more than one occasion.
‘It is an illusion.’ Albus offered. ‘Rooms without windows can feel a little constraining and oppressive, I’ve found.’
The snake sniffed. ‘Because I keep you on your toes, if I left you with those damned wolves all of the time you might get fleas.’
Draco was in bed by six that night, so overcome with excitement that he got under the covers with his shoes still on. He waited. Waited. Then waited some more for his friends to come to bed and start snoring. He was quickly realising that he might have got some homework done instead when his wand started to wiggle, alerting him that it was time to set his plan in motion.
The forest opened behind the creature, ivy vine snagging its feet and it tumbled back with a guttural yelp. It landed on all fours, which Harry could admire.
The boy was there again. At the sight of him, Draco grinned and let a gasped silent laugh escape him.
And this was no different. He shadowed the beast and spied on him most days. Every time getting closer and, on a few occasions, nearly getting caught.
‘Good!’ Lupin beamed. ‘Well, that’s one less hurdle to worry about.’ He then stood again before pointing at one of the first pages, at a particular spell.
He did not breathe as he watched the small creature pad towards the hippogriffs and unicorns. It was wide eyes that he took in how the sprit in front of him wasn’t a spirit at all, how instead it was a small boy, his age with red cloth wrapped around him and black marks all over his pale skin.
‘Maybe – however it was powerful. The first I mean, not so much the second.’ Colther contemplated aloud.
Over the next few days, the creature did his rounds and when he found the new carcasses Harry had left for the somewhat bloodthirsty mares, he searched the ground more intently; looking at Harry’s footprints with a furrowed brow when he found them.

The creature stared at him, seemingly in shock. Harry wanted to stare back, but then it was raising that branch in his hand again, the one the dancing light flew from. A bright green spark flitted by Harry’s head after he gently side stepped its course.

Draco had wanted to follow the boy in but cursed his own cowardice for how frozen his feet were then.
So, it wasn’t a surprise that the Potter’s had decomposed slightly before they were found by a concerned neighbour; Bathilda Bagshot funnily enough.
