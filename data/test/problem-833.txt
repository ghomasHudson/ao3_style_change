Hermione's figure, as if struck by lightning, instantly flew back. Horror was clear in her eyes as the fog of intoxication cleared from her head and she looked at the sleeping figure.
Remembering the things he had seen and experienced  , Draco's face sank and his eyes lost the remaining light . He said in an emotionless voice ," What's  your purpose ? It's not like you can help for free ."
Draco didn't even notice the deadly gleam in those eyes. At that moment , Harry's eyes looked similar to a snake eyeing its prey. Just like a snake lying in ambush , poison ready in it's fangs as it waited for an opportunity to attack. Waiting for a chance to capture in first strike and swallow the delicacy alive and whole as it withered and shivered.
In the haze of tiredness and slumber, Draco heard a deep voice whisper to him, "...Wait~ ....Just wait~"
Pansy was speechless with rage, "Y-you ! You filthy mutt! Don't touch Draco!"
With this, Neville staggered out of bed with angry steps and promptly turned towards the door.
Smirking slightly , Harry slowly dropped one of his hands down as he watched Malfoy's eyes warily following it . Slowly closing it just beside Draco's waist , he smirked as Draco looked up to give him a burning glare before returning his eyes on the hand .
Gasps echoed from the boys when their gaze met with the miraculous sight.
Draco steadily planted one hand on Harry's chest and the other on eggie. His magic spread around encompassing the three in gentle blue-green light as it glided into their bodies.
But ... how ?
- Harry obtained memory from Slughorn.
Draco's calm voice quietly sounded, "Balliski venom"
" The egg is probably of a bird or reptile but the size indicates it being of a larger species . Can you assess it again ?"
As Harry continued, Draco leaned forward to take the letter . Reading it, a frown marked his forehead .
Getting down, Harry quickly helped Draco down . As the bus departed again, they started walking through the hustle and crowd. The synonymous look and architecture of metropolitan houses passing by from the corner of their eyes .
" Borgin and Burkes . I formed a passage "
Draco had enough . His eyes held anger . They held cold anger. His hand fisted and closed tight.
Roaming his eyes over the hall , Harry's eyes rested on Draco who was silently eating his food with bags beneath his eyes , looking a bit less perfect and bit more human .
Some dozen steps after, Harry caught the sight of a ruined wooden cottage. From its ruins, it can be said to be destroyed by a fire. But Harry, who is a wizard, clearly understood that it was magic rather than fire that destroyed it. In a daze, Harry didn't notice when his own steps stopped in front of the ruined cottage.
Harry's throat bobbed up and down as he gulped , thinking of his teeth sinking in the Draco's throat .
" Nothing much. Parkinson and Nott are on their way and Hermione must be out as well. Ron might take longer because of the wedding "
Groggily sitting up, he innocently rubbed his eyes and yawned as a soothing voice said in the background , " Still sleepy? Why don't you sleep more ? I will wake you up" before gently drawing him back down again.
He was so angry that the food lost its taste . Finding no meaning in staying anymore , he got up to leave . Walking out of the great hall and making his way towards the Slytherin dormitories for a good night's sleep.
Throwing this matter behind, she worriedly looked at Draco, "It's fine. How is he?"
" Well, that is true " , The assured voice said .
Ahhhh!!! Eithu !!!!
, Harry mused as his eyes turned an unfathomable shade .
As soon as the sound reached Harry's ears, his wand rose swiftly firing two spells in fast successions.
"You are still inside the castle. So why can't I ? "
Eggie's shell had a small crack but sensing that the body inside of the egg didn't have any harm and was actively sucking his magic, Draco was particularly relieved and lifted his hand from the shell. Now, his entire attention was on Harry.
He could feel Luar's magic in his body. The gentle magic swirled in his body searching for the dark magic embedded in him by the dark lord. He soon found a small wisp of dark amake swirling in Draco's blood. The wisp soon noticed him as he came near and flexibly escaped as the blue threads of Luar's magic chased it.
Seeing the look of pure admiration directed towards him , Luar felt like he was swimming in honey.  Sweet , sweet honey ! Even sweeter that sweet - no , the sweetest Draco !!!! OHHH , His old heart couldn't bear this . He felt that with this look the possibility of a second death was not too less !!!
Harry readily fired spells one after the other as more and more wounds were obvious on the snake's skin. Soon, the snake was heavily injured and they found an opening to escape. Just as Harry raised his wand, the snake frantically started to thrash it's tail around, throwing bricks and ruins of the room towards them. It was as if it knew that they were going to escape.
The bloody pit in the flesh and muscles on Harry's shoulder was deep enough to show bones. The bleeding didn't stop and the poison was constantly spreading in his bloodstream.
Even then - even then he did his best. Made deliberate mistakes to face lashes, lied to face crucio, failed missions to face torture - all of it to save one man. How stupid was he to think it would be fine as long as Harry was safe? How stupid ! How utterly stupid ! To think he would be taken as a prisoner, as a place for the Lord Potter to let out his vengeance . For him to humiliate Draco for all the times he called him names to save him from worse pranks. To leave purple marks on his neck for all the times he punched Harry on the face to avoid  other Slytherins harming him from behind his back. How miserable was he to face years of pain for one man and to be inflicted humiliation worse than pain by the same man.
With just some sentences, this man could teach Harry so much. it's no doubt that this is a man who has experienced many things and knows much more. by the way he speaks, Harry could at least deduce that Dumbledore is no where near where he stands.
A tall slim man stepped in the dark, his eyes directly staring into the haunting emerald ones. The grim face slowly slowly shook from side to side , indicating to stop.
Dobby was shocked . His eyes turned towards Draco , disbelief shining in them.
" What to do with all these ? Do you want to keep them here ?"
But stopped short when he caught the sight of a newspaper laying on the dirty floor beneath . At once he jolted up to pick up the newspaper. Roughly dusting it , he said with wide eyes , " This is it ! Look ! It's her !"
" Yes"
The despair grew into grievance in her eyes. Hermione was lost in her thoughts when a loud bang echoed outside, spontaneously waking Pansy as well.
Ron's eyes shone with gratefulness and admiration. He instantly put his hand up with great vigour and said ," I am sorry as well . And thank you for healing me "
Draco eyes rounded comically before he shut them tight. Harry raised his hand and gently caressed Draco's cheek and waited like a spider with a laid out ready web, waiting for a sweet butterfly to state his hunger.
The shopkeeper's expression opened in joy as she grinned wider. Draco himself sported a small smile. It didn't hurt to spend extra galleons when he thought of it as a small Christmas gift to a polite and hardworking stranger who was spending Christmas eve alone in her shop working so that she can make it through the winters. It didn't hurt to see one extra person surviving in this ruthless time of war.
Jerking his hand back , he looked wide-eyed at the egg and turned his eyes to Harry . Understanding his intentions , Harry repeated what Draco did and soon mirrored his expression .
These words, as if a spell, bought Harry's consciousness back, enabling him to react. He realized that many students had already gathered outside. the loud noises drawing their curiosity. Scared as they already were, this commotion caused by him and Draco drew much attention. He took a step back followed by another and soon his boots were hitting the stone floor one after the other in rapid succession as he ran. His mind was a mess. With disoriented thoughts, confused emotions and a lost sense of direction, he ran. That was all he could do at the moment. Desperate, as if the answer for his erratic turmoil lay just beyond.
Sitting back , Harry said," I need to visit Dumbledore. Will you stay here and wait?"
" See .. there were really no rooms . And what is such a big deal if I slept with you ? We are both men, aren't we?" Harry said with a very convincing tone, turning and twisting the entire ordeal.
Leaving these useless thoughts behind, Draco entered the shop. The interior was simple and generous, neatly displaying various items on the shelves around.
Kreacher looked down to clutch the locket in his hands . He looked up at Draco with newfound reverence .
" I am sorry . I won't do it again ."
The solemnity on the faces grew. Gradually more voices rose. First Theo, Ron then Hermione and , surprisingly, Neville who was very firm in his decision.
" Why did you bite yours ?" Harry asked .
Were … they... supposed to take a shit or something?
No one moved , all of them in a tie . Stepping down would mean they admit defeat.
1. A noticeable personality change Harry gained after meeting and learning from Eloise .
__________
"Me as well, Potter. But we still don't know what she actually is.", Draco said, troubled.
The sound of bone breaking was heard clearly as Harry fell down. His nose was bloody and crooked . Ron simultaneously fell down as well , the effect of spell broken.
Hermione's gaze grew serious at the implication, "The moon doesn't know the night exists. How can he ever belong to him?"
- Draco extensively using his healing magic.
Amidst the flailing arms, Harry caught the sight of hot tears falling down burning angry eyes like the flashs of thunder. Silent tears fell down Draco's blazing and glassy red eyes as a sneer was forming on his lips.
Schooling his face to put on the usual cold and expressionless mask , Draco moved past Potter to get back to the castle . He did not wish to speak or banter with Potter right now . He had better things to do .  It was then that he felt a rough hand grab his elbow and a slight intrusion in his mind . Draco broadened his occlumens sheild as he looked back at Potter and demanded ," What is the meaning of this ,Potter ?"
In front of them stood George and Fred with Pansy unconscious in his arms.
Pansy looked at him and thought ,
- Draco reveals why he was always cruel to dobby.
Harry didn't answer and stayed in the same place. Draco turned his gaze towards Theodore , indicating with his eyes . Getting the signal, he immediately nodded and went to Ron carefully lifting his legs to set his knees straight and cast a spell for quick healing. As soon as the wand tip met his knee , Ron sharply wailed as Blaise and Neville held his limbs tightly to stop the thrashing. His voice carrying clear agony. Hermione sat beside him , trying to soothe some pain as Pansy silently supported her.
Harry looked at the baby who was comfortably laying on Draco's chest and said softly, "I would have never guessed that-"
" What if someone powerful senses you ?"
Willing himself out of the enchantment, Draco answered Harry ," It's fine. When in chaos , a help to an ally is a help to oneself "
"As if the moon and the sun . Apart you are powerful forces but together you are phenomenal. Make good use of that fact , my boys "
"Stop ! You dunderhead ! Don't light it !"
Please don't parade your 5 course menu when people only have bread !!!! Tsk ! Such a show-off !!!!
He was beautiful, so beautiful that Harry doubted if it was real. Satisfied, he tidied himself to emotionlessly make his way out of the room, leaving a wrecked and bleeding Draco behind.
Next time Draco woke up, he was lying on the ground in an unknown place. The room was as big as the great hall with marble pillars standing on both sides. Slowly, he sat up and looked around. His body felt like it was run over by the Hogwarts express.  It hurt everywhere. Standing up, he noticed that many objects were carefully kept in here, they looked meticulously cared for. The room itself was dusty and dirty, but the objects were clean without a speck of dirt. Cautiously, he did not touch the objects but looked around and spotted a man in white robes sitting on a stone chair  in the far front. The man wore white robes with gold embroidery similar to wizarding robes. He had blond hair a tint darker that Draco's, somewhat similar to his father. The man sat in a perfect and stiff posture. His back straight, head up and had his back to Draco. He seemed to be reading something. He could see through the man, Draco noticed.  He came to a stop behind him and was thinking of calling out, when the man spoke, " You finally woke up, little one." It was the same gentle voice that spoke in his head. With this, Draco assumed that it was him. The voice did say it was a soul.
Looking at the big ones fighting, the small one was very angry.
The old voice was so angry that he did not even give Harry a warning and directly threw him in the illusion of life and death. The room again fell silent as the figure that was there suddenly disappeared.
The look in the man's eyes was cold , dark , disciplined . It was the first time Draco had seen him like this since he came here. Although Draco only knew him for half a day , still somehow he knew that the man was as soft and sweet  as a marshmallow in hot chocolate . Seeing the look on his face , Draco was stunned . He thought ,' Now he looks like a Malfoy '. Draco calmly replied ," I don't have much time . I choose the first one . Even if it hurts me like death ."
In the defence against dark arts classroom, Slytherin and Gryffindor sat in perfect partition.
Harry looked at Draco's eyes and saw the careful and respectful tone his actions held. The previous bitterness on his tongue was swept away, leaving only a sour sweetness.
Looking up , his mom said ," Come , Harry . Sit down . Let's pray and start dinner ."
Draco grabbed Harry's hand which was pointing the wand at the ginger , his eyes glancing at Ron worried. What Ron did was wrong but this is too much even for him.
But still she plucked a small petal from the vase beside the mirror to lightly kiss and blow it off into the mirror , watching as it passes through to land on the head of an unfilial blonde , glowing and shrouding him in gentle light before disappearing .
Draco's pale nape was pressed against his lips and the faint scent of his hair made his throat dry and grated, eagerly waiting for even a small taste.
Sitting at the Gryffindor table , He started having his food with frowned brows and a tight jaw .
He thought with a huff of relief. Looking around to see himself in an expanse of white sheets and soft comforters, he sat up confused. Where is he ? He did not remember a place like this at Hogwards. Is it the teacher's quarter?
" How could you ?! I am not lying ! You are the one who's lying ! You - "  When he registered his words the lips halted and horror on Neville's soft squishy face was clear. The numerous pranks and taunts reminded him that he was standing before his bully.
So beware, public ! This phenomenon is highly common and contagious, being especially harmful to your public image.
The sorrow on his face slowly turned into hatred, twisting the face with a vicious sneer, "This is where he killed them." He spat out each word with undisguised hostility.
Draco closed his eyes and infused his magic inside her , trying to maybe heal some of her injuries . He knew that Harry was there and exposing himself like this can bring unimaginable consequences , but all his life he had seen people died . Just like that , their eyes losing the light and body crumpling down . He always wished to do something , save someone but could not . This time there was no one stopping him , he could atleast try to save her . And for Harry , what was the worst thing that could happen ? He would have a additional tension on his head but he knew that no matter what , Harry will not sell him out .
Draco sighed at his lack of such common knowledge, "I guess most of the wizarding world has forgotten their own traditions and the reasons behind them. Anyway, We present them offerings, Potter"
At this, Neville didn't know what to say. He wanted to comfort but didn't know how to. If it had been anyone else, it wouldn't have been so difficult. But now with Blaise….
Pansy's gaze sharpened, she could feel Draco's magic buzzing in the air. If she could feel it then other wizards in the vicinity could feel it as well.
Harry thought as he smiled at the scowling Draco as he buried his head behind the egg .
" At the most 2 months "
And let's not forget ,  all of you guys have voted for Mpreg . I have to say brilliant choice. So keep waiting for the new babies as I plan how to make them .
Malfoy's eyes narrowed as he squinted at Harry . Realising his hesitation , Harry sighed as he pulled a startled Draco right into his chest . He did not have time for a 'too proud to be near you' pureblood and didn't realise that it was actually a 'too close to be comfortable near you ' Draco .
Hearing the shout, Draco restlessly stirred in his sleep.
He let himself relish in the comfort for some moments.
The still afloat elf flexed his thin and wrinkled arms, trying to break free before admitting defeat and saying, " Kreacher…..has been watching "
But her chest was so heavy and tight that nothing other than desperate and shallow breaths. The sound of painful and torturous wheezing rang in the desolated midst of trees and rocks.
And second of all, my usual. Did you like this chapter? How was hooligan Harry? And in-charge of the house Draco? Did you find out who are our fourth side couple after Eloise/Luar, Blaise/Neville and Hermione/Pansy ?
Harry leaned back , eyes still on the unfriendly allies . Legs spread apart comfortably , his emotionless voice softly asked Draco ," I didn't think that Crabbe and Goyle wouldn't be invited "
Harry felt a tingle of resentment in his chest. When talked about Theo , Draco vehemently opposed as if it was his own son . And Harry ? What about Harry ? Let alone opposition to putting him in danger , he didn't even blink an eye when sending Harry off ! On the other hand , Pansy , Hermione and even Ron got a personal caution warning from Draco ! But for him ? Not even a look , let alone a word !
Draco and Harry walked side by side to the edge of the forbidden forest . Both in their heads thinking what to do now.
"What am I doing here ?"
Harry uttered ….no. He commanded. And Kreacher was reminded of his master Regulus . For once , a new hope rose in Kreacher's heart. Hope of salvation and of better future. Hope that he will finally be able to complete his master's last order. Hope that he will be able finally return to his master what he once owed him. Hope that his master's sacrifice won't be in vain. With a last look at the youthful face of his new master , Kreacher closed his eyes and disappeared.
Student 1 : "Is it just me or is the pink fog real?"
She shouted again and again. Her laugh turned more maddened the more blood pooled around Draco. It was then that a panicked Harry entered the room with a shout, "GINNY!!!"
Pansy's blue eyes took on a very different shade in the warm brightness of the fire. The shade itself is cold but when gazed into gives the image as if hiding something beautiful inside. Hermione was enchanted. It was as if she was drowning and Pansy was the ocean swallowing her, serene and beautiful but deep and mysterious as well.
When all quietened down again , Harry slowly said to the boy resting on one of the couches ," Do you know why I did it ? "
- AND (drumrolls...) Our second "ah~ I have fallen in love" moment in this fic !
Harry rose to push Draco on his back and mercilessly pound him. Draco was sobbing and choking on his own wails. He willed his hands to crawl away but was animalistically pulled back.
" This is like a travelling trunk , just more convenient . You do not have to worry about theft as it can only be accessed by you . Anyone else cannot open it , it has recognised your magic and won't follow another . Rest assured "
"Lily , he is a growing boy . Give it a rest . Let's go home , he must be tired "
Now, what plans ? You must be thinking. And if your mind is dirty enough and my prophecies are accurate enough, then something that definitely has the potential of giving eggie a younger sibling.
"  We love you as well . Now go . Any longer and I won't be able to take it ."
Blaise gave a perfectionary nod to the leaving men, saying, "You hold me in regards too high to be reality"
Pansy , who was beside her , didn't miss this chance and forcefully snatched the locket. Spells flew around and Hermione's hand tightly clasped around Pansy, pulling her to run.
The elderly resigned entirely said, " Then I shall make it easy for you -"
Fred and George : …..(╥﹏╥)
Draco rubbed his eyes furiously wishing to destroy all the traces of the weakness he exhibited moments ago.
" The gryffindors as well ?", Blaise asked.
Soft and slender hands roamed Harry's body. The tender and careful touch sparking a wildfire across his skin.
Yaxley who was sitting on the side , leisurely enjoying the show , expressed a pleased but mocking expression as he spotted Ron's wet and drained appearance. He was clearly enjoying the desperate and life threatening situation they were in. He enjoyed watching a husband do and try anything , if it meant saving his wife's life . And threatening him was particularly entertaining , like he did this morning . Such a good laugh it was !
Harry felt different. He felt like someone powerful, someone to be respected, someone to be obeyed, someone to be revered and feared at the same time.
Draco was startled and instantly touched his nape to feel an acute sting there . He frowned but said casually, "Must be the mosquitoes"
Both of them turned to face the smiling elder .
Silence prevailed for some frail moments before a shouting rang out :
Harry and Ron neared and were presented with the scene of Umbridge smiling , " You are lying. Wands only choose witches of wizards and you , Mary , are not a wizard "
After reading about ten pages , Harry was convinced that he knew all about basic occlumency and how to use it . Fortunately , this book was of a special type . He did not know if it was originally like this or it was because it was in his head . The book had a particular way of giving examples . After every chapter the book will play out a realistic example . This greatly helped Harry to learn from somewhat practical examples . The  book also had descriptions of barriers against mind attacks . Even if mind attacks are rare and almost extinct , they are very much a threat . The attacker had the ability to control the body of the victim and if it is an expert , even possession is possible . In fact , mind attacks are itself an advanced type of legilimency . They originate from the same roots.
Harry had never come here before but he knew where his room was . He walked to the room as he heard his mom telling him to wash up and come down for dinner .
"You fool ! Do you think you would be alive right now if I had any malice for you ? Voldemort, isn't he the one you fear ? Such a nuisance ! I could crush such a fly with my bare fingers, if I wished so !", It said to Harry in a much calmer but irritated tone as if an elder reprimanding his own family's child. He seemed to be losing his patience fast.
His every nerve was alive and withering, his brain vibrating, his ears abuzz and his sight vibrant. It is absolute euphoric pleasure that he was feeling.
The revelation lit a spark in her chest. As Pansy heard the softened words of gratefulness , her eyes angrily lifted, "What thankyou?! I only did this becau-"
" It seems that your people aren't too keen on this alliance . So, We will be leaving first. I am thankful for this suggestion but the deal between us will end here. Any exchange of information will be distant and mutual---"
Her eyes lingered on how Harry held Draco, tenderly yet entirely shadowing him, showing absolute possession.
" Shut it or , I swear, I am going to hex you into -"
Again, Draco , ultimately choosing to retain his sanity , acted like he did not hear , much to Harry's utter amusement.
If Draco had not come here , he might not even think about this . He might just be wallowing in the memories like he did for the past hundreds of years . He was really thankful to destiny for giving him a chance to meet Draco , this lovely child .
Pansy added , " after you disappeared, the headmaster's funeral was held and Draco's body was taken by the death eaters . They, as I saw, did not seem to doubt anything "
And a spell shot out from his wand, shattering the rock hiding the wizards in pieces.
- the bond between Harry and Dumbledore.
" You fainted so I brought you here"
Harry : ( 0 _ 0 )
Everything was silent. The only sound was Harry's heaving breaths and Draco's silent wheezing. No one was speaking anything. The sound of cicadas outside was clearly sonorous. All their eyes trained on Draco as he gave a violent shudder and collapsed entirely, his eyes rolling back as he fell. Harry caught him, still frightened but more calm.
Draco's thoughts were rapidly derailing from the sane track to the track of what people of 2020 call 'shipping'. Then suddenly, a lightbulb appeared on his head .
The ever familiar voice called out to Draco, "Malfoy ?"
Blaise didn't know what to say. He was the one who started this. His original intention was to portray Neville as someone under his protection. Like this, students and professors will both hesitate to harm him because behind him stood Blaise Zabini, a pureblood heir of a powerful slytherin family and the most probable of the younger generation to enter the ranks of death eaters and ascend to a high position now, that Draco Malfoy was supposedly dead.
-A subtle feeling of Harry flattering and indulging Draco now that he had already hinted his feelings to Draco a.k.a Harry trying to woo Draco.
Soon, their meals appeared in front of him and Harry dug in, momentarily forgetting all about a certain blond Slytherin who kept glancing at him with a slight frown from the other side of the Hall.
"Of course not!" Harry replied quickly. He figured that putting a hand on her shoulder was okay, so he did that. She didn't reject it. "Why don't we go to see the others?  I'll be waiting for you tomorrow at seven o'clock. No excuses."
," Draco replied, rolling his eyes. But it wouldn't prevent him from having to hear another speech about pureblood and homosexual relationships that contradicted the concept of family.
"Yeah, it's going to be incredible! There's no chance we lose this year! Are you saying that's a problem?"
"I know, Harry, I know," Hermione said, trying to calm him down. Harry remembered where they were, and his immediate reaction was to look at the Slytherin table. Malfoy was staring at him, but the other boy made a scowl and looked down at his food. Harry sighed. This was just great. Ginny was in love with him and the boy Harry fancied- Fuck, he fancied Draco Malfoy. He did.
"Hi, Ron!"
"Want to go inside?" he offered. Ginny's face fell a little but she nodded.
He wanted to know what was going on. He wished Malfoy just let him- let him what? Harry didn't even know. He knew they weren't friends. They were more like “archenemies” - if that was even a real thing. Harry had rejected his friendship in their first year because Malfoy had been a giant arsehole at the time. Well, he still was, but Harry's feelings toward him were not as strong as before. Or maybe they were even stronger but in a very different way.
"Things changed. I'm not interested anymore."
Thank you 7HedwigtheBoo7!!
Sorry for the wait. I really can't promise to update more often but at least I'm still writing lol
"Nothing," she answered dryly. Harry frowned.
Ron was still with Lavender, and Ginny was nowhere in sight, so Harry and Hermione had to sit alone. Neville was there too, but he seemed too discouraged by their first class to talk. Hermione gave him comforting words but still looked tense. Elle was still happy, though, and made her smile with her comments and stories.
Lucius used his wand to cut the photo in half and set it on fire. Draco let out a gasp when he saw how Harry Potter's laughter was destroyed by the flames until it was just a pile of ashes on the floor at his feet.
Draco won the game, catching the snitch two out of three times; although, he suspected Potter had let him win the last one.
"Me?" Harry asked dumbly. Of course Hagrid would ask that. He had hoped he could avoid the question.
"That's not true. Professor McGonagall signed my petition. I have it in my pocket-"
They reunited with their families again. With the exception of the Grangers, who had decided to never come back to King's Cross on September 1st after first year. They claimed it was too "crazy", which meant weird and scary.
It was just... Harry Potter was famous. Maybe not him so much, but his parents, who were both respected Aurors. They usually appeared in all the wizarding newspapers, especially the
doing here?"
"Is anything the matter, Draco?" Pansy Parkinson's irritating voice came through the door, and Harry wanted to throw something at her. She was just so annoying, with his black hair and high cheekbones and her perpetual smirk.
"Uh. I have to go," Ginny said suddenly, standing up without much grace and knocking her soup bowl, which Hermione managed to catch before it made a mess. Ginny seemed to panic for a second, but she just disappeared down the hall.
"Sorry, I forgot," he apologized quickly. "But it's not that bad. Promise."
Ron seemed to be sure of what he wanted to do with his life. He wanted to be an Auror. Harry thought that was great, but he also thought that he wanted it mostly for finantial reasons. It was totally understandable since his father's job at the Ministry didn't pay as much as it should. Apparently, working in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office wasn't that important or well seen in the wizarding community. Harry thought that was a mistake.
Some of the students, including Hermione, looked particularly excited. Ron was trying not to fall asleep and Harry couldn't help stare at Malfoy's blond head. The Slytherin looked focused on what McGonagall had to say. Harry was not surprised; Malfoy was the second best student of their year, only surpassed by Hermione (something that annoyed him to no end).
Harry ,with Draco and Theo on his tail, started in the same direction Pansy had gone. Harry walked ahead keeping vigil about the surrounding as Draco and Theo anxiously kept calling in loud voices, "Pansy ! Pansy ! Are you there ?"
" I think we should start our journey as soon as possible " Draco said .
As soon as the words fell, a sense of blankness spread in Draco's consciousness, only a sense of firmness to save Harry remained.
Her request shocked both of them as they looked at each other before she continued .
Her hand slowly raised above her ginger hair and - SLAP!!!
to the medical wing."
Gears turned in Harry's head. Time was short and they had to move fast. They needed a distraction , fast and big enough to distract every official present there. Harry's wand slipped past his sleeve to land in his hand . The people in the room quickly caught the sight of his wand .
"I believe I've proven my credibility enough , haven't I ? "; And it was true . Harry had no wish for unnecessary actions .
As Harry walked out , he left a faint sentence , "Patience , Malfoy. Patience.."
" Reg ? "
Draco didn't even know what he was thanking Harry for. That pervert stalked him to molest him and dared to claim innocence ! And Let's not forget that he almost had a horror encounter with  Golden boy Jr. aka literally a fully loaded, heavy metal machine gun ready to fire !
The terror was too great and overwhelming for a soft marshmallow like  Neville as his wide eyes rolled  back and he promptly fainted with fright.
Harry opened the book and started reading . The first part was about occlumency . He kept reading and did not even realise how time passed .
" Ouch ! "
Just then he felt a slight intrusion enter his head. He could feel the gentle and cool caress on his head as a gentle elderly voice spoke in his head.
His tone and eyes firm as if stating an irrefutable fact. Draco was enraged and irritated by his words. How can this man be so trusting ? How does he try to see the good in people even while staring at his own death ? Does he not fear the future ? Does he not dread pain ?
"Promise you'll get in trouble."
Thanks to 7HedwigtheBoo7 for beta reading this!
Harry said goodbye to Elle and went to face his first class of sixth year.
"Are you okay, Harry?" Hermione asked, and he turned to her, startled.
He blushed furiously every time his mind decided to show him an image of himself, all sweaty and flushed in his bed at night while Harry Potter's smiling face and twinkling eyes floated before him. And... no he wasn't going there now. Not after hearing his father’s hateful words about one simple photograph.
"So? What happened? Were there any mudbloods snooping around?" Zabini asked without bothering to look at Malfoy.
"Again? Potter, you and your stupid ideas-"
"And that is?" the boy said, untrusting.
The second half of the class was practical, and it was incredibly tense because Lavender wanted to practice their new exercise with Ron and Hermione took Harry to the other side of the room to practice.
"But Harry-"
"Are you alright, Harry?" Sirius asked, tilting his head a bit. Harry realized he had been staring. This was embarrassing.
Malfoy stopped mid-air and turned his head around rapidly, looking surprised. He stayed like this for three seconds, finally deciding that coming down was a better idea than staying  up in the air. As he flew towards Harry, he made a show of it, as usual, but Harry just rolled his eyes. It wasn't the time to admire Malfoy's talent with the broom, though his heart tended to beat a bit faster every time he saw Malfoy fly.
Harry had to laugh at that. "No, it wasn't like that. It was nothing, really. I just wanted to... stretch my muscles a bit. I'm getting old."
They went straight to the Great Hall and to the Gryffindor table once they got to the castle. They were greeted by some of their professors, and McGonagall even showed them a smile.
When he remembered he wasn't alone, Harry turned to Ginny, who was looking at him with a curious expression.
"Are you telling me you did let me win?" Malfoy laughed darkly. Even his evil little laugh sounded good to Harry’s ears.
He'd brought his quill and ink, and he sat at a lonely wooden table in a corner of the owlery. Hedwig waited patiently, struggling not to fall back asleep.
Harry grinned. They entered the common room where Ron was snogging Lavender and Hermione was sulking with a book covering her face. When she spotted them, she looked at them cautiously.
"Well, you win this time, Potter," Malfoy said, not as disdainfully as Harry was used to. "I suppose I'll have to reschedule with my team. Don't get too excited, though. We'll beat you in our first game."
"Merlin, Hermione, you scared me!"
"Alright, alright," Hermione whispered, raising her hands to defend herself. "I just
"Hi, Harry," she said. She was wearing a hesitant smile, something Harry hadn't seen on her in years, she was always so confident and bright, but now it seemed to be common on her, at least when it came to Harry.
He had so many things to think about. The mountain of assignments he had, his duties as the new Gryffindor Quidditch Captain, the letter he had received, the problem with Ginny, freaking Malfoy-
Harry grinned against his better judgment. "Then we better start now.”
"It's a nice night," Harry said, not knowing what else to say. He didn't understand the point of this walk, but he didn't want to make it weird. Ginny was his friend, after all. They could talk about anything, couldn't they? but the truth was that they had never had a full conversation. He was always with Ron and Hertmione, and when he was staying at the Burrow, Ginny was around, but mostly she just... watched him, and offered things to eat, with a big grin on her face. Huh.
Harry shrugged as Ron rolled his eyes and Hermione looked like she wanted to punch someone. Perhaps the two boys she had in front of her.
Malfoy was ready to talk to Professor Snape about what was happening, and Harry was sure he even would talk to his father if it was necessary, but Harry had a better idea.
They said goodbye to each other and Elle came running to the chimney, her braids finally done.
Hermione huffed again, something she did when she was extremely annoyed about something. She directed her gaze toward a warm corner where two students were kissing passionately.
When they were all reunited, McGonagall started to call their names. As the kids moved to their respective new tables, Harry caught a glimpse of Elle, who was bouncing with excitement and anxiety. Harry laughed for the first time in what felt like a long time.
They both stared at the floor for several long seconds in an uncomfortable silence.
Harry was used to this kind of behavior from other students, especially the younger ones. He was some kind of celebrity, to his great discomfort, but he couldn't help having famous Aurors as parents. Why were his parents 'famous' in the first place? They caught bad wizards and witches, a normal job. Maybe it was that they were extremely likable. They were always helping others, even when they were off duty. Harry wasn't sure he would be an Auror after he left Hogwarts, but he definitely wanted to be more like his parents. He looked up to them, and his godfather Sirius, and Moony. He loved his family so much.
She smelled nice, but her perfume was similar to the one his mother used and that was one of the similarities between Ginny and Lily Potter that prevented him from finding her particularly attractive. Not that she was ugly, not at all. But gingers were just not Harry's type.
He rolled over to his right side with a grunt. He wished he could just forget about stupid Malfoy and his problems. But the more he tried, the more he saw the other boy when he closed his eyes. He finally fell asleep, but Draco's words from the last summer replayed in his head.
Harry carried both his and Elle's trunks, with Hedwig on top of them. Ron was complaining about the scolding from his mother and Harry laughed. Molly Weasley could be a bit strict, but she was kind and sweet. Hermione and Ginny were just behind them, chatting amicably.
"I mean-" What did he mean? "I mean- you're acting strange. Like you're hiding something. Are you hiding something, Malfoy?"
"He's fine. Says the landscape is wonderful. Uncle Moony's still working on those runes. I can't wait to tell Hermione all about that, she would explode.
"Yeah, of course. Why do you ask?" Had he been that obvious about Malfoy?
"Whatever. What are you doing here?"
"Just give her time. She will get over it."
"I just wanted to- you know what? Fine, we'll go with McGonagall and Snape."
And do
"You have... really nice eyes, Potter."
motions with his hands.
Harry watched him go, feeling that something big had happened that day, and it was barely seven in the morning. When Ron asked him why he was so happy, he just laughed.
Though Harry wasn't a bad student, he still didn't know what he was supposed to do when he left Hogwarts. What he was supposed to choose. Did he want to be an Auror, like his parents? Three years ago he would've said yes, but now he wasn't so sure. It wasn't that he had limited options (he wasn't Hermione, who had an excellent record at everything she did, but he managed to pass his classes), but it was perhaps because of that that he still was confused about all of this. He was just 16, why did he have to make a decision right now?
"That's none of your business, Potter. Leave me alone." Malfoy went for the door, but Harry caught his sleeve. They stared at each other for several seconds.
"Wait,
The next day neither of them said anything; it seemed that they both were determined to ignore what had happened the night before. Dean talked a lot about Ginny, of how pretty she was and how good her hair smelled. It made Harry happy, but neither Ron nor Seamus seemed to react the same way.
"Hi, Harry, Ginny," Hermione greeted them from the red sofa, with a book in her lap. She seemed relieved to see them for some reason. Ron wasn't sitting there with her.
"Hey sweet girl," he said affectionately, and Hedwig nudged his hand with her little head as he petted her. "Sorry to wake you up but I need to send something to Sirius and Remus."
The whole family disapparated just outside the house. His father was very good at disapparating without anyone noticing it. Harry wasn't fond of the sensation, but he was excited to learn to do it himself this year. It would be another form to show he was almost an adult. Also, his mum would be thrilled.
so he could read better.
"Did she just-?" babbled Ron. Harry snorted.
"Yes, my muggle friends! I have a lot of muggle friends where I live. I can't talk about Hogwarts with them obviously, but-"
"You know what, I'm good here."
The blond boy moved toward the stairs, a dozen little boys following him. Harry realized he was staring again. He sighed. He was being stupid.
"You disappeared, we didn't know where you were," she said, smiling apologetically. He sighed.
The Transfiguration classroom had students of all the houses and yet it was only half full. Not many could take this class after the OWLS.
Harry couldn't help it. He walked closer, relieved that he'd decided to bring his cloak. The hall was quiet, but he still managed not to be heard by them.
"I didn't know she was so good," said Ron in awe.
"Well, you were together in the gardens. Weren't you?" Hermione said, but something in her voice made Harry think that maybe it wasn't an innocent question.
"Congratulations, Harry!" Hermione hugged him. "I knew you could make it!"
Harry hummed. He was used to hearing Hagrid talking lovingly of dangerous creatures and beasts. And he wasn't the only one. Sirius always got giddy when talking about Remus, who happened to be a werewolf. Harry also liked dragons and all kinds of creatures in general, that's why he was taking Hagrid's class.
Harry had left the common room to take a walk in the castle with his invisibility cloak. He was nervous about being a captain. He'd never considered himself a good leader, despite everyone telling him that he was a natural- that it was in his blood. All his friends told him this.
The whole Potter family posed for the cover from time to time, looking like the perfect family.
you know,
He didn't want to look, but he found himself glancing at the Gryffindor table. Potter was craning his neck, looking for someone among the first-year students waiting to be sorted, and Draco remembered the little girl that also appeared in the
The second he turned around, Hermione's face was there, staring at him in confusion.
He had to sit, as he wasn't feeling well, and his chest hurt, for two different reasons. Suddenly he couldn't breathe, and he couldn't move. He thought that Malfoy had indeed hexed him. Those last words kept replaying in his head.
"Um. Thank you, Harry."
So he went after her, leaving Dean confused and annoyed.
"Well..." Harry trailed off. He wanted to see his friends, but he was also more nervous about this year than he wanted to admit. Sirius laughed.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Don't blame the drinks. I'm serious, you-"
"Hey, what's wrong?" Harry asked, sitting next to his friend. She huffed.
A satisfied grin appeared on Harry's lips. That is all he wanted to hear in regards to his little sister. He wanted her to enjoy Hogwarts as much as he did. Even more.
The rest of the day passed smoothly. Hermione worked really hard on her classes, and Ron complained a lot about all the things he had to do but never did anyway. Harry decided to work on his Herbology essay, which was easy enough for now. He had double Potions tomorrow. Having to deal with Malfoy and Snape at the same time should be considered one of his best skills, besides Quidditch.
"Hagrid- I can't- breathe," Harry rubbed his ribs over his uniform robes when Hagrid let him down. Hagrid often forgot he was just human and therefore his bones were fragile.
, and then look at him like he wanted to murder him only two months later was beyond him. But this was Malfoy, saying what he said... about Harry's eyes was so uncharacteristic of him that it was ridiculous just try to remember it. It would be hilarious except that Harry had actually believed it, at least he had for a while.
As if on cue, Elle appeared right beside Harry.
"Shut up. That never happened, Potter," Draco spat, rage showing in his eyes. "
Harry noticed Ginny staring at him. He smiled and waved, and she returned the smile, but only for a couple of seconds because she turned her head quickly, letting her straight red hair cover her face.
"I am," Harry rolled his eyes. "I'm just a bit anxious, you know. Sixth year and all."
That very night, Harry was just walking around the corner when he heard the familiar voices. He couldn't see them yet, but he was close enough to hear them; they were arguing rather loudly.
"Hey, I wanted to ask you if you're going to be in the field tomorrow. I know you've always wanted to play on the team." He tried to put on a confident smile, but he didn't want her to feel insecure around him.
When the class was over, Harry agreed to have tea with Hagrid. It wasn't only because he wanted to catch up with him, but because he was tired of his friends. It was the first day and Ron was with Lavender all the time and Hermione was very grumpy and snappy. He hadn't seen Ginny and Neville, who liked to spend a lot of time with the Hufflepuffs.  He also tried to forget Malfoy for a little while.
"Um. No, I don't think so," Ginny said, not quite looking at him. "Tough year, you know. I have so many things to do." She turned to the Fat Lady and gave her the password.
The sky was dark around half an hour before arriving at Hogsmeade. Ron and Harry went out to the bathroom to change while Hermione and Ginny stayed to do the same inside the compartment. Elle stayed with the girls and read one of her books.
He wasn't that lucky, though, as his little sister came running, calling his name, her voice considerably more squeaky than ever.
"But Gin! We've been talking about this for a long time, even before- you know. Before we were together."
"So, Harry, how you been?" Hagrid asked, sitting on a small wooden chair that was stronger than it looked. He handed Harry a piece of his famous chocolate cake with pink frosting.
She was wearing a long, light green dress. Her hair was pulled back in an elegant bun. Always so graceful. She always looked so beautiful.
"I said it was nothing," he spat, glaring at her. "Stop talking about mudbloods, no one cares about that."
"So... We're N.E.W.T. students now," said Ron after a few seconds. Harry relaxed a bit, though he didn't know why he'd been tense before. It had to be Ginny, but he didn't understand exactly was going on. Ron's words were the cue for Hermione to tell them everything she had read about the new classes they were going to be in. Harry didn't want to hear all of that, but Elle was ecstatic and listened raptly.
Harry's stomach churned and suddenly he wasn't that hungry anymore. He didn't know what had happened earlier with Malfoy, but something was telling him that he should find out. The sooner the better.
Harry smiled into his pillow, still asleep. He had been having the same dream all summer, and he couldn't help but smile every time, even if he felt a lot more confused when he woke.
"I promise."
"I just like being back at the castle," he said sheepishly. She laughed.
"It's nothing like that," Malfoy muttered, avoiding Harry's gaze. A faint blush appeared on his pale cheeks and Harry felt the urge to touch his face. Wait, what?
"Yeah, right," Harry sighed, munching on his pastry.
Dean, Ginny, Katie, and Ron arrived not much later. Dean was beaming at Ginny, who smiled at him apologetically. There were also students from previous years. Harry had to send back a first-year who claimed that he was the best seeker in the whole school.
"I missed you, too," Harry replied. It was true. Hagrid had been a family friend from when Harry's parents were in Hogwarts. Harry grew up playing with him and listening to his incredible stories about dragons and unicorns and centaurs and all types of magical creatures. Hagrid was a great teacher, but not everyone could appreciate it.
It was almost October when Harry got the letter from Sirius and Remus a few days later. Harry and Elle had already received several letters from their mum and dad, along with muggle and wizarding sweets. Half of those sweets came from Sirius and Remus.
"Oh, yeah. I visited Charlie for the summer. He's got two new baby dragons. They're lovely."
compartment, you know." he joked. Ginny giggled. Hermione moved away a bit so Ginny could sit next to her, facing Harry.
The corridor was crowded but he found the 'Malfoy compartment' easily. Harry stood just outside, considering if the Slytherins would notice if the door suddenly slipped open without no one being there.
Harry was shocked. That wasn't an image he'd want to see anytime soon. He'd seen how Lavender had flirted with Ron in the train hours ago, but he hadn't expected things to move so... fast. Harry turned to look at Hermione again and found Ginny giving her a comforting pat on the forearm from her side of the sofa. Harry thought he was missing something here, but he didn't push it and changed the subject.
"Yeah, I'm just not that hungry," answered Harry, smiling faintly. Ron snatched the pastry out of Harry's hand with a grin.
"I can't believe I'm going to Hogwarts! Do you think I'm going to be a Gryffindor? Or I could be a Hufflepuff, I've heard they are nice. I can't wait to learn all those spells, and potions-"
She gave him a sheepish smile and he grinned down at her. This year would be great. At least for Elle.
"It's fine, Hermione, we talked," Ginny said. Harry saw that she was embarrassed, and he muttered a goodnight when she said she was tired and needed to sleep. He and Hermione stayed up for a bit longer before deciding to  o to their rooms, leaving Ron and Lavender alone in the common room.
As always, the impressive Hogwarts Express awaited. Harry sighed in contentment. He loved summer, but Hogwarts would always be his second home, and he was glad to come back.
Harry rolled once again and blinked his eyes open. He glanced at the muggle clock his mother had given him years ago. He could barely see the numbers, as he wasn't wearing his glasses, but he guessed it was only 7 a.m. He grunted and hid his face in his soft, soft pillow. It was so soft.
"What are you doing, Malfoy? What's going on?"
Yes, he was. Distracted by Draco Malfoy. How ridiculous was that?
There was a moment where everything else stopped and they were alone, staring at each other. There was shock in Malfoy's eyes, but then he seemed to shake himself and sent Harry a death glare. He then turned to look at his father and muttered a few words, nodding his head. Lucius seemed to be satisfied with whatever his son had said because he smiled just slightly and put a hand on his son's shoulder.
"If you say so," Ginny said, and she laughed, looking at him with playful eyes.
Harry fell asleep thinking about Malfoy's peculiarly good scent.
"WHAT-"
Narcissa was also there, but was standing a few feet away, with her back turned to Harry. She looked uncomfortable, as if she didn't want to intrude but also wanted the odd scene to be over.
He stayed a bit longer with his friends, ignoring Ron and his new love. After a while, he started to yawn.
Draco shook his head, putting his head into his hands. This had to end. He couldn't just pine after stupid Harry Potter. His parents were right, it was wrong. Even though it felt so right.
"Harry! Harry! Wake up, we're going to be late!"
"Yeah, okay." Her voice sounded strange but Harry ignored that.
"I practiced with the twins," she said later as an explanation.
She went from paper white to bright red, but Harry pretended not to notice. Merlin, this was awkward.
, as Hermione emphasized more than once. The class was shared mostly with other Gryffindors and a few Hufflepuffs - not even half the amount of the previous years.
Here I go again. New chapter after a few months. I hope you like it and thank you for reading. As always, thanks to 7HedwigtheBoo7 because this wouldn't be as good as it is without her help.
"Can I stay here with you, Harry?" asked Ginny from the compartment door. Harry blinked. "I mean, in this compartment," she added with a shy smile.
She hummed in agreement. She looked more relaxed and content, and Harry thought he might be doing something good. "So," Harry started again because it seemed that she wasn't going to talk anytime soon. "Are you excited about this year?"
"Why would you do that?" he whispered, as if not wanting to say it too loud in case it wasn't the truth.
"Oh, nothing, really," she stammered nervously. Ron had screamed Ginny's name but his sister didn't hear. "It's just-" Hermione added, but she closed her mouth shut.
"Hey, Dean," Harry whispered. Ron was brushing his teeth in the bathroom. Dean was taking off his shoes two beds away from him.
"Hi, Hermione. Ginny," Harry said, sitting next to Hermione, who looked at him in alarm, while Ginny avoided his glance. She was frowning slightly and her cheeks were pink.
"Where were you?" Ron asked, his mouth full of sausage and pumpkin pasties. Harry sat beside him and stabbed a sausage with his fork.
"Well, I just thought-"
Elle's braids took five minutes, which was a record. She thanked him and went running again with her friends. It gave Harry a bit of time to check his schedule for the day. Transfigurations would be his first class. Ron and Hermione would be there, too, since all three of them thought that Transfigurations was a very important subject for almost any career. Even though Harry was not very good at it and would have to study even more this year.
"Look what happened with my cousin, Sirius," she pressed. "I can't even imagine the shame Uncle Orion and Aunt Walburga went through. You were too young to remember, but the whole Black family was outcasted. None of the other pureblood families wanted any kind of relationship with us. And this could happen again if you don't stop this. Can't you see it, Draco?" Her usual cold voice turned urgent, desperate.
"Hullo, dad." He sat at the empty chair. Breakfast was toast and bacon, which Harry devoured in seconds, to Elle's annoyance and his dad's amusement.
Hermione was frowning so hard that she might have a stroke, nothing too surpprising, if Harry was being honest. "They're extremely annoying, and we need to concentrate if we want to pass this class."
Malfoy turned his head to the right, and then to his left, where Harry was. He tilted his head slightly, a curious glint in his eyes. His face remained impassive, though. For a second, Harry thought Draco could see him.
When he entered the Gryffindor common room, everyone was there, and they were celebrating something.
Elle came running to him at lunch and told him everything that had happened in her classes. She looked so happy that Harry beamed with pride. If she only knew that she would be suffering in just a few years, he thought and laughed to himself.
That had been weeks ago, and Draco hadn't stop thinking about it.
he was looking for. There was a brief moment when he thought Malfoy was also looking for him, but the other boy was engaged in a conversation with Theo Nott and Pansy Parkinson.
"Fight for the snitch!"
"At least Ginny is acting normal again," Ron added between mouthfuls of mashed potatoes.
Unbelievable. All Draco had wanted was to let himself forget about it. He'd hoped Potter had too. But apparently, he hadn't. Draco had acted out of impulse, he hadn't been thinking before opening his mouth. And now Potter was there to never let him live it down.
"Can you stop talking about my sister?" Ron huffed, annoyed. Harry chuckled. Dean only shrugged, not bothered by Ron's words.
"Harry, my boy," Sirius said with affection. Harry beamed. He loved his godfather, and he missed him a lot. But he and Remus were currently on a trip to Wales because Remus had discovered something with runes. "Are you ready for a new year at Hogwarts?"
"Well, you seem to be a little... lighter? If that makes sense? Refreshed?" she looked as confused as Harry felt, but then he remembered the letter to Sirius and Remus, and she was right. He felt better, despite everything.
Ron muttered something sounding like 'everyone likes you better', but Ginny didn't hear; she was running towards Dean, her ponytail swinging with each step. Harry sighed. It was good to have the old Ginny back, and he hoped it stayed that way. He wondered for a second if she was just too good to forget people or she was a damn good actress.
Now, he kept replaying Draco Malfoy's voice in his mind over and over.
"Oh, they're great, Mr. Potter," said Hermione. "Mum can't stop talking about that dinner party you had last month. She loved the food and dad wants to know what was in the drinks that you served."
"Slept well, Harry?" his mum asked. Truth was, he wasn't so sure. Admittedly, he liked hearing Malfoy's voice in his dreams, but that didn't mean the dreams were all good. Most of the time, it was just the voice, but he couldn't see Malfoy; only a dark tunnel he didn't cross for some reason.
Harry said goodbye to Hagrid and went back to the castle just in time for dinner. Ron and Hermione were there already, but Hermione looked invested in her conversation with Ginny, while Ron ate his steak and played Wizard's Chess with Neville.
"What the hell, Hermione? Why couldn't we stay there with them?" Harry hissed, his wrist a little sore from her tight hold.
"Then what is going on? What-"
"Uh, thanks," he said finally. The news had taken him by surprise but he felt happy. He knew he was a good player, but he never actually thought he could be the captain of the Quidditch team. It hadn't been his intention.
Potter looked particularly happy despite having lost. He was grinning like an idiot, and Draco noticed how bright his eyes were. They were still floating on their brooms, closer than Draco had anticipated when he spoke the words.
"She's with Hagrid, she said in an annoyed voice "You left her and she didn't know where you were. She was worried about you."
"What just happened?" Harry asked, baffled.
Harry wasn't getting any of it, though. "Then, what was your father telling you? Was he asking you to do something dangerous?"
"Who else? Me?" Hagrid grunted with a laugh.
"None of your business," Harry retorted, finally putting his letter back in his pocket. Malfoy didn't miss the movement, but he said nothing. His eyes shone when he looked up at Harry despite the darkness around them.
"I'm choosing our team's new members today," Harry crossed his arms over his chest. He hoped he looked intimidating enough for Malfoy to back off. "You can stop and go now."
His parents had written to congratulate him and to send him luck. Harry felt a little better after hearing from them. He suddenly wished they were there with him. His father had told him he was proud, and that no matter the outcomes, he should be proud of himself as well.
"Night, Harry."
When it was her turn, she looked like she might faint, but she still sat on the stool in front of everyone. The sorting hat covered half her face and it was only two seconds until it shouted "
Ginny sighed. Harry couldn't imagine Ron telling Ginny she couldn't do anything she wanted to do. That would be wrong. Harry would need to talk to his best friend.
He bumped into someone. Hard.
"Are you sure I can't tell Mandy? She's my best friend!" Elle complained, pouting.
"Don't be ridiculous," the boy snorted, but his face contorted in a way that indicated he wasn't telling the truth.
"I'm fine, Hermione," Harry nearly shouted, walking past her.
He’d thought that perhaps they both could… What? Start over? Become friends? Okay, that had been idiotic, Harry saw that now. He wouldn’t want to be friends with someone who was only playing with him. This could be his best year, if he just forgot about Malfoy and his bullshit.
"Good night."
Harry won, being fairly certain that Malfoy had let him win, but neither of them mentioned it.
Harry didn't have to decide now who was going to stay on the team, but it was clear that Ginny and Katie would pass to the next round. Ron wasn't terrible, but he became incredibly nervous and made more mistakes than the rest, and Harry couldn't afford that. He still had two more sessions to see if his friend was good enough, but if he made it, he would have to learn to control his anxiety. That wouldn't be easy for him.
to distract himself from his current train of thought.
When the train finally stopped, Malfoy didn't bother standing up and picking up his things to leave. Parkinson and the others watched him, but Malfoy only waved them off.
Hagrid nodded. "Well, the magical creatures are fascinating, and you have a talent for this."
Harry held his breath as each Slytherin walked out the door, fortunately without noticing his presence.
"Oh."
"Lucius-" Narcissa intervened, but Lucius held up a hand and she didn't say anything else and remained still.
" Astronomy tower , remember ?"
in this chapter,
Blaise drew a sharp breath as Neville closed his eyes and wordlessly nuzzled into his palm.
"Hush, now. It's fine. Its all is fine.", The voice was elderly and gentle but still held with it some playfulness .
They heard a sickly sweet voice asking the woman, " Mary Elizabeth Cattermole ? "
The sight that greeted Harry was of a pale figure laying in the wide bed in the middle of the room. The beauty was deep asleep, his chest rising and falling gently , making the image as if inviting the spectator to cuddle and sleep beside him .
" Goodmorning " , Ron said .
Harry immediately conjured a glass of water after seating him upright and brought it to Draco's lips , slowly lifting the bottom up.
" No"
The hallway leading to the courtroom was dark and ominous. It was bleak , as if haunted by a millennium old demon . A struggling man was forcibly being taken towards one of the rooms. Flanked by two arours , he was crying and pleading , begging them , saying,
This time, Harry took his eyes from the ruins and looked into the glassy grey eyes. His voice unconsciously softened, leaving only affection and pampering from the previous sorrow and hatred, "Yeah, We will."
The lips , dry and parched , soon found a small pink fruit berry hidden under white fabric , the small mountain pressing against the cloth. The lips were so thirsty that they did not even remove the white cover cloth and bruisingly sucked right through it . As down below , a large hand roughly pressed down on the pole making the small tent . Feeling the twitching , the hand pressed harder and lips sucked more. The body under him could not take anymore . Pressed below , it couldn't even arc itself and , instead , trembled so gorgeously . Crystal tears slid down the red cheeks and a sticky wetness accumulated on Harry's hand . Just two rubs were all it took to milk this delish.
" Still don't know what you are talking about"
The witch took him to a room before slowly turning around. She beckoned him to come closer as if to tell a precious secret. Harry hesitantly leaned forward.
Was it guilt that made his throat clog up and heart squeeze? Guilt? Sympathy? Anger? Hate? Resentment? ….No. It was none of these. It was entirely different or maybe a well-stirred potion made of all of these.
– that he didn't need to suffer anymore, that the act he so much wanted to do but was too scared to perform was, now, gifted to him by someone else. Maybe he thought this was his last deed. Maybe not. No witness was present to tell us ultimately what those emotions in his eyes told. The only other person was too lost to recognize even himself. So the only hope we have is if the person himself survives. Maybe he will tell us?
" Does this thing have rocks in side ? Or was the polyjuice potion defected ?" , Pansy said .
The question somewhat shocked Draco but he still answered, " I have been well. What about you and everyone else ? Has there been any progress? any important information ?"
Despite the churn in his gut, Harry smiled gently ,like a beautiful carnivore flower , and coaxed , " Okay , I apologise for my insensitivity. Now, Will you please forgive me and have your breakfast ?"
Amused, the voice replied, " Yes. It was me. Did I do a bad job ?"
---------------------------------
"Good", Hermione uttered as she walked out.
Looking up, the sight of Draco sitting on top of him while leaning down all the while screaming profanities was so much of a stimulation that Harry barely registered what his words meant.
" Granger ! What happened to you ? How did you suddenly go stupid ?! "
Meddling in his own filthy thoughts, he almost missed Draco's weak demand owing to his hoarse voice ," water "
Wishing to look at the convict's face to further assess his actions and solve the case, Draco opened his eyes to a slit and when nothing happened anymore, he fully opened his eyes to see a smiling Harry who in this moment looked eerily similar to Dumbledore but with very bad intentions. Believing that there was no threat, he opened his mouth to ask Potter what the hell he was doing when a similar hand joined another plum cheek and - STRECH!!!
Another tilt was felt but this time somewhat more forceful.
"Like their favorite wine or food. But these are personal preferences. Do you know what the souls in the Netherworld crave the most ?"
" And I don't know that . You could be lying" the wand in Blaise's hand twirled around his fingers as he leisurely walked closer.
Draco was ultimately worried about his IQ, fearing that any more of Potter's company can harm it drastically. He was already feeling some of the symptoms. Ahhhh….he really needs to get out of here.
" What's your name ? "
The liquid, Draco noticed, had a peculiar smell, like burning and rotting flesh. Shockingly, he realised that it smelled the same as the draught of living death ! It was just that it seems to have stronger and more harmful effects than the draught of living death.
Draco was still unsure and kept behind Harry. After all, if a supposed attack came then Mr. Hero Potter can probably fight it but on the other hand , someone like him who is an esteemed potion student, charms and array expert and a healer apprentice, cannot .
Now , what to do when the husband of the woman you were kissing saw you kissing ?
Draco was momentarily dazed . He didn't expect Potter to ask this . It seem that Gryffindors were even more stupid than a fat pig !!! Hitting right on the sore spot !!! He was tempted to bite back but closed his mouth and replied ," Destiny is not as kind to everyone as it is to you "
Walking to George and Fred, he asked silently but worried, "What is going on ? What happened to both of you ?"
She frowned but kept walking, ignoring it as something minor. As her steps increased, the tightness in her chest did as well, soon transforming into severe pain.
Days passed by and the assault continued. What was the last time he saw his friends and his family? Were the peacocks back at the mansion healthy? Did Blaise and Pansy have their wedding yet? Did mother's treatment at St. Mungos work? When was the last time he had stepped outside of this room? When was the last time he felt the cool wind on his face? A year? Maybe two?
backwards. Harry felt like an idiot. He had forgotten about his little sister after he had promised to be with her. All because of a stupid git who had just played with him. What was he thinking?
"Draco," she said, sounding tired, and Draco frowned. "This... infatuation you have, is just that. An infatuation. It won't last. I'm telling you that if you don't end this now, our family will fall from grace."
The Great Hall was crowded. He spotted his friends and Elle almost immediately. Elle was wearing her red and gold scarf even though it wasn't that cold inside the castle. Harry had to laugh at that. That was some house pride!
"Y'know, I think I saw Malfoy earlier. Guess he was in a bad mood or something. Glaring at everything."
Soooo
Harry winced in sympathy for his best friend. He had stayed a few summers at The Burrow, the Weasley home, and he knew how hard it was to de-gnome the garden. Nobody in that house liked that chore, but it was usually Ron who had to do it.
Inside the castle, it felt like everyone was avoiding him. It was different from the previous years, as Draco'd always been surrounded by both boys and girls who wanted to be as popular as him. Pansy was now sending him poisonous glares but he wasn't worried. She always forgave him, no matter what he did. Draco susp3cted she had a crush on him but he wasn't interested. not when Harry Potter existed.
"Why do you have your invisibility cloak with you, anyway?" Ron asked, a little offended. "Did you go to find trouble without me?
Harry laughed. That was true, and Harry found himself thinking about third year, when Malfoy had mocked Buckbeak the Hippogryph and it hurt him as a reverge. It was official, he couldn't help thinking about Malfoy. He was going crazy.
"No, no- it's nothing like that- it's just-"
Hagrid was right, though, about that carrer. Harry didn't care about glamour or fame or money. He just wanted to be happy.
Harry turned his head as his parents and Elle were walking towards him and Hermione. Once they were all together, Lily gave Hermione a big hug, and James asked about her parents.
"I know. The Burrow was always chaotic. without Fred and George being there, things have cooled down a bit, though."
Anyway, I hope you enjoy this chapter. I have made a few changes to fit it to the story I have in my head, but it's nothing too relevant.
"I'm sorry, Mother," he said, finally. He wasn't sure why was he apologizing, but he didn't want to be the cause of his mother's distress. He couldn't do that to her, even though their relationship wasn't exactly the warmest.
"Good morning, everyone," said Professor McGonagall, looking at the class above her spectacles. She was standing next to her desk, looking pleased. "I have to say that I'm very glad to have students from all four houses. You are here not only because you got high marks on your OWLS in Transfiguration, but because you have a special interest in this branch of magic. I am very proud.”
Next chapter will be from Draco's pov!
Harry nodded, smiling fondly. He felt lucky to have his friends, but when Hagrid spoke again, Harry's smile faltered.
“It won't hurt to remind you."
"You think about it, Harry."
It wasn't until the trolley lady stopped by their compartment that Ron casually mentioned Malfoy.
Harry grinned. He would write to him. Remus, too. He missed them both and he actually wanted to... ask some things. They would understand.
Harry turned, grinning wide as he saw Sirius' face on his chimney. "Sirius!" he said. Elle was screaming in the background.
Ginny usually ran to meet her friends when they entered the train, so Harry found it odd that she wanted to stay. And why would she ask him specifically?
"How was Elle? Did she give you any trouble?"
Harry sat at the corner next to Luna, who smiled kindly at him while reading
"That's not true, I know it. What is it? Your brothers? They're telling you that you can't do it? Because you know-"
"Yes, well, I told you I changed my mind! I don't want to anymore! You can go alone!"
"Yeah, all yours now," he said, leaving Ron in the bathroom. He threw the cloak over himself before he could stop to think about it and went to look for Malfoy.
"Thank you," Harry said to the boy, who nodded eagerly before running into the common room without looking back.
Damn Potter and his invisibility cloak. He thought he could just do anything he wanted just because nobody could see him. He slipped open the compartment door just enough for Potter to get in. It was stupid, and he didn't understand what was going on, but he'd done it and he could only wait to see what would happened next.
"Just 'oh?' Harry, you're the Gryffindor team's captain!" Ron almost shouted in his ear. His grin was big and genuine.
Hermione's face transformed immediately. She smiled brightly at the mention of Harry's sister. "Oh, no, not at all. She was marvelous. She asked a lot of questions and the other girls wanted to be around her. She'll be very popular. I had to remind them that their bedtime had already started. Those kids."
"My ego? Look who's talking!"
"I don't think she wants to speak with me now, huh?" Harry said. Hermione put a hand on his arm.
"Time to go to bed," Hermione announced. She closed her book and the three of them walked toward the bedrooms.
Potter probably was there to eavesdrop Draco’s conversation and know what was going on. The nosy Harry Potter. Always too 'preoccupied' for other people. Draco could put up with Potter's accusations about Lucius Malfoy's obsession with the dark arts, as it wasn't exactly a secret, even though he hadn't done anything strictly illegal. Yet. But when the Gryffindor poster boy mentioned what had happened, what Draco had said...
" What is it ,sir ?"
The man opened his eyes and leisurely smiled at Draco , even if it was slightly strained. He stood up and walked to Draco.
That day Harry had a peculiar aura around him. An aura that gave Draco chills down his back but at the same time made his entire body so sensitive, so aware of him that being in the same room as him seemed impossible. To Draco, Harry seemed enchantingly suicidal.
The loud voice pierced directly through Harry's brain.
" Pig ? To believe such atrocious words to be heard from the Slytherin Prince !!! What will the other snakes say ? I guess such behaviour is to be expected considering that Slytherin are a bunch of species lacking in decency" ; Harry irked whisperingly as his other hand drew closer as if to lay on top of Draco's head. It was obviously a threat . If he willed to utter anything else , he won't have one but two hands on himself .
With a bang, Harry and Draco both landed on the hard and cold pavement. Their limbs entangled as they struggled to sit upright.
The smirk was the same yet the green in Harry's eyes grew darker, heavier, "Yet, the night entirely encompasses him. Without his dark night, can the moon shine with the bright day?"
" Oh ! Off with it now . Now that you have heard me play , I expect better than those torture skills next time." Pansy said , taunting .
Draco's eyes brightened at this. Knowing  anything from this man was akin to finding a precious treasure which even Voldemort and Dumbledore will be desperate to have. But Draco was not so daft to just go for it without knowing the catch.
The general must run away when he has no soldiers to fight the war and surrender when ambushed with no chance of escape . And Draco is very much ambushed . Surrender  ~ is the decision taken by Malfoy , it seems .
[ Not the whole way , not even skin to skin
This garnered their attention . Hermoine replied first saying ," What exactly happened ?"
Hermione's voice trembled for a moment when asking that. She and Ron both were rather wary of Harry now-a-days. They weren't scared of him. But the change in Harry was not subtle. It was just the way he moved and spoke as well as the look in his eyes that uncovered him. There was a subtle pressure around him.
Draco's face showed clear doubt but he nodded. Even if he did not agree, he still believed Harry's judgement. But he still did not want to stay here alone .
Draco's hand moved to touch the gem on his magical portable ring and an egg appeared in his awaiting lap. His hand rested over it as he gently caressed the white surface. His gentle gestures evoked the illusion of a motherly warmth.
Draco slowly blinked . Maybe it was the dirt in his eyes. But the green eyes were still there, but now looking down with an utterly scared gaze as if seeing death. Curious as to what the eyes were so frightened by, Draco looked down as well .
Draco slowly sank to his knees. He picked up a twig from the ground, transfiguring it to a short broom. He was respectful when he gently brushed the tombstone and the grave free of snow and soil. Next, he took a small stone and transfigured it into a silver lamp. He skillfully glided his wand to magically crave incantations on it.
Harry kissed his little sister's head and assured her that he would be in the Gryffindor common room in an hour. She smiled and went willingly with Hermione, who talked to her excitedly about Hogwarts, making Harry snort in laughter. Some things, or rather, persons, never changed.
The gardens were well illuminated, but he cast a
"Harry!" Hermione's voice reached him before he could see his friend. And then his face was stuffed with frizzy hair. He laughed.
Elle grinned and went to sit with her new classmates at the end of the table, after receiving congratulatory words by Harry's friends. Harry was happy to have his sister in the same house. It felt like it was the house of family.
The Great Hall was almost empty, except for the Professors, who were chatting happilhy among them (Professor Snape, who was scowling at the remaining students from his spot). Nearly Headless Nick was chatting animatedly with the Fat Friar in a corner. Harry smiled. It was nice to come back to Hogwarts.
"No. I think I smelled something, that's all."
"Whatever."
Draco was now in a darker mood when he got to the carriages that took them to Hogwarts. Pansy insisted on wanting to know what was going on with him but he just stayed silent. Crabbe and Goyle were too busy exchanging Chocolate Frog Cards to notice anything.
Harry put his letter inside of his trunk and got under the covers. He took off his glasses and put them on the bedside table next to his wand.
"Not yet, sweetheart," her mum said patiently, patting her little hand. Elle pouted more, but then she kept talking about how excited she was.
Hedwig was sleeping but she woke up when she sensed him coming. She was one of the most beautiful owls Harry'd ever seen and he was so proud of her.
Harry smiled at the memories. He hugged his parents and his best friends’ parents. Everyone hugged each other, and Elle sobbed a few times, but she was still excited to go. They said goodbye one last time and walked towards the Hogwarts Express.
"Yes, I know, Mother," he said. He knew what was she going to say, and he didn't want to hear it again. She'd always been gentler than his father, but she was also cold and distant and that didn't make it better.
"She said she had to do some studying for Potions or something. She locked herself in the girls’ bedroom right after dinner." Dean didn't sound particularly worried.
It was stupid, to have clipped photos of Harry Potter from the
Ron opened his mouth to answer, but Hermione, who was right behind Harry, spoke first.
"Well, yes," Harry admitted, feeling incredibly stupid for telling the truth. He looked at his shoes, but Malfoy didn't say anything else, so he had to lift his head again and to see his face. The other boy was gaping at him.
"Draco," she started, but he shook his head.
Harry looked at the others. Ron seemed to be just as confused as he was and Hermione was staring at him expectantly.
He remembered the shocked expression on Potter's face. The boy's cheeks had turned pink, his lips parted and his eyes... His eyes were something else, even behind those incredibly ugly glasses, Potter's eyes shone like they were a universe on their own.
Someone was flying around the Quidditch pitch when Harry got there. By the green of their uniform and their extremely pale hair, Harry could only assume it was-
They walked in silence for a few more minutes, and then Harry decided that he just wanted to go to the Gryffindor common room to be with Ron and Hermione.
"I'm fine, Hagrid. I guess you've been busy?" said Harry as he ate the cake eagerly. It was so good.
"I promise."
"Harry-" she mumbled with terror in her voice. "Where did you come from?"
"Must be that Granger. I'm sure she smells bad. Like all mudbloods," Parkinson commented with her usual smirk. She was still stroking Malfoy's hair but he sat straighter and her hand fell.
"She's too busy trying not to get to King's Cross by herself," replied Harry. Elle was sitting while their mum tried and failed to braid her dark hair because the little girl just couldn't sit still.
So there's no Voldy in this fic but Lucius is still kinda obsessed with the dark arts *shrugs*
"Are you okay?" Ginny asked with a frown. "You seem a bit distracted."
Harry had Care of Magical Creatures after lunch. Hermione nor Ron had decided to take that class, as they never really thought Hagrid was the best teacher, but Harry loved everything Hagrid did, although he knew it was a bit risky, or
"I'm happy to see you, too, Hermione," he said when she stepped back after the bear hug. She grinned. She was wearing her muggle clothes, but Harry knew she would change as soon as they were on the train. "Where's Ron?" asked Harry.
just before the summer holidays.
"I have to do something, you lot go ahead," he said, sounding as bored as ever.
Ginny sobbed a bit more, her eyes wet, but she did smile a bit. "I'm so sorry, I ruined everything, didn't I?"
"I just don't get it," Hermione said when they were fifteen minutes into their spells. She hadn't made great progress, and Harry was even worse at it. "One day she ignores him, and the next day, she can't leave him alone." She slammed her
book and let out an exhausted sigh.
Malfoy answered after several seconds. "I come here to think. Not that's any of your business," he added, narrowing his eyes. "What are
Harry recalled the time just before second year when he followed the Malfoys to Knockturn Alley, where Lucius Malfoy took Draco to buy dark objects for reasons Harry didn’t understand. Or in fourth year when the man specifically requested that Draco learn to cast the three Unforgivable Curses, which was roundly denied by Dumbledore.
"Your father is right," she said, looking at him in the eye.
On September 1st, he saw Harry Potter at the train station watching him while Draco's father was lecturing once again about pureblood this and pureblood that.  Draco had already decided to ignore everything about the Gryffindor boy. He felt the stupid need to smile at him, but instead glared and sneaked into the train as soon as he said goodbye to his parents.
"But Gin-"
Ginny looked sad all over again, and Harry knew that it wasn't what she had wanted to hear from him. He winced. "Look, I'm sorry I can't return your feelings-" Ginny started sobbing then, and Harry wanted to curse himself. "But hey! We're family! You can count on me, Gin. I'll always be here for you. Don't forget that."
Draco hated it. He hated Potter and his perfect family, his righteousness and his carefree spirit. And he hated those fucking green eyes. Draco also hated that he was in love with him.
"Yesh, right," Seamus grunted. Harry decided to ignore it, but after a long, awkward silence, he looked back.  Seamus was staring at him, or at his chest, specifically. Harry had barely realized that he had taken off his shirt, revealing his bare chest.
"I guess they like me better?"
"Owlery," he answered.
"No," Malfoy said in a soft voice, he stared out at the corridor for a couple of seconds and then began to close the door.
She made a face and Harry remembered that she was actually in fifth year and so she would be taking her O.W.L.S. He couldn't help his chuckle.
Soon enough, it was time to go. Elle got a bit nostalgic, but Lily and James promised to write to her everyday and paint her bedroom neon pink before Christmas. Harry remembered when he was a first-year. His parents had given Hedwig to him and Sirius and Remus had given him the Marauder's Map. James and Lily weren't supposed to find out, but James saw it once on Harry's bed when he was twelve, and promised not to tell his mum if he promised not to give Professor McGonagall a heart attack because of it.
Parkinson's hand found its way to Malfoy's hair and she started to brush it softly. Harry watched the movement from where he was standing next to the door. He didn't understand why it was so irritating, but it just was. She was irritating. Could she just stop doing that?
Harry chuckled. And this was the Ginny he wanted to see, the happy, carefree Ginny. Not the awkward, shy, staring Ginny he saw moments earlier. They waved at Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore on their way to the moving stairs.
Neville was already fast asleep when Harry got into the boys' room, Trevor resting on the boy's feet. Harry went to his own bed by the window and started to undress. When he was under the duvet, he let his mind go back to Malfoy.
"Yeah?" Harry prompted her.
"Harry! Where have you been?" a furious Hermione yelled at him. Her black cloak was waving behind her when she ran toward him, and her face changed when she took a closer look at him. "Are you alright?"
But Harry wasn't listening. He could still hear those words, the words he dreamed about almost every night.
His stomach churned as if he was going to vomit. Narcissa Malfoy never talked about her cousin, so Draco knew that this was serious. She would be devastated if Draco did something like… like what Sirius did. And his father...
"I know. Harry."
"Yeah, sure," said Harry after a while. His mum looked at him with confusion but said nothing about it. "More toast?" she asked. Harry ate more toast.
The class started soon and Harry enjoyed every minute of it. They talked about Werewolves but there weren't any in the Forbidden Forest, for obvious reasons. Harry couldn't help to think about Moony and couldn't wait to hear, or read, from him and Padfoot.  They talked with Firenze the centaur and tried to look for fairies, but they were really small and fast and liked to play hide and seek with them.
"Hermione, I think you should stop drinking my dad's drinks. They're making you see things." It was a poor defense, but it was better than nothing.
Harry saw a bunch of nervous kids, staring open mouthed and chatting with each other. He still couldn't see Elle, but figured she must be already bonding with at least half a dozen kids over dogs and sweets and muggle music.
By lunch, Harry's mood had worsened, making Ron and Hermione wonder what had happened.
"It's not the most glamorous career but it's very rewarding," Hagrid mentioned proudly. "It's like having lots of children who love you as much as you love and care for them. And they can be very dangerous to people who want to hurt you."
"Yeah..." Harry muttered, but he wasn't thinking about Ron and Lavender. Malfoy was watching as Parkinson failed to transform her quill.
Harry was up way before the rest. He hadn't noticed Ron walking into their room last night, but now he was snoring very loudly in the bed next to his. Harry took a quick shower and dressed in his uniform robes. It was too early for breakfast and it would be weird to walk alone in the gardens, so he went to the owlery. He suddenly felt the need to communicate with Padfoot and Moony.
He had no idea.
The night before the new school year, Narcissa Malfoy entered Draco's room unannounced while he was choosing some of his best robes and levitated them to his Hogwarts trunk. He turned his head a bit, acknowledging her presence.
Harry picked at his dinner unenthusiastically. Ron asked him what had happened with Ginny but he said he had no idea. He didn't want his best friend to be suspicious of him. Two angry Weasleys would be too much.
"Potter, Elle!" called Professor McGonagall, and a girl with braids walked fast toward the stool with the sorting hat.
"Good," Ginny's smile grew a bit more confident. "Do you want to go to the gardens, maybe?"
Seamus only grunted without taking his eyes from his book. Harry had never seen him so interested in his schoolwork before. He thought about asking him what was going on but decided against it. He was busy with his own things, anyway. He didn't need to add more problems to his life right now.
"Shut up. That never happened, Potter," Malfoy spat, with rage showing in his eyes. "
"Yeah, he looks happy, doesn't he?" Harry laughed. He took his uniform robes off and untied his Gryffindor tie.
"What the hell, Hermione?" he hissed, getting pissed off. Why were they talking about this, and why was he so surprised to hear it?
"Harry, look!" Ron called him from the other side. For once, he and Hermione looked like they were being civil; at least, they were standing next to each other, both grinning.
Did he have a type, though? And why was he thinking about that now?
"I'll be back in a minute," said Harry absently. He didn't know where he was going, but he knew what he was looking for. Or
He took his time with a hot shower. It helped him to relax a bit. He changed into his Quidditch uniform and went to the kitchens where the elves gave him some toast and tea. On a normal morning he would've eaten much more, but right now he didn't think he could stomach a full breakfast right now.
"Malfoy?" Harry said, straightening his glasses and rubbing his forehead with his hand.
There was a silence that Harry could only describe as awkward. Ron, who was sitting at Harry's right side, cleared his throat rather loudly. Ginny blushed, to Harry's surprise, but managed to send a glare at her brother's direction.
They all watched Ginny on her broom. Most of them were in shock to see her talent, but Harry was just glad she could show her skill this morning.
"Ron!" Hermione and Ginny shouted, and Elle giggled, her hands covering her smile.
He got into the carriage, where Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville stopped what they were doing to stare at him. Only then he noticed something.
Thirty minutes later and a dozen failed attempts to tame his messy hair, Harry was ready to face the real world. He found his family eating breakfast at the dining table. Elle talked between mouthfuls of food, while both Lily and James hummed and smiled from time to time.
Elle was clutching at Harry's sleeve when they got into the train, and he felt a rush of affection towards his little sister. She could be a bit intense, but he would die for her. She needed her big brother now and he liked to be there for her.
"Harry, come on! We're going to be late!"
"He's done that before. He's put you in danger before," Harry replied.
She turned to look at him, and Draco noticed that her clear light eyes were watery. He felt very awkward; his mother never showed so much emotion and he didn't know how to deal with it.
"You really didn't know?"
Malfoy seemed to consider this, but he sneered. "You're only joking. Your ego wouldn't allow it."
"Are you okay, Harry?"
Hello again! This chapter is from Draco's POV and I hope it gives a little more context to the story.
Merlin, he hated those eyes. Did he? Yes, he did!
He sighed, and Hedwig pecked softly at one of his fingers.
"Uh. I- you're an amazing girl, you know that. And I'm happy you and Dean are together. He's a good bloke."
King's Cross was as crowded as every year on September 1st. Harry was the first to reach the Platform 9 3/4. Elle had experience walking through the barrier so she crossed it as smoothly as every older witch or wizard would.
"Oh."
"He's with his new girlfriend," the bloke said in a mocking tone.
Ginny turned around and walked away. Harry could see her face; her eyes were a mix of anger and sadness. Harry decided that he had to fix it. He had to talk to her, make her understand that whatever had happened between them couldn't take her away from reaching her goals. She was an amazing player, and Harry wouldn't lose her over a stupid misunderstanding.
He didn't, as a matter of fact, but he wasn't going to the common room yet where there were lots of first years making noise and running around. Neville was with Dean and Seamus playing some sort of muggle game with cards, and Luna was at the Ravenclaw table; lecturing an unimpressed second-year girl about something Harry couldn't possibly imagine. So he ended up going to the gardens with Ginny.
"Well, of course, it had to be you, Potter," Malfoy sneered. Harry rolled his eyes. Why did it have to be like this with him?
And then he walked out, leaving Harry alone.
"Yeah, I'm fine," he said, smiling weakly, directing his eyes on her once again.
"Come see!" Hermione exclaimed and waved her hand.
Draco felt a surge of anger. There she was, deciding what kind of feelings he should have and for how long he should have them. She left the room, leaving an invisible trace of expensive perfume that made Draco want to scream.
"Well, at least he hasn't come to bother us yet," said Hermione with a scowl. Draco Malfoy was one of the very few topics of conversation Hermione really hated. It was understandable, as Malfoy had been particularly nasty with her for being a muggle-born. He had called her a mudblood in second year. In third year, Hermione punched him in the face and Harry would lie if he said he hadn't enjoyed it.
He took out his clipped photos and looked at them for a long time.  He wasn't in the mood to start touching himself this time though. He felt too empty to do anything, and Harry Potter's carefree smile seemed so unattainable -  more than ever before.
Harry turned and saw Lavender Brown walking by with her friends, giggling like crazy. Ron’s jaw dropped, looking after her. Harry just rolled his eyes. It was true that Lavender had never spoken to any of them, though, so it made sense that Ron was shocked. He wondered for a second if he should feel jelous because she hadn't looked at him, but he found that he wasn't.
"I thought something bad had happened."
"You're welcome," he hesitated, and Ginny turned to leave, but he couldn't leave things like this. "Ginny, wait!"
"Well, yeah. I can't do it. You go tomorrow, you'll do great. I'm staying. This is my final word about it."
"Hey, sorry I left earlier," Harry said when he put her back on the ground. She bit her lip.
"What?" he asked.
Harry couldn't help his smile, feeling as if all his problems had vanished suddenly. He really missed his godfather and Moony. He'd be lost right now without them. He wished he had them with him right at that moment.
He wished he could just obliviate himself, or something equally effective. Perhaps that was the only possible way to forget about Potter. With a yawn, Draco contemplated some reading on how to forget about a particular person, but in dreams, he knew he wouldn't be doing anything to forget.
They both laughed while they walked and when they got to the Fat Lady, they were lucky enough to have a third-year Gryffindor nearby who already knew the password. Harry had totally forgot about that little detail. He never learned.
It was Ron and Lavender Brown.
"Harry!" Hagrid roared and lifted himself off the ground when Harry went to hug him.  Neville and Seamus were the only ones there with him, waiting for the other students to arrive.
"Just because you know I'm better than you-"
"Don't worry, Elle. You'll stay with us now, but soon enough you won't even remember me as you'll have lots of friends."
He rested for a few more minutes, enjoying the calmness of the lake. When it was time to go back to the castle, he stood and brushed the back of his robes with his hand. Then, he proceeded to walk as he tried to find his pocket to put the letter where it belonged.
"But it's our first day-"
Hermione was great at talking, and Harry remained silent, barely hearing her voice while his eyes scanned the crowd. He could see Ron and the rest of his family. They weren’t hard to miss, because all of them had bright red hair. The twins and Percy weren’t there though. It was only Ron, Ginny, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
Last year had been very intense with all the studying for the OWLS, as those results often determined what classes you would take afterward. What subjects you were best at and what your abilities were.
you looked a little, dopey? Like, if you were- you know."
Harry woke up earlier than necessary. He was bursting with energy but didn't want to go out there anytime soon. He had the feeling he would do everything wrong. Would Professor McGonagall be proud of him? She wouldn't choose him to be captain if she thought he couldn't make it. Right? But, what if she was wrong?
"Harry, I want to talk with Sirius!"
"I mean, I suspected it? I think? But I- I never-"
"I don't want this to be awkward."
He picked up his cloak and without bothering to cover himself with it, he ran out of the train and went to find the carriages who took them to Hogwarts from Hogsmeade.
"Okay, I have to go, Elle wants to talk with you," said Harry to Sirius, who smiled softly.
The air was colder than he expected, or maybe it was just his foul mood. He could see the carriages, which as always, were pulled by some weird creatures called
"I know you are, Draco," she whispered and rose from the bed with elegance as if she wasn't about to cry. "By next year, you will forget all about that boy. As I told you, it's just a silly infatuation."
"Oh," he managed to say. He was too stunned to articulate a word.He hadn't thought about the quidditch team in a long time.
Hi! Second chapter, hope you guys like it! :)
He washed his face and let out a long sigh. His eyes were okay, he thought. Bright green, just like his mum’s. Cho had commented on them in fourth year. Harry chuckled at the memory of her. He had liked her, but she had a crush on an older bloke and Harry couldn't compete against that. It hadn't been as traumatic as he'd expected, though. He'd had forgotten her, and now...
"Harry's the captain."
Harry saw Hedwig fly away with his letter until she disappeared in the horizon. Now it was time for real life. First day of school and all.
Malfoy snapped his head up to look at him. "What do you mean?"
"I was just- forget it. It's almost time."
"What the fuck- who's there?"
The air outside was cold and fresh. Harry sighed and thought of how much he wanted to play quidditch with Malf- he shook his head. This was getting ridiculous. He turned to look at Ginny, who looked away and blushed.
"What?" Hermione shrieked.
?" Hermione looked scandalized.
"I know, I know. Nobody wants summer to end, right?" he laughed again, and for the first time, Harry noticed that his eyes were grey. Like Malfoy's. Well, of course, his godfather and his enemy were related, after all. Sirius was cousins with Narcissa, Draco Malfoy's mother. So he was like an uncle or cousin or something like that. Pureblood families were odd.
The next day, he and Malfoy were already fighting again. They were both captains and they wanted to do their tryouts for their respective teams on the same day and at the same time.
