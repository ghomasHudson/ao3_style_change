My mind went completely blank when Draco let go of my hand. And I didn't pay attention to anything that happened after that. Only a few things.
Draco getting significantly better at piano because yes. He uses it as a release now. I based my writing of his part off of the first half of La Valse D'Amelie by Yann Tiersen. So give that a go if you want to hear what Draco and Harry heard. (In case timelines are unclear, Draco has been practicing piano for a a little over a month, and this piece is ideal for people of his estimated skill level.)
ANNOUNCEMENT 2) Please comment on this chapter notifying me if you, amazing readers, would like me to include an organized full timeline of the events of this book to keep you on track for the next book. The timeline would be released as an extra chapter (Chapter 62)
"W-Well, since we're such good friends," she said while flipping her messy hair, "I think she'd quite appreciate it if I took you down for her!"
Before long, we found ourselves in pretend-Hogsmeade again. Just like yesterday, there were loads of people in Spiritwear and fake Hogwarts uniforms. We explored more, finding the different spots where guests pretended to perform magic, stopping for a refreshing non-alcoholic ButterBeer, and catching sight of the Frog Choir, too.
"I need to go transfigure my arms, I'll be in the room. Go ahead and open the door." He told me, before racing to my room where his wand is. I heard more knocking, and quickly made my way to the door, wondering what on earth Maria could be so urgent for.
"The water is cold!" I broke out in giggles, knowing how ridiculous it sounded, but it was true! "This water must've been taken from the Antarctic," I mumbled, earning more laughter from Draco.
So now Harry is in therapy again! I wonder why... But! Things are going to go a bit different, and absolutely not to Harry's liking.
"I understand that you may not be ready to talk about it. Things like that can take time to process." She explained. "You won't have to worry about telling me until we're ready to talk about it more." I swallowed, feeling a slight relief come over me.
"Two hours ago. I just got back from talking to those two idiots," I explained, gesturing to the case files he had.
I jolted in my seat at the sudden sound of a voice in my head. It was the hat; Harry and Dad had told me about it.
"Ma-Draco, eat." Said Hermione. I looked up at her and glared, before turning to Weaslette sitting next to her. Her gaze was one of pure hatred, and I can easily say It's mutual. I abruptly stood from the table and stormed down to the basement, grumbling to myself.
Once I got to my room, I sat on my carpet and gripped a fistful of woolly fabric in my hand. I felt my eyebrows knit together.
"Mate." That familiar face was Wendy. He walked toward me, and I winced at the harsh sounds of his well-polished shoes clacking on the wooden floor. "Ted, you're late for breakfast! It's 8:30 and classes begin in 30 minutes, as you should know by now," he huffed, crossing his arms. My eyes widened, and I groaned, bringing a hand up to rub my eyes.
I resided in the spot next to Harry, wrapping my arms around him from behind and bringing him closer to me. I felt his arm twitch, and I decided to break the silence between us.
"What is it with this trend of yours: calling me dad. What happened to dada?" I avoided his question, sitting on the couch. He sat down beside me.
I looked around, seeing no one I didn't recognize. Draco and Scorpius were still sat by Astoria's grave, and they were the only people I could find at all. I heard what sounded like a rapid chirping, and a tick. I looked around, spotting a swish of blueish-black. My eyes widened in realization as I sprung to my feet, pointing my wand out, watching as a blue and white light blasted from the tip, causing the small creature to grow. I came face-to-face with white curly hair, a green coat, and pointed glasses.
"Oh, he's... we haven't really talked much this summer. Just a few letters here and there. I guess we'll catch up a bit more in two weeks when school starts again."
"H-he, he helped me once-twice! So what... isn't that... What's so special about that anyway? F-friends can, well they can help other friends!" I said in a frustrating manner.
"Hello Teddy! How was your summer?" Gabriel sauntered through the compartment door, hauling his trunk into the overhead compartment.
"That's not what this is about right now. I'd rather not talk about that. I- just..." He shut his eyes tight and his head was hung low.
"So what're you listening to? A-Amour... Ey-tur-no?" I asked, holding the radio and ejecting the disc that was in. I stepped just a bit away from the spot I was in, hopefully luring Gabriel out of his cave.
"Harry," she turned off the light and closed the door, coming over to me. "How are you?" I walked towards her as well, not wanting her to walk the extra steps. She really does look like the baby is coming any day now. We hugged briefly.
"Are you serious, Harry? What is it that makes you not want to snog for an entire week?" I said, frustrated.
"I'm here. Let's take a walk and get some air." I suggested, pulling on a coat and shoes. Harry got up, doing the same, and I saw him grab his wand.
I soon stood, taking a last sip of water before making my way to the front of the Ministry, where swarms of people and reporters for
"You know when you're trying to figure out how to un-traumatize your son, the voice of your boyfriend becomes significantly more annoying than it usually is."
"Hey, hey," I said with a calm whisper. "It's alright. Remember, it's just your body reacting to the change. It's alright, it's no big deal. See? The stain is gone." I said, gesturing towards his red pajama pants with green dragons on them.
"Bullshite. You never finish your plate of food. The least you can do is eat at every meal." He protested. I shot out of bed, walking up to him.
After an argument between the two, Draco did indeed lock himself in the room with me and just... sit, staring at the wall. He went to sleep without another word, but I could somehow tell he didn't want to be alone while staring at the wall. So, I stayed with him in silence. Of course, at the beginning, I had tried to ask him questions- tried to see what was going on. He never answered. Like I said... odd.
"No, no! Lettuce, get- down! Off the table!" He then zoomed past us holding a tiny white cat, who had a bit of chicken still in its mouth. He put it in a cage in the corner of the room, muttering. "That damned- ugh, It even scratched me." Scorpius furrowed his brows in anger, walking towards the kitchen. I followed suit, sitting next to him, across from Uncle Harry. Draco soon caught up to us, sitting down in front of Scorpius.
I've never been one for Magical creatures, having been believed to be one in what felt like ages ago. But I can't help but feel butterflies in my stomach when thinking of a dragon; such a large and fearsome creature that would kill you in seconds, but kept in control, so the ordinary could see it up close. It was thrilling to be so close to such a dangerous thing.
I've learned to control it quickly, for Scorpius, but now I wonder if maybe I forced myself to get over it a bit soon. He doesn't know about the war, yet... nor does he know the part I played... I don't want him to know. I don't want his view of me to change. But I also don't want him to pay the consequences of my past... and yet no matter what happens, he will.
When I felt the cool concrete of a wall against my back, I closed my eyes, letting out a large sigh. I heard the toilet flush, but I knew I hadn't flushed it. I heard a soft rhythmic thud going away, then coming back, and a piece of thin, smooth glass was pressed against my lips. I drank grateful amounts of the water, but It only took my dirty feeling and washed it down to my gut. I was still itchy- Incredibly. I felt goosebumps come across me, and I twitched.
I closed and opened my eyes, trying to take in Dr. Gilroy's words, and trying to process how quickly she'd spun an entire analysis of me.
"I love you. Hug?" I said, kneeling to his level. He walked over with his knees, falling into a hug with me. I took it gratefully.
I looked at him, and the only thing that was coming through my mind was that I really, really wanted a hug. A proper one. I softly nudged him, signaling that I wanted him to move. At first he moved over a tad, but I kept nudging him.
"You know, when you were a baby, you fit between here-" I pointed to the inside of my elbow- "and here." I pointed to the palm of my hand. "I think you may have grown up a little bit since then."
"Some of them look different." I commented curiously. "They look like mine." I specified. My arm went up next to Draco's. I placed them side by side. Most of his scars were more thick, more lasting. Mine were thin, needle-like lines, scabbing over, and eventually fading unless I slowed the healing process by picking at them, making myself bleed through an old injury. Another difference: mine were everywhere, residing in chaotic positions with little-to-no structure. His seemed to vaguely outline the dark mark. I noticed those scars of ours that looked the same. His were incredibly faint though. They were merely lines of discoloration. I had very few that way: old and mostly healed.
I inhaled, responding: "At the moment, there is no evidence suggesting that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy pose any threat to the public, the Statue of Secrecy, or anybody else-"
The next several weeks turned out in stark contrast to my usual. Draco tried something new with me almost every time that I showed the signs of having another fit. The first time, I was irritated at myself for not taking swift action against Rita Skeeter, as I concluded after her latest Daily Prophet article, along with the Ministry losing their heads over her getting away. That day, Draco showed me how he'd begun learning piano. He let me smash the keys in awful cacophonous chords, and he also taught me some basics- I learned that I have 'an awful sense of rhythm' in Draco's exact words.
I stumbled backwards, landing on the wall with a loud thud, followed by the dropping of several bottles of soaps and shampoos.
." Is this... Scorpius. they haven't stopped talking about him... I felt the color drain from my face. The title continued with
"When I was younger, it would turn into this... evil man from the past. You'll learn about him before you get to school. I have books about it that you can read before you start at school. You're just a bit young right now."
That also brought about the topic of Astoria. And, eventually, Petunia, Harry's aunt, brought up the battle. I learned that she was Lily Potter's sister, and that she knew Snape, who she also, quite hesitantly, asked about. I swallowed hard, explaining he didn't survive.
"I'll be right behind you, Ted." I looked up at him, swallowing my nerves, then I looked at Andromeda, standing right behind him. I gave a timid nod, adjusting my grip on my trolley. I took a deep breath, staring at the barrier with determination. I can do this. I broke off into a run. The arrier getting closer, closer, closer. I closed my eyes upon what would have been impact, but instead I felt a sort of suction throughout my body, and came out of the other side.
"Monday?" I answered. Draco stepped into the conversation, sensing the unease, or rather, the tension between me and Ron.
I made my way up the stairs slowly, letting my hand rest on the guardrail so I could feel the patterns of the wood beneath my fingertips, and so I could feel the weight of my body on each foot as I went upwards.
Scorpius leaned into me as we sat looking at the credits and paying no attention to them. My mind drifted to what Harry had voiced earlier, and I felt a glum feeling come over me.
After a while of the two of us taking in the sunset that -though seeming impossible- was soon to end, I felt a soft, gentle, quick kiss on my neck. I turned to meet Draco's eyes. Somehow, the silver-grey of his eyes kept me in my daydream.
I almost want to say that nothing matters, that I can't do anything that will matter anymore. They're wrong to still think me a savior... to have
Draco was yelping in happiness, claiming that it was a very welcome refresher to contrast the smoldering heat, but I just found myself shivering and hugging myself while I stared at a blurry figure of Draco Malfoy.
There were some nights where Aunt Petunia was, on absolutely no terms, allowed to be disturbed. Not even by Dudley. She would sit in her rocking corduroy recliner, hugging a dark bottle of alcohol, and she would listen to the same man singing about his sorrows all through the night. It was those times in particular when even the sight of me would cause her to go off on a screaming crying rampage. She would tell me it was my fault that I lived with her, that it was my fault my mum died.
. As soon as I felt myself land I took out my wand and urgently cast "muffliato" to silence the room. In an instant I let my wand clatter to the ground as I lowered myself, I let my tears flow freely and let escape a heart-wrenching scream that held all of my pain and guilt.
"You know, Scorpius, there's a constellation with your name too." Harry said, I held back a smile while admiring how at peace he looked with the sky.
Slowly I became a small ball under the covers and I tried to squeeze my arms to get rid of that nagging feeling. My breaths quickened as I began to cry silently; squeezing myself tighter. As if I was trying to comfort myself, when the truth is, I was trying to stop myself from going and marking myself up. My body shook as I curled tighter crying more. I can't believe Hermione saw me earlier. That I seemed like a shell of myself at dinner. That I'd allowed Malfoy's simple gesture of assistance to tip me over the edge. Before I knew it, I'd fallen asleep that way.
Once the bell rang, we looked at each other and sighed, getting off the grassy hill we were sitting on. We walked back to the group of students now leaving the class. There were some looks, but nothing I couldn't handle, along with some giggles from the girls. Victorie gave a delicately nervous laugh, and my cheeks grew hot soon after. I felt her fingers brush against mine. I kept my hands at my side, rubbing them against my robe. I exhaled sharply.
I looked back to Draco, who was now fully staring at me, seeming to catch my procrastination in taking even a single bite from my untouched plate. Well, it wasn't untouched, just uneaten- but I had definitely been mixing and pushing the food around into a big lump, making it look less appetizing. Somehow though, it made my stomach clench as I was greeted with the familiar feeling of hunger that no longer only made me hurt, but made me tremble from lack of nutrients.
"It's a long story, Ted. Don't worry about it, though. As I've told Draco," he turned over to him dramatically, but Draco wasn't looking. Harry turned back to me. "With a little bit of time, everything will be fine again." Harry said it as though he wasn't only telling me that, but Draco too. "Don't you agree, Teddy?"
Soon enough we were all in an office room, holding onto a string that connected to an extendable ear, strategically hanging around the door frame of the bedroom where Harry and Wea-Ginny were talking.
"Hello Andromeda, I-" Draco tried to say, before Scorpius came running to him, engulfing him in a hug.
"Not now Teddy," I interrupted, keeping a piercing glare on an absolutely bewildered Malfoy and a confused Malfoy Jr, who were stood just a few feet away. "Thank you, though."
," I protested. "If you aren't feeling up for it, then you really shouldn't be going." Telling him about my dream from last night will have to wait.
"It just didn't feel right." He whispered with a shaking voice. "What they wanted me to do made me feel like I deserved to die. Helping them... I-" he took a shaking breath.
My look of bother, annoyance, and disgust at who could have interrupted such a calm and relaxing day promptly faded to that of fear as the door busted open with a loud protest by the house consisting of creaks, a blast, and a cloud of dust and pollen from the outside. Dread filled me to the brim as I heard the deep, scruffy voice of a man on the other side of the doorway, monotonously and plainly stating, with a boring tone of practiced, refined and unwavering professionalism:
"Potter?" I heard a man say. My eyes shot up and the both of us stood and let him lead us to a room with a desk, chair, and couch in it. It was nicely decorated too, it was meant to help you feel comfortable, I guess.
"If you really don't want to sleep in the same room as Teddy, you can stay here. Do you want that?" I thought for a second before I shook my head.
"What?" I chuckled. "I slept over for the first three days of break when you, your dad, and Uncle Harry picked me up from the station," I responded, losing track of the ball, causing it to bounce twice. I groaned, then gave Scorpius the ball for his turn.
"Ted..." She whispered as both of us stood in front of our desks. I faced her for a few moments, but the reflection of the classroom's firelit lamps on her face, her eyes, was too much for me to bear. I glanced away, gulping, taking a hold of my materials.
I paused, softly flipping over the pages, regaining what memories I had lost about this book, the images slowly coming back.
Today, things were going as usual. I woke up with Draco by my side, and we went downtown for a while, noticing the significant increase in traffic around. We had visited a Nautical museum with Scorpius, and he loved learning about all sorts of things, from the history of ships, to the construction of ships. The museum closed fairly early, at four o'clock,  and now we were home. Draco and I were getting ready to prepare dinner while Scorpius took a shower. Everything was going well. Things were good. I couldn't have asked for a calmer time in my life. It all abruptly ground to a halt as soon as we heard a furious banging from the front door, and Draco opened it, unknowingly letting in the worst news I'd received since the war ended.
The second I became publicly visible, I straightened my posture, keeping my chin up, and my notes close to me, ignoring the deafening cacophonous buzz and camera flashes aimed in my direction, remembering to keep my breathing steady, my appearance professional, and my voice confident. I stepped up to the previously set up podium, where I placed my papers and my wand, after casting an amplification charm on my voice.
"So, you have several people at home who would like to see you, including Teddy... would you like to go home now, or do you want to do something, just you and me, before we go home to them?"
"I don't want breakfast." I mumbled to him, still feeling slightly disoriented and weak. He gave me a raised eyebrow.
I took a bite of food before looking around table. The boys acted and ate as though nothing was going on. I wonder how they can't feel the tension. Then again, maybe that's a good thing. Ginny has half a fork of eggs resting on the plate, her hand lingering around the forks handle. Her eyes were fixed on Harry. You could see the wheels in her head turning, I wonder what it is she thought at that moment. I quickly glanced over to Harry. He wasn't even on the same planet as the rest of us. His hands were folded on his lap, and he stared intensely at the plate in front of him. The plate he'd barely touched.
Any reply I had, turned into putty, sticking to my throat and sliding away from my grasp as the air choked me.
I noticed Granger and the Weasley's sharing looks with each other. Granger and Weasley would look at each other, then the pair at his sister, then the three of them would look at Potter. Who still numbly sat at the table. Pretending to be present in everything, including their little visual conversation. This happened more than once, in exactly the same way every time. It was annoying. But it also made me wonder why Harry... looked so lifeless, as though these 10 years killed him twice.
"Hey, Ted... you alright?" Luca said, taking his arm away from my shoulders and looking at me directly. He wasn't making any expression, he was just... looking, and I got to see his features again.
"Harry, I love you, but I'm sick of the sour mood. You accepted this case. Stop giving us grief over what Kingsley wants you to do." Ron said. I blinked, looking at him in disbelief.
My throat closed up and I snapped my eyes open, attempting to ground myself and breathe. I squeezed my hands tighter. I was a horrible person. And I never did anything to redeem myself. I'm still a horrible person.
"Since when do you read?" I asked with a small smile. He glanced up, dog-earing the page he was on before closing the book.
"Bailamos  en circulo!" [Lets dance in a large circle!] Exclaimed one man from the kitchen, coming over and setting his beer on the counter. I recognized him from that birthday party. It was 'Tio Pito'.
"Uh Scorpius," Harry began. "You don't need to worry about that. Your father is probably one of the last people they would try to take," he attempted to explain.
"ButterBeer is barely alcoholic anyway. I'm surprised we in the Wizarding World haven't done that already," commented Draco.
The house awoke to a loud crash followed by the screeching of the owl, and a violent mew of the cat. Harry and I glanced at each other briefly before storming out of the room, and I could remember hearing Scorpius' footsteps following behind us.
I raced in the same direction, but too late, as he was already holding all the forks, a triumphant grin from ear to ear. His raw energy made me struggle to hold back a grin. We set the table together.
"Hey, Mate. I convinced Kingsley to let me help you out until the end of the week, when I leave." Ron pulled up a chair and sat beside me, putting two other case files down on the space beside the desk. One for Euphemia, and the other for Thorfinn.
That evening, deep into the night, I woke to an empty bed, and an empty room. The light from the bathroom, along with the sound of running water was what told me about Harry's whereabouts. Opening the door quietly, heavy steam hit my face. Harry's fogged up glasses were folded neatly on the sink, and his night clothes were folded beside them. A towel had been placed over the toilet, and through a crack between the shower curtain and the wall, I could see Harry's eyes were closed, his head tilted upwards as he let the water run over him.
"Alright, Scorpius. This is going to be your first year. Don't forget, I provided you with money. It's shrunken and in your pocket, and I charmed it to grow back to normal size when you take hold of it."
During the interview with the hospital's psychologist, their psychiatrist, what they called a case worker, a doctor, and a nurse, Harry had been probed with what even I would have considered invasive questions that could no doubt slip someone such as Harry back into a harmful mindset. Harry had clarified that no, this was not a deliberate attempt at suicide. And when asked if, given a blade, he would do it again, he hesitated. But of course, it's not like people would readily give him a blade, but then again, I guess being handed a blade is akin to being in the kitchen, eyeing the paring knife. They asked again: if he were let go, would he actively try to find a way to hurt himself? He said no. They asked if he had any plans for suicide, such as a planned date, or chosen method. Again, he said no.
In an area entirely dedicated to dinosaurs, we stopped to take a rest, and to use the loo. Looking at the map, we saw that the next area we were going to find was indeed the place we had to visit all along, so we took advantage and cast a wordless, wandless silencing charm, explaining everything to the kids.
"I love you too, son... now, what do you say we finish packing your trunk, yeah? And then we can go to bed."
Everything moved slow and everything was gentle and Harry was still half asleep but I wouldn't trade it for the world. I closed my eyes and let my mind melt into this bubble where it was only us. However, my escape died away when Harry stopped our kissing, resting our foreheads together.
couldn't give less of a bloody shit that somebody is trying to cover up his motives and... in some sick, twisted way,
At that moment, I locked eyes with Victorie, who had just turned her head, and was apparently sitting in that nook, but I hadn't noticed. Gabriel gave me an acknowledging smile, then turned away to talk to Wendy and Bonnie again. She smiled softly, and waved me over, telling her friends to give her a minute, presumably.
"Harry, you look absolutely ghastly, sit down, please." I gently took his arm and sat him on the couch. "Let's catch up. How have you been the last few months?" I asked, a serious and persistent undertone to my voice.
"Malfoy?" I was surprised to hear that. He's not supposed to come until Saturday of next week. Today is Thursday.
"And you got Apollo, and Lettuce, was it?" I approached his bed, sitting down on the bed frame, making a small creak as I did. Scorpius sat up, looking up at me in joy as he searched the room for his cat, who was sleeping in a corner.
"Because. The guy leads! Don't fight me on this," Gabriel said among contagious laughter, which all of us were enveloped in even as he was trying to teach me the steps, in a cacophony of claps and twirls "No's" and "You're doing it wrong's" and near trips.
"What the hell were you thinking?!" I whisper-shouted through my nervous breaths. "You know how I feel about heights, you bloke. If I've made you mad or upset you, you don't have to show it like- like that!"
"Harry don't ever blame yourself for your struggles... I just want you back... I want you to be okay, that's all I want." I closed my eyes, letting tears spill. I hugged her tighter, masking my trembling. I breathed a shaky exhale.
"Harry," Draco began softly, putting his hands on my shoulders, letting them slide down slightly. "If you want to go to this child's birthday party, I will not stop you. I have absolutely no qualms about you and Dudley building a relationship. But please be mindful of your health. Are you sure you are okay with being around his parents?"
"Please, please... just talk to me. Don't do this to yourself." I heard him whisper. "Don't do this to me." I cried harder. I swear I don't mean to hurt anyone but myself. I don't mean to hurt Draco... But here he is, crying because of me- again.
We really took our sweet time with dinner. We were enjoying each other's company. But alas, soon enough, Ron and Hermione appeared through the floo with Scorpius, and our day ended. Draco guided his son up the stairs to get ready for bed, meanwhile I sent the dishes to wash, and organized the last bit of things we'd forgotten about.
"Only trying?" I said in disbelief. I then sat down beside him, realizing I may have unintentionally sounded accusing and just a bit harsh.
"You couldn't open the bag, could you?" I accused, my smile going from fond to mischievous. Draco gave a look of deep offense.
"Come here." I said, leaning in to give him another kiss. Moving on top of him. He kissed back, and we continued like that for a few seconds. It was slow. I wanted more. He pushed away gently.
"Excuse me?" I said, resting my head on my hand, propped up by my elbow, eyeing Harry with a look that said
"Now belittling yourself is no way to go about it. Let's elaborate on the first thing you mentioned: what if he doesn't love you. Is there anything specific that you think may be causing this insecurity? Perhaps something that takes place in your relationship, or something one of you says?"
"Please see someone... you can't do stuff like this. Especially not with the baby." I looked at her in the eyes.
"Teddy!" Screamed Scorpius as he ran over to Teddy.  "Look I made up a game for us to play come to my room!"
"It's your family... not mine. But whatever you choose, I have to know, because Maria is ready for Scorpius." He said, closing the book he'd just finished its second time, getting up, and putting it on a shelf in his room.
More people are going missing... what will this mean for Rose, Scorpius, and teddy going back to school?
I walked in the hallway of the second floor, trying to make my way to the dungeon where the Hufflepuff common room is. There was excited chatter coming from everywhere, kids running to catch up with their friends. I heard some talk about running to Flitwick's classroom to "call time", several carrying cases, both large and small.
"Goodbye then,"  said Ginny briefly as she gave me back my phone. She then asked Teddy for his hand and left with him.
Harry released my hand. I felt his come up to the nape of my neck, then up into my hair. Harry turned and placed a kiss on my head. "You're changing the subject."
I turned around in bed, seeing Harry asleep beside me. He looked peaceful, happy. He had a good nights sleep. That's his third in a row. I leaned up, and gave him a soft kiss.
Man, this vacation really isn't what they probably thought it would be. But, we do get a lot of questions answered regarding the books!
"You were in a bit of a daze." I heard Uncle Harry say. "Well... Draco said you wanted to talk? Do you want to possibly go upstairs?" I nodded, remembering why I was here. Andromeda kept insisting that I tell her why I would allow those boys to give me a black eye. I only want to talk to Uncle Harry though.
"I couldn't leave you. Never." Our fingers found each other's, loosely intertwining. I squeezed his hand three times. He returned it with one long squeeze.
With my wand, I hung them all up, and cast a cleaning charm on them all. Then, I cast a drying charm. Having them now all clean, I grabbed them again, going back inside, and hung them all in their respective places.
"Correct. And how far is that from your birthday?" I asked expectantly. Scorpius scrunched up his face, and began counting with his fingers.
Do you want me to keep you warm?" He continued in his laughter, hugging me from behind and planting a kiss just below my jawbone. I couldn't help but smile.
"Okay, but you told Kingsley that you were going to start this investigation from scratch. He expects something-
"Some Christmas eh?" I said, trying to lighten the mood. My face was still read from crying and my nose was still stuffed. I was also still shaking, but at least I'd stopped crying, at least I was starting to calm down again.
"Don't worry. You don't understand... we all love and care about you, and we don't want you to die. It was one thing protecting you from a dark mysterious wizard... but how are we supposed to protect you from yourself? Just... don't push us away anymore Harry."
"Scor, do you want some more mashed potatoes or chicken nuggets?" Uncle Harry asked Scorpius. I was half expecting Scorpius to not answer, but surprisingly, he did.
"I'm a horrible dancer." He said with a small chuckle. And well I wouldn't necessarily disagree with that.
"There..." I paused, not sure what I wanted to say at all in the first place. "I don't... Why else would it start hurting?" I managed to ask, looking at the three of them.
"No. I just wanted to do something with you. Come, to the backyard." He visibly relaxed, and I led him to my little set up, glancing towards him, where I saw a smile playing at his features.
He sniffled again, "But Scorpius," He sated, keeping his glance down the hallway, wiping his eyes again.
"Scorpius... Harry and I are..." he took a breath, casting a quick glance towards Harry. "in, love... with each other."
"Yeah... Scor, what? For real, you're never like this," I told him, hoping he might at least explain
"Everything was stressful... I had to do what he said, or... he-" Draco paused, looking around the room.
"Malfoy?" Said Ron in disbelief. I nodded and took a sip of water. He and Hermione now sat across from me in our dining room. After I'd sent the owl they insisted on coming to visit. They apparated here this morning.
"No. I don't..." I nodded numbly. the sound of blood rushing through my ears was the only thing I could perceive for half a second.
"Yes. Malfoy made sure I took them." I snapped before looking down, suddenly not wanting to finish my food.
"Okay. I do, too. And what do you plan to do about Harry's scar pain?" Hermione looked at me, nervous, almost.
"I hope this doesn't alarm you... I read the books, well, my daughter did. She seems to be one of many who believe you didn't kill anyone... would you like to elaborate on what that means?"
"And if you don't want them to be scared of you, let them be scared of me. Understood?" He gave a choppy nod.
From my head it shot like ice across to my veins, down my arms. Suddenly all of my scars singled themselves out on my arms, I fisted my shaking hands further, my nails moving past my chunks of hair, digging into my palms painfully. I hit my head slightly, pulling harder.
"So he's my cousin... once removed." I paused as if to make sure I'd done that correctly. And I wondered why my family hated my cousin to such an extent that she and her husband were cast away by us, how I never got to know Nymphadora and how she died before I could realize everything my family had done wrong to her.
"I.." Looking to the side, I began to make my leg bounce again. "I panic... o-or just... I-" A sigh escaped me. "I don't know how to describe it..." My heart was thumping loudly against my chest. I brought my hand up the scratch the back of my head briefly, lingering on the back of my neck, before I brought it down quickly. I squeezed Draco's hand tighter and scooted closer to him, so that our sides were touching. I was resisting the urge to pick at my scars out of nervous habit.
"This stuff is delicious!" Teddy had a cream mustache and a half-drunk ButterBeer in his hands. His hair was bright orange.
"He's sleeping. I'll be right there." Scorpius nodded and left the room. Now, I needed to get up. Slowly, I untangled myself from Draco, sliding out of bed and forcing myself to wake up fully.
"That was almost an eternity ago-" I began to retort, before my attention turned to Scorpius, who was distraught and confused.
This is the longest chapter yet (4,283 words)!!! And every chapter after this will be a minimum of 2,000 words. It just turned out like that. Things are getting heavy!
Christmas is in two days. I don't know how to feel about it. I haven't got a present for anyone important to me. Thinking back, the day Draco decided we should go shopping for presents, mostly for Scorpius, I had a panic attack- more than one. It was frustrating, and I was beyond upset with myself for letting it happen, for slowing the day down, and making it difficult for him. I didn't even get anything for anyone. That was one week ago.
"See you all later," said Draco, biding them farewell. They threw the floo powder, announcing the burrow, before vanishing in a green burst of flames.
"Well, at least she lasted long enough to provide an heir. And at least you didn't move on from her to a Mudblood." Her face screwed up in disgust as she spat the word out. My insides curled.
I didn't have it in me to look Draco in the eyes after what I'd said. I'd done good to avoid it all until now, It had been alright. Nobody needed to know my problems anyway. I walked away, my mind on autopilot, only having the sudden and intense desire for comfort as it's driving force.
"We're going to have to figure it out I presume, but it's not like we haven't done that before," answered Hermione.
"Obviously. But you don't need to respond; they're asking me now. They probably know you won't answer them. You might want to consider fixing that before the three of you have a falling-out." I said honestly, but it was true. At this point, everyone knows that The Golden Trio is falling to bits. It's weird to look at, especially from an inside perspective. If I was one of them I would have sent Howlers to Harry by now, expressing my anger at his ignorance. They obviously care about him, and they want him to be okay, but it's difficult when he keeps them as far as possible. It's even more difficult when you realize that he's opened up to me- their sworn enemy for the past eternity- before opening up to them. I finished and rolled up my parchment, tying it to the owl's leg, and letting it go.
"I know... I'm nervous about it myself," I began to explain. "But, I-I just... was wondering. I mean, last time, he wasn't... that bad. He seems to want to get to know me without combining his fist with my stomach." I let out a rueful laugh.
"No, it won't." I said, deciding to leave the part about steam coming from his ears out until after he took it. There's no need for him to be scared and make taking the potion more difficult. After all, it doesn't have the most pleasant taste.
"I ignored them... it hurt, it sucked, but I ignored them... you know... I have more experience with this when you think." I was confused. I know he gets the rumors and stuff. But that's it, right?
The champions reached their loved ones who were trapped at the bottom of the lake. As some people cheered with excitement, others cringed and looked petrified at the sight of those people held in stasis, and the monstrous Grindylows that kept watch over them.
"What about Muggle therap-" I cut myself off. We can't associate with the Muggle World anymore. We stayed quiet for a few seconds.
At this, Ron became even angrier, and asked accusingly: "Who? My family? What did we ever do to you-"
Weeks passed since Monday's Potions class. I occasionally see Aminata hurriedly walking about the halls, but she made a point of keeping herself and her friends out of my line of sight. The whispers and murmurs when I walk the halls have come back. But now, they stop when I'm close. I think I've... come to terms with what happened that day in Potions. I've grown used to the cutting whispers and stabbing stares. But there was still something I didn't expect, even after keeping a surprisingly level head: Luca never talked to me about the letter he received.
In a moment of bravery, I looked up and moved forward, his face inching ever closer to mine. I kept my arms stiffly at my side.
"How dare you?" He stared me down with this face saying he was irritated but utterly amused at the same time.
I was taken aback by the question, and decided to answer with a not-quite-lie. "Kind of. It's ok though. Besides, we had a lot of fun today. I'm happy." I said with a genuine smile.
"Harry, Ever since everything happened back at Hogwarts, you stopped talking to us. You left without a goodbye and you went off with Ginny... and an entire decade later, I hear that you ran into Malfoy at the market, and then about a month after that Ginny comes to us crying saying that you... How did this all happen? Tell me Harry. What did I miss? Where was your plan, or your thoughts..."
"Are you friends with her? Do you talk bad about me with her? About-" I held my breath. "I trusted you, w-we're best friends, why...?"
Draco somehow found a way to sneak out of the house and get me a present. It was a machine that released essential oils into the air. A diffuser. He claimed that 'It smells like flowers' and that it would help me relax. He said we would try it out together one day. Just, lay down and let the machine run. He said it would be nice.
It wasn't long before I found myself needing to suck in a breath. But with it, came broken and violent sobs that shook me to my core.
"Harry." I heard Dudley greet, a smile forming on his face. "Happy Christmas. Who did you bring with you?" I heard him ask. I opened my mouth to answer, but Draco beat me to it.
know why. He doesn't need my problems at the moment. He's tired and overwhelmed, and he probably hasn't had a single second to himself apart from when either he or Scorpius gets a shower. Ever since I started this entire disaster, he's been distant. And now with what happened to Scorpius, he's stuck in this endless cycle of having his son basically attached to him by the hip.
"I won't let them keep you, Harry. Don't worry. But you need to compose yourself. They need to ask you those questions again and if they see anything that they think means you will hurt yourself, they won't hesitate to keep you, and I won't be able to stop them." He hugged me again. I returned it. "Don't worry. You'll be going home today."
"Gryffindor," the girl coughed while the curly haired girl beside her patted her back. "Jesus, Aaron, you don't have to call it that!" She began to laugh again.
"Welcome to another year at Hogwarts, school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Firstly, I would like to announce the arrival of our new teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor Colbus Gatedwarf." A large man with a tall hat and a black beard stood, presenting himself to be much taller than I had thought. Applause came across the hall, before he sat down again.
"No. It's... yes?" He huffed out a breath. "I don't know! I'm terrible at this, Harry, and Scorpius has no idea the person I was before him. He has no idea the things I said or did... they go directly against everything I've taught him. He looks at me and he sees a father who is kind and gentle and loving and who could never do anything so wrong... if I-
"I will, don't worry. And I'll explain things when I pick him up. Let him know I'm going to be a little bit late."
"Hey... can I talk to you?" I asked, nerves setting in. I need to do this, and who better than Draco to talk about it with? He's helped me a lot recently, and he's allowed me to feel comfortable around him too.
"Hey, hey relax. You have to realize she's just worried about you. If it means that much I'll tell her you don't want to speak with her at the moment, don't worry."
It was in that instant that I remembered the reason I had gone looking for Ron in the first place. I mentally cursed myself for having entirely forgotten about her for a minute.
I thought sourly, remembering my most recent encounter with Animata and her best friend Jill. They didn't do anything bad, just a simple shove and some words along the lines of 'Heard there's a full moon coming. Where do you go to transform?'
"I know... I know you. You aren't like that..." I heard the door open, and was faced with Ron, who looked to have been crying, like us. I got up, engulfing him in a hug, needing his comfort. We both cried. Ginny walked up to us, and we offered to add her to the hug, but she stood aside. After a while, I let go of Ron and sniffled.
"Well," he began slowly, not taking his eyes off me. I worked my jaw to ease some tension. "I don't really know anything about it, the other schools' students won't arrive until next month, but the winner is supposed to get eternal glory," he looked back around at the rest of the table. "And one thousand galleons worth of personal prize money."
out of line." I said, making a face like I'd taste something awful. "And you have the Aurors showing up out of nowhere to arrest him? In front of his son? A child?" The room was deafeningly still aside from Scorpius' sniffles and Sobs, accompanied by Draco's comforting him. "Have you even gotten closer to figuring out who caused this problem in the first place? Who wrote all of these books?" Kingsley and the American President both looked at me, baffled, and at a loss for words. "Yet you find it justified to waste your time, and mine, and frankly everyone else's time, arresting an innocent man. It's shameful." I spat.
"Okay." He gave me a quick tight hug before running upstairs to catch up with Teddy. I felt bad for lying. The truth is I know nothing about Harry and Ginny's relationship and I have no idea if they'll work this out... whatever 'this' is. I got up and put the remaining plates in the sink before casting a quick cleaning spell. Deciding to put the plates away, I first began opening cabinets to find the one where the plates and utensils were kept, thinking about how last night, somebody was by my side in the bed for the first time since Astoria passed. I pulled my thoughts away as something curious caught my eye. I found Harry's medicine organizer, completely full, including the tab that said 'Sunday', which is today. I took the container out before finishing putting everything in it's place. Then, I went upstairs to find Harry and give him his medication and some water.
This wasn't like my usual anxious trembling; this made me feel physically weak, weak to my bones. It made me feel weary, and almost sick.
A few moments passed before I realized I had been staring into the same puzzle piece I had been dragging around. I blinked a couple of times and quickly shook my head. Placing my hands on the edges of the chair, I breathed heavily, feeling my chest heave. I took another look at the puzzle, and resolved to complete it.
After eating my own breakfast with Scorpius, I did bring a small plate upstairs to Harry, who was sitting up, and who apologized profusely for his 'stupid inability to do the simplest things'. He ate a small portion of food, for which I was grateful, and I told him to take it easy, to rest for a while, and to let me help him get around, since it was painfully obvious that he isn't doing well, and his stubborn lack of eating was one of the main contributing factors.
A few moments later, Wendy batted a quaffle just as it was about to enter the hoop, and we cheered. "See?" I laughed as Luca bowed his head and sighed.
"If I may, doctor," both of us turned to Draco, who had taken the liberty to speak, and I felt a flare of anger rise and fall within me, because I just
After several moments of forced and concentrated breathing, I felt myself controlled enough to at least stand up and lean against the stall door as I wiped a stray tear, catching my breath, counting slowly in my mind.
After that, I went to my room and I saw Harry sitting by a transfigured bed. I looked at dada, who simply said "I told Harry to transfigure a bed for Teddy while you were in the loo." I kind of felt like Teddy was giving me this weird look, like he was sad at me. Dada seemed to notice though, because he said "It seems you're getting sleepy, eh?" Teddy said yes, with a nod, then Dada said:
She turned to face me again with a wild look. I could tell she was trying hard to hold back her tears.
I don't even know how I'd done it. He was gripping me harshly and I tried to fight his grip. The next thing I know, he was on the floor a few feet from me. It was almost as if I'd electrocuted him. But I swear I didn't do anything. He said otherwise though. And well, how else do I explain what happened? I hurt him and I don't even know how. He's right. I don't know how, but Uncle Vernon is right. I am horrible and selfish. I can't believe I actually tried to hurt him... even if I don't know how I'd done that.
"Well, it's tough, and it takes time, and it doesn't always stop you from worrying... but, I've basically just had to remind myself that..." he sighed, "life... isn't going to get good, and then stay good indefinitely. It goes up, and down, and up, and down... and in the end of the day... you just have to be happy about the good things you
Unlike most nights, I threw away the leftovers by hand, and then began to clean each plate, utensil, and cup by hand, as opposed to casting a cleaning charm. Then, I dried them by hand, and put them away. The methodical motion of my hand, the feeling of the soap and the sponge, being able to watch the filth go down the drain, it was oddly soothing. It let me breathe again, as though every breath before it had been a false one.
A shriek pulled me harshly from my thoughts. The swirling shards of sharp iron stabbing at and piercing my mind had come to a sudden stop. I was faced with Aminata on the floor, breathing heavily and soaking wet. The ingredients that were on my hands are in the cauldron, a tiny piece of a quill stuck on my right index finger. Slughorn was huffing as he ran over to fix the mess, but was caught off guard when...
I found myself trembling, and clenched my fists to stop it, determined to stay strong for my last days.
you can't have expected us to know, we had much more important things to worry about!" I shouted, swirling with emotions too intense to sit down with.
"Are you insane? The more time we spend the more time he could be doing Merlin knows what-" I stated sharply, forcing my tiredness away.
I thought, but kept it to myself, not wanting to worry about how many ways saying that could go wrong.
"Yeah, I've got it." I responded as I lifted myself from the couch. I opened the door to be greeted by Malfoy and his son. Malfoy dressed casually nice in a polo shirt and jeans, and his son similarly dressed. I could see faded lines where his dark mark used to be. I shuddered at the thought.
I slouched over the table, resting my head on my hand, still looking around the classroom until I heard a quiet thud next to me.
"Uh, Scor, stay here, I've got something for you." I gave him a pat on the knee before racing down the stairs, taking them two at a time, down to the kitchen. I rummaged through the cabinets until I spotted what I was looking for. I smiled in triumph when my fingers curled around the object. I fished it from it's tall shelf and ran back up to Scorpius, making it to him slightly out of breath, and with a smile that may have been inappropriate considering the atmosphere of the room. I quickly straightened up, catching my breath and holding it out for him to take.
At this his head snapped up. "Yeah. Teddy is great, the tutor is good at teaching him... he's learning to add and subtract fractions now."
I reached into the cabinet for a mug, while waiting for my tea to brew. I had woken up from another dream, and decided I would have myself something to drink so I could relax.
Each step up the stairs was too loud and creaky. Each passing second made way for a deep and growing buzz in my ears.
"And I want to do more. Go ahead and eat." He said softly. I sat down by the kitchen counter and began eating small bits as my mind wandered.
"That's amazing Scorpius," She said, smiling. I smiled back. "Did you know that I can play this game?" said Maria, pointing to the Mario racing game." I looked at her amazed.
I blinked, looking into his forest colored eyes, catching a glimpse of his scar, observing as he squinted slightly, like he always does without his glasses.
Disclaimer: Discussion of hospital environments, suicidal thoughts and tendencies, and self harm tendencies.
"Hey. What's wrong?" I said, putting my wand down, on the couch beside me, shifting to stand normally.
After getting dressed, I briskly walked to the Great Hall, hoping to get at least a bite of food before classes started. The halls were getting increasingly packed, everyone lining up to get into their classrooms. Along the hallway, the number of people kept growing into one particular spot, eventually partly blocking off the entrance to the hall. I had to sidle my way between people, getting looks as I did so. While making my way through the crowd, and getting stuck on one particularly impenetrable wall of students, I overheard some yells and raised voices different from everyone else's.
I nodded, moving to lay down on my side. My head still hurt. I felt Draco hug my entire body from behind, wrapping his free arm around my waist. I snuggled into the feeling. I'm safe. Nobody can come behind me. I'm comforted, I'm secure. I repeated that mantra to myself, trying to convince myself of it. And slowly, I fell back to sleep.
Still holding Victorie's hand, I stepped closer and closer to the stage, standing on the tips of my toes, trying to find Luca.
Draco, with a curious look on his face, said "I'll get it." before disappearing towards the front door. I heard a distant "Hello M-" followed by the loud voice of seemingly an old woman, cutting him off with "Move. I smell something wrong."
I figured it would be good to get my mind off of why Harry... has been so odd. "Of course! Hand me a toy."
I felt him stiffen under me, before he slowly moved to see me. His movement forced me to lift my head from the spot on his shoulder.
Later that night I put up a silencing charm in the bedroom and gave him my own sort of birthday gift. We both enjoyed it quite a bit, to say the least.
I've been in the cupboard for an unknown amount of time, I felt weak and heavy. I had nothing to do, nothing to say, nowhere to pee, and nothing to eat. The small space stank of urine and I could feel every slow beat my heart made. I lay curled up against the door, waiting for it to open. Hoping it might open soon. Uncle Vernon's words replayed in my head over and over.
I swallowed, my breath hitched, and I looked up to realize that everyone was looking at me, and Draco was shaking me gently, asking me a question.
"...Hi, Harry," she started, throwing a slight smile at me, retreating it just as fast as it came. I felt a tug at my sleeve from Draco.
"I think we'll be okay, Rose. You said so yourself, right?" I relaxed my position a little, tilting my head.
"Luna they're going to murder me. I've just had a fight with Ginny... I need to go." I said, getting up, looking everywhere for any sign of them.
window, the way he found me. I felt kind of helpless, like I shouldn't have been able to escape. I felt like Ron should have never tried to help me. I felt guilty for being grateful." I wiped my watered eyes.
"My friend is missing and I need to know if he turned up here. You are going to show me the record of people who have checked in within the last 24 hours. Understood?" His eyes were fear stricken.
"No, Harry! You don't! And you shouldn't! What happened was not your doing, and you cannot blame yourself for the outcome!"
"I need to look through my mail a bit more often," I mumbled to myself, tossing countless letters from strangers, and setting aside two particular ones, one from Millicent- or rather, Dudley- and one from Teddy.
He took a short breath, avoiding eye contact. I realized he was, once again, holding back his emotions. "Harry, what is it?" I pressed. My voice got lower and I burned my gaze into his eyes, growing concerned, yet staying calm. He, however, made a weak attempt to get away- truly quite feeble. I wasn't holding him tightly, yet his meager efforts got him nowhere. I lifted his chin, to see him more clearly.
I took a deep breath, glancing towards Draco quickly, who had gone with Scorpius to visit Astoria's grave. I turned my attention back to my parents, building up the courage to share my newly made decisions with them.
We just laid there for quite a while, both of us seemed to be grateful for the small moment of peace and quiet together. I reached up to play with his hair and he leaned into it, visibly relaxed. It wasn't until another half hour that we heard Scorpius loudly going about the hallway, probably to find out if I'm awake. I internally wished it was just me and Harry. We could stay like this forever without interruption, but alas, I had to get up, and so did Harry. When we were both out of bed I remembered he takes medicine that just so happens to not be here.
"Fancy? That's anything but fancy. You want me to show you fancy?" I got away from the window, towards my closet. "I can grab my dress robes, my Muggle tuxedos too-"
"Come on, it's important, Harry. Stop avoiding the conversation." I explained, allowing him to leave our backwards hug, taking me in for a proper one and resting his head on my chest.
"We both well know why we feel like this," snapped Harry, his mood shifting like night and day. "And it's not really something we can share with you." Harry's tone was a bit uneasy, and dripping with a forced calm I don't really see on him often.
"Who's... going to get them?" I asked, my fingers curling into a fist. Seeing as all of the ingredients are on the same shelf, it's fitting that only one person should get them. Saying nothing, she stared at me before turning on her heels and walking past me to the ingredient shelf, roughly shoving me with her shoulder. I looked to my right and saw Bonnie and Wendy, who were paired with other students and just finished gathering their ingredients, look at me with caution and concern. I pursed my lips in response. Wendy gestured with his head to Slughorn, who was helping a student who pricked her finger on a porcupine quill. I thought about it for a moment, but... No... I don't know what she will do when she finds me alone if I tell Slughorn. And what will I tell him anyways? That his perfectly poised star student is a bully and manipulative?
"Harry... we really need to talk."  Said Ginny from downstairs. I shot a look at Draco. He grabbed my hand
"Nothing really, sir." Ron spoke for us. I took in a breath I hadn't realized I'd forgotten earlier. "We're all just a bit tired, being at the park. We'll contact you tomorrow." Ron began to stand, reaching over to the fireplace.
"Just because you didn't like her class doesn't mean you can call her a complete fraud, Hermione. She's still made predictions- written prophecies." I argued, becoming increasingly irritated at her pettiness showing now of all times.
"You're in Slytherin!" She huffed, crossing her arms. Luca turned his head back, facing the stadium once again. He slowly turned his head towards her; his eyes bore no emotion, but he wore a smirk. He tucked his curls behind his ear.
What Scorpius said stuck to my mind. I knew that Teddy wasn't completely oblivious, but did I really affect him that much? That can only add to the infinite list of people I've disappointed in my life.
"Yeah. I guess." He said. I gave him a soft hug, accompanied by a quick comforting rub up and down his back.
"Nobody even knows what that means..." said Luca to no one in particular, but loud enough to be heard, rolling his eyes.
"But why did you mess around in the first place, Luca?" I took a deep breath for the first time in what seemed like an eternity.
Suddenly the door opened, and I felt my hair stand up and turn a slight orange, before I noticed Scorpius, and my hair fell back down.
"Oh, I've heard of that game! Luca and I have played it a couple times while we're bored or waiting to meet up with everyone else," I replied as we walked in.
"You have time to remember them. Right now you need to let yourself relax a little bit. You're a nervous wreck."
The various colors of my shirts and jumpers and robes all blurred and swirled as I allowed myself to fall into a sort of distracted, empty trance, feeling as my ears rang and my mind became numb. It felt as though I was floating. I was lost- almost asleep in my place.
After the ride, he looked as though he'd seen a ghost, and he promptly ran to the bathroom, where he sicked up in the toilet.
"When you showed it to me, last year... I, uhm, kept it safe. I tried to tell you you'd dropped it but you just kept going."
"Yeah. It was good to see you, Dudley. Good to see how you've changed." I told him with an almost business-like tone.
"Oh goodness, you finish up here, I'll clean Rose up." With an amused smile she picked up rose and took her to the room.
"You were brilliant out there! How you guarded and sent the quaffles hurtling towards the other team, that was brilliant!" Me, Luca and Gabriel nodded in agreement.
"Professor Trelawney? No." She shook her head, handing Rose the now prepared bowl of berries before walking to the living room. I followed her.
"Yes, you are. How soon is your birthday? What month are we in?" I stepped aside, so he could see the calendar stuck to the refrigerator that read '
"Andromeda says that he's always playing with his height and his hair and his face. Well, you remember; On the 22 of December when he came over for dinner, he was talking about how he loved making his hair turquoise... According to Andromeda, he hasn't been changing anything for a while." Harry explained. "Get dressed. Don't fuss too much, everything is going to go fine." He told me. I could see the hesitation in his eyes, and I knew he was ignoring that Grange- Hermione and Ron were bound to get here soon. I looked into Harry's eyes, and leaned in to give him a kiss. Just after our lips met, I heard a knock at the door, but I ignored it, wanting this to last. We pulled away after a moment, and he raised his eyebrow at me, probably wanting to continue.
"Harry you haven't spoken in a month," he whispered through a broken voice. "It scares me, not knowing what's going on inside your head... Harry I just want you to be okay.
I feel bad for thinking that. The two people I care about most need my help, and it's overwhelming. I don't have time for myself anymore. I'm always with Scorpius, or with Harry.
"So... library at eight? We can study for potions together." He said awkwardly, hands in his pockets. I didn't realize that we had stopped walking and were standing against the wall of a corridor. The halls were cleared minutes before.
I don't think I could properly describe the emotions that were swirling around this mercury eyes. I don't think I wanted to know what it was he was thinking as he penetrated my mind without the use of magic. I don't remember what I felt when I told him. All I remember was the constricting of my heart, the hairs behind my neck raising, and my eyes burning.
"Well I can't argue with that." I said with a slight chuckle. "You seem particularly clingy today, enlighten me."
"Sure." I told him, watching as he quickly got up and towards the room where I kept my owl, along with parchment and quills. I was internally debating whether or not I should stay with him, but ultimately decided I would stay here, with Scorpius, ready if anything were to go wrong.
"Gabriel! How do you do this?" I said while gesturing at the radio. His eyes widened, but he snapped out of his day and walked over to me with a chuckle.
Draco and I found out that Scorpius was continuing to stay up and play games in the middle of the night. He got quite upset at it too, and had to put his foot down. The whole ordeal was truly a battle of the dramatics. One which my half-asleep self was utterly entertained by. Now, Scorpius can't use any devices for one month.
"Alright. By the way; There's medicine in the kitchen. I'm not sure if it's yours but if it is then you forgot to take it."
"I'm good, happy to be out of there, with all of you," Draco's hand moved under the table to mine, which was still on his knee, and squeezed it reassuringly.
When I stepped into the shower, I was greeted by the inviting warmth and comfort of the hot water as it hit my skin, seemingly washing away the thick, gooey layer of stress I had on me. I closed my eyes, feeling as the darkness in my mind swayed to the comforting, numbing rhythm of each drop hitting me, the faint feeling of steam filling the small room.
There were a couple moments of silence. Scorpius could only look down at his hands, like he had something all over them. I inched closer to him, but couldn't find anything there. I could only hear his little breaths at a somewhat quick pace. I exhaled sharply.
When we were all in our boats, The man started to move them with magic. I watched the water as the boats glided across the perfectly still lake, and I could have sworn I saw something enormous moving, lurking in the depths of the body of water. I looked up, ready to make a remark about the mysterious movement, but was stopped by the look on my new friends faces.
People left and right moving, talking. The world spins at so fast we don't even feel it. My eyes darted around, hands clenching open and closed, open and closed. There was a tightness that'd begun in my chest, crawling up my throat. I kept looking around, the breath within me becoming constrained.
"I just... I heard that Victorie was spending a lot of time with you lately. Does that- Does that mean anything?"
I shrugged. I don't think I want to tell him yet. It seems we both decided to reside into a laying position at the same time. Now we were both just, looking at each other. I wasn't sure what to call the silence- concerned, stunned, confused, deflated.
"Well, last week you did go over the fact that there is a series of books about you that were written without your consent? Which, by the way, I can once again assure you I have not read- why don't you talk to me about... I don't know, let's start with family." At this the bouncing of my leg stopped.
"Hermione, Ron is right. Listen: they're getting him ready to stay the night, he's already been given one of those ghastly hospital gowns-" I paused when Harry opened the door, handing me a clear plastic bag with his regular clothing, along with his cellular, and his wand. I took the bag, planting a kiss on his forehead. "Let's go back to the room, okay?" I put a gentle hand along the small of his back, guiding him in front of me. He turned to take my hand, holding tightly.
"Happy Christmas boy." He grumbled passively, turning to take a seat at the table. I swallowed hard, taking a shaky breath, and I felt as Draco attempted to secretly take my hand.
Dr. Gilroy continued: "I notice that this is different, and scary. It adds obstacles, and raises questions. That's why I encourage you two to continue this discussion after we leave today. What do you think?"
I sat down in my chair, placing my quill and papers on the desk. Luca sat next to me, awkwardly shuffling and pulling his robe into his chest.
"I hid something in there." Whispered Harry from slightly behind me, I looked over to him, and saw he had a slight smirk on his face, and his wand in his crossed arms.
"It doesn't matter if I believe it... we can't think like that, or it will only feel worse." I reasoned. "If you start talking and thinking like that, then it will only make everything worse."
"Ron." She said pointedly, giving him a look. At this I became slightly angry. Judging by her behavior, she
"Well," I turned back to her. "There are still days... a-and," I took a breath, straightening my posture, which proved to be no use as I slouched down once again. "The other day I..." she nodded, to indicate she was listening.
"Really? That's cool. Reminds me of how Aunt Hermione took a bunch of extra classes in her third year." We both chuckled.
"It smells delicious." He said, looking up at the two men, I nodded in agreement, trying to shake off the lingering feeling of unfamiliarity and discomfort, especially because they're good people, and the food does genuinely smell good.
He returned the hug the second I'd started it; I relished in his warmth and comfort as I cried quietly into his shoulder.
"And you say that you saw a bit of Luca in you... in what way do you mean?" I tensed, voice declining to a whisper:
"And this was the first time your scar has stung since the War? That's odd... and you and Hermione have gone through the possibilities, you mentioned."
"Bloody brilliant! And Teddy's class is among my favorites. He and his friends are a real treat; especially this one girl with curly hair- she loves herbology."
"Yes, it did, didn't it." I walked back towards the bed, huffing and puffing the whole way. "I can't believe it. My first interaction with Scorpius in weeks, and it was negative. He starts school tomorrow... is he even going to say goodbye at the station...?"
He laid where he had sat, and took me into his arms. I did the same, squeezing hard, wishing our hug could remove all of the world's problems.
He paused, as if thinking of what to say. I could feel that he was hesitant. And what he said next ran a chill across my spine. "
"Since when do you two argue?" Piped up Bonnie curiously, and out of nowhere. Just as I was about to casually respond that I haven't the slightest clue what corner Luca's sour mood had crawled out of, he whipped his head up to face her, frustration clearly written across his face.
"Besides," Harry jumped in, his voice loud and breathless and a bit too jumpy, contrasting my own greatly, "isn't it safer to assume that this means something bad, Kingsley? Especially considering all that has happened, I-I think it is! Have you taken up extra security measures in Azkaban?"
A short, skinny, dark tan woman around 50 years old with thick plastic glasses attached to a chain around the back of her neck and thinning dark drown hair in a loose bun came into the kitchen and made a beeline towards me and the pot of beans. Making me tense up and lean backwards into the countertop behind me, as I was now slightly cornered, before I slid out of her way.
"Luna Lovegood," piped up a familiar wispy voice. "Editor of the Quibbler. Are there any updates regarding Rita Skeeter and her status as 'wanted' on multiple accounts of libel and slander?" I flashed her a grateful smile, before going back to my trained expression.
"We're turning around, and sitting down to have a conversation." He said. I watched as Teddy, speechless and defeated, turned around and was guided back up by Draco, both of them sitting down on the bed in the same place Teddy and I had sat. I closed the door behind us all, standing there. I absentmindedly scratched myself, before realizing it and stopping.
The mornings in our spot in one of the Great Hall's tables didn't feel as cozy and welcoming anymore. Wendy and Bonnie still made small talk, and so did I with them, but it was not the same without Luca's participation. Slowly yet surely, our spot blended together with the rest of the table, and my friends' chatter was absorbed into the boisterous noise of breakfast.
"So, Luca. I couldn't help but notice your hair." I commented. He quickly brought a hand to it, before bringing it down, relaxing a bit.
"Harry needed my help." He stated simply, laying down on his back while Scorpius sat on his stomach, leaning back on Draco's legs which were propped up to act as a chair. I watched as Scorpius began to play with his dad's hands, and I noticed how his small, smooth hands contrasted largely with Draco's slightly calloused, almost skeletal hands. Hands that have been through things, have been worn by life; versus hands that have yet to see what the world can do to you.
"Today is Christmas. Go do something romantic with that friend of yours. Why do you think I'm watching every kid in the family today? Go. Scorpius will be fine, we're eating leftovers from yesterday for dinner, they are all so distracted by their toys, we have Christmas movies too."
"Yeah, mate. Go and rest. You look like you could use it." He patted me on the shoulder. For some reason, I couldn't quite speak anymore. My mind was swirling with all of this information and the implications behind it...
He came back with a roll of gauze, cotton balls, nursing tape, and alcohol and sat on the bed across from me putting the stuff down. I gestured for his arms and he rolled up his sleeves.
Gabriel started picking up his books that had fallen to the floor, along with a... paper rose? It had red and white petals, and it looked like it was shimmering. There was even a blue butterfly fluttering around it.
"Gutter ball," Luca remarked monotonously, quickly looking away and focusing on his own lane... a whole two lanes away from mine and Victorie's.
"Hermione's in the hospital, dad," Ron argued, though his voice was faint, as though he was still waiting for the pain from having moved so suddenly to go away.
- among decades worth of trauma, pain, suffering, being alone- that I grew frustrated at the idea that I'd have to wait what felt like an entire other lifetime to feel significant improvement, that is, if I didn't drive myself off a cliff in a fit of transient rage fueled by my own madness first.
"You know, I feel like each night it gets more tolerable," I told him, still whispering, still wanting to keep this feeling of only us, of nothing else existing. "I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing."
"Hey, Gabriel?" I inched my head closer to his while still looking in front of me, whispering as loud as I could. "Why do you put up with John? He doesn't seem like your type at all."
"Woah-" Luca cut off his own exclamation as it echoed across the now empty great Hall. His eyes widened.
"We have all of the strongest protection spells and wards up, Harry, and we've recently made the house unplottable. Staying here won't make a difference."
"Then why am I here?" He shrugged. "Why would you tell me all that now? Am I supposed to fix your... mistakes? Because I'm about to go to school?"
I was sitting on the sofa of the drawing room, finally getting around to continuing the book Draco had asked me to read back in March. It's really not a challenging read, but entertaining nonetheless. I was just getting especially intrigued when I heard a groan from upstairs.
"It's ok. You don't have to continue." I understood now what happened. Talking about the war triggers him. I thought about what to say next for a moment.
I wondered if the lack of long sleeves for the first time in- well, I don't quite remember the last time he had short sleeves on. Maybe one or two particularly hot summer nights, and he had transfigured all of the marks on his arms, because he wears long sleeves more out of shame, less of anything else. But now, everything that he'd done was on display, like a painting at a showcase by a troubled artist who hated it, who had begged them not to display it.
I like how Draco looks when he's talking about Scorpius: his eyes light up with fondness, he smiles and laughs at the memories, and he looks like a good, loving, caring, and protective father who will do absolutely anything for his son. And I can't say I don't encourage conversation about Scorpius, because really; he cares about Scorpius
"Enough! Stop fucking fighting! Harry is missing. He is what we have to deal with right now. You all are either going to help me find him, or I'm going alone." He said, grabbing his coat and shoving past the two girls, going outside. The door slammed.
He didn't respond until three seconds later. That was when I realized he had probably been awake the whole time. He shifted in bed, turning around to face me. His eyes seemed distant, and tired. His expression was lost, almost blank. Something in me turned.
Draco didn't respond to that. Not for a long time. And I didn't think it right to push for a response much. So I did what I could best: provide him comfort through the rest of the night long past the point where he fell back to sleep, and until finally, I fell asleep as well.
I inserted the disc into the radio, then set it on the floor and pressed play. Immediately, an upbeat piano and percussion beat began to play. I stood there frozen, not really knowing how to move to it.
"I was starved... I didn't know a properly full stomach until I went to Hogwarts. And they did everything they could to keep me from it. We'd traveled across town to a hut on an island... they even put bars on my bedroom window.
"Sh, it's okay. This- this looks a bit scary, so I'm going to heal you with magic, Harry. Can you hear me? It's going to leave a scar, and it might hurt... I'm not very skilled in this, Harry. Please nod for me." Through my shuddering breaths and my trembling and dizziness, I nodded, ever so minimally, into his chest. His cold hand took my arm, which in all honesty, felt like it was on fire.
. Let us get dressed and we'll meet you in the drawing room," I told them, sneering slightly. "Learn to respect one's privacy for Merlin's sake."
Keeping everything to myself again had dragged me into a sort of familiar turmoil within my mind. I almost casually walked through the tar in my brain as I entertained my self-deprecating thoughts and the eternally pulling gravity of the situation occurring outside the relative yet false safety of four walls of the guest bedroom. I'd have panic attacks silently, alone, and they'd leave me so completely and utterly drained that I couldn't bring myself to speak or scream or scratch or cut; I simply stayed in the corner of the room, staring into the empty distance, maybe even falling asleep, letting a few silent, careless, effortless tears slip.
When I opened my eyes again I noticed the three children were changing the game out for another one, and Teddy thrust an extra Wii remote into my hand.
"I need some air," he mumbled. "Find me outside if anything." His head was pointed downward as he made small quick steps out the door. I turned back to the others.
"I just- it doesn't matter... I needed a break anyway." He sighed, getting up from the bed. I followed him.
I would see her again and she would hold me and tell me she loves me, and I would know it was all fake, that I would never really get to have that. I would never get to tell mum how school was, or what we learned in class, or tell dad how Professor Binns told us he was the first werewolf to receive the Order of Merlin...
"Why would Voldemort want to purposefully mislead Muggles into thinking we're fake, while fully disclosing- and who even wrote the books?! I mean- this was obviously in the making since I was born, I just-" A sob escaped me, shamelessly bringing tears forth with it.
Happy Sunday, everybody! Scorpius and Draco's tensions rise to a sort of breaking point, and Harry receives another letter. I wonder what about?
"It stung, like it used to when h-"  his voice faltered, before he quickly regained himself. "like it used to... when he used to summon us... and when I looked at it, the mark shriveled into this bundle of scars." He explained.
We smiled among our whispers, bumping shoulders as the boat rocked on the way to Hogwarts proper. I sighed.
I thought as I stared at the ceiling, willing my eyes to stay open, feeling weak and floating in and out of life. The ringing in my ears still had not subsided, and closing my eyes felt a lot better than trying to watch my skewed vision readjust itself. So, I closed my eyes, taking in a deep breath.
"What if I get a nightmare or what if I pee myself-" I turned when I heard the door open, seeing Harry wrapped in a towel, with a lot of lines on his chest. He stopped, looked at us, then he put his hand out to the side, making a pile of folded clothes fly into his hands before he turned away and left, closing the door behind him. I felt my cheeks go red with embarrassment.
The words finally burst out of my chest. So did the burning pain, and I could not help but yelp and shrink into myself, still crying, my breath now beginning to shorten and sharpen.
Harry and I started on breakfast. Scorpius started his game, stretching his legs and arms, pacing in place to get ready. He finally chose a song and punched the air, hopping a little off the ground.
They love how much you are trying to get yourself better, how much you are trying to learn how to talk about things you were taught to stay silent about, how you have been so open to trying new things in the name of a happier, healthier Harry who deserves the world. They love that about you."
"At least you don't have to deal with it anymore... right?" I felt bad for not knowing quite how to comfort him. I really wanted to just, sort through all of the information I had, but now wasn't the time.
"I mean, if he wakes up, then sure. But I think he just needs a little rest right now. I'll make you a sandwich. How about that?"
I walked to the door of the dormitory, open enough that I could hear that conversation, but I paused once I heard Gabriel. I felt something drop almost to my stomach.
"Okay... and how exactly did you get a black eye?"  I took to looking at the curtains on the window, that were a lot cooler than the conversation I'm having right now.
"I don't feel good." He whimpered. A closer look at him allowed me to notice he looked rather pale, well, more pale than usual, and a bit green. His hair was a mess, and a quick touch to the forehead told me he had a fever.
"Eh, I wouldn't worry about any professor in particular, except probably Slughorn the Potions teacher," said Wendy, crossing his arms and taking a breath before continuing. "Though it's vulgar to say, I do believe that man has a stick up his arse."
"I'm never safe." He interrupted "No one can keep me from my mind and my mind makes me remember." He began to choke back sobs.
"A-and- sometimes I wonder if  they never knew Uncle Harry then maybe they wouldn't have died- and I know it's wrong to think it's his fault but- maybe if my parents didn't care so much they would have just stayed with me at home and not have gone fighting for him." I sniffled, closing my eyes tight. "And who knows? Maybe thinking like that about Uncle Harry makes me evil- because I know it wasn't his fault, but sometimes I just think about them and I miss them and I-" I swallowed the remainder of my words, mentally criticizing myself.
I found Victorie along the way, hanging out with her friends near the Great Hall. She took my hand with an eager smile, which I did not expect in the slightest, but didn't turn it away either. She commented on how I looked like a tomato, both my friends and hers giggled, and we went on our way to the hall. It looked ten times brighter than usual, which made me wince for a second, but I couldn't look away from it; every surface was shinier, the usual number of candles increased tenfold, and there were the four banners representing each house hung up on the ceiling. As soon as enough people were in the hall, the candles dimmed for a second, before the champions appeared in the center and performed the opening dance. Everyone was quite graceful, even the Durmstrang champion, who had the bulkiest build out of all of them.
"Whatever it is, I'm sure it can't be that horrible. Don't worry," I told him, slipping on a jumper. "I'll be there anyway," I added while studying the closet to see which pants I should put on. I was slightly startled by the feeling of soft fingers coming around my waist. Harry rested his chin onto my shoulder, and I turned around, giving him a proper hug, and a kiss on the temple. "It's okay. If they bother us too much I'll just kick them out."
"Harry you... you really did take a hard fall back there. You should rest for the remainder of the day."
"I won't." I heard her say. After one last look into my eyes, I went downstairs, and left with Draco and Scorpius.
He blinked a couple of times, moving to hug me again, as we were before he'd begun talking. I allowed him to nuzzle into the crook of my neck, bringing my own arms around him as well. He sighed.
Again, as we hugged, he buried his face into me, glasses be damned. I rubbed small comforting circles on his back, and all that was running through my head was
"You- Draco-" he kept laughing. I sat up, faking offense, yet still truly confused as to why he was laughing so hard.
"You know," began Draco from beside me on the bed, where he had chosen staring at his arm over cuddling close to me. "Sometimes," he paused, letting silence surround us before taking a breath and continuing:
"And why him? He doesn't work for them. Shouldn't Kingsley have an actual Auror doing the interrogating?" Draco asked, his voice defensive.
"I make things worse for myself and everyone else. If there was some way to be alive while removing myself from the equation, everything would be better-"
I felt myself overheating. I frantically sat up and removed my shirt and threw it across the room. I felt as though there were pins and needles pinching me everywhere and I squeezed myself in discomfort as my knees drew towards my chest.
"Your- on your... left arm." I clarified. He moved it so we could both see it, seemingly studying it for a second- probably more than a second. He was hesitant, and I couldn't help but want to swallow my previously said words.
"It's the right thing to do," I elaborated. "Back then, when Harry and I were kids, and even before that, a lot of Wizards and witches would treat non-magic folk with a horrible bias, just because they didn't know magic. There," I sighed, mentally working through the oncoming explanation of a blood hierarchy.
"I know that it hurts, being apart... but it will hurt more having you both gone." I said with a dry throat.
"Dada it's Christmas Dada, Dada!" We both widened our eyes in amusement at the distant yet booming sound of Scorpius busting his room door open and zooming down the hall. We moved to get out of the bed, readying ourselves for the day that was to come.
My insides crumbled apart. It took a few minutes before I could actually leave the room, and even then I was shaking from head to toe.
Our foreheads stayed connected. We weren't even dancing anymore. It seems we were too caught up in almost kissing to do that anymore. I felt my heartbeat everywhere in my body. I pressed further and he did the same.
I took a breath out and sat down before turning my arms so he could see. I took a sharp breath in, nervous for his reaction.
"Hi mummy. It's me, Scorpius." I put my hand on his shoulder. "When dada told me I could talk to you I thought it was a joke... but he doesn't make jokes. How are you?" There was a brief silence. "Dada used to show me pictures of you and me and him. But I was tiny like a little bean. You were real pretty though. What's it like where you are? Do you have friends?" More silence.
I fastened my tie and hastily combed my hair. I was never one to clean up for dinner, but a comment Gabriel made put me on the spot and made my face grow hot. I hated to admit it, but I really did look kind of messy.
"Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! Congratulations to all of our first years, who have now been sorted into their houses-" a cheer erupted throughout the hall.
"Harry, You cannot meet the needs and demands of an infant when you struggle to even meet your own..." I said, slightly less frustrated, but still just as baffled at him.
"I'm sorry." I mumbled in a sort of lost whisper. "I'm sorry that I'm just... such a git. I'm sorry you have to put up with me and my bullshit."
I felt a warmth being pressed against me and I leaned into it before realizing it was Draco giving me a hug. I returned it, closing my eyes tightly and feeling as though a boulder had briefly been lifted from my chest.
"Please write your name on a piece of parchment, then drop it in the Goblet; it won't burn you... much. I jest. But, really, students have until tomorrow morning before breakfast to submit their names. In the meantime, do enjoy your meal and stay! Hogwarts students, please be respectful. I will hear about it."
Luca came soon after, jogging to the group. His face looked a bit red. I titled my head as he came by, smiling in the way I was accustomed to smiling at him, the way that could contain a million questions that only he could answer. He only gave a slight shake of his head, barely noticeable in the way he bounded down the highway.
requests over the past two years, Hogwarts now has a Wizarding Bowling Club- Open to all students." Another cheer came up, mostly from the Gryffindors, before she brought up her hand, silencing us again.
I sat at a table next to Teddy and Rose. McGonagall, the headmistress, looked as strong as people say her to be. I'd heard conversations on the train about her.
"Come off it, yes? So what am I supposed to do? Stand there and watch while you starve yourself to death? Make yourself disintegrate into nothing?!"
I told myself repeatedly. My emotions took me over, and I felt an unavoidable sob escape me, wracking my body. By now it was dark, cold, and windy. I brought my knees to my chest and hugged myself, shivering as my hot tears streamed down my face, and the wind mercilessly howled.
Movement off to the side, and I noticed Draco out of Skeeter's sight, trying to usher his son behind him.
I walked away- upstairs, into the guest room- closing the door behind me. I shut my eyes tight, taking in a deep breath. The exhale, however, came out as a soundless sob. I shook.
"I'm not sure whether charging in was the smartest, though. So I don't blame Draco for not doing anything," Lovegood defended quite simply.
"Harry," began Hermione. I huffed in response. "You... this can't be. He's dead. You know that, we do..."
"Look at me. I'm going to be there the whole time." I repeated. "You're going to be fine. We'll eat dinner, and then, if you're up for it, we can walk around."
"Favorite things? Uhm, well, I don't know... I've never really been asked that. I'd say," Harry squinted a little, thinking. "Riding my broom is really fun. Oh, and there are these, these miniature desserts, treacle tarts, they're quite delicious."
I stayed by Draco's side, reading the incredibly odd list with things I hadn't even heard of, while my hand was intertwined with his free hand.
"But becoming a death eater? Dragging Crabbe, Goyle, Blaise, and Pansy into your disaster... your... tasks... You went too far,
Leaning toward the table, I focused on the sunny green pasture spanning over the cold, hard wooden surface. I held a piece of a golden flower in my hand and scanned ahead. Dada said they're called gorse flowers.
I lost all concept of time, really, as soon as I'd entered this room. I didn't know how long I'd been here at all, let alone how long Draco was cradling me closely, whispering reassurances, crying at one point.
"Look at that rollercoaster Uncle Harry!" exclaimed Teddy, pointing at two large tracks seemingly inches from each other. I nodded dismissively, too taken aback by everything to pay attention to the thrill ride.
There was a moment where all that could be heard was the crackle of the flames. It seemed we were all at a bit of a loss. I briefly wondered if Draco's dream from last night was going to be brought up. I looked at him, which was no use, because he was staring at Kingsley blankly, as if he'd zoned out. Hermione was looking between me, Kingsley, Ron, and Draco.
"Don't apologize, it had nothing to do with you. Plus, you can't blame them for being cautious, after all..." I let my voice trail, not wanting, or needing, to finish that sentence.
Soon enough we were all ready to go, and Teddy appeared out of the floo looking fresh and prepared. His teal hair was not damp, as though he were fresh out of the shower. He was already wearing his Hufflepuff robes, and he had a simple expression. We all said our hello's and our how are you's, and then just like that, we took off.
I shook my head side to side. Wendy and Bonnie looked at each other from a distance while their lab partners were busy looking at the potion book, and nodded, but a frown persisted on their features.
"How did you sleep?" I asked, going towards the bed, the soft, warm bed that my body was just aching for.
"Does it matter? Stop butting into the conversation." He snapped. I stared at him in disbelief, shocked that he had just snapped at Bonnie of all people.
My mind began bouncing around ideas of similar nature, questioning my every thought and my every action throughout my relationship with the Weasley family, Hermione, and Teddy.
"I didn't think it was that deep when I saw it, doctor... I don't-" my words caught themselves in my throat, and I found myself rendered mute for a moment. The only thing that could be heard was the sound of her pen scratching the paper. Harry pulled his sleeve back down.
A half hour went by, and I wondered if perhaps Daigon Alley was particularly busy today, even though it's only July and most people get their supplies in August.
I dealt with pesky doxies that bit my hands when I first discovered them, and boggarts were hiding in many places around the house. There were also many valuable potions ingredients that had been left abandoned in drawers and cupboards. Speaking of which, Harry couldn't help clean the cupboard on the third floor. But, he was a great help in getting rid of the spiders residing in all sorts of hiding spots. The whole project took us five days with magic at our disposal.
Soon, though, my heart gave a terrible jolt, and I was roughly pulled from my temporary solace at the sound of knuckles rapping at the door, and two panicked voices.
"Stop. I, I'm... I-" I didn't finish because any thought I had, left me; and I found myself not knowing how to describe what was happening to me. All I know is that it's painfully familiar, and I hate it. I made my way to the floor, taking short shallow breaths.
"Can I have some more mashed potatoes, please?" He geld out his plate for Uncle Harry to take. I furrowed my brows in confusion, feeling almost like I'd walked into an alternate universe. Scorpius and Uncle Harry don't interact often, but they're talking now as if nothing, and Scorpius is ignoring Draco. His
His eyes widened. His smile slowly subsided into a frown, like the one he had given me the day he met Victorie. I furrowed my brows.
"It's beef Wellington- I didn't serve you much because I know it can look overwhelming, but there's always more in the kitchen. There's also some roasted potato wedges and some asparagus." He said it like it wasn't something that took tremendous amounts of time and effort- carelessly, as if this wasn't what we were having for our first date in two years, something that he went through the trouble of making the Muggle way- which is surely difficult- because it would hold more meaning that way.
"Well- yeah. It hurts a lot... it scares me." I admitted with a scratchy voice. I wiped my eyes of the old tear stains, still staring out the window. I felt drained, confused, scared. I wondered briefly what happened to Harry, and where he'd gone. I wondered if it was best to leave him the space he was so obviously displaying the desire for. I wondered if giving him space would kill him, if he was already dead, if I had approached everything wrong, and if now it was too late to fix anything.
"Well," she said. "I think you should let him know that you and Ginny aren't tearing each other's heads off. And just, talk to him. Okay?"
"Replying to Hermione's letter. I said simply, continuing to put down my response. I took the silence as permission to continue speaking. "Ginny probably won't be there. I don't think pregnant women can Floo or Apparate, just so you know." I said, dipping my quill into the ink, before continuing again. I felt Harry peer over my shoulder.
I nudged him gently, gesturing for him to be polite. Scorpius took her hand. "I'm Scorpius Malfoy..."
"Well, I've already gone to Pomfrey three times since school started last month. You can't entirely blame me." I said, fixing my bag which was sliding off my shoulder. "I might as well make friends with the Quidditch teams since they're probably the only kids in school who've gone more than me already." I said, slightly joking. This earned me a snicker from Luca.
I took a deep breath, willing myself to not let a tear escape. Merlin. Everyone in the house heard our little argument without a doubt. The first thing I thought to do was make sure Scorpius was alright, I don't think he's ever even witnessed an argument, being 6 and living with only one other person meant the worst that would happen is him screaming and crying, which is completely normal for kids his age and younger. I went down the hallway and knocked on his door, signaling that I was about to enter, I saw him with headphones plugged in to a CD player, and playing with toy dinosaurs. He looked up when he saw me and I simply gave him a faint smile before closing the door again, silently grateful that he was lost in his own world and probably never noticed that the Weaslette ever visited.
After settling onto the bed we started talking; simple things. It was all going great until Scor asked a certain question that made me almost somber:
"Harry would know that, wouldn't he." Remarked Bill with a smile, before standing up from his seat. "Happy Christmas. Please, take my seat. I was about to go find Fleur anyway." He shook my hand, and Draco's as well.
I turned off the water with wobbly hands, and picked up the bottles, my mind became more disorganized as I did so, and my vision was becoming more and more obscured. Everything was spinning wildly and I was having a hard time doing anything.
"It turned that way shortly after he died." He stated, with a hint of something in his voice. Something I couldn't quite place.
"Hey, I think I see something pretty cool over there." Scorpius gave me a confused look, before turning over his left shoulder, where I was pointing. He looked at me with a dropped jaw, nearly toppling me over with a hug, before urging us all to the queue to meet Spider-Man.
"I know I haven't really been... trying, with you. Both of you." I added, gesturing towards Ron. "I- you deserve better, and I know that it's difficult... everything... I know I scared you guys, and I left you swimming in the dark with me." I was blinking rapidly, and pointedly facing Hermione's shoes. I took a breath to continue, but was cut off by Hermione.
"Well, I'm here to turn your perspective... I know it's difficult, but you're strong. You've made it through hell and back and you're still breathing, you're still here." I said, continuing to pass my hand through his hair. There was a soft bit of silence where all that was heard was our breathing, or the occasional sound of the house creaking. Things were calm, and I was sure that Harry would fall asleep soon, that was, until a few simple words snapped me into full alertness:
"Well, I think it's worth a shot," I told him honestly. "I mean; I'd like to meet the kid, and how much of a problem can the Dursley's cause in a public place? They care about their image too much for that." I chuckled slightly, trying to push away the weight that had settled on my chest at the thought of having to be near Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon.
I teased him about how silly he must've sounded, asking about how to watch the films, then, after being guided to the DVD players at the store, asking how they worked, and how to put the disc into the device. He laughed it off, because apparently he admits that day to have been the most embarrassing of his life.
"Don't you get hot sometimes at night when you sleep? and you uncover yourself and occasionally ask me to change your pajamas- or, back then, at least. Now I can imagine you change on your own if you wish." Scorpius' eyes softened, and I inwardly relaxed.
"Yuca." She replied, before putting a spoonful of rice and beans into a small child's mouth sitting to her left.
. My hands were full of this sticky gel called... "Moco de Gorila"? It was something his mom sent a bucketful of at the start of every week. I can't even begin to pronounce it. It was weird enough that Gabriel didn't have a British accent.
Just then, I heard my compartment door slide open, and was met with a short kid with curly, dark brown hair, a little bit like Uncle Harry's. The kid was also pale, skinny, and already wearing their Hogwarts robes. I got a good look at them, just trying to figure out: are they a boy, or a girl? I couldn't quite seem pinpoint it off appearance alone, so I stayed silent as to not embarrass myself.
"I already explained," I began. "Harry needs to-" the words caught in my throat unexpectedly, and I found myself undoing the buttons of my once crisp polo. The long day had worn it down, and I knew I needed to straighten it again before putting it away for the night. Scorpius looked to the floor, and the gears were, quite visibly by his expression, turning in his head. I closed my eyes, letting my jaw tense and untense as I began the impossible task of getting comfortable. After a long moment, Scorpius spoke.
I didn't notice the wide smile that had grown on my face. I looked at my tea, which was nearly finished, and the book I was reading. I realized I hadn't been paying attention at all, and the only thing I remembered was the paragraph that I started reading before I went to get my tea. I hung my head down in defeat.
"So then, let's work to understand why these feelings that we shared today are happening and affecting us-"
"Because I need to answer a question I'm asking myself. Please?" I said, sitting on the bed in front of him.
"I uhm... I read those books." My head snapped up at Dudley. I faintly noticed Millicent rolling her eyes beside him. "I thought that... it would help me understand more what happened... it was... before. Before I met Millie. Around the early 2000's... I just wanted to see what it was all about."
'Those Weasley siblings' were Ron and Ginny. But they were not the only people Harry and I spotted sitting at the round booth. The others in the room were Hermione, Lovegood, and Longbottom. They were all speaking, as apparent by their moving mouths, but nothing could be heard- only a piercing ring in my ears. Even in a private room, Hermione had the sense to put up a silencing charm.
"Just stop! Stop talking... stop." He said in a flustered manner. I immediately shut up. He took a few deep breaths before speaking again:
"I guess you're right, it's just... I don't know, I'm used to shitty situations, I guess." I gave him a peck on his hairline.
"And I think we should initiate some D.A members as well," added Hermione. I whipped my head to her. Suddenly the world was becoming narrow.
At that moment, Professor Slughorn strode from the door to the front of the classroom, introducing himself with a mean look on his face. I placed both of my hands on the table, waiting for instruction. Rose did the same.
"Let's go to bed." I whispered. Not knowing if I'd really fall asleep, but knowing that I would love the comfort of a bed right now.
It had been a few hours past lunch, of which I ate half of- a good thing- when Teddy had decided he wanted to spend a few extra hours here before needing to go back to Hogwarts at the end of the day. I told him that we'd take him just before dinner, so he could wind down and get an early night for classes tomorrow. He used that time to play exploding snap.
"At 4:15, his heart monitor spiked, paging me. He was found thrashing and crying. Upon asking, he said he was perfectly fine."
I thought the purpose of this trip was to make sure they think it's fake- but now Hermione thinks it's more than that and she already told Kingsley and- I just- when does it end?"
"But anyone can write an inconsistent story, and we've already gone over how this is probably the most accurate recount in existence of Harry's life." Interjected Draco. "It could still be anyone."
Luca and I arrived at the castle grounds after our morning and afternoon classes and we followed the wave of students walking towards the Quidditch pitch, walking over the wooden bridge and gazing over the walkways. Suddenly, I'd had the feeling that the boards of wood I had been walking on welcomed me to the field, as if it was a grandparent guiding their infant grandchildren after play. I could barely see the spots of grass among the students' feet shuffling. The sky was clear with small strips of fluffy cloud dotting the horizon.
"I just suppressed every other part of myself. Kept every aspect of my personality separate, making sure I could avoid fighting with myself." He replied, not returning the hug, but instead staying still. "It slowed me down... my thoughts. It made them doubt my abilities as a death eater. Which put me and my parents in danger." He let out a burst of breath that he seemingly forgot to let out earlier.
"What goes through your head that stops you from eating every time?" I asked, letting the conversation fall into more serious territory, while our voices remained a light whisper.
I lay in my bed silently looking at nothing in particular. Then my vision wandered towards my arm. Specifically the one in front of me. I traced down all the old lines as though mentally feeling them.  I closed my eyes tightly as they watered and turned my head towards the ceiling. I took a tired breath. I don't know how I'll survive the day when I'm like this as soon as I awoke. I figured I should try to go back to sleep since I knew I had an hour until I had to wake Teddy. Maybe that's what I need in order to feel better. Just a nap.
"Wait... you aren't going to... tell Ginny? That I... God I don't even know what I'm talking about."
At this Harry looked at me, sat up, then sniffed his underarms. "I smell perfectly decent! Besides I got a shower yesterday."
"You can't continue to take care of him. Not only have you been... ignoring him... but your health is a top priority right now Harry."
"Harry, promise me." I said, allowing myself to breathe when I finished the statement. I felt Harry hug me tightly, as tears streamed from himself quietly, seeping through to my shirt, further wetting it with salty tears.
"Me and Teddy can still be friends right?" I saw the sad look in his face, Teddy is his first friend.
I don't remember her saying that it was rape, that it was her fault for being out late at night, that she should have brought her wand. That she should have fought harder. Hysterical, telling me she doesn't know what to do. That she's never been so terrified. I'd heard her cry for the first time ever that night, over the phone. I don't know why, but I wanted nothing but the ability to comfort her at that moment.
"It's okay. Listen to me." I said, and I began to tap my finger against his back slowly and rhythmical, like my heart. "Can you feel that?"
"I moved here 8 years ago," Harry responded in return. "I couldn't take the wizarding world anymore."
I hated not knowing what exactly was wrong with Harry, and how it is that he shuts down so quickly. I walked to my room after tucking Scorpius in, my mind searching and scanning for answers regarding Harry. I opened the door, noticing that he was awake, staring blankly at the wall. I made my way to my dresser, putting on pajamas before getting in bed next to him.
"Here, Scorpius. Your first-ever ButterBeer, and absolutely your last one until you turn seventeen." Said Draco, handing the mug to his son.
The simple radio put on a different selection than before. I didn't recognize it, but I think Luca said this was "in three?" That interaction was very strange; he rambled on like a maniac, but I enjoyed seeing his eyes light up.
She grabbed a bag and angrily went to her drawers and shoved a handful of clothes into her bag before slinging it over her shoulder and apparating with a small pop.
I repeated to myself over and over, but my hand was on the doorknob, and I turned it. I found Harry sitting on the floor, knees to his chest, and he was rubbing his wrists harshly against his pants, with short breaths, and small rocking movements. I was on the floor by him in a second.
Teddy and I flooed home and I brushed him off when I heard the front door open.  I looked up towards the door and met eyes with Ginny.
I nodded. As long as I'm with Draco, I can manage. He's my rock. He helps me navigate new things. Draco took my hand and brought it to our sides, intertwining our fingers.
"Scorpius, let's have a talk." I guided him to his room, while Harry wordlessly turned to go downstairs. Opening his room, I saw his television turned on, and two Wii remotes sitting on the floor. The screen showed that his dancing game was paused. I briefly wondered why he would have two remotes set up for himself.
"y-yeah. Let's get your island dinner started. Let's..." I lost my train of thought and zoned out for half a second before snapping back into reality. "Where's the recipe?" I asked, not making eye contact.
We enjoyed a several many things before making it to the pretend-Hogsmeade, including one particularly whimsical land, where it seems all of the youngest kids were. Draco said it was themed after the books of a famous American children's author whose books he read to Scorpius when he was little. Hermione backed him up, claiming to have also read those books when she was particularly young. The two of them were proven correct when one of the stores in that area had two entire walls worth of books all written by a certain Dr. Seuss.
I told myself, finally becoming aware of how erratic my breathing was. I also became aware that I'd left my coat inside the hospital. And the cold front passing through meant it was quite chilly outside right now. I pushed that realization away though, focusing on my breathing. Which slowly became calm.
"Recovering from everything that's just happened in England. It's making me feel numb." I said. Things were still, and silent. I don't know if I was truly thinking when I said the next part. And part of me wants to think it's not entirely true, but I can't bring myself to fully believe that.
"You know, I was a mess the day I heard what you tried to do." He started. "I think of you as a brother. It hurts to know that you saw no other way out of the thoughts that plagued your mind. I was scared to talk to you because I was thinking the same way. At least now you know that I understand it too, you know?" He said, letting the quiet consume us again.
Molly retreated into the house, but not before giving Ron a firm squeeze on the cheek, similar to what she did to me.
"So," my leg began bouncing up and down. "Does that mean it's... not a good idea?" I asked, feeling an itch sprout behind my neck. I reached back to scratch it.
"If I knew you were like this when you woke up from naps, maybe I'd have you take more of them." I remarked, laughing slightly. I ignored the slight pain that shot across my stomach, having gotten used to it by now.
"Lilly's right, though," commented the teen beside her, taking a sip of her butterbeer. The waiter arrived with our food, and we took it in silence. Harry struggled to get past a few bites, and I completely understood why, considering that I had nearly lost my appetite, too.
"Like a baby, especially after last night," I said with a smirk. "Best Christmas Eve ever," I added, giving a sly chuckle, which Draco reciprocated.
We sat there for about 15 minutes before Harry had relaxed enough to leave the bathroom. We held hands the entire way to my room, stopping at Scorpius's first to quickly say goodnight. Harry stayed behind me without a word. When we got to the room I hesitantly let go of his hand in order to change into pajamas, handing a pair to Harry as well. We wordlessly agreed to face opposite each other while changing, though all I wanted to do at the moment was hold him. I felt like at any given second he'd be gone.
All too suddenly, my nose wrinkled violently as an absolutely putrid smell violated my nostrils. Hermione's voice shot across the area "My God, it's rotten!" The next sound heard was that of gagging, and heavy receding footsteps.
"Hello Harry..." she told me before glancing at Draco. "Malfoy." She said politely. I swallowed hard.
"I'm so sorry." He said, becoming aware of the situation. "I got distracted watching the bread so that
"Aurors Weasley, Berrycloth and Williamson; don't move." I boomed. Thorfinn let go of the woman, who gulped down a large breath as she collapsed down to the floor, her white curls bouncing. She scrambled to her feet coming towards me.
Harry went to my room, and I followed behind him. When we were alone I wrapped my arms around his waist, giving him a kiss where I could reach. He turned around, and in doing so he put his hand to cup my face, giving me a proper kiss. I noticed that he does this sometimes to avoid whatever anxious feelings he has. Not every time, but sometimes. And I knew that this was one of them because Harry can never hide his shaking.
I sat in front of Luca at breakfast again today. He was showing an empty expression and glancing around. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, the bell rang, signaling the start of the first period of the day. I quickly boosted myself off the table seat, and hurried to my Defense Against the Dark Arts class.
"I've had my fair share of them. I had to learn to comfort myself, and make sure that no one could tell what was going on. I made sure to keep a still face through everything. Which became a bit easier when I would zone out..."
"I'm perfectly fine- worrying about you. Draco never told my why you ended up in the hospital. I mean, I could only figure so much, but-"
"Are you kidding me? She's been all he can talk about for the past month." My eyes widened. I really need to pay more attention to him.
"Don't think that way... it will only make you feel worse," he told me. "He's going to come around. I promise you. Now let's try and get back to sleep. Tomorrow is our last day with him."
Off of my periphery I saw Scorpius and Rose engaging in a game of paper, scissors, stone. Draco shrugged and started the car.
There was a moment where I felt his gaze land on me, and I brought my line of sight up to see his cracked, emerald eyes.
"It's okay... let it out." Draco was rubbing long strokes up and down my back as I went sick, and all I could do was focus on how my forehead pounded relentlessly through my veins, forcing itself between every crevice of my head, making me feel worse. Soon I finished, and could only sit there doubled over the toilet seat. Ron's hand appeared by me, the glass of water he'd gotten earlier in his hand. Panting, I nodded weakly, hoisting myself up. Draco insisted to have an arm around me, it seems. And I won't lie, it was stabilizing... I might have fallen a few times already if he wasn't there. I blinked a few times, going over to the sink to rinse the stale vomit out from my mouth. Then, I gratefully downed the glass of water before we all walked back to the room.
I felt my mouth form into a scowl and my brow furrow at the thought of spending more time in this place. I gulped.
The lesson finished, and we were dismissed out of the room. Prefects went outside to begin their patrol, while my friends and I made our way to the dormitories, talking and predicting about how the first task early tomorrow will be.
"W-well, fine!" While Bonnie slowly got out of her seat and waved goodbye to us with a smile, Wendy shot up from his seat and hastily gestured a farewell to us.
"You're growing up so fast. I think it's too fast. You need to stay little." I told him. He seemed to disagree.
I quickly brought my hand downwards, hitting it with the edge of the bathroom sink in the process. I hissed and bent forwards, clutching my hand. I sighed, tilting my head up to look at myself once again, pursing my lips to keep from frowning.
"Make it stop." I croaked, closing my eyes again. I was holding myself tightly, my nails digging into my skin.
"Draco and I... we... I mean... it's not to say he doesn't love me..." I let out a small chuckle, before my expression dropped. "He's never... but... I don't either. And it's not that I don't love him, it's just- I get- nervous- and- but it's not like that. I do- he does- we just... don't-"
"I wish I could tell you I did, but you know I'm rubbish at cooking." He chuckled, following me in with a pleasant smile across his face.
"What could Draco have possibly done in America to warrant his arrest months after leaving?" I asked suspiciously. His perfectly pristine, plaster smile faltered as he put his outstretched arm back to his side, realizing that I had no intention in shaking his hand.
"Oh, the bread, yes." He responded, promptly taking care of that. Just then, I was hit with a question in my mind.
It almost hurt to think that once we were in love and promising to stick by each other till the end, and now...
My expression softened and for half a second I considered sitting down and drowning in my sorrows with the two of them, just taking this garbled mess in my brain and slamming it to the ground in defeat, but it was within that same half a second that I was startled out of myself at the feeling of a large, slim hand grasping mine, followed by the short clipped words
Through the slightly opened door, I saw her storm out of the room, tears streaking her face. I felt the floor rumble beneath my feet as she rushed downstairs. Ron rushed out the door, with Hermione and I closely following, all of us remained breathlessly shocked, my body tense in anger with a powerful rage within.
Scorpius tried wiggling out of his grip, curiosity framing his expression. Draco's arms went limp around the boy, falling at Scorpius' sides.
"I met someone, his name is Rolf. He's a Magizoologist, like me." said Luna in her usually calm tone, wearing a gentle smile.
"What if it's death eaters?" asked Luna, a bit too quietly. I stiffened, staring straight at her. Ginny turned towards her slowly with wide eyes, before turning to me, her eyes narrowing into slits within seconds.
I kicked a rock in front of me as we strolled along the sidewalk. Scorpius was leaning into Draco's left side, complaining of the cold, to which Draco would keep responding with 'put up your hood, and keep your scarf around your neck.' To which a stubborn Scorpius would respond with 'But you don't have a hood or a scarf!' and Draco would continue with 'My shirt is a turtleneck, I don't need a scarf.' But of course, the banter would come while Draco allows his son to lean into him for warmth, and
"So, you press this one to go, and you can't let it go. And this one lets go of the special squares, and this one is the letter A, and this button hiding behind the remote" I turned the remote over "That's the back button." I explained. "And you point it at the TV, to move your hand. See?" I showed her the fake hand on the TV, "It's like magic!" At this I noticed dada's eyes widen, and he started making all these crazy hand moves at me. It was confusing. Maria chuckled, repeating what I said to herself, but I was trying to figure out what dada was saying.
Opening the door, I noticed how the gentle yellow glow of the bedside lamp caught his face, softening his hard-set expression. I furrowed my brows, noticing his left sleeve was rolled up haphazardly, and he was staring down at the bunch of scars where the dark mark used to reside. Draco was staring at it, his lips formed into a thin line, his brows furrowed. It was as though he was challenging his scars.
When we got to the house, Draco had said something, but I ignored it. I needed silence to engulf me. I needed to feel the swelling in my chest.
I opened my eyes, my chest feeling heavy at the memory. The words kept circling through my mind. Selfish, freakish, foolish, horrible, dangerous. It angered me. It angered me because I know those words all carry even some truth to them. I sat up, I could feel each beat my heart made. It was uncomfortable and made me want to rip my skin off.
I can't believe what happened. I gagged again, spilling more. I kneeled, resting my head on the toilet.
"Because he had another one of those dreams where I died, or vanished- something to that extent." I explained, realizing that I was, and am, so tired that I don't quite remember comforting Scorpius last night. I only remember that I wasn't asleep, that I was with him.
As I settled more and more into his warmth, the thought of Scorpius and my mother brought a cold sensation to my chest. I sighed audibly.
"Hey, it's alright, it's okay. Dada's here, don't worry my love, it's okay. I'm right here..." the words came out almost as though they were trained. Scorpius cried, not resisting me in the slightest. I did my best to lift him into a sideways sitting position on my lap. I brought his head to my chest, over my heart, and I cradled him, ignoring how he was now big enough to reach my shoulder if he hadn't been hunched over, and how I could really no longer carry him. I worried his hair with my hand, smoothing it over, holding him tightly as his cries only grew more distraught.
"Was it something that worried you?" I asked, desperate to know why he zoned out, almost causing a crash. He didn't speak, almost as if He was wondering if he should tell me.
"It is Harry, right?" She asked. Harry nodded before, quite opposite to his recent outward display of shyness, quickly hid it, but I felt him squeeze my hand tighter when he spoke.
"I just- I don't know how it happened... I don't know how circumstances forcing me to open up, turned into feelings, and I don't understand..." he said, stumbling over his words.
"Draco, you're rambling, you're off topic, and you need to watch your breathing." I told him, aware that he was almost hyperventilating. "I never said to tell any Muggle Therapist what happened with the Boggart, or that Scorpius is seeing things. But maybe it would help him to just talk..."
"Harry... Merlin it's been forever Harry!" I said, taking him into a tight hug which he returned. I closed my eyes sinking into the moment. Soon enough though, I let go to look at him.
At one point, Draco asked if I was okay with him leaving me at the entrance to a shop. I immediately realized he'd probably wanted to get me something, I tried to tell him no.
I entered the room to find Harry looking as if he was 2 seconds from falling into a deep, much needed sleep.
Scorpius wasted no time allowing his dad to whisk him up into his arms and hold the boy with a tight yet tender, protective and loving grip. Draco placed a kiss on the crown of Scorpius' head and caressed his hair with shaking yet determined hands.
"Why don't you and Teddy go wake Harry," glancing to the boys, they wordlessly retreated to the room.
"Goodnight," I responded, almost whispering. I blinked multiple times, wondering when my breathing had stilled, effectively quieting my voice. I scanned the immediate area, only to discover that Luca had already made it far down the other end of the hallway, on his way to the Slytherin commons. I turned around, preparing to enter my own common room.
"I bet there's going to be another war," whispered Harry, his gaze low and fingers twitching on his lap. "I bet that's what they're planning... And I can't-
"Dada! Hi Harry! Dada everything was so much fun! We played outside the whole time and we played games like tag and-" he took a breath. I could feel the excitement radiating off of him.
I quickly pinched my shoulders back, rolling them in circles a few times, before heading out as two Slytherin boys were heading in.
"But surely... I mean..." I found myself at a severe loss for words. I didn't know how to counter him, I knew he could be right, but something that felt like a million daggers inside me said otherwise.
...But Dad still has me worried. This talk about people going missing. Dad's face changed in the blink of an eye once he went through the front door, going from angry to furious once Harry started yelling about that.
Luca was sat against the wall, knees to his chest, and robe draped over him as he looked up at me in alarm. It was almost as if he was using it as a shield of sorts, or to hide something. His eyes were rimmed pink, and he blinked back tears, continuing to make himself breathe deeply. I cautiously sat down beside him.
At the end of our meal, something rather odd had happened, our server asked if we could take a picture with her for her son, claiming we both looked two actors from some movies he enjoys. I looked over at Draco, who's face showed confusion. But, we agreed after clarifying that no, my name is not Daniel, and no, Draco's name is not Tom. Of course, we didn't find it necessary to tell the server our real names.
My expression softened and for half a second I considered sitting down and drowning in my sorrows with the two of them, just taking this garbled mess in my brain and slamming it to the ground in defeat, but it was within that same half a second that I was startled out of myself at the feeling of a large, slim hand grasping mine, followed by the short clipped words
We sat in the cabin. I watched as students walked by, silently acknowledging their attire. I scoffed at myself in my head.
"Oh, hey! Scorpius, these are my friends, Bonnie and Wendy," Teddy exclaimed, gesturing to his friends. I gave them a rigid wave of my hand. "How did you lose me from the platform to the train? We were right next to each other..." I became self-conscious of my facial expression; I was sure that my smile of relief now resembled an awkward grimace. I ignored Teddy's question.
I watched as Draco, masking his own alarmed expression, went to Scorpius, who was patiently solving a one hundred-piece puzzle.
I texted Hermione saying that we had left the hospital. Glancing at the time, it was already noon. I turned to Harry, planting a kiss on his cheek as we went down the pavement.
"All hail purebloods. Mudbloods can rot in hell," said the one with the morbid hoodie with a straight face. Ron, Harry, and I visibly tensed, then she broke out in uncontrollable laughter, as well as the rest of the teenagers. Ron, Harry, and I looked at each other, beyond worried. I understood the cruel attempt at joking, but even I wouldn't joke with something such as the war.
"Back then we didn't even know if there would be a future to think about. If you explain that you were merely doing what you could, he'll understand-"
When he fell over as a dead man, the thunk as head landed on the floor practically echoing in my ears, how everything else left my awareness as I realized
Malfoy stood there frozen in place while Ginny's wand was at his throat. As soon as Ginny made a move, Hermione stepped in front of him and deflected the bat bogey hex.
"Well I've been trying to get him to go out more. You know how he's been since it all..." she gestured towards Scarface.
"Harry- oh Merlin- come here..." I only heaved my short breaths as he sat down beside me, took me softly by the shoulders, and lifting me, leaning me into his chest. A tremor shook my core.
"I can see it. I'm not like that anymore, you don't have to-" I was cut off by the sound of moving behind me, I whipped my head over, noticing Scorpius in the corner. I got up, fuming, with a stern scolding on my mind, but was held back harshly by Harry.
"Okay!" Said Teddy enthusiastically. The two ran off and disappeared into Scorpius's bedroom.  I looked back at him.
Scanning the area, I noticed a group of women sitting in a circle of plastic chairs, talking about something, while one of them was tending to her crying infant, removing the child from the stroller and shaking a bottle to feed it.
That's actually quite how the entire day went. The house felt heavy with tension and every time I was caught near Scorpius it was like walking on egg shells. Scorpius didn't play his dancing game, or do a puzzle, or watch a movie. A lot of his day was spent walking around or being presumably in his room.
Luca, Victorie and I walked to the quidditch pitch. The entire trip was wordless, with the exception of a few mutters of excitement from Victorie. Luca said nothing, usually turning his head away whenever I looked, eventually stepping up to walk in front of me and Victorie. We arrived at the stadium, sitting down next to each other with me sitting in between both of them.
During dinner, Harry got another letter. I watched as he read it over silently. His face was emotionless the whole time as his eyes scanned left to right. Then, with a slow, deep, controlled breath, he closed his eyes, sitting there for a moment. He folded the letter and put it in his pocket, before standing up.
"Dada I'm scared. I don't want him to make fun of me. I don't want him to know that I pee in bed at night, I'm not supposed to do that and I don't know why or how to stop it-"
He left the room excitedly, closing the door. I was left in silence, glancing down at the taller man, fast asleep on top of me. How on earth am I going to move?
I sniffled again, removing my glasses so I could wipe my eyes. I set them down on the night stand. Before leading the both of us to lay down. I hugged him, burying my face into his chest.
"I mean, I could try, but piano and organ are so different, I would probably only be able to play simple music. It's also just been such a long time."
"Ron, and Hermione. They're my best friends." I let the smile grow bigger on my face. It felt nice, the happiness. "We've known each other since we were children. We've stuck together even through the worst of times." I looked off to the floor as it got further away from me while I fondly remembered everything Hermione, Ron and I have done together.
"Good morning, Ted! Are you... feeling alright?" I took hold of any nearby object as me and Wendy walked to the common room.
"Of course," he replied. "Have some water," he added. I saw him lean over to his nightstand and grab a glass, which I took gratefully.
"Applesauce." I told Harry, settling into the bed beside him. "It should be easy to keep down after throwing up." I explained, helping Harry sit next to me. "How are you feeling?"
, or at least trying to." Dada took Harry's hand. Their fingers laced together like a boy and a girl I saw on T.V once.
"I'd watch my tongue if I were you Weasley." I spat, venom coating my words. I shoved my hands in my pocket and stayed ahead of them, knowing I'd probably hex him into oblivion seeing his stupid face again.
"Why don't you tell her that though?" Asked Draco, sitting down on top if my desk. "I mean, tell her you want to talk in person. I don't know if you'd rather go to London or-"
"It's just, stupid stuff..." I said. The microwave beeped. And Draco turned over to turn off the microwave and take out my plate.
Things were silent for a long while, and we just stayed in that position on the floor while he calmed down slowly. I was thinking about what he'd said, and his comments were what determined me to write my own letter to Hermione, explaining today's events, and asking her if she knows anything. Every once in a while, Harry would twitch, and try to press himself further into me, muttering words I wish I heard properly. I would just keep him in my arms, letting him take the time he needed, occasionally passing my hand through his hair, silently saying simple, calming words. Eventually, I heard a sniffle come from him.
"H-hi. Happy Christmas-" I immediately moved out of the way of the front door, gesturing them indoors. "P-please, come in."
I walked over to Bonnie and Wendy, who were sitting on a couch in the corner, and sat next to Bonnie.
We had cleaned the house, helped Teddy begin the process of packing all of his belongings, cooked dinner- which I only ate half of- and saw some television, before sending the kids off to sleep. The two of us had been laying here for a while now, and my mind had been thinking about these past 3 days. I scooted closer into Draco, resting my head on his chest, before lazily mumbling something that had been on my mind. Something that, now that I think about it, is something that I would only tell him.
"Do you think it might be Teddy?" I whispered, becoming worried. My hand hovered over the door handle, almost as though I was scared to find out why Teddy was crying.
"Did- Draco's arm start hurting, tonight?" Scorpius bowed his head, placing his palms flat on his lap, stretching his hands and fingers in various ways.
, Harry. Besides. They have an Alan Parson's Project record. My dad loved that group. He would listen to them all the time," She explained, setting the needle on the record. Soon, music filled the room. "This is a much more modern record player," she added, turning up the volume with a knob. Enigmatic and calming music filled the area, and I only gave her an almost sad smile.
"Would you like me to get my speaker from next door? Or the radio? This party isn't much." I blinked a few times.
Feeling weary and strained, I stumbled down the hallway, through the door, to our bedroom. The early morning sun was shining, pouring its light and warmth through the house, but all I could think of was how my feet became heavier with each step I took.
Harry stayed staring at me, his eyes blown wide even through his exhaustion and his disheveled hair. His mouth was agape, and for a second he didn't move an inch.
"Sounds terrifying. People dying? Murder? You'll never catch me competing in something like that," I chuckled.
When Hermione found out about Ron, she was hit by a wave of pain so strong she screamed, gasping and gripping her mum and dad's hands desperately. Apparently, that was the one that did it, and she was rushed into the delivery room.
"And you know that you are my number one? That I'll always care for you? That nothing and no one will ever come before you?" Draco's voice wavered, but his words rang strong and true. Scorpius nodded again.
I swallowed. Harry turned our position into a hug, burying his face in my shoulder, and allowed himself to continue swaying to the beat of the music. I followed him wordlessly, allowing myself to close my eyes and lean into it.
That's what Draco had told Dr. Gilroy when she asked what we'd been up to lately. As usual, she pushed up her glasses, crossed her legs, and leaned forward, ready to write down what either of us said.
"Fine." I said. I sounded annoyed, but I was more than glad to give him one more. We heard another knock, followed by the front door opening. Harry and I sprinted over.
"She's smart, okay?! And I'm just... My marks aren't that great right now! I went to her for help and she gave it to me. She's not that mean to me either, actually not at all! But we aren't friends! She's always spouting all of this werewolf nonsense saying that you're going to kill us all! I can't be friends with her when she's doing something like that!" He explained breathlessly.
At the bedside, I saw the clock's red numbers shining 3:34. I sighed, watching as Draco pulled himself into bed and rolled over so I could get in on the same side. He reached over to bring his arm around my waist before I could pull the covers up, shifting so he could nestle himself between my chest and my chin. I brought my arm around his back.
More hot tears pooled and fell, wetting my pant knees, wetting my arms, dirtying my glasses. The light feeling in my head got worse, and I wondered if I might faint in here.
"Draco, breathe, listen to yourself!" He stopped, breathing quick and shallow. His gaze was cast downward and his eyes looked lost.
As I ate, I occasionally glanced up. I had a nagging feeling in my upper back and neck. I would try to look up and around me as discreetly as possible. I tried to scan around specifically to see if anyone was watching me, but even then, I looked around so fast I couldn't tell. I didn't want what happened to be real, and everything went back to hearty chatter that it almost feels like it wasn't.
"The letter you got yesterday was from your Muggle relatives?" I tensed, before nodding in agreement.
But somehow, I ended up... somewhere. Sitting at a table. I was so close to Draco that our legs were touching, and I kept it that way. I had gone completely silent. And I didn't care what anyone else was saying. I didn't even know what they were saying. I was too busy pouring all of my energy into not panicking, and staying grounded. And, there was a bowl of soup placed in front of me.
"Focus on my voice. Let me help you relax." In my head, I nodded. But my body didn't move at all. He brought his hand up and down my arm in a comforting manner, which I loved.
Scorpius then put down the domino I had pointed at, which earned a few groans around the table. A smirk came across my face. I got them good.
"I promise we'll see each other Teddy. I wouldn't dream of going even a month with out your smile lighting up the room." I told him.
"Oh yeah, like that makes it any better." I could hear Scorpius laughing at our conversation with me, though I doubt he understood why I was laughing so much. I saw Draco roll his eyes.
Soon, my eyes caught a photo opportunity with Spider-Man, and I knew exactly who would love that. I crouched down to his eye level, gaining his attention.
Anyone else would think he was perfectly fine. But the way he inched closer to me, and how he kept looking around at a house he recognized, just because there were new people around, I knew he was slightly nervous.
"I'm not mad... at you..." I heard him say. I took a deep breath. I can't believe I just told him things that nobody else knows about me.
"The- what?" I said in irritated confusion. That was when the man standing beside Kingsley's desk stepped forward, holding his hand out. The man was my height, with straight black hair styled neatly into place, fair skin, and Asiatic eyes. He was wearing a powder-blue shirt with a navy tie, and a black coat.
"Shit. Of course. And let me guess, Scorpius is welcome too? Because Draco won't go anywhere without him-"
I would have said no; I wanted to say no, Because all I really wanted to do at the moment was go home and sleep. Or rather, pass the time until I could pick Harry up from the hospital. Because honestly, I knew that tonight I wouldn't be resting well. The day was simply too busy and overwhelming. But, the truth is, I need to eat, and so does Scorpius, who didn't quite want to leave Rose's company yet. So, we sat down and had dinner with Ron, Hermione, and Rose.
. I began analyzing his behavior towards me. It really is nothing like he used to be. He's almost a completely different person.
"I don't know what she's getting at, but it's working!" Wendy shouted, his mouth in an excited 'O' shape.
Taking larger strides than ever before, I found my way to the nearest boys room. Entering, rustling and shuffling could be heard, along with a whisper of a jumbled string of 'shit... shit, shit, shit, shit.'
"Uhm, Ever since the events of the second war, all previously identified corrupt individuals were sent to Azkaban, and the Ministry rebuilt itself from the ground up, by our Minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt- a previous member of the now disbanded Order of The Phoenix." My heart was in my throat. "Each newly hired individual, including myself when I applied to work here nearly a decade ago, underwent a rigorous background check, as well as a three month probation period." I was shaking slightly, I found myself wanting to disappear, afraid I would mess up. "The Ministry's enhanced security protocols have ensured the safety and reliability of everyone who works here- who works to serve you, the public. That will be all for today."
"It's nothing important. My head just hurts a lot." I said, burying myself further into our hug, letting his warmth encase me.
"Hey, Ted. I'm good! Molly seems to have got herself into a compartment with Lucy, Dominique, Fred, and some friend of hers, so do you mind if I sit with you guys?" She peered around the small space, smiling and waving shyly to my friends. Gabriel was looking at her with wide eyes, awestruck.
"Yeah, but I won't be using a time turner or anything. I'm not crazy. It's one elective. Fits right into the schedule."
"Nope, just sitting under the covers... talking." The room went silent once more, with only the sound of Scorpius' paused game in the background.
It only took me a minute or so to wonder about Scorpius, and how he had reacted to the whole situation. Judging by how Draco is, it mustn't have been the most pleasant encounter.
"Merry Christmas Eve! Come in, come in." She said, ushering us through the front door before closing it.
I opened my eyes, taking in a sharp breath. My glasses were askew and half of my vision was covered by Draco's blue shirt. My hand clamped up in an attempt to stop the shaking.
He guided me gently into a sort of hug, his hand trailing up into my hair. "Tell me five things you can see."
"Okay but I need to go after you, so don't take long." I whispered, conscious of the two children sleeping in the room.
"Why doesn't he want to speak with me? He always does this: he runs and hides when it's important." She tried to go past me and I held out my arm slightly.
After a while, I glanced up at Harry, who stayed silent as he watched me patiently, almost like he knew I was trying to organize myself. I took a breath to continue speaking.
"They make it sound like he was evil, like he made me evil." I mumbled helplessly as I cried into Luca's shoulder.
"I didn't mean like that... I... you don't, feel that way anymore... right?" I asked, my voice becoming small. His expression softened as he looked to the floor, then into my eyes.
"If we only focus on the bad things..." he continued, his voice growing darker, and quieter, "we lose our ability to see the good. We become numb, we become but a single particle of dust floating through life, with no hope, no laughter... we fade away. I know that from experience...
Soon, we were residing still on the edge of the lakes opposite side, and we were led into the large, magnificent castle.
"Teddy's grandmother... Harry, I've actually been thinking about something that I wanted to discuss with you... about Teddy."
"What did it say?" He looked like he almost didn't want to know the answer to his question as he stared at the paper with a bursting feeling of betrayal.
"Scorpius can watch and learn as I absolutely destroy you all, then he can take over with my wand. Set up for three, then."
A strawberry-blonde girl with colorful clothing bounced from the armchair in the living room. She took my hand and shook it over and over.
He wiggled in his spot, and I realized he was resisting that urge to scratch himself out of anxiety. I took his hand, interlocking our fingers. He squeezed three times. I squeezed back.
"Can we make a snowman?" Asked Harry after the laughter subsided, I looked at him, then at Scorpius, nose and cheeks tinted red, a wide smile across his face.
GUYS THIS CHAPTER I STAYED UP TILL 4AM WHEN CO-AUTHOR AND I WROTE IT AND WE WERE LITERALLY CRYING THE EMOTIONS HIT US IN THE FACE LIKE A 500 TON WEIGHT FLYING THROUGH THE AIR.....
Oh boy, the last task!!!! And also the last Hogwarts chapter in this book!!!! Everything after this really goes a little downhill. But don't worry, everything will be resolved, all in due time!
"I ran into my mother at Diagon Alley and she wanted me to visit the Manor. I'm sorry, okay?! I didn't want to be there, nor was I planning on staying so late."
I tried to speak to him, to call out for him and ask him what it was, what got him to turn his mood so suddenly, but the words couldn't seem to make it out of my mouth. I was just too tired to do so. I guess weeks without really sleeping at night, and doing so much in the days between, does that to you.
The smoothly spread navy ink of the night, dappled by the ever-distant, white, shining stars, had me in a sort of trance the evening after everything with the ministry. I couldn't help but lose myself as I watched the sky, thinking about everything, and nothing- trying to work out how I was going to answer Scorpius' latest question of "What happened eleven years ago that Harry mentioned?" without lying, and without tainting his image of me, his last remaining parent, and the only person he has to look up to in his young life. A part of me hoped he would forget, so I could tell him about it when he was older.
Wood, a drawer, rummaging, feverish searching. Cold metal, a sharp tip, blood. Screaming, anger, a sinking ache in my chest, more blood. The hallway, a voice, a crash, a bed, and finally, darkness.
"Still nothing," he replied. His hand found its way into my hair, and he brushed it back thoughtfully.
One time, we found Scorpius playing on his game console in the middle of the night. Draco wasn't mad, but he told him that we need to be asleep at night, not playing games. He had said okay, and that was that. Draco was sure that Scorpius had learned his lesson, especially when he was absolutely exhausted at Rose's birthday party the next day.
"How could you do all of those things, dad?" Scorpius asked, his voice shaking and faltering as he continued. He whipped his head, facing away from me.
I sighed and pursed my lips. A few seconds later, I got up from the chair, moving it neatly back into its place. They were picking their next song.
"Oh, yes. I've just never had anything like it." I clarified, making sure she didn't think there was something I didn't like. The truth is I am incredibly grateful for her inviting the three of us into her home. As odd, different, and loud as everything could be, I had never been treated with such hospitality before without wondering if I was manipulating the person into doing it.
"Oh, okay... so why are you so... shocked now? I mean, I'm sorry but, you can hardly say it isn't obvious. We've slept together... loads of times. You definitely seem into it." He began, I cut him off.
"But it was different with me... I'm not everyone else. I saw you for six years, and I wouldn't be surprised if I was among the first to see you cry, albeit by accident." I tried explaining, while scrambling through my brain.
"Yeah. I swear it seems they have nothing better to do." I angrily stabbed a carrot on my plate and sticking it in my mouth- my food had gone unappetizingly cold.
"Thanks." I told her, unsure of what else to say or think. I got up from the lawn chair and opened the door to go inside.
I locked eyes with him briefly before looking down at the contents of my utensil, all too aware of my rumbling stomach and my struggle to keep the fork steady in my hand. Scorpius casting a quick curious glance towards me was what made my nerves jump as I shoved the fork into my mouth, chewing slowly once I'd realized it, cautiously swallowing. That's how every meal I'd attended lately has been going.
"I know. Don't worry though. I'm here from the beginning, so I can help. You just have to let me. Okay?"
"And don't hesitate to tell me the truth," I added, craning my head over to see his full face, fully aware that he was avoiding the eye contact. I rested myself against the headboard, taking my hand of his shoulder, and looking straight at the wall.
I had just sent Scorpius to get a shower when an Owl flew in through the open patio door with a letter, which I recognized as Hermione's owl that comes every week. Assuming the letter was mine for once, I grabbed it, reading.
"Oh, bugger off." He told me, dismissing my question. We had both calmed down now, and just in time too, our server had arrived with our food.
"Th-that means... we're not really gone from all of that..." he asked, and I could tell he was beginning to overthink.
it." I said, my voice quickly falling from its thunderous boom. Draco looked at me like I'd just hurt him.
I glanced at him again, noting that his gaze had once again resided to his lap as he played with his nail, biting it, inspecting it, then biting it again, seemingly no longer for maintenance, but out of a sort of nervousness or anxiety.
"He helped Uncle Harry in the war so much that he and mum died for him," I gasped for air. "But n-no. Just because Rita Skeeter prints a few rubbish articles-" I sniffled "-suddenly parents tell their children to stay away. Suddenly people think I'm a danger- a monster-" I closed my eyes tight, unable to speak anymore.
We did exactly as she said before walking out the front door too the hospital and searching for an empty alleyway.
I felt my arms shake as I held on to the bed. "It... I started it. The second war." I breathed in, trembling.
"Didn't you tell me you were going to stop after that one party Seamus threw in 6th year?" He asked, leaning towards me.
At that moment, with the setting sun giving his face a soft glow, and him smiling in a way I almost never see- innocently- and the flour that somehow exploded all over his face, I couldn't help but smile at him. Reaching my hand to get a strand of powder-white hair out of the way of one of his eyes, a chuckle escaped me.
Just then, Scorpius ran over to me, sending me into a hug. Due to his age it was really an awkward hug around the legs, but I patted him, signaling to let go, before crouching to his height, and giving him a proper one.
"Oh, stop it. Who cares about numbers anyway?" I stuck my tongue out at her, to which she lightly smacked me on the forehead.
"I see, and I understand fully the gravity of your predicament. Well, I assure you there is absolutely nothing to worry about." He said, taking out his clipboard. "So, Harry, Draco is your..." My heart rate sped up, making me tremble, and for a second I thought I wouldn't be able to answer the man.
The bell rang, and Professor Sinastra dismissed the class all at once. Gabriel and I nearly shot off our seats in unison, quickly making our way out of the classroom, my thoughts racing as fast as we were. We passed the classroom door and into the archway of the stairway. Gabriel was in front of me, desperately trying to keep his books from toppling over too soon. I was briskly following behind him, looking out for any signs of Luca. We came to the end of the stairway, and slowed down once we saw him. My metamorphmagus was thinking ahead of me, it seems, because I felt my appearance change into another entirely. Even still, I put the hood of my robes on, and waited at the corner just before the staircase.
"I'm fine, Teddy. It just didn't go well when my mother first told me about this. I was little, I had nightmares for weeks. I-" She looked up, quickly shaking her head. "I'm sorry."
"Mrs. Granger, I assume you're ready for the press conference in five minutes?" I glanced up from my paperwork, locking eyes briefly with Kingsley. This was my 10th press conference since being promoted to Head Information Supervisor late last year, but today was different. The Ministry was going to take the public's questions about Harry and Draco today. Well,
Normally, I would say yes without a second thought. Now, though, I had more in mind. I thought we could all use some sunlight, and outside today looked lovely. "So that's why you're being extra sweet today, don't think I didn't notice!" I exclaimed playfully. "How about this?" I began, thinking. "How about, we eat breakfast, first. Then, I'm going to try and get Harry to join us. I think he might like to go outside too." I suggested.
"What matters is it happened," Longbottom interrupted. I leaned back in my chair, forcing my gaze to return to neutrality. "Now we just need to find out what's behind the kidnappings... do we know who is taking people?"
The Durmstrang champion had pulled her loved one out of the water, a bubble encapsuling her head. She came up to the surface of the water with a gasp, and loud cheers exploded.
"Come on, let's make breakfast together." I looked up at him, as if I needed to make sure this was real. Then I took his hand and he helped me out of the bed gently. I examined the bandages on my arms and the small lines of old blood that had gotten through.
We haven't left the house once except for the day Ginny gave birth, and so far there's nothing about us flooding the papers, thank Merlin. There was however, an article about Ginny, and James Sirius Potter-Weasley. It's brought up questions, and Ginny is so tired of them asking why I'm nowhere to be seen after 'our' child was brought into this world- especially when every offer of help from me has been refused. She's staying with Molly again, and she's Owled me about how tiring it is, but how she wouldn't trade it for the world. How her family has been there for her like they never have- and that I should stop worrying about them.
"No... I just- walk to clear my mind. I've been thinking about... my parents, really, among other things."
are, but something's not right about this whole thing. Especially," She took another gulp of air, "Especially the last book- the battle. It's just...
"All you did for me? Which part do you think it was? The starving? The chores? The yelling? Or the cupboard?" He stared at me, looking like he'd just been slapped. My hand gripped the fork so tightly it could have bent.
"Harry, there you are." I whipped my head around to fine Hermione, Ron, and Rose weaving their way through the crowds.
Harry feels the unexplainable urge to be a sort of parent for Scorpius. Let's see what he does about it.
That was the question that made her analog clock tick exceptionally loud today. It hurt, and it had made me come out of the conversation with Dr. Gilroy. At the moment all I could think of was how loud the-
I thought, cuddling deeper into him. I closed my eyes, and like that, I welcomed the peaceful darkness of my mind.
"Draco, you did no such thing." Harry's hand kept passing up and down my back in a soothing manner as he let me bury my face into the hollow between his shoulder and his head. I gasped and shuddered and held Harry like my life depended on it.
I shook the thought from my head, focusing on Draco, especially as I noticed the moisture building up on the chest of my shirt.
"Isn't it a... soup?" He asked her, which only elicited a disappointed shaking of the head from her. "A soup when it's alone! A topping and a sauce with anything else."
"Who even did this, Ron? What kind of things were you sent to investigate that had you turning up in the hospital?" I sat down in the chair beside me, waiting patiently for Ron to answer. His weak smile faded completely, into an expression that held pain and concern.
"Alright, alright." she quieted them. "But remember, we're coming back tomorrow. Then the day after we're going to see if there's anything happening in the neighboring park."
"Everything was just... weighing down on me... It all still is. The difference is that I'm still... recovering from...". My voice trailed off, and this genuinely felt like the most difficult thing I'd ever had to admit. Justifying my own death.
"That's okay. That's fine." Draco told me, shifting so that my lazy leaning into him could be an actual hug. That was when I realized that a splitting headache had brought itself forward. I sighed, twitching in an attempt to soothe my itch- pushing it back.
And so that's what we did. Hand-in-hand, we went to the balcony, sharing the same beach chair, leaning into each other, listening to the music, and watching the golden sun set over the skyline. Nobody else existed, it was us.
"Could you... remove the stain from my bedsheets, please? And then we can go get a glass of water?" He knitted his brows and looked at me.
He sucked in another breath, still holding my hand, his grip never faltered, but I felt him shaking.
"It is my professional opinion that visiting your relatives' home is a bad idea." She looked at both of us. "You need to make that clear with your cousin too, Harry." I swallowed, turning to Draco, before quickly turning back to Dr. Gilroy.
"Yes. I don't think I got really good until I was 14 or so... I started when I was 10. It took just more than the entire summer to learn. After that, it was just about getting good. And being at Hogwarts meant taking significant time off, which slowed me down. But, I would play whenever I got the chance. One time, I even got the room of requirement to summon me an organ. Because I just really wanted to play and be alone that day."
"I forgot to bring flowers... Is it okay that I create some?" I was, unsurprisingly, met with silence. I took my wand out, and created a quaint bouquet of flowers. With the ghost of a smile softly forming, I placed the flowers down into the vase by their grave, another tear sliding mindlessly down my cheek.
That night, my left arm flared in pain again. Then the night after, and the night after that. Those three days were heaven and hell; I tried to get as much of the former as I could during the day, and the nights... At least I wasn't completely alone.
"This bloke doesn't have anything to wear for the Yule Ball and he tells me this just now!" Wendy exploded on both of us, then placed his hand on his hips and sighed with a disdainful look on his face.
"I wanna stay with you." His words were a sleepy and quiet jumbled mess, but they were comprehensible at least.
Every exhale pained my chest, and every inhale scratched at my throat. I felt familiar strong hands wrapping around me.
I took in a sharp, deep breath, and kept it in my lungs. Soon enough though, I felt myself exhale unevenly.
After eating roughly half, I decided to get up and go to the office room. I walked in and saw 4 letters. I picked them up. All of them were from Ron and Hermione. I decided to open the most recent one, sent today.
"Yeah, Ted. I'm fine though, it went well. Now go, play with Scorpius," he urged with a smile. I obeyed, turning to go upstairs. Scorpius had been waiting at the top.
We spoke about various unimportant things, and it was quite a relaxing, entertaining evening. The indistinct sounds of children next door was ignored, as we jokingly teased each other, told jokes, and laughed. Harry didn't finish his food, as usual, but he'd eaten more than enough. To be honest, I'd probably served too much.
"I know you're sleeping, but please talk to me. Let me help..." I had to wipe a tear off my eye, one I didn't notice I had shed.
I felt his hand go to my hair, caressing it softly. I leaned into him, wanting nothing but his comfort at the moment. "Harry, you don't need to apologize for a single thing. You're struggling, you're pushing people away because it's what you're used to; you still aren't used to talking. That's okay. I know how it feels. I also know that it doesn't help- I know because that's what I've always done. I've always kept everybody at a distance." He paused for a second before speaking again. "I'm here for you. I won't let you isolate yourself no matter how hard you try." At this I let out a trembling sob.
"Of course. Just make sure you don't lose them." I said with a smile. Ginny and I agreed late last night that it would be easiest if we came by floo and that was quite convenient. I won't need to be driving around that way. After eating breakfast with Scorpius and helping him get ready, then getting ready myself, we flooed over to the Potters residence.
"Oh! Well I'm glad you're feeling better. How has this last month been? After all, it's September now! That leaves a whole of July and August to catch up on." She chuckled.
"I would also like to introduce our new Herbology teacher, and former Auror, Professor Neville Longbottom!" At this, there was not only applause, but also some cheering. I applauded a little more enthusiastically- I know Neville. He's friends with Uncle Harry, Aunt Ginny, and Ron and Hermione.
"Hey! It's about to be time for class, erm... We should move along for breakfast," Gabriel suddenly interrupted, which caused me and Victorie to turn towards him. His eyes were wide and his neck craned forward, as if he was ready for a projectile to come whizzing out of someone's wand. I pursed my lips, glad that Gabriel had such a penchant for talking. He cleared his throat.
That was how I knew that he had been silently searching and begging for forgiveness in any possible way. He had been desperate for someone to tell him that he didn't deserve what his mind was telling him. Harry needed the reassurance, and nobody had given it to him.
He'd said, which made me laugh. Scorpius didn't though, because he didn't know how Gobstones worked. I taught him how to play, and soon enough, I was being squirted in the face with putrid smelling liquid more often than him. I smiled at the memory.
"Because movies aren't my dad," he retorted. Draco rolled his eyes with a fond shake of the head, then he turned back to me, smiling softly again. He squeezed my hand three times, and I squeezed back.
After a bit of more uncomfortable silence, and me not wanting to stand and watch him clean plates, utensils and cups, I spoke while drawing my wand to cast a cleaning spell.
It seems I'd eaten less than anyone else at the table- having only had a few bites here and there, while the rest of them were nearly done. I swallowed my saliva, and wordlessly responded to him by finding his hand and squeezing it.
But it made sense at the same time. How their hands touch but didn't touch, how they would almost say something to each other but didn't. I breathed in a long and trembling breath.
"Harry can you please get Teddy from his room?" Said the Weaslette as she served another plate. At that I saw Harry leave upstairs out of the corner of my eye.
I didn't realize that I hadn't yet answered until I felt Draco's hand go over mine, squeezing in reassurance. "Harry?" He asked softly. I nodded is a faint gesture that I'm still present.
"Yeah. I'll be there." I told him. I watched as he walked away with his head down. All I could think was
"You see? It's only me... you're safe, Harry." I felt a rush of heat flood my cheeks as I blinked away further tears, trying to see properly who was in front of me.
"What did you do when everyone believed that you were crazy because of her?" It seems he wasn't ready to answer that because he didn't say anything at first.
Bringing a palm to my head, I wondered what form their fight would take this time. Though, they did sound much more civil than the rest of their conversations the days before. With careful steps, trying to make as little noise as possible, I made my way over to Scorpius' room. I stopped short at the open doorway, placed each hand on the frame and inched my face slowly forward, waiting for two nearly identical furious faces challenging each other.
"Should not be upset. From what I've seen, he loves and cares for you tremendously, and if he cares just as much for his son, he will probably be happy to see the two of you getting along."
do it this time. I groaned when my eyes settled on our new location. I shouldn't have trusted him to take us back home. I glared at him, ferociously. I don't want to tell some stranger about all of my crap. I don't want another person worrying about me.
"I promise I'll try to talk to people more." I told him, seeing a smile come across his features. His smile always seemed to trigger one for myself as well.
"I want to be mad," she began. "I'm absolutely furious... but there isn't a more accurate collective documentation of all of those years." She remarked. "And even then," she chuckled helplessly through her tears. "It's littered with hints of truths, followed by guesses of what happened next... for example," I let her leave my hold, albeit reluctantly, as she reached for the book at the bottom of the pile, one she had already previously read, that was bursting at the seams with notes on small bits of yellow parchment, attached by a sticky side, and similarly designed multi-colored little flags sticking out of the top and side of the book.
I took a moment to remember the fiendfyre from the Room of Requirement- all of the things that could have gone wrong, how chaotic and desperate it all felt.
"I'll care for the trolley, Teddy. Go on, grab your trunk and owl. They'll sit in the compartment with you. Remember I put a sandwich in the pocket of your robes. That'll be your lunch, dear. There's money in your trunk if you need it, but I doubt you will. It's enough for you to get something if the opportunity arises." I heard her say. It seems my feet had carried me to the front of the train along with loads of other children. Many in regular clothing and holding their robes in their hands, like me. Some, however, were already in their school robes. Andromeda had assured me last night though: "The ride is long enough for you to put on and take off your robes 50 times."
"Why am I not surprised?" He asked with a slight chuckle, I felt a smile tug at my lips. I love when he sounds happy.
"Hey, it's alright," I made a noise of discomfort in response to the voice, blinking several times to regain my bearings. The early evening sun was giving everything a soft orange glow. I looked around, finding a pant leg first. Blearily, My vision followed it upwards, until I was met with Draco's face. He smiled softly.
"Because, Scorpius. Actions have consequences. Mistakes, too. You need to clean it yourself- at least for the most part, since you're young- and you can't use magic anyway." Draco explained, vanishing the paper towels Scorpius had already used to their capacity, and pointing out spots he may have missed. "Now what do we do?"
It was just as Draco and I were getting kicked out because of the visiting hours that we'd already stayed beyond, that Ron showed up, out of breath, and breaking into the grin of a lifetime when he saw his wife, son, and daughter together.
