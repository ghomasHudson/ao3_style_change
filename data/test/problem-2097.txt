The man looked at him for a while. Draco was sure people around them heard the whole talk, but he really couldn’t care.
“Hello Ignatius, Olivia. How are you doing?”
Draco chuckled. “No, in a few years.”
Draco smiled as his mother-in-law took the baby in her arms and smiled brightly at him. The Greengrass family may be as pure, and their education as strict as the Malfoys, Ignatius and Olivia were both loving parents and grandparents. He couldn’t really imagine what kind of grandfather Lucius would have been, but he liked to think that he, too, would have loved his grandson. Maybe not very expressive about it, but still loving.
"Hey, Potter. I think we talked about me riding you, earlier. Wanna try?"
“Hey. I’m sorry, Love.”
Harry laughed but took his hand and followed him inside. “How kind of you, Mr Malfoy!”
"Mr Malfoy? Your wife is waiting for you for the ultrasound. If you want to see your baby, it's now or never." She said cheerfully and excitement ran through his veins.
"Nope."
"Okay. Turn around." He said and Draco obliged. A second later, he was on his belly, face in the pillows and ass up in the air for Potter to see. "Merlin, you're gorgeous."
“Of course, I do! I mostly have to drive for work, but I’m pretty good at it.”
At the end of the war, a board was created to finance the most needed works for the school and Draco had entered it right away. He knew Potter did too, but never saw him at any of these meetings before. So, he was quite surprised to see the man that day. Surprised, but relieved.
“Hey, I’m joking. We fucked every night at your mother’s house. Two nights without sex won’t kill us.”
“Hey! I... I went back to Astoria’s room, but the nurse said you left with the baby. So, I came here to wait for you.”
"Do you have company? I thought you were at a board’s meeting?"
"No, that's enough. Fuck me now, Potter."
"So,... you’re gay too, huh?"
“I love you too.” Draco murmured against his lips as they kissed.
Draco and Harry took the luggage out of the car’s trunk and followed her into the house. The amazed look on Harry’s face made Draco laugh. The house was very pretty inside too. Warm and cosy, nicely furnished. The main room’s walls were all white and the brownish tiles on the floor felt welcoming. The dining room had a long oval-shaped table surrounded by ten chairs. On the left, three steps lower, was the living-room with comfy-looking armchairs and a wooden coffee table. On the right was the kitchen, not big but modern and practical. The three rooms all had French-doors opening on the covered terrace, the swimming-pool and the garden. The last rooms on ground floor were two bedrooms and two others were on first floor.
Teddy nodded, apparently very concentrated and Draco got up. Then, he noticed the arrival of Astoria’s parents and excused himself to go greet them.
"Harry!" Ron Weasley suddenly appeared from nowhere and threw an arm over his friend’s shoulder. "Please, go tell your new sex toy to stop being so fucking annoying! I think George’s about to punch him and throw him outside, and so am I!" Then, he seemed to see who Potter was talking to and frowned. "Oh, hello Malfoy."
Draco’s face fell a bit, then closed. He had to do it. "Nothing changed, Potter. I just wanted you to know I can’t offer you more than tonight."
“So, is everything alright with... him?”
“Yes. We were there this morning with Scorpius. We stayed an hour or so. You?”
“Obviously not. Or you wouldn’t have been sleeping in my bed for the past month.” Draco yawned. His eyes felt so heavy.
Draco moaned both at the words and the feeling of Potter moving in him. He knew he was tight. It was, in his opinion, one of his best assets.
He didn’t see Harry on the way there. If he had to make a call, he probably went in the living-room. Who was he calling so early anyway? Work? A
"Well, congrats, then. You must be happy to have a son. The Malfoy's name is safe."
“A two nights stay in a hotel. In Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat?”
“Yeah.” Draco picked the bottle in the bag, put the milk in it and discreetly warmed it with a non-verbal spell. “Can you pick him up?” He asked Harry and, when the baby was settled in the man’s arms, he gave him the bottle. “Here, you can feed him.”
“Fuck! You feel so good, Draco. Keep going. Faster.” Harry helped him by moving his hips up to meet his ass.
"You should. He's… wait. Oh, shoot! He's coming over!"
The baby stirred a little in his arms but didn’t cry. He just looked at Draco’s face and moved his tiny arms as if he was stretching, making the two men laugh softly. Once seated comfortably against the cushions, Draco held him with only one arm and took his fingers to the baby’s face. He gently stroked his cheeks, carefully at first. He was afraid to harm him. Then, as he saw he wasn’t crying or anything under the touch, he kept on touching his face, sighing at how soft it was, then moved to his arms and how so tiny fingers. The moment his son closed his fingers around his, he knew he could never let go of him. Not without fighting.
Damn, Potter was sexy! Broad shoulders, perfectly toned chest and abs, and a gorgeous massive cock.
"But nothing serious."
“Fuck! Stop saying this kind of things, Draco. It makes me want to cum already.” Draco’s laugh disappeared in a kiss. “You’re ready?”
No. Not more than
"A vow? Like an unbreakable one or...?"
Draco sighed. He felt so good. In a bit less than one hour, they would leave their suite and drive to the airport to go home. This week has been wonderful and the last two days even more. Being all alone with his son and with Harry in such a beautiful place felt nice. And peaceful. The night before, they ate at the hotel’s restaurant and ordered champagne in their room. The two lovers stayed up late, waiting for midnight and the fireworks, cheering and talking about the new year, about their projects, what they expected for the next twelve months. Draco felt happier than ever.
Arrived at the end of the West Wing, he knocked on the door and entered without waiting for an answer.
Draco had gone to dozens of parties and balls at the Ministry, but never saw Potter at any again. Didn't like the attention, they said. But this time, he was there. Fancy dress robes, untamed hair, bright green eyes and a gorgeous young blond guy on his arm.
He couldn’t know what the future holds. He couldn’t know if Harry will stay with them or leave in a few months. He couldn’t know if Astoria would ever get better and come back to live at the Manor with them, help him raise their son. He couldn’t know all that.
“Hum, Dr Joyce Piren.”
“Yes, Malfoy. On a broom. That
“Le soir du réveillon est toujours très demandé, mais nous avons toujours des tables réservées exclusivement pour les suites. Je peux donc vous ajouter aux réservations.”
Potter walked to him and took his lips, ravishing it and lifting the other man in his arms. He then turned around and threw Draco on the bed, making him scream in delight.
The emotion he saw in her eyes, raw and pure, made his heart beat faster. Of course, she would love her grandson. But knowing it and seeing it were two different things. He gave his mother the baby and watched her cuddle him.
He didn't have to wait two years to see Potter again, this time. Not even two months.
The three of them laughed when the baby turned his big blue eyes towards his father, visibly amazed by his tone.
“Hyperion? I get that Scorpius is a constellation, but what is Hyperion for?”
"No. Mine will do. Rules." He added with a shrug.
Draco signed a paper, took the key and turned to Harry. “It’s all set. Let’s go to our room.”
“He’s hungry?”
“Language, Potter.” Draco showed Scorpius who was sucking on his father’s finger. He was hungry already.
“Do you think he’s hungry?” He heard Harry ask right next to his ear.
"But What?"
Come on! Why did he come here, to Draco’s table? Just to bother him or to speak? Draco rolled his eyes as the brunette was playing with his fingers over the table.
Draco frowned a little. “Isn’t it too cold?”
The first time he met Potter again was two years after the war at some Ministry ball.
He smiled. “You’ll be an amazing dad.”
And the man complied and sucked him harder, driving him to ecstasy when he brushed a finger against his hole. Draco came hard into Harry’s throat, his fingers buried in the black locks, pulling at it when the pleasure hit him.
He walked to the changing table, laid him on it carefully and looked into the bag he took with him. The one Harry went to fetch in Astoria’s bathroom, where all the baby’s stuff was. He took the little onesie with bunnies on it, plus a diaper and started to dress his son. This was something he longed to do. Change him, dress him, just take care of him. He took his time, enjoyed the privileged moment and, when Scorpius was all set and miraculously still asleep, he laid him in his crib, all warm in his bumper. A part of him wanted to stay here and watch at the baby for hours, but he knew he had to sleep for at least two hours before going to St Mungo’s with him. He thought about taking the crib with him, but decided otherwise.
won't? ‘Cause if it's the latter, the way he’s looking at you right now tells a whole different story, Sweetheart."
“You’re drooling, babe.”
He looked at his glass, still half-full. "Well, I guess I still have to finish my drink, so..."
“So, how was Scorpius’ first flight? Did he cry?”
"Move, Potter."
Draco nibbled at his lip. "Hum, actually... Don’t worry about that, I'll not be alone."
“Okay. I’ll put the one with the bunnies, if you want.”
It was a bit weird to talk to his in-laws about the man he was sleeping with. But when he married Astoria, they had talked it out and made things clear from the very beginning. And after four years, the idea of him being gay and not spending his whole life with their daughter finally worked its way in their brains.
“Who was that?” Harry asks Rosie, as he helps her shelve some books. He’s definitely gotten a lot closer to Rosie in the month, and every interaction makes Harry like her more. She certainly seems like someone he would be friends with.
“I hope this nightmare will end soon,” he mutters, and Hermione reaches across the table to rest a hand on his chest, smiling supportively. Ron nods his head and gives a weak smile.
Scorp sniffles, he had stopped crying as they made the fort, but his sniffles weren’t stopping, “like a dragon steals them?” He says, and Harry honestly has no idea where his obsession with dragons recently had come from. He thinks of asking Ron, but that might be the wrong Weasley.
Harry’s heart drops for the second time and he holds Draco a little bit tighter, realizing that he almost didn’t come to see Draco. He can’t imagine what he would’ve done if they had lost Draco again. He doesn’t want to think about it.
Draco smiled and set his notepad down, "I think we should start with what potion you're trying to make," he said, reaching for his cup and taking a quick sip. It tasted a little off, but he didn't want to grimace right in the face of his client.
i actually like this chapter a lot. nothing really important happens and yet it manages to be pretty much double the length of my other chapters. Thats for you, commenter who complained about chapter lengths. Also idk shit about crime solving especially fantasy wizard crime solving so i mean dont judge me if its wrong... i just wanted gay angst okay i did my best.
<3 ty and dont expect me to double the words again a 2000 word average is all i have in me
not to visit Draco again?” Ron says, tone hopeful. He reaches across the table to grab the coffee and stands up, stretching.
"Welcome! Welcome! Uh, welcome! Take your time!" Rosie said, also clearly thrown off by the weird order. Draco tried to speed walk over to her, behind the counter, but Spencer got to him before he could get there.
talk to me if you need.”
Draco thinks he may have gone insane
Harry feels tears well up immediately. He isn’t sure how to comfort Scorp without revealing the truth, so he calms him down and makes the two of them hot chocolate. The two of them then grab every comfortable blanket and pillow they can find and set them all up on the couch, making a fort.
Harry is pacing his living room, glancing over at the unconscious body on his couch intermittently. He knows Draco’s not injured or dying, a healer had looked him over and promised that he just had a bit of sleeping draught, and he’d be awake in no time. This didn’t stop Harry from worrying, chewing his nails and tugging at his hair. He cast a quick tempus, and realized it hadn't been three minutes since he last checked. Alright, he needs to calm down. He forces himself to stop pacing and takes a deep calming breath, trying not to spiral.
Harry smiles into his own cup, things are really starting to look up for them, he’s hopeful and excited.
gone insane. Why on earth is he suddenly so fucking sad? The sight of the cup has made him feel like he’s missing something super important, an ache in his chest forming. He refuses to let the tears fall and looks up at the three people who clearly have also gone insane. Harry is looking at him with clear and open concern, Ron is watching curiously and Hermione has the decency to look guilty.
Harry's eyes narrow, this Spencer's guy clearly doesn't know Draco at all.
"This is harassment. I already told you, I never dated Harry. He's a stupid know-it-all and I haven't seen him in years. Besides, he's married," Draco says, ignoring the sharp intake of breath from the direction of the customers. He glances towards them and sees that they're all talking now. Why in the world didn't they come in all at once if they knew each other?
"Oh wow, you must be new. Spencer McDonald is super in love with Draco right now, basically the whole town knows about it after he tried to do a really grand gesture in the middle of town and Draco just walked away," she laughs at the memory, "word spreads fast in such a small town."
“Okay! See you later papa! I hope you’ve been reading my letters, we have so much to talk about!” he says as him and Molly leave once again.
Draco was in the middle of trying to avoid Spencer when the door jingled three times in a row. Why would the three new customers not just walk in all at once? He sighed.
"Having any trouble?" He asks, and Harry has to internally force himself not to chuckle at his customer service voice. He had never heard Draco talk like that, so falsely friendly. Despite the strange tone of voice and the fact that Draco doesn’t know him, Harry gets excited all the same. He can’t help the slightly goofy grin that appears on his face.
“Scorp, papa loves you more than anything in the entire world, he’s just very busy. He probably writes you everyday, but maybe the letters just can’t reach us?” Harry isn’t sure if he’s helping or making it worse, but it’s all he can think of to say.
He walks into his shop, barely acknowledging all the people who wave to him as he walks. He enters the shop and opens it, later than usual. Not very many customers show up, probably due to the late start. As the day continues, Harry is stuck thinking of his visit to Draco. He can’t help the smile that rests on his face for the majority of the day, which Theo comments on when he shows up to give Harry lunch.
"I know right? What a catch, but Draco and I have become very close over the months, and I know for a fact he hates when people are obsessed with him, so if you expect to come in here everyday and stalk him like some knock off Spencer McDonald then think again," Rosie says, crossing her arms and glaring at Harry. Harry pauses, raising an eyebrow.
"I'm absolutely sure, his coworker even referred to him as Draco. He seemed friendly with her, he referred to her as Rosie," Neville explains, and Ron leans forward in his seat, being the only auror in the room means it's important for him to know all the details.
“You know me, I couldn’t stop myself from seeing him,” Harry defends himself, “anyways, it was a good thing anyways.”
“Sounds good to me, I’ll talk to you again,” he puts a hand on Harry’s shoulder as he passes, “and you can
“It’s lucky you were here to catch it, I can’t imagine what would have happened if you hadn’t been here.”
"Nerd," He murmured, and before Draco could respond their lips were pressed together. Draco flicked the back of Harry's neck at the comment but otherwise didn't respond. He did respond however, to the kiss. It quickly got heated, and Draco threaded his fingers in Harry's hair.
They eventually broke apart for air, and Harry went back to Dracos neck, "perhaps I can be persuaded to stay a few minutes," Draco whispered, and Harry leaned back to grin at him.
“What’s… what's his name?” he says, and he can see Harry's heart break through his eyes.
"Harry, it won't be good for business if you're caught snogging someone right where you work," Draco said, putting his finger over Harry's mouth when he attempted another kiss. Harry frowned.
"Maybe obliviation, but even then they're just a vague sense of what happened. Draco sounds far too sure that Harry is a straight man married to Ginny," Hermione explains, and Harry's heart does not calm down even a little bit.
Draco smiled fondly, before a knock on his door brought him back to reality.
Ron had set up a last minute portkey the day previous, that would place them directly outside the town. There was a ten minute walk from where they landed to the library that Draco worked at, and as they walked they went over their admittedly weak plan again. Once they made it to the door, all three of them paused. Hermione sighed and walked in. Ron shrugged and followed after her.
Neville sodding Longbottom, Draco hasn't seen him properly since Hogwarts but he's not hard to recognize, that's not the problem. The problem is Draco specifically came to this far away little town because there was absolutely zero wizard or witch activity, he'd looked forever to find a nice place without any magic visitors. He'd been here for four months and hadn't seen a single wizard or witch, he'd been sure that it would work out. Of course, nothing ever worked out for Draco, he should have expected it.
I wonder if I’m even writing Theo right I don’t remember him at all lmao. Comments are highly appreciated, now that I’ve run out of pre written work :’))
"Listen can I just come through? I'll go in, he won't mind," Harry asked, and she looked hesitant before nodding.
Once again, Harry is tossing and turning, trying to fall asleep, but this time he has a different reason.
As soon as they're out the door, Harry lets out a deep breath. They walk in complete silence, until someone walks into Harry. A tall man in a black coat, far too warm for the weather Harry thinks.
Harry peers through the books again and sees the two of them speaking for a moment before the man gives Draco some sort of drink. Draco says something and then takes a big sip, and Harry’s heart is beating a mile a minute. He instinctively reaches for his wand, and it’s not a second later that Draco crumbles to the ground. Harry jumps to action, instinctively casting stupefy at the coffee guy, who hadn’t noticed him. After the man falls to the ground Harry rushes to Draco’s side, making sure he’s alive.
Harry, Ron and Hermione leave soon after that. To avoid suspicion, Hermione takes out a book at random on bugs. Draco checks it out for her, but he seems distracted and they don't exchange many words.
“Promise,” Draco and Harry say at the same time. This pleases him and he smiles through his tears.
Draco waited another couple seconds, and began shifting papers awkwardly. Pretty soon the blurriness wouldn't go away and he felt his eyelids lowering slowly. He cleared his throat again, silently panicking.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m definitely feeling much better than usual,” he responds, and feels the itch to paint, something he hasn’t done in a while. He nods decisively, and gets up to his little painting station. Theo follows him, eyebrows raised.
“Even I know you’re not so cruel as to fake… fake this,” Draco says, looking up at Harry for a moment. Harry looks equal amounts relieved and scared out of his mind.
“Daddy! The teapot is screaming!” Scorp shouts, and Harry starts. The teapot is in fact whistling, and Harry quickly goes to retrieve it, “You act weird when papa isn’t here. When is he coming back? I miss him, and I want to tell him about Marvins science project exploding!”
“Well… It’s kind of a long story… and you may not believe it,” Ron starts, and Draco calms himself down of the burst of anxiety that the sentence produces. He takes another sip of the tea and hates how it actually manages to calm him. He forces himself to relax and closes his eyes after the sip, smelling the tea to focus on the sense. When he opens his eyes Harry is watching him as if he’s about to keel over at any moment, Hermione seems to be wiping tears out of her eyes and Ron stands awkwardly with his hands in his pockets, fake casual.
observes his surroundings. He’s clearly in someone's house, their living room to be exact, and there are pictures hanging on the walls that Dracos still sleep-blurry eyes can't make out. They’re sitting on a couch, and the coffee table in front of them has a few things on it, nothing of interest. He finally makes out Rons startled face and… ah shit, auror robes.
be married,” Draco says, and he places his now empty teacup onto the table in front of him harshly as if to prove his point somehow. He glances up at Harry who looks a little hurt. Whatever, it’s not his responsibility to feed into his deranged delusions.
“So, well, this may sound insane to you but- erm… the two of us, you and me, we’re…. Sort of married?” Harry finally makes himself say, and Draco takes a moment to process what he’s said. He laughs, and the laugh sounds a bit crazed. Well, thank god… it's not Draco who has gone insane but rather Harry.
Nothing. Dracos office was empty. No Draco in sight. Harry's eyes were immediately drawn to the fact that there was unfinished tea on either sides of the table, and an empty notepad was opened in front of Dracos chair. The page was slightly crumpled. Harry felt his heart jump into his throat.
They finally tell Draco the truth, and he denies it until he can't anymore.
"Married! A tragic tale, who is this man! One word and I'll beat him up," Rosie says, pretending to roll up nonexistent sleeves.
Draco takes a moment to breath, dropping his head into his hands. He wipes away stray tears and then forces himself to look up with a final deep breath. Harry is still in front of him, and Draco feels impossibly guilty that he has to ask.
gain from lying about something as silly as that. The two of us could
Harry sees something and comes up with a theory, which means he has to reveal to Ron that he’s been seeing Draco
They haven't told Scorpius, the five year old simply thinks that his papa has gone on a very important working trip, and he writes letters daily that Harry keeps in a box under his bed.
"Are you alright?" Someone behind him asks, with a vaguely familiar voice that Draco can't place. They must've come here before. He turns to see that it's the redhead.
Mrs. Jones sends a smirk to Draco, as if to say "ha! I've won!" But Draco couldn't care less.
“No... I mean,” it’s weird for him to just go up to talk to a worker for no reason right? “Er... yes, what’s your recommendation?” He asks, already knowing Draco’s carefully crafted top ten books, none of which will be offered at this muggle bookstore.
"Past lover?" He asks, hoping to get her talking more. He wants to know what this Draco is like and Rosie seems to be his best option at the moment. She kind of reminds him of a muggle Pansy, or maybe Pansy if she had been sorted into hufflepuff rather than slytherin. Pansy would kill him if he knew what he was thinking.
“When,” Harry mutters, and at Ron's confused look he continues, “
Draco raises his eyebrow and then glances at Harry up and down, which makes Harry giddy for reasons he can’t explain. He knows Draco isn’t checking him out, and either way the body he’s borrowing is just that, borrowed.
The bell signalling someone has opened the door rings, and all three of them turn to look.
"What's..." Harry takes a breath, "what's he like?"
Harry dropped Scorpius off at Mollys house early the next day, along with Ron and Hermione dropping Rose and Hugo off. Scorp had been ecstatic to find out he was staying with Molly for the night, and almost screamed when he found out Rose and Hugo were going too. He didn't even bother asking why. Harry, Ron and Hermione met back up at Harry's house.
“Oh, Draco,” Harry whispers, pulling him in for a hug. Draco doesn’t resist, all the emotions he’s been feeling since he woke up in Harry’s-
“I’m not even going to comment. Where’d you get this salad? It’s really good,” Harry changes the subject fast. He isn’t sure why Theo sometimes makes jokes like that, it seems unfitting to their friendship.
Theodore Nott was holding two coffees, and in one hand he also had a bag, presumably with baked goods inside of it. His eyes flittered between Harry and Draco, his mouth twisted in a scowl.
“I’ll repeat myself, what have you
wow I hadn’t realized how long I had actually gone without updating. Um, my bad. I have a bit of a habit of starting projects and then leaving them unfinished for months at a time, and really the only reason I managed to finish this chapter is because someone commented something about me leaving it on a cruel cliffhanger and it made me giggle.
?” he says, managing to sound like he has the upper hand here when clearly they’re conspiring against him. Hermione actually covers her mouth with her hands and tears up again, while Harry lets out a long breath and falls into an armchair. Dracos inclined to agree.
The young girl answered the fire-call with a smile and a twinkle in her eye. Oh yeah, Draco had specifically hired her instead of another person because she was a huge Harry Potter fan, and it had amused him at the time.
“So… he’s our son.
,” he hears Ron groan, and he pauses just as he’s about to insult Harry again. Flirting? As if, Harry is being an idiot and twisting his words. He wonders what has happened to the three of them that they all think this is perfectly normal. This strange idea that he and Harry are married that they all have does explain why Hermione hugged him upon meeting, but now he has to find a way out of this situation before it gets impossible. He entertains the thought that maybe Harry is under some love potion, but he hasn’t tried to… kiss Draco or anything, isn't waxing poetic, he’s just stating that the two of them are impossibly married. Plus, that doesn’t explain why Ron and Hermione are in on it. Come to think of it, Neville said something about Harry missing him didn’t he? Something sinister is going on here, Draco is sure of it.
It makes no sense, Harry sighs and rubs his forehead. He really wants to visit Draco again, but he usually does it while Scorp is at school and he can’t very well leave him home alone.
Draco rolls his eyes, "and people say
"I'm sorry Mrs. Jones, but you never returned the book, now usually after so much time there is a fee you'd have to pay but I'll tell you what, since you're such a prized customer we'll give you a discount if you've returned it within the week. Say, five dollars off?" Rosie said, and if Draco didn't know any better he'd think she actually believed Jones was a prized customer. But Draco could see the tension in her shoulders and her eyebrow twitching.
Harry watches her leaving and then turns back towards Draco... it probably wouldn’t hurt to talk to him right? Especially if Rosie believes he's simply a stranger with a crush, it would probably be strange if he simply stared at him and never spoke to him. His palms are sweaty as he approaches Draco, hoping his face doesn't reflect how nervous he suddenly feels. It's like when him and Draco first started dating all over again.
want to see Draco pretending to grab something from the back room in order to hide from Spencer making a fool of himself again. Harry has half a mind to say something, but he knows he shouldn’t cause drama, especially since Draco will be out of here soon.
Draco stepped away, moving towards the door, "sorry Harry but I really must be getting to work. I only came by to tell you mum wants to have Scorp for the weekend. Have fun with your knick knacks and your secret friendships and your cinnamon buns," before Harry could even question him on that he was out the door and apparating away.
He walks in and sees Draco and Rosie at the register again, but this time there is another worker. A short man with greying hair and a strange posture. His name tag says Frank. There aren't a lot of customers, just the occasional person browsing. The one oddity is the tall man waiting in line, wearing a long black jacket and holding a couple coffee cups instead of books. Harry swears he looks familiar.
Ron rubs his hands down his face, “This was too dire a situation to waste time with porteys, so we apparated but the
"Hm" Draco made a noncommittal noise, barely suppressing the urge to glare at Theo. Theo was doing a similarly poor job.
Things are really looking up for them, he thinks. Draco will be together with them again in no time.
Once they were home, Harry checked the rooms first, thinking maybe Draco had arrived while they were gone, and was just in a terrible mood. When that failed, Harry and Scorpius wrote a letter together, ("dear papa, you forgot to get me today. It's okay. Don't forget next time, and I love you lots and lots," "Maybe I should write it?") and sent it off. A couple minutes later the owl came back, the unread letter still attached to it. Now Harry was starting to worry. He decided to fire-call Dracos assistant.
(See the end of the chapter for
He looks at Draco again, seemingly sleeping peacefully. Thank Merlin for that at least. He sits down in front of Draco, gently pushing a stray strand of hair off his forehead. He really is beautiful, and Harry had missed him so much. He had managed to see him quite a few times after they found him, but seeing him back in their house, the home they chose and share, overwhelms Harry and he drops his head onto Dracos slowly rising and falling chest, refusing to let the tears fall. He has no reason to cry anymore, Draco is safe with him and he’ll never let this happen again.
Rosie gives her a once over, "wow I never would've guessed! Sad to say, Draco doesn't dye his hair. I'm not sure he even knows what hair dye is! Does your red head friend know any place? I'm assuming that red isn't natural," Rosie continues, glancing back at Ron and Harry.
Harry shakes his head, “No, you said it would be easier to list reasons we would be married. Tell me one then,” he seems entirely to smug for his own good.
"Spencer, if you keep disturbing Draco I'm going to have to kindly ask you to leave," Rosie gestures towards the door and Spencer rolls his eyes.
"Yes it's papas turn, I have no idea why he didn't tell me if he couldn't make it. Let's go home and owl him, yeah?" Harry said, and Scorpius grinned impossibly wider. They apparated away to his chant of "owl, owl, owl!"
“Well get on with it,” Draco demands, deciding that he deserves a vacation after this.
“We need to find out the effects of the potion he’s been drinking for months now, they’re clearly hurting him,” Hermione says, also sounding like she’s seconds from sobbing. Draco hates how they’re all
aha!!! this scene is literally the reason I started writing this!
Harry does notice that the more time goes by, Draco gets more easily annoyed as his headaches act up. Then almost exactly one month later, the same man Harry had seen brings the workers coffee again. Rosie again doesn’t drink hers, but Draco does and it’s like his headache is cured. Harry notes it for later, but his immediate theory is that the man may be the one putting him here and the coffee is laced with something that erases his real memories. It’s a huge conclusion to jump to, but Harry can’t see how Draco could suddenly recover because of the man twice.
After their first visit, Ron tells Harry that he can't be too involved with the case, since he's too close and may become irrational. Harry doesn't listen until Hermione, glossy eyed, tells him that he might ruin the whole process if he does anything impulsive.
"Draco, the new client is here, shall I send him in immediately?" His assistant asked, and Draco cleared his throat and said yes.
If Hermione doesn't know what's wrong, who will?
“So what’s the story with this then?” Theo asks, presenting Harry with a clay pottery cat, painted black and it’s face completely flat apart from the cats face that is clearly drawn on with a toothpick while the clay was still soft. Harry chuckles.
"Hello, sorry to disturb. Is Draco in?" Harry asked, plastering on a terrible smile that didn't reach his eyes. Dracos assistant, Harry really should remember her name one of these days, bit her lip.
Draco is certain of one thing, if nothing else, he hates when the customers act like they know more than he does. Especially Dorothy Jones, a regular at the library who comes in at least once a week making her demands, requesting Draco be fired, and generally causing a fuss. Draco thinks she must live a boring life if she can't stop herself from visiting and ruining everyone's day. All that lady does is make a fool of herself.
"End of the month?" She asks, attempting a casual tone.
He hears the ring of the bell soon after and hopes that it's Neville leaving and not simply a new customer entering. When he doesn't hear Rosie greet anyone he lets out a breath. Then the door jingles again and Draco peeks around the corner to see Spencer McDonald sauntering in with a grin on his face.
Draco is annoyed, because the three of them keep avoiding the topic. Harry runs back into the kitchen and grabs another set of teacups for Hermione and Ron, and then Ron takes a moment to remove his outer auror robes. Hermione also decides that she needs to change where she’s sitting a few times. Ron and Harry keep starting sentences then stopping, allowing the other to speak first. Overall it's incredibly annoying and Draco already had thin patience to begin with.
," She whispers, and Draco glares at her before storming off to finish the re-shelving he had been doing before Spencer had arrived and ruined his day. He passes the customers and hears one of them take a deep breath. What the hell?
It’s a few hours and cups of tea later that Draco finally stirs, groaning loudly and rubbing at his temple, “christ I’m never drinking again,” he mumbles and sits up, blinking away the sleep. He then seems to realize where he is and gasps, “where the fuck am I?” he says in a panic, looking around. It’s then he sees the two figures staring at him in shock, and flinches away.
Draco gasps loudly as the child runs up to him and throws himself onto him, “Papa you’ve been gone forever I was scared that you didn’t love us anymore! Grandma said I couldn’t come because you needed rest but I couldn’t wait to see you! I saw Auntie Hermione use the flow and when Grandma was looking away I came here so I could see you, I love you!”
Scorp sees the paint on his fingers and grins, “you painted! Is it me? Paint me! And papa! With a dragon!” he shouts, climbing onto Harry’s back. Harry laughs and tells him about the painting.
Draco?" Harry shakes his head, "I'm just... curious about him I suppose," it's not entirely a lie, he is curious about this Draco who seems to believe that Harry is married to Ginny. He wonders if Draco thinks he has any kids, he wonders if this Draco... is interested in anyone. If Draco, with false memories, falls in love with someone else, would he want to be with Harry again after he gets his memories back? Possibly he would stay because of Scorpius, but even then maybe he would simply take Scorp. Harry hates the thought. He hates the bought of Draco never remembering even more.
“Theo, do you know much about potions?” Harry asks, not willing to share too much details, which he himself shouldn’t even have access to. They had never been great at following the rules anyways.
“Are you- are you sure?” Harry asks, deciding denial is as good a place as any to live. Theres no fucking way a stunned, unconscious wizard managed to escape a group of trained aurors. Harry won't believe it.
“Ou- erm, my house,” Harry mumbles, and Draco’s eyebrows shoot up, and he takes a second look around. He’s startled by the revelation but in retrospect it makes sense. He knew it was obviously a family home, and he doubts the Weasley could be this clean. He internally waves away the strange sense of guilt he suddenly feels, because he has no reason to be guilty.
"I swear Draco, what about you makes you irresistible to men? That red head is staring practically into your
him. He’s not a child, and he’s not about to die.
"Welcome! Take your time!" Rosie says cheerily,  unaware of Dracos near breakdown. Mrs. Jones storms off but Draco can't take his eyes off of their new customer, who is similarly doing a fish impression right at the entrance.
After picking Scorp up from school and making dinner, Harry goes up to his room and sits on his bed, staring at the picture of him and Draco in their wedding day, where it sits on their bedside table. Why would someone go out of their way to create a whole new potion just to make Draco forget his life and put him in some random town? Working at a library and thinking that Harry is married to Ginny?
"Hello," he says as he stops to stand next to Draco. Draco turns towards him with a raised eyebrow, clearly hesitant about this interaction. He stops shelving books and turns towards Harry completely.
Harrys heart swoops rather impressively, and he takes a steadying breath, “Soon, Scorp, soon,” he answers, and hopes with all his heart, so much so that it hurts, that hes right.
Rosie huffs and walks over, addressing the little blonde girl first, "hello! Do any of you need any help?" She asks, using her most professional sweet voice.
This also means I'm not done writing it so updates may be a while. I have the next few chapters but that's it, hopefully you enjoy enough to wait for updates :D!!
"Oh! Hey Theo," Harry said, moving to lean against the workbench Draco was still sitting on.
Where on earth could Draco have gone? Without telling anyone? Was he kidnapped, or worse, murdered? Harry's head was spinning. Draco could be anywhere, with anyone.
Also, I’m like 18, I started writing this when I was 17, so sorry if some of the adult stuff doesn’t make sense, according to that commenter a bookstore and a library are two different things and I keep calling the place Draco works both. Well I’m sticking with library for now, because I’ve mentioned checking books out a lot. Let’s just say it’s a library where you can also buy the books (is that not a thing? I always thought it was)
She leads the girl towards the other side of the library, and when they're almost there she speaks up again, giving Rosie a nice smile.
Harry glances at the other man, wearing the exact same outfit he had been wearing every other time Harry had seen him. His face is unfamiliar, not striking any memory Harry has of the people from hogwarts, or even anyone he should know.
“Oh Merlin, they’re
I wrote this forever ago and I have been trying to write it on and off since then, but I keep losing motivation. I figured if I posted the first chapter and got feedback I'd find motivation to finish it. So if you liked this chapter, comment!
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco nods and seems to think it over, “if you’ll follow me I think I have a selection you might like,” he says and begins walking away. Harry follows closely behind, and they pass Rosie who’s checking a book out for someone. She wiggles her eyebrows at him and Harry feels even more certain that her and Pansy should never meet.
After the second attempt went unanswered, Harry began to panic. He tried not to let it get to him, Draco ignored him all the time. Especially when he was with a client, so it wasn't anything new, it was just worrying on top of everything else, "Draco? It's Harry, I need to talk to you," Harry expected that to finally work, but yet again there was no answer.
“Why not?” Harry asks, and Ron sighs loudly. Of course instead of explaining to Draco everything that happened he picks an argument.
Harry watches as the man gets in front of the line, smiling and waving and handing out coffee to Rosie and Draco. Draco rubs his forehead, smiles gratefully, and takes a long sip of the coffee. The man has clearly been there before, maybe he brings coffee to the workers often. Rosie doesn't drink hers.
“True, we’ll forgive you this time. What did you find?” Hermione asks, taking a seat next to Ron.
Dracos heart drops
Rosie smiles softly and turns to look at him dealing with another costumer. He seems to be in a better mood than the last time Harry came, possibly because the month ended. He desperately wants to know more about the headaches, if they have anything to do with the memory loss. He hopes it's nothing serious, and maybe it’s an indication that whatever has messed with his memories is temporary. He doesn’t like the implication that it’ll hurt to get his memories back.
He pulls the child away from their hug, but he doesn’t let go, again holding this child's head in his hands, wiping away his tears with his thumbs. The boy has the same haircut that he had when he was about that age, Draco can’t help but notice. He stares in astonishment, “It’s pronounced floo,” is all he manages to say, remembering that he said he came from the flow.
“So, pretty much anyone smart?” Harry says, and Ron sucks a breath in through his teeth.
Harry hums for a second, leading them back over to his painting station. He glances at his still unfinished painting and sighs, not feeling up for continuing it anymore. He puts his supplies away slowly, giving himself more time to answer. Theo leans against his usual wall, watching Harry calmly.
Seriously these notes at the end of the work instead of the end of chapter one are my enemy.
“Right well, I’m just surprised you’ve actually told me,” he comments, rolling his eyes, “guess I should’ve known.”
Harry is happy to see Draco, and decides to wait to talk to him when he’s done working on whatever he’s working on. Harry is idling behind one of the bookshelves when the door jingles and Harry glances between the shelf to see the coffee guy enter, and Harry ducks behind the bookshelf so that he’s not seen.
“Promise?” the boy asks, his eyes huge and glassy.
“You could say that,” Harry mutters, and finds himself painting Draco. A Draco surrounded by books, smiling as he reads aloud. Theo watches the painting come to life with a frown, which Harry doesn’t comment on. He had figured that maybe the two never really got along, maybe something happened in their past that neither really got over. Theo leaves soon after, and Harry paints for the rest of the day, until he has to pick up Scorpius.
When he gets there, the library is completely deserted aside from Draco, who seems to be looking stuff up on the computer. He glances up at Harry, who glamoured himself as the same red head as always. Draco nods to him as a hello and continues what he’s doing.
"Hermione knows more about memory than I do. Maybe she can find out how he's forgotten, charm, spell, potion, etc. But we can't just storm in there asking questions, first of all, we can't go there at all looking like ourselves. He'll be suspicious, he's already shocked to see Neville, and we have no clue if the person who did this to him ever goes there, if they see us there they might panic and do something to Draco. We need to be careful, I'll ask Hermione to come with me to see him tomorrow," Ron says, his tone not leaving room for argument.
Harry doesn’t seem hurt by his words this time, in fact Draco notices him smiling as if this is the best thing he’s ever been told, “list one,” he says, and Draco frowns.
Draco again.
Clearly, Harry sees right through him somehow, and he reaches towards him for a second before changing his mind and standing up, speaking calmly, “I’ll go fetch you some tea,” he mumbles, and Draco mutely nods, confused beyond all belief as to why Harry seems so concerned, and how he had managed to see through him so easily. He looks towards the far wall and calms himself down by rationalising it as Harry simply making an excuse to distance himself from Draco, and he probably has some sort of privacy charm on the photos so that Draco can’t see his personal life. Draco also ignores the pang of upset that the thought conjures.
"Mr. Potter! Scorpius is right over there," she said, pointlessly. There was literally only one other child. Scorp noticed his dad and grinned. He ran up to Harry and gave him a hug.
Draco sighed again, "As thrilling as the thought is, some people can't just chose not to work whenever they feel like it. I've got to be in the office soon, I've a new client coming in an hour and I want to make a good impression for him,"
"Spence! When will you give up! He's not interested in dating you," Rosie said, a little too loudly for Dracos comfort. He glanced at the other customers, but they didn't seem to have heard.
Neville looks confused, maybe even hurt, before some sort of realization dawns on him.
him. He scoots away from him and then
Harry is silently boiling with rage, but he doesn't let it show on his borrowed features, "guys like that are the worst," he mutters, but it's not entirely true. Draco had once been like that, a spoiled brat who got what he wanted or made everyone suffer for it. Harry hopes he isn't being hypocritical when all he does is think fondly of those days and already hates Spencer for it.
Draco takes a second to breathe, but before he can try to rationalize anything that's happening the floo lights up and a small boy comes barrelling out. The boy is blonde, and he has tears running down his cheeks. He looks desperately around the room, spotting Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron looks at Harry, sees the desperation, the determination but mostly the pure longing to see his husband again. Ron is nodding before his brain even catches up, "fine. You can come, but you have to be careful okay?"
. More importantly, I hate you.”
, I can't stay long, have an appointment to get to," Theo said, putting his hand on Harry's shoulder as he passed by. Draco definitely glared at that. Harry didn't seem to notice, he simply waved goodbye to his "friend" and put the bag and coffee down on his table.
doesn't like him.
“I don’t think papa loves me anymore!” He cries, “he’s been gone almost forever and he won’t give me a letter back when I write him!”
“You look like shit, don’t you sleep?” He says, startling everyone including himself. That sounded alarmingly close to genuine concern. Harry looks up at him and tentatively smiles, which shocks the glare right off of Draco's face, who prays he hasn’t gone pink. Right, so the world has been flipped upside down if Harry Potter of all people is smiling at him.
"For the last time Mrs. Jones, you never returned that book, it would've been entered into the system," Draco explains for what must be the tenth time today. Jones looks like she might burst, her face has gone an impressive sort of red.
Wasn’t going to upload again so soon but the last chapter is really bad but this one is much better and it’s longer so I wanted to upload it as fast as possible.
“Scorpius, his name is Scorpius. We usually call him Scorp… It was your idea, his name,” Harry responds, using the same gentle tone he used earlier. Draco nods.
Theo opened his mouth to respond but Harry beat him to it, "Theo comes by almost every morning to feed me coffee and breakfast. We saw each other at that event a while ago and got to talking, remember? I'm not going to die over some cinnamon buns," Harry said, mock offended.
"Charming, Harry, but my office is a mess and I need to clean it up. This client says he needs help with some kind of potions research, and those are really my favourite jobs," Draco grinned down at Harry, who rolled his eyes.
“Dr- Malfoy, just answer the question. Please,” so the Boy who Lived can speak! Draco flinches at the clear slip up, and remembers Longbottoms stange need to be on a first name basis as well. Strange and annoying. He turns his glare towards Harry, and is shocked to see how absolutely wrecked he looks.
Half an hour later the urge hasn’t gone away and in fact has gotten worse. He contemplates for all of two seconds before he decides that he might as well, if only to ease his conscious. He quickly fire-calls Molly to see if she’s willing to take Scorp for the evening, and she’s absolutely thrilled. Apparently she’d just finished making him a pair of socks and couldn’t wait a second longer to give them to him. Harry smiles fondly, and then floos to the portkey office. He briefly thinks maybe the workers are simply bored, with how willing they always are to set up last second portkeys for him to the same place.
“Smart and experienced, you don’t make a potion like that off the fly,” Ron amends, and claps Harry on the back. Harry takes a step forward, grunting at the force, “just wanted to update you. We’re getting closer to solving this thing. I’ll see you later, yeah?”
At Draco's reaction, Harry changes course. He picks one of the photos off the wall and with an extended arm so as not to scare Draco again, shows him the photo.
Spencer simply shrugged and leaned against the counter, grinning from ear to ear at Draco, "you've captured my heart," he states and Draco has to force himself not to grimace. Rosie sighs.
(See the end of the chapter for
He squints his eyes open and is minutely relieved to see green eyes looking at him in concern, and then remembers himself and scowls, flicking his arm so Harry will stop
"How does he have false memories?" Ron asks, and Hermione stays silent. For once, she has no answer for them.
"Perfectly fine," he says, hoping that the guy doesn't feel the need to prolong the conversation. If he gets straddled with another Spencer he might actually quit this job. He'd be slightly sad to leave Rosie, but he imagines it wouldn't be hard to write her the occasional letter. He could find some other place, another nice and calm library to work at.
“What’s this I heard about a certain Harry visiting a certain Draco?” She says, and Harry’s relieved she doesn’t seem seriously angry.
"Sorry," they both say, shuffling along.
He’s breathing just fine, and Harry slumps in relief. He sends a patronus to Ron, lacking anything else to do. He has to get the two unconscious people out of the library before anyone enters, and his portkey lasts another half hour at least. He wipes some of Dracos hair out of his forehead and checks for any signs of discomfort, but he seems to be sleeping peacefully.
job. It makes something in Harry flutter, but it also makes him feel vaguely like he has to run and get out of there before he does anything stupid.
"Just owl me if he comes back, okay?" Harry said, before he left. He checked on Scorpius, who was drawing pictures at the kitchen table.
Also this chapter is shorter than the first my apologies!
“His name is supposedly Albert, it’s a decorative piece that’s said to attract cats, although I’m not sure if that’s true. He looks a little wonky wouldn’t you say,” Harry responds, gently taking the piece from Theos hand. Their hands brush together and Harry internally cringes. Theo smiles down at him, and Harry turns away so he doesn’t have to deal with that.
"No, Rosie, I don't have a boyfriend. I can't even remember the last time I've seen Potter, and I certainly have never dated him," Draco says, hoping against all odds that his face hasn't turned red. He feels his ears burning.
Harry walks further into the library, hoping he doesn't look awkward or suspicious. Frank asks if he wants any help, and Harry shakes his head without looking away from Draco, who's reaching high above his head to put a book on the shelf.
Ron and a few other aurors arrive soon after, and the others take the guy and apparate away. Ron walks over to Harry and Draco, checking him over just as Harry had. He sighs deeply and rubs his forehead.
dramatic. He's got a little ginger wife that he's been dating since school, and he's
“So, other than the coffee have you gotten anything from Draco? Unless, you’ve just been flirting with him this whole time despite him not knowing who you are?” Ron asks, eyebrows raised. Harry turns red and looks away from his ginger friend. He’s saved from a response as Hermione floos over, children in tow.
"If I recall correctly, you said you needed a little help with figuring out how to make a potion, and I think with some more details I can figure something out with you," Draco glanced around, mentally cursing himself. All his preparations and he couldn't have been bothered to remember to grab a notepad? He quickly ducked down and opened his cabinet, rummaging around for his notepad. He found it rather quickly, and sat up. Terrence now had his teacup in his hands, sipping it calmly. He never took his eyes off of Draco.
Draco just hopes they leave him alone. He's not in a good mood today, he's been getting headaches like crazy recently and it's pissing him off. Just as he thinks that a strike of pain goes through his head and he hisses, almost stumbling from the sudden burst of pain. He balances himself on a nearby shelf and puts his hand on his forehead.
“Why not?” Draco asks incredulously, “It would take less time to list the reasons we would! There are so many reasons we could never date, reason number one being you’re the bloody saviour of the wizarding world and I-” Draco glares at him, “I was decidedly
"That's good, he's not dead, trapped somewhere or run away from us. We can't make drastic moves, if he has forgotten we still don't know why, how, or who would do that to him," Ron says, before Harry can do something crazy like apparate straight there.
“I can’t- it’s just a blurry mess. There’s… It’s you, and-and your family I’m assuming,” Draco mumbles, backing up and pulling himself from Harry's grip. Harry lets it happen, leaning back to watch Draco.
Draco fears what she might shout this time, and wonders whether she would calmly leave or start screaming again. Apparently Draco didn't have to worry, as his coworker comes to the rescue. Rosalinda Mathusla, or as everyone called her, Rosie, gives Jones her sweetest fake smile. Rosie just has a way with the customers that Draco could never understand.
"Daddy, the food got done cooking. We should eat and wait for papa to get back from work," Scorpius said, putting his hands on either side of Harry's face, squishing his cheeks together.
He quickly left Dracos office and checked the nearby bathroom for him. No luck. He told Dracos assistant that he was gone. She looked panicked.
Harry finally listens, nodding his head and rubbing his tires eyes, sitting at Hermione and Ron's kitchen table.
“Not much, but I passed the class. Why?” Theo asks, looking disinterested. Harry shrugs.
"No- I mean, I am new, but I'm not going to...
"Draco!" Neville seemingly recovers, but Draco flinches at the sound of his own name. Why in the world is he using "Draco" instead of "Malfoy"? As far as Draco could remember, they were never on a first name basis, "what are you doing here! Harry's worried sick, everyone's been looking for you!" Neville says as he rushed over.
“I love you,” he whispers, and then lifts his head and repeats it, kissing Draco’s forehead. With one final calming breath he stands back up, just in time too as Ron floos into the room. He looks pale and angry.
"Sorry. I'm fine, really. Continue looking around," Draco says before shrugging the hand off. He quickly walks back to the counter, deciding that the re-shelving can be done when his head isn't pounding.
son?” Harry nods again, and Draco shakes his head lightly, “how could we have ever gotten together? How could you have forgiven me?” he asks quietly, remembering the other people in the room.
"Draco doesn't really talk to me about his past a lot, but the way he acts when people flirt with him is a dead giveaway," Rosie says, and honestly if Draco had told her his past then she probably would've blurted it all to the first person to ask. It's a good thing Rosie isn't magic, she would've blown their cover a long time ago.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was at home, about to start cooking supper for his family when an owl arrived. He didn't recognize it, and quickly grabbed a treat for it. He handed the owl the treat, patted its head and untied the letter from its foot. Weird, the letter was from Scorpius' school. Today was Dracos day to pick Scorp up, and Harry was a little curious as to why it was taking so long. He unfolded the letter.
"Goodbye, Malfoy," Terrence finally spoke, and his voice was alarmingly familiar. Draco tried to stand up, tried to do anything really, but he felt weak. Soon his head hit the table and he fell unconscious. The last things on his mind were Harry and Scorpius.
"If only! Hair like
“But we have Draco, there's no way he can get through our wards, plus we’re adding a few extra here just in case…. If Draco gets his memory back before we figure out who it is, he can help us by telling us exactly what happened, so we have leads. Everything will be fine, alright?” Ron says, giving Harry a reassuring look. Harry briefly wonders when Ron became so mature and when he himself became a panicked disaster. Probably when his husband was kidnapped, he answers himself internally, and hates himself for it.
Harry spends the whole time thinking of seeing Draco again, even if he’ll be polyjuice potioned and can’t interact with him as himself. He wonders what Dracos doing at a library, how he acts, how close he is with “Rosie”, but most of all he worries about Dracos lost memories. Will they ever return? Why would someone take away the memories of his life? Would Draco even want to remember-
Despite himself, Harry laughed. He hugged Scorpius tight, picked him up, and walked over to the kitchen.
“Go find Scorpius!” She says cheerfully, quickly looking around to spot the two men at the kitchen table. She raises her own eyebrows at Harry as she walks over, arms on her hips. Harry feels like he’s being scolded by a mother, not uncommon when it comes to Hermione.
Once he gets to the library, glamoured as the same red head as he didn't have access to polyjuice potion anymore, he takes a deep breath. Just a couple minutes.
Hermione pauses, "oh he's kind of useless, he doesn't know where he got the dye. Im sure him and Draco would be birds of a feather, if you say Draco doesn't even know what hair dye is," she chuckles, hoping the comment isn't weird or suspicious. She just wants to keep the topic on Draco, find out as much as she can.
“A very mean dragon,” Harry agrees, and Scorp nods. He grabs some paper and begins writing his daily letter, more determined than ever. Harry smiles as he watches him work. He suddenly remembers the now extremely cold coffee he had taken from Rosie, and decides to quickly get it to Ron, if it’ll get Draco back any sooner. He gets up to fire-call him, leaving Scorp to his work.
“He’s a nice man, deep deep
"I love your hair! Is it natural?" She asks, and Rosie grins.
Can you tell I love dramatic endings.
"Sorry!" He mumbled before quickly walking behind the counter to hide- no stand, next to Rosie. Rosie smiled at Spencer and lifted an eyebrow.
When Harry gets home with Scorpius, they both go into the kitchen, Harry to start dinner, and Scorp to write his daily letter. It had taken a week or two for Harry to resume cooking, the two of them had relied on ordered food or whatever the family brought over. They had been visiting a lot more recently, especially Ron, Hermione, and their kids Rose and Hugo. Scorpius had been curious at first but he likes spending time with his friends so he didn't much care for the reason.
“I’ll bring this coffee in.
They drank their polyjuice potion, and waited for them to take affect. Ron went with a tall man with brown hair, Hermione changed into a short blonde girl, and Harry turned into man with curly hair, dyed red. The three of them had gotten pretty accustomed to drinking polyjuice, for a long time and still occasionally they went out polyjuiced to avoid the media and fans that would swarm them. Harry thought that the fame would've faded away by now, but then again he was famous for the first 11 years of his life without even knowing it.
Draco takes a sip if only so he doesn’t say something stupid and land himself a free ride to St. Mungos. He’s shocked to find the tea exactly to his liking, and the ache burns a little hotter.
The man leaves soon after, almost bumping right into Harry as he leaves. Harry watches as Draco turns around and Rosie chucks her coffee into the garbage. He makes eye contact with Draco and suddenly he can't breath. Draco stares at him for a second, eyebrows raised, before he quickly turns around to go help a customer.
Draco sigh and read over the file in front of him again, the form his client had filled out. He had already read it several times, but it never hurt to be prepared. His client would be coming in soon, and Draco always got new client jitters. He loved his job, helping people in any way he could. Most clients simply needed financial help, which he found easiest, but his favourite were the customers who needed help with potions, especially if they wanted him to brew it for them. His clients came in for all sorts of reasons, and sometimes all he could do for them was to point them towards someone else more qualified. His favourite client was the little girl who had come in one day, crying her eyes out and demanding he find her pet frog for her. She hadn't truly been a client, far too young, but he'd helped her. Supposedly she'd heard of him "helping people do things they couldn't" from her mother, and couldn't find anyone else to help her.
“We can’t just arrest the man for no reason, he seems to come once a month so by the time he comes next we’ll have had someone look at the potion. If it wields nothing we can’t make this guy a suspect, unless something else he does seems suspicious,” Ron declares and Harry rubs his hands on his face, realizing how tired he is.
Harry continues to go to the bookshop a couple times a week, while hoping he doesn’t go while Ron and Hermione are trying to get information. So far he’s been lucky, but he tries not to stay too long. Draco and him have been growing closer, something Harry didn’t expect to have to work for again. Draco seems comfortable around him, and it’s his theory that he’s like that because his subconscious recognizes it as Harry, his husband. He had also introduced himself, quite stupidly, as “Ha-Henry,” and Rosie had taken to fake stuttering every time she said his name.
“I’ve become to accustomed to seeing you in the morning, I almost couldn’t survive the day,” Theo says dramatically, and Harry rolls his eyes.
"He doesn't remember?" Harry whispers, running his fingers through his wild hair and letting out a disbelieving breath.
Ron sighs for a while, “bugger me, you’re sure you don’t want to become an auror?” Ron asks, and then he calls back to Hermione that he’s going to Harry’s and that she should join them once she’s done eating.
"False memories. Headaches, get worse once every month," she mumbles, and Harry feels his heart hurt listening to her. He can't think of anything that would give Draco false memories like that, but Hermione probably does.
“I would need to know your preference in order to recommend something, don’t you think? What’s your favourite genre, let’s start there,” Draco says, and that’s a voice Harry recognizes. His professional and helpful voice, which he uses at his
Hermione hums. The conversation clearly over, Rosie smiles, waves, and walks back towards the register.
“I was just wondering about memory potions I suppose,” he responds, and Theo looks shocked.
Harry stands and walks over to him, clearly intent on trying to comfort him, but Draco recoils from him with a panicked expression, “no! Stop trying to lie to me, that’s impossible!”
“Uhhh...” Harry can’t remember the last time he picked up a book to just read, most of his book knowledge comes from Draco reading aloud and complaining about what ever twist or ending he didn’t like and claiming he could’ve written a better ending with his arms tied behind his back. It’s very endearing, “fantasy?” He guesses, grasping at straws.
Harry took a deep breath to steady himself and walked in.
“I came to get you breakfast but you weren’t here, busy morning?” He asks as Harry digs into his salad.
Harry nods, and Ron exits.
“Whatever it is you think I’ve done, you’re wrong. Let me go,” He says, trying and nearly failing to hold back his anger. He thought they were done with accusing him of crimes every chance they got. Apparently the gryffindor sense of moral superiority never went away. Ron is still staring at him, clearly unsure what to say. Draco doesn’t dare look at Harry, who is still for some unknown reason sitting next to him, albeit he didn’t move any closer when Draco scooted away, so they’re not risking contact anymore.
It takes a bit for Ron to answer, and he does so with spaghetti sauce on the corner of his mouth, “what’s up, mate?” He says, and Harry takes a beat to respond.
"You know him?" Rosie asks, and Draco grimaces.
not gonna lie this got me sobbing a little... Draco having to ask his own sons name is just so heartbreaking to me. Hope you enjoye hehe.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nods, “well I probably wouldn’t have told you if I didn’t have to. You see, I’ve seen a man there twice now. He wears a big black jacket, and he gives the workers coffee once a month. You remember his unexplained headaches? After he drinks the coffee they go away, so it’s my theory that the man is responsible for how Draco is now,” Harry explains, “I’ve gotten some of the coffee meant for Rosie, I assume it has some in it as Rosie said it tastes weird and the man has no way of knowing which Draco will choose beforehand.”
Again, sorry for the absence. If you continue reading anyways thank you so much!!! Also sorry for all the spelling errors in chapter five omg that’s embarrassing.
"Tea?" Draco asked, gesturing towards the teapot and cups he had set up prior. Terrence nodded and Draco waved his hands, charming the teapot to pour two cups, "any sugar?" Draco asked, as his tea came gently floating towards him. At this Terrence shook his head no, and his own tea floated until it stopped in front of him.
“So, the cup did have a potion in it, but it wasn’t any sort of potion that we’re aware of,” Ron starts, voice low. Harry’s shoulders slump and he is about to say something but Ron interrupts him, “but there’s a lot of common ingredients with other memory based potions, and this gives us a lead, it’d have to be someone with knowledge of potions and access to the ingredients.”
I don’t know how to get the notes from at the end of the entire story to just the end of the first chapter lol
Sorry it took so long, I got a little busy! This is the last chapter I had fully written, so updates will take a bit longer. I honestly wanted to rewrite this chapter because I’m not satisfied with it but I knew if I did that it would take forever. I think the next chapter is definitely looking better :>
Harry stands up and places his hand on the child's shoulder as the floo comes to life again, and one Molly Weasley steps through, already apologizing as she appears. She looks over to the couch where Draco is sitting and gasps, her hands coming to cover her mouth in shock, “Oh, he heard someone say Draco’s name and I couldn’t manage to distract him, he must of learned how to use the floo somehow, I-I took my eyes off him for a second, thank Merlin that he hasn’t taken his pronunciation skills from his father, otherwise he might have ended up in the wrong place,” Molly sounds incredibly guilty as she speaks. Draco pays her no mind.
The thought alone makes him think of petty school drama, but he’s nonetheless proud of himself.
“I didn’t think you were... interested in that sort of thing?” He says, glancing over to the door again.
“I always wanted to name my future child Scorpius,” Draco mumbles, and Harry nods. At least that memory hasn’t been taken from him.
I feel like this chapter flows a bit strangely but I’m actually pretty pleased with it :>
The two men shake their heads no, but the blonde girl smiles and says, "yes, actually. Can you show me the non fiction sections?" She asks, and Rosie internally rolls her eyes. There are signs for a reason.
"The surprise is mutual. You often come here and feed my husband unhealthy foods, Nott?" Draco said, sliding off of the workbench and crossing his arms.
The three of them reach the edge of town, and finally Hermione starts mumbling to herself about what happened.
Once he’s through Scorp waves excitedly and the two of them move to the kitchen table, where Harry slides the coffee over to him. Ron opens it and looks in, shrugging, “not my expertise, I’ll have someone check it out,” he says, putting the lid back on.
Hermione nodded, she was already holding a book about memory loss spells and charms, no doubt having read something about memory potions the night previous. Harry was practically vibrating with excitement, and nodded as his stomach preformed flips of nervousness.
Hermione nods, pretending to be interested, "and what about your coworker? You see, my hair is dyed as well and I would love to get such a striking blonde colour!"
Complicated? Draco said it was just a potion thing, and those were pretty easy to him. He said as much to her, and she furrowed her brows.
This time Harry does come over, kneeling in front of Draco and holding his head, not caring about the shattered glass underneath his feet. He gently lifts Draco's head so they’re looking at each other, “What's wrong love? What did you see?” and the concern in his voice as he calls Draco “Love”  has Draco feeling choked up all over again. The headache resides, but the feeling of intense loss he felt at seeing the lion teacup earlier comes back. Something is definitely wrong with him, that much Draco can believe now.
Another strike of pain hits him and he almost falls straight over. A hand steadies him and he realizes that he's been ignoring whatever the redhead was saying.
"If you stop coming
"Anything else? Did Draco seem worried, scared, or... guilty?" He asks, sparing a glance to Harry who furrows his eyebrows. He had been the only one to never entertain the idea that Draco ran away on his own.
(See the end of the chapter for
He sniffs indignantly and turns towards Ron, “If you must know…. I…” his headache comes back full force for a second and he cringes, taking a breath, and it goes away in a second, “-I closed up the library where I am currently employed and went home, decided to have a bit of a drink, and got a bit carried away. Imagine my surprise when I woke up… wherever we are,” He answers, and neither of the other occupants seem to have liked the answer.
The same can't be said of Harry, who is paying annoyingly close attention to him. He easily masks his anxious feeling, he’s gotten pretty good at faking emotions. He’s had a lot of experience.
Draco Malfoy was sitting on Harry Potters workbench, against his better judgment. Harry was standing just in front of him, hands on either sides of Draco's hips. Draco had his arms resting on Harry's shoulders, his legs holding Harry in place. Draco sighed as he pulled away from their kiss.
Everything would be alright. Any minute now Draco would walk through the floo or the door and apologize for disappearing. Maybe he had to get some far off ingredient for a potion that a client needed. Harry could pretend that he didn't know Draco ordered his ingredients, or that he only saw one client that day, according to his assistant. It was easy to pretend while Scorpius launched into a detailed story of his day.
Once Theo was out the door, Draco felt some of the tension leave his body. Harry, ever the clueless, simply turned and kissed him on the cheek and smirked, "now where were we?" He asked, moving a step closer.
“I’ll stay for a while, Rose and Hugo are excited to see Scorp again and we haven’t been here long,” Hermione says, standing up to make herself some tea. Ron nods and floos away, coming back about twenty minutes later, taking the offered tea that Hermione holds up.
He tries to take a second peak at the family photos hanging up on the walls but finds that they are still blurry, despite the sleep blurriness Draco had experienced earlier being completely gone. Rapidly he feels anxiety well up, but luckily Ron seems distracted so he can’t be made fun of.
"He didn't seem upset, rather shocked maybe, but he definitely didn't seem to be in any distress or anything. He didn't even seem to remember anything. He called me Longbottom, didn't understand why I called him Draco, and said that he hadn't seen 'potter' in years and never dated him. It's like he's been obliviated... or something," Neville explained, still unwilling to make statements without any hint of doubt.
He walks over to Harry, sparing a glance towards Draco, and pulls his best friend into a hug, “shite Harry, I’m so sorry but-” he pauses and grabs Harry by the shoulders, ending their sudden hug to make eye contact, “-those bloody new recruits managed to lose the bastard somehow, I should’ve went with them, what was I thinking-” he bemoans, sounding guilty. A pit opens up under Harry that his stomach falls right into, and he has to close his eyes.
"You're sure it was him?" Harry asks, desperate. He has deep eye bags and hasn't even tried to control his wild hair in months. He's not eating as much, and he barely even paints anymore. It's been four months, even the media had lost interest two months ago (he'd never forget Harry's reaction to the first headline the Prophet had put out when news got around that Draco was missing,
"Shit," he mumbles, trying to hide himself behind a bookshelf.
"Is it too late to resign," Draco asks, and Rosie giggles.
“Are you so rude as to think I would fall for something stupid like that? I don’t see what
Harry doesn’t drink the coffee, but he keeps it with him for the whole time he’s there, even when Spencer comes in again to bother Draco. He’s only shown up one other time Harry’s been there, and he had been put off by Harry hanging around with Draco. He didn’t say anything about it but Harry felt smug that Draco didn’t hide from
Draco narrows his eyes, and Rosie squeals, "you've got a boyfriend! Named Harry? Why've you left him? No wonder you've never accepted Spencer's advances!"
Terrence didn't respond, and after a while Draco cleared his throat, "Mr. Cheyenne?" He asked, and blinked away some confusing blurriness. His head began to feel a little heavy, and he shifted in his seat, "I'm going to need a little cooperation if I'm going to help you," he chuckled awkwardly.
“No promises,” Harry responds, chuckling as Ron gives him a look.
Harry, after taking a second to swallow, nods, “had to take care of some business. Sorry, what about you?” Harry asks, glancing at the door as the bell jingles. It’s just a customer looking around, so Harry focuses back on the conversation.
Sorry for missing a day yesterday I was feeling a little sick >.< I hope that this is okay >.<
“Impossible, I will be in whatever house Harry is in.” Draco grumbled hotly his arms folding across his chest stubbornly refusing that they would be separated for even a moment. Harry grinned happily at his friend even if he wasn’t as certain. Remus and Severus had refused to tell him how they were sorted, but he had a feeling they wouldn’t have a choice no matter what Draco said. “At least we won’t have you coming in every morning, what time is it?”
“She was grumpy because I haven’t set her free in the grounds yet.” Harry said before once again strumming his guitar and making sure it was still in tune. Once he was certain it was, he began playing the one song he knew he could sort of play well, at least Chuck said he was doing okay with it, Fare thee well, a song that had started as an American folk song and had been changed and adapted several times since. It was beautiful when Chuck sang it and he wished he had that skill, but he was pretty sure he had improved somewhat as he started to sing.
“Perhaps”
“Those feelings scare you dragon?”
“All children are nervous when they first go Harry, even the ones that are excited, but you will be fine, you will be back with us at Yule.”
“Black told me you were waiting for me. I told Dumbledore that he made me believe I would catch him and James up to no good but in truth he left a letter saying that you wanted to see me. I was halfway under the Dark Lord’s spell that when it happened, I allowed myself to fall further. I am sorry for believing you capable of that”
“Fred, George! Surprise! We’re spending some time with Dad”
“Yes, Lucius, have no fear, Narcissa you can put your wand away now, I will no longer harm Harry Black-Malfoy. But I cannot say the same for my employer. I am sure Dumbledore genuinely believes that he is doing it all for some unseen greater good but he is a damned fool” Severus huffed darkly as Narcissa began to fill his plate with some of the food from the table that hadn’t gone cold even as they were talking. “When I returned to the castle last night he was waiting for me, I gave him no answers as I had none to give but he won’t rest”
“What do we have here George? Little Firsties?” A new unfamiliar voice asked before Draco could answer and Harry  yelped as an unfamiliar arm wrapped itself around his shoulders. The action caused him to dip and pain flooded through him from the magical braces around his body. He twisted out of the grip turning to see two identical red haired boys grinning down at them. Neither one looked in the slightest bit bothered by the fact they had caused him pain, though it was possible that they didn’t know and just thought he was scared by their appearance.  They were wearing black robes with a red and gold tie and the Gryffindor crest on their breasts. Their eyes were a watery blue and freckles decorated pale skin.
“Yes, thank-you” Harry sat and Draco pushed the chair closer to the table and then moved round to opposite side. He gave him a little grin over the top of a floral display. Harry smiled back at the blonde who seemed to look even more like a prince in the high backed chair his body framed by the green silk. “It looks amazing”
“We have both made mistakes, Severus, we have both lost ourselves over the years, but through Harry perhaps we can find ourselves and be like we were meant to be” Remus sucked as much courage as he could into himself and then reached over the small table to cover the potion stained fingers with his own. “Will you allow us to try, Severus?”
“Skegness”
“Stupid, we will be equals, true partners…In all that…I…Potter…In his will he gave reason…He made it seem that there…Its been ten years since. No doubt what passing fancy you had…”
“Then you should write to him, I am positive that Lupin would like to hear from you” Severus said and though he was trying to stay calm Harry had a feeling that he was very tense talking about the man Lupin.
“Nor do I, but we can figure it out, I’m sure…Another biscuit, Severus?”
“Please don’t say Malfoy!” Ron whined and Harry blinked almost afraid he had said the name out loud or something.
“We didn’t do anything, they started it” The twins spoke together but Severus was looking as though Christmas had come early. His hands were on the shoulders of the two boys and Harry could see that he was holding them firmly but gently so as not to hurt them. Remus was hovering at his shoulder his golden eyes watching Harry with concern.
“Yes my dragon?” She hummed clipping the dead leaves from her plant with a pair of silver sheers before turning to look at him with a smile on her face. Her eyes fell to the letter in his hand and her sculpted eyebrow lifted up her pale forehead. “Is Pansy being tedious again?”
The boys from their dorm ignored them throughout breakfast only occasionally looking at them from the corners of their eyes but Harry found that he didn’t care. Chao-Xiang and her friend Alice talked enough for the whole table and Harry found himself enjoying the Asian girl’s bubbly personality. It was different from Draco, Pansy, or even Seamus but it wasn’t overbearing like the twins. She talked about everything and anything rarely needing prompting to continue. Alice was only slightly less talkative and neither of them seemed to care that Draco was a Malfoy.
So…I hated that Cho Chang just seemed to have a stereotypical Asian name as though JK wasn’t sure if she were Chinese or Korean or What. I have many east Asian friends and their names are so beautiful. I couldn’t change it completely, so I changed it slightly. Chao-Xing means Morning Star in Chinese.
“But we still hold feasts and parties. The Malfoy family party is the best and everybody wants an invite” Draco chuckled pulling his attention away from books long enough to contribute to the conversation. “You’re going to love it Harry. Though we do have the boring part first. We have the Samhain ritual in the morning and take food parcels to Mother Marvels Home for Unwanted children”
“Nice to meet you. Yes, I’m really Harry Potter though I was adopted by my parents’ friends Remus Lupin and Severus Snape…” Harry answered clinging to Draco’s hand unnerved by the looks he was getting. There was another gasp and hiss as the older students started to whisper about Severus and his connection to him.
“Yes, Master Lucius!” The elf said before lifting a long finger and beckoning for the auror to follow which she did after giving a clumsy attempt at a smart bow.
“I was aware of that, but aren’t you a little old to be waiting up for Santa, aren’t you?” He teased and Draco shot him a hard stare jabbing him hard in the ribs.
The reason I turned my teachers wig blue was because of my cousin, my aunt and uncle hate me getting better marks than him at school so they would pass off my homework as his while I would have to take in his, which was sometimes none at all because he had never completed it. Sadly we had a test and Dudley failed. My teacher accused me of swopping my paper with Dudley as I had never gotten a high grade before. I was angry with him and he had this stupid wig on...It just...Um...Turned blue...”
“Harry? Are you okay?” Draco asked immediately as he saw them arrive and Harry moved away from Narcissa his cheeks burning red.
i hope this is okay
“I was, I’m sorry. It was my first day of lessons. I will take you out before we go to dinner.” Harry promised and the snaked flicked its tongue for a moment brushing against him before it seemed to nod in agreement its voice muffled by his shirt when it answered sleepily.
“It’s okay…He didn’t do anything…He was worse to you Draco”
Harry was left alone with the sister and brother-in-law of his mother, Vernon and Petunia Dursley who had a set of twins Dudley and Piers who, by some fluke of genetics, were both Omegas. The Dursley’s enjoyed the home of the Potter’s but did not care for having the child himself, more so as the years went on and the young Harry grew more beautiful, and their own children grew uglier Dudley with a round belly and a squished nose and Piers with pointed rat like features and overly large teeth.
The fear of having a wand with the same core as Voldemorts was now gone as Harry basked in the feeling of being complete with his wand. It felt, perfect, all the different parts making up this one wonderful whole. He beamed at his fathers and then the Malfoy’s and Pansy before grinning wide at Draco who flashed him back his own smile saying,
“Of course, a little friendly competition is never a bad thing, it keeps you on your toes. Speaking of toes, you are out here without even your slippers or socks. Your feet must be freezing, come on in and go get dressed. Why are you laughing?” A blonde eyebrow lifted a confused, yet pointed look flashing over the handsome face.
“She thinks that I can’t use magic at the moment because…I’m happy…” Harry sighed knowing his friend wouldn’t rest till he got an answer. “She said my magic has only learnt to come out when I’m upset or scared and since I’m happy now it doesn’t need to. Her friend, the Magi-Zoologist had the same problem…Sort of. He wasn’t able to do magic if he was upset…She thinks that it might also be because I fear being a freak…”
“Narcissa, please, Mister Shacklebolt” She gave the Auror standing next to her the best smile she could muster. The man had been extremely helpful in everything regarding Harry and though she wouldn’t say they were friends, there was a familiarity and a trust between them. At least on her part.
“I will do so on my way out. You did very well today Draco don’t forget to keep practicing between lessons. You will never be the best if you forget to practice”
“Youse is a good boy, Little Master! Like Master Draco!”
“His relatives? What would they do to him that he didn’t deserve? A trouble maker like his father and godfather no doubt”
“Harry…” Draco said slowly, but Harry shrugged him off and hurried towards the entrance to the enclosure leaving Draco and Masaki standing looking bewildered while the Chimera watched with puzzlement. He managed to get out easily and threw himself into Severus’ arms the familiar spicy scent of herbs soothing him while the potion master stroked the top of his head.
“Something, awful, I am not sure how but somehow the will of Lord and Lady Potter has been tampered with. Can you heck to see if there is any spells or compulsions? There is also a spell that Lily created we need to see if it can be trusted” Albus said while Filius  looked around his eyes coming to rest on Harry.
“Hopefully, soon. Okay, I will let you go but it was delightful to meet you Harry!” Pansy said grinning at him and Harry gave a nod. It had been a strange meeting but a good one and Harry gave her a shy smile his own head bobbing up and down. “I will see you to the floo, it is over by the reception desk”
the twins will not be bad but they didnt make the best first impression >.<
“Yes, I have just been told by Mrs Figg, the poor boy...”
“Let’s always be friends”
“Lucius!” Narcissa scolded her tone icy and sharp. Physically she may not have changed but Narcissa was no longer the woman she had been in Draco’s youth. She had more confidence to argue with her husband now and knew when to make her feelings known. There had been a time after the war when it was thought that his parents would split however at the end of the day the pair truly did love each other and they powered through.
“We’re good. How was your summer?”
“You guys are really great friends” Chao-Xing said from her side of the table a huge grin on her face and Harry gave a nod.
“Why are you apologising? You’re not at fault for the stupidity of old men. I will make a promise to you, I will make sure to leave one day free before Yule and we will build snowmen together. Perhaps we could encourage Severus to join us and make a challenge of it” Lucius let out a warm chuckle his breath coming out in a slow cloud before sailing over the garden.
“Harry?” Severus responded dryly his eyebrow lifting at the name. Severus allowed the nickname with minimal fuss and Harry liked being able to say it.
“Anything else?” Narcissa asked her eyes lighting as they both ignored Lucius. “Is the gossip true? Are you courting Harry Potter?”
“Thisen is a sad subjects Master Lupins! Wese be talken abouts somethings nicer!” Jinx squeaked rubbing her eyes on her pillowcase and Harry moved to hug her tightly. She let out a gasp and hugged him in return lightly patting him on the back. “Youse is a good boys master Harry!”
“Hello? Hello? Testing, one, two...JAMES!” Harry jerked in his chair at the sound of the voices coming from the paper in front of him. One sounded young and male while the other was frustrated but fond and female and he knew that these were the voices of his parents. “Sorry, Sorry, Lilis, but I never know if this is working”
“And you are a great elf, I have heard of your efforts to save young master Potter from your masters…”
“Very well, but go easy on him, Harry dear do you have a favourite colour?” Narcissa asked as Draco and Harry stood up quickly. Harry shuffled his feet and then chewed hard on his lower lip. His brows creased together as he hummed;
“It will be an honour sirs! Jinxes will watchen over little Master Harry!” The house elf said beaming with all her might. Jinx was a personal favourite of Severus’ she was brighter than most of her kind, loyal to the Malfoy’s and took pride in her work. Many thought the elves at Hogwarts were the happiest but they had never met the Malfoy elves. “Good days, sirs!”
“Dobby startling you again?” Draco asked sleepily from the bed pushing his blonde locks from his eyes and Harry gave a nod.
“Thank-you Harry, if you will keep it until tonight then” Severus gave him a very weak smile that didn’t quite  reach his eyes and Harry wanted to hug him but he didn’t know if his touch would be welcome. He nodded again and slipped the shrunken letter and package back into his pocket and Severus gave a nod of his own. “Very good, you should go back and finish your breakfast, your first lesson with the much talked about Professor Ninomiya, you must be excited”
“I promise…”
“Yes, well, I wait with bated breath, now if you will excuse us.” Draco let out the tiniest of sighs and then stepped around Ron and carefully pulled Harry with him.
“Then who is it from?”
“You like the game?” A female voice asked suddenly, and Harry blinked pulling himself out of his thoughts to look at the Hummingbird seeker. She was beautiful, slim with yet black hair that was braided into an ornate style on top of her hair. Her eyes were almost gold with flecks of light brown that appeared darker. She was smiling to reveal small white teeth and a large amount of gum.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think he may suspect, which is why he is so insistent that Harry be returned to those animals he calls his family” Lucius growled with more feeling than Severus was expecting him to show. Remus certainly looked surprised. “However there is no chance of us ever getting information out of him”
“They aren’t friends Harry, just people I know, and you don’t have to be sorry, you are my best friend!” Draco assured him honestly. Theo and Blaise had been surprised by everything and it would be all around noble circles by teatime but Draco didn’t give a toss, Harry was his friend and he would always put his friend first.
“Physically, you are better at the theory.” Draco gave him a friendly smile and then the entire class turned their attention to Nino who had cleared her throat holding up a hand to ask for silence.
“Whatsits?” He growled pushing his hair from his eyes and glaring at the girl as he settled down. “Pants, you have your own bed. Why are you always in ours in the morning?”
“She mentioned it, do you think he would be willing to teach me?”
“Who?”
“Harry!” Draco shouted running towards his best friend his worry vanishing as soon as his arms were wrapped around him and he could see that he was fine. He ignored Severus and Remus’ chuckles and his parent’s dramatic sighs. “Are you okay? Did you have fun?”
“Just about half an hour, though I admit I spent my time in the cafe over there. They do the most wonderful salted caramel drink. You should try it."
” Josephine flicked her tongue wildly closer and closer to the lightning shaped scar on his forehead and Harry hissed in pain moving away from the snake head and clutching his head as his body felt as though it were on fire. “
Please and thank you, your servant James Fleamont Potter I of the most noble and ancient house of Potter.
“True, however I am also the man marrying the best of the Marauders in the not too distant future. I fear my future husband may be rubbing off on me”
“Come on, Draco, the war is over, we survived and Tom is dead...Can’t we at least pretend that we are okay with that? Even for a short while”
“Har! Dray!” Pansy squealed happily running towards them as though she hadn’t seen them in a month and throwing her arms around their necks. “How are you both?! How have you been?”
“Not at all”
“Sorry Master Harry, Sirs! Dobby broke free! We hopes he didnts startle youse!” One of them said with a bow and Harry gave a nod not sure what to make of it all as he heard a toilet flushing and saw Draco walking out of the bathroom. His blonde hair was tussled and his eyes seemed half closed as he stretched and yawned.
“Um…Yeah” Harry answered wondering when it would be a good time to tell his adopted parents about his ability to talk to snakes. Draco had made it seem that it was okay but had also told him that Voldemort was the only other person that could and that made him nervous.
It was a good thing they weren’t alone, because Draco had a sudden and furious desire to jump on the man and make love to him. Harry looked and sounded both respectful and fierce. His eyes were almost glowing, giving goosebumps to the blonde man while his smile was... peaceful and happy.
“What...”
"Well, I'm a nice person, Malfoy." Potter's grin widened when Draco rolled his eyes. "But, I'm the baby's father, so it's natural that I came."
“Are you up for the next round, or do you want to sleep?”
“Together? As in a couple?”
"I'm not going through that explanation again. Sorry, but it's way too late for that." He started to turn away, ready to leave. But Potter grabbed his arm.
“It is when your boyfriend is as jealous as me.”
And the man did as he was told, taking his robes off, then his shirt, before doing the same with Draco. They both panted as the former Slytherin pulled his pants down together with his briefs, his already leaking cock breaking free. When Potter started to kneel so he could suck him, Draco shook his head.
“Stay with your friends, enjoy the party. I won’t be long.”
I bring a man home, there will be enough space for the three of us."
"Four, actually."
“Yes. You were perfect. You always are.”
“No, I don’t think so. I fed him less than three hours ago.” He lifted him a bit to smell at his butt. “Oh, I get it. He needs to be changed.”
Harry complied and cleaned them quickly before joining him under the bed sheets. “You know, I’m sure Poppy will take care of him tomorrow if you want to sleep a bit longer.”
"No. I also ate some ham and cheese with pasta, and a slice of the strawberry tart Poppy did yesterday. Oh! And Daphne came with chocolate muffins! So, I ate one. Or two."
“Thank you, Poppy. We are too. I have to rest a bit before going to St Mungo’s with the baby. Can you watch over him for the next two hours?”
Draco slid his hands along the man’s chest, enjoying the tanned soft skin and the sharp muscles under it, the perked-up nipples and his throat, then up to the red lips and the chin and jaw covered by the shadow of a beard. He loved it; it was sexy on him. It didn’t take them long to come, both men screaming the other’s name.
“Sorry Scorpius, I’m not concentrated enough. That’s Harry’s fault, isn’t it. You will learn, baby, that it is always Potter’s fault.”
"So," Potter started. "is breakfast too much, or..."
"So, what’s the party for? Your... Is Weasley’s baby born already?"
"Yes. Astoria's in there too." He smiled a little. After three years of trying, they finally did it. He was happy to actually have a baby. And she was too. Everything seemed perfect.
“I’m sorry, Teddy. But Scorpius is still too young to play. For now, he just sleeps and eats.”
“I know that. But it doesn’t mean I can’t dream, right?”
"Beautiful? Yes, I know. Thank you."
Blaise shook his head and chuckled. “Come on, guys. Stop that, will you? We all know both your boyfriends are hot as fuck.”
you do. If you decide to leave us. May it be tomorrow or in ten years. Can you... can you promise me that you’ll tell me? And that you won’t just disappear from mine and Scorpius’ lives?”
Draco didn’t move. The moment the woman put his son in his arms, his eyes locked on the little chubby face. He seemed so peaceful, so... perfect. Draco’s heart swelled with love and pride. His son was born. He was right here in his arms. Draco was holding him and the world didn’t stop. It would be perfect if Tory was there too. But right now, he couldn’t think about that. He only felt Potter getting closer when the man put his chin on his shoulder to look at the baby too.
“Again?”
“Right. Back to
“No, you. Well, he is gorgeous too, but you...”
They stepped into the guest house and dropped the luggage in the nice living-room. Draco didn’t have to check the two bedrooms. Merry was as efficient as Poppy.
"So, what? Fucking is fine, but no cuddles after?"
**********
Draco looked around the reception room. It was full of people, friends, family, colleagues... They all came to meet Scorpius and it made him happy. He rocked the baby in his arms for a bit, soothing him as he started to whimper, and finally found the man he was searching for. Harry was on the other side of the room, talking to Blaise and Pansy. He walked to him, smiling to guests on the way and stopped next to the man. He wanted to know. He needed it. But was it a good idea to ask him know? What if the answer wasn’t the one he expected? Did he really want to smile all night in front of the others after that?
Draco heard him mumbling a cleaning spell and moaned at the sensation. Only to moan even harder when he licked at his hole.
"Bringing work home, huh?"
"Mr Malfoy?"
Draco surrendered and gave his son to Harry, before watching him leave the room.
"I will. Are you not leaving?" He didn’t need to cast a
"Yes, you are. Look, my tapas are all wet. Come on, suck it up, have some decency and go talk to him."
“Don’t push things too quickly. She will come back when the time is right. In the meantime, rest too Dear. I don’t want you to get sick too.”
“Yes. I guess it would have been.”
"Well... Sorry boys, but someone’s calling me over there. Have fun!" Pansy said before standing up and leaving, her glass in one hand and her purse in the other.
"Yeah. Just keep going."
"Sorry, I just can’t help it." He climbed on the bed and kissed her forehead. "Hello lovely. How was your day?"
"I just have to take the file, come with me, we’ll keep talking. It’s been a while."
Potter seemed to notice that too. "Fuck, we didn’t even close the door."
Draco looked at him for a while, not really sure how to answer that. Then, with a sigh, he decided to just be honest.
Potter opened his mouth, ready to say something, but the door opened again on the nurse.
"Yeah, I’ll get it!"
The week went by quickly with the two men and the baby spending some quality time with Narcissa at home or outside. They went to the beach which was nearly empty at this season, to the countryside, they visited Saint-Raphael, Frejus and even Cannes. Narcissa even took care of Scorpius one night so that Draco and Harry could go on a date. They made love almost every night, each time more passionate than the previous one. They even switched, Harry bottoming for Draco, but as enjoyable as it was, they quickly switched back, Draco preferring to feel Harry inside of him.
"Not fun. My life was miserable, then. I couldn't grieve properly; they were always there. So, I left."
"Fuck! You feel so good, Malfoy! So tight."
"A type? Yeah, I do have a type."
As he was approaching the end of Diagon Alley, Draco decided he walked enough and got ready to Apparate but, as he drew his wand out, a voice stopped him.
“Cissy must be so excited. When are you going to see her?”
"Did you sell it?"
for me.” The way he said it made Harry moan.
knows what to say. But not with Potter. Potter had always been... different. Harder to talk to. Always bringing the worst out of Draco. In one way or another.
So, seeing Potter that night, clearly happy with the other man, had moved something deep inside Draco. A feeling long forgotten.
“Give him to me, I’ll go do it.”
"You coming here to talk to me." He gestured quotation marks with his fingers while saying the word
The woman stood up and, with the help of both men, they reached the fireplace in no time. When they stopped, she yelped in pain and bent in half, breathing heavily.
"Actually,
Harry enters the room just then and Draco realizes with horror that he’s relieved to see him for the second time already since he woke up. He greets Hermione, doesn’t seem to notice the tension, and silently hands Draco a cup of tea. The cup has a lion on it, running around chasing a stray paint blob. Draco stares down at the cup, the lion looking at him for a mere second, and feels tears threatening to erupt from his eyes. Ah, so he
Rosie slides up to him, smirking, and Harry almost jumps out of his skin. Good thing he never took up being an auror, he would've been terrible. He doesn't know how his reflexes got so bad.
can only come in a box. It's dyed! Vegan dye of course, I redo it every couple months," Rosie explains, running her fingers through her hair.
He’s saved by the bell, as someone enters his store. Harry glances from his painting and is shocked to see Ron standing there, looking around the store for Harry.
For the four months that Draco had been gone, Harry had been struggling to sleep. Usually he would fall asleep after a few hours of tossing and turning, and then wake up to nightmares of what could possibly be happening to Draco. Sometimes he'd even dream of past things, like what would've happened to Draco in the fire if Harry hadn't circled back. Overall, his sleeping pattern had been pretty disrupted. He found it much harder to stay awake during the day, he had deep eye bags, and he was almost constantly in a foul mood.
Ron is about to open his mouth to speak when another figure floos into the room, and Draco spots a very happy looking Granger appear. Well, maybe she’s a Weasley now.
"Well I've come here for a plant that only ever grows here once every two years, and I figured I could find some interesting books in the library, but I never expected to find you here!" Neville explains, "Harry's gone crazy without you!"
They exchange a glance, "Longbottom, I've no idea what you're doing here or why you've referred to me as Draco, but I have work to do so if you could hurry on," Draco says, doing his best impression of someone who's not considering living in a hole and never emerging.
Being famous Harry Potter does have its perks, he thinks, as he is allowed to set up a portkey the second he walks through the office doors. He'll be in and out, he thinks, just seeing Draco is still okay will put him at ease. He'll leave quickly, open up the shop, and then he'll be fine.
"That's good to hear, honestly I'm getting good vibes from you, for now I'll vouch for you, but in the months I've known Draco, I have never once seen him interested romantically in anyone. Between you and me, I think he might still be hung up on a past lover," Rosie whispers conspiratorially, a twinkle in her eye. Harry thinks she's probably telling him, in her eyes a complete stranger, too much information. She probably just loves the drama.
“Dragons?” Harry squeaked loudly his eyes going to the green section on the map. The mountain that he had just seen was in the middle of that section and he felt his mouth go dry. “I can’t believe dragons are real”
“I am a healer at Saint Mungos, I have a higher authority, I will include everything I find in a report” Tobias sounded calm and pleasant but there was steel to his words as he looked at a long roll of paper that had appeared from nowhere. “Now, if you please, Ladies”
“Your mother knew me as Severus, if it pleases you, you may address me as that” Severus said feeling stiff and awkward as he looked down at the boy who was clearly terrified of him. The sight of the wide green eyes set in a pale face reminded him very much of the face he had seen so many times when he had looked in the mirror in his youth. “I am very sorry for my actions yesterday. I should have asked for permission to look into your memories and insured that you would not be forced to relive them. I was hasty in my actions and I owe you an explanation for that. If I might talk to you alone? Perhaps with the elf Jinx for companionship?”
“In mum’s will to Uncle Sev, she gave him everything he needed to make a blood adoption potion. He was excited about it but hasn’t mentioned it since” Harry told the werewolf as the letter became a letter again falling down onto the table in front of them. “He didn’t really explain what it was, but I looked in Uncle Luci’s books and found it”
“I’m sorry Gin, I never wanted to hurt you.”
“Will I be invited to the wedding?”
“Good night, Severus…” Remus smiled his heart a little easier as he kissed the centre of Severus’ chest before closing his eyes as the lights were put out.
“They are, how are you feeling now?” Draco asked and the happy smile slipped away from Harry’s face and his hand trembled around the sandwich as he mumbled his response;
“Well, he did save everyone Pants”
“A little childish fun can be forgiven, I’m sure, my heart. But let us return to the manor”
“So, it would appear, Minerva, though I am surprised that you did not know this, did Dumbledore not inform you of how Lupin and I were corrupting young Harry Potter and making him the next dark lord?” Severus japed trying hard not let his cheeks colour under the watchful stare. It was neigh on impossible though when the woman’s lips pulled into a half smirk.
“Dear Harry, I am very glad that my birthday gift reached you safely and that you enjoy the gifts. I admit I was surprised when you said you knew nothing about our world. I have never lived with muggles (Non-wizarding people) do they all hate magic? I had thought they didn’t know about us” Draco wrote and Harry gave a snort deciding that it was only his aunt and uncle that hated magic. He had always thought it strange but now he suspected that they knew he was a wizard and the insults were just another way of putting him don. “I have sent some of my old books for you, a book of potions, one of charms, a history of magic in Britain, and several old volumes of Quidditch monthly” Harry gasped looking at the package resting on the arm of the chair honestly not expecting anything more but wanting to read more about Quidditch. “My mother informs me your father was a keen Quidditch player when he was in Hogwarts, he played chaser I believe, though people thought he should try for seeker. I do hope that you will write again, you will make a refreshing change from my friend Pansy who believes that everyone should be as excited as her about dresses as if they make her look any less like a pug in a wig. Hoping to hear from you again soon, Draco Malfoy”
“I know…Just excited…” Harry smiled getting back onto the bed and allowing Draco to tug him into a hug. “What if Sev is only doing it because he feels forced?”
Thank you for all the comments and kudos , it makes me really happy xD
“I…Um…I…” Harry spluttered his eyes blinking rapidly, his mouth feeling incredibly dry as he looked to where Remus was pointing and saw a vendor with a push cart that had the words ‘Mama Marbles Fresh Yrun Milk Ice Cream’ painted in changing colours on the side. The man pushing the cart was grinning at children as he handed over cones.
“Oh great! I can’t even have a normal Christmas!”
“Correct, and how much is too much, Draco?”
“Yes, she did, with the help of the Spring bride she learned that even in the dark of winter there is light and beauty. She married the Autumn knight, the twin of the spring bride, and they had the first child of magic. They were neither man nor woman beautiful to behold. That is who your costume is. The Fae child” Remus smiled approvingly at the costume “Your designer chose well the costume suits you”
“I want to be happy for you, Draco, please believe that. But, as you pointed out, I made many mistakes, I hurt you and your mother in ways that I know you can never truly forgive me for, but I do care for you and worry what will happen.”
“Um! Yes!” Harry said swallowing it down surprised to see that more food had been placed onto his plate. Narcissa was looking innocently at him but it was obvious that she had placed the food there. He smiled at her and ate a carrot as Lucius started talking to Draco.
“Madam are you trying to insult me?” Tobias hissed his whole posture and tone changing as he stared at the toad shaped woman whose beady eyes widened with mock surprise as she slapped a hand over her mouth but still Tobias continued “Are you perhaps implying that I don’t know what I am doing? You may consider me to be old Madam but I can assure you that I am not yet senile”
“You shouldn’t spoil Snowdrop so much Harry, she will keep you there for hours if you allow her” Lucius chuckled coming up behind him and Harry flushed his hands stalling on the birds back about to rush out an apology but Lucius’ expression softened “I wasn’t meaning to berate you, Harry, I was only joking. Snowdrop was hand reared and she has always been selfish when it comes to attention and she can be a rather bossy character when she doesn’t get the attention she feels that she deserves” Lucius sat down beside him on the grass completely surprising Harry with the action. The man was wearing a smart dove grey pair of breeches and a silk shirt almost like Mr Darcy from Jane Austin. His long blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail that was fixed into place with a silver clasp. “Draco told me that you were despondent about not being able to do wandless magic”
“Thanks, Harry”
For the story…I hated Merlin being a student in canon. I am a practicing Pagan/Druid and Merlin is sort of like our version of Jesus so making him a student of Hogwarts irritated me so with the power of fanfiction I can change it.
“Thank-you, Severus” Remus whispered and Severus just rolled his shoulders slowly. “Although my curse only affects me once a month the ministry view me as a dark creature and as such wouldn’t even return messages to the owls I sent them about you and my concerns” An animalistic growl left the man’s throat before he could get himself under control again. It didn’t stop the anger Harry could see in the man’s eyes or the sadness as he wrung his hands through his hair and chewed hard on his lower lip. “The only Auror that did reply was Kingsley Shacklebolt and that was only a few days ago. I am sorry Harry, but if I had been the one to take you, they would have screamed kidnap. I wouldn’t have even been able to argue my case before being thrown to the dementors to be kissed”
“You saw the way the were looking at each other when Severus left” Blonde eyebrows wiggled and Harry had to admit that he had noticed a heated look between Remus and Severus and heard the promise that Severus would return, but he didn’t want to think about it. Not now, not ever.
“I think the Wodehouse reds have a good chance”
“Hey, Harry! Did you know that the most famous pirate in the world was a wizard? Blackbeard!” Draco said with more excitement than somebody should when talking about one of the worst pirates. Harry didn’t know much about him or pirates in general, but it seemed that Draco was a huge pirate buff. They were in Madam Aguillard’s boutique, an expensive costume shop that didn’t have anything on the rack but was all custom made, in a small village in the South of France. From the outside the shop appeared to be a small disused charity shop with broken nic-nacs in the windows but once inside it opened into a beautiful costume shop with plush chairs and sketches of past costumes on the walls. Women and men of all ages were bustling around with the harried customers seeking the best in store designers. Harry and Draco had been given Miss and Mr Aguillard, the boutique owners own children to fuss over them. Draco was easy in their opinion as he knew what he wanted Harry had just shrugged deciding to let them pick out a costume for him. “It was how he always managed to have the tips of his beard alight!”
“Truth potion”
“Yes, the bed was comfortable, though a little strange…” Harry answered fidgeting with the lining of his robe before whispering “Um…I’m sorry…”
“You little runt! There is no need to ask who you are! Just like your father! Always looking down your nose at people! Just because your dad bought his way out of Azkaban...” An icy wind whipped around the store and Harry was positive that the light dimmed. A moment later a shadow fell over all of them and Harry blinked slowly.
Please, Please trust me when I say that Covid is not a joke. Yes, some people get it and it is just a cold but others get it and die. Please stay safe out there.
“I can’t remember…Maybe? Probably…” He answered honestly and Draco gave a small hum peering at him through the milky light. “Honestly, I don’t remember…It’s probably because it’s a strange bed, I’m fine, Dray, honest…Let’s just go back to sleep.”
“Some things never change, I will be back in a moment” Remus collected some of his empty bottles and scurried away from the table to go to the bar and Severus and Draco both asked him about Greenfield and Harry gave them the rundown of his brief relationship with Remus Lupin or Paul Greenfield as he had known him.
A short chapter cause I’m still working on my phone >.< My laptop is due to be fixed soon >.< I hope it wasn’t too bad…
“Yes, thank-you” Kingsley repeated ushering the man out while two guards. Both burly and mean looking came in with Bella chained between them. At least, Narcissa believed that it was Bella, her sister had changed so much that it was almost impossible to recognise her. Bella had been beautiful when she had been brought to Azkaban with wild jet back hair that tumbled over stunningly dark features but now. Now she was gaunt. Her hair was a mattered mess, her eyes sunken into her face while her skin looked like it had been stretched over her bones. Her teeth were so yellow they were almost brown and there was spittle clinging to her lips. She was fighting against the guards held in a straitjacket the deranged smile on her face only increasing as she saw Narcissa standing there.
Harry left the small sitting room he used for his therapy sessions. As always, his mind was full, and his skin felt slightly sticky. His mind healer told him that he was doing well but he didn’t feel any different in himself if anything he always felt completely drained and just wanted to curl into a ball on his bed. Instead of heading to his bedroom however he went towards the music room where Draco was having his violin lessons. Severus and Remus had offered him music lessons of some kind and Harry had expressed interest in learning the guitar, but they hadn’t found a teacher yet. He slipped into room and stood with his back against the door watching his friend and allowing the music to wash over him and soothe his mind.
“So, your mother has a bastard? Must have been a shock for you, Crow” Pansy said as they sat in inner waiting room at Pierre’s while Harry and Narcissa were in the back being fitted into styles to see how they would fit and which colours would suit. It was something that Draco knew well but he pitied Harry who had looked like a lost lamb as he had been ushered behind the curtain. He and Pansy had been provided with drinks and sweet treats while they were waiting and Draco helped himself to a macaron and sighed;
“You are most welcome, Kingsley! What will you be wearing? And your daughter?”
“My dear elf, I had no intention of hurting him, or have your masters forbidden me speaking to Harry?”
“The dark lord killed all of the House Elves, Potter, Nagini made short work of them I believe” Draco shuddered violently at the thought. He had never really thought of the elves as anything other than the weird little creatures that served wizards but the thought of them being eaten alive by Voldemort’s serpent was enough to cause a lot of nightmares until he was a very old man.
“He has never flown before Draco”
“On what charge? I was invited, Severus invited me to visit with Harry”
“Yeah, it happened every so often, I didn’t know why, mostly they would just nod or wave?” Harry explained trying to remember the faces of every one of those people, but it was impossible, it had only been brief greetings or sightings, and he didn’t think that any of those would give him the same sense of familiarity as the professor had just done. “The Dursley’s would shoo them off or drag me away. Normally they ended up locking me in my cupboard for it…”
Alpha-Prince Draco Malfoy ran from the palace with anger pulsating through him causing his normally softly spicy scent to smell like burnt sugar and ash. Part of it was anger that soon the palace would be teeming with omega all desperate to try and win him and part was because of his out-of-control hormones. He knew that was the reason he should be mated as soon as possible, he was reaching his maturity and without an omega to help him through his first rut, his father would see him as a threat around his mother. He had been unimpressed with the courtly omegas that had already been presented to him and those that had been brought from distant lands so now his parents were turning to the commoners in the hopes of getting him a mate. It wouldn’t work, he knew that because his inner fox had already decided on a mate. At least he was sure it had.
“They deserve more” Narcissa growled her magic flaring again as there was twin pops from the doorway. The Dursley’s let out a strangled moaning clearly calling for help but Narcissa and Lucius appeared calm.
“I’m sorry about your friend” Harry whispered not knowing what else to say about that statement. She didn’t seem to think that he was being a baby and that made him feel a little bit better.
“Pay attention, Harry, send Lupin an agreement that I will be there with you when you meet him next week, Thursday would be the best day for me, if he doesn’t wish to come here we can meet in Hogsmeade, until we see each other again, read your books” Severus jerked his head and then swept off down the hall leaving Harry to stare at the bellowing robes with a smile.
“Harry, we are so sorry for what we did yesterday. We didn’t mean to startle you! Professor Snape told us off good but honestly, we were big jerks. We forget that everyone isn’t like us. We hope you don’t keep hating us. We are nice guys really (Well I am! Fred is an idiot…Hey! I am not an idiot you’re an idiot) Anyway…We’re sorry again, yours Gred and Forge…” Harry smiled at the strange letter startled by a cracking to his left. Thin fingers grabbed at his ankles as a loud wailing started.
“Hey! Pansy is a lady, you don’t speak that way to a lady” Draco growled and before anyone realised what was happening both Grub and Thomas were being flung backwards into a crystal vase that were filled with Narcissa’s favourite flowers. The vase swayed a few times and then fell to the floor with a loud smash covering both Grub and Thomas with the potion Narcissa used to keep the flowers fresh. The boys dropped to the floor staring in shock and horror before jumping up and stammering
The only things in the room were two life sized dolls with oddly stylised faces. They had evil sharp teeth and long noses with black eyes “They are made to look like Tengu, Japanese demons…I pinched the masks from my boyfriend’s collection. He has about a hundred more so I doubt he will miss these ones. First thing I want you to do is stand in front of the dummies and just focus on pushing them over”
“He is perfectly fine and awaiting our arrival in France, our turn Harry Dear, keep your eyes closed it is less jolting that way” She said leading him into the fire place as it returned to normal. She took a larger pinch of powder from the jar and held Harry close as she too called out “Chateau de Malfoy”
“Without consent! You uncouth, unmannered swine!” Draco spat moving Harry slowly behind him before moving closer to the angry older boy who was just growing ever more angry. Patrons and staff were edging towards them as boxes around them started to shake.
“But nothing like a human?”
“Harry had been more than half starved for most his life, he is on a strict Healer controlled diet and potion regime. However he, is doing extremely well” Severus offered him a warm smile that dulled the harshness of his words and Harry gave him a smile leaning closer into Draco as his cheeks flushed with pride and embarrassment.
“Lord Malfoy, Heir Black-Potter, welcome, I’m very happy that we have finally been able to  sort the matter of your key” The half goblin said with a jerky bow. Harry remembered what Lucius had told him and bowed enough to expose his neck. The goblins liked that and respected you more if you followed their customs.  Even a half Goblin like Tormuld was grateful for the display “I am so very sorry that it has taken us so long, but I have it here now and I was able to visit your vault and find the item requested by Lord Malfoy. Unfortunately, Mr Dumbledore is mentioned on the will and will need to be present at the reading”
“But you were having fun and I ruined it. I ruin everything, I’m just a freak…I can’t even have a day at the zoo without making everyone worry”
“Me neither. But we don’t live in that world Harry, we live in this one and I’m glad of it” Draco’s lips very lightly brushed over his forehead and scar and Harry smiled closing his eyes and snuggling into the arms that were wrapped securely around him. They were so wrapped up in each other neither were aware that the bedroom door had opened and that Narcissa was in the room until she gave a little chuckle.
“Thank-you, Tormuld, you have been most incredibly helpful” Lucius bowed at the Goblin who responded with a lower one of his own.
“Talking to yourself Weasley? Not a good look, you should watch that…”
“They have clearly been hand-reared” Seamus said with a sort of happy lilt looking the birds up and down as he came over from his bed. The Irish wizard had been getting ready to head home for christmas and he, like most of the other wizarding raised, had been more impressed than anything with the courtship. Harry had found that surprising but given that the sender was meant to be his true love he supposed it made sense for them. Harry still wasn’t sold on that, or any of it for that matter, but he was prepared to see it through till the end. The pear tree was sat on his bedside table and he had found that the pears gave off a shimmery glow at night that he rather liked but livestock was a little too far. “My granda breeds racing pigeons, but he likes doves and such like too, by these are a pair of beauties”
“You have a problem with our parents, Ma’am?” Draco asked his tone clipped and edged with ice. For a ten-year-old he had already mastered imposing and Harry smiled knowing that his Uncle Luci would be proud.
“I will do my best. Did you have a good day?” Harry asked and Severus gave him a thin-lipped smile his eyes betraying his feelings before his mouth did as he said dryly;
By the time the dessert trolley was being floated around Harry was full to bursting. He shook his head at the kindly waiter with a thin moustache and beard and sat waiting for everyone else to finish. Thesidious Parkinson was unlike any man that Harry had ever known before, he was lively and jolly constantly gossiping about people that Harry didn’t know. Unlike his aunt there was nothing cold or cruel about his gossiping but it was rather amusing whenever he looked around the private room they were in before leaning his rather broad body over the table with his hand against his mouth whispering;
“Your father was a very good friend to me, when I believed it was better that I didn’t have friends. He wasn’t a saint Harry, there were times he could be very cruel, spoilt, and selfish and there were times...Or one particular time when I wished I had made a different choice but at the end of the day he was a good friend to me, as was your mother and I am truly grateful that I got to know them both” Remus gave him a sad smile and Harry had a feeling that unlike Severus, Remus had come to terms with the deaths of his friends but then again he hadn’t had the weight of guilt crushing him and Dumbledore twisting that even more. “I will be happy to tell you my memories of him, but, I would also like you to stay in touch because you wanted to. I know that you don’t have any reason to believe me but I tried to get you away from the Dursley’s”
“Thank you for the tickets” Harry said automatically and Sho shrugged rubbing the back of his head with his fingers. A shy, pleased smile spread over his lips and Harry wondered what Nino had told him about him.
“Hello boys, sorry I’m a little late Madame Gaiman told me about a colleague of hers who might be willing to teach you guitar, a mister Chuck Shurley”
“I know and I wish I had been more supportive of you back then. I know it wasn’t easy for you and I was your friend before I was your girlfriend.”
“Petunia dear, I’m home” He called out in a chipper voice before looking up and seeing the scene before him. His face turned red and his large neck wobbling as he puffed up like a puffer fish before spluttering “What...What the hell is going on here? What is the meaning of this!”
“For the moment, we have Kingsley on side which I wasn’t expecting” Lucius said sweeping over to the table and sitting down in front of him and Harry. “Jinx, may I have one of your hot chocolates, if you please?”
“That was Dumbledore’s bright idea” Mrs Figg didn’t sound as though she agreed with this Dumbledore and her face reflected that by scrunching up her nose while rolling her eyes. “He said that your aunt was the only family you had left and that he had left a note, a note? Albus Dumbledore might be the lightest wizards of our age but he isn’t the brightest, how could you explain all that in a note? I tried to get him to take you away, I’ve told him time and time again...But...It’s okay, you’ll be at Hogwarts from next year away from that worthless lot. I’m sorry for the part I played but I was worried, I thought if you came here and enjoyed it they would stop you coming. They like to sap away an pleasure you might have...”
“It would make the potion worthless because the mint dilutes the effects of the pine needles and then makes the potion explode” Harry almost chuckled as he remembered doing that as a part of his own lessons with Severus. Under the protective eye of his father he could run a series of experiments with different potions to see what would happen for himself. The explosion had been fun to witness but only because Severus had wrapped them all in a protective bubble or they would have been covered in a bright green slime.
“How can I send a letter?” Harry asked immediately wanting to send a thank you to the boy who had sent him his first ever birthday present.
“Hem hem, this meddling old coot would be Dumbledore of Hogwarts, yes? Hem hem” Umbridge asked as a feather pen scratched against paper where it was floating above her left shoulder. “You say that you informed Albus Dumbledore that Harry Black-Potter was being abused by his relatives but he did nothing? Hem hem”
“Why do you stay if you hate it professor?” Harry almost bit through his lip as the question slipped out before he could stop it. A flush started creeping its merry way up his neck and he waited for Severus to tell him off for asking too many questions but instead the black-haired potions master let out a dry bitter laugh answering with a flippant;
“Love ya’ to, Pants.” Seamus laughed taking the gibe in good humour clearly glad that Flitwick had used a cleaning charm on his face. “I never noticed before, but your wand is something special Harry, what sort is it?”
“Clearly she didn’t, she still loved you Severus”
"Hadrien Junius Peverell" Do you accept the claim of these two men to be your fathers?”
“And you’re not, Harry you are so grown-up in so many ways. You understand more about life than many of your peers ever will, but you are a still a child and sometimes things that aren’t ordinary are scary and confusing more so when so many people are telling you something is wrong” Severus told him seriously, his tone was as annoyingly gentle as it had been the whole time he had been talking and a small part of him wished he would be angry. “It is very much the same in the Wizarding world, not with homosexuality or race, but pure-blood, half-blood, muggle born…And creature status” Severus’ eyes moved to Remus and Remus gave him a small smile and Harry realised that the look didn’t disturb him as much as it would have done. “It isn’t right and you shouldn’t just accept it as the status-quo and not want to change it however, you are ten-years-old, you have had the weight of the world on your shoulders for so long that, for now, I don’t want you to worry about the rest of the world. I want you to worry about you, I want you to be a child. Forget everything you have heard about Homosexuals, when you look at us, what do you feel about us?”
“Of course, they are, blood magic of the Goblin kind very ancient and not something people want to mess with, but of course Dumbledore likes to think he is above such things. I will be heading back to Hogwarts for a while, once you leave this room do not enter it again until I return”
“I...Um...Sorry...” Harry apologised quickly dragging his hand through his messy hair making it even more of a mess than normal. Draco’s pale eyebrows drew together as he pursed his lips asking in a clipped tone;
“What?” McGonagall spluttered ripping the hat off Draco’s head while the great hall buzzed with excitement all craning their necks to see where Harry Potter was.
“He didn’t have to say it, I could see it in his eyes!” Draco laughed before his expression clouded over and he looked upset. Slowly he started biting on his lower lip, a habit that Lucius and Narcissa were trying hard to get him to stop. “Though…I hope that you will stay here. Even when you are Lupin and Sev’s child”
“Immediately if you would wish it Lord Malfoy”
“Master Lupin. Welcome to my home”
“Yup, you are amazing”
“Sorry, Rolf, we’re still looking into finding a way of teaching others…” Harry gave his friend an apologetic smile. It wasn’t the first time Rolf had said as much and Harry couldn’t help but still feel guilty.
Charles ‘Chuck’ Shurley was unlike anything Harry was used to within the wizarding world. In fact, he looked nothing like a wizard. He wore scruffy jeans, scuffed canvas shoes, white t-shirt and a green army style jacket. His light brown hair was curly and was as messy as Harry’s had been before the Malfoy’s had given him the smoothing hair cream. He had an equally scruffy beard and pale blue eyes that seemed red around the rim as though he could use a whole weeks’ worth of sleep. He seemed to have a nervous energy about him, and his eyes were darting frantically around the room thought that might be because he was being stared at by both Severus and Lucius who made a formidable pair. The teacher had been happy to come for an interview glad of any chance of getting a job, at least according to madam Gaiman, but now it appeared he was regretting all his life choices up to this point.
“You’re not wearing your glasses!”
“I’m sorry”
Merry Christmas!
“Dray, you don’t have to…”
“I’m sorry” Harry shifted in the bed turning until they were nose to nose. His body was still tense but Draco was sure that he was starting to relax. Draco let his hand move up and down his side slowly in what he hoped was a soothing way. Harry didn’t seem to mind and he continued slowly saying;
“No! They lost, that’s it! There’s no need to be a sore loser! Yer talk like that and yer’ll never come again, so yer won’t” Mrs Finnigan hissed pushing her son out of the booth until he was almost stumbling into theirs. The woman’s eyes widened as she looked at Draco and for a moment Harry thought she was about to make the sign of a cross or something but her son, Seamus, who seemed to be in jolly sprits in spite of his complaining seemed more than willing to be friendly and banter about the match.
“Draco Malfoy. Pleasure” Draco said in a soft voice and Harry gave a nod before pulling his hand back and running his hand through his hair which was a lot better behaved than it used to be though that could have something to do with the fact it was a lot longer than it used to be and even the Potter hair couldn’t fight gravity. “...It has been a while, Potter...”
“Understandable my dear boy, after such an upset but don’t worry I’ve spoken with your aunt and uncle and its alright! They have forgiven you and are happy to take you home!”
“Dobby?” He called with a grandfatherly smile fixed on his bearded face. His blue eyes where made brighter in the light of the hospital ward and the elf blinked slowly his mouth opening and closing as he tried to get rid of the potions he had been no doubt doused with. “Dobby, my name is Albus Dumbledore…Do you know me?”
“Hello”
“Hullo, Mrs Figg is upstairs, would you like me to fetch her?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Healer Hinchcliffe, I understand you are examining him but what are you looking for, exactly?”
“Payback! He took Lee’s letter from his grandmother yesterday and tossed it into the fire, it was the last letter she ever wrote him, she passed away over Christmas. He must have known what it was, but he didn’t care he just said it was a load of rubbish…” Fred growled his eyes flashing with an anger that Harry had never seen in the blue before. Draco puffed up with his own anger growling
“Thank-you” Narcissa’s voice was breathless her head feeling a strange mix and lightheaded and full. Her skin was pricking with chills and she was increasingly grateful for Kingsley’s warm sturdy presence at her side. She really longed for this to be over, but she knew that she had to take a moment to collect herself before facing Bella. She breathed as deeply as she dared trying her best to not take in any of the smell.
“Sir? No sir, I just…I didn’t think…I’m just…I’m just a servant, sir…”
“Never apologise for wanting to learn, Harry, but we have news” Severus said putting his hand on the back of Remus’ chair. “We have asked the friend of Mistress Gaiman to come in for an interview next week”
I am so sorry for how crappy this chapter was after such a delay. Honestly I have two weeks of freedom and I wanted so much to write good chapters and post delay and then on Saturday I found out that one of my favourite Actors from Japan, Haruma Miura, tragically took his own life at 30.
“People just came up to you in the street?” Severus asked with a disapproving tone and Harry almost squirmed under the look. Thinking back it was rather dangerous that random adults could just come up to him and take him off the street, more so with what he knew of the followers of Voldemort now.
“Yes, mama, when will you be returning to England, Pants?” Draco asked as they made the way out of the palace gardens, once again going through the private gate. The street seemed to have less people now and it was easier to walk through but Harry stayed close to Draco.
He was the reason I started writing in the first place so I lost all motivation what with losing Paul in November then my father in January then I started working on my original novel which I hope to publish through amazon in memory of my father. BUT I am hoping that I will have a new chapter of penpal out for you in February
“I will always be on your side, Dray, but you also have Pans, Seamus, and the twins…” Harry smiled snuggling more into his friend resting his head against his chest so he could listen to the sound of his heart. It was a comforting steady sound, and he allowed the steadiness of it to regulate his own heartbeat and allow it to soothe away his anxiety. “But I still wish people could know the real you. You and Aunt Cissy and Uncle Luci…”
“My dear, I have no idea what you mean” Narcissa played innocent but Harry had the feeling that she knew what her husband was getting at and he felt that Lucius was worried that Narcissa might hurt his aunt and uncle for what they had done to him. The thought was warming and he found himself smiling even as the beautiful witch changed the subject by spying a book on the table. “Oh! Boris the brave! I have always loved this story, do you remember Dragon that I would read it to you when you had bad dreams”
“That isn’t how this works.” The hat sounded amused and Draco shrugged prepared to be under the hat for as long as it took to get it to agree. He knew that the hat could feel that resolve and it almost tested it by almost shouting out Slytherin.
“You will find me more a challenge than a ten year old boy. Now please be silent the aurors will be here soon and they will deal with you, of course if you try anything I might think that you are attacking and I must warn you that I am a master of self defence”
“They bes in Mistresses butterfly rooms little Master! With Potions Master Snapes and Little Master Dracos. You wishes for mees to fetchen them Little Master Harrys?”
“Better, I am so…” Harry started but the taller boy came over and held his shoulders his light grey blue eyes staring into his green ones as he cut him off.
Thank you all so much for your kind messages. I read and treasured them all. The last week or so has been a blur as you can imagine. My boyfriend’s official funeral was last Thursday but of course I wasn’t able to attend. His parents have said that when we are able, we will have another ceremony so I will be able to say goodbye. It is very kind of them. I still keep waking up thinking that it has been a horrible dream and that he will phone, and everything will be okay
“Why would you think that?”
“It isn’t all that interesting, but you will enjoy yourself at the party. After all, all our friends will be there. Oh! We should ask Mother if we can go to France instead of Diagon for our costumes! they have the best designers and I want to be a Pirate!”
“But not Dobby?”
“And you would think we would know?”
“Yes, I think I will try one of the chocolate ones you favour…Shall I pour another cup?”
“Yes, he threatened you with telling the wizarding world of your creature status if you did not comply with his demands, that is the very definition of the word blackmail”
*-*-*-*
The palace was brimming with excitement, people having come from far and wide to witness the meeting of Prince Draco and his betrothed Lord Harry. Draco had lost count of the amount of people he had given false smiles to and thanked for their congratulations. He knew that all of them believed Dumbledore when he said that his and Harry’s union would finally rid the world of Voldemort, but he couldn’t deny he wanted to scream at them for being happy when he was so miserable. An hour into the ball the horns sounded sharply, and the palace crier cleared his throat announcing
“You are right, I am not. Much less of those that I have of your mother. I had very little light in my life save for her and I treasure those memories and I hold them close but I would like very much for you to know a little of your mother”
“Thank-you” Harry replied though Draco was sure that he didn’t really believe it but he was too polite to say that. “This...This is really my room?”
“You and Remus, you are a couple?” He wanted to fight against it but he could feel the truth potion forcing him to answer, giving even more information than he had wanted to share.
“Thank-you” Harry smiled at the elf who gave him a little smile back before Lucius rather dramatically pushed the door open and swept inside. Narcissa followed and although he didn’t want to go in Harry allowed Jinx to carefully usher him forward. She didn’t pull just gently guided him forward until they were standing in a room that seemed to be made completely of wood with thousands of books lining one wall. A huge carved desk took up most of the space though there were dark green arm chairs in front of a fire place. On the wall was another painting who seemed to be glaring darkly at one of the men sitting in the arm chair to the left.
“And you could understand it?” Draco gasped clutching at his whisky glass and staring in shock. Even now he could remember Voldemort talking to that hideous snake of his. He shuddered just for a moment before assuring himself that Harry was in no way like that man.
“By a mere handful of months” Severus pouted shocked when Remus managed to playfully trip him without making him fall over. For a wild moment Harry, and Remus, both thought the wolf might have taken it too far, more so when Severus growled staring hard at the other man, but then Remus suddenly had his hair pulled by invisible hands “I take it back, you are a juvenile!”
When he woke up again it was to Jinx pulling at his bed sheets her bright elven eyes staring at him as she gave him a smile. Draco’s side of the bed was already empty and cold, and Harry shivered wrapping himself in the heavy blanket. Even in a magical manor they couldn’t deny it was almost winter and his feet were freezing.
“It was nothing serious father, they called Pansy ugly”
“Okay, Uncle Sev” Harry grinned happily watching the man turn smartly on his heel and walk away with his robes bellowing without even a hint of wind. It was impressive and Harry knew he had to be using a spell to make it happen.
“Tag!” He said before turning sharply and flying away from Draco who laughed and turned sharply to follow him across the pitch. Harry felt excitement bubbling away inside of him as he was chased by the laughing Draco. Never had he had a friend so willing to play with him before, at least not one that Dudley couldn’t bully away, and he made the most of it. The two played Tag for a good half an hour before Lucius fired some sparks from his wand before getting on his own broom and flying towards them with a ball, about the same size as a football, tucked under his arm.
“Yes, there is one in the office, Midge” Lucius called and another House elf appeared bowing at his master so low his nose almost pressed against the floor. “Please show Auror Nightingale to the west office and allow her to use the floo”
“Pull yours Harry!” He said cheerfully and Harry did so holding his breath and watching, as a shower of sparks fell all around him along with a black hat with a stuffed Hedwig perched on top and a snake curled around the brim. The toy inside his cracker was a chess set with the figures being birds one side and snakes the other.
“Excuse me, madam?”
He hadn’t known the significance of what had happened until later, when he realised that his body and his fox didn’t react to any of the other omegas or even betas that were around the palace. As he grew it got worse to the point that if an omega, he wasn’t attached to came up to him he would almost gag on the feeling of his fox trying to get away. A frantic search in the large city library told him what was wrong, he had scent bonded with the strange omega in the woods and his fox would never truly be able to accept another. There were ways of forcing a connection with another shifter, but it was never stable and there was a very real chance that he could end up rejecting any and all children his partner bore or worse killing them. As much as he tried to tell his fox that he would never get the mate it desired no shifter could truly fight a scent match.
“Michael Christopher was the eldest and Matthew Lawrence the youngest...My husband’s name was Stanley though every one called him Lee, his father was Stan you see made it less complicated. He was a butcher by trade had his own shop on the high street. He was the most handsome man I had ever seen. Sorry Harry, you don’t want to be listening to an old woman’s tales” She sighed rocking herself slowly as once again she started to knit her needles clicking in the silent attic as she counted the stitches under her breath. Harry wanted to ask but he was once again terrified that he had pushed too far and slowly he started reading through the book again until there was a hooting of an owl ad the fluttering of wings. “Seems the post has arrived, you are a handsome looking bird” Mrs Figg cooed as a huge but graceful Eagle owl flew in through the window. It was almost three times the size of Plum and had talons that were built for ripping flesh from bone however it landed carefully on the arm of Mrs Figg’s chair and held up its leg so she could take the letters from its leg. “Two letters today, ah but there’s one for me as well...Such pretty handwriting, here you are Harry dear”
“Do you think he will go home?”
” The snake rose pressing its pretty rainbow coloured belly to the glass and focusing its eyes directly into his. Harry looked over at Remus and Severus feeling almost sick when he saw how shocked their expressions were and how pale Severus looked.
“That’s awesome Harry, hey maybe we can form a band! I’m awesome on drums, and Fred is a pretty decent singer…”
“Of course, but do be careful, my heart, you’re not as young as you once were. Boys, take a few steps back…”
“See you soon, Boy, I will have a name for you when I next see you”
On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me...
“I see. Then I suppose we will have to save him some cupcakes for when he awakes” Lucius laughed setting down his newspaper and holding up a spare silver tipped quill “Shall we Harry? I really would like to beat Severus this morning. He has gotten the best of me three days in a row”
In case you hadn’t noticed Potter, I am very blonde...” He said with a roll of his noble shoulders that caused his thin barely there chest muscles to react. It was a simple act but it got Harry hot and bothered and he moved forward again crushing his mouth to Draco’s. He didn’t have a great deal of experience in the kissing department but he had to admit that Draco’s were the best he had ever had. They felt so natural, so right, he thought he could probably get dizzy off of them. While they kissed his hand moved back down to cup and fondle the cock his body twitching in excitement as it continued to stiffen against his palm. Their moans grew louder but each of them swallowed them down into each of their own mouths and both hadn’t noticed that the shower had long since stopped spraying many minutes ago .
“Harry! Draco! Wake up!” Pansy screeched loudly as she ran into their room and threw herself on the bed crushing Harry’s legs under her weight. Harry grunted wiggling out from under the girl while shooting her a playful, sleepy glare. He pushed his hair out of his eyes and looked at Draco who was curled onto his side his face buried under the pillow.
“Uncle Sev” Harry hummed when he was chopping some mint leaves with a silver knife. Ever since that first day of potions with Severus Harry had fallen in love. It was like cooking and he had always enjoyed cooking. The Malfoy potions room was in a dungeon under the kitchen lit by old style torches that shone with a strange green/blue flame that didn’t seem to give off any heat. Draco enjoyed potions as well but not nearly as much as Harry and he found the simple potions boring so he had left an hour or more ago while Harry had stayed.
“I’m sorry”
Once dry and dressed for the day he went out into his bedroom dodging a pillow that was thrown in his direction. Feathers were floating around the room, dancing in the upward drafts, and Harry looked at Draco and Pansy who were bouncing on the bed, more feathers in their hair and their night clothes a mess. It was difficult to believe that these were the heirs of two great houses and that one day they would be known as lord Malfoy and Lady Parkinson. Harry lifted a Snape like eyebrow as he looked at them and Draco threw another pillow.
I honestly feel like this year has been some sort of trial run for hell….
“No, sir,”
“You are always welcome here, though if you use a spell like that on my son or my ward again I will see to it that is never true again” Narcissa said in a clipped down coming back into the dining room and standing with her back to the door. People who were afraid of Lucius were wrong, sure he could be a blood thirsty bastard sometimes but he had nothing on Narcissa. The woman knew more about poisons than anyone and she would feed it to you with a smile on her face. She was sister to Bellatrix Lestange after all.
“Can you blame him? He seems to be rather attached to Harry already and you hurt him” Lucius’ eyes were steely as he leaned back in his chair his fingers holding the stem of his wine glass loosely and Severus felt his stomach knot with more guilt. He hadn’t inflicted the wounds on the boy but he as good as did by forcing him to reply them time and time again. However, he was not a man used to admitting fault and he had no idea how to apologise to Harry for what he had done.
“The brownies are more comical? I would say, and they like to tell stories…In fact a lot of stories of the Brownies tell of Shadow plays” Remus explained while Jinx looked nervous her bright smile fading as she obviously wondered if he didn’t like the gift. Harry wanted to tell her that it was okay but, in all honesty, he didn’t really know what to make of the little creature with pure white hair.
“Dad? Did he say dad?” A low murmur broke out from the other students and they all craned their necks to get a better look at them. Harry immediately felt uncomfortable and shrunk back to Draco and Severus.
“He is incredibly bright for a boy his age; he would do well in any house” Severus sounded almost proud as his hand came down to lightly grip at Harry’s shoulder. The action caused Harry’s cheeks to warm brightly as he took the present from Flitwick.
“Malfoy…No need to ask who yer are....Yer look just like yer dad” Hagrid’s somewhat friendly smile fell away as he looked at Draco, his eyes narrowing in suspicion and Harry felt himself shift towards his friend as the giant’s eyes moved on to him. They studied him for just a moment and then he gasped. “Arry…Arry Potter! Bleedin ell! Yer look just like yer dad…Xcept yer got yer mams eyes…”
“I could show you the Quidditch pitch! And the Library we have loads more books!”
“My dragon, you have a heart of gold, the feelings you have only prove that. You care for your friend and hate that he has suffered so, your father is the same and myself. I saw the marks and believed that Pansy was right. Perhaps we should introduce the Dursley’s to my sister”
*-*-*
Harry stared at the red masked dummy in front of him. He didn’t really understand what he was meant to be doing so he looked at Draco who had the same look of confusion on his paler face. His blond eyebrows were furrowed, and his lips pursed.
“Master Draco!” Jinx’s high pitched voice squeaked as she popped into the room with a loud crack her hands soapy a dish cloth in one hand. Her large eyes moved to Harry and she vanished the dishcloth and soap. “Little Master, youses been having a funnies turns again?”
“Black-Potter, Kingsley Shacklebolt agreed that I had rights to take him as my ward while the matter of his relatives is taken care of”
They were shown to a tiny room that looked like it had been used for storage and had only just been cleaned out. It was dirty, cramped and there were stains that Narcissa didn’t even want to think about covering the floor. A chair had been placed in the centre of the room and Narcissa wasn’t sure if that was for her or her sister, but she wasn’t planning on using it. Her nerves fluttered around like a swarm of terrified butterflies and her hand went to the locket she was currently wearing. It was embossed with two butterflies and when opened had two photos. One of Draco and the other of Harry. The knowledge that she was doing for Harry kept her from physically throwing up what little she had managed to eat for breakfast that morning. Kingsley’s steady presence was calming but Dobble was starting to irritate her, she needed him to leave so they could perform the next part of their plan.
“A little bit sir” Harry nodded sucking in a breath at the ache that came over him. He refused to show weakness however and he downplayed the pain that he was feeling. Tobias didn’t seem fooled however and he lightly urged him to turn around and lifted the shirt up so he could look at his back. Harry closed his eyes again not wanting to see Lucius’ face as he saw the marks from the belt. Lucius was going to know that he was a bad boy. The doctor traced a few of the deep marks before studying his shoulder blades.
I hope this is okay
“Th-Thank-you” Harry breathed managing to give the earnest face a weak smile before taking the drink. He gave it a tentative sniff before poking out his tongue. The drink was a mixture of sour and sweet with a tingle of pepper that clung to the very back of his tongue. His stomach still churning from the magic and he was sure he would be sick again but as soon as he drank the drink his stomach immediately felt better. The strange big eared gave him a bright grin giving him a big thumbs up.
lucius is overly sweet but i like him like this, im so sorry for the delayyy
“Good morning, boys, how are you?” He asked warmly. Harry half expected Draco to be jealous that the man was still here considering he had a crush on Nino, but his friend seemed completely non-pulsed by him being there.
I hope that this isn’t lame, sorry for not posting yesterday but I had my last Japanese lesson of the year on Tuesday and it was super busy but no I am free for a few weeks xD
“We were just heading to bed and thought we would come and see how you are. Harry, dear, how are you feeling?”
“Y-yes, sorry...” Harry answered coming back to the present with a bump and flashing a little smile before focusing on the questions.
“Um, what’s a time turner?”
“Being pushed”
“I assume that there is a copy in Gringotts, unfortunately until the Ministry officially recognises Lucius and myself as Harry’s legal guardians, we are not in a position to be able to view such a thing and Harry is a minor”
“Maybe he is, but I can assure you that he is in the minority. Harry answer us honestly, is it the fact that we are in a romantic relationship or the fact that we are having sex that bothers you the most?”
“Whatziz?” He grumbled sitting up and glaring out at the morning with sleep crust clinging to his eyelashes and a small amount of drool on his lower lip. He was so decidedly uncool that it made Harry smile, but he liked Draco like this. “You got a package from Gringotts? From Tormuld…” Draco told him through a long, nosy yawn throwing the package further down the bed before curling back up in the pillow. “Wake me up later…”
“Oh, he told me to come several hours ago, I came in my own time” Severus said moving to sit in the chair next to Draco a wine glass immediately filling with a ruby red wine. “Not for Dumbledore I ask this but for myself, what are you playing at?! Taking Potter’s brat!”
“Because you call me names all the bleeding time, the twins too…”
“Have you been waiting long?”
“Are you ready?”
“He was sent a letter by owl, but it never reached him. The poor bird returned looking rather shell shocked to say the least. Whenever he returns from his sabbatical, he will find out the offer has been rescinded as part of the shake up of the castle” Lucius shrugged carefully aware that Narcissa had fallen into a fitful slumber against him. His fingers continued to move against her hair and shoulder a tender smile on his face as he looked down at her. “Excuse me gentlemen but I will take my wife to bed. I bid you all a good day”
“I’m glad, that is one of my favourites as well.” Remus smiled in a soothing way and together they walked the long distance to the village talking about nothing important for a while. “You would think the Dursley’s would pay to have their own well cleaned and fixed.”
“The ways of the enemy are often beyond  our understanding, please, indulge an old friend” Albus smiled once again looking as though everything was going according to his plan and Filius nodded before looking warily at Tormuld who gave a shrug and handed over the will. Filius performed several spells onto the paper, many Narcissa knew but some left her stumped. Eventually he slipped his wand back into his holster and said slowly;
“Please I must beg you to forgive me. I...I am a man that holds a great many regrets but rarely apologises for them” He said eventually moving to sit in the chair in front of the boy. He looked so much like his oldest rival with Lily’s eyes that it was hard for him to see anything else but as he looked at him he saw the differences clearly. Neither James nor Lily had had the haunted, pinched looks in their faces, or been as small and painfully thin. “I hated your father when we were boys at school. I could hardly not, he was handsome, popular, rich, with close friends, and had all the arrogance of youth with it. He would tease those with no money,  In short, everything I didn’t have but wanted. I came from a poor family, my mother was a pure blood my father was a muggle who liked to drink, when he drank he would take out frustrations with the world on me and my mother. In the same ways your uncle and aunt would treat you my father would do the same. The one brightness in my life was a friend I made one time while on a park. Her name was Lily Evans”
