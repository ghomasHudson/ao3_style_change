He considered Hermione again. Draco no longer thought of her as a Mudblood, merely as an idealistic, overbearing, know-it-all, do-gooder. Which was quite bad enough.
"Damned buttons," Draco said and trailed his lips and tongue over Harry's collarbone while his fingers caressed Harry's ribs. Harry made a breathy sound that made Draco pull him in until their bare torsos touched. Harry's flesh was warm against Draco's chilled skin.
"Where to now?" Potter asked as Draco draped an arm over Potter's shoulders and Pansy clutched Draco's bicep in a death grip.
"All in good time, Potter. Now hold tight." Draco smirked as any reply was cut off by a gasp when Draco closed his mouth over Potter's nipple and sucked hard. He glanced up to see the tendons in Potter's arms tighten as he gripped the bars tighter.
"This is where Greyback grew up, although he was never seen there after he left home. I'll mark it as low probability."
"Someone will make sure I get home," Harry replied, trying not to sound bitter when he realized the only person he wanted to see him home was not on that list of someones.
"Hex you? Why?" Draco found it far more likely that she would hex Draco's balls into boil-ridden melons, if she hadn't already moved out.
"What were you planning to do with the bed?" he asked, almost afraid of the answer. He wasn't sure his reputation could survive him delving into the pornography industry. His cock critiquing business was relatively above-board, and altogether anonymous, sent to paying magazines via public owl on a regular basis.
Potter lounged on a black motorcycle parked on the other side of the street. His eyes were fixed on Draco with an intensity that nearly took Draco's breath away. Bloody hell, Potter had changed. He wore a dark green shirt similar to the Muggle t-shirt Draco wore. It was pulled tight across the corded muscles of Potter's shoulders and accented his biceps.
"God, no!" Harry's toes were apparently far too responsive for that and the bloody salve was not helping matters.
Harry struggled to get his hands out of the shirt, but Draco snagged the material and pulled it up to hook the shirt behind his neck, effectively trapping Harry's hands close to his head.
Draco rolled sideways and trapped Harry beneath him without breaking the kiss. How many times had he dreamed about Harry while trapped in that hell below? Sometimes the memories had been the only things keeping him alive. Draco rubbed his hands over Harry's skin and started to move, rocking in and out of Harry's tight opening and making sure to hit that one particular spot that made Harry writhe…
Harry sighed heavily and returned to his ledgers, hoping Draco would tire of the motion and go back to his writing. As he sat and squeaked, Draco stared at the ceiling and flicked at his lips with his quill, apparently lost in thought.
That was because Draco had located and paid off everyone with access to that knowledge, or at least all of the ones who would have sold the information. "Which parts? Even I can't get the Department of Mysteries." That was also a blatant lie. Draco prided himself on his fibbing skills.
Draco thought about Angelo Belbin, a fit blond Chaser for the Kenmare Kestrels. It was an interesting choice. "Why did you quit the Aurors?" He picked up a book on Potter's nightstand and was surprised by the title.
"All in good time. Now, put your hands up on the headboard and grip the bars—I approve of your bed, by the way, nice use of iron and very convenient handholds. I didn't expect you to be so kinky."
"You once called me a wretched, substandard, pathetic excuse for a wizard," Mulciber said. "Do you recall?"
He reached up to the waistband of his briefs and pushed his thumbs inside, preparing to shove them down.  As soon as he did so, Hermione shouted an incantation and Harry felt a brush of magic.
Potter smiled arrogantly and Draco almost laughed realizing how badly Potter had wanted to claim him like that—how badly, and he suspected
, but said instead, “Is that a problem?” Harry just gaped as if that was the most incomprehensible thing he’d ever heard. “School is when you form these alliances,” Draco said, wondering that he’d have to explain this to Potter of all people, who as a first year had begun building the alliance that would ultimately bring down the Dark Lord.
Draco swallowed. He’d never seen Potter like this: confident, he’d almost have said flirtatious. He wished there were some notebooks or supplies he could put away, something to distract. He tried to move away, like he might check the room for non-existent debris, but Potter just grabbed his hand and pulled him back to face him.
Draco took a shaky breath, weighing a general-purpose irritation at anything Potter might demand against his need to teach his Housemates some workable spells. “Go ahead and hex me.”
As he entered the Moonhouse for Monday’s club meeting, he noticed immediately that the room was larger—with reason it turned out, since there were three new Hufflepuffs--Lucy’s work no doubt. She’d been nothing but welcoming to the Slytherins but he couldn’t blame her for wanting to balance the numbers a bit; no one wanted Moonriders to be a Slytherin club.
A squeal from Lucy drew his attention. Antonio: he’d almost forgotten. The fifth year was not carrying a single image as Draco had suggested, but an entire portfolio.
. Please, just don’t offer an open promise like that.” Luna was from an old magical family: she’d have been taught from a young age that breaking promises was no trivial thing for any magic-user. What she’d not been taught is that there were people in their world who’d jump to take advantage of that.
Before Harry could explode, Draco said, “Your highness, perhaps you could explain why we need a strategy.”
He tried not to stare at Potter too obviously. His “Er, so I’m Harry,” was met by three pairs of raised eyebrows. “Right, you know that. So, uh, the key to casting a
“Same reason that mine did,” Draco said drily.  “Because our only prayer of reentering society and restoring our family’s fortunes depends on our N.E.W.T.s.”
Pansy smiled demonically. “Well, good job, Blaise. Perhaps this year will not be a complete waste of time after all.” She jumped up from her seat and moved towards the door of their car.
Potter was staring at him thoughtfully and then shook his head. “So it’s just a few protection spells?”
—if you can’t even get the name right!” Harry just folded his arms impatiently. “At the time I wanted something sufficiently unpleasant and humiliating; otherwise they wouldn’t value the lessons.” Harry scoffed in disgust. “For the fiftieth time, they’re not fucking Gryffindors.”
Draco found himself struggling for his self-control as certain physical signs that had not revealed themselves for Luna bloody Lovegood now chose to manifest.
“Whatever you say, Darling, but if you are planning a general campaign of seduction, make sure you save him for last.”
He prayed heaven for patience. Princess Lucy was whispering something else to Luna, who whispered back, causing excited… hopping.
? That doesn’t make any sense—I tried to hit you with a tracking spell and it just bounced off, but you didn’t cast or anything.”
The largest drawing, which formed a centerpiece of the collection, showed the Saga group and featured a longer loop than usual: Lucy and Draco engaged in an impassioned dispute, Lucy getting up on her knees and pointing at him in triumph, while Draco covered his face with his hands, only to repeat in one of Antonio’s marvelously smooth transitions. Draco remembered the argument perfectly, their hundredth over the Battle of the Bands, but what he’d not noticed at the time was that Harry had been there, lying on the floor, head propped his elbow. Draco’s eyes burned to see Harry’s expression—he was looking at him with such depths of affection.
“She testified for you—I did. Because I thought you’d somehow changed, but I was wrong, wasn’t I. You’re still a manipulative prat, who doesn’t care who he hurts so long as you get what you want.”
3:30 the next afternoon found him in the Room of Requirement sitting in a circle—on the floor!--with Luna, Lucy and five Hufflepuff girls, aged 14 or so, for the inaugural meeting of the Fury Moonrider Fan Club.
Finally it all just exploded. “Do you even know it was the Gryffindor third years?” he shouted, after the idiot bloke who cast the
I doubt it's news to any reading this that we in the US live in very divided times.  One of the inspirations for the story was listening to never-Trump Republicans talk about the left (my own side)--just how perplexed they often are at how we think about power and strategy. If we get through this period with our values and institutions intact, I hope that going forward we'll do a better job understanding that some people really do approach the world differently, that there is nothing inherently wrong with being a Slytherin, however alien it may feel to those who (to paraphrase one never-Trumper,) "can't have a rally without tears and folk songs."  I hope there will be Lucys and Lunas and Dracos and Persephones and of course Harrys to figure out how to rebuild something healthier and fairer and more compassionate for everyone.
Draco was doomed. There was no other word for it. He’d had plenty of fantasies about Potter manhandling him, sucking him off, shagging him. But somehow he’d never imagined Harry like this—so confident—so demanding.
. Keeping his eyes on Potter’s, Draco undid his trousers and released his cock, which was rapidly hardening. In a single, graceful movement, Draco swallowed him down. Harry’s eyes darkened. There was no way he could think this was Draco’s first time. In fact, Potter looked like he wanted yank him off and throw him over the back of the sofa. Next time. Draco smiled around Harry’s cock, and did a little flicker with his tongue that Blaise had taught him.
Draco went deep, sucking hard, and then stretched his tongue to rub improbably far along his sac. Judging from the nearly hysterical response, that area should be bookmarked for further exploration. In fact…
. “You do realize that word could be synonymous with Slytherin? But it doesn’t have to be a bad thing. I put you and Persephone together because you, Harry, are going to have power. You don’t get to decide not to—it’s just the way it is. You’ll either wield it to get things you want, things you think are good for our society, to support people who are worthy, or others will wield it in your name for their own benefit.”
“Her name is Lucy Borgia. I don’t have to explain myself to you. The better question is why you’re here, if you’ve no interest in the band
Draco fought and lost a short, pitched battle with himself. “Why are you asking me this?” he snapped.  “After everything?  Why did you testify?” He recalled that dreamy voice detailing to the whole Wizengamot how he’d brought water to her in the dungeon, cast a cleaning charm for her. There’d been no hesitation--she’d been utterly clear that he didn’t deserve conviction. Her testimony hadn’t helped as much as Potter’s, naturally, but Draco was more moved by it. After all, Potter had a hero complex the size of bloody Scotland—of course
The storm itself broke the following Thursday morning during breakfast, two weeks into Draco and Harry’s affaire-de-coeur. The assembled diners were stunned by the entry of an entire flock of golden eagles flying in perfect formation along the illusioned ceiling that transformed to a magnificent sunset to do justice to the majestic birds. After the circling the room three times, the eagles fanned out to drop letters to every member of Moonriders.
So it appeared Harry Potter was now a member of Moonriders. Draco had rather thought he’d drop now that the MYSTERY was solved, but Potter slunk in about ten minutes after Club Hours started, even though Draco noticed that Harry had not bothered to show up to classes.
“Well it’s good to hear your mother wasn’t one to make a fuss: I knew I liked her, but a husband fucking his way to power and prestige is one thing. A son is another.”
At the next meeting of Moonriders there were three new members, two second-years and a first-year Slytherin—from the body language, they were there on Persephone’s initiative. Interesting. She’d not asked him permission but Draco couldn’t see his way to objecting. It was clear they’d been coached on how to navigate a Moonriders meeting, quickly sorting themselves to the different areas—drawing, listening, the scrap-book, keeping clear of Draco’s own area, the Saga.
As the first years came forward, there seemed a rather annoying surplus of A’s—Aberdeen, Archer, Arrowpoint, Azari, went to Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Ravenclaw and then Gryffindor, producing that house’s usual absurd roars of congratulations.  Then came Bartleby, Belton, Bishop, Black (no relation), Black
.” She pointed, a long line from her shoulder to the tip of her slender finger, and when Harry followed her gaze, he spotted his son. Albus was, sure enough, leaning not-so-casually against Madam Malkins window and staring not-so-surreptitiously at a pair of girls sharing a sundae at Flortesque’s. Harry thought they were in at least their third year, he was sure he’d seen them at King’s Cross the last two years James had been going to Hogwarts.
“Brilliant,” he sighed, “Scorpius, could you fetch him and meet us at Potage’s? We need to pick up some cauldrons that don’t bite and your father needs a new silver one. Then we’ll go meet your brother at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.”
“I know what you did, don’t I? I saw the whole thing.” Scorpius shook off his dad’s hands and crossed his arms petulantly. “Sure it was bad, but you want us to suffer for it? You don’t think we should get to have you to make pancakes with and play Quidditch with and to give us annoying lectures about proper etiquette and to brew Pepper-Up when we get sick and to keep us all in shape? Do you know what this family would look like with Harry running things?”
Harry made sure to watch as Scorpius ran off, and shot a few withering glares at some of the passers by who looked like they might comment. They’d learned years ago that no one said anything when Harry was walking around with Draco’s son. It was only when Draco was around that suddenly Scorpius’ parentage made him a public menace. It was right after Astoria had vanished, leaving just a note, and Harry had offered to take all the kids to Diagon so Draco could think about where he wanted to go from there. It was the first time Harry had been out with Scorpius that no one had sneered at the boy, and he had a lot of memories to compare it to. He had grown closer to Draco after Ginny died in a Quidditch accident shortly after Lily was born. Before long, he’d been spending as much time with Draco and Scorpius as he was with his own kids. Draco had never talked much about his relationship with Astoria, and the few times Harry had seen her, she’d barely looked at Draco or her son. No one was all that surprised when she left, but it opened up a lot of options. When Harry had gotten home after that night at Diagon, Draco had practically thrown himself into his arms with a flurry of yeses. Which is how they ended up, for all intensive purposes, married. Draco was still married to Astoria, mainly because they couldn’t find the bint to get her to sign some divorce papers, but that life hardly seemed real, to anyone. Even Ron referred to Draco as Harry’s husband these days. It was their life, their home, their children… and their secrets. Which was why Draco never came to London.
“What do you recommend? I date my way through Hogwarts to see if anything sticks?” Draco wouldn’t lie, the idea that Harry was trying to convince him to go around dating anyone and everyone stung a bit. It stung enough to make Draco cough up two more flowers. Harry rubbed his back until the fit stopped.
Harry’s expression made clear he found everything about this disturbing verging on horrifying. Draco understood better than Harry why this was a sensitive area, but he’d come to the conclusion that there would be nothing to hold them together, shagging aside, if either of them had to pretend to be someone they weren’t.
“Don’t be mental,” he snapped out. “That only child comes with two Borgia parents, and I doubt Princess Hufflepuff there is up to manipulating them into accepting a galleon-digging suitor.  I like my entrails where they are, thank you very much.”
Draco would have supposed his presence there would put a chill on the proceedings, but no. They all seemed thrilled to have him there, commenting favorably on his resemblance to their idol, though no one mentioned the Veela power which he attributed to Luna’s tact. Draco was mostly a spectator on the activities, but when pressed by Lucy Borgia, exerted himself to offer a suggestion on how Fury might escape the clutches of the evil Mercury, a vengeful former bandmate, who’d kidnapped their hero and imprisoned him in his Dungeon in the Muscovy Steppes.  He was then subjected to a full minute of nerve-shredding shrieks of approval.
year. To Draco it made perfect sense. From the moment Potter entered the wizarding world, his entire life was dominated by this life-and-death quest to fight the most powerful dark wizard in history. He’d had no say at all in whether to embark, his most trusted mentors had manipulated and deceived him to ensure he carried out their plans. Granger and Weasley had chosen to join that fight; Potter had been dragooned. And now he was being asked to sign on to devote the rest of his bloody life to being their hero.
Draco was aware that with students in any other Hogwarts house there would have been questions and handwringing requiring tedious assurances that
When Harry looked up, there was an emotion Draco had never seen on him, never even imagined Potter might experience. “Why…” his voice broke. Merlin, he was sobbing. “That fucking
He assumed that the Room of Requirement had included some protections against errant—or deliberate—spells, especially in its incarnation as a space for Slytherins to train.
Just as well the Slytherin underclassmen started filing in. When they took in who their instructors were, there was a general murmur of protest, and Marcus of course snapped out, “What’s he doing here? The deal was for you to teach us, not Boy Wonder.”
“Harry!” Luna said more sharply than he’d ever heard her. She pushed between him and Potter. “This is my friend—my girlfriend, Lucy—she’s wanted to meet you.”
Blaise took in Draco’s expression and burst out laughing. “Apparently not! That good, is he? Well, well, our boy wonder has some hidden talents.”
“Oh, are you showing your friends your Veela side?” Luna, just in time to cause yet more unintentional mayhem. “Isn’t it beautiful,” she sighed. “Oh, hi Harry.”
Blaise didn’t even know the half of it. Harry Potter beginning a “homosexual relationship” with Draco Malfoy would cause an uproar no matter what, but add in Draco’s new Veela power and they were looking at a national crisis.
Now that the intolerable MYSTERY of the Moonriders club was solved, Draco assumed Potter would fuck off the moment club hours ended, especially since it was almost time for dinner. But no, after the senior members gathered to set the room to rights after everyone else left, Potter lurked to the side, no doubt waiting for Luna so he could protect her from any evil plots Draco might get up during the walk to the Great Hall.
“I know. It doesn’t have to be today. Just when I ask for something different, that I want, I want to trust that you’ll be willing to explore that too.”
“I’ll tell you, but I need a favor.” Unsurprisingly, both Pansy and Blaise were immediately alert. Requests and exchanges of favors between Slytherins were governed by a legion of complex rules dating back to the House’s founding—which was why it was always a bad idea for non-Slytherins to get embroiled in these bargains—unless of course your name was Luna Lovegood. The word “favor” itself was never mentioned for anything but significant, high-value transactions. All thought of Potter was immediately forgotten, as Pansy and Blaise each began a mental review of Draco’s most prized possessions, to decide which they wanted to play for. Draco settled in for what would clearly be lengthy and
He came—he must have—but what Draco really felt was how Harry gathered him into his arms, and up onto the sofa just to hold him.  He leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder, wondering how this had moved so fast, how it could feel so set, so permanent.  Draco thought again of the word belonging.
“Fucking prat.” Draco shoved him off his lap, and Potter had to fumble to avoid landing on the floor. As Potter sat up on the sofa, Draco slid down onto his knees in front of him.
Once everyone was present, he said, “I’ll see ensembles, now—you have five minutes.” Boys and girls scurried to their respective dorm rooms. Draco strode to his own room to review his options, though he very much doubted that his ability to make exquisitely fined-tuned wardrobe choices would improve his chances of impressing the Borgias.
But it seemed orgasm did not leave Potter similarly mellow. That would take getting used to should they ever repeat this. But as Draco watched him, he realized this went beyond not being mellow. Potter was still seething with energy—energy and intent. Was he going to explode with rage now? With regrets? Draco found the idea more annoying than upsetting: after all this was Potter. He’d not be surprised if all sorts of nonsensical Gryffindor tripe was filling his head. But then Potter turned on him and said, “Go ahead and cast it.”
“You will indeed. Did you think you could hide something like this from me? You’ve accessed your Veela heritage—don’t even consider trying to lie to me.”
More giggling—because the concept of falling for him was so very droll.  “Draco, Veela power can’t change someone’s sexuality. Surely you know that.”
“What have I been thinking?” Potter said, voice velvet. “I have been thinking about vanishing your clothes, and then having you bend over and hold yourself open for me.”
And yet he’d somehow molded that group of losers into a force capable of contending with the Carrows, who rivaled his aunt for psychotic sadism.  And that last part they’d done without the help of the golden trio (and let’s be real, golden
“Of course I know that.” At least… he did now.  But that would mean… “So you--both—prefer… women?  But what about… Fury Moonrider?” He shuddered privately at hearing that idiotic name come from his lips.
“Sofa,” Potter ordered to the room. The red and gold sofa obediently appeared. Potter knee-walked them over to the edge. “
Slytherin was another matter. The House was in chaos—no other word would do. The Underclassmen were being mercilessly bullied, and the older students who should step in were playing dumb, too selfish or lazy to protect their own House. Admittedly the House was greatly weakened, but that just meant they needed to stand together.
.” In retrospect, he couldn’t be surprised that at the next meeting of Moonriders, who should he see but fucking Potter enter with Luna.
The relief on Potter’s face confirmed a few theories Draco had formed about what was happening with him right now. And from the tone, it wasn’t just Draco who was doomed.
When she turned around Potter had his wand in hand and was shaking with rage, like he wanted to be sure the Slytherins knew exactly how to provoke him.
Once Draco was confident that his housemates would not wound his fellow Moonriders with any show of disdain for their idol, he was able to apply himself fully to the brainstorming session taking place on the scene where Mercury drives the heroes apart by revealing Fury’s Veela heritage to Bez.
Blaise just scoffed. “Ludicrous or not: A word of warning on that one. Mother told me in case I got ideas myself of solving some of our problems that way. She knew his father, James, and the Potters have wolf blood somewhere in the family tree. They tend to be possessive.”
Against his will, he got caught up in the story they were working on, and found himself arguing that they develop Mercury into a more intriguing villain, with a full backstory and complicated love/hate for Fury, and deliciously spiteful and clever instead of the usual blustering brute out for world domination.
“I think she’s thirteen!” Duessa and Draco couldn’t help sharing a look. “Wait a minute,” Harry demanded. “Have you been pushing her towards me?”
Potter barely took his eyes off Draco as he absently responded to Lucy’s enthusiastic welcome. Draco felt a momentary panic that the news would finally spread that he was Vice President of the Fury Moonrider fan club. But then he took in the expressions of the Slytherins. They tried to hide it with defiance, but it was easy for him to tell that every last one of them—even fucking Marcus—was crushed. They all took for granted that Potter’s arrival meant they were about to be ejected—returned to the state where no one at school would speak to them, where they were at the mercy of a vindictive mob.
“I’m done hiding in here. This news is valuable for precisely two more hours: the moment we enter the Great Hall it will become worthless. Right now it’s currency, and I’m going to find a way to spend it.”
Draco had no doubt they all would regret it. Harry going to war with the Ministry over Draco was hardly a more attractive prospect than Draco being locked up in Azkaban. Literally everyone would lose: Draco and his mother, followed by the Slytherins; Harry’s friends and the Weasley family, not that Draco cared particularly about that. But to have that kind of split in the aftermath of such a brutal and destructive war, would be catastrophic for their whole society.
Of course a glance at Potter was all she needed to know exactly where to hit. Her movements turned sultry and she sidled up to Draco, taking his cheeks in her hands. “I can think of a few ways,” she murmured into his ear.
Duessa Borgia whispered something to one of her entourage and then gestured to Harry and Draco to enter the main room of the Three Broomsticks. Draco had no idea what this could be about, but wouldn’t be surprised if they were about to face a dozen Aurors. He quietly extended his
and then debating their merits, creating scrapbooks filled with photos of Fury, drawing original images of Fury, and commencing work on a fictional saga involving Fury and his supposed nemesis, Bez, lead singer of the werewolf band,
“Don’t what?—Draco!” Potter said sharply, right into his ear. “You need to tell me—what are you feeling?”
. Your choice. I would be happy to meet with anyone if it would be helpful, but I will require a letter.”
an excruciating phrase—but it wasn’t quite enough to eradicate the (slight!) shudder he felt at the concept of a ‘possessive Potter,’ whatever that meant.
But even setting aside such moral niceties, pragmatically if Slytherin retaliated they’d only be injuring themselves, delaying any chance of restoring their reputations, for themselves and likely their families as well. No one in the Wizarding world was inclined to give Slytherins the benefit of the doubt.
He walked blindly until he reached the Slytherin dungeons.  It was still club hours and his dorm room was empty. He ripped back the curtains to his bed, just in time to pull out his cock and bring himself to a quick and filthy climax.  How on earth was this is life?
The words perfectly targeted Potter’s Gryffindor pride and his face went red. Draco wondered for the hundredth time how Potter had managed to defeat the Death Eaters so thoroughly when he insisted on revealing his every weakness to all and sundry.
The whole thing made him wish that he’d made more effort—really at any point in the past 8 years—to be less of a complete twat to Granger. He suspected she could solve this problem if she could only be set loose to do so, but instead she’d be heading up the mob calling for his head.
Those were his closest friends—what the rest of Slytherin would say, let alone Gryffindor, was fuel for an entire new genre of nightmares, these destined to come true, since he could hardly expect to keep his attendance at the meetings secret forever. But it seemed he was trapped on the course he’d set—rather like a car at Gringotts there was no getting off until he’d reached his destination.
would be hitting the stands any moment now. They were looking at an explosion of attention and scrutiny. They could either control the story or be the victims of it.
“Duessa, please. For going public with your relationship, of course. You’ve truly not a moment to spare if you’re going to control this narrative.”
“Well, they’re not my friends, precisely; I was trying to help them with something, and in return I asked them to come to the club.” Draco wasn’t sure why he felt obliged to have that out in the open, but he did.
Thankfully, Cho spoke before Harry could think of a suitably diplomatic response. "Liam, it is good news. It means that Niall is alive and as long as we comply with Greyback's demands, then you'll have him back again."
When Wells-Barton was out of earshot, Potter leaned close enough that Draco could feel his warmth. Merlin, it was a rather cold day; he hadn't noticed until the urge to cosy up to Potter's side became overwhelming.
Draco's hand explored the velvety hardness, drawing a trembling shudder from Potter. Draco's smile widened and Potter dragged him down into another kiss.
Draco's breath reeked of alcohol, however, and he seemed unsteady, swaying in place. In a swift movement that made Harry emit a startled squawk, Draco shifted Harry so that his wings were trapped beneath Draco's arm, clutched tightly against his ribcage. A leather hood was quickly tugged over Harry's head, blinding him. The human side of him felt instantly alarmed while the falcon portion went docile. It was a curious internal battle.
Before Shacklebolt could ask, Draco held up a hand. "Since I am currently under the influence of Veritaserum, you might ask me any number of questions and I might spill all sorts of valuable information right now, but it will be grudgingly given and I will do my damnedest to thwart such an attempt. I leave it to you to decide whether it will be wiser to extract what I know in dribs and drabs by drugging me and asking random questions for hours while I attempt to prevaricate as best I can—and believe me,
Zabini laughed, drowning Parkinson's protest.  "She's right, Pansy.  Give it a rest.  You seem to be the only one wanting to get a look at Potter's prick, so perhaps you should tell us why, yes?"
Harry dropped steadily at a quick rate, eyes scanning for the nearest place for them to land that would be safe from Muggle eyes. He heard Rocco cast a Notice-Me-Not Charm as they descended. Harry spotted the flat roof of a tall building and headed that way.
The Super Auror was, unsurprisingly, at a loss for words. Potter struggled to speak until Draco silenced him with a kiss. He was pleased when Potter did not resist, but only disentangled his hands—finally—from Draco's hair, only to wrap them around his shoulders.
"As far as the eye can see," Malfoy said. "Will you carry Ayah? She doesn't like Gavin, and I usually have to make two trips. In fact, she doesn't much like anyone, so take care she doesn't nip you."
Harry solemnly promised to do so and then abandoned Anders for the stairs and a quick trip to the Healer for his exponentially worse headache. It lessened to more bearable levels as he hurried to the indicated training room where the others had already gathered. Harry nodded at them collectively and only allowed his gaze to skim over Draco before he emitted a forced, "Good morning."
"That, too," Harry admitted and studiously avoided looking at the arse in question. "But I do know you."
With a puzzled look that became genuine when he realized there were no albino peacocks about, nor any birds at all, Harry continued up the walk and stopped at the base of the broad stone steps. He merely needed to walk up a few stairs and knock on the door. It was a simple matter.
He seemed to regard a trip to Malfoy Manor as just barely preferable to a jaunt to the ninth circle of hell for a bit of sadistic torture. Harry suggested that Ron could return home while Hermione accompanied them to Draco's home alone, but Ron shook his head.
! Harry, how could you?" Ron snatched up the glittering green Snitch. It wasn't an official game-winning Snitch, of course, since the Cannons hadn't won a game since the dawn of time, but Ron treasured the commemorative item. He clutched it to his chest and glared at Harry.
"Harry, why are you staring at Malfoy? Did he do something? You look like you want to kill him." Luna's voice was mild, as it always was, and Harry forced himself to look away from his tormentor. Luna had taken to sitting with various friends during meals instead of sticking with the Ravenclaws, a habit that had been mirrored by many others. Harry sometimes thought about sitting with the Slytherins...
… Harry’s face flamed and he quickly tore off his trousers and pants before sliding on the bit of silk. It was far more erotic than he had expected.
Malfoy turned and walked inside. Harry followed and shut the door behind them. He only watched Malfoy's arse for a moment-clad in slate-green trousers that displayed it
"Would you like some tea?" Eddie asked Zabini as his hands slipped out of Harry's grasp. His tone was polite and no longer antagonistic.
Draco's wand tip pressed against Eddie's chin and dug in. "Think carefully before replying. Harry doesn't know why, but I do. And if you lie, I will make you wish you had died at Rosier's hand."
"We should take the stairs. Hopefully they don't know the full layout and won't be expecting anyone from that quarter. It's a bit of a walk, but better down than up. I'll disable this to keep them from sneaking past us, operating on the assumption they're still below and haven't snatched Draco and departed already.
The door opened with what seemed infinite slowness. Harry risked a quick glance to see a tall, steel-haired witch standing with the door ajar. "Ms Chang, dearie! What brings you here? Is everything all right with Liam?"
"Mr Potter, you are not trying to steal my paramour, are you?" Roderick dropped a possessive hand upon Draco's shoulder. "Also, Draco, your friend Blaise has arrived with that
They dressed quickly and returned to the clearing where Draco had nearly been killed. The rain was pouring as though released from floodgates, but Maeve was gone.
Eddie scraped the bottom of the pan so hard that a glop of half-cooked egg flipped out of the pan and sizzled on the cooker. "No, of course I don't. I am fairly certain that I don't even rate a mention on the Harry Potter Scale of Vital Importance. I'm starting to believe I'm lower than 'disposing of the rubbish' or 'scrubbing the fireplace'."
"Sorry. Red light. I would've run it but for the bobby over there." The driver gestured towards a police vehicle entering the intersection.
"You won't be able to get in, anyway. The Floo is closed to all but a few people and the wards won't let you in."
Before Potter could get too aggressive after Draco's challenge, Draco pushed him back onto the bed, breaking the kiss. "Lube?"
They headed for Ottery St Catchpole later that afternoon. It was fairly close to Malfoy Manor and they encountered nothing threatening on the way. The house was larger than Draco had expected, but exactly as quaint as predicted. It did have a low stone wall rather than a white picket fence, but it was appropriately festooned with a multitude of flowers in happy colors.
"You say that like Tremmy had some to start with." Marcy laughed and Tremaine scowled. He hated that bloody nickname. He was not overly fond of Marcy, either, but she was Angelique's friend and needed to be tolerated.
"Over here," she called from round the other side of the furniture/book tower. A three-foot walkway allowed him to pass between the stacked material and the wall. He found Hermione on her knees, wand in hand, trying to coax old wallpaper from the wall with a delicate spell. Her hair had been pulled back into a horse's tail and she wore an oversized t-shirt and jeans.
"Draco was good enough to bring you here, as instructed. Now he only need perform one more task in order to win his prize, right Pansy?"
Draco crossed his arms with a huff and allowed his brows to draw down in a thunderous scowl. "Honestly, why am I always the bad guy? As much as I would like to lay claim to every misdeed in the world, I am afraid there will always be more than enough evildoers to go round. I still say they eloped. The homophobes are generally hiding their terrifying love for cock, don't you know?"
to cancel the body bind. Finnigan sat up and struggled against his bonds, glaring at Draco through angry eyes. To his credit, he did not demand to know his intentions; he simply waited.
Harry returned the files, signed out for the day and Apparated to Malfoy Manor. The gates opened for him immediately, which was unexpected. He had thought it might take some tricky manoeuvring to gain access this time. Rain dribbled down as he walked and became a true downpour by the time he reached the front steps. Malfoy stood in the open doorway. He looked anything but welcoming.
Draco's eyes fixed on Harry as he walked into the room with his usual unconscious grace. His black hair was awry—no doubt he had been tearing at it in frustration over Weasley's condition. Draco smiled and his heart did a slow roll of pure pleasure.
The arrival of his former arch-nemesis was unexpected, to say the least. As far as Draco could recall, it had been three years since he'd last seen the Icon of Purity and Perfection.
Draco nearly shivered when he thought of the potential there. Potter was… well, he was damnably attractive, and powerful, and rich, and socially perfect, but then there was Mark, who was also damnably attractive, possibly powerful, and rich, and socially acceptable, and… well, Draco was relaxed and comfortable with him and he simply
to awaken them and then shot into the sky before they began to stir. It was far too cold to leave them sleeping on the icy roof.
Got a royal reaming today from the head of DMLE for not solving the case after an entire month. I'd like to see him step away from the food trolley long enough to go out into the field and catch the culprits. Ron calls him Fore-Head thanks to his enormous forehead and receding hairline. Malfoy heard him mutter the nickname during the meeting and said, "I believe that's a five-head, Weasley" and Ron's eyes popped out just before he got it and nearly choked to death on a laughing fit. Got sent from the room to down a glass of water and I barely kept a straight face. Didn't dare look at Malfoy.
The downpour had ceased as quickly as it had begun; by the time Harry had exited the house, it had turned into a random scattering of droplets that now shone from every surface. Harry wondered what Narcissa's garden would look like and imagined raindrops clinging to each rosebud. Would Malfoy appreciate such a thing, or was he currently cursing Harry's name and hexing house-elves. Harry knew he should go back and apologize, but swallowing his pride enough to do so would be difficult at the moment. Still, he wondered if the aborted attempt at training had upset Malfoy. With a quick stare up and down the lane to ensure there were no watchers, Harry cast a careful spell and felt his body melt away.
Though he felt the knife in his heart twist with every rise and fall of Draco's chest, Harry sat and watched him sleep until the shadows in the room lengthened and the fire burned itself out.
Harry nodded. Since the war, public owls had been marked so that they could be tracked back to their places of origin, mostly due to an increase in death-threats and hate mail sent by the pro-Voldemort contingent. The general public knew about the new regulation, but it was possible that Greyback had missed that legislation whilst incarcerated.
Mulciber laughed, an irritating, slightly insane-sounding titter. "Oh yes, I have, haven't I? And you know why, don't you, Draco? Don't you
Draco couldn't breathe through the sudden rush of yearning evoked by Potter's words. He turned his head to say—
I'm an idiot. I need to apologise to Malfoy and make amends somehow. Jacob fixed my arm up and I remembered what a nice fellow he is, so caring and helpful. It's no wonder Malfoy fell for him, and I'm a stupid arse for not being a supportive friend. When I asked Jacob how Malfoy was, he seemed surprised and asked "Don't you know?" which made me feel like a heel. I'm the one who ended our friendship out of jealousy, and Malfoy doesn't even know why.
"But you lived it. You lived it all, like the book says, and that's what I plan to do. You're an inspiration, Mister Potter--I mean, Mister Black."
The Atrium was not particularly busy when they Flooed to the Ministry. It was a Thursday morning and they had arrived during the slow period between the morning rush of arrivals and the noon crowd escaping for lunch. Draco followed Harry as he bypassed the reception desk with a nod and a tip of his imaginary hat towards the woman seated there. She gave him an indulgent smile and ignored Draco completely.
Suddenly Draco’s eyes lit up, furious, and he whipped out his wand. “Look, then. Look and tell me how I’m supposed to sit down with my son and tell him what I did.” He pointed the wand to his temple and shut his eyes, murmuring a spell under his breath that Harry didn’t quite catch. The purpose of it became clear, though, when images appeared in front of them, as if playing on a screen. And there was Voldemort, and he smiled wickedly. He was at the head of a long table, looking straight into the camera, as it were, or in this case, straight at Draco. The image faltered, fell to the surface of the table, where a pair of pale hands twitched around a familiar wand.
Draco’s head shot up at those last questions, and he couldn’t seem to shake his head hard enough to refute those claims so it wasn’t really any surprise when he found himself on his knees in front of his son, who was sat on the edge of his bed, frantically searching for a small hand to clutch at. “No, Scorpius, I could never, would never be sorry for having you, you’re the brightest part of my life. All you kids… I don’t deserve—”
“Still, I think it’s best we cover all our bases. Express ourselves every way we can. You know, to be sure the disease properly knows just how desperately I love you,” Harry said reasonably.
Scorpius sighed heavily and rolled his eyes, which Draco could tell were red. His heart ached so much he nearly missed Scorpius’ response.
Draco scrambled to his feet, nearly pushing Harry off the couch, and buried his face in his hands. “He gave it to Scor, didn’t he? Harry, did he see… did he see everything?”
The image swirled and a battle field was revealed through two rectangles, and they moved against the view from Draco’s eyes and Harry knew that this was the inside of a Death Eater mask, and he could see Draco’s wand arm raise, shaking slightly, towards a man who was screaming at two young boys to run, just run, and then there was Draco’s voice.
Draco looked up, then, and he seemed to be debating with himself how to take that. Finally he said, “Why?”
Malfoy growled and bit Harry’s earlobe. He tugged on it meanly, but hissed through his teeth, “Please, Scarhead. I need your pretty little lips on my cock.”
“Never told you everything. There’s so much that I did… I can’t even bring myself to think about it. I still have nightmares, when you’re not here. It’s been nearly twenty years, Harry, and I still have nightmares.”
“Shut it,” Draco grumbled. Suddenly he was being dragged back and shoved up against the wall, where Harry promptly and thoroughly snogged the life out of him.
Harry shook himself out of his thoughts and realized he had been about to walk right by Potage’s Cauldron Shop. He smiled at Lily and ran his hand over her hair as he redirected his steps and went into the shop.
“What do you mean ‘clean up’?” Harry asked, turning to watch the blond. And when Draco walked up to a fully intact set of mirrors to arrange his hair, which didn’t contain a speck of the earlier debris, Harry got it. He looked around the room. Everything looked as it had when he’d entered. As if their fight had never happened. “Oh.”
The girl’s body hit the table hard, and her head lolled to the side and looked right at Draco. He turned away.
“Merlin, you’re so tight,” Harry moaned. He rocked himself deeper. Malfoy was clawing at Harry’s back, his fingernails bringing a sharp sting, like shooting stars, to his skin. Harry kept rocking in deeper until he bottomed out, and Malfoy’s arse was flush against Harry’s hips. Malfoy was panting like a wounded animal. “Are you alright?” Harry asked.
There was a loud crash that startled both men, followed by a thud, and they looked up to see a vase in the corner laying in pieces on the floor.
Harry heard his name, he supposed, but he heard it more physically than with his ears. It wasn’t quite so much a name as it was a gas pedal, and Harry obliged Malfoy in his request to move. Harry moved as if it was his very last chance. He withdrew nearly all the way, only to slam back into Malfoy’s tight channel, and Malfoy’s head was buried in his shoulder, his arms wrapped tight around Harry’s back, so they weren’t so much against the wall, now, as Malfoy was clinging to Harry as if his life depended on it, moaning like a wanton whore. Harry lifted a hand to Malfoy’s head, threaded his fingers through his hair, held the other boy’s head to his shoulder in an oddly tender position, and suddenly Malfoy had latched on to Harry’s earlobe again and his moans had turned to murmurs.
“Did you see that?” he asked. “Merlin. You’re incredible.” Almost before he’d said it, Draco scowled, as if to say that was meant to be an insult, and Harry had better take it as such. But Harry just laughed.
Harry bit down on Malfoy’s lower lip, hard, and a metallic taste fluttered across his tongue as Malfoy moaned, his tongue finally wrestling Harry’s into submission and then stroking the roof of his mouth, just behind his teeth, in a way that sent shivers down Harry’s back. He tilted his head back with a gasp, and Malfoy took that as an invitation to latch himself onto Harry’s neck, where he nipped and sucked until Harry gasped, seeing stars, and then he bit hard on that particular spot. Harry dug his fingers into Malfoy’s back, clutching at him and pressing his own body into the Slytherin’s. He forced his thoughts together long enough to force Malfoy back onto his back, but the Slytherin looked like he didn’t have any protest to the new position, not even after Harry had ripped his shirt open, popping all the buttons off, though he did raise an eyebrow, as if to say, “Now, was that really necessary?”
“It was bad times, Draco. It was a war, there was a mad man threatening you and your family. You didn’t want to do those things, you obviously suffered plenty yourself, and you’ve tried so hard to make up for it since then. Draco… I’m proud of you. Once he has a chance to think about it, he will be, too. And he knows, if nothing else, that you love him.” Harry took Draco’s face in his hands and pressed a long kiss to his lips. “Now go on.”
He half expected Malfoy to hit him with some barb about Ron and Hermione, but none came. He was steadfastly avoiding Harry’s gaze. So Harry prodded him a bit, rocking so the tip of his cock brushed over Malfoy’s arse. “Why hide it?”
And Fenir laughed as his hand worked somewhere off screen. Harry felt sick and clutched Draco closer to his side, but Draco shied away from the touch and the image was swirling again, this time to a scene Harry remembered all too well himself. The Battle of Hogwarts. And there was Draco, casting spells Harry didn’t recognize, and he saw Lavender Brown stumble to avoid one, hit her head, and then Greyback was on her. He saw something explode, and Fred diving out of the way. He saw Draco point his wand at him, at Harry, and then slowly raise it to his own head.
Nevertheless, that’s where they were. Even in the last hour he’d managed to collect a bouquet of daisies, which was resting between his and Harry’s elbows as they read.
Draco sighed, but forced a smile. He reached out and grabbed the still-bouncing Albus around the middle, lightly tickling the boy’s sides. “Then I suppose I’d better punish you for bouncing on the bed, shouldn’t I?” he teased, increasing his tickling efforts and grinning as his son collapsed into giggles on his lap. He reached out and hauled Scorpius into the heap, laughing himself as Harry joined in with the tickle attack. When James ran into the room, shouting “Geronimo” as he leapt onto the bed with them, and Lily followed, whinging about being left out until Draco hauled her into the pile and she snuggled into his chest, the family settled into a tight mesh of contentment, snuggled together on Scorpius’ bed. Draco looked over them all, and met Harry’s cheerfully sparkling eyes.
“Please don’t,” Draco said feelingly. “Else he’ll be insufferable the rest of the trip.  He’ll spill either way.”
“I have no idea!” Draco snapped, pushing him back. “I can feel the pings against the shield all day.”
“Of course, Luna,” he said, murmuring “I’m glad you’re my friend,” as she skipped off hand in hand with Lucy.
A bizarre idea took hold. It was beyond daft, likely unworkable, but he found that once his brain had seized on it, it wouldn’t let go.
In answer Harry rolled on top of him and started kissing him deeply, thrusting his hard cock against Draco’s. Draco kissed him back, groaning as Harry reached his hand down and rubbed his cock. A minute later, Harry was inside of him, thrusting savagely as if he knew something was ending.
Harry sounded genuinely shocked that anyone could think otherwise of Lucy Borgia. Draco felt rather sheepish that he’d not quite noticed something that in retrospect appeared rather obvious. Duessa Borgia was blinking, the only sign that she was utterly flummoxed by this characterization of her daughter.
Draco couldn’t remember when he’d felt this angry. Unfortunately, that was when he realized that there was a blue glow bathing the entire corner of the room. Fuck—he’d activated his power without even realizing. Potter’s nostrils flared and he moved even closer. “What are you doing to me?” he growled.
The shaking had quieted to the occasional shuddery gasp. “I’m not one of your rescues,” Draco said quietly. “We need to have that clear if this is going to go further.”
More disturbing was seeing a second-year Slytherin go down with a knockback jinx, apparently cast by a group of older Hufflepuffs. It was a bad sign. He doubted any student could get through Draco’s own protection spells--except for Potter that is, and perhaps Granger, and to his knowledge Saint Potter had never hexed a student, probably never used magic against anyone that was not in self-defense.  But if the other houses were attacking vulnerable Slytherins, Draco’s chances of regaining any ground with his housemates would plunge into negative territory.
He was glad to see Pansy animated again, though he did wonder that both of them were so focused on regaining their ground in Slytherin. There were four houses at Hogwarts after all. But more than the other three, Slytherins kept to themselves—even setting aside the ‘late unpleasantness.’ Draco had always believed it came down to the Slytherin preoccupation with blood purity, but now that he’d been violently disillusioned from that cult, he could see how fixation on magical blood could serve as a convenient excuse for failing to solve the problem of actually dealing with the other houses.
Draco threw his hands up. “Heaven forfend,” which Potter thought hilarious. He was still laughing as they entered the Great Hall, like he and Draco were the best of mates.
Draco looked back at his hand, and slowly, haltingly, he took it. They shook once, and then stood there, staring at their joined hands. Harry was the one to let go, but he smiled reassuringly at Draco. They dressed in silence, passing clothes without really looking at each other. As they headed for the door, Draco said. “You know, I wouldn’t mind doing this again either.”
“Well,” he said, grabbing Harry’s hand, “Come along, you draft prat. Let’s go ask Pomfrey if you’ve cured me.”
“Just keep it to a minimum,” Harry shouted after him as the thirteen-year-old shot through the crowd. He groaned inwardly, sure there would be a pile worth at least fifty galleons waiting for him when he finally caught up.
“No, we haven’t, but if I’m flower-free I intend to drag you to the room of requirement and have my way with you until dawn tomorrow.”
The scowl turned into a feral, appreciative grin. “Careful about making promises you can’t keep, Potter.”
Scorpius’ face fell, and he looked so heartbroken that Harry felt he had to say something if he didn’t want the boy to be downtrodden the rest of the day. “I dunno, Scor, maybe. I’ll talk to him about it, alright? Come here. What do you and Al still need?” Harry looked up then, realizing the usually unstoppable chatter of his other son had been missing from the conversation. “Scor, where’s Al?”
“It’s just… I realized we hadn’t locked the door. Anyone could come in, and look at this place. Salazar, look at us,” Malfoy groaned, but this groan was one of displeasure, and he raised a hand to run anxiously down his face. “We really can’t be…”
Harry wasn’t sure what he’d been expecting, but Draco Malfoy crying had been the furthest from whatever that was. And he wasn’t really surprised when Malfoy responded by trying to curse him. He supposed, had he been in Malfoy’s position, he wouldn’t be keen to show his enemy weakness, either. Nevertheless, he thought as he logrolled out of the way of another curse and fired off another of his own without really thinking about it, this was getting out of hand. The bathroom was being destroyed around them, bits of debris kept pelting him from all angles and a layer of dust covered the floor, mixing with the water now spraying from several different leaks to create a cakey mixture that was slowly covering his entire person. Harry sprung to his feet, ducked behind a stall, and darted out to try to get closer to Malfoy and take him by surprise, but the blond git was closer than he realized, and Harry stumbled as he tried to redirect himself. Malfoy snarled and shouted, “Cruc—“
“For Merlin’s sake, Dad, you don’t get it. You didn’t do this for me. You did this because you were scared. You did it for you. Admit it.”
“Yeah. I saw a terrified teenager doing some really awful stuff and being tormented by the people telling him to do it. In case you haven’t noticed, it doesn’t seem to have effected me the last eleven years, why should it now?”
"He asked for you specifically. Says you’re the only one he trusts. That sounds like a load of malarkey to me, but whatever. The Veritaserum's worn off by now. Pity, that. Now we won't know if half what he's saying is true, but Kingsley insists on doing this by the book, especially after my little fuck-up, although I only dosed him because it was Quartermain's idea. Did you know Marcus Flint is a barrister?" Ron shook his head. "Wouldn't even have thought that one could read."
Harry did not see Draco reach his destination because he threw himself forward in sudden determination. He might allow Draco to sacrifice himself, but he'd be damned if he'd let him do it alone. They crossed the glowing barrier at the same moment.
I made it to Day 21 yesterday! It's officially a habit, so I don't have to write every day anymore! Not much happened today anyway. Didn't see Malfoy, thank Merlin.
Draco unwillingly opened his eyes again and blinked to focus against the pain. He was sorry when his gaze locked onto the angry visage of the man who stood over him.
They still had no idea how Rosier planned to infiltrate the place, which had been heavily warded and was now being patrolled by private security guards—hired by Harry—and undercover Hit Wizards—assigned by Kingsley.
"You can't go alone! And at night? It's too dangerous," Harry said and pushed away from the doorway of Draco's room. He watched Draco carefully pack his sunglasses into a protective pouch and fold the two shirts Harry had bought for him.
"This is not about your ego. How did you escape Crabbe? And why do I even bother with wards if you and Parkinson can slide through them without a by-your-leave… Never mind. You look like shite. Let's get you upstairs. I have potions."
She nodded. "Yeah. I'm from Maryland. Got a job with the Department of International Magical Cooperation at your Ministry of Magic. I don't really know anyone yet, so I thought I'd take a class." She held up her camera and waggled it. It was black and sleek and looked far more modern than Harry's.
Harry made the typical throat-clearing noise reserved for such circumstances and two angry stares snapped up to view him on the staircase. He continued down until he stood on the second to last step.
"Are you always this insatiable? Never mind, I am not complaining. I'll hurry back. Don't start without me."
"Merlin," Harry said with a groan as the exquisite flavours flooded over his tongue. The citrusy taste of fresh lime mingled with the sweetness of the milk chocolate. He shut his eyes and savoured it, allowing the confection to melt completely before he swallowed. He opened his eyes to find Malfoy watching him with mouth slightly agape and one brow lifted. "You're right, Malfoy. I think they're poisoned. I should probably take these with me for proper testing."
Draco had been reluctantly impressed with Potter's ability to manoeuvre the Muggle scooter through traffic. And although he wouldn't admit it under torture, he had not at all minded the feel of Potter's thighs against his, and the fact that Potter's arse was a thing of beauty when nestled into the V of his crotch.
"Not really. Theo was in town and that's rare enough now that we tend to go out whenever he shows up. Astoria insisted on tagging along and she carries quite an annoying torch for me. I have to prove to her time and again that I am unrelentingly gay."
"Because I've already done that. It leads nowhere. The only way to find Greyback is by getting to his victim before he does. If you waste precious time backtracking will-o-wisps, you will fail."
“Don’t come, Potter,” Draco warned.  He regretfully left off teasing Potter’s hole.  Strangely, he wanted nothing more than to lick and stab and
Draco groaned aloud at the fabulous massage. He hadn't realized how brutal walking barefoot had been until Harry started working out the kinks. His fingers slid gently between Draco's toes, rubbing each one in turn before kneading the ball of his foot with stiffened thumbs.
Malfoy sniffed and raised his wand. This time Harry tried to pay attention to his movements, to act like a teacher instead of an irritated schoolboy. A larger silver burst followed and Harry gnawed his lip for a moment before he stepped closer to Malfoy. "Okay, try this. Your wand movements are a bit stiff. Let me…" Screwing up his courage, Harry moved behind Malfoy, and then reached over his shoulder to grasp his wrist. His chest pressed against Malfoy's stone-stiff back and for a moment Harry feared Malfoy would elbow him in the ribs—or worse.
Harry followed him inside and Malfoy placed the tote on the small table before gesturing towards the cupboards. "Make tea?"
Harry turned so he could look up at his husband. The pale cheeks looked deathly white, even for Draco, and they were sparkling with quiet tears. The kind of tears that couldn’t be held in. Harry wiped them with his thumbs. “Draco, I know it was bad. I’m not saying it wasn’t. But he has to hear it from you.”
Malfoy moaned under his ministrations, and started thrusting his hips, but Harry put a quick stop to that, and Malfoy growled. “Because it’s a bloody curse. A curse on my home, on my family. A curse that my father passed to me and I don’t want it spoiling this.”
“That’s because I’ve only got eyes for you,” Harry retorted. Then he frowned. “Wait a mo. You thought I was straight?” His eyes widened. “Do you mean
“Tell me what you want,” Harry said, “I want to hear the Slytherin Prince begging me to get him off.”
For a moment, Harry remembered that there was a war on, and that Malfoy was one of the bad guys, and that they had been trying to kill each other not ten minutes ago, but he couldn’t think about that now. Not when Malfoy made such a nice picture over his lap. Though now that he had time to really look at him, and look at him naked, no less, or mostly naked, since the shirt that used to be a button-up was still hanging off one arm, Harry could tell that Malfoy was not well. He was covered in bruises and cuts, and though his muscles were well-defined, they didn’t fill him out, leaving him looking emaciated. Harry knew that he hadn’t been eating. He’d noticed as much, and the dark under his eyes, but to see him like this made it obvious that Malfoy was distressed.
