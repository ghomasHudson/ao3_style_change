Before Harry could scuttle away unseen, Malfoy and his eyes locked, and before he knew it, they were on their way over, Astoria waving kindly.
“No, thank you,” replied Malfoy. Nodding, Harry made himself a cup anyway, tapping the teapot with his wand to boil the water. He looked back over at Malfoy, who was staring at the fire that was lit. It illuminated his ghostly face, his white-blonde hair looking more yellow from the flames, his grey eyes warmer but still sad and lost looking. The same eyes that had stared at Dumbledore with the same sadness to them moments before his death.
dark artefacts behind my back?” Leaning forwards, Lucius hissed in Malfoy’s ear, just loud enough for everyone in the room to hear, “you’re keep secrets from us, my boy, and I will weed them out of you, no matter what it takes,” and then he sauntered off, cloak trailing wildly behind him. The doors slammed shut, echoing throughout the manor, making Malfoy jump.
“Is he here?” Harry heard as he groggily began to wake up. The voice was familiar, a soft female voice with an edge of concern.
He made his way back to his post, keeping hold of the jug in his hand in case a refill was needed. Harry had to keep an eye on all the glasses. As soon as a quarter was left, he had to be straight over there topping it up, even if they weren’t going to drink any more water.
Gently, he squeezed Harry’s hand, reminding him that he was there, he was safe.
“You too. You’re clear,” said Harry, motioning to Blaise.
“Harry!” Mrs Weasley called, running over to him with open arms. Hugging her plump frame, Harry chuckled as he buried his face into her shoulder. Mrs Weasley rocked him from side to side, squeezing him so tight it was as if she would never let him go.
But the moment was drastically cut short when the burrow’s fireplace suddenly lit up, and in entered a witch and a wizard.
Slowly, before their very eyes, the wand produced a silver light which danced around the darkness. The light started to transform. They watched as gradually an animal formed, and started to walk towards them, striding with confidence.
“This fucking hangover,” Harry spat into the toilet bowl, wiping his mouth with his sleeve.
“I deal with the behind the scenes work for father, and dealings with the manor,” explained Malfoy.
“And?” replied Draco, his voice hoarse but bold.
“The same as before,” he replied. He looked back at Harry, searching his face. The longer Malfoy looked at him, the more Harry felt his heart beating faster, and he eventually looked down at the table.
“But if his father found out-”
“Good to see you again.”
“Why does it matter what I’m wearing when I’m not on shift?”
“Better than the workhouses,” mentioned Mrs Weasley, popping the chopped carrots into the pot. She was right, but it was something everyone always said if Harry complained about working for the Malfoys. He felt very lucky he didn’t have to work in the workhouses, he thanked Ron and Hermione every day for managing to get him the job.
“That’s weird,” scoffed Malfoy, the heels of his shoes clicking on the marble floor. “Muggle fiction books are weird.”
“Won’t you get in trouble if your father finds out you didn’t hurt me?”
“How are things at the Malfoys Manor?” questioned Mrs Weasley as she stirred a pot of soup. Harry had always wondered why she didn’t use magic to cook. Mrs Weasley had always said that it was more fun to cook without magic, it made the food taste better apparently. Sometimes Harry thought it just gave her something to do, especially now. All her kids had moved out aside from George, who’d fallen into a depression after Fred’s death. Now he looked after the house with Mrs Weasley, while seeing a mind healer once a week. Some days Harry couldn’t even look at George, knowing he was the reason for Fred’s death. It pained him to see George alone.
“I’m not laundering money,” retorted Malfoy, the irritating dripping in his voice.
“What do you think?” Harry dared to ask.
“I’ve told you the reason,” said Harry, looking at Malfoy with a frown.
From time to time, Harry would look at Draco, who would be sitting across the room from him, the daily prophet in his hands, a frown furrowing his eyebrows in concentration as he read. The feelings Harry got when he had first realised he was in love with Draco Malfoy had never gone away, and every time he watched Draco, or heard his laugh, or heard him call Harry’s name, Harry’s heart would flutter, his palms would become clammy and his ears would burn from his blush.
“What did you hear?”
“I’m not, Potter. It’s nothing,” spat Malfoy, his eyes narrowed to a glare.
Harry expected ridicule. “Ha! Look! Potter is crying!” He expected Malfoy to say. “What a baby. What a wimp.”
“I’m glad it was fine, sir,” said Harry, fiddling with the button on the cuff of his shirt. “I was a bit worried.”
Once they had finished dinner, Harry found Hermione stood outside, watching the sunset. He had always thought she was beautiful, from the moment he met her when they were kids, to now. The gold light of the setting sun shone on her dark skin, making her look like an ethereal beauty.
“I’m fine, s-“
“What’s going on?” asked Ron, sitting down on the bed. “You can tell me anything, Georgie. You know that.”
They stood in the rain, just staring at each other, every now and then looking up at the sky to watch the flashes of light. Harry couldn’t help but watch Malfoy, he seemed so alive, so animated in the storm. His smile never faded, he even tried to catch droplets of rain on his tongue, he laughed and danced. The juxtaposition between this Malfoy, and the Malfoy who would stare straight forward when his own wife kissed him, who had no emotion in his voice, who no longer seemed to feel fear, or anything at that matter.
“Then you got off lucky. I can’t, Harry. I can’t do that.”
He made his way to the office, and just before he opened the door, he heard voices. Voices he didn’t recognise. Carefully he pressed his ear up to the door.
Malfoy stood up in fury, throwing the cloth across the room, making Harry jump. Pain shot through his ribs and he suppressed a groan.
“Hello, Mr Zabini,” greeted Harry.
“Yes,” said Malfoy sheepishly, looking down at his lap. Harry saw him start to pick at his knuckles, which were the worst they had been in a long time. Crouching in front of him, Harry placed his hand on top of Malfoy’s, getting him to stop.
Harry’s breath hitched in his throat. He couldn’t believe what Hermione was saying. He completed Draco? Not only that, Draco’s own wife believed this to be true. Harry could feel the tops of his ears burning. There was nothing more Harry wanted than to be with Draco right at that moment. To feel their hands intertwined, to feel the warmth of Draco’s breath on his neck. The warm, comforting embrace Draco would give him, even though his frame was so small it didn’t seem like hugging him would do anything. Draco’s hugs caused Harry great relief, relief from the monsters that resided daily in his mind.
After a few hours of Harry staying quiet with Narcissa, he decided to go and apologise before dinner.
“You’ve always been one to try and fix things, Harry,” she said. “Sometimes there are things you just can’t fix.”
After a while, Harry went over to the bar. He didn’t know how much Malfoy had drank, but he always thought Malfoy would be a lightweight.
“Malfoy?” asked Harry as he began to walk towards the slender figure.
“We understand,” smiled Hermione, standing up and giving Harry a big hug. Malfoy just watched, his fingers heading towards his knuckles and playing with the already bleeding skin. Hermione noticed. “Would you like something for your hands, Mr Malfoy?” She asked gently.
“Yeah, he was buying you drinks all night and you were elbowing each other, mate,” said Ron.
“Why did you bring me here, too?” asked Harry.
“Potter,” he nodded, “I need you to come with me.”
“What in Merlin’s beard do you do there?” asked George, looking back down at the chessboard to begin planning his next move.
“Sometimes I think the stars twinkle when they know I’m happy,” said Malfoy with a sigh. Harry didn’t respond, but he could feel his cheeks going red. Did Malfoy just admit to being happy with him?
As soon as the Malfoy’s sat, the butlers and maids swept into motion. As usual, Harry went round the table, pouring the water into the glasses, and made his way to Lucius. He swore as he poured the water, he could see the corner of Lucius’ mouth twitch, as if he had something on his mind he desperately wanted to get off, as if there was something that amused him. Attempting to ignore it, Harry moved to Malfoy, who just stared down at the table. Things seemed exactly how they were all those months ago, before Harry saved Malfoy, before everything between them had happened. It made Harry feel incredibly uneasy.
“Yes, sir?”
Maybe, thought Harry, trying for a child is what would bring them together again, and even that isn’t working.
for him. The shame Malfoy would feel if there was anything else to their relationship aside from Harry being his staff.
“This is ridiculous, your father is absolutely furious,” Astoria grabbed Malfoy from Harry’s grasp. Malfoy stumbled into her, groaning, and nuzzled his head into her shoulder sleepily.
“I know,” said Harry, causing Hermione to reach over the table and give his hand a smack.
“Are you drunk?” asked Astoria angrily.
Climbing on, Harry started to pull the rope that anchored it down on the docks, before setting sail. There was nothing more relaxing, he thought, than sitting on the deck and watching the world go by. He enjoyed every second of it, all his bad thoughts went away and he focused on the landscape. Every now and then, he’d have a go at drawing the sites he saw, even though he wasn’t very good. It relaxed him, and he wished he could just escape everything and sail on his canal boat. Escape his past, his future, everything that burdened and had scarred him.
“Yeah, I guess I have a problem with that. Hermione always nags me about it…”
“Mum!” Ron said loudly, sending Harry an apologetic look.
“That would be a start, though I mean all the time. No more stunts like that in the common room tonight. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but it’s hell for me in Slytherin.”
Thankfully, Dumbledore finally arrived. Harry was starving.
Harry hadn’t spoken to Malfoy since the night he discovered Flamel on Dumbledore’s chocolate frog card. It felt like it had been longer than a couple of months ago, what with the mirror of Erised and Hagrid’s new pet dragon.
“I know, girl,” Harry said and she squawked louder, flapping her wings as much as she could in the confined space, “I’m sorry, I’d let you out if I could.”
“I don’t know why you keep bragging about that. You know the Longbottoms and Weasleys are on the list too.” Zabini pointed out.
He took a seat next to the dark-haired girl that had been sorted just before him, who stared at him with a mix of surprise and reproach. Nevertheless, she passed him a silver and green tie. She and the others had already put theirs on, but Harry had never had to use a tie before so instead he twisted it in his lap.
Maybe his friends were busy or on holiday or something. Maybe Ron’s family owl died, and Hermione didn’t have an owl at all as far as Harry knew.
“Then I’ll do it,” Harry said quickly, grabbing Weasley’s shoulder.
He turned around- and the bottom of his stomach dropped. Somehow, the night had gotten even worse. He was going to
“Draco,” Pansy sniffed the next morning at breakfast. Draco looked up from his toast.
That night, Harry was halfway through his plate when Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat.
They all ran through Peeves all the way to the end of the corridor.
“It’s a long story, but I don’t understand. What are you lot doing here?” Harry asked.
Harry gathered a few things he’d want to take from his room: Hedwig’s leftover treats, his calendar, a couple pairs of socks. He passed them to Ron. On the stairs, Fred and George were lugging his trunk to his room. Harry heard a noise from his aunt and uncle’s room.
They fell into another awkward pause but Harry had the odd feeling that Malfoy was trying to be friendly, so he took another bite of his frog and shifted his essay.
Malfoy reached for his own chocolate frog and the two sat in half-way companionable silence while Harry worked on his essay.
“We were getting along that night in the common room before Christmas! Before you refused to tell me why you wanted to know about Flamel. I assume you’ve figured whatever it was out by now.” Malfoy said.
Harry flinched at the sound of his own name. Ron and Ginny fell silent, as did the line around them. Their bickering must have reached Lockhart, who had stood and had turned his sparkling smile their way. The poor boy waiting at the table for his autograph was shooed on by Lockhart’s photographer who waved Harry forward.
"Third --There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award five points to Mr. Neville Longbottom."
“Fine, since you know about the cloak, you can come along. I don’t have time to sit and chat.” He grumbled and finally brought his cloak out from behind his back. If Malfoy was with him, he wouldn’t have to worry about him telling a professor. Malfoy wasn’t that stupid.
When Harry entered the Great Hall after classes, he found that it was elaborately decorated. The enchanted ceiling was dark as the night outside but candles floated mid-air and bats swooped over people’s heads. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. Harry didn’t mind that he sat alone, even, because this was the first big feast since the sorting.
“Shut up, Malfoy. Go outside if you’re so scared.” He said again when he tried to pull Harry’s robes when Harry ignored him.
“Merlin.” Malfoy whispered, somehow even paler and slumping against the wall in fright.
“I don’t want you to think we blame you, Harry,” She said once he’d taken a seat at a long table and she was loading his plate with delicious-smelling food, “Arthur and I were just talking last night that we’d come get you ourselves if Ron didn’t receive a letter soon. But taking the
Snape bent over the troll but Professor McGonagall was looking at them all so angrily that her lips were white. Draco hadn’t ever seen her so angry, even that day in flying class when Harry had been caught.
Fred and George, who he’d gotten to know rather well through Ron at Hogwarts, treated him as they always had. They joked and poked fun, but Harry had already realized that this was their way of including him. They had come to get him, after all.
Dumbledore waited for the Hall to die down.
"Which means," Dumbledore said calmly, "we need a little change of decoration."
"Harry's is better than ours, though," said Fred, examining Harry's sweater. "She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family."
Harry exchanged a glance with Ron. Hermione looked smitten.
He missed Hogwarts more than he’d ever missed anything. He wanted to take a broom out on the grounds and practice for the Slytherin tryouts later this year. He wanted to go to the lake with Ron and Hermione and procrastinate studying for exams. He wanted to go visit Hagrid and choke down chunky rock cakes and lukewarm tea. He wouldn’t even mind sharing chocolate frogs with Draco Malfoy in the Common Room again at this point. Now that he’d had a taste of freedom and friendship at Hogwarts, it was like a blow to the face to be back here, alone and trapped.
"What on earth were you thinking of?" said Professor McGonagall, "You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in your dormitory?"
Harry glanced up from the note and then almost choked on his own spit. In Malfoy’s full-length mirror facing him, his body had gone. His head was all that remained visible.
“She’s bloody annoying, you should share Transfiguration with her.” Ron said, shaking her head.
Harry didn’t know what a lot of those words meant but alchemy, at least, seemed relevant to Dumbledore.
Another conversation that led nowhere. Harry thought about leaving but that seemed rude since Malfoy basically just sat down and anyway, he was only halfway through his transfiguration essay.
“But Malfoy–“ Ron started.
“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said the girl standing next to Harry. It could only be the youngest Weasley. She glared at him.
“Are you alright?” Ron asked, “Why do you have bars on your window? And why haven’t you been answering my letters?”
“You can be a little prickly.” Pansy said.
Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
He flounced away. Blaise would be exasperated, Pansy disapproving, Crabbe excited. It was a little quick for another scheme, but Draco couldn’t help himself. Something about Harry Potter drove him up the wall.
“I can’t believe that just happened, I can’t believe we all just nearly got expelled because of some stupid duel-“
Harry, gaping slightly, hurried to push up the window.
"What can you see?" Hermione said anxiously.
Thank you for reading! I hope everyone is staying healthy and happy and reading entirely too much fanfiction<33
“I told you. I overheard them talking about that oaf,” Draco said, “They’re up to something, alright? I’m going to see what it is.”
He didn’t know what he thought himself, really.
“You’re letting me off?” Harry asked, astounded.
“Shut it, and eat your breakfast,” Mrs. Weasley said, though she was a bit distracted with giving Harry more sausages.
“Sit down, Potter.” McGonagall said briskly, and Harry sat numbly in the chair as she settled across from him at her desk.
“Is anyone up for dessert?” Mr. Weasley suggested, looking far too out of his comfort zone, “I’d really like to try out that ice cream maker that I got from Perkins…”
The days passed quickly after that and soon they’d been at Hogwarts for two months. Hermione and Malfoy stayed insufferable as ever, though Malfoy had stopped picking fights at least, and the other Slytherins must have noticed that he’d finally let Harry alone after that night. Pansy was colder to him than she had been all year. Malfoy must have told her what happened. Either that or she had made her own deductions. Hermione had resolutely ignored Harry whenever they passed in the hallways or in classes and Ron said she’d been just as angry with him.
“Draco,” Lucius said, and to his surprise, he didn’t sound entirely angry. His voice was tight, either with nerves or excitement, and Draco noticed he was fiddling with his left sleeve absent-mindedly, “We have much to discuss.”
Harry left the common room early to meet Ron by the trophy room. Ron arrived a few minutes late, with a seething Hermione Granger and a pale Neville Longbottom with them.
“Just go, Malfoy. Can’t you see I’m busy here?” Harry snapped.
He hadn’t really ever had a good Christmas with the Dursley’s and he couldn’t remember the one when he was a few months old. It was looking like this one might be decent though, especially since Ron would also be staying at Hogwarts.
Harry was in the Slytherin common room for a change. It wasn’t as bad as Harry feared. The rest of their year largely ignored him ever since the troll thing happened with Malfoy, who seemed more nervous around Harry than ever. Usually, the older students whispered about him and sometimes cast annoying little spells that messed with whatever he happened to be working on, but this close to Christmas, all he got were a few dirty looks.
this he said rather pointedly, “Probably would have just hexed you.”
“Oh, you’ve got to be kidding,” Malfoy said loudly, when he’d caught site of Harry’s wave.
The next morning, Harry sat by himself at the end of the Slytherin table. He could feel the usual Slytherin’s eyes on him, though Malfoy quickly glanced away whenever Harry stared back. Harry felt a sense of satisfaction that he’d only really felt when he’d caught Neville’s remembrall in midair.
Each of the professor’s looked surprised at this admission as well.
He followed him.
Someone shoved Harry hard and he whirled around to see Malfoy scowling at him, paler than usual and looking scared.
Harry’s first week at Hogwarts was spent being steered around by Pansy as she bragged to everyone who listened that she was best friends with Harry Potter.
“It’s lovely,” Harry said, “Would you tell your mum thank you?”
“Oaf!” He shouted, shooting sparks from his wand from by the stalls. Harry made a beeline for Granger.
The rest of the day passed in similar fashion and by the time Harry returned to his empty dormitory, he was grinning in a way he hadn’t in a long time.
“Let’s move into the dining table, Draco,” Lucius said firmly, “Who knotted your tie? I know you were taught better than that.”
Malfoy regarded him for several moments before he finally sighed.
“I don’t know really. It was the only thing I could think to do. It was a bit stupid, wasn’t it?” Harry laughed.
“What exactly is the Sacred Twenty-Eight?” Harry asked Parkinson pointedly.
“They don’t really want Him back,” Blaise said reasonably, “And
“So if I’m nicer to you, and to your pet Gryffindors, we can be friends.”
The hat almost sounded doubtful and Harry wondered if the hat was even talking to him anymore.
Thanks for reading! Any comments/concerns always appreciated.
Ron muttered something to Harry before they both turned. Harry looked irritated, but smug enough that Malfoy was sure that he hadn’t gotten in trouble the day before. His hair, at least, was as messy as ever.
"... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points."
"He's heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Malfoy suddenly pressed a hand over his nose.
The Slytherins muttered among themselves in confusion. Malfoy wilted a little in his seat.
Inside, Hermione was cowering against the far wall, looking pale and as if she would faint any second. The troll was heading straight for her, knocking sinks off the wall that shot sprays of water high in the air and porcelain shards scattering everywhere.
Before he knew it, he had his trunk packed and was loading it onto the train with Ron and Hermione. He closed the compartment door and sat to spend the last pleasant moments he would have for a whole summer- with his friends.
“Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!” Dumbledore took his seat and then the plates on the tables were suddenly filled with food.
Draco wondered at the sight they made: two Slytherin and one Gryffindor first-year gathered around a downed troll.
Harry glanced at him but it was too dark to see his face.
“Well, we knew that. The ministry keeps tabs on him, of course. He was sent to live with that muggle family of his.” She answered.
There was nothing left to do but get out of the car. Ron helped Harry get his trunk out, but even he had gone green.
“Snape’s already gone through,” Harry said grimly.
Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years, followed closely by Malfoy, who had resolutely not commented on the fact he’d been beaten by a muggleborn.
“We’ve clashed a bit,” Draco admitted, “He spends most of his time with a couple of Gryffindors. Like I said, he doesn’t care about tradition at
Blaise, Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy had all been playing a game of exploding snap, though Draco had declined. Blaise was right, of course, his stomach was in knots. Surely, Snape would have made good on his word and written to his parents.
Hi! If you were waiting on this, sorry but online school required more of my attention than I thought it would. I've finished exams so I hope I can be a little more active for a while. Thanks for reading! Any comments/concerns/whatever are always welcome!
“Yeah, I told her you weren’t expecting any presents and…Well, she always knits us sweaters. And mine are always maroon.” Ron looked glumly at his own sweater, “I hate maroon.”
“Anyway, I think if I told him I had homework due, he’d at least let me have my books. I mean, Dudley has summer work. Aunt Petunia usually does it for him but still…” Hedwig didn’t have to make any noise this time for Harry to know it was a dumb idea. The Dursleys had never been reasonable.
“You sure do enough wriggling out of trouble of your own,” Weasley retorted, “I guess that’s what happens when your parents are snakes.
Before Draco could stop him, Harry was running for the door to the bathroom and throwing it open. He disappeared inside.
“Do something!” Harry called to Draco and he bent to grab something from the floor and threw it at the troll. He missed- honestly, this guy was supposed to be a good Quidditch player? But it hit the wall hard enough to grab the troll’s attention.
It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.
“Does it matter? What are we doing?” Draco said hotly.
Lucius sneered at him, and turned to Arthur who was glaring at him, one hand on Ginny’s shoulder protectively.
He wondered if he could get away with defending Hermione in front of the other Slytherins, but Malfoy’s triumphant look told him otherwise. He had seen the dragon that night, and until Ron’s brother came to get Norbert, Harry didn’t want to risk him going to a teacher.
What made him nervous was that his father didn’t say a word to him, just offered his arm for side-along.
“I don’t have anything to prove to you, Weasel. Maybe if we were to have a battle of pigs. Your family would really take the cake.” Draco sneered.
“Are you angry?” Draco asked, unable to help himself. Usually that question would have earned him a sharp look. It wasn’t the Malfoy way to ask questions so openly. Draco had been taught how to read social clues before he’d ever picked up a book.
Parkinson scoffed, “It’s more than gossip. You should be able to recognize the importance-“
“It wasn’t his fault, Professor–“ Padma Patil protested and Harry looked at her in surprise. He hadn’t expected her to stand up for someone in Slytherin. Though she’d probably been thinking the same thing about him.
“Have you finished this yet?” He asked. Malfoy glanced at his title then nodded.
“Give it here,” Harry called, feeling confident, “Or I’ll knock you off your broom.”
“You don’t have to talk about me like I’m not here,” Harry snapped.
“Hi,” Harry said, “Would you mind if maybe I sat with you?” Harry asked.
Ginny and Percy, however, were new to him. Ron, and thus Harry, avoided Percy at all costs while at school. He’d spent very little time around him but knew they didn’t have much in common. He would probably get along better with Hermione. Ginny spent the first few days shying away from Harry, but by the fourth breakfast, she’d taken the last empty seat across from him almost unconsciously and had only turned a little pink when he’d passed her the toast. It was progress.
“I sure could use some of Hermione’s blue fire.” Ron shivered as they walked in and took their seats at the end of the table. Harry was glad Dumbledore had foregone the usual house tables because sitting with Ron and his brothers was way better than eating alone at Slytherin.
“I don’t!” Ginny said quickly, “Of course I-“
“No, the Dursley’s have all of it locked up downstairs. My trunk, wand, everything.”
Weasley. But it doesn’t make sense to keep making trouble. Sooner or later, you’ll be caught in the fire.” Pansy took one last sip of her orange juice before following Blaise.
Harry saw familiar blonde hair in the corner of his eye and couldn’t help but turn to see Malfoy talking to Pansy. He turned and caught Harry’s eye. His face immediately shifted to a scowl and Pansy whipped her head to look at Harry too. She pursed her lips.
Later, when Lucius steered him out of Diagon Alley with an iron grasp on his shoulder, Draco thought about asking him. He doesn’t in the end, but he remembers it when he goes to bed, and again when he boards the train on Platform 9 ¾.
“You’re a natural flyer. Was that your first time on a broomstick?” At Harry’s nod, she shook her head, “Unbelievable! And here I thought Gryffindor would be able to break Slytherin’s winning streak.”
When Harry emerged into the common room, invisibility cloak in hand, Malfoy was once again waiting there.
“Oh, no,” Fred said, spotting his mum at last.
Harry Potter. Maybe it was a bit much to expect he’d be expelled within the first month,” Pansy said reasonably.
“Go back to the dungeons, Potter. I’m sure the rest of the house will be there shortly,” He said softly, “And may I say, it is…surprising that the two of you seem to be becoming fast friends considering past events. Draco, allow me to escort you to the hospital wing.”
“Not since Charlie,” George shook his head, “Put it away, Harry. My heart can’t take looking at it much longer.”
At last there was silence again.
Hermione straightened, looking as if she’d recovered enough to be angry at them again.
“Or a trick, to keep you from going back.” Fred countered, “Someone at school could have sent him.”
On Pansy Parkinson’s other side, Malfoy boasted loudly about the broom his father would be buying him, between snide remarks about which Wizarding family would be most disappointed after the sorting and how the Weasleys’ robes were
“Do me a favor and give that back to Longbottom. Godric knows he’ll need it.”
“Come on, run, run!” Harry yelled at her, trying to pull her towards the door, but she wouldn’t move. She sank further down the wall, her mouth open with terror.
!” He shouted.
“Don’t tell me you like that git too,” Ron said.
Harry clapped a bit slower this time. Hermione had mentioned something about Neville when they’d visited him in the hospital wing but he hadn’t been fully paying attention. Neville seemed similarly confused. He was turning quite pink as Ron pounded him on the back.Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had –four hundred and fifty-two, five points more than Ravenclaw.
He’d practically been going over the conversation all summer.
“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.”
It was… different than how he’d been treated at the Dursley’s and it might have been better in some ways, but it didn’t make Harry feel good. It felt more like he was being used and Pansy wasn’t exactly super pleasant to be around even when they were alone. She was especially annoying when she treated him like an idiot. Which was all the time.
When Harry just looked at him, Malfoy’s cheeks pinked a little and he sat gingerly in the armchair.
“You’ll let me ride your new broom, won’t you?” Ron asked as they pushed their way through the crowds to get to Quality Quidditch Supplies.
They met Seamus Finnigan in front of Madam Malkins and he dragged them excitedly down an alleyway to make Harry show him his broom. Fred, George, and their friend Lee Jordan were also anxious to look at it when they found them in the joke shop.
It was like saying “magic” back at the Dursley’s. Ginny jumped so hard that her elbow collided with Percy’s book which flipped and landed with a hard thud on the floor. Ron winced. Fred let out a low whistle and Mrs. Weasley set the plate down harder than necessary.
"You haven't got a letter on yours," George observed. "I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're called Gred and Forge."
“I’ll get it,” Harry said quickly, patting his hair flat.
"Right," said Ron.
And then it was Halloween.
“You can have it, if you like.” Mrs. Weasley sniffed, patting her eyes with her napkin.
Harry scowled again and ignored him, instead looking back across the hall. He could see Ron talking to one of his brothers and one of the ghosts that had come into the hall. At the staff table, Hagrid waved when Harry caught his eye. Harry waved back feebly, but he felt even worse for disappointing him too.
“I’m not,” Draco snapped. He and Harry couldn’t spend thirty minutes together without getting into a row. He also didn’t appreciate Blaise bringing up the talk he’d had with Snape, “Go back to sleep, Zabini.”
“Yeah, if we can get to the staircase, I’ll have no problem.” Harry said.
Harry carefully put away his presents, and folded the cloak neatly into his trunk. He got dressed and went to find Ron in the great hall.
Parkinson waved her hand, “We see each other at all the Ministry events. Everyone’s connected in the Wizarding World.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry and Ginny headed over to an abandoned corner full of muggle poetry. He dumped the entire collection into Ginny’s cauldron. She frowned at it.
Harry frowned but McGonagall was handing the remembrall back to him.
Harry could only nod.
They stepped into the room.
"Hey, look – he’s got a Weasley sweater, too!"
Ron, for the most part, turned scarlet whenever he and Harry exchanged glance, but he returned Harry’s wave with a hesitant one of his own. Harry gathered his courage on the first day of Potions, sidestepped Pansy, and walked up to Ron’s table where he had set his cauldron up next to Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan.
“What’s Dumbledore playing at, keeping a thing like that in a school?” Ron continued, shrugging off his dress robe and throwing it on another armchair and wiping his forehead.
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he made his way back to his dormitory. He remembered the little package that Hagrid had grabbed when they’d gone to Gringotts before term had began. Now that he was thinking about it, hadn’t Hagrid said that Hogwarts might be the only place safer than Gringotts?
“I think I remember something about that from History of Magic.” Harry replied.
When Harry returned to the common room after dinner, Malfoy was standing on a table, doing a rather impressive impression of Hermione in potions class.
“Nearly there, now. Listen, Harry, mum doesn’t know we took the car, so you’ll go to Ron’s room. He’ll come down and say, “look who turned up,” George said.
As the Weasleys talked more about the Malfoys, most of which Harry hadn’t heard about, he frowned out the window. He knew Malfoy and a few of the others had their reasons to be suspicious of him, for the same reason it had been such a shock to everyone when he’d been sorted into Slytherin. But he’d survived Voldemort eleven years ago and Malfoy had tried to befriend him before the sorting. Harry hadn’t thought they’d parted as enemies, either, though they certainly weren’t best friends.
“For the last time, no one asked you to come!” Ron growled at her.
Everyone seemed to like him. It’s the first time he’d ever experienced that and he’s so worried he’ll do something stupid to muck it all up. It was almost like being part of a family, though he wasn’t stupid enough to forget that he didn’t actually belong here. That they only treated him kindly because they were exceptionally good people, not out of any excess fondness for him. It felt like he fit in, but he wasn’t part of this family. He would never be.
He was working through a particularly difficult paragraph when Draco spoke again.
“Because of Voldemort?” Harry asked.
“About as much as I loved facing that troll,” Harry said and Draco’s mouth twitched.
“Oh, yeah?” Malfoy said, trying to sneer but looking worried.
Hedwig hooted from Ron’s lap and Harry grinned at her as he turned back in his seat. His heart was suddenly soaring, and he knew it wasn’t just because they were in the air.
“It’s a bit much to think he’d be expelled at all, and you should give it up,” Blaise said, “I know you have a weird idolizing/rivalry thing going on, but he’s not bad. He’s doing well in our classes, all things considered, and-“
Malfoy was quiet the rest of the trip, and when they got to Hagrid’s, he stayed in the corner while Harry dealt with Norbert, Hagrid watching him carefully all the while.
“This is
“Did you know Merlin was in Slytherin? Quite a famous figure.” Malfoy asked when Harry picked up his quill again.
“Quit bringing that up,” Draco rolled his eyes, “And I’m not going to get them expelled, I just want to know what’s going on. He’s been acting odd, haven’t you noticed? They’re whispering about Flamel and dogs and-“
“Morning,” George said, in an impressively cheerful voice. It didn’t stop Mrs. Weasley’s outburst.
Harry quickly tied the chain through several of the bars. George pulled the car back around to accelerate. Harry backed up to be near Hedwig who hooted doubtfully. There was a big snapping noise and then the bars popped out of the windows. The Weasley’s pulled it into the ford Anglia.
“A prefect!” Malfoy whispered and Harry ducked behind a large stone griffin, Malfoy hurrying to join him.
His eyes lingered on Draco. At any other point, he would have leaped at the chance to have private conversation with Professor Snape. At the moment, he would have preferred to face another mountain troll.
Harry started going by Fluffy’s door whenever he could to press his ear against it to make sure they were still guarding the trap door. Hermione would give an exasperated huff whenever he showed up to potions out of breath from running.
Parkinson raised an eyebrow at him, “If you want us to include you in the conversation, you’ve got to contribute, you know. You’re worse than Vincent.”
“Well, I didn’t, did I? I had Ron earlier in March and then Ginny after that, so I never got back with the order. She did send me a picture though, hold on a moment…” She pushed back from the table and disappeared from the kitchen.
"We're coming," said Hermione.
Draco felt his father’s hand on his shoulder before he heard him. He swallowed, then stepped back to let his father forward. He was small again, the way he could only be around him.
He cast the presents a curious glance before opening the letter.
“The Malfoy’s were involved with you-know-who. Though I guess the same could be said for most of Slytherin. No offense, mate.” George said.
Malfoy glanced up from his book, seemed to debate with himself if he could hold a civil conversation with him, and then cleared his throat.
“How is Granger? After Halloween.”
“Be quiet, Miss Patil–“
Harry raised an eyebrow at him.
Harry seemed to hesitate. He seemed thick enough most of the time, especially where it concerned the finer points of pureblood politics, but there was something shrewd in his eyes now as he looked between Draco and Snape.
She glared at them.
A stomach-turning apparition later, he landed steady on his feet in their drawing room. His mother snapped her fingers and one of their house elves appeared to take his trunk.
“Then prove it. Wizard’s Duel. Tonight.” Weasley said.
Ginny looked as though she might argue, but she didn’t have the chance. They were interrupted by a familiar voice. Harry turned to look.
He messed around with it a while longer, even going as far as to drape it over various surfaces to test its usefulness. Hedwig snapped her beak at him when he approached her with it.
Draco lowered his wand and his legs seemed to give out so that he sat hard on the wet floor of the bathroom. He raised a hand to his head and was surprised to discover that a shard from a toilet had left a gash on his forehead that was leaking blood into his eyes. All of this was embarrassing enough, but he also realized that he had been the only one who’d been injured.  Granger surprisingly spoke first.
Mrs. Weasley was as kind as ever, making a point to give him second, and even third, helpings at every meal. She’d done a bit of spellwork on his hand-me-down clothes so that they at least fit properly and were a different color than cement gray.
“Dad has to deal with Draco’s dad at work. They can’t stand each other.”
“No! But someone is. We’re going to stop them.” Harry said and Malfoy scoffed.
The club slipped out of the troll’s fist and rose high into the air. Then it fell back down on the troll’s head. It swayed and then collapsed forward with a great crash.
“Yes, yes, Draco, I’m not interested in how uneducated he is,” She said, sounding amused, “What is he like? You say you aren’t friends.”
“Please, like they’ll accept that. And then they’ll wonder why I didn’t turn Harry in, especially considering Quirrell was trying to bring Him back.”
Usually the way he passed time on Privet Drive was escaping outside. When he was younger, he’d go to the neighborhood playground but then he’d started scaring the other kids and their parents (having Dudley and his gang dogging his steps hadn’t helped). Sometimes he’d lay in Aunt Petunia’s garden and talk to whatever snakes happened by (he’d always thought he’d imagined them talking back before that day in the zoo). Aunt Petunia had him busy cleaning the entire house at least once a week, though he usually didn’t enjoy it.
"What's he doing?" Harry whispered. "Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?"
“Wandering after hours, are you, ickle firsties?” Peeves cackled, “Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caught. Should tell Filch I should. It’s for your own good, you know.”
"Can you smell something?"
“Dobby?” She called, stepping away from him, “Make sure the elves have started on lunch and serve it in the dining room.” She disappeared through the door, leaving Draco with his father.
“Maybe,” Draco said, thinking of Harry threatening him that night at the beginning of the school year.
“WHAT THE-“ Ron swore, but Harry yanked Neville to his feet and they were all flat-out running down the corridor and then the next. Ron, who was tallest, pulled ahead and Harry hardly thought about it before following him.
Hedwig hooted from her cage, picking at the lock with her beak.
“Because you’re going to lose all of Gryffindor’s points and you,” She pointed at Harry, “are going to get yourself expelled.”
“Lockhart wrote all of those books on our list, didn’t he?” Harry said, having read the name on the banner. Gilderoy Lockhart would be signing books at Flourish and Blotts that afternoon.
“Oh, did your aunt and uncle…?” She said uncertainly
"Another year gone!" Dumbledore said cheerfully. "And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts...
At that point, Uncle Vernon had burst through Harry’s open bedroom door. His face was reddening rapidly, and he made a choking noise at the sight of the car outside Harry’s window. Petunia was on his heels, gasping sharply and making to cover herself up from the boys. From down the hall, Harry heard Dudley call out something. The Weasley’s were all gaping back at them.
“I wasn’t involved,” Draco muttered.
“It’s um…the bedroom’s better.” Harry said.
The troll roared and then it was charging at Draco, who realized belatedly that he had left himself with no other route of escape. He would have cursed himself for his stupidity if he hadn’t been staring down a fully grown mountain troll in a girl’s lavatory.
After his wrong turn down Knockturn Alley, and he’d reconnected with the Weasleys, they made a quick stop at Gringotts. Then he, Ron, and Hermione had an hour to themselves before they were to meet the others at Flourish and Blott’s.
Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.
“Stop it,” Harry said blearily, throwing back his covers and scrambling for his glasses, “You’re going to mess up your wings.”
"Is it -- dead?"
Hi! So this is the end of the first book. Book 2 should start being posted soon. Sorry if it feels too rushed, I honestly didn't want to just repeat the story that everyone knows so I tried to just hit the important bits. It will definitely start picking up around the third book because I have PLANS. Thanks to everyone who read this/commented/left kudos. I love you forever.
Harry flinched, tightening his grip behind his back.
Malfoy gave him an unimpressed look.
“So what if they’re up to something? I thought you were done trying to get him expelled after you both saved the muggleborn girl.”
“We’ll go straight to the library when I get back. This is brilliant!” She shouted as she joined the crowd of students following Filch.
Malfoy gave a funny little nod and then climbed into bed and pulled his hangings closed.
"Prefects," he rumbled, "lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!"
They ended up having a snowball fight with the twins for several hours and when they came back for lunch, they were soaking wet and starving.
Harry pressed his face against the window to get a glimpse of the Weasley’s house. They lived a bit away from the village. Their house was a rickety tower of mismatched rooms, surrounded by a tiny yard and a shed. There were chickens and pigs, and a familiar plump woman standing by the door.
They followed her inside, and Harry was struck immediately with how different the Burrow was to Privet Drive. The inside was tiny and a little cluttered. It looked like it was very much lived in, unlike Aunt Petunia’s spotless floors and shining countertops. There were several pairs of shoes piled on top of each other by the door, cloaks hanging by hooks next to a clock with each of the Weasley’s names on a hand, several schoolbooks were piled on top of a table with half-finished papers on top.
“I’ve noticed,” Malfoy muttered.
“Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?” Draco said, because what else could he say.
defense.
“And mom prefers journaling, I can tell. I don’t think I’d prefer to have dad home either.” Pansy said.
“What?” He said stupidly.
And Harry let go.
“No wonder it’s so crowded,” Ron said in disgust, “And no wonder Mum chose today to come.”
Malfoy grumbled something intelligible.
“You head over there, now, and I’ll get the rest of everyone’s books,” Mrs. Weasley said, still beaming at Harry, “That was so noble of him, wasn’t it? And to think he’ll be teaching all of you…”
“I’m just asking, I don’t mean anything by it, of course. I was just a bit surprised is all.” She said, quickly forking another piece of chicken onto Harry’s plate as if to reassure him. Or distract him.
“Get over yourself. He’s here, and if you think anyone’s going to kick him out, then you’re mad.” Blaise picked up his bag.
Malfoy flushed pink again and Harry wished he were anywhere else. Why was this conversation so awkward? He sort of wished they would go back to fighting all the time.
He needed a broom, for sure. Professor McGonagall had said he’d be a great Quidditch player and he felt most at home on a broom. This year, he’d get to try out for the team as a “seeker” which was the player that zipped around chasing a ball even smaller than Neville’s remembrall. Ron had said that brooms were expensive, but he had plenty of money and he’d just ask the attendant which brand was the best model.
Harry shook her off and kicked off the ground. Flying was easier than he’d expected- in fact he could have whooped with joy at how fun- and effortless for him- it was. He heard Ron whoop and scattered cheers from the Gryffindors as he turned to face Malfoy.
Instead, he headed straight for the stairs leading down to the dorm. He had a few hours until it was his turn to sneak out and help Hagrid with Norbert. He traded the invisibility cloak with Ron and Hermione in shifts since they were all too busy to do it every night.
“Well, yes,” She said after a moment of shocked silence, “But I also knew your parents and you seemed so much like Lily, dear, when I met you on the platform.”
“For now, though it’s only a matter of time before they’re taken off. That family’s the biggest bunch of blood traitors in Europe,” Parkinson explained.
At the staff table, Dumbledore began to clap and the other teachers joined in. Harry hurried to join his table as McGonagall called the next name.
“We’ve all got to get back. Harry, you can get back?” Ron asked.
“No way. I thought McGonagall had him for sure,” Draco said, craning his head to stare. Harry was now waving across the hall at Ron who was flashing him a thumbs up.
“And several of our families are very close. The Malfoys, Notts, and Parkinsons are all listed on the Sacred Twenty-Eight, you know.”
“THAT BLOODY BIRD,” Uncle Vernon roared from downstairs.
Then they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the bathroom.
“Oh, it’s you,” said Weasley, looking at Draco as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. Draco wasn’t overly familiar with receiving the expression.
Unfortunately, just as he said that, a door rattled behind them and Peeves the Poltergeist soared out into the corridor. Harry groaned. He didn’t know how things kept getting worse.
It was very obviously Ron’s handwriting, though he hadn’t bothered signing. Harry smoothed Hedwig’s feathers with his knuckle, feeling much warmer than he ever had, even here in the dungeons alone.
And now he’d been locked in his room for days because of some bloody house-elf, taking meals through the cat-flap on his door that usually left him hungrier than he’d been to start with especially since he tried to share with Hedwig. This was a new low, even for him. He couldn’t even sneak to the kitchen at night to steal food.
Draco considered his friends, “Crabbe. The trophy room at midnight. Let me know if you chicken out so I don’t waste my time.”
Ron glanced behind Harry, presumably at the Slytherins who had gathered at the front of the class. Pansy and Malfoy were openly glaring at them, but Harry didn’t care.
“Well, yes, but we already know Harry’s the better flyer,” Ron said, “I bet he’ll expect Harry to show up with a comet or a
Draco sat stunned for a moment but ultimately, he didn’t see much choice. Harry was useless a majority of the time, and even if Draco wanted to go find help, it would be far too late for Harry or Hermione Granger.
“It’s okay. He’s just teasing.” Harry told her before Draco could decide how to respond.
At the end of the table, Harry got up and met Weasley at the door. Before he could think it through, Draco pushed away from the table and hurried after them.
"Don't be stupid," said Ron.
“So three first-years got through the teacher’s defenses?” He said when they had finished, “That’s got to be embarrassing, hasn’t it?”
“But, “She continued, “We’d be dumb to ignore the opportunity this presents for us. And you’ll be sharing a house with us for seven years after all. It’ll be a lot smoother if we at least get on a bit.”
"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something."
Malfoy jerked his head up to stare at Dumbledore. Harry was just as surprised. Whispers travelled down each table. No one had heard that Malfoy had been there that night.
Ron didn’t hesitate in sputtering, “Pig snout!” at the Fat Lady. Either she didn’t see Harry or she was too startled to mind because she swung open and Harry scrambled through the portrait hole with the rest of them.
"Nothing – there’s no sign of a bottom.”
“I’m not sure what it is-“ Harry began.
“I wouldn’t blame you for your parents. You know that, right?”
“A nice big smile, Harry. Together, you and I are worth the front page,” Lockhart said, shaking Harry’s hand for the camera. The rest of the crowd started clapping heartily.
Malfoy.
Harry shot at Malfoy, who jerked out of the way and shouted, “Catch it if you can, then!”
“He’s…” Draco said hesitantly, “He’s brave and he’s capable. He has to catch up to the rest of us, but he’s not doing as badly as I’d thought. He’s not like us, but I…” He trails off.
Harry tried to wiggle away but Lockhart hauled him back, his grin never wavering and his grip surprisingly tight on his shoulder. Fred and George were snickering at him.
“What rubbish.” Harry said, scoffing, and threw it across the room. It landed on Malfoy’s bed. It made Harry more irritable.
Professor McGonagall turned to Draco and Harry
“It’s not much,” Ron muttered next to Harry, rubbing his nose anxiously.
Ron didn’t know that they’d talked much beyond arguing. Malfoy had said he’d be nicer when Harry had last had a private conversation with him, but between exams and them going after the stone, there hadn’t been much of a chance to see if he’d keep his word.
irresponsible,” Hermione started, bristling at Harry like a cat. She was wearing a bubble-gum pink robe over her pajamas. It didn’t make her look any less frightening.
Malfoy hummed at his book, “It was certainly a very Gryffindor thing to do.”
Weasley and Granger fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart’s books.
“Your father would have been proud," she said. "He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.”
"If you want to go back, I won't blame you," he said. "You can take the cloak, I won't need it now."
Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps.
Under the cloak, It took no time to get back to the third floor. When they arrived, the door was already open.
“Oh no,” Ron moaned, “Thanks, Hermione. You’ve gone and got us all caught.”
It was Harry’s turn to be stunned. He hadn’t known Mrs. Weasley had known his parents at all. He wasn’t sure why he was so surprised. It’s not like he knew anything about his parent’s life.
Mr. Weasley was just as kind. He engaged Harry in conversations about muggles whenever he was home from work. It felt nice to know something that the others didn’t, and Mr. Weasley drunk every word in as if Harry were telling him the secrets of the universe.
"If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Malfoy, er Draco, knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived."
Harry glared at him, then glanced at his watch. Hagrid would be expecting him.
On the way to Ron’s house, Harry had plenty of time to tell the others about Dobby and his letters, and subsequently being locked in his room.
‘’It’s so expensive,” Harry said once they’d looked it over. Hagrid wasn’t here to keep his spending in check this time, and Ron certainly didn’t look as if he were going to tell Harry to be more frugal with his money.
The Slytherin and Gryffindor tables erupted into groans. Glares were thrown his way. Over at the Gryffindor table, Ron and Hermione were getting the same treatment.
Harry scowled at her.
The Weasley’s were all already at the table. They each had on sweaters.
Harry felt wrong-footed about coming to Hogwarts for the first time. He slowed down though it was a bit difficult considering the Dursleys hadn’t been very generous to him ever since Hagrid had busted down their door to give Harry his letter.
“You can trust me,” said Harry, now stepping into the office. “I wouldn’t do anything to jeopardise my position.”
“Oh Merlin, okay,” said Harry as he moved towards the office and knocked on the door.
“I don’t want to be a minister,” whined Draco, leaning his head onto Harry’s shoulder. Cheeks starting to redden, Harry looked away from the beautiful woman sat before him, trying to hide his blush that made him feel like a child.
“I’ve forgiven you for it, Harry,” said Malfoy, his hand still gently placed on Harry’s shoulder. “I’ve done a lot worse to you.”
“Draco,” breathed Harry, attempting to sit up.
“Potter,” Malfoy’s voice was soft. Something that was never heard by Harry. “Are you okay?”
“Our relationship fizzled,” he admitted. “We both hardly ever saw each other, and we wanted different things, I guess,” Harry rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly.
Friday finally arrived and Harry felt relieved that it was nearly the weekend. He had decided he was to go and see Ron and Hermione, maybe take care of the kids for them while they see to George. He’d sleep for as long as he wanted.
Harry imagined they were back at Hogwarts, sneaking out at night when they were supposed to be asleep. He imagined Lucius to be Filch, patrolling the halls with his candle and Mrs Norris, face scrunched up as he attempted to see in the dark. Draco and Harry approached another corner, and Draco peeped round, a mischievous smile painted on his face.
“We’re all ears,” she cooed.
The heavy doors opened, and Malfoy waltzed out.
“I very much doubt that,” scoffed Malfoy, but Harry could tell he was nervous. Malfoy picked at the skin on his knuckles when he was nervous, which in his adult years was hardly ever, but Malfoy was doing exactly that right now.
Suddenly, Malfoy turned around and grabbed onto Harry, and within that second, Malfoy apparated them both. The surprise of it made Harry’s stomach churn and his head dizzy, and suddenly they appeared somewhere else.
Ron kept shuffling from one foot to the other next to Harry. He’d been doing it all morning but had kept silent about why. Every now and then, he’d look down at his small pocket watch and either sigh or groan before putting it away again.
“Mal- sir,” said Harry, trying his best not to anger Malfoy, “I know we’ve always hated each other, but if you need to talk to someone…”
“What in the name of Merlin are you doing here?” asked Mrs Weasley, holding him at arm’s length. Her eyes were always kind, looking at Harry as if he were her own son. She was constantly inviting, extremely easy to talk to about any issue Harry was having.
“How’s that?” Harry felt intrigued. Surely after all those years they tormented each other, after that day in the bathroom, Harry would be the last person to make Malfoy feel safe.
With a hard expression, arms crossed, Malfoy snarled. “What are you going to do, Potter? Sectumsempra me again?”
Harry wrapped an arm around him and pressed a soft kiss to the back of Draco’s head. It was as if this small motion woke Draco out of a deep slumber. He rolled round, facing Harry. For a few moments, they stared at each other, then Draco’s whole face began to crumple.
“Thank you,” said Draco, taking the tissue and wiping his mouth with it.
After finishing his coffee on his comfortable sofa, he decided to run some errands. He floo’d himself to their local Wizards market and started accumulating food options for the weekends. This mostly consisted of simple to cook things, like pasta and rice, that would keep for months. Looking around, he saw two slender figures that he really did not want to bump into that day. Malfoy and Astoria, walking with their arms linked. Malfoy wore long black robes, of course, that covered his body and most importantly, his arms. Astoria wore a dark green long black dress, which looked to be velvet, and it was rather beautiful. As was she.
“Yes. I know that was what you wanted when we were in Hogwarts, a very large goal that you felt unachievable due to your blood status,” Draco swallowed sadly, thinking about how his wife had taught him to accept and appreciate muggleborns, “but I know you will do an excellent job. You are hardworking, loyal, and fair.”
Draco looked down.
“He won’t catch us in the staff quarters,” suggested Harry as they began to sneak through the halls. Malfoy agreed and they rushed around, stopping before every corner and poking their heads round on lookout for anyone that could see them. They both felt like kids again.
At already three years old, Scorpius fit in perfectly, especially since his hair was white blond like Draco’s. Something Harry would never not find amusing.
A few years after the battle, before Lucius Malfoy took over the ministry, George had taken a turn for the worse. The Weasleys and everyone around them knew he wasn’t doing well anyway, but it was so sudden. After Fred died, he had always been quiet and emotionally numb. He had stopped pranking, closed down their shared joke shop and become a recluse. There was hardly a time anyone saw a smile on George’s face. He’d lost his smile after Fred died.
“You’re such a bore,” said Malfoy with a huff. Harry had never seen this side of him before, he was actually fun. He didn’t seem to care what anyone thought of him in that moment, he was enjoying chatting to Harry. But it was definitely the alcohol.
“You are joking,” laughed Harry, shaking his head.
“I’ll go,” said Harry, quickly getting up and rushing out of the pub. He could just about see Malfoy, his robes flapping furiously in the wind, he was walking quickly. Harry started to run. He had no idea why he suddenly felt so protective of him. Back in school there was nothing Harry wanted more than to see Malfoy embarrassed, ridiculed, talked bad about. But now that was the last thing he wanted. His chest ached as he thought about Malfoy upset, he wanted to reach out and give him a hug and stroke his soft blonde hair comfortingly.
“Harry, my boy, you can help around the house when we need it. And keep George company.”
“I’m doing better,” replied George, setting up the chess board again. “There are good days and there are bad days. Mostly bad, but there are some good. Before it was just all bad.”
He, for his whole life, had been unable to produce a patronus. He’d tried, he had read up as much as he could about it, he’d hired tutors to attempt to teach him. But it seemed that no matter what, no memory was powerful enough, not even to produce a small version of the charm.
“A wolf,” repeated Malfoy.
They ended up at the burrow. Draco was unsure as to why he picked this place, as he had never been, he was even unsure he’d be able to apparate there. But, after a talk with Harry, he knew it was where Harry had been safely hiding for weeks. Draco felt as if he could trust the burrow, even trust the Weasleys.
“It’s cosy,” said Malfoy, which made Harry laugh.
Breakfast was over quickly after that, and Harry walked with Ron to the office. They stood there for a while before Malfoy arrived, which was odd, he was always punctual. They heard the clicking of shoes after ten minutes, and Malfoy stormed down the corridor. Harry nearly audibly gasped when he saw Malfoy. He had a swollen lip and his hair was a mess. Harry didn’t say anything, he just watched Malfoy rush into the office and slam the doors shut behind him, making both Harry and Ron jump.
Either way, Harry’s heart felt heavy as he dragged himself to his shower. The warm water beat down on his shoulders, massaging his aching head and relieving some pressure, unfortunately not enough. He stayed in the shower for longer than he usually did, rethinking the night’s events. It was almost as if he could still feel Malfoy’s lips on his, the hands tugging at his hair through passion. Tingles in his body sparked every time he thought of the kiss, butterflies fluttered around his stomach.
“Then do that,” said Harry unhelpfully.
“You need to think of your happiest memory,” explained Harry as he pulled out his wand. “I’ve used the same one for years. It’s something I’m still unsure even was a memory. It’s of my mum and dad,” Harry smiled as he began to let the memory consume him. Then, he held out his wand, and said “Expecto patronum.”
“You will keep up with me, Potter,” instructed Malfoy in a stern voice.
Harry felt his ears get hot. “What do you mean?”
“Do it, Draco,” hissed Lucius from behind. It took Malfoy a few more moments, staring at the Squib, who was desperately shaking his head, attempting to beg for forgiveness as the gag muffled his words. Then, Malfoy closed his eyes, swallowing harshly.
“What?” asked Malfoy, turning and looking at him.
He sat on his bed for what felt like hours, thinking about Astoria and Malfoy. He had no idea why it affected him so much, why it made his stomach churn and his chest hurt. He kept thinking of Malfoy and Astoria waiting with the doctor, who has his wand on her stomach, just to tell her no, she isn’t pregnant, yet again. He couldn’t imagine the strain it might put on their relationship, a relationship that Malfoy finally seems happy in…
“And what does that entail?”
“It appears so. I think usual night shift was sick,” explained Ron. “Seamus had to cover. I saw him when I needed to use the loo a few hours ago.”
“I know,” responded Malfoy, heading straight over to Harry’s closet and opening it up. He rummaged through Harry’s casual wear, grunting every now and then. Malfoy had always thought Harry lacked fashion sense.
Once they had finished decorating, Malfoy stood at the doorway, arms folded, admiring the handiwork.
Harry was silent for a few more moments before realisation washed over him. Malfoy wasn’t able to have sex with his own wife.
“I will do my best to keep Hermione safe,” said Draco softly, “as I know my father is becoming extra strict on muggleborns. If it comes to it, I will send her and Astoria away for a few weeks, so there is some form of excuse for her to not be at the manor.”
,” replied the witch, nodding to him, “for allowing us to use your home.”
“We should go back to the manor,” laughed Harry as he prodded Malfoy, finally noticing he was very drunk. “We need to sleep.”
“Where are we?” asked Harry. In front of them both was a loch, which Malfoy was already sat down next to, throwing a stick into it. Cautiously Harry walked over to him, looking around once more before sitting down.
“This is homely,” scoffed Ron as he looked around the room. After two weeks, the attic had gotten a small makeover. Still the boxes stayed shoved against the walls, but Harry now had an actual bed and a chest of drawers for his clothes.
“I won’t listen to these things without proof. I did not call you here to insult me or my father.”
“The stars.”
“I’m sorry to hear that,” said Harry after a few moments, stepping a little bit closer. “Is there a way you can work things out?”
“Nothing.”
“Sorry,” said Malfoy softly, his face close to Harry’s. Harry could feel his breath blow across his cheek. “I’m just very tired.”
Whilst in the embrace, Malfoy found the courage to apparate the two men to the ministry.
Malfoy just looked up at him from his desk.
“I’d like a BLT and a flat white, please,” said Harry. “Uh, Malfoy, I don’t have any money on me.”
But he couldn’t.
“Most of it.”
“We should get some lunch,” said Malfoy after a while of silence, pointing towards a small café that stood in front of them. Harry agreed and the two headed towards the building. Inside was small and quaint, the walls were a light-yellow colour and the tables had a single flower in a little vase on them.
“Why should I?”
“None of your business, Weaselby,” laughed Malfoy as Harry dragged him into the office. He got him settled on the chair and picked up Malfoy’s coffee pot, tapping it with his wand to boil the water.
“Harry,” they turned to face each other.
“Yes, isn’t she a beauty? She’s a Narrowboat, helps to get round these tight canals. Do you go sailing?”
It greeted him as if greeting an old friend.
“Malfoy?” said Harry in a shocked tone, suddenly embarrassed he hadn’t put on a shirt. Malfoy’s cheeks went pink, too, as he looked away respectfully.
“Lumos maxima,” said Malfoy, and his wand lit up. They were at the loch again.
Draco stood in the office where Harry had once entered, trying to find the horcrux locket that Umbridge had attempted to keep safe. Everything looked different now, the office looked friendlier, and it definitely didn’t have any traces of Umbridge left.
Malfoy’s lips pressed together as he thought carefully about what to say next. “Sit down,” he instructed.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. “I love you too.”
“Hullo, Harry,” she smiled as she allowed Harry to do his job, using his wand to check her and ensure Malfoy would be safe.
Today was Harry’s day off, and he had planned to spend the whole day sleeping, but Hermione had other plans. She decided to drag Harry to Hogsmeade for a fun day with Ron and the kids, to grab some lunch and do some shopping. This was the last thing Harry wanted to do, he was so exhausted from the past week, but Hermione insisted it would be good for him.
Astoria was dead.
“What do you mean?”
The hours felt like days to Draco. He was unable to eat, even drinking water had his stomach churning. Everything he had been doing for the past few years was about to come into action, all the evidence used against his father. And now, his father would be gone. Possibly forever.
“Come,” Draco held out his hand. There was a brief moment where Harry felt embarrassment, like the idea of Draco showing him affection in front of Narcissa was wrong, that Draco would be punished for it. But then he remembered all those days spent with Narcissa, helping her with gardening, while she allowed Harry to tell her the truth about their relationship.
Pansy walked in with her husband. She had married Theo Nott a few years after the battle. She was one of the people Harry dreaded to see, but to his surprise, she was pleasant. Harry thought she looked breath taking. She wore a baro’t saya, proudly showing her native dress, which complimented her perfectly. The cream coloured alampay that hung around her shoulders was held together with a silver Slytherin pin. Down towards the bottom of the baro’t saya, it faded into a black colour, with a gold detailing pattern. Pansy seemed to glow in her outfit, she shone so much more now than she did at Hogwarts.
“Oh, but everyone wanted to date you,” said Harry. “You were one of the most popular boys in the whole school. Every girl swooned when they saw you,” he almost seemed irritated to say that, Malfoy thought.
“I’m sorry,” whispered Harry.
“No.”
That night, Hermione held a large dinner for hers and Ron’s family, inviting Draco and Harry to join them, in celebration for her new position as minister.
“At least you didn’t become a Death Eater,” said Malfoy, and Harry noticed he started to rub his arm, right where the Dark Mark was. “It’s hard to bring yourself back from that.” Harry didn’t know what to say after that, so he just nodded and looked down at his hands. He had never had a civil conversation with Malfoy before, and it definitely felt weird, but it almost felt comforting to him. Silently Malfoy just walked past Harry, expecting him to follow, which, of course, Harry did. They ended up back at the office and Harry returned to his usual post, Ron watching him with a frown.
“I’m okay,” croaked Harry, finally looking away from his eggs and at Hermione, her dark eyes worried. “I just remembered, that’s all.”
After placing the box on the counter, Draco tapped his wand on the lid, and the box grew thrice the size it had been. Caractacus instantly looked excited as slowly Draco pulled off the lid and carefully picked up the ball.
“No, sir, we split a while ago,” stated Harry, his voice slightly quieter than before.
Mouth feeling like cotton, Harry looked to the side of him where he expected Malfoy to still be. But, to his disappointment, he wasn’t there. The feeling of Harry’s heart dropping in his chest was heavy. Shaking himself off, he attempted to get up to have a shower, groaning at the thumping in his head and the churning in his stomach.
“You have a Squib on trial today too, right?” Draco asked, speaking for the first time since he had walked in the room.
“Pull…” was all Draco could manage before he closed his eyes. Harry started pulling out the pins and throwing them aside, desperately talking to Draco to try and keep him conscious.
Harry had never seen Malfoy so excited. Today he was throwing a small party, he would be hosting a dinner for his old Slytherin friends. He had invited the likes of Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Theo Nott and some others. Malfoy hadn’t seen them in years, and he was certainly looking forward to it.
“No, don’t do that,” said Malfoy quickly, helping him lay back down carefully. “Let me help you.” Malfoy got up and switched on the lamp, making Harry groan as his head throbbed for the first time since he had woken up. The noise of Malfoy scrabbling about made Harry smile. He had gone into the bathroom and grabbed a cloth, got out Harry’s pyjamas and found a new pillowcase.
Harry said his goodbyes to Hermione and Ron, who seemed utterly confused, especially when Malfoy gave them hugs too. Though, they’d never seen Malfoy drunk before, and that he most definitely was.
“No!” he found himself screaming, scooping up the lifeless body of his wife. Her head lolled in his arms as he pulled her close, begging for her to still be alive.
“I can’t heal you as father will know. All I can do is allow you to rest. So please, go back to your room. Get some sleep. I’ll see you tomorrow morning,” and with a nod, Malfoy walked into his office and closed the large doors behind him, leaving Harry feeling very confused.
“Yes, you are. Your clothes are terrible, Potter. You need some new ones for when you’re off work.”
Harry didn’t respond, he just continued chopping carrots. Hugo and Rose suddenly ran through the kitchen, chasing each other, which made Mrs Weasley jump and Harry laugh. It was rare that he laughed nowadays, but it always felt good when he did.
“Thank you, Mrs Weasley. I’ll come and see you again very soon,” he responded. He said his goodbyes to Mr Weasley and the kids, before floo-ing himself back to his small apartment.
Malfoy paused, looking into Harry’s bright green eyes, the eyes he found himself lost in time and time again.
“He just needed to grab something,” shrugged Harry, avoiding eye contact with Ron. “Wanted to make sure no one was going to follow him.”
“I can’t put you in danger, not again.”
“No, Potter!” Malfoy stood up angrily and started to pace his office, shaking his head violently. “You just don’t get it, do you? It’s not that simple. It’s not that easy. He’s done this my whole life.”
“Do you ever wonder,” said Harry weakly as Malfoy started to mop up some of the blood on his face, “if things would’ve turned out differently… If I had accepted your hand?”
Harry ended up passing Ron on his way, which seemed odd, because Malfoy should be in his office at this point. Ron was just as confused, saying Malfoy had dismissed him and to do work with Astoria instead. This worried Harry more, and he almost ran to Malfoy’s office.
“Harry Potter, are you actually
“One red ribbon means suspected danger. Two means there is definite danger, but it isn’t urgent. Three means urgent danger. One yellow ribbon means an unexpected meeting from my father is or has taken place. Two means it is a private meeting. Three means it is an obvious illegal meeting with former Death Eaters. One blue ribbon means he has been ignoring laws regarding ex Death Eaters. Two means he has obliviated a muggleborn. Three means he has obliviated a half-blood,” Draco stopped for a moment, shaking his head.
“Yes, because their mother had them with her half-uncle. They end up living in the attic of their grandparents house and the book is based on their life in the attic,” explained Harry as they started to walk out the door.
“What are you doing?” Harry sat up now. Shaking his head, Draco placed the book back into the chest.
As Harry overthought every word that was said, Malfoy’s slim fingers slowly found their way to Harry’s and, carefully, their fingers intertwined together perfectly.
“Okay.”
“Potter,” said Blaise with a slight smirk curling his lips.
Over the next few months, Draco had started to heal. There were times he had night terrors, and would wake Harry up screaming, thrashing about, yelling Astoria’s name. It got to a point he’d end up taking dreamless potions at night just to stop them, but Harry had insisted he tried to come off them, as if Draco didn’t take one, he’d have a panic attack.
“How is your father?”
“Sit there,” he instructed before heading to the bar. Harry slowly went and sat down, undoing the clasp that held his cloak together, then rolled it up next to him. Malfoy came back over with a glass of cinnamon fire whiskey for himself, and Hannah Abbott came over with a tray. She placed down a tea and the house soup in front of Harry, before walking off.
“Mum, please,” said another, and Harry knew who it was in an instant.
Narcissa looked at him with an eyebrow raised. “Why?”
“Nothing,” responded Ron. Harry could see his fingers reach into his pocket again.
“We know,” said the unfamiliar voice, “but we received the owl with three red ribbons tied to his foot. Malfoy, we couldn’t ignore the message.”
“You know you can talk to me,” Harry’s voice remained soft, partially to soothe his head, partially to soothe the tall, slender man in front of him, who was visibly shaking.
“Very funny, are those more for me?”
“We’ll get you, you and your family. We’ll get you all thrown into Azkaban. This is your final warning. If you don’t sort shit out, you’re done for.”
“You two are so bloody weird. Always blushing around each other, sharing weird looks,” Ron shook his head, “like a pair of schoolgirls.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said once the rain started to clear. “We have to go and get dried off.” Malfoy looked at him, a frown furrowing his brows.
They continued along the cobblestone pathways; Malfoy was walking slower than his usual pace. He was taking everything in. The air felt clean and fresh, the gentle damp smell of recent rain entered his senses every time he took in a breath. Everything felt so bright and happy, especially compared to the Wizarding World. The air there was musky, the streets always appeared dark and dismal. Especially after Malfoy’s father had been put in charge.
It hadn’t even been three hours before Lucius put his hands on Harry again. This time, it was just because Harry was stood there. It wasn’t his fault. But, Lucius had gotten a taste of beating Harry, knowing he couldn’t do anything back like he could during Hogwarts, and it made him hungry for more.
“Draco,” Harry sat next to him, stomach churning wildly.
Still unsure, Draco warily followed Harry into the oddly shaped house. As it was morning, the Weasleys were sat at the kitchen table, a large breakfast piled up. As soon as Harry entered, he was met with a swat over the head, then engulfed in a hug.
“Here,” Malfoy pulled out his wand and pointed it at Harry’s nose, and with a crack, and a lot of pain, Harry’s nose was no longer broken. Seeing Malfoy cast a spell without saying any words reminded Harry of how much of a talented wizard he was. He was always top of the class with Hermione, he was exceptionally smart, but he had gotten himself into a bad place. A place he couldn’t help but get himself into.
But no, instead Malfoy sat down next to Harry. He was silent for some time, allowing Harry to get his tears out, before he finally spoke.
For the year after defeating Voldemort, Harry had no idea what to do with himself. His whole identity was to defeat Voldemort and that had gone within one day. Of course he was celebrated, everyone would congratulate him on the streets, and this time it was even more than before, as Voldemort was actually dead. Everyone had seen his lifeless body lay there, unlike all those years ago at Godric’s Hollow. This time the fame had really gotten to Harry, and he lost himself. It was his sudden love of canal boating that brought him back.
“The Wizarding World was a mess before he stepped in. Especially after Hogwarts,” Theo shook his head. “The way it is now is brilliant.”
“I need some air,” said Harry, storming out of the office before he could think twice. His blood boiled as he stormed through the corridors of the manor, trying to take deep breaths to calm himself down before returning to Narcissa. There was no logical explanation as to why Harry had become so fired up, but there it was, all of these feelings he felt he had suppressed because Malfoy needed him to suppress them, now out in the open.
“Since when did
“No, it’s not, neither is protecting you in an out of bounds section.”
“I was contemplating putting in a transfer for one of your staff. Seamus Finnigan,” explained Blaise while looking between the two men, his eyebrows slightly raised.
“I didn’t ask for you to look after me, Potter.”
Once the last pin was pulled out, he could see Draco’s skin begin to heal. The cobwebs faded, until a light grey colour was all that was left.
Draco looked up at Harry, no longer wailing, but instead hiccuping out soft cries. Harry’s hand gently wiped away his tears, then cupped his slender, pointed face.
“Harry,” he breathed deeply, “I thought you were-”
“What is it?”
Harry would have given Ron a snarky comment back, but his mind was far too preoccupied. Malfoy had been doing these dealings
“Thank you,” said Harry at last before standing up and getting out his wand. He quickly cast the hot-air charm on Malfoy’s clothes before handing him back his blazer and turtleneck. Malfoy just held them in his hands for a while, looking down at them, before slowly slipping them back on.
Narcissa sighed. “Lucius.”
“Of course, Draco,” he said, before leaving the room. Quickly Malfoy grabbed onto Harry’s arm and dragged him through the halls, all the way to his office.
“He actually isn’t all that bad, Ron,” defended Harry, “you just have to get to know him.”
Curling back into him, Draco’s hand grabbed onto Harry’s. “That’s all I need,” said Draco, the first words he had spoken since arriving at the Weasley’s household.
“Although, sometimes I feel as though he doesn’t care,” said Astoria, “I try very hard and Draco never seems interested. There’s always an excuse, he’s too tired, he’s had a bad day, he’s got to get up early in the morning. Sometimes I wonder if it’s me,” Astoria had said too much. In a fit of rage, Malfoy stood up, knocking over his chair before storming out of the pub. Instantly Astoria’s cheeks went bright red, she knew she had messed up, and she looked ashamedly down at her lap. Harry saw a tear slowly fall down her cheek.
“You’re the best little brother I could ask for,” slurred George, rolling onto his side to try and hide his sobs, but they were too loud to hide. Harry stood awkwardly in the corner of the room while Ron took off George’s shoes and socks, then lay down next to him, putting an arm around him and holding him close.
“What do you want from me?”
The workhouses. Something new that Lucius Malfoy had put in place. Ever since he had become the Minister for magic, he almost refused to acknowledge that Muggleborns and Half-Bloods could do magic. Instead, he forced them to work and only be able to perform magic on the weekend. He claimed it was to keep them acknowledging where they came from, carrying out Muggle tasks throughout the week. Harry had nearly ended up at the workhouses, just for being who he was. For being the boy who destroyed Lord Voldemort.
They entered the large room, where Lucius Malfoy stood, an evil grin spread across his face.
It had been ten minutes before the light came back. But this time, it kept growing and growing. Harry couldn’t do anything but stare, not even reach for his wand that sat on his bedside table.
“There’s no proof I am. I set up this meeting to attempt to figure out what is happening with my business, not to be insulted.”
Harry’s lack of concentration on the job had gotten him in trouble a few times. Once with Lucius Malfoy. Harry had accidentally spilled water onto him, only a few small drops, but that was enough. Lucius got up, grabbed Harry by the hair and dragged him out of the dining room.
“Can you hear me?” whispered Harry, but Draco didn’t respond. Harry pulled Draco’s body close, tracing the lines that decorated Draco’s torso with his finger. “I’m so sorry I left. I should have stayed. I’ve made everything so much worse for you. I’m so sorry, Draco. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
The swarms of witches and wizards marched towards the dining room. Draco merged into the crowd as the ministers walked in front, and they swung the doors open with such force the doors slammed into the walls.
“Enjoying that?” he asked, folding his arms with a small smirk on his face.
“I’m unsure why the payments seem to be void,” Malfoy stated part way through the meeting. Harry noticed he hadn’t been paying too much attention to what they were saying, only to the actions they were taking. Something that Auror training had taught him.
Once breakfast was over, the Malfoys all exited the room. Ron and Harry began clearing away the plates. Exhaustion was already washing over Harry and his day hadn’t even begun, but it may have been the thought that the weekend was just the next day. He could go back home, practice magic, hang out with his friends. Things he loved to do.
“Probably looks better on me than you,” retorted Harry, almost instantly regretting it. Things weren’t the same as they were at Hogwarts, answering Malfoy back in a sarcastic tone was no longer accepted.
Hands shaking, Draco searched around his basement frantically. Beads of sweat dripped down from his forehead as he rummaged carefully through the artefacts that lay still, some with silk cloths over, others covered in dust. Today he had to handle business at Borgin and Burkes without Potter. The thought of Potter not being there caused him a flutter of panic. Maybe, Draco thought, he had gotten to used to the idea of Potter being by his side.
Breathing deeply, Harry shook himself off and managed to do up his tie. He looked down at his hands, a frown furrowing his eyebrows. They felt heavy, but there was nothing there. Missing was his wand. The job forced him to leave his wand back at his own home, only able to use it on weekends or at holidays. Here, no magic was allowed.
“Oh, we know,” said Ron, “what in the name of Godric Gryffindor was going on between you two?”
“You haven’t,” said Harry, shaking his head before turning back around and walking towards the bed. “I could have killed you. All you did was just say mean things. You saved my life, Malfoy, that day in the manor. You stopped them from calling You Know Who on me,” Harry looked at him again. He’d never spoken to anyone about this before, not even Ron or Hermione. The shame was embedded so deeply into him, he didn’t know he even
“Father,” nodded Malfoy, walking to the centre of the room. There was a chair there, with a person on who Harry guessed was the Squib. He was tied up, a gag in his mouth, eyes wide with fear and streaming with tears.
“It was fine,” Malfoy paused, swallowing nervously. “Father didn’t notice even though he came into the office not long after you left. I complained of a headache and went to bed before dinner. I think Astoria knew, though,” he spoke truthfully, the words just flowed together. It was easy speaking to Harry at this moment, Harry was the only person he felt he could trust. Something Malfoy had never felt before.
“We just wanted to talk,” came the response from a shadowed figure, and Draco saw two other men appear from behind it.
He had to find out.
“Draco asked me to check on you.”
“You don’t, though, do you?”
“You don’t know until you try.”
Without a second thought, Harry crashed his lips into Draco’s, cupping the sides of his scarred face. For a moment, Draco was surprised, but relaxed into the kiss, placing a bony hand on the back of Harry’s head, fingers gently running through the wild black curls.
(Trigger warning: abuse and violence.)
“Like what?”
Once dressed, he freshened himself up before exiting the bathroom. Malfoy was sat on his bed, reading the book Harry kept on his nightstand.
“Mal-” Harry cut himself off with a whimper. It hurt too much to speak. Without saying anything, Malfoy carefully sat on the bed next to Harry, trying his best not to move the bed too much.
“Lucius would allow that?” asked Mrs Weasley as she plated up breakfast, plopping down plenty of eggs and toast on Draco’s plate.
“Yes,” said Harry uncomfortably.
“That’s a shame,” said Malfoy sarcastically. This was the wrong choice.
that is
Harry walked out of the room and Malfoy looked him up and down, a small smirk on his lips.
“There’s some roots over there that need digging up too, Harry,” said Narcissa’s soft voice as she pointed to a patch in the giant garden. The sun blazed down on them, causing them both to break out in a sweat. Today, Narcissa had decided to do some gardening, and Harry helped.
“That’s a shame. Maybe I can get a transfer so they can work together,” smiled Blaise. Harry could tell he cared for his staff, just like Astoria did with her maids.
“He does.”
“Shit,” whispered Malfoy. “Father can’t know I’ve been drinking.”
“You underestimate me, Potter,” he responded, a twinkle in his eye as he looked at Harry, before moving his gaze out of the window.
He started to wish it were him that danced in Malfoy’s arms. He didn’t know why, but the idea of him being in Malfoy’s arms seemed right.
“That would be nice,” said George with a small smile. Nodding, Harry shot him a grin before drinking the remainder of what was left in his glass.
“Hi George,” said Harry, sitting down next to Mr Weasley.
He stood; his wand held towards the Squib. His hand was visibly shaking. Memories flashed back in Harry’s mind to the night in the astronomy tower, and there was no doubt Malfoy was thinking the same thing.
There was a small coffee shop appearing in his vision. Smiling a small smile, he decided to go and get a cup of coffee before apparating home. The coffee shop was very sweet. It was all a pastel yellow colour, with shabby chic tables and chairs, all decorated with a bouquet of flowers. He was the only one in there, so he got quick service. The coffee was delightful, one of the best he’d ever tasted, he thought.
“I don’t know why, I’ve told you that,” Malfoy kept his cool the whole time, the words rolling easily off his tongue. He has most definitely matured since Hogwarts, Harry thought. “Everything that I can find is in these papers.”
“Are you hurt?” asked Harry. The patronus continued watching him, then slowly turned around and began to walk, disappearing through the door, leaving Harry in darkness.
“Yes, I do,” Harry grabbed onto his hand, forcing him to stop. This made Malfoy jump and he stared at Harry, eyes wide, mouth open. “We will never know how each other felt. But I can tell you I know what it’s like to have repressed trauma. Having to live my life pretending it’s not there. Every time I look in the mirror and see the scar on my forehead, I go through what you told me earlier. I’m thrown back into that time. Sometimes I get phantom pains and I can’t concentrate anymore; I feel like I’m going to pass out in fear that Voldemort is back.”
A bright white flashed from the end of his wand, stretching as far as Malfoy could see. Then, a stag formed in front of them. The stag trotted around Malfoy, making him grin as it nudged its nose against his shoulder. The stag then galloped around the loch, on top of the water, on the bank, all around the two men who stood watching. Slowly, Harry allowed the memory to fade, and with it, the stag did, too.
“What else is in the trunk?” asked Mr Weasley.
“He stopped my bodyguard from travelling with me, so I had to do deals on my own. I got caught. He’s focusing in intently on me.”
“We had a difference of preference,” said Harry truthfully, taking a large swig from his wizard’s brew. “I’m not drunk enough to give you the details.”
The chest grew to its original size. He pulled out the book he’d been flicking through back in the manor and placed it down on the table in front of the couple.
“Ron and Hermione let me crash at theirs,” answered Harry as he rubbed his hair with the towel. Nodding, Malfoy slowly took off his blazer, keeping it in his hands as he looked around.
“Nonsense. You’re going to stay in the attic. We will cast protection spells on it every hour to ensure no one can track you down. But you are not to leave the attic until we know you are safe,” Mr Weasley’s voice had a sternness to it.
“Harry, my boy!” Mr Weasley said to break the tension, giving Harry a hug. “Would you like a drink?”
“This is records I have compiled since Lucius’ reign as the minister began. From how he became the minister, to things he has been hiding and illegal actions he has taken.”
“Still, I miss the feel of my wand,” whined Ron. The boys both went quiet immediately when the large doors opened to Malfoy’s office. They always creaked when it opened, warning them Malfoy was coming. Out he walked, his dark green robes floating along with him.
“Draco?” breathed Narcissa, tears instantly welling up in her round blue eyes. Harry found himself rushing over to the limp body without a second thought and carefully moved Malfoy’s head. His cheekbone was cut open, swelling bigger by the second and already darkening in a bruise.
. It filled him with immense sadness he couldn’t get rid of. The pit of his stomach twisted, remembering back to the day Malfoy had questioned him about it. Back to the time when things felt they could be okay, even with Lucius as the minister. But now, that was all gone, and Harry didn’t think it would ever be able to return.
“Yes.”
“Okay,” nodded Harry, placing the teapot down on the table before turning to leave the office.
“Of course not. This is Lucius Malfoy we are talking about, Harry. He would do anything to destroy the Muggleborns, you and I both know that.”
“Clear,” he said, before grabbing Harry’s arm and rushing down that corridor. They heard a noise, and both flattened against the wall. Peeking round, Harry saw a member of the staff, one of the maids. Looking back at Draco, he put his finger to his lips, telling him to stay quiet. Imagining it was one of the professors, Harry did his best to breathe as quietly as possible, before checking again. She had gone.
“I can imagine, you were so drunk,” said Hermione as she let him in. He sauntered his way through their house, approaching their lounge and flopping down onto the comfortable sofa.
“But, I-”
“What is it today?” asked Caractacus curiously, leaning over the counter slightly to try and get a closer look at the shrunken box Draco was pulling out of his robe pocket.
“That you have some weird thing going on with me. Blaise could see it.”
Lucius’ back, when Harry had always thought it was instructions from Lucius himself. There were many things Malfoy had been keeping from his father, and now Harry felt uneasy about him. If he was keeping something so big as these dealings from Lucius, then what could he be keeping from Harry? Was there something Malfoy was plotting, something big, something dangerous, with all this money he was curating from the dealings?
Once Harry sat back down, Malfoy was back with his questions. “So in Hogwarts, did you not experiment?”
“Sit down, would you like a cup of tea?” asked Mrs Weasley, to which Harry responded in a shake of the head. She sat opposite him, an inquisitive look on her gentle face.
“I love you.”
Malfoy opened heavy black doors with the wave of his wand. Harry was sure they were in the undergrounds of the Manor. He looked around the room, which Malfoy dimly lit with candles with another swift wand flick. Harry was shocked to find the room was full of artifacts he had never seen before. It was a mess, it almost looked like the room of requirement in sixth year. And low and behold, there was even the vanishing cabinet stored in the far corner. It brought back memories to Harry which he’d rather forget. Every day he was reminded of the curse he had cast on Malfoy, without knowing what it was, leaving him near death on the bathroom floor, by the scar on Malfoy’s face. Seeing the vanishing cabinet brought it all back now, too.
“You okay, Georgie?” asked Ron, putting a hand to his forehead, breathing a sigh of relief when he was a normal temperature.
“I hope you’ve learned your lesson, Potter,” spat Lucius, “you will never be my son’s bodyguard again. Do you understand? You will work alongside Narcissa’s butlers.”
“They have to hide from their grandfather?” asked Malfoy, standing up and glancing at the book again.
“Sir,” said Harry in a quiet voice. “I think it’s time we went back to the Manor.”
Harry.
“Interesting,” replied Harry with a polite smile.
“Hey Harry,” replied George. “How are you holding up?”
“Better than before. Got discharged a few weeks ago. Seeing a mind healer twice a week, but they’re going to put it down to once a week soon. They’re impressed with my progress.”
“I’d rather Malfoy than Lucius,” mumbled Harry, trying to ensure no one else could hear him. “I know Lucius hits the Muggleborns that work for him.”
Harry pondered over to the patch, shovel in hand, and began to dig at the root. He could feel the back of his neck burning, but he almost didn’t mind. Narcissa had made sure he had plenty of cold water, had even made him put on sunscreen before they headed to the gardens.
“You keep telling me we’re close,” Malfoy seemed irritated, “and we don’t get any closer.”
“Do you understand?” asked Malfoy in a low voice. Quickly Harry nodded and Malfoy instantly backed off, turning back round and continued walking. They ended up heading towards the Leaky Cauldron, which Harry thought was strange, but didn’t question it. As they entered, Malfoy pointed to a table in the corner.
“Because it’s you, you and your attitude towards things. Acting like everything’s easy peasy. Maybe it is when you’re the chosen one, but not when you’re me. You’re lucky, you know that? Everything got handed to you your whole life. Help when you needed it, time when you needed it. Everyone ran around for you, did all your dirty work for you. I had to battle all of my own demons on my own. Pansy, Blaise, Theo, they never understood. Everyone thought I was a spoilt kid who got everything he wanted just because my father was rich. That wasn’t the case.”
“Harry,” said Draco softly as the small man stepped into the room.
“Me too,” muttered Harry, looking down at his butterbeer. Everything was going so well for him when he left Hogwarts. He didn’t return for his final years, instead went straight into Auror training. They took him on because he defeated Lord Voldemort, they trusted he would be a good Auror. And he was. He was absolutely excellent. But he was only able to be an Auror for three years before Lucius overtook the ministry. Everything changed then.
“We will need to make a copy of those,” the taller man stated, getting out his wand. Harry stood firm, making some noise to ensure the men remembered he was there. Taking a firm grasp around the wood, Harry made his wand visible to them.
“Dean works for you, doesn’t he?”
He had knelt down at the spot where Astoria had lay, and Harry swore the floor looked darker there. Draco had run his fingers along the cold surface, a few tears dripping from his grey eyes.
“Alright,” she said softly, but slamming the teapot down in frustration, “I was just asking a question.”
“Could I have a cappuccino and a cream tea, please?” Malfoy smiled at her, reaching into his pocket and pulling out some muggle change.
Malfoy strode past them, dressed in black robes that trailed along behind him, giving him a sense of authority and power. Malfoy had taken over the affairs of the house and the dealings of dark artifacts. His job seemed extremely stressful, and even more so with Astoria as his wife.
“Isn’t it beautiful?” shouted Malfoy over the sound of the thunder, “they remind us that we all have our breaking points. No matter how much sun we fill our lives with, there’s always going to be a moment where we need to have a storm.” A large grin spread across Malfoy’s face as he held out his arms, spinning in a circle once, laughter erupting from him again.
“Oh, you two!” Mrs Weasley breathed, putting her hand to her heart and closing her eyes. “You’re going to be the death of me.”
“Are you kidding me? He’s a nightmare! It’s either we’re standing there for six hours straight or we’re constantly running around after him, making cups of tea and fetching paperwork!” complained Ron.
But today, something was pulling him towards Malfoy’s office. He was still allowed to go there, as it was his main position, and there shouldn’t be an issue with just checking on the office, ensuring it was locked, ensuring Malfoy wasn’t in there.
“No, he hasn’t really been at the office at all,” said Ron with a frown, “I’ve been helping some of the maids with Astoria because he’s hardly ever been there.”
“You make me feel safe, Harry.”
“Don’t lie to me, Malfoy.”
“Well, you’re Harry Potter, aren’t you? Defeater of the Dark Lord?” Malfoy sneered. “Be there at eleven, sharp. Bring your wand.” And with that, he walked off. Harry watched them, Astoria kept muttering to Malfoy, but he didn’t seem in the slightest bit interested in anything she was saying.
“No,” breathed Harry, shaking his head. Lucius Malfoy had placed a bounty on him.
“Very well, thank you. He’s one of my personal butlers. Seamus works here, doesn’t he?”
“I- Nothing,” stuttered Harry, shaking his head. “I just couldn’t stop thinking about things and decided to take a walk. Are you okay?”
“We really appreciate that,” said Mrs Weasley with a warming smile.
“Sometimes he can actually be fun,” replied Harry, laughing a little at George and Ron’s responses.
“Here,” said Malfoy, carefully handing Harry the robe. “Put this on.” Malfoy turned and headed out of the door, closing only one to give Harry some privacy. He slipped the robe on over his clothes, feeling the material in his hands. It was soft, almost like velvet, it was certainly very expensive.
They made their way towards the elevators and stepped inside, grabbing onto the rails before the elevator shot them down the floors at a fast speed. The motion made Harry feel sick, his hangover ever apparent. It felt as though he was travelling through a million different dimensions at once, stars covered his eyesight. He blinked, attempting to stay focused.
“You’d really let me?” asked Harry, looking up at the stranger. He had a kind face, light brown hair and had a short build. Similar height to Harry.
His favourites, though, would always be those of Draco when he was a child –  before Hogwarts.
“Mr Malfoy,” she breathed, nodding to him.
“I’m going to go back to my room,” said Harry finally, putting down his fork and standing up.
“Come in,” said Harry, now grabbing a shirt and quickly slipping it on. “What is it?”
The boys giggled together as they ran through the hall again, finally approaching Harry’s room. It was further away from the other staff, a proper bedroom this time with an en suite, because he permanently lived there now. The furniture was still bland, just a bed, a wardrobe and a bedside table, but it was better than before. At least, the window was bigger, and he was able to see the forests that stretched around the manor.
“Thank you for telling me that,” said Harry in a small voice. “You don’t realise how much I needed to hear it.”
,” responded a second voice. “You need to tell us the capacity of danger you’re in.”
“Fine,” he sneered, “I’ll go and order our lunch.” Irritably Astoria sat down on the seat next to Hermione, quickly taking off her cardigan.
But Draco Malfoy completed Harry Potter, completely and utterly.
Wand firmly in hand, Harry continued on, entering the village. Streetlamps decorated the empty roads, everyone tucked up in bed in the cold early morning. It hadn’t even reached time for the morning chorus yet.
“Oh really?”
“I understand,” Narcissa looked to the bedroom door. “May I?”
Harry spun his wand in his hand, grinning as the wood felt heavy, his hand feeling warm. A perk of the job is being able to have his wand again. Nothing felt better to him.
“Fine,” said Ron grumpily, sipping at his black coffee. He definitely needs it, Harry thought. It seems like Ron woke up on the wrong side of the bed that morning.
After two years, Draco had proposed to Harry in France while they were on holiday. Of course, Harry said yes, and they got married soon after.
“Draco. It’s so weird hearing you say his first name,” said Ron in amusement. “What is going on between you two?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” It was Blaise and Malfoy.
“Lucius Malfoy,” said the French minister.
Grunting, Harry walked to the changing room. In annoyance, he pulled of his casual and comfy clothes and tried on the suit. It was a dark brown colour, the material was soft even though it didn’t look it, and Harry found it very comfortable to wear. He left the first three buttons of the white shirt unbuttoned, then opened the curtain to the changing rooms. Malfoy was there with a few more suits draped over his arm. Looking at him up and down with his grey eyes, Malfoy smirked slightly.
“One moment,” called Harry, his voice wavering as he spoke. After wiping his face, he opened the door to find Narcissa stood there.
“I need somewhere to stay. I know it’s so much to ask, but I have nowhere else to go.”
“Because you remind me of my childhood. You remind me of the good times, when I was actually happy,” stated Malfoy, a small hint of pink rushing to his cheeks as he confided in Harry, showing him his vulnerable side. “I want to go back to that often. Running around those halls, calling each other names, chasing after each other on the Quidditch pitch. No one else reminds me of the good times more than you do, Harry.”
Harry had been having sleepless nights. He hadn’t left the attic in four days unless to use the bathroom. Even George had tried to get him to go on a protected walk around the grounds of the burrow, but Harry wouldn’t budge.
“Today, I got in trouble. Those wizards you saved me from before, they had followed me into Borgin and Burkes while I was making a deal. Afterwards, they followed me down an alley. They began to threaten throwing me and my family in Azkaban, and when I grabbed my wand, I realised I couldn’t call for help.” Malfoy looked up at him with sad eyes and they glistened softly in the dim candlelight.
He entered the travelling room and grabbed the floo powder. Before throwing it down, he took a deep, nervous breath.
The trio had a nice morning, Hermione made them a light lunch and they chatted like nothing was wrong with the Wizarding World. These were some of Harry’s favourite times. Moments like these were extremely rare for him to come by now, and he cherished every single one.
Harry instantly felt comfort from this motion. It sent shivers up his spine and had the hair on his arms standing on end. Malfoy’s thumb was soft against the raised, scarred skin.
“I’d leave them alone,” she said sadly, attempting a gentle smile and squeezing Harry’s hand, “we don’t want Lucius catching you with him, as much as my son would do better with you by his side. Better than anyone else, I think.”
“I’ll probably never have to use it,” said Harry, “it’s only a precaution.”
“You cannot tell
Never had Draco imagined he would have the golden trio surrounding him, taking care of him as he suffered the greatest loss he’d ever been through.
“No thanks,” slurred Harry in response. “Is that your boat?”
“How is he?” asked Narcissa, turning and facing Harry. Her expression was worried, and there were fine lines forming on her face that Harry hadn’t noticed before.
Nor was Harry.
“Very well,” said Mr Borgin, wrapping it back up in a cloth. He headed over to an empty case and carefully placed it in there, shutting the glass case and tapping it with his wand to ensure its security. Hobbling back over to the counter, Mr Borgin began to estimate how much he owed Malfoy.
?” exclaimed Ron, making Harry wince.
The party seemed to last hours. After the Slytherins had eaten their dinner, music blasted in the hall and everyone used this opportunity to either catch up with their peers or to dance. Every now and then, Harry would look over to Malfoy, who had Astoria by his side the whole time. They would chat to a fellow Slytherin, then head to the dancefloor when a song they enjoyed came on. Malfoy’s hands wrapped around Astoria’s small waist, holding her close, while her arms snaked around his neck. There was a pang of jealousy tugging at Harry’s chest, making the room feel stuffy and his collar suddenly too tight. He tried to shake it off, but every time he looked back over, it was there again.
“Seamus was on a night shift?”
He paused for a moment at his bedroom, staring at the double bed. His memory flashed back to a few years ago, when he and Ginny lay together, hands gently entwined. Her beautiful ginger locks would tickle Harry’s cheek as they cuddled, her tinkly laughter filling the room.
“He’s been helping me chop the carrots while you laze about with your father,” huffed Mrs Weasley, stirring the soup once again.
“Oh, and the
“I said I forgive you,” repeated Malfoy, staring at the empty dark brown wall. Then, he moved his hand over to Harry’s and placed it on top, giving his hand a firm squeeze. “Please remember that.”
Letting out an annoyed grunt, Draco climbed out of the bed and headed over to a large chest that sat underneath his window. Sitting cross-legged in front of it, he muttered “Alohomora” quietly, then slowly reached inside. The contents had been bound by a blood curse, to ensure anyone who may be snooping could never find them. And if they did, they suffered excruciating consequences.
“That’s good news?” asked Harry, a frown furrowing his eyebrows.
“I’m so weak,” said Malfoy quietly. Shaking his head, Harry gently placed a hand to Malfoy’s cheek.
“Harry, it’s fine,” said Ron sternly, shooting Harry a look of annoyance.
Harry looked down at his plate, staying silent while Hermione and Ron continued having a conversation about their days. Suddenly he didn’t feel hungry anymore, instead he felt sad. Though Malfoy was one of his lifelong enemies, he knew that Malfoy would have wanted a child. The thought of Astoria and Malfoy having issues conceiving made him feel sorry for them, especially since Astoria seemed to be a nice person. She wouldn’t let that child grow up with the same views Lucius made Malfoy grow up with, thought Harry, she would have him grow up to accept Muggleborns.
“Avada Kedavra!”
“I’ll continue doing my job, it was nice to speak to you, Mr Zabini,” said Harry before walking off.
“Astoria,” breathed Draco.
Three red ribbons tied to an owl. What could it mean? What was Malfoy up to? His shocked expression told Harry it was something bad, but his cool demeaner when Harry had questioned his motives. He remembered how panicked Malfoy had seemed when he thought it was Lucius, when Harry raised his voice above a whisper, as if he was worried Lucius would hear him doing something he shouldn’t be.
“That’s something I brought us here to talk about,” said Draco as Mr Weasley entered the house again.
“I think I will,” said Harry, just staring at the trees that passed them by.
“I don’t know what to do anymore,” Harry’s voice was quiet as he stared down to the floor, attempting to fight away frightened tears.
Looking to his side, he saw Malfoy, who was also fast asleep. Then, he looked to their hands. They were still linked together, fitting perfectly. Harry couldn’t help but smile to himself.
“Alohomora.”
“She said you complete Draco.”
you?” asked Hermione, sitting next to him and placing a small hand on top of his. Harry looked at her, her dark brown eyes were filled with concern, dancing between his green ones quickly. A frown furrowed her eyebrows and she appeared to be examining his face for any sign of a jolt, or an expression that could be showing his true feelings.
“You’re right,” he said, looking back up at the sky one more time. “There always has to be an end.”
Draco’s eyes widened. “What?”
Malfoy looked at him. There was a slight irritation on his face, but other than that, he seemed nervous.
“I don’t know why you’re getting so angry,” said Harry calmly, which only made Malfoy even more mad.
“I know,” replied Draco. With a frown, he closed the chest and quickly cast a shrinking charm. A handy spell he consistently used. Firmly holding the chest into his hand, he said, “not here,” before grabbing Harry’s hand and disapparating.
“What’s that?”
“I don’t speak French,” said Harry, sipping his tea. He felt annoyed.
“It’s my day off,” stated Harry, closing the door.
Things were quite usual at the Manor, even though he had been given an upgrade, as he was still to be a butler for the family. Still getting up at the crack of dawn for their breakfast, still standing outside Malfoy’s office for hours on end with Ron. That he was grateful for. He couldn’t imagine having to sit inside the office with Malfoy every day.
“You’ll get into trouble if you don’t,” said Harry.
“You’ve never told me that story.”
“We should go,” said Malfoy after a few moments silence.
“We know,” mumbled Ron, placing a hand on his knee before laughing, “you’ve never been pleasant when you’re hungover.”
“Mrs Weasley,” said Harry, looking over at her. He felt like he was going to be sick.
Malfoy pushed open large dark wooden doors that were perfectly polished and shone as he opened them. The room they stepped into was smaller than the rooms Harry was used to seeing. From front to back lined clothes upon clothes, the majority being cloaks.
“I have trouble sleeping. It’s one of the potions the mind healers are trialling me on. Instructions tell me I have to take it at night for it to work, but it makes me wide awake and sleep all day.”
“Harry,” he heard the strained voice say. It was Malfoy.
“Draco… Are you unable to create a patronus?” asked Harry careful. The silence answered Harry’s question. With a small smile, Harry gripped onto Draco’s hand tighter. “Come on, then.”
Harry scoffed, “yeah right.”
“Mr Malfoy,” said Mr Borgin, a smile on his terrifying face, his brown teeth gritted together. “How can I help you today, sir?”
“You’re whining because you can’t have me with you. Do you think I had bodyguards when Voldemort was trying to kill me? No. I had to stand up for myself, I had to protect myself. Why can’t you do the same?”
“You’re always hiding something,” sighed Harry, slowly sitting himself up to Malfoy’s dismay. “Sneaky conversations with Blaise, trips to Borgin and Burkes that you don’t explain, now this.”
They turned a corner and were greeted by a mind healer, who took them to where George was. He was sat, playing wizard’s chess with another patient. It seemed very much like a muggle hospital, Harry thought.
“Today seems different,” answered Harry thoughtfully, staring at the large wooden doors that were now closed. “Something seems… Off.”
“My son has caused me great disappointment as of late,” said Lucius coolly as he cut into his eggs. Ron instantly looked at Harry, then the two men looked over at Hermione, who’s deep brown eyes were widened, staring straight back at them.
Groggily Harry got up and opened it, and to his surprise, found Malfoy. He was dressed in casual clothes and waltzed into the room without asking permission to enter.
“You’re an absolute moron, Harry Potter. You should have told me you weren’t well enough to come with me.”
Finally, he was able to speak. “M-Malfoy?”
“I’m fine,” slurred George, his eyes drooping as he looked at the two boys. “I don’t know.”
The two men walked in silence towards Lucius’ office, Seamus trailing behind them, unsure what the situation was. Malfoy knocked on the door.
“We’re not talking much anymore. It’s quite hard on my mother,” said Malfoy truthfully. “She was the person who set us up over a dinner. Astoria and I really got along well, and we ended up seeing each other more. But after getting married, things just stopped being as good as it was. There are things about myself that I still don’t understand,” Malfoy swallowed, his shoulders tense, “and I am still trying to figure them out.”
“Obliviate,” he said, and a gentle white flash of light shot towards the man on the chair. Panic flashed in his eyes, before slowly, nothing. Body slumped; the Squib stared at the floor.
Harry had begged Draco not to make him go back to the manor, that his father will kill Harry if they go back. But there was nowhere else for them to go.
“I’m trying.”
“How’s it going there?” Asked Neville, his Yorkshire accent always seemed stronger as ever to Harry as he wasn’t so used to seeing him these days.
“You’re gay?” asked Malfoy, suddenly serious, a frown knitting his light eyebrows together.
They approached a front desk. No words were needed, the receptionist witch instantly recognised Malfoy and allowed them to enter. The pair entered the large hall and Harry was filled with happy memories. Memories of his days being an auror with Ron.
“Yes,” said Draco as he curled into his mother like a child, “very much so.” Harry imagined Draco as a child, running in the garden and falling, grazing his small pale knee. Narcissa rushing over to her son, pulling him onto her lap and shushing him gently, telling him it’s only a scratch, and that he’s safe in her arms.
“Sir,” started Harry, looking down at his lap to avoid eye contact, but he could tell Malfoy’s piercing grey eyes didn’t leave his face, “why are you being kind to me?”
Harry’s breath was heavy as he slept. He looked gentle, as though nothing could harm him while he slept. Unlike when he was awake, the constant wrinkle of a frown creasing his forehead. It seemed Harry never relaxed his brow anymore.
“Yes,” replied Malfoy and walked in. Sighing, Harry trekked in after him and stood next to Malfoy as he looked at the clothes. Everything looked expensive, mostly suits, mostly tweed.
“Spit it out!” said Ron impatiently, his mouth full of food.
“Not loud,” grunted Harry, putting his hand to his forehead, “I’m extremely hungover.”
It had been a restless night for Harry. He’d tossed and turned all night long, unable to switch off his thoughts. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Malfoy in front of him, the pained look on his face as they argued. How his mouth had opened as if he were about to apologise before Harry disapparated. How his eyes seemed duller than they had been, darker circles decorating the underneath of his eyes, his cheekbones looking more sunken than Harry remembered. Thinking back, Harry wished he had noticed earlier and asked Malfoy if he was okay. The meeting he’d had seemed serious, and Harry couldn’t figure it out.
It was now around nine in the morning, and Harry decided to explore the little town he had stumbled across. This was another part of canal boating he loved, finding new places to explore. Afterwards he could just apparate home, a reason he loved being a wizard.
“Yes,” Ron opened the door and Malfoy stepped inside. Harry could see his knuckles were bleeding and he was still picking at them now.
“It’s true,” Ron interjected. “Malfoy tortured us, you especially, in Hogwarts. Called you vile names and bullied any Muggleborn. Now he’s just rolling over and acting like his father is a big inconvenience.”
At this point, it was a waiting game.
Ron met him on the way there. “I’m not looking forward to this. I bloody hate Slytherins.”
On the floor, lay a limp body. It took a few moments for Draco to register what was happening. Then, his knees buckled beneath him, and he clattered to the floor.
“Because you’re having arguments with Astoria. I’m just a little plaything until everything’s sorted out, aren’t I?”
“Thank you,” he managed to mutter through the stings.
“I’m suspecting these are your children?” asked Astoria, a large grin plastered on her tanned face.
“Mum,” he sobbed. Harry had never heard Draco call her ‘mum’ before. It seemed so informal, so
“A wolf,” breathed Harry as he finally looked over to Malfoy. He could just about see the pointed face beside him in the moonlight.
“Why do you have them?”
“Sorry, mate,” said George quietly, waving his wand to light a candle. “I didn’t mean to startle you.”
“We’re compiling the evidence. We fear there are still elements you are withholding from us.”
Malfoy got Harry to stand in the office with him while he sorted out papers, organising everything for his meeting. He almost seems nervous, Harry thought, a frown furrowing on his eyebrows as he watched Malfoy pace about. His bony fingers seemed to shake as he picked up pieces of paper, checking them, then placing them back down, only to check them again moments later. The last time Harry had seen Malfoy like this was back at the battle.
Harry stayed silent, staring at Malfoy, who continued to look down at his lap. Slowly, Harry reached towards him and rolled up his sleeve, revealing the dark mark. It was faded now, it no longer moved, but it was there forever. A constant reminder of Malfoy’s terrible past.
After finishing his pasta, Harry retired to bed. He was exhausted from the long journey and was more than excited to finally curl up under his covers, in his own bed. The beds at Hogwarts were definitely comfortable, but there was no better feeling than his own bed.
“I hope they treat you well. I try and treat all my staff well.”
“Why didn’t you?” whispered Harry, trying to open his eyes but being unsuccessful.
Harry used his wand to clean up the smashed teapot, while Malfoy used his to clean up the papers and set them back down on his desk. The two tidied in silence, but the company was comforting enough.
“I know. I’ll manage. I managed before. My mother’s lovely, Harry. I spoke to her before I came to see you. She feels bad. She’ll look after you.” Malfoy seemed to ramble on. Something Harry had never seen him do before. His sentences were short, he barely left room for breath, he was quite obviously nervous.
“I want to tell you the truth, Harry, but you must promise to not tell a soul.”
“Thank you, Mrs Weasley,” said Harry, then he looked over at Mr Weasley, “you too, Mr Weasley. I’m so grateful for everything you do for me.”
“I never get to see dad, though,” moaned Ron, still a mischievous glint in his eyes. “Harry, dad wants to say hi to you.”
“I’m sorry for the intrusion.”
Hermione was stood at the door, tears streaming down her own face as she watched the two men holding each other. Ron’s hands were placed on her shoulders gently, giving them a gentle squeeze every few seconds to remind her that he was there.
“I don’t know what you’re insinuating, Zabini,” spat Malfoy, his words softly slurred.
“And what were you expecting?”
“I wanted to go somewhere quaint and nice, somewhere quiet. Grab my arm, I’ll apparate us there,” instructed Malfoy. Placing the book back down on the table, Harry walked round and took hold of his arm. With a pop, they disapparated, and suddenly they were in Rye.
“Well he’s not going to!” Malfoy’s voice was raised, he was agitated, scared. “Because you’re not going to say anything. And everything will be fine.”
But she wasn’t.
“So’s
“How did everything go yesterday?” asked Harry.
The two stumbled around the manor, trying to keep quiet but failing completely. They giggled like schoolgirls as they clung to each other, knocking into the dark walls, stumbling over their own feet as well as each other’s. In an attempt not to get caught by Malfoy’s parents, they headed to Harry’s room and fell into it, laughing loudly together once the door was shut, knowing they could be as loud as they liked and no one would really hear them. Even with that reassurance, Malfoy clumsily pulled out his wand and put a silencing charm on the room, yelling “
Though happy to be home, the cottage seemed empty. It was so quiet; the lights were all off and the curtains all drawn. Harry flicked his wand again, making all the lights switch on simultaneously. He pondered into the kitchen, yawning as he did, and looked through his cupboards. He knew Mrs Weasley would have left him some food; she did every year since he started at Hogwarts. She was the only person allowed into his cottage during term time. In the cupboard Harry found some pasta, which was perfect for what he needed right now, something sustainable and quick to cook.
“Oh, you know, the usual,” huffed Hermione, blowing strands of her locks out of her face. “Having to run around after Malfoy’s wife. But you know, she isn’t too bad,” she shrugged slightly. “I mean, she disagrees with Lucius’ ideas. She’s always going on about them. She’s quite friendly to us.”
“I seem to say this a lot lately, but thanks, Potter,” said Malfoy once the office was back to its original condition.
“Lucius-” started Narcissa, but it was too late. Lucius’ wand was pulled and pointed towards Draco.
“Yes,” replied Harry, looking down at the floor. “This is all my fault.”
“Me too. Your visit with Ron cheered me up, even if it was brief. Brought some normality back. But I’m definitely way better at wizard’s chess now, so Ron better watch out,” chuckled George.
“Would you like to? I’ll let you come along for the ride. I’m only going until the next docks, probably an hour or so.”
“I just want to know what’s happening, Harry,” she reached forwards and took his hand in hers, “Harry here has run away from the manor.”
“What on earth do you mean?”
The door to Harry’s cottage swung open as he carried through his trunks. After struggling to get them all in, he finally collapsed onto the sofa. A large grin tugged at his lips as he stretched across the sofa, happy to be home at last.
As the top ex-Aurors in the manor, Harry and Ron stood by the doors of the hall to welcome the guests and ensure no one tried to sneak in. After that, they would start serving drinks with the other butlers.
“Thank you,” said Malfoy in a small voice, nodding to her and Ron before he headed towards the door.
“Here,” he said finally, holding out the guide for Harry to take.
Snapping his head round, Harry gawked at Malfoy. “What?”
“Thank you, for keeping me safe,” replied Malfoy sheepishly. “And for getting me home.”
“We were just walking around London,” lied Harry with a false smile. “Mr Malfoy wasn’t feeling tired and we went to a twenty-four-hour library. He ended up falling asleep for an hour or so, though.”
“I mean, true,” shrugged Ron, looking at himself in the mirror before releasing a loud sigh. “But especially not today. And I hate not being able to use magic.”
“You may go now,” interrupted Malfoy. Without saying anything else, he looked back down at his papers and continued scribbling. Confused, Harry walked out of the office, the doors slamming shut behind him.
“He understands how hard this situation can be for you. After everything you have been through since such a young age. It’s understandable you need a moment,” said Narcissa with a soft, motherly smile. “And I know my being here may be hard, too.”
“Proceed,” Malfoy said to the man. Slowly, he placed his wand to the pile of papers, a small light shining before he removed it, making a copy that would print out back at the ministry.
“I’m glad,” said Harry with a small smile. He watched as George and Ron continued to play wizard’s chess, laughing together. It made him happy to see George smiling, but he still felt that guilt residing in him. There was nothing more he wanted right now than to just go home and go to sleep, block all the emotions he was feeling. Sometimes he thought maybe he should see a mind healer, but after everything he had been through, it would take years for him to even understand how to deal with his emotions.
Slowly, Malfoy sat back down on the bed and stared at his lap. “The reason Astoria and I are having problems, isn’t because I don’t love her. It’s because… I’m unable to
“Help me and the other members of this organisation in taking down my father once and for all.”
“I’ll help him to bed,” said Harry, before gently running his hands through Draco’s hair to wake him softly. Eyelids drooping, Draco looked up at Harry sleepily. “Bedtime, mister,” chuckled Harry. Draco whined, but sat up anyway, rubbing his eyes while he swayed slightly.
As the pasta boiled, he made his way round his quaint little cottage, checking everything was still in order. There was still a lot of paranoia left in Harry’s mind, he was still unable to let go of his past. The thoughts of someone breaking into his cottage while he was gone and stealing something he treasured, or someone awaiting his arrival home shrouded his mind and terrified him to the core. But, upon a quick inspection while his pasta cooked, everything seemed normal.
The rest of the night seemed tense around Malfoy and Blaise. They would look at each other from across the room, as if they knew what the other was thinking. Harry tried to avoid being near both men, just in case an awkward question got brought up.
“I meant it, you know,” mumbled Malfoy as he stood up. “When I said you make me feel safe. I think, after all this time, you’re the only person who has made me feel safe.”
“Draco, you like him, don’t you?” Harry felt his heartbeat quicken. If it got any louder, he was sure the men would be able to hear him.
? Harry braced himself for maybe finding men in the office, having a secret meeting on how to destroy the muggleborns. Or Malfoy playing with another dark artefact, ready to sell for more money. Or Malfoy signing some illegal contracts-
“You make me feel safe, Harry,” slowly Malfoy lay down on the wet grass at the foot of the loch. “You calm me down. I can be myself around you.”
for my father’s imprisonment. I was sick to the bone of you, constantly getting points for Gryffindor, destroying my time at Hogwarts by just being Harry Potter. After the war, I wanted absolutely nothing to do with you. When I heard you’d have to go to the workhouses, I fought for you to be a butler here because I thought I wanted to torture you,” Malfoy laughed and shook his head, facing the wall. “All that time, I didn’t realise I was pining for you.”
“Yeah,” said Harry quietly, trying to make sure no other staff could hear their conversation. “He’s risking getting in trouble for it, too.”
“Things were simpler back then,” said Draco, his body tensing. “Especially in the first few years. It’s hard to let go of the times we could truly be kids.” Those words ran through Harry like ice. He had forgotten that Malfoy had grown up in such a strict household, his father forcing his opinions on him since such a young age. He remembered hearing that Malfoy had no friends before Hogwarts, and that must have taken a toll.
“What’s wrong, Ron?” asked Harry finally, after Ron had looked at his pocket watch for the tenth time in the past hour.
“Draco,” he said softly, squeezing the thin hand that his was wrapped around. “Draco, wake up.”
“It’s fine,” said Harry, “I’ll help you. He won’t know.”
“Thanking him in your speech, always looking at him, and don’t think I didn’t see what you did when you approached us,” Blaise spoke in an accusatory tone.
Thoughts crowded Harry’s mind, and George noticed.
After Lucius had pushed Harry into a wall, grabbed his hair and threw him to the floor, Harry made his way to his post at Malfoy’s office, who had not arrived yet. Harry’s hands trembled behind his back; his whole body felt weak. Beads of sweat dripped down his forehead as the pain in his face drilled into him.
“Sorry,” mumbled Malfoy unexpectedly, attempting to clean up the blood on Harry’s cheek.
“Thank you, Mrs Malfoy,” said Harry as tears threatened to fill his eyes again.
“I already told you,” he responded, looking at Harry finally. “Il semble que je ne peux que te voir.”
“I’m bored,” sighed Malfoy, pulling out a jumper and throwing it at Harry before continuing his search through the minimal clothes. “I want a day out in the muggle world. Go to a muggle café, muggle shops…” he trailed off as he pulled out some jeans, huffing before chucking them towards Harry, too.
“He will rot there,” said the minister of France, and Draco couldn’t help but feel anger burning inside him. But, unlike younger Draco, he stayed quiet, keeping his lips tightly pressed together. This was for a good cause, he had to keep reminding himself, this will make everything better. This will make your life better.
“Well, everyone seems to think you are laundering money, Malfoy,” one of the men said. He was tall with a stocky build, black hair slicked back smartly. They all wore suits, Harry noticed.
“Then stop checking the time,” said Harry, grabbing Ron’s arm gently and looking at him.
Once the quaint cottage was out of sight, Malfoy abruptly stopped, causing Harry to nearly knock into him.
“You useless fucking half-blood,” Lucius spat in Harry’s face, then slapped him hard. “Harry fucking Potter. Salazar knows why my son argued to have you work for us,” Lucius lifted up his cane and whipped it on Harry’s cheek, cutting it open. Harry didn’t say anything. Back in Hogwarts, he would have fought back, had a snarky comment for Lucius before using Stupefy on him. But now, he remained silent, fixating on an object across the room to avoid the tears from streaming down his face. He didn’t want to cry because of the pain from Lucius’ cane. He wanted to cry because he could not believe this was now his life. His freedom had been completely stripped away from him, everything he and others fought for in Hogwarts, everything others had died for, all gone.
“Children, please!” huffed Hermione, attempting to control her wild kids at the dinner table. Harry was now pleasantly buzzed, an attempt to ignore the thoughts rushing through his mind every time he looked over at George, who was now drunk.
“I’m here,” said Harry quietly as they stood at the doors on their own, Malfoy staring at them. He nodded slowly, before stepping forwards, the doors opening automatically for them.
That was all it said. There was no mention of last night, of the fun they had together, of the kiss. Was the kiss even real? The events of last night were so fuzzy in Harry’s brain he couldn’t remember if it had actually happened or not. Surely it had, right? After all, Malfoy had left a note pushed under his door.
“I’m glad to hear it,” said Ron with a proud smile on his face. This was the first time George had accepted proper help. The most he had done before was seeing a mind healer once a week. Even after his attempt, he refused to seek treatment for years. There was no doubt in Harry’s mind that Ron wasn’t extremely proud of his big brother for being so brave. And Harry was proud, too.
He was gone.
“Draco!” yelled Harry, seeing the limp body heaped on the grass. Kneeling down beside him, Harry rolled Draco’s body over.
Harry noticed. “Just put it on the bed,” he said, to which Malfoy did.
“Where did you learn about muggle food and get the money from?” asked Harry as he sat down opposite him, genuinely intrigued by Malfoy’s knowledge.
Removing her hand, Narcissa flashed him one more smile, before walking back towards the garden. Harry stood there, frozen. The words replayed through his mind, over and over again.
As Harry went to take a few empty flutes to the kitchen, he heard two voices quietly talking.
Without thinking, Harry walked over to Malfoy and pulled him into a hug. At first, he was stiff, but then he sank into Harry’s arms, resting his forehead on Harry’s shoulder, burying his face into his shirt. They stood in this embrace for a while, it felt as though Malfoy hadn’t had a hug in years.
“No problem. Ron has been a great member of staff for me. If you need anything in regards to your treatment that you are struggling to get, let me know.”
“Yeah, I’m sure we can squeeze you in,” said George, “it’ll be nice to have someone else around for a change.”
“Malfoy?” muttered Harry, making his presence known. Instantly Malfoy jolted up and looked at Harry, but he couldn’t hide the tears that were still dripping down his cheeks and the red puffy eyes.
