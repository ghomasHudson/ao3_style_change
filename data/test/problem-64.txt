"You have to at least PRETEND like everything is normal."  Draco said, then laughed as Harry tilted his head back and lolled listlessly against the couch they were sitting on in the Room of Requirement.  "Drama queen."
“Because of what it meant to you.  I know where you stand.  I know that even if your parents never really change what they believe, they’re being watched by you.”
Frowning, he picked it up, not sure who would be texting him at this time of day.  He managed a faint smile when he saw Neville's name and unlocked his phone to read the text:
"My mother?  Why?"  Draco's tone was immediately defensive, his hackles raised in obvious protection of his mother.
"New Professor."  Harry said, then frowned as he looked at Ron and Hermione who were staring at him.  "What?"
Harry- Yes you can ask an Auror to go to Gringotts for you.  Actually, write up your withdrawal form and give it to one of the Aurors, I'll go myself since I'll be coming to see you soon.
But all the while he smiled, made small talk, discussed television shows and went to meetings, he always felt like an absolute fake.  At least Dean hadn't known he was an absolute fake the whole time.  Life would have been easier that way.
Draco sat at his desk, his elbows on the surface and hands squeezed tight in his hair as he looked down on the latest owl from Harry.
“How many?”  Draco looked slightly taken aback for a moment before shaking his head.  “I don't know.  You create them by committing murder.  You kill someone and that sort of creates the right circumstances to split your soul.  The book made it sound like it was a perfectly ghastly process.”
"Fuck OFF!"  Harry got to his feet, giving Draco a shove, which didn't do much with the water resistance around them.  "Just shut your mouth."
It was so dark.  A night with heavy clouds so neither stars nor moon could be seen, let alone share light with the ground.  Harry stood on the covered bridge, his hands in his pockets as he waited.
"You should move camp tomorrow." Draco finally spoke first, not meeting Harry's eyes, though he kept his arms around him.
“Dumbledore.”  Draco spoke the one word answer, then turned his head quickly as this time Harry faltered and shifted at his response.  He couldn't help but wonder if now he had gone too far.  If this would be the line drawn between them and this new friendship.  If this was the one thing Harry wouldn't be able to accept...
Harry smiled a bit, letting out a soft breath as he nodded.  "You're right.  It's just... easier to accept the threat to yourself.  Harder to accept the threat to those you care about."
But he isn't ready for and doesn't anticipate the wave of memories that come from being there again....
Draco nodded without saying anything, unable to say anything as Harry got him out of the bathroom.  They were lucky it was dinner time, there was no one in the wide corridors as Harry half ran half pulled Draco with him towards the only place he could think of that they could go and be totally left alone.
Harry shook his head, stepping closer again and leaning in to inhale close to Draco's hair, one hand resting on the smaller boy's thigh for balance without thinking of it.  "No it's quite nice, actually..."
Going to the window he looked out and saw who he was sure were two Aurors trying to over power a third person.  The third person was the one shouting, and without a doubt what he was shouting included Draco's name.
His father's voice was hot and eager in his ear, urging him and prodding him uncomfortably to look at Harry and confirm it was him.
"I suppose Draco never did surface then."  Harry spoke casually, serving himself chicken and some potatoes.
When Astoria and Scorpius left, Draco stopped using most of Malfoy Manor and had half the house at least closed off with sheets over the furniture and spells sealing everything in place and against rot.  He, Narcissa and the House Elf spent the next day undoing the spells, removing the sheets and getting everything looking well lived in again.
Draco raked his teeth over his lower lip as he looked at the other boy, meeting the level green gaze and sighing after a few moments, well and truly giving over to the desire to share it all with him. “Voldemort set me a task to do this year.”  He started, looking at Harry for a few moments, then turning his head to glance around the room.  “It's big... it's... awful.”
Certainly, Harry had seemed perfectly genial and even friendly (which thrilled him to no end, but no one need know about THAT) but that was just who he was.  Same as accepting his apology, he liked to find the good in everyone, he liked to be friendly.
Harry said, his voice a little lower than before.  A tone that made a tingle slither up Draco's back for some reason as he raised his head to meet the dark haired man's eyes.
He was glad when they were done and heading out.  Hermione and Ron pushing ahead to lead the first year Gryffindor's to the portrait of the Fat Lady, while Harry lingered again, managing to fall into step behind Draco and his two hulking cronies.
Harry raised both hands with a sharp sigh and went out the door.  “Lock this behind me!”  He called, his final parting words.
He rested his hands against his chest, staring up at the ceiling as he pressed one hand over his heart, a habit he had started when the panic attacks did, to reassure himself that it still worked okay.  That it still beat as it should most of the time.
He finished with the cherries, tipping them into the bowl and letting them mix while he prepared his baking pans.  He carefully cut parchment paper by hand to line them, then poured an equal amount of batter into all four of them.  He slid the full pans into the oven and closed the door, carefully sliding his wand out again to tap the oven with, springing it to life magically to take care of baking his cakes.
“I had a feeling you'd get it.  I figured I might as well put it to you the way anyone who didn't have your best interests in mind would do it.  Could you tell it was coming?”
"I thought you liked Weasley and Granger."  Draco spoke the words far more directly than anything else he'd said to Harry thus far about his shift in personality.  They came out before he even thought about it.  And they hung there in silence for long enough that his heart started to flutter in his chest just a little bit.
He gave Harry a shove as he pulled back from him and turned to keep walking, seething with anger at the other boy.  "Stupid, stupid, stupid.." He muttered to himself.  Continuing to walk without caring if Harry was behind him or not.  Partly because he was angry with him and partly because he was angry that he could still feel the press of Harry's lips against his palm where his hand had been over his mouth.
“You don't have to.  I'm not in the business of selling people things that won't work for them, or selling them things they don't really need.  You're new to town, I'm guessing?”  He smiled when Draco nodded, closing the box on the Macbook again.  “It's a small town.  If I cheat people here then I'd be out of business fast.”
"Yeah.. I.."  Draco shook his head a bit, looking away for a moment before back at Harry again.  "Honestly I was crying in relief more than anything else.  Just..."
For time that stretched seemingly endless the only sound in the hallway was soft slick noises, short gasps of breath, low noises of pleasure that neither of them wanted to escape and let the other one hear, and the shift of fabric grinding tightly against fabric.
"Not really."  He replied, sitting up a bit and smiling.  "Likely seems a bit tame after the Inquisitorial Squad Umbridge had him on last year.  Reckon he'd rather be back to that.  Can't blame him."  He shrugged again, leaning forward to try and look out into the walkway, wondering when the lunch trolley would show up.
Harry read it, but he did so while he had Draco wrapped in tight against him.  He squeezed the other boy as Draco cried silently but steadily, letting him read the letter three times.
“I have noticed that, yes.  And I am very grateful to you for that, Potter.”  Draco smiled as he spoke.  It was a small smile but it was quite genuine because he was, indeed, very grateful.
Before & After - Draco and Harry have one of the most convoluted, complicated, intricate and serpentine of relationships. It went on during school, it carried on after school. It stopped. And now it seems it’s starting again.
"Wings?"  Harry said, closing the magazine and looking up at Draco with a smile.  "I'm not sure that would, actually, fix anything.  It isn't like you can't fly already."
Harry trailed off then, raising one hand to touch his scar as it prickled.  It started small and was getting stronger... His mind jumped to Draco talking about the icy feeling on the back of his neck when someone was prying and he pieced it together.
Neville trailed off, taking in a breath and letting it out again slowly, only then sort of realizing how much he was saying to Draco about Harry, going pale in the cheeks though his ears stayed red.  “I probably shouldn't have told you all of that.”
He didn't say thank you.  As far as he was concerned he and Borgin had both done each other a favour and were even.  He simply left the store, letting the door close behind him as he went back down to the street and disappeared under the invisibility cloak, ready to tell Ron and Hermione what had happened.
"I don't either."  Harry said, sitting back in the chair.  "But I'm guessing she has to do with why you haven't been writing to me."
“What?”  Neville asked, turning his head to he could see Draco, knitting his brows together in confusion.
"Ron!!"  Hermione threw her napkin at her husband, acting terribly offended even though both of them, and Harry a few moments later, were all laughing.
"Keeping you here."  Harry said, walking around the table and crouching down on the floor with Draco.
"As himself in an orphanage.  Voldemort was an orphan, Dumbledore went to the orphanage to tell him he was a wizard and was entitled to go to Hogwarts.  That was one of the memories that he showed me in one of our meetings, so Voldemort put us back there.  He wanted to make sure I was telling the truth, that I recognized him and could give him details about his meeting with Dumbledore."
But if Borgin wasn't lying and the success of whatever Draco was up to did hinge on this ring...  There was every reason in the world to buy it.
"I think it's more impressive that he said yes."  Harry grinned, shifting where he was sitting cross legged on Draco's bed in the Room of Requirement version of his bedroom.  Draco was sitting facing him as well.
And he...  He couldn't see Harry.  Couldn't write to him, either.  There would be no more communication.  No more anything.
“That I can do.”  Harry said with a nod, then moved to get to his feet.  “I'll find out what I can and get you an appointment to have internet set up.  I think that you have to pay a monthly fee to have it but I assume you don't really have to care about money...”
Draco had faltered at the mention of the war, swallowing hard and stepping back towards the couch to sit down heavily against the edge of it.  He didn't want to talk about the war.  He didn't want to think about any of that.  He didn't want to hear how Neville 'didn't hold a grudge' and that he thought he was someone that had been involved involuntarily.
He had no idea if there would be anything in the house or grounds that would lead him to what happened, or where Draco was now.  But as soon as Ron and Hermione had told him Malfoy Manor was going to be sold, he knew he wanted it.  Didn't even have to think about it, he wanted it.  He wanted everything inside.  He wanted to rifle through everything, find all the secret hiding places, search the grounds, and maybe, just maybe, turn up a lead somewhere.
"Liar.  Tell me why and I'll leave you alone.  I'll even leave the bathroom entirely if that's what you want."
When they got to a room on an upper floor that had been a study, Harry paused in the doorway, hesitating as he stared at the desk against one wall.
This memory was sharp.  Incredibly vivid and seemed realer than real.  The other memories he had seen had seemed perfectly clear and normal but it wasn't until he walked into this one of Tom's that he realized that others had been ever so slightly out of focus.
Decorating was a breeze, he did a couple with magic to see what they were supposed to look like, then did a few more, carefully undoing a couple of the perfect flourishes and things, knowing that he couldn't be spot on perfect, not the first week and not every week, and messing up in the finishing touches was easy.  And actually kind of fun.
All of them sealed and all with Harry's name on the front as though he really did expect to send them.
He looked down at his pinky where the thin line of silver was.  It seemed duller somehow, not as silver as before and harder to see than when he put it on.  He could feel it, though, and had found that he enjoyed it's presence.  Even if it didn't do anything.
Draco just shrugged, clearly he didn't have an answer.  It didn't really matter and both of them knew that.  What mattered was that they were there, together, face to face for the first time in months.
“Malfoy.” Harry said in return, surprised when the corners of Draco's lips tugged upwards slightly, making his own do the same for a moment before he forced them down into a frown.
He cleared his throat softly, touching his glasses, then held his hand with the chain back out to Draco who immediately shook his head.
“Do.... On the internet...”  Draco frowned slightly, tucking his lower lip between his teeth as though this was a VERY serious question that required very deep thought.  “Surf.. it...”  He'd read that as the term.  You 'surfed' the internet.. Surely that was correct....
Harry exhaled a breath he hadn't even realized he'd been holding, shaking his head a bit.  "That's amazing.."
Draco watched Harry's face, always so open and easy to read, and he saw a mixture of different emotions parade across it while the other man clearly processed what he'd said, eventually meeting Draco's eyes again to speak.  "So she wanted out because you weren't the person she thought you were."
"Well he goes to Death Eater meetings and Order of the Phoenix meetings.  Dumbledore swears he's a spy for their side and Voldemort thinks he's a spy for his side.  Which is it?"  Harry raised one shoulder, tilting his head a bit as he smiled at Draco, then let himself out the door and went down to the compartment he'd started off in to pretend like he gave a crap about everything they would be talking about.
"Nothing."  Harry said, shaking his head and chuckling a bit as he leaned back in his chair.  "I've just not seen the sharp tongued Draco Malfoy in a very,
Harry laughed with him, poking the side of his shoulder a few times before he rested back again, knitting his hands over his stomach as he just watched the other boy for a few moments.  “Maybe we should be focusing on your task instead...”
"Thank you."  He said quietly,  turning his head out of Harry's grasp, trying to make it clear that he was done with him now.
Harry didn't answer right away, trying to fight with the awareness of Tom being so close to him.  A feeling that was as disconcerting as it was alluring and it was incredibly confusing.  But he tipped his head up to meet the other boy's gaze, silent for a few moments as he tried to decide how to answer, then opted to go for absolute honesty.
“I do need your wand.”  Harry said, far more gently than he probably should have given the fact that Draco had taken it back from him and used it in his absence.
But as soon as the drawer was open enough for a Galleon to escape, that's exactly what it did, soaring out of the drawer and through the (thankfully) open window.
With help from Neville he crossed the short space and sank down onto the cushions with a groan.  He leaned over, his forehead almost touching his knees, his hands knitted over the back of his head as he felt the couch dip next to him.
The incantations Hermione had just taught him, would actually help him locate the missing items. He was to tap the spot and say the first incantation which would search for it within the house.  If nothing happened he could say the second part and it would send the spell out to look away from the house.  It wasn't immediate, and Hermione admitted she had never used the incantation because anything she was looking for (or, more often, Ron was looking for) always ended up being in the house, so she never had to use the second part.
He'd spent the past fifteen minutes walking back and forth in this hallway, trying to convince himself to stop and knock.
Harry smiled as he came through the archway and into the tower, looking around a bit before he moved to where Draco was, leaning his back against the wall and sliding down to sit on the floor.
He leaned over to turn on the lamp next to the couch, making a sharp sound and squeezing his eyes closed as the sudden light blinded him.
"You called me a reptile."  He grouched at Harry, stepping forward to the edge of the bath, now quite aware that he was naked and had been giving Harry a full view of it since he walked in.  All he could do now was pretend he didn't care, slipping into the water and moving as far away from Harry as he could get.
Harry said the words quietly and warmly as he looked at Draco who was still keeping his eyes down.  He reached across the couch cushion, sliding his hand over the back of Draco's lightly.  He didn't say anything but smiled when Draco's hand turned over and his long cool fingers slid between the spaces of his own.
Draco shifted a bit, turning his head so he could see Harry better. "I feel like there's something more going on with this than I know about."
Draco nodded and waved when Harry turned to go, wishing he could be that nonchalant.  That confident and easy with things.  He didn't know what was going on in Harry's head, so he might be wrong.  But to him it seemed like Harry just... decided things and that was that.  He liked something or didn't like something and there was no agony over the choice.
“So, Harry.” Tom said, turning a bit and beckoning the other boys to follow him back into the sitting room off the entryway where he had apparently been waiting for them.  “Our connection doesn't exactly let us read each other's minds, but I could tell you were rather fierce about something.  So I may have peeked, just a bit...”
Draco laughed, scrunching his nose up at what Harry said, shaking his head as he reached for a sandwich.  They ate in silence for awhile before Draco broke to ask something he'd been dying to since they exchanged owls a few days before.
"No...?"  Harry shook his head, his brows knitting slightly as he tried to recall anything he might have heard.  But nothing came to him.  It had actually been years since anyone had even said the name 'Malfoy' to him, even if he did think the name daily.  This pricked his senses.  If Ron and Hermione were talking to him about this, maybe now, finally, they had utterly forgotten his 'madness' right after the war.
"Nothing.  I just don't feel like I should be the one to leave." He tried to affect his self satisfied drawl rather than the defensive reflex he was really feeling in the words.
“Quite powerful.  But you also have to have very strong and clear focus and purpose and you have to be able to sustain the energy that you're directing to fix the cabinet for quite a long time.  It's not easy to do, if your mind wanders for even a fraction of a second the spell won't work.”
“You'll have to have someone teach you how to cook.”  Harry said, looking at Draco rather sternly.  “And how to do the washing up.”
“I feel perfectly fine, thank you.  I just don't feel like trying to justify why I want something or need to know something to you anymore.”  He snapped at Harry, rather viciously and sharply.  He'd held his tongue on being rude before, but even just the gentle prod was enough to send him over the edge.
Chapter Summary -  Harry, Ron and Hermione are heading back to Hogwarts and Harry, for one, can't wait to maybe get a little space.  Even from his closest friends...  He's tired of talking about what Draco might be up to.  It just doesn't seem to be their business...  And even he IS up to something, Harry is sure he has a good reason for it.
"In school...  In the war.  After the war.  The years we didn't see each other.  Every time you nodded at me at the school train.  When I watched you go to Eeylops.  When you told me about the Dementors and your cousin...  Always been there.  Hasn't changed."
"I should ask YOU that.  You aren't even a Prefect anymore, but still think you have a right to be in here?"
Draco has been writing letters to Harry for years. The first one he wrote he really did mean to send, but then he didn't... Since then he has been writing letters, sealing them, and putting them in a drawer. They're personal, and therapeutic, they tell Harry everything... But they're never ACTUALLY supposed to be sent to him...
“What?”  Draco looked at Harry like he didn't believe him, sliding back onto one of the counter stools and reaching to pull his phone towards him.  “You're exaggerating.  They go up and down, that's all that anyone needs to know.”
Narcissa said nothing for awhile.  Draco knew she had heard him, but also knew that by the length of time it was taking her to answer that it wasn't going to be good.  That they had very little time.
He was in the midst of examining a box of what was supposedly 'macaroni and cheese' while contemplating lunch as it was starting to get towards noon and he'd forgone breakfast when he heard a knock on the door. He got up rather eagerly to answer it, thinking it must be Neville since he seemed to be the only person that came to see him.
"Look.." Harry leaned across the table, reaching for one of Draco's hands and holding it tightly in both of his own.  "Kingsley had no idea what I was talking about.  When I went to see him and started railing on him for even considering to let Lucius out of Azkaban he looked at me like I'd grown a second head.  He told me there was no current or ANY future plans to release Lucius from Azkaban.  I told him what happened with your mother.  He started poking around and..."
“Alright I admit it.  I am poking in your head for anything about me...  But if you think my brain isn't full of memories about YOU, you're very wrong.”  Draco stretched an arm out, jabbing the front of Harry's shoulder with the blunt tip of his wand.  “You just need to get better at this, then you can go prying around in my head.”
Harry took another bite of toast then made a face as he looked over Draco's shoulder.  “Snape alert, I better get back to my table before he gives me detention for daring to fraternize with my fellow students.”
"My marriage is a sham and it has been from day one."  Draco said, letting out a short sigh.  "Astoria didn't like me, didn't from the start once she realized I wasn't the nasty bad boy she thought I was.  We gave you a grandson, we parted ways.  Quite amicably as you've seen when we appear together.  I highly doubt she cares in the LEAST what I'm doing.  She dates, mother, and I'm quite happy for her that she does."
"You're...  Bad with time."  Draco couldn't help but laugh, it fell out of him in a low chuckle as he shook his head, reaching to start balling up his attempt at a letter to the other man.
Stupid, stupid, STUPID! He said again, but in his head as he pressed up into Harry, kissing him back hard and deep.  The voice calling him stupid was being very thoroughly ignored.  He couldn't have listened to it if he'd tried.  Not now, not while Harry's lips were pressed against his own.
“They’ll never change.  Not really.” Draco admitted, raking his teeth over his lower lip and looking away from Harry.  “But you still testified for all of us.”
"I am right." Narcissa said, and said it with the sort of no questions tone only mothers had, which made it impossible not to believe her.
Had the stranger Confunded the Aurors?  Surely they wouldn't be so poorly trained that someone could hit three of them with the same spell while they were being held back.  But there didn't seem to be much other explanation for what was happening...
“I suppose that makes sense.”  Draco said as though he was grudgingly accepting of it.  Inwardly he was glad.  He didn't realize someone would have to come into his flat, which he was already feeling rather comfortable in if he was honest and the idea of having some stranger in there poking at it wasn't the best. Having someone else there would be helpful, even if it was some Auror that wouldn't meet his eyes.
He took in a deep breath, coughed and let it out again slowly as he rubbed his hands against his knees.  “When I saw Potter and everyone, when we were supposed to be stopping them..  He disarmed me, took my wand, I was glad to see it gone.  Glad to see them getting away.  The only thing I was sorry about was that I couldn't go with them.”
It gave him time to try and figure out what he could and could not say to Theodore about where he was, as well as try and find out why
McGonagall looked slightly mollified by what he had to say.  Enough that she stopped gripping the back of the chair like it had wronged her somehow.   “You understand why I had to ask you.” She said, looking at him pointedly.
After a short break, they all regrouped in the cleaned up tent for the first Technical Bake.  He and Harry had experimented with this, since no one could prepare in advance for the Technical.  They weren't sure, at first, if Draco would have to know what something was supposed to look like in order for the magic to work.
“But it's busted, right?”  Ron said, trying to get back into the conversation, sitting up a bit and looking back and forth between Harry and Hermione on either side of him.  “So it doesn't matter, it's broken.”
Draco shook his head rather forcibly, not wanting to entertain that thought for too long.  He'd lost his wand, it was gone.  That in itself had made his plans for a new life in the muggle world rather necessary.  He would NEVER show his face to Ollivander again.  Not ever.  So a new wand, a good one anyway, was out of the question.
This was shit, really.  This was nothing he had wanted.  This was worse than he could have imagined, and he really deeply and desperately wanted to just walk out the door and apparate as far away as he could.  Harry had given him his wand free and clear, he'd do fine...
Draco shook his head, pushing his hands further into his pockets.  "No.  But I don't really associate with that many people to be honest.  Not anymore."
Neither of them knew that the phrase went through both of their heads that time, at the same time.  Draco's head fell forward and he looked down.  "Bullshit." He said, looking at the floor.
through Draco's veins, leaving him absolutely speechless as he looked at Harry, his eyes as blazing as grey eyes could be.  "That nasty... Of all the...." He spat the words out in unfinished sentences, absolutely livid.
Draco rolled his eyes, rubbing a hand against the back of his neck as he bit his tongue.  He'd figured out what it was that was so different between Harry and Neville and his interactions with them thus far.
“I'll just order things from Diagon...”  Draco said with a scoff, folding his arms against his chest.  “I won't need to buy anything in Muggle shops.”
The two of them started arguing together which gave Harry time to just tune out and absorb everything he had just heard.  There was a spell to fix the cabinet, that part turned out to be incredibly easy.  But unfortunately it was incredibly easy because the spell itself was incredibly hard.
Harry was silent for a few moments.  Long enough that Draco started to feel uncertain about what was going on behind those dark eyes.  Then he closed the very small distance between them.  The hand in the side of Draco's robes moved, curling in the front of them up closer to his throat, then he pulled, forcing Draco's head down with a small noise of surprise.
They'd taken to going to the Room of Requirement that always presented itself as Draco's bedroom in Malfoy Manor fairly regularly.  This was the fifth or sixth time they'd met there.  Always with the most subtle of planning.  An eye caught in class or across the Great Hall.  A note stuck in a pocket in the hall when they passed, bumping shoulders and sneering at each other in a combative way.
Was that wrong?  No...  That responsibility weighed heavily on him and probably always would.  It had changed him, though he was changed long before that.  But the war itself, it changed him entirely.
“Tough lot, mate..”  Ron said, stretching his arms about his head.  “I don't know how you put up with the guy.”
"I think so.."  Harry said, looking over at Sanguini (having overheard an introduction so knowing his name), a guest of a guest at the party.  "I've never seen one before I don't know for sure, but the name kind of gives him away."
"You can't come back, can you."  Harry said eventually, rubbing a hand against his arm.  "How did you even find me in the first place?"
But when he looked at Draco, looked at his face.  The purple shadows painted deeper than ever under his eyes.  The paleness of his skin and the depths of his eyes that had nothing but anguish in them, he knew it was true and he knew why it was true.
Draco tilted his head, absolutely impassive and unfeeling to the slight change that came from Harry as soon as he explained. “Now...  You can continue to berate me and blame me for things before actually learning what happened, in a manner much more fitting of our school days, but I don't believe I'm under any obligation to stand here and take it.”
He chanced a look back at Harry again when the silence stretched, and couldn't help but smirk at the absolutely perplexed look on his face.
"Exactly."  Harry said, grinning even more as he held it forward on his palm for Draco to look at more closely.
"Please be safe..." Harry said quietly, reaching one hand out to touch Draco's cheek, the only thing he felt he could safely do.  More than that and he might have grabbed the other boy and refused to let go for anything.
He looked at them for a few moments, curled around his wand, then deposited them into a small vial that he then held out to Harry.
Harry watched him pick up his things, waving at him in a bit of a confusion as Draco left, waiting until he was gone before he turned the parchment over in his hand to read it.
His mother was sitting at his desk, in front of her were stacks of letters.  Letters in his handwriting.
"We?"  Draco asked, tilting his head a bit, his eyes turning down for a moment, then back up to Harry's face.  "You really mean it, don't you."
“Huh..”  He once again made a vague mono-syllabic noise as a response, nodding slowly as he tapped his fingers against the counter.  “He seemed so pleased in the Prophet about getting married.  All that talk about settling down, having kids brought up in a world without Voldemort..”
"Nevermind then..." Harry said quietly, reaching to pick up the second mug, holding it cradled in his palms.  "Just...  We'll just sit."
“No no, of course not.”  Neville laughed, shaking his head.  “But if you don't want to do it now, do you maybe want to go for a walk?”
He'd never held one of his friends the way he did Draco.  His friends didn't melt into him and cling to him like he was the only thing keeping them afloat.  He never would have considered hugging Ron or Hermione like this.
He felt cold creeping up through him, starting in his hands and feet.  Sometimes it didn't get this bad.  Sometimes he could avoid this part of it, breathe through it, get enough air in that his system didn't shock like this.  Not this time, though, and he braced himself for the cold to overtake him entirely, waited for darkness to close him, that was at least an end to this.  He'd come to in awhile.  He could deal with the fall out, the 'after shocks' of a panic attack, later.
Draco- Well most of it went to the phone. Which I assume is not what it was for and so I considered it a loan until I could get money from my account to pay it back.  But as I am not allowed to use any magic what so ever, I can't get the money myself.
"Is this the last room?"  Draco asked after a long minute of silence, not wanting to discuss the subject further.
“You said in your letter that it was about Scorpius.” Draco said as he sat down, his silver-grey eyes seeming to probe the dark haired man in front of him.  “Is he alright?”
"I never said it was a small task, I said it was one we needed help with.  I find it strange that you would make an Unbreakable Vow to help Draco kill Dumbledore if he couldn't do it himself, but you seem to balk at the idea of a clear line of communication."
"Cat got your tongue?"  Harry asked rather lazily, shifting under water on the ledge that ran around the inside edge of the tub to sit on, watching Draco as he processed everything that had just been given to him.
Harry moved on reflex, stepping back and whipping his wand out as well, braced and ready to fire back at whatever Tom was about to throw his way.
The stillness that followed Harry's words seemed unnatural even for a dream.  He tried very hard to keep the serious look on his face, willing his nerves to stay clamped down and not show one iota of weakness as he and Tom watched each other, staring each other down.
"You accuse me of smelling sweet, this water smells like a vanilla explosion."  Draco said, then raised his eyebrows slightly when he saw Harry go a little pink.  "Ohhh...  You can't possibly..."
I won't send it to you, and it's silly for me to say I won't send it to you when I'm the only one who's reading it anyways. I don't know why I said that. Or all of this.
"I don't really know which ones I used but it wasn't quite this...  My towels still smell of it, did you want one?"
After they'd helped Kreacher down to the basement with his new treasures and watched for a few minutes while he rummaged in the bags and started hopping around cramming things on dusty shelves and rock ledges, they went back upstairs and Draco got his coat on.
Harry nodded, his shoulders squaring a bit in a gesture Draco had to admit he rather liked.  The other boy had gotten so broad in the past year and..
Harry's hand reached forward that small ways between them, his fingers slid against Draco's ribs under the water.  Draco felt his eyes close, a small breath shuddering from his lips as he shook his head.  "I should mean it."
Draco still hesitated.  He'd only been in the Forest once before and that was years ago.  He didn't have particularly fond memories of it and he knew that even those not fond memories were quite light compared to what else was in there.
Draco smiled, just watching the other man for a few moments before he spoke again.  "I can't be seen with you in public.  At least.. not right now."
"This isn't funny!"  He said a bit louder, swallowing roughly as his mouth went dry.  "Come on Harry!  Where are you??"
Aside from the day he left when he'd been in Diagon Alley, he hadn't ventured into public at all.  And his presence that day was watery in the memories of those who had seen him.  Muddled together with a dozen other things that they'd seen and heard that day, he could have easily been just some other blonde boy.
“It didn't.”  Harry said, leaning forward, his chin jutting out a bit in defiance.  “You're punishing him for his parents.”
"But I should help you with the good essay."  Harry tapping one finger lightly against Draco's shoulder.  "I shouldn't have the easy time writing the bad essay while you have to do painstakingly good work."
Draco couldn't breathe for a minute, and when he did it can in an embarrassingly obvious rush.  There was nothing leading in what Harry said, not really.  And yet....
Harry spoke the words angrily to Draco who scowled at him as they walked across the grounds towards the forest.  It absolutely was NOT his fault.  He hadn't asked Harry to fire a jinx at him from across the room.  He didn't suggest the other boy aim wildly and instead of hitting him, hit the pile of Malevolent Bloom on Professor Slughorn's desk.  If HE had been the one jinxing Harry, he wouldn't have missed.  Wouldn't have hit the flowers that Slughorn himself had gathered just for class.  He would have hit HIM and then they wouldn't be out in the night to gather more of the blasted plant as detention.
Harry tilted his head,  gesturing with his chin towards the Vanishing Cabinet half buried in the pile of stuff.  “You had a good idea in using that.  And honestly, I think that what we need more than anything else right now is a way to get out of Hogwarts to talk.”
"Sure."  Draco said, tilting his head a bit and raising his eyebrows.  "Between figuring out the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  Or dealing with Umbridge and no one believing you that Voldemort was back.  Or maybe in year six when you were having those extra lessons and learning all about Voldemort's history.  At the very LEAST during the year you were on the run looking for the Horcruxes.  I'm sure it was weighing very heavily on your mind to have a discussion about your sexuality in the middle of all of that..."
Chocolate...  Ganache?  He thought that was what it was supposed to be.  Merlin, it was hard to think with so much going on.
Both boys were quiet for awhile, neither of them liking the idea of having to go back to life as it was before.
I will confirm that it IS a magical object.  Borgin's explanation of it had nothing to do with Harry's reaction to it.  Borgin himself doesn't think that the ring is anything much but metal because all it did was make him question what he wanted for lunch every day.
“It doesn't sound like a good one.”  Draco got up as well and moved to join the other boy.  “What is it?”
“Lovely to see you as well.”  Harry said with a smirk, stepping into the flat and closing the door when Draco turned to walk back towards the kitchen area.  “Why do you have food all over your counters?”
"Draco.." Harry tilted his head a bit as he looked at the other boy silently for a few moments.  "The thing is that...  So many people are sacrificing themselves for me.  So that I can face off against Voldemort.  I didn't ask for this life, I didn't sign up of volunteer for it.  But the heart of the thing is that if I had just died when Voldemort cursed me, none of this would be happening right now."
Draco had stopped trying to seize Harry's arm, but he did nudge the other boy into walking up the hallway as he looked around and listened.  He was clearly trying to process so Harry stayed quiet, looking around with more interest now knowing that this was Malfoy Manor.
Draco watched Harry as he raged.  The longer the other man yelled and the more he said, the higher Draco raised his chin and the more firmly he set his shoulders.  By the time Harry paused for breath, Draco had gotten to his feet and could have easily doubled for an ice cube in any freezer.
Eventually he knew it was either do it, or put it off for the night.  And that second option wasn't one he would take.  He couldn't just put things off, Draco didn't have the luxury of time to pamper Harry's vanity and pride.
“I had reason.”  Draco said, his voice dropping a bit.  His eyes stayed down and he fiddled with his wand a bit as he stayed quiet for awhile, not even glancing up at Harry before he spoke again barely above a whisper.  “It turned me on.”
“I don't plan to do much experiencing.”  Draco muttered darkly, huffing out a breath and pushing to sit back in the padded bench.
“You think I taught him to be?” Draco asked, leaning forward a bit.  “You aren’t someone to be afraid of, I wouldn’t have taught him that.”
"Impressive academic career."  Draco said, crossing his legs and settling into his chair more comfortably.  "And you fancied becoming an Auror with a record like that."
Eventually Harry raised his head again and looked at Draco curiously.  "Did you apologize to Astoria for things not working out with you?"
"You can use my owl, that's fine." Harry looked up at him and smiled, reaching a hand out again but just lightly touching the back of his.  "It's going to be okay."
Whatever Harry had found out, considering how long it had taken him, likely wasn't good.  There was nothing that could be done.
Draco left first again a few minutes later, making sure the halls were clear before slipping out of the room.  Harry sighed a looooong deep breath as he processed everything they had just talked about and looked around the room.
Draco held his breath, he hated himself for being so hopeful and thinking so much of something so simple.  But he couldn't help it.  This strange, tentative-but-growing friendship he and Harry had started meant way too much to him.  Logically he knew he should temper it and try not to pin so much on it.  But he WANTED it.  And Draco was decidedly terrible at denying himself anything he wanted.
“No one thinks you're crazy, mate.”  Ron said, though he did actually think Harry might be a little unstable.  “But you've been through hell in life, yeah?  You deserve a break.”
"Ugh..  They freak me out."  Draco said with a bit of a shudder.  "I liked it better when I couldn't see them."
And the rest..  It blurred through his mind in a tumble, far less clear than it was in Harry's memory.
Luckily the work was engrossing and he quickly lost himself in it,  forgetting that he wasn't alone as Harry was working silently across the floor from him.  He made it halfway through the assignment before he started to run into problems.  He moved the telescope around in the quadrant of sky he was supposed to be observing, unable to locate what he was looking for not matter how carefully he looked or slowly he moved across the small space of sky.
“This is one of your memories.”  Harry said, realization hitting him.  He looked up the short way to Tom's face for confirmation that he didn't really need.
As much as he wanted to up and leave, and as much as his old self would have done it regardless of who had done what for him, he couldn't.  Not now..
"Yeah of course.  I didn't want that.  Not just because it overlapped Cedric being Champion but because I didn't WANT to do all the trials.  Regardless of what you or any of your friends think, I don't really like risking life and limb all the time.  I'd much rather just live a normal average life."
April of Year 6.  Draco keeps disappearing and Harry manages to corner him to question him.  But if he wants answers, he has to pay for them.
Only by claiming detention that night and putting on his coat to leave the Castle had he been able to get away.  He'd used a school Owl to send a message to Draco that just said 'covered bridge'.  He hoped that it had been anonymous enough to anyone who might have seen the note that it wouldn't have made sense.
“That was it?  Why on earth would Dumbledore waste time with it.  He'd be able to see through it enough to know Slughorn actually told me about them..”
Harry turned to look at Draco who was wiping at his cheeks, his hair mussed and clothing rumpled.  "Why did the room bring us here?"
"I don't honestly know.  He hasn't ever given me a straight answer about important things.  He says it's to better understand you, but given that he's not once ever told me the whole truth about anything, I doubt that's the only reason."  Harry couldn't keep the slightly angry and bitter tone out of his voice as he talked about Dumbledore and his secrets.
“You will regrade both essays.”  McGonagall said, handing both to Snape while keeping her eyes on Harry and Draco.  “And you two... may go...”
"Fair enough.  I'll stop making jokes at the expense of potentially violent guests when it might get you into trouble."  Harry turned his head, then squeezed Draco's arm as he leaned in close enough to whisper to him.  "What about particularly greasy guests?"
Narcissa spoke stiffly, and unless Borgin was mistaken there was a trace of fear there.  On the surface her loyalty was worn proud, but under it was the imprisonment of her husband, and whatever task Draco had been set up to do.
Harry shook his head, shifting in the chair to turn towards Draco a bit.  "The day we were all in Diagon Alley.  I saw you on your own and followed you to Borgin and Burkes.  Overheard you talking about him...  Friend of the family or not, I figured it was possible he was threatening you.  But it isn't him."
"Say no right now and I'll stop."  Harry said, looking Draco square in the eyes.  His hands were stilled between them, waiting for Draco to respond.
Silence stretched almost uncomfortably long, Malfoy's brows knitting as he tried and seemingly failed to find the veiled threat or insult in Harry's words.  He tilted his head, looking at the dark haired boy curiously as Harry looked back at him.
He didn't hear form him the next day either, which was fine considering he and his mother had a lot to do.
"Stop it."  Draco said, covering himself with his hands, turning around to glare at the other boy.  "Why do you want to look so bad, huh?"
He turned, thumping his back against the stone wall, sliding down it to sit on the floor, resting his head on his knees as he tried to get his breath back.  If it was a test, he had definitely failed.
“Yes, of course.” Harry said as he stacked his papers and moved them to the side so he could have some clear space between him and Draco.  “It’s nothing truly terrible, I don’t think...  I just wanted to have this conversation with you face to face.  Scorpius is doing well in class but he seems... frightened.”
"I didn't think there was any way for them to overturn his ruling when I first got the letter.  I thought perhaps it was due course and they were simply making sure they did all of their homework.  That everything with the war was so far done now they were getting to the very last and final dregs that didn't even really matter.  I didn't want to worry you for no reason."
Draco stayed quiet for a few moments, smirking a bit to himself.  An expression that was reminiscent of his days in Hogwarts.  Eventually, shifting to cross his legs at the knee more comfortably he spoke again, careful with how he worded things.
He felt awfully driven to do it, though.  He wanted to know more now, SO much more...  He wanted every little bit of information he could get.
If anyone had asked him what the 'worst case scenario' was with this set up, he wouldn't have said it was getting caught and killed by whoever the 'new power' out there was.  It would have been having Harry fucking Potter find out about and then witness one of his panic attacks.
Narcissa didn't speak right away.  She spent probably a good five minutes just LOOKING at Draco and Harry.
Harry watched Draco move back to the couch, puzzled when the other boy took out a piece of paper and a quill, thinking that he was writing out a time and day to meet.  He was about to tell him they could just agree on a time now before they left when Draco came back with a very fake and very odd smile on his face.
Harry raised one hand, rubbing the back of it against his nose as he waited for the fire and anger that came anytime someone mentioned Bellatrix to subside.  “Well that's one thing she's good for, at least.” He eventually muttered, leaning over to grab his wand again.
Both of them stayed motionless, nothing about this situation making any sense to either of them, especially not with their minds whirling and senses pricking in a way that seemed simultaneously perfectly natural and completely absurd.
“No, what was brilliant was thinking up using a Vanishing Cabinet in the first place.”  Harry said, looking admiringly at the other boy, then his face fell a bit, his shoulders visibly sagging.  “This will mean we have to play it cool for awhile.”
Instead, he swallowed the lump in his throat, leaning forward with his elbows on his lap and his face still in his hands and he thought.  He tried to organize everything he was thinking and feeling and sort it appropriately.
"In a way.  Not them, but they left and then went back with reinforcements from what Dumbledore said.  Your uncle and grandfather were taken to Azkaban.  Your mother was free of them and that's when she..."
“You think?”  Draco chuckled, leaning back against the couch as his smirk deepened.  “For weeks now you've been the one helping me.  Or at least trying to.  I've been at your command and having to beg for every little thing.  Now you need my help..”
"Add that thing with your cousin to the list of stories I want to hear about sometime." Draco said and was happy when Harry smiled.  "But go on..."
Decorating was fun again, he found he enjoyed that a great deal, even if it was once again a tricky business to make his fondant and icing look like it was smoothing on naturally.
He rubbed the spot, now perplexed about what had caused the pain, then saw the galleon sitting on the floor in front of his chair.  It had an odd red sort of bubble, and while he knew if Hermione was there she would be screeching at him to not touch it, he still leaned down to pick it up.
Harry nodded, staying quiet and raising his hand to Draco's cheek, brushing his fingers against the other boy's skin just once.  "I can imagine.  So if I guess correctly, you want your mom to get the first message and you tell her to go to the safe house for more?"
“Well..”  Neville smiled as he walked towards the door, obviously deciding to make his exit before Draco could change his mind.  Which was smart.  “You managed to talk him into keeping your wand.  I think he'll have to decide what's more important.  Getting someone else into protection who needs it, or sticking to rules that we've made up ourselves.”
"Is that why it always felt cold and smelled funny and everything stayed dim?"  Harry brought Draco back into the kitchen where Kreacher had left a feast on the table for them for lunch.
Draco slid off his stool with some effort, honestly wishing he could just go back to bed.  This was all so tedious.  Talking to Neville was work.  He knew the other man didn't mean to make it so difficult but that didn't really fix anything.
"And if you ever need anything." Draco said in return, letting go of Harry's hands with an ache and a regret that he felt would never fully resolve within him.
Harry spoke sort of quietly an in a voice that made Draco tingle with pride, looking to the dark haired boy with the sly smile.  "I try my best."
"Harry Potter.  Lowering himself to demand entrance to my store..."  Borgin looked caught between extreme amusement and extreme displeasure.
"The owl will first return here to me after it's delivery.  I will find out if the message has been sent successfully and without issue, and then it will go to the Malfoy's cottage.  When Narcissa replies, the owl will return to me, not to you or Draco."
How Harry making him angry, talking about his.. personal areas... and low key trying to gain more information about them would cause such a reaction was beyond him.  But he couldn't get out of the bath now.
Harry wanted to be angry that Draco had potentially led Voldemort straight to him, but honestly he really didn't care.  Not that much.  Not when they were both staring down the barrel of the same gun anyways.
But he could also tell from the look on Draco's face that he wasn't ready to tell him.  The blonde looked absolutely stricken.  Both, it seemed, with the forwardness of what Harry said and with the offer of help.
“Will Dumbledore know this isn't Slughorn's memory?”  Harry asked, his eyes trained on Tom's as the other boy looked down at him so avidly.
Harry didn't hesitate before jumping down to follow Draco, trying to match his almost silent footsteps on the stone floor.
"I didn't think to do it, it just came out.  That's generally what happens... logically I wouldn't have thought it would respond, but the parseltongue just.."  Harry mimed a hand from his mouth outwards.  "It comes when it does."
“I beg your pardon.” He said icily to Harry, his eyes narrowing and his arms folding across his chest.  “But I did not
Draco deflated a little at the implication.  Harry seemed to feel the wash of uncertainty that came over the blonde next to him and it made him bristle rather quickly, shooting a nasty black look at Tom.  “That isn't fair.”
Harry took in a breath and then let it out again in a rush and with a chuckle.  “Everyone else does seem to need hand holding and so much more explained to them than you do.  Half of them I don't think we have a hope in hell of EVER getting to use a Muggle cell phone, and you're over here asking for internet.”
Draco laughed, putting his face into his hands as he flushed.  “Oh Merlin don't even...  I don't want to admit to it.”
“I don't understand, though...”  Draco took a sip from his mug, looking at Neville curiously.  “How did your first one not work for you?  Thats kind of the whole point of wands.”
!?”  Draco practically shouted the words.  Neighbours be damned if they overheard.  He instinctively put his hand over the hilt of his wand where it was sticking out of his pocket.  “I certainly did not agree to that.”
"I should get home."  Draco eventually said, looking over at Harry and smiling.  "But thank you.  This was actually a lot of fun."
Draco just sat there, his brow furrowed as he looked at the window, half expecting the coin to come back.  But he realized how foolish that was rather quickly.
Feck.  They'd want to record him calling Harry to tell him the news.  He hoped he'd practiced enough with the cell phone to make it look like he used it all the time.
"He's told me that he'll do it for me.  That I don't have to do it.  Or at least not do it all by myself.  He made an Unbreakable Vow to my mother.  That if I couldn't or failed to do this task, he would do it for me."
He needed Noel's help to carry it up to the front of the room when it was his turn to be judged, setting it carefully onto the table in front of Prue and Paul.
It was a gamble and Harry knew it.  They'd been dancing around these subjects, both of them saying things that slightly leaned towards them, but never coming right out and being direct.  But having seen the Dark Mark on Draco's arm, Harry had no doubt now that whatever Draco was doing was something Voldemort had asked him to do.  And right then he couldn't think of anything he wanted more than to help Draco with whatever it was.
He made it outside and apparated home, managing to get in the door and to a chair in the foyer before the full brunt of the interaction hit him.
Where was that?  WHAT was that?  There was never warmth when it was this bad, just the cold and the dark and the inevitable gasp when he woke again.
“Violent.”  Neville said, frowning as he shook his head, reaching one hand out to smooth over Draco's shoulder, resting against it warm and heavy.
Draco has been writing letters to Harry for years. The first one he wrote he really did mean to send, but then he didn't... Since then he has been writing letters, sealing them, and putting them in a drawer. They're personal, and therapeutic, they tell Harry everything... But they're never ACTUALLY supposed to be sent to him...
Draco used his Patronus, since no one but Harry knew that he could create one, no one would assume or know it was his.
“It's still a barbaric task.  And I still think it isn't at all fair that he's put it on you...”  Harry spoke carefully, watching the other boy just as carefully.
Draco's voice cut into his mind, his full body stepping through the image in front of him and scattering it like it was made of  fog.
Harry sighed, sliding both of his hands to rest flat between them on Draco's chest, leaning back against the wall as he looked up into the other boy's silver eyes.  "So... This is it, then?"
If Harry helped him.  If Harry was actively trying to help him complete this task.  To kill Dumbledore, the only Wizard Voldemort knew he couldn't best.... Would Harry still have to die?  Would Voldemort still want him gone?
"You're looking in the wrong direction, Malfoy." Harry pointed out the window he's been looking through, then at the one Draco had been working at.  "East.  Not West."
“Potter, I doubt that would make any difference.  And if I did decide to talk to someone about it, it wouldn't be you.  And I don't mean that to be an asshole or to be offensive, it's just fact.  I wouldn't talk to you about this any more than you'd sit down and talk to me if you were struggling with something of the same kind.”
“I would have thought you had grown up by now.”  Draco said, still icy and still not moved by the apology.
Harry and Draco steal a bit of time on the train to catch up in person rather than in owl, and Harry is SO pleased to see how much Draco seems to be reforming into his old self.
As things settled around him, he took a tentative step forward and a shining black door, oddly illuminated in what was endless black, was in front of him.  He reached for the door knob, turning it and stepped into a brightly lit but very shabby little room.
When Harry finally corners Draco in the bathroom with Moaning Myrtle, he expects to demand answers to his questions. But when he finds Draco in tears and absolute despair, all he can think of is getting him somewhere safe to find out what the hell is going on...
Those words rocketed around Harry's head as he wrestled Draco to the floor of the bathroom, scuffling with him to grab his wand, shoving it into his back pocket as he forced a hand over the other boy's mouth.  "STOP..  Stop.." Harry hissed the first but said the second more quietly as Draco struggled on the ground under him.  He saw the fear in his still tear filled grey eyes and he shook his head.  "M'not going to hurt you or do anything to you.  Swear."
“Yes.”  Harry nodded, smiling faintly at Draco as he reached to pick up the wand, holding it gently as he looked at the other man.  “So if you win it from me, it will once again be rightfully yours.”
"Ah, now see...". Harry grinned, leaning his arms onto the desk so he was closer to the other man, pointing a finger at him.  "This is a
"POTTER!"  He yelled, the reflex of using Harry's last name when he was angry coming back full force.  "What in Merlin's name do you think you're doing!?"
That stopped Harry, and why wouldn’t it? Draco practically asking for death.  Seeming to not care a bit that he was alone, held fast, and had basically admitted that he was, actually, up to something.
Harry laughed properly then, and shifted a bit to get more comfortable before he started to run his fingers through Draco's hair just as he'd seen Pansy doing.
"What?"  Harry gave his head a slight shake as he drew out of the deep thoughts and refocused on what was actually going on.
"...And I know that I've spent a good part of this year throwing accusations at Draco and at Snape and at... well anyone I could think of.  But this isn't an accusation, not this time.  This is the truth and I need help to help him.  He's so scared and so lost and I'm worried he'll just give up...."
“I can’t say that if your parents ended up there I’d do much about it.  But if you did, I’d fight tooth and nail to get you back out again.”
"I'm fine.  This is just..  Very different."  Draco smiled at Harry, getting a little jolt every time he looked at him.  It was arresting to see him there.  Talking to him, interacting with him.  After so many years of animosity and then so many years of just not seeing each other or interacting at all.
“I didn't need to be out there.  My cloak was open because I pulled it on really quickly.  I saw you were out there by yourself so I went out, too.”
“Stop, Potter.”  Draco said sharply, turning his head to glare at the other man.  “Just stop.  I don't want to talk about it, and if you insist on forcing me to I'm likely to have another panic attack and then I'll be useless for this thing with Nott for another few days.  Leave it.”
“Mm...  It was a strange memory...  It was in some lady's house.  She had this tiny little shrivelled up House Elf and was getting ready because Tom was coming to visit her.  He worked for Borgin and Burkes at the time...  Apparently he was in charge of getting people to part with priceless family heirlooms or something.  He turned up, all charm and smiles and...”
Draco has been writing letters to Harry for years. The first one he wrote he really did mean to send, but then he didn't... Since then he has been writing letters, sealing them, and putting them in a drawer. They're personal, and therapeutic, they tell Harry everything... But they're never ACTUALLY supposed to be sent to him...
"It's fine.  I actually...  I like hearing that.  Not just about THIS in particular, but I like hearing what was going on in your part of the world at the same time as what was happening in mine.  It rounds things out a bit.  Things I never knew that actually fit into my timeline...  Anyways.." He shook his head, smiling as he went on.  "So we get into a bit of a scuffle and I pull my wand on him.  Which makes all his tosser mates howl with laughter, but Dudley just shuts the fuck up immediately.  He knows what the wand does and he's had a few run ins with wizards that didn't go well.  Then all of a sudden the weather turns.  The wind just goes crazy...  Dudley is yelling at me asking me what I'm doing but I didn't do anything.  We run...  And we're racing for home when all of a sudden there's dementors..."
Hermione smiled at that and Harry knew he had chosen the right thing to say.  Ron looked mollified as well and inwardly Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
“To lock the door behind you.  I know, Potter.”  Draco muttered, moving forward to push the door closed as Harry walked down the hall to the stairs. He twisted the lock before turning and thumping his back against the heavy wood of the door, trying to take in deep slow breaths of air.
"Shut UP!"  Draco sloshed water at Harry who laughed at him.  He could feel his face burning again, this was so rude.
"That's it."  Draco nodded, sliding his hand a little further onto Harry's knee.  "The whole world waiting for you to settle into your perfect little happily ever after and you didn't feel like you could do anything else. "
But he realized he was just assuming these things.  That he didn't really know for sure...  And he was fairly certain that much like Hogwarts and Grimmauld Place, a home like Malfoy Manor, so old and so thoroughly steeped in magic, could think for itself.  And if he hadn't met whatever pre-requisites it had for allowing him inside, he could assume all he wanted to and it wouldn't make any difference at all.
“But what does that have to do with me?”  He had asked, then immediately regretted it when the officials pushed their way past him and into the foyer of Malfoy Manor.
The only room he didn't touch was Sirius'.  He knew that Sirius would have had no problem with him making it over like the rest of the house but Harry couldn't bring himself to erase the last bits of his worldly presence.
Voldemort comes up with increasingly difficult and awful things that Draco, and by extension he himself, would have to do to keep proving his loyalty?
And that was more than a little uncomfortable.  Weren't his priorities warped then?  Shouldn't he want to care more about keeping Dumbledore alive than helping Draco?  How messed up had things gotten....
Harry shrugged a bit, raising his eyebrows slightly.  "I just mean Snape's been after this position forever, hasn't he?  He's bound to be good at it, teach us stuff and maybe be more hands on.  Years of preparation for it and all..."
He stepped past the treeline and walked to where Harry was, then past him in a massive display of false courage.   "Where is the bloody plant we're supposed to get anyways.  And how are we supposed to find it in the dark?"
Someone brave would not have clutched at each of harry's letters like they were life preservers and laid awake at night in agonies of guilt for letting them go unanswered.
Basically, all he ended up having an opinion on was his phone colour, and the case that went on it to protect it.
Within five minutes he was fast asleep on the couch, the remote falling the short distance to the rug from his relaxed fingers.
“I'm sorry.”  Harry eventually said, meeting Draco's eyes and very much looking sorry.  “You're... Absolutely right.”
Neville was holding him.  Neville's arms were around him, holding him in place tightly from behind, that's why he was upright but not on his own feet.
“Merlin.”  Ron said, a sugar quill stuck out of one side of his mouth.  “Bet the stupid git didn't realize he was giving you more information than he thought.”
Draco let out the breath he was holding when Harry broke the awful silence.  His fear had started saying maybe the other man had just apparated away as soon as he spoke.  But he was still there.
Draco's face fell and Harry felt like an asshole for making it happen when he had looked so happy and so hopeful for a few moments.
"I should what?"  Harry asked, his eyes narrowing a bit as Draco tread into territory he was already tired of hearing about from others around him.
(Told in chapters that vary between Before the war and after the war, and varying points of view between Draco and Harry. It is not told in any sort of order, but bounces around to slowly round out.
“I saw you stay after one of the Slub Club meetings.”  He said, his eyes turning to the side a bit as he tried to remember. “You asked Slughorn about something you came across but couldn't get any information about, I think.  Something like that.”
Draco shifted a bit as a wiggle of something hopeful and promising curled in his belly.  Even more strongly than that tiny little sliver deep inside of him, this one felt like they were turning a corner.  Like they were opening a door to changing things entirely...
He shuddered hard, grimacing and pushing back against a fresh wave of panic that swept through him.  It wasn't as serious, he could tell.  This one was an empty threat, he could shrug it off even if it was uncomfortable.
It came out in such a conversational and genial tone that Draco was clearly startled.  He stayed silent for a few moments and Harry watched his pale eyebrows knit together, clearly trying to find Harry's angle in this.  When he couldn't seem to find anything to scoff back at, Draco held up his hand that had a scroll in it.  "Professor Snape wanted McGonagall to have this."
He also never thought he would have spent the past two weeks before the baking show started learning how to chop cherries.
He tapped each cake carefully to make them instantly cool enough to work with, and tapped the raspberry one an extra time so it would cut itself perfectly in half.  He worked carefully and slowly to assemble the cake as much as he could without magic, but he did give the towering structure a gentle poke to straighten it up and solidify its supports once he was done putting it together.
"You too."  Harry said, raising a hand to wave a final goodbye to the blonde before he ducked out into the hall.
Draco was thinking about that episode again as he walked through the doors of the towering office building one weekday morning.  He kept thinking about it as he stepped into the elevator, glancing behind himself politely before he moved back towards the people who had got in first.
Okay so that wasn't terrible...  It really wasn't.  But he left feeling odd about the whole thing.  He didn't know what to make of what had been said to him.  He was so far removed from dealing with people socially, he couldn't for the life of him tell if that was just friendly kindness, or if it was something else.
"We haven't exactly been on terms where asking a question like that would be appropriate and not weird."
“Where are you disappearing to?” Harry asked, pretending his hand wasn’t still clutched in the soft back thigh belonging to Draco.
Draco laughed at what Snape said. A sharp bark of a laugh that was so full of disdain it even made Snape falter for a moment, one foot moving back even though he didn't actually take the step.  "You think I won't do it?  You just want to have a hand in it so you'll be praised by him.  You want to see us, my family, fall even further back from him.  Ridiculed further and pushed away more than we already are.  You're just looking to take MY glory and make it your own."
"It's a link to Voldemort."  Harry said, stroking his finger against the snake's head, then pulling Draco's sleeve back down, not wanting to leave it on display like that for too long.  "I suppose it might be a little like my scar.  It doesn't hurt anymore but only because Voldemort found out how it works.  It's too bad..."
Harry nodded, watching Draco seriously as he absently traced the seam-line of Draco's uniform over the inside of his knee.  "No, you're right.  Absolutely right."
The only things he'd done which he thought Harry might take total offence to was upgrade the furniture.  He didn't really change any of it THAT much, it was all the same basic shape... Just a little spruced up and nicer and more comfortable.
sell at auction, this was just our best idea of what to do with it.  An offer of private sale would probably be taken very seriously."
“I plan to go out as little as I can possibly get away with.”  Draco said, folding his arms over his chest and looking out the window next to them.  “It's what I have been doing up to now, I don't see any reason why I should have to change my lifestyle just because I'm living in the Muggle world for the time being.”
Harry- Merlin this is going to be awful.  You being able to text me whatever you like whenever you like.  I suppose if I tell you not to you wouldn't listen?
"Of course sir."  Harry nodded, something in him brightening a bit.  If Dumbledore wanted to give Draco a letter, wanted to talk to him about all of this, it might really help Draco feel more confident in moving forward with things.  It might help him realize he wasn't a bad person for what he'd been forced to do.
"How much?"  Harry asked, prepared to have to find a way to get more money from Gringott's and come back for it, all while not letting Mr and Mrs Weasley know what he was up to.
“Professors do not generally meet with parents one on one during the school year.  Especially not when they are said professor’s former sworn enemy.”
After about five minutes he stopped, turning to look behind him for Harry but realized he wasn't there, not even at a distance.  He looked around, turning in a slow circle in the dark woods, realizing that he was quite alone.  Harry hadn't followed him, he couldn't even hear him.
He walked in, closing the door behind him and handing off his coat to the House Elf when she greeted him greeted him, asking for a cup of tea in his study when she had a moment.  He was deep in pondering what he could do for his own House Elf that could possibly make her look as blissfully happy as Kreacher did that day, but his thoughts were rudely interrupted when he stepped into the study and realized he wasn't alone.
Tom was a little younger here than he was in the dreams he had been sharing with him, but not by much..  His eyes were fully dark, no hint of red in them yet... But there was such a keen and sharp edged look to them...  They drank in every word that Slughorn was saying, watching him avidly and attentively as his jolly and seemingly oblivious Professor explained to him what Horcruxes were.
Harry gasped within the dream, gasped in real life as he sat upright.  He was immediately and fully awake.
Harry practically shouted the words and Draco lunged at him, scrabbling to clamp a hand over the taller boy's mouth.
"Maybe he just didn't know the right information."  Harry shifted on the bed, shoving his hands under his thighs so he didn't do anything stupid.
The Room of Requirement had fashioned itself into a bedroom.  A very large bedroom but a bed room all the same.  Harry got to his feet to walk around, looking at everything. Four tall windows that looked out onto what appeared to be a perfectly manicured garden with peacocks strutting through it.  A huge canopied bed in green and silver to match the drapes.  Polished dark wood floors and polished dark wood furniture.  A settee, a couple of wingback chairs and a small table between them with two steaming warm mugs of what looked like-
"You need to write to your mother.  First step...  Write to your mother, I'll bring it to Dumbledore tomorrow.  We'll get it sent, we'll get her safe."
Draco muttered the words which made Harry laugh, looking appreciatively at the other boy and slowing his steps as they got to the end of the hall.  “You've got that right...  Do you want to go to dinner?”
But she had also made it clear that no matter what, he had to continue to appear dedicated to Astoria.  And not be seen with Harry...
Harry smiled, nodding at Draco and rapped his knuckles against the door frame as he went out.  “Don't forget to lock the door after me.”  He called up the hall again, just as he had the evening before.
Tom's tone grew sharper, his eyes which were fixed intensely on Harry's seemed to take on a slightly reddish tint.
"Not all of us have flaunted the rules so much that we're quite well acquainted with the nasty things in there." Draco spat the words out at Harry and his confidence raised a tiny bit at the murderous look on Harry's face.
Which wasn't uncommon after a panic attack that severe, they tended to be exceptionally draining physically.  And mentally he just... always seemed to need time to recover.
“I'll see you in the morning.”  Harry said, smiling as they left the Room of Requirement.  They parted at the stairs and Harry watched Draco walk down and through the hall until he couldn't see him anymore. He wished more than anything right then that he and Draco didn't have to go their separate ways.  That he could have kept talking to him all the way to Slytherin and all the way to their dorm.  Probably continuing to talk until they both fell asleep.  With a low breath he turned to head to Gryffindor, more than ready to call it a night.
As he sealed this letter, writing Harry's name across the front in long curving script, he heard Astoria call to him.
Harry was silent, which Draco was pleased with.  He watched people outside of the window walk past, trying to decide just how different this world LOOKED in comparison to the Wizarding world.  He was so engrossed in trying to spot little details that he almost didn't hear Harry speak again.
"Very good...  But we can't keep doing this."  Draco said shortly.  His mind was clicking along properly now, and even with his whole body still tingling with heat, he knew this was absolutely ridiculous.
Tom had been smiling more and more as Draco spoke, even chuckling as he explained how he'd learned about the subject at hand.  “You're more of a rebel than you've appeared to be in recent months, hm?”
"You're helping me."  Draco said eventually, looking up again to meet Harry's eyes.  "You keep coming here, you're talking to me.  Giving me ideas and reasons for them.  And reasons to keep trying.  I'm going to keep trying."
Harry kept arching into him, kept grinding forward and he matched every shift and press of hips, his breath short and quick.
“So do you feel okay about everything?” Harry asked, dragging a chip through a puddle of ketchup.  Not to eat, though, Draco had been watching him swirl the chip around in ketchup for a few solid minutes.
(Told in chapters that vary between Before the war and after the war, and varying points of view between Draco and Harry. It is not told in any sort of order, but bounces around to slowly round out.
"Draco, please.  I'll do whatever you want here.  We can talk about it.  We can not talk about it.  I can forget all of it...  Just put it out of my mind.  It was years ago, tensions and stress and everything, I know that must have been part of it.  I don't have to take it seriously.."
“Can I help you Professor McGonagall?” He asked, trying to separate himself from the boy he used to be and the teacher he was now.  Something distinctively difficult with McGonagall, he had to admit.
Harry made an exasperated noise and gave Ron a withering look.  "It's not on my finger, is it?  Can you see it?"  He held up his hand, wiggling his fingers a bit.  "If it's not there then it's gone."
He sat down in the chair, gloating over his success and eager to go back to the Manor the next day to try it on something else and maybe start locating more important things.  But something was odd about the galleon he was holding.  He turned it over in his hands, peering closer at it to try and figure out what was wrong.
Harry, it seemed, was in somewhat of the same boat, although he and Ginny clearly didn't feel the requirement to appear together for the family.  Different families and different circumstances, though...
And predictably...  Draco has used his wand to make things around him much nicer.  As would befit a Malfoy.
Silence stretched after he spoke, and he could practically feel the hesitation in Neville.  Could feel him fighting against saying whatever it was in his head or the tip of his tongue.
She carried the letter outside and tied it deftly to the leg of an owl in the small Owlery on the Malfoy Manor property.
“I haven't a clue what to say to you about any of this.”  Harry said after a very long silence where he watched Draco putting all his food away again.
to me he would tell me everything and I thought he did.  But then this year he's started calling me for one on one meetings and stuff.  And he starts giving me all kinds of new information.  He says that he told me everything he KNEW and that now we're looking at and gathering information from other sources where we don't know for SURE.  Like that makes such a huge difference..."
Later, Luna Lovegood had joined Ollivander.  Just as kind, just as friendly, though her interpretation of events and her manner of being was altogether different.
Carefully he retraced his steps up the walk way, moving at a more relaxed and amiable pace than he had the night before, almost as though he thought the house would be lulled into a false sense of security if he approached without purpose.  It didn't really do the trick, he could practically feel the place tensing the closer he got, raising it's hackles and ready to unleash whatever protective horrors were inside on him at any moment.
“Merlin.  I keep forgetting how much you already know about everything.  You always seem two steps ahead.”
For awhile after his parents trial, people did talk about him.  They wondered what had become of him.  No one knew for sure, and somewhere along the line it started circulating that he had actually died in the war.  He had been reported alive but no one had seen him for certain after that night so perhaps he had actually perished.
“Wait.. Potter's divorced too?”  Draco set his bacon down, turning towards Neville with far more interest.  It had been SO long since he'd been around anyone to gossip with.  Although he was quite sure Neville wouldn't call this gossip.
Tom said the word again, holding his hand out where he was standing in front of the Pensieve.  Harry moved closer, letting the other boy take his wrist and pull him in.  The Pensieve had a memory floating in it, but rippling in the silver that Harry was used to seeing were very tiny threads of red.
"What??"  Ron dropped his fork and knife with a clatter, leaning forward a bit.  "Why would you WANT it?"
“This cant be any different than a wizard restaurant.”  Draco said bitterly, still directing his words at the table.
"Oh that'll make him just LOVE me."  Harry spoke with exaggerated bounce to his voice and it made Draco laugh.
Fictober is over!  But now I'm embarking on 50,000 words of Fic for all of November for NaNoWriMo!!  :D
Chapter Summary - It is absolutely, without a doubt, without even a TRACE of question, Harry's fault that they were doing detention together.  Alone.  In the Forbidden Forest.  There had to be rules against this sort of thing.  It was CALLED the 'Forbidden Forest' for Merlin's sake! Now he was alone with Harry again.  And he couldn't stop thinking about what had happened in the Observation Tower a week before.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.....
Neither of them spoke, there wasn't much to say that would help anything.  Harry moved the small inch or so that closed the gap between them, sliding his arms around the blonde, pulling him in tightly.  Draco raised his head, one arm staying tight around Harry's back, his free hand raising to push into the unruly black hair that he both loved and hated.  Their lips pressed together hard and fast, a low noise escaping from Draco that he immediately stifled.
He wasn't happy.  But he was content.  Contentment meant a lot to him, content was safe and easy and asked very little of him.  He worked, he had a few friends, he went out and had a decent time.
"Not to mention the rest of the Weasley clan, probably Lupin and Tonks and Kingsley and the rest of the Order."  Harry dramatically counted off all the people he spoke about on his fingers like he was nearing a hundred, not a dozen.
The last thing he wanted, the very last thing in the world he wanted, was to have others in the Wizarding community looking on him with sympathy.  With pity.
"I know!!"  Draco whispered back to him, putting his head down on the table as they both worked to get ahold of themselves.
Harry moved and sat down at the other end of the couch, offering Draco an apologetic smile that was quite real and did soften Draco considerably.
“Oh Draco, I'm sorry.  I knew that and I... I shouldn't have said anything.  It never occurred to me...”
"Socks..."  Draco said, his head tilting and his nose crinkling up a bit.  "Rather ugly socks at that..."
"This... Us.." Draco said, shaking his head a bit, making the line Harry hated appear between his eyebrows again.  "This isn't how it's supposed to be."
Draco nearly jumped out of his skin when someone looked around the corner at him from the kitchen.  It took his still half asleep brain a few seconds to catch up and realize who it was.
Hermione nodded slowly, a deep line between her eyes forming as she spoke.  “I think I read somewhere that you can sort of link up Vanishing Cabinets.  They are primarily used for vanishing things, I think they were kind of a 'must have' for anyone on the wrong side of the war originally.  Not surprising Malfoy knows about them, really.  But if he can link them up and he wants it for a fast get away...  That MUST mean there's one in the castle somewhere, and he hopes to use it to link up with the one in Borgin and Burkes so he can get out of here quickly!”
"Should get back."  Harry eventually said, leaning over to kiss the side of Draco's head in a show of affection that somehow Draco found even more intimate than being in the Prefect's bathtub together.
Someone brave would have stood up to their mother, who he had always felt understood how backwards this Pureblood nonsense really was.  Someone brave wouldn't have waited for Harry to write to him, they would have written to him first and told him everything that his mother had said.  Laughed it off and continued their friendship.
"Doubt anyone will buy it if they can't get inside."  Ron scratched the back of his head where he'd been swatted, leaning back in his chair.  "And who'd want it unless they were going to tear it down.  And who'd spend money just
“It's certainly not hallway conversation.  Where anyone in the portraits could overhear you.  Not to mention nasty, greasy haired professors.”
He was halfway to the door when he realized how foolish that was.  He was under the Ministry's protection and he was going to rush outside because some stranger was shouting about him while the Aurors were trying to contain him?  Harry would have had a field day reading him the riot act about that...
Anticipating Harry's next move as coming directly to the Manor as he had before, he instructed the House Elf to deny him entry and close the door.  To come and get him if Harry turned up at the house.
"I suppose there's never been anything worth having just for myself."  Harry said with a small shrug, absently picking up Draco's quill to fiddle with.
Draco nodded a bit but stayed quiet for the moment.  He was feeling like a wrung out cloth.  Too much had happened before the day had even gotten started, and he had yet to shake the skeevy feeling of the nightmare entirely.
"Oh thank Merlin."  Harry said with relief when Draco walked into the kitchen and then stopped dead halfway to the table.
He would have felt worse about it but Theodore hadn't tried to contact him, either.  He knew both of Nott's parents had been sent to Azkaban just as his own had, so they were in much the same situation.  Maybe Nott had gone through something similar to him.  He was already a very paranoid person to start with, chances are that hadn't improved in the last seven years.  In fact it had probably gotten much worse.
"Why not?"  Draco asked, leaning forward to smirk as he looked into the other boy's face.  "I'd much rather be dead, then Bargey and Muggle Lover could talk to each other for eternity and leave me out of it."
It wasn't until he was back upstairs and sitting on the couch that Draco really thought about everything that had just happened.
(Some events line up to the Canon book 6, and some don't as we start to deviate down a different path.)
Harry trailed off again as immediately Draco's eyes filled again and he looked down and away from Harry, tears trickling down his cheeks.
Draco jerked his head up and looked into the genial, grinning face of one of the hosts.  Noel.  His name was Noel.  He knew that!  He blinked a smile onto his face and laughed, bumping the heel of his hand against his forehead, miming being an absolute dunce.
"When you have spoken to Draco, when he has read this and is ready, ask him to write his letter to his mother.  I give my solemn word that I will change nothing of what he writes, but please impress upon him that the fewer personal notes and information he gives the better for all involved.  And that his letter should be short, the longer it is, the longer the words stay where others may see them.  I will have an owl ready and waiting, come back to me as soon as you can."
Harry's steps faltered in a dark hallway, one hand moving to his forehead as his scar suddenly burned to life.
"But we could make sure it goes off without a hitch with this." Draco closed his fingers around the small bottle that was still warm from Harry's hand.    "Are you really sure you want to be helping me with this?"  He asked, not looking up to Harry's face as he tucked the bottle safely into his deepest pocket.
“Oh yes I do.”  Draco said, folding his arms as he looked at Harry.  “You drag me around town my first day here, force me into a restaurant, try and change the entire way I've lived for the past seven years just because you don't think you like the SOUND of the way I've been living--”
"I wasn't making a sound."  Draco said, his chin raising slightly though the tips of his ears went pink.  He knew that when he was lost in work or having trouble with something he did talk to himself.  But he didn't want to admit that to Harry.  To have to make noises like he was apologetic.  Not to HIM.
What would happen when 'The Chosen One" decided he liked the idea of a Wizarding World, if not an entire world, under the power of Voldemort?
He had to do.. well.. SOMEthing soon, or everyone would notice that he was just standing there like an idiot.  He had learned the basics of the Muggle baking.. machine things... before his audition tape.  Harry pointed out that he needed to because it was about the baking.  And as impressive as Muggles would find his 'special magic tricks' that made it look like he was conjuring food out of thin air, it wouldn't be enough to get him a spot.  He had to look like he was baking, even if he wasn't.
He saw Neville out, quite sure that Harry wouldn't agree to letting him have unmonitored access to communication.  Since that would mean that if Draco wanted to he could communicate with whoever he wished without any of them knowing.  Even though he, himself, knew he didn't HAVE anyone he wanted to contact, Harry wouldn't believe that.  And he was very unlikely to take any excessive risk that could be avoided.
"It doesn't have to mean anything."  Draco ventured when the silence stretched again.  "We've been getting along so well.  It won't change anything that you know.  I knew and we did fine..."
"You'll never believe this."  Ron said, flopping down onto a seat, leaning back as though he'd just been through something particularly harrowing and mind crushing.  "Malfoy's not a Prefect anymore.  Or at least he's not doing anything he's supposed to be.  Just lounging in his compartment with his mates."
Once he finished, Dumbledore once again sat silently, his fingers knit together and pressed under his lower lip.  Looking at him now, rather than at his lap, Harry could tell he just needed to wait, that this silence was Dumbledore going over everything he'd just said.
“Maybe it will at some point.  Everything still feels in motion right now..”  Draco said, his voice uncertain and so full of hope.
Draco took another step back as Harry swung around so he was sitting on the edge of the window ledge, his feet hanging down.
He hadn't paid one lick of attention to anything they officials had been saying or anything he was signing.  If Harry said he signed something, there was every possibility that he did.
“It's a spell to fix Vanishing Cabinets.”  She said, opening the book properly and turning it around for Harry to look at.
Chapter Summary - Told from Draco's POV-  Draco can scarcely believe that Harry has changed so much so quickly.  They're friends now, he can say that with almost certainty...  He doesn't understand it, but he really is enjoying it...
"What do we do first?"  Draco eventually asked, his voice quiet but steady.  Harry had given him enough time to settle himself again.
"You look it, no offence."  Harry said, moving over to sit down in the other chair near the table, he pushed one of the warm mugs pointedly over towards Draco.  "Not just because you were crying, it's been obvious things haven't been good for you this year.  You always look tired and even more pale than usual."
Draco smiled, turning his face into the soft feathers of the great grey owl perched on his arm.  In return the owl alternated between clicking his beak and making soft comforting noises as it nibbled at his hair.
It took him a moment to realize what that all meant, but when he put it together he took in a sharp breath, then made a noise of triumph.  This was the missing item from Malfoy Manor!  This was what had been sitting on the table at the door of Malfoy Manor!  It had taken a few hours for the galleon to find it's way to him, but having no idea where it was coming from he figured it made good time.
He smiled, though, at all of the Aurors that had brought his things up stairs, and thanked whatever Gods might be listening that at least he had the top floor and wouldn't have to hear anyone stomping around above him.
“What is wrong with you!?” The dark haired boy sputtered, anger growing as Draco laughed at him again.  “You’re normally a coward when you’re on your own? I can’t think of any other time I’ve had you cornered that you haven’t recoiled and back tracked and tried to worm your way out of it.”
Harry just about melted with relief, so pleased that Draco was so much quicker and so much more clever than Ron ever was.
"What good would that do?"  Harry asked, sitting on the lid of his trunk to make it close, groaning as he got up to retrieve a sock that was his, sticking out from under Ron's wardrobe.
Draco nodded, smiling at the other boy.  "Yeah that's good.  Hey..." He leaned forward a bit so he could see Harry more clearly.  "You don't expect me to go easy on you when Slytherin plays Gryffindor just because we're friends now, do you?"
Harry had moved on to a different topic, and one that startled Draco and shook the fog in his head away.
Draco made a noise of frustration, half wishing he'd never agreed to even try this, even if he WAS happy to be back in touch with a friend.
Draco raised one hand, pushing it through his hair, a nervous gesture Harry recognized that preceded Draco saying something he was uncomfortable letting past his lips.
Draco bolted upright in bed, heaving in deep breaths of air as his skin prickled and his hands shook.
Draco tore his gaze away from the window to glance at Harry, just enough to acknowledge him before he looked back out the window again.  “No, I don't.”
"It's entirely possible.  Houses that have had magical families in them for long periods of time, like centuries and
He kept shaking. Kept hearing that high thin voice that had haunted him for years.  Probably always would haunt him.
"Want to bet?"  Draco asked, leaning over a bit and sticking his hand out to Harry, raising both eyebrows.
Harry nodded.  He picked up the letter carefully, turning it over in his hands a couple of times before he just held it flat between two palms.
He looked up when Neville didn't answer, meeting the other man's gaze and seeing him without a smile for the first time.
“If I have to actually walk up to an Auror while wounded and SAY that I'm wounded then I think you need better Aurors.”  Draco snapped the words at Harry, then smiled in nasty triumph when the Beaming Young Auror actually laughed at what he said.
They sat in silence for a little while, digesting the conversation.  When Harry lightly cleared his throat, Draco brought his attention back to the room.  "Hm?"
"I don't know what happened."  He said, shaking his head and getting a spoon to try and fish the eggs out.  "Honestly just being here... It's so much more full on than you expect it to be."
Draco closed his eyes tightly, gasping for air as he moved to get up from the stool, walking unsteadily for a few steps until he felt himself start to fall, but he never hit the floor.  He knew he wasn't holding up his own weight, but he wasn't on the floor either.
"We have a lot to catch up on."  Harry said in return, smiling back at the other man.  "There's been quite a few years between Hogwarts and now where we never saw each other aside from the train.  And there wasn't much information passed in the polite nods we gave each other."
"French toast, raspberry and cream and coffee cake."  Draco repeated, slightly more deadpan as he looked at Paul levelly.
“I think I just got stuck there.”  Harry said with a sheepish smile.  “The Ministry is being generous but we have to account for every dollar we're putting out just to make sure we know where it's all being spent.  I just didn't quite connect the dots to the fact you really WERE asking for your own money which is yours to do as you wish with.  Oh and...  If you want internet I can figure something out for you.”
you I was there that day and I heard everything you said to him.  Make good on your word.  Just scare him a little bit, hm?”
“I never thought I would have either.”  Harry admitted, raising his shoulders in a small shrug.  “But I suppose I was sort of pushed into what I felt I should believe from the start.”
"But I want you to come here.  Astoria and Scorpius too if you want, or they can stay at their house.  I don't want you in Malfoy Manor when he's there."
She excused herself, but not before straightening a curtain with her hand and cleaning smudges off his classroom door with her wand.  Leaving Harry to once again lapse off into deeper thoughts.   He really hadn’t wanted to contact Draco and ask him to come in.  Not really.  If he was completely honest he did want to see him again, but not in circumstances like this.  But that was only if he was honest with himself, and most of the time he didn’t allow himself the luxury of that particular honesty.
"I don't think you could.  Not even with magic."  Harry said with a shrug, picking the popcorn out of his hair and tossing it onto the floor for the cat to bat around.
"Are you injured or half dead or sick?"  Harry's voice sounded closer now, sitting where they were.  He figured they were likely close to back to back with the door between them.
Neville laughed then, straightening up and bringing some food from the fridge to the counter in front of Draco.  “Alright, you know what?  That's entirely fair.  And I'm sure with the move and everything that's been going on, you probably could do with a lot more sleep.”
Ron and Hermione had been the ones to come and retrieve him.  The guards that had forcibly removed him from the meeting room wouldn't let him leave alone.
This was the Room of Requirement in a way he'd never seen it before.  It was massive, toweringly tall, like a cathedral, it's walls reaching and arching skyward almost dizzyingly.  But even more impressive was just how much STUFF was in it.  Crammed to the gills, it held the most vast and incredible assortment of junk and treasures he'd ever seen.
When Harry finally corners Draco in the bathroom with Moaning Myrtle, he expects to demand answers to his questions. But when he finds Draco in tears and absolute despair, all he can think of is getting him somewhere safe to find out what the hell is going on...
Harry, feeling annoyed in general, abandoned the quest, not even telling Ron that he was.  He couldn't be bothered, really, and it wasn't like Ron was truly any help anyways.  He'd searched the same furniture and same floor over and over again like he expected something to change.
He didn't know what had happened to Harry.  Didn't understand why suddenly Harry seemed to want nothing to do with his old friends or the old causes he seemed to stand for.  Could not begin to explain it.  But he liked it...  Harry was proving to offer him some very much needed respite this year.  And he really needed that.
The meetings he'd been having with Dumbledore that year had taught him a lot.  Not just about Voldemort and his history and the truth behind what he was up against, but about the older man as well.  And just how much Dumbledore actually seemed to know about everything that was going on around him with the Death Eaters and Voldemort himself.  Harry honestly figured not all of what he was going to tell him would come as a surprise.  And he was right.
Harry had the good sense to look properly chastised, as though suddenly realizing just how intrusive he was being.  “Sorry.  I just...  Sorry.”  He shook his head, then pushed off from the wall he was leaning against with a low breath.  “I'll leave Nott you to it, then.  I won't ask for updates but it would be nice if you gave me one every so often.  Even just to say you're getting no where.”
“No.. More of the same sort of thing as the television.  Not magic like we know it, but magic like Muggles seem to do.” Neville swiped his finger across the small screen and the picture on it changed.  “So you know how we use owls to send messages and everything?  Muggles have a bunch of other ways to communicate.  Originally they mostly wrote letters and sent them like we do, but they took longer because they would be collected by Muggles and driven to where they were supposed to be and then other Muggles would carry the letters around to bring them to the houses once or twice a day.”
He looked longingly at his bed as he got dressed, but knew that the worst thing he could do was keep messing with his sleep schedule.  At one point, early into the seven years he'd spent trying to stay inside and manage the attacks he kept having, he ordered a book from Flourish and Blotts about keeping a healthy mind.  One of the most important things the book (which had been mostly annoying and spoke to it's reader like it was better than them) had said to do was keep a regular sleep schedule.  That getting regular rest at regular times was very important.
Draco didn't finish that sentence because before he could Harry had stepped up into him.  Had wrapped his arms around him and pulled him in tight.  Had slid one hand up his back to pull his head down the small ways (Harry always was a little shorter than him) to his own so he could press their lips together.
In moments they were on the ground.  It was cold and hard, icy half frozen leaves stuck first to their clothes and then to their skin as they struggled out of what they were wearing.  Neither of them noticed.  Neither of them would have cared even if they had noticed. All that mattered was the heat of their skin where it pressed together, the slick slide of their lips as they kissed harder and deeper.  They pulled insistently at each other, shifting and sliding together in ways they'd both thought about but had never chanced before.
They were in the overnight before the second day of filming for the Show-Stopper, Harry had apparated to him after he was done work for the day.
After he'd re-read the page of his first letter that he'd given Harry, he'd just about melted into the floor with hot embarrassment.  Humiliation, practically.  He had forgotten he'd written that...
Panic rose in Draco in a way he hadn't anticipated.  He always thought that once he got that letter- and he knew someday he would- he would be relieved.  That final tie that had him bound to the world he once knew would be dissolved, he would truly be free.
Just... accepted it.  Said he had nothing to apologize for but if he wanted it, he accepted his apology.
“I probably am.”  Draco said, but it was succinct.  There was no gloating or sneering about it, he was just stating fact.  “My Aunt is by far the most psychopathic person I have ever met, and that includes the Dark Lord.... But she knows her stuff.”
“Thank you.” Draco said simply, meeting Harry’s eyes again, causing a flutter in the darker haired man’s chest at how their gazes locked so strongly.
"It wasn't much fun.  But might be more fun if you were there."  Harry raised his eyebrows a bit at Draco, smiling at him.
Guilt coursed through him, as it had with each letter he had received in the past two and a half weeks.  He hadn't replied to any of them even though he had desperately wanted to.
Draco felt odd accepting that gesture and thinking that it was real.  Better to stop the connection now.
The ring acts on thoughts already in your head, it's not at all dark magic, but sometimes something that makes us open up to ALL our thoughts, especially the deep down ones, can be a little bit of a gamble about where they might lead.  ;)
It was like a lightbulb went off over Harry’s head.  Draco’s response which he knew gave away his location but absolutely nothing he was doing in there, shone light directly into Harry’s brain and snapped together so many pieces of the puzzle at once.
Draco laughed at that, raising one eyebrow in a gesture Harry never had been able to master, and he had tried, shaking his head.  “I’m sorry...  You want a peaceful life but you’ve taken a job as a professor?”
Draco has been writing letters to Harry for years. The first one he wrote he really did mean to send, but then he didn't... Since then he has been writing letters, sealing them, and putting them in a drawer. They're personal, and therapeutic, they tell Harry everything... But they're never ACTUALLY supposed to be sent to him...
“I want to know what climax Dumbledore is building to.  What memory or information he's making you work so hard for.”
Neville smiled (as usual) when he spoke, glancing at Draco over his shoulder.  If he had noticed the change of clothes, he at least had the good grace not to mention it.
Draco glanced towards the door when Harry shouted at him and smiled just a little bit before turning back to the television.
Harry's voice was muffled through the thick wood of Malfoy Manor's front door.  Draco stood on the other side of it, chewing on his lower lip.
Harry's dismissive and rather short tone were enough for Ron to clam up again and Harry stood, smiling a bit at Neville.  "You coming?"
“House rivalry doesn’t run in the family.” Draco said, almost apologetically, making Harry jerk his head around to look at him.
“Brooms would be too slow, you could be followed.”  Draco added, sighing as he leaned back on his hands and looked at the cabinet.
But he didn't.  It sat first on his desk, sealed and waiting in the silent house that was occupied only by himself and his mother.  Then he put it in a drawer.
And after Harry had left with his wand that night, the little piece of hope turned to resentment and anger.  He had thought he needed to get his head back on straight.  He redoubled his efforts to be useful on
Draco was shaking as he read the last letter from Harry, dropping it once he finished to press both hands to his face.
"Where are you, Draco?"  He murmured to the air around him, holding the coin up to look again.  "Did you have this the whole time?"
What would happen when 'The Chosen One" decided he liked the idea of a Wizarding World, if not an entire world, under the power of Voldemort?
"I did tell you..." Harry smiled as he moved in to stand next to him.  "But what it lacks in frills it makes up for in taste."
He would have slept through much of the day after as well, but sometime mid-morning he woke up smelling coffee.  Making a noise of annoyance, he turned over in bed and pulled the blanket up over his nose. Neighbours, he decided, were not fun when you shared walls and had to smell their cooking as well as hear their conversations, arguments and which television programs they favoured.
“I'll never be as good as you at Occlumency.”  Harry said, shaking his head as he smiled a bit at the other boy.  “Seriously, you're probably better than Snape is.  Never let him know.”
“You shoved me out so hard...”  Draco said, laughing himself as he crossed the short distance to the other boy, absolutely beaming at him.  “I didn't even see it coming.”
They stopped outside of Draco's building and Neville took the phone back from him and turned so Draco could see the screen.  He showed him how to unlock it, then took a bunch of little picture boxes off the screen that he called 'apps'.
But the smell just got stronger, and Draco sat up quickly when he realized the noise that accompanied the smell was not from his neighbours...  He was hearing noise from actually inside of his apartment...
There's a hint about what was happening with the ring in an earlier chapter.  That's all I'll say about it's whereabouts. ;)
But this time it wasn't Harry thinking of an alternate plan.  It wasn't Harry's brain ticking through other options.
"It doesn't have to be anything.  I understand why you would have felt it.  Everything was so messed up, everything was so crazy..."
Draco muttered that he felt like HE should be the one getting paid for all the work he had to do just getting things out of the store.
"It won't ever be done."  Draco said with a note of resignation in his voice.  "You're never going to be done, Harry."
He nodded, swallowing hard and taking in a slow breath before he let it out again slowly.  “I didn't think he noticed.”
But unluckily for Borgin, he doesn't know that he's become a little sensitive to dairy in his later years, and the ring was making him think about whether or not he should continue eating the cheese he always has with lunch every day.
But this time his mother had come without warning.  She had come because she'd heard a rumour that Draco had been seen with Harry sitting in a park eating chips and looking very comfortable together.
“You know her?”  The woman spat at him, stepping forward and pushing the photo closer to Draco's face.  “Look at her!!  Look close!  She's dead because of you!  Death Eater scum!  You should have been thrown in Azakaban with your parents!  You should be dead!  You should be DEAD!!”
Making a noise that was kind of strangled, he turned and stalked back up the hall and into his bedroom.  His cheeks absolutely FLAMED as he rooted around and found a long sleeve t-shirt and a pair of pyjama pants to pull on.  Only once he was fully covered did he emerge again, returning to the kitchen to glare at the other man.
"This is better."  Harry said, raising both eyebrows as he looked around, turning in a slow circle.  "Not what I would have expected though."
Draco laughed at that, feeling tension melt away from within him that had grown every day he hadn't been talking to Harry.  He shook his head a bit, fixing Harry with a cheeky look.  "What subjects WERE you any good at?"
"Potter."  Snape said, with every bit of his usual sneer and no curiosity. He said Harry's name as a statement, not a question.
He moved, seeing Slughorn and followed Tom's instructions, creeping around until he was hidden completely from view of the other two, but he could see them.
The evening Harry decided to go to Malfoy Manor for the first time to look around, Draco was sitting in his flat in London.
"Apparently it does...  Too bad it can't also see the future and would have known in advance that I'd regret my decision."
Harry laughed, taking Draco's arm and leading him across the crowded room.  "Okay rule number one?  Don't laugh at vampires when they're in earshot."
Harry nodded just slightly, his thumb brushing back and forth against Draco's lower back.  "Yeah of course I do."
Draco hesitated for a moment.  Trying to remember clearly what was in the letter but it had been so many years he only had a vague recollection.  Part of him wanted to clamp his hand against the drawer and then once Harry left, move all of the letters somewhere else.
Neville's voice, even more hopeful now, bordering on encouraging even, cut through his memories and he was somewhat grateful for that.  Though he still didn't like what the other man was suggesting.
“And job well done there.  Consider me thoroughly threatened.” Draco snorted lightly, his eyes turning up as he shook his head.  “I have nothing to tell you about where I’m disappearing to.”
“Separated.  He didn't think they could get divorced quietly enough that no one would find out and he didn't want it in all the papers.  They're essentially divorced just not... on paper.”
"Draco Malfoy is really super gay."  Draco echoed Harry's words, chuckling as he turned his head to look away from the other man.
He HAD been surprised when Kreacher answered the door.  He was used to him being utterly filthy, stinking and completely unkempt.  But the House Elf that greeted him was clean and his pillowcase immaculately pressed.  Not to mention that he smiled at Draco and at Harry and served them both tea with obvious happiness.  He had to remember to ask Harry what had happened.
"To find a way around it."  He said, seeing the relief flood Draco's face.  "There has to be a way around it, there has to be something we can do."
But with a cooking lesson under his belt, and something new to learn and play with, Draco has to admit that he actually feels.. content.  Which is not something he ever thought he would have in his life again.
“Relax, Draco...”  He smoothed a hand down the blonde's arm, trying to gently placate him as he smiled more genuinely.  “Even the Dark Lord knows when someone is making a point.  I didn't say anything overtly hostile, or even all that rude, I just pointed out to him that no one should be judged by their parents.”
He hadn't expected to find him crying.  Harry wasn't sure what he had expected when he had tracked him to the bathroom, but this wasn't it.  And anything he'd planned to say or do, everything he'd been thinking about for months and weeks of tracking him and trying to figure out what he was up to was gone.
“I don't know what 'apps' means so I don't know what you're banning me from using right now.  Just don't tell me and I won't protest.”  Draco said with a shrug.
But Draco just realized that once his mother was taken care of, there was nothing that would stop him ensuring that Harry won this war.
“Quite.”  Draco said, scratching the back of his head and looking down.  He picked non-existent lint off his shirt, trying to wildly pull a neutral subject from his head.
"Yeah...  They're a bit nasty.  But they're a lot deeper in.  We don't have to go that far."  Harry pet a hand against the back of Draco's shoulder, honestly feeling bad for scaring him so thoroughly.
He didn't go out because at some point it all became too much.  All of it.  The people, the noise, the sights, the sounds...  Adding that to the way he was treated and it was all just...  Too much.
The silence stretched between them, long enough that Draco looked up to Harry's face to make sure he hadn't somehow offended him.  Far from offence, when he met Harry's eyes he saw something softer there, almost sympathetic.  It made his heart hammer a little harder in his chest and he watched as Harry took in a breath, clearly about to say something before he was interrupted by their boxes of chips being set down on the counter.
After what felt like an hour, Tom shifted, sitting back against the couch once more.  “Why don't we change the subject.”  He said, his eyes still on Harry, but his tone lazy and relaxed.  “Tell me what you saw in Slughorn's memory.”
"I didn't think we'd get married and raise a family or anything." Harry said, the words coming out harder than he meant them, but something in his chest was squeezing tighter than was comfortable.
It was clear that he was staying here.  Harry was right that his mother wouldn't have written to Harry if she didn't honestly feel that was the only answer.  And it kind of was, he knew that, too.  Draco would not consider finding another house and pretending it was his own.  But to just stay with someone else..  That felt more temporary.  That felt like he wasn't abandoning his mother, he had no stake in Harry's house, it was his own.  He was just a guest.  He could do that...
He leaned in, hesitating halfway across the very short space to Draco’s face, making a sound of frustration.
Draco was more than a little floored by that.  That Harry and Kingsley had immediately jumped into action and were working so hard and so carefully for him and his family.
"Implied, maybe, but she wasn't awful.  And it hasn't stopped us being friends.  I could have taken her implied threat seriously and not had you back here to visit, but I didn't."
“I promise you.  We're dreaming.  This is like when I met Tom at the orphanage.” He shook his arm out of Draco's grasp once more, waving his hand around.  “You're dreaming, I'm dreaming.  Actually it's kind of cool to be here
"I'll go to Kingsley."  Harry said decisively.  "There is no way that he should be allowed to come back from that.  And even if he was, there should be protections in place for you."
Harry leaned into the window frame to gather his things, thinking maybe he'd go to his Common Room now.  Wouldn't be long until bedtime and at least he'd had a chance to talk to someone decent.  It did bother him that Draco seemed so wary of him.  He wasn't really sure why he would be...  He hoped whatever the reason, he could talk him round, the year would be absolutely abysmal if he didn't have anyone decent to talk to.
"Good."  Harry said, smiling and sitting up again.  He leaned back against the couch with a deep breath, seeming to relax a lot more than he had been before, turning to look almost lazily at Draco.  "Come to Slughorn's Christmas party with me."
"Hermione, I mean it."  Harry said when Hermione bit her lip and looked at him worriedly.  "There isn't anything we can do, even if there was something to what Malfoy was doing, it's not our business."
"You know how risky that was?" Harry spat the words out, even as his anger ebbed away seeing the other boy.  "What if I wasn't alone?"
Draco faltered.  His eyes had gone wide as Harry said the words 'Vanishing Cabinet', making it clear he DID know what he'd been in Borgin & Burkes for.
"Say that again?"  He said, leaning forward a bit towards Draco with that horrible, incredulous look on his face.
He started pulling his ingredients towards him, sorting through them as he tried to remember everything he was supposed to do.  It was 'Cake Week', as he was pretty sure it always was in the first week of each season.  He was making a cherry cake shaped like a cauldron with... something inside of it.
Draco scowled, yanking his leg away when Harry tugged the pyjama cuff on Draco's closest leg.  He scowled harder when the dark haired boy laughed.
Harry sighed, looking around at the impeccably clean and orderly kitchen that belonged to his Aunt and Uncle.
He turned his head to look at Draco, smiling after a few moments.  “But you learn more.  You stop just letting yourself blindly follow what you're told...  or NOT told as the case may be.  It's not like anyone has EVER asked me 'Harry, do you WANT to fight Voldemort and save us again?'  It's just been assumed.  Even I assumed it..”
Harry leaned in, closing the gap between them and Draco made a soft noise as their lips pressed together, gently at first, then after a few moments far harder.  And then harder still.  Draco's hands slid into Harry's hair as the taller boy moved between his knees and his surprisingly strong arms slid around his back to keep from knocking him out of the window.  They kissed hard, almost fighting each other as they did it, mouths opening and tongues sliding and curling, teeth nipping and biting as heat ramped between them.
Somehow hearing Harry say that made Draco even madder.  He irrationally wanted to be the one who hated the MOST.  Like somehow that justified everything.
He read it, got to the end and looked at Harry.  Then down at the letter again, re-reading all or part of it, Harry didn't know which.  Then he thrust the parchment at Harry.
He turned, looking around the massive echoing chamber filled with so many cast off, discarded things and things-that-needed-to-be-hidden.  “I don't know that I trust to talk REALLY openly in here for very long.  We don't know everything that's in here.  We don't know what walls have ears and such...”
“More.  I don't know if any of these will be any help but they seemed remotely relevant.”  He opened his book, scanning the pages as he flipped them slowly, not really looking for anything in particular since he was pretty much relying on Hermione to do the bulk of the leg work.
That seemed to placate her and she returned to her book without further comment.  Time and experience meant Harry knew she wasn't done with the subject as a whole, she was probably just mulling things over.
But she and his son didn't live at Malfoy Manor anymore, not really.  Her appearance there the night that Draco had written that letter to Harry was a surprise and he'd left from his study abruptly to see what she wanted because it was such a shock to hear her call for him.
“He probably shouldn't see you with us.”  Hermione said sadly, sighing out a low breath but then bucking herself up again.  “But you're doing what needs to be done.  I could still use your help in the library, though.  After dinner tomorrow?”
But they were targeting people like him, like Draco, and killing them.  The pattern was quite clear and now they, the Ministry, needed to take action.
Draco tipped one hand over the other like he was closing a book, smiling at Harry.  “Just close the book.  It doesn't take a lot of muscle or effort, you can even think of it like one of those diaries that have locks on them.  Close it, lock it.  Calm and casual...”
