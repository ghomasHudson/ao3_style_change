Draco relented, slumping over him, and he put his mouth to use.
“One for the road, d’you reckon?” Harry asked him, interrupting his thoughts.  He didn’t wait, but took a firmer grip around Draco’s head and made it clear how ready he was.
knows I’m joking,” Ginny tells Ron, and she smacks an absent kiss to her fingers to blow at Harry’s face.
Harry gives him a look, which is very striking, if sleepy.  “Oh, come on,” he says.
Harry would leave.
Harry Potter is lying on his side, curled up and relaxed with his head nestled into the other pillows, taking up the side of the bed that he prefers.  The dark grey duvet is around both of their middles, which leaves Draco feeling a little cold and he imagines leaves Harry feeling a little warm.  The man murmurs as though he’s been half awake for a while.  “I should be saying that you look beautiful in your sleep,” he says like a dick, his voice rough with the morning, “but mostly you look like a twitchy little mole in its hill.  It’s cute.”
“I’ll make you a drink,” Harry suggests, squeezing his arm and pecking his jaw, as a test.  Draco smiles, texting, turning in towards the kiss, and Harry has no idea what he’s doing, both of them aware that they’re playing a farce.  “You could come over to mine?”
Harry’s frowning.
,” Ginny finishes, drawing out the sound like a wizard from the Wizengamot.  “Have you two even come up with anything good?”
“The novelty of exploring it will wear off,” Draco tells him in daylight, early, pulling Harry to him in a hug where they’re surrounded by yellow and cream.  “If you repress your emotions, they come out in strange ways.  You are, I hope you realise, horrendously repressed.”  He says this solidly, as though waiting for it to go in.  “Loo agrees with me on this entirely,” he keeps talking.
Albus calls Neville
He’s in love with chaos, Harry thinks.  He loves chaos; he loves Lupin; he loves Harry’s dad and –
They leave immediately for number 12, Grimmauld Place, where Granger and her boyfriend live with their best friend, just as they have done, practically, since the age of eleven.  The papers used to speculate, but Draco knows that the three of them would never be so interesting as to blur their boundaries with an ill-advised bunk-up in the cool hours of the night.
The Easter holidays go by in a blitz of noise and cooking and teenagers shouting up and down stairwells, and Harry’s not sure who to thank that the case didn’t prevent him from having this – that he was allowed to enjoy this, this year.  Teddy regresses with the other three in number 12, so Harry has four children to cook and clean for, but he enjoys it – he’s always enjoyed it – keeping up with what he can and not bothering with the rest; rowing with Kreacher when Kreacher takes on more than his share.
“What’re you talking about?” asks Tone, with anticipation.
“I suppose I’ll be Mum, then,” Hermione says dryly once the waiter’s gone, because she’s the only one with a mobile.
In the end, he can’t dismiss the piece in his own voice.
James will be going after his mates, whether now or later.  It’s the sort of thing that he does (“Your father would have done the same for me.”).  Harry wants to help him, maybe, or give him advice.  Something else; he’s not sure.  The man was captured by Voldemort, once upon a time.  It took him twenty-three days to escape.
Ten years, they’re supposed to have been apart, Harry thinks.  It just goes to show how little Draco’s changed from school, at his core.
“Do you feel better, Draco?” Luna asked now, cherry wand in her hand with Riddle’s phoenix core.
His voice carries well enough that it really should make the witch cleaning the cottage react, but she doesn’t seem to hear anything.
“I’m bored of this conversation,” says Albus, looking away.
“Ah, no,” James tells him, taking a swallow of his beer.  “She’s got something on.”
“No he won’t,” Harry tells him more firmly, looking away.  He doesn’t intend to give the man a chance.
Before the ink has stopped running, Sirius draws his wand and holds up Harry’s touring map to the bike's headlamp.  With sharp flicks of blackthorn, he’s then drawing out the blue into lines which trace the same shapes as the guidebook, an island emerging from stains, not terribly detailed for now.
Thus began a much more coherent narrative, relatively speaking, starting from Granger’s time back at Hogwarts, where her conversations with Firenze and the house elves had led her to the reflection that, “Centaurs are very much
Something lurched low in Draco’s stomach.  The man had stopped feeling him up in pubs, and it was clear that they were not the plan, unlike Harry and one Ginny Weasley – and they hadn’t spoken about that disastrous evening earlier in the year.  But Harry was looking at Draco with fire in his eyes, and Draco liked the light.  It was warm.
“Gringotts does debit cards now,” reflects Hermione brightly.  “The goblins won’t trust wizards or witches with credit…  The conversion fee’s better than changing for cash.”
“The thing is, mate,” Ron says, leafing through the file of bank statements.  “You’ve wasted a lot of Katie’s time.  There’s loads of stuff in here,” he goes on, looking at the boring muggle paper as though it’s full of important clues.
She’s panicking, sweetheart.  “And it was the moon on Sunday, oh dear…”
Granger’s office has just as many books, and just as many papers.  Her desk is flat, with a chair, and larger than Draco’s, bearing a number of clocks and watches and other timepieces that she’s found herself working on.  There are spare items of warm clothing littered around the room – the odd jumper, scarf and hat.  There are pictures of her family and friends and places that she’s been, her boyfriend and the man who’s like a brother to her.  It’s an office more real than Draco’s, but this makes sense.  Granger has always found her feet set more firmly on the ground.
The boy nods back, and turns to his father.  “Thanks, Dad,” he says, and Lupin breathes a shuddered sigh of relief.
“He’s going to find the stakes relatively low this year,” Andromeda continues.  “At least compared to some of his pals.  I don’t want him getting distracted.”
“They’ll be missing you at lunch,” Draco said to Harry now, putting down his glass and picking up his book, rolling to his side and blocking it all out.
Another short laugh, insolent and sarcastic.
…  What the hell were you
Little Harry scowls.
“Oh,” replies Harry, off-balance.  This sounds – remarkably conscientious.  He assumes that Sasha is the husband, Nebuchadnezzar von Herrschenberg the twelfth.  “How d’you get to
Mrs Figg contradicts.
“Gone for the summer, mate,” Granger’s boyfriend told Harry, and Draco wasn’t sure that he could keep his face immobile.  “Australia and New Zealand.  Puds U have got a tour and then it’s World Cup year…”  So it was.  Draco had forgotten.  He felt like laughing.  “Some mates of hers are playing, so she’s staying out there.  I told you, the brothers Weasley have clubbed together to get Mum and Dad tickets to the final and a holiday.”
, and you had a good time.  Your balls aren’t made of stone.”
“Only when I was in Surrey,” Harry conceded, wrinkling his nose as he looked over Draco’s head.  “I know I had a cot when I was a baby…  It was my aunt and uncle’s house.”  The one with his cousin in, Draco thought.  The baiting.  “They raised me in a room quite a lot like this one.”  He glanced over his shoulder, shrugging.  “It’s likely the same, scale-wise, now I’m big.”
“D’you feel like another?” Harry asks, looking up, not sure what they’ve been talking about.  Quidditch and sex is the chat at these things.
“Sorry.”  And there was Lupin, watching him, lingering at the bottom of the stairs.  “I saw the light on,” he didn’t really explain.  “What are you doing down here?”
James takes a deep breath, after a while.  “It would bother me,” he says, exhaling, open, entirely nerve and daring.  This is his own form of protection, Harry supposes: telling Sirius his concerns.  Interfering.  Setting himself up for rejection, for worse.  Throwing himself into danger.  It’s why he needs protecting, because it was always going to get him killed.  “If I were you.  It would.”
“I’ve always wanted one of these outdoor parties,” was the boyfriend’s rationale, repeated on the day, “with balloons and jelly and ice cream.”
“I’m not hungry,” he tells her, and it’s true.  He’s been enjoying his sulk.  He’s turned his glasses dark green again, all sorts of other colours; he’s been pacing and getting into conversation with the mirror by the wardrobes.
“Wow,” reflects Teddy, sounding unimpressed.  Harry wonders if Sirius felt like this, when he was telling him to be fun like his James.
now says Lee,
There’s a feeling in Harry’s stomach as though he’s making a dive, Draco’s words all too sudden.  “D’you know what it’s like to fall in love with you?” he demands.
“Cut,” she said, and Draco cut.
“You wonder why he wants to run away…  Tell him that he can’t ignore the boy,” Lily commands, her tone harsh.  “We’re not having a repeat of that time with his mother.”
“Unpaid labour is not relaxing,” he’s saying, complaining more professionally than any of the children ever did, ambling and getting in Harry’s way and eating more than he picks, which isn’t allowed.  They’ve both been having an awful weeks at work.  Draco has a new set of gashed scars high on his right arm, hidden for now under his sleeve.  They clearly hurt him, but Harry’s not asked where they’ve come from.
If death came calling again – and Harry could see it in his father’s eyes, the night of the wedding – he’d give up his life without hesitation.  He loved too fiercely to do anything else, and he’d learnt that from Harry’s mum, whose green eyes are terrifying to look at, Harry finds.
Harry looks at Sirius, but he doesn’t react.  As though he’s too cool for puzzles.  Or else –
him.  He could turn into a rat, and the Manor’s doors were very old, many of them with gaps between their base and the uneven floor, which were of a size that a small creature could just about squeeze through.  No one would know if he was there, or if he was listening, or –
“Wish me luck,” he tells Puff, who wheezes at him, his eyes round glass.
Against his attack, Dumbledore hardens.  The colours of his robes don’t look whimsical; they look like raw magic.
His divorce is supposed to be perfect, like his job and his marriage and his children.  He’s supposed to be living the life that his parents never got to have, and if he isn’t then he’s supposed to be letting them rest.
He just – he missed Pansy.
“It’s not you, all right?” Harry insists, not looking away from the car ahead of him, the cars coming towards them, drawing close and swooping past.  “It’s –”  Draco knows what it is, Harry thinks.  He doesn’t need it spelled out.  Everyone knows it after Harry’s birthday, the disaster.  They’ve just been talking about how much Harry loves him, haven’t they, so Draco must know –
“He was coming anyway!” Harry defends himself, glaring at Ginny’s hard scowl.  “He’s always here anyway!  You brought Neville to Hufflepuff –”
“Oh Dad, yes you do,” Albus retorts, and there’s nothing left to say after this.
“Oh, there was nothing set in stone!”  Sara laughed, looking at Potter before she turned back to Draco.  Potter was smiling sympathetically, but his green eyes were shrewd.
it says, as though Ginny’s had the same thought.  No time like the present, to make things how they should be.
,” Harry told him, putting down his cup and wiping his hand on his jeans because he’d successfully spilled his tea.  His eyes followed the waiter, passing by their table with two more white plates bearing cheesy sandwiches, waiting until he’d moved away.  He thought about calm things, forests and streams.  Exercise.  “It was
” asked Harry, his eyes bright as he grinned.
“You are
Malfoy moves to his own.  “I think fuck Albus Dumbledore,” he spits irreverently, drawing hawthorn, “fuck Severus Snape and fuck Remus fucking Lupin.”  He doesn’t give Harry a single second to react.  “Fuck Peter Pettigrew and fuck every fucking bastard who’s ever fucking touched you, ever fucking left you and fuck it all, I am going into work,” he finishes harshly.  “I couldn’t fucking look at you right now if you even fucking dared show your face.”
“All right,” says Harry amicably, distracting, and Draco doesn’t know what to do with the feelings in his chest, too busy occluding everything else.  “But how about a game of quidditch – you and me versus the dads?  I’m well bored and I heard this morning –”  He looks up, shooting his own father a look that can only be a challenge.  “– that someone here thinks he’s the best.”
Harry looks at him, munching, tipping his chair back with a spiteful expression as if he’s going to answer anyway and doesn’t give a single toss what Draco might have to say about it.  Bastard.  “I’ve come back to Cedric Diggory a few times,” he continues, pointedly, “but Cedric wasn’t such a bellend.”
“I’m famous for a load of rubbish –”).
“Being
.  Harry needs to protect him.  From himself, from his own urge to chivalry, from caring, from
Lupin chuckled at him, coming closer.  The sound of his laughter was light and charming, no matter that they’d never been friends.  “When on earth did you come up with all this?” he asked, leaning over the bench to rest a hand on the table and look.
But Hermione, bless her – she sniffs as though Harry’s said something profound, meaningful, significant enough to cause Harry to do what he’s done, no matter that it’s horrendously selfish.  Horrendously sad.  Horrendously cliché, though hopefully not for the kids’ generation.  She leans around the table and rubs Harry roughly on the knee.
The doorbell rings at this point, and Mrs Figg gets up to answer it.
“Oh, shut up,” Draco tells him.
“She told Mum that she wanted to protect her from
Harry either didn’t dare say yes, or else didn’t notice the crisis.  He seemed distracted, and that maybe hurt the most.  “I thought I might go by the Leaky,” he said, looking out into the night of wherever they were.  Herefordshire.  Who bloody cared?  “The old crowd are usually starting there about this time.”  The Ministry crowd, he meant.  A covey of brawling idiots whom Draco had no interest in associating with.
“I came out for some air,” Draco corrects, kicking his foot back against the brickwork that runs around the base of the conservatory walls.  He lets the words hang in judgement of Lupin’s smoking habit, before adding, “In any case, I can hardly be expected to stick around for hugs and sweet baby cougars.”  He squints, trying to read a little more of the man’s expression.  “You’re the one hiding from all your bestest chums.”
“Harry, I’m sorry.”  He looks confused, this image from a mirror, brushing Harry’s hair back, which shouldn’t be making him jitter.  “I know that growing up with Moony would have been more fun than the suburbs, but I don’t –”
Harry looks up at the bright orange dawn, and he thinks that he knows exactly what Justin means.
Draco missed his mother, who’d died bearing the image of carpet.  He missed her advice.  He missed the frail touch of her fingers in his hair, all her dreams for his future, no matter how they…   Morgana, he missed her, he missed her, he missed her
tell me that this isn’t the project which Vespers is letting you keep quiet.”
But Lupin looks intent, staring out of the window.  It’s as though there’s a plan, and it makes Harry’s stomach twist up entirely into a knot.  He bites down on his teeth.
“And the way you cling to walls,” Harry says, looking at the drawing again.  He doesn’t remember saying this.  Neither he nor Hermione has ever used the phrase
Teddy rolls his eyes.  “I can pedal my bike faster than the broom Harry lets me fly.”
Dumbledore tries, standing up.  McGonagall rises too, the sherbet lemon not visible in her mouth as she turns around her chair.
“It makes me think of you in your castle,” Draco says, because Harry’s looking.  “I didn’t want it to match the furniture.”
“Will you not damn well come for me, you
“Most of what you say is nonsense!”
“You won’t have done,” Harry tells him, watching the feather.  A phoenix could take down a werewolf, he’s sure.  “I’ve seen a phoenix take down a basilisk.”
Lunch is boozy, in the end, but they avoid disaster.  Teddy runs riot after they’ve eaten, but Granger’s boyfriend keeps up with him, insisting on a game of chess and slurring out commands in the voice of a pirate captain, which is most likely why he’s the favourite.  The game takes up most of the living-room floor, while Granger herself natters on to Andromeda, glass in hand where they remain at the dining table, the other end of the room from the sofa.  Granger is feverishly recounting histories of various time travellers, explaining how they came to sticky ends, while Andromeda pitches in with ways that the idiots should have done it all differently.
Draco can barely remember.  “It was something of an anti-climax.”
“You cannot
Half of this might well be how it is.
This was extremely uncomfortable.  “Don’t talk bollocks.”
As the Polyjuice wore off, Harry Potter successfully dragged Draco Malfoy out beyond the gardens and disapparated them three times in succession, his grip tight on Draco’s upper arm and his breath plain ragged.  He brought them to a sheltered outcrop on some sort of moor, and he pulled a tent from inside his impossible leather backpack, because the wind was howling with spite and the promise of a midsummer storm.
The squabble which follows is easy to imagine, and Harry can almost see his father pulling his mother more closely to him, quill seized, ruining whatever she was drafting with a scored line and printed, damning capitals.
Making a sound that isn’t quite a snort, McGonagall otherwise doesn’t react.  “Excellent,” she says, in a way that suggests she saw it on Harry’s face in 2004.  Oh well.  “That sounds fine.  Perhaps we can arrange something for NEWT students interested in academia.”
It is possible, Draco thinks, that Harry Potter might be the most irritating man in the world.  Draco hates him sometimes, so violently.  “So,” Draco says, “it is no coincidence that they chose Veyra’s story to carve out on your gift.  You keep taking these reckless jaunts into the depths of the lake, and they clearly do not see that choice as inconsequential.”  The mer are
He’s looking away, and Draco realises that he didn’t remember, until this moment, that his wife gave birth to a son before they both died.  Fuck the crows.
As far as Harry can tell, his dad would like to live a life in which he’s never alone and never has to sit still.
Granger tries to intervene.  Her hand twitches and it’s reaching for Ron, Draco thinks.  “Yes,” she says, glancing between between Harry and his parents.  “And he wasn’t very nice about it.”
“Darling,” Draco says, his eyes softening.  He’s plainly flirting, or else this is plainly a dream, because the answer
“Oh, things’ve
“I should be going too.”  Draco forces the words from his mouth, diverting the conversation.  He stands, catching sight of himself in one of the mirrors.  He’s an embarrassment, his face drawn and his hair flat, a touch of stubble like glitter around his lips and his jaw.  His robes are solid, flat black, and they leave him as a floating head and hands.  “Bye all.”
Sirius nods back, squeezing Harry again, who jitters.
It’s not clear who’s going to end up with this second wand, in the future, but it was never the right fit for Luna.  Too prickly.  It’s a swashbuckler’s wand, Harry thought when he held it.  It must have been Fabian’s heartstring core, he thinks now.  It won’t suit Victoire.
“There’s no shame in
“Mm,” Draco doesn’t reply, slurping on his straw, his hands cold even under the heat lamps.
By his side, Ginny makes a noise as though he’s walked into a trap.
, in the
But for now, on this first day in June, in 2004, Draco didn’t know these things.  He didn’t know much of anything.  Having spoken directly to one, maybe two of the Death Eaters’ victims, not watching his memories but outside in the Salisbury sun, Draco knew that he needed to be alone, and he left with a sharp word.  “You’ll hear from me by the end of tomorrow.  I’ll try to keep my comments to words of one syllable.”
” Malfoy demands –
plans on…”
“You feeling outnumbered?” Harry asks his dad.  He misses Draco, who would have said something cutting by now.
The three people Harry was missing were there in number 12, Grimmauld Place, the night of Ginny’s wedding: Moony was lying lengthways on one of the drawing room’s sofas; Sirius was deep in the other with his stocking heels propped in a cross on the coffee table.  Draco sat on the arm near the fireplace with four feet of space between him and anyone else, and Harry wanted to press on it until it went pop and devoured him.  It was past midnight, but there was a decanter of red wine, cheese and crackers.  The three of them were having a lovely time, just like Luna had said.
past the point of acceptable –” Hermione says, her voice harsh as she smacks the table and makes all the crockery clink.  The snakes hiss.
Harry’s not supposed to call the trainees kids.  The trainees were supposed to be at separate desks; there’s a system.  Malfoy doesn’t comment – but he’s listening, Harry notices, ducked into his scarf as they crunch down the road.
“Unfortunately,” Potter chimes in, categorical, “I had no interest in other girls.”  Harry rolls his eyes, but he can’t conceal the small grin on his face.  “So instead I found Gids’n’Skids’ mate Alice, whose boyfriend was so old that everyone had forgotten he existed.”
Draco’s sniggering.  Before Harry can look, he’s tucking their noses together.  “I’m really am heading into work,” he apologises, nudging, kissing Harry quickly again.
Instead of replying, his mum tuts, pulling him into a hug and Harry squeezes her close.  “You don’t worry about me,” she insists before pulling back, tucking long blood-red hair behind her ears.
The group’s attention moved eventually to George, who was there, and he took the lead in a debate about supply chains.  A London-based Núñez cousin took up the opposing line while Charlie looked nonplussed.  Justin was chipping in about contracts.
All the same – “I’m attached to it,” Harry says.  It seems unnecessary to spell out why, even if he can’t look his godfather in the face.
The silence is tense, long, and Harry feels like he’s choking.  It’s a battle of wills inside his own heart, and Harry can’t bear the thought of things going the wrong way.
Harry’s not sure that George is thinking about anything he’s saying.  He doesn’t go into the muggle world much, Harry knows.  He’s never come out drinking.  After Fred, he put his head down and he put all of his efforts into the shop.  Wheezes never did expand to Hogsmeade, but Zonko’s sells some of their products, and George does the same back.  He’s busy, every day.
“What?” Draco asks him, surprised.
Looking over Harry’s shoulder, Harry’s dad seems to realise that Moony and Sirius have stopped talking, for the moment.  He gives Harry a glance, which is basically an instruction.  “Padfoot!” he calls, making Sirius look up.  “Tone wants to see some magic; d’you fancy a run?”
“Hey, Malfoy,” he said, a flush in his cheeks.  “You all right?”
“What – ?” Malfoy goes quiet.
With a deep sigh that Harry can feel, Draco switches their hands so that he’s holding Harry’s to his front, the line of his arm long down to Harry’s elbow.  “The bastard’s fine,” he insists, his voice soft with sleep.  He means Moony.  The man has a lot of names.  “He may have died once upon a time, but only because he decided to leap into battle two weeks after his household acquired a newborn baby.  He’s not you or your father.”
For the first time, Draco promises him back, “I’ll see you.”
Draco holds out his hand, imperious, and Harry pulls his wand before he clasps it in his left.  He wants to go back to the flat, immediately, right now, but he musters his three Ds with punishing control and he slashes his wand, pulling them round into nothing.
They both have London accents, Harry thinks, a bit like the one that Pansy mocked him for having.  Gary’s is different, though Harry can’t place how.
Harry’s eyes find Sirius’s.  His dad’s.  They both look angry.  Drawn and tired and angry.
Teddy turns pinker than the streak in his hair.  “Hello Cousin Draco,” he says, long-suffering, nonetheless failing to contain an oddly pleased, embarrassed grin as they greet each other with a hug.  Malfoy pats Teddy on the back as though he remembers, like Harry, when Teddy wasn’t this tall.
It put Sirius on the back foot.  He blustered, sitting up straight, looking down at his beans for a moment.  “When are you expecting this to happen?” he demanded, something breaking in the air.  “By the time he’s fifteen we’ll be practically forty and I’ll be having breakfast in a lovely little house, rather than bothering you.  The one we don’t mention will have come to their senses and I’ll…”
Frowning, Ron’s expression seems to suggest that Harry’s position is obviously different from this.  “You hate it when people keep secrets,” he says.
“Ugh,” says Pansy immediately, shuddering theatrically and sucking on her cigarette.  “Never has that darling name sounded so common.
.  He’s down on one knee and Draco is framed by the doorway, his eyes like pits in the gloom.
– it makes Malfoy laugh, and that’s a nice feeling; Harry enjoys it.
“Is that where we are?” Harry asks him, tucking his nose into the back of his hair, pressing his mouth to the nape of it.
Words in Harry’s throat make him feel like he’s choking, because he knows why Sirius doesn’t want him anymore.  “I’m sorry, all right?” he comes out with.  “I’m sorry that I got you killed.  I didn’t mean to; I was trying to save you.”
They aren’t, it turns out.
“No he won’t,” Harry told her, picking up his wine.
It’s a mess of a system, first put forward in 1885.  Sometimes Harry thinks about writing a new reference book which puts forward another.
Harry jumps, sitting up, waking up.  He rubs his eyes open, glasses crooked and digging painfully into his nose.  “What are you doing in here?”
“No.”  Draco’s disagreeing with him, watching, no matter that he clearly isn’t speaking from experience.  His eyes are dark and shadowed where he’s buried in the bed, though more of him is visible now that Harry’s sat up.  Harry imagines that he hasn’t slept in at least twenty-four, maybe thirty-six hours, and who knew when before that.  They went out last night, and Draco came straight from the Department of Mysteries.  “They’re rare among adults.”
“D’you think that they’d come?” Harry asks Teddy, looking up, starting to cry right there in the pub.  “You can all go to Ginny’s; I don’t mind.”  There was an idea about him seeing them at Ginny’s.  He’s not sure it’s sensible now.
say that he’s with Draco for the sex, though Pansy drills him, baby Draco cuddled to her chest (“Of course I’m staying for the party.  It’s important.  I’m the mother of the bride.”
, oh yeah,
“Who cares, though, Malfoy, who
qualms whatsoever about revealing the details of Lupin and Black’s arrangement, but the fact is that he knows very few.  He fears that Harry will declare it sweet.  Or – well, he’s not even sure what.
Draco sighs theatrically.  Harry can make out his expression even in the darkness, without his glasses on.  Directly contradicting himself, it feels like to Harry, he sounds exasperated.  “One day you will understand how much I desire to be kept at your mercy.”
Harry snorts before he can help himself.
Screaming; always screaming.  The woman broke yesterday, and all night, all night –
The memory that he draws upon, without shame, is that of his mother gathering him up out of battle and hissing in his ear.
“What?” Draco covered for them, grease on his fingers.  He sucked them clean.  “Surely the great
James rolls his eyes, and he looks awkward, Harry thinks.  The conversation is entirely surreal, but he doesn’t let that get to him.  He wonders if James is reading the cue to shut up, make a joke.  “It won’t be me who’ll be getting cut up,” he says, and that’s a clue for George, Harry thinks, the certain way that he says it.  Though Harry’s not sure why there’d be cutting involved in what he’s talking about.  “Lily’s said that I might like to keep my understanding vague,” he concedes, though he won’t when it comes to it, Harry’s sure.
“I’ve been reading Moony’s letters,” Harry admits anyway, and it makes James laugh, which puts Harry off.  “I found his old briefcase in Andromeda’s loft,” he manages to explain.  “I can’t make sense of most of what’s…”
If that were true, Draco thought, he would feel a lot more annoyed about the prospect of Harry being necked by a man on the dancefloor.
There’s a fierce look on Remus’s face, and Harry wonders if he knows this too.  He seems to think better of suggesting any familiarity with Sirius’s motivations or moods.
This earns a snort.  “I wouldn’t find anything useful, would I?” Draco goes on brutally.  He’s not calm, Harry realises.  “Swirling colours and chocolate frogs…
He says it with feeling, flicking the burnt-out bit of white to the table, vaguely at the ashtray.
Immediately James brandishes a fold of parchment from inside his robes.  “Hermione’s old library pass.  Moony left it behind.”  He grins winningly.  “A piece of good luck, really.  Moony was officially dead when she issued it, so it’s terribly vague.”  He gives Harry a look as though they’re both
He apologises to Neville that lunchtime, for bringing up Neville’s feelings for Ginny only after she was married, too late.
There wasn’t much that Draco could say to that, so he took advantage of his new entitlements to seize Harry by the wrist and apparate them both upstairs.  It wasn’t something that he was going to do again for a while.
“Snape!” spits Harry’s Uncle Moony.  “
“Oh,” Harry says.  He’s long been bad with money, but he’s never done anything like that.
Harry’s dad makes an uncertain sound.  “It’s going to be difficult not to be short with him,” he says.  He’s frowning, and his jaw sets.  “He won’t let on, but Padfoot will be hurt, if he’s been taken to bed as distraction.  They haven’t before now,” he explains, vaguely towards Harry, as though he can be certain of knowing.  Harry supposes that Sirius’s appearance at breakfast has burnt any bridge back to comforting ambiguity.  “Not since he came home.  He’s been looking forward to it.”
He wrenches at Harry’s hair with both hands, and Harry doesn’t think about his prick up his bum, just everything that he can see.  He wants to say something witty, but a load of guff comes out instead, about Draco looking like the morning and how much he loves him, all while Draco is keening at him.
Draco was an adulterer for years and he seems comfortable with the role, but Harry’s never been unfaithful, so he doesn’t know what it would be like.  He would always be unfaithful to have Draco, he imagines, and it always would have been as good as this.
With one last tug on the stitches, Draco unlocks the tide of Black’s deep, swallowing misery, the pepper-sharp pain of it, the sound of him snarling, not crying, as a dog.  Thoughts emerge as clearly as if they’ve been spoken.
Sometimes it’s prefaced by,
“Luna’s not gay,” he insists.  They don’t see each other much, Harry supposes.  She’s always been Ginny’s friend.
Draco wondered what one did when the sums became difficult, but presumably the bar had thought of this too.  “Thank you, Granger,” he said, saving face.  “I’m quite aware.”  He selected a glass of good elven wine for an extortionate number of sickles.
At the edge of the field, near the wooden fence of the playground, there’s a bench.  Harry sits down here and crosses his arms against the chill in the air, the cool spike of damp that feels like rain.
“She mostly writes books now,” Harry has to say.  They all look surprised.  He rolls his eyes.  “The last one was about how me and Neville spent sixth and seventh year sleeping with half of Gryffindor Tower.”
Harry, Draco realised.  They were talking about Harry.
A shrug, dismissing Lupin’s tone.  “Something more dramatic, I suppose.  And of course it was that long ago,” Sirius goes on.  “You only had to do the rounds once.”  He puts on a squeaky voice, pushing.  “
cousin,” he corrects.  He remembers something.  “And what’s this thing about you asking him –”
“We can say that Remus is
The school paid to run the Express yesterday for everyone in a similar position, so Ollivander and likely Luna with him will already be up here in Hogsmeade – but there are a number of places to stay, in and around town.  They’re all open for the season.  They’re all unplottable too.
Draco tries to speak, then, but finds that he can’t.  It’s entirely possible that Harry has gone insane, because this makes no sense at all.
“What?” Harry asked him, off-balance.  He didn’t remember saying anything like this.
There’s nothing left of Dumbledore to grow and change, to tell them his position
“Stop it,” Harry told him, frowning, his stomach squirming like a child’s would.  He reached up to try and flatten his hair back into shape.
“Fuck you.”  Quite galled, Draco looks away from Harry now, towards the barbecue where James Potter’s frying sausages.  The smell is vivid, but Draco’s not sure that it isn’t coming from somewhere else, not here in this garden where he and Harry are.  “None of that is true.”
He shouldn’t be able to recognise this figure, Draco thinks.  He should be terrified out of his wits.  As it is, he squeezes his eyes shut and blinks away feelings of sleep.  “This is harassment,” he states, an old claim, sitting up against the pillows.  “What time is it?”
,” Lily declares as her husband pulls back, whacking him on the shoulder blade while Harry shakes himself free.  She turns to Lupin and goes to him, taking his hands.  “Moony, Moony,” she says, “why the
Teddy’s life is the story of peace, Harry thinks – the way that his own once might have been.  Something adaptive, less fragile as it grows.  Moony, on the other hand, needs peace desperately.  He doesn’t need a wand with the same wood as Draco’s Mysteries desk, where he wrote up the workings of the Killing Curse.
“That makes me feel better,” Potter said simply, collecting the runestones.  “Thanks, Malfoy.”
It makes Harry laugh, quite suddenly and quite urgently, out loud, even as his heart turns over itself.
“Okay, but why?”
"Oh, hush you. There's no denying Charlie's the sexiest of the Weasley boys, and you're hot. I'm perfectly happy with my Weasley of choice, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate beautiful things.  Now spill."
“Seventeen years, unless he stays longer after he’s of age. That’s the standard time for children in the Wizarding World, isn’t it? I mean, in the Muggle World he won’t be of legal age until he’s eighteen.”
Harry smiled, "You're a bit eager to hear about your brother-in-law there, aren't you."
“That actually sounds like an excellent plan,” Harry says with a smile. “I know in the long run, I want a family. I want someone to fall in love with and spend my life with. I want children running around for me to spoil. But I also think I don’t even know enough about myself to make those decisions right now. I want to go figure out what I really like. But I don’t just want you to leave here, and we never see each other again either.”
“Fucking Merlin, you’re tight, Harry,” Fred exclaims as he slowly pushes inside Harry. Harry doesn’t think it’s possible to feel more full than he does right now. The sensation is strange, but not bad. He’s processing what he really thinks about it as Fred pulls out and pushes back in, after a couple slow thrusts, Fred sets a steady rhythm, and George matches it immediately.
But Harry held up his hand, cutting her off, “Look, I’m sure that he would be fine with Andi, but she’s his grandmother, his only one. Remus’ father is his only grandfather. That little boy had both parents taken from him in a single night, thanks to Voldemort. Sound familiar? Who else is going to make sure he never experiences the childhood I had, make sure he knows the truth about himself, his parents, how loved he is? And we still don’t know if he’s going to have his mom’s traits or his dad’s traits, he may have both. He may become a werewolf every month for the rest of his life.” Harry’s tone had become more authoritative and passionate with each statement. “I will not let the world treat him like an outcast or a lesser being when I can do something about that.”
"'Mione. Why do you know how Malfoy takes his tea?"
"Ronald Billius Weasley," Harry replies sarcastically. "I did nothing of the kind. I asked Charlie's permission first.  He thought the idea was hot. I had to send him the memory of what Draco and I got up to after watching it. Come to think of it.  I still haven't been sent that one back.  We may need to go pick it up in person, Draco."
Once Ron and Draco are settled into their chess game, Hermione sits on the plush sofa pulling her legs up under her. She waves her wand, putting up a mild privacy charm. "There, we'll still be able to hear each other if we speak directly, but Ron won't have to hear any of the sordid details that I'm going to beg you for."
“We can help you figure out if you fancy blokes or not.”
This was supposed to be a one-shot that ended after Chapter 1.  Now it has taken on a life of its own.  There are more scenes in the works.  A few more that were mentioned in Ch1 (Harry/Draco after the Pensieve; Harry/Draco/Charlie), as well as some new ideas that took off on their own.
“Thank you, Professor.”
Andromeda froze in place, still holding on to Teddy but not moving. Narcissa stepped forward and gently took Teddy from her arms, and passed him over to Harry. She ushered Harry toward the sofa, then gently guided her sister from the door in the same direction.
Harry started the tale from when they arrived at Gringotts, conveniently skipping the details of the necessity to be in the vault. He talked about offering Griphook the sword for his help, and what the plan to get into the vault was. “During all of our planning, we truly never considered how we would get back out. I think we just assumed Griphook would guide us out,” he said.
Hermione chimes in, "Charlie and Gin I understand, but the twins Harry? While we were still in school? And yes, please do explain Bill too."
"Bugger." Harry turns to look at Ron properly for the first time since he was woken up by Draco's voice.
My cock started to harden just at the sound of his voice, those dirty words coming from him. Charlie took a bit of conjured lube and slid it over his hard cock. He pushed two then three fingers back inside me, making sure I was still open, and there was enough lube. He sat back on his calves, slid his arms under my knees, and jerked my whole body towards him.
“Harry Potter, sir, Harry’s matching Wheezeys is wanting him in the Room of Requirement.”
Hours later, Harry wakes first. He extracts himself from Ginny’s arms, throws on a dressing gown, and heads into the hallway, so the talking doesn’t wake Ginny up. He calls for Kreacher and asks for diner to be served soon and for it to be served up in his room. While waiting on Kreacher to reappear, Harry heads quietly into the en suite.
Kreacher had a look of confusion on his face as he said, “House-elves are never used as secret keepers, Master.”
Harry didn’t know how to respond, especially knowing the rest of the news that she had to hear. “He’s gone for good this time Mrs Tonks.”
Harry just laughs. "I'll give you the details' Mione.  I just wanted you to understand why and how it happened before you get the sordid details."
"He gently pulled me away from him with the arm around my shoulder and looked at me. I expected him to tell me all the reasons we couldn't. Instead, he just said what would happen if we did, and it was my call."
Harry stood with a smile. Leave it to Snape to have an educated house-elf that was even stranger than Dobby.
Harry just stares unable to answer.
My legs started to buckle, but Charlie pulled out gently and lifted me back onto the table. He climbed up beside me and began peppering kisses along my jaw. “You still with me, still good?” I opened my eyes and gave him a hazy smile and a nod. I was beyond words at this point.
Gin laughs too. “So does that mean Bill is your next Weasley conquest.”
Harry just stares forward. “What?”
McGonagall had returned to the hall and was watching Harry’s exchange with Pipsy with amusement in her eyes. She called for Winky, then looked to Harry and said, “Winky claims it is imperative to speak with you, Potter.”
Narcissa turned to Harry at this point and put her hand on his shoulder.
“Ignore him. We’ve only been up for about an hour. You weren’t the only person who slept through dinner.”
“She obliviated both of her parents before she left to come with us to find the Horcruxes. They have no memory that she even existed, and they moved to Australia. She wanted to keep them safe. I don’t think she planned out what she would do when everything was over. Excuse us everyone, we need to go check on the girls, and then I need to meet with the House Elves. We’ll pick up the questions at dinner tonight,” Harry said as he rose from his seat. He gestured for Ron to follow and the pair left the kitchen.
Charlie rolled me gently onto my side, sliding up behind me in a spooning position. He tucked my top leg up a little higher with his arm, then I felt him slowly slide back inside me. His thrusts were gentle this time. He ran his hand over my thigh from the hip to knee. He continued this path, trailing his fingers over my skin in a slow rhythm. He slid his other arm underneath my torso and around to my chest, pulling me tight into his body. There was no space between us, we were joined from neck to pelvis. He pressed his face into my neck, and with gentle nips and kisses, he continued to rock slowly. His arms, mouth, and hips never stopped moving.
“Honestly, wherever we want to be. I want to explore life, explore the world. I don’t want to settle down, I want to meet lots of people, have new experiences, make a lot of mistakes and have fun before I figure out anything permanent.”
Ginny barks out laughter. “Thank Merlin. Fred and George or Charlie?”
Still, it'd be all worth it pretty soon.
Harry turned to their captivated audience. "Seriously, though? Like, he uses it on you guys a lot, and you all seem to be screaming and stuff... is that just play-acting, or is it genuinely supposed to hurt?"
He looked around after a moment, however, at the sea of faces. One by one, during the confrontation, they had removed their masks. As his eyes cast across them, they quickly lowered their faces to the floor in submission. There was only one expression he'd glimpsed in their eyes, however -
, before he granted the boy a well-deserved death, was looking more and more remote. "There was nothing wrong with the potion, nor the ingredients! I am restored to my full existence, just as the ritual intended!"
The one and only Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter.
A moment later, Draco came around the corner, and Harry's breath caught in his throat. Draco was slim to the point of delicacy, like spun glass, and moved with an elfin elegance. His silver-blonde hair hung delicately in front of one eye, and his lips were upturned in a loving smile. Naked but for a silver collar around his neck, with Harry's mark of the stylised lightning-bolt motif on the front, and the small metal chastity cage around his genitals, he padded softly towards his Lord, enjoying the feel of the soft shag-pile carpet under his bare feet. The house was a pleasant temperature, and he enjoyed surprising his Lord and partner. It had been a few days since he had been able to break himself away from the business of ruling.
Harry just gave him a
He considered just removing the man's head, but honestly you never knew when you'd need a rat, even if it was just as target practice.
." he whispered, caressing the word in the air as it released the torture curse.
.' he mouthed.
Harry laughed. "He'd have to start with himself, then. I present to you, Tom Riddle Junior, aka Lord Voldemort, aka You Know Who, aka Darth Arsewipe, son of the muggle Thomas Riddle Senior, grandson of the equally muggle Thomas Riddle Senior Senior." Harry scrunched up his face, as he often did when he thought about Voldie's rather murky gene-pool. "Also scion of the
“Oh, I can’t tell you,” Harry said, and Lupin looked up.  “She hates it.”
In the morning, Harry has to get up, and it doesn’t matter how much he doesn’t want to.  It’s the Slytherin-Hufflepuff quidditch match, and ever since Teddy joined the team this has been an appointment he’s made every effort to keep, and Ginny with him.  Teddy played keeper, originally, but these days Albus is an excellent seeker on the other side.
He should have realised, Harry thinks.  He should have played it differently.  Skeeter joined the animagus register after the war, and Harry used to carry bug spray in his bag, but it was all much too late.
“I don’t think that you’re angry with me,” says Draco simply, and something in his voice makes Harry accept that he’s telling the truth.  He says nothing else, though, and that’s frustrating.
” he demands, sounding dreadfully, dreadfully well-bred.  “Old Sluggy was useless.  The only concern that that man had was his own fat arse, and those
pass Harry by, but he also thinks that there’s a difference between the ages of ten and fifteen.
“OK.”  Potter seemed nonplussed, but he recovered well enough, re-arranging some of the loose papers on his desk.  “Well, anyway,” he said, visibly now in his twenties, rather than bearing the shadows of Draco’s memory.  There was a touch of poorly shaven stubble above his lip, and his skin seemed a little ruddier, more swarthy than that of the angel child in school.  He was relaxed, absently shoving his glasses up his nose and scratching his head with firm fingers, his arms toned with stringy muscle.  “I need some help with a case.  It’s not really MOMA’s remit anymore, but no one else will take it…”
“Get in,” he instructs, shuffling back on the mattress, hooking his head to the side, not sure what he’ll do if Draco doesn’t.
“You’re saying a lot of words,” Harry informs him.
He’s laughing at him, Teddy.  “Oh Dad,” he says, and Harry almost thinks his godson loves him.  “You don’t want them.  You want a nice man to take you to the pictures.”
Laughing, Draco’s looking at Harry as though to point out that this is the least seductive thing he could have said.  He bites in his lower lip.  “I made a decision, you know,” he reveals, standing close in Harry’s arms, touching their noses together as though they might belong to the pink of the walls.  “I made a conscious decision to capitalise on your estrangement from your wife.  A chance to become your intimate, I thought,” he says intimately, so close to Harry’s mouth, grinning again with his teeth.  “You’ve only become more powerful since school.”
Shaking his head, the muscles of Moony’s face are drawn tight.  “I had nowhere to live for most of your childhood; I spent a lot of time essentially trading sex for cocaine –”
Who knows how long it takes?  Once Draco has written up the principles of the plan in a numbered list of headings and subclauses, capital letters dashed through the air, Black becomes a committed student where he’s trapped in the veil.  He holds up his fingers to indicate which point he has a query about, and then Draco waxes on until Black’s quizzical frown is joined by a thumbs up.
With the sound of something like a snort, finally, there was Sirius stomping away in his boots.
Marking the Gryffindors’ essays, the first Friday in October, an idea in his head, Harry looks up.  “Draco,” he says, looking to a mirror which is round with a frame of soaped ash, hung off to the side from the desk.  It doesn’t go with any of the furniture in Hogwarts, and it fills Harry with calm happiness, to see it here amongst the red and green, stone and iron.
“Yes,” Draco says.  “That would have been kind.”  He finds himself cringing at the thought.
It makes perfect sense, Harry decides.
“Yes, and it seems to have been quite the jolly hurrah…”  Quite suddenly, Draco’s brain caught up with his eyes.  “Did you apparate here
“Oh,” Harry says.  He forgets about climbing the stairs.
Draco recognises his fourth-year Defence against the Dark Arts teacher, as well as his ever-estranged cousin.  The man whose apparent death he’s been interested in, who fought with them both, is not memorialised.  Nor is his aunt’s grandson’s father.  It’s funny, Draco thinks, what people choose to remember.
resurrected family.”
on you and you shouldn’t have to have done this…”
Thank you, Draco thinks to himself before they carry on, but he doesn’t say it out loud.
“Of course they don’t,” Draco indulges the lie, drinking to it with a nod.  “So, this attraction to men you’ve developed,” he suggests, before correcting himself.  “Sorry,” he says penitently.  “Your lust for those packing cock,” he says plainly, flooding Harry with attraction.  “Let’s talk about that.”
It was surprising how quickly sex with Harry became a normal part of Draco’s life, just as it was surprising how quickly it became normal not to touch him that way.  Their liaisons had been a regular occurrence for a while, when the year turned into 2006, but it had been until this point difficult to see the affair as
“It’s a stressful environment,” Harry supposes.  Reality is a stressful place.  He looks up the stairs and breathes.  “Was I awful?” he asks, turning around, aware of the lightning bolt slashing open his face, aware that he believes that this made his wife stop loving him.
If Harry’d ever imagined that he’d want to pick up a man – to pick up someone other than his wife – he thinks that he would have paid more attention to how these things work.  As it is, he can barely remember how he picked up Ginny, only that he smacked their mouths together when he was a few months older than baby James is now, broke up with her a month later, maybe two, enjoyed his first deep snog on his birthday, and then by the end of NEWTs in 1999 they were spending time by the lake on their own again.  It was Ginny who’d pull his hand up her robes.  He was certain that he would love her forever.
“Mr Malfoy did not inform Kreacher of his business,” Kreacher croaks, sounding sincerely disappointed and familiar.
Strangely, Harry avoided answering.  He rolled away onto his back, looking up.  “Dunno if it’s my favourite,” he rambled on, as if Draco hadn’t spoken.
As it is, Teddy receives Harry from the floo at the end of this week with a look of betrayal and he shouts at him, calls him a liar, most of all when Harry tries to explain that his dad –
Just like that night, as though she never intends to forget it, Ginny doesn’t give Harry a warning.  She asks Neville sweetly, “Was this before or after Malfoy threw a table at you?”
There’s a piece of parchment which has been ripped in half, as though the top of it couldn’t be kept.  A drawn line runs into the tear, as though it was once attached to an arrow or angry circles of ink around whatever’s missing.
It’s almost funny to meet his eyes here in this hall.  It’s funny because Draco’s reaction is to have no reaction whatsoever.  This millennium’s Draco Malfoy still sneers sometimes, still jeers, still mocks, but never in a room like this.  He’s flirting, usually, when he does those things now, and it tends to stoke Harry’s blood in different, much more concentrated ways.  Here in the great hall of Hogwarts, wearing this expression of nothing – Harry sees it as the second layer between Draco and the world, a reminder that the first has long been stripped away, except on the occasion it comes back.  It’s the promise that revelation is possible; the hint of revelation to come.
“Er; I say what I mean and I mean what I say?” Harry comes out with.
They’re all family, Harry realises in a moment.  He thought – he would have thought that Andromeda was his, after all this time, maybe even more than Draco’s, though that’s a harsh thought which Harry doesn’t like himself for thinking.  Sometimes he forgets that Draco’s related to anyone, rather than born out of magic in the Department of Mysteries.  Sometimes he forgets that Teddy isn’t his to keep.
The injury isn’t mortal, in the end, not today.  A wedge of muscle and artery went missing, and it’s not clear where they’ll have gone.  They’re probably waiting to be left for dead in the veil.  Draco didn’t check what was left before he disapparated.
In a great sea of grey, the white behind him, rumpled and worn, Malfoy looks like a pit of gravity.  He looks nearly broken; he looks powerful, his gaze sweeping down from Harry’s face to the rest of him in assessment.  He looks like he’s survived something awful with the unicorn core of him intact, and it’ll be the bright white-gold of his hair.
“All right, Dockers?” Sirius then asks, stealing a piece of Harry’s bacon.  His tone suggests that nothing unusual has happened since the last time he and Gary met.  He nods towards Tone.  “Aren’t you going to introduce us?”
This makes Sirius snigger, content.  He’s learned to keep his mouth shut about Harry being like his dad, Harry thinks, which makes Harry feel oddly sad.
Draco looks at him.
“He’s very wise, Arthur,” agrees Harry’s own dad.
Luna looks at him.  As punishment for everything Harry’s ever done, it feels like, she winks.
And Harry’s dad
“Yeah, yeah,” agrees Harry blandly, suppressing his grin and putting in the order.  “I’m just texting Hermione.”
“That’s not the –”
“Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Exactly.”
He used to find it disturbing.  Also, always, a turn-on.
“As my mother said to my father,” Malfoy agrees as Harry eats, and Harry never did realise how funny he is.  He does an impression, tipping up his chin and straightening his back, and really, it’s uncanny.  “
The upper half of the briefcase lid contains a torn fabric pocket, full of entirely miscellaneous crap: receipts and ticket stubs and muggle biros without any ink left.  Half a green packet of tobacco.  This has long gone stale, though that might be the smell of normal tobacco, Harry thinks, screwing up his nose because it’s horrid.
Holding his mouth closed, Moony’s saying nothing, arms crossed.  But he’s not looking away.
He’s referring to the secrecy, and the comment earns him a look.  Lupin is not impressed by whatever he’s reading into Draco’s words, most likely about him and Harry.  He can fuck off, Draco thinks.
The gates open wide to welcome him home, unlatching even before the world seems solid around him.  He has the clothes on his back and a mystery, the might of his own phoenix magic.  He doesn’t need anything else and he doesn’t know why he’s ever pretended that he might.
In Harry’s eyes, right then, James Potter was an impossible model to live up to, and yet Harry was aware of how much he’d suffered for people thinking that they were the same.  He’d had his hair shorn off as a child; he’d been sneered at by a teacher whom he’d only just met; he’d been called the wrong name and he’d been scoffed at by the one parent he’d ever known.  He’d been fucked in the throat by some bloke behind a club.
“I don’t know what you want me to say!” Ron immediately reacts, distracted, callously drunk, looking aggrieved.  “You won’t tell me who’s your type,” he begins, winding up to a rant, and yet never without an edge of good humour.  “Clearly that’s because you fancy my sister…”
“Yeah.”  Harry starts to turn red.  “Though it was a bit of a…”
Potter takes hold of him without hesitation, and it’s like a recurring dream.  His hand is warm and solid, and Draco’s pulling him to safety, fingers gripping tendons, the smell of dry wood and green leaves in the air.  Potter smells darker than that, just briefly as he passes into Draco’s space, sour and salty, the glance of his head rough and black like a curse.  With his hand in Draco’s he climbs over the fence and jumps down to the soft ground on the other side.
Sirius’s attention was entirely on James.
His hands catch on Harry’s elbows, but they end up in Harry’s hair, taking his face by the jaw.  “I’m extraordinarily lazy,” Draco says shortly, as though this might be an explanation.  He glares at Harry with cold, glinting eyes, his lies obvious.  “Of course I prefer it when you do the work.”
He didn’t look away, the glimmer in his eyes turning wicked.
There’s a sound somewhere off towards his sitting room – no, the bathroom – no, towards the door, because he’s at Luna’s, not Hogwarts or the flat.  Harry lunges for his wand and he barely has to touch it before a bright swell of
Malfoy snorts at the look on his face.  It’s easy for Harry to forget, in this moment, how much they hated each other in school.
"That’s good,” Lily observes, “because you clearly don’t have any patience.”
“Can you imagine Draco saying that?” Harry interrupted, and it almost made him laugh, the feeling heavy behind his eyes.  “He’d’ve told me to take him to Bermuda and let the world hang.”
“Harry –” his dad says, the sound of it entirely wrong.
There’s warmth in Draco’s chest, not only from the alcohol.  A smile crosses his face –
“I will
“But what are you doing out here in the middle of nowhere?” chides Harry’s dad, never scolding anyone for imagining abandoning the Order, abandoning Harry.  “It’s almost five o’clock in the morning.”
” was all that Draco managed.
Draco has found himself by the fireplace.  He prefers to feel a wall behind him.  “It was my father’s idea,” he concedes.  “But one of his better ones, I’ve come to think.  If I hadn’t got in first then another of the seventh years would have done it.  Maybe someone from sixth, which would have been embarrassing.”
It’s an exhibition broom, Harry expects.  It’s ostentatiously magical, rather than a tool for speed to be used and used and thrown away.  It’s for games which are for fun, rather than for stakes, and it’s the promise of a good time in the sky.  Harry wouldn’t have called it his taste, ten or twelve years ago, but now he thinks of the embroidered robes that he owns in purple and blue.  He likes magical things.  He likes things that look magic.
Maybe it’s because the man looks like Teddy, but Draco finds himself feeling almost kindly towards Lupin as he takes hold of his elbow.  “Where are we going?” the man asks, his voice strong though he is certainly trembling from some sort of shock.
is an image of the person killed, and Harry must have seen it.  It’s one of the spell’s more peculiar aspects, which Draco has only read about.
“There’s no difference, is there?” James interrupts.  He looks awkward, and Harry doesn’t know why.  He’s used to James Potter looking proud.  It doesn’t seem to keep him from making his point.  “It’s not as though you open us up and a bunch of carnations pops out.”
“He’s going to forgive you,” Luna told Harry.
“Hmm,” says Andromeda.  “Well.  As long as you don’t mess him around, I’m sure that we won’t have a problem.”
“It’s really nice,” Harry manages.  “You know it’s really nice,” he adds, embarrassed to be stating the obvious, looking down.  He looks off towards the doorway, freedom.  He can’t fight this, and it’s not fear he feels anymore.  There’s only one option left.  “I’ll be back in a minute.”
“Did it feel good, anyway?” Lupin asks in the end, shutting the thesis and returning it to the table.  “Submission?”
, ᛞ.  He makes the rune glow with all the warmth he can muster.  It feels better simply to cast it.
To Draco’s consternation, his voice came out like a squawk.  He stood up, reaching out a hand to plant palm and fingers firmly into Harry Potter’s sweat-sodden hair, tilting the man’s head to diagnose his blurry expression.
They buried Crookshanks in the garden, under the tree that was here before Draco, and Harry misses the cat sometimes, around the house.
Draco acknowledges this.  “We don’t want that.”  He takes it further, and Harry’s unprepared.  “I’ll fuck them for you, if you like,” he suggests, glancing, still holding the paper.  “You can watch.”
Pansy sighs, glancing at him.  “This is why Loony Lovegood was going on about breadcrumbs,” she says dully, as though she’s annoyed for having thought it was stupid.
“Oh, this is funny,” his dad says.  “Moony, Moony Lupin,” he tuts, shaking his head as he looks at the ceiling.  “We always find you out in the end.”
This conversation ended up the most truthful Harry thinks he’s ever had about his relationship with Malfoy.  It was supposed to be a pack of lies to cover the fact that he was engaged in never-sober, casual sex with someone they all used to jinx, typically outside and often in a shed.
At the phrase
“You’re very kind,” Draco thanks him, beckoning to Lupin before he steps through.
“Do you mind if I perform one or two analytical charms?  You are not the first, ah, new arrival and it would be very helpful…”
But they have a third, who’s bellowing, “SPLINCHING!” right into the waiting room, his voice dry and hoarse like a gale.  “SPLINCHING!”  His voice cracks with old pain.  “Please, Merlin…”
The quaffle hits the conservatory roof at this moment, and the combination of mocking shouts and complaints makes clear that this is another of Lupin’s failed throws.  He’s doing a loop-the-loop, as if to throw off the criticism.  The ball springs back to the centre of the lawn and hits his broom like a bludger, ruining his line.
“I didn’t know you were coming!” she protested, earnest and easily flustered, absolutely half cut.  “I…”  She swallowed whatever it was that she’d been going to say, looking at him warily.
It’s unexpected.  Fuck, Draco thinks.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
He can be somewhat divorced from reality.  It’s at least part of the reason for his very real divorce.
Lupin scowls sharply, and Harry almost doesn’t catch it.
“Stop trying to make it weird that I love you,” is what Harry tells Draco, tutting and kissing him quickly.
For a moment, standing tall, James Potter doesn’t look like an arrogant fucker who never grew up, picking locks for the hell of it.  He looks likes a man who’s fought his way out of the veil in search of his lost brother, who’s found his way home despite all the odds.  He looks like a wizard who’s refused to forget that magic makes anything possible, bugger death, the loss of innocence, and whatever else it is that mortals succumb to.
Interrupting Harry’s thoughts about Malfoy and knickers and the fact that it might feel like a power trip, now, the idea of someone wanting him instead of their wife, Hermione scoffs, here in her and Ron’s serene kitchen.  “Conceive his son?” she complains, playfully accusing, dragging Harry back to reality.  “You ended their marriage!  I don’t know
"Secret's safe with me. Tuck in. Ron, 'Mione has meetings with Draco at least 3 times a week in her office for the past several years, of course, she knows how he takes his tea."
“Brilliant Charlie. I’m brilliant,” I said with a yawn.
“Fuck, Gin, you taking control is so fucking hot,” Harry says with a strangled voice, “I’m not going to last long like this.”
“Then tell them to go home. My Auror’s have their hands full tonight and probably for the next few nights. Tell them to turn themselves in at the Ministry on Wednesday, and I’ll process them myself and make sure Narcissa and Draco aren’t mistreated.”
"And you're right, Hermione, he's so fucking hot. I kept watching his arms while we passed the bottle.
“Harry, it’s fine. I’m thrilled it happened. You were so high strung then. We were all worried you were going to snap like a bowstring.  Explains why you were so calm the morning of the wedding. Charlie shagged the tension right out of you.”
But my words had no effect, he just kept going in that steady infuriating pace. Slow retreat, hard and fast thrust forward. The third time my orgasm built up, he finally didn’t stop. My breathing changed, and he slid his hands down to my hips and changed the angle of thrusts without changing the pace. “Come to me. Let go, let it all go, come for me,” he said in my ear in that same voice he’d been whispering filthy thoughts a few moments before. The second time he asked my balls tightened, and I came hard enough that my vision blurred for a moment.
"The orphanage gala," Hermione said with a smug look.
Harry looked at Hermione and signalled her to answer the question by waving his fork and giving a small nod of his head.
“Hello, Pipsy,” said Harry as he squatted down to take Pipsy’s hand. “It’s nice to meet you.”
Harry’s reaction was silent, but his muscles seized as Ron made the first cut. He went to the place in his head where he went to ignore the things he couldn’t control. He felt Hermione reach out and run her hand through his hair, “You’re doing good, Harry.”
Draco, Harry, and Hermione laughed while Ron groaned.
Bill interjects, “Harry, would you like for me to see if Madam Pomfrey can floo over to look at your injury?”
“‘Mione? Can you explain?” Harry asked. He never enjoyed the idea of having to talk about the things that made him different.
“You were brilliant, Gin.”
"Again I say, wards were you, whiskey was me. Speaking of which, in all seriousness, can't you make me hangover potions that don't taste like licorice."
Then Shell Cottage happened, and Harry knew he didn’t want to be an Auror anymore.
“Andi, Harry. Call me Andi. I’ve a feeling I’m about to find out we’re truly family now.”
Harry was ready to get this over with so that he could get to breakfast, so he raised his hand, and after a few seconds, the bottle flew into his outstretched hand.
“Winky is a free elf, Master Harry, so Winky hears who Winky wants.”
Andi put her arm on Harry’s knee. “Thank you, Harry, for everything. I’m going to go to the Manor with Narcissa for a bit, spend a little time with my sister and nephew before they’re lost to me too. I’ll be alright, Harry. Go home. Shower, eat, and rest. You’ve done more than anyone could have expected.”
She slid the hem of his pants up so that she could see the whole cut, and his expectation of it all being an overreaction deflated at the tone of her voice when she said. “Merlin, why didn’t you say something when this happened?”
As soon as Harry finished the recitation, Hermione began her explanation. “Voldemort marked Harry as his equal. We don’t know for sure, but we think this is an extension of that. Harry has superior control of his magic, and can do most of it by will alone. He’s probably had it inside him since birth, but we didn’t discover the extent of it until I broke his wand in a fight with Nagini in Godric’s Hallow. He could use my wand with no issues, but sharing a wand on the run isn’t particularly convenient. Ron brought back a wand he took off a snatcher, but it made Harry’s spells act erratic. Harry started working on his wandless magic, at first just small things, doing both verbal and non-verbal incantations. He slowly started mastering the smaller, easier spells. One day he got frustrated with a transfiguration spell not doing what he wanted, and he thrust out his hand and kind of forced his anger and magic out through his hand. We thought it was a one off, kind of like a child’s accidental magic, but after that he could do it regularly.”
“You did a lot worse as a baby,” someone’s saying, strangely careful – it’s the boy’s dad, sniffing brightly as he lets his nose go.

“They can hold out for longer than you think,” he insists, sounding reckless, with a quick grin.  This is clearly a spell from the Gryffindor common room, rather than anywhere reputable.  “It’s a very orange flame.”
“Shut up, Draco,” Granger scolds.  Teddy’s looking up from his book, by her side, and Draco wishes that he didn’t have to hear these things about his cousin.  He can’t look at him.
Draco gasps, and Harry’s cock is interested in this.  "Mm," he repeats, shutting his eyes.
By 2004, when Draco appeared in his office, Harry thinks, if he had to guess, he was going out looking to be used.  He’d convinced himself that being used was all he was good for.  It didn’t feel like that at the time.
“You said that it couldn’t be found.”  Malfoy’s cradling the books, looking down as though they’re newborn animals.  “You said that you were sick of going through Pince.”
.  He has all of the dead, grasping at his feet and screaming their whispers in his ears and he

If Granger were anyone else, she would have been pulling on her boyfriend’s elbow, but instead she’s standing firm on Harry’s flank, commanding James Potter, “Don’t talk to him like that.”
The water was too much, though.  Squeezing hard, Harry Potter lurched back from Draco’s shoulder to throw up in the sink.  Not the toilet, but the sink.  The fucking sink.  Merlin alone knew what was in that vomit.  Half of it slurried down his chin to his chest.
No one told him that Harry’s mother was fucking ginger with the rest of it.  Did he know this?  “Lily Potter, I presume?”
Still red under dark red hair, Albus grits his teeth.  “D’you not remember how you used to talk about Hogwarts?” he asks accusingly, his face small in the mirror.  “Like it was a big, grand adventure?”
Her boyfriend glanced over his shoulder.  It was as though Draco wasn’t there.  “Oh, give up the dream, Hermione,” he said.  Potter and Ginny Weasley were dancing now, a light-hearted thing where they held each other’s hands and jived, Ginny spinning in the light of Potter’s laughter, horse-tail of hair like a whip.  “Your gambit worked,” Granger’s boyfriend continued, “but the game’s over.”
“No you’re not.  You’re being sought.  Excellent idea, Harry, well done.  Seekers, on my count –”
“Yes, sir. We have several vials.”
For a second, Harry pauses, takes another sip from the bottle, looks up, and says, “Yeah. Definitely am.”
-------
Charlie chuckled at my plea, but he gave me more. Suddenly both hands were under my arse, his mouth was on my other nipple, and we were standing. He stood and lifted me like I weighed nothing. I instantly wrapped my legs around his waist and my arms around his neck, holding myself tight to his body.
Harry turns and pouts, "But riling him up is so much fun."
"We sat on the floor next to each other, backs against the wall, legs stretched in front of us. We were so close to each other there was no space between us from shoulder to ankle. The firewhiskey, Charlie's personality, the heat from his body. He took a swallow from the bottle, then passed it to me. While I took a swallow, Charlie looked at me and told me that he was afraid every day. I turned to look up at him, thinking he was taking the piss, but his face was so sincere. He made eye contact with me and repeated, "I'm fucking scared every day Harry.  Talk to me." So I did.
Andromeda’s head rose at that. She looked at Harry without letting go of her sister’s hands. “You really did it, Harry? You saved us all?”
“Look Gin, I wasn’t trying to lie -”
“He begged Dumbledore to save mum, begged him to hide them. Dumbledore only agreed provided Snape agreed to turn spy. After Voldemort killed mum and dad, he returned to Dumbledore to rant and rave about how Dumbledore failed, then Dumbledore told Snape that I had mum’s eyes, that Voldemort would return, and that Snape had to continue to protect me.”
“Course it is.”
"But it will be so much more fun tormenting Ron without one."
Harry reached for Draco's hand and pulled him into an embrace. He gave him a chaste kiss, "Meet you upstairs after I walk them out."
Gin sighs, “Good, I don’t want to be a pity fuck, Harry.”
The tiny elf bowed then spoke, “Hello, I am Pipsy. I belonged to Master Severus Snape, but now he has passed on.”
“I’d be happy to,” replied Hermione.
Ginny gave Harry a small smile, “I can do that, Harry. I can be Aunt Gin and when he’s older, I’ll teach him how to cause mischief and aggravate his Dad and siblings.” Ginny laughed and Harry’s eyes went wide.
He knew when he had to figure out where a sociopathic narcissistic Dark Lord had stashed the remaining pieces of his soul before he could destroy him for good.
Harry walked Ron and Hermione to the floo.  He pulled Hermione into a hug. "Thanks for today, both of you. Both of you treated Draco with respect and kindness and made him feel welcome.  That means a lot to me."
Hermione sighed. “Lay on the coffee table,” she said as she pulled a knife sharp enough to be considered a scalpel and a steel bowl from the bag. She used sterilising spells on the blade before she passed it to Ron. She set the bowl to hover next to Harry’s leg. “I left the Dittany on the dresser after I healed Ron last night. I need to go get it.”
Harry walked over to the Weasleys and pulled Arthur aside. He told the patriarch of his adopted family his plans to protect Grimmauld and then take the family home with him. Harry told Arthur he needed a few more minutes to get the protections on the house to set and that he would be back for everyone shortly. He walked over to Hermione and Ron and told them it was time to head to Grimmauld.
“Of course, Gin, we’ll never work otherwise.”
“I’ll put everyone upstairs. You take the room on the first floor. I’ll make sure it’s clean enough to sleep in,” said Hermione.
Harry looked at Hermione, who blushed. “Well, we didn’t tangle with it per se. We, um, well we liberated it,” she said.
“But Master Harry is having a godson and the parents are not living after fighting the wicked man.”
He carried me back to the table, but instead of putting me down on it, he stood me up on my legs. I was turned around and bent at the waist over the table.  He stretched my arms out over my head and pressed my torso down into the table. “Don’t move. Just feel,” he whispered in my ear before I felt his hands on my arse, guiding his cock back inside me. Once he was fully seated, he slid his arms up over my own and pressed his chest against my back. I could feel his breath on my ear, and he began to talk to me. As the first words of filth were whispered from his mouth to my ear, he began to thrust.
Draco chuckled and looked over at Harry, "Told you she'd figure it out first. You owe me 50 galleons.""
Hermione, "Okay, let's figure this out. How many out of the seven?"
“I’ve no idea why you would, but your altruism has stopped being shocking. I appreciate it.”
Fleur spoke up, “Are you going to cut that open with no numbing potion?”
“Alright, there, Harry?”
Harry narrowed his eyes at her. "How long have you known, Hermione?"
Harry reaches out and slides his arm around Ginny’s waist, “You’re always welcome in my bed Gin. Standing invitation. Dating or not. I don’t plan to try any exclusive relationships any time soon. Opening up to others emotionally is going to be my biggest struggle. The circle of people I trust is very small.”
For a moment Harry and Ron just watched the girls. Then Ron squeezed Harry’s shoulder. Harry turned to look at him and the friends shared a glance. Ron took a deep breath and inclined his head in the bed's direction. Harry nodded, and the two approached slowly.
Harry’s cock is hard and jutting out from his body, leaking precome.  George leans down and wraps his lips around Harry’s erection, and slides down until he swallows down Harry’s entire cock. Harry is not expecting this or the sensations he’s feeling, and he breaks the kiss with Fred, arches his back thrusting up into George’s mouth and lets out a sound that’s a combination of a moan and a whine.
George crawls closer to Harry and Fred.  He reaches out and removes Harry’s glasses gently. Fred grabs the hem of Harry’s shirt and pulls it up over his head. George leans in and presses his mouth to Harry’s. The moment George breaks the kiss, Fred turns Harry’s face towards him and presses his mouth over Harry’s. Fred deepens the kiss, sliding his tongue along Harry’s lips prodding gently, waiting to be invited. Harry relaxes and gives Fred room to slide his tongue inside his mouth. Fred breaks the kiss and leans away from Harry. Harry gives a small whimper and a sigh. He opens his eyes, and George asks, “You good, Harry?”
“Anytime Harry.” Ginny pulled her hands back into her own lap. “I’m going to go make friends with my new nephew, and then I’m going to go tell Mum she’s a Gran, since now that you’re not planning to marry one of us you’ve now officially adopted yourself into the family as the eighth child.” She said with a laugh as she stood. “Wait, I mean, before I tell Mum that, there’s no chance for you to marry one of my brothers, is there?”
"You know," Potter began, still addressing the crowd, ignoring the feared Dark Lord who stood fuming to one side, "I've wondered for a while - what do you get out of this deal? Like, he tortures you, he treats you - some of the most respected and historically significant wizarding lines in history - like house-elves, he takes your money, and has basically ruined your reputations. I mean, sure, I guess you got a free tattoo out of it, but I know a lad down Camden who'll do better work that than for thirty-five quid a pop, and he'll throw in a tub of Vicks Vaporub and an aftercare booklet."
The audience muttered to themselves. Not quite the screaming vengeance he expected, but this was probably better. Not to mention, seeding doubt was always quite good fun. He turned back to Voldemort, who, in hindsight, he probably shouldn't have looked away from for quite so long. Just because the Crucio didn't work, didn't mean that the man didn't have other weapons up his sleeve. Specifically his fist, which was rocketing directly at Harry's cheekbone.
Harry blinked, and took a moment to focus on the man addressing him. "Oh, it's you. What's new, dickhead?" He looked around at the cavernous stone chamber and barked out a laugh, more wild than humorous. "Nice place you've got here. A real ambiance to it. Can't fault you for style, I suppose."
Harry turned and locked eyes with the man he knew to be Lucius Malfoy, underneath the bone mask. '
The crowd gasped once more, as some sort of array of colours seemed to drain from the older man. He remained stoic and in position, as his very essence drained into Harry - every scrap of magic Voldemort ever had, draining away like bathwater down a plughole.
As she toppled to the left
"Oh please. What mad historical dark lord would create a resurrection ritual that specifically missed off the nose? Why the nose, anyway? Surely you'd have lost your ears too, if it was just slicing off extremities willy-nilly..." Harry broke off with an expression of horror. "Hang on.. surely it hasn't... do you..."
The older man instantly dropped to his knees, grovelling at the teenager's feet in supplication. The man's defeat in the eyes of his followers was complete - he had lost, and badly.
Voldemort spluttered, enraged. "You impudent boy! My body is fully restored!"
His interest had more to do with the fact that they'd all sworn allegiance to him, and he saw very little worth in having his followers imprisoned. As a compromise, their assets were seized and handed to their eldest children - at least in the case of those who had children of age, or near enough. Those who did not had been instructed to place them in trust with Harry instead, until a suitable heir reached their majority. Harry had no intention of taking their fortunes from them, but it formed yet another leash around their neck, forcing their continued obedience.
It had been a long few days dealing with the Ministry and the Wizengamot, but he'd finally swung it. After Cornelius Fudge's recent disappearance, a new Minister had been installed that was competent and widely-respected (and had secretly sworn an oath to Harry months earlier) and Harry's initial demands had been met. Specifically, the absolute destruction of the Dementors, and the demolition of Azkaban. It would be replaced by a much more refined, modern system.
Voldemort's next words came out staccato, through gritted teeth and incandescent fury. "You. Will. Be. Silent!
Eventually, the flow dripped into nothing, and the man still had not moved. Slowly, however, he toppled forward, and hit the ground - as a cloud of barely even dust. What body he had had been held together by magic alone, and given that Harry had drank every drop into his own magical core, there simply wasn't a single shred of Tom Riddle left, not even a twisted soul for an afterlife. He'd simply been unwoven out of existence.
hillbillies better known as the Gaunts, who lived in a shed in the middle of a swamp and had sex with each other. Honestly, it's a miracle he wasn't born with webbed fingers."
"My faithful followers, I have gathered you here today for a demonstration. A treat, if you will. We will shortly be joined by a, ah,
Harry stretched. Life was pretty good.
"It was all you, you know." Harry whispered into Draco's ear. "You were the one who got the other Slytherins on side after my re-sorting into Slytherin last year, you helped Hermione find the rituals I used in the Black and Malfoy libraries, you helped me dispose of Dumbledore after he decided I'd turned dark. Not that he was wrong." He gently bit his boyfriend on the neck, and smiled at the blonde boy's blissful moan. "You even concocted the plan for the Knights to supposedly betray me and hand me over to him. You will always be the first of my court, the leader of my Knights, and my beloved."
He turned to Nott. '
, that screamed '
Harry closed his eyes and meditated a little, reaching into his magical core and finding the silencing spell. He flexed a little, and it broke like wet tissue paper. The gasp around the room when he next spoke was audible.
The room was silent for a moment, but for the grinding of Voldemort's jaw.
He'd ordered the boy to be left wandless and unbound; after all, why bind him if he was wandless, and facing the
Voldemort's eyes opened wide in shock, before glazing over.
, who has kindly volunteered himself to help me with my demonstration of my vast and ever increasing power." Voldemort declared, looking around the echoing chamber at the sea of bone-masked faces, his minions kneeling before him.
"No, Tom." he replied, to the ringing silence around them. "I think you will be silent. And you will
?' If nothing else, though, Harry had seen the looks some of the followers had given, specifically at the front of His High Noselessness' robes. They were too voluminous to actually give an answer, but he'd successfully spread a little doubt about where Voldie was getting his kicks these days. Good. Time to spread some more.
The early inheritance of the young Slytherins suited Harry perfectly, too. Draco, Theodore, Pansy, Greg, and Vince had all benefited from the decree, and had allowed their parents to retain their homes and take up lesser positions as Harry's followers. Those five, along with - of course - Ron and Hermione, Luna, Blaise, Neville, and the twins, made up the vast majority of his court of twelve Knights. Many other scattered students had sworn fealty to him, too, although they had yet to gain enough trust to enter his inner circle. Perhaps in time, although it didn't serve him well to let too many people into his truest confidences.
into the ceiling. "Tell me; did you really ever think he'd share? Do you feel more powerful? And what do you think to his price now?"
A trembling voice rose from the crowd. "Hail... Dark Lord Potter?"
Harry snorted at it. '
He looked down at the front of his torn and frayed trousers. He was quite visibly hard underneath them, and given the absence of voluminous robes, it was pretty obvious. Whoops.
"Is that you, Harry?" a voice came from another room.
Voldemort's eyes narrowed, as his followers intook a shocked breath. "You may joke now, but-"
Parkinson. '
was the stuff of legend. His signature spell, his favourite. Magical theorists had estimated that Voldemort could push a level of power into that spell unmatched by any other wizard in history. And yet, Potter had brushed it off as if it was the flutter of a butterfly's wing.
At best, it was hubris that had guided his hand back then - overwhelming excitement at being restored to his body once again. This time, he wouldn't get so carried away.
They fell back into a soft armchair, and Draco assembled himself into a straddling position upon Harry's lap. "I thought you might have had a long day running the world, my lord." Harry hummed in response, and started to nibble down the boy's collarbone.
As he plunged into his most devoted servant, he allowed himself to enjoy the fruits of his labour, the joys of success. He would be a far better Dark Lord than either Grindelwald or Tom Riddle.
Harry scolded himself internally as the fist connected. For such a wiry almost-man, Tom had a decent punch on him, Harry'd give him that. He'd have to get his jaw looked at once he got back to the safehouse, or he might lose a tooth to that one.
"Harry Potter..." the Dark Lord intoned, his eyes flickering with ill-concealed glee. "How good of you to join us once more amongst the living... for the time being, at least." His followers chuckled obediently. How dull. He'd had to punish them for not enjoying his humour more richly, once this was done.
The men threw the teen at their lord's feet, and joined the others, kneeling around the edges of the room. With the slightest twitch of his wand, Lord Voldemort cancelled the
It appeared the two death eaters had been having a bit of fun slapping the boy around before stunning him and bringing him in. A shame, really. He wanted the boy unharmed and defiant - it would make the boy's inevitable acceptance of his impending defeat and demise all the sweeter.
for the man, for a brief moment then. "Hang on, you call that mug fully restored? Merlin, how ugly were you before?"
"So." Harry spat a bit of blood on the floor. "I guess you like beating up kids then. You're what, seventy or something, and you've been obsessed with me since I was one year old?" He smirked. "Go on, Tom, since we've established you've still got a cock... Is this what you get your rocks off to? I guess it'd explain why you're so keen to recruit all of your minions' kids into your little death cult. Does it make you hard when you hurt kids?"
"None of you are to speak, or to interact with either he, or I, during the demonstration - today you will bear witness to the Light's ultimate downfall at my hand alone!" His eyes glittered at the shocked murmurs going travelling around the hall. The statement wasn't technically true, he'd had quite a considerable amount of assistance in reaching this stage, but he didn't care particularly. He waved a hand airily, and two of the physically larger Death Eaters - probably Crabbe and Goyle, although he paid little attention to his stupider and weaker followers - dragged the limp body of a slim teen with scruffy dark hair. He was wearing only a ripped t-shirt and trousers, and there were bruises and blood, both underneath the rips of the shirt, and on the boy's face - it appeared a wound had opened in his temple, bleeding down his face and dripping slowly from his cheek.
