“No,” Draco said, shaking his head before pulling a thick grey jumper over his button down shirt. “That excuse doesn’t work on her.”
“Yes, Harry!” Maeve exclaimed. She had been chewing thoughtfully on Draco’s dough, and now she was perusing the spice rack, touch lingering on and then rejecting one glass container after another. “I thought we might be seeing more of him around here. He seemed quite enamored –”
Eyes blazing, Draco nodded once, sharply, and then a softness stole over him, his face becoming impossibly tender. In a graceful move, he climbed into Harry’s lap, knees braced on either side of Harry’s hips. Slowly and deliberately, Draco cupped Harry’s face in his hands and brought their lips together.
“Blaise will never be the favorite now!” Ginny wailed. With an exaggerated look of despair, she flounced off to join the others by the sofa.
The bottle fell to the tiles with a clinking sound as Harry grabbed Draco by the wrist and tugged him closer. He pressed his nose into Draco’s neck, Draco’s clean green scent mingling with the notes of cedar and sea breeze wafting from the candles.
Draco focused on the coolness of the glass jug in his hands, trying to stave off a blush. Harry was dressed more neatly than usual – snug black jeans and a smoky grey dress shirt with the sleeves cuffed – and Draco’s heart was already racing. The dark colors only emphasized the green of Harry’s eyes, which were framed beautifully by that haphazard mess of hair that Draco liked so much.
Lavender Brown stood over Harry, grimacing slightly as she offered him a hand. Her triumphant grin had worn off long ago, after the third or fourth time Harry’s spells failed to repel her attacks. Harry batted her hand away, clambering to his feet on his own. He stared sullenly into the distance for a moment, before aiming a vicious kick at a tree trunk. As he moved, he released a pent-up scream of pure rage. The sound reverberated across the training space, making Lavender jump back in shock and leaving Harry panting.
Visibly more relaxed with the book out of sight, Blaise began to chatter away about his latest pastimes. Two weeks ago, while browsing antique stores with an exceedingly demanding client, Blaise had stumbled across an ornamental clock that tickled his fancy. Upon bringing it home, he discovered that it was wrapped in layers of protective magic that he spent days unraveling, only to find a mysterious clue that led him to an underground grotto with gorgeous, iridescent paintings decorating the cave walls.
“I was thinking about the door to your flat,” Harry said slowly, eyes still squeezed shut as he fought to remember. “How I pushed against it while listening to your sobs.”
“We can talk about it, you know,” Maeve huffed, slightly out of breath from vigorously scrubbing the tables.
“Yes, that’s true,” Draco agreed. His expression grew distant, and when he spoke, his words were measured and slow. “I don’t think you quite understand how bad it was, the first time you accessed the residue. I have seen you face down fire and torture and the Dark – and Voldemort himself. And yet, you’ve never looked so shaken as that day in the courtyard.” Draco’s eyes snapped back to Harry’s. “It scared me, Harry. I thought I must have misinterpreted what had happened to me. Perhaps the flowers hadn’t saved me at all, perhaps they had even helped drive me to it – breeding darkness, compounding my despair until it was all I could see. And if that was the case, I worried what havoc they might wreak at Hogwarts.”
Draco’s body was alive with contradiction, dappled in a strange mix of cheerful yellows and seductive moonlight. Outside, tree branches swayed in the breeze, fracturing the sunlight. Shifting hues swirled across Draco’s skin, as if he were lying at the bottom of a clear pool. His hair shone alluringly, almost pearlescent in the strange light. It was pricked with gold at the edges, a treasure to tempt men down to the watery depths.
Harry knew better than to argue, and besides, he trusted Molly to treat Draco well, so he wandered over to the other end of the house. As he neared the end of the hallway, the knotted throw rug bunched beneath his feet and he all but tripped into the living room. A hand reached out to steady him.
. Aperiomancy spells are meant to interact with magical residue, or with spells themselves, in a way that makes the magical interaction visible. They allow you to see the resonance, which should then allow you to ‘read’ the spell, because different spells will resonate in different ways.”
Mouth slightly open, Draco was gazing at Harry with an odd expression, almost as if he wanted to physically peel back the layers of Harry’s mind and crawl inside.
And at that moment, as he stumbled into his kitchen table, Harry felt a familiar emptiness hollow out his chest. He gasped and fell forward, but his body was whisked away by buffeting winds and blinding pressure before his knees could even hit the floor.
Maeve was a constant presence at his back, pouring cups of tea, plating biscuits and pastries, delivering orders to the tables with a smile. But all her usual magic – recommending just the right blend to an indecisive customer, choosing the perfect scone to complement a tea, clucking sympathetically as someone bemoaned a miserable day – she left to Draco.
That may have been a mistake. The group had immediately erupted into chaos, zipping about every which way and screaming in delight. The scene was just as wild now, children chasing each other as they hopped over or crawled under the frozen brooms.
“It was the flowers,” Draco answered. There was a hint of wonder in his voice, the faintest brushstroke of color shining through the pain. “They were beautiful, Potter, just like the ones in the courtyard. I woke up covered in them. The vines were wrapped around my arms and there was blood everywhere, but the wounds were already closed.”
Harry wanted to touch him, to breach his shields and chase the hurts away. But Draco was lost in his story, skimming along the veil of the past, and Harry was afraid to disturb him, lest he fall.
Harry smiled and twirled his spoon in his hand. His eyes burned into Draco as he ate, licking cream from his lips and not looking away for a single bite.
“Potter?” Draco’s anxious voice cut into Harry’s whirring thoughts. He turned to find Draco clambering off the ladder and into the loft. “What happened? I heard you cry out.”
Harry tugged at the cuffs of his jumper, suddenly remembering something he had said to Hermione, way back when he and Ginny had first split. Hermione had gently pointed out that Harry and Ginny seemed more like roommates who had sex than a real couple.
Smiling softly, Harry dressed in his most cuddly jumper, the one Draco loved to burrow his head into whenever Harry wore it. And then he left the cottage and made his way to Novelle’s.
“Everything, really. You won the war.” Draco reached up and tucked a stray strand of hair behind Harry’s ear. His hand lingered, and he stroked Harry’s cheek. After a moment, Draco dropped his hand and shook his head in amazement. “Against all odds, my mother and I were safe. Free. I’d even had the opportunity to do some good. I spent the summer helping to reconstruct the villages surrounding the Manor, working with half-bloods and muggle-borns, and even some muggles, to fix the things Voldemort had broken. And then the Headmistress invited me back to Hogwarts and I knew I’d get to study Potions again. It was everything I ever wanted, more than I ever could have hoped for.”
Harry sat up, refocusing on the spot where the Unspeakable was struggling to stand. A tall man with gleaming brown hair strode over the grass toward her, though Harry noted that he made no move to join her in the middle of the shrubbery.
And as the colors of dawn crept through the window, warring with the glow of the dying embers of the fire, Harry knew that home was no longer a place. It was a person.
Setting the bird back down on the shelf, Blaise clasped his hands behind his back and turned to face Harry. “I was wondering if you could tell me what type of clues you prefer?”
Harry crawled behind Draco and pulled him into his chest, propping himself against the side of the sofa. Draco sighed happily as he settled more comfortably between Harry’s legs. He rested his cheek against Harry’s and continued to devour the pie. Between his own bites, Draco fed forkfuls to Harry, following each with a sticky kiss.
“Has this meant nothing to you?” Harry yelled, gesturing wildly between himself and Draco. “I’ve been showing you who I am for
“Does your mother use magic for everything she makes?” he asked breathily. “Does she have any of her own special cooking spells? Does she do anything purely by hand?”
Draco caught the motion, and it seemed to bolster his courage, for he looked up at Harry with a tiny smirk. He lifted his hips, thumbs slipping seductively into his waistband.
Harry lifted his head and found Draco quietly studying him. He was sitting against a tree a few yards away, giving Harry space. Harry crawled across the grass and settled beside him.
Maeve kissed the top of his head and released him. “Come on, love. I could use your help with the baking today.”
Draco sighed, pushing the sadness aside. Blaise’s mood was unlikely to be related to Hermione. Perhaps it was about that argument, then? Though why would that make
Harry retaliated by spelling pebbles beneath Malfoy’s feet, causing the other man to topple into the lake. Upon resurfacing, Malfoy immediately popped off a spell that dried his clothes and momentarily deafened Harry with the same gust of wind. This bought him enough time to knock Harry back with several minor hexes in quick succession. Regardless, Harry counted the maneuver a win. He may have lost ground, but he had also
Harry leaned back against the wall and one of his elbows jostled the rack. He steadied it easily, but not before he caught Draco’s tiny, anxious gasp. To his credit, Draco didn’t say anything, just went back to chopping herbs as if his hand hadn’t stuttered dangerously on the knife.
Draco buckled his belt and sat down on the sofa to lace his shoes. He looked up at Harry almost shyly and asked, “Tell me what you found out?”
But thinking about it made him feel strange – blurred at the edges almost, like he was stretching and dissolving at the same time.
Draco almost dropped the mugs he was holding. Forcing himself to take slow breaths through his nose, he placed the mugs down carefully on the long table. He began to fidget with his ring as he waited for the water to boil.
It had only been a week since their admission that they wanted to know each other, whatever they had meant by that. Harry had thought there would be something strained between them after, awkwardness trailing in the wake of a little too much honesty.
The forest looked different during the day, but that didn’t make a difference to Harry. The path to the clearing was forever branded in his memory.
Lips pursed, Draco stared down at the jumble of mint leaves, pine needles, and blueberries strewn across the counter. A neat pile of white chocolate shavings was waiting nearby, ready to be mixed in once Draco dried the tea. Draco tightened his grip on his wand, held poised over the mess, but otherwise made no move to cast. The incantation sat heavy on his tongue, distasteful as a slick and oily potion, and he could not bring himself to utter it.
“The residue,” Harry interrupted, “it’s always around people. I told you that, remember? There are always at least a few hooks clinging to people, waiting for a spell.”
There had to be something he had missed, something that would explain why Draco’s potions weren’t doing what he wanted them to. Harry didn’t understand all of it, but he knew that Draco was attempting to use the protective essence of the flowers to create a potion that would shield witches and wizards from the twisting influence of the hooks.
Neither of them spoke at first, but then Malfoy turned his head to Harry with a smirk. “Is this your definition of a ‘walk,’ Potter? Lazy arse,” he added, shaking his head in mock disapproval.
“No,” Draco said. “I’m not embarrassed.” The words were simple in their honesty, leaving him exposed. He sighed. “I suppose I just miss it. Potions, I mean.”
“Er –” Harry gulped, unwilling to admit that what he’d been doing was contemplating a friendship with Draco. “I was fiddling with some spices, in my kitchen.”
Harry shoved himself away from the table. “Enough!” he yelled, turning his back on them. Crossing the small space, he braced his hands against the counter and hung his head over the sink.
“Was anything you told us true?” Draco asked abruptly. “About life-debts being shaped by their circumstances? I’ve been wondering.”
Harry had been keeping in more regular contact with George ever since the frequency of the apparition had increased, and two days ago, George had apparently had a breakthrough. They had plans to meet with him tomorrow, and George was fairly confident he could sort Harry and Draco out with a few spells.
“That’s reasonable, though,” Draco said slowly, “if they’re dealing with trauma from a near death experience.”
Draco had not blamed Hermione (he’d been more baffled than hurt by her clumsy lies) and he had forgiven Blaise, would have forgiven him even without the first real apology of their friendship. Blaise had actually, verbally admitted that he’d been wrong, and Draco had been shocked by how much he had needed those words. It had been enough to spur Draco to an admission of his own. Stuttering a bit, and more than a little bashful, he had told Blaise how happy he was, told him that he was starting to believe in this thing between him and Harry, that maybe it could last, after all.
Some time later, Harry roused himself from where he had dozed off against Draco’s shoulder. A bit blearily, he stumbled into the bathroom and washed his face. Through the window, he could just make out the Quidditch stands, where the flowers were still growing, twinkling merrily in the sunlight. Harry looked back over at Draco and frowned.
Mouth dry, Harry pawed at his t-shirt, yanking on the collar fruitlessly as he stared at Draco. Draco chuckled softly, a strangely sensuous sound in the dim light. He brought a hand to his pants, palming at his cock where it strained against the silky material.
“Draco –” Harry hesitated. What he was about to say was not romantic, but it was the truth. Another bit of honesty he suspected Draco needed to hear.
Draco had taken Harry to a tiny French restaurant in Hogsmeade. The owner, a friend of Narcissa’s, had greeted Draco warmly and stuffed them with delicacies. The food had been perfect, a subtle blend of flavors that unfurled across Harry’s tongue, somehow evoking the same sense of mystery and wonder that Harry had only ever felt for the flowers, and of course, for Draco.
Ron hummed to himself while poking around in the cupboards, finally emerging with a box of chocolate covered biscuits and a triumphant grin. When Ron plopped down on the chair beside him, Harry ignored the proffered box and pretended to be absorbed in stretching his calves.
“Are you still interested in becoming an Auror?” Draco asked. “Is that why you’re training with Lavender?”
“I’m actually a fairly competent liar,” Hermione said, sounding almost affronted. “When I have to be, that is. I just don’t know how to lie to Harry.” She paused, then added, “Or Ron.”
The way he wrinkled his nose when the morning sun hit his face. His soft, unintelligible mumbles before he came fully awake. The pretty pink blush that suffused his cheeks when he opened his eyes to find Harry watching him. How delicate he had looked, for just a moment, before his muscles flexed and he was rolling into Harry, tucking his head beneath Harry’s chin as if he had always belonged there. Long, languorous kisses as the room slowly brightened. His breathless laughter when Harry’s rumbling stomach had grown too loud to ignore.
“Harry,” he asked abruptly, “when I was arguing with McGonagall in the hospital wing – were you using Sentiomancy?”
“Exactly,” he replied with a self-satisfied smirk. It wasn’t up to his usual standard (it didn’t quite manage to be
The vehemence in Harry’s voice was like a violent wind snuffing out the flames of Draco’s rage. It had been a long time since Draco had hurt Harry, and it was not something he had missed.
“Ok, good. I didn’t think he would. He knows that I –” Harry flushed and hastily looked away. “I mean – well, I just wanted to make sure,” he finished in a rush.
at ease with Draco despite the vulnerability he had shown in the night. It was – baffling. Unsettling. Terrifying. And also,
Two nights ago, they had hurried to the castle after leaving their cottage and confessed everything to McGonagall. To say she was displeased with Harry’s Dark Magic experiments would be an understatement. Fortunately, however, after some choice words on her part and a bit of groveling on Harry’s, she had been willing to listen.
“Well, yes,” Hermione said, “and no. I got the sense it’s more than that. Almost like a – a magical tether. A pull that drains their energy, if the debt is never invoked. It made me wonder if mutual life-debts, like yours and Harry’s, are more balanced.”
He shied away from Harry, masking the movement by drawing off his cloak. His hands lingered as he hung it neatly on the hook by the door.
“It’s nothing like what you make,” Harry said quickly, two spots of red appearing high on his cheekbones. “But I do ok with simple things.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Hermione said, waving off the objection with a sunny smile. “I’m happy to help.”
More and more often over the past few days, needing a distraction from his misery, Harry had been exploring small corners of his world with not-Aperiomancy. He still didn’t know how to translate much of what he found, but sweeping his magic over everything near him was fast becoming second nature.
“Oh, er – I dunno.” Harry scratched at the back of his neck, trying to think. Blaise was Draco’s best friend, not to mention Ginny’s boyfriend, and Harry wanted to get on well with him. “The ones hidden in plain sight, I guess,” he said slowly.
The flowers around them multiplied, lilacs and lilies and dahlias sprouting all over the cliff, until they were surrounded by all the same colors that had danced ahead of them through the house. Draco rubbed at his eyes, then chuckled roughly, ducking his head to inhale the perfume of the impromptu garden.
Draco shook his head slightly and refocused on Harry. “She said we might be focusing too much on the idea of Dark Magic. Death Eaters are not the only thing Hogwarts and the Manor have in common.”
Harry shrugged. “My aunt and uncle hated me. Hated my magic, really, but I didn’t know that back then. They must’ve thought if they kept me locked up and terrified, my magic wouldn’t dare show itself.” Harry paused, then added gruffly, “Didn’t work out the way they wanted, obviously.”
“Speaking of hobbies,” Blaise said, not bothering to look up from his perusal of the half-developed recipes cluttering Draco’s desk, “have you seen Harry Potter recently?”
Draco dropped his head against Harry’s shoulder, sighing softly as Harry pressed a tender kiss to his temple.
Harry’s answering chuckle was more an exhausted wheeze than a laugh, his breath visible in the evening air. Draco hastily zipped up his trousers, the chill pricking at his fingers. Harry rolled toward him, then somehow found the energy to sit up. He cleaned them both wandlessly before yanking up his shorts and dragging Draco into his lap.
Embarrassment squirmed in Harry’s stomach. “Er – yeah, I guess I was kind of focused on him at school, sixth year especially.”
into Draco’s mouth. He could feel Draco’s smirk against his lips and marveled that he had survived for seven years without tasting it.
The plants swayed in a sudden gust of wind and Harry quickened his pace. He’d taken a long run this morning, and though the rhythm of it had felt good, his chest ached from the frigid air. He was looking forward to a hot meal and a good soak in the bath.
The anger left Draco as quickly as it had come. He seemed to deflate, curling into himself until his chin rested against his knees. “I can’t do magic, Potter. I’m not allowed.”
Draco tugged nervously at his collar. Maeve tsked at him, then smoothed his tie with careful fingers. “Go on,” she gave him a little nudge toward the fireplace. “Jar’s on the mantle.”
Draco crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows at her. The blatant attempt to bait him was unworthy of a response. But Maeve ignored his posturing.
have – filled. The idea of it wrecked Harry, and as he sat there, chest aching, even knowing that it wasn’t that simple, he couldn’t help but see Draco as a rogue puzzle piece, lost beneath the cushions for years, finally clicking into place to complete the picture of Harry’s life. Harry hadn’t known it was missing, hadn’t seen the empty spot, not until he was finally whole. He melted into the feeling, wrapped his hands around it like it was a mug of tea on a rainy day.
“No, Draco, listen –” he tugged on Draco’s arm until he huffed slightly and swung his feet up onto the bed. He shuffled closer and sat cross-legged, fully facing Harry.
It wasn’t as easy as sensing another person’s magic or the aftereffects of a spell, but if Harry concentrated just a little past the point of comfort, he could do it.
But to Draco, the distinction was meaningless. If magic was forbidden, then it was forbidden. And so, he abstained from it all.
“She was so kind to me when I started coming to the shop. I thought she didn’t know who I was, what I’d done.” An expression of self-disgust marred Draco’s face, and he pulled his hands from Harry’s grasp. He rubbed at his eyes, almost as if he was trying to physically erase the moment of bitterness.
“But what about those colored lights?” Draco muttered to himself, one foot tapping against the cracked sidewalk as he began to spin his ring.
But Draco had dressed like this for Harry. And so, he leaned indolently against the counter and spoke the truth.
“I – I miss – well, everything.” Harry blew out an exasperated breath and felt his hair flutter against his forehead. He brushed it out of his eyes impatiently.
The sudden relief was so profound and so overwhelming that Harry felt the beginnings of tears prick at his eyes. “Ron, I –” he started to say, voice hoarse. He shook his head and swallowed to clear his throat. “Thank you.”
Maeve drew the blinds before answering. She knew what he was really asking, knew that the question was more than simple courtesy.
“I must have misunderstood you, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said brusquely. She peered down her nose at him, chin tilted sharply and lips pursed. “Are you telling me that you and Mr. Malfoy have been –” She paused. The next word seemed to stick on her tongue. She forced it out, but her expression suggested it left an unpleasant taste - "
Draco’s mouth went slack, his gaze growing distant. Harry yanked on his arm again. Draco’s eyes fluttered, but he refocused on Harry.
Draco turned to look at him. “Potter, you told me you feel emptiness before it happens. I feel that too.” He skimmed a thumb over his sternum. “Like I
“What?” Harry threw up his hands mockingly. He leapt up, towering over Malfoy. “What did you think? That a few friendly conversations could erase everything you’ve done?”
Draco released Harry’s cock and leaned in to kiss him lightly on the lips. When Harry whined in frustration and jerked his hips forward, Draco chuckled and his hand returned, pumping at a much slower pace.
“I’m so glad you could join us, Draco,” Molly said warmly. “You’re the only thing our Harry’s been able to talk about lately.”
Harry had reached the gate to the road before he realized Draco was no longer behind him. Turning back, he found Draco spinning in a slow circle, gaze locked on the greenery around him. His hair gleamed in the sunlight and an unconscious smile lit up his face.
Harry didn’t understand everything that they saw, but most rooms were obvious enough, even the ones built solely from Draco’s traumas.
It was nothing they hadn’t done before. The same familiar patterns of kisses and wandering tongues and the slow, sweet slide of their cocks. But in the cottage they’d built together, and with love fresh on their lips, it felt entirely new.
“Yes,” Draco said faintly. “Tomorrow.” He picked up another bottle, examining it closely before vanishing the contents and adding it to a small pile of empties by the window.
should be an auror,” Harry blurted out, sitting up and scrambling toward the foot of the bed, closer to Malfoy.
“Do you think McGonagall was right?” he asked. “That we didn’t think to ask for help because we never learned how?”
“Thank you.” Draco sighed in relief and collapsed forward, all the air rushing out of him at once. He looked like a puppet with its strings cut, as if the need to resolve this conflict had been the only thing holding him up.
He sounded entirely matter-of-fact, not even a hint of teasing or suggestion in the words. Harry sighed and kicked him under the table. Draco yelped, then crossed his arms with a scowl.
Malfoy had been all that stood between Harry and certain death. But then their eyes had met and everything else had faded away. Harry couldn’t breathe. Because Malfoy had looked just as broken as Harry felt, and the desperate fear in his eyes had matched Harry’s own.
As Ron plopped down next to him, Harry tossed a rock at the lake’s nearest ice floe and swore under his breath when he missed. (again.) Ron scooped a small stone from the pile Harry had gathered and pegged the ice floe dead center on his first shot. Harry scowled at him.
It took Harry less than a minute to confirm what he suspected, and he quickly retracted his magic. Opening his eyes again, he grinned and leaned eagerly toward Draco.
Thinking of the tiny, cramped flat Draco was accustomed to cooking in, Harry had barely managed to restrain himself from asking Draco to move in on the spot. But he knew that would be too much, too soon, especially for Draco.
Blaise withered at that. He was twice the size of Draco, but he suddenly seemed small. It was almost enough to make Draco relent. Almost.
Blaise eventually caught on, of course, growing more tense with his every glance at Draco. He picked fretfully at one of his favorite cheddar scones, guilt shadowing his normally warm brown eyes. Draco felt bad about that, but did not know how to fix it without calling unwanted attention to himself.
They snogged lazily for a few minutes, Draco taking a perverse pleasure in the little hisses Harry made whenever Draco’s frozen nose brushed against the warm skin of his cheek or throat.
Healer Tahlyn was an imposing woman, tall with broad shoulders and a stern mouth, but she listened intently to Harry’s explanation about the vicious residue they were fighting. Eyes bright and discerning, Tahlyn nodded sharply as he spoke, her black curls bouncing almost impatiently on her shoulders.
Draco knew better than to protest her ministrations, and sat patiently as her calloused fingers prodded in methodical circles across the bones of his face. He had to stifle a gasp as his mind flashed back to Potter’s earlier touch, surprisingly gentle against his injured skin.
The words were like a hook in Draco’s ribcage. The blood pounded in his temples as the air cinched tight. Harry tilted his head forward, his hair falling into rapidly darkening eyes.
“No.” Draco laughed bitterly. “I inherited it all. I’m still not certain why. Seems rather out of character for the Ministry not to seize it.”
“Maybe they should.” Maeve shrugged as she adjusted her knit shawl. “Perhaps I’ll have a word with the Headmistress once I return from Peru.”
Draco,” Harry thundered, every syllable like a punch to Draco’s gut. “Not a war story. Not some bullshit ideal.”
“Ah, Draco,” Mr. Zobinski boomed in his thunderclap of a voice. He swept off his fur-lined, lime-green cap with a dramatic gesture. “Just the wizard I wanted to see!”
A harsh clattering sound made Draco jump, startling him from his feverish reverie. Across the room, Maeve had dumped the tea tins onto the lab table. She stood there for a moment, knuckles white where she gripped one of the chairs. She dragged it toward Draco, its legs leaving little trails through the weave of the rug. Another grating clang as Maeve slammed the chair down behind Draco’s desk, and then she was sitting beside him, frowning into his eyes.
Draco held Harry’s gaze for a few heated moments, his pupils slowly dilating. But then he butted his head against Harry’s, an oddly affectionate gesture, and pulled him to his feet.
As he hunted through the mess of papers, Draco’s mind whirled backward, counting and recounting the days since they had last met with Hermione, unwilling to believe it had been nearly three weeks.
He had made an effort to clear the snow from the spot where he was huddling by the lake, and had even brought a waterproof cloak to sit on, but the ground was still hard and frozen, and it hadn’t taken long for the chill to penetrate his many layers.
“It’s silly,” Draco muttered, pulling the worn deerstalker cap out of his pocket and thrusting it at Harry.
Over tea and biscuits, Harry filled McGonagall in on everything that had happened, including how the Room of Requirement had so cleverly illustrated all the ties between him and Draco. Obviously intrigued, McGonagall had asked shrewd questions about the magic George and Maeve had used, and Harry got the impression that she would be open to new ideas if Maeve ever made good on her threat to speak to her about the Hogwarts curriculum.
Harry heard Draco’s quick inhalation of shock, and was grateful when he didn’t speak. A few raindrops dripped from the trees and hit Harry’s neck, snaking their way in a frigid path down his collar. Harry shivered and bowed his head, straining to feel the presence of his mother and father, of Sirius and Remus. He let his magic spill from his fingers, questing over the ground, but there was nothing for Sentiomancy to find, not even an echo.
Tugging sheepishly at his shirt collar, Draco stared down at his polished shoes and realized that he may have overcompensated for the moment of nudity. His midnight blue tie was well past the bounds of casual house attire even without the waistcoat he had buttoned over his grey shirt. Wearing the colors of an evening storm, Draco was as sharp as the instant before a lightning strike, charged with potential. And it was entirely too much.
Harry laughed helplessly and scooped Draco up in a hug. “The date hasn’t even happened yet, you berk,” he cried. Setting Draco back down on his feet, he grabbed his wrist and said, “Now will you please come on?”
Not that Harry was complaining. He liked everything about Bloom Orchards – the magically preserved flowers winding through the metal entrance gates, the large open rooms with high ceilings and brightly painted walls, the toys and games that catered to a wide range of interests, the sprawling grounds, the clusters of trees that had likely given the place its name. But most of all, Harry appreciated the ease with which the staff interacted with the children. Blooms was a place of warmth and patience and love, even better than Harry had imagined when he burned every letter save theirs.
She gave him a pitying look and nudged a plate of biscuits toward him. Harry picked one up and chewed it forlornly.
Harry shuddered and sobbed once as his stomach roiled dangerously, but he concentrated on the hands and the voice, and then he went still.
“I’m here, Draco, I’m right here,” Harry murmured, running his hands up and down Draco’s back. “You’re with me, darling. You’re
“Merlin’s beard, Maeve!” Draco cried, dropping a rather promising looking biscuit onto the floor. He glowered at her as he swiped it up and threw it into the trash. “What is this? The Wizengamot?”
Ron grunted at that, but he looked at Draco appraisingly. It wasn’t exactly a warm expression, but Draco plunged ahead nonetheless.
Draco’s eyes flashed and he stood up straighter. He nodded once, firmly resolved, and disentangled himself from Harry. He swiped the hair out of his eyes with the air of a man spitting in the face of Death.
When Harry had returned to the courtyard the morning after his fight with Malfoy, he wasn’t sure if he was punishing himself or taking comfort in the lush beauty of the last place they had spoken.
That’s why Draco mentioned the novel, to acknowledge what had happened by the lake that day, to signal that he was open to discussing it further, to imply that Harry could speak freely, without shame or fear. But because Draco had not actually asked, the choice remained Harry’s.
“It was a dark time,” Draco said abruptly, twirling one of the flowers between his fingers. “I had done enough terrible things by that point that I felt entirely worthless. But Evan was just a child, this bright spot of hope and resilience.” A smile ghosted across Draco’s face, fading as quickly as it had come. “I couldn’t hurt him. I couldn’t hurt any of them.” He ripped a petal from the flower, then cringed and set it down carefully in the grass. “So I forced myself to remember all the evil in me, and I turned the pain on myself.”
Furious whispers spilled into the room, drawing Harry and Draco’s eyes to the confrontation framed by the wide living room doorway.
Ron looked utterly perplexed, and guilt flashed across his features whenever he captured one of Luna’s pieces. She appeared unbothered, scattering flower petals where they fell. She had lost a knight, a rook, and almost all of her pawns when she turned to Draco.
“The residue is counteracting her healing spells,” McGonagall explained in a hushed tone. “It worked its way free of the stasis this morning. Thus far, she has managed to slow its spread, but she must constantly re-cast as the hooks twist her spells.”
Harry’s heart sank. Draco had gone rigid again, coiled as tight as a threatened snake, and Harry didn’t know what he’d done wrong. Suddenly, he again felt like an intruder.
interesting, so it would take quite a lot to –” Draco paused and stared hard at Harry, arching a single haughty eyebrow - "
Harry whined low in his throat and cautiously thrust deeper. His knees trembled, threatening to give out. Draco tightened his grip on the back of Harry’s thighs and moaned around his cock, encouraging Harry to keep moving. He felt so
Harry had expected a snarky comeback, something light and playful, but a strange tension overtook Malfoy. He was quiet for a moment, then said, “No, I’m afraid that honor belongs to Granger.”
As soon as the potion was safely in McGonagall’s hands, Draco crashed into Harry, who staggered backward. Struggling to control his sobs, Draco buried his head against Harry’s shoulder and tugged wildly at his own hair.
But as Harry followed him from the room, peppering him with increasingly ridiculous questions about hobbits, something in Draco began to shift. Something that could change everything, if Draco only let it.
This chapter contains brief descriptions of self-harm scars and discussion of a past suicide attempt.
Malfoy appeared beside him a second later, looking almost rueful. He yanked Harry to his feet and reached out to brush the dirt off his sleeves.
Harry ached to stand up for Malfoy, but he wasn’t sure Malfoy would appreciate the gesture. Harry had been watching him, and his approach to conflict seemed to be to disengage. Malfoy accepted the sneers thrown his way and moved on, head down. He was polite and quiet and did not stand up to anyone (though thankfully, there wasn’t much need for that among the eighth years, who seemed content to leave Malfoy alone).
“Oh, Harry – I’m sorry, but for a while now – I mean, we didn’t want to say anything, but –” Hermione trailed off. Rising from her seat, she maneuvered around the table to Harry’s side and placed a hand against his shoulder. “It seemed like you and Ginny were keeping each other company while leading separate lives. Like you were roommates.”
Closing his eyes, Harry inhaled the scent of the tea before taking a sip. His cheeks pinked as he swallowed, and his eyes flicked open.
Harry pulled back, not quite ready to invite Draco into his throat. The idea of it tantalized Harry – Draco’s cock so deep it threatened Harry’s breath, the taste of him covering every inch of Harry’s tongue – but it scared him too. He wasn’t sure he would be good at it right away, and he so wanted this to be good for Draco. Wanted to give Draco something of himself to hold onto as he brewed.
“Malfoy, I’m fine!” Harry shouted, remorse cracking into frustration. “Do you even remember who I am? I’ve survived way worse than this!”
Draco let out a shaky sob before partially collapsing. He bent over himself, burying his head in his hands, elbows braced on his knees.
For the first time since feeling those icy hooks dig into his skin, Harry believed, right down to his bones, that he and Draco would figure it out.
times?” Draco was shaking now, body trembling in barely suppressed anger. “And you didn’t bother to tell me?”
“Don’t worry,” Harry purred, voice warm and just the tiniest bit seductive. “I have flowers for you, too.”
Harry swallowed and set down his bread, eyes going soft, expression so tender that it broke something loose in Draco.
Beneath the table, Draco rested his foot against Harry’s, and everything suddenly felt surreal, like this moment was an echo of itself, reverberating against the past. Harry remembered the first afternoon he and Draco had spent like this in the shop, drinking this very same tea. Draco, bloodied and bandaged. Draco so closed off, and yet somehow finding the courage to show himself to Harry, piece by careful piece.
Harry knew that if he wanted to excel at the Auror Academy, this was the type of coursework he should pursue in the coming terms. He even had a vague idea about focusing his interdisciplinary project on developing not-Aperiomancy as an intelligence gathering tactic.
Their mouths moved chastely, seeking comfort more than anything else. The kiss tasted like an oasis, the relief of a spring in the desert, life-giving water, fresh and cold. Draco soon grew breathless, and he broke away to rest his forehead against Harry’s.
Draco turned his face away, eyes squeezing shut in a tight expression of pain. But it only lasted a second. He sucked in one quick breath, and then everything terrible seemed to flow out of him. He looked up at Harry, and his eyes were shining with nothing but desire and love. He took Harry’s hand and pressed his palm against his chest, just like he had in the Forbidden Forest.
“This is from my dream,” Draco said, kicking at the pebbles beneath his feet. He gestured toward the cave, eyes trained on it warily. “Eventually, I go in, or it sucks me in somehow, and Nagini is waiting.” He gulped, then turned his back on the cave, gazing out at the featureless void with a troubled expression.
“Your tea doesn’t have enough blossoms in it,” Draco said suddenly. It sounded as though he considered this fact a personal affront.
Despite the urgency he felt, Harry did allow himself to look up from the books every now and then to watch Draco and Hermione. They had both been looking forward to the Arithmancy workshop, and were less than pleased with the bizarre focus on Divination.
“I’m so sorry,” he cried, raising his hands in a placating gesture. He looked anxiously around him, until his eyes caught on the little enchanted lanterns floating up by the ceiling. Relieved that he hadn’t just appeared out of nowhere in a Muggle shop, Harry attempted to explain. “I – I’ve been having some apparition trouble?”
“Yes,” Hermione said, nodding enthusiastically. “The book was quite definitive, and it referenced multiple sources. And once I had that piece of information, everything started to make sense.”
He glanced at Harry tentatively, clearly unsure if he should have spoken, if he was allowed to mention the girl he had so relentlessly bullied. Harry wasn’t sure how to feel about it either, though he could tell that Malfoy had meant his words; the compliment had been genuine.
At which point, Draco, wearing a comically shocked expression, had spluttered and choked on his mouthful of cheese. Harry beamed delightedly at Hermione, telling her to help herself to tea while he thumped a rapidly reddening Draco on the back.
“He’s sitting under the apple tree,” she said. “And he looks miserable. I don’t think he’ll turn you away.” She sat in Draco’s empty chair, clucking her tongue disapprovingly at the stubborn jut of Harry’s chin.
Draco didn’t seem to notice. His hand had inched across the table until it was almost touching Harry’s and his brow was furrowed in concern.
“She’s part of a research program, studying how the Nazca Lines intersect with ley lines and how that affects the magic of the area.”
Harry sucked in heaving breaths, eyes clenched shut. As his heart began to slow, he felt familiar hands on his back and shoulders. The buzzing in his ears faded, and then there was a voice, a voice he loved, whispering over and over, the words given unto the air like a sacred ritual.
“Don’t bother. I already told her I was probably going to kidnap you.” Harry shot Draco a cheeky grin. “She was delighted.”
This one's a bit of an emotional whirlwind. Please read with care, and check the end notes for content warnings and potential triggers.
Harry’s hips snapped forward, driving his cock mercilessly into Draco. He did it again, and again, and again, rhythm erratic, helpless under the sudden onslaught of sensation. Draco whimpered and shuddered and pleaded, until Harry lifted one of Draco’s legs over his shoulder. The angle shifted, Harry pushed deeper, and then Draco screamed.
Harry caught his hand and kissed his palm. Draco whimpered, eyes still wide with shock. But then something in him shifted. His expression hardened into fierceness, the lines of his forehead almost angry.
McGonagall sequestered the entire Potions wing, affording Draco privacy to work, but after he’d wasted an entire morning pacing and frazzled, Harry dragged him bodily from the dungeons and out into the November cold.
Harry’s smile widened. His hand drifted across Draco’s pillow, stopping just short of actually touching him. “I can see why Maeve turns eleventy-one every year. These hobbits definitely know how to throw a party.”
A frigid wind gusted through Draco’s window, jolting him out of the memory. He shivered and wrapped himself more tightly in the blanket draped over his lap. Enjoyable as it was to cuddle into the cushions and think of Harry, Draco was definitely beginning to regret not following Harry home.
Draco nodded and sipped at the tea. It was their signature green blend, crisp and light with notes of honey. It bolstered him, and he realized that he really did feel better. There was something cathartic about letting Maeve share his pain.
and there was no harm in that. Harry was allowed to be curious about the man who’d made his life hell, and then lied to save him. He was allowed to wonder about the man who protected him at the risk of torture.
Everything around them was peaceful. The steady rain outside seemed to cocoon them in their own cozy little bubble, blanketing the grounds in its soothing hiss. Back on the windowsill, the glass flower swayed slowly from side to side, every so often catching the light from one of Draco’s colorful potions and flaring up with a dazzling radiance. Harry felt an odd sort of kinship with it, now that he knew where it had come from. He sighed and tightened his hold on Draco.
It was not a night for teasing, Harry knew, so he gave Draco exactly what he needed. Firm strokes, a twist of the wrist, a thumb swiping over his slit to smear the pre-come gathered there.
When he had burst into the cottage earlier that afternoon, livid with Blaise and desperate to see Harry, Ginny Weasley had been sitting at the table, surrounded by pastry crumbs.
“Then perhaps that balance enhances the strength of your magic as well?” Draco said. “It makes sense – magic moves through the body. It may be that Muggle defensive techniques open better pathways in the body for the magic to flow through.”
Harry pressed Draco’s palm against his heart, feeling tears prick at his eyes. “Oh, Draco – oh, my love – you already have. I promise you, you already have.”
Malfoy’s fingers rested against Harry’s and lingered one heartbeat too long. When Harry looked up, Malfoy was staring at his mouth. Harry’s breath caught and he tightened his grip, but Malfoy pulled his hand away.
Harry glanced back at his former rival – his friend, really – and felt a rush of emotion threaten to spill into tears. He suddenly wanted to thank Draco, to tell him how much he was helping him and how much that meant, but he couldn’t find the words.
“You do not need to make any decisions now,” she continued gently, “but rest assured, you will have an offer from Hogwarts upon your graduation.”
Blaise nodded. His mouth flattened as he pursed his lips, but then he sighed and angled himself to face Draco. “It was an old product design, from before the war. George’s notes said it worked perfectly, but the bond was stronger than he intended. It was meant to create a general sense that the other person needed you, but instead it brought you physically together. Not dangerous, just inconvenient, so eventually he abandoned the idea.”
He sat back on his haunches, drinking in the sight of Draco’s body, content to let the tension build between them. As the minutes ticked by, Draco quickly lost his composure, and Harry delighted in the opportunity to make him squirm.
“But Blaise wanted you to keep some of the Malfoy money?” Harry prompted, running a finger over the bizarrely shiny buttons of Draco’s light blue shirt.
Harry covered Draco’s hand with his own. “I really am sorry, Malfoy. I won’t do anything like that again, I promise.”
“No,” Harry rasped, throat uncomfortably dry. “It’s – it’s ok.” He rubbed a shaky hand across his face. “I – was sort of thinking the same thing today. Not about the dream, I mean, or the blankness thing. But that does make sense. I was thinking that I need – something.” He swallowed hard. “Excuse me, I need the loo.”
Draco’s hand stilled. Harry raised his head to look at him, but Draco wouldn’t meet his eyes. He was blinking rapidly and there were two spots of deep red high on his cheekbones. Harry took a shaky breath, then he leaned forward, took Draco’s head in his hands, and marked each flushed spot with a messy kiss.
Draco took a shaky breath and visibly reclaimed his composure. He straightened and folded his hands neatly into his lap. “What I mean to say is – thank you, Headmistress. I accept.”
“There’s actually something I want to do first,” Harry said. He hesitated, then asked, “Will you come to the Forbidden Forest with me?”
To Harry’s chagrin, Draco did not immediately fall on top of him. His fingers twitched, but he backed slowly away from Harry. When he reached the door, the corner of his mouth quirked up. “Wait,” he repeated, then strode from the room.
Without breaking the kiss, Draco started to cry. Silent tears coursed down his cheeks, eyes welling too quickly for the moisture to be blinked away. Harry pulled back, running a thumb over Draco’s cheekbones.
“Took you long enough,” Draco scoffed, but his eyes were warm as he watched Harry begin to arrange his colorful mugs throughout the square cubbyholes of the shelf. “It was half assembled on the floor when I was here a week ago.”
Harry wasn’t sure what he had expected from the Hogwarts Reclamation Ball, but it certainly wasn’t his nemesis –
“Potter, you’re being more than usually dense.” Malfoy crossed his arms over his chest. “That is literally what you just said. ‘Maybe you should be an auror,’” he parroted back to Harry.
Harry had to stop himself from reaching out to lift Malfoy’s chin. “It doesn’t mean they’re true,” he insisted. “And it doesn’t mean you deserve to hear them.”
A sick fear skittered across Harry’s body, slicing through him like dead leaves scraping harshly against the pavement. He felt goosebumps rise on his arms in the sudden chill.
Harry hesitated in front of the showers, but decided to take a run instead of apparating. He could clean off at home. There was a discrete wizarding pub with a floo only a couple miles from the Brixton Kickboxing Club, and the cardio would make up for leaving the gym earlier than normal. Besides, Harry was still a little wary of apparition after the incident with Malfoy a week ago. Not that Harry had been attempting to apparate at the time, but what else could have squeezed him through space like that? He certainly hadn’t touched a Portkey.
Draco whined and mumbled, and hearing the posh git come so completely undone pushed Harry right over the edge. He came hard, and was on his knees in an instant, swallowing Draco down.
Harry groaned and rolled his eyes. The clichéd gesture was almost enough to goad him into another bout, but he knew it was no good. His muscles ached and his mind kept wandering.
Because in some ways, it was their scars that joined them. Harry and Draco had been casualties of war, shackled to opposite sides, but marked and tormented and broken by the same evil man. They had stitched themselves back together, and despite the cost of that, they could both see the strength and beauty in the scars left behind.
“Mmhmm,” Harry agreed, beginning to unbutton Draco’s shirt, tracing his tongue slowly upward as he uncovered that deliciously pale skin. Keeping up the pretense of conversation was becoming difficult, but Harry was unwilling to give in so soon. “What about classwork? I know the workshop was cancelled, but McGonagall wants our proposals by the end of the week.”
It wasn’t surprising, really. The apparition had been near constant the past week and a half, every stray thought seeming to snap them to each other’s sides. Harry had wound up at the tea shop almost every morning, Draco stammering out apologies while Maeve laughed gleefully in the background. Last Saturday, when Draco was supposedly absorbed in refining his selection of springtime teas, Harry had apparated into the workshop so many times that he finally gave up and spent the whole day there, lending a hand when needed and staring dreamily at Draco while pretending to read a Defense book.
He thought it might be the memory of Draco just out of the shower, so elegant and self-possessed, even while nude and shaking. Harry wasn’t sure why his mind kept circling back to that afternoon, wasn’t sure what about it bothered him. Draco was beautiful, yes, but Harry had seen beautiful men before and had never lost sleep over it. But with Draco it was different, and Harry did not know why.
Draco sat back on his heels, brow creased as he studied Harry. “Are you alright? Should I – do you need me to – to call someone?”
“I was just about to put the kettle on,” Potter said, mouth edging into a beautiful, crooked curve. “It’s nothing like what you could make, but do you want a cup?”
Draco didn’t speak as quickly, but the way he clutched his wrist to his chest was answer enough. He nodded at Maeve. “Thank you.”
“The first time it happened, Draco didn’t need anything,” Harry said. Pain welled up in him at the memory of Draco’s bruised eye and swollen cheek. “He was perfectly fine until I crash landed on top of him. I didn’t help him. I
Harry yanked at his restraints, but not to resist or continue the duel. No, he had surrendered entirely to his ex-rival’s dominance.
He moved to flank McGonagall’s left side. Draco stayed at the edge of the clearing, but shifted so that he was behind McGonagall as well.
Hermione huffed softly, displeased as ever at being proven wrong. “Walk me through the shower moment again. What were you doing right before Harry arrived?”
Harry wanted to bury his hands in its warmth and forget the slick unpleasantness he had just plunged his magic into…
“Is this the kind of distraction you had in mind, Potter?” Draco asked. He trailed a finger along Harry’s collarbone as his tongue explored the skin beneath his ear.
As soon as the door slammed in Harry’s face, Draco collapsed in front of it, body heaving with the force of his sobs.
Draco waved that off with a hand. “I don’t think it would have helped. Assuming you did not set up spells to trap intruders –” he paused and Harry shook his head – “it seems likely that the magic drawing us together has unknown requirements that must be met before we can part.”
An embarrassingly desperate whimper escaped Harry’s lips, and he felt Draco’s mouth pressed to his ear.
In front of Malfoy stood a plain wooden door, unremarkable in every way, except for the riot of color exploding through its frame. Dozens of wild, gorgeous flowers were forcing their way through every gap of the closed door, growing through the hinges and lock, spilling over the threshold. Harry could only stare as he breathed in the same crisp, sobering scent from last night.
Draco stood and Harry nearly toppled into the empty seat. He jerked upright, managing to stifle a gasp. He felt the back of his neck heat at the implied rejection.
Draco shifted in his chair. The sound was downright indecent. Worse even than the first time Harry had been here, when he’d sucked raspberry sauce from his finger and Draco, cock desperately hard, had been unable to look away.
At that, Draco jumped, cracking his head against the solid wooden window frame. He did not even register the pain.
Under Draco’s fiery stare, Harry grew bold. He reached a hand back into the wardrobe and snagged one of his red and gold striped ties. Raising his eyebrows at Draco, Harry leaned into him and brushed the tie across one of his wrists.
“Hey,” Harry said, placing his hands on Draco’s shoulders. His touch felt so good, a steadying weight to keep Draco grounded. “What’s wrong, sweetheart?”
Malfoy had gone right back to dueling, as if the interruption was hardly worth noting, but Harry had felt a warm pang in his chest, and his attacks weren’t quite so pointed after that.
Harry flipped another page in his book and noted that Malfoy was chewing on his thumbnail as he read. His feet were up on the chair, knees pulled into his chest, and he was wearing an oversized green jumper that looked sinfully soft. Harry’s fingers twitched, wrinkling the page. Ron glanced up at him from the floor, where he was trouncing Seamus at chess, and gave Harry a questioning look. Harry just grinned at him, then forced himself to relax and look back at the book. Ron shrugged and went back to his game.
Draco was a plume of golden fire, blazing ever brighter as his flames coursed through Harry’s veins. All the world was melting, and Harry’s worries were insubstantial as ash.
Draco refocused on Harry, a puzzled expression etched across his face. Harry pointedly looked down at his own nakedness and then back to Draco.
Harry was moaning softly now, working a hand over his own hardness. It was good, so good, to touch himself while thinking of Draco. He hadn’t done this yet, hadn’t allowed himself to, had been afraid to look too closely at this tender thing growing between them, lest he spook it and chase it away.
“Draco, I don’t want to lie to you either,” Harry said. “I wasn’t sure if I should say anything, but McGonagall told me some of this when we went to see the Room of Requirement. She told me about your donation to Hogwarts, and about you creating the war orphan organization.”
And shooting through the space between them, connecting their bodies at random points, were thin beams of light.
“Yes,” Draco said quietly. “I don’t know that I’ll make the appeal, but I appreciate what you’re trying to do for me.” He traced his fingers absently over Harry’s knee, hardly realizing what he was doing. “I just – I don’t know if I can –”
“We’re not,” Harry said. “None of this is real. We’re not alone anymore.” He raised his voice a little, glaring daggers at the walls around them. “We don’t have to stay here.”
“The night of the Ball,” he went on, “I had only meant to sit with the flowers. I was delighted to discover them in the garden. I hadn’t thought I’d ever see their like again. I wanted to take a moment with them, to appreciate everything I had been given, to promise the flowers and myself that I would not squander it. But the garden was so potently magical, I couldn’t help myself.” He smiled sheepishly. “I got curious.”
Straining his ears to catch Lavender’s footsteps, Harry stifled a groan. Wooded settings were his least favorite of the randomized terrains the practice rooms provided, reminding him too much of the Forbidden Forest, of Voldemort’s maniacal laugh as Harry’s body hit the ground. Harry gritted his teeth as the jeers of Death Eaters echoed in his ears, joining the already unceasing refrain of Draco’s muffled sobs.
Harry caught Draco’s left hand in his and brought his lips to the Dark Mark in a tender kiss. Draco sucked in a shocked breath and jerked back. Harry followed him.
Harry rested against the hard seat back, allowing the swaying motion of the train to lull him to just the edge of sleep. Not quite dozing, he hooked his ankle around the metal pole next to him and tried not to fall sideways into Draco.
“Hmm?” Harry breathed, mouthing at Draco’s balls. “I didn’t quite catch that, darling. I want to suck you. Can I?”
Not turning away from his book, Draco ignored Harry. He made an absorbed kind of sound, as if something in the story had really caught his attention, and flipped to the next page.
“And all the times we did help, it was because we chose to,” Harry argued. “It wasn’t forced. We could just as easily have sat next to the barrier and waited for the other person to handle it themselves.”
A creeping chill pricked at Draco’s fingers, unease building in his palms. “I only drink coffee when I’m angry,” he said slowly, as if he believed Blaise might have forgotten, as if the offer might be laughed off as a silly mistake.
Draco leaned his forehead against Harry’s, sighing in relief, but he stepped back hastily when McGonagall joined them.
As the pause lengthened, Draco’s breath quickened, but despite his obvious arousal, a sudden shyness overcame him, lending a delicate cast to his features.
Besides, from this position, he could keep one eye on Draco, who sat at the center of a circle of bubbling cauldrons. Even though he couldn’t see Draco’s face, Harry found the sight of his mussed blond bun more than a little comforting.
Harry was close – his legs were shaking and he could feel his balls drawing up – but suddenly, he couldn’t bear the thought of coming without feeling Draco’s prick in his hand.
“Of course,” he replied without turning, not wanting Maeve to see his clenched jaw. “Just a moment.”
“This one is my favorite,” Draco said, rubbing a thumb along the rim almost reverently. “It would pair perfectly with the best tea I ever invented. I was imagining that, the night I spent here.”
At a few points, Declan had looked on the verge of joining in, his gaze wandering between the kids and the equipment shed. He never actually did, but by the end of the hour lesson, he was clapping and cheering each time someone caught the ball.
“Would you mind vanishing those tea leaves?” Draco asked, standing to return the containers to the shelves. “It’ll be neater than trying to sweep it all up.”
“I know that,” Harry sighed. He crossed his arms over his stomach, scratching nervously at an elbow. Steady as the words were, it was clear he did not fully believe them.
“You’re right,” Harry said. “I’m so sorry, Gin. I must have been a terrible boyfriend. And I never even knew.”
“Oh,” Harry breathed. He rested a hand on Draco’s knee, fingers just inches from Draco’s own. “Why – why did he – did he want money?”
Draco’s thighs fell open, and he hooked an ankle around the back of Harry’s leg, encouraging him to move. Harry braced his arms on either side of Draco’s head, staring into his heated eyes, not wanting to miss a moment of this.
Perpendicular to the desk sat two long work tables with enough space to have at least ten cauldrons boiling at once. Beside them was a massive cupboard with its doors thrown open to reveal row upon row of Potions equipment, some of which Draco had never even seen in person before, let alone dreamed of owning. There were also shelves full of baskets and glass jars containing every conceivable ingredient, as well as enough empty space to fill with other supplies.
“Well, this place is a bit distracting,” Harry said, futilely trying to bat away a misty cloud of the pale blue light. “But we can’t just keep following these lights. We’ll never get out.”
,” Harry insisted, holding his arms out and gesturing at his uninjured body. “It startled me the first time, that’s all.”
It was a lot to take in, and the conversation ground to a halt. McGonagall sent Harry on his way shortly thereafter, likely knowing that his head was reeling.
“It wasn’t very specific,” Harry admitted, “but they asked if I’d be interested in volunteering with the kids. They probably want me to share my inspiring orphan story or something.” The last sentence was bitter, his lip curling derisively.
In the nearly three weeks since that night at the lake, they had exchanged friendly nods most mornings, passed each other serving platters at meals or materials in class on three separate occasions, engaged in small talk at the bathroom sinks twice,
“I’m so sorry,” Harry gasped. His hand was covering his mouth and there were tears shining in his eyes. “I thought – but I – I shouldn’t have – I’ll leave, I’ll just – give you some space.”
Harry picked up the tin with a trembling hand. And there, in Draco’s precise handwriting, was one small addition to the original label. A little arrow between
Though they fell into bed every night in a tangle of limbs and desperate kisses, exhaustion dragged them into oblivion all too soon.
McGonagall had turned away from them and wandered over to one of the large windows. Her back was straight, but she seemed small and bowed down somehow, as if the years had suddenly crashed down on her all at once.
They were quiet again for a time, the only sound the gentle lapping of the lake water when tiny creatures disturbed it. The sound was comforting; it created an atmosphere that seemed to invite confidences.
“I know.” Malfoy’s hands tightened on the book, crinkling the pages. He winced slightly, and smoothed them down again before setting the volume aside. “Neville promised to keep an eye on her. She’ll probably know he’s following her, but she won’t chase him away.”
“Er – yeah,” Harry said, almost entirely distracted by Draco’s glancing touches. “It’s a kind of martial arts, I guess.”
“How difficult is the process, Mr. Malfoy?” McGonagall asked. “Would it be within the capabilities of our NEWT level Potions students?”
Hermione laughed. “I was surprised too. But he asked if he could sit down, and then he told me he’d been reading Fitzgerald and asked if I could possibly recommend any other Muggle authors he might like. He was very stiff and polite. I think he gets more posh when he’s nervous.” She shrugged. “I gave him some titles and now he comes and talks to me when he finishes one.”
“Yes,” Draco said easily. “I have not touched the money, but it’s there if I ever really need it, I suppose. And as Blaise assured me, I can always funnel it back into the organization at a later date.”
Draco blew out a breath and nodded reluctantly. “It’s just – there must be so much you could teach me. Too much for a few weeks.”
It wasn’t exactly how Draco would have described it… but listening to Harry distill Draco’s flavors into words made Draco feel breathless in a way he had not been prepared for. It made him feel seen, like Harry was deconstructing him with gentle hands and reverent fingers, taking the time to understand, and to care for, every last piece.
Draco spun in a slow circle, then walked cautiously around the room, running his fingers over the shelves and equipment in awe.
Harry turned the ring over in his fingers, carefully running a thumb across the subtle engraving of what must be Narcissus blossoms.
Harry resisted the impulse and stood up. He wandered to a shady corner of the courtyard, where the blooms were more heavily clustered, wondering if he should try his not-Aperiomancy again. After all, there was no reason for the beautiful flowers to feel so dark and frightening. Maybe he was overtired, or maybe he just needed more practice with this kind of sensory magic. Maybe there was something he had missed.
Draco shook his head, nudging Harry with his knee. “You’ve been a good friend to me, Harry. I believe some honesty is the least of what I owe you.”
Draco wondered what those colors signified, but before he could get lost in theorizing, Maeve continued.
“What?” With some difficulty, Draco refocused on Harry. He ran a hand over his face. “No – no, sorry. It’s just – fascinating.”
Harry frowned. Absently, he began to slide his container of cumin back and forth along the excess space on the spice rack. Was that what he wanted? To be friends with Draco Malfoy?
Harry’s heart pounded, blood flaring to life at the implicit challenge. If Draco wanted to play a little, Harry was more than happy to oblige.
Draco glanced upward nervously, and Harry saw a tiny drop of sweat trickle down his temple. He may not be able to fully sense magic yet, but Draco clearly felt something. The air seemed to buzz as the magic hovered over Harry, a whirlwind at his fingertips, awaiting his command. His hands shook as static seemed to zip through his veins, the sheer magnitude of what he was holding burning him up from the inside out.
“Yeah,” Harry said, jumping down from the window and grabbing Draco’s wrist. “I see them. Come down from there now, alright?”
Harry bit his lip. Despite having agreed that Draco deserved better, nothing about McGonagall’s implacable expression suggested that she would be open to Harry’s plan. She clearly disapproved of him not telling Draco he saw the letter, and Harry wasn’t sure if she would refuse to be involved because of that. But this was for Draco, and Harry had to try.
He gave Draco one more lingering kiss, then hoisted himself out of bed and started to pull on his clothes.
Draco’s forehead wrinkled in distaste. “Some type of financial thing I will never understand. Heaps of money, arrogant clients, charity functions, that kind of thing.”
Harry sucked in a painful breath and shifted along the wall toward the center of the bed, a foot closer to Malfoy.
It didn’t seem like Draco would be emerging anytime soon, so Harry strode off to the bedroom without a word. He returned with the pot that held the glass flower. Setting it prominently on the table, he settled in to wait.
Harry frowned, but Draco went on before he could interject. “The dreams just happen sometimes. You know how it is.”
Draco’s fingers were digging into his left forearm now, directly over the spot where the faded Dark Mark still marred his skin. Harry’s heart clenched painfully, and he had to stop himself from yanking up Draco’s sleeve and covering his arm with kisses. Harry glanced nervously at McGonagall, but he needn’t have worried. She ignored Draco’s implication entirely, answering him with no reference to his ex-Death Eater status.
Draco swept his hands up Harry’s chest to cup his face, then kissed him greedily, one foot rubbing sweetly along Harry’s calf. Harry gasped, wrapping his arms around Draco to pull him on top. Their chests were pressed together, sending a shock wave straight to Harry’s heart.
“No!” Harry shouted, alarmed. “No, not – not really.” He floundered, tugging at his hair anxiously. “I
“McGonagall said you worked in the greenhouses?” Harry asked, absently flexing his fingers. “During the Hogwarts reparations?”
With an appreciative hum, Draco glanced over his shoulder at Harry before stepping into the bath. He submerged himself slowly, and the candlelight played over his skin, blanketing him in shifting planes of mystery and shadow.
Harry’s eyes widened. He began to stammer out a response, but Draco cut him off with a laugh. “Give off, Potter. I was only teasing.”
“He was a good teacher,” Malfoy offered quietly. “And he seemed like a good man. I… I wish he had lived.”
Without waiting for a response, she whipped her wand forward and pointed it at the thickest clump of orange. She jerked her hand back then, making a snapping motion with her wrist, and the orange light began to unravel. It floated up, away from the other lights, snaking its way through the air until every last inch of it was swallowed by Maeve’s wand.
– a crisp green blend, with strong notes of basil and mint. He returned to the table and refilled his and Harry’s glasses. “I’m probably boring you.”
Shoving his socked feet under the pillows at the top of the bed, Harry bolstered himself with the comfort of their warm weight and went back to contemplating the Death Eater wands.
As the silence lengthened, the incessant ticking of the cuckoo clock seemed to grow louder and louder. Harry normally found the sound vaguely pleasant, if he noticed it at all, but he was on edge enough now that it burrowed beneath his skin, syncing up with his heartbeat until Harry thought he might run mad.
–” the way the words dropped from Harry’s tongue made it abundantly clear that he’d not believed that for a second – “you should actually invite me over. I like this.”
When Draco swiped a hand through his disheveled, sweaty hair, biting his lip and frowning in concentration, Harry nearly groaned aloud. The git had no right to make potions research look so unbearably sexy – even if he
Heart racing, Draco straightened his spine, determined to make a better effort with Weasley. “I hear your mother is a remarkable cook,” he said, hoping the comment could turn into some semblance of a conversation.
“I’m not the best at asking for help,” Harry admitted, closing his eyes as he buried his face in the crook of Draco’s shoulder. “With the apparition, I had to let you help me. You were here, so I couldn’t hide it. I’m afraid I won’t know how to tell you what I need, if you’re not here when I – er, break.”
It had been inevitable, really. Draco was far too intrigued by the prospect of testing his Muggle/magical fusion theories, even if it was through Defense instead of Potions. And that aside, Draco was far too in love to turn away from something that Harry was so invested in.
Harry blinked slowly. “I mean, is this really what you want to talk about right now?” Harry ran a hand along Draco’s waist and raised his eyebrows. “After,
Harry and Draco exchanged a panicked look before Draco quickly lowered his head again. There had been shame in Draco’s eyes, the grey smudged like faded pencil. An aberration, Harry thought, like the remnants of a mistake.
Draco tossed his head, ready to deflect the question with a smirk and a joke, but it was like Harry could sense the coming façade. He slumped a little, going grey around the edges, resignation stealing his usual light. The quip died on Draco’s tongue.
Malfoy’s eyes went wide and his focus shifted to a point over Harry’s shoulder. A shudder passed through him. Finally, he nodded slowly, then pulled his knees to his chest, arms wrapped around them. The movement jostled Harry’s hand, and he let go of Malfoy reluctantly.
Harry felt his cheeks heating, remembering when he had changed clothes after class. He thought of the care he had taken, running a hand over the transfigured robes before hanging them neatly in the very back of his wardrobe. He didn’t know when he would ever have the opportunity to wear the sleek black suit, but Malfoy had made it for him, in a way, and it would have felt wrong to change it back.
Harry rolled onto his side to face Malfoy, giving him his full attention, and waited for him to continue.
Draco’s words were matter-of-fact, not even a hint of regret in his tone, but it was like Harry could see right through him. The sorrow in Harry’s expression shook Draco to the core, fraying the edges of his stitched-together convictions.
It had been a little awkward, trying to get to know these strangers while demonstrating various tea blends, but Draco found himself glad that Maeve was being so thorough. They couldn’t let just
Malfoy was fidgeting beside him. Now that Harry had started to speak, Malfoy’s manic, questioning intellect was back in full force. He was gnawing on his lip and clenching his hands in the fabric of his robes, as if to prevent himself from grabbing Harry and shaking more words out of him.
Slamming his hands against the bark of a tree now, Harry forget Lavender, forget even the duel. All he could see was Draco’s closed door.
“I don’t know,” Harry said slowly. “I haven’t really thought about it. It’s challenging, but in a different way.”
Though Draco had said Harry’s name the night before, it had been in the throes of regret and apology. Hearing it now, spoken in the light of morning and suffused with want, filled Harry with a boundless joy. The syllables seemed to bloom from Draco, coloring the air with bright bursts of shimmering possibility.
–” Malfoy continued icily, accenting the word with a glare - “if you have chased me down this corridor to ask me why I was late this morning, I will certainly lose my temper.”
Harry hummed against Draco’s mouth, but when Draco wriggled a hand between them, seeking Harry’s erection, Harry pulled away.
The image of Draco’s naked skin, pale and glistening, flickered again in Harry’s mind. The memory seemed to shimmer between them, unspoken yet strangely insistent. Harry forced himself to breathe slowly as he fought off a blush.
“Harry?” Draco asked softly. “Would you explain it to me? Why you were so angry? I thought about it all night, and I think I understand, but I want to be sure.”
“It’ll be alright, Potter,” Malfoy said, resting a hand against Harry’s back. Harry could feel the heat of it through his shirt. “The information from your clandestine courtyard trip has given me an idea.”
Draco knew Harry could never be his to keep, but miracle of miracles, he had him now, and he meant to give Harry everything he could before the end.
“Of course,” Draco breathed. He blinked rapidly and his expression cleared. “Did he tell you his plan?”
“With the considerable amount remaining,” McGonagall went on calmly, “he created and funded a new organization that cares for war orphans.”
“It was all over your face the moment I sent Mr. Malfoy off to speak with Professor Sprout,” McGonagall replied in her usual no-nonsense manner. “I have not seen you look so relieved since you successfully summoned your broom during the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament.”
Harry was there in an instant, pressing himself against Draco’s back and wrapping his arms around him. Draco collapsed against him, shuddering. His shirt was damp with sweat, his breathing harsh and erratic.
“Maeve,” Draco said finally, looking up from where he had been admiring the work tables. One hand still rested on the marbled surface. “What… what is this?”
Finally, Draco’s cock sprang free, narrower than Harry’s, but long and hard and perfect. Draco sat up to pull the sweatpants off his feet. He lifted the garment teasingly, hooked around a single finger, and then dropped it to the floor. Leaning back on his hands, he spread his thighs just enough to give Harry a tantalizing glimpse of his arse.
“Not really,” Draco said with a shrug. “Just a little, in the back of my mind. I can’t figure it out.”
“I felt – I felt like it was hopeless. That I’ll never escape the person I had to be to win the war, never be allowed to be something other than Harry Potter, savior of the wizarding world.” Harry sketched air quotes with his fingers. “The letters make everything feel – I don’t know –
“The Ministry will handle the discovery and dispersal of the residue at all other sites, though as there was not a deluge of accidents and injuries over the summer, I imagine Hogwarts will prove to be the worst site of contamination. I am confident that Ms. Jaffey and Mr. Dahnroe can handle the rest. You and Mr. Potter will return to your studies.”
A slow smile unfurled across Harry’s face, warmth pooling like caramel in his gut. The hooks bit and snapped at him, but Harry hardly noticed. Because beneath the icy chill, there was something else, and it twinkled all across the Pitch.
Draco forced himself to take a full breath, and slowly, oh so slowly, he relaxed every muscle. He had fought against this for so long that it was almost impossible to surrender to it. But Draco allowed his eyelids to flutter open, and he settled his gaze on Harry.
He approached cautiously, not wanting to startle her. Her posture was very straight, her focus ironclad as her eyes darted across the page. Only when Harry’s shadow fell over the book did she look up, fingers tightening on its edges as if she could not bear to be pulled from the story.
Inside, Draco dug the tea tin from his trousers and put the kettle on. There was a chicken and ham pie resting on the stove, its crust gleaming golden in the low light of the kitchen. Draco’s heart fluttered.
sounding entirely wrong in McGonagall’s warm Scottish brogue, but soon he was awash in physical sensation, registering the change of spells only when there was a shift in the pain.
And so they had settled into cheerful taunts and teasing, never again letting anything real invade the sanctity of morning dueling. Harry liked it that way, and he was fairly certain Lavender did too. This was a place apart, somewhere to train without thinking, somewhere they could just
Harry’s startled inhale only added to Draco’s embarrassment. He practically leapt up from the wall, brushing off his trousers as he said a hasty goodbye.
When Draco blinked awake an hour or so later, the clouds had cleared and the sun was high in the sky.
Draco cradled Harry’s head in his hands. “Thank you,” he whispered, relief spilling over the quiet lust that had darkened his eyes.
Draco suddenly pulled away. He reached a hand up and ran tentative fingers along Harry’s jaw. Harry struggled to open his eyes.
Harry stood to examine the shelf and found a shockingly large collection of Muggle cookbooks. Sandwiched in the middle were three fat leather tomes.
“They’re going to be just fine,” she assured them. “There is extensive damage to their cores, but that we can heal.”
Just then, Driffield’s gruff voice echoed through the small room. “Change partners! It’s necessary to get a sense of the whole spectrum of magical frequencies. Otherwise, your resonance will be too narrow to aid your work.” He seemed to be ignoring the fact that none of the eighth years had yet cast a successful Aperiomancy spell.
Smoke poured out, immediately obliterating the clean aroma of the flowers. Harry and Malfoy both choked, but as the smoke began to thin, they moved resolutely through the door. Inside, the room screamed devastation. Every last inch was black with soot, scorched and bruised and crumbling.
Harry groaned softly, tugging at a particularly stubborn knot, and Draco’s pulse quickened. He imagined coming up behind Harry, running his hands over those toned thighs, lingering a moment on Harry’s arse, then continuing up his spine toward broad shoulders, mouthing at the back of Harry’s neck, feeling the heat of him through the thin cotton of his shirt.
“I’ll still be here,” Draco said. “Whatever you need.” He butted his head gently against Harry’s, coaxing him out of hiding.
“Or I would have.” Harry shrugged agreeably. Then he actually thought about it and nodded. “Probably I would have.”
Harry cocked his head playfully, while Draco seemed to be trying to disappear. And then Harry couldn’t hold it in anymore. All the feelings that had been cavorting inside him bubbled over into pure, joyful laughter.
Harry had been brushing aside his doubts about Malfoy, fleeing any thought of the man’s actions during the war, looking ahead to a future where Malfoy would say
Hermione gave him a pitying look, but her face smoothed over quickly enough that Harry wasn’t sure he hadn’t imagined it.
Harry thought back to Malfoy’s trial, recalling how gaunt Malfoy had looked, as if he barely had the strength to hold himself upright. Harry’s palms had ached afterward, sore from how tightly he had gripped the arms of his chair with every aggressive question Malfoy had been asked.
Wilfred beamed up at him before scrambling back onto his broom. He ran a few steps, then jumped, managing to launch himself into the air, albeit clumsily.
“The magic – or residue, I guess,” Harry continued, taking pity on Malfoy. “It was like little hooks gripping onto my magic. I tried to pull away and then everything went icy.” Malfoy frowned as Harry shuddered involuntarily. “You know when something is so cold it feels like it burns you?”
“How was your day?” Harry asked, in an obvious attempt to change the subject. He had taken his hands out of Draco’s pocket and was idly toying with the hoodie string.
With a resigned sigh, Draco closed the leather-bound book he had been writing in and tossed it onto his bed. It had been at least an hour since the intricate formula he was carefully teasing apart had spiraled out of his control, and he knew he’d make no more headway tonight.
Harry rested a hand against the wood, his magic spilling out as he imagined all the things that could happen in this cottage, all the things they could share if it was this life they chose.
Harry chuckled, marveling at how Malfoy could always see right through him. The sound caught in his throat as Malfoy brushed past, trailing teasing fingers along Harry’s arm.
Harry’s answering laugh, echoed by Draco’s low chuckle, seemed to set the kitchen alight. “You got it, Malfoy.”
Breathing out slowly, Draco felt some of the tension drop away from his shoulders and neck. He rummaged around the biscuit crumbs until he found a decently sized piece with plenty of chocolate and popped it into his mouth.
Draco’s hands were frantic, touching Harry everywhere he could reach. His mouth was hot and demanding, sucking on Harry’s bottom lip, pulling on it with his teeth. He was wild and desperate in a way he had never been with Harry before.
The silence stretched on, but Harry did not break it. Draco’s body was all taut lines, his eyes unfocused, emotion drifting across them like shadows. As Draco sifted through the past, gathering himself, clumps of grass began to spring up around them, blanketing the cliffside. Tiny flowers followed, bursting chaotically into bloom. The buds were a pale sky blue, just like the final light that had joined that haunting procession inside the house.
McGonagall adjusted her spectacles to peer down at the letter, reading it carefully. When she finished, she looked up at Harry with a frown. “Did you discuss this with Mr. Malfoy?”
Harry did not answer, but his jaw worked, as if he were chewing on a response. Not wanting to rush him, Draco averted his eyes and gazed out the open windows. The afternoon light was fading and the tree branches cast long, twining shadows over Harry’s garden. It was seeped of color, only a few wildflowers still catching the last rays of the sun. The effect was almost eerie, and it was hauntingly beautiful. Draco wondered what it would be like to hold Harry’s hand in that garden, to lose themselves in each other’s arms as the sunset painted over color with gradual darkness. Draco’s hands trembled, and he was relieved when Harry finally spoke.
By the time Draco’s fingers finally loosened on his wand, he was hard and aching. Dropping the wand, Draco yanked off his jumper and twined his arms around Harry’s neck. He sucked on Harry’s bottom lip, then began to kiss along his jaw. Harry growled, and the vibration traveled straight to Draco’s cock. He whimpered and began to rut against Harry, his fingers finding their way to Harry’s waistband.
“So you needed a dose of this – what was it again? – ‘energy and happiness’ potion too?” Harry asked, mouth quirking at the corner to soften the sarcasm.
Draco glanced up at Harry, soft and open and entirely vulnerable. Then he blinked away his daze and scowled. “Not like Weasley left you much choice,” he grumbled. “Always knew he was a busybody. The man’s got no class.”
“Is he?” Harry asked, taken aback by her calm certainty. He was strangely stirred by hearing Draco’s first name spoken aloud. Harry thought it sounded rather beautiful in Luna’s voice – it seemed to shimmer in the air between them, like music.
Harry wanted to stop, he tried to stop, he really did – but he just couldn’t. It was like trying to hold back the tide. His hand sped, and he shuddered and whined and fucked his fist until he came gasping Draco’s name.
“I didn’t though,” Harry corrected him gently. “It was just a good guess. Your spell was moving toward me, and the magic was constantly shifting. It felt like change, like Transfiguration. I got lucky.”
Draco pointed to a patch of flowers near the corner of the castle. Craning his neck uncomfortably, Harry saw a flash of gold almost hidden behind the dense clusters of pink and white blooms there. He squinted and the image resolved into a bushy blond ponytail.
Harry hesitated, but kept going, sensing that Draco needed this brutal honesty as much as Harry did himself. “It was like you were just another person forcing me into this box I’ve never fit in. And it hurt so much more coming from you, because you’re supposed to be the one who knows me.”
Later, Harry and Draco walked across the grounds hand in hand. The moon was low in the sky, a swollen orb just shy of fullness. The breeze rustled the branches above their heads. Harry let his magic spill from his fingers and entwine comfortingly with Draco’s.
Harry curled into Draco, resting his head on Draco’s chest as he explained. “The flowers were dropping petals on Luna, on all of them. It was like they were trying to get closer.” He paused, remembering how desperate the blooms had looked. Shivering as they strained toward the patients, unable to quiet their pain. “I’d never tried to manipulate residue before, but I thought maybe, if I could pull the flowers’ magic, bring it straight into Luna’s and the others’ cores, that it might help. I tied some of my magic to yours, to protect me, like in the Forest. And then I gathered what I could from the flowers and tried to hit the hooks with it.” He sighed ruefully. “It didn’t work. The hooks fell back for a minute, but then they ripped right through it.”
“I imagine I’ll see him quite soon,” Draco admitted. The repetitive motions of forming the biscuits helped to keep his breathing calm. “We’re having a bit of trouble, with some sort of bond or life-debt. We’re not quite sure what it is, actually, but it seems to be forcing us to apparate to each other’s sides whenever one of us needs something.”
“Oh hello,” Arthur added, turning to Draco and holding out a hand. “Draco, is it? Harry tells me you’re interested in Muggle science. Do you know anything about water pressure?”
“I guess I’ve just been thinking about some of the stuff you’ve said.” Harry started slowly, still adjusting to the idea that it was ok to share this part of him. “About the emptiness in my dreams, and not having anything to do with myself, and – and the guilt we talked about. I’ve been getting those letters since the end of the war, and I never really read them all that closely. The Auror department writes at least twice a month, but there’s other things too. The Unspeakables wanting to study me and newspapers begging for an interview and all these people wanting to use my name for profit.”
“Yup. Couple days after that chess game. Bit of a shock, really. I figured we’d just let it go, move on.”
Draco hurried toward Lavender, cursing himself for compromising her safety with this experiment. But before Draco could reach her, Lavender leapt to her feet with a loud whoop.
“Well, where has he been?” Maeve demanded, pausing to nod approvingly when Draco tasted a spoonful of dough and started muttering about a glaze. “You tell him I’ve got treacle tarts with his name on them.”
