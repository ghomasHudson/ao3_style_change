“Are you sure you’re not Hermione’s child?” Harry asked, smirking again. In response, his hair grew darker and curlier, sticking up in every which way. Harry snorted. “That’s more like it,”
Harry stood staring after Malfoy long after his silhouette had disappeared, wondering whether he would return after a walk or whether he had left for good. His nerves danced through his innards like a colony of ants as he began to pace again. The warming charm faded as he ran over the conversation repeatedly; His mind continually returning to a single phrase. No doubt a throwaway comment of no importance, but Harry couldn’t dismiss it. “You always did drive me crazy.” the statement brought a rush of warmth to his stomach and a wave of adrenaline through his veins.
Pulling out his wand, he levitated a satanic looking snowman and a moth-eaten stocking and sent them flying into the fire. Then, watching with a sense of satisfaction as they melted and bubbled, he deserved the resulting smoke and smell of burning plastic as he rushed, coughing and spluttering, to open every window he could find in an attempt the drive off the fumes.
“True. Old habits die hard,” Harry said, still chuckling as he stepped out from behind his counter and approached his son, studying him.
“Come on, Uncle! All I can hear is you huffing and grumbling next door to me. You never know, I might be able to help,”
“Really? Why didn’t I know that!” He didn’t expect any of them to answer; the question had been to himself. He felt shameful for not knowing, as much as he hadn’t liked the woman, she had saved his life, a debt which he had swiftly repaid by speaking up for her and Malfoy at the trials.
Draco could see them clearly now. It was as if their faces had featured in his nightmares. The first wore a dark and pointed hat which reminded him of Professor McGonagall. However, the hat was where the likeness ended. Makeup gathered in the lines and creases in her dry skin. Her dark eyes were narrowed, showing where her unsteady hands had quivered when she’d applied her mascara. The black lines smudged around her lids. A large blue ring sat on her finger, and large fake jewellery covered every joint visible.
The knot inside his gut had started to ease, fraction by fraction as the day wore on. His co-workers didn’t seem hugely interested in him despite the occasional glances thrown his way. He’d completed all the forms for W.R in record time and discovered the efficiency of the inter-departmental memo system as the forms folded themselves into paper aeroplanes and zoomed off out the door.
The kettle boiled, rousing him from his thoughts and back into the dreary Islington kitchen. He heard a bang and scuffle from upstairs and smiled. He’d almost forgot that it was the Christmas holidays at Hogwarts with everything that had been going on. Again, he smiled as he heard the heavy stomping that could only belong to a teenage boy.
“I will never live this down!” He muttered, loud enough for them all to hear before sitting straighter in his chair and looking at Harry. “I was only out of Durmstrang a year when my friends convinced me to join the annual broom race.” He paused as he rolled his eyes again and threw a knowing smile to Noomi. “My friends had convinced me that, should I win, I would be famous, and my future would be bright. I had very little money and no job so I decided to race. What choice did I have?” He asked with a shrug. Harry nodded in agreement. “So, I left Koppaberg and began flying, the first hour was alright, but after that, the cold became unbearable. I could bearly hold my broom, and a storm was rolling off the mountains.”
Draco’s eyes flew open as he sat upright, breathing hard. His heart thundered in his chest like a booming drum. He clutched at his skin as if trying to comfort it as he closed his eyes, willing the images away. It had been eighteen months since his encounter with the hybrid wyrm, yet he still woke up sweating and panting, fearing that he was still on fire. Usually, only Harry’s calming voice could coax him to bed every night, even knowing that the night terrors would return. He took a deep, shuddering breath as he pushed his hair away from his face. He sat still for a moment, waiting for his body to comply. It was then, and only then, he realised that he was alone in the cabin. His eyes darted around, looking for signs that Harry had been there, and it hadn’t just been a dream.
Draco sat, speechless in the suddenly quiet bed-chamber. His eyes couldn’t help gaze at the deep red garnet which shimmered with a wine-coloured fire. It was stunning. He pulled it out and, realising it was on a chain, undid the clasp. With shaking hands, he placed the pendant around his neck, feeling its comforting weight above his heart. The metal was surprisingly warm against his skin. He smiled as the sweet excitement rubbed against his insides. It was a superb gift. His attention returned to the now-closed snitch, the writing, now invisible once again. He pressed his back against the bed and took a deep breath. Harry had that effect on him.
“I can tell you that your bride will be absolutely stunning. That your first dance will bring tears to your eyes and that we’ll be leaving in style.”
“Silly boy!” The voice uttered again before a slap rocked his head back. The sound of it reverberated around the walls. “You are here because we want you here,” Harry could taste blood as his dry tongue probed the new wounds at his lip.
“What? Huh? For what?” he stuttered defensively. His eyes narrowed in confusion as his heart pounded in his chest. He was surprised that Malfoy couldn’t hear it. The blond laughed as he turned away, shaking his head.
“You are all going to be the end of me,” He groaned as he walked in, hearing the portrait close behind him.
“Mum will be pleased when I tell her,” Weasley replied, clearly not believing the reply. He opened his mouth but closed it again.
“Here and there, I’ve travelled quite a lot.” He looked down at his hands and seemed almost nervous.
“I’ll see what I can arrange.” He grinned again as he looked around the kitchen. “So, when you invited me round for tea, this was not the reception I had in mind.”
“Of course. It was a few years ago now.” Draco started as he pushed further into the office. His nerves were slowly calming. Whether it was the fresh cool air or the excited glean in his new boss’s eye. He smiled slightly at the apparent interest in what he had to say. It felt like a lifetime since he’d had a virtual stranger look at him like that.
“I imagine that you’re overwhelmed with plans for Christmas this year, but if you could spare us an hour… I know Luna thinks of you as a brother and would love to spend Christmas with family, especially as we lost her father last year.” His face fell at the memory of the loss.
“All in a day’s work, eh Potter? I can imagine you writing out your to-do list. Do laundry, get milk, save bully from… prison, make dinner,” He listed with a stutter and a shake of his head. He sounded angry now. “You don’t understand, do you?” Malfoy shouted. “No one else came forward to defend us! None of Mother’s society friends, nor any of my Father’s contacts at the ministry. The Malfoys were an embarrassment that they wanted to bury and forget like a dirty secret. You saved our lives, Potter!” He was shouting the last in exasperation now.
When, on Thursday, he saw three Ravenclaws, five Gryffindors and a Hufflepuff out of bed together, he groaned, and he placed his quill down. He picked up his wand and map and went off in search of the misfits. It was no surprise the map led him to a portrait of a bowl of fruit. He rolled his eyes as he tickled the pear. As the picture swung open, there were hushed whispers from within.
“Amazing, isn’t it?” Said Hermione bitterly, “That he can get a job after everything that has happened.”
“Don’t be so defensive. I’m not trying to trip you up.” Ron smirked, but Draco knew better. He knew that Weasley’s nice and friendly performance was just an act. The one-of-the-guys pretence had probably been used on many occasions to disarm people for information. He’d put money on it. “But you have to admit,” He continued, the façade slipping slightly. “It is slightly out of character, given your history, wouldn’t you say?” Draco considered him for a long moment whilst he considered his answer.
“You know, I’ve been told that I’m unforgettable. People are willing to wait for months to dine with me and have my undivided attention.” Draco snorted and rolled his eyes, his entire body burning from embarrassment. “And here you are, Slytherin Prince, forgetting that we had a brush date.”
“I knew a walk was what the healer ordered,” Draco replied as they walked between the other buildings. A few other people walked past, waving hello to them both as they busied along with their work. Draco instinctively thought of Charlie back in Romania and felt his heart twist slightly. He’d received a letter from Charlie just before he’d left for Sweden, begging for him to reconsider before they decided to tie the knot. The letter went into some detail which Draco closed his eyes to try and blot out. He blinked hard, trying to forget the letter, wishing he could burn it from his mind as he had burned it in their fire. Harry knew about the letter but not what it said. For that, Draco was relieved.
It is almost one in the afternoon, and they have questioned Scorpius, both Scott sisters, Albus, Miss Westen, and Mr Riley. And it seems that their stories have a lot of inconsistencies.
“Did you see Travers after the occurrence in the corridor between you, Albus, Travers and Riley?” Quinn asks, taking notes.
What he doesn’t expect, as he creeps a bit closer, is that his brother and his friend are in a middle of an argument.
Albus jerks his chin towards the group of teachers and students lingering at the doors leading to the Entrance Hall.
Quinn explains the process to James, Harry and Ginny, as well as Professor Fox. He asks Smith to administer the correct dose of Veritaserum into a small vial, and then asks James to come forth to drink it. He does, and Harry tries to swallow past the thick lump in his throat as he sees his son’s appearance change, from rigid and tense to sluggish and relaxed.
Albus quickly turns and sees Professor Fox, a tall man with wavy black hair and severe eyebrows – the Head of Gryffindor and their Defence professor – standing there, his hands clasped behind his back.
Harry turns to look at him, his mouth pulling into a smile on its own accord. “Harry.” he says meaningfully, knowing that after everything that has happened, the blonde wizard cannot be allowed to call him by anything else but his first name. His eyes move across Draco’s face, and all he can think of, is that everything between them is different. A good different. A brilliant different, even.
Every quill is scratching violently, as Harry continues speaking. “Which means, that the time of death, as well as the blow to the head had happened between six and six thirty pm, possibly only moments after Rose Granger-Weasley left her compartment.”
Harry assigns orders; Keir, Quinn, Fungbury and Ron will search the village and question its inhabitants, while Harry and Berrycloth will go to search the station and the train and to examine the crime scene. Everyone moves quickly towards their destinations, agreeing to report to Harry by the hour or if something comes up.
There is a long moment of silence, as Harry watches the people gathered in the hall, a sombre look on his face.
Albus’s focus falters as he notices that their classmates are about to join them and take their seats at the table. There's Cory; a black-haired boy with a long nose and toothy grin, who sits down on the seat next to Albus and gives him an upward nod. Cecil; a slender boy with sharp angles and long brown hair and Julian; who is a bit bulkier than Cecil take their seats across the table.
“She saw you?” Quinn asks, his voice tight, his expression quite uncomfortable, presumably having a good idea of what Travers saw.
Higgins, Bletchley, Walter and Parkinson give Harry reports about the wand-check process; nearly half of the students’ wands have already been inspected, but nothing alarming – and no Unlocking Spells – has come up yet.
Draco’s brows twitch slightly, as he wonders, with irritation, what the hell the blonde man is blushing about now, and how the hell would a
“Something’s not right,” Cory whispers, a deep frown between his brows. “They’re staying put,” he continues, still watching the group of teachers with the three students close to the Entrance Hall.
seen Travers and one of them is a friend of Travers’s boyfriend, it seems. The prefect in question had been with Travers’s boyfriend almost the entire hour before the train had reached Hogsmeade.
“What is the great mind thinking?” Moonstone asks quietly, standing up from his chair and flicking his wand at the teapot on a side table. “Tea?”
Here it is! The great reveal! Eeek! I'm so excited (also cracking up) and I can't WAIT to hear what you guys think of this! :D
” Harry mutters, and immediately, the stone wall opens up into a passage, revealing the large, underground room, resonating a greenish light both from the round lamps and the lake.
,” Harry warns, knowing there are still several pairs of ears listening their every word. He glances at Scorpius, who looks paler than usual. “Scorpius, are you okay?” Harry asks, watching him more closely.
The Ravenclaw tower is closest to the dungeons, at least with the shortcut Harry knows exists one floor up, behind the tapestry with the dancing monks. He walks in silence again, thinking of apparating to London and back to retrieve the Marauder’s Map, since it could provide the Aurors at school some help; they could monitor the students more easily with it, and see if someone moves in the castle at night.
Bones had been questioning the Gryffindor Prefects, and while several of them saw Travers in the company of either her friend Westen or her boyfriend Riley, it had been during the first hours of the ride. The Gryffindors had described Miss Travers quite differently than the students from both Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw house; that Miss Travers was a vain or conceited person, who didn’t really care if she hurt someone’s feelings.
Harry lets out an irritated grunt. “Yes, the Minister has sent his regards to me as well, urging us to solve this case…” Harry says, sounding as tired as the Headmistress.
Harry gives McGonagall and Neville a tight nod. “I’m meeting with the crime scene investigator shortly, and will report to you after I’ve searched and examined the train and the…the victim. I can give the parents a status report then, but we might not know much at that point. Anything else to add?” Harry asks from his former Head of House and classmate, forcing his voice to stay calm, even if his heart is thumping wildly. What exactly will he find in the train?
“Yeah, I know…” Harry mutters. “There will be others, questioned later today. But I have to say, Hermione,” Harry says, giving his friend a grim look, “It doesn’t look good. We’re not closer than we were two days ago.”
Potter gives him a narrow-eyed look over his shoulder. “I knew that.” He says with a hint of exasperation in his voice, and then looks back at the door. “Her spell felt weaker than mine.”
“Yeah. He is,” Scorpius says, and frowns slightly, before putting the book on the nightstand. “Tired,” He mutters, and pulls the covers over him before flicking his wand at the curtains.
? What the bloody hell is going on in here?” She nearly shrieks, and as Draco glances at the woman, he can see her face lined with tear tracks.
“…And, as I was returning back to my compartment, I saw her – Jenna,” Rose says, her voice calm, the words flowing out of her in a steady stream.
He then glances his notes again. “I also took a blood sample and analysed it; there was an unusually high dose of sedatives in the girl’s bloodstream,” Draco says, and looks at the others.
“What the fuck, Scor?” Albus asks, keeping his voice steady, but unable to suppress the glare in his eyes. His chest feels heavy, and he tries to ignore it. “What the
Neville gives him an understanding nod. “And I will stay here until Leonard returns,” he says kindly. “Do you know where his office is?”
Lily stifles a laugh next to Harry, who gives his daughter an inquisitive look. “Something to add?” He asks from her, but Lily merely shrugs back, walking away from Rose and Ron, leading Harry towards the Quidditch pitch.
Albus nods at his cousin, still in a foul mood, after his conversation with Scorpius before breakfast. “Rose.”
“…I can’t fucking believe this,” James rumbles under his breath, only moments after they have started their work in the small room next to the infirmary. “I could be at dinner – or – playing Quidditch – or – fuck – doing whatever the hell I
He tells them and the Headmistress, that Miss Travers’s death occurred before the train reached Hogsmeade. When he tells them the cause of death; a severe head injury caused by an impact to her head, the mother, Mrs Travers, bursts into tears.
“I want to know exactly what went through your heads when you organised a party at my house, and failed to ask permission for it,” is what he starts with, and Albus can almost hear the groan James must be doing inwardly.
He knows that Scorpius doesn’t get along with his father that well, and that his friend hasn’t really spent time with the man after his mother passed away a couple of years ago. It has always been either Albus staying with them, or Scorpius with the Potters. Mostly the latter way.
“Good evening,” McGonagall says to Harry, Moonstone, and the Aurors. She then turns to the man and woman. “This is Auror Potter, who will be leading the investigation,” McGonagall says, gesturing at Harry. “Auror Potter, meet Mr and Mrs Travers,” She continues, as they all stand up.
This manages to pull their classmates from the discussion, and then, all of them stare at the gathering.
Harry can’t stop wondering what is going on in James’s head, and why would his son risk everything he has worked for; a promising career in one of the Quidditch teams in the British league, as well as his future with Charlotte. He doesn’t blame James, for making a mistake – Merlin knows Harry has made them himself, even throughout his adulthood. He can only hope that James will not make decisions he’ll regret later in his life.
Potter lowers his hands back to the table, a small grimace on his lips. “Yeah, they should. We were supposed to tell them, during the holidays,” He says, pushing his glasses back to rest against his nose, his fingers and eyes back at the bottle again. “Work came before that, I suppose.”
“James told us about a party that took place in his home, to where Travers was invited by him,” Quinn says, glancing at his notes.
Harry is about to speak about his quarrel with Ginny, but then closes his mouth, opting to give Malfoy a nod instead. “I need to go soon. Quinn will question Rose in a moment, and then I have to discuss with Mr Riley’s, Miss Scotts’ and Miss Westen’s parents and ask them the very same thing I’m asking you now,” Harry says wearily, before giving Malfoy an intent look. “Will you give your permission to question your son under Veritaserum?”
“They’re not.” Harry says promptly. He gives her a meaningful look, before glancing at Ron and Rose. “Let’s get this over with, yeah?”
“Malfoy,” Weasley says blankly, turning slightly towards him, still keeping a tight grip on Potter’s other arm.
He nods at her. “Yes.” He says calmly, brushing away a few stray hairs from Lily’s face. He stays silent for a moment, thinking his words carefully. “Some things will change, but you will not lose either of us. You will still see us, whenever you like,” he says, giving her an assuring look.
The questioning finally ends, and James seems a bit bleary and confused, still evidently under the potion. They wait until they are sure he can leave the room, to retreat into his dormitory for a bit and skip his morning classes with his Head of House’s permission.
He takes off his glasses and rubs them on the fabric of his Auror robes, before placing them back on. He then glances at the timepiece on his wrist. Almost ten-thirty. He decides to question Riley and then leave Quinn to it, as he needs to still check the kids – Molly would murder him if he didn’t – and then make it to the Three Broomsticks before midnight to meet Drac…
Waves of pleasure float over him, overwhelming him, and Draco must’ve lost some time, as he suddenly realises that his hands are twined in Potter’s disorderly locks, tugging them lightly, guiding Potter’s lips to fit against his.
Harry pinches the bridge of his nose, feeling now more nervous of Albus’s questioning than he earlier had been. There’s of course Rose, who was probably the last one to see Travers alive, but…it couldn’t have been Rose. It couldn’t have been Albus, either, Harry reminds himself.
Rose frowns at him, shaking her head. “No. Jenna and Albus – they broke up a long time ago, and ignored each other afterwards. James shouldn’t have said those things to her.”
“One of the students had met Miss Travers in the corridor, less than an hour before her death. The student had described Miss Travers as ‘distressed’, as they were questioned under Veritaserum. Then, the same student had helped Miss Travers – had lent her a book to replace the one that had fallen under a prank of their schoolmates,” Harry says, and there’s a pause, as he thinks of his and Malfoy’s conversation in the compartment, “Then, fifteen minutes later – as the same student had stopped by at Miss Travers’s compartment with the book – they described Miss Travers to be quite a lot calmer and in perfect health, when leaving Miss Travers’s company and returning to their own compartment.”
The ward magic pressed against his skin, recognising him as master before the candles in the chandeliers erupted into life, washing the entrance hall in a warm yellow glow. There was nothing friendly or welcoming about the entrance hall. Still, Draco kept his eyes downcast as he followed his feet to the kitchen. He closed his eyes, navigating the way blind. He tried to silence his mind as it silently narrated his journey.
His stomach growled loudly, and he realised that he had skipped lunch again. Heaving himself up,  he left the smell of burning plastic behind him as he headed towards the kitchen. Muttering floated up the stairs as he ran down them, and he paused in the door as he watched the little elf moving around the room.
Draco nodded before reading the letter again. It made no sense to him, something about a magic charm and its dissolution upon his thirty-fifth birthday. No mention as to what the charm was for, nor was there any reference to when it was cast or by whom. Draco racked his brains but didn’t know what relevance it had. The letter ended with both his mother and father wishing him a very happy birthday, but most of the bottom had been blotted out by what looked to have been a spilt ink well. He placed the letter onto the desk and turned around to the house-elf who was looking at the snitch intently.
Harry felt panic rise within him at the pressure from all sides. He shook his head, and Hermione raised her hands in surrender.
“Have you had enough, dear?” she asked discreetly. Harry realised he’d forgotten his food, not that he had much of an appetite. He glanced around and noticed that everyone else was busy in their own conversations. Only Ron and Hermione watched on, the same worry bearly hidden on their faces. He smiled weakly as he turned back to Molly.
If there were two things he didn’t want on his first day, it was being on the receiving end of an angry wand or being reminded of his Skrewts lessons at school. He followed Rolf out into the main office, which had become somewhat fuller during their meeting. They wove their way through desks and chairs as Rolf pointed to a desk opposite the main office door. He was glad to note that he was also by one of the enchanted windows, uplifting his mood tenfold.
“I see you have received many gifts,” He said brightly pointing to the gifts and paper scattered over the floor. Draco followed his gaze and nodded, feeling very loved. His hand touched his chest and the pendant below.
“Maybe you should brush up on these hexes just in case you ever do feel like taking the defence job at Hogwarts,” Ron added with a smirk.
“it’s a funny story about how Patrik got here.” She chuckled. Harry raised his eyebrows as he looked to Patrik, who rolled his eyes with a smile.
“Draco,” He breathed, looking him up and down. “It’s been a long time…” He seemed to flounder as though he had so many things to say.
“I don’t know about the always.” She paused “But we have done for many years. There is an ancient building down the lake which my Mormor would tell was Viking. We used it as the hatching place for centuries until it couldn’t be maintained any longer.”
Draco smiled politely, hoping to avoid answering as he followed the darker man through the now-open office door.
“Whatever you need, Harry,” She replied, her voice almost lost in the din as he scrambled to the door.
Harry sighed, and even to his own ears, it sounded aggravated. He wasn’t sure whether he had just reached a grumpy age or whether his newly divorced status had brought around this particularly dark mood. He was convinced that the last time he had heard the Weird Sisters play, they had sounded better. Albeit, he hadn’t been in much better spirits at the Yule Ball in fourth year either.
"Tre e Viverna" is Italian for the "Three and Wyvern" which is in reference to the Golden Trio escaping Gringotts on the dragon.
“Where did you learn to cook, Harry?” It was Harry’s turn to blush slightly. He cleared his throat again before talking.
Fear and anger raged through him, his ears filling with a thick and deafening buzz, like millions of agitated hornets.
“It was brilliant.” Harry nodded, remembering the fireworks. That had been the highlight of his third year. “It doesn’t look like Filch is shifting. We’re going to have to be Slytherin about this.”
Blaise nodded in agreement. They sat quietly for a moment as Draco mulled this information over. One of the older ladies met his eyes before Draco turned swiftly back to look at Blaise. The younger couple had already left. The teenagers were placing their order with a grumpy looking grey Goblin who could barely see over the table, a wand perched behind his ear. Draco turned his attention back to Blaise.
”True, ” Weasley nodded with an answering smile as he straightened up. ”well, I’ve asked all the questions I need to, and I think I may have worn Malfoy out. So I’ll take my leave. If you remember anything else, drop me an owl.”
“You make it sound so trivial.” Draco looked almost forlorn now as he looked down at his hands. He was speechless for a moment as he processed it. Was he really thanking him? After all this time? It seemed preposterous. A Malfoy didn’t apologise or show gratitude for things. Not to Harry, and yet in this single conversation, he had done both.
“What did he do to her?” Molly asked only to be admonished by Arthur as he passed through to get his cup of tea.
He rubbed at his hair as he anticipated the reaction from Draco. His eyes would first find his face, then drop to his hips and waist, then to his backside and then up again. There was nothing more thrilling than watching the lust on Draco’s face as it subtly dusted his cheeks in a pale berry blush. He grinned to himself as he opened the door, grabbed his bag and descended the stairs.
It took less than a second for Draco to realise that he was no longer alone in the kitchen. He saw a shadow move to disrupt the morning light coming through the high windows. Ice flooded Draco’s veins as blind panic overloaded every nerve. He shot up and bolted for the door. Like a wild animal cornered, he ran sightlessly before he heard the crack of the curse. He had nearly made it to the door when his body stopped, arms snapping to his sides. He wobbled as his legs snapped together, and he waited for the impact on his face. Nothing happened. He opened his eyes and found himself floating above the ground, unable to move his eyes to look around. His heart continued to thunder in his chest as he fought to gain breath. He was back.
They waited as the lift doors opened before pushing through a small crowd gathering at the gates. Most eyes lingered on his white hair before glaring at him. Draco kept his eyes ahead, trying to ignore the feeling as they rounded a corner.
“I can already see your eyes rolling when you find that I haven’t addressed this letter, but truth be told, I didn’t know how to begin. Any title I could think of was either too insulting or too personal. As we’re not enemies anymore, I thought I’d play it safe.
Blaise rolled his eyes with a snort as Draco rooted through his bags for something to wear. He really needed to hang his clothes up soon before they became creased beyond repair. He finally decided on a pair of snug-fitting black muggle jeans and a black turtleneck. He’d discovered the joys of muggle shops on his travels and decided to try the jeans that everyone seemed to wear. He was converted and didn’t think robes would ever feel the same again. As he pulled on his fleece-lined leather jacket, he heard Blaise whistle.
“He didn’t kill anyone, Mione and anyway, he’s an ‘upstanding members of society’ now…” Harry repeated her words back to her, watching as her glare darkened. He sniggered before taking another sip of his whisky.
He looked at the familiar yet strange wand in his hand before meeting Harry’s eyes. They shared a look of understanding before holding it out to him. The former-Gryffindor nodded and took it, weighing it and held it up to his ear before disappearing into the back room with it.
He grinned at her before raising another spoon to his mouth. He chewed and swallowed before answering.
As you know I am rewriting this fic. Some parts and chapters may seem familiar, some will be completely different. Hopefully, you'll enjoy it as we go :)
“I have never been one of the best flyers, and so somewhere I got turned around, and then a bolt of lightning has the bristles of my broom on fire. I had to land. I had been in the air what felt like days but had only been around eight hours. I was tired, cold and wet. When I landed I collapsed, I was so tired!”
Draco nodded before a violent shiver shook him. Harry pulled his wand from the back pocket of his nearby discarded jeans and cast a warming charm on them both. “So, my question again. Are you hungry?” He asked with a chuckle as he nuzzled his face against Draco’s cheek, peppering kissed along the sharp jawline. Draco nodded again, still not ready to speak. Harry pushed himself up with a groan as he cleaned them up with a wave of his wand. They redressed as they stole glances at each other’s bare flesh, wondering when they would see them naked again. A few minutes later found them cuddled up in the blanket and cushions surveying the feast before them.
“Nothing. All the Ministers are apparating on Monday morning. This week, the ministers from China, Japan, North and South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, and Vietnam, Malaysia and Myanmar. I think Russia and Mongolia may also apparate in. We will have to wait and see.”
“I apologise. I know it’s nothing to do with the case. The thing is, Charlie usually owls every week; however, we’ve not heard anything in over three. So I just wanted to check that he was alright, y’know, for mum.”
“Don’t hurt your pretty little head about it,” Malfoy replied with a smile. “The Weasley-Grangers would never forgive me for breaking your brain.” He stood gracefully and dusted himself off. “Now, I shall take my leave before I could do anything else that they could blame me for.”
Draco sat up, avoiding Weasley’s stare as he cuddled his knees up to his chest. He knew it was a defensive gesture but didn’t care enough to hide it.
“He must do. He looked dejected when I mentioned her, now that I come to think about it,” Draco reasoned as he rubbed his face. His interaction with Harry now made so much more sense. His behaviour and reticence screaming that there was something wrong. He’d watched him for almost the entirety of the Weird Sisters gig and wondered why his face looked so stony and saturnine. Even his interaction with Hermione had seemed particularly despondent as he’d knocked back his whiskey then staring longingly at the glass for another. Draco knew the signs. He still saw them in himself from time to time.
“I’ll administer the counter curse, now if you’ll allow me?” Draco tried to follow, but the white pinpricks in his mind diverted his attention as they throbbed and pulsed. He felt the cool jet of magic like a jet of cool air which ruffled his hair. He waited, holding his breath as the pain in his temples slowly receded. He paused for a second before letting his muscles relax fraction by fraction. Finally, when he could breathe fully again, he attempted to open his eyes. He blinked at the dull room, trying to make sense of the world. Two figures crouched over him, their faces staring down intensely. He jumped and tried to crawl away. He didn’t want to be crucio’d again.
“A walk sounds wonderful.” She smiled and tried to lift herself off the chair but struggled. Draco helped her gently before taking her arm and leading her towards the door.
“I thought, as it’s only a week until Christmas; Why don’t you take your time and get to know your co-workers and sort out all the forms for Wizarding Resources etc. Then when you return in the new year, you can hit the case running.” He smiled. “I cannot stress enough the importance of those forms. Those at wizard resources can be blast-ended skrewts if you mess with their records!” Rolf chuckled at his joke, and Draco nodded and attempted a smile despite his unease.
He almost tripped when a youth appeared at the counter. He looked around to ensure Scorpius was still there as he felt like he had been transported back to Madam Malkins twenty-six years ago. The teen looked at him in curiosity as he grabbed something from the shelf. His dark hair sticking up at all angles. He let out a breath when he noticed that the boy’s eyes were brown.
“That surprises me. Of all the commendations, Ms Dalca’s is the most complimentary of both your work ethic and your methods. She speaks extremely highly of you.”
“True” Harry admitted, “Maybe I just want to treat you well and ruin you for all other men.” Harry continued.
“Ordo is very particular about who he hitch-hikes with.” Rolf nodded, a smug smile on his face. Draco nodded as he carefully scooped up the little creature and placed it back onto the over-flowing tree next to him. He noticed a few pairs of eyes watching him as he let the Bowtruckle step off his hand.
“The band was pretty good, and I have missed the food at Hogwarts. But it was a good night. I had fun.” He scratched his neck as he looked at the floor. “I was just thinking, actually, that it’s a shame that Harry isn’t working today. He could have returned your jacket.”
“Scandinavian too, eh? We’ll have to get you over for dinner sometime to tell us all about it; you can meet the twins too. You could bring a partner too if you wanted,” He mentioned
His shoulders relaxed, no longer crunching up to his neck defensively. He stretched it out, tilting his head from left to right, appreciating the provided relief.
“When you saw the flash, did you hear the witch utter any words?” Draco shook his head, only remembering Blaise’s voice.
They all stopped, and silence descended on them with just the thud of the music beyond their bubble.
“You think this is a lot; you should come for Christmas, we’ll treat you to a Julbord,” Patrik Smiled.
“Ginny Potter. Now she’s a flyer!” Blaise nodded wistfully. “Such passion and ferocity. Makes you wonder what she’s like in the bedroom. Well, maybe not you.” Blaise smirked again, and Draco couldn’t hide the small grimace that crossed his face.
“You’re welcome, Pumpkin!” Harry looked around the room, the flames licking at his throat. “Have you already opened my presents?”
“My apologies for shouting. I promised myself I wouldn’t. But I need you to understand just what you have done for myself and my family. You always did drive me crazy with how oblivious you can!” He shook his head again and laughed. “Thank you, though. Thank you for what you did. It’s not been easy for me to say this. Half of me hoped you would be here tonight to give me this opportunity. To say, thank you.” His eyes glistened in the darkness; snow had started to fall steadily around them in big fluffy flakes.
“I know that you and he never really got on well at school, and I’ve heard some of the stories. I thought it might make you mad.” Harry groaned inwardly, dreading what stories he’d heard.
“Here and there,” Draco smirked as he reached for a BLT kebab which consisted of a cherry tomato cut in half with Bacon and lettuce between like a tomato burger. The salty, sweet crunch in his mouth, reawakening his hunger.
“He’s a highly sought after Dragonologist, according to Rolf,” Said Luna, “The Ministry had no choice. They need his expertise with a new project.”
“Master will be most pleased. Must have forgotten. Yes,” Harry slowly pushed into the room to see Kreacher levitating decorations around the room. Harry smiled despite himself. So it was Kreacher who was the colour-blind elf. It all made sense.
Finally, the cold seeped from his bones, and a comforting wave of warm relief returned. His stomach still churned, but he thought that he was safe from being sick again. He gripped the work surface as he turned, his legs feeling like Gilderoy Lockhart had removed the bones. On a positive note, he thought, he could breathe again. So consumed with the need to be sick, his body had given up on his panic attack, focusing on the most pressing dilemma.
“He makes you very happy,” She said, not as a question. Draco nodded as a smile formed of its own accord on his lips.
Walking into the kitchen brought back memories, especially being so close to Christmas. He turned, expecting to see Sirius in the doorway. He frowned sadly when the door remained empty. He felt oddly bare as he turned back to the bare room. There hadn’t seemed to be a point of putting up any decorations this year, and there was a suspiciously large gap in the corner where they’d traditionally put the Christmas tree. He slumped down on a chair and folded his arms onto the table as he toyed with the idea of being lazy and getting Kreacher to make him a coffee. He shook his head, unable to bring himself to disturb the elf over such a small task. Finally, he pulled his wand out of his back pocket and with a swish, the kettle filled and settled itself on the stove, and the hob roared to life.
“Honestly, Uncle,” Teddy said earnestly as he stood up. “We just wanted some time together before I leave. We won't stay up late, I promise,”
“I’ll leave it up to you. However, remember what happened at the Unicorn a few years back. I refuse to be held responsible if we get thrown out again.” Draco held up a finger. “You have been warned.”
“That’s great, Nev! Tell her congratulations from us!” Hermione offered with slightly forced enthusiasm. It appeared that the Slytherin wasn’t yet a fan favourite with her either.
“Yeah, He’s been owling Nandi for years since Aunt Sis start started to visit,” Harry couldn’t help the snort that escaped him. The thought of the Malfoy matriarch answering to ‘Aunt Sis’ was too funny not to. However, his smile faltered as he remembered that she had passed and he hadn’t known.
“Come on, Draco, let’s go.” Draco nodded, opening his eyes in time to see Blaise throwing a few Galleons on the table. He wanted to argue, but the fight had left him. As he stood, he felt his legs turn to jelly. Blaise offered his arm as if knowing that walking was difficult. Draco took it as Blaise led him towards the door.
“That’s a shame.” Luna nodded, not noticing the glare Ron gave Hermione. “I really like Ginny’s stories. I wonder where Neville and Pansy are?” Luna asked herself as she looked into the crowd.
“Did you get your wand from here, Father?” Scorpius asked as he looked around the bright room. Draco smirked and shook his head. He remembered Ollivanders fondly, with all the dark wood and dusty shelves.
His racing heart pounded frantically in his chest as he tried to breath properly. Worryingly, the haze around his vision was becoming more solid. He knew he needed to breathe, but it’s like his lungs were frozen together, unable to expand. He gasped as he slid off the chair, hugging the seat cushion as he pressed his head into the warm material. He sobbed again and bit his fist, trying to quieten the ridiculous little hiccups that wracked his body. He sucked in the air hungrily as he pinched his eyes together to hold his mind together. Unsuccessfully. He didn’t usually cry anymore. Whether he was all cried out or whether he’d broken that part of himself too, he wasn’t sure.
Draco nodded but remained quiet, not exactly sure how to respond. Instead, he cast a surreptitious glance at the pair of them and wondered why they were acting so civil.
Harry smiled a genuine smile as he sat back. He loved this family so much. It suddenly dawned on him painfully that technically he was no longer a part of it. No longer being married to Ginny meant he was cast adrift again, not belonging to any family. A momentary feeling of desolate loneliness filled his lungs, and he found it hard to breathe.
“I wanted to. I wanted to remind you of what you were signing on for when we get married.” He smiled as he rested his head against Draco’s nuzzled at his neck.
There had been very few people invited to the wedding, and it coincided with the night he had discovered Ginny’s affair. Neither had been in the frame of mind to attend, nor had he seen the man since. He wondered whether Neville thought it was a reflection of his distaste for his new bride, and whilst Pansy Parkinson-now Longbottom was hardly his favourite person, he just hoped that he was happy after all.
“He’s definitely not; also he is very happily married to a lovely lady called Noomi and has a child on the way, I may be a lot of things, but a home-wrecker, I am not!”
The rest of the sentence went without saying. If Harry had stayed with the Auror office, then he would have known all of this information too. If he had remained with the Auror office, he probably would have learned a lot of things, but his stomach and heart spasmed at the thought of it.
He knocked the rest of the fire whiskey back, hoping it would either numb the guilt or awaken the pain he was waiting to feel. He had expected to be more broken up about it all, fifteen years was a long time to be with anyone, but he found that he was happy for her; Happy she had found someone to love her the way she deserved. Exultant that the responsibility did fall to him anymore.
“I know, Patrik” She smiled and rolled her eyes “There is only one Harry Potter that would be good enough for Draco!”
“No doubt.” He turned to leave when Harry said nothing more, their hands slipping reluctantly from each other. Harry watched him go as he walked across the snow-covered courtyard, his feet leaving a trail behind him. A rising desperation to call him back gripped him.
“Alone? Are you sure that’s wise?” Draco asked nervously. Never would they let people randomly walk around the reserve in Romania and certainly not at night. Patrik’s smile widened as he nodded.
“Thanks, Arthur. I’ll speak to Gin about it. I don’t want to do anything yet as she deserves a right to have her say too.”
“I don’t need you to throw my words back at me, Harry!” She chided as she straightened, her lips looking like she was chewing on a wasp. “He did some truly awful things. The only reason he hasn’t spent the last few years in Azkaban is because of you and your testimony.”
“Hurry up and drink it. I don’t feel I can, in all good conscience, tease you until you are back too almost your normal, snarky self.” Draco could hear the smirk in his voice as Blaise hitched himself up to sit on the counter. As he eyed the vial, the liquid was a murky grey that reminded him of dishwater – unlike all the other bright red Pepperup’s he had ever tried. They reminded him of Christmas decorations at Hogwarts.
“I miss you too! The conference should be over by this time next week, and then I’ll be home, and we can get married.” They both grinned.
The first platter was a platter of baby potatoes, but mixed in were bright yellow daylilies, carrots, and a green stalk-like vegetable which Harry suspected was samphire. He knew that samphire usually accompanied fish, so he wasn’t at all surprised when the following platter revealed pickled herring sprinkled with red onions and herbs.
Had Patrik set this up? Was it some elaborate joke? What was the surprise? As he approached, he saw the food and realised with a loud growl that he was starving. It had been a long and busy day with very few breaks. He looked out across the lake, the far bank just a black line in the shadow of the distant mountains the occasional burst of blue light as one of the dragons marked its territory. He sighed as he felt the wind blow his hair, wishing he was back at home with Harry. It had been two weeks with very little contact, only the occasional fire call. He hated to admit it, but it bothered him that this lack of physical contact could throw him so completely. He closed his eyes as he thought back to their fire call earlier, his fingers finding and playing with the pendant at his heart.
Draco realised that Rolf was darker than he’d imagined, his complexion close to the colour of milky coffee. With the last name of Scamander, he assumed that the grandson of the famous magizoologist would be as pale as the pictures of his ancestor. Rolf’s brown eyes looked him up and down as though Draco wasn’t what had been expected either. Still, he offered his hand with a genuine smile.
“It’s one of Luna’s little foibles. Wrackspurts are supposed to be invisible creatures that float into the ears make the person’s brain go fuzzy.”
Binky had been in the Malfoy’s care since before his father was born. She shakily handed over the letter which had nothing of the careful grace of his mother about it. The wax was splattered and dribbled across the parchment, and the seal was upside down. He prised it apart and tried to read the almost illegible cursive within. His eyes scanned it again and again as he tried to make sense of the words. He could tell that Binky had written it on behalf of his Mothers portrait.
Draco couldn’t talk, as the pleasure heightened. When Harry took hold of his cock and began to pump it, a burning, blinding white light blew up behind his eyelids, the coiling desire within him snapped and unfurled. He cried out, as his mind and body melted into oblivion. Sluggishly, his numb and boneless limbs returned as his mind focused. His spirit seemed to return to its body, leaving him gasping and shaking. Harry cried out above him before collapsing on top of him, moments later.
So there were no links that he could see between them and no signs of foul play either. However, the file was missing almost all the information he needed. Where had Orla gone to paint? Where had she last been seen? Her husband reported that she had apparated at lunchtime with her paints but didn’t return. However, unlike Weasley, the investigating Auror hadn’t thought to put any notes with their suppositions in the file. Draco closed his eyes as he tried to organise the information in his mind.
“Well, I’m sure you’ll find the evidence to prove that he did something,” Molly said with a determined nod before calling the children to attend. They all scrabbled for a plate, all except Harry, who stared at his hands as he thought about Draco lying hexed in a restaurant. A blind Draco. It chilled him enough he shivered.
“Can anyone see Peeves on here?”  Harry asked as he lay the map down. They crowded around to look at all the small dots.
“What? From his letters from home?” Draco nodded in response. “Yeah, he used to send photos home with his letters too, got a few good ones of you, Malfoy,” Weasley smirked, and Draco felt things starting to make more sense. Of course, that would be the reason Weasley thought he knew more about him. The thought certainly didn’t fill him with joy as he wondered just what information Charlie had divulged. Knowing the guileless Gryffindor, he’d revealed everything.
“Rose, you should know by now, your dad never wastes food,” Harry said to the eldest Granger-Weasley child.
“What are you up to, Malfoy? What do you want?” Harry managed to choke out as his eyes lingered on the smooth pale collar bone at his throat. He licked his lips slightly before looking down.
“What about your last whiskey, mate?” asked Ron. Harry smiled and knocked it back, feeling the burning sensation as the fire coated his insides satisfyingly.
“Don’t be like that, Professor,” Teddy smirked at the title. “We just wanted a small get together, as it’s my last year.”
The sky was beginning to lighten in the east when they decided that they had better make their way to bed. The moon, which had been peeking over the horizon when they’d started was high overhead as they stumbled back to Draco’s hut. They quietly giggled as Draco fumbled with the lock as Harry teased and tickled. As soon as they were through the door, they fought with their clothes before climbing into the bed. Draco pushed himself under the bedclothes first, holding them open for Harry who, after removing his glasses, climbed in. Within seconds of the covers covering them, their limbs entwined and their lips pressed against each other.
“Wasn’t that when you both had bad food poisoning?” Hermione asked, and he nodded, throwing her a swift but thankful smile.
“Are you alright?” Blaise asked, wisely, not touching him. Draco closed his eyes as he pressed his now free hands to his head. In the panic, he had managed to ignore the gnawing pain between his temples. He felt a blanket covering his body and realised distantly he was naked and shivering. It felt like an eternity for him to calm down as his stomach threatened to erupt.
“Bet the children and ridiculously clever,” Malfoy said. His brows furrowed. The Slytherin seemed to be giving out compliments freely. “Although, they’re probably still ginger.” Harry looked at the blond as he smirked. He tried to be offended on Ron’s behalf but found himself laughing too.
Draco wanted to know more, but unlike Harry, he kept his questions to himself, hopefully for another time. It was untoward to show too much interest in a person during the first meeting; at least, that was what Lucius Malfoy always told him.
Potter stared at the glass for so long, Draco almost lost his patience. Then Potter piped up, “If I drink this, do I have to brush my teeth again?”
"That's, uh, my first class too,” he stammered. Their height difference allowed Harry a direct view of his mouth, so now he couldn’t stop
Afterwards, Harry was lying on his bed, eyes closed and tossing a volleyball repeatedly toward the ceiling. It was a simple exercise of ball control, one he had been doing everyday. He got to one hundred tosses before a sharp rap on his bedroom door distracted him. He dropped the ball and yelped when it landed on his groin.
there wasn’t one. There was a window in the living room that allowed them a glimpse of their surroundings. Harry only saw trees and the clear blue sky, no signs of other houses or people within sight. He turned the window latch, expecting it to be locked. But the window opened without trouble, letting the cool evening breeze in.
Draco purses his lips and blows on the paper crane. Teddy gasps when the paper comes to life and starts flapping its wings. It leaves Draco’s hand and flies around Teddy’s head, much to the boy’s delight.
Preparing breakfast was a disaster. Harry's head was in the clouds, drunk on Draco; his concentration was all over the place. He could feel Draco's gaze following his every move, which both titillated and unnerved him.
"Will you stay the night?" Malfoy still avoids looking at Harry’s face. "My bed is big enough for both of us."
Draco’s eyes flash indignantly, but Harry caresses his cheek and hastily explains, “I know what you want and
At the finals of the University Basketball Spring Tournament, Draco won the MVP award. He hugged the trophy close to his chest throughout the entire closing ceremony. He only allowed Harry to pry it out of his hands before he got on Harry’s motorcycle because “I’m not having this thing dig into my back, Draco.”
Captain Malfoy asks his guards to wait outside before inviting Harry inside his private meeting room. There is a large oval table with steel chairs, but Captain Malfoy isn’t sitting. Instead, he stands by the windows, hands behind his back as he surveys the void outside.
So when Hermione barged into the Auror Office and hurried to his desk as though chased by lightning, screaming "Malfoy is in trouble!", what would you expect Harry to do?
The fan whipped around like a boomerang and back into Draco’s hand. Draco cleaned his weapon with his wand, deactivating the poison and blunting its paper edges, and then proceeded to languidly fan himself as he sauntered towards Harry.
Draco yanked his hand back, his body getting defensive and ready for the incoming ridicule. “Think my name’s funny, do you?”
“One of my officers, Granger, has gotten in touch with your First Commander,” Draco says, stepping aside to make way for other officers scurrying about. This brings their bodies closer together. “We have instructed him to initiate the anchoring sequence. Let’s watch from my cockpit.”
They wordlessly surveyed the entire house. The living room was basic: a fireplace, a three-seater couch, a coffee table, and a small side table. There was a large Turkish rug covering the entire floor. If Harry had to describe the colour scheme of the furniture, it would be "boring beige". In the hallway, there was a writing desk, a matching chair, and an empty bookshelf. As they walked further, they found a kitchen with a pantry modestly equipped with groceries and ingredients. There was also a small dining table
Malfoy lets go and wipes his face agitatedly. He is no longer touching Harry; his body immediately starts shivering. "I thought you liked me. Do you like me only when it's convenient?"
“Yes, I want this and so much more,” Harry said, feeling nervous yet hopeful. His worries evaporated when Draco smiled.
“Your farm?” Harry’s obvious incredulity makes Draco laugh, which in turn makes himself blush. Harry forcefully shakes his head – ‘
“Why do you have that?” Harry’s voice trembled with barely disguised fury as he kept his eyes on the orb.
Harry raked his fingers through his black hair, a weird expression fleeting across his face, as though he couldn’t believe his luck. “Come on. I’ll give you a ride home.”
Draco, who had been busy adjusting his hair, grudgingly looked up and stilled when his gaze landed on Harry.
Potter took Draco's hand and lightly pressed kisses onto his knuckles. "Maybe you should come with me."
“A phone call for you.” Neville jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. “Someone named Malfoy. Isn’t he on the basketball team with Ron? I think he—”
"He loves it when you're around," Potter remarked later after Kreacher disappeared. "So does the house, I think."
“Draco?" He opened his eyes to see Harry right in front of him, concern evident in his green eyes. "What’s wrong?”
But watching someone else, particularly Harry Potter, struggle with nightmares was terrible. He wanted to do something about it. He would do anything to relieve Potter of those nightmares. But only if Potter let him.
“If you don’t want me to carry you to the hospital wing, at least let me in,” Harry warns, trying to sound stern.
Working as an Auror for ten years has taught Harry some detective skills, so he can tell that Malfoy harbours
Suddenly, Harry feels self-conscious and hurriedly places his hand on Draco’s jaw when the other wizard tries to lurch forward. “Wait, wait,” he says urgently.
Madam Pomfrey looks up at Harry. Her eyes twitch and narrow as though trying to give him an admonishing glare, but her gaze softens when she observes the way Harry is holding Malfoy.
He was pushed into a metal chair, ropes winding around his body, while excited exclamations buzzed around him. They were beyond themselves after successfully kidnapping Harry Potter. Oh the ransom the Ministry would pay! The notoriety! The attention!
Albus turns to look at his brother in surprise, wondering, if Charlotte will keep the information to herself, wondering, if they’ll break up over it, wondering, why James had told her? Because – because of…Scorpius? He pushes those thoughts back into the far corner of his mind, and merely nods at his brother. “It’s the right thing, I suppose.”
Harry is aware that Moonstone only knows Harry’s history with Malfoy from their school years, and nothing else. But still, the look Moonstone gives Harry, makes him stumble in his steps. Makes his cheeks flame.
The Headmistress looks exasperated. “I’m sure all of you have already heard about it from your house Prefects or through the Hogwarts’s grapevine. I will make the official announcement during breakfast.”
“What do you think, boss?” Quinn asks, after they’ve questioned both Miss Westen and Mr Riley – for the second time.
, was saving his life during the final battle, perhaps even more times than the two Draco can remember.
Harry arches a brow at him. “Oh? How have I changed? And can I use your fireplace to floocall Hermione?”
There are some questions, some arguments that are discussed; if it was a suicide – to which Travers’s last spell nor the way she had died do not point; or if an outsider had gone to her right after the train had reached Hogsmeade – which would’ve been noticed by the train wards. Wards, that are put up by the Headmistress herself. Harry knows it
He gives Gryffindor to Bones, Slytherin to Smith, Ravenclaw to Keir and then heads towards the kitchens and the Hufflepuff common room with Quinn and Higgins.
Harry looked up from his lunch and blinked at the mirth in Draco’s grey eyes. “What were you doing?”
It takes just a second; Harry notes the exact moment Malfoy tastes it, when the blond moans almost in surprise and proceeds to suck on Harry’s bottom lip, on his tongue and pries Harry’s mouth open wider. Harry feels like he is being eaten alive, the way Malfoy swipes his mouth with his tongue, the way Malfoy grips his head, the way Malfoy’s arse slides against his thigh.
Draco reached the gym early and started getting ready way before the other students arrived. By the time the captain entered the changing rooms, Draco was already in his sports attire, standing in front of a mirror with fingers in his long hair.
Admittedly, Draco had been satisfied with their arrangement, even though he was unsure how to define their relationship. Maybe in a different universe, he wouldn't have had an issue with Potter's friends. But this
Harry paces for a minute inside Malfoy’s spacious bathroom, his bare feet slapping against the tiles as he thinks things through.
They moved on to work on their assignment. At the end of their discussion, Harry asked him, “How are you going home?”
Draco ordered for the both of them, assuring Harry that it was only natural, seeing as he was the only one of the duo with taste. Harry huffed but let him order what looked like half of the coffee shop’s stock.
Harry happily complied. The only thing he didn’t remove was the bandage around Draco’s eyes. Although Harry’s lies were fun during foreplay, Harry refrained from talking when they finally got down to business. He only allowed himself incoherent grunts and one-word curses as he moved above Draco’s body.
“Good game, Harry!” Granger said as Weasley started driving the car into the main road. “You must be exhausted. Why don’t you take a nap back there? You always do that after a morning game.”
Fair hair swayed gently as Draco quietly fanned himself. His movements slowed when he sensed Harry, disguised as a waiter, approach him with a glass of champagne balanced on a tray. With a small bow, Harry handed the glass to Draco, who accepted it (along with a tiny piece of folded paper, a secret message from the Head Auror) without looking at him.
Malfoy reaches for the cigar, but Harry pulls it away and jerks his own head forward instead, smirking and earning himself an eye-roll for his cheeky tactic. After removing Harry’s glasses, Malfoy holds his face and practically slams their lips together.
“Then they are exquisite. I am thoroughly impressed by your culinary skills, Potter,” Malfoy remarked with a flat tone, but a tiny smirk adorned his lips. “I implore that you continue cooking for me every day until we get out of here.”
Blaise held up both hands in surrender, smirking. “I’m hardly to blame, Draco. You would have noticed me sooner if you hadn’t been busy drooling over Potter.”
When the players started walking in, the first thing Draco noticed was Harry and his spectacles, which were unlike any Draco had seen him wear before. This pair resembled his motorcycle glasses in terms of shape and fit, but the lenses were transparent and there was a band that went around his head. His black hair was as tousled as ever. He wore a short-sleeved, maroon-and-gold jersey with matching shorts, which showed off a generous amount of muscular thighs and calves.
Professor Rufus Scrimgeour scowled distastefully at the vacant seats in the front row. Aside from Draco Malfoy, most of the students had chosen to sit behind the third row. Slamming his metre-long plastic ruler on his large desk, Professor Scrimgeour pulled out a piece of paper from his leather bag and made a big show of waving it around in the air.
When he snaps out of his reverie, Harry finds himself leaning forwards with his nose buried in Malfoy’s hair and his breaths ghosting over Malfoy’s warm nape. He jerks back with a sharp inhale.
At the top of the hill was a small hut, in which they took shelter from the harsh elements. Inside, Draco had arranged several flat stones to masquerade as a stool and a table. On the table sat an emerald green sphere the size of a Remembrall. A small key-shaped trinket suspended inside the misty orb. Numerous narrow cracks ran around the surface of the sphere.
To make matters worse, Draco — and every fibre of his body — wanted to leave a good impression on Harry’s friends and family. This was incredibly important to him. He judged that using whatever social tactics his father had taught would fail him since none of them advocated warmth and acceptance. His father was not a warm or accepting person.
It was Harry who withdrew to kiss Draco's jaw and whisper in his ear. “Draco, I'll stop if you tell me to." His voice was low, like a growl and it
The food did not turn out up to Harry's standards. Even though he had been making breakfast for days now, this morning felt different. He wanted this to be special.
“Will I get you to call me chocolate love or—?” Harry whispers cheekily but is interrupted by Draco’s laugh.
Draco doesn’t look up from the handheld device he is typing into. “What’s the weight and mass of your ship? Including your crew and weapons.”
Caught unawares, Harry didn't know what to do, so he did a small, shy wave. He almost slipped off the bench when Draco smiled.
Anger burned in the pit of Harry’s stomach, yearning to burst. Didn’t Draco have any idea how worried he made Harry?
The images sharpened and he forced himself to identify the faces. "It's the students from our year. The Gryffindors. Potter's roommates."
"I'm thinking about it," said Draco, who was already coming up with ideas. The difficult part was to convince Snape and his teammates to try them out without much practice beforehand.
Ron smirked. “It’s a different kind of ‘partner’ now, isn’t it?” When Harry gaped at him, he laughed and waved a hand dismissively. “Don’t worry. I won’t rat you out to Robards. He’s my boss, but you’re my best friend. I’m just glad you took our advice.”
Harry was annoyed. He hadn’t agreed to going home, but as he was about to protest, Ron shot him a warning glare to shut him up.
Harry didn’t manage to watch longer before he was being angrily honked at from behind. Hastily pulling down his visor, Harry released the brakes and continued his journey home while adding another mental note to the long list of things he wanted to learn about Draco Malfoy.
"You're extremely hot,” Harry whispers huskily. “You're always covered up. So whenever I catch you with your sleeves rolled up or your collar unbuttoned or when you're not wearing socks and I can see your ankles, you make me go dumb. And don’t get me started on your hair, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your arse. You drive me crazy, Draco. Every part of you. Every inch."
He swallowed the hopeful lump in his throat and looked at his soulmark. He traced the black lines with a finger, imagining it was Potter touching him instead. But that would never happen.
"Take the yellow potion every morning before 11 o'clock. It has antifungal properties. The pink potion is for local application only. Only use it if you develop pustules. Apply several drops directly on them and the pustules should disappear instantly without any scarring. Please make sure you and your partner do not miss the antifungal, even if you feel perfectly fine."
"I did. The nightmares were worse back then. The Mind Healers helped with most of them, except… except one thing. The nightmares I have now are mostly just about this one thing."
’ Captain, Lucius Malfoy, is far from a scientist. He is a veteran warrior, who stands as stiff as a pole and as unkindly as an affronted serpent. Even over the virtual comms, he has his chin lifted as he sneers at Harry with contempt.
“Fine,” Malfoy sighs jadedly, evidently lacking the energy to fight back. “Whatever you fancy, Potter.” He stretches his arms and gets to his feet.
“Oh thank Merlin, I thought you left,” Malfoy breathes as he turns, enveloping Harry in a bear hug. “I thought your silly brain misinterpreted my blatant and desperate need for your company and made you bugger off.”
When he opened his eyes again, he reached out and cupped Harry's cheeks. Draco turned Harry's head from side to side, studying the latter's face. "You're pretty handsome without those ugly glasses."
With a huff, Draco leaned back and resumed drinking his tea. He wondered, for the umpteenth time that day, whether he should address Potter's nightmares. It was a sensitive topic, one Draco knew all too well, having been haunted by them during the war and after.
He understood what it felt to lose control of his mind. He knew how scary it was. Malfoy was afraid of how this infection would affect him. Healer Kim had said that they were healthy, but she had also warned that this could change anytime. They were supposed to monitor each other for symptoms and remind each other to take potions.
Together, they touched the Portkey and were transported into a living room. The first thing Harry did was look for a front door
Over the next few months, they slowly opened up to their close circle of friends and families about their relationship. They had discussed it, and even though Harry could see it frightened Draco to death, they promised to go through with it. Harry’s family
Despite being three storeys up, the room is dark and dingy. Only one light bulb functions, but it flickers off and on every few minutes. The neon signs across the street are more reliable and constant sources of light. Harry sits at the desk by the window, wearing nothing but a pair of low-riding joggers, and leans back against the chair as he draws on a lit cigar.
Draco was glad to finally see familiar faces, though he pretended to be disinterested as they approached.
When Harry first closed the distance between their lips, conflict erupted within Draco. Half of him was beyond himself with questions
Draco twirled back around to face his cauldron. "Your ghastly Auror robes will scare my patrons away."
When there were only three minutes on the clock, Davies jogged next to Draco and said with a smirk, “Hey, Malfoy. Time to show off.”
Draco worked as a Potion Master at St Mungo’s, so this apothecary was more his scene, rather than Harry’s. He was merely tagging along on this shopping trip because he had been busy running his orphanage lately and they hadn’t gone out together since their wedding three months prior. Draco had appeared reluctant at first, but eventually agreed to let Harry follow him.
Several days later, Teddy is playing with the dragon again, but this time he’s in his own bedroom. He looks up to see Uncle Harry standing by the door with a nervous smile on his face.
“Yes!” Draco exclaims, sending frantic signals to Zabini while his free hand inputs commands onto his panel. “Thirty seconds to Black Alert.”
Harry wondered what their lives would have been like had he taken Malfoy’s hand. He guessed that it wouldn’t have felt as solid and calloused as it had at the reunion. Instead, the skin would have been the soft, supple skin of a child who had never known work. It would have been quite unlike his own. Even at eleven, his hands had been dry and cracked, calloused and sore from the Dursley’s constant chores. He was almost embarrassed to think of what Malfoy would have thought had they shook hands, seeing the state of his own.
Dudley had children of his own now. Olivia, ten and Michael, six. He wrote regularly and sent letters, the muggle way, of course, keeping details of the magical world secret as much as he could. But, as far as he could tell, he was passed off as the eccentric uncle who travelled around a lot. He could live with the lie despite it being the polar opposite of his life. He yawned but stopped abruptly as he realised something.
His body spasmed again as the frozen air suddenly gusted across his shoulders. He sped up the path, huddling in upon himself to shelter from the cold. He barely spared a glance for the dead plants and decaying outbuildings he knew to be there. He grimaced in shame as he briefly remembered all the summers where the place had been green and lively, the air buzzing with pollinators, the flowers enticed them onward. White peacocks had once roamed the grounds, their splayed feathers looking like a blinding starburst, but that was before...
Harry stared down at the blank piece of paper, his foot tapping against his chair as he racked his brains for inspiration. He glanced at the fire and rolled his eyes at the several screwed up piece of parchment sitting ready to burn. Why was this so difficult? He shook his head in despair. He knew the exact reason why. It was because he actually cared about what the blond git would think. He would notice if the punctuation were incorrect or mock the scruffy handwriting. Draco Malfoy would notice nothing, however, if he couldn’t get past writing his bloody name. Just ‘Malfoy’ alone sounded rude and blunt, whereas ‘Mr Malfoy’ sounded too formal and just wrong. And there was no way that he could start the letter ‘Draco’ as it was far too personal and intimate for this stage in their current tentative friendship.
Harry sat on the edge of his desk and smiled as he looked around the class.  These were like the old days of Dumbledore’s Army. Watching the children reminded him why he’d thought about becoming a teacher. The first years were split into pairs around the room, practising their knockback charms — pillows scattered around the room to prevent injury. Harry rubbed his chest in memory; it was an unpleasant feeling to be pushed away by magic, like a punch in the chest.
What did a bunch of Gryffindor’s even do at parties? He couldn’t imagine the Weasleys holding cocktail parties and eating hors d’oeuvres. But, of course, that’s very much what his own parents would have done at New Year. The fire would be roaring, and the Christmas decorations would be placed tastefully around the manor. The pièce de résistance would be the enormous tree in the hall, twinkling with fairy’s and filled at the base with shiny packages and hand-wrapped gifts.
He sighed, glancing out of the window at the London weather, watching as the rain bounced off the patio slabs. He shook his head and removed his glasses, rubbing his eyes firmly until white dots appeared behind his eyelids. Why was a white piece of parchment so intimidating?
He could admit to himself that it did seem out of character for anyone looking in. It was the nicest thing he’d done directly to Harry, but despite it all, he still felt the annoyance prick him.
“Come on you, get dressed, and I’ll let you buy me lunch. And once sated, we can discuss all the other reasons that someone would have to cheat on ‘Dearest Harry’.”
“I can’t believe that a pureblood like Malfoy would deign even to speak to a blood traitor like your brother!”
Harry felt his eyebrows raise high enough to touch his hairline. The thought that Charlie and Malfoy could be friends seemed so very unlikely.
Draco frowned. That voice… he felt the nerves build up in his stomach as he waited for the owner to appear. He had spent nineteen years trying to forget that voice-- The way it made him feel. He had hoped that by isolating himself with Astoria and Scorpius, he could forget the thoughts that had hounded him most of his school life. It had almost worked too. It had been so long since he had dreamt of bottle-green eyes staring into his own, burning in their intensity.
“He isn’t needed to do any work today, is he? If not, I don’t mind stepping in to help.” Surprise passed over the hosts face briefly before being replaced by a wide smile.
“I asked about Weasley and Granger, and he asked about my wife,” Draco aimed a loaded stare at Blaise, who laughed. Draco paused as his mind recalled everything from the night before. “Do you think it was strange that the Weaslette wasn’t there?”
“As concise as ever, Potter.” Draco turned to look at him as if looking for deception; he’d seen other former Slytherin’s do this too. Like watching a chess player evaluating their options looking for a trap. “You genuinely don’t remember, do you? I guess after saving the wizarding world, all the individuals merely blur together.”
As they got closer, it was as if the bubble that Ron had cast around them absorbed Luna and Hermione.
The wall of sound hit him as soon as the door opened, and it was clear that the band was back in full swing. He found Ron had long returned with the drinks, but Hermione was absent. Ron smiled kindly at him as he sat down.
“You are not supposed to. I don’t need you to understand.” Harry felt the panic bubbling away beneath his controlled surface.
He couldn’t help feeling an overwhelming wave of unease as he stared hard at the fireplace; His nerves squirming like worms in his gut. He tapped his pocket and felt reassured by the glass vial that lay there as a safety net. If it all got too much for him, he’d be able to remain calm and hopefully fight off any panic attacks before they got out of hand.
“I suggested that as I’m only back in Britain for the weekend, we should get together. Your exact response was, and I quote. Yeah, definitely. You should come around for tea.”
He sat down on the bed he’d yet transfigured back to an apple and looked at his clothes cluttering the kitchen walls. He had draped or hung his many suits from every available surface and spelt them to erase the creases, ready to wear at a moments notice. Living in Romania’s wilderness had restricted his need for tailormade refinery; however, he still appreciated how the clothes could create a first impression which words found wanting, like a secret, non-verbal language, spoke subtly to the eyes.
“Of course, I will.” Harry smiled as he kissed Draco’s hand. “Break a leg with your conferences this week.”
“My name’s Scorpius, Mr Potter. It’s very nice to meet you,” His son said as he stepped forward to offer his hand. Draco watched the tanned face and sharp eyes take in his son, confusion waring with surprise on his dark features.
Harry nodded as he watched them all engaging with each other. It was almost like being a kid again as he heard who fancied who and what homework they still had left to do. Victoire and Teddy only had eyes for each other at the end of the table. Dominique and Molly were chatting about one of the fifth year boys they both liked, while Fred, Rose, Roxanne, Louis, and Lucy were all playing exploding snap. He smiled and answered the odd question before standing.
“No, Madam, How dare you? Were you present at the trials of my friend here?” The hatted witch didn’t answer as she looked at Blaise as if he had grown a second head. “No? So you wouldn’t have heard the testimony which acquitted him? That’s interesting, so you probably didn’t know that Harry Potter was only able to defeat the dark lord because my good friend here threw him his wand.” The two witches looked appalled at this obvious lie. Why would a death eater aid Harry Potter? “That was fifteen years ago, Ladies. How dare you assume you know all the facts about him,” Blaise explained firmly, his lips forming a tight line.
“Nothing, just getting some fresh air, just like you,” Harry narrowed his eyes suspiciously but sat back down. He stared into the distance, hoping that his senses would forget he was there. After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence, he realised that even his nerves seemed to vibrate in such proximity to Malfoy, like iron filings to a magnet.
“Well, he used to. I think she was the closest thing to a mother he had after Aunt Sis died. I think he still owls her once a week, but he owls me too now, sends me postcards from his travels. I’ve got a scrapbook full of them upstairs.”
Draco nodded and started to explain the series of events up until the hex hit him. Blaise took over from there, and Draco listened on intently as the other events became apparent.
He cut that train of thought off. It was no good to dwell on things like that; it would only make him feel more lonely and pathetic.
“No, thank you. You have been a tremendous help today!” Said Patrik as he moved around the kitchen. Platters and plates started to flow through the air, setting themselves down on the table before them. Harry’s mouth watered as each platter revealed a new and exciting dish.
“He’s right, Harry. Who better to teach children about the dark arts than THE Harry Potter?” Hermione added.
“So loyal to the ones you love, that surprises me, Mr Potter, with an upbringing like yours. It would be so easy to leave people by the wayside.” The footsteps sloshed. “But no matter, he is… nearby, after a fashion.”
“Any objections to a heating charm?” Malfoy asked lightly, drawing his gaze. The blond sat there with his wand out, pointed to the sky. Harry looked between him and his wand before he shook his head.
He wondered where he could go with this lead. Maybe retracing the hiker’s steps, but that seemed like a fool’s errand. No, he needed to speak to the widower and family. See whether they could guess where she may have been painting. He opened his eyes as he reached for his quill but was distracted by someone standing in front of his desk.
Momentarily arguing with himself, he signed. He resigned himself to breaking whatever etiquette there was in sending another letter so soon after the first. He accio’d his inkwell and quill and waited for inspiration to hit. It didn’t take as long as before for words to flow as his quill sped across the page.
About five years into their marriage and what felt like years of trying, They visited St Mungo’s to discuss their difficulties conceiving. Ginny worried about her budding career, but she wanted children so much that they looked into their problems. They were almost entirely taking care of Teddy, so felt prepared for a new arrival.
As it turned out, ‘Tre e Viverna’ was a charming, family-run, Italian place- even if the owners were goblins. Since the fall of the Dark Lord, the force that was Hermione now-Granger-Weasley had ensured that equal rights had infiltrated every level of the wizarding world. As a result, non-humans could now purchase, own, and use wands, much to the Goblin community’s delight. Fortunately, it also meant that blood status was meaningless, and both positive and negative discrimination was illegal.
“That is hardly the point.” Blaise laughed first, followed by Draco shortly after. Draco took a sip of his wine, placing the glass back down, before opening his mouth to say something else.
“And you wouldn’t have me any other way,” Harry whispered as he leaned in for a kiss. Their lips met softly as Draco’s arms dropped from his chest, one hand winding his fingers into Harry’s damp, unruly hair, the other stroking the soft, dark hair at his jaw. Harry’s hands found their way to his back, where he pulled the other man close.
The other presents were from other people. The first he opened was a new, dragon-themed chessboard from Ron and Hermione. He smiled with glee, looking forward to beating Ron the next chance they had. He shook his head at the thought of looking forward to seeing Weasel. A pair of Dragonhide gloves from Luna and Rolf. A new quill and parchment set from Cosima and Torren. A hand-knitted scarf and homemade fudge brownies from Molly & Arthur.
“Both accommodating and good looking?” Harry raised an eyebrow “Sounds like he’s exactly your type.” They both smirked as they played along.
He shook himself as the clock chimed quarter past before rooting through his things to get ready. He could not be late on his first day.
Zabini said something else, the cut of his light suit hugging his body as he posed against the wall. In response, Malfoy bent over double, laughing. Harry could almost hear the sound beyond the chatter and clatter of people around them. He didn’t think he had ever seen Draco laugh like that as if he didn’t have a care in the world. Maybe he doesn’t anymore, Harry thought bitterly, thinking about everything going wrong in his own life. Blaise looked up, and their eyes met. A rush ran down his spine as if doused in cold water. Zabini’s smooth, dark face sobered up as his mouth moved. It was Malfoy’s turn to react. Harry watched as his muscles tensed and his lips thinned before he tugged and arranged his waistcoat.
“I know, right? But Charlie said he’s really changed. Me, George and Bill think that they were more than friends, if you know what I mean?” Ron winked before offering a knowing look to Harry.
“See? That’s better. Just think of all the things I do to annoy you, and these next couple of weeks will fly by.” Harry chuckled as he kissed him again before going to stand. “Come on; my Portkey is about to activate.”
“Alright.” He agreed, smirking at the broad grin spreading across his face. “So, what else do you have to study before you go back to school? Three weeks off really isn’t enough, is it?” Harry replied sarcastically with a roll of his eyes.
“As you wish, Just Malfoy, You can call me Just Weasel if it’ll make you feel better?” Weasley smirked, and Draco couldn’t help himself.
“Sorry, ‘Mione, I need some air. I’ll be back in a minute.” He said with an apologetic smile as he stood up.
“Thanks,” Harry replied as he felt the warmth rush through him as though submerged in warm water, his sore jaw loosening as the subtle shivering stopped. He looked at Malfoy, assessing him. He noticed the paleness of him even against the stony backdrop. He had grown into his points and angles and had gained confidence he hadn’t had when they were children. A prick of sadness spoked at him, knowing that it was too good to be true. “So, where is Mrs Malfoy?” He asked, looking down at his shoes.
He frowned at the moving photo of the family looking back at him. The children were playfully poking and pushing each other as the witch, and her spouse smiled tiredly behind them. Draco tried to read into the body language but could see nothing to suggest an unhappy home. He sighed and frowned harder before pushing the file to one side. He scribbled a few more notes down before tapping the feather against his lip.
Grabbing his books, he climbed the stairs to his office where Kreacher had left his lunch today. He smiled in appreciation, Kreacher somehow knew that this time of year was the busiest for marking and coursework.  He took a greedy bite of the ham sandwich before he grabbed his pile of essays from his sixth-year class. It was at times like this he was happy that the number of students reduced in sixth-year. He’d already marked four of the six essays, only two more to do.
“And the rest!” Ron chuckled before taking another sip of his mead. He waggled his eyebrows so that Harry was in no doubt as to what he meant. “But whatever you do, don’t talk about it in front of Mum,”
“No, I meant your wife. I would have thought you’d be married by now,” Malfoy chuckled to himself as if laughing at an in-joke.”What’s so funny? I would have thought you’d be raising a whole manor full of purebloods by now,” Harry said with a smirk.
Draco sat on the bed for a moment as he remembered that snippet of his life. If he lost all of the memories of his life since Hogwarts, if he could keep that one, he would die happy. Then, after realising that he was sat there, staring far into space, he stood and forced himself to put on his shoes. He ran a comb through his hair, relieved that he could just pull it back into a ponytail, something he should have done years ago.
“Why give me your jacket?” He asked as he started to pull it off before deciding to keep it. The lining was very cosy. He got a whiff of Malfoy’s cologne and felt his heart stop for a moment. He took a deep breath before he knew what he was doing. His eyes darted up to the other man, who was watching him intently.
Harry nodded. He could see why Draco was so interested in the reserves, besides the dragons of course. There was so much history to glean from small intimate exchanges such as these.
Whilst on his travels, he had discovered the joy that was the muggle shopping centre or mall as the Americans called them. This discovery had opened up a previously unknown area of style to him. He had only ever seen some of the muggle-borns in the other houses wearing jeans, but now he had tried them, he could see the appeal. He’d had to reign in his spending, only purchasing a couple of practical items and exercising every ounce of self-control he could muster.
“Good Morning,” She smiled, her dark brown eyes twinkled as she levitated a bowl down on the table and motioned for him to sit.
“Happy Birthday” Harry muttered as Draco yawned, pulling him closer as he hoped every birthday from now on would be like this.
“Indeed, it is.” Blaise agreed, holding up his own glass of wine. “Here’s to new beginnings and new experiences.” He offered his glass, and Draco gently met it with his own with a small clink. They smiled as they sipped the contents.
“I just find it awkward to say when I still don’t believe it myself.” Noomi nodded, her black dreads bouncing in agreement.
He heard the owl warble again before hopping down to him, his flat saucer-like face tilting to give him a questioning glance.
“Sounds wonderful” Draco replied as he gazed hungrily at the food. “What are you trying to do? Fatten me up?”
“Fascinating.” Rolf breathed as he gazed back at the picture. “I believe this skill will be invaluable to you in your new role.”
”Good morning. Bet you thought that was hilarious!” Draco grumbled as he reluctantly admired the markings, stroking the soft feathers at its head. It was a handsome owl, to be sure. However, the closer he got, the more scars and old wounds he could see on the bird. Finally, the creature preened under the attention, chirping in delight before offering his leg. Draco took the letter gingerly before stepping back. “I hope you’re a good-news owl. I could do with some kind words today, ” the bird chirruped again, making Draco smile at the friendly bird. He turned to grab some owl snacks scattering them on the side and watching as the owl nibbled happily away.
“Seriously, though.” Harry asked his face sobering “You don’t want to wait and have a bigger wedding next year?”
His right arm was suddenly yanked from under him, making him hit the floor once more, wrenching it at an agonising angle as the chains pinched onto his skin. It’s cold metal, leeching the dwindling heat from his already frozen hand. The other arm shot off in the opposite direction, dragging him to his knees. He kneeled, his jeans drawing the icy water up higher and higher as his shoulders screamed.
“What do you want, Malfoy? I’m sure you didn’t just come out here to have a nice little chat with me,” Harry turned, his brow furrowed with confusion. He bit the inside of his lip as he thought how nice it could be if he were.
“What are you doing?” Harry found himself asking. He felt the smile fall from his face and wished he could take the words back. He watched as the other man’s smirk also faded back into his mask of vague indifference.
As he twisted around, Blaise’s flawless ebony skin came into view. Draco honestly thought that if he hadn’t been hexed with the body bind curse, he would have collapsed. He felt tears prickling, unable to blink to keep them back. He watched helplessly as Blaise levitated him to the bed and lowered him down gently. He felt the invisible bindings loosen as his chest was given full movement to pant.
“Mrs Malfoy? Who? My Mother?” Malfoy asked, surprise and confusion waring on his normally blank face.
“Just ignore them, Draco,” Blaise said, covering his hand with his own. Draco nodded slowly as he tried to regain control of his heart, which threatened to burst through his chest.
He heard the ancient grandfather clock in the drawing-room strike, and his blood ran cold. He was running late. He looked at the parchment and owl and shook his head.
Draco nodded as he looked around the office.  The room could only just accommodate the furniture, the centrepiece being a giant walnut desk. Around the edges of the room, filing cabinets showcased an array of plants and other greenery, making the air in the room smell fresh and sweet. “Good, good.” He beamed as he turned, perching on the edge of the thick desk. His dark eyes looking up at him.
“Not married yet, I managed to escape the skulduggery of an arranged marriage,” Malfoy sighed. “And I hear that thanks to Minister Shaklebolt and Granger, Blood purity isn’t all that important any more.”
Anyway. We’re having a few people over on New Year’s Eve and wondered whether you would like to join us. Christmas is about family, after all. So it would mean a lot to Ted if you came, even if only for a little while.
“Wow, Potter. Your vocabulary astounds and wounds me in equal measure.” Malfoy replied, a small smirk playing on his lips. “Nice to know that some things haven’t changed from school.”
He wanted it gone so that he wouldn’t have to admit to himself the thoughts in his head. He had been more than happy living in the figurative closet, and every time he looked at the green blazer, the door to that closet opened up a little more. He was lying to himself, knew it down to the marrow in his bones just as he had always suspected. If he stopped and let himself think and feel, the sudden lack of momentum would shatter the world around him.
Draco stood and rubbed his chin as his mind raced. He couldn’t for the life of him, think why there would be a charm which dissolved at thirty-five. Thirty-five was a rather random number. He shrugged and resolved to speak to Harry about it later and also to his mother upon his return home.
“What?” Draco snapped harshly. He regretted it instantly and tried to soften his tone. “What were you going to say?”
“I don’t know; I guess I had better return it. It looks expensive,” Harry shrugged. “What department did Luna say he was joining?”
He looked up as he waited for Hermione to tell him that he was a freak, but she didn’t say a word. Her eyes gleamed more as he saw the tears gather, but she remained silent. “Since she joined the team, I’ve barely seen her. We don’t talk any more. I don’t love her anymore, and I’m wondering whether I ever truly did,” He ran his fingers through his hair to hide the tremor as he sat back “things just aren’t as simple as they were in school” He shook his head sending his unruly, salt and pepper hair even more askew. He glanced around the room, looking for Ron as he twirled the cool tumbler in his hands, listening to the remainder of the ice clink against the glass walls. He desperately needed another drink.
“Salazar! I am remiss in my duty to keep you grounded, Potter. Let me make amends. You really must do something about that bird’s nest; I can’t believe your wife let you leave the house like that.” Malfoy snorted.
Draco lifted the lid and found a small pile of presents inside, he tipped the box over and gently poured out the contents. After digging through, he found one that wasn’t much bigger than the original box had been. He looked at Harry, who nodded.
“Revelio,” he said as he waved his wand over the jacket. When nothing happened, they all let out a sigh of relief.
“No one at the moment. I can’t even get past the greeting,” Harry chuckled as he tried to get over his embarrassment.
“I need you,” Harry desperately muttered, as he withdrew his fingers. Draco whimpered as the boy-who-lived positioned himself before sliding home. Hot and slick, he was suddenly full to bursting as Harry pulled on his shoulders, burying himself to the hilt. Draco cried out; his mind overwhelmed with every touch and caress.
Draco halted here, only momentarily, as though his feet had gotten confused between destinations. He resumed his stride towards the kitchen, leaving the drawing-room and the horrors behind.
Neville’s smile brightened as he looked around the room, trying to locate his bride. “Erm, last I saw her, she was with Blaise and Theo. Did you hear? Professor Corning retired last year, and Pansy got his job. She’ll be the new Alchemy professor?” He grinned proudly, and Harry knew immediately that even if it was an arranged marriage, to begin with, it had resulted in a love match, certainly on Neville’s part anyway.
They stayed like that a few moments as he watched Malfoy’s Adam’s apple bob as the taller man swallowed. The Slytherin’s eyes glanced up to his, and Harry watched as he carefully built up his mask again as he smirked.
He crashed face-first on the bed, relieved that his retinas could rest in the darkness. He lay for a moment, feeling his hot breath warm the covers around his face as he pressed it deeper. He considered removing them with his wand but knew that Kreacher’s feelings would be hurt. He didn’t think he could deal with a moping house-elf.
“We’ll have to get together sometime. If you’re coming to the Ministry, we could all get lunch?” Said Hermione, hopefully. “Ron and I are on the Second floor” She smiled as she looked at her still-chuckling husband. Harry shook his head.
“I’m sure he did something to that poor witch. He is a Slytherin, after all. Just cause you didn’t see it in their memories doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. Remember the poor Bell girl?”
Neither Hermione nor Ron had seen Malfoy at the Ministry during the Wizengamot trials, choosing to stay away. Harry shuddered as he remembered Malfoy’s state when he was carted in before the Wizengamot. Harry had completely blotted the thoughts from his mind, but speaking to Malfoy had brought them all to the fore. He shuddered at the memory of Malfoy’s haunted eyes and broken body, so at odds with the healthy and strong man Harry had seen tonight.
The mediwitch stood and looked at him for a moment before resheathing her wand for a second time. She narrowed her eyes at him as if trying to figure something out.
“Go on, go to lunch. I’ll see you all later.” They waved as they left the classroom, leaving him on his own.
“Noomi should be through here,” he motioned as he walked off through a far door. Harry followed after him, his eyes everywhere.
They paused finally, and he waited for any hint or clue as to where they were. They began moving again and even over his heartbeat; he heard a rusty gate lock behind them. His panic rose higher as the chances of his escape lessened.
The discussion eventually veered toward Christmas plans, and Draco felt a deep, aching loneliness at the prospect of staying in the manor alone. Alone with all the ghosts. Seeming to sense his sudden swing in mood, Rolf smiled at him brightly.
“He hadn’t actually,” Ron replied before he continued. “He’s alright. Luckily he was with Zabini, who knew the counter-hex. It was that blasted Somnus Delorem hex again,”
Harry waved as he left the great hall, waving to some of the others as he went. He looked back to find Neville and Hermione still looking at Ron in shock. He snorted with a shake of his head as he pushed through the large doors and into the cold winter air again.
“Of course,” Harry promised, and he would. If Draco was anything to go by, then Pansy could have changed too.
Weasley looked at him for a moment before he also turned away. Was that disappointment he saw in the ginger’s pale blue gaze? Was Weasley really expecting him to be better than this too? He remained quiet for a moment before opening his mouth again. If he ever wanted to be friends with Harry, then this was his family. He gripped his hand around the strap of his bag as he swallowed.
“My dad used to say that all the good people in the world wouldn’t be able to fill every cell in Azkaban.” Said Luna looking at Hermione. Hermione sighed heavily and nodded. “And Draco isn’t a bad person; he’s a sweetheart.”
Draco knew he would have to write them all and thank them for their kind words. The two men knew him the best, and both knew how difficult it would be for him to return. Their words of confidence were greatly appreciated. Mihaela, on the other hand, was a mystery to Draco. They hadn’t socialised or spoken other than about work-related topics. He wondered why she had felt the need to commend him. He would write and see if he could glean any more information.
“Now that wasn’t very nice. Why would you ruin a perfectly good meal for yourselves by harassing my friend here?”
“Yeah, Professor Vector said she’s testing us as soon as term starts again. Plus, Arithmancy is fascinating.”
The other one was shorter with hair so thin and white it looked like a gust of wind would blow the remainder clean off. She wore large rimmed glasses and no makeup, but her face was no less creased and as thin as her partners. Both looked like their clothes had seen better days.
He looked out into the snowy night and decided that the Slytherin wasn’t coming back, and if he waited much longer, he would look a fool if and when he did return. He shook his hair of the snow and re-entered the castle, pushing the large doors with a groan. How he’d not heard it when Malfoy had come out earlier, he didn’t know.
There was a saying in Italy that “you should sell your coat and buy Betony” as its healing properties were too numerous to count. Hops and Feverfew were hardly surprising either as both were known relaxants, both commonly used as migraine treatments. As soon as the liquid had oozed it’s way down his throat, he felt the pain in behind his eyes recede and the churning in his stomach grind to a halt. He waited to feel the steam out of his ears, but when nothing happened, he quirked an eyebrow at Blaise. He shrugged back. “It’s Italian.” As if that explained everything, and in a way, it did. The Italians were well known for their potion tinkering and mastery. Da Vinci was known as a leading potioneer in the wizarding world.
Harry had seen the sphere before, minus the cracks. He was the one who found the sphere a few months ago during a raid. The sphere was unimportant to the case at hand, but Harry had a suspicious feeling about it, and after blasting it with every curse-detection spell he knew, he wanted to destroy it. But Robards stopped him and sent it to the Mysterious Artifacts Division, more colloquially known as MAD.
Harry is pleased to note that Draco has forgotten about his embarrassing slip-up and is now focussing on Harry instead. “I notice everything about you. I know you hate the spicy rice the school serves every Monday night. You put double the amount of sugar as usual into your morning tea if you’ve slept poorly. You read by the lake when it’s sunny out. You only drink coffee if Minerva offers some to you; otherwise, I think you hate it. I… I know a lot more, but I still don’t think it’s enough,” Harry declares. “I want to keep learning things about you until I perish.”
Draco spent his childhood and teenage years holed up in a mansion. His parents were strict and overprotective. He only knew curfews and restrictions. He was showered with toys and gifts but was never allowed to hang out with his peers. He had never gone to concerts or parties, never drank alcohol or smoked, never had sex. He only registered for Business Studies because his father made him. His dream was to be free.
The following week, they met in the Healers’ waiting room again. Potter talked while Draco listened, basking in his attention and drinking in Potter’s bright green eyes and straight white teeth.
A short time later, another two guys arrived, both peeved that they had started eating without them. They were both tall and visibly tired.
“Nonsense!” Narcissa cried, opening the doors to Draco’s bedroom and spelling all the lights on. “We’ve been expecting this ever since you first declared your love for The Chosen One back in Halloween.”
Neither of them had real jobs; they didn’t have to. Nowadays, Potter was more known as a philanthropist while Draco mostly kept to himself in the flat he shared with Pansy in Muggle London, spending away his inheritance while looking for things to do. Draco didn't subscribe to the Daily Prophet, but Blaise sometimes sent copies through the Floo. That meant Draco knew whenever Potter was on the news.
Much to Harry's relief, instead of being offended, Draco laughed. He did, however, change the subject. Despite bringing him up often, Draco never appeared to enjoy talking about his father. "Our match against Rosenberg is next Monday. It’s an open game, so you can come and watch us if you want.”
The parcel was addressed to “Harry Potter & Draco Malfoy” without any address. Harry deduced that the owl was a DMLE-trained owl who knew the location of the safe house they were in. He decided to wait for Malfoy before opening it.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says hastily as Malfoy rubs the back of his flushed neck. “Shit. I’m sorry. You’re just really hot. I mean, literally.” Harry’s face heats up. “You have a fever.”
Harry would have liked to admire Draco’s smile longer, but he is caught red-handed when the latter turns and sees him.
Harry wasn't in the mood to join any of the games, so he simply sat on the sidelines and drank white wine as his friends played drinking games and had rap battles. He had lost count of the number of times he had his glass refilled. He wasn’t even a big fan of wine, but the taste reminded him of Draco so he kept chugging it back. At some point during the night, while Neville struggled to find something that rhymes with
They obediently drank the yellow potions as instructed and answered all her questions. She found their progress satisfactory. She was visibly impressed when Harry reported they made sure to be in the same room at all times in case one of them loses consciousness; it made her happy when her patients took her warnings seriously.
"F… Forget I said that," Malfoy squeaks, bowing his head as his hand continues to rub Harry's chest. "I'm sorry."
Once done, Potter stayed in his spot, gazing up at Draco for a long time, his expression thoughtful and in wonder. Draco stared back, taking in his unruly black hair and tanned skin, and finding himself lost in thoughts about him.
Now being given the chance to address their relationship, Harry didn't know where to start. So he started with the most recent development. "Did you know we're soulmates?"
He has entered a laboratory of some kind, but what attracts his attention is beyond the glass panel at the side of the room. Beyond the glass is, undeniably, a large farm of what looks like giant, pink wheat. The stalks are seven or eight feet tall and shed a flurry of golden seeds that fly around the chamber like gold dust and stars.
But Draco couldn't concentrate on what Harry was saying. He was seeing doubles and his chest felt tight. "Harry, stop…"
Harry only stood up when Ron's Patronus passed through the door and stopped near his ankles. He cursed after hearing the message.
As he got his bearing, he felt the air chill and the wind blow stronger. He heard footsteps approaching, and immediately grabbed his wand by his hip.
Draco felt himself blushing as he mentally checked his weekly schedule. “I’ll call you on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. Around this time.”
Harry wonders if this is against any Federation rules. He is pretty sure this is fair game. He isn’t Draco’s captain. They do not share the same chain of command and are part of different crews. The only person who could potentially take offense is Lucius Malfoy, which doesn’t scare Harry.
Right on cue, the bathroom door opened, and Malfoy walked out, fully dressed in a navy blue shirt and grey trousers, a towel hanging by his neck. “Oh, good morning,” he said. “Did you sleep well?”
“Not in front of the students,” Draco replies, still holding onto Harry’s chin and staring at Harry’s mouth.
Even Weasley nodded in agreement. “We’ve been practising receiving Malfoy’s passes these past few weeks. This will be just the same, only faster, right?”
Draco detested Rosenberg’s Zacharias Smith instantly. The guy had an obnoxious face and an even more despicable attitude. His gameplay was mediocre but he was extraordinarily annoying and sucked all the fun out of the game. For some reason, he particularly enjoyed taunting Draco. When Smith successfully stopped Draco from scoring in the first quarter, he emitted a shrill laugh.
blond down to the roots, side-parted and stylish, the tips stopping short of his sharp, clean-shaven jaw. His eyelashes were as pale as his flawless skin and Harry could see some shine over his pink lips.
"Potter, I want you to know. You don't need to apologise for having nightmares. I used to have them too. I… I understand, is what I'm trying to say. So you don't have to be sorry."
They laid back against the pillows. Harry stayed still as Draco’s hands felt around his face. Nimble fingers touched his scar, tenderly removed his glasses before softly skimming over his eyebrows and eyelashes, and rubbed against his lips.
Uncle Harry sighs again, but this time in relief. “That’s great, Teddy! Er, wait here. I’ll go get him.” He leaves Teddy’s room for a short moment. When he comes back, he is followed closely by a slender man with a strikingly fair complexion, sharp features and sleek blond hair, dressed entirely in dark colours.
Draco lied across the couch, a free hand idly combing his own hair. “Would you like me to call often?”
Harry returned home and sulked in his bedroom. Five minutes before five o'clock, Ron dragged him out of bed and tried helping him find something presentable to wear. It was a disaster as both men were out of their element. It wasn't until Ginny came to the rescue that they managed to pick something decent and Floo'ed to the Burrow.
Nodding, Harry transfigured the rock into a proper stool, complete with a cushion. He then did the same to Draco’s stone-stool. Draco muttered his gratitude as they both settled down around the table, the sphere glowing ominously.
“Potter? Potter, wake up!” Draco placed his other hand on the Potter’s shoulder and shook him as hard as he could. “Wake up!”
"Thank you, Malfoy." Potter closed his eyes, though his body remained turned towards Draco. "Good night."
Other students started milling in. Gregory Goyle was easy to spot, due to his large size. With an incredible height and a wide build, he towered above the other students; he was practically made for this sport. Blaise Zabini, dark-skinned and tall himself, appeared small next to Greg. Theodore Nott, scrawny and completely overshadowed by the other two, followed closely behind.
More importantly, he trusted Draco's judgement. He defended him whenever other Ministry officials tried giving Draco a hard time. He liked telling Draco about his friends, about his godson, about Quidditch, and other random tidbits, even though Draco never shared stories of his own. Sometimes, Draco felt Potter was protective of him, and even though this
“You chose a flavour I like.” Malfoy seems flattered. “Is this another one of those products new companies ask you to try out and give ‘honest reviews’?”
Malfoy jerks up and starts rambling, "Don't be daft. Of course I like you! That's the only reason I didn’t kick you out as soon as the potion started working. I like hugging you. I love it when you hold me. But I also hate embarrassing myself in front of you. Nothing frightens me more than you discovering how hopelessly infatuated I am with you. How I call you endearing names in my head. How I fantasise about you." He buries his blushing face in his hands, but the words don’t stop. "I assumed you liked me, but you never touched me back when I touched you before this...
“Okay, okay.” Harry bites his lower lip to stifle his laughter. He leans forward and returns his arms to where they have been wrapped around Malfoy’s waist moments before. Malfoy has since turned so now he sits sideways in front of Harry, his own long legs crossing over Harry’s left thigh. “What other names do you call me in your head?”
He was quick on his feet. He could feint a jump on one side of the court, sprint to the other side and still send the ball barreling to the opponent’s court. He made up for his average height by jumping sooner and higher. Whenever he spiked a ball to the other side, the loud sound of the ball slamming onto the floor was nothing short of satisfying.
If Harry had to describe his relationship with Draco Malfoy, five years after they exited the realm of limbo, he would fiddle with the silver wedding band on his left ring finger and grin happily, no words necessary.
“Volleyball?” For the first time since meeting Harry, Draco felt disappointed. “I expected something more exciting.”
"And I hate acting this way in front of you,” Malfoy continues. “I bet you think I'm silly and pathetic because I say these embarrassing things to you but I can't help it because—" He slaps a hand over his own mouth, muffling the rest of the sentence.
Draco’s soulmark appeared on his twenty-first birthday, branching lines covering the inside of his right forearm. From the pulse point of his wrist, a single black line diverged and split even further until there were a dozen endpoints, the tip of the farthest branch stopping just short of the fold of his elbow.
Professor Scrimgeour started shouting names in pairs and then pointing at seats in the front row. He would wait for the two students to sit down before moving on to the next pair. He carried his metre-long ruler like a weapon, brandishing it at students who walked too slowly while he yelled at them to hurry up.
came to accept Draco after they got over the initial shock. Andromeda seemed pleased to see her nephew get on so well with Harry while Teddy was just thrilled to have another relative who spoiled him with gifts.  Draco was most nervous about telling his parents, so they held that off for as long as they could.
