“But even a weak Patronus can provide some clarity when facing Dementors.” Hal recited dutifully.
“But it isn’t a bank.” Anthony countered. “You don’t just rent a room with a Cerberus to stash your stuff.
, he just felt a little bit like a deer who had been ambushed on a hunt and then realised the hunter wasn’t going to cast any spells or release the dogs, and also he’d ran all the way there – he paused to rethink what had just happened. His plan had… worked? It seemed being an honorary Slytherin for the night had somehow made him off-limits for bullying, at least there and then. He’d take that.
*             *
“It was deceiving.” Draco argued. “And it’s only okay because it turns out he’s the good guy, isn’t it? If he really had been after you, he could have approached you and harmed you ridiculously easily, you realise that?”
“Can we see him?” Hal asked.
They also had a chance to properly get together before the end of year feast. Pan hugged Hermione something fierce, and decided they should “stop talking about that shit for a second already” so he could share his news instead. Hermione was immediately supportive and really happy for him, and of course excited about learning everything that could possibly be known about the views on gender identity and the process of transitioning in the magical world.
She took a deep breath, looking at each of them in turn as if to make sure she had their attention, and made her announcement.
Hal bit back a retort, heeding Hermione’s warning not to provoke him. Instead he tried to take stock of the situation. He looked around again – though keeping an eye on Quirrell – but there was nothing, the room was completely bare. What was the dog guarding, then? What was Quirrell here to steal? The mirror? Seemed a bit cumbersome to take with you.
“If it hurts, I think you should speak to a professor.” She urged in a hush.
“Yeah.” Hal scoffed. “For all the good it’s doing me. So far, one’s a teacher who hates my guts and the other is in jail for associating with the man who killed them.”
the stupid award.”
He pushed past them, leaving them too surprised to retaliate – proving Hal right: bullying him, if whatever this had been could qualify as such, had been a spur of the moment thing, and not really something they were used to doing.
“What?”
for what it meant to them, forgetting what it meant for Harry.
“We’ll see you from the public gallery.” Neville added.
I am rather fond of this verse and I really want to keep it up. I hope it won't be too long before I can start sharing the second book, writing is in progress! Ideas are welcome.
“Alright.” He sighed. “If you say so. I’m not going to force you to talk about it. But if this happens again, I’m not going to ignore it, okay? I don’t want you to think you’re alone in this, whatever
“Oh, Merlin.” The professor sighed. “Let me speak to the headmaster.”
“How did you figure out the formulas?” He asked.
This year, the Parkinsons were holding it, and Pansy
Hal went serious again. “I’m not going after a troll, I’m going to make sure my friend is okay.”
“Let’s see your game, Longbottom.” Blaise grinned back.
“About Sirius Black…” He swallowed, not sure how to continue – or even where to start.
“Yeah.” Hal said, although he felt a little shaken.
Hermione let out a heavy sigh. “Magic sometimes is just frustrating.” She asserted. “There’s a lack of
Hal had thought it was a seventh year, given his height, but it was a grown man who whirled around when he heard Hal’s footsteps, and after the first moment of startled surprise at his scraggly appearance, he recognised him. Sirius Black – the same haunted eyes, dark circles under them, stringy hair, unkept beard, torn clothes that Hal had seen in the paper.
“With all due respect. Sir.” He added, more subdued.
“The club?” He asked.
“Full story later?” Hal suggested with a slight wince. “Let’s get out of here.”
“He’s pleading Imperius.” Hal sighed, looking up from Sirius’ letter.
“Home.” She repeated sadly. “My precious boy, you poor child.” She said again – Hal really wish she’d stop. “You should never have been raised by Muggles. Harry Potter, raised by Muggles. What is wrong with this world?”
Quidditch practice, because the game was in two days and Oliver had made them get up as the arse-crack of dawn to train.
Wait, what?
“Yeah, goblins.” Hal carried on, only part of his brain stopping to wonder how this was now his life. “So we’re at the desk and this one goes –
“Fosters other things, too.”
He darted down the stairs, and Hal was now the one following him. They headed in the direction of the Potions classroom, and Snape’s office, and they were only halfway there when they ran into Draco, completely fine and oblivious.
“When is it?” Hermione asked.
“What’s wrong?”
The rest of the fund would be for Hal to access when he was older, and Petunia realised now, picking up the small key gingerly between her fingers as well, that she had no idea how much was in there, or in its Wizard equivalent. She knew her parents had left both her and Lily a small sum, and as Lily had died only a year and a half after them, most of it had probably still been there, but it would have been chipped away for Harry’s care over the years.
Such as: Dumbledore had been away when they were down in the Chamber, called to the Ministry following complaints from the school governors, to reassess if he should remain in his position as Headmaster of the school in view of the disturbing events. The fact that Fawkes had come to Hal was… well, magical? The bird’s abilities remained undetermined. It seemed that Hal showing loyalty to Dumbledore (he didn’t attempt to correct people on the assumption, even if he’d been riling up Tom Riddle at the time more than pledging his faith in the old wizard) had been the trick.
“We may or may not have sneaked into a Muggle cinema.”
Hermione seemed to have gotten mostly books. Ron mostly handmade items – not least among them the knitted jumper with a great big R he was wearing now. Anthony, mostly things related to riddles and adventure. Draco, mostly really pragmatic, practical objects. Neville, mostly confidence-boosting gifts. Hal thought it was quite a good insight into all of his friend’s lives at home, and their relationships with their families.
“Come to Divination with me, mate.” Ron invited.
“Look!” Ley shrieked, animatedly pointing at Hal. “Look what we found!”
As the rest of the Hall erupted in various degrees of panic and bewilderment – how had the beast been able to get in? – Hal and his friends turned to each other in immediate understanding. Lupin. Whatever he usually did to get himself out of the way during the full moon, clearly this time something hadn’t gone to plan.
Doing his best to look chastised and remorseful, though it couldn’t be further to how he truly felt, and focusing on what the professor was saying so as not to get himself into more trouble, Hal did not hear the faint hiss moving through the corridor.
“Now, darling, I know I can’t tell you to reconsider being in your sports team…”
“Because I mean, technically, he’s
“Yeah, he said you’re not so bad yourself.” Ley grinned.
all get for Christmas?” Hermione asked.
“What?” Draco’s frown intensified.
“Well, I believe Professor Sprout has got you raising mandrakes. Once mature, their properties are quite extraordinary. Mrs Pomfrey and Professor Snape will be able to devise a potion to fully heal Colin, Justin, Mrs Norris and Sir Nicholas.”
“It is extremely advanced magic – don’t take it personally.” He smiled, seeing Hermione’s face starting to look like he was straight out insulting her intelligence. “Many grown wizards can’t manage it. I won’t even be teaching that to my NEWTs levels.”
Lost in thought, Draco looked up across the table at Hal. He’d only spoken after a few minutes of silence, after Draco had ranted about the ball for a bit, and as such Draco had almost forgotten what they were talking about. They were studying in the library, and he’d only really mentioned it because Hal, writing down the date for his essay, had commented it was only three weeks to Christmas, and had asked him if there were different traditions in the wizarding world.
He turned back to Hal, who shrugged helplessly – he wasn’t going to be the reference in magical creatures, he’d only started finding out about this stuff a year and a half ago – and then to Anthony and Draco. The two exchanged a look.
“Hello, Mrs Dursley.” He smiled at her politely, then more widely at Ley, though he still felt a little awkward around the other boy, having only crossed path briefly in the past. “Hi, Ley.”
Neville rolled his eyes. “I do not have a crush on Hannah.” He defended.
Pansy looked like she was going to snap something back at him again, but she paused, her lips parted, considering.
“Heard that's how you made the team.” He sounded proud, and Hal regretted even more not having been able to show him a bit more of what he was indeed capable of.
Draco scoffed, but Flint balled and raised his fist, and Draco figure he might as well prevent that from landing in his face.
Hal’s aunt came back with Madam Pomfrey, who cast a few spells over Draco to check his vitals. She only seemed half-satisfied.
At first, Hal figured he’d only gotten away without detention thanks to Draco’s mediation. They had pointed out the Quidditch foul (and God, he hoped Colin had had the sense to stop for a minute in his “report Harry Potter’s every move” frenzy and hadn’t been taking photos of
Sirius’ eyebrows just went higher, and he clearly was highly amused by Hal’s predicament.
To his friend’s credit, he didn’t stop to question his sanity, and followed right after him as Draco ran out of the room, leaving Tom’s diary on his bed.
“You’re twelve and you know you want to transition.” He pointed out.
He shouted, drew his wand though he couldn’t gather his thoughts quickly enough to know what to do with it, as she threw something at him before he had time to move. A powder of some kind, which filled his nose and eyes. He had time to cough, once, before he felt himself starting to fall. He didn’t hit the ground – the last thing he felt before he lost consciousness was the woman’s arms catching him.
“You’re Harry Potter?” Ron was still gaping.
“Eh, hello.”
“He tans easily, that’s all.” Petunia said defensively.
Neville, Hal and Ley laughed, but Hermione glared, and Draco seemed to be sharing her opinion since he was on tiptoe, trying to get a better look at the man.
“My mother’s always loved France.” He said by way of an explanation. “We spent a lot of holidays in different parts of the country. I started learning early.”
“You’ll probably see the guy again though, you realise that, right?” Ley pointed out. “I mean, unless you want to completely stop hanging out with Harry, but…”
“It’s increasing?” Hal interrupted, feeling quite overwhelmed. “How?”
“Oh for Merlin’s sake!” Someone cried behind them, as if on cue. “Stop messing about for five seconds, you two!”
They both gave him a look of absolute terror, and ran off promptly, glancing behind them as if to check he wasn’t following or drawing his wand on them.
“If you could be quiet and argue later.” Hal hushed.
“Is he not going to be?” Hal asked.
“You live in a giant mansion yourself.” Draco pointed out.
“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?” He asked, trying not to sound critical. “Why didn’t you tell me
“Do they…” Hal hesitated. “Do they know what happened?
He’d thought it was a parrot of some kind, but now he was closer up, he could see it looked nothing like. It wasn’t like any bird he’d ever seen, actual, and Hal had no idea if it was even one of those tropical birds you might see on those nature documentaries that looked so odd and colourful, or if it was a magical bird that Muggles wouldn’t even be aware of.
“Awwww.” Ley immediately took the piss, which effectively defused any embarrassment.
“It’s not getting worse.” Draco asserted.
“As such, in view of the events of the past two days.” The Headmaster continued with a glint in his eyes. “There are some last-minute points to award.”
This was something Hal needed to hear. The
“My parents?” He asked, barely above a whisper.
“I fell.” Draco shrugged, in a tone that suggested it wasn’t entirely untrue, but there was more to that story. Hal frowned, and resolved to ask again later.
“As you know, the House Cup rankings are not final until the very end of the year, and every student can still earn or lose points until they have alighted the train in King’s Cross.”
They came through to the next room, which was filled with giant dragonflies. At least, that was what it looked like – upon closer inspection…
“Get out.”
“It was!” Sarah cried, clearly an old argument. “Anyway.” She smiled back at Hal. “Thank you.”
“I could ask my friend if I can go with them?” Hal suggested, remembering Draco had mentioned he would traditionally be going shopping with his mother. “Travel is… easier, for wizards. They could pick me up and drop me back off, I’m sure.”
“This is the absolute truth.” Anthony put a hand over his heart, though his voice was shaking with laughter. “My father’s cousins in America were directly involved. Of course Rolf will probably tell you otherwise, but he’s a little biased because he worships the ground his grandfather walks on.”
“I can keep a secret, if that’s what you’re asking.”
Some scenes in this chapter are similar in some ways to what a school shooting would be like – it’s brief, and there's no actual guns, but please heed this as a warning if that doesn’t work for you.
After cake and candles, they did presents – Hal had bought George a prank quill that started writing nonsense if you left it unattended, and Fred a Lego set to build a spaceship. Bit of a risk, that one, but Ley had wanted to pick something with him (he also would have loved to come, but he’d been invited on the same day by one of his friends from school, and as Hal pointed out it wasn’t Ron who had invited him – because Ron would definitely have told him to bring him – he’d decided, maybe next time. It was weird, being apart, not going out to the same friends).
“Dumbledore said she’s only petrified.” Neville reminded him.
Hermione tried to explain all of it, which in Hal’s opinion only muddied the waters. It was Dean – who was as Muggle-born in education as Hal was, when it boiled down to it – who eventually intervened. They were sat together in the common room, during a time engineered by McGonagall so that older students would be available to answer questions about the new subjects that they had to chose. Hermione had gone around asking a lot of people and had made notes, so the rest of them had decided they probably didn’t need to.
Hal figured he still was going to get killed, at least not right away if they “needed him to get the stone”, whatever that meant, but he could very well be made to be in a lot of pain, he was sure there was a wizard equivalent of the classic bullet in the kneecap you saw in films, so he took a cautious step forward. Slowly. His best plan was still time-wasting.
He stepped forward, and Draco felt his heart jump as he patted Hagrid’s arm,
From the corner of his eye, when his vision wasn’t blurred but another shake of the rogue broomstick, he could see some commotion in the stands, and in the back of his mind, thought there was something reassuring in being surrounded but witches and wizards. At least if he fell, surely someone would know a spell to ensure he didn’t crash and die.
“It’s not stupid.” Draco said.
“I’ll walk.” Pan interrupted her.
“Oh. No, I hadn’t even thought of that. I don’t think what happened then has anything to do with Harry’s power, I doubt any one year-old would have that kind of magic either way. No, because his parents were really talented.”
“I tripped.” She answered easily.
Hal laughed, and said goodbye to his aunt – he’d spoken to Ley earlier too, but he still told her to tell him Little John Silver said hi. Ron walked into the dorm just as he was putting the phone down.
“You should eat.” The woman said, ignoring his question – maybe for the best. “You skipped dinner.”
“As good a way as any to get around.” The man said.
“He hates all Gryffindors.” Hal insisted. “And me in particular. I told you how he picked on me all of our first lesson. I’m not crazy, right?” He turned to Ron and Hermione for back up, and they both nodded and gave other examples.
“I’m invisible.” He said dumbly.
and cast an anxious look through the window overlooking the Forbidden Forest. Draco could only guess he had proper arachnophobia – although the idea of a spider that could be 20 feet tall certainly did not make him feel comfortable, he wasn’t squirming just thinking about it either.
“Except for your stupid floating head.” Seamus ranted some more, throwing a pillow at him.
“Mate, I’m sure they’ll understand, we’re not five.” Hal assessed. “I mean, I’ll avoid making a big deal of it, but we’re not going to keep it a secret or anything, right?”
Hal suppose it was his cue to follow, thought he took a few seconds to himself to take a deep breath and give Sil a few soothing strokes – the young cat did not seem impressed at the prospect of walking into a live fire. Behind him, he could hear the clicking sounds of the photographer’s camera, and that was what pushed him to get on with it.
“For remarkable level-headedness allowing them both, in different ways, to use their skills and knowledge to protect their friends against danger, I award thirty points to Rolf Scamander, and thirty points to Neville Longbottom.”
“I don’t think he would have gone too far.” Hal judged, though nothing was less certain.
“So I’ve heard.” Hal nodded. “I’m alright, though.”
He purposefully mentioned Draco’s and Anthony’s parents rather than his friends themselves, thinking that would probably reassure Snape more than arrangements between children.
Hal and Ley ran back towards the house, almost tripping over their own feet, and Petunia came out of the study with a look of panic.
Ron gave him a look. “Because you think that would stop Oliver if this was a match day, or even a practice day? Better get used to it, mate. Come on. If you keep stewing in here one minute longer, we’ll be able to bottle you.”
“MOOOM! Mom! Mom!”
Hal jumped away from the wall, a strangled cry catching in his throat as a blooming ghost emerged from just where he’d been leaning.
“You know.” Narcissa suddenly spoke, her voice soft, and Petunia realised she was looking at her. “I used to despise your kind.”
Hal didn’t really know what he meant by that, but he supposed if his friend wasn’t pissed off, it was good enough for him.
Such as when he asked: “Is it true that Potter has nightmares about You-Know-Who?”
He stopped himself, discretely embarrassed.
Narcissa and Draco were still undeniably posh, in the way they spoke and held themselves, but there was a softer edge to them both too, compared to what Dora knew Purebloods could be like. Once reassured that her parents, Narcissa and Harry’s aunt seemed to be getting on, and were all on their way to the kitchen for tea and biscuits, she turned her attention fully to the boys.
“They keep getting shorter.” The confession blurted out unbidden.
.) and he had such a bright smile and he – he was smothering Draco in a hug. Definitely a tiny bit taller.
“It’s lovely to meet you, Pan. Come out of the rain.” His mother said immediately, before Anthony could even add or ask anything.
He leaned to look behind her, but she seemed to be alone. His little movement did not escape her, and she sat down next to him trying her best to look uninterested.
“Oh.” She actually lit up minutely. “That’s right around the corner – you could walk there in twenty minutes or so, if you want. Or I can set up a hearth, it would be-”
“I guess.” Hal mumbled.
He was, too. A number of alarm bells were still ringing, telling him not to be naive, to not trust a word out of the man’s mouth, but they were growing faint. Black was either telling the truth, or he was an excellent actor, and Hal thought the former more likely the more he listened to him. His aunt had once told him he was intuitive – maybe it was true. He felt like he would know if the man was lying to his face. He also felt he would already be dead if that really was what Black’s intent was.
The debate that ensued touched on whether Shakespeare had been a wizard (unlikely) or had known some actual witches (less unlikely) and ended with Pan and Hermione almost shouting at each other about how realistic Prospero was, but Draco knew they would probably be fast friends after that. Ron was just looking at them in mild panic the whole time, and Draco didn’t think he learnt all that much about Shakespeare.
is too, apparently.”
“I wonder, I wonder…” The old man continued being cryptic as he set off towards the back.
Oh, not her too, Draco thought desperately, and he couldn’t help it if his voice dropped a few degrees of warmth again, as it had earlier facing Severus.
“Ah, fame.” A voice spoke right next to his head.
“Oh, yeah.” She scoffed. “Huge difference.”
we talk about at home. And let me tell you, the team has never been so strong. And
His appendix had burst, a nurse had told them. He had to have surgery right away, but it was a common procedure and they shouldn’t worry. Hal knew getting your appendix removed was a common procedure. He also knew it was less common, and a lot riskier, when it had already burst.
The last one was a page in aggressive font laying out the details of the “Statute of Secrecy” and promising immediate Ministry intervention should magic be revealed in any convincing way, whether by mention or demonstration, to anyone outside the household. Beneath the standard template, the addition read:
“Sorry.” Draco said, holding the squirming animal back. “I didn’t want to interrupt. He was crying.” He added, scratching Sil’s neck, then turned to Hal’s aunt. “Hello, Mrs Dursley.”
Hal huffed a laugh, and scuttled along, hopping up the stairs and not stopping to think (or change his mind) before he knocked on the door with a repressed sigh. It was only a minute before Quirrell opened the door.
In the first theory, Hal had picked Colin because he was annoyed at the constant harassment. In the second, Flint had picked Colin in retaliation after his altercation with Hal, to show him that he’d target the ‘followers’ of whoever challenged him.
of sharp, stone steps. It was a miracle he hadn’t broken his neck.
Draco’s strangled voice still managed to be sarky as he mumbled something about being a little tied up, but Neville seemed to manage to get one of his hands free, and shouted the spell. The effect was immediate, the plant… shrieking? and shrivelling back to the sides of the room.
On the other side, his mom seemed to be laughing with her sister, and Hal’s breath was taken away at how beautiful she was, how beautiful they both were. Petunia looked younger, carefree, her blond hair a halo around her head, and Hal’s other grandparents were standing in the background too, looking proud and kind. Vernon was conspicuously absent
Draco was just about to head off to the dungeons, when he spotted his godfather walking (storming) back from the direction of the main entrance.
“I know.” Hal assured her again. “Do you want to call your parents?”
She barely seemed to hear it – Draco did not expect her to be amazed by the feat, she didn’t seem to care enough about the rules and running of a Quidditch game for that, but he thought at least she’d be happy Gryffindor had won, if only for Hal. But she clearly had other things on her mind, and was practically vibrating with it.
“Almost thirteen.” Draco sniffed.
“Well, I mean I’ve not played in a cup game yet, but I’ve trained with the team, and I guess I can hold my own with the rest of them, even though they’re all older.”
He thought he was probably rambling a bit, but he was nervous. People were milling about around them, they were about to step onto a magical train that would take them to a magical school, and there he was explaining his and his cousin’s nickname, which the poor girl probably couldn’t give a rat’s arse about.
“You might not know even know yet, anyway.” Pan added with a shrug. “I don’t know.”
She hesitated, giving Draco another measuring look.
“Another letter from Aunt Andromeda?” He guessed.
“Looking for Sirius Black, I would assume.” Lupin suggested.
to try and steal something from under Dumbledore’s nose.”
To the resulting wave of
Krum was a Seeker Ron absolutely worshipped. At sixteen years old, he was only just starting his professional career, but every press release in the world seemed to agree that he showed more promise than any Quidditch player had in a long time, and could become bigger than Wronski himself.
“No shit.” Hal snorted.
“Guess I could have handled it better.” He muttered.
“I’m sorry.” He said. “I don’t know what that means.”
Hal didn’t let him finish speaking before he cast a jinx at him, but the red light of the spell went right through him.
“Why don’t you fuck off?” Ley snapped.
“He’s not strong enough.” Hermione said softly, patting his back. “Hal, he was a force to be reckoned with during the war, but now he’s nothing. A ghost, a memory.”
Anthony had a wince at that. “I can’t imagine it would have gone down well with him.” He said wryly.
Everyone fell silent, and looked between Luna and Hal, who almost
“Hal, don’t be ridiculous!” She whispered furiously. “We have no idea what’s going on, you’re not going to just go after him!”
“Like I said, though, I’m not going to ignore that.” Hal continued. “I want to think about it, if that’s okay?”
Hal’s smile was genuine, at last, when he said: “No shit, Sherlock.”
“But if you want to meet me in my office on Saturday.” Lupin carried on. “Instead of focusing on the spell that makes Boggarts go away… maybe I can teach you the one against Dementors.”
“That’s good, I guess.” Hal said thoughtfully.
“Really?” Draco asked honestly.
“I don’t see anyone else doing anything to figure this out or stop it.” Anthony insisted angrily, still in a hushed voice. He brushed furiously at his eyes, and his voice broke when he added: “She’s so cold.”
“Come in, come in. Oh, you shouldn't have.” She added when Hal handed her the flowers and hamper, which he could only assume were for her.
“I know, mate.” Pan smiled at him. “We’ll see what happens this summer, if your parents are still in a generous mood.”
“Hal?”
“I’m okay.” Hal repeated, turning to Draco with a smile. “Sore.” He patted himself down. “Just sore. I think my magic acted up again, like that time with the troll? I do feel like I hit the ground, but not…” He gestured vaguely at the daunting staircase. “Like that.”
“Harry.” He said, then laughed, shaking his head. “Oh, you knew that. Bye now!”
Oh no.
“No, I mean.” Draco said quietly. “I like boys.”
“I love all of it.” He told her.
Ley looked half sheepish, half proud. “Oh, it didn’t last long with Elisa.” He said. “I’m dating Caroline now.”
“I honestly don’t understand how you can support them.” Anthony commented. “They’re really not a great team.”
“Sorry.” Hal grinned, not sorry.
He was finally in a good mood, it appeared. This win did give them a lead that meant it would take a real disaster in the Ravenclaw game for them to lose the cup.
It didn’t take him all that long – he did speed up a little when it looked like Quirrell was about to lose his patience – before he was standing in front of the mirror. He was relieved to see it didn’t reflect his would-have-been family. He’d have loved to see them again, and it would have been a great comfort, but he hated the idea of Quirrell, of fucking
know?”
“Don’t provoke him. Duck if he gets his wand out. Don’t die. We’ll be right back.”
But there were good times as well – most of the school, even people who hadn’t been particularly friendly before or fans of Hal’s, either showed them support, recognising the potential trauma of what they had been through, and/or admired them for their courage and thanked them for “saving the school”. More importantly, the mandrakes had finally matured, and the potion had been brewed, and the petrified people were able to be revived. Hal and Draco ended up getting out of the infirmary at the same time as them, and the first thing they did, the two of them, Hermione and the other three of their friends, was spend a good ten minutes in a massive group hug.
Draco blinked, quill hovering above the page, unsettled by this turn of events. He’d heard of spelled books that would hide your notes, for confidentiality, privacy or secrecy – he should have thought of it really, not that he would have been able to reveal them had it been the case – but one that wrote back? That was a whole different plane of magic.
“And now we know why you’re growing up to be a psychopath.” Ron concluded.
Hermione was
“I’m sorry.” Draco offered.
“See you on the other side.” Hal grinned.
“And your arranged marriage would be with Draco?” Anthony frowned.
He needed to assess his surroundings, and try to figure out a way he could get the hell out. He did realise being all drugged up wouldn’t play in his favour, but he certainly wasn’t going to just sit and take it quietly, and any attempt at an escape would go much better if he could see where he was going.
I've received such great comments, I've pushed out another chapter for you! It's a short one, but it's something. Hope you enjoy, you guys keep me going ^^
Snape’s bark startled him so badly he knocked a vial of ox blood off the table. It smashed on the floor in a hundred glass pieces and red splashes. Hermione immediately drew her wand and vanished the mess, earning herself a glare from Snape.
He sprung up from the common room armchair he was stroppily lounging in, suddenly struck by an idea. His godfather! He could ask Severus if he could stay with him, say he just wanted to get a chance to spend time with him outside of school. He only had to mention the fact that Narcissa would be away, he didn’t need any other reason than that, it wouldn’t be suspicious since he was family.
“Mine aren’t dead.” Neville clarified. “They’re in St Mungo’s Hospital. They don’t… know me. Or anyone. They don’t know who they are, who my grandma is, they don’t know about the war, or that they have a son.” His voice cracked and he wiped his eyes again. “They don’t know anything. They just exist.”
She squeezed Hal’s hand, omitting the details she had read with horror in Lily’s letters.
“He was ay dragon breeder!” Hagrid tried to defend. “It’s not illegal.”
Anthony and Hermione readily joined their friends, and Draco a little more warily, ending up only half perched on the edge of the bench – not so much to be able to run away, he wouldn’t leave the others behind anyway, but because six of them on that bench was really a tight fit.
“Hal.” Hal corrected instinctively.
“It is for some people.” Draco said. “My entire family, for generations, have been Slytherins, both on my mother and father’s sides. It happened before, one of my mother’s cousins was sorted into Gryffindor – he was disinherited and burnt off the family tree.”
Draco needs to pull his head out of his arse, I know. He will at some point. Next chapter, in fact!
“Nobody
And with something from the past. With a pang, Petunia lifted the photo out of the tin. It was Lily, and James, both so young, smiling wide, waving and blowing kisses, looking like proper goofballs. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She was not going to cry today. Today was Hal’s birthday. It was a happy day. A celebration.
“Alright.” She smiled at them both. “Let’s get back on the road then, shall we?”
“Is that what they told you?” Draco tilted his head curiously.
This chapter was getting very long with still the whole trial to go, so I’m splitting it here for a breather.
“Really?” Hermione raised a surprised brow. “The three of you? I mean, I knew your aunt and Draco’s mum spoke a few times, but holidays with Muggles doesn’t sound like a very
like that.”
Hal frowned, and Fred tapped the map with a finger and explained. “We saw him on the map, Peter Pettigrew, ages ago. But we thought it was a glitch.”
“How come I’ve never met him?” Ley probed.
“It’s true?” He breathed out weakly.
He didn’t think sass would put him in more trouble than he currently was. Probably? Both Quirrell and Voldemort seemed to have more pressing obsessions than asking him to watch his tone.
before he managed to get past the shock enough to officially proclaimed Gryffindor as the winner of the game, and of the cup, to a deafening roar from the supporters.
“What’s an acromantula?” Hal asked.
he’d been there. Well, he’d known, because he had a scar to show for it, but he’d never thought of himself as a witness of his parents’ death before. He hadn’t known what had happened. All his aunt had ever told him about that night was that Lily and James had died suddenly, and the next day Hal was brought to them. He’d imagined a car accident, or a house fire. He’d not asked for details, because he could see it was a sore topic, and quite frankly, he didn’t really want to know.
Other than that, I do see Petunia as blond and a lot happier-looking than her depiction in the films, not fully settled on it but Anne Consigny comes to mind (except not French).
“Are you missing work?” He asked, feeling guilty already.
“You went all protective just then.” He noted.
“You can’t get out there with a werewolf on the loose, mate.” Ron agreed.
“We were pretty sure you’d noticed us too.” He added.
He came to stand right in front of the frame, and with a jolt that ran right through his bones, he suddenly recognised the two figures standing closest to him in the mirror. His mom and dad. They looked so real he turned around again, but the room behind him was empty.
behind a door a simple unlocking spell will open, so forgive me if I don’t exactly count that as proof that there is nothing to worry about.”
Charming.
. Most of them seemed to reluctantly tear themselves away from the scene, though Hal’s friends stayed back when Lockhart ran off with the remaining groups of students, and Hal was left mostly alone with a scowling Snape.
“He mentioned that, yeah.” Sirius acknowledged. “He also said it’s going really well.”
“Something wrong?” Draco worried.
Comments are life, fire at will :)
Hal’s eyebrows raised a little, but he said nothing, and looked like he was willing to listen, so Draco carried on.
So Draco narrowed her eyes at her.
Either way, Draco wasn’t going to put that in a letter. But he was going to have to think about whether he wanted to tell Hal – if he was going to find out, Draco thought maybe it would be better coming from him – and when. Summertime in France did not seem like an adequate place and time for it. Maybe on their way back to Hogwarts? It would feel like lying in the meantime, every minute he’d spend with Hal. But Draco hoped Hal would forgive him for that and understand he’d wanted to spare the holidays.
“Who do we speak to?” Neville asked. “The logical teacher would be DADA, I suppose, but I think we can all agree that in this case it’ll be our very last choice.”
Hal hummed. “My uncle died when we were four. I only have a few memories of him, I think Ley has a bit more.” He shrugged. “I don’t really care. He wasn’t very nice.”
“Pureblood families marry into each other.” Draco explained. “To ensure the purity remains, since that’s all a lot of them care about. Most marriages are arranged, though maybe less so nowadays. Still, I think my mother probably has made her shortlist already by now. I’m guessing it has Pansy, Daphne and her sister, and the Carrow twins – they’re younger, you’ve not met them. Millie, I’m not sure, maybe Euphemia, though she’s nasty. If none of that worked out, I suppose Ginevra would be an acceptable match to her as well.”
Draco would have argued he didn’t do fuck all, and if he’d done anything it was leading Hal to certain death. Even when they had made it out, facing Lockhart, Hal was the one who had tried something and his meagre contribution had only been to follow Hal’s lead and try with him. He had been useless, helpless.
“Tomorrow!” She gasped, a hand over her mouth. “But I was meant to take you to the station!”
“Potter!” Quirrell yapped. “Come here.”
He didn’t want to talk about it at the best of times, let alone with the Headmaster.
“Yes?” Hal raised a brow.
“Thanks.” Hal said dryly. “Glad we cleared that up.”
Sev nodded, like he’d never expected her to say yes. “I understand this can be difficult to talk about.” He said. “I know this is still considered taboo, especially in Pureblood circles.”
“Take over!” Hal told Ley, although the latter followed him as he jumped up to greet his friend.
Draco considered it for a moment, but he thought he was truthful when he answered.
They went back into the kitchen in barely controlled chaos, Sirius miraculously managing not to drop any of the stuff he was still holding until he could put it down on the table while Petunia filled a vase. He presented a bottle of wine to her as well and a football shirt for Ley, from his favourite club.
“Actually-” Hal started, but Draco stomped on his foot. They were here to talk to Dumbledore, not to the Minister and his goose of an aide.
Draco was surprised to see Millicent Bulstrode as well, with her father and brothers. For decades, the Bulstrodes had been shunned from these parties on the belief that they had bred with Muggles and their blood had been tainted. They must have finally managed to convince the rest of them that they were as pure as they came. Or, and Draco thought more likely, as Pureblood numbers dwindled, the rules had been relaxed a little as to who could be part of the circle.
Hal looked down, and ahead, considering it. The balcony was curved, in fact, a bit like the front of a ship.
“Ah! Mister P-Potter. P-please come in.”
Hal snorted. “I have a problem trusting Quirrell, he’s not authority.” He argued.
Without waiting for a response, he glided back through the wall, leaving Hal wondering what the hell had just happened.
“Okay.” Luna nodded seriously. “I will do.”
“Or in the case of Hogwarts, it’s how the House-elves know where to bring your stuff, or how points get knocked off.” Fred added. “It’s like a fingerprint of your magic, of which the school holds the database.”
Draco frowned. “Going to run away?”
“Being stuck in an arranged marriage, forced to have kids, I suppose.” Pan said dismissively, though they could all tell he was uncomfortable. He had a dry chuckle. “Basically becoming my mother.”
“Ron, Draco, you’re the best flyers.” Anthony designated.
“It wasn’t your fault.” Hal shook his head. He paused, and sighed. There was no way around it. “I’m Harry Potter.”
Hal spared a second to absent-mindedly be impressed by her vocabulary, then tuned out as she started arguing with Ron the values of knowing the history of a culture you had not been part of. He stared out the window for a few minutes, until the mention of his name snapped his attention back to the conversation.
When he couldn’t really push it off any longer, Draco took a deep breath.
“No, it was nice.” Hal mused. “Until it got ridiculous. You were there.”
“That’d be lovely.” Petunia answered. “I’ll be happy to meet him to.”
“Right.” Hal released his breath, his voice like steel.
“Seriously, though.” Ron beamed. “I feel so relaxed.”
He’d never liked that part of Halloween night, the part that came after the fun and games, the costumes and treats; the part that was just night, leading up to the next day where, inevitably, Petunia would look a bit sad, and Hal would not be able to not be reminded that he was an orphan, and had never properly known his parents. But it had never been unbearable – because after all, he had a parent. His aunt was raising him as her own, he was loved and taken care of. He had a brother – he had never been lonely.
Then, to his surprise, Hal reached out and took his hand, and with a serious look, asked him to start from the beginning. So Draco did – he told him about the bullying from the previous year, and the turn it had taken lately. He told him about his latest encounter with Flint, just before the game, and how that was why Hal had gotten hurt.
“Give him here.” Hal made grabby hands for the kitten.
Hermione bit her lip. “You understand you can’t tell anyone, right?” She worried. “I’m not meant to mention it, it’s really confidential, and-”
“Oh, yeah.” Hal complied, dashing back to their little camp. It only took him a minute so slip back into his jeans and t-shirt, and we skipped back still barefoot to where his admirers stood.
sex. Or in a lovely romance, whatever, don’t make that face.”
The next day, on the condition they would be back before 3pm to help her make sure everything was ready for dinner with Aunt Marge, Petunia let the boys go and play in the park – Ley couldn’t get enough of the new football he’d received for his birthday.
The trial had already been going on for two days, it being centred not just on Lockhart’s attack at the end of the previous school year, but on the decade of fraud it had uncovered, and most witnesses had been heard already. Draco and Hal, though, were considered key witnesses in that, so far, all that Lockhart had done could possible be considered a minor offence, from an eager author who had taken things a little too far, had gotten carried away and had started confusing reality and fiction. It demanded some restitution, sure, but not a heavy sentence. Attacking two students who were technically in his care as a Professor, however, was on a whole different level, and the backlash there would be much harder to evade.
Lockhart had a great hearty laugh. “He’s modest.” He told the rest of the class with a wink. “You can embrace your fame, Harry!”
So instead, he asked:
“Let me change your mind.” Niels insisted, putting his hands in Hal’s neck again and drawing him in for a kiss.
They said nothing for another few moments, until Draco thought he should also inform him…
“She’s the girl who died fifty years ago.” Hermione spelt out. “Did you never wonder how she died? She’s in her Hogwarts uniform – as soon as Blaise mentioned a girl had died, really, I thought of her. It just didn’t really connect, I guess I didn’t want to stop to think about it if I’m honest, but it was in the back of my mind, and when I realised the monster was probably a snake, I thought someone would have seen it, Basilisks tend to grow big, but then I thought of pipes, it must be travelling through the pipes, which fit with the way Hal had been hearing it along the corridors, and well, where do pipes lead? Bathrooms or kitchens, don’t they. Then I thought, actually, isn’t it odd that of all the places in the castle, Moaning Myrtle has decided to haunt a toilet? Which led me to think, maybe, that’s because it’s where she died. Maybe she found herself in the way of the Basilisk exiting or coming back to the Chamber, or at least she might have known something. I was on my way to ask her, when, well.”
Narcissa thanked the Elf and instructed her to call for Draco too before going down to greet Sirius, who had been shown into the entrance hall. He was looking around with a mixture of curiosity and distaste, surely prepared to dislike the place on principle. However, Narcissa could tell he had made an effort at appearing presentable; his hair was neatly trimmed around his face, the face itself fuller than it had been in the previous months and his clothes quite obviously more expensive than she had seen him wear on any of the news reports. In fact, he cut a rather dashing picture. A proper Black heir, as much as he would have hated that – but some things became ingrained in spite of yourself.
“I promise it will help.” The man added, addressing all of them, who hadn’t started eating his offering yet.
“Weird.” Hal chuckled. “I’m not sure I’m quite ready to go ask him for stories about my mom when she was younger, though.”
“Guys like Flint, I think it’s about power.” Anthony said with distaste. “I don’t think it would matter to him if someone is male of female as long as he can, I believe the words he’d use would be
“Oh, we’re not arguing against that.” Ron smiled.
As the world spun, he could only hope he would land somewhere sensible.
“I used to think Wizards were so, so superior.” She continued, her eyes sad, but with something like unexpected warmth at the bottom of them. “But here you are. A Muggle woman, who raised her boy as a Muggle, and…”
“But we didn’t.” She said firmly. “Nobody did.”
“Wait.” Hal suddenly remembered what he’d found out in his first year, from his aunt accepting to go through Lily’s old letters to see if she mentioned any friends. His dad’s friends, who were Peter, Remus and Sirius. “Wait, wait.” He repeated, his eyes widening. “You had a friend Remus, right? Is it – it’s not Remus as in Remus Lupin, is it?”
As much as the rest of the world wanted to believe so.
“Why would Quirrell want to harm Harry?” Anthony repeated pointedly.
He quickly learnt their names were Fred and George, and they were
He suddenly wanted to be sick. It had all been his fault, he had taken Hal down there. He had almost gotten him killed, it had been so, so close. If not for Dumbledore’s phoenix – whatever the hell it was doing there – he would be dead. They would both be dead. His mother helped him sit up as he dry-heaved, having nothing in his stomach.
So in the end, Draco – there really was no other word for it – ambushed him at the end of one of his Herbology classes. Ron eyed Draco a little warily, but Hermione dragged him off, and Neville pushed Hal back towards Draco as he tried to follow.
“Oh, yeah.” Hal nodded. “I’m not allowed anything strenuous for a few weeks – magic won’t be a problem but my aunt said we’ll take it easy in July anyway.”
“I’ll try Sev again.” He told him. “See if you can fine McGonagall.”
“I wanted to ask you if we could speak to Snape.” She blurted out.
“Draco?” The man frowned. “Is everything alright?”
It opened onto a greenhouse, the tallest plants reaching all the way up to the balcony they were on. The wrought-iron balustrade winded down into a spiral staircase taking you to the lower levels - another balcony on the first floor Draco said was to a music room, and all the way down to tiled paths weaving through beds of earth holding more plants that Hal could name.
There were a lot less people who hadn’t settled now, and he passed the stragglers quickly, trying not to crash into anyone.
Hal seemed to think he had had enough of hearing him talk as well, as he tried to throw an
She paused, and Pan patted her on the back. “I think the word you’re looking for is ‘clusterfuck’.”
“I did notice a few stray looks.” Anthony mused. “But he never seemed too interested in either.”
The words were still sounding in Draco’s head, making him feel sick, when Anthony barged into the room.
“We may never know for sure what happened that night.” Was the, as per usual cryptic, answer. “But there is old, old magic that this world has forgotten about, that may have been at play. Blood magic. You see, when your father and mother gave their life to protect you, they created a barrier so strong that Death could not cross it. Voldemort’s spell met this protection made of your mother’s love, and it rebounded against it.”
“You don't have to tell him you're in love with him.” He offered. “I do understand, you're only just going in fourteen, it's a bit much.”
“Thought I saw him walk away.”
No such luck.
will have to think about how you change your behaviour, your social attitudes, you will have to deal with the perception others have of you. It can put a stress on your state of mind, on your relationship with others. This is a life-changing decision, which is often considered much too big to be made by a child your age. As far as I am concerned, you are the best placed to know, but I will ask you this. Are your parents aware of this? Whether your feelings about your gender identity or your decision to transition.”
Various groans from his friends, and muttered admonitions from Hermione, told him everyone was accounted for.
“Now.” Lupin answered with a chuckle. “I’m taking you back to your Common Room, because it’s after curfew.”
“Keep the idiot safe, will you?” Draco turned to Anthony and Hermione.
, don’t get me wrong, but you need to evolve as well, you know?”
“We haven’t really had time to talk.” Dumbledore went on. “How are you finding Hogwarts, Harry?”
The celebration itself got a little overwhelming, though, and Hal found himself withdrawing to sit in a quieter corner of the common room when everyone got on to another loud round of Butterbeer-Quidditch. Hermione dropped on the other half of the love-seat a minute later.
, when his feet suddenly felt like he’d stepped in something sticky, clinging at his ankles.
“God, you’re such a mom. Alright, okay, I’ll go. Can I shower and change first?”
Pan snorted. “I know, right? Though admittedly he’s better at hiding it from Hal than he is from us.”
She looked on the verge of tears, but that clearly didn’t soften Pan’s reaction, whose nostrils flared.
Noooo Draco is relapsing. Well, I’m sure you were expecting this ;)
, and all around it were various other hair, skin and nail potions all promising to make any witch or wizard well-groomed and beautiful.
That was, if there was a later – Lockhart was babbling something about not being able to let them go now. Monologuing (about how he had grown to be an expert in memory charms from years of taking the credit for other people’s exploits) like one of those great villains in the plays Draco’s mother would take him to see as a kid. Didn’t usually end well for them, though.
Draco choked on a sob, because trust Hal to worry about
“Thanks.” Hal managed to say, still unable to quite make sense of what had just happened.
Hal and Draco had become a lot closer friends since their chat in the owlery. Hal was pleased to see Draco could actually have fun and his stilted education hadn’t ruined him forever. They didn’t have any more too-serious-for-your-age heart to hearts, they just started hanging out with the rest of their friends – Ron and Neville, who was following them around a bit meekly at first, but was coming out of his shell more and more, and Draco’s roommate Anthony – Ravenclaws were paired up in rooms, rather than having a larger dorm for all of them. It fostered studying, apparently.
1.	The 1991 (for the death of the Potters) isn’t a typo. I have modernised this by 10 years because… because. There are vague plot reasons (like I want Hal to have a phone), but mostly I just wanted to write things closer to my own age and experience.
Hal could tell his aunt was fruitlessly trying to remind them that the Malfoys were about to arrive to pick him up as the house descended into chaos, Ley creating a huge mess in the kitchen trying to find supplies to take care of the cat.
Hal shrugged. “I met her half an hour ago. But she does seem to be.”
? By an evil dark wizard who’d tried to murder him too? Making him somehow the person who ended a war? What the hell?
, but he didn’t really know what the value of things was in this world, yet.
“You too?” He challenged him.
Once again not a whole lot happened there, but I am quite fond of that scene in the Slytherin common room. Go Draco!
Severus kindly let that one slide, and he resumed his explanation.
“Exactly! Can you imagine how stunning he’ll be in a few years?”
Everyone at the table was roaring – no pun intended – when he sat down, clearly very pleased to have scored the famous Harry Potter. Hal thought at least he would be able to write to Ley telling him he could stop worrying about whether he’d be popular.
The jaws of the entire family watching them dropped, a shine in their eyes like this was the best thing they had ever seen in their life to date. Self-conscious, Hal brushed his hair back over it, but he carried on walking up to them anyway.
“Your parents had very good friends.” She carried on. “But after they died… I’m not sure where they are now.”
“It’s just weird.” Vince commented.
“I’ve got its twin.” Sirius explained. “It’s a means of communication. If we’re both looking at the same time, we can talk and everything. James and I used to use these a lot during our many escapades.”
about it, Granger, not read.”
Still plenty of action, hope you enjoy how things turn out.
Draco winced at how they pronounced his name, and he sent a look to Hal (still keeping his head down) and Ley (who had also fallen silent). Ley gave Hal a sideways glance.
Granger had rushed to Potter’s side before Severus could finish thinking
It had been Anthony’s idea, having their own little party and exchanging gifts after they were all back, to give themselves the time to get things that weren’t owl-order Honeydukes boxes.
, so that was some rather big flaw in that enchantment.”
Ley had an unconvinced pout. “If you say so.”
“You know Luna Lovegood?” Draco dropped a register or two, but maintained all the icy haughtiness he knew to muster in his voice.
If nothing else, they’d get the spectacular sight of Lockhart landing flat on his arse from Snape’s spell, and Hal would forever be grateful to the Potions master for this great moment. After this little demonstration, Snape directed – and Lockhart repeated it to try and pretend he was the one in control – the crowd of students to split into two groups, later years with the DADA professor and earlier years with him. He’d probably figured younger students would need more help, and therefore someone with any actual competence to mentor them.
“I’m good.” Hal answered truthfully. “The nap helped. Can we watch a film before bed?”
?” Ron added, looking slightly green.
“Harry.” He pointed at Hal.
“Hey, don’t change your mind on me now.” Hal nudged her. “I know it’s a risk. But… I feel like I need to do this.”
“This is becoming a little too… No.” He concluded. He nodded at Pan. “Good luck with everything.”
Hal gritted his teeth, forced himself to look amenable (after Lockhart told him to smile for the second time – he managed it by giving some attention to Sil rather than to the ridiculous adults surrounding him) and only politely cleared his throat when he noticed the clock was pointing to five minutes to nine.
“A giant bloody spider, that’s what.” Ron said, looking like he was going to be sick. “Tell me it was killed when they found it?”
They found a cosy café, where they were both recognised and triggered a clear mix of reactions, but the Auror following them (“This is Terry”, Sirius had introduced him casually) made for quite an effective buffer as he sat at the next table looking pissed of at the whole world, and nobody made a move to either approach them or shout something at them, whether positive or negative.
They all looked at each other in shocked silence for a minute, before Rolf suggested they speak to a teacher.
“He was pretty out of it.” Draco said with a smile, recalling how fuzzy Hal had been. It had been endearing, really. “But he’ll be alright, nothing a potion can’t fix, once it’s brewed.”
Draco frowned.
A woman joined her, her mother in all likelihood, and the child started shaking her arm frenetically.
They exchanged looks, realising just how much they had already stuck with each other for, in just two years. They were all in it together – all of it. Hermione gave Pan, and all of them, a smile.
“I don’t know about that.” Hal grumbled. He still hadn’t managed to produce anything corporeal.
When they managed to corner him between two classes, Draco thought at least he’d been carrying money on him, so maybe this would be the end of it. He gave Flint the galleons, and made his escape. And tripped over a leg one of them stuck out.
“What does it mean?” Another boy came forward. He snatched Draco’s bag off his shoulder. “Isn’t that in your books, little Ravenclaw bookworm?”
He resolved to pay more attention to Ron and his siblings, and if he could do things like that more often, without making it a charity case, he was more than happy for all his (still incongruous to him) wealth to have somewhere to go.
It was morning when Hal woke up next – he could tell by the light, though everything was blurred. He reached out, trying to find his glasses on the beside table, but only succeeded in knocking over the water that was still there. Feeling around for them, including in the bed and on the floor, he came up empty. The bitch had taken them. Brilliant.
“Well, maybe it would explain this.” She finished with a slight blush creeping up her cheeks, pointing at Hal’s head.
“I t-trust your exams went well.” Quirrell added – Hal thought it sounded rehearsed, and simply nodded and smiled uncomfortably. “I won’t k-keep you, P-Potter.”
Flint bared his (truly disgraceful) teeth, and actually stepped out of the way.
, mighty Morgana. He was several inches taller, maybe even taller than Draco now, and he was all tanned from playing outdoors (no doubt a lot more than Draco had, but then with his skin, it was ill-advised. He just
It took him a few minutes to feel like he could think again, pulling his mind back from the blank fuzziness Flint’s actions had caused. He had been so convinced he was going to get hit, he hadn’t braced himself for anything else, but that…
Hal shrugged. He wished it too – true stories, not the ones from all those people who knew the wizard who knew the witch who’d cut Lily’s hair once. But he didn’t want his aunt to feel guilty about it, and he’d stopped asking her to tell him more about his parents when he was about seven, after he’d realised it was paining her.
“How do you know all this?” Neville asked Pan with something like wonder.
“How do
Hermione gave him a curious smile, but there was too much going on around them for her to stop talking long enough to ask Hal what that was about.
“Promise me?” She asked.
, there was a rumble of thunder, followed about five seconds later by a sudden downpour. Pan ran to a nearby oak tree, sheltering under the wide branches.
“He’s usually a subtle man.” Draco had noted wryly. “But I think there’s some history there. They were in the same year at school, and I don’t think they really got along…”
“It’s a formality.” Ron concluded.
of being personally after you – because let me remind you, you felt the same about Professor Snape-”
She nodded in understanding and agreement, and waved her arms at the boys, looking stern again.
) who had killed his parents, and disintegrated himself in the process of trying to kill him too. He had heard rumours that the rebounding spell hadn’t entirely killed Voldemort – guess those had been right.
“Yeah.” Hal muttered. “It doesn’t mean…”
“Probably wise.” Hal mused, casting a look at Oliver who had moved on to getting Fred and George to promise hellfire on their opponent.
“Hal, darling, I have not told you this before, because I wasn’t sure if this would be relevant, but you are now old enough, and well, this letter confirms it - you…”
to be here. Maybe not all of them, but she had a strong sense that it was all either a lure or a test for Hal, specifically. She had called him paranoid, but things were adding up, and it was entirely possible Quirrell
Their silence was enough of a confirmation.
“Look, there-” The other bloke started.
“I thought of coming to you.” She continued. “Because… Because I’d like to change it. And I know there’s potions and I thought you might know something about that.”
Then of course, Hal started running towards it, leaving Draco to once again realise his utter lack of fitness as he went after him. By the time he caught up and reached the gamekeeper’s cottage, Hal was casting
“How can you be sure it was a spell at all, if you did not know it?”
Draco thought his conversation with Severus had gone well, all things considered. He had been his grumpy old self at first, when Draco was trying roundabout ways to make his point and getting absolutely nowhere, so in the end he’d asked point blank.
But that meant he had to actually listen to Arthur, who kept asking him things like: Does your aunt have a toaster?
“Goblins?”
“Of course.”
Potter we’re talking about.”
Hal’s grin expanded briefly, then died down.
“It must have been a lot to take in.” Pan appreciated, as Lana recounted how she had learnt all about the magical world throughout their courtship and the first few years of their marriage.
“No!” Hal cried desperately. “I mean. There’s no specific she, or he.”
Hal’s face broke into a smile. “Oh yeah.” He beamed, like he had forgotten.
Ron made a squeaky noise that may or may not have been the word
If Hal had had to describe the last few days of term, he’d have picked the word
“She won’t let him play.” Lee said, clearly the only one who had already caught up to their train of thought. “He’s a first year.”
“Yes.” Hal said wryly. “Because I consciously told myself – you know what, I will wait until Potions to doze off. Nothing to do with the fact that it’s the last class of the day and I’ve been running on about three hours’ sleep.”
Now Draco understood why they had never made him the target of public humiliation – word that he was Snape’s godson had clearly gotten out, and apparently even Flint wasn’t stupid enough to risk this getting back to him. He was clearly counting on the fact that nobody likes a snitch, and that Draco wouldn’t say anything to anyone. Ruefully, Draco had to admit he was probably right. He didn’t see himself going to Sev with this, it seemed entirely petty. He could handle it.
“A few snide comments here and there, nothing serious.” Pan waved a dismissive hand.
Ron had to drag them both out of bed in the morning, complaining and asking what was wrong with them today. They exchanged a look, and they both knew they wouldn’t say a word to anyone else about what had transpired.
“Seriously.” Ron sighed. “You get an invisibility cloak, and you’re more interested in your cat.”
“Yeah.” Pan looked at her (impeccably manicured) nails. “It’s not like I’m going to go to consult at St Mungo’s or go for any of the shady dealers in Knockturn or something, so… I thought maybe he could help. At least for information.”
He tried to make himself small, as he couldn’t help but feel like the portraits along the top of the wall were watching him, judging him, and sharing thoughts about him. He did see one slip into his neighbour’s frame and whisper something in his ear. Did they all knew who he was too, or were they too old to be up to date on current affairs?
Also, it meant no studying, which suited him. He had some homework, but he’d done a bit of it already, and he’d be able to finish up on the train back to Hogwarts. They were going to the Lake District for a week, and the boys were beyond themselves with excitement. Hal was still allowed to write to his friends, though by Muggle means only, and he well intended to find the most atrocious postcards to send off.
“Just like you can’t be a boy, then.” Draco snapped.
“It was fine.” He simply said.
She knew him too well. Hal realised he’d remained silent for too long when she sighed.
“I’m not gone yet, Ley.” He assured his cousin.
In the end, Ron’s dad managed to extract him – and the rest of his charges – from the shop, and ushered them to a quieter spot (all relatively, because the entire Alley was bustling). He announced they’d come back for their books when the signing was over, for those who didn’t have everything yet, that maybe then they’d be able to see where they were walking.
“Now is not the time.” She snapped. “Come on.”
“It’s really nothing to be excited about.” Hal muttered.
“Oh, look at you.” He whispered, feeling sorry for the creature but not quite daring to reach out and stroke his lacklustre feathers.
“I need to speak to you guys.”
“Draco?” Hal didn’t mean to interrupt him, but visions from his dream still danced behind his closed eyelids – damn, he’d closed his eyes again – and it seemed like he had to ask.
She’s been here before, Draco suddenly realised, as one of the girls behind the bar giggled at something man-Pansy said.
Hagrid let out a loud sigh, and gestured between Draco, Hermione and Anthony, and the bench where Ron, Hal and Neville were already squeezed.
“Yes.” She smiled. “I’ll see you very soon.”
But in truth, he was glad they could talk about these things. He couldn’t talk about it with anyone else, he’d even stopped talking to Tom about it, since he’d become clear they would never see eye to eye about these issues. Maybe it was because of the generational gap, after all, in Tom’s time it was very much likely even less of an acceptable thing to be queer, in any way shape or form. Draco wondered what he’d make of Pansy.
“It almost happened.” Anthony had confessed quietly to Draco on their way out of the class. “Last year, I left my broom in the garden for a minute while I went to get a glass of water, and she grabbed it, she wanted to try it. Next thing we knew, she was fifteen feet high and screaming and letting go of the handle to cover her eyes.” He had a full-body shiver. “My dad floated her to the ground, but if he hadn’t been close enough… I’ve never been so scared in my life.”
He set out to find at least one of them, Hermione preferably since he still felt the urge to check on her, so he decided to start with the library – Hal was at Quidditch practice, which was presumably where Ron and Anthony would be as well, cheering him on. Neville would probably be in the greenhouse – Sprout had asked for volunteers to help her monitor (and Draco suspected, guard) the mandrakes round the clock, and Nev had been more than happy to take a shift. So, left to her own devices, Draco would have placed a large bet on Hermione having headed for the library.
you.”
“What?”
“Tell me more.” He smirked. “Who is she?”
Hagrid nodded, his eyes filled with tears again, and waved at them – with the hand that was no longer holding the dog – as they walked away.
Sirius looked appalled. Hal raised an eyebrow.
“Oh, darling.” She pushed him back after a bit. “Let me look at you. You’re so tall!”
“No, it doesn’t.” Hal laughed. “But it looks like my aunt and Draco’s mom bonded over our sorry arses in the infirmary and now they’re friends? Draco said his mom is coming around on the whole Muggle thing, apparently. She has a sister who married a Muggle, needless to say she hasn’t spoken to her since, but now she’s decided to reach out. Draco’s cousin goes to Uni in France, she’s twenty, so they suggested to meet there, and I think Narcissa is terrified to face them on her own, so she invited us along.”
“GRYFFINDORS, WITH ME!”
“It’s barely eight.” He pointed out to Hal. “I’m up. This is my birthday present to you.”
“You, will, be, fine.” He insisted. “Harry, I may have just started school here, but I know the Gryffindor team inside and out, alright? Charlie was Seeker before you, he was Captain for the past two years, Fred and George are Beaters for the second year now, this is literally
Draco froze mid laugh when Flint and two of his mates entered the common room. He tried to make himself smaller under the green blanket Blaise had thrown over his shoulders at some point (because the dungeons were bloody
As they made their way out of his office and through the Defence classroom, Lupin placed a hand on Hal’s shoulder.
He didn’t. He stumbled out of a fireplace, and quickly realised it couldn’t have been much worse as he recognised Filch’s office. He had never been in there, but the three taxidermied cats in pride of place on the mantelpiece, surrounding a large photo of a snarling Mrs Norris, kind of gave it away.
“I was so scared.” The wretched-looking man whimpered. “So scared… I had to protect myself. Sirius, he-”
“Oh, Merlin.” Remus breathed.
They took their leave not long after that, and walked back in thoughtful silence, but upon re-entering the castle, Hal nudged Draco.
“Okay…” Hal raised a brow. “Well, she knows where to find us. I’m off, see you guys in a bit.”
On that front, there were two particularly popular theories, both of which explained why people were turning to stare at Hal in the corridors and whispering behind his back – this had happened before, at the start of first year when everyone was excited to see the Harry Potter they’d heard so much about, and again in the last few days of last term after Hal’s little stint with Quirrell, but it felt a little darker this time around.
The few scattered groups around the Hall gathered up, and when he had people’s attention, the boy carried on in a voice that was only half steady.
Flipping through the notebook, Draco was disappointed to see it was completely empty. Its dark leather cover did not bear any inscription other than the embossed name and address of the store it had been purchased in, and apart from a very faded name inside (T or J… M… Pridle? Rifle?), there were no notes at all on the yellowed paper.
“Cool.” Hal commented. “Well, hope it goes well.”
“Acromantula.”
“We are not keeping it.” Petunia sighed. “We can take care of it properly.”
more confused than when he’d first entered the room.
“Actually, I wanted to ask.” Hal remembered. “While we’re here, or maybe before I get the train back, could we go to Diagon Alley? I’ve been given a special dispensation to get my own broomstick, since I’m in the squad. I’ll pay for it with the wizard money, it’s not a problem.”
“Just tell him you like him.” Pan insisted. “You can make it sound like it’s not such a big deal, it’s up to you. But honestly, Draco, if I have to look at the pining for Merlin knows how much longer…”
Hermione opened her mouth to say something, but then her mouth just hanged open, not a sound coming out, her eyes widening.
“Oh, shit.” Ron breathed helpfully.
“Please don’t.” Ron insisted.
The rain didn’t let up, but just as Pan was psyching himself up to get back to his feet and go, before his charms wore off and he had to walk back with a heavy trunk this time, he could hear cheerful chatter, and soon enough, a group of people came into view. Pan recognised Anthony, holding a little girl by the hand who was bouncing up and down beside him. Their parents walked behind them, wands up and holding a water-repellent charms over everyone’s heads.
“He freaked out.” Nev said. “He only latched onto you because you were there.”
Anthony took a moment to think.
This way, he would even have his previous spot in his line of vision, which Hal thought was probably a good idea for a while. He nudged him to a table in the second row and sat with him. Neville took a few deep breaths, but other than that, he looked determined to just get through the class, and he asked Hal to stop looking at him like he was about to fall apart, assuring him that his dread was no higher than what he usually experienced when faced with a new potion to brew.
“Hi, darling.” She picked up, sounding happy to hear him.
(See the end of the chapter for
They both sat, and looked at Pansy, waiting for her to speak. After a couple of minutes she sighed, straightened up, and gestured at herself.
Draco liked ending on a positive note – he scampered. He didn’t really have time to go for any lunch anymore, but he reckoned he could nick some scones from Ron – he always grabbed extra for later, the greedy git. Hollow legs, though, he was a proper beanstalk, towering over the lot of them.
Or, he could ask one of his friends if there was any chance he could stay with them over Easter. That, however, would imply telling them
Hal had also had a fairly standard Muggle Christmas, with some little injections of magic – he’d gotten his Aunt bath bombs from Diagon Alley again, because she had absolutely loved them the year before, and a box of Chocolate frogs had entertained him and Ley for hours as they watched Little Silver try to catch them – and had to promptly run after him and take it away if he did trap one, because they had unknowingly let him eat one, and it had
“Maybe.” Hal conceded.
“What? Why?”
“Well, yes, but I thought the reference to Merlin was more adequate. You know they use Merlin’s name like we say
*             *
Hal had cleared a shelf in his room to lay out all their notes and small gifts, from the first ones they’d all sent over with his stuff when he was still at the hospital. It reminded him daily that he was home safe, and that he’d be back at school soon and be safe there, surrounded by people who loved him in both cases. It kept him sane. After all, though that sounded a bit sad, he’d been through this before, he knew he’d be fine in a while – though he wondered, sometimes, if PTSD was cumulative.
.” Draco pointed out coldly. “And I’m a Malfoy, which does still mean something when it comes to my word, thank you very much.”
“Harry James Potter!” Petunia called out sternly.
That was the date that had been set for the start of the trial, and therefore the date they’d decided to go for their school shopping as well.
“Oh, hey.” Dora suddenly said in a tone that was much lighter, albeit a little forced. “You also got a letter, Draco.”
Hal shook his head, still looking miserable though he had minutely perked up.
“That does not change the fact that these
“What is she talking about?” He appealed to him, knowing he would put it in simpler words.
in another kettle of Grindylows.”
“Guys.” Ron intervened again, and since last time he had used that voice, they were about to get their heads bitten off by a giant dog, they all fell quiet and turned to him.
“Come along.” She instructed.
They talked for almost hour, about one stupid thing after another, until Dean asked if he was going to go to bed anytime soon because some people were trying to sleep. Hal complied, but he could not get to sleep. He tried, he did, but he still felt too excited from the afternoon fooling around and from his chat with Ley, so in the end he gave up. He picked up his glasses, pulled on some socks, grabbed the cloak, and went for a wander. He had a few theories he wanted to test.
“But yeah, I’ve finished it.” Draco added.
“It’s alright.” Mr Tienman confirmed. “We might as well make the most of this nice weather, who knows how long it’ll last!”
“Ley and I always dress up together and make a crazy night of it. It’s going to be weird not doing anything with him this year.”
“You’re brave and you stand up for what is right.” She told him. “You protect your friends. That’s worth a little bit of trouble.”
Anthony and Pan exchanged a look – that wasn’t quite true, they weren’t exactly the best example of how the Houses treated each other, but it was probably best not to get into that. Over lunch, Pan got to learn a lot more about the Goldsteins. They were lovely people, for one, unquestioningly welcoming even though Anthony hadn’t repeated to them what had brought Pan to their door. There had been Muggles in their family across the generations, and while it was rare among Wizards to practice religion, that was one of the reasons the Jewish traditions had been passed on, as well as the habit of going to the Synagogue. That was where Anthony’s father had met his mother.
Draco threw a leg over the broom when he reached him, and waited for the other boy’s arms to be securely clasped around his waist before he kicked the ground, moving away from the bloody plant swiftly. He only slowed down right up to the trap door, listening for any sound of trouble, but all he could hear was a soft flute tune, so he flew them through.
“All the Houses are good.” Hal tried to temper. “I’ve got friends in all of them.”
“I know.” Hal said. “But before.”
“I’m not sure that is a good idea.”
“Also, there were a few times over the summer. Like, at Harry’s place, I thought you were kiiind of staring at his brother and sister.”
“Well, if we’re friends, I guess you’ll need to get to know my other friends.” He said like it wasn’t a big deal.
Warning for blood and injury in this chapter.
It didn’t seem to do anything to lessen Oliver’s intensity, but it did mean the rest of the team tended to look at each other and try not to laugh during his speech, rather than nod gravely and run through tactics in their heads. Not that the Ravenclaws weren’t a threat – but the style of play was always more relaxed, and less prone to injury than playing Slytherin or even Hufflepuff (who had a competitive streak a mile long rooted in not wanting to disappoint each other). It made Oliver’s
“I hope you’re not trying to matchmake me right now.” Draco frowned, uncomfortable.
Pan frowned. “How do you know?”
“They must be with Anthony.” Ron stated, already helping himself to the food.
. Nobody had really noticed, carrying on with the conversation, but Draco had slipped away as soon as he inconspicuously could to get to the diary.
“I appreciate the sentiment.” Pan smiled. He glanced over at Draco. “But I don’t think people should have to say anything if they’re not ready.”
The first thing he saw was the photo, lying on top, and he understood why this wasn’t given to him before this particular birthday. The magically enhanced picture was moving in a loop, his parents waving and blowing kisses at him. His throat felt tight. It made them look so much more real than all the photos he’d seen of his mom before.
“Professor Lockhart, what drove you to such a selfless act? And Mister Potter, do you feel grateful that a Professor of such influence as Professor Lockhart would personally accompany you?”
She said she appreciated the company of people who’d picked up a book in their life of their own volition – by which she meant Draco mostly, but the others seemed to be okay by association. She used that word,
“First of, his name is Hal.” Draco started defensively.
“Just.” Anthony sighed. “Apologise. It’ll be fine.”
He recognised several of the Weasleys, and a few Slytherins he’d met at one gathering or another. He saw some teens that were clearly couples, including two Hufflepuff boys holding hands, which made him feel a little jolt of… something. He spotted his godfather sitting with the other teachers, looking immensely bored. Severus had already warned him he would be showing no favouritism towards him, and he’d better make him proud in Potions. Draco wasn’t too worried. He liked the idea of brewing potions, and he didn’t think he’d be bad at it. Plus, he knew the man played at being mean, but actually had a real soft spot for him.
“Well.” Ron said after they’d discussed names – to no serious result – for a while. “Thank you, Pan.”
“You know, Malfoy, I read some interesting things about you.” Flint said. “My mother sent me this article about eligible bachelors, and you are in the list of good matches to watch out for in the next few years – they had to include the babies like you since they’re all in a tizzy about precious Potter starting school.”
“Tried to snog it, more like.” George (maybe Fred) added, clasping his other shoulder. “Nice rodeo up there, buddy.”
Anthony laughed, mirroring Pan’s head-shake, then changed the subject.
Hal shrugged. “I think we found each other. I’m as lucky as he is.”
Anthony still patted his arm comfortingly.
And he wouldn’t even count the twins as one, because Mrs Weasley had made them
“No, they’re real.” Draco explained. “They’re a submissive species, they serve Wizarding houses and families. We have a few, I don’t know them all to be honest. Dilly is in the kitchen, and… well, Dobby. You call him when you want something.”
“Something’s happened.” Anthony whispered.
Hal could understand why this was Draco’s favourite place, because it was amazing. He had led them to the East wing, on the second floor, into at small library with floor-to-ceiling shelves full of beautifully bound books, and Hal had thought that was the place, it was cosy and homey and more
“He’s been
McGonagall started by casting a series of spells at the dormitory's door – she did not explain them, but Hal could guess they were meant to ensure nobody could escape, be it a rat or a man. She and Dumbledore then both made their way into the room, which did not go unnoticed. Whether he hadn't actually been sleeping or was stirred by the sound of their steps, the rat squealed and skipped off the bed, immediately scuttling towards the door. He didn't make it, as McGonagall's next spell his him square in the bottom.
Draco turned to him with slightly wide eyes. “You think so?”
“Sorry.” He blurted out. “I need some air.”
Some of the flavours were the same, and others were local and met more or less of a success – fresh baguette, croissant and macaron and most of the pâtisserie flavours among the best rated by all three boys, “oil paint” and “cigarette butt” among the worst, while savoury flavours like onion soup, snails in garlic butter and boeuf bourgignon divided them (Draco thought they were lovely, Hal and Ley thought they were just weird). All three of them were more intrigued than delighted by the cheese and wine flavours, figuring they were maybe more adult tastes. They did not even discuss “French kiss”.
Draco had been a little wary, at first, that the speculations would lead Hal to start wondering about the rest of their group and who they each might have a crush on, but it quickly became clear he had no interest in steering away from what, Draco suspected, they both saw as a safe subject of conversation. Kept them away from all the uncomfortable ones, and it really was good fun.
And his mother had taught him throughout his childhood to
Or, apparently, Hal would shove him suddenly and with surprising force into the nearest pinball machine. Petunia rushed forward and held him back before his raised fist made contact with the boy’s face.
“Gregory.” He greeted. “Did you have a good summer?”
With that he artfully managed to take both sides and neither, Hal noticed. There was something very aristocratic about that – then again, he supposed the Malfoys
“What the hell.” He told Draco once they were outside. “What am I supposed to do with that information?”
Just as if he hadn’t endangered the life of a student (again), Lockhart started making shepherding movements towards the students saying “Come now, come now, give him space” cheerfully, while Hooch crouched next to Hal to start stemming the blood flow.
They’d made it – just – and endured double potions with Slytherin. Hal tried to see Snape in a different light knowing he was Draco’s godfather, he really did, but it was very hard when the man sneered at him whenever he looked in his general direction, belittled Neville constantly and almost rolled his eyes every time Hermione gave a right answer. He wondered if whatever Draco could say to him would really make a difference, but it could hardly be much worse anyway. Which was a shame, because Hal actually quite liked potions, in theory.
The whole group turned as one, and the Hufflepuff boy that had called out Hal’s name looked a little startled, but he looked straight at him – obviously he didn’t need Hal to answer or confirm his identity.
“Oh, hello Professor Lupin.” He greeted the man when he’d identified him.
“You need to eat, my precious boy.” She cooed. “This is nice cinnamon porridge.”
“Murderer!”
Draco helped Hal up, and they followed her through the bustling crowd of Diagon Alley shoppers until they reached Gringotts.
Petunia nodded defeatedly. Marge never went anyway without one of the beasts – and really, Petunia didn’t have anything against bulldogs at large, but Marge always seemed to bread the nastiest creatures. She always made some excuse regarding why she just couldn’t have left this or that one with her neighbour with the others.
“Aren’t we waiting for Ley for presents?” He frowned.
Petunia was starting to wonder what on earth had possessed her, and how she had come to think trying to teach two twelve year-old boys how to cook was a good idea.
Potter did not smile – Severus had not really intended his vague attempt at humour to have that effect anyway – but he nodded his head gravely.
“Bad dream?” Draco asked.
“Ah, so you agree that-”
“I promise I won’t try to fix this myself.” He promised.
It was also an extremely weird sensation, feeling your limbs grow and your chest expand, feeling your features change. Draco didn’t think he liked that very much. Before long, they were six adults looking at each other with various expressions of mirth and confusion.
“Not neat.” Anthony breathed out, scrambling for Hal’s sleeve and pulling him back.
“What?” Hal started.
“You have done this.” The raspy sound rose again. “Now you will help me return to my former glory.”
have done all these terrible things people said he had.
A few steps away from the barrier, Ley shouted behind him.
Anthony looked like he wanted to argue, but in the end he shook his head.
“I can’t say I like this new tradition.” She joked, though it fell a little flat.
“Will you be back for Ley’s birthday?” Hal nevertheless kept worrying.
“Now that you mention it.” She said thoughtfully. “You do look a lot like those pictures of your father.”
They were both humouring him, as they had done countless time when he’d been younger. But this wasn’t a childish joke.
Draco volunteered to go and find Hermione, who hadn’t had a chance to join them at the stadium, but then she’d probably have expected them to be down there for a good few hours. He ran into her on his way to the library.
“My parents went there.” He answered. “But they, hum, they died.”
“Well.” Hal mumbled. “Everyone was looking at you.”
) as she waved her wand again, over him this time. He felt the pressure beneath his temples ease up a little. Not much, but it was something.
“Of course.” Sev nodded.
“What have you done.” McGonagall sighed to the remaining group.
The most stink eye he got was from Marcus Flint, and Hal could guess it was for entirely different reasons. It was actually hard to tell, when the older boy glared at him from a distance, if he was planning some kind of revenge, or if he was somehow scared of him, either because he’d been taken down a peg by Hal’s promise that he
“Class.” Hermione rolled her eyes, and strode off.
“Oh, mate!” Ron exclaimed.
“Mighty Morgana.” He swore. “What the fuck, Draco?”
“You had a sword.” Anthony repeated.
“Then I will still help you.” Severus committed. “Potion-based transition has been proven to be the safest method, especially if started early, and because of that there are dispensations under which you can consent to it yourself from the age of thirteen, even without the approval of a parent or guardian. As an accredited Potion Master I can administer the treatment, but we do have to make an application to the Ministry so I can do this legally. You will need to provide two character-reference from people close to you – this can be friends or family – and have a guarantor for the supervision of the treatment – this can be me, if…”
By lunchtime, Hal was officially the new Gryffindor Seeker, and the youngest Quidditch player in a century.
“Dobby.” Draco said, inexplicably, until a second later a little creature appeared with a loud crack.
“If it makes you feel better.” Draco said. “Most people know about me too.”
“Well done then, my Hal.” She said fondly.
Draco could only smile back helplessly.
He frowned even harder. “I thought her name was Elisa.”
The other boy leaned into his space. “Or what?”
But in spite of what he’d told his friends, he didn’t think it had been a ghost. And, and that was probably the most upsetting thing about it all, Hal couldn’t help but recall the last time he’d heard a hissing voice, a slithering tone that made a chill creep up his spine. He had never told his friends, or even his family, but he’d been having nightmares since the previous year’s encounter. More than once, he’d dreamt of trying to escape black hands that would harm him if they touched him, while a hissing voice ordered
Hesitantly, Petunia reached out, and placed her hand on Narcissa’s where it was resting on her lap.
He said this last part to Ron, and watched as his face twisted into a grimace of pure disgust.
“Also…” George hesitated. “We think you probably wouldn’t have failed Ron the way we did on this one.”
Hal tuned out to the rest of the discussion about which team was more deserving, since his friends they would end up agreeing exactly never, and caught himself thinking he’d have loved for someone to be filming all this, so he could show his aunt and Ley back at home. Maybe next year, he should try to find someone who owned a video camera – surely some of the Muggleborns in Hogwarts did – and ask them if he could borrow it. Petunia would be horrified and find it extremely dangerous, no doubt, but Ley would love it.
“We were only meant to be there for like ten minutes!” He moaned. “There might not be-”
“You’re boring, Zabini.” Pansy decided, and she got up and left, taking Daphne with her.
“But it’s horrible.” Hal blurted out, feeling distraught at the thought that he could have never met Draco.
“Sorry, Hermione, but I can’t say I’m disappointed that that particular logic was shot down.” Hal patted her arm.
“Fat lot of good it did them the first time.” Hal grunted.
Anthony smirked at her. “You just can’t stand not knowing something, can you?”
“I’ll go first.” She announced. “Draco, make sure our guests are alright? You can come last.”
“But.” Hal grinned, shoving his cousin so he’d look up at him again. “I brought you some chocolate frogs.”
“Not that school was boring before you came along.” George started.
The scene that followed, true to Hermione’s warning, was extremely uncomfortable indeed. Peeves abandoned them with the poor girl after insulting her, leaving her wailing in distress, and they had the hardest time trying to convince her that her glasses did not make her face look fat and that of course there were people who liked her.
“I didn’t think I’d say this, ever.” Draco commented lightly. “But I’m starting to miss the giant initial.”
“It means get off my face.” Flint asserted wittingly.
“I didn’t mean to upset him.” Hal murmured contritely.
He said this cautiously, like even just suggesting it might make Draco kick off again.
This, he thought, would at least made it plausible that he had indeed spoken to Sirius. He would have been unlikely to know the term otherwise. Draco hadn’t used it when he’d told him about his godfather in the first place, Hal wasn’t sure he knew it.
Ron laughed as he got not one, but two portable wizard chess sets, one from Anthony and one from Hal, though the latter was made of chocolate. Hermione got him
“Sev!” He called, feeling relief flood him.
“And you believe him.” Hermione said at the end, less a question than an observation, but with something between sceptical and slightly judgmental in the tone of her voice.
Draco thought congratulations were in order, ludicrous as the whole thing had been, and he was on his way up to his room to fetch a box of dark chocolate honeycomb – his mother had sent him that, and he loved the treats, he’d been saving them for a special occasion, and… well, giving them to Hal in those circumstances seemed like a special enough occasion – when he ran into a group of Slytherins.
He did give his Auntie a hug, and tried to pretend he didn’t feel a little tug of nervousness at the thought of not seeing them both again till Christmas.
“Well, you’re only kids.” Dora winced. “Underage witnesses are more easily made to look unreliable.”
“Be safe.” He told him.
Somehow, the words still had the old magic they had held since they were four years old, and they stopped fighting in favour of jumping up and down, both beaming, talking excitedly over each other in a jumble of questions and anecdotes that definitely would need the rest of the holiday to unravel properly.
“What about them?” Pan deferred cautiously.
“I think I would be a nice stepmother.” Luna simply mused, sending everyone back into fits of hilarity.
“I want to go home.” Hal let out, not sure if the raw honesty was going to work to sway her, or only appear weak. At this point, either way, his bravado was slipping.
Hermione sighed. “What a…”
“Yeah.” Pan snorted. “The rate he’s going…”
“Association with the Dark Lord didn’t go down well, after the war ended. Quite a few people were tried and condemned. My mother’s sister and her husband are in Azkaban too.”
“This will mean more letters for me, I hope.” She replied. “I know the school owls are not always available.”
Narcissa looked up again, giving her a small smile.
McGonagall seemed to hesitate, looking at the five of them, but in the end she sighed.
“What’s the worst that can happen?”
Draco seemed satisfied with his purchases as well, and he looked happy enough that Hal decided to stop worrying about the bruise – he’d tried to pry a truthful answer out of him a few times, because he didn’t believe he’d just tripped and fallen flat on his face, he had more poise than that, but Draco wouldn’t give away anything. He didn’t seem to be afraid of going back home with his mother, at any rate, so Hal supposed it was good enough for now.
“You could have told me.” Ley sounded a bit put out.
“I know.” Hal sniffed. “I’m sorry.”
They talked for another few minutes before a Healer came in, and gently started ushering them out. They promised Neville to write, then they promised each other to write too as they said goodbye in front of the hospital, ready to each go their separate ways. Ron and Hermione found Mrs Weasley, Anthony’s dad was up front, and Draco, Blaise and Pansy followed Hal down to the Leaky Cauldron to Floo from there.
“Run away, probably. Are you?”
with the creatures as a younger kid, and it had come to nobody’s surprise when he’d been accepted for a job in a dragon sanctuary before he’d even received his NEWTs results.
“Yes, it is.” Hal said softly.
“Right?” Hermione took that as him siding with her. “So what if your dad, Hal, and his friends, became Animagi for him?”
can manage it.” She sniffed.
“Takes one to know one.” The woman winked. “Although your boys look quite tame.”
“He can’t do things half-way, that boy.” Hal’s aunt added, sounding a little amused, though Draco could hear the strain of her voice.
“But tomorrow is a Hogsmead weekend.” Fred, or George, continued. “We’re not going, but the rest of the team will be gallivanting away. Do you guys want to fill in?”
“That’s alright.” Hal said wryly. “It’s not like I’d been expecting a secret cousin hidden away somewhere.”
“Here, eat some of this.”
The pain shot up immediately, and Hal cried out in agony, jerking his arm away from the collapsing beast. But it was too late, he realised upon seeing the broken off fang stick out of his forearm, the veins already blackening around the puncture wound. Though the Basilisk was slayed, it was only a matter of moments until Hal would be as dead as it was.
“Ninety-six.” Anthony shrugged. “Don’t let that fool you, he’s as sharp as a hippogriff’s beak. Anyway, we asked him what creature he thought could petrify people, animals and ghosts, but he’d never heard of anything like that. He thought maybe something related to a Gorgon, but he didn’t think it fit the profile. Then there’s animals with venoms with a paralytic effect, but he said they wouldn’t be rigid like that, nor, well, alive.” He winced. “If it was something like that, the heart muscles would have been reached eventually too, and they’d be dead. Unless it’s combined with a stasis spell or something like that, but then we’re back to why we ruled out curses and potions in the first place: Dumbledore or Snape would have found an antidote by now.”
“AH!” Seamus screamed a second later, just as the room filled with several other cries and gasps. “Feck, bloody hell, mate, why would you do that? Scared the shite outa me, you did!”
He needed to tell someone about this. This was bad. Draco went to grab his bag, did not bother getting changed out of his muddy Quidditch kit, and went straight for his room. He didn’t know what he would have done if Anthony had been there, if things would have spilled out, but as it were, the room was empty, and Draco reached for the diary. Tom would listen. Tom wouldn’t judge. Tom would reassure him, and tell him what to do.
“I’d show you a good time if you were in Slytherin.”
He started writing hoping for a little comfort from Tom, but Tom seemed to be angry.
“You barely have an accent.” Hal added, looking impressed.
. We know it’s not true, mate. I told Hal maybe we should wait for you to be ready to tell us, but if this is getting worse…”
“Err, yeah.” He answered, flustered.
She glossed over the fact that she had turned a deaf ear to whatever Lily was saying about it at the time, so she didn’t know much more than that.
“Mate, what happened?” Ron asked him when Hal came out of the room.
“What do you need, my love?”
“I’ve been thinking about that.” Draco confessed. “Things might get a bit… reckless, around here, but there still must be a reason why that thing is inside the school.”
“Pansy.” He sighed. “I’m not saying I would.”
One was from the
Before Hal could argue – that he was being ridiculous, presumably – Draco pulled out his wand.
Draco looked surprised for a second, before a small smile danced on his lips.
He pressed the heels of both palms against his eyes, only to resist the urge to start clawing at his scar, as if Voldemort’s next manifestation would come from there. It was as likely as anything, at this point. It had flared when he’d destroyed the diary, and maybe it had gone slightly unnoticed in the grand scheme of things, but it had felt sensitive since. Raw. Not painful exactly, but in a way that made it hard to just forget about it. Hal wanted it off his face, though he knew that wasn’t going to happen.
“He said he thought there was something between us. That we seemed a bit closer than with the rest of the group.”
“I’ve not done anything.” Hal muttered, feeling mortifyingly like he wanted to cry.
“But-”
He tried to remember if he’d heard or read anything about phoenix tears – he vaguely though Snape might have mentioned it in relation to poison antidotes – but he was drained and unable to get his thoughts in order. It hardly seemed to matter, anyway. If he wasn’t dying anymore, then he needed to get himself and Draco out of here before something else happened. For all he knew, the Chamber was spelled to self-destruct or something.
“Well, I'm sure it's a coincidence.” Hal flushed. “But we were talking the other day and...” He shook his head. “Never mind.”
“All I give you is trouble.” Hal still seemed inconsolable.
At least this time they didn’t seem interested in throwing the contents of his bag onto the floor to trample it, which Draco was grateful for, because he has
She showed her Hal and Ley, making an enormous racket at the other side of the room, playfully shoving each other around the machine, sharing the commands and shouting really loudly every time (presumably) something happened in the game.
“At the moment, your rat is bigger than my kitten.” Hal pointed out. “You keep
“Next time.” Draco said with conviction.
Hal did just that for a long few minutes. Neville angled his head to look out the window, giving him time and space. Eventually Hal felt himself calm down, and as he let out a big sigh, the other boy turned back to him.
The floor was slippery, and he skidded to his knees next to Draco, keeping his eyes downcast and carefully away from the reflective surface of the water puddles, as his first thought was that Draco had been petrified. But his skin was soft and his hand limp when Hal grabbed his arm. But he was so cold, and for a terrifying second, Hal thought he might be dead, until he felt a pulse. It was slow, however, and his breathing shallow, and Hal couldn’t help but feel the pinprick of tears at the back of his eyes.
“L’autre c’est Draco Malfoy. Le plus blond. T’sais, il était dans le magazine aussi, sur la liste des meilleurs partis.”
constantly checking on where Draco was in a room. Not that it was a challenge – Draco seemed to be sticking to him more than before too, always picking the seat next to him or standing as close as casually possible. It wasn’t weird – but it was like their shared ordeal had created a bond between them, which felt more comfortable when it wasn’t taut, as if they were tied by an elastic string. The others didn’t seem to mind, in spite of Hermione’s comment – they’d noticed, but they didn’t mind. If anything, they seemed to understand. They knew there were elements of the story the two boys hadn’t told them, parts of what had happened that would be giving them nightmares for a while and that maybe they would never share. It was okay, they wouldn’t push – trauma was a delicate thing.
“Late morning.” Ron was the one to answer. “When we walked to Hogsmead, he was meeting Sirius.”
Petunia did not seem to think it was that cool. “Didn’t you say first years couldn’t try out?” She reminded him.
wasn’t exactly sorting that for you.” Hal pointed out, a little miffed at Draco’s tone.
“RAVENCLAW!”
To be fair, Draco loved the kitten too. It might have had something to do with the favouritism the feline showed towards him – apart from Hal, if anyone tried to pet him, they’d probably end up mauled. Draco, however, seemed to have earned the privilege of being able to scratch him under his neck without losing a finger.
“Oh, so do you apparently.” Anthony quipped before turning to her. “Second cousin. And yes, I mean, his name is Rolf
“Overdid it somewhat?” Hal suggested playfully.
“Or?”
“No, it’s fine.” Draco mumbled. “I don’t mind. I never… Nobody’s ever given me a nickname, is all. It’s odd. I suppose you’re used to it.”
“You were late for class, Mister Potter.” He said a tad more coldly, though still smiling – as if it hadn’t been his responsibility to get him here on time. “Now, we wouldn’t want Gryffindor to lose points so early in the year, would we?”
world, and she would not have her children tagged up as weirdos.
“It’s not.” Draco countered. “I-” He took a breath, and released it with his next words. “I like boys.”
“No, no, this is all me. I’ll tell her about it of course, but… Look, I don’t know if you know, but the wizarding world right now is… not good.”
“My reflection, it’s a mirror.” Hal said drily.
and he’s thoroughly obsessed with magical creatures.” He pointed out. “Did you only just ask yourself that? I thought you were the smart one.”
Anthony had a little smile. “You know my mom’s a Muggle, right?”
“Albeit in a certainly twisted way, Mister Potter.” She commented eventually, sounding bemused. “You are a very lucky boy.”
“No, alright, I’m sorry.” Pan whispered back. “I didn’t mean to say that. But you can’t force me to tell them either.”
Next thing he knew, he was falling down the stairs.
Draco didn’t answer, he only gave a small, noncommittal shrug, and Hal noticed the dark circles beneath his eyes, and started kicking himself. Draco wouldn’t have had to tell him if he’d bloody
“Did he just-”
“How was your day?”
Of course, nothing Hal did or didn’t do the next day made any difference. People were whispering behind his back with renewed energy, regardless of if they thought he was or wasn’t the Heir – and his little animal language performance at the Duelling Club seemed to have swayed the balance for the former.
*             *
Petunia wasn’t sure what this was about, but she wasn’t sure she wanted to know either.
His inner Hermione shrieked.
He should have taken Blaise’s advice, and do it just before the start of term. Blaise’s mother was always hosting parties and, according to Blaise, having
“We’re certainly wondering.” Hermione shrugged. “Aren’t you?”
Pan rolled her eyes. “I said I have
“There are potions.” Severus confirmed carefully. “It’s a commitment. You’d have to start taking them, well, pretty soon, the ideal start for the therapy is at the time of…”
“I really love it.” Hal confessed. “It sucks that I won’t be able to practice over the summer though.”
He’d never have to do this alone.
He had received a letter from his mother, which he’d read the previous night before bed. It wasn’t a long one, but there had been so many untold things in there, reading between the lines, and he’d realised he’d forgotten the anniversary of his father’s death. His mother always fell into a state of deep melancholy around the date, and usually Draco did his best to cheer her up or distract her, but this year he wasn’t there. Not only that, but he’d gone and forgotten, not even sending her an owl to support her. The guilt had made him toss and turn for hours before he could find sleep.
as the dwarf sat on his legs and started singing what was essentially a love song, except a truly awful one, written by someone who was either determined to make his life miserable, or who really had an awful taste in rhymes and simile. Not to mention
It was not a good night for Hal. It had been late by the time he’d gone to bed, after facing Hermione’s disapproval at how he’d flouted the rules, her and Ron’s relief that they were all okay, Neville’s minor freak out even though all danger was over now, and the rest of Gryffindor’s eagerness to hear all about his facedown with the troll. He felt exhausted by the end of it all, and was pretty much dead to the world as soon as his head hit the pillow.
Ley humphed, and Petunia ruffled Hal’s hair.
“We’ll sit with him.” Narcissa said smoothly.
Hal, be careful what you wish for...
“Possibly.” Snape said shortly. “However, under
“That’s what friends do.” Anthony shrugged. “You’d have gone to him if he hadn’t been in another country.”
, and everything that came with it, but also from what Narcissa had written to her mom about him. Draco appeared to have him and a large group of friends by his side at Hogwarts, good on him, and Harry sounded like a feisty, brave, reckless kid, who wasn’t quite done defying expectations and facing off He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. It was all very impressive, for a little boy.
“Mistress.” One of the House-elves appeared with a crack in Narcissa’s drawing room, where she was reading while waiting for her guests. “Mister Sirius Black is arrived, Mistress.”
“Miss Brown.”
“I fell.” She said eventually.
“Oh, so it could be either?” Sirius continued teasing.
“Is everyone- Hal, you’re the one who almost got killed!” Hermione berated him. Her concern clearly was already fading in front of the opportunity to give him a lecture.
at Christmas? All piled up on the boy who was one of the most famous wizards alive, it seemed too much to be a simple coincidence.
– he still was rather intimidating at least in terms of his size.
“Auntie, you okay?” Harry broke her out of her reverie. He was a very intuitive kid, Petunia had noticed. Not the most academic, going by his school grades (though a lot of that could be due to his and Ley’s constant goofing around) but he was perceptive and quick to react. She thought he’d probably make a good policeman, or detective. She wondered if the magical world had an equivalent.
Severus scoffed. “Trust me. I spent enough time in James Potter’s unfortunate vicinity.”
He caught Hal into a headlock and they wrestled for a few minutes, Petunia looking on fondly, until she told them: “Alright, you both win.”
“I don’t know if these things are hereditary.”
“Well, knowing didn’t help.” Hermione sighed. “Still got myself petrified. Hal was the one who saved the day, so it’s fair.”
What sucked even more is that Lockhart had apparently claimed Hal’s detention for his own, and whatever he had in store for him, Hal really wasn’t looking forward to spending his Saturday evening in the idiot’s company. Which was why he was there moping in the common room, feeling immensely sorry for himself, looking at the clock moving closer and closer to his doom.
Without waiting for an answer, she came in, pulling someone else after her – a blond girl, looking around dreamily, with something blue and gooey in her hair and dripping onto her shoulder and down her arm.
At the end of the day, they were absolutely knackered, and they treated themselves to what Hal thought was a very-well deserved sundae in the ice cream parlour. They both had several bags full of their shopping, including a brand new broomstick for Hal, and sod it, he’d gone for the latest release Nimbus 2000, because he might as well use some of that money he had too much of.
“Could be.” Hermione nodded, in a way that indicated quite clearly that theory had been thought of, analysed and dismissed already. “But I’ve checked all those dates.”
“His mother had a town house in London too, anyway.” Draco added. “So if the outcome is that the Ministry has to give him back everything they seized back when he was arrested, he’ll probably chose to move in there rather than the seaside, I reckon.”
“His Boggart is you.” Draco interrupted him to reveal.
He trailed off, but he was sure he’d gotten his meaning across. While his account of the kidnapping probably hadn’t warranted immediate action as long as he was out of harm’s way, it was a whole different matter if there were potentially more children in there with a clearly unstable, drug-happy woman.
“Will you change your name?”
“And it will happen again!” Hal pointed out. “What even… Do you know how big these things grow?”
“Don’t move?” Draco snapped. “Sure, I’ll just lie here and die then!”
“Get Madam Pomfrey.” Hooch barked at Katie, while pushing Lockhart aside unceremoniously. “Now!”
“What have you done?” Severus urged them.
“Hold on.” George took out his wand and tapped it to the parchment. “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
“Sorry.” Hal intervened. “Did you mother tell you bedside stories that were essentially about genocide?”
Draco looked down, and when it was clear he wasn’t going to say anything – if he tried to speak, he suspected he would cry – Neville and Hermione left, leaving him with Anthony. He remained silent for a moment, before he spoke quietly.
than it had been the first time. Definitely not as bad as during the party. Anthony opened his mouth again, but Draco stopped him before he could speak.
“Tell us what?”
“Yeah, I ditched them.” She shrugged. “Greg has apparently decided to just be gross, and Daphne is being
“I can hear Ron’s stomach rumbling.”
“Quirrell tried to kill Hal again.” Draco spilled out, seeing the confusion his words caused on Sev’s face. “The he went after whatever the dog is guarding, and it couldn’t be good, so we went after him, and I came back out to find you, and Neville is going to, but the others are…”
It was her father who had placed her hand on her shoulder.
Hal’s brow furrowed, and he turned to Draco.
“Not really.” Hal repeated, more softly, as he felt himself starting to calm down. “It was Draco, right?” He asked, more to engage with the boy than because he wasn’t sure.
“Of course, my dear Harry, you would like to share your story!” Lockhart said enthusiastically. “Tell them how thrilled you are at the prospect of your Defence classes this year.”
Draco glanced at his mother and refrained from rolling his eyes. She had been
“If that is all?” The judge added.
“Not really.” Hal huffed a joyless laugh.
Him and Hermione proceeded in trying to get neared the front of the queue, Lockhart’s works under their arm for signing – at least, Hal thought, they weren’t buying them just for the sake of an autograph, since they were indeed on their school supply list. In doing so, they created a movement in the crowd so that, for a moment, their line of sight to the book signing table was completely free.
. Hal had suggested
Dumbledore approached, and peered into the ashes, smiling.
DADA, however, was not the only subject Hal had started to attend reluctantly. Potions seemed to be a step up from the previous year and Snape was always in a foul mood (what else was new), McGonagall to everyone’s horror’s (and Hermione’s exhilaration) had started talking about exams from the second week of classes, and even Herbology was hard work, dealing with mandrakes, of all things. These things were just nasty.
“What's that, darling?”
“More seriously, we think you might make better use of it than us, now.” Fred sobered them both up. “You…”
This actually gave the man pause, and he mouthed with some confusion. “Hal?”
“Because this is exactly where we ended up earlier.” Hal said. He pointed back to the entrance of the corridor. “I remember that suit of armour. The hands have six fingers.”
“I can be committed.” Pan said determinedly. “This isn’t… I’ve thought a lot about it already. I know I want it. I
“Well.” Hal tried to joke, wryly. “You’ll let me know if you meet one who’s up for a chat, yeah?”
“He hurt
“I didn’t.” Hal laughed. “We got really lucky.”
“You okay?” Hal asked him softly.
Draco tuned out to the rest, white noise filling his ears. It hadn’t been about the Snitch. It might not even have been about winning the game. Flint had targeted Hal not in his capacity as Seeker, but because he was Draco’s friend, and Draco had rebuffed him. It was all Draco’s fault.
At some point, they exchanged addresses – Hermione had asked a question about Christmas cards, wondering if they were a thing for wizards given the whole quill and parchment fashion they seemed to go for at school, and it had turned into this whole discovery about Muggle posting habits, greeting cards, and not least
“Oh no.” Ron sighed. “My mom
“You will stay behind after class.”
And, notably, Mrs Weasley who was excitedly waving him in.
“Oh thank Merlin.” Said a voice that Hal’s identified as being Ron’s.
Hal had a bit of a wistful sigh. “I wish I’d met them.”
“Beg your pardon?” Marge blinked at her, bewildered.
“We’re children.” Someone else said.
He held her back, catching her sleeve as she started to stand.
“I know.” Luna shrugged. “But she really is quite scary. I think she could be a wrestler.”
“No glumbumble would be safe.” Hal said solemnly.
“Merlin help you.”
“Can we brew one?” Ley asked animatedly, conspiratorially, and impatiently.
Hal heaved up his book bag and shoved his hands in his pockets, sulking, but did not try to run away from Draco at least. They let the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs trickle out of the greenhouse, walking a few steps, tentatively at first, then naturally falling into one of the paths they’d trekked so many times the previous year, chatting away and practising spells, enjoying the outdoors. In that moment, Draco missed that so much it was physically painful.
“Yeah, actually. Ley says school sucks but I think he’s doing alright, he seems to have mates. And I’d asked my aunt about my parents’ school friends, I thought it’d be nice to see photos of them, or at least get an idea of who they were. She didn’t have any last names, but she said there was a kid from Cokeworth they met when they were young, Sev, and he was one of my mom’s closest friends at least until fourth or fifth year, and there was a Marlene, and then when she was a bit older and she started dating my dad she seemed to talk a lot about his friends, who were Peter, Remus and Sirius.”
“That’s not why…” Draco felt he had to justify himself. “This isn’t some kind of hero worship.”
Then he started getting out of bed.
It was Lupin’s turn to look surprised. “No?”
“No.” Petunia said, her voice tight.
Hermione presented Neville with a pocket watch, which he looked rather discomfited with until she turned it over for him, and it revealed itself to be essentially the wizard version of a Swiss army knife. Apart from genuinely telling the time on one of its faces, it had a compass, a magically “bigger on the inside” flask compartment that could contain up to 500 ml of water or potion, an emergency wand repair kit, a small knife and a shrinkable blanket. It seemed a little too adventurous for Neville, until your remembered his passion for Herbology had, several times before, seen him trek up into the forest behind his house at midnight to collect this or other plant that only grew under the moonlight in its ascending phase, or something. The only reason he didn’t do the same at Hogwarts was the rather terrifying nature of the forest, and the fact that sneaking out of the castle in the middle of the night was rather frowned upon.
They obviously told each other they’d see them later, though when they were gone, Draco caught Hal closing his eyes and breathing deeply for a moment, lying back for a minute before he had to sit up again to eat.
“I could take him?” It suddenly occurred to Hal. “We’re allowed pets at Hogwarts, there’s everything there to take care of them as so many students have animals. And then we’ll both be here to take care of him during the holidays.”
She couldn't help a little frown. “That is an
“He’s moving!” Neville suddenly cried. “I saw his hand- He’s moving.”
“He’s fine, you know.” She said suddenly.
“Don’t you have class?”
“Hey.” Hal said weakly. “Hey, Draco? What’s wrong?”
“Oh my god.” Hal laughed too. “Do you think that’s him?”
“This.” He said with determination. “Is a really good drawing. And I think you’ve overthinking it.”
Ron, who had played this with his siblings before, Draco and Harry, who had really been enjoying flying lessons so far, and Anthony who was just always up for anything, accepted; Neville, who was hopeless on a broom, and Hermione who just wasn’t that interested in flying, said they’d be there to cheer them on.
There was a heavy silence for a moment, and Hal worried he had offended the ghost.
“Gillian Hollyhock.” Fred provided. “I have to admit, though not quite my type of course, the guy is
He was eying his broomstick with some suspicion, but it was perfectly still and harmless now. He would have it checked, of course, but he’d read enough about Quidditch and broomsticks in the past few months to know that these rarely malfunctioned, and when they did, they tended to overheat and explode rather than try to throw their riders off.
Draco’s lips were pursed in a thin line, and Hal regretted asking, but before he could tell him to forget about it, Draco shrugged.
“Thank you, Sir.” The judge nodded. “I have one more question for the witness. Mister Potter, do you believe Gilderoy Lockhart to have premeditated his attack on yourself and Mister Malfoy?”
“Additionally.” The clerk carried on with a kind smile. “This is increasing by…”
“Fine.” Snape snapped. “I get it, you want to be his friend. How do you know he won’t become a bully?”
Hal looked startled. “Sorry, but you kind of are.”
Hal hummed noncommittally. Draco gave him a stern look.
“Look.” Anthony pointed down.
Hal laughed. “Yeah, he’s shit isn’t he.”
“What?” Hermione frowned. “Why?”
The train was already packed with students, and Draco saw the opportunity for a quick change of plans when Gregory stepped ahead of him to let two older girls in Hufflepuff colours squeeze past, and carried on down the corridor towards the head of the train. Pansy had always talked about how she wanted to sit at the head of the train, when their time came. Draco went the other way, using the cover of the crowd. He wasn’t sure the rest of them would even ask where he’d gone off to and why, but if they did, he had plausible deniability.
“No, wait.” Anthony was catching up. “A secret room only the Heir of Slytherin can open and a creature only he can control.”
“The cat is alive.” Hal pointed out. “The cloak will be fine if I don’t feed and pet it.”
“Oh, darling.” Hal’s aunt was actually the first one to notice he was awake.
“Please, not this again.” Hermione interrupted. “Here, I brought you this.”
*             *
Notwithstanding the dark cold spell the Dementor’s presence had provoked, it had been a pleasantly warm day, and when they were told they would be a slight delay with the first years (two entire boats had toppled, apparently, following a too enthusiastic girl wanting to show off a spell she’d just learnt on her brand new wand, and sending seven students into the lake), a lot of the older years decided to hang outside, enjoying the last few rays of sunshine before heading into the Great Hall for the Sorting and the feast.
He itched for the diary. Despite what his friends had told him, he didn’t feel like he could go to them and start… what, exactly? Complaining about nothing? He had no words to express how he felt, he had no idea why it seemed like something was missing, that he couldn’t put his finger on. Like something was still draining him, in spite of the stress of the first term having abated with the absence of any further attacks.
“So wait.” Hal held up a hand. “If that happened
Draco had disagreed at first. There was a great many things wrong with being attracted to your own sex – people would shun you for it and try to cure you and maybe disinherit you. He’d heard plenty of stories. But then Tom had clarified-
Hal huffed. “Well, he won’t do it for us. But I think he’ll want to do what’s best for the dragon.”
The station was bustling, commuters moving like they may be willing to trample a child as long as they could be on their way, tourists in the middle not helping matters in the slightest, and Hal found himself grabbing Ley’s hand, whose other arm his aunt was holding firmly, as they made their way through the moving crowd. He had received his train ticket a few days earlier, an old-fashioned piece of card that looked like it was part of a game, alongside a sensible note informing them to look for the DAMSELS representative in King’s Cross between platforms 9 and 10.
look up, when they heard his name.
“Why the two of you?” Neville asked, as Ron’s jaw was hanging too low for him to voice the question.
“That was a nice thing you did for the Weasleys. Giving them the books.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Cokeworth is not a very big place.” Draco pointed out. “And it’s not a magical village, so the chances that there was another wizard the same age called

giant mansion. Yours is so… classy. Like you can see your family’s proper posh. Centuries-old posh. You people have taste.”
“Why would someone take something out of a secure vault in Gringotts and bring it to a school for safekeeping?” Anthony insisted.
“Hermione.” Hermione sighed. “So where have you
“He should get a little sister.” Ley mused.
“Oh.” Black looked down again sheepishly. “I, well, I wanted to find Peter and expose him, that is primarily why I escaped, but I had to check on you.”
Anthony spotted him as he got to his feet, and the grin on his face faded.
“Promise.” Hal answered quickly.
They carried on towards the Great Hall for dinner, and Hal pretended that had been nothing and he’d forgotten about it already, but he was unsettled. Because he was sure he’d heard the words, and they weren’t good words. He didn’t think any of the ghosts in the castle were particularly murderous – Bloody Baron aside, maybe, but even in his case his slaughtering spree days seemed to be over, since a few centuries ago. Hal had certainly never heard of him being a real threat, even if he scared the hell out of a lot of younger students, and being the only one able to knock some sense into Peeves certainly meant he had
“Right, well.” Draco sighed to the remaining three – Vince, Greg and Theo. “I should probably head back before curfew anyway. I’ll see you guys around.”
“Honestly, she’s a mate.” Hal insisted. “She just find it more difficult to make friends with other girls.” With a grin of his own, he added. “Although, Draco and I are pretty sure Ron’s developing a crush on her.”
Hal was glad they were playing the Hufflepuff, so he could focus on the game without having to worry about hurting Anthony’s and Draco’s feelings. Training had been tough for the past few weeks – while the days were getting longer and the grounds were starting to show signs of spring, it was still bitterly cold.
He clearly knew his brothers’ questions never came innocently.
It occurred to him then that maybe there laid an alternative solution to his problem. If he made more of an effort to rekindle his ready-made friendships with the other Pureblood kids he’d spent part of his childhood with, maybe the older Slytherin boys would leave him alone. He’d have guest privileges, unspoken protection from the other students, which would certainly be more than what little shielding being related to their head of House offered. At least he hopped so.
Hal shrugged. “I got used to it quick.”
“That’s a skill I have.” Pan said loftily.
“Mister Potter.” The lawyer started, his voice sickly sweet like he was talking to a much smaller child. “There seems to be quite a few elements of your story that don’t add up. You said you can’t remember what spell Mister Lockhart used?”
He knocked on Sev’s office door before Pan could find another excuse to delay him. She did look like she wanted to grab his arm and run, but she schooled herself.
Hal’s first Quidditch game had come around much quicker than he’d realised. The rest of the winter had flown by in snowball fights and heaps of homework, once Hal had recovered from his cold (which had been very fast once he could get a potion), in laughter and petty squabbles similarly cementing the friendships within their little group.
“So in order to do that… I guess, what would you want us to be?” He blushed as he finished asking the question.
“Well, it worked.” Draco said kindly. “So thank you. And for coming after me, both of you. Saved my life, probably.”
Draco just couldn’t hold his tongue at hearing that, and gave Flint his best sneer. “So you read Witch Weekly? How progressive of you.”
Draco snapped back to his present gasping for air, the vision of Hagrid and the horrifying creature he thought would make a good pet still swimming beneath his eyelids. He barely managed to read as new words appeared on the page, Tom explaining that the events caused by Hagrid were terribly unfortunate, and that a group of Slytherins had dug up the Chamber of Secrets legend, having heard it all their lives from their families, and had superimposed the spooky messages and rumours to events they actually had no control over.
at any point in that entire ordeal?
He did not want to be confronted by idiot Gilderoy Lockhart pointing a wand at their heads even as he smiled his brightest smile down on them, where they were still sprawled on the floor. Hal had inched closer and his fingers were just a breath away from Draco’s, so Draco covered them. He didn’t think Hal would read anything into that, and if he did, Draco didn’t care. They both needed any warmth they could get right now, even if it meant leeching it off each other. Hal’s hand was covered in blood and grime, but Draco decided to focus on the way it leaned into his, rather than think about the no-doubt gruesome tale he’d hear about it later.
to resort to the fact James Potter had been a Quidditch player in his time at school to try and convince Hal of his own talent.
want to believe that, because I think it’s bullshit, but you think maybe… it’s that diary?”
Hal nodded enthusiastically. “Yes, sir. Thank you.”
The silence that fell was deafening, for a long minute, the expression on Hal’s face indescribable. Then he got up, and left the room. Ron threw Draco a disappointed look, and went after him. Hermione sighed.
They guffawed like the idiots they were as he met the ground, thankfully this time able to use his arms to cushion the fall – though his elbow did not thank him for it. He tuned out to the slurs and insults that followed and he got to his feet, hating how small he felt surrounded by the older students.
“Convenient.” Hal commented.
“Yeah, sorry if that has lost some of its novelty for me.” He told his cousin. “Been on the news for twelve years.”
“Okay.” Hal nodded. “What’s the full story?”
The first theory was that Hal was the Heir of Slytherin – the dark power of his powerful lineage had protected him against the Killing Curse as a baby, and after defeating another dark wizard at the end of last year, he was continuing on his way to take the Wizarding world by storm and show everyone that he was a force to be reckoned with.
“For telling me all this, I suppose. For putting things into perspective. It did make me feel better. I was this close to feeling sorry for myself.”
He lifted his hair to get this over with. He knew what it looked like – the sunken skin like a great big crack on his temple, healed but still somehow an angry red. The smaller, raised branches crackling away from the main long jagged scar. It covered most of the right side of his face, which looked – as Ley had nicely put it once – like it had been cracked open and pushed together again. It wasn’t a fluke that he’d grown his hair to cover it. He hated it.
“Cedric will destroy you.” One of the boy said, jerking his chin forward challengingly.
He didn’t know if they would remain friends, there would still be the house problem after all – he wasn’t sure about Hermione, though he’d be ready to put money on Ravenclaw with what he’d seen of her, but Weasley was a safe bet for Gryffindor. But it felt like a good start, to have established with someone that the Malfoy heir was not just a posh git – he’d heard those words whispered around him down the train, among other things, so he knew that was the expectation of at least part of the student body.
He swallowed around the sudden lump in his throat, and unfolded the bundle of cloth he found in the paper. It was a cloak, the thick, soft fabric shimmering in the candlelight of the dorm. Clearly an adult size, he could probably throw it over his whole head and still have it pool up on the floor, but he wrapped it around his shoulders regardless to try it on.
The look on their faces was almost worth it. Ron was the first to recover.
“What’s going on here?” Pomfrey appeared came around the partition between the beds. “I will not have any shouting in my ward.”
“I can’t do much else for the pain.” She told him. “I will give you a potion as soon as they are ready. Rest.”
Flint shoved him and he slammed against the wall – another bruise for the road.
would I hurt his cat?”
Draco had a bit of a wistful look, but he changed the subject.
“Good heavens!” He exclaimed. “Harry Potter!”
“I lost most of my stuff when I went to prison.” He said almost apologetically. “So I asked Remus. Here.”
“Well, that was fun.” He commented.
When Hal woke up next, his throat and chest were tight and painful, but his head felt lighter. He had to blink blearily and confusedly a few times for things to come into focus when he opened his eyes, even after readjusting his glasses that had slipped off his nose, because he didn’t see why the headmaster would be sat by his bedside, but there he was.
Hermione was the first to actually recover.
Hermione gave them another exasperated look, but Draco knew there was nothing for it once Hal started playing with his cat. The tiny kitten had grown some, but he was still just as playful, and Hal was absolutely besotted with the creature – it was contagious, he told them how he’d found his aunt curled up with a book, the cat on her lap, during the holiday, though she’d previously tried to pretend she wasn’t interested and he was entirely the boys’ responsibility.
“Isn’t that a nice conundrum?” Riddle carried on. “By the time your spells can touch me, it’ll probably be too late for dear Draco.”
“Did something happen?” He asked.
“We need to get adults.” Hermione insisted.
Hal was confused for a moment, before he recognised the expression. Figured, that Quidditch was the Wizarding world’s equivalent of cricket.
*             *
Also, it was their only shot. Draco held on to Hal’s hand like a lifeline, and when Lockhart swished and started saying
“So what now?” Hal asked, hearing the eagerness in his own voice.
“Yeah, I’m with Potter.” Blaise piped up. “I don’t think he’s got the shadow of a clue.”
He checked the young witch was safely behind him, before pushing open the door to the last chamber. He knew immediately they were too late – not necessarily in a morbid way, but the battle, if there had been one, had already been fought. Harry Potter was lying not far from the door unconscious, and all that was left of Quirrell (and the entity he supposedly had been hosting) was singed purple fabric and black charcoal-like dust.
“It is a Muggle reference.” Fred said proudly.
They were all aware the second floor was where the bloody inscription was, which all the school’s staff efforts (and some of the students’) hadn’t managed to get off the wall.
He came back a few minutes later with his cousin, who looked at the lot of them and smiled and sighed at the same time.
As for Care, it had begun when he had found Fire salamanders at the back of the rose garden one day, crawling all over the fire pit where the gardener had been burning autumn leaves, and he had been utterly fascinated. And quite distraught when they had all died once the fire had gone out, not that he had admitted that to anyone. He’d wanted to know more about the creatures – and any creatures – ever since.
Hal of all people realised that life didn’t give you a warning before putting you in situations where you’d need more than
“But it’s a
. Draco thought with a bit of exasperation.
When they moved on to the front room for coffee – Pan thanking both parents profusely for lunch, and didn’t that feel new and novel not to act like everything was owed to him; it was actually kind of nice – Anthony and Pan held back for a moment.
. Draco did not like it one bit.
“Well,
“Yeah, yeah.” Hal waved a hand dismissively. “You’ve already told me about my mom and dad’s amazing OWL and NEWT results in first year. I’m trying not to fail them monumentally, alright?”
Hermione, next, got Sugar Quills from Ron, a notebook that automatically reorganised your notes from Anthony, magical bath bombs from Hal (one that was like lying in a meadow surrounded by flowers and birdsong, and another that played classical music), a collection of hair ties and clips from Neville and
“Oh.” Hermione stopped, startled. “Did he?”
They stopped at a service station for lunch, where they had sub-par sandwiches, compensated by ice-cream, and Petunia let Hal and Ley play in the small arcade for a bit (she had given them each a small allowance, and Hal had changed some of his wizard money for pounds as well, and after controlling it wasn’t a stupid amount, she had agree they could use it as they saw fit over the holiday) while she watched over them from the side of the room, enjoying her coffee.
“Right.” Hal took a determined breath, as he pulled out the Invisibility Cloak. “Ready?”
Sure enough, as soon as Ron directed them each to a spot on the board, fires lit up on each side to indicate the game was ready to start. Ron actually cracked his knuckles, and then he started playing.
He went past Pomona’s Snare easily, and refused to bother with the keys in favour of blasting the door off its hinges. A shriek answered him, and he found Miss Granger a few steps away into the next room, arms over her head clearly in reaction to the deflagration.
“Sometimes it is.” Hal reasoned. “Sometimes it is, because words alone would not get through the thick skull of someone like that
“If you can stand sitting with Ravenclaws, a Muggleborn and people I’m sure your father would call blood traitors.” Draco told her drily.
*             *
He started really paying attention to the sorting when they got to the letter G. He was a little surprised to see Granger, Hermione go to Gryffindor, not surprised at all when just before her Goyle and Greengrass were sent to Slytherin. A few more students went through – the name
“Maybe.” Petunia said, feeling a bit uncomfortable about it.
He made a few of those comments to Hermione instead, who was sitting next to him, but when she gave him a stern look after he made a ghost joke (he’d only pointed out that
In the next room, there was a troll, already taken care off on the floor – but Anthony pointed his wand at it regardless.
“It’s okay.” Nils repeated, pressing his lips against his again.
Ley cried out in surprise and delight at nearly everything, and while it made Hal laugh he couldn’t really judge, he remembered being in the same situation, he knew the feeling. The only time he fell silent was when Hal took him to his vault. Ley’s mouth opened and closed silently for a long minute before he was able to breathe out the words
Hermione and the others were also being monitored, but it seemed that apart from some loss of muscle tone and a voice cracked from disuse, they wouldn’t be feeling too many after effects. All of them came to personally thank Hal, offering congratulations (Nick), giving him hugs (Colin, Hermione of course, Penelope) or apologising for ever thinking of him as a bad person (Justin).
His parents’ expressions started to crumble, though they were obviously still coming to grasp with the turn the conversation was taking.
“Oh.” She blinked.
“Flint!” He called out.
Their progression for the rest of their shopping was arduous. It was almost like the word had gotten out that Harry Potter was in Diagon Alley, because they were stopped by countless wizards and witches wanting to say hello and how much they admired him. Some of them were asking random questions as well, which Hal avoided answering in favour of getting away as quickly as humanly possible in that crown, and some of them were downright inappropriate, such as the one who told him he was so chuffed his parents had died – which had Neville actually tell the wizard to
“What do you mean?”
The clerk cleared his throat, and leaned back on his account book.
He’d walk back to the station and try to Floo somewhere – he might be able to afford going directly to the Leaky Cauldron, they had rooms there, and then he’d be where he needed already for school supplies and the train. Not fancying making that walk in the heavy rain though, Pan sat down at the foot of the tree to wait it out for a bit.
“Ravenclaws specifically?” Hal prompted curiously.
Hal gave him a look that expressed all his confidence in the matter.
“Yeah, same as Christmas.” Pan nodded. “Staying with Blaise is always a bit dodgy, though he’s offered, but otherwise Mrs Malfoy and Mr and Mrs Goldstein have said I’m welcome to stay with them.”
It wasn’t just that he had made a promise to his friends – he still thought he could just start pouring his heart out and tell them everything that crossed his mind. But to be fair, it would do him well to remember he didn’t have to struggle with strong and confusing emotions alone. As helpful as Tom had been to him, he wasn’t his only option. Draco had
He could feel his face heat up, and she nodded thoughtfully.
“Oh, this boy has a newt! See, our supply list said owl, cat or toad if we wanted to bring a pet, but I’ve read that it was more of a guideline, intended for first years mostly, and later on you can bring any pet you want as long as they are sensible. Do you have a pet? My parents didn’t want me to get one, they said maybe when I’m older. I think I’d want a cat, they seem to be the most traditional familiars, right? Not that they seemed to be called familiars anymore, I think they’re just pets.”
“Oh, you’re seeing him now?” Neville asked.
Hal and Hermione skirted alongside the wall, keeping as far away to the troll as the small room allowed, while Anthony remained where it could see the thing’s face. When they reached the door, the handle gave immediately.
“What the fuck is that!” Hal couldn’t stop the words from leaving his mouth.
They quickly reached the third floor again, and Sev visibly recoiled for a second at the sight of the dog, and relaxed when he saw it was asleep. In one look, he took in Rolf playing the flute and the sleeping dog, and cast a quick spell at the harp so it would take over, relieving the boy. He sighed as he stopped, and cautiously unfolded himself from the floor.
But that was another four days away. In the meantime, Draco was at a loose end, erring around the manor, listless, and
“Hop on.”
Ron and Neville had tried to get him out bed earlier, and he had eventually followed them out even though his vision felt blurry and his throat hurt like hell when he swallowed, only to be told he looked like shit by Anthony, fretted over by Hermione and sent to the hospital wing by an unsympathetic Professor McGonagall after two minutes of class.
Hal looked at Anthony, the two of them clearly remembering the first time they’d come face to face with the Cerberus and not all that eager to repeat the experience.
He’d already asserted that cats did not see through the cloak, though Little John Silver seemed to know where the person wearing it was, probably through smell or a sense of their warmth. Walking around the castle at night, Hal was able to confirm that paintings couldn’t see him, nor ghosts (and discovered on the same occasion that at night, Professor Binns apparently taught History to other ghosts – several of which kept interrupting that they had been there, and it wasn’t at all how it had happened).
“Yes, he is.”
“Yeah.” Hal smiled, opening his eyes again to look at him. They were very green, Draco through stupidly. “Just tired.”
Petunia handed Ley his towel back, and gave one to Hal, who ran it over his head – his hair was somehow dripping wet, even if an entire one of his arms was still completely dry. And he dragged it down, it pushed his hair to the side, half plastered across his forehead, leaving a rare and clear view of his scar.
“I’ll have a word with her.” Draco determined.
They – Draco and Anthony and the three Gryffindors, Blaise and Pan hadn’t been required and hadn’t insisted to stay – sat together waiting for the room to clear, after which the adults joined them; their respective Heads had gone to shepherd the rest of their House, so it was only Dumbledore, who took a seat at the table across from them, and Lupin and Sirius standing by the side. The latter had cleaned his face but looked no less distressed for it.
That seemed to satisfy her, as she leaned closer to him, and spoke so the others wouldn’t hear.
In short, it was the best compliment Ron could possibly pay him – and it actually did make him feel better. Ron was right, he knew his Quidditch. If anyone could make a fair assessment of Hal’s potential and skill, it was him. He was also the first person
Draco’s face did something odd like he wasn’t sure whether he should laugh.
After the feast – it wasn’t nearly as big as the start of year one, but still slightly more outrageous than then normal term-time dinners – they gathered in the Gryffindor common room to exchange presents. This year, they had decided on a Secret Santa, after Hermione and Hal had thoroughly explained the concept to the rest of them.
“Thanks.” Hal said noncommittally, feeling his eyes narrow.
of my theory, I think you should go speak to the headmaster.”
*             *
“Has he?” Hal raised a brow.
it to Hal, Ron and Neville?
“You’ll get in trouble.” Hal said.
“Can I tell you something?” She seemed to challenge.
, but he decided to let that go to focus instead on the ridiculous cartoonish simplification of a lightning bolt Ron clearly had in mind.
Absent-mindedly, he picked up a quill (enchanted to always be wet with ink when used) and flipped the notebook open again.
They both shrieked as soon as their toes touched the water.
“Oh thank God.” Hermione breathed out shakily.
“It’s not.” Draco countered softly. “You have every right to want to get to know who they were.”
“Things like Quirrell, the Chamber of Secrets? We don’t think they’ll stop happening to you.”
“I can’t see.” Hal pointed out, in a bid to get his glasses back.
Hal snorted. “Guess you have a point.” But he sobered up almost immediately. “The stuff it was saying, Nev. It wanted blood.” He shivered.
He muttered something else that Draco thought may or may not have been
“What have I done?” Hal asked, honestly confused.
“Wasn’t him the first time.” Hagrid countered grumpily. “And isn’t him this time either.”
“No.” He stopped her again, crossing his arms, his face in a frown and pout.
“I am sure they will.” Hal patted his arm again, and jumped backwards as the leathery wing flapped.
Draco knew his mother wasn’t going to entertain them, so he grabbed Hal for a tour of the manor. He started with his room, which Hal commented was about the size of half his house, but didn’t linger there – Draco didn’t particularly like his room. Like Hal had spotted, it was too big. If felt a little impersonal. Even the room he shared with Anthony at Hogwarts had come to feel more like his.
Dora had glared back. “I am not a child.”
Hal had been personally informed of Pettigrew’s escape, but they also had to make an announcement to the whole school since Dementors were on their way to once again be posted around the castle.
“I know what happened next.” Snape snapped. “What I don’t know is why three first-year students seem to be stupid enough to try and break into the potions storeroom while a troll is wandering about the dungeons.”
“Anyway, he thought you’d want to know, Quirrell isn’t there. Neither are a lot of the Slytherins. So that’s like, the main suspects for what happened last time.”
Draco stopped talking dead in his tracks.
“I know, mate.” Ron said impatiently. “But if we don’t head back now, we’ll miss curfew.”
“Don’t start spending that money on silly things without consideration.” Petunia chastised. “You have no point of reference to know how much you actually have.”
known Parselmouth in history was Salazar Slytherin. That is why the snake is the symbol of his House.”
And for the first time since he was old enough to know he was going, he was rather looking forward to starting school.
And Draco hadn’t been sorted in Slytherin! Dora was excited about that – it showed the kid was growing to be his own person, as she had no doubt he
“This has nothing to do with the fact he’s Harry Potter!” He roared.
“Why, because he survived the Killing Curse?”
It gave Hal pause as he tried to remember. “I guess I did? Sorry. It just slipped out.”
“My aunt will pick me up tonight.” Hal took his turn. “Muggle Christmas for me.”
He only felt like he could breathe once he was safely in his bedroom – which felt oddly empty without Anthony, even though it was usually just the two of them. He wondered how it was to share a whole dorm with four or five other boys. It must work for most people, if Ravenclaw was the only House going for rooms of just two.
“My father died when I was six.” He reminded him.
back at him.
“Who was that?”
.” Neville sided with Anthony.
Hal wanted to say he hadn’t done fuck all, but it seemed a bit rude in the circumstances. He didn’t want to burst their bubble.
“Sirius Black.” She spat angrily as she came nearer. “You are a murderer! You should be ashamed to show your face!”
“Things don’t work the same way here.” Hal told her. “I mean, there is a dangerous forbidden forest
of Flint and the others. Inconvenienced was more accurate. A bit humiliated, but what would he gain in fighting back. He could bear to lose a few galleons, and he didn’t want them to start getting ideas about hexing the people he cared about – and quite objectively, at one eleven year-old against five almost fully grown teenagers, he didn’t really like his chances.
“It’s a magical scar, left by a curse nobody else ever survived.” She pointed out. “There is literally no precedent to document the after-effects this could have in the long term, and-”
“I’m sure you’ve got what matters in here.” Hal shrugged. “Don’t feel bad because of this.” He waved his own letter. “I’m writing to two people so it’s bound to be longer.”
“That’s okay, Dobby.” Draco said, though Hal reserved that judgement for when his heart stopped hammering. “Could you get us each a bowl of ice cream? The way Dilly makes it.”
“Magic is real.” She said firmly. “There is a community of people with the ability to use it – from what I understand, it is a small minority, and they prefer not to make themselves known to the rest of the world.”
They all exchanged grins at the half-arsed jokes, simply happy to see their friends well enough to make them, then Pomfrey came to shoo them away.
“Oh for Merlin’s sake, what is wrong with this castle?”
of the chocolate that his aunt Marge had sent him for his birthday (almost two months late, which was rather like her), in one go, and it had been a very, very large box. His mom had only chastised him. He’d been ill over dinner, but they’d still put it down to the chocolate.
He’d taken to always having it in his pocket, even more so since the incident in Hogsmead. Not that it would have prevented his abduction, but somehow it made him feel safer either way.
Hal beamed again, his smile as bright as his eyes, and Draco loved him so much it hurt. I have to tell him, he thought.
“A lot. But it’s cool!” Anthony defended. “She made me think of Rolf a bit, actually. They’d probably get along.”
It did happen, however. Once, as Dora had gone off to meet friends and Draco, Hal and Ley were sat enjoying some ice cream at a place that had quickly become a regular spot ever since the first day, when Dora had introduced them to it. The
By the time they made their way back to the Gryffindor common room, most students were off to breakfast, and a peek inside their room confirmed to Hal that it was empty. Of humans, at least, Animagi notwithstanding; he could see Scabbers nested in the blankets on Ron's unmade bed, Trevor looking placid in his glass tank on Neville’s bedside table, Dean's owl perched by the window, and Little John Silver who trotted up to him. Hal picked him up into his arms as he turned back to nod at the two adults.
She bit her lip, hesitant.
Lupin shook his head, a little ruefully.
He had been unsettled for days, after that conversation about Flint and Wood and the boy they may or may not be fighting over. It had brought back his little encounter with Flint in the changing room corridors, which made him feel sick just thinking about it, which made him wonder how
After their hour was up, and they had turned back into their younger selves on the way back, Draco managed to grab an opportunity to hang back with Pansy.
“I’m going to stop using it.” Draco pledged.
But he’d thought that was it – obviously, he hadn’t known his parents were part of two different worlds. He’d also never thought of the other bank account as
“Alright.” Pan raised her hands in defence. “Keep your wands sheathed.”
“I didn’t know.” Hal said apologetically. “Is it against the rules?”
“Is she having a stroke?” Draco asked.
The rest of the trip carried on in a similar fashion. Luna and Ginny left with about half an hour to go, to join other first years before they arrived, and the rest of them exchanged looks as soon as they were gone.
to get along with him. He was also hilarious, as the rest of the afternoon proved. He couldn’t get enough of anything, and was cracking joke after joke. Even if Draco hadn’t found them funny, the free and happy way in which Hal laughed would have been enough to be contagious. Draco had never seen this much energy in a person outside of the Weasley twins.
Again, the tone went straight over the Professor’s head, even as several students sniggered. Hoping to get away with it, Hal sat down next to Ron, placing the cat bed – Sil was quiet inside it, bless him – carefully in front of him as if that could protect him.
“What? Me what?” Hal immediately got flustered, which of course got Sirius to cast him a knowing look.
Hal gave Anthony an unimpressed look, because no, it wasn’t insane, they had thought this through carefully with Draco, and once they’d reached that conclusion, it really seemed to be the only one that made sense.
“Well, yeah. You guys.” Pan frowned when Ron just looked at him. “You do know you’re in there somewhere in the Black family tree, right? I mean, go back far enough, all the Pureblood Houses are related.
“I guess about ten, fifteen minutes ago?” Anthony hazarded.
“Anyway.” Fred waved a hand. “We didn’t realise Pettigrew was an actual person who was really there the whole time. And we think you would have known better.”
“Yeah, well it started like now. Threats on the walls, attacks, petrification. And…” He paused, wincing.
When Sirius had left later that afternoon, Hal actually took Ley up on that, and told him everything that had happened the previous summer with Nils and Francezka. Ley bounced back and forth between outrage and something like envy, though the side of him that felt defensive of Hal seemed stronger.
He swallowed like he was fighting down tears, and Draco knew he couldn’t understand, not really, not having grown up with siblings. He carefully didn’t say anything still. He could tell there was more than that bothering him.
“Fantastic.” Hal snarled. “Another great advantage of being famous. Now I’m a cat-killer.”
Draco was saved from having to answer that as his mother and Hal’s aunt came back with trays of food.
“Hey, Gin.” Ron vaguely waved at her.
“Cool.” She dropped. “Hi, Harry.” She added quickly, looking at a point left of Ron’s head – Hal was standing to his right.
Neville shrugged.
“What about the cat?” Anthony asked.
Hal had a pout, and briefly thought about dismissing the question as he had with most people (“Much better now, thanks!”), but he felt like he could tell her the truth.
When it turned out she was neither Pansy nor Daphne, but Greg, it took them all a while to recover – even Draco thought it was pretty funny, until Greg stopped being miffed about it and started being disgusting, squeezing his – her – breasts first experimentally, then downright inappropriately.
Blaise had been off on a self-appointed mission to find out more about the Chamber of Secrets, by way of getting gossip from his mother, who’d get it from her numerous relations in the Wizarding world.
Hal turned back once, probably to check they’d put enough distance between them and the hut to be out of earshot, and shook his head with a short laugh.
The Macmillans were still deemed respectable, owing entirely to Herbert’s quite high ranking job in the Ministry and Paula’s legendary “Ladies’ nights” – what that entailed, Draco did not want to know – even though both their children had had rogue sortings. But Pippa had apparently made quite a name for herself while in Gryffindor, she’d had friends among the snakes, and was now following her father’s footsteps gunning for a political career. Ernest, ten years younger, was only just starting Hogwarts, but Draco supposed Hufflepuff was less controversial. Nobody expected much of Hufflepuffs.
“Draco!” He cried out again, jolted into action.
, and Hal took that opportunity to cast a
That was rather more successful as Ron considered it. Upon arrival the night before, Hermione had been borrowed by McGonagall – who had also taken a minute to ask Hal how he was, having clearly heard about the episode with the Dementor on the train – but when questioned about what it had been about, Hermione had just replied ‘classes’ rather evasively. Hal had caught a glimpse of her timetable, which seemed considerable fuller than the rest of theirs, but she’d shoved it away in her bag before they could get a good look. That was quite the departure from second year where she had talked their ears off for forty-five minutes, commenting on the organisation of their classes and her thoughts on the matter in excruciating details.
She waited until after dinner that night, which was an unruly affair. The summer holidays were in full swing, and released from the obligations of school, both boys were wired up and managing even more mischief than they usually would. As Petunia was working full time, they couldn’t leave Little Whinging, but they would find enough to keep themselves busy in and around the house, meeting up with friends, dreaming up adventures and pulling pranks around the neighbourhood. She had told them this year they were old enough to watch themselves, emphasising ideas of trust and responsibility in the hope that some of it would sink in, but in reality, she got along with her neighbours well enough that everyone knew they were unofficially, collectively keeping an eye on the children, hers and all the other kids who hadn’t left for the holidays. They did say it took a village.
“Ignore them.” He told him.
“I simply wanted to ask how you’re holding up.” Dumbledore said kindly. “See if there is anything you would like to share, or ask me.”
“Yes. This one is… from your dad.” She gestured to the tin.
“At the very least.” Severus confirmed. “They will be your best support if they accept this.”
“Anytime between November and March is bad timing.” Anthony piped up. “Everyone gets sick when it’s cold.” He paused thoughtfully. “Except Edmund. He gets stronger instead.”
And he told Ley about the magic mirror, which had shown him what could have been. He hadn’t mentioned it six months previous, the emotions still too raw, and then quite a lot had happened in between and it had kind of slipped his mind, until Ley had spoken those two words.
Draco was pretty sure his father would have been of the opinion that bettering yourself included getting rid of your silly crush on a school friend. In that, at least, Draco agreed with Tom – nobody had to know, least of all Hal himself. He’d decided not to mention the diary to him either.
Hal’s face clouded over instantly, his previous happy mood clearly soured.
Marge briefly showed surprised, which quickly turned to sneer again. “Told him the truth, have you?” She addressed Petunia again.
