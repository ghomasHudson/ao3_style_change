"Evening, beautiful.", a deep voice whispered into his ear, giving every hair on his body a reason to stand up. Draco's hand was trembling. To not receive any attention he quickly put the plate on the table, before he broke it.
"I waited seven years for you to ask that question. I have never been as ready for something my whole life."
Harry closed his eyes, lying his head on Draco's shoulder to be as close to his ear as possible and to have as much physical contact as possible. He started breathing, deep and slow, the rhythm he wanted Draco to copy.
handsome young man. The other could barely be older than himself, if his flour powdered cheeks and startling green eyes were any indication. The man wore a checkered button up, only it
Draco only snorted in response, leaving his mother to pat him on the cheek as he pouted and stepping away afterwards. They threw each other a smile once again, before Narcissa eventually left her son's room with a very soft 'click' of the door. The silver eyes of the blond searched the Eiffel Tower in the far distance for another long moment, before eventually he walked back into his room and to his closet, where most of his clothes had already been arranged by their ever working house elves. Draco had to remember to give Dobby a little gift for his efforts to make everything so utterly perfect for them. Maybe he would find a small gift shop on his walk through Paris, the small elf loved to collect those gift cards from around the world.
"I believe you oversaw the memo of a heterosexual date, Harry.", he mumbled, drawing nearer to the other man in discomfort of the shocked, disgusted and hungry stares they received.
"The way Bird Nest looks at you, I don't think it will really be a problem. You look dreadful by the way in a suit. Like some bureaucratic asshole."
deserve to be here. You are way more than just your job, even though you might not realize it.", Harry rubbed the stubble on his chin with a thoughtful frown. "Sounded way deeper than I intended it to. I just want to say, you are very welcome and I would love to be in your company for these days."
Cosmo barked once and wiggled his tail. Pax took that as a yes. "Cosmo says yes!" He hugged Cosmo and went back inside.
The loud snort escaping Draco's lips was prove enough of his amusement about the joke, only intensified by the pillow the blond reached out for and hurled at Harry's face, obviously as pleases by the mental picture as Harry was. Hermione, meanwhile, rolled her eyes at them, not giving Harry the privilege to laugh at a joke about a dead man. Still, she
But soon a frown claimed his face, his brows shaping a v; nose slightly raised. Sixth year has been utterly terrible, a complete disaster to be exact. Harry learned most of life's lessons the hard way, but some of them he wished to not involve other people around him. Growing up in a love-lacking family has proven to make Harry's experience on regular social encounters practically nonexistent. Hence this ridiculous accident in the girls bathroom occurred. Harry never forgave himself for his behavior, seeing a crying boy and almost killing him. Even with the hurtful past of the two, Malfoy never deserved anything like that. A sigh escaped Harry's lips, hand running through his midnight locks. He was such an idiot. But this was his chance to make up for everything, a chance he had to use.
"So, how long do you want me? Just the night? Or maybe a whole day?", Draco asked, business was business after all. And even with closed eyes Draco managed to make out that he quite startled the other man. Rich Guy moved with a soft scrunching noise in his seat, possibly looking back at Draco.
Harry chuckled, quickly grabbing two plates and pulling Draco outside (not out the same door both of the other guys disappeared in) and plopping down onto soft grass. Draco followed suit, long legs crossed beneath himself. "Padfoot, c'est my godfazer wiz ze 'arley. 'E is an animagus. Moony, c'est 'is 'usband, a werewolf. Zey wanted to meet you. And 'e is chasing Sirius, because Moony loves nozing more zan 'is chocolate."
Shortly after, Harry swung his leg over the monster of a motorcycle, his one hand starting the engine while the other was held out to Draco. "Come on, no need to be afraid."
Harry accioed a piece of parchment from the main room, together with a black feather quill and handed both to Malfoy. He wrote down a floo-address, together with a name. Angela Allard. The young Healer frowned at the name. It sounded both English and French, it felt weird on his tongue. And he didn't know who that was. The address was located in France, probably the reason for the French last name. Whoever this girl was, Malfoy must be really fond of her. If the puppy eyes he threw at Harry were any indicator.
All men in the room nodded and took a seat, looking mildly interested. Harry was not one to insult people, so the fact that he actually thought of somebody as a bastard, caused them to believe that there must have been something incredibly bad going on.
Next moment, Harry was leaving the office, walking directly to the next elevator. Inside, he took a second to calm his emotions. A terrible headache was building right behind his eyes, he could feel his veins pumping too much blood through his body and his muscles clenched. His magic was going into overdrive. Hermione and Ron could probably sing a song about how easily Harry's emotion got the better of him back in school and how his magic went apeshit with his uncontrolled rage. Even though he had been getting better at self control throughout the years of working, the rage he was feeling right then was worse than anything he had ever felt. It was even worse than what he felt at Sirius death. Maybe Draco was more important to him than he dared to admit.
"Don't you thank me Malfoy. I owe you one for the bathroom incident back then and for failing in your trial. And for not giving you a chance in first year. Just all of it. Sorry for everything I ever put you through Malfoy.", his breath was shaky as tears threatened to fall from his own eyes, blinking them away quickly. "Let's move on with your health then, shall we? Now can you point to what hurts the most right now?"
So with growing confidence the blonde strode into the shop, his eyes immediately searching for the beautiful woman his best friend's mother was. Quickly enough, brown eyes locked with his and he was encircled by welcoming arms, running through all the measurements to create a perfect outfit for his date. Not that he actually mentioned his date was a young man, not a young girl. He
"I'll go with you. Just don't make too much of a scene.", Draco whispered, arms once again wrapped around himself. Nott has been Draco's procurer, making sure he got costumers for all of Draco's youth. As soon as he got 18, Nott threw him on the streets and took his cousin Teddy as his new youngling. Still, Draco was not allowed to have any other procurer to provide safety for him, one reason why Draco was about to die on the streets that morning. A procurer would normally make sure their people have at least a shaky roof over their head, mostly in a small farm house or garage where a dozen of people would stay for the night. Without one, a callboy or prostitute was as good as dead. Draco was glad he survived the past three years. Still, having now disobeyed Nott's rule, he would either hurt or kill Teddy or him. Depending on his mood.
"I know there are no dentists in the Magical World. But we could visit a Muggle dentist, if you'd like to. They can do a lot of stuff with your teeth when you have the right amount of money.", Harry explained softly, letting warm water flow over Malfoy's head for a moment. The blonde closed his eyes slowly, relaxing into the warmth of the water. Harry decided on washing the Slytherin's head first and giving him a chance to relax, before moving down to the rest of his body. So Harry grabbed a bottle of shampoo, irony hit him when the scent was that of green apples, and gave some of it on his hands. He then started on rubbing it into Malfoy's hair, beginning at the top of his head and moving down slowly to his neck, rubbing slow circles and massaging his scalp delicately. Malfoy's mouth hung open at the sensation of Harry's hands spoiling his head like that. Owing to the ragged breaths leaving Malfoy's mouth, Harry could have sworn the Slytherin would have moaned, if been able to.
His answer walked into the room with full lunch boxes and several steaming drinks, all carefully balanced on his arms and hands. Why on earth he didn't use a simple spell was beyond Harry, but he surely forgot about his magical ability sometimes too. Hermione on the other hand didn't, as she quickly casted several
The Healer rolled his eyes, placing a featherly kiss on Draco's knuckles. It was so soft, the blonde seemed at a loss for words for a second. At least the tears were gone by now. Harry used the silence to run his fingers a little longer over Draco's cheeks and bottom lip, not realizing Draco was starring at him. Not really a surprise, but Harry got incredibly lost in the other's face, appreciating every little feature and scar on it, marking what he endured. Draco parted his lips, catching Harry's finger between them, finally causing the younger to look at him with wide eyes.
"I swear to Merlin, you will pay this freaking door!", Hermione yelled, blowing the white door up with a spell Harry couldn't decipher. Of course he couldn't, after all the explosion was loud enough to blow his head off, so bloody strong did the headache get through her action. Draco, meanwhile, got so surprised he bit down on Harry's finger and caused the younger to yelp at the sharp pain. Both their heads whipped around to see a furious Hermione storming into the room, being met with two sets of raging eyes, one as green as the woods and the other silver as mercury. Quickly enough, those two intense stares backed off, since Mione's hand came flying down right on Harry's cheek, producing a loud slap and a flicker of respect combined with fear in Draco's eyes. The Raven, on the other hand, rubbed his cheek with a stubborn glare, looking like a child being scolded by their mother.
"I would dare to say they are even better. Many of us use eye patches. They simulate darkness for one eye to be able to fight in darkness, but a lot of pirates are blind or partly blind."
The shorter male was met with a longer silence, a thoughtful silence on Draco's side. He was contemplating his possibilities. Harry seemed like an okay guy, a bit desperate, but no crazy killer. Though, it wasn't impossible. Looking at the other side of the coin, he didn't really have any other options. So, with crossed arms, Draco scoffed and gave Harry an unimpressed look. "Maybe a wife would do you some good. There is far better company than a guy from the streets for Christmas."
Harry was sure this exact life flashed in front of Draco's eyes, the second his feet slipped on the wet wood and he cried out in agony. The young pirate reacted immediately and grabbed his arm with both hands, holding him tightly. With a small huff he pulled him back up and to the ship. The young boy was halfway drenched in freezing seawater, a shocked look on his perfect face. Lucius and Narcissa stared at them in terror as they reached the boat. But Draco stayed silent, trembling hand still in Harry's as he moved obly a little bit closer. Harry couldn't help but smile.
Both of them quickly put the heavy jackets on, which would protect them from the wind, and soon enough Draco's hands slung around the broad chest he had wanted to touch from the moment they had met. All the muscles felt as hard as he imagined them, creating small hills and valleys beneath his exploring fingers. Harry seemingly didn't mind being groped at like that, as he leaned back a little further into the touch and started driving soon enough. Draco pressed his face into the security of the smaller one's neck, inhaling the earthy scent of cologne mixed with a little bit of nervous sweat and a whole lot of sweets. Not that Draco minded. His hands fisted into the soft silk beneath his fingers, as he hid his hands underneath Harry's suit jacket to keep them warm (of course that was not an excuse for groping around a little more).
Captain Black, Harry's godfather, had a thing for moral and codes. They would face a rather gruesome death if ever caught in sexually abusing a women. Even though killing was somehow allowed, even torture wasn't off the list, so the moral was rather compromised on a few things to balance out their crimes. At least that's what the Captain always said. Harry believed that his godfather was just utterly disgusted by rape, because he experienced the aftermath of rape in form of Harry's mother, Lily. In her younger years the girl was raped by some drunken old man and she had been rather traumatized ever since. Sirius, James, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew all lived through it with her, doing their best to comfort the girl and help her to live through it. That's why Harry assumed that Captain Black was still haunted by the event in his youth, therefore not allowing it on his very ship.
"I can't heal them completely here, but I can release some pain so we can get you out of here. Is that alright?"
A black Mercedes then drove through the lonely streets, slowly as the driver was currently talking on his phone. The guy looked rather annoyed, black eyebrows furrowed, hiding the eyes of a rather handsome young man from Draco's view. Even though rich male guys definently stood high on the customer list, the guy was quite too young to take advantage of Draco's services. Against the blonde's expectations, the black haired male eyed him closely as soon as he looked up from his phone. His plump pink lips formed a straight line, before he hung up on whoever he talked to. The black car moved to the side where Draco stood, window rolling down slowly. Draco would have hugged and probably broken his rules to kiss the guy in the car, just to make clear how much he probably saved his ass from a rather frightening death. Instead, Draco smirked at the guy in the car, leaning against a streetlamp to give off a sexier impression.
Theo looked as if he would rip someone's head out when he jumped at Harry, taking him down to the floor in a mess of limbs and grunts. The worry in Draco rose with every punch they landed on each other and with every person joining the circle of onlookers.
As soon as all the bubbles were washed out, Harry stepped out of the shower, shivering a little from the cold water by now. But after he found his way into the bedroom and put on some jeans and a sweater, he felt warm and comfortable again.
"What, are you afraid to let everybody know what you are? A sweet little whore from the streets, the most worthless scum this earth ever came up with?", Nott drawled, causing a whisper to go through the mass of people. Draco wrapped his arms around himself, trying to hide from the whispers and stares he received, disgusted expressions on their faces and hateful messages. Tears formed once again in Draco's eyes, but before they managed to drop a strong voice came from besides him.
Not even an hour later, Harry and Draco sat, again, in Harry's black Mercedes, on their way to the dinner party of Harry's boss. The designer decided to dress in a full black suit in striking comparison to Draco's silver one. They looked like day and night, sun and moon. Draco wasn't even mad about how well they fit together. Right then and there, he belonged with Harry and nobody could tell him otherwise.
"I will probably never get used to this.", he whispered, catching his breath again after several seconds. "What is it Harry?"
Something about that question made Draco choke on thin air, causing the blonde to cough violently. "Your what?"
The face he achieved from this explanation was worth an Oscar. Malfoy had his eyes drawn open at the words 'they cut them open' and seemed positively throwing up by the time Harry finished with the image of just taking out an entire organ. To say he was terrified would be an understatement. As one could expect when their former enemy told them they would cut them open to rip out something in their throat, Malfoy shook his head vehemently and moved slightly back from Harry, showing him the bird all in the process.
"I... had anger problems ever since I can remember. It worsened at Hogwarts, having Voldemort around and all. And-... and you. You were always able to push buttons inside my brain so I go vivid.", the look of guilt on Draco's face gave Harry reason to squeeze him to his side, gently smiling. "Don't you worry. You weren't reason for this episode. Not really, anyways. I got worked up on that guard of yours."
A small hand tucked at his, ending his train of thoughts. The small boy looked up at him with his mesmerizing eyes, cold as ice and at the same time soft as cotton.
"I'm so glad you don't think I'm crazy. I just saw it and... thought of you? You are just so elegant and posh, you would look great in this stuff."
Another one! You guys really hype me up right now, I hope a little angst his welcome! Enjoy the chapter, loves!
Implying the latter, coffee became his best friend soon after getting the job. So the young man gratefully gulped two cups of strong black coffee, while stuffing half of a sandwich in his mouth. Normally his breaks weren't longer than five minutes, because the next life threatening incident would roll up almost immediately. As soon as Harry felt the caffeine kick in after the second cup, he quickly glanced at his clipboard to make out who he should visit next. There were almost a dozen other patients on his list, going from broken arm to high fever, so he chose something less tempting after the four hour surgery he just was a part of. A smaller boy with hurting wrists it should be. Quickly the man sat down his cup at his office desk, which was almost so full with papers they were starting to block the view to the chair. Tara, a beautiful young witch with black hair and dark skin, looked at her coworker with a sigh, shaking her head. Harry knew she worried about him being a complete workaholic, but there was no time for arguments about his health right now. Even though he gave her a reassuring smile in hope it would help her relax.
From one moment to the next, Malfoy's smile fell, his eyes going blank in a matter of seconds. He looked down on himself, his chest, his hands, his long and knotted hair and licked over his teeth. 'Foul teeth', Harry remembered reading on the diagnosis parchment. With a small sigh Harry pushed Malfoy's head back into the sink and stood behind him.
"I had a dream about an angel... he was wearing something I could not put into words so I tried and put it into a suit.", there was a short pause. "It actually should be your size.", he mumbled, taking the mannequin into a small changing room. "Come I'll help you put it on."
"We need to operate in several occasions in your case, but I wanted to give you some time to adjust to the whole situation. Whenever you think you're ready, we can start on your tonsils or ribs.", he explained, running a hand through his black hair and smearing some of the bubbles into it. Malfoy gave him a look of confusion, an almost instant indicator for Harry to facepalm himself. Right. Malfoy was in Azkaban for five years. "Oh right. I forgot. In the past years Healer's adapted a lot of Muggle-medication. They kind of cut people open under anesthesia and fix anything inside of the body that way. It works a lot better for some things than magic. For example magic couldn't help you with your tonsils, you would just have problems there forever, but Muggles just take them out completely, they are not really necessary to survive."
Malfoy slowly blinked and looked at the other with disbelieve, when again strong big hands moved to his skin. Only seconds after Harry laid his hands on the deep purple bruises on both sides of Malfoy's chest, Draco felt exhaustion overwhelming him. As soon as the pain was gone, nothing held him awake anymore. So he blinked tiredley before falling asleep with his head resting in Potter's lap. Harry looked at the other male with a shy smile, shaking his head softly.
"Two Aurors showed up at Mungo's the other day to get a Healer to the scene, because the prisoner had 'some sort of injury and needed a Healer to look over them'. As you can imagine, I volunteered to visit the prison.", all eyes were by now glued to him, waiting for a turning point. But Harry had to pause, the pictures of Malfoy in the dark corner, more dead than alive, were still way too vivid in his mind. Even deep breaths weren't enough to stop the trembling of his voice as he continued. "Nobody told me who I would have to heal. When I saw Mal-... Draco. When I saw Draco sitting in the complete dark, freezing corner of that goddamn cell; I got so bloody angry. Not only the fact that nobody cared enough to call a Healer sooner, somebody actively hurt him. And I don't mean a soft beating. Somebody grabbed a helpless boy's ribs and pulled so hard they broke, knowing nobody would care enough to intervene. Now that Draco is my patient and I won't sleep a single night without knowing this guy got what he bloody deserved, I want to know who did this to him. And I want to beat the ever living shit out of him. This guard, whoever it was, deserves worse than being called a bastard, gentleman. He deserves that exact cell Draco sat in. Because whoever can do such gruesome things to another human being, earns a worse treatment than any Death Eater we have captured. They at least had their own morality. A wrong one, but at least there was one. This guard, however, decided not only to hurt somebody willingly, but a literally defenseless person, who is already paying for his wrong doings enough as it is. And I want to make sure this monster gets exactly what he deserves."
"Don't you talk against me, young man. Without you I would have had to close this place. Young people just won't go into the simple jobs anymore and those who do, just aren't as passionate.", she turned back to Draco, her eyes filled with warmth. "Harry started helping me out with only ten years. His parents are regulars here and he always wanted to learn how to bake from me. They wanted him to finish the Beauxbatons first before getting to work, but still he managed to work here all the hours he hasn't been at school. And after finishing a month ago he came to work here full time as my apprentice.", she moved closer to Draco, a smile plastered to her chastened lips. "A hand for fine things the man has. You two would do great on a date, if I may say so."
Harry watched the doors flying by without really reading the numbers, the situation pulled on his nerves too much. Poor soul, imprisoned for a crime that wasn't his. Lost every hope and every life he probably once had in cause of false accusations. But once the men stopped in front of him, Harry snapped out of his thoughts without hesitation. The bigger one of the men looked at the healer with a question prominent in his eyes. Are you sure about this? Harry almost heard it coming only from the workers eyes. So he gave a curt nod before preparing mentally for the picture behind the door. He closed his eyes to shut out one of his senses, enough to make his body relax for a few seconds. The healers ears registered clicking and sounds of gravel scraping over the floor by the heavy door, which was being opened by the dementor.
"I thought it would suit you. With your name meaning dragon and all.", Harry whispered, his fingers caressing Draco's thigh with a dreamy look. The taller man placed a small kiss on Harry's lips, searching for his favorite eyes to look into his.
"I don't care Ron. We need to have a talk.", Harry breathed out through clenched teeth, great pain visible on his every feature. Even though Ron didn't look all too pleased, he pushed his best friend in a separate room and into a chair. Possibly a break room. And a bloody uncomfortable chair.
"Don't look at me like I would break apart from a visit to Azkaban. Look at my patient rather. I'm surprised he is not dead! They really treat the people there like scum!", he explained furiously, one hand gesturing wildly while the other wrote down several potions. Tara dared to look at the man laying in the bed just now, clasping a hand over her mouth in shock. She never saw a person who looked like this. Something you would see coming from one of these terrible Muggle horror movies, not in the real world. But this was very much real, the young woman had trouble keeping her lunch down at the sight.
The determination must have shown on his face, because Malfoy eyed his schoolmate with suspicion at the change of expression. Thoughts that all looked like 'What have I done wrong?' flashed behind silver eyes. Harry smiled reassuringly at his patient, giving him a gentle squeeze to his body. "You did nothing wrong, Malfoy. My thoughts just wandered to the near future, when I healed everything I can. I'm afraid that not everybody will be very enthusiastic to have you as their patient and I don't really trust any of the Mind Healers and Physiotherapist around here. But I must do... something. Not sure what exactly, yet."
"What a brave bloody boy you are, Draco. Living up fully to your name, huh?", he asked grinning, patting the blonde's shoulder all the while with pride. Draco started smiling, too, proud about the compliment.
"Thank you, Tilius. Please restrain from staring Healer Potter down like that. I am quite sure he has enough people goggling at him on a daily basis."
"Hello. My name is Harry, I am the healer you are supposed to meet before getting out of here. Is the light okay like that?"
A sigh escaped Draco's lips as he moved the wild strands of hair out of the boys face. "I'm glad you ran away. I have no idea what we'll do now, but that's another problem."
Draco slowly pointed to his ribs with a wrinkled nose, most likely from the movement he had to make. Broken ribs were truly a pain in the ass, you weren't able to move or to breath correctly. Everything just hurt. But this was maybe the weirdest of Malfoy's injuries. You don't just break your ribs by sitting in a corner. There were exactly two possibilities. One: Malfoy had a fight with someone. Two: Someone has beaten him up. A guy who couldn't even breath without pain was beaten up by a ward most likely. Second version was highly more likely, because there was nothing Malfoy could have probably done to cause a fight. He couldn't move, he couldn't speak, he couldn't even breath. As soon as realization hit Harry, a deep growl escaped his throat. Whoever did this will get punished.
There was no more space between them, a sheet of paper wouldn't fit, so close were their chest pressed together as Draco wished for Harry to close the distance of their mouths and finally kissed him. But, apparently, the bastard was in the mood for teasing as he let his breath ghost over lips, cheeks and lashes, before settling at a ear shell and teeth gently pulled at his earlobe. Draco almost sighed needily, almost rolled his hips into the other's as he clearly felt a building erection on his thigh, just as much as he was sure Harry felt his. Instead, he carefully undid Harry's helmet, purposefully letting his fingers touch a lot more of the exposed throat than necessary, and pulled the heavy piece off the other's head. Draco could feel Harry smile besides him, lips moving from his ear and gently mouthing down his jaw and throat, causing Draco's knees to almost buckle beneath him.
Harry smiled somewhat proudly at the boy and gently squeezed his knee. A loud groan came from the other room and Harry suddenly realized he had to act immediately. Quickly he stood up and smiled nervously at the boy.
. "Harry... is that a full on Harvey?", he asked slowly, adrenaline already pumping through his veins. He had always wanted to ride one of these, but to his father it wasn't 'classy' enough.
A small surprised laugh escaped Draco, though he leaned in closer to his new found source of safety. "Elegant and posh. Quite suits a dragon, doesn't it?", Draco mumbled, opening one of the small glass bottles with nail polish in them. He chose a silver to suit the decor of Harry's Christmas tree and painted his nails quite fast and neatly for that pace. Satisfied, Draco blew at them and elegantly closed the bottle again. Harry caught his lip in beneath his teeth, eyeing Draco hungrily.
"A ward did this?", he mumbled with narrowed eyes, ripping open his dirty shirt to reveal the injury. What he saw quickly became one of the most horrific things he would ever see. Malfoy's ribs weren't broken to the inside, like a punch would cause them to. No, they were broken to the outside, meaning someone grabbed Malfoy by his ribs as he was nothing more than a skeleton and pulled so hard that they bloody broke.
The young male smiled with an apologizing look in his eyes, before running off again. Possibly to continue his work. Harry was used to people staring at him. His whole life at Hogwarts, people used to stare him down for being The-Boy-Who-Lived. After killing Voldemort the whole Wizarding World came up with names as 'The Savior' or 'The Chosen One', when seriously the only title Harry ever wanted to be called by was 'Healer'. Healer Harry Potter. This title he had earned himself, he was, in fact, a bloody good Healer. And he was extremly proud of having achieved to be in the ranks of the Healers, even with his fairly bad marks over most of his school years. Nevertheless, in his eighth year, Harry pulled through and graduated with excellent marks in every subject, mostly thanks to Hermione's incredible teaching skills. After that, Harry was able to build a life of his own, by exceeding every expectation in his Healer training, working with great effort and refraining from all the easy ways people prepared for him. He bought his own tiny flat from his own money, not taking what his parents have left him in their vault. And after all the work he put into making his life individual and something he could be proud of, all people saw were the headlines of
"I lost my beautiful muse and now I have to see it bitching around with Mister Potter. Do you really think I'd let you go that easily my little whore?"
"Oh shut it woman. Robards took it in for some inspections after I brought that Bradshaw guy in.", Ron explained, sitting down on a chair Hermione transfigured for him out of a plant standing on the window sill. "It was weird though. The guy didn't say a single word. He just let me arrest him as if he did nothing wrong. But, well, he obviously did. Maybe he just accepted his fate.", he continued, handing Harry one of the boxes and Draco a full can of soup. Indeed, the little fighting worried Harry as well, not as much as the way he had looked at Draco though. There was something wordlessly communicated between the two, it felt like a last promise or last order. Harry couldn't tell. But he was more than ready to find out. Surprisingly, Draco ignored the talking about Bradshaw, and instead threw Ron a suspicious glance after being handed the can, as if he might try to poison him. After not receiving any reaction from anyone, he carefully decided to try the soup. The way his face lit up was almost comical.
Immediately did not only suddenly the dog turn into a fully grown man, but another man sprinted down the stairs, face one of fury as the shape-shifting guy cried out and stumbled out. "You'll pay for that, Prongs!", the man screamed over his shoulder, quickly making turns to escape the other man.
A small glance to the side showed Draco that Harry was giving him a gentle smile, encouraging the blonde through a wink and squeeze to the arm. To show his confidence once more, Harry moved his arm from where the two were linked to Draco's waist. He pulled the taller to his side possessivly, a playful glint in his eyes. The contact gave Draco the comfort he needed to hold his chin high and his hand on Harry's neck as they walked straight to Harry's boss. At least Draco assumed he was, as he was the oldest and most surrounded man on the party.
The frown of confusion on Harry's face was absolutely worth taking a sneaky look on Harry's ID when the officers asked for it. Draco now gave Harry a kiss on lips and a wink, before turning around and joining Teddy on the floor.
The embrace broke only when Harry felt a puddle of water forming beneath his legs, the bathtub was overflowing. The Gryffindor quickly stopped the water with a flick of his wand and vanished the puddle. Malfoy rubbed the back of his hand over his eyes, sniffing silently. Both of them simultaneously started searching for the others gaze and when their eyes locked, they gave a small smile. Not in the need for words, Harry carefully lifted Malfoy into the bathtub.
The Healer opened his mouth in disbelief, shocked about a stranger making fun of him for his appearance. Even though he may really look like a walking corpse, strangers never made fun of him. He was, after all, the Savior of the Wizarding World and quite a celebrity. People usually refrained from talking anything but polite to him, the only ones making fun were Ron and his coworkers. But this women definitely had some of Malfoy's attitude.
"The man hasn't talked for three years now. Some day he would stop walking around and just sat there, never moved... not even once. Not even to get his food or anything. Once every two weeks someone casts a cleaning charm on the prisoners. We only know he lives because his eyes move sometimes.", the smaller man explained, looking as if the person truly got on his nerves. Harry nodded in understatement, moving to the corner he started to see a figure in.
A furious growl left the Healer's throat, sounding more like a Humgarian Horntail than a human being. "Don't talk about him like that.", he snapped, wave of magic almost kicking Ron off his feet. "I was called to Azkaban for a job. Decided to go so noone else had to visit that hellhole. I ended up finding Draco,
Truth behold, even in those moments he didn't feel safe. Probably a thing, which came with being on the run for a year. Those embraces never made him feel completely safe. Comforted at best, but not safe.
"Pleasure, my dear cousin. Such a great family reunion, isn't it? Next time we should invite Bella, too."
The tears running down Draco's cheeks probably reflected the same emotions, though they caused worry in Harry and his loving oh so perfect eyes.
"My cousin! He's a small boy, Nott had him for the past years. The bastard blackmailed me by hurting Teddy if I did something against his wishes. Like that, he had me under control even though I was too old. Good lord they will kill Teddy if they find out what we did!"
"I'm glad you had the time for this quick meeting. We need a healer for some... business at Azkaban. We can't give you full input just yet, but there is a prisoner who is supposed to get free this Sunday. All of this was very sudden and we had to find out that the prisoner has some sort of injury, inquiring a healer to look at it before we can let him free. So we need a volunteer to do this job. Who of you is sane enough to visit the absolute darkest cells of Azkaban without going crazy?"
The next morning arrived way faster than Harry expected. Yellow and orange light flooded the entrance hall, where the Healer settled down after finishing off his patients. Outside the sun was already rising, an indicator for the time already being around 6 am. And Harry hasn't slept a second this night. A big yawn escaped his lips as soon as he settled into his office chair, sliding down to hide behind his pile of work. Besides him a small dark haired witch placed her jacket on the back of her chair, a calculating expression on her face. Tara poked her coworkers cheek, who was fast asleep after his yawn and startled him awake again. Harry groaned silently before opening his left eye, his usual cheery attitude being kind of down.
Draco smiled, knowing where his mother's thoughts were going. "You want to celebrate your anniversary at the place he proposed to you.", both of them smiled. "Go and have your romantic walk, mother. If anyone deserves it, it surely is you."
"How I treat my patients is nothing of your concern, Sir. It's a true wonder Mister Malfoy is still alive in this condition. Him being someone I have known for many years gives all of this a very personal touch. I always care for my patients, but even more for my friends.", he paused to guide Draco out of the cell and into the hallway, glaring at the man before continuing. "I want the names of the wards who guarded him the past two weeks. I will personally make sure the person who treats another human like that gets their deserved punishment. Where is my port key?"
With these words a yawn escaped Harry's lips, a clear sign to make his way home and into the warm comfort of his bed. Malfoy smiled and waved at Harry, left hand holding the one of Madame Allard. Harry smiled back at his patient, bowed shortly and left the room to escape through the staff floo.
Harry slowly exhaled after reading everything carefully. Underlined parts were the most dangerous one for the moment being, apart from his incredibly low weight. The man in front of him didn't even weigh more than a child. Admiration for such strength built in Harry's chest as he looked into Malfoy's eyes for minutes without talking. Then he carefully squeezed his hand with a sad smile.
"Do you always treat your patients like this, Mister Potter?", the bigger man asked through gritted teeth, hatred filling his ugly brown eyes.
The smile was back on Harry's face as soon as he stood back up to get the potion and lists. The little boy was incredibly sweet and clever, trying to comfort his parents after he was diagnosed with a rather life changing illness. Children were truly something too good for this cruel world.
A snort left Harry's lips at the same second as Draco's, they almost shoved their middle finger into Ron's direction too. To Harry's luck, Draco seemingly understood his plan and played along, not looking to the door at all. As if he was talking to Malfoy instead of Ron, Harry started combing his fingers through the blond strands, untangling some knots and massaging his scalp. Meanwhile, he started talking to Ron without turning around.
"Never in a million years. No dates with coworkers, first rule of all. Right before being professional with patients."
"Malfoy this really isn't a big deal anymore. You will sleep peacefully and dream of something good and when you wake up you can eat as much ice cream as you want and most likely you'll be able to talk better again then. In some days we have to plan your back-surgery, too. If you ever want to walk again that is.", the Healer explained with a friendly smile. Of course Malfoy has always been a coward, he saw that in the war, but talking to him like he did to his smaller patients was another thing. When he saw the uncertainty in Malfoy's eyes he gently squeezed the other man's arm and smiled. "You don't have to decide anything yet. Maybe we can bring somebody to help with your decision? It might help."
"Let's go upstairs. They surely are done with talking.", he whispered, pulling his friend closer to the stairs. Draco followed without discussion, holding dearly onto Harry's hand.
He hesitated, one second, two seconds. He heard his heart beating in his ears, blood rushing everywhere. He breathed. In, out. In, out. And he knelt down in front of Malfoy, one hand on his bare knee, the other wiping away tears. And with tears on his own cheeks he pulled Malfoy in for an embrace, strong and steady. Malfoy buried his face in the crook of Harry's neck, nails digging into midnight hair. "It's alright Malfoy. You're doing so good. Don't be afraid, I got you.", he whispered into Malfoy's ear, gently combing his fingers through thick knots of platinum blond hair. And like that they stayed, for how long, they both didn't know.
will make sure he doesn't come near you.", he explained, fingers caressing Malfoy's pointy chin. Each tear that dropped from Draco's eyes, Harry whiped away with extreme care.
The Healer closed his eyes to suppress the rage and magic still burning through his veins. Truly, he didn't feel any of this since shortly after the war.
"Oh, come on Tara, do fuck off. Be so kind and not talk about any boners at my workplace.", he demanded, voice wavering and cheeks flaming red. His coworker started laughing like some sort of hyena, happy to make her
There were words lingering on Draco's lips he wasn't quite ready to speak out yet, but alone the fact he was about ready to throw them casually at his date were enough to make his eyes sting.
Winter. What a great fucking time of the year. No sun is shining most of the days, wind blows icy snow into your face and the temperature is freezing in general. So, all in all, it's the perfect time to stand outside in skin-tight leather trousers without a shirt. Sometimes, Draco wondered how he didn't freeze to death already. Small snowflakes clung to his almost as white hair, damping it enough to make it clutch to his forehead. The streets were almost empty, except for some sappy romantic couples that were holding hands and throwing snow on each other with deafening high screeches. Hence the blond male crossed his long arms in front of his chest to shield himself a little bit from the freezing wind, all with a rather disgusted look on his face. Still, he tried to subdue the trembling of his limbs, which were slowly going numb through the low temperature and missing clothes. It wasn't really arousing to anyone to see a shivering guy with a running nose at the edge of the street, which was Draco's goal after all. The problem was, one day before Christmas no guy was in need or able to get himself a call boy from the streets. Most married men, who were his main customers, had dinner with their lousy family and wife they didn't love to make the impression of a perfect family. Only a few days after Christmas the steady flow of customers renewed, thanks to the boring every-day-life of said men.
A tiny flutter of hope caused Draco to immediately open the door and sit on the heated leather seats of the car. His skin felt like icy burning needles penetrated it, the feeling you get when you go from extremely cold to hot in a matter of seconds. The insides of the car were heated like he imagined a house would be in winter. A relieved sigh escaped his slightly blue lips, his muscles relaxed into the warm leather. Mister Rich Guy With Glasses meanwhile looked at him through the rear mirror. Draco had no idea where this guy would take him, most likely to the next hotel, so he decided to fully cost out every second of this little trip.
"You sneaked out? On your own? Are you crazy Teddy?", he whispered, inspecting the younger for any injuries. But the small boy only grinned at him, eyes sparkling in the light.
"I didn't oversee anything. I just normally don't come to events like this with male company. Even though I am very much gay. Made it easier to keep it professional. But I stopped caring when I met you today. So, bear with me through this evening?"
"Well, you are behaving like a teenager with a crush and an anger problem.", Hermione stated, her voice strong and steady. Mione was the only person on this planet talking him down like that without being afraid. And Harry needed it.
His two best friends sitting in a room with Draco Malfoy, sharing their food with him, having a civil interaction, was something beyond Harry's imagination. Yet, he was sitting right in the middle of it and, honestly, couldn't complain about it, now that he started caring for Malfoy. He always had, Harry guessed, but not in the same way as now. Now, it felt as if Draco was the air Harry breathed, the only thing keeping him from drowning in a sea full of darkness. Maybe he did feel something similar in school, a certain energy pulling them together in the worst possible manner existing. But it always has been there. Now, stronger than ever before. And Harry didn't mind it. He didn't mind it at all.
The younger nodded and complied, opening another small package. There was a soft pink color to Harry's cheeks as he handed it to Draco. To the blonde's surprise, there was a set of nail polish and make up in it, something any girl would love to possess. There was surprise written on Draco's face, but mainly because he thought that was a thing he could have scared Harry away with.
Draco chuckled lightly, remembering the old woman telling him she would work long enough at the bakery to see him get equally beautiful children as he himself had been. "May I talk to her then?"
When, after several moments, the laughter burned down into a soft chuckle, Draco drew a few deep breaths, trying to curl his smile down. "Please... please tell me the snowman has been your idea.", he pressed out, chuckling some more as slowly, very slowly, understandment dawned on Harry's face.
The Ministry was, as always, filled with dozens of people, all rushing around and small enchanted paper planes flew around to deliver messages. The picture reminded Harry of third or fourth year, he could never tell when these things happened, when Malfoy blew a paper bird into his direction. It wasn't a plane like these, but it had a similar function. Back then, he was annoyed. Now, he wanted to see that cocky smile on Malfoy's lips again. Without the pain in his eyes.
A reporter caught eye of Harry, moving quickly into his direction. To avoid people to notice, The-Boy-Who-Lived pulled his hat down more and hurried into the other direction to the elevators. One of the doors stood open, so he quickly moved inside and the door closed behind him. Nothing more than a small breath of relief left Harry's lips, as he waited for the elevator to take him to his desired location.
Harry gave a curt nod before following the two men, still followed by this horrific creature. There was a long silence until they reached the fifth negative level.
"We have to get back to the ship. Padfoot wants a personal chat with Lucius and he hates to wait.", Harry threw in, eyeing the small family with worry. Especially Draco looked rather scared, not really excited about the idea of getting outside and onto a pirate ship. Therefore, the young pirate walked over to him with a sweet smile, head cocked to the side, he said. "Don't worry champ. Nobody will hurt you or your parents, I promise. You can stay right by my side while they chat and I show you around the ship if you want.", lopsided grin on his lips. Draco's working eye looked into his with startling earnestness, searching for a hint of a lie. But when he didn't find any, he slowly walked over to Harry and grabbed his sleeve. Remus shot Harry a thankful glance, a little bit of pride mixed in between. The taller boy exhaled slowly, before taking the little hand of Draco in his own to lead him outside, right after finding some shoes for him. Remus and Peter walked beside Lucius and Narcissa, one on each side. While Pettigrew still held his cutlass to Lucius' throat, just to make sure nothing funny happened, Remus engaged Narcissa into some sort of small talk, about what education Draco got. Apparently, the young boy would never go to school, for teachers being unable to teach a partly blind kid. Nobody had the nerves. She tried her best to teach her son herself, but she wasn't educated to teach. Harry frowned at the conversation. Nobody liked the outsiders. Society didn't. But on their ship, on the rough sea, it didn't matter how much of an outsider you were. It was only you against nature. A never ending fight, man against the depth of the sea, a monster that only waited for people to stumble into it. To swallow them.
Sweatdrops clung to Harry's forehead as he finally threw open the door to Ron's office. Two heads immediately whipped into his direction, one even more surprised than the other. Ron, on the one hand, look surprised about Harry being in his office as his best friend never dared to set foot into the Ministry, while on the other hand Blaise Zabini hasn't seen Harry since school, even though he was Ron's partner at work since Auror training.
Draco nodded eagerly, a wide smile spreading over his face. "I can give you the address. It would be lovely to be picked up by you at seven.", he answered, just to make sure what he had heard was, indeed, really what Harry had said. Speaking from his shiteating grin, Harry definently said just what Draco thought he heard.
"Merlin, Malfoy. You really have to get back your voice. I won't be able to take you seriously with these sounds.", he started, eyes watery from laughing and a little out of breath. He hasn't laughed so good in a while.
"Where on earth are you taking me?!", he yelled at the driver, fear audible in his voice. Of all the things that happened in this job, his worst fear still was to be taken out somewhere and being killed by some psychotic bastard, like many of his colleagues were. Nobody would know who he was, nobody would miss him. Just another unidentified victim in a cold case folder of some police station.
How can people be so gruesome? How can a human being, which works, which has a family, probably even kids, hurt a defenseless man in such horrific ways. Harry did not kill a Dark Lord and did not die in the process, only for people to act how not even the darkest wizard of all time dared to.
"I wanted to. It's your first real Christmas and Teddy needed some stuff anyways. We can't dress him in my shirts forever.", Harry replied, squeezing Draco carefully. Draco sighed, shaking his head fondly at the other.
There was a sparkle coming from Malfoy's eyes, something that immediately reminded Harry of Quidditch. The former Slytherin always has held this exact sparkle in his eyes, when he has been determined on winning against Gryffindor, chin raised high into the air. The smile creeping onto Harry's lips was nothing but triumph. If this sparkle was still there, then Malfoy was not completely gone. He wasn't broken. With that thought in mind, Harry cocked his head to the right side, challenge written all over his face. He almost forgot how to get under his nemesis' skin, but now he remembered. Malfoy needed the thrill, needed the picking.
"Today? Are you serious? How am I supposed to-... God fine! I'll be there. Yeah. Bye.", Harry ended the call with a hateful look to the small electronic device, as if it was reason for every misery he had to endure. Draco looked at him with a questioning look and the shorter caught on. "My boss. He wants me to show up at a Christmas dinner party with some important people from New York. With a date. Today.", a groan escaped his lips. "Sometimes I wish I could quit."
"Darling, that's a bit too much.", she drawled, eyes glued to the five bills he had dropped next to the boxes.
So, the empty streets weren't anything new nor suprising, but still left Draco with a problem: No money. No money meant no place to sleep, no food, no warmth and a possible death through winter storms. Fucking great. How he loved the winters in London.
Instead of looking offended, Malfoy merely nodded and moved up into an upright sitting position, head cocked slightly at Harry. The raven haired shook his head with a smile, kneeling next to Malfoy to be in a better position for his mission. Harry carefully rubbed some of the body wash they kept in the hospital between his hands, before starting at stroking slowly over Malfoy's arms. As Malfoy was probably hurting all over his body, Harry used the opportunity to give the ex-prisoner a gentle massage, pressing his fingers slightly into the few muscles left on the fragile body between his hands. The Slytherin didn't seem to mind at all, in fact, he closed his eyes again and just relaxed into the touch. That was until Harry reached the blonde's chest, where he slightly flinched and moved away from Harry. The black haired had only felt the hardness of ribs beneath his hands, enough to get an idea why Malfoy was so afraid. Option one, those broken ribs hurt again, option two, he was ashamed of the rest of his body. Harry couldn't really blame him, probably everyone would react this way.
It took the young healer several seconds to get out of his unconsciousness again. Ron had a look of serious concern on his face. "Harry, we go to Mungo's. You haven't had one of those for years. Mione will kill me if I don't bring you to the hospital after such an attack."
"So. I hope you're happy with him. Or, if you guys broke up, I hope you'll find happiness soon. I've found mine. Not the one I was looking for, or the one I wanted - but it's still happiness. If, four years ago, you would've asked me what happiness felt like, my answer would've been you. My answer still hasn't changed. It's still you. Accompanied by a few other names, too, though. I've made progress. I'm growing. I met a lot of people. I had sex. I still miss you. Maybe not like before, but I miss you. I always thought you were my happy ending. Maybe I don't get a happy ending. I hope you get one. You deserve it." He withdrew a breath. He was holding back tears.
They sent texts back and forth till it was time for Draco to get on his plane. Harry felt empty, so fucking empty. And it wasn't the same emptiness he felt when his goldfish had died, or when he had to move schools, or when his best friends ditched him on his birthday. No, this felt worse.
And for a second, I wanted to pretend it was real. Yeah. I could do that. We don't have to be divorced right now. I could imagine we were still together.
My heart was now racing a million times a second. Harry giggled - literally giggled - and squeezed my hand.
I nodded, smiling big at the memory, "Yes! But then he got happy because if we could make a baby, we would have never met him."
"You will see him again. I'll make sure of it. I'll even fly you to France if I have to. It's going to be okay. You'll be okay."
Harry propped himself up on his elbows, facing Draco. He felt his breath hitch in his throat and his eyes water. Draco gently caressed his lover's cheeks, leaning up to kiss his soft lips. "Don't cry," Draco whispered, holding back his own tears.
"Daddy and I decided it was best if we keep distance for a bit." It pained me to say those words, because if it was up to me, I'd never wanna leave Harry's side again.
I felt Harry looking at me. With a lump in my throat, I told Pax, "Let me get your stuff first, okay? We'll talk about that when I get back."
I groaned as I pushed all of Paxey's books in his backpack. I didn't know if I was supposed to bring clothes or not, because I knew Harry had a closet just for Pax. I brought his school uniform, though, cause I wasn't sure if Harry had one of those. I also brought Pax's favourite pair of shoes. I didn't know if I should've brought something for me to sleep in, cause technically Harry didn't invite me to spend the night, and I didn't wanna look like I was inviting myself in.
"I miss him, mum. I miss him so much already." He tugged on her sleeves as if his life depended on it. He felt so weak and vulnerable. So fragile.
"Um, well. Yes. Technically, we're divorced." I could tell Harry was surprised by Paxton's response.
Harry was pretty sure he had just let his soulmate go. He was beating himself up for not putting up a harder fight, for not trying enough to make him stay. He felt so stupid. His thoughts were all over the place, and he just needed someone to talk to. He just needed Draco.
I followed him inside. This felt.. weird. I never thought I'd have tea in my ex-husband's house. I never thought I'd even have an ex-husband. Or a child. Or even just a husband.
"I don't know. A bit less than a year." He can't remember a time he felt genuine happiness during that year. Sometimes, when he misses him the most, he would close his eyes and try to remember how his arms felt wrapped around his waist. He would try to remember how his hair felt between his fingers. He would even sometimes try to remember how warm Draco's laugh had once been.
They haven't spoken since their phone encounter, almost two years ago. Yet, Harry can't stop thinking about him. Of course, nobody knows that. Everyone thinks he's happy, but that's because he is. Except when he's all alone and it's midnight and he's staring at their pictures together.
"I am. I am happy for you. Congratulations." He hung up the phone so fast he felt it slipping from his hands.
"It's okay. He'll get tired eventually. Would you like some tea?" Harry, my ex-husband, asked me. I nodded, and kept looking back at our kid frantically chasing Harry's dog.
Everything he said that night was true. Who knew a bit of alcohol and sad songs would get him to open up like never before?
We went into his room, and I changed into more comfortable clothes in the bathroom - I didn't bring my own clothes, so I borrowed some of his.
"Yeah, sure. We can do that. Besides," I looked out at Pax, who was having a very heated conversation with the dog, "I think even Cosmo likes him here."
"We won't lose this. It doesn't matter if we're miles apart, I'm never letting you go." Draco brought Harry's hand up to his lips and kissed his knuckles. "And, who knows, maybe one day when we're older we could actually, you know-"
I don't know why that made me feel things. Things I told myself I should never feel again. We were divorced, for fuck's sake.
We turned the TV on, but didn't really watch any. I could see Harry was lost deep in thought, and I was lost in how gorgeous he was. I wondered why or how someone could be so beautiful. His curls fell perfectly on his forehead, and his glasses were perched graciously on his nose, threatening to fall down. His eyes were fixed nowhere in particular, and his brows furrowed. His pink lips were pursed in thought, and I felt like kissing him then and there.
"Potter's back?" Draco asked, eyeing the room and spotting the loud Bulstrode cousin heading his way.
And, okay, it's not exactly what Harry had in mind but he can't really complain, later, when he and Draco are lying in bed and he can still taste chocolate and berries on his tongue.
Still, it rankled that word was spreading throughout the room about Harry's obvious absence. He could see Elise with a group of mothers eyeing him from across the room. He'd already gotten and accepted two invitations to dance and had been asked twice when Harry would be arriving. Now, Draco leaned against the wall, playing with the necklace in his pocket, thinking about what he should and shouldn't do. He hadn't seen the Weasleys all evening either, and he was just starting to talk himself down from anger to worry, when he caught sight of Bill Weasley's long red hair.
"What kept you?" Draco asked, not wanting his thoughts to stray to dangerous places. "I expected you to call much earlier than this. You are madly in love with me after all."
Harry allows it for a moment, lost in the way Draco's pushing against him, small insistent steps forward as though he wants to get as close to Harry as possible. He's warm and alive under Harry's hands and there's nothing that Harry wants more than to lay Draco out on his bed and get lost in the way he feels. But he had a plan—wonderfully prepped, guaranteed to work—and he can't help but push once more.
Back then, there'd been nothing in his life that belonged to him alone. Everywhere he turned, he saw the influence of someone else. He'd been training to be an Auror because Ron was doing it, because of course, he had to be there if Ron was willing to continue the fight. He'd been dating Ginny because if he married her, he'd belong to the Weasley family permanently. Unequivocally.
Draco looked offended until he caught sight of the smile on Harry's face. It was no secret that the Malfoys had lost a large part of their fortune after the War but even so, they remained among the rich families of Wizarding society. Though these days, Fred and George Weasley were giving everyone a run for their money.
Harry hadn't understood what Ron had meant until they'd walked into Parkinson Manor and he saw all the people. Ginny, in her silver dress robes and unadorned ringlets, had been clearly underdressed. Mrs Weasley had taken a look around the room and the next thing Harry knew, she had her wand in her hand and was pointing it at Ginny. When the tiara had materialized in front of them, Ginny had made a run for it. The evening so far had consisted of Ginny carefully making her way around the room in an attempt to avoid her mother, while Mrs Weasley vacillated between catching Ginny and nabbing matches for her other children.
"Oh, but she had to," Pansy said, turning wide disbelieving eyes on him. "You must know you've always been the one to beat, Draco. There are no more Blacks of note and after the House of Black, the Malfoys are the most well-connected and influential of all pureblood Wizarding families. The name still means something, even if you do find yourself with much tighter purse strings these days."
Draco stood his ground, drawing himself up to full height so that he was just that one inch taller than Harry. They were about the same build, basically the same height. Even if there was much difference in their physical power, they were both wizards, both had wands. Harry would even go as far as to say that he and Draco might be evenly matched.
Harry grinned, pushing back his messy hair with one hand, tousling it just so. "They call it The Draco," he said.
He'd do anything to know the warmth of Draco's skin beneath his lips, to hear the sounds he'd make when Harry had him laid out on a bed. He'd give Draco the world for just a moment alone, away from prying eyes and the looming sense of responsibility that came with Wizarding society. Harry would give him whatever he wanted. And so, he knew it was time to let him go. Better to end things before anyone got hurt. Better to have Draco marry someone else than to go back on the promises Harry had made to himself.
Draco turned fully towards Harry, an eyebrow raised as he met Harry's eyes. "Want me to wear your jewellery, Potter?"
"It's a privacy spell of sorts," Draco said. "Before the War, the Parkinsons used it to confuse the Aurors when they came to check the house for Dark objects."
Instead, he settles down onto the sofa, intending to watch the movie through to its end, when he feels Draco nudging him with his foot.
Harry's grin was slow and self-satisfied as he held out his arm again. "You were saying about Blaise?"
His hands are hard on Harry's back, his legs wrapped around Harry's thighs. He feels good, warm and welcoming, the harsh sounds of his breaths letting Harry know that he's enjoying the slow drag of it. Outside, the day is cool, their open window blowing in the smells of early fall rain. September is a good month because it means that there's a lull in departmental investigations into Improper Use of Magic as students head back to Hogwarts. It means that Draco's here with Harry, asking him to go slower, to really make him feel it.
Harry watches him go, helplessly. "Merlin knows why I love you," he says, shaking his head. "But I do."
Harry eyed the group of young women closest to him. "People are looking at me like they want to eat me," he said.
He could practically feel the interested looks from the group of mother's across the room. Mrs Weasly was among them, a contemplative look in her eyes as she looked from Harry to Charlie and back. It didn't matter that Charlie didn't want to get married. Mrs Weasley was on a hunt for decent matches for her children and there was little anyone could do to stop her.
The moment stretches as Harry stands by the kitchen doorway, then it stretches some more as Harry waits for Draco's reaction.
The second section contained a small fountain surrounded by lilies in unnatural shades, vibrant greens and blues intermixed with bright oranges and pale pinks. At the edges were golden flowers shining like new metal. Their leaves rustled in the wind, bending the plant almost in half. Even so, the flowers themselves remained unchanged, unbothered by the elements as they gleamed under the moon. They were gold like the flowers Harry had brought on his first visit to the Manor. Gold like the jewellery he'd brought Narcissa, elegant pieces that had gone to her because they couldn't go to Draco. Not when their relationship had been a farce meant to benefit both of them. Harry had always been clear about boundaries, Draco realised, as he continued past the third garden section. It was his own fault that he'd read more into the situation than he should have.
Harry did know. He'd been gone for years, away from Wizarding society with nothing but the countryside and the little Muggle town with its single pub. He'd spent many nights there drinking and getting to know the people in the area. He wasn't Harry Potter, Wizarding Britain's Greatest War Hero, there. He was just another young man out to cause trouble.
Draco throws an arm around Harry's shoulders and pulls him closer, kisses him, hot and eager. He's trembling and willing, and Harry can feel that tightness in his chest, an ache that rests somewhere behind his sternum. He doesn't know how he could he ever begin to explain the way the world narrows down for a moment on the curve of Draco's mouth, on his face and all the changing expressions.
He moved his hand up and down his cock, imagining Harry's mouth on him, that voice right next to his ear, telling him all the things he'd ever done to other men. He could imagine Harry on him, pushing his legs apart, sliding his hips close. He knew how things were supposed to go, knew Harry would work him open slowly, competently.
Hermione does a lot of official note-taking. Harry doesn't say that he still has no idea why they even need the Department of Intoxicating Substances at a meeting about Azkaban. Bartholomew makes a lot of snide comments. And Draco avoids Harry's eye the entire meeting. All in all, it's not a bad outcome and though they run past regular office hours, by the time everyone heads home, Harry feels like they've accomplished something.
He sighed, leaning against the pillar by the entrance. Ron stood to his left, slouching against the wall in his messy dress robes. Ron was doing it on purpose, ruffling his hair so that it wouldn't lie flat, so that it was obvious he didn't belong with the rest of the group. Harry, on the other hand, wore neat midnight-blue dress robes and his hair, so often unruly, lay tamed for once. He stood at attention next to Ron, tension running across his shoulders as he did his best to look without being seen.
He hadn't known just how angry he was that Harry hadn't been present for most of the night until Harry was in front of him. Lady Red had made a big deal about his and Harry's courtship, publishing piece after piece about all the flowers Draco had received. There had been an entire section dedicated to their potential wedding date the day before, and Narcissa had even started making comments about what theme Draco might like for his wedding. And now that they were meant to attend their first event since their official fake courtship had started, Harry hadn't shown up the entire night. Draco just knew that tomorrow there would be an article about how he'd lost Harry Potter's interest, how Draco might not be as interesting as Lady Red and Harry Potter had originally thought.
Draco seemed to consider the idea momentarily, and why shouldn't he? Harry knew that if ever married, the most logical choice would be to marry into the Weasley family. He already considered them family, already spent the holidays with them, already suppressed crushes on various members of the Weasley family. If he were looking to get married, he'd pick any Weasley who would have him. If he were Draco, he'd do the same.
He calculated that he had perhaps a minute to get away, what with the large gathering of people on the dance floor and the groups off to the sides. He could finish his conversation with Pansy and still have some time to follow the flow of people to the exits. He was done for the night, as there was little more he could do after Lady Red's paper this morning. He was from a family of Death Eaters, disgraced and desperate for a good match, and esteemed as the Malfoy name might have once been, there was little less attractive than a desperate debutant.
They clearly weren't alone and their audience was just growing in size the longer they stood there. But Harry wasn't about to contradict Mrs Abbott when she looked ready to murder him on the spot should he even twitch in the wrong direction. He eyed the door to his left and saw someone step purposefully in front of it. He was effectively trapped by a group of overeager mothers, and just as he had resigned himself to spending the next couple of hours politely declining courtship proposals, he heard a familiar voice call his name.
He didn't have to give back to the Muggles, didn't have to send his children out into a world that would expect great things from them. Whatever children he might have in the Wizarding World would always carry the burden of his name and be victims of the trauma that came from being a child caught in the middle of a war. He wasn't ready for parenthood. He didn't think he ever would be. But the Wizarding World wanted it from him like they wanted his attention and his time, his devotion to their causes.
He sighed. He could feel his mother's concerned gaze even as they walked. He didn't want her pity just yet, didn't want the burden of her sorrow when he finally explained that he and Harry had broken off their courtship. It'd be better to let her think that he called off the courtship because someone else had caught his interest, better that she believe Gregory was a love match. She'd always wonder, but his mother had always cared more about his happiness than she cared about him nabbing the greatest catch of the season.
Draco didn't twitch, though every inch of himself was focused on Pansy's words. She was obviously talking about Potter, but the Wizarding World hadn't heard from him since the end of the trials, five years ago. He'd simply said his piece and had disappeared from Wizarding society. No one knew exactly where he went, and Weasley and Granger had remained tight-lipped about the whole thing.
