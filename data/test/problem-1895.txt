“Never learned much about Muggle things, Father…” Draco trailed off. “Well, nevermind. Interesting that that’s what you wanted to do... Now you can fly anytime you like.”
“Avery’s so thick he actually thinks I’m going to help him, he’s hardly a threat. I still don’t understand why-”
“You only won by five pins! If I hadn’t been distracted that one time, I would have had that spare!”
“Sorry Pans, we’ve already tried that, and I’m afraid you’ve got all the wrong bits.” Draco smirked up at her. “Besides, you can’t get in the way of true love!” He leaned in and planted a dramatic kiss on Cy’s cheek.
Harry was in Diagon Alley. It looked to be early evening. Harry was never in Diagon anymore, not if he could avoid it. He tried to get his bearings. He could see Gringotts, The Magical Menagerie, Flourish and Blott’s...Then he heard a woman shriek in the direction of Mulpepper’s. He turned to see Draco walking out of the shop with his purchases, clearly just running an errand after work.
Draco felt as if he’d been slapped, but still, he persevered. He needed Harry to understand. “I can explain, you don’t—”
“I keep telling you, it pays to buy,” she said, wiggling her own very adorable white-and-red striped bowling shoes.
He watched himself speed up as Draco clawed desperately at his back, grasping his arse and helping slam Harry’s hips against his. He saw himself come, pushing himself in to the hilt with a groan and shuddering as he filled Draco with everything he had.  Draco kissed his cheek, his jaw, his shoulder and nuzzled into his neck again as Harry grew soft inside him and fell asleep.
,” Draco said, grabbing another book at random, pulling his legs up and pretending to flip through it for a reference he didn’t need.
Dammit this was beginning to feel like that night all over again. Harry had been overjoyed. He’d dared to hope that Draco could be his completely, and then he’d found him with another man. Maybe he should just go. He put some money on the bar and was about to turn to leave when he decided
He sighed, closed his eyes and leaned his head back against the wall. “I’m such an idiot… I thought you saw that but didn’t want
“Thanks, Seema.” He smiled weakly, put it in his back pocket and proceeded to the kitchen. “Hey Lila, looks like you got my mess cleaned up. Sorry about that,” he said as he washed his hands and tied his apron on.
“Because Cy, I have to work in the morning and I don’t want to be exhausted. Funny thing about customers, they tend to complain when you’re so exhausted you serve them a broken hollandaise and an over cooked poached egg on their eggs benedict. I’d think you’d want me in top shape, it affects your tips after all.” He smirked and sipped his beer, “I’ll be there in a minute. Pick teams without me, I’m just gonna wash this up and put the finishing touches on dessert.”
Draco looked quickly back to his book, feigning disinterest while something hot and snarling took up residence in his chest.
He wanted to throw up. Draco was being taken in an alley by someone far kinder than he had been when he’d first had him, all because Harry hadn’t been enough to keep him from ending up back where he had started.
him and YOU took him from me. That was the happiest night of my goddamn life and then you showed up and put your fucking dick in him. He was MINE!” Harry began to cry, he couldn’t believe he was letting this man see him this way, but he couldn’t hold back anymore. “He was everything to me, goddammit! I was over the moon to have the attention of that brilliant, incredible man and then you took him away!” Harry collapsed into the chair behind him and put his head in his hands, sobbing in earnest.
“And she LOVED it.” Draco winked. He made himself a plate, grabbed his drink, and settled in his favourite armchair in the living room to eat accompanied by Blaise and Pansy.
The thought that Draco had wanted this to happen, that he had anticipated this moment, drove Harry mad and he dived forward, pulling Draco against him, claiming Draco’s mouth. “Fuck,” he said breathlessly, “I forgot how good you taste.”
He saw himself pushed against glass. He saw that kiss: the kiss that had been burned into his mind from the moment it happened.
“‘Course he has, with the amount of things people throw at him, he needs good reflexes,” Patrick said as he launched a cherry tomato at Cy, who swiftly grabbed it from mid-air and popped it in his mouth.
He glared at her. Truth be told, he didn’t remember much of last night after B.J. scooped him up off the alley floor. He remembered a very embarrassing cab ride where he leaned against him and cried alot. He remembered a tired, confused Pansy opening the door, alarmed to find her best friend being delivered to her looking like he’d just gone ten rounds with a hippogriff. He remembered B.J. and Pans bundling him up into her bed; he remembered falling asleep to the sounds of their low murmuring outside the door. He had no idea what they had talked about or what Pansy knew. He only knew he didn’t want to talk about it now, and he certainly didn’t feel like volunteering information she didn’t already have.
“Fine.” Draco threw himself onto his mattress, punched at his pillow, and curled onto his side, “But no promises if it turns out you snore.”
“What do you want me to say Hermione? I’m not like you! You’ve always been so good, so perfect! You’ve always known what to say, so tell me, what would an angel say? The devil wants to know.” His voice was dripping with contempt and sarcasm. It was petty and he was lashing out to protect himself like he had as a child, but some habits die hard.
“I know if you disappeared tomorrow, I could stand on my own and be just fine. But I WANT you Harry. I have a flat, I want
“No Draco, I don’t think I can fix you. I think Pansy and I would like to help you fix yourself. To redeem yourself in your own eyes,” B.J. said.
They walked down the street into the brisk night air. Harry was swinging their arms back and forth like a kid. God, he was naive. Naive but wonderful. He knew they couldn’t live like this forever:happy normal people walking down the street, swinging their arms and skipping like one of them isn’t a cowardly, lying bastard. Fuck this. A few blocks from the club, Draco had had it. He may not deserve it, but he was a Slytherin goddamnit, and if in this one moment he can take what he wants and not be punished for it, then he was fucking going to.
“I’m sorry,” she said as she sat, dropping some of her cheerful pretence and pouring her own tea. “This isn’t easy.”
To which Draco had replied, “It’s so awful, there isn't even a way to explain what's so awful about it!”
Draco closed his eyes and fought back the panic at the idea of having to go out again this weekend. Not only that, but to go to a proper restaurant and risk some zealous reporter snapping a photo and plastering it all over
“Pansy!” Draco turned to her in horror, “You could be be brought up on charges for breaching the International Statute of Secrecy! You can’t flout Ministry law just because you’re worried about me!”
Harry’s eyes sharpened and his wanting gaze pierced him. “Jesus, Draco…” he panted, eyes wide in amazement. Draco smirked, leaned in, and planted another firm kiss to Harry’s lips before stepping back. Harry nearly collapsed. He looked ravished and beautiful and like he’d won the fucking lottery. He smiled and launched himself at Draco, holding him firmly in a tight embrace, one arm around his waist the other tangled in his har. His face nuzzling into Draco’s neck. Then he backed up and offered Draco his hand. Draco took it and Harry kissed him sweetly on the lips.
Draco felt a little ill again, and was more than a little wary, “You mean Neville didn’t tell you all about it?”
Goldstein blanched. “Fine. If you all want to be blind, that’s your prerogative. But I certainly won’t be eating here again now that I know this whore touches my food.”
Patrick laughed. ”Lee inherited the best hangover cure from his gran, works wonders. What’d you say was in that again?”
“Have you met someone?” She seemed to have noticed something in Draco’s face.He blushed and squirmed in his seat.
of effort to repair things between you two. Honestly, I wasn’t sure what to expect when I got here, what you were thinking or what you fucking wanted -- but you say-- you love Draco. You want Draco. That’s all grand, but nothing will change unless you
Harry just continued to stare, looking at everything from the game night trophy, his posters of Muggle films, to the photos of him and his friends that adorned the walls and end tables.
“I was afraid to go outside. I didn't have a life. All I had was you, a basement full of goblins, and shame. But you never noticed. B.J. has never made me feel that way. He made me realise I needed to be me and be proud of it.He encouraged me to make something more of myself. You were content to just ignore what didn’t fit into your fantasy of a perfect life, and I was dying, Harry!”
“What in Merlin’s name is a plane? Why would that be a career? You can fly anytime you want with a broom. Or the odd illegal carpet…”
“No.” B.J. said simply, as he sat up and placed the mug on the table before him. “So, what are you going to do about it?”
“Ok,” she said, loosening her grip. “But call if you need me. I have a nine pound bowling ball and I’m not afraid to use it.”
“I don’t want to get into it, okay? It was painful enough back then. I should never have gone poking around and opened up that wound again...for either of us.”
, the best support system/Alpha/beta/friend ever. And as always to the best beta and punctuation wrangler I know, she makes my words shine
It was another morning in Harry’s flat. Draco was making breakfast and with all the clanging and spitting it sounded like he was engaged in a battle.
“Well I’m glad he did!” she shouted. “Someone had to! And honestly, the fact that he was so honest about it made me think that just
B.J. set the mug down. “No, you’re right. He isn’t mine. Draco is strong and intelligent and proud. He’s his own man. But I love him. I don’t stand by and let people hurt the people I love.”
“Yes, he’s an exceptionally good man, one of the finest and bravest and kindest.” He smiled. “As to intelligence, no, he’s a bit of an idiot. He tends to get by on bravery and sheer dumb luck, I think.”
“I was making breakfast anyway arsehole, you can’t cook.” Draco said, running his fingers through his hair as he stood to fish through the fridge.
“I see how it is. How ‘bout, I  just enter your name in over here...” Cy switched to the second lanes console and typed in ‘Crap Bag’.
“Good,” Cy said. “Come over here, you can be my ‘Prince Charming’. “Okay, ‘I Can’t Believe It’s Not Gutter' your turn to pick someone.”
“Well I’m sorry, Garrett,” Pansy said taking a sip of her drink, “but as I vastly prefer drawing pictures to prancing about like an idiot, I can neither confirm nor deny seeing any illegal manoeuvres.”
“No I don’t think so darling, I think that one had roses, but it was similar. I think I got this with Storie.” She stood beside him at the counter as she unzipped her makeup bag and pulled out that patented Pansy Parkinson red lipstick. She almost wasn’t herself without it. She coloured her lips, added a quick dash of mascara and ran her fingers through her hair. Satisfied, she turned, “Ok, off we go then.”
too good for him. He deserved to rot in Azkaban for hurting a man as wonderful as Harry the way he had. Goldstein was right: he needed suffer for his sins.
“It’s not that hard!” he’d shout at the bloody thing, and Potter would smirk and dig into his curry.
"As Dad and Lupin, well Papa I guess," George said after a moment of thought "did a test and cleansing after we wrote to them it was just us and our brothers taking the test."
Harry was feeling weak and hopeless. It had been over a week since his birthday and the unfortunate letter from the Ministry letting the Dursleys know he was not supposed to use magic outside of school. His Uncle had since locked and bolted Harry into his room, and with Hedwig also locked up he could not send a letter to anyone. That plus the blasted House Elf Dobby blocking any letters coming to him he could not even use a return owl to send a message for help from anyone.
The whole class watched in shock as Hermione's bushy mane of brown hair seemed to pull in closer to her head which had also begun to change shape. While Hermione had not been either elegant or curvy her body became more stout with a distinct resemblance to Professor Umbridge except for her eyes which shifted from their normal brown to a shocking shade of red. Hermione who had absolute trust in her Mummy and knowing that a Glamor had been placed on her had not even bothered to look at the scroll so soon saw everyone looking at her. "What?" she asked causing some snickers for her voice was neither the normal tone she used nor the sickly sweet voice of Umbridge but the tone everyone who saw Umbridge's frog-like form to produce with a croaking quality to it. As Hermione had not heard her own voice for so long and not since before she had gone through puberty even she was startled by the croak that came out of her mouth. "What did your Potion do to me, you nasty Death Eater?" Hermione called out getting off her chair and glaring at Snape as she vowed to let her Daddy know so he could punish the man.
"I agree with your setting up a meeting with him then, for this plan can not move forward without me getting to know him. Do you think I should meet him in my mask or without?" she asked.
"Aren't you taking the Mirror Twins thing a little far?" Harridan asked taking in their hair as the two groups headed up to breakfast.
But when he started to turn it into a rant reminiscent of Hermione, Harry knew he had to do something to break him off it lest they be out past curfew. It did not take Harry long to figure out what to do as he watched Draco speak with such passion and a fire seeming to burn in his normal board-looking eyes. Harry could almost see the blonde as a general trying to booster his troops' morale as Draco began to pace back and forth going into other problems he thought were happening at the school. Harry could not take it anymore as he stood up and blocked Draco's path causing the blonde to stop pacing but still kept talking. Harry licked his lips as he went from broke hoping it would end the diatribe as he moved closer to the blonde standing on his tiptoes and captured Draco's lips in a kiss. That shut Draco up whose eyes widen in shock from the unexpected kiss as he gently wrapped his arms around Harry's waist.
William "Bill" Weasley was furious after getting back from the Muggle bank with his boss. He knew he had been invited due to how much his family knew about the Muggles, but he was also being watched because his father and two youngest siblings had also messed with Harrison's accounts. It had been the first time Bill had ever seen a Goblin undergo a ritual to make themselves look like a human as Grindstone had done to pass as Devin. And now that they had dealt with the Dursleys he had to take care of business at home. "Ah that feels better," Grindstone said rolling his head on his shoulders. "No offense Cursebreaker William but I prefer my form to that of a human."
"It is not your fault son it is the magic of the dreams do you think with the information I got in them I would not have been able to identify your Mother or Papa?" Lucius said making Harry's mouth fall open to learn that the man was the dominant member of Draco's parental triad causing him to start giggling. All three Malfoys turned to look at him with both elders giving him confused looks while Draco just smiled up at him while still on his knees before his submissive mate.
"But just cause you are an Heir does not let you get any special treatment or access to the school as a student," Severus said.
"I will speak to you however I like when you disregard Hogwarts rules and regulations. While you may be the Headmaster that does not mean you are above the rules. Now, what did you want with Susan?" Pomona asked him as Susan took one of the seats before the Headmaster's desk while the Herbology Professor stood behind her with a hand on her shoulder.
"Well I guess that is all up to you, Harry I don't want to pressure you or anything it is just my feelings. It is not like I expect you to return them or for us to instantly start dating each other," Draco said with a small understanding shrug.
Draco felt like skipping through the halls of his home, but that would be undignified, at least unless he was fully alone. He had recognized the spark he had received from his Heir Ring earlier as the return of his Courtship Bond with Harrison. Granted due to what their relationship had been like last year their bond was not strong enough to sense anything from Harrison only that the bond was back in place. He had shared the news with his folks who had both given him tight hugs and told him they were happy for him. Though he no longer needed to become a Seeker to cleanse Harrison anymore Draco still asked his parents to get him a broom so he could try out as a Chaser at school. His father said he would take care of it had Draco go back to his room to either celebrate or meditate at his leisure.
"He came in the middle of the night," Draco said in answer reaching over and taking Harry's hand in his to offer some support.
The second and third books had also stated that Alphas tended to be more muscular, but not always taller than Omega who always had a more petite and slim form. Once more this did not help Harry determine if he had become an Alpha or Omega for once again due to the Dursley's treatment he was small due to malnourishment they had subjected him to. The books also stated that no matter if a Magical became an Alpha or Omega they could still work any job they wanted to, though they were required to inform their employers when they would be gone due to a Heat Cycle. A spell was listed for use to disguise a Magicals' Scent Gland to hide the fact a person had gone through the change if they liked. Harry quickly jotted down the spell knowing that no matter which one he turned out to be he would need to hide it from his "family."
"Strange," Snape said tapping his wand to his chin in thought for a moment. "Potter a question do you think you are better than anyone else due to what Lily and your father sacrificed?"
Harry was feeling weak and hopeless. It had been over a week since his birthday and the unfortunate letter from the Ministry letting the Dursleys know he was not supposed to use magic outside of school. His Uncle had since locked and bolted Harry into his room, and with Hedwig also locked up he could not send a letter to anyone. That plus the blasted House Elf Dobby blocking any letters coming to him he could not even use a return owl to send a message for help from anyone.
"Well that gets rid of one thorn in your side Blue Jay," Draco said, "my friends have also agreed to come so all that is left is for us to pick a time."
Harry was shocked by all the information on his test. Not only was Draco's dad was his Godfather, he assumed even though he did not know if the man's name was Lucius, but he owed a Life Debt to Draco himself. Then there was all the spells he was under and the fact that Professor Dumbledore had put them there and seemed to be stealing from him. And since Madam Pomfrey and Snape had long-standing payments from his accounts which had been set up after his parents had died the Headmaster had been paying them as well. "First off I do not approve of any of these payments. Can I make them stop and possibly get my money back from them?" Harry asked Bonecrusher
"And what is worse you are letting him take the lead. I mean I hate the slimy snake but I might have been able to accept it if you were the one leading it rather than being the bitch," Ron said making it feel as if the redhead had punched him in the gut. But before Harry could respond a hand appeared over Ron's head holding a drink and dumped it over him.
Ron had not been sure about the duel but after a moment he had to smile in his mind's eye for due to helping Harry prepare for the Tournament last year he knew spells beyond his age range. "What would be the results be if we win or lose?" Ron asked.
"I don't recall. I know Minnie meet with several Muggleborns but they were all girls, Flitwick met with one of the students whose parent was trying to decide to send their child here or one of the other schools. I don't recall anyone else meeting with new students last summer," Bathsheda said tapping her bottom lip in thought. "His address should be located in the school records," she said.
"I am afraid that would fail due to the circumstances. I should warn you though if you chose to go that route Mr. Weasley and myself are just two ordinary workers at the bank and I can assure you, you would not want to have our managers get involved."
"I think you scared him, sir," Draco said as underneath the table he gently patted the pocket where he felt his Mate quivering in fear.
"Fine whatever, you seemed to have made up your mind, but what was that flash when I touched Potter?" Draco asked.
"Provided you claim your seats before you are of age otherwise it could be seen as you not wanting to take your full role in our world giving them to the next in line to receive them," Draco said.
"It can be easily done, for all but the Resurrection Stone/Gaunt Family ring, but only after you claim your titles along with your rings. Though I would suggest going through a cleansing first," Bonecrusher said making another note on his page from Harry's request.
Bonecrusher had not been wrong about how messed up the wards had become under Dumbledore's time as Headmaster for it took them a full week to return them to full working order. Thankfully it only took the healer and curse breaker team just two days to both removed the spells on Cuthbert Binns as well as giving him protections to prevent himself from becoming enchanted again. Most students were a little reluctant to return to his class but found the ghost a changed man as it were, as for the first time in any of the current student's memory he actually began the class by taking role call. In Harridan's class, Professor Binns then began a lecture on the origin of the Muggle superstition of Friday the Thirteenth which had taken place during the time of the Magical Hunts in Europe. It was strangely nice to hear about something that actually had to do with humans in the Magical World even if the subject was rather morbid.
"Well, all but the medical issues I think for I got most of them from a Diagnostic Charm I had cast on him about twenty minutes ago," Mr. Malfoy answered.
"During a discussion with Professor Lupin, who was the one to teach me the spell, due to what one needs to do to cast the spell it is better to not share the memory unless you are really close to them," Harry lied not wanting to share the memory of his kiss with Draco. "Also just to let you know that a corporeal Patronus will also take the form of an animal which can either represent yourself or some you really love. This is another reason not to share the memory you use for it could lead to having someone know something you wish to keep secret. I have also learned that a person's Patronus can change based on a new understanding of themselves or new love, so do not be alarmed if at some point your Patronus changes."
"I guess it is my turn," Blaise said.  "I am Blaise Zabini and I came into the Creature Inheritance of a Dominant Incubus.  I guess if I had to say what my dream is it would be to become a Curse Breaker for Gringotts."
"Indeed but they did say that since you acted to save her when no one was meant to actually get really hurt you have become a Merpseron friend," Luna said giving him a smile as if this meant anything to him.
, and began to read it. Harry felt himself blushing deeply as he quickly read the first chapter which dealt with an Omega's Heat making sure to latch on certain facts such as an Omega, even a male one, would go through a Heat for anywhere from twelve hours to two days once every month and a half. If an Omega did not have an Alpha that when they went into a Heat it was important to provide various items for them to use to deal with their sexual urges. An Omega could go through Heats with different Alphas until they had bonded and marked with an Alpha and brought out their scent glands. If a strange Alpha tried to accompany an Omega that had been bonded during a Heat the Omega would attack and possibly kill the "stranger" even if there were best friends outside of a Heat. Another difference was shown between Alphas and Omegas as male Omegas would only be able to get off from being penetrated by their Alpha, which Harry read as a male Omega could only end up with another male. While an Alpha would have a sort of knot, just like a dog which they would use to bond with the Omega during their heats. Other than the knots Alphas also tended to have larger cocks than their male Omega counterparts. This did not help Harry at all for due to being brought up with the Dursleys he had learned to not look at anyone else so he was not sure how he measured up with anyone in that department.
"Finding out what my uncle was doing," Harrison began making the three humans' and Goblin's hearts collectively break, "my cousin decided that if he and his friends caught me as soon as he left his gang behind he would follow in his father's footsteps and abuse me."
"No the real reason I need to apologize comes later," Snape said as the memories shifted to Snape returning to Hogwarts now friendless and getting approached by his dorm mates.
"Very well motion passes," Minerva said after a moment. She took so long that Severus wondered if due to how much she was into Albus's camp she was aware of what Granger had been doing to Potter's homework and was trying to think of a way out of it.
After Lucius had purchased all of the missing books for Harry he headed to the Owl Post to send a message to the Head of the Hogwarts School Board to let her know about Madam Pomfrey's failure at her job, but also the fact that the Medi-Witch, Albus, and Severus were taking money from Harry's vaults. Lucius knew the Goblins would stop the transfer of funds and try to get them back for Harry but he also wanted the Board to look into the matter themselves. Before he headed back to the bank Lucius received an angry letter from Albus for taking Harry out of school. Lucius after reading the letter just ripped it up and sent the owl back without a reply being too angry at what the man had done to Harry he did not want to lay into the old bastard.
Harry tried not to think about how good it felt to let Malfoy rock him as he took in the other's scent.  "This is the end," Harry muttered.
"You will find I can an will. You own a total of 20,000 Pounds to our client and that is before you take in interest. Now I could call for this all at once which would mean I would take control of your business Mr. Vernon but I would rather not," the man said steepling his fingers before him as he stared their all down.
"Very well then I wish you all goodnight. Please do not share with your Housemates what happened tonight. I have a feeling it will all come out in the Prophet as it is," the headmaster said waving them off as a group of Aurors appeared walking towards them.
"Well while the Headmaster spoke the truth about them honoring you for staying down so long they actually said much more. It seems that they thought Krum should have been disqualified for almost using his shark-head to bite at Granger's bonds which could have killed her," Luna said.
Feeling comfortable Draco pulled out Harry's old wand and summoned something to drink. "So what is for dinner tonight my pet?" Draco asked running his hands through Harry's hair.
"Ah Lord Malfoy what can we do for you today?" the Goblin asked giving a crooked smile at Draco's dad.
"Well he is but I thought I would get some more help to hedge my bets," Harry lied not wanting to get into it.
"Well, you got to admit you are a little strange, maybe if you lay off mention the creatures only Fae can see," Pansy suggested.
"I think not Poppy," a voice said causing Harry, Draco, and the Matron to turn to the open door to the Wards where a tall man with pale blonde hair stood.
"Really that is all you have to say," she said walking away from the fireplace to stand before the pair.
"Very well, if you can provide the School Boards writ we shall begin," Grindstone said holding out his hand for the document.
Ron had been rather shocked to find a scroll appear in front of him knowing that he had no allergies. Reaching forward he unrolled the scroll and read what had been done to him. His face clouded over as he saw he had been under Love and Loyalty Potions tied to Hermione which had now been cleansed from his system. Even worse than that he had also been enchanted to be lazy, not do his best in classes, had intelligence dampeners placed on him as well as spelled to never reveal what he learned about Harry's home life from the Headmaster and his own mother As neither his mom nor Dumbledore was here at the moment he shot a glare at the seat next to him where Hermione was sitting. The Glare lasted only as long as it took to look at Hermione for her skin seemed to be melting as if she had just drunk some Polyjuic Potion. Letting out a gasp caused others to look over and see what was going on. It was not Hermione's skin that was melting away but an old Glamor coming undone.
"It is usually just not done in the Magical World when one's family has House Elves," Draco explained.
"That sounds promising," Pamona said whose classwork mostly was done in groups, and even with the smaller class size than when she started, she had a hard time making sure the students did equal work. "I second the idea," she said.
"Well, she said it a little as a joke after one of my visits to the Hospital Wing saying I would need one to get rid of all the Health Potions she had to use on me by the time I graduated from Hogwarts," Harrison explained before turning to look at the Goblin.
Draco actually let out a laugh at that. "I don't think anyone in our generation could actually hate you, Harry. Even if their parents were his supporters," Draco said making Harry think about Snape's memories about the other.
The good thing was that most of the spells Hermione had cast her classmates had been cleansed Harry, Ron, and Neville had a list of enchantments the basic Cleansing Potion had been unable to get rid of meaning the boys would have to either St. Mungos or Gringotts for a full cleansing. Seeing that Albus was also listed on the three boy's forms made his choice clear. "Class dismissed," he called out, "Potter, Weasley, Longbottom stay behind we need to discuss something." Most of the class headed to the door knowing after the scrolls being turned in and his promise this was not something they should hear. "You as well Malfoy, Granger leave now or I will not hesitate to give you both a detention," Snape added as the blonde and the newly toad-looking girl looked like they wanted to stay behind. Under the threat of detention, Hermione quickly packed her stuff and left the room. Draco on the other hand took his time before he used the tabletop as cover gave Harry's hand a comforting squeeze.
Unfortunately, Percy overheard their plans and told their parents. Just as Ron had convinced the twins to help him out their parents sat them down at the dining room table. "Percy told us you were going to use the car to check up on Harry is that correct?" their mom asked.
"Are you sure?" Harry asked making Draco give him a small glare "Alright you are. Sorry I did not mean any offense but those two were written with the help of Hermione."
"Alright fine," Pansy said rolling his eyes. "But you do know if you share mine I would share yours right?" she asked with a smirk.
Now to business. I have good news and I have bad news. And I suppose that all depends on what you interpret as good and bad. The bad news is that this story isn't complete this week. The good news is that there will be a bit more to love. I swear, I'm not one of those authors that plans on continuing to write and hold you hostage forever as I expand plot points for comments and attention. I just realized this wasn't at its natural end yet. There will be one more chapter and an epilogue.
“Really? Me too…” He put hand on Harry’s arm and said, “I’m surprised I haven’t seen you around before. We should get together sometime. When are you free? We could do tomorrow for brunch if you like. I also know a really great Thai place, we could go out to dinner next Friday. Do you like Thai?” He began to brush his thumb back and forth on Harry’s bicep.
to say, it was just something stupid.” Draco smirked good-naturedly and Harry seemed to relax slightly.
Harry looked over to B.J. and said, “I have to go.” And with that, he turned and fled out the front door.
Harry entered their room, clearly just back from the showers and sheepishly knocked on the door frame as he came in, “Draco?”
“Why do you even bother asking? You know my credibility is shot! I was lucky to get the one chance I had!” He knew he shouldn’t raise his voice but this was too much.
“GAH! What?” Draco flailed suddenly, a flood of sound, color, and motion rushing back into his brain, as he looked toward the person speaking to him.
“Draco, I can see that you are, so if you wouldn’t mind, please will you tell me what happened? All I know is that one day Harry was over the moon, something about going to dinner, and the next he had locked himself in his flat and wouldn’t come out. He was like that for weeks. Nobody could get through to him. Hell, nobody could even get through the wards. Then, about a month later, he came out, walked right into the Burrow for Sunday supper one night and acted as if nothing had happened. If anyone asked he would ignore the question and either move on or leave the room.”
Draco nodded and rolled onto his back, lifting his arms over his head, planting his feet on the bed and spreading his legs wide, offering himself in total submission.
“Sure,” he said, and smiled that little smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Whatever you’d like, Harry.”
something...something beyond sitting in this shithole trying to figure out the most pitiful way to die alone.”
“Ok, well that’s one down.” B.J. said, “I had a bit of medical training in the Navy. I don’t think you have a serious head injury, although you’ll have a nasty lump and a powerful headache in the morning. Now let’s get you home.”
“Yes,” Draco said, detaching his mouth from Harry’s neck and whimpering into it. “You Harry, only you. Fuck, only you Harry.”
Harry could sense the tension build in the street as Draco hurried as quickly as he could to the nearest Apparition point.
mattered anymore anyway either. He tucked up his side of Pansy’s bed—bitch could straighten her own pillows—and walked over to the vanity. Fuck, he looked like he felt. There was a small cut on his cheek with an accompanying purplish bruise forming beneath it; he also had a spectacular black eye and a scrape on the right side of his face from where he’d hit the pavement. How attractive. His hair was disheveled and kinked up strangely on one side from sleep; he ran his fingers through it, but to no avail. He walked down the hall to Pansy’s bathroom and opened the door as she was getting dressed.
"I would normally say yes, it would be a student to determine if they are turning in their work using proper sources rather than trust their fellow students. But I think using the Tracking Spell will help this, but it will also show that if students work together in either homework or class projects are doing the same amount of work so that we can grade them appropriately," Severus explained.
"No, though I guess that is no great surprise considering I never learned my name as Harry until I attended Muggle Primary School just so I would respond to the teachers if called on and not raise any questions about the Dursleys," Harrison explained.
"Okay nice to met you again I guess," Harry said not sure of any protocol for dealing with Goblins for all he knew about Goblins was the stuff Professor Binns taught in his classes about them.
"Ew mom, dad knock it off I am here to strengthened the bond with Harry I don't want to actually get sick," Draco called out seeing the kiss making Harry let out a soft giggle before he clamped his hands over his mouth looking sorry for laughing and afraid as if he was about to get into trouble. "It is alright Harry you don't have to worry about laughing at my teasing of my parents," Draco said instantly turning to Harry to comfort the other boy once more.
"Welcome home dear," the former Boy-Who-Lived now Draco Malfoy's loving boiwife responded stepping out of the kitchen in nothing but an apron. "Did you have a good day at the office?" Harry said rushing forward to take Draco's work cloak before giving him a shoulder rub.
"Madam Burbage is correct," Bonecrusher said, "though there are sometimes when the ritual is used when a family member gives the artifact out to pay for some depts and the person they lend it to does not hand it back after the debt is repaid. As soon we are done here and contact Lady Baddling we shall perform the ritual."
"Ah it seems my hypothesis was correct," Narcissa said as she led Draco back to the bed where he had his injuries from the night before seen to.
"We are really for breakfast you can get off the bed now," Draco said giving a small smile to Harry. Harry scooted to the edge of the bed before he hopped off of it wrapping Draco's cloak tight around his slim form. Despite how they might have felt for Harry the others formed a small circle around Draco and Harry as they left the bedroom to better block him from view from the other Slytherins. This measure, however, did nothing to stop Pansy from easily slipping in and walking on the opposite side of Draco than Harry was. It was then that Harry saw that maybe without realizing it Draco giving him his cloak had helped blocked out any unpleasant scents. For Pansy was rather close but all he could smell was Draco's scent.
"I can't do that either for Neville asked me to go with him," Ginny said sounding a little glad she had accepted the invitation.
"There is no one here by that name. You leave my family alone or I shall call the cops," the man growled out his large bushy mustache twitching.
Lucius then led Harry and Draco back to one of Gringott's Floo rooms and took them to St. Mungos. Almost as soon as he stepped into the place he felt his wife's magic and knew that she felt his as well. Since he had not informed her about what had happened to their son he was not that shocked as she showed up while they were waiting in line to check-in. "Lucius what is the meaning of this why is Draco not at Hogwarts?" she asked arching an eyebrow at him and spoke in a voice that spoke of coming danger. Harry not knowing who she was but hearing the tone of her voice moved a little bit so his smaller form was blocked from her by Draco's larger body.
This will not be abandoned!  I am one chapter away from the ending and I promise a new chapter will be published every Sunday until the story is complete :)
“Night, Laurie.” Draco could practically hear Harry blush as he kissed him and sent him on his way. Harry shut the door and leaned against it for a moment.
Draco looked around, he wasn’t sure where he should go. He spent most nights at Harry’s, only going to the Manor grab fresh clothes and say hello to Mother.
Harry closes his eyes and focuses on his breathing as Draco runs his fingers gently through his hair, then down his shoulders smoothing his shirt and then, fuck, grabbing his waistband and adjusting his trousers. If this man had ever,
Without warning, Draco punched him square in the jaw, feeling the bones of his knuckles crunch against Goldstein’s smug face. Anthony hit the floor and Draco shook his hand out as he grinned at Harry. “I don’t need saving. I can take out my own trash.”
Harry finally exploded. “HOW DARE YOU! Look, I may not have been perfect goddamnit, but you have NO right to barge into my home and cast judgment on me or what I had with Draco! I tried to make him happy, I thought he
“NO! I said I want to be Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!” Cy shouted as he batted at Patrick, who was entering names into the computer.
“Pansy, that’s cute, but we both know you think every hour is a perfectly respectable hour for champagne.”
“Yeah, guess so. Maybe we can make something.” Draco looked a little disappointed, but also a little pleased as he tucked himself back in beside a sleepy Harry.
“Thought you and I needed to have a bit of a chat, actually.” He looked about at the mess, but spotted the mug, already prepared on the counter, and poured in some water. He began searching through the cupboards till he found the sugar bowl and prepared the tea to his liking.
“No! You what, Draco?” He his voice was pleading but insistent. “I need to know what you’re feeling. Please?”
“Actually, I do.”  Draco grinned adding spinach, tomato and Swiss cheese to the pan and folding it in two. He grabbed a plate and deftly slid the omelette onto it, placing the cup of yogurt to the side. “Now take that to Hermione on your way over to your table.”
B.J. smirked. “Cy and Patrick took forever coming up with that while hammered at our last pub night. It made them far too happy. That’s how our crowd is-- goofy, a little wild, and a whole lot odd. If it isn’t your scene, don’t bother coming. I haven’t told him I’m inviting you so it’s fine if you decide not to show. He won’t be disappointed. You can think about it if you want.”
So this chapter began by frustrating me to no end, but then quickly began to fall into a place I really love. For a while there I was afraid I wouldn't get this finished on time, but all your love made me determined not to let you guys down. :) I hope you enjoy it.
“This is never what I wanted for you. I gambled everything I could to keep you alive, but I never thought about what it would be like for you later.” She looked at him with earnest, loving eyes. “It was too late by the time I realised where I had gone wrong. But now—” She bit her lip and looked away. “I don’t know what else I can do to make it better for you.”
He had to get out of here. He looked over at Harry, who was in the midst of what appeared to be a wildly entertaining conversation with Lee and Neville. Draco couldn’t take him away from all these people while he was so happy.
“CAN I HELP YOU?” Harry shouted, hair a mess, evidently having been aggressively abused in some sort of fit. “CAN I FUCKING HELP YOU!?”
Harry’s up and in Draco’s bedroom downing the polyjuice antidote in a flash as he Finite’s the charms on his clothes.
Harry slid off the bed and fell to his knees, taking that dusky pink cock between his lips. He gripped Draco’s arse and held on, desperate and greedy to taste and take as much of the most intimate part of Draco that he could.
“No excuses. It’s been far too long. I always wanted to get to know you better back in school but the timing wasn’t right, what with the war and having to train
B.J.’s cock unceremoniously flopped out of him and he hastily tucked it away. Draco saw the edge of Harry’s shoulder as he collapsed back against the wall and slid down it.
Anthony looked alarmed but turned to Neville. “Nev, you know I’m right, don’t you? I mean, he’s beneath us! He doesn’t deserve to show his face anywhere near us. We earned the right to be rid of people like him. We fought for that!”
helps keep me right and keeps me motivated. Not to mention her influence on the story as it's being created.  Also to one of the best beta's I know, I am unworthy of her talent,
Draco pressed a gentle kiss to the tip, looking up through his lashes as Harry stared down at him, mouth open and eyes wide.
So for those of you playing spot the Sherlock references, there are two more in this chapter! I hope that I am successful in trying to convey the responsibility they each had in the failure of the relationship the first time around, without excusing their individual mistakes and problems. Considering the dark place this beast started in and that I cannot abide unhappy endings, I was worried it might be difficult to get to this place. Also, can I just say, I really want a B.J.? ( The person, not the activity, get your minds out of the gutter! Actually on second thought, don't, mine needs company down there ;) )  One more week!
to keep you safe. So shut it with this nobody's ever loved me crap. Now, I won’t deny that the boy wonder loved you in a way nobody ever has before, and I will admit that despite all my reservations, he was good for you. I want you to get him back Draco, if we can manage it, I really do. But the sun does not rise and set out of Harry Potter’s chosen arsehole!”
“Yeah, he put out a keep-away order and used my Death Eater status to—” Hermione looked stricken “This was a mistake. I should go.” Draco got up and all but bolted out the door in an almost perfect imitation of Harry from the other day.
“Let me rephrase,” Draco continued. “Neither one of us was pleased with our rooming assignment when we received it. When Aris flunked out, Crief had an empty bunk. So I seized the opportunity. As to switching partners, I thought I mentioned the other week, I am already viewed with suspicion both here and in the community at large, I can’t afford to be seen to pass simply because Harry Potter is my partner.”
Draco’s eyes were burning, because at the time, that was exactly what that kiss had meant. He just didn’t think Harry had felt it too.
“I swear Cylan, there is a cheese plate, two types of dip and a flatbread over there. I even made you those little taquitos you like so much, so get your arse out of my kitchen.”
Draco gathered up people’s empty dishes and walked them to the kitchen. As he rinsed them and set them in the dishwasher, he thought it really was amazing the things these muggles came up with. Growing up he was surrounded by people that made it seem like Muggles lived like barbarians with no means of maintaining a civilised culture without magic. He’d come to discover quite the opposite. This machine in itself was practically magic. Not only that, they had some inventions that far outstripped Wizarding methods. What the hell were wizards still doing faffing about with giant stacks of books when there was Google? Yes, granted, you still needed books for deeper research, but you could find the answer to all manner of simple questions with just a few keystrokes. And now that he’d seen a football match on telly, listening to Quidditch on the WWN would never be the same. Cell phones were amazing, you could communicate with a person from a distance without needing access to a fireplace, and why were they still using fire for heat and light anyway? It was insane. He was starting to think that Hogwarts ought to make Muggle Studies a mandatory course. He laughed to himself as he poured the powder detergent into the dishwasher and set it. What would the Wizarding world think of him now? ‘Draco Malfoy: advocate for Muggle technology, better education and the repeal of outdated Wizarding ideas.’
“No, I’m not a wizard Draco.” B.J. said, “and don’t worry, Pansy didn’t risk anything. I figured it out. Practically had to drag it out of her to get her to admit it though. You boyfriend’s mate, Neville was it? Well, when he was screaming in that alley, he said something about calling the aurors. That sounded familiar, but I just figured I’d misheard or misunderstood. But then he was talking about a war and I put two and two together. My sister Caroline’s a muggle-born, a bit older than me. I remember turning 11 and hoping I was too so I could go to Hogwarts, but turns out I’m ordinary.”
FUCK. I bet you bloody do, thinks Harry. He knows Draco meant the polyjuice, but Merlin this is going to be the death of him. “Keep your pants on!” He wills himself back under control, and steps out.
To be fair, most of the time Draco couldn’t believe it either. He felt in awe every day that beautiful man looked at
“My god, you’re right! What am I saying? To Draco!” He raised his beer and Draco clinked it with his own. “May he never understand the difference between yellow and red penalty cards!” The entire group cheered and toasted Draco as Draco smiled and tipped an imaginary hat.
“You ready love?” Draco nodded and B.J. turned him around lowering his pants and trousers and reaching into his pocket for lube. He prepped Draco carefully, almost tenderly. Draco braced himself with his arms against the wall and his cheek against the brick. B.J. slid on a condom and lined himself up. “Are you ok?”
And with that Laurie pulled Harry out of the room. Sweeping him into his arms and out of Draco’s life.
“Ow! Stop it! It won’t fit! It’s too many letters! Besides I was there the night we went skinny dipping, Princess,” Patrick began typing ‘Princess Puny’ into the console, “and a banana, it is not my friend. OW!
He wondered what it would be like, waking up next to this new Draco. This bold, bright creature who he now realized was so unlike the muted, withdrawn man he had known. Harry had always known there was more to Draco. He could sense it, even when they were happy, laughing watching telly, or having a lie-in, Draco seemed content and his smiles were sincere, but there had been something missing. He’s a fool for not saying anything to Draco then about it.
After years of self hatred and fear, Draco has finially gotten his life together. A look at where he is and how he got there.
“Well as the guest of honor, naturally mine, my liege.” Cy bowed low in his seat at the console and Draco looked up to see the name ‘King Draco’ on the screen.
“Draco’s a big boy.” There weren’t enough blankets in the world to block out the sounds Draco was hearing. “Forget about him, he’ll be fine.”
Harry cleared his throat and politely moved Goldstein’s hand. “Actually, my boyfriend is the brunch chef here.”
Draco reached into the tub of drinks and handed him another beer without even looking up from his sautéing.
“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me,” he mumbled as he hunched over, cigarette between his lips, hands shaking and flicking the goddamn thing till he finally chucked it into the street. He collapsed back against the wall dejectedly.
him, had the life Harry wanted with him, lazy mornings at home and playful breakfasts at Hudson’s, and now this man was rubbing it all in his face! How dare he barge into his home and challenge him! Why in the hell was he even here?! Then it dawned on him.
“Likewise.” Laurie took his hand and met his eye. Something cautious and predatory passed between them, but Draco turned away, unwilling to meet the penetrating gaze.
“Merlin.” Draco said, thunderstruck. “I always wondered why…I mean the papers... and nobody ever...” Draco swallowed. “Look, Granger—”
“Why didn’t the papers know, Harry? I always wondered. Everyday... Why weren’t there howlers and curses everywhere I went? Why didn’t the press hound my mother? You filed paperwork with the Ministry, how did that never get out? Why doesn’t even Hermione know?”
He’d loved Draco, and it made him sick to his stomach to finally realise just how hurt Draco had been back then.
Oh god…He’d missed it. He’d been so busy listening to the hatred in his own head, he couldn’t see the love in front of him and now it was too late. He’d become everything they’d thought he was. He was a selfish bastard:he was a piece of shit, and Harry
“Not so fast.” Harry says grabbing him by the wrist and pinning him to the wall. He presses himself against a squirming Draco, who stills suddenly when he can feel Harry’s growing hardness pressed between them. ”Do you want this?”
Harry wouldn’t notice if he was gone anyway. He was going for a smoke. Draco stepped outside into the cool night air and took a deep breath. He leaned his head back against the wall and rolled up his sleeves, releasing his forearms from their sartorial prison. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette, desperate for the soothing buzz of nicotine. He fished out his lighter and flicked it. Again. And again. And again.
Draco had pulled him slowly and gently into the alley beside the club and Harry had fucked him. He remembered being nervous, but wanting it. When it was over and Draco was putting himself back together, he’d panicked.
"St. Mungos is not a person Heir Potter it is a Magical Hospital located in London, and by your question, I take it you had never gone there. Tell me Heir Potter did you have a medical form with your booklist and Hogwarts' acceptance letter?" Mr. Malfoy said.
"I did collect the blood all rituals done here will not cause a person to feel pain, nor leave a scar as any cut is instantly healed," Elfblossom said gesturing to the pitcher of solution and the small switch of wood. Harry took hold of the wood and let out a small gasp feeling a more powerful spark than he felt when he used his wand. "Yes, it is intense for Yggdrasil is one of the various World Trees. But while it promotes a strong connection to Magic by old beliefs every Wand Maker in the world refuses to use it to produce wands lest the tress, which there are not that many off, be killed off," Elmblossom explained as Harry started to stir his blood into the solution within the pitcher. Elmblossom's voice took on a lighter and high pitch tone as they began to chant the ritual as Harry stirred. The voice almost making him feel as if he was falling into a trance watching to greenish-pink liquid start to change into a silver color.
"So if it the part of your Soul that is in my body that is causing a connection between us does that mean you could remove it?" Harry asked hopefully.
"But don't I have to give you everything?" Harrison asked finally looking up and seeing all three had tears streaming from their eyes at his stories.
"But I though we had reached the end of our Courting Dreams?" Harridan asked making Draco give him a sad chuckle as the two curled up together in the large dream bed.
"Are you alright Harry?" Charity asked having backed away to give him privacy to read the test himself.
Harridan was amazed at Pansy's skill at creating clothes, so much better than the "Elf Hat" he had been told Hermione had placed around the Common Room before the Twins had been allowed into the Slytherin Mated Dorms. Her outfits seemed to have the perfect balance for both style and function with both Muggle-looking clothing and Magical robes. Though he knew that he had really no sense of fashion so he might have been wrong. Though he did like one of the outfits that Theo had worn which were of a sunshine yellow tee-shirt, with holes for his wings to come out, that had the Greek symbols of Alpha and Omega combined on the front in red. As well as a pair of comfortable-looking black shorts that Pansy said could be altered to either hug a person's ass or altered in case they had a tail. Seeing the outfit Harridan immediately leaned over and ask if he could buy one from her making the girl smile at him as she handed over an order form so he could fill out details on the sizes he wanted. By the time the twins and Blaise returned he had already found two other of Pansy's creations which he decided to order and even Draco found one for himself.
“Shhh,” Pansy said, smiling and pushing Patrick’s plate closer to him. “Just eat your waffles, love.”
“It’s part of my charm. Now OUT!” Draco said as he whipped him on the arse with a kitchen towel and turned to peel and press some garlic, smiling to himself.
Well that was right out, he could never do it. Not without constantly being reminded of the one man who—
“Oh you think that’s bad do you? My middle name is Jackson, my last name is Allman. My parents named me B.J. All Man, and then they had the gall to be surprised when I told them I was gay,” he smiled.
Hermione looked as if she might cry. “Oh, Harry! I’m so sorry, but that day at the restaurant when he saw you, the look on his face when you left... and then he charged right past me, didn’t even see me, it was like he couldn’t see anything but you. He looked different Harry, and I saw his friends and they seemed like nice normal people, they seemed so concerned for him. I’d never seen anyone look at Draco that way, and then Pansy recognized me. I think she thought we were there to… I dunno...come after him or something. That other guy, he calmed her down, but he seemed worried. The way they talked about him...I had to know. So I asked him to meet me.”
She looked up at him and smiled. “Good, now go back to your side of the bed, you’re a bloody furnace.” She laughed and pushed him away.
He stripped off his shirt and ran a hand through his ruffled hair. As he stepped out of his pants and trousers, he noticed something fall from his back pocket. Bending over to retrieve the slip of paper. He saw it was the note Seema had handed him. He read it once, and then twice.
“Jesus Christ! Pansy said you were thick, but I always thought she was exaggerating!” B.J. threw his hands in the air, clearly frustrated. “I
Draco took it warily but allowed himself to be hoisted up. “Why are you doing this?” he asked,  eyeing B.J. suspiciously.
“I love you too you arrogant bastard.” Harry’s face lit up as he dove back in to claim Draco’s mouth.
don’t want my past brought up in courses. I don’t need or want that sort of attention or pressure. I just want to get through the program. So how about we call a truce?”
“Sorry Cy.” Draco sprang up, decision made. He had to find out what Harry was doing here. “I’ll just go fetch you a new one.” Draco called over his shoulder, already heading towards the bar. He was stopped by a hand gripping his arm and he turned to see Pansy.
B.J. walked into the kitchen and began rummaging in the freezer for some ice. “You know, you’d make it a lot easier on yourself if you just let me order a bunch of pizzas for these things. This lot will eat anything.”
He flipped the bacon, and it erupted in a shower of sizzling oil as Draco yelped. “If that muggle on the telly can do it, I can do it. It’s not very different from potions in some ways, it’s just new, that’s all.” He looked determined to master this.
he did. He was hurt and scared! He’s an idiot! Especially when it comes to you. And now I find myself right back where I was a year ago with an armful of crying, broken Draco, that
Draco examined him, trying to understand what the other man was thinking. “That doesn’t really answer my question…What are you doing here?”
Draco continued to watch as Harry was swarmed and welcomed by the entire assembly, and noticed, not for the first time, that he didn’t even seem to miss Draco’s absence when he was among these people. Bloody tosser could have anyone he wanted. What the fuck did he need Draco for? In the end, he’d go back to his life and pick someone new to watch telly and eat takeaway with and the only person who would have paid for it would be Draco. Because Harry had given him a taste of something he was never entitled to. If he’d never known what those sweet moments of being held and cared for felt like, he’d never feel the aching, shattering withdrawal that would come from them being ripped away.
“I used my name and influence at the Ministry to have those records sealed. As to the other… only three people know about that. You, me and Neville.”  He chuckled darkly, looking over at a picture of B.J., “I guess four technically, but I made Neville swear an Unbreakable Vow.”
Harry, the idiot, looked delighted. “Great! I’ll make us some reservations! I’m stuffed, do you want any more of this?”
Then he realised he had a pan of butter melting on the stove, eggs in one hand, sausage in the other and the soundtrack to Mario Kart blaring from his television.
“Oh, Hello Harry!” He smiled a cheeky smile as he leaned against Harry’s door frame. “How nice to see you! I hear you’ve put the kettle on!” His voice bright as he pushed past Harry and followed the shrill whistle into the kitchen.
They took their seats, Pansy ordered two mimosas, and told the waitress she would let them know when they were ready to order. When the mimosas arrived, Pansy looked at her phone and held up a finger. “Aaaand…Now it’s 11. Drink up, it is officially a respectable hour for champagne.”
Harry ached to be a part of that. To come home to that flat and to belong there. Maybe some nights he’d shower, dress and pop down the road to Hudson’s for dinner. He imagined what it would be like watching Draco’s face light up and wink as Harry took a seat where he could watch him work, confident and in his element. He’d meet Draco’s friends and listen to them rave about Draco’s culinary skills. Harry would listen to them gush while trying to keep his eyes off that radiant blond hair, and that graceful body as he wove through his kitchen with ease. Then maybe he’d go home and wait for Draco to stumble in at the end of a long night. Harry would have a glass of wine ready for Draco and their favorite show queued up on the telly. They’d sit and Harry would rub Draco’s feet while Draco listened to him talk about his day.
This will not be abandoned!  I am one chapter away from the ending and I promise a new chapter will be published every Sunday until the story is complete :)
“I got off a bit early and I wanted to see where you live.” Laurie smiled as he tucked his hands behind his back and surveyed their quarters. “So… this is your room huh? It’s very… quaint.” His eyes examined their shared space, before focusing on Draco. “And you must be Draco. I’ve heard a lot about you from Harry.” He stepped forward and extended a hand.
“Mmmm, you want this bad, don’t you baby?” Draco closed his eyes and nodded, reveling in the sensations washing over him. “Say it.” B.J. swooped in and kissed him fiercely, claiming his mouth and taking what he wanted. He pulled back abruptly, and Draco, suddenly bereft of touch, moved to follow. “I need you to say it. I need you to tell me what you want to do here. I don’t want to push you too hard or take advantage of you, but I do want to make you feel good, and God, do I want to get off with you. I’m aching right now, but I need you to tell me what you want.”
“Oh! Busy! I see! Busy with what pray tell? Because you haven’t been working overtime, you haven’t been out with Ron and I for lunch in ages, you haven’t been to the Weasley’s, you missed Lee’s birthday…”
“And I can’t even be mad about it. Because he’s so much now. He’s radiant and happy. He’s better off and I… I hate that it wasn’t me that made him this happy. All I ever wanted was to have the Draco you get to be with every day. Fuck. I miss him.” Harry stopped and tried to catch his breath, refusing to look up. He sighed. “Are you happy, you bastard?”
just go back to Laurie’s. It would kill him, but at least he could stay up torturing himself in peace without having to listen to the live show.
He quickly tossed his pyjama bottoms into the corner and threw on his trousers and T-shirt,  “I ought to get going anyway.”
Draco arrived to meet Harry on Saturday in a pair of his best dark blue denims and a soft, thin, sapphire blue v-neck jumper. When Harry opened the door, he smiled, pulled him in, and kissed him. God, Draco thought he would never get tired of the taste of Harry’s mouth. It was tea and biscuits and those little mints he always liked to suck on. He was hungry for the little noises Harry made when he grabbed Draco’s waist to pull him closer. Draco could die here. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and began to devour him, pressing himself against Potter as tightly as he could, until he felt hands slide to the front of his hips and push him back gently.
He walked away, tucking his hands into his pockets, grateful this conversation was over and praying he could put Harry behind him once and for all.
This man must be a muggle then. How nice, he thought, blowing smoke into the crisp night air. Oh the irony that now, only among muggles, was he truly free.
“You’re keeping me awake for this?” Draco flipped his head out of the covers. “Go to bed Potter,” he said as he resettled himself amongst his blankets.
As Draco walked to Martha’s he was mired down in a fog of anxiety and trepidation. He didn’t know what Granger could possibly want from him. If she wanted to murder him for what he’d done to Harry, surely she’d have done it by now. As it stood, he’d complied with Harry’s wishes once he made it clear he didn’t want to be contacted and stayed out of the way of all his friends and known haunts.
“Right indeed,” Draco mumbled. He looked at the clock.10:30. Fuck Pansy’s gran’s rules; he went to the cupboard and poured himself a double scotch. He leaned against the counter and closed his eyes. He’d lost so much and he’d paid and paid and paid. When would this just be over?
“Of course B.J. is protective of me! Of course he loves me! B.J. picked me up off the ground the night I broke us. And yes, I
“No. From what I understand, he and Harry got into a big row and Harry made Neville swear never to say anything. I don’t know what Harry told him, but if you ask Neville about it he gets really angry and refuses to talk about it.”
He looked up now to see B.J. on the couch, engaged in what looked to be a fascinating conversation with Blaise on god only knows what. Pansy was sitting on the floor perched between his knees as he rubbed her shoulders. Those two got on like a house on fire. He had thought Pansy was bad when she wanted to invade some aspect of his life, but when the two of them got together, he was doomed every time.
“An airline pilot! I wanted to fly planes. I always thought it would be fantastic to wear a uniform, and be a Captain. People respect Captains and the girls all fawn over them. But I guess it was mostly that I wanted to take off from the ground, and leave the world behind, fly up in the air and travel to new and interesting places.” Potter smiled as he thought about his childhood fantasy.
“Piss off.” He turned on the faucet, ran some water through his hair and washed his face. He reached past her just as she was hooking her bra and grabbed a towel. He patted his face dry, set the towel down, and turned, leaning against the counter with his arms crossed. She slipped her arms into a swishy black and white floral wrap dress. As she tied it at the waist Draco asked, ”Wasn’t I with you when you bought that? At that street fair?”
A few days after that however, he was sitting on Pansy’s couch having a panic attack about finding work. He had no idea what he was good at, or where he should look, or where to even begin. Pansy’s answer, as it was to most things, was brunch and mimosas.
Silence hung between them as they looked at each other, each waiting for something and unsure what it was. “Well, I guess I should be going.”
“If it helps your aristocratic sensibilities Blaise, think of it as a pork belly truffle gratin with a five cheese mornay sauce, and I’ll have you know my mother loves my cooking. You just have to present it appropriately. One of her favorite snacks is my roasted nut pâté paired with a compote of seasonal berries served on a hearty sprouted wheat bread.”
Draco intended to. He hardly needed the warning. Harry was dangerous. He was a landmine. There was no way Draco could touch him and walk away intact.
Harry was panicked. He tumbled out of his floo and sprinted toward his shower at top speed. Fucking trainees.They had been running team drills through an obstacle course. Philips had panicked at an incoming threat and fired off a curse so haphazardly it struck his partner. Then without even noticing Anderson was down, he’d Apparated so quickly to the rendezvous point that he’d splinched himself. Harry, as their training Auror, had to get them to St. Mungo’s, relay information to the Healers, then fill out all of the accident report paperwork. On Monday he would be writing a strongly worded letter recommending Phillips’ removal from the program, but that could wait. Right now, it was 6:45 and Harry was late.
Draco looked up at him, “Oh...uh...yeah...I’m fine.” He looked back at Harry who was staring at Cy’s hand on Draco with wary, questioning eyes.
Hermione must have sensed the anger rolling off of him because her voice spiked with panic. “Harry calm down! You’ve not been the same since he left, and you know it. You try to hide it, but we all know you miss him. It’s obvious Harry! And you wouldn’t tell us why or what he did, and so we all assumed it was something terrible and well it was, it really was--”
“I hate you,” Patrick said, leaning back in his chair and finishing his drink. “This was one of our better bowling nights. Next time, you’re on my team.”
And just like that, Draco found himself in the kitchen. He was a natural. Turns out, there was a lot of overlap between potions and cooking: precise chopping, careful measurement, stirring (or flipping) at the right time, and monitoring temperature. Which is not to say there wasn’t room for creativity and improvisation once you understood the basics of flavour and technique. It was as Professor Snape had said all those years ago, it was a “subtle science and exact art.”
He gasped as he began to push slowly in. Draco’s mouth was open and he was staring down at the place where Harry disappeared inside of him, looking awed. “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, fuck Harry, yes, god, you’re inside me, fuck.”
Draco raised an eyebrow and turned to look back at B.J. who was pretending to watch their friends bowl, but who, Draco could sense, was also observing them from the corner of his eye.
“Oh you’re one to judge!” B.J. laughed, “ Draco huh? That’s a new one. Besides, your initials spell DAM.”
“Good. It was fine.” Draco wiggled away and brought them to a stop, facing Harry. “Look, are you sure this is a good idea? Did you tell them who you were bringing?”
But with the weight of that admission at the forefront of his mind, panic overcame him, and he took a step back from both Draco and the Pensieve. He instead turned on his heel and Apparated.
“Okay, simmer down, you two,” Draco said as, with a flick of his wrist, he flipped the omelette in his pan.
. What. The fuck. Are you going to do about it? Come now, Harry. Think! You sit there and tell me that you love him, that you miss him and want him to be happy. But a month ago -- and stop me if I get any of this wrong -- You showed up to his flat unannounced claiming you want closure -- tried to leave abruptly when he thanked you for protecting him, then you kissed him,” B.J. ran a hand through his hair. “Though, in your defense, Draco did admit that he started it, the idiot. But then you pushed him away accused him of cheating on
Draco looked over at B.J. who was uncharacteristically quiet and tense as he leaned back in his seat and looked at his watch.
for people to judge. Was Potter mad? Why couldn’t he leave well enough alone. The more they went out, the sooner Potter would realise he couldn’t possibly keep Draco, and that would be the end of it. Draco sighed; there was no use fighting it.
“Nope, haven’t had the pleasure. Well, I hope your date with Laurie from the administration office goes well.”
“Oh yes,” said Draco, “Last time, Patrick was losing and Cy started paying him in Monopoly money to do real-life tasks, and when that didn’t help enough, Patrick petitioned that he and Amani should be allowed to get married and thus combine their marital assets.” Draco chuckled. “You never know with this bunch.”
As they were finishing up their tiramisu, Harry grinned and excused himself to go to the men’s. When he stood, suddenly there was a shout from behind Draco.
Harry noticed now that Draco didn’t look reassured. He watched his own gaze search the room as they entered and, in his excitement to see his friends, let his hand drop. He watched Draco slowly approach as people eyed him warily and then stand awkwardly until Harry reached back and grabbed him, pulling him forward into the crowd. Draco looked terrified. Well, he looked terrified to someone that knew Draco. To the outside world, he looked stiff and cold, but Harry wasn’t even looking at him.
He pushed Harry against a shop window and kissed him. He wasn’t timid or submissive like he usually was with Harry. He didn’t follow Harry’s lead. He simply took. He could feel Harry begin to melt beneath him, his knees growing weak, so he wrapped an arm around his waist, pulling their hips together and holding him up at the same time. He remembered earlier how badly he had wanted to run his fingers through that wild mop of luxurious hair, so he did, tousling the raven locks with his long pale fingers till they finally came to rest on the back of Harry’s neck. Draco’s thumb caressed Harry’s cheek and he could feel Harry fall apart beneath him, gasping and moaning into the kiss as his prick frantically rubbed against Draco’s thigh.
Draco smiled and licked Harry from root to the tip before taking him into his mouth humming in satisfaction, never taking his eyes off Harry’s. He found a teasing, gentle pace that made Harry arch and tense, obviously trying to keep from pushing up and fucking Draco’s mouth.
Her face softened. “I know Harry. I’m sorry. I honestly thought if you saw him it would be good for you. It’s been a month and you won’t even tell me what happened. You just seem so miserable. Why won’t you just talk to me about it?”
Harry awoke to a hand delicately brushing through his hair and a tender kiss placed sweetly to his temple. In all his life he’d never been awoken so gently and with such warmth and affection. Growing up, it had been a banging on his cupboard door; in school, it was either on his own or Ron chucking a pillow at him and telling him they were late as they frantically tried to find trousers and books in time for classes; and recently, it was to the harsh, echoing blare of the alarm spells he set.
Draco turned to lie on his back staring up at the ceiling, he closed his eyes and sighed. “I wanted to be the first Wizard to invent a way to go into the stars.”
“Oh god yes,” Draco groaned as he pushed Harry against the wall. He gasped and Draco kissed him deeply, his tongue plundering Harry’s mouth. God, Harry had missed this. Draco’s chest pushed firmly against his, those long elegant fingers hooking into his belt loops, the taste of Draco—
“You have to understand, back then I wasn’t really around for Harry very much. There were the wedding plans, buying a flat, figuring out and starting careers. Everything was so hectic and Harry, well, he seemed fine most of the time. But I knew he was struggling a little. Then something changed with him. He seemed to brighten. Harry’s always been a bit...adrift. Nothing in his life has ever really felt like it was his, and he was always being pulled in one direction or another to be a symbol or a hero. Even the adults in his life manipulated him endlessly. I don’t think he ever thought he would live beyond the war and if he did, I don’t think he ever thought of what he would do.” She paused as she chewed her lip,  “He’s always been a little emotionally stupid. I think maybe he figured he’d just move in with Ron and I and we’d all just play house and be teenagers forever..”
Well here we are! Hope it was worth the wait! We've reached end of the road! (except for the epilogue)  I hope you enjoyed this journey as much as I did! When I first found my self listening to Criminal by Fiona Apple, I had an idea for an interesting infidelity 5k one shot. I had no idea it would become this multi-chapter adventure to hell and back. It was meant to be 3 characters, Harry, Draco and the random faceless guy that fucked Draco and left, (B.J. wouldn't leave, and I'm glad he didn't!) I've been reading fanfic for 17 years but only wrote my first fic last September and this is my first multi-chapter. Thank you all for your love and support! So how'd you like the ending? Did it go how you'd hoped? Thoughts are always welcome, but not required. Your presence is enough. See you next week for a VERY short epilogue to catch up with our boys.
“Ah, yes. Well, I’m afraid that’s really none of your business,” Draco said, also setting aside his cup and leaning slightly back in his seat. “That is between Harry and I. I have tried to reach out to him but he has made his wishes clear in that regard. Let me just assure you that for what it’s worth, I never meant to hurt him and I have done everything he has asked of me since that awful night. I’m sure your intentions are pure, but I have worked very hard in the past year to regain some semblance of dignity and I will not sit here and be scrutinised or judged by you or anyone other than Harry.” Draco pushed himself back from the table, “I promise you, you never have to worry about him being hurt by me again.” He stood and turned to go, “I couldn’t bear it.”
“Harry…” Draco dropped the pan he was holding with a loud clatter, caramel sauce splattering onto his shoes. They stared at each other for what felt like ages, the tension vibrating between them, each caught in this interminable something.
As they began to make their way towards The Leaky, he thought he felt someone watching him. When he turned to look, he could have sworn he saw a flash of green eyes, but then they were gone. He must have imagined it. He felt like he saw Harry everywhere these days.
“Yes, but I am a Malfoy and I have standards,” he said in the haughty, aristocratic tone of his youth.
“Good boy. Now, first of all, you and I both know that Harry bloody Potter isn’t ‘all you’ve ever known of love in this world’, you drama queen.” She leaned across the table and smacked him hard across the back of the head. “There’s me you jackass, and I don’t take kindly to being told I don’t love you when I have never given you any indication to the contrary. I’ve been on your team since we were 7 years old, finding clever ways to hide from boring parties together. It’s always been you and me against the world, even if you did try to pretend otherwise for parts of your moody teen years. Vince and Greg loved you in their own monosyllabic way. There’s your parents. Your father may not have known the right way to show it, but he loved you. Oh! And your mother loved you so much she defied
of all things, and to top it all off, your boyfriend saved the world and you have to be afraid of being seen with him. Do you
. ” B.J. crosses his arms against his chest, fixing Harry with a cold stare. “What I find most troublesome though Harry, is that you thought it appropriate to ask him to show you his most painful memories, even after he admitted to you just how hurt he had been.”
which caused the bogeyed bats to dive-bomb Ginny rather than the twins. George was still out of commission for a few seconds as tweaked his nose after the bats had flown out of it. As the girl was distracted by the colony of booger bats flying around her and tugging at her hair and clothing Fred casually lined up his wand and cast a stunner at her causing her to fall right on top of her brother. With both Fletchers out of the fight, the Wards around the Dueling platform fell letting Professor McGonagall move forward and cast a
"Ah Messer Potter," a voice said breaking him out of his research causing him to look up at the Librarian.
Harrison let out a sigh as the gift was given to him before he responded, "According to this book she was married to Charlus Potter, which was the son of the man I was named after."
"Don't worry the place was never haunted. The villagers gave it the name after hearing father breaking stuff as a wolf while James and his friends spread the tale that it was a pack of ghouls and restless sprites that were the cause," Fred stated quite matter of factly having heard the tale at Grimmauld Place when he and George had asked their unknown father and Black about the creation of the Marauder's Map.
"Ah, Mr. Potter you are up. That is good you missed breakfast but I will have them bring something up," Madam Pomfrey said coming over to his bed and starting to fluff his pillow a little. Harry noticed Malfoy sending a dirty look at the woman behind her back. "Mr. Malfoy you can leave as soon as you finish your meal, the Matron said without even looking at the blonde. Harry noticed the look on Malfoy's face darkened even more at the woman's words.
"Here you go, Harry," Draco's mom said startling him as she passes a tray with a couple of potions through the Wards. As Harry had never really spent any time in the Hospital Wing, he was not sure about the potions hearing some of his classmates talk about how bad medical ones usually tasted. "You don't have to worry," Narcissa said guessing what was going through his mind, "inoculation potions are specially treated to have no taste making it easier for people to drink them without gagging. Now, do you happened to know if you have any food allergies, Harry?" she asked him.
Harridan barely paid attention to Dumbles's announcements, hell he did not even notice when the new D.A.D.A teacher interrupted and took over for a bit. He did come back to himself a little as Luna helped show him the way to Ravenclaw tower. Where Harridan with half an ear listened to Professor Flitwick's start of term speech about rules and Quidditch trials as he wanted nothing more to do than sneak down to the dungeons and find out the password to Slytherin so he could cuddle with his mate. Rather than head out after Flitwick left them Harridan went in search of his new rooms finding he was sharing with Michael Corner and Terry Boot. Once inside the room he found his stuff before the bed furthest from the door and without even changing out of his robes fell into the bed missing Draco. Before his new dorm mates came up Harridan had already fallen fast asleep.
"Alright random examples Pumpkin Juice, or how about the fact that Hogwarts is set up so that the students basically try to one-up each other rather than have equally learning for all," Harry pointed out.
"A couple of things," Harrison said, "first I need to find a Potioneering Elf to brew some potions for me. But I also have a question."
"Yeah, but what new understanding did you gain mate?" Ron asked. Harry was glad he had a ready lie as he talked about Snape giving him the book that allowed him to finally learn to use Occlumency successfully.
Having witnessed the twins totally trounce the Fletchers both Veelas were in great spirits as they headed down to the Dark Lake. Draco, pointing out that as the Headmaster and Harridan's former friends were occupied now would be a good time for his Mate to get his gift from the Merpeople. While Harridan agreed with his Alpha he also wanted to fly like the pair had done back at Malfoy Manor. Though had no desire to use his wings to fly around the castle and draw any more attention to himself making him wish there was a place for them to go to do it. As Luna had informed them that Harridan had to submerge himself into the water neither Veela thought that Harridan could use any magic to keep himself dry. So handing his robe to Draco and pulling off his boots and socks Harridan waded into the water at the edge of the lake before dunking his head under the water.
Just cause he was in a coma, however, did not stop his pain. Now not only dealing with his just his head feeling as if it was about to burst in the coma he whole body was screaming in pain. His mind had also surrounded him by a legion of Quirrel all of which had bodies that moved in unnatural ways making him recall a movie he had seen Dudley watch while he had been vacuuming the stairs. Thinking of the movie several of the Quirrells took on the appearance of busted cyborgs making their bodies move even more jerkily than the others. It was not long before there was not a "normal" Quirrell left as after the cyborgs some transformed into zombies, living puppets, and even one in a Hollywood mummy movie knock-off. In the vision from the coma, Harry had no wand to defend himself as the legion of Quirrells approached him. He tried fighting them back, since as they surrounded him he could not run away from them, only to find his arms and legs felt like they were moving through jelly any time he tried to punch or kick out at them. The group quickly grabbed hold of him as the pain he was experiencing increased to almost staggering levels. As the random forms of Quirrell held him down the only normal-looking one began to approach him. Harry tried to fight the others off but it was useless as normal Quirrell reached a hand towards his head. Knowing somehow the moment that Quirrell touched him he would be lost and there would be no going back Harry turned his head this way and that to avoided the hand until the copies grabbed his head and held it still. Normal Quirrell's hand finally reached him but rather than just touching his flesh the hand sunk into his head as if his flesh and bones were just the surfaces of a lake.
"See Minerva everything is alright I shall get to work on the contract for the conditions," Albus said with a smile that made the hair on the back of Harridan's neck stand on end.
Thankfully both of them signed their approval leading Bonecrusher to take him to the appropriate Ritual room leaving the pair behind. "Not to be rude but what would have happened if they had not agreed to have me take part in the ritual?" Harry asked.
Dumbledore thought this had to be a lie for he made sure that no Gyrffindors ever became friends with members of Slytherin House lest they corrupt his Lions. "I am sure she thought she was doing what was best," Albus said.
After they had returned from the Alley, Harridan had sent one of the Malfoy-Riddle House Elves to collect his belongings from Grimmauld Place and had spent an hour doing his summer homework next to Draco in the Manor's library. So far thanks to the blocks of his Intelligence being off he had finished all but Potions and had decided to focus on something else. "What are you researching my Blue Jay that caused such a look of concentration?" Draco asked ruffling Harridan's hair.
"I wish to have either of their parents to come over during our next Hogsmead weekend to take them to Gringotts to get tested just in case Molly had them under any sort of spells or Potions," Blaise said making the twins smile at him in thanks having not thought about that themselves more worried about their parents and older siblings.
P.S. for those playing "Spot the Sherlock Reference" along at home, I hope you enjoyed, Harry's very terrible Auror Trainee. Also as it is the 2000's how could I not reference Friends  ;) it should be obvious to most Friends fans. ;)
Once again and for always she is amazing.  She is my best cheerleader and without her you wouldn't still be reading this. Also to one of the best beta's I know, I am unworthy of her talent,
This will not be abandoned!  I am one chapter away from the ending and I promise a new chapter will be published every Sunday until the story is complete :)
“I couldn’t have. I canceled my-” he pales and looks over at an unsent note, “I guess I forgot. Did he-”
kept me up most of the night doing unspeakable things to my person.” Draco kissed him on the forehead and stood bringing his hips roughly level with Harry’s face. Harry grabbed his ass, pulling him close, and mouthing at his clothed cock, looking up at Draco through dark eyelashes.
After a minute or so, Draco pulled back breathless, staring into Harry’s bright, awestruck eyes. He brushed the hair out of his face bringing his palm to rest on Harry’s cheek, leaning in and planting a sweet, chaste kiss he smirked. “I have no idea how you managed before I came along to tell you you were an idiot.”
Draco’s heart was pounding and he nodded, “You can go now. C’mon B.J.. Do it. Please. Give me right now. Fuck everything else. I want one good thing just for right now.”
That’s when he saw him, laughing with a man and two women at the other end of the bar, that impish grin and those puckish eyes were unmistakable.
The smokers returned and everybody began to say their goodnights, gather their belongings and migrate outside. Harry was given several hugs and wishes that they’d see him again soon.
And then B.J. began laughing hysterically, “God Draco, where did you find her and where do I get mine? You are one lucky son of a bitch.”
Suddenly a tomato, a grape, a piece of bread and a taquito all came flying at him at once. “Gaaah!” he shouted as he ducked his head and threw up his arms to defend himself from the onslaught.
“But Draco,” Harry said quietly. “Why not? Just now... You clearly want me too. It makes sense, you and I. Surely you see that.”
Pansy lifted her glass and toasted the air. She finished her drink and reached for the replacement the waiter had just deposited in front of her.
“Oh, well spotted Potter,” said Draco, mask of sarcastic indifference firmly in place as he sat on his bed back leaned against the wall. “What tipped you off? The posted room assignments? Our names on the door? Or the fact that I am currently sitting in the bunk opposite yours in this little hellhole we now get to call home?”
P.S. In case you were wondering, when I wrote the first scene with Goldstein, I knew this epilogue would exist. I just really wanted him to get punched  It's literally the only reason I wrote an epilogue. ;)
“Yeah, I guess I am.” He set his cup down.” You are too. You look happier now than you ever did with me. He seems nice. I’m glad you found him.”
“If you don’t mind.” Harry looked up from a photo of Draco sandwiched between B.J. and Pans, a kiss on each cheek, at their New Year’s party.
“It’s because I love you, Harry Potter. Now go back to sleep. I gotta dash, I’m running late. Usually, I’m punctual, but I had a hard time waking up this morning.
“Also how do you know when the eggs are done? I tried to get one out, but then the yolk ran everywhere and I had to start over!”
"Well normally no for while it is called a Life Debt there is no way to claim the "debt." It just means you are connected to certain people, though if Heir Malfoy here is one that owes you a Life Debt it will create a strong bond between you two," Bonecrusher explained.
This story contained Harry getting adopted, Marriage Contracts Good Draco Malfoy, Dumbledore, Dobby, and Dursley family Bashing.  I also expect this to be a somewhat slow burn as well.  Oh and Dobby is not the Malfoy's House Elf.
"Well he is but I thought I would get some more help to hedge my bets," Harry lied not wanting to get into it.
When he finally reached the front of the line Lucius had a smile on his face from the plan on what he would do to Draco when this proved to be the inevitable waste of time. Either by chance or supernatural help, the Goblin Lucius ended up going to see was Grindstone. "Ah Lord Malfoy did you forget something from earlier?" Grindstone asked seeing the man returned only an hour and a half after he had left the bank with his son and Heir Potter.
"I think they are in the bottom of my trunk," Harry said making as if to get out of bed to go collect them thinking he would be asked to.
"Man you are dense I have been trying to flirt with you for a month," Luna said making herself comfortable on the older girl's lap,
Harry was not sure how to respond not wanting to reveal his and his friends' adventure with the Polyjuice Potion, but to his shock, it was Draco who answered.  "Well knowing I am an Alpha I can only assume that Harry's Omega side lead him down to our dorms.  Though how you went through the change and so soon I can't even begin to guess."  Everyone turned to look at Harry making him back up until he had scooted into one of the room's walls.
"Well, after being called to the edge of the forest last night I was more focused on Mr. Potter who was in a magical coma than your son faking a hurt leg," Madam Pomfrey said placing her hands on her hips and glaring at Draco's father.
"Oh, Harry," Draco said wrapping his arms tightly around Harry's body as he released a calming Alpha scent.
Besides the scroll he had gotten from Ron, Snape was soon handed the scrolls from Harry, Neville, and all the Fifth-Year Gryffindor girls in the class. After a quick look, Snape saw one common factor on each of the scrolls. Each of the students had been listed to have been enchanted by Hermione at some point in time. Both Harry and Neville had been enchanted to be loyal to the girl, but thinking of the change that had happened between Harry and the girl since his tutoring session Snape tapped the scroll to get a more detailed analysis and saw that due to the anger Harry was experiencing at finding out what she had been doing to him it had partially blocked out her spell. The other three Gryffindor girls had been enchanted to follow Hermione's order whenever they were in their shared bedroom as well as be unable to tell anyone about it.
"It was the brewing alright, now take this spell off me so I can go hide in a hole in the ground," Draco said.
Harry then asked Bonecrusher to cancel all the illegal Marriage Contracts that had been filed for him before he finally let himself be led to his Cleansing. As Harry was getting Cleansed, Draco waited in the Halls of Healing for his return, not letting the Goblin Healers treat him knowing they were going to St. Mungos next and figuring his mom would want to handle it herself. Lucius meanwhile had headed out after having one of his House Elves deliver the book list for First-Year students that were submitted to the Board so he could buy Harry all the books he was missing for his classes seeing it as a way to start his role of Godfather to the young boy. Sure he had been friends with James due to their families being allied and the pair of them had helped each other meet their wives, but he had never guessed that James would have made him Harry's Godfather. Lucius assumed it was mentioned in James and Lily's Will and he had not been contacted due to the Will being blocked from being read.
Thankfully both of them signed their approval leading Bonecrusher to take him to the appropriate Ritual room leaving the pair behind. "Not to be rude but what would have happened if they had not agreed to have me take part in the ritual?" Harry asked.
"What do you mean?" Narcissa asked as her husband had only shared with her Harry's medical history, not the test Harry had taken at Gringotts.
"I am not going to get sick it is just a cloak Ron, if Dudley's old rags don't make me sick I don't see how a cloak which was most likely cleaned at some point in the castle laundry could do it," Harry said.
"Oh no, people will find out I like to cook and still have a stuffed lion from when I was a kid on a shelf above my bed at home," Draco said rolling his eyes and catching Harry's eye making the brunette let out a soft giggle.
"Even the Goblins. Do you know how hard it is to shock a Goblin or what they looked like in such a state?"
"So you finally dropped that Mudblood trash Severus it was about time," a man with a nose that reminded Harry of Pansy Parkinson said in the memory as he threw his arm around Snape's slimmer form. "You know the Dark Lord could use a man like you with that marvelous skill of Potions you have. You could quickly rise through the ranks and have anything you want even that Mudblood skank," Parkinson said.
Almost every night would go mostly the same way, Draco would come home to find Harry in whatever gear/outfit he had picked out for the day. Harry would ask about Draco's day while massaging him. Before the pair would head to supper Harry, who was still on his knees before Draco, would pull out the other's cock and give him a quick blowjob. As Harry sucked him off Draco would do his best to pay attention to see if Harry touched himself, almost in a sort of game between the pair. If Harry could touch himself and get off without Draco seeing it Harry would be given the reward of "topping" Draco later. But if Draco noticed Harry touch himself just once Harry would get punished, which either involved spanking or being put into a cock cage for a while. Draco never really cared if Harry actually succeeded for Harry's idea of topping Draco was to have the blonde lay back on their large king-sized bed as Harry rode his cock. Draco had even let Harry know that that was not what topping was but Harry did not care having no other desire than to be the one penetrated.
"Well Bill and Charlie I don't see you really interacting with and they have no feelings one way or another about you. Mr. Weasley is Mr. Wealsey he is not one to lie or act differently than he seems, his wife on the other hand is the one who wants to help Ginny brew the love potions to give to you. Fred and George are more interested in pranks and Quidditch than really anything, though they are smarter than they act. Having sussed out my real nature rather than the carefree dreamer I pretend to be. They also confessed to me as a way to pay back of seeing my true self that they are in fact both Aromatic Asexuals. Now, Percy is rather ambitious but is overall a decent fellow, quite unlike your friend Ron who is actually rather lazy and is rather selfish is more interested in your fame and money than you as a friend. He also seems to be involved in the plot to give you Love Potions being the one who will dose your food and drink when they decided to start doing it," Luna said making Harry's heart sink at what his best friend was really was like if Luna could be believed.
"Due to the Headmaster prejudice against those with either creature blood or a dark core unless they come from a family that can pay for their own schooling," Snape said. "Like the Malfoys, he would never extend them the scholarship to attend leaving most to have to either be homeschooled or use the Ministry's bare minimum self-study program."
Harrison guessed that made sense as the three of them walked up the steps to a bright white front door with Lillies painted on it, quite unlike the Muggle townhouses situated around them which all had either black or brown doors. Harrison was told to open the door first since his Rings would be able to unlock it in case the place had been sealed. Feeling a small tingle of magic as he grabbed the nob Harrison heard the lock release letting him open the door to a brightly lit hallway filled with Magical Photos of what he assumed were his parents and their friends. After taking off his shoes he headed down the corridor thinking he would have time to look at the pictures later as he headed to a partially open door at the end beside a set of stairs going up to the second of four levels. Reaching the door he pushed it open revealing a small dining room with a circular wooden table with five chairs pushed in around it. Whoever designed the room made it look like it was outside with light blue paint on the ceiling and halfway down the walls the bottom half of the walls made it look like rolling hills in the distance, and the carpet almost looked like grass. Across the room from the door, he had entered from there was another door that had been painted to look as if it was a tree with a panel that was painted beside it that looked like a cloud. Checking out that door he saw it lead to the kitchen of the place where the two House Elves that were said to live and work were busy cleaning. As if they sensed him both turned as one to look up at him.
"Um, hello?" Harry said a little confused for the last thing he recalled was getting some money from his vault and got back into the cart then blackness.
The day that the Goblins had finished with the wards a sign appeared on all the notice boards within the Common Rooms letting everyone know that due to what they had found while working on the wards they had discovered some issues with student's magic affecting the wards, so they would be testing all the student to better determine who, if any, had messed with the wards. Seeing the notice in the Slytherin Mated Dorms Common Rooms the two pairs of mates laughed knowing the whole thing was a lie made up by Severus, Remus, and Tom to explain the need for the test to take place.
"I hope you don't mind but I and my new Guardians are checking this place out and possibly moving in," he said.
Once more the school's gossip mill had a new target as it turned from the Weasley twins finally finding a mate to Granger's parents. As the news spread through the school Madam Pomfrey found herself busy giving out potions to ease both student and staff stomachs as people had the misfortune of thinking of Dumbles and the Umbitch together in anything sexual. The fact that Hermione's Bearer was actually a Muggle man seemed to be pushed to the side as they thought of those together.
"Now we will not be learning this the same way I did, which is being exposed to a Boggart in the form of a Dementor. Mostly since to use it, I would have to stay closer to it than anyone else while leaving you all to test your spell work. Besides not knowing where a Boggart is I do not feel liking spending the meeting unconscious," Harry said to some laughs at his joke. "Now the main thing you need to know about casting a Patronus is that it requires you to focus on a happy memory. If that was it, it would not be too hard but you also have to do it while facing the presence of a being who can suck such happiness away. So to make this work I want you to pick your best memory, the moment in which you recall being at your happiest. The difference between a happy memory and your happiest memory, from what I have found, is a factor in if you produce a corporeal or non-corporeal Patronus," Harry explained. He then let everyone take a couple of moments to choose a memory that they thought would work for them.
"Ah Messer Potter," a voice said breaking him out of his research causing him to look up at the Librarian.
"Ah in our First-Year we came across a map created by James Potter and his friends that showed all of Hogwarts which we had been using to prank people for years before we gave it to Harrykins so that he could go to Hogsmead," George said causing Draco to give his Mate a disappointed look having not heard about this before.
Harry is reunited with his second new Guardian before he takes part in a ritual to get his stolen stuff back.
"Sure thing," Luna said airily as she snapped the book shut and handed it over. Pansy grabbed the book and pulled it towards her chest, only to find Luna had not let go causing her to pull the younger girl onto her lap. "I knew that would work," Luna said as she shocked Pansy when she made no move to get up.
Harry flinched back as Snape looked lived and he began to mutter to himself, ".... Bastard............ Lily never..... was ... lie." Snape closed his eyes and seemed to focus himself for a bit before he asked "And the scene with you and Malfoy?"
"Apparate?" Harry asked in confusion as Mr. Malfoy took out a pouch from his robes and threw some dust into the fireplace within Madam Pomfrey's office.
"Yeah I guess I was leaning too much on my cooking skills and the non-standard measurements that come with it," Harry said.
"It was not, your parents followed Albus Dumbledore's advice as they went into hiding using one of his own properties," Bonecrusher explained. "We tried to talk them out of it for the Potters had a longer and more Magical history than the Dumbledores in Brittian which means their properties would have better Wards and protections than anything that the Headmaster could provide even with him performing a Fidelius Charm on the property." Harrison's anger at the man grew even more for if he had not talked his parents into leaving their own home they might still have been alive and he would never have had to live with the Dursleys. With this thought alone Harrison decided to see if his new Guardians would like to live at Even's Haven with him so he could somewhat follow in his mom's footsteps. For the only reason, he could think that his mom would need a place to stay was if she had been forced to live with Petunia or someone after leaving Hogwarts.
"He might actually be telling the truth," Draco said shocking everyone.  Harry saw Blaise Zabini pinch himself as if to make sure he was not dreaming.
