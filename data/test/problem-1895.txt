"Fifteen points from Gryffindor for obscene language, Potter," Snape drawled, and the Gryffindor at his right inhaled sharply.
"How do I look?" he asked, smoothing down his crisp black suit.
It seemed the more he took the drug, the worse it hurt him afterwards, and he'd been making a serious dent in his supply that term.
, he thought to himself.
Whatever happened, whatever Malfoy said to hurt him in the future, however shitty he was, no one could take that knowledge away from Harry. Somehow, the thought comforted him.
Draco's grip on his hand tightened.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry shrugged. He knew there was nothing he could say to explain himself; they all knew why he was defending the other boy.
He and Malfoy had been sat right across the room from one another in Potions. It was the final lesson of the day, yet the Slytherin had been full of energy and was completely unperturbed by the distance; apparently still unable to leave Harry alone.
"Are you serious?"
Various Slytherins in Harry's year and the year above were scattered around the scene with bottles of Firewhiskey and suspicious-looking tiny bags of white powder in their hands, and several wands cast pretty colours into the night to illuminate the scene.
Peeves served to be his usual gleeful self, and rejoiced in how bad Harry looked. "Potty Potter, you look like a rotter!" He chanted happily, flitting around Harry and pulling on his hair, hard enough to hurt.
Malfoy licked his smirking lips and rested those beautiful hands calmly over his flat stomach. "Because I can. Because I wanted to prove you aren't over me."
"You guys go on without me," he said, turning to Pansy and Blaise, who could not conceal their mirth. "I'm going to, um... have some coffee."
flitted through Harry's head.
"Are you a fucking
"The trials," was all Harry could respond. "Oh, my god, the trials-"
Harry whooped ecstatically as the blonde landed in the freezing water beside him with a splash.
"No, I don't think I did," Harry grinned carelessly. He placed the now-empty glass back down by Draco, who recoiled as if he'd been slapped. "I was just saying what everyone else wanted to hear, anyway. I'm sure no one was shocked. And I certainly didn't see you complaining, by the way. Front-row seats, wasn't it?"
To watch the way his face contorted and let out those little electric hisses and moans, the way his eyes fluttered shut at some points, rolled back when it got to the end.
"Potter's in
Harry didn't know what to respond to that, but it was certainly true that more than one type of thirst was overwhelming him at that particular moment.
Suddenly it was all moving too fast; Draco's fingers were slipping from Harry's hair to play with his zipper, which was fine as long as he didn't undo it-
"What? What's wrong?" Draco sounded slightly panicked.
He could imagine the slow-burning rage on Narcissa and Lucius's faces if they'd been allowed to attend instead of sitting in their own cells awaiting trial, and this image spurred him on even further.
Harry sighed. "Ok, thanks, Oliver. You're just doing what you've got to do, I guess."
"What am I, your fucking
Luckily, he seemed more interested in Longbottom's cauldron, which was smoking violently for some reason no matter what he did to it - Neville had never been very good at Potions - and this kept the professor's beady eyes thankfully about as far away from Blaise and Pansy's station as it was possible to be.
"That wasn't me!" Harry snapped back, enraged now. "I don't know who that was, but the whole Amortentia thing is the most awful and mortifying thing to ever happen to me, so I'd have been the last person to spread it."
"But I swear I meant it, Draco, I really l-"
Draco frowned, confused.
Hermione had assured Harry that people would get swiftly bored of the gossip and the hassle would stop within a week, but three weeks after the fateful Potions class, the bullying was getting worse than ever.
Harry's life felt completely ruined.
"He wouldn't come back with us," a tall boy that Harry recognised as Theodore Nott informed him, striding over, Pansy Parkinson glued to his side. "He kept yelling for you."
"Come on Potter, we all know you can eat what you want and not put anything on because you're a hyperactive freak," the other boy reminded him.
"It hasn't even healed!" Draco protested, frightened.
"You're easier to hate than to like, anyway," Potter shrugged, "And I suppose I never stopped doing that even through all of this."
It was a Dementor's kiss, that's what it was like.
"Right here," Malfoy nodded icily. "I think you've got some making up to do."
"When have I ever said no to you?"
Draco himself was far less keen to rise and shine even by late afternoon. He'd sat through plenty of comedowns before in class, but this one was gearing up to be particularly earth-splitting.
Lily was just at the age where she was starting to ask questions about her mother, and Harry always tried to be as honest as he could, but it was getting difficult. Harry sighed, pulling his duvet up to his chest and snuffing out the lamp. Why was nothing simple, he wondered as he drifted slowly off to a fitful sleep.
"More," Draco shook his head, and then he kissed him with such love it was almost a tragedy, and the front of Harry's head exploded with white heat - this is euphoria, he said - Draco's skin glimmered under his touch.
Harry watched with self-righteous amusement as the boy began to turn red with indignation - he knew he couldn't deny the implications.
Malfoy coughed again, his chest heaving with the exertion. "Of course you don't," he hissed. "Because it isn't as simple as 'oh, Draco's coming down, Draco feels sad'. I get so anxious that it makes me want to tear my fucking skin off. I'm sick, Potter. I can't sleep. I have hallucinations. And now I have the complication of trying to hide all of that from YOU!"
"Yeah, but... what if your vial wasn't actual Amortentia after all? What if it was..." he paused to fully gauge the other boy's reaction. "What if it was literally my cologne?"
He knew it sounded an unlikely story - Malfoy walked like a model and would sooner starve than trip - and it was probably just to protect his own dignity as ever, but either way Harry appreciated the lie.
"See you on the other side," Harry nodded, the words sticking in his throat like hot glue.
Harry grinned and slammed Draco hard up against the wall and began to kiss the hell out of him. He'd been waiting for that.
"Listen, Draco, I love you, alright?" Harry sighed. "And I'll always love you. That's a constant. I know it the way I know the sun will rise, the way I know the tide will come in after it goes out, and the way I know you are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen."
"How else could I see it? You haven't explained it any better than that, or given me reason to think anything else! I literally don't know what you want."
Ron pulled a disgusted face. "You're a scummy little bastard, you know that, Malfoy?" he spat.
After a few more minutes he began to get cold and decided it was time to head back down to the castle; not to dinner, though. He didn't want to risk seeing Malfoy, as it was entirely likely he'd heard "the news" too, as Ginny had put it.
"You do that, babe."
"Why the fuck should I know?" he asked in irritation. "If he slipped off his little pet-play leash again, surely that's more Weaslette's domain than mine."
"I just wanted to-"
Malfoy nodded awkwardly. "I don't want you to say it, though."
"I mean bloody hell, Ronald, what if he just ran off into the Forbidden Forest or something?" she asked hysterically, pacing around the Gryffindor Common Room.
"This appears to be quite compelling evidence," the Judge smiled, his eyebrows raised in surprise at the event. "Normally I'd order silence in court again, but this is intriguing - all these students who supposedly hate the defendant, coming out in his defence... I've never seen anything like this before."
Malfoy scoffed. "Me, leave you alone? Which of us fully assaulted the other just now and dragged him out of the Hall to get him alone? Which of us smelled the other in his Amortentia? Which got kicked off the Quidditch team for being too focused on the other Seeker?"
Malfoy raised an eyebrow suggestively. "Well, if you're offering..."
"Do you realise what you're asking when you beg for me to be closer to you, Potter?" he croaked. "Do you know what a nightmare I am? What terror I am capable of? I'd kill you from the inside out, you know I would."
," Malfoy had told him that last night by the lake. Harry wasn't sure how hard Malfoy ever tried not to hurt him, exactly, but it was nice to pretend he did nonetheless.
"Proud of it, babes," Draco smirked camply. Harry froze a little at the pet name, pretending to act cool but failing. His dark hair had been whipped up over his forehead a little by the wind too, and Draco's fingers reached over to push it back. He heard Harry's breath catch in his throat, which he tried to mask with a fake cough, and laughed.
A small vial of Draco's cologne ("He has plenty, he won't even know!" said Blaise), some of his unreasonably expensive hair gel and broom polish, a green apple to be crushed, a vanilla pod from the kitchen, a tiny extract of the fabric softener used on Draco's clothes and sheets, and some fresh spearmint from the castle gardens.
It was one of Malfoy's macabre self-portraits.
Malfoy was the sun, he knew that, and Harry was Icarus, irresistibly drawn to his light without any sense of self preservation. So he put chains on his heart, chains of hatred and malice and fear, and those bound him to the ground, for which he was grateful.
"You didn't ask me to stay," Malfoy replied quietly. "And besides, I was angry."
And with that, he turned and ran from the room, unable to see or hear anyone or anything that wasn't his pain.
"Can you feel it, Draco?" Narcissa added. The same odd evangelical light glimmered in her eyes too, and Draco felt suddenly sick. "The Dark Lord needs his servants!"
It was deliriously appealing to Harry, perhaps not because it was Malfoy's specifically, but because there was something so attractively masculine and rich in it that it made his head spin.
And he had, for now. But however bad Harry had imagined Draco would be on the pitch, he was a thousand times worse. And all the support in the world from Ron couldn't make Harry feel any less awful over it.
he thought
Harry stepped down from the witness stand and dropped back into his seat behind Draco and his lawyer, neither of whom turned, though Draco's neck stiffened somewhat. Then he watched, heart in his mouth, as the elderly researcher took to the stand, introduced himself and began to unfold a sheet of parchment.
"If you play your cards right, don't see why not."
"For goodness' sake, Draco, what did you expect? We're all queer Purebloods," Pansy rolled her eyes. "Surely you can't think it's just you who's ever tried to hide your thoughts from your parents?"
"Sometimes I swear you live in a different world, mate," he muttered.
do that, but no one fucking believed me because you wouldn't shut up about it!"
Draco bleeding, spitting, swearing, lashing out at him, slamming him against the wall, kissing him hard to embarrass him, laughing about it later.
"Hadn't you better be going to Hall soon?" he asked lazily. "Obviously I'd rather you stayed, this is going to kick in relatively quickly and it tends to massively increase my sex drive, but I understand you may have other plans."
She probably wouldn't think about it, though, and Malfoy probably didn't deserve an apology, but Harry felt powerless if he didn't at least ask. Despite it all, he found he still wanted to win favour with the other boy, in the hopes that he'd - what? Fuck him again? Love him? Maybe not laugh about his dead parents again? He didn't know.
? Draco-"
And with that, Draco slipped off his jacket and wrapped it round Harry's shoulders before he could protest. Harry stared at him, open mouthed.
"You came!" he sighed happily, and the blonde nodded.
Harry screwed up his eyes in focus, determined to think harder.
"Malfoy-"
He took one last look, then slipped it into his pocket alongside the other photo of his daughter that he carried everywhere.
"I don't even keep a diary!" Harry snapped hotly, but of course he was ignored.
The rumours were true. Malfoy was pretty good in bed, though perhaps 'against locker' would be a more accurate phrase. The boy certainly knew what he was doing either way.
"Didn't know he was a poof," he muttered incredulously to Blaise and Pansy, who didn't respond.
"It's just colour," he shrugged. "It could mean anything. Don't get so ahead of yourself. I bet it's just a response to a kiss, anyway - if I was to kiss Pansy later it'd show the same thing."
A quick glance at his page told him that he'd been absent-mindedly sketching the boy as he thought. There he was, only half-drawn, but unmistakably him. Angular features, open mouth, eyes that drank him right up. He was covered in love.
"What the fuck is wrong with you?" Harry turned around, wiping spit from his lips with his robe sleeve.
"You have a giving kink?" Harry perked up. "And sexual morals?"
But Draco, unnerved by Harry's reaction the first time around, didn't spit on him again, sticking instead to verbal conflict while maintaining a healthy distance from the other boy.
"I don't- what the fuck did you-"
He made his way up a steep slope towards the forest, where he found a rock to lean against with his back to the castle.
Potter used to call him
"Nothing," he declared to the room with a strange smile. "I felt nothing."
"Alright, Potter?" Malfoy whispered.
Draco realised.
"Yeah? Well, I need to come. Are we doing this, or not?"
"Expected better of me how?" Harry had demanded, though he already knew where this was going.
"And I didn't have anything better to do the other night so I was thinking about that and I watched your name move around on the Marauders Map while I was wank-"
Draco's heart thudded. "I understand why you wouldn't," he replied in his usual arrogant tone, though it was harder to force than normal. He sighed, then dropped the pretence, it wasn't making anyone laugh any more. "Look, Potter, I'm sorry, alright? I wish things could've been different, too. I wish I wasn't like this. I wish I didn't ruin everything. But I do."
, he thought.
, taunted the voice in his head, but he refused to let himself believe it.
"I like to know where I stand," Harry replied simply. "So, yeah."
Draco's head snapped up. The only other boys in the room were Crabbe, Goyle, Potter and the Weasley kid; she must've been talking to him.
"Your Mark?" Harry asked, propping himself up on one elbow.
"But?"
He looked around at the gaggle of panicked Slytherins above them. "Would anyone like to prove me wrong? Say he hasn't been high, and he- what, slipped?"
"Well, could you do it quietly?" Draco huffed. "You've successfully ruined any chance I had of finishing this book in here, so I'm going up to bed. And I would prefer not to be disturbed by your moronic laughter again. Whatever you're plotting, leave me out of it."
Harry wiped his eyes gently under his glasses, and sighed heavily. He was still crying, even while fantasising.
Part of him was annoyed with Potter for changing the dynamic between them so dramatically. How was he meant to be a dick to him now if Potter would be constantly fantasising about him like everyone else? What if he liked it?
Harry stared at himself in the mirror, turning round to admire how nice Draco's name suddenly looked splashed across his back like that.
"No problem sweetie, you know that. She's been so good," Hermione beamed, and Ron nodded in agreement, jogging Hugo gently in his arms as he began to snuffle. Harry smiled back and thanked them again, before closing his eyes and Apparating away into the dark.
he thought again.
"Stop biting your lip," Draco panted, skimming a thumb over Harry's mouth. "Shit, it's bleeding now, you stupid prat."
But Harry knew about the red sugar stain on Malfoy's tongue, the huge dark holes of his pupils beneath his fluttering eyelids, the black water in his lungs, and the burnt soot that not even the Lake could take out of his hair.
Harry realised, She might take me back. He wondered how he felt about that. It didn't take much wondering. Everyone knew his heart was somewhere else now, regardless of the reasons why.
"For what?" Malfoy said again, more exasperated this time. "I don't know what you want, Potter."
"It's Draco," Pansy gasped as soon as Harry opened the door to her. Real terror was ripped across her face. "He's in the fucking Lake!"
Malfoy's eyes flashed venomously, but he let Harry drop to slump against the wall.
Malfoy swallowed, looking like the next words were difficult to say. "So I could apologise for my embarrassing behaviour," he eventually managed, wincing a little.
Besides, there were the rings.
"I know, darling," Harry said, his voice equally strained. The nickname was a reflex response to Draco's fear and had just slipped out, but he didn't regret it. "We'll think of something to make sure you're alright, I promise. But that is fucking scary."
After he was left outside the Hall by Malfoy that night, there was no better word for Harry's emotional state from that point onwards than destroyed.
"You're still here," Malfoy glared when he emerged from the changing rooms, looking delightfully ruffled-up in the way that Harry liked him best.
Harry steeled himself and forced the words out, though they tasted like poison in his mouth. "We're not," he said.
Memories ripples through the front of his brain; him and Harry lying in the wildflowers, the way he made the sun shine in the sky when they were together. In all the times he'd rescued him and taken him back to bed, Harry had saved more than Draco's life and he hoped he knew that. He'd saved his soul.
"Here?" Harry asked. Another gulp. He was anxious.
Granger stiffened. "It's Hermione," she frowned. "Are you sure you're alright?"
paradisedraco
"And I have an idea for a way we could hurt him."
With that, Harry could take no more, and grabbed Malfoy by the front of his robes to drag him aside himself before he could just leave with his friends.
He began to count on his fingers -
But for every 'A' he got on an essay, every successful Quidditch game, Harry felt a pang of resentment, as these were signs that Malfoy wasn't present in his life any more. It just kept getting better without him. And he hated it.
Harry sighed; he hadn't even known she was there.
"We have to fucking hurt him, you moron, he doesn't know what he's doing anyway," Blaise snarled, struggling to wrench Malfoy's arms behind his back.
"He's gone too fucking far this time," Draco had seethed, bursting into the Slytherin Common Room and slamming his books dramatically down on the table. He was always one to make an entrance.
Harry thought; "Am I scaring you, Potter?!" Draco screamed.
"Never know when I'm going to get jumped by the Chosen One, do I?" Malfoy sneered. He slid his Quidditch joggers and boxers confidently down to rub three fingers' worth of the liquid solution over himself.
"Why not?"
"Don't be such a coward!" Harry laughed. "I should've known you'd wimp out. Come and get your non drug-related thrill. It's good for you!"
Harry felt like he was on fire. "You are the one obsessing over this, Malfoy, and you are the one hurting me!" he shouted, no longer caring if people came out of the Hall and heard them.
"Not really," Malfoy replied. He took his pictures back out of Harry's trembling hands before he could look at them properly, to Harry's mild irritation.
She turned to Harry. "Keep him with you, will you, Potter? There's no controlling him at the best of times, but he's worse when he's high and he seems to have decided he wants you specifically."
Draco preened, smoothing back his hair arrogantly as the questions were fired around him.
"I told you," he choked out against the pressure of Malfoy's hand, but regretted the boast a second later when his lip was bitten hard between sharp white teeth, hard enough to make him yelp a little.
"I saw him!"
The smallest flicker of a butterfly began to rise in his stomach, and Harry's eyes snapped open.
it's about me! I just want to know whatever you were laughing about the other day, what 'hint' I didn't get which I'm now paying the price for!"
But he didn't protest at the familiar biting roughness of the kiss, or at the pain of Malfoy's rings tangling through his hair, or even when Malfoy forced the Gryffindor jumper up over his head to make Harry shiver in the November air (keeping his own green jersey hypocritically down), though Harry knew that that was as much an act of Malfoy's cruelty as his desire.
Conflict consumed him. Wasn't this what he wanted - Potter publicly worshipping him, making him feel even more desired than usual?
The Slytherin managed a smile. "I am physically capable of that, you know."
In fact, seeing the subject of his most intense dream in the flesh made Harry's heart-rate skyrocket and his hands clench in need.
"Thanks guys, I'll try," he said. "I don't think Slytherin are going to take it easy on me, though. I've got a bad feeling about this match."
"Yes, Hokey?" Malfoy asked. Harry watched from afar as the other boy stopped entirely and then crouched right down to be at eye-level with the elf, the way one might address a small child.
A hush fell over the courtroom as he rose: everyone recognised him instantly. He'd made sure to act as a caricature of himself with big thick-lensed glasses and his black messy hair pushed back in just the right place to reveal his scar.
"Of course you keep lube in your locker," Harry said sarcastically as the other boy stretched up to grab the bottle, revealing a neat little V line above his Quidditch sweats.
"I know, I know," Pansy preened. "Now, come on. We'd better get all that stuff together. We've got some Draco to brew!"
"What, Santa doesn't come to bad boys?" Malfoy asked, gliding his tongue over his lower lip seductively.
"Fine, don't cry over me then," Malfoy smirked. "That was always your decision, not mine. See if I care."
As Harry approached the bed, he took a small amount of pleasure in the knowledge that Draco would probably be disappointed not to see him. He knew the blonde played better when Harry was there for him to show off to, and to deprive him of this was very pleasing.
"You always say that and you never do!" Harry snapped, feeling awful at the shock on the other boy's face but too angry to stop. "What am I meant to do, Draco? Answer me. What would you do if it was me? Would you let me throw my life away and die young like this?!"
Then, "It's similar," he responded. "I can never capture much of you. But I get the sense."
They'd dropped hints to him that morning on what they were planning to do, but he was apparently wilfully refusing to understand them; still in a bad mood from the night before.
March bled into April and the Lake stopped icing over at night, not that Harry knew about that. He'd been firm when he told Blaise he wasn't to be called again in the night for Draco, and the Slytherins had more or less left him alone since that discussion.
to the point of danger, then forced himself out before his muscles seized and dragged him under.
"Reckon you can keep your emotions under control and ignore the Serpents in the crowd?" Oliver had asked, and Harry nodded confidently.
Hermione grimaced. "Don't be foul, Malfoy. I'm only asking because this is all your fault. Why can't you ever be fucking normal and not be vile to people?"
Blaise watched as his friend scrawled frantically in her notebook, stopping every few seconds to splutter with laughter.
Trelawney was shaking at the front of the room, clearly on the verge of tears again. What was an emotional wreck like her doing teaching at Hogwarts, Draco wondered? Fortune teller my right arse cheek. Didn't see any of that coming, did she??
Malfoy blinked at him. "I didn't bring swim stuff. I don't own swim stuff."
"Permitted," the Judge nodded.
Pansy grabbed some rosewater and pearl dust from the counter just to give colour and sparkle to the potion, and then set about secretly sliding the ingredients into the cauldron. The plan, meanwhile, was that Blaise would chop the actual Amortentia ingredients so as not to draw Snape's attention, and Pansy prayed for the entire lesson that he wouldn't come over.
"Yeah, it's 'cause I hate him," Draco replied overly aggressively. "I hate him." He said again, louder, daring her to disagree. She only smirked again, that infuriating knowing look she did that she knew annoyed the hell out of her best friend.
It had been mortifying enough when Malfoy found out Harry had been sleeping in his bed over the Christmas holidays - the telltale sign had obviously been that Malfoy's was the only unmade bed in the dorm, and besides, Harry had left more than one of his hoodies carelessly on the bedpost.
Malfoy shrugged, casual amusement evident on his face. "Fun?" he suggested.
Words like
"I think you're going to have to comfort Potter later after his big defeat on the pitch, what do you say, Weaselby? You and those creepy brothers of yours could Eiffel Tower him."
"Draco, I'm sorry," he whispered. The words were beginning to lose their meaning, but he kept saying them. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for everything I've done..."
Another nod. "Obviously, yeah."
"Malfoy!" Harry choked, slapping a hand over the other boy's mouth in the dark. "People are sleeping in here!"
"I meant it."
Malfoy's face screwed up painfully. He still had that high sort of glow about him, Harry could see that now, but he was clearly not having a good time with it.
you?"
He knew it sounded awful but no matter how headstrong she acted, Ginny still couldn't say no to him if he asked to stay with her, and Harry was very grateful for this little fact.
"I feel bad about how things started with us," Draco announced one sunny day when the two of them were sprawled over the grass in the morning light. They were at the little place in the countryside that Draco was renting, and Harry had taken to visiting most days from the Burrow.
"The paint- it's reading you!" he gasped. "Malfoy! I think I know that feeling!"
Their hands were still clasped above Harry's head, and his grip tightened as Draco tipped his head in to kiss the other boy's lips. Their eyes drifted shut as it deepened, and it was becoming really cold but all Harry could think about was how achingly happy he was in that moment.
Bloody weirdo.
And how he never found another like him.
Malfoy laughed. "What are we, twelve?"
The new fire flickered a little brighter in his core as he pictured the artfully nonchalant look on Draco's face when he'd handed over the card. '
!" Draco almost yelled. "I
"He's going to steal his hair gel," Ron choked, and Hermione's laughter echoed off the walls delightedly. "Why don't you just lick his toothbrush while you're at it, Harry? Are you going to sniff his boxers too?"
Harry grinned. "Probably not. S'okay, Hermione's pointed them out on plenty of occasions, but I don't think I'm that bad."
He felt practically invincible walking around and knowing Malfoy couldn't hurt him any more because he had decided to enjoy it, and nothing gave him more pleasure than the torturous discomfort on the Slytherin's face whenever he was around.
Then there came a mess of charcoal, the emblem of a fractured mind, and finally an uncanny line drawing, a sketch of the Dark Mark beaming a grizzly grin out of a dark suit.
when you told me about it-"
"I'm sorry, Potter, but you don't fancy me," Draco practised saying, and it sounded so ridiculous that he'd have laughed if it wasn't for how angry he still was.
"What hint?" he demanded. "I always get hints."
He'd also written long letters to his mother and father and Sirius, the only people he trusted to confide in about Draco. The secret little black box he kept hidden under his bed was chock full of letters he'd written over the years at Hogwarts but never sent. When he was a first year, he'd even written the odd reply from James and Lily, something he'd never admit to anyone.
"You'll be fine, mate," Ron insisted, and Hermione agreed. Secretly, though, both were equally terrified for him. They knew all too well what Malfoy was capable of.
"Draco is a recovering addict," he said, his words ringing out confidently across the room. "He took ecstasy several times a week for the entirety of his past school year as he'd sunken into a severe depression and it was the only way he could get happy. The problem was only addressed when he left Hogwarts at the end of the Spring term, shortly before the battle."
Draco watched impassively as Harry retched into the dark depths of the container. "You're making more mess for us to clean up," he said irritably.
"I saw Draco throw his wand to Harry Potter!"
this," he whispered icily, "Don't you, Potter?"
"I'm fucking sorry, Harry, alright?"
"So they are," he acknowledged. "And very nice they are too."
"God, are all you Gryffindors trying to bloody kill me today?!" Draco asked, exasperated.
"Come on, Potter," Malfoy goaded him, annoyed by the lack of response. "You wanted my attention. You've got it."
The other Slytherins guffawed and Harry felt like a sex criminal.
Harry watched in awe as his own image began to reflect back at him off the page.
"He has to breathe, Potter, do you know how to make him breathe?!" Blaise asked as they pushed, his eyes wide with panic.
He'd managed to avoid Malfoy entirely since The Incident, but there was no avoiding him today - he was the opposition Seeker, for fuck's sake. He'd be all over him.
Visions of Potter's brazen face as he openly degraded himself in front of the entire student body filtered through Draco's eyelids every time he closed them, and he heard a bold voice spill out over his memories.
One thing Harry was sure about either way was that he didn't want to sit with his own thoughts any longer, so he pulled his robes and slippers on without further thought, and padded out of the dorm and down towards the calming wooden arches of the library.
Malfoy certainly didn't seem to think it changed anything, though, and Harry wondered what exactly was wrong with the other boy's mind - surely he couldn't possibly think it was totally normal to take your enemy's virginity, and not something to discuss?
, you two are fucked up."
It was at this point that Pansy and Blaise decided it would be far funnier just not to tell Draco at all for now, and let him be just as surprised as Potter.
Now it was Draco's turn to be tormented by his own mind.
"Ok, well you should know there's a hell of a comedown. Tomorrow's going to be a write-off and probably the two days after that too."
Silence reigned over the room for a good half hour, apart from some irritable banging of the cauldrons and cleaning products, until finally Harry caved.
As soon as the items landed in his lap, he opened the book roughly to find a clean page, and began to sketch. Quick, fluid lines over the paper, only glancing up now and again to capture the thoughts on Harry's face.
As it turned out, Malfoy's suggestions were in fact the correct instructions for the potion, but he knew his reputation meant the two Gryffindors wouldn't trust him, and instead he watched on in delight while they effectively sabotaged their own potion.

"Maybe not to you!" Ginny's eyes brimmed with angry tears. "But I really liked you, Harry. So it matters to me. And it matters to everyone else."
, he thought.
"My bed or yours when you come running to save me tonight?" he'd asked mockingly under his breath on his way past the Gryffindor table, and Harry seriously thought about slapping him.
The only problem was his hair. It always stuck up at odd angles, he would never be able to make it lie flat even if he'd had the amount of gel that Malfoy used to slather on in third-year. Harry ran his hands desperately through it and eventually decided to just push the front bit up into a little quiff. At least then it was supposed to stick up.
Malfoy's lip quirked up nastily and he looked Harry slowly up and down, letting the weight of his gaze drip over his enemy's body like hot paint.
"The laboratory was instructed by Mr. Malfoy's lawyer to run tests on the contents of the blood in his client's Mark. We were specifically examining it for traces of the Class A drug known as MDMA, or ecstasy, and of course you know that any trace of such intoxicants in the blood sample would render the participant legally incapable of consent. We tested Mr. Malfoy's Mark this week and the results came back today."
Harry had an answer for that question, though Malfoy never liked to hear it. "It's because he fucking loves you, idiot," he whispered to the page.
He was meant to fall to his knees immediately in delight upon Draco's return, and kiss the ground he walked on, or at least offer to suck his dick behind the broom sheds. Not bloody ignore his insults over the welcome feast, and refuse to sit by him in Astronomy again.
"Wait," Harry panted. "Please stop."
"You've got a dirty fucking mind, Potter," he managed with a shake of his head.
but Malfoy was a talented wandless wizard and deflected it quickly. There was almost no point Hexing him.
"Doesn't mean I like you," he assured him, turning back to his book. He'd been on the same page for the past ten minutes.
Suddenly Draco was crying, and the sight was so surreal it took Harry a second to react.
in his Amortentia," Blaise winked, and as usual Draco didn't get the hint.
Harry's mind was in a whirl. He was sick to the point of losing sleep over the whole disgusting complicated situation, terrified by his own emotions and the lack of trust he suddenly found in them.
"We don't have to do this," he whispered painfully on the third or fourth occasion, and Malfoy's expression became pleading.
Blaise's hand found Pansy's under the desk for a quick high-five, and they shared a secret grin. Draco, meanwhile, was bemused. "What the fuck is wrong with Potter?" he hissed.
"It's not his diary, really," Harry clarified. "It's his art book, but he writes his thoughts in it too. And I read so many of them. He scared the hell out of me when he caught me."
Nothing could have prepared him for the contents.
With Malfoy dutifully silenced and intent on his lollipop once more, Harry focused his mind on cleaning the wounds on the boy's knees and shins, using what little Healer magic he knew.
Draco stared numbly at the words he'd written in his art book, words he hadn't even managed to adorn with more than a vague serpent-like scribble.
"I'll make it worth your while if you're nice to me," Harry insisted. "And besides, studying is something I like to do with my friends. And I'd like to be more like friends with you, if we can't be anything else. Just - come with me. Please?"
He really had meant to leave. Truly. He could so easily have turned his back on the sleeping angel - no, devil by now - and headed safely up to his own bed in the Gryffindor dorms. At least, that's what he told himself later.
"Why did you save me like that earlier?" he asked when he was done, wiping a shaking sleeve across his mouth and Draco knew instantly what he was referring to.
"More sausages, dear?" Molly interrupted with a smile and a laden tray. "Better get in quick before Fred and George are up!"
"Draco, you're embarrassing yourself, come out of the way," Harry hissed, though he knew the other boy wouldn't pay much attention. "If this is all for my benefit then you can stop now, I get your point. I understand what you're doing. Just stop."
he reminded himself.
Hopefully Ron and Hermione would understand, and if not, he found it hard to care. This wasn't their problem to deal with, and they didn't understand how massive it was to him already.
"Christ, Potter," Draco laughed, laying a restraining hand on Harry's arm. "It isn't gonna disappear, have some bloody restraint!"
Draco found his hand to also be frequently drawn to his lips after the event, though more in frustration and disgust than anything else. He still couldn't believe Potter had had the sheer audacity to try something like that on him; couldn't the bastard take a fucking hint?!
"And you're all over it," the dark-haired boy shot back.
"Harry, would you care to explain what the bloody hell just happened?" Hermione snapped angrily, jerking him out of his thoughts as she swept out of the classroom.
But Pansy was there, and she sounded hysterical. And the space beside Harry where Draco had lain was long cold.
Another kiss, another flick, higher this time, on more sensitive skin.
"Another threatening letter arrived from Draco's mother this morning," Harry said, skimming the envelope onto the table in front of Ron and Hermione.
Draco wondered if maybe he should go immediately over and show Potter the page, reveal the truth, but something stopped him. He couldn't decide what it was - maybe embarrassment, or an unusual lack of desire to make a scene in class - but whatever it was, it was powerful, so for once he stayed away.
He fished out a few select pages - all of Harry, some more explicit than others, some of which had words attached, too.
Draco groaned. He knew the witch would twist the story into making him look like a predator who had actually wanted to kiss Potter rather than his real intentions to hurt him - in which he'd apparently been successful.
No response.
He wasted no time in rushing to Ron and Hermione.
"Malfoy, why don't you just go back to your own fucking party and leave us alone?" Harry demanded, and the blonde swung tipsily round, a menacing expression on his face.
Their laughter echoed off the walls on their way out, and Draco slammed his head on the table with a barely repressed groan. He kept his forehead pressed to the cool wooden surface as he waited for his blood pressure to drop to a normal level once more, and for the anger to seep out of his body like the tide.
"You have to stop doing this," he swore, shaking his head as he dragged a frustrated hand across his lips. "Is this just how you deal with complicated feelings? You just kiss people?"
"You're really spiteful, you know that?" Harry wept, oblivious. "I'm trying to tell you how hard I'm falling for you while you're standing here looking like you hope I fall all the way, right to my death."
"I forgive you," he whispered, without the other boy saying sorry, "I know what you can't say, and I forgive you for it."
"Viagra."
But some Slytherin instinct in Harry, the part recognised by the Sorting Hat in First Year, came over him and insisted it would be a good idea to sneak Malfoy's sketchbook out from its hiding place under the bed and have a quick peek at what he'd missed the last time. It had to be interesting; Malfoy was very defensive of it.
Harry was instantly jolted from his dream by the noise, somehow immediately aware that the knocking was for him.
"I can't," Harry hissed, loathing radiating off his every cell as he spoke. He glanced around; everyone else was busy packing up to leave and was paying no attention to them, so he felt safe to speak.
"I'm cold-blooded anyway," Draco shrugged, "And besides, we're nearly back at the castle, I'll take you to the Slytherin dungeon so you can warm up since it's nearer."
-ed it for himself, making sure the shaker clunked his friend's skull on the way past.
he thought.
There was a light breeze in the air which ruffled the wildflowers and sent a heavenly sweet scent over the scene, and birds could be heard singing softly in the trees above. A small shade was cast in a diagonal blanket over their bodies, and it was cooling and calm.
." She laughed unkindly. "Did you think about him every time we did it, or just most times? If you closed your eyes, could you pretend I had blonde hair?"
Harry's eyes pricked with tears of sympathy. "You should always have good days," he whispered.
"You can talk, Potter," Draco smirked, glancing pointedly down at Harry's lap. "We both know that's what you'll be doing the second I'm gone."
Draco laughed a cold, short laugh with no humour in it. "Oh yeah, we will."
"A few times, yeah," Blaise rolled his eyes. "It's kind of his signature thing. Library's a new place though, he normally fucks up the Common Room. And it's not usually this bad."
"What are you going to do, Malfoy?" he asked, confrontation heavy in his tone. "Kiss me again?"
Lips met lips, tongue met tongue, and each boy tangled a hand hard through the other's hair for heightened sensation. Malfoy's other hand reached for Harry's throat and began to press skilfully either side of his windpipe, choking him as he desperately fought for more contact, always more and more and more.
He was still standing but he leant back against the cauldrons behind him for support as he began to feel more of the heat of Harry's mouth. His tongue moved faster, he wasn't speaking any more - now it was Draco's turn to apologise, he knew that -
Harry let out a small sound that sounded like a cry, and Draco brushed over it as quickly as he could.
That didn't look much like "getting better".
"Saint Potter," Malfoy hissed, spitting hard and wet in Harry's direction on the "P".
His friend was still weirded out that the revelation that Harry might be in love with the boy who'd bullied them all for years, but he did his best to be supportive.
"Oh yeah, terribly funny," replied Malfoy, inspecting his silver rings with an air of forced boredom. "What you don't understand, Potter, is that everyone is attracted to me. I've banged my way through half my house and half yours too, so be humble."
"Wow, thanks for the reminder, Neville," Harry said sarcastically, but he took five drops of the solution without being asked again, and prepared himself to talk about Malfoy for the foreseeable future.
he thought.
"I thought maybe you might want a way to get a thrill without scrambling your brain with all the fucking molly you take," Harry said wryly. "Fancy a dip?"
again? It was mortifying.
It was a familiar paternal image, and innocent enough on the surface: the age-old tableau of a father passing a bottle to his little boy.
"Lots of purple ones." Harry said awkwardly, not meeting my eye.
"Ooh, Malfy's grumpy today!" The poltergeist's eyes lit up. "Want some more porridge, Malfy?"
"Congratulations," Malfoy forced himself to say in a nasty tone, though his heart wasn't quite in it as it normally would be. "Happy Orphan-Day for yesterday. If I'd known, I'd have bought a gift."
"It's an invitation!" Harry said in surprise, reading the shimmering printed message.
"I'll ask him," Harry replied. "He never used to say no to me."
He didn't know what fascinated him so much about the idea of Potter's attraction to him - it was true what he'd told him; he was not short of admirers by any means. Whatever it was, it fed his vanity excellently, and he found himself spending even more time on his appearance to get as much attention as he could.
"Fucking hell!"
"I saw him throw it," added Hermione in a clear, confident tone.
Malfoy cut him off with a withering glare.
reckless?!" he bellowed, and Malfoy cowered away from him into the ground. "You stupid,
Draco knew that question was coming but it still hurt. "I'm not sure," he replied honestly. "As of tomorrow I'm barred from the school grounds, and I can't exactly imagine you visiting me at the mansion, anyway. And as for rehab - don't bother visiting me there if you aren't bringing ecstasy. I'll need something to while away the time, won't I?"
"I just don't know how to talk to you," Draco whispered, but this evidently wasn't the right thing to say either.
Draco rolled over so he was half on top of him, his breath honeyed and warm against Harry's lips. "Yeah, but I could still show you how it should've been done," he said. "If you'd like me to."
any nice things to say during sex? I don't think I've ever heard you be nice!"
Fucking Trelawney making him trip. He hoped she fell from the fucking top. Hoped she took Potter and his mates with her. Hoped they kept sliding down down to the basement and fucking stayed there to rot.
Ron's breathing was still heavy and it was clear he wasn't letting Malfoy off the hook in a hurry, but he was listening now at least.
" he said, not meeting Harry's gaze.
"I’ll be fine, I kept these," Draco smiled, pulling a dozen of the jellybeans Harry had given him out of his pocket. They both grinned.
Harry dropped into a seat at the far end of the Gryffindor table, and stated to help himself to some hot porridge from the big bowl in front of him and buttered himself some toast. He wasn't hungry, he just wanted something to do other than stare at the back of Malfoy's neck.
"Where were you all morning?" The blonde boy asked, steering Harry round the corner where they could talk more privately.
The suspense burnt through Pansy's body like a live wire, even causing her to shake slightly. Potter had it in his hand, the lid was off, his eyes were closed as he raised it to his nose -
It was one of the odd occasions that Malfoy hadn't slept in Harry's bed or vice versa but Harry knew the other boy would be awake already for the Slytherin Quidditch practice, and he intended to sneak down and watch him for a bit before taking him off for the day to monopolise his attention.
"Yeah? Next time you get lonely, why don't you contaminate someone else's bed?"
Harry's hands formed tight fists round his cutlery, and he hadn't touched his food. Draco noticed this with spiteful triumph: he was getting under his skin, alright.
This is a trick, Draco's rational Slytherin mind told him, so he stayed silent, forcing himself simply to stare up at the other boy with his usual demeanour artificial amusement and contempt.
"You stink of cigarettes," Lucius informed him sharply, narrowing his eyes as Harry walked in.
Draco had barely sat down at breakfast on the last day before the Christmas break when the letter drifted neatly down onto his plate. He recognized his Father's flawless sloping print on the envelope almost immediately, and opened it cautiously at one end with his butter knife. A letter on the last day of term didn't tend to be good news, or it would've waited till he got home tomorrow. Draco slid the letter out and read it slowly. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.
"Do you think you could ... go without it for a bit now?" Potter sounded almost timid, shy, words Draco would never normally associate with the boy.
"Yes, you can fly with me, Potter," Draco rolled his eyes, looking around to see where the Gryffindor was hiding. "Come out then, you knob."
"Malfoy," Harry smirked.
This was the final straw. Harry felt something inside him snap, and he lunged right over his desk to kick the restrained boy as hard as he could in the groin.
It was a great surprise to exactly nobody, therefore, when the time came to test the potions, and Harry and Neville's concoction looked nothing like anybody else's. Instead of being clear, still, and odourless, theirs was cloudy, extremely effervescent, and with a slight smell of carbon about it.
"Did I do something wrong?" he faltered, getting shakily to a standing position.
Draco was bereft as he watched the killing of Harry Potter, and let out an almost inhuman wail as he watched the other boy's body crumple. Harry Potter, dead? The boy who fucking lived, dead??
"Let's just say he might have smelt something
"Show me," Draco whispered back, tangling his hands harder in Harry's hair.
Fucking Malfoy.
"Do watch your step as you go down from this tower. I already know you're going to trip, but watch it anyway."
"Are you... do you think you're looking forward to seeing him?" Hermione asked tentatively.
"Do you think we ought to tell Draco it isn't real?"
He snatched his leather jacket off the hook, and Harry felt his body relax as he heard the loud crack that meant his boss had Apparated.
The professor nodded vigorously, giving a watery smile. "I will have a lie down," she announced without turning from the board. "Oh, and you, the blonde boy?"
But still he didn't stay.
"We can play Spin the Bottle!" Lavender Brown had gushed when they told the other Gryffindor Sixth years of Fred's 'gift'. "It's this really cool Muggle game, Ronny, you'll love it... Have you chosen your costume yet?"
he thought.
"Look, Malfoy, we can either discuss what I have to say in private in the changing rooms, or we can discuss it loudly here in front of everyone else," Harry snapped, "And if we stay out here, I'm more than happy to lie in order to embarrass you. So it's your decision."
, Draco had written underneath it, in messier writing than his usual style.
A warm rush of contentment rolled softly through Harry.
Harry rolled his eyes sympathetically as Ron was dragged off by Lavender to "discuss outfits", and for a second wondered if he'd ever come off anywhere near that needy to Malfoy.
"Are you going to write on this one?"
," Blaise groaned, pulling the duvet angrily up over his head. "It's so early!"
' on a librarian constitutes a 'violent attack on a member of staff'. She's barely human, for Christ's sake."
Harry sighed. There was no point denying it, he knew Malfoy's hand could feel exactly the effect he was having on him. "You know I do."
And he would, he'd wake up, and he'd follow them yawning down the stairs, and he'd fetch Malfoy again and again and again. Sometimes he'd be lead to the woods or out to the lake, sometimes his job would be to coax the boy away from a fire, or down from the Astronomy Tower. Either way it was enormously draining.
He paused, running a pretty hand through his soft blonde hair and assessing the other boy almost flirtatiously. "It's hilarious that you think my interest in the situation is because it's the only time someone has been attracted to me, by the way."
Hermione had done an expert job of cleaning up the library, of course, and was now casting the counter spell to release the librarian from her silence.
Draco didn't want to hear the words the other boy wanted to say, and he knew Harry didn't want to hear his either. So what was the fucking point?
Clearly the other boy wasn't in on the prank; he was far too easy to read for that. No, Potter's desire was genuine. Draco was sure of it.
"He won't, Harry," she told him gently, her eyes brimming with sympathetic tears. "You have to leave him alone. I can't watch you fall apart over him any more."
"Inexplicable," grinned Pansy.
He didn't want this to spiral into the usual argument and ruin the lovely day, but still, he was annoyed.
There was a glimmer of momentary pity from Nott. "Look, Potter," he sighed. "I don't know what's going on with you and him but why don't you just get yourself to bed, yeah? We've got it from here and I don't think he wants you around."
Harry's head was dangerously close to Malfoy's shoulder, their hips and waists and ribs aligned so perfectly it seemed criminal not to touch, their hands just heartbeats apart - but they didn't touch. Not yet.
He stayed there until long after the others had left for dinner, even Ron, but he was only calmed slightly by the feeling of the hot water soaking over his skin.
Something in his intuition told Draco to head to the Lake to find Harry, so he forced his way down the rain-slicked stone steps, breathing heavily as he did so. It was disorientating to fight through this much water, and certainly the last thing Draco's trembling body craved as he came down from the previous night. He groaned inwardly as he realised he could be looking for Potter all evening.
"I wish I'd never seen that bloody picture," he swore under his breath. His heart was still thudding like it might shut down.
He was slightly concerned that he wouldn't be able to find Draco's bed, but it was clear after a brief surveillance of the room which was his.
"You've got to stop letting him control you, Harry," she said. She was sick of saying it and hoped the frustration didn't leak into her tone. "He's so awful for you, and you just let him walk all over you."
"I'm so fucking mad at you," he wept. He could hear Pansy still sobbing too, and a flurry of general panic around them, but he ignored it all. The only thing he cared about was the half dead boy in his arms, and the feeling of nearly losing him.
"Can you see that?" Harry asked, breathless with wonder and the weight of his joy, and Draco nodded.
He held his hand high above his head and let the lovely crystal glass fall to the ground, soaking red wine up in a scarlet arc amid shards of crystal as it smashed.
Would Hermione be up, he wondered? She sometimes liked to wander to the library early in the morning for a slot before classes, it might be worth going to see her for some comfort.
His friends, well used to this topic by now, had zoned out. But an unkind idea was beginning to form in Pansy's mind.
spell that ended the battle. This proves it was thrown to Mr. Potter."
Malfoy shrugged. "Pansy and Blaise went to shag. I fancied a laugh."
His question was a challenge, and Harry felt his chest tighten. "No, I suppose it didn't," he replied, fighting to keep his voice steady. Malfoy's dark silhouette was poised and elegant at the window, and Harry tore his eyes away from the perfect slope of his back with some difficulty.
The hand rested a couple of inches above the knee for a second, not at all softly, and Harry's senses went wild.
Harry had never felt so emotionally close to another person before, and found himself yearning for more of Draco's attention.
"I get another?" Malfoy asked quietly.
"It didn't mean anything," he said quietly without turning round. "Did it?"
He slid his secret cigarette pack out of his back pocket, and lit one with his wand before putting it into his mouth and inhaling deeply. What he really wanted was some dope, but he had long ago discovered that smoking tumbleweed at work was a bad idea, so cigarettes would have to do.
"A letter?" Hermione repeated doubtfully. "Won't he just use it to mock you?"
"You're genuinely revolting," Malfoy continued, his mouth barely inches from Harry's. "I mean, the idea that you even have the audacity to-"
"And your best friend can't get enough of it," Malfoy shot back. "Now he's finished riding your slaggy little sister, that is-
"Draco," Harry called nervously. "Draco?"
The flames of before had burnt his heart up from the pit of his stomach, but this new fire was slow, gentle, a warm glow which radiated all the way under Harry's skin and soothed his aching soul.
"I like me much better when I'm high," Draco smiled ruefully. "I like you better when I'm high, too."
He'd always loved the thrill of a good fight or a challenge, and Potter's blatant, unashamed enjoyment of every confrontation Draco offered was beginning to be exciting to him too, though he wouldn't admit it to himself. He'd teach Potter to laugh at him, to take pleasure in the conflict between them. He'd find a way to hurt him some time soon.
"He was in the fire first," Pansy whispered, tears dripping from her face to the earth with alarming speed. "He lit his hair on fire and then he leapt in the Lake to cool off. He was so high and out of control."
"How soon could you get it tested, do you think?!" Harry asked, slight anxiety tinging his excitement.
Like Draco, Weasley was among those who found the situation hilarious, while Granger watched on in paralysed horror.
"What the FUCK was that about, Potter?" Malfoy screamed, grabbing Harry by the shoulders and shoving him up against the wall, hard. His face was inches away from Harry's, but it wasn't like last time they were this close. Last time those grey eyes had been soft and happy, not steely and cold.
But he was still distraught.
"Pans? Anything to tell me?" he asked in a lowered voice, and she shook her head. "Coward."
"I understand," Mallory smiled. He lead the way down the corridor to a little room on the left, and no sooner was the door shut before Harry started talking excitedly.
"If you're sure, Potter," Blaise had shrugged. "We'll do our best to keep him away from you."
"Is that really what I look like?" he asked.
"Hey, look at me," Draco said gently, tilting Harry's chin up with two fingers to force Harry's eyes back on his. "It's okay, I promise."
"But since that fucking Fat Woman or whatever her stupid name is wouldn't let me in, I have to do it now. So, um," Malfoy took a deep breath. "I'm sorry."
Malfoy and his friends had forced their way through the crowd for "front-row seats" as the blonde put it, and Harry was not disappointing them.
"Apparently you didn't attend the Quidditch match last week," he continued. "Did you get kicked out of the stands for public indecency? Or just not fancy being shown by Chang how to fly without having a nervous breakdown over the opposition Seeker?"
"You know why not, you evil son of a bitch. Why the fuck would you do that to me?!"
"What did the git watch my name on?!" Draco demanded, striding quickly to keep up with the group.
"Look at the state of you, Weasel," Malfoy looked up at the newcomer, delighted. "Got your panties in a twist because Potter fancies me? Are you jealous? Oh, this is
"Don't you see what I'm capable of?" he yelled, and Harry knew the question was aimed at him even if Malfoy's gaze wasn't. "Do you think you can ignore me now? This is my latest artwork, it's the best I've ever done!"
Neville blushed, but raised his chin bravely to meet Harry's irritable green eyes. "Well, better than to fancy Malfoy. I know he's attractive, but I thought you were smart enough to see past that."
"Be a good boy, Draco," his mother had whispered, while his father held up a clear bottle half filled with pearly looking liquid. They were stood at the end of his bed at the expensive rehab centre where he'd been for several days now, a place he'd already grown to hate.
"Write?!" Malfoy's eyes were wide with indignation and surprise. "What the hell was I meant to write?"
Dior Sauvage.
The metre between them felt like miles; no matter how hard he tried, the space between them warped Draco's intentions and made them ugly.
This happened to be the seat on the end of the table next to Draco Malfoy, who made no effort to accommodate Harry when he sat down, meaning he was rather cramped in an effort not to make contact.
"I do, yes," Mallory nodded. He reached for a pen from his blazer pocket and twiddled it thoughtfully between his fingers; a reflex action. "What, precisely, would we be testing it for?"
Ron grimaced. "What do you mean, do I really want to know?"
"Will I -" Harry's voice cracked, this was the hardest question. "Will I see you again?"
"You didn't!" Ron roared, slamming into the other boy harder than either of them had expected, and grabbing him aggressively by the tie. "That's my LITTLE SISTER, you creep! And she's barely just got over Harry!"
His friends frowned, confused. "What's it, Harry?" Ron asked.
"You are excluded for destructive behaviour, the violent attack of a member of staff, and possession of classified drugs. Do you have any questions, Mr. Malfoy?"
"You are actually chronically horny," he hissed, and Malfoy sniggered.
He pushed Malfoy gently down onto the bed and crouched before him, ignoring the whispered comments about what Draco might like to happen next from this position. He rolled up the boy's sodden trouser legs, cast a quiet
for me, not regret."
Harry got the sudden feeling that Malfoy was about to hurt him, and tensed for impact of whatever it was as the other boy approached.
Harry's favourite memory above all others was always the Halloween kiss, when those fangs left tender red grooves in Harry's lips for hours and the whiskey lay hot on Draco's tongue as he'd swiped it painfully over the cuts he was inflicting, a conscious effort to force the stinging alcohol into the lesions.
His pace quickened as he neared the basement, and he hoped that he'd been right, and none of Draco's dorm-mates would have stayed over the vac. Slytherins didn't usually tend to; they often had lavish Pureblood stately homes to return to, and servants awaiting their every breath - but you could of course never be certain of privacy in a communal space.
He supposed it was, but something was missing. It felt like he'd had his power stripped from him, like he was vulnerable in some way he couldn't quite put his finger on.
That night, Harry had his first dream about Malfoy since the incident.
"He tried to kiss me again, the pervert," lied Draco in an airy tone, "And when I pushed him away he shoved me back, and I guess that's how I tripped. I don't really remember it."
The card was small and expensively thick, with silver embossed swirls on the corners and a little green Slytherin wax seal on the opening. Harry pealed it off gently, careful not to rip the paper or damage the pretty wax.
"Fucking hell, you're beautiful," he muttered, shaking his head. "And I think you know why I did it. It's the same reason I always call for you in the night when I get too high. The same reason all my sketches are of you."
Harry knew those colours and that feeling, because that's what ecstasy had done to him when he took it at the Slytherin Midwinter party.
Draco shifted uncomfortably in his seat and Harry had to physically stop himself from putting a gentle hand on his knee. He couldn't imagine how stressful it was for the other boy to have his reputation debated in such a way, his Malfoy pride torn apart in front of an audience.
"This is a date?" Harry asked, eyes lighting up.
he thought
"Believe me, she did all the work-" Draco began, but Ron slammed him hard against the wall again and cut the sentence off.
Draco woke first, and then Harry opened his eyes half an hour later to see the other boy hunched at the end of his bed.
"It's undeniable," Hermione nodded. "Very incriminating."
"Oohhhkay, that's enough from you!" Ron interrupted over a torrent of hysterical laughter from every student within earshot.
"Last time, you were so wet that I could see your naked body," Draco informed him calmly. "And your hair was supposed to be messed up because I did it like that. Today is different because we are going out in public and we need to look respectable. I'll meet you here in ten minutes. If you are late, expect to be the one paying, and remember that I have very expensive taste."
“That’s not what I’m concerned about Ron, it’s more the exact bloke…” Harry trailed off, giving them a few seconds before once again Hermione gasped loudly, looking at Harry with wide eyes as the brunette blushed and looked at the ground, not being brave enough to make eye contact with her.
“The potion hasn’t worn off yet.” He said slowly and realisation dawned on Draco’s face along with a slight blush. Harry stood straight to turn and walk away but Draco caught his sleeve, mouthing a simple ‘Thankyou’ before letting Harry go, he nodded and smiled slightly at the blonde before returning to his seat, the entire hall in silence after having watched the encounter.
“Draco?” Draco groaned in annoyance and pulled away from Harry’s mouth, earning a deep growl from Harry himself, infuriated that somebody had interrupted them.
“W-Well, I- urm, I guess you’re kinda smart and your hair looks okay sometimes, although I hate when you gel it back, it looks much better normally, you should listen to Pansy when she tells you stop styling it, it really does look way more attractive when it’s natural and soft and fluffy. Or I imagine it’d be fluffy, I’ve never felt your hair, it looks insanely soft and fun to play with though.” Harry got lost in his own train of thought, not quite even realising that he was speaking out loud or that Draco could hear him, not until Draco began moving one of Harry’s hands which he was still holding onto up to his head and placed it on top of his hair.
“Christ, Potter! I only meant I wanted a kiss but fuck you’ve got a dirty mind.” Harry stopped moving at the words and his eyes went wide but Draco was quick to respond and pushed Harry’s head forward again, making him go back to the task at hand.
“Thanks for that.” Draco chuckled and Harry nodded, biting his lip softly.
Harry walked through the corridors, not really knowing where he was going or having any destination in mind, just walking. He was avoiding Ron mainly, because of what happened in potions but everyone in the common room was also asking what it was about so he decided to just leave altogether, he knew nobody would bother to follow him, all being too lazy to even stand up to get their own snacks. Maybe Harry should get some snacks while he’s out and about. Maybe later.
Harry grabbed Blaise by the shirt, punching him in the face (earning many gasps from around the great hall) before leaning in close and whispering something nobody else could hear but Draco vaguely heard the hiss of Harry’s voice, he’d never heard the boy that angry before, the malice in his tone was downright scary and that was evident by the terrified look on Zabini’s face and urgent nod of his head. Harry then took a step over to Draco, leaving Blaise holding his now bloody nose with a napkin. Harry leant into Draco’s ear,
“Look at him, stupid teacher’s pet. The only reason he passes is cos Snape is his bloody godfather, I bet he’s thick as Hermione’s book collection really.” Ron continued, still staring daggers into the back of Malfoy’s head, hoping that somehow an actual dagger would appear there. Harry sighed deeply, sounding frustrated as he glared at Ron who was too fixated on Draco’s skull to notice. The brunette put his quill down, probably more violently than necessary, crossing his arms and resisting the urge to give Ron a quick whack round the head.
“Well? Who is she?!” He exclaimed, sitting up like a giddy toddler getting sweets. The rest of the group now just looked intrigued, nodding as indication that they also wanted an answer. Harry just blushed further, rubbing the back of his neck and raising his shoulders higher.
“Well, Potter, while the thought of doing those things is rather tempting, I’d prefer to hear more about how I’m one of the most intelligent people in our year, and of course I’d love for you to continue your rant about how perfect my hair is, I find that topic far more interesting.” Draco said smugly as Harry went a bright red, blush spreading across his cheeks all the way up to his ears and down to his neck. He immediately began stuttering and mumbling about being clueless but eventually gave up when Draco just stared at him as if to say, ‘I know that everything you’re saying is bullshit, Potter’.
“Y-Yeah, fine thanks, think I’m gonna just g-go for a walk.” He quickly stood up before he was too hard to do so without people noticing. He darted out of the room, ignoring Hermione’s ‘but it’s after curfew!’ argument. He slammed the door behind him and leant against it, breathing deeply. He stopped for a second to try and rationalise. The potion must not have worn off yet, buy why? And suddenly Harry’s mind clicked the pieces into place, and he remembered throwing something in, thinking it was fine because the colour didn’t change. Whatever he threw in must have affected how long the potion lasts.
The Slytherin pushed himself off the wall, taking a deep breath as his heart rate began returning to normal. He offered a hand to Harry, hauling him up onto his feet before tucking himself back into his trousers and buckling his belt. He straightened his clothes before finally looking up at Harry who was staring at him, he looked like he was waiting for approval or something, like a lost child. Draco looked back into his eyes, completely serious as he studied the emerald orbs for a few seconds before pulling Harry towards him and smashing their lips together in a passionate kiss. Harry kissed back, holding Draco’s face in his hands and pressing their bodies together. They pulled away, breathing heavily again and gazing into each other’s eyes in a trance of pure love and admiration.
“Shit, Potter, slow down, I’m going to cum!” Draco almost yelled, trying desperately to keep his voice down as they were still in a public, although commonly unknown about, space where anybody could wander past. Harry ignored Draco’s request, actually speeding up instead and applying more pressure to his tongue movements, wanting to taste more of the small amounts of cum he’d managed to get so far, he wanted to taste all of Draco, make him feel good and be able to say that he was the cause of Draco’s best orgasm ever, or just any orgasm would do honestly, but he was determined.
“You alright, mate?” Ron asked, noticing Harry’s disturbed expression. Harry just nodded and continued walking, trying to ignore the feeling as they arrived at their next class.
“Uh sorry” He said, it should’ve been a statement, but it came out more like a question. Draco looked at him, pupils dilating further, and Harry looked almost scared for a second, trying to anticipate what the blonde would do, although he never would’ve guessed. Draco grabbed Harry by the front of his shirt pulling him forward and pushing him against the door frame, before Harry had time to react, Draco’s mouth was on his, hot and soft as his tongue entered Harry’s mouth, exploring. Draco tried his best to remain dominant, but Harry won anyway, spinning them round so Draco was now pressed against the hardwood. Harry kissed him roughly, the blonde moaning into his mouth as Harry’s leg worked its way between Draco’s, his thigh rubbing against the blonde’s clothed cock, still hard from before. Draco managed to pull back enough to speak, whispering into the small gap between them,
“So, uh… how long before it starts working?” Harry asked nervously once he’d swallowed. Snape pulled a face before grabbing the nearest book that wasn’t a hardback and whacking Harry round the head. Miraculously, just as Harry yelped in pain, so did Draco. Both boys looked at each other in shock, dumbfounded expressions plastered on their faces before Malfoy once again smiled slightly, looking proud of himself. Snape rolled his eyes, beginning to walk away from them to go over to Hermione and Ron who had also managed to finish by some miracle. He waved a hand over his shoulder and casually called back that it would wear off in an hour. Harry sighed, that wasn’t too bad, he could cope with that, as long as Malfoy didn’t plan on getting hexed or in a fist fight within that hour.
Harry watched as Snape paced back and forth in silence, up and down the desks, peering over into students’ cauldrons. Harry sighed, glancing over to where Ron and Hermione were laughing and talking as they brewed their potion, having a great time with the experiment. As if on cue, harry heard the familiar sneer of his name.
“What on earth are you doing?” Draco asked, but there was no venom to it, just genuine confusion and curiosity. Without a word, Harry looked at Draco through his eyelashes, a look of hunger and want. Draco almost stumbled back; Harry looked extremely attractive like that. Harry raised Draco’s hand to his lips and kissed it, Draco was completely speechless, he wanted to pull his hand away and demand to know what Harry was doing but he just couldn’t bring himself to do it. He was mesmerised by Harry and the way he held his hand and his lips on his knuckles and oh shit that’s his tongue. Draco gasped as Harry ran his tongue across Draco’s palm, tasting the saltiness of sweat and precum. Finally, Draco took his hand back, but before he could say a word, Harry leant in close, breath ghosting over the Slytherin’s ear before he nibbled it softly, whispering,
“Well I’m not going to stand here all day, Potter.” Harry was surprised that Draco was even still here, usually if he didn’t get a reaction he’d just give up and move on to the next poor student to cross his path. Harry risked a peak over his knees at Draco, waiting for the pain of whatever attack Draco decided on but nothing came and when his eyes adjusted to the light again, he saw that Draco was actually standing above him with his hand outstretched to Harry, offered. Harry looked at it confused, like it was a foreign object that he’d never seen before, as though he didn’t own two himself. The blonde rolled his eyes and sighed sharply.
“Sorry, I’ll go I just-…” Harry was cut off as he turned around and found himself pressed chest to chest against Draco who was looking down at him, surprised with a light blush dusting his cheeks. Harry flushed before speeding away to get what they needed for the potion. Malfoy straightened out his robes before sitting back down and getting back to work.
“You know, Malfoy. You don’t actually have to shout my name every time you need something, you could just say it. Or ask politely.” Harry mumbled the last sentence, knowing it was a faraway fantasy. The brunette gazed off to the front of the room again, reading over the instructions for a ‘shared touch’ potion that Snape had written up on the blackboard. His daydream was interrupted as he heard Draco sigh, and Harry waited for him to shout ‘Potter!’ once again. But instead, Malfoy simply said,
“You wanna come in? We’re kinda still in the corridor.” Harry chuckled darkly, smirking before pulling Draco in, letting the blonde close the door behind them as he dragged him to the couch, still kissing him harshly, loving the feeling of Draco on his lips but needing more. Harry laid back on the couch, allowing Draco to climb on top of him, which he did. Luckily the Slytherins weren’t as social as the Gryffindors and had all already retired to their individual dorms. Draco straddled Harry’s waist, their erections pressed against each other through multiple layers of extremely inconvenient clothes. Draco grinded down into Harry, causing them both to moan. Draco was rapidly undoing the buttons on Harry’s shirt to finally reveal tanned, toned chest and abs. He was much more muscular than what Draco had expected but then again he himself wasn’t as skinny as most people thought him to be. Clearly Harry was one of those people as when Draco’s shirt came off, Harry’s hands went to his biceps, gripping tightly as he thrusted up into Draco at the same time he thrusted down. Harry groaned, removing his hands from the blonde’s arms to wrap one around the back of his neck and the other on his cheek as he pulled Draco down into another bruising kiss, moaning into it as the blonde’s hips never ceased. Harry could feel himself getting closer and so was Draco, evident by his moans and high-pitched whines, he was clearly a bottom, Harry thought smugly. Draco moaned loudly and it pushed Harry infinitely closer to cumming because Draco’s moans were possibly the most beautiful and arousing sounds Harry had ever heard, but just then, there was a voice, quiet but getting louder by the second, followed by footsteps.
“Potter! Pay attention, I need the eye of newt.” Harry turned to his own partner and glared, handing the blonde a jar containing the necessary ingredient.
Later on, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Seamus and Dean were all in the Gryffindor common room. They’d had what they call a ‘family game night’ but were now just sat around talking after they’d all had individual tantrums over a game of ‘Wizarding Monopoly’. All except Hermione of course as she didn’t throw tantrums, she merely sulked with her arms crossed and a pout on her lips after expressing very enthusiastically how much she hated the game and everyone playing it. By now they’d all calmed down and were lazing around on the furniture and floor around the fire.
“He’s just so annoying, walking round like he’s all perfect with his gross mess that he calls hair and daddy’s expensive robes.” Harry slammed his hand down on the desk, causing a few students to turn to him, including Ron who looked slightly concerned for his friend who looked as if he had a broom shoved up his arse.
“What is it? C’mon mate, we won’t judge, you can tell us who she is.” Harry cringed at the word ‘she’ and Hermione smacked him, hissing a not-so-muted ‘shut up Ronald’ before turning back to Harry and smiling sweetly with a face of pure acceptance, telling Harry it was okay and that she would personally destroy anybody who said otherwise. Harry smiled back at her as she spoke.
He hissed through his teeth, Malfoy’s amazingly skilled hand still on him as he began speed walking down the corridor. He was fully hard now and kept his hand over his mouth to stop himself moaning. It was only when he reached the Slytherin dorm room corridor that he broke. He slumped down against the wall, not being able to quite stand as the heavenly feeling of Draco’s hand got faster and Harry moaned aloud, clapping a hand over his mouth immediately afterwards, muffling the sounds still escaping his lips. He took a deep breath as the hand slowed for a few seconds and he pushed himself up from the wall, walking as fast as he could down to the Slytherin door. He banged loudly on it and his theory was solidified by the fact that the hand immediately left him. A few seconds later, the door opened and sure enough, Malfoy stood there shirtless, peeking around the door, using it as a shield to cover what Harry knew to be a presumably huge erection and probably nothing but boxers. The blonde opened his mouth to speak but stopped in his tracks when he saw Harry’s appearance.
From a distance at least none of the serpents seemed angry as they swarmed around the blonde, and that was a relief to Harry. He needed the Slytherins on side at a time like this, and he knew they'd turn against him if they knew he'd just taken Malfoy to bed.
"In Mr. Malfoy's blood sample we found about 750 milligrams of MDMA," said Dr. Wolfung, and Harry's heart soared with joy. He'd never been so happy to hear that Draco was out of his mind before.
Every time that line would crush Harry like a stone, but he always submitted.
"You're a sadistic shit, Draco Malfoy. What did you even gain from that?"
Malfoy was still Malfoy, and this wasn't exactly his first time, even if it was Harry's. It wouldn't hold the same sentimental value for him - Harry wondered if he was even on his mind more than once or twice a day, if at all. It was hard to pretend that nothing had happened though, and it hurt Harry's feelings more than usual to be tormented and bullied by the other boy.
He had somehow Transfigured his teeth into oddly alluring pearly fangs, from which two streams of lurid fake blood dripped down his chin. In his left hand he held a delicately cut crystal goblet which was half filled with dark red wine (evidently to complete the vampire look), and there were dramatic dark circles under his eyes.
"Anything!"
Harry grinned as Malfoy collapsed on his chest with a drawn-out groan.
"This is unbelievable," Pansy giggled as they walked. "Not even a week since we pulled that prank, and already I've heard Potter's getting kicked off the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Weaselby's punched Draco in the face, and apparently Potter was even crying in the showers for two hours this evening, that's why he was so late to dinner."
Harry's heart thudded in his ears. It was about him, he recognised that at once.
"Gryffindors are the fucking weirdest creatures on earth," he whispered, mesmerised.
Draco scanned the page again with flickering grey eyes, unable to take in what was written there.
"Thanks for keeping us involved, Harry!" Hermione called back irritably. "Glad I could help!"
Harry's own eyes became glassy with tears as he got to his feet to speak out with his classmates. "I saw him throw it," he said. "And I caught it."
And then the fact that he'd swanned down to breakfast the next morning as though nothing had happened - Draco had to admit he sort of admired Potter for that audacity. What he wouldn't admit, however, was that he also found it weirdly hot.
"Great, now Mudbloods are keeping secrets from me too," Draco spat, not caring if she heard him or not. "First my friends, now this. It's pathetic."
"So!" Harry racked his brain for a way to explain it to the colossal idiot at his side. "So, they don't want to hear you saying vulgar things like that, nor do they want to hear about me with my clothes off! I'm keeping them on, okay? And you're keeping yours on too. Though maybe I should take a look at those knees..."
"Harry, what the fuck?!!!" Ginny shrieked, and he screamed back in shock, his head whipping up to see her standing over him. He was instantly awake, and just as horrified as she was as he finished.
"Hurts," Harry pouted. "Kiss it better for me?"
Ecstasy.
As he walked the empty halls towards the Gryffindor tower, Harry was glad he'd dipped from the Slytherin dorms before Draco woke up. Because if Harry felt shit, Draco always insisted on feeling fifty times worse, and had no problems taking it out on Harry as a punching bag. Things could be different after the intense romantic quality of the night before, but that sort of thing wasn't worth the risk where Malfoy was concerned.
"I haven't done anything!" Malfoy protested. "I really don't know where the stupid bastard is any better than you do."
Harry was extremely grateful for the spot he'd chosen for their date-that-wasn't-a-date that afternoon. A solid line of trees arched around the two of them in a crescent, protecting them from the view of the castle, though there was still the illicit thrill that if anyone was on the Lake, they'd be seen quite quickly.
He couldn't believe this was the same boy who liked to bite him to watch him flinch, who'd drawn actual blood from Harry countless times, who was now moving his tongue so sweetly between their mouths, running his hands so peacefully over Harry's waist to pull him in.
After a frozen moment of consideration, Draco arched his muse gently back over the pictures of himself, hovering above his face for a second to drink him in:
his brain added belligerently
"I really mean it, Zabini," he insisted the morning after he last fought with Draco. The words were barbed in his throat. "Don't try and involve me again. I've had enough of him and his awful pain."
"Can you grab me a Viagra from the drawer by my bed?" he asked thoughtfully, and Harry shot him an outraged glare in the dark, punctuated by a hard pinch on the thigh. All fondness dissipated instantly.
"I think you've done enough, Parkinson, you fucking traitor," he hissed menacingly. "You let me believe this for so long - how could you do this to me?"
It was 4 in the morning when the pounding on the door began.
Those words stung Harry for a long time.
He thought about the request. "Why do you ask?"
Harry pressed his burning forehead to the cool wall of the dungeon while he waited for Ron and Hermione to appear, too shaken to go much further without them. What the fuck was going on?
"It's my special day," Harry pouted, and with that Malfoy gave in, leaned over, and kissed him hard.
"It's probably highly toxic," Ron said cheerfully as the three of them stowed the small keg behind the Common Room curtains. "But it'll do the trick and get you drunk!"
The fish and chips arrived soon after, and they were hot and salty and delicious, and Harry began to wolf it down.
"Potter's here, Draco," Parkinson called, and the blonde's eyes visibly lit up from across the water.
The first thing that happened after their long meeting with Dumbledore was that, while Hermione, Theo and Blaise were let off the hook, Harry and Draco were given detention for the rest of the term.
And with that, he turned and left Draco sat completely alone in the Hall, his head pressed into his hands.
The images of the dream flashed hauntingly over his eyelids; Malfoy, blood dripping from his nose, standing over Harry and laughing.
Malfoy leaned down and fastened his hand hard and tight around Harry's tie. "I said watch your tone, Half-Blood, and remember your place," he hissed. "There are plenty of other people who would love to clean me up, make an angel of me. You should feel privileged."
"And what have you to say on the matter of Mr. Malfoy's charges, Mr. Potter?"
Malfoy looked away, staring intently at the kaleidoscope of colours. "I have something to tell you about that, actually," he said gruffly. "If we're doing gifts... you might as well see my sketchbook from over Christmas."
,", hadn't he said that to Harry just minutes ago?
Malfoy considered the offer for a moment, frowning. He felt like he'd been rather pushed into this, but Potter was right - they were both behind on their studies. It was a beautiful day, he didn't have other plans, and he liked the idea of having it "made worth his while".
Draco sighed.
"Ginny, I wasn't!" Harry protested. His cheeks flamed. They weren't even alone in the Common Room, he hated her for making a scene. "I just came to see you this evening because I like you-"
"Thank you, Dr. Wolfung," the Judge nodded as the researcher stepped back down from the stand. "Would the defence like to summarise this piece of evidence?"
Harry bit his lip hard.
Ginny nodded.
It was a rather unnerving thought and Harry shrugged it off quickly, but the fact that it had even occurred to him spoke volumes. He supposed there was just no way for him to tell what level of sadism Malfoy would go to for his own malicious pleasure, but he'd be better off putting a stop to it fast before he got seriously hurt.
"We're not?" Malfoy repeated, a confused frown scribbling over his forehead. "Think you're too good for me now, is that it?"
Draco sat up, ran his hands over his legs in Potter's red sheets, and yawned. It hadn't even been a question the night before as to whether they were sleeping together, it just seemed the most natural thing to do.
Harry's eyes lit up. "There's a next time?"
How could they, when they would never see Malfoy so hot and messed up above them as Harry had had him, his beautiful aristocratic features contorted with heavenly exhilaration as his body made Harry see paradise, or the way he looked just as he was getting high, the way it softened those features and made them velvet again instead of ice?
"And he doesn't have enough of that," Harry realised slowly, a sinking feeling growing in his stomach.
"Stop, I- stop, please," Harry panted as Malfoy's hands slipped into his waistband, hard and persistent. At Harry's words he withdrew them with a frustrated growl, pushing away from him entirely to run his hands through his already messed-up hair.
Draco smirked approvingly as Harry drank.
"I said, shut the fuck up!" Draco exploded, swiftly overpowering the other boy and slamming him against the lockers, chest to chest, each panting heavily against the other's mouth.
"He's very impulsive!" Hermione insisted. "And he was drunk, too, and very upset! I mean, did you see his face?!"
He tried valiantly not to look across the hall to the place at the Gryffindor table where he knew Potter was sat with his mates, and failed. He looked kinda good today. Shut up, Draco.
"Because, after everything we've been through, after every chance to redeem yourself," Harry's chest heaved painfully, "You are still nothing but a vicious, spiteful bully who gets high off other people's feelings. But you can't use mine any more."

"I'm trying," Harry muttered, embarrassed. "It isn't exactly all my shit, is it?"
Harry grinned. "Apology accepted, you stupid twat. At least it will be, on one condition."
Draco’s eyes flicked down to Harry’s lips, as they had earlier that morning, and Harry felt that familiar twinge of lust that, if left unchecked, would easily take over all of his willpower and make him a slave to his physical desires. He blinked hard, suddenly remembering an idea.
He stopped in the middle of the street, watching through the window for a couple moments, observing Potter, admiring the way he studied the Quidditch book in his hands, the way his eyes roved across the page, his brow furrowing slightly in concentration. Part of Draco wondered if there was any way he could wander inside without making it too obvious that he had found Potter here. He could casually pick something up off the shelf as well, pretending not to notice Potter, and then could pretend to be shocked that they were in the same store together. He wasn't sure what he would say - maybe he could make a crude joke about Potter always looking for a new broom to ride, maybe he could suggest that they grab a drink in the Leaky Cauldron together, and then they could just see what followed afterwards.
"I'm so sorry," she said, referring to the child who was continuing to sob on her shoulder. "It's been a little rough - my husband was killed in the battle in May."
“God, you feel good,” Harry whispered, squeezing Draco’s hands and grinding his hips against Draco’s own. Draco hadn’t noticed he had a full-on erection until this moment; he had been too wrapped up in kissing Harry’s mouth for it to register. He barely stifled an involuntary groan at the feel of Harry’s own tight jeans against his.
“When did you know?” Harry asked. “That you were gay?”
“I know.” Draco looked uncomfortable, as though he didn’t know how to respond to this statement.
Draco’s eyes brightened, a smile now playing on his lips.
“I’ll race you there,” Draco grinned, hoping for the best -- if they got there fast, they could pick up right where they had just left off.
“Right,” Harry said, feeling the blush rising back into his cheeks. He wasn’t even going to pretend that he understood the inter-student relationships within the Slytherin dormitories, or that he had the faintest frame of reference of what “experimenting” would have looked like with his Gryffindor classmates. It was a completely separate world from his own. He wondered how much different his life might have been if he had been sorted into Slytherin as well, if he might have been the one that Malfoy experimented with instead of Zabini.
“Potter,” Draco said, stopping in his tracks and pulling his hand back, looking around to make sure there weren’t any people watching them in the street. “It’s not that I don’t want to, I just don’t really fancy getting beat to a pulp in a muggle bar tonight.”
He couldn't take it anymore. He closed his eyes, shoving his hands into the pockets of his slacks and continuing to walk down the street. He focused on the furthest building in his line of sight and pressed on, disregarding the witches and wizards he passed on the cobbled road, not even flinching when a photographer captured his picture with a bright flash when he had almost reached the Leaky Cauldron. He didn't stop until he had reached his room, and had pressed his back against the closed wooden door. It was as if all of the pain he was feeling had led to this moment; he slid down to the floor, beginning to sob uncontrollably. He was struggling for breath, keeping his eyes squeezed shut tightly so he couldn't see the Laethelixir stacked in piles around the room.
“How far back to your place?” he asked above the noise of the torrential downfall cascading around them.
“Y-Yes,” Draco could barely spit out, the pressure in his balls almost unbearable. “Fuck, Harry.”
He was so, so happy. And so, goddamned tired. He didn’t care that they were covered in spunk and their wands were in the hallway with the rest of their clothes. He just wanted to hold Harry against his chest like that for the rest of his life, and maybe the next life as well.
Harry’s heart sank. He knew that things had been hellish enough in the Malfoy house with all of the death eaters and Voldemort supporters hanging around his father, but he didn’t know that physical violence had been a part of Draco’s childhood as well. The Dursleys had been terrible to him, but the most they had been guilty of was emotional abuse. Harry was starting to see a new, vulnerable side of Draco which was explaining many of his actions when they were younger.
Draco glanced sideways at Harry, as if gauging whether or not he wanted to dive further into this subject. It was growing colder outside by the minute, the wind starting to whip at their faces up on the rooftop, pulling patches of red blush up to the hollows of Draco’s cheeks.
The two shared a look, their fingers brushing as Draco passed the bottle back to Harry.
“Yeah,” Draco nodded. He was still feeling the heightened buzz from all the alcohol they had consumed at the bar. That and heartburn, that was. “Yeah, I’ll tell you.”
“No,” Harry said, interrupting him. “It’s not, I just… had no idea.” He leaned back on the rooftop so that his elbows were supporting his weight.
“He saw us.” Draco said, swallowing hard. “Harry, we have to run.”
He looked from her face to the crying child and back again, still visibly uncomfortable. What if his actions seriously injured one of the innocent and fatherless children in her home?
After a few moments of teasing, coaxing Harry’s hole until he was writhing on the couch in anticipation, Draco began to stroke his own cock, coating it in the tingling, warm lubricant that was left on his fingers. Harry watched him do it, a look of unparalleled, existential pleasure upon his face. Draco lowered his body back over Harry’s face so he could kiss him once more as he lined himself up with Harry’s entrance.
“You found my spot,” he said, speaking to Draco as the other man stared straight ahead, watching the cars roll through the crowded London streets. He looked as though he might have been crying, although it was often hard to differentiate sadness from general weariness when it came to interpreting Malfoy’s emotions. “You scared the living hell out of me first, mind you.”
He brought his tongue back down to Harry’s neck, revelling in the taste of his skin, and pausing to lap at the hollow of his collar bone.
The second Harry’s mouth wrapped itself around his cock, Draco was certain he’d never felt anything better in his whole life. Harry was so delectably warm and wet, the pressure of his tongue upon Draco’s member was exactly right, and Draco found himself instinctively pulling at the roots of Harry’s messy, black hair to bring him in closer.
Harry’s face was only inches away from Draco’s. He was still for a moment, and then Draco could see his eyes flick up to Draco’s own through the dim light of the distant lamps.
“You’re on, Malfoy.”
“So you just… shagged each other, and that was it?” Harry asked. “You didn’t go out or anything?”
“If they tortured him,” Draco continued, “And he saw us together, they might come after you next.”
“So you’ll do it?” Harry asked, intertwining his fingers with Draco’s once more. Draco couldn’t remember feeling this intimate with someone in recent history, their naked bodies casually pressed against each other on the sofa, Harry’s thumb rubbing circles against the outside of Draco’s hand.
“Fuck, that’s amazing,” Draco muttered, staring down at Harry’s beautiful, freckled face, which was nestled right up against the blonde curls at the base of his cock. Harry brought his watery eyes up to Draco’s. He was so good, so eager to please, and Draco pulled his head back, slipping himself out of Harry’s mouth.
He had gone into Knockturn Alley to procure some dittany and heal his splinched shoulder. Just as he had anticipated, the shopkeeper had approached him once more to ask him if he would be interested in selling any Laethelixir, the bright blue liquid vial that he had been offered last time he was in the shop. Draco had refused, sure that he would be able to afford his expenses as soon as the ministry had sorted through all of his father's possessions in the manor, and added as much time on to his sentence as they saw fit. The weeks came and passed, however, and he was only sliding deeper into debt and growing more and more desperate. He visited his mother every day, still managing to put on a smile and tell her whatever lies he happened to come up with (Potter was working with his contacts at the ministry to get Lucius another hearing, Draco had reconnected with a lovely, pureblood witch who was going back for her last year of Hogwarts in the fall), and then he locked himself in his room in the Leaky Cauldron and tried to not think about the fact that his mother was going to die, and that he was going to follow her to the grave much sooner than expected if he couldn't turn this around somehow.
“You’re going to fucking kill me, Potter,” he whispered back, releasing Harry’s hands so that he could trail his own down Harry’s body, feeling every divet, every muscle on his chest. He kissed Harry’s open mouth again, but this time nearly jumped out of his skin as the two heard a loud, cracking noise overhead.
“You don’t fancy a drink somewhere, do you?” He asked. Draco looked a little disoriented, obviously surprised that Harry wasn’t leaning into his kiss like he clearly expected he would.
“I don’t know what to do.” Draco said quietly, holding the firewhiskey bottle between his knees and taking a deep breath.
“We don’t know that for certain.”
"If you don't," she continued, pulling her hair back away from the child's iron grip once more. "I'll just get it from someone else."
“I think I always knew,” Draco said. “Well, I always knew I wasn’t interested in girls, at least.” He took a deep breath. “I tried to deny it for the longest time, but Blaise and I started messing around fourth year, and I think everything sort of clicked into place then.”
“Sorry,” Draco said. Clearly he had just blurted out something that had been on his mind. He took a deep breath. “It just hasn’t sunk in yet, that it’s not just me. That I wasn’t making it up in my head.”
“Sort of, I guess. I went there at the beginning of the summer,” Harry said. “After you had come by my place, when I was mostly just trying to figure out whether or not I fancied blokes. My godfather used to go there all the time, he had written some letters about it.”
He smiled at Malfoy under the changing, colored lights, and remarked upon the way the blue light transformed Draco into an ethereal-looking frost prince. Draco seemed to have noticed Harry was staring, and threw his head back laughing.
“Basically, yes. Blaise had a girlfriend 5th year, so he didn’t want anyone finding out. Besides,” he continued, taking another swig of the whiskey. “It’s really stigmatized, especially in pureblood families. My father found us over break that year and beat the living shit out of me.”
“I wasn’t trying to do it,” Draco said, as they began walking towards the bar. “I didn’t think it was going to mess me up like it did. Besides,” he added, with a smirk in Harry’s direction. “That’s what I have you for now. You know… The fussing over me constantly part. Not the limb blasting,” he said, as though this was an important clarification that needed to be made. “Where is it we’re going, anyways?”
"Are you the distributor?" The woman asked, pulling her hair out of the child's tight grasp, and causing him to cry louder.
His fantasy was derailed only a moment after it had begun when a familiar, redheaded witch appeared around the corner of the aisle, holding a broom servicing kit and pointing out something to Harry on the box. He laughed, tossing his head back and placing the book in his hands back onto the shelf. She looked pleased with herself for eliciting such a reaction from him.
Harry looked up at him with his beautiful, green eyes, and pressed Draco’s cock against his lips as he responded.
“So everyone here…” Draco trailed off, his voice getting lost in the sound of the music from the dance floor.
The smirk on Draco’s face made him look like his old, teenage self. It was reassuring to see that he was slipping back into his old persona, that the events of the last 24 hours hadn’t completely wiped out all of his infuriating tendencies that were now as equally charming as they were irritating.
“Come dance with me,” Harry mumbled into Draco’s mouth.
Harry glanced sideways at him again, trying to discern Draco’s mood. The tightened jaw, the uncharacteristically ruffled hair, the way his arms rested on his knees and the curve of his usually rigidly straight posture. He couldn’t help but think how attractive Draco looked in the woolen knit sweater he had borrowed, how the dark brown and red patterns were so much warmer than the colors he usually wore.
‘Anyways, he saw all of my work and he offered me a job, and a desk and access to his own library, which had five times the amount of medical textbooks that were on the shelves downstairs. I don’t know if you knew this, but the institute used to be the headquarters for the International Magical Medical Practice, which also doubled as the infirmary that’s now located at St. Mungo’s before the whole practice moved to America. His office used to be the Dean’s, so his entire personal collection stayed with the building.”
“She’s in St. Mungos, not Azkaban…” Harry cut in.
“Don’t,” Draco said, his voice suddenly very serious. “Don’t go over there. We need to leave, now.” Harry looked at him and was startled to find that Draco had paled and lost every inch of the animated spirit he had possessed only moments ago.
They hastened past the couples who they had seen up on the balcony only a half hour earlier, Draco checking every couple moments to make sure that Harry was right behind him. Thankfully Harry had trusted Draco enough to take his word for the fact that they needed to leave, and had followed without another word of explanation. Draco pushed open the heavy metal door with the illuminated “Exit” sign, and they were out in the London streets once more.
He stayed at the foot of the bed, his hand stroking hers gently for what felt like an hour, until a healer opened the door and mentioned that they would be wrapping up visiting hours shortly. He nodded in response, wiping another tear away from his cheek before wishing his mother goodbye, planting the usual kiss on her forehead as he left.
“If we go by your plan, if we do everything by the book and I give the ministry the names they want, I… I’ll never see my mother again. It would be too much of a risk; Everyone would know to look for me at St. Mungos.”
September, 1998
“Oh.”
“Let’s go dance,” Draco said finally, smiling again and slipping his long, pale fingers into Harry’s hand so they could walk together over to the dance floor.
The sun was almost setting on the horizon, and the sky was painted pink and gold, with crimson streaks sprinkling the clouds throughout. From the roof Harry could see the Thames and the crowded buildings stacked along the riverfront, the bridges crossing the water and the many city dwellers bustling around, hurrying from one place to another. Harry often came up here to watch the people below when he was feeling trapped inside his head. There was something comforting about the fact that, no matter how stuck he was feeling in his own problems, the world was moving along as fast as ever right outside his window, and whatever problem he was working through was miniscule in the whole scope of things.
“Come on,” Harry said, motioning towards the bar. “Let’s get a drink.”
This one is a rough one, guys. Major content warnings for graphic sexual content, lots of foul language, and a suicide attempt. I swear it gets much lighter after this chapter, but if any of the above items are not things you are wanting to have in your life, feel free to skip right over this chapter. No hard feelings, and the ones to follow will probably be more fun for you anyways! Thanks for reading, as always!
"I'm sorry I haven't been round as much as I should have been," he said, pretending that she was able to hear him, mostly for himself. He could hear the clock ticking on the wall, and the healers bustling up and down the hallway. His mother was probably in a deep, dreamless sleep, not to be troubled by either his apprehensions or excuses. Regardless of whether or not she could hear him, he began to talk to her as he always did when he visited. He told her about his day, about what the weather was like outside, about all the things he was sure she would have wanted to hear about his father. It was therapeutic in a way, to lie to her in a way that made his circumstances seem much better than they were. He knew it always made her happy to hear these things, and it brought him some kind of perverted, nearly delusional satisfaction to hear the words coming out of his own mouth.
“Fuck -- That’s.... Fuck…” Draco gasped between intervals, burying his fingers into Harry’s perfectly round arse and bouncing it on top of his cock. “That’s… God that’s gonna make me cum.”
“About a mile,” Harry said, pointing in the direction they would need to head. “Fuck you, London!” He shouted at the top of his lungs. Draco couldn’t help but laugh, Harry looked just like an adorable puppy with his sopping wet hair and his glasses which had been rendered utterly useless. He took them off and placed them in his jacket pocket.
He inhaled deeply, smelling the sweet, musky scent of Harry’s damp hair, and beginning to stroke his back as he breathed against Draco. He didn’t know if there were words to express how he felt right now. He didn’t think anything he could come up with would do the feeling justice.
“So… He hired you, even though you were just 16 and didn’t have any background in law?”
Draco didn’t know how long they were like this -- his mind seemed to lose track of time entirely in between the kissing and the fucking -- but at some point Harry had wrapped his legs around Draco’s back and pulled himself up to ride on top.
“How to kill Dumbledore,” Harry stated plainly, as though neither of them knew what Draco was talking about. Draco ignored him and continued.
Harry turned to look at the man beside him. Draco’s face was illuminated by the pink of the clouds overhead, his blonde hair angelic in the glow of the sunset. Harry was overcome by the urge to kiss him again, though he figured now wouldn’t be the best time for it.
“Fuck,” Draco exclaimed, remembering something and lifting his eyes up to look at the clouded skies overhead.
Harry reached for Draco’s body in the darkness beside him now, craving the reassurance that came from sharing his bed with someone else, but as his hand splayed across the sheets he found nothing on the pillows next to him. The warm, comforting euphoria he had felt quickly vanished, and he felt a lurch in his stomach akin to the wrench of the gut associated with grabbing a portkey. He remembered Draco’s body slumped against the wall in the bathroom yesterday, how he would have managed to kill himself if Harry hadn’t found him when he did. What if he had tried something like that again? What if Harry was too late to save him this time? Harry jumped to his feet, his breath quickening and the panic waking him like a douse of cold water to his face.
“Did you think about what it would be like with me?” Draco asked, his pale grey eyes fixed on Harry’s.
Harry grabbed for Draco’s free hand with his own, his green eyes wide and his lips parted slightly.
“Do you have…” He asked softly, not wanting to detract from the moment at hand.
It was the best he could remember feeling after sex. It was everything he had wanted, everything he had dreamed of for so long, and now it was Harry collapsing against his body, his messy hair nuzzling against Draco’s chest.
They looked at each other for several seconds, Harry waiting expectantly for Draco to say something, anything, but instead they just remained still as the club continued to bustle with activity around them. Harry wondered if this was what it felt like to stop time entirely, to make everything else not matter except the man in front of him. With a shock that felt like electricity going through his whole body, he wondered if this was what love felt like. Surely it was just the drinks, the raucous environment, the company of someone with whom he was quickly becoming close with, but it felt like elation, nonetheless. Like pure, unadulterated happiness.
“You need to take better care of yourself,” he said. “You can’t just go around blasting your limbs off whenever you like.”
“Did I really leave a mark on you back in June?” Harry asked playfully.
“Yeah, under the sofa,” Harry responded, his breath coming in short intervals. Draco retrieved a jar of mint flavored, magical warming lube and sank two fingers into it, proceeding to bury both of them completely inside Harry. He was so tight and warm and exactly what Draco wanted, and he could barely resist reaching his fingers up to press gently on Harry’s prostate.
Draco swallowed quickly, trying his best to remain level-headed.
“I am too, believe me,” Harry laughed, remembering his disastrous encounter with Pavarti Patil at the Yule Ball. “We’re both drunk, it doesn’t matter.” Harry fixed Draco with what he was sure was a devilish smile, hooking his fingers through Draco’s belt loops. “Let’s just let loose.”
“Don’t,” Draco said, lowering Harry’s outstretched wand. “It’s better like this.” He wanted to say it wouldn’t matter either way, because he planned on having their wet clothes in a pile in the corner as soon as possible, but figured he would just let that happen organically.
“How did you meet him?” Draco asked. “Did you just run into each other while you were there?”
Harry nearly shouted with pleasure as Draco began to rub his finger in circles, and Draco delighted when his own name was the next thing muttered out of Harry’s panting mouth.
The cool, night air whipped at their faces and clawed into their lungs as they sprinted, passing cars and muggles walking on the streets, neither of which seemed to pay them any notice. Draco’s chest felt like it was on fire but he continued to run, his legs propelling his body forward with each heartbeat, as though running away would make the problems of his past disappear entirely.
“Come here,” Draco muttered, pulling Harry’s mouth back against his. His heart was racing faster than it had been when they ran through the streets earlier. He traced the dark hair on Harry’s chest with his index finger, running his thumb across a pink, hardened nipple like he had so wanted to do back in June.
They walked in silence for a couple of moments, their feet padding through the leaves that had freshly fallen upon the grass.
“I’ll fuck you all night if you want me to,” he whispered, and could feel Harry shiver underneath him. “I’ll fuck you until you scream,” he wrapped a fist again around Harry’s cock, beginning to pump it slowly. “I’ll fuck you until neither of us remember our names.”
“That morning back in June, you left a mark on my neck when we were… you know. I went straight to the hospital after that to visit my mother and he was there, and he saw it and pieced together that I was with you.”
“His name is Mitchell Bennett,” Draco said, speaking slowly. “I was seeing him when that article came out this summer in Witch Weekly, and I was worried that.... He would be the first person Delev’s men will go after when they can’t find me.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, his voice also low. “He seemed charismatic enough when I met him last time at the bar-- I had no idea.”
Draco didn’t know if he was more shocked to learn that Harry Potter was a bottom, or that he “practiced” getting off by fucking himself with a dildo. He was sure he could use that visual to wank to for years to come.
Draco started slow at first, just letting the sounds Harry made guide him to what he should be doing, pulling out and pushing back in and eliciting the most heavenly moans from Harry with each movement. After a few times he pushed himself almost fully into Harry and felt the other man’s body tense, then immediately withdrew, squeezing Harry’s hand.
“He was 26,” Draco said, his voice a little quieter than it had been before. He had borne some of the responsibility for their relationship when it had first started, but he had really only lied about his age so he could have a desk in the library to come to every day that was away from the prying eyes of his constantly fussing mother, who would barrate him with questions about his task every time he set foot through the door each evening. The institute had become his safe place during that summer, and he was willing to overlook the fact that he might have been taken advantage of because of all the good that came out of his learning experiences there. He thought he had loved Bennett at the time, which was the craziest part as he looked back on all of this. He was a 16-year-old child. He didn’t know the first thing about love, or about loss. He wouldn’t learn of those things until this year, when everything he had known had been taken from him and he could no longer be reminded of the time in his life that Bennett represented.
“You like that?” Harry mumbled, his messy hair still leaving drops of water upon Draco’s skin.
“We won’t let her die alone. We can send her to live with your aunt, we can even bring her here. I’ll pay for the healers, I’m sure that given the circumstances we could bind them to confidentiality. Nobody would have to know.”
“You’ll have to leave a giant, very visible, very obvious hickey on my neck. Just to make it even.”
It was the most erotic thing Draco had ever witnessed in his life, Harry’s bare chest was flushed red, his body wet with rain and sweat, his stiffened cock slapping against his stomach with each bounce. He was moaning again, riding Draco faster than Draco had even been fucking him, making Draco squeeze his eyes shut with pleasure.
Harry thought again of that time after Quidditch practice, when he had unwittingly walked in on Draco and Blaise together. He thought about how many times this scene had run itself through his head afterwards. Even in the midst of everything going on that year, and despite his justified hatred of Draco, he had still managed to retain that memory and utilize it when he was alone in his four poster bed at school, desperate for the relief that it brought him to imagine himself in that scene. He had never been able to explain the thrill that accompanied this particular fantasy, and it was only now starting to make sense to him.
“Kiss me,” Harry said in a softer voice.
“Tell me what’s going on.”
“You’re losing me, Malfoy,” Harry said, but Draco could tell by his voice that he was smiling.
The smile slowly faded from Draco’s face, and he went back to staring straight ahead of him at the city traffic below. Part of Harry wished he had just left the conversation as it was, instead of pressing him for more.
"I'm sorry to hear that," he said, avoiding eye contact. He fiddled with the zipper on his bag once more.
It wasn’t until they were probably a mile away from the club, closing in on the large expanse of grass that was Regent’s Park that they finally came to a stop, both of their chests rising and falling rapidly with each intake of breath.
“It was never serious,” Draco said, his eyes gleaming as though remembering an old joke. “We mostly just experimented together, practiced getting each other off. He liked girls too, but I was always around, and we slept in the same dorm anyways, so we just helped each other out.”
When they had finished their fifth round of drinks Harry reached out and kissed Draco, pulling Draco’s body into his own and smiling into his lips. Neither of them cared who was watching them. They were safe here, in their own, anonymous club, filled with people who were like them. They could forget for a minute about the war, about the dangerous predicament both of them were in. They were just two men who could very well have been muggles kissing in a bar. It was as simple as that. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he had felt this happy.
“Are you ready?” Draco whispered, holding Harry’s gaze with an unmatched intensity.
Harry tucked his wand into an inside pocket of his jacket, still looking rather apprehensive about Draco's comment.
“Well...I told him I was 18. We treated it like an internship, since I helped him with his cases.”
He thought back to the young children he had encountered earlier that day, and a deep, overwhelming feeling of misery overcame him. He brushed away a tear as soon as he felt it on his face. He didn't want that to be the first thing his mother saw when she awoke.
“Well I think there’s only one way we can fix that,” Harry said, his fingers brushing against Draco’s on the ground beside him.
“Do you think he was asking because -”
“Draco?” He bellowed, grabbing his wand from the side table and cramming his glasses on his face. He ran to the top of the staircase and yelled Draco’s name again, not hearing any response issuing from below. His heart rate steadily rising, he cast a “Homenum Revelio” charm to save himself some time. He wondered for a sickening moment if this spell worked on the dead, but quickly pushed the thought out of his mind when a small spark issued forth from the end of his wand. The light circled the landing between the bedrooms for a moment, then halted in mid-air at the window half-way up the stairwell leading to the roof. Harry let out a deep sigh of relief, knowing exactly where Draco had gone. He ended the spell, tucking his wand into his pocket and prying the window open.
“I honestly don’t know,” Draco responded. “Things between us definitely didn’t end well, but I don’t know whether or not to peg him as the vindictive type.”
"Are you our new dad?" the girl asked, keeping the door open only far enough for Draco to see into the entryway. It was filled with scattered laundry and what looked like piles of trash stacked against the walls. The smell of the stale, unclean surroundings was spreading slowly into the hallway. Draco blinked, slightly taken aback. He wasn't good with children; he didn't know how to respond to a question like this.
