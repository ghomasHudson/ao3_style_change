“Right, right, sorry. Poor wording on my part. Of course I meant to say that, if you were to agree to give me the occasional pointer on my studies for the core N.E.W.T. modules I need, you’d receive the pleasure of…getting to watch me struggle to grasp the most basic of magical theorems and lord over me how massive your intellect is, and I wouldn’t be able to say a cross word one? Come on, surely that’s got to hold
Dinner, including Harry’s egg custard, was a rousing success, given he earned a, “Passable, Potter,” from Draco and Pansy and Theo had cleaned their plates. Greg and Millie had cleaned theirs too, but this was less a surprise or a compliment, as Draco had confided in him that Greg would eat anything that stood still long enough for him to stab it with a fork, and Millie had burned off all her taste buds in a Potions accident in Fourth Year. They set up picnic tables in the new Sanctuary, and it was kind of perfect.
Harry smiled, drawing Draco’s arms around him, resting his hands at Harry’s hips and tracing the gentle curve of his arms, up to his elbows. The dress robes were made of something not quite silk, not quite velvet but rabbit-soft and luxurious.
Draco hedged, not entirely sure what Thomassen was trying to get at. “…I told you, I won every game—”
. Was an Inflating Charm, I think. And I didn’t mean to. Just happened accidentally—but to be fair, she was saying some
, isn’t it?” Potter’s face loomed large, mooning over him from behind those horrid glasses he always wore. “Did you break anything? Fuck, that’ll be difficult to mend… Change back so we can—wait, no, don’t change here—”
, are you? Because if you’re wanting to cheat, then I should really be tutoring you in an entirely different skill set.”
Harry stilled his rutting with a squeeze to his arse and a finger on his lips, begging a moment before they made each other fall apart. “Just—for everything,” he said, and it felt so pithy, so
. He shuffled down along the lowest of the roosting branches, one leg bared to accept a letter, and Draco set to work affixing the parchment.
She nodded, releasing him at last, and wiped her eyes. “Well, you boys head off into the garden and say hello to everyone else. It’ll still be another half hour before I’m ready for you!”
“Electronics,” Hermione gently corrected. “And I’m sure they’d work just fine with the proper shielding.” She tapped her chin. “You know, that’s a thought. Mobile phones are starting to gain traction in Muggle society—my parents were talking about getting one so that they can better keep in contact with me.” She flushed. “I think they’re still sore about having their memories Modified… But the point is, Patronuses and Owls are useful for communicating over long distances, but that Charm’s complex magic, and Owl Post still takes a while. Mobile phones might be useful for witches and wizards who can’t cast a Patronus, or who lack access to the Floo Network, like those living in areas largely populated by Muggles.”
“Fuck what they want,” Draco spat, shifting upright. His eyes were dark, and they weighed heavy on Harry, staring right through him. “It’s not their life—it’s yours. You’re even stupider than I’ve given you credit for if you’re so much as
. That quiet, confident reassurance; another reminder of how much Draco trusted him, even after he’d fucked up so many times. Maybe the locket’s prediction still held true:
call that cowardice. It’s not cowardice to want to live, to do all you can so that you and those you love survive. We were
again, Potter, there are no regulations barring transforming into a dragon in the middle of a game. Honestly, if you can’t accept my strategy, then you really ought to get off the pitch.”
“Sorry it took so long—Ron always wanted to come whenever I mentioned needing to go to Diagon Alley, so I had to wait until I could get a big enough group together he wouldn’t feel obligated to come along if I wanted to slip away for a bit.” He was in a fine enough mood, so Draco doubted Pig had shit on him. Another traitor. “Been doing okay, otherwise?”
But the West Tower was still a good ways from Draco’s current location, and Potter was nearly on him. A change of route was in order, in that case, and Draco dived down, arrowing for the struts underneath the Charms Corridor and banking along the southern wall of the Great Hall, through the windows of which he could still see students milling about, the tables having been given over to studies and genial conversation. This was where they would find out who was truly the more capable flier.
…” Grabbing a pair of weights carved to look like Basilisk eggs, he unfurled the parchment and placed the weights to hold it open while he ran his eyes over what was, he was realising, an Owl Post Order form.
Draco lifted a brow. “Why on earth would that offend me?” Potter only stared at him in blank confusion, so Draco moved on. Potter’s head was a strange space; no sense in wasting time trying to pick him apart. “Those ‘like, three other homes’ are scattered around the globe, meant for holidays and business trips. How exactly were we meant to pop over to wizarding Paris when we aren’t allowed to leave Britain? Besides—” He gave a sniff, fixing his eyes on the issue of
So he’d reclaimed his spot at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, meeting no one else’s eyes and focusing solely on his meals. Someone had jinxed his spoon to wilt in his hand whenever he tried to ladle a sip of soup the first dinner back, and Pansy had had a
“You know,” Potter said when he found his way up to the Owlery during their afternoon free period, “I don’t want you to think I’m not grateful or anything…” He stepped up to Draco’s branch, giving him a respectable berth but edging close enough it felt like they were indeed having a conversation. “…But it wasn’t
something. You can’t just drop in on someone’s winter break without warning them and expect to have your every whim catered to. Impromptu appearances strike me as something you pure-blood types would frown on.” He gave Draco a twinkling side-eye. “…Flying by the seat of one’s pants is rather Gryffindor of you, I think. Maybe we’ve been spending too much time together.”
“You should, yeah—I spelled it, do it. Fuck, come on—fill me up.” His arse was clenching somehow even tighter around Harry, and he imagined his cock might have been ripped off without the proper lubrication, which would have honestly been a rather disappointing end to an otherwise enjoyable evening.
“The first time I stepped into this hall, it was the happiest moment of my life. Granted, I didn’t have the most idyllic of childhoods, so it was kind of a low bar to clear, but still.”
McGonagall’s absence from her office when he arrived suggested the Houses were still at lunch, which suited Draco
“Obviously not, don’t be dense. I’m saying if you want to do something—if you showed some effort, maybe asked for help from friends who’d probably be very happy to oblige—you can still come back from”—he waved vaguely—“all of this.”
“It wasn’t an invitation at all. It was a challenge. Everyone knows you can’t resist those. Besides—” He shrugged. “You didn’t manage to off me the last time we faced off within these hallowed halls; I thought perhaps you might like another go.” Potter’s expression went a bit queasy, and then he coloured and opened his mouth, but Draco gave a bark of derisive dismissal. “Oh,
After batting his lips with a handkerchief, he cleared his throat and gave Draco a funny look. “Usually one works up to those sorts of questions in conversation. Surely a passing comment on the weather or discussion of Christmas plans should come before diving headlong into ‘what’s the next ten years looking like for you?’ no?”
In light of his new gifts, a game of pick-up Quidditch was quickly organised after dinner, with Harry, Ginny, Angelina, and Fred on one team facing off against Draco, Charlie, George, and Ron on the other.
,” Harry reminded him, leaned against the door jamb as he watched Draco rifle through his closets. They weren’t bottomless—Harry had checked—but you wouldn’t know it from the sheer volume of fabric Draco managed to find stuffed inside. “It’s not as if they’re going to come cart you away—” Draco’s eyes flashed in warning, and Harry swallowed his tongue. Well that had been the wrong thing to say. He cleared his throat, trying again. “Shouldn’t we wait until Monday, at least? No one’s going to be about today—”
“Give back the Snitch, you wanker!” Potter roared to be heard over the whipping wind. “I can still call in the barbecue favour!
Bragge was blessedly easily distracted and eagerly dropped the matter of Draco’s mysterious disappearance from the Ministry’s holding cells in exchange for tales from the battlefront. It was hardly a topic Harry wanted to revisit so soon, but if it made Draco’s registration go a bit smoother, it was worth it—especially as he could feel Draco’s rage bubbling just under his skin, heralding an imminent explosion of anger and frustration. He hadn’t wanted to come here in the first place, and now he had to sit back, quietly so as not to give anyone cause to think him unstable, and watch as Harry politely went ten rounds with every lookie-loo in the Ministry itching for stories from a war most hadn’t been remotely involved in.
good idea in seven and a half years of schooling thus far, so the odds had been stacked against him.
Deciding they had kept themselves cooped up in their little love nest long enough, and that lunches at the Manor definitely did not count as proper outings, Harry threw his weight into convincing Draco to come visit the Burrow with him, finally managing it well into June. He hadn’t wanted the Weasleys to think he was avoiding them, but he’d needed a bit of time to himself—and to Draco—after that final battle. It was quiet in Grimmauld Place, and there had been a comfortable rhythm with Draco that did not involve Muggle gadgets and gizmos and a house fit to bursting with life. Harry loved the Weasleys, but he was finding out there were a lot of other things he loved as well, so he’d kind of been enjoying his little holiday, as it were.
Out here, in the safety of the Scottish countryside and shielded from Muggle eyes, Draco could let loose—and so he did, diving and rolling and capering like a boy with his first broom, wild and carefree as he’d never been in the Sanctuary. Harry stole a moment, just to watch him, until the excited pounding of his heart grew too much to bear, and he mounted up and kicked off.
though? He couldn’t outfly Potter on a broomstick, not on a straightaway, so a trip of that distance ought to have taken him
“Damned if I know. I think all they found of him after his house was blown sky-high in the resulting explosion was a couple of teeth.” Ron speared a mini sausage from his baked beans onto his fork. “Muggle electrigs don’t work too well around magic.”
, they could take advantage of him. And having spent the better part of the last three years trapped under some boot or another, Draco was so very,

changed. It’s so hard to get your bearings when you don’t know what you’re even meant to be walking toward. It’s like—there’s a fog around that battle, and I’m spoilt for choice as to which way to go, but I worry that any false step I make might be a step
He entered with a soft knock on the door for her attention, and she turned to smile at him—not so very bright, but warm enough—as she beckoned him inside. She was sprawled out on a chaise longue with a thick green-and-red tartan blanket thrown over her knees, and as he approached, she set aside the book she’d had open in her lap:
“It was the safest place I could think to beg Shacklebolt to put you. At least there you’d be trained to defend yourself
“Your parents are…Muggles?” Draco asked, in that same sort of strained tone of forced politeness Narcissa used with Harry. As if he didn’t well know Hermione was Muggleborn—he’d certainly thrown enough slurs at her over the years about her blood status.

, and Draco panicked for a moment, thinking she’d ingested something nasty from the garden, or else the horrors they’d been through over the past year and more had finally caught up with her. She was unaccountably optimistic about Draco training for an Aurorship, as if it were something to be
Draco ran a finger down his spine, resting his chin on Harry’s shoulder. Sometimes Harry hated the inch or two of height Draco had on him; other times…
When he did at last work up the nerve to turn around, he found her standing patiently, hands clasped primly before her. She seemed to be waiting for him, and when he didn’t break the silence in a timely enough manner for her satisfaction, she said with a smooth, clean tranquillity, “…‘Draco,’ was it?” He tried not to wince. “You’re friends with Harry Potter?”
It took three people to pry Draco from Potter’s shoulders, so deeply did he dig in his talons, but as he was an owl and these were grown wizards, he was eventually bested and magically fitted with a solid silver band on his right leg etched with
curious about what had Potter so worked up. What could be so urgent that he would risk further maiming by what Draco was quite confident was the most ill-tempered (but best bred) bird in the Owlery?
“Flew, obviously.” He leaned around Potter, wondering where the little Scops had got off to. “Followed that bird you sent to harass me.”
it.” Harry’s grin widened, so much it hurt his cheeks, and Draco’s eyes were bright as he blurted out in a huff, “I want to go back.”
Together they squeezed into the telephone box, drawing the door shut with a snap behind them. Harry awkwardly reached for the receiver, lifting it out of the way to show the dial. He hooked a finger into the little divots of
In the wake of graciously helping Potter not break his neck dicking about with his friends—not that Potter deserved the thoughtfulness; it was only, Draco’s mother had risked her life to save the Boy Saviour’s skin, and he didn’t want her good turn to go to waste—Draco realised that convincing Potter he was willing to deliver his letters and parcels for the low, low fee of a handful of delicious owl treats was, in fact, an absolutely
, loathe to my very core, and who likely hate me with just as much vitriol because there are ‘worse places to work’.” He shoved Potter back with the finger poking his chest. “And heavens know I can’t afford to be picky!”
“Well the people who matter won’t necessarily be hiring. We don’t all have the luxury to pick and choose which jobs we take up, if any.”
As a group, they Flooed to the public fireplaces near Gringotts, from which they made their way along the cobblestone path to visit the remaining twin Weasley at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.
, and he climbed up onto the four-poster alongside Harry, graceful and lithe. “I didn’t want to be too compromised.”
“Right…” Weasley said, keeping an eye on Draco and taking a measured step back, as if fearing he might be the next target. A wise move. “So, er—were you coming back inside, or…?” He jerked a thumb back towards the ramshackle home. “Mum’s wanting our input on what to make for Christmas lunch.”
as he glided over to Harry’s wardrobe, he had to wonder if all this fuss wasn’t influenced, just a little, by the dragon wanting to show off for its mate. Then again, Draco was a prissy tosser by nature, so it could just be innate.
They landed in the sitting room, and Harry was already starting to unbutton his dress robes, tugging at the tie Draco had worked so hard on, before his head had stopped spinning. He wondered if it would send the wrong signal if he popped down to the cellar to retrieve one of the wine bottles—or something stronger. He supposed this late, a glass of warm milk was a better choice if he needed something soothing, but the buzz of alcohol did wonders for making everything go soft and fuzzy, rendering reality a bit less daunting in times when things got overwhelming—like right about now.
my opportunistic young wizard,” she laughed. “I’d be delighted for the company, if you really think it’s for you.”
“I didn’t say trust blindly.” Potter took a step forward, arms folded behind his back. “Give me six months. Six months—and if, at the end of our training period, you
A sharp whistle rending the air called down his own owl, a particularly imposing specimen of an Eagle Owl named Xerxes bearing a flashy silver band on his leg etched with

No, he wasn’t. Or he hadn’t been at least—not until Potter had made the proposal, and now it didn’t sound like a half-bad idea at all.
Unfortunately, Draco was about to take aim and drop a wet, sopping dollop of owl shit squarely on his plan.
the name they’d agreed on. But Potter only shrugged, nearly sending Draco toppling off, and he had to hold his wings out to regain his balance. “He’s been a bit lonely since I bought him, being away from the shop with the other owls, so I thought I might keep him around a bit to help him get acclimated.”
He’d considered a letter at first—it was formal, he could compose his thoughts more easily, and there was no chance of emotion getting the better of him and him winding up cursing Potter (or getting cursed). But after spending an entire afternoon trying to decide how to even

?” Draco ribbed as they turned down the grimy, glorified alleyway hosting the Visitor’s Entrance. It was overcast, making the darkened shopfronts and graffitied walls seem all the more imposing. The old red telephone box used as the entrypoint for Ministry visitors was impossible to miss, looking as shabby and dilapidated as ever and still missing multiple windowpanes with the receiver itself hanging at an odd angle.
“Can’t—hold off—” he grunted, sweat dripping in his eyes from the effort; he was almost drawing completely out on the downstroke now before burying himself deep as he could go on the up, and it still didn’t feel like enough. He couldn’t mark Draco on the outside, but maybe inside—if he let Harry. “Draco…
“Asking me not to be ridiculous is a tall order.” He hopped to his feet, pacing the room and its contents. It seemed so…
“Now, Mr. Potter, if I could just get your signature on this particular form?” Bragge slid a slip of light-blue paper over to Harry. “For our records.”
, not for himself, of course…his personal stash was up in the belfry) and offered a handful, which was greedily accepted.
Potter’s eyes were wide behind his Quidditch goggles. “…Nothing. Anyway, screw you!” And with that, he was gone, leaving Draco alone with his new Snitch and a sudden urge to have the password on the door leading down to the Dungeon changed.
“Definitely not,” Harry chided gently, trying to shift his body away—though he only succeeded in drawing one of Draco’s legs between his own, causing his cock to rub just so over Draco’s thigh. He swallowed. “Unless you want to get arrested for public indecency.”
But disappointingly, Potter wasn’t disgusted by these thankless gifts at all—quite the contrary, he actually
She marked her place in the book, then carefully closed it, setting it aside and holding her hand out for Draco to kiss. “Welcome back, Dearest. I trust you had a nice stay with Blaise?”
After bidding Blaise farewell until the New Year’s party the Zabinis were planning, Draco returned to Wiltshire, finally getting the hang of this strange time-slipping flight of which magical owls seemed capable. He didn’t think he was ready to try heading all the way back to Hogwarts with only his instincts to guide him, but perhaps with time.
Draco ignored him, but his fist started moving faster over his cock, a slick, squelching blur. When he released a soft, shuddering gasp that Harry well recognised, he ratcheted his thrusts up another octave, trying to fuck right
Draco was still staring at his ring as they slid under the covers, mesmerised, and Harry could make him out as a soft blur when he removed his glasses, bringing his own ring close enough to see in the low lamplight. “Hermione and Ron are gonna ask about them, you know.”
As October stretched on and the lazy, warm days of summer at last came to a close, though, Potter’s “visits” became less frequent, until by Halloween, he might go a week without showing up at all. This, Draco was perfectly pleased with—except he’d grown fond of the brand of owl treats Potter seemed to have an endless supply of, and he was starting to get cravings even as a human, which was most disconcerting. Undoubtedly they’d be absolutely
“Well, if you insist.” Draco leaned in and kissed him, perhaps to wash away the foreign flavour of the magical lubricant—though Harry tasted nothing on his tongue but the salt of his sweat and the faint, bitter tang of himself.
“The easiest way you know how,” Potter repeated in monotone. “That doesn’t mean it’s the easiest way. Just means you don’t know better.”
and pulling out a memo folded into the shape of a paper crane, which fluttered weakly in his palm. He unfolded it to check its contents. “Thomassen—Auror Thomassen, that is—has requested you stop by his office in the Bullpen once we’ve squared away our business here.”
But Potter was only smiling, a little self-deprecating thing that put Draco on edge—perhaps the shock of realising that Alabastard was only Draco Malfoy in transformation had pushed him over the edge, and he was about to finish the job he’d started in the sixth-floor boys’ bathroom the previous year.
“Hm. The headless hat was amusing for five seconds or so.” Draco frowned to himself. “I’m still trying to sort out what exactly the Demon Box is.”
Tedward squirmed in his grasp, and Draco gave a sniffing chuckle. “Cheer up, young one. You’ve had a rough go of it so far, but you’re already better than 90% of the riff-raff you’ll meet in your long life going forward, so there’s that to take pride in.”
Treats were always forthcoming now, stored secreted away in a fat little owl-shaped pot that was hidden in Potter’s wardrobe outside of visiting hours. Potter had learned that veggie-anything would be spat back in his face, and fish-based flavours were pushing it as well. Draco would try most anything—the owl’s tastes were worlds away from his own, after all—but he still had standards, and if Potter for whatever reason wanted the pleasure of his continued company, he would note what was and wasn’t acceptable to serve a guest.
“Yeah, all right. Anyone see where the Bludgers got off to? I don’t wanna—hey, where’re you going, Harry? Harry??”
“Hey, welcome back!” came a familiar voice, and Draco’s head swivelled around, peering through the foliage. Just inside the window where the Scops had entered stood Potter, hair a mess and glasses askew, but what else was new? The Scops had perched on his shoulder and was nibbling on his ear, and Potter had to gently cup it in his hands and move it down to what Draco could now see was a set of several perches of varying heights. He gave the owl’s legs a once-over—and then frowned, face falling when he saw it had returned empty-taloned. “…Well, thanks anyway, Pig,” he said with a tight smile, reaching into his pocket and feeding it a treat (dare Draco hope these might be Peppermint Ginger Goose Gizzard?) with one hand while he stroked its head gently with the other. “Nice job on the delivery, mate.”
Harry felt the blood leave his face, and Mrs. Weasley’s sumptuous stew began to bubble nauseatingly in his stomach. “What? Why? He hasn’t done anything wrong!”
“You just said everything’s changed, and that’s got you thrown. I don’t think I’ve really changed. I think I’m the same as I’ve always been—just…maybe a little more worldly.”
, Draco could still feel the magic wracking his body, trembling from the strain to his muscles as he’d struggled against the spell.
Even his own bedroom seemed somehow too big, too open to the elements. The balcony window he would leave thrown open during summers he now kept shut, locked tight with a bolt and five different warding spells. Three days into the holidays, he found himself wishing he were back at Hogwarts already, tucked away safe in the bowels of the castle with only the peeping eyes of the merfolk peering in through the thick glass windows in the Common Room to worry about.
Draco lifted the bag and checked its branding, but Harry had ensured that the item was packed in a plain paper bag and simple velvet box, so as not to give anything away until it had been opened.
He knew—had known for a while—what decision he was going to make, but he couldn’t shake the fear he was making it more out of wanting to cling to the past than to prepare for the future. Still, the fact was he didn’t feel he’d gotten everything there was to
Someone knocked softly on his door, and he muttered a gruff, “Come in, if you must…” He could count on one hand the number of people who’d dare disturb him when his door was shut, and they were all relatively tolerable presences. He supposed he could stand being seen moping by any one of them.
“Your name. Or, the owl’s name. Ron’s already asked after it, and Mrs Weasley’s curious as well. If you’re going to be ‘around’ for a bit, I’ll be expected to have named you by now.”
? was Draco’s violently rasped hiss, but Potter didn’t seem to understand it, now wringing his hands in frantic worry.
“Because I’m told I’m pretty thick and don’t generally recognise that sort of thing even when it’s right in front of me. So…” He clicked his heels together, with a sort of half-bounce on his toes. “You might have to be more…direct.”
“Because you kept shooting down all my ideas, so I had to wait for you to suggest something yourself, of course.” Potter leaned back against the chill stone of the tower walls, shoving his horrible Potions parchment into his pocket. “I’m getting good at this.”
“You’re certainly a mean enough little shit to make one suspect…” He scratched his temple, eyes screwing up in thought behind his glasses. “…Well you’re obviously
Draco narrowed his gaze, trying to pick Potter apart. “…And when’s the last time you spoke to Robards?”

, just a witch who’d had just about enough lip, apparently, from her only child. “You’re no longer in school. Behave as such.” And Draco shut
They made their way inside, Blaise leading them to a well-lit library warmed on one side by the wan sunlight streaming through the bay windows and on the other by a roaring fireplace. As they settled in for tea and sandwiches provided by a stream of house-elves, Draco couldn’t shake the odd feeling that…he wasn’t supposed to be doing this. Sitting around as a human, doing human things, with other humans. It was just so…
Now, he could easily avoid Potter, of course—there were perfectly respectable roosts well out of Potter’s reach, and with one more well-positioned shit, Potter would probably never bother him again.
“Can’t work on a team, can’t work alone…” Thomassen sighed, flipping to another page in the file. “You’re an Animagus.”
“I’m doing so well in Charms, Hermione thinks I’m cheating.” He said this, beaming with pride, and Draco was reminded that he

), one hand snaking up to hold Draco by the exposed nape of his neck, just at his collar, while the other grabbed at the front of his robes to hold him fast and close. Like he was worried Draco might bolt (understandable) and wanted a real, physical reminder he was here and not going anywhere.
“We could just meet somewhere else?” Potter suggested, teeth chattering and getting nowhere with his Potions essay. Even with Slughorn’s favouritism, he still needed to turn in
“Oh that’s an easy enough fix,” Eeylops said, raising his wand. “I can simply switch out the owner’s name. What would you like it to read instead?”
When they came tumbling out again, it was into a cottage similarly cramped to the Burrow but much more modestly appointed, with a charm Draco could actually appreciate. Muted colours, grand windows letting in the wan winter light, and a massive family portrait hanging over the fireplace through which they’d just arrived, showing a portly man with fair hair, a brown-haired woman who had a stirring familiarity to her, and a beaming young girl between them, one parent’s hand on each shoulder and sporting a shock of vibrant bubblegum-pink hair.
—” He could feel his cheeks heating and thanked whatever magic ran through the old house that the lamps had dimmed on their own accord, and perhaps Draco wouldn’t notice—or would chalk it up to arousal.
Potter chucked his wand away; it clattered against the floor and then rolled rattling under one of the beds. He held his hands up in a penitent gesture. “Shit, I’m sorry! I’m sorry, I didn’t realise it was you! I—I—” He cocked his head to the side, brows knitting. “It…it is
“You’re the one begging for aid,” Draco huffed, stamping his feet and rubbing his arms. This was getting

he could do. Harry snaked a hand around the back of Draco’s head, drawing him in for a warm, full kiss and promptly swallowing any further remarks. Draco allowed it, but only for a heartbeat, before he slipped a hand between them, deftly plucking at the line of silver buttons down the front of Harry’s robes.
It was Wednesday the twelfth, and that meant it was time for his bimonthly Floo trip to the Ministry to meet with Probation Officiate Wentsworth of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Juvenile Penal Affairs subdivision. The Wizengamot had wanted to bump his case up to be handled by the Wizarding Penal Affairs subdivision, seeing as he was of age, but his barrister had argued that, seeing as the crimes for which he was being placed on probation had been committed as a juvenile, he should be allowed to be treated as such, present age notwithstanding. It didn’t make any sense at all to Draco, but he certainly wasn’t going to argue otherwise.
. It was only he was a bit unclear on who that someone should be. “…I had my bimonthly meeting with Wentsworth this morning.”
There was that feeling again—the odd sensation that turned his stomach, realising he was learning more about Potter than he wanted. The old saying was hogwash; familiarity did
“What?” Were Ron and Hermione about to get into another row? He sometimes wondered if bickering was their idea of foreplay, as they seemed to

offered lunch, as it turned out, but it wasn’t exactly free. It was all hands on deck at the castle, and Harry spotted no fewer than half a dozen familiar faces among those engaged in construction and renovation and restoration. Draco proved more excited by the prospect of finally being able to stretch his wings again than he’d let on, grabbing Harry while he was in the middle of catching up with Seamus and Dean and practically frog-marching him to the Quidditch pitch.
“Yeah, but I’ve just remembered there’s a book I wanted to ask about at Flourish and Blotts; I’m sure I’ll forget about it if I don’t take care of it now. I won’t be more than fifteen or twenty minutes, I’m sure.”
He did; that was the trouble. He felt his face heat and struggled to keep his voice even. That he was getting so emotional was humiliating enough; he certainly didn’t need Potter realising the effect he still had on Draco after all this time. The idea Potter could do anything but bring out the very worst side of Draco was laughable. ‘Saviour’ his great white feathered arse. He took a measured breath, biting out in his most vicious whisper, “I’ll handle
.” He took a step closer, slotting all the right bits of himself just so against the right bits of Harry, until they were breathing the same air on each heady inhalation. “You can say no. I’m not saying you have to—or even that you
Harry had warned Mrs. Weasley in advance that he would be bringing Draco along as his dinner guest, hoping she would pass the word around to Bill so he didn’t try to Hex Draco on sight again, but he could not have possibly prepared himself for the sight of Molly flinging herself at Draco the moment they’d stepped through the Floo, wrapping him in a crushing hug that he’d be feeling for a few days.
And because Draco was very sharp, he finally saw what Potter was trying to do: tell him, gently, politely, that he wanted Draco to leave.
“You aren’t some hopeless cause, you know. You’ve only got a few more hurdles than others might. Maybe if you stopped feeling so sorry for yourself and moping about, you’d see that.”
The window to Potter’s room was closed, as it usually was this late in the year with winter on the horizon, and Draco quietly buzzed the tower, softly buffeting the pane with his wings on each pass. He could catch the sounds of muffled conversation within and amorphous forms obscured by the glazing of the glass as they moved in and out of the light.
She flicked her eyes between them, lips pursed tight—to keep from smiling, Harry was relieved to see. “Do I need to ask Ron to help me with the potatoes instead?”

Harry turned, gaping, to Draco, whose brows lifted in challenge. “How else am I going to kick your arse fairly if you’re puttering about on some cupboard trash? Granted, it’s no match for my Nimbus 2020, but I can’t afford to give you
Draco whirled on him, and that was about all the slow evisceration he could stand. Time to rip some heads off. “What the
Potter was speaking in riddles, so Draco latched on to the bit that made the most sense right now. “Don’t be so sure. I haven’t yet begun to try.”
Potter jerked his hand back, frowning down at his fingers. “Are you this bad-mannered by nature, or am I just special?” He sighed when Draco began craning his neck, trying to see where Potter had stashed the purse full of treats, and shuffled his way back over to the sill and its still-open window. “You really
“Hope you weren’t planning on finally fucking me today,” he drawled morosely under his breath as they stepped out into the Atrium, its rich hardwood floors and peacock-blue ceiling unchanged from a year prior. “Someone else has beat you to the punch.”
him tamed; it was only…he wanted to be prepared, he supposed. So he didn’t fuck things up, as he was so wont to do.
Mrs. Weasley insisted on having a big to-do at the Burrow, and while Harry would have been happy just having a few friends over at Grimmauld Place for something a bit less of a hassle, he’d never been able to turn Molly down.
request, and perhaps if Draco compromised here, he could afford to dig in his heels when Potter pressed him for something more odious later. Besides, half the student population was ogling them at this very moment, and he could truthfully tell anyone who asked he was only tutoring the phenomenally stupid Saviour, perhaps even claim it was part of his probation and thus done only under duress. “Fine.”
The morning brought apologies and another fantastic breakfast spread, and though Draco’s temper had cooled overnight, he was still in a foul mood and so disinclined to jump for joy at Potter’s proposal of another fun outing.
He pasted on a smile. “Nah, I just think someone might’ve spiked my Butterbeer. Can I lend you a hand?”
He’d felt out of sorts for so long, wondering if it had just been the war that had changed his priorities, making schoolyard rivalries suddenly seem petty—and it
?” It was very difficult to look on the bright side of the situation, but he was bent on being the bigger man here. Parkinson and Goyle embodied the very worst aspects of Slytherin’s finer traits, but Draco had been friends with them, once upon a time, and if he was still of a mind to call them as such, then Harry didn’t want to stand in the way.
“I’m—not!” Harry protested, though he doubted this was believable, all evidence being to the contrary. He grabbed a robe of his own, cinching it angrily at the waist, and followed Draco down the stairs. “You’re just being suggestive. I can hardly help reacting.”
Which was, he could see, currently hovering just behind a string of pennants looped under the awning of the Gryffindor stands. Potter was still all smiles as he traded what sounded like needling banter with Finnigan, oblivious to the whereabouts of the most important piece of this mid-air chess match they were about to play, which was
Draco made a swipe for it, but Harry slipped it back into the packet of papers they needed to return to the Registrar. “Just remember you said that when I start shitting in your shoes or rutting against your leg while there’s company over.”
“Oh indeed. I probably know more about that stuff than you, actually.” The wry smile twisted tighter, curling in on itself. “But we in Stealth and Tracking tend to operate on a somewhat looser scale of morality than our friends on the front lines. So like I said, you’d be a decent fit.” He nodded. “We’d have to work on your team integration, probably”—Oh yes, because a bunch of seasoned Aurors were just going to
had plans—terrible ones, but plans. Sure, he’d probably get himself killed within the first week on the job, but at least he’d go out doing what he did best: playing the hero.
He fingered the fabric, marvelling at its texture—smooth like silk, but breathable, and with a little give; Harry had hated how constricting the robes Mrs. Weasley had picked out for him back in Fourth Year had felt.
“Just you wait, Malfoy~” Pansy threatened in sing-song as she stumbled down to the kitchen to Floo home, barely catching herself on the banister.
He didn’t say it in protest—no, he just sounded curious, and Harry turned the question over in his head. “…Once I tell them, it’ll be real.”
The Christmas holidays were upon them sooner than Draco had expected, which was surprising, seeing as the halls had been well and thoroughly decked with the absolute tackiest decorations Galleons could buy since December 1st. You couldn’t walk ten paces without having a poorly tuned carol screeched at you by one of the statues or getting pelted by Peeves with projectile ornaments or nearly slipping in puddles of indeterminate liquid as the Ravenclaws tried, as they did every year, to tweak
“Well one, I was thinking I could carry you, as an owl. And two, I was going to sneak you back to Gryffindor Tower with me. Then you could slip out the window and head back to the Dungeon that way without having to worry about running into Filch or Mrs Norris. Plus no risking breaking your neck flying through the hallways.”
They couldn’t have dinner parties every night, though, and within only a few short days, Draco’s edginess had built once more, making him even more snappish and peevish than usual. Convinced that one or both of them was going to blow a fuse if they didn’t find a suitable outlet for Draco’s pent-up energy beyond the bedroom, Harry stuck his head through the Floo while Draco was in the shower.
bad at it—and for whatever it was worth, he seemed genuinely confused right now. So he’d either had himself Obliviated (entirely possible; word was that sort of magic was old hat for Granger now), or he hadn’t been involved in the push for Draco to join the Aurors at all.
“Touché,” she tittered, then cocked her head. “What’s brought this offer on? You’ve been a veritable ghost ever since you returned from Hogwarts, and now you want to be underfoot?”
No, that the Malfoys continued to live a blessed life even after the fall of Voldemort was not so very surprising; what was truly astonishing was the fact that Lucius hadn’t been chucked back into Azkaban the moment Kingsley had been appointed temporary Minister for Magic. In retrospect, Harry supposed he should have seen it coming; had he not told Draco himself that his parents had a talent for managing to keep their heads above water when most anyone else would have sunk like a stone?
in this one’s repertoire, and it spoke to Draco’s preoccupation and discomfiture with the events of late he hadn’t seen it coming from a mile off. “Wait—are you here to
“Right, well, enjoy your treats. If you can manage some self-restraint on future encounters, there might be more where that came from.” He gave Draco a long, hard look—then shook his head, blinking at himself in bemusement. “…The hell am I talking to a bloody bird for? God, I really must miss Hedwig…”
And speaking of unwashed masses—Potter and his herd of Weasleys found themselves spat out of the public Floos near Gringotts at precisely 11 o’clock. As Potter had suggested they meet up at noon, Draco held back—reining in any urges to buzz him with a literal dung-bomb—and instead quietly watched the group wriggle their way through the throng, stopping first by the Wheezes establishment before continuing on to shops like Scrivenshaft’s and Wiseacre’s and Slug & Jiggers.
“Not a bad look at all, considering…” Draco ran a finger through the lacy white stripes coating Harry’s stomach.
Breathing heavily, he scanned the tower above—and saw Potter, leaned through one of the windows but too large to fit fully inside. He couldn’t make out details from this distance with his shitty human vision, but he was pretty sure the lovely red line now scarring Potter’s left cheek was his own handiwork.
. You used to tease me, saying I sought out the limelight and those stupid fucking headlines, and it
“Because…” Potter frowned, a line of worry forming between his brows. “Because my friends are either busy with their own studies or need a tutor themselves. Plus you hate me, so I can at least trust you to be strict with me. And your marks were always only second to Hermione’s so…I mean, you know your shit.” He made a face, nose wrinkling. “…You aren’t going to put this memory in a Pensieve or something so you can dive in for instant replay whenever you want to hear me saying you’re smarter than I am, are you?”
But Potter’s idle threats were just that: idle. No house-elves came to harass Draco while he napped, and though Potter declined to return to the Owlery for another week and a half after the ‘faecal incident’, Draco was under no impression this was because he was lodging a formal complaint with McGonagall to do something about ‘that nasty brute in the West Tower’.
After a good half hour of cavorting, Draco seemed to have finally burnt off enough excess energy he wasn’t practically vibrating out of his skin any longer, and they returned to the ground. There was a high, happy flush to his cheeks when he shifted back, his hair a windswept mess, but he was grinning from ear to ear with an infectious smile Harry couldn’t help but catch himself.
When Draco asked why his attendance was required at what was looking to be a rather raucous reunion of Weasleys, with everyone but Charlie in attendance, Harry had simply turned his own words on him: “Because I want you there.”
Harry had grumbled his displeasure, though it had mostly been for show; he was honestly relieved to have a bit of quiet time to himself before the event, to compose his thoughts, if nothing else. He was still feeling uncomfortable—and a tiny bit nauseated—with the idea of having to march up in front of the crowd and deliver a speech, but he settled his nerves with a reminder that if he’d survived the Killing Curse (twice!), he could surely handle a bit of public speaking.
Potter only rolled his eyes, throwing his hands in the air. “As I said before: you’ll get the pleasure of telling me, multiple times an evening I expect, that I’m thick, a dunderhead, and quite possibly beyond salvaging. That should give you
Draco flashed him a sharp smile that was not at all happy. “I already died for you, Potter. Was the once not enough?”
“When they want to,” Draco said, distractedly sipping his coffee as he watched Potter from the corner of his eye. Over at the Gryffindor table, he was deeply entrenched in conversation with Finnigan and Weasley, trading excited whispers that no doubt concerned their strategy for the afternoon’s game. A pity they wouldn’t get to implement it; Potter
Harry felt his knees go weak, and he leaned against one of the posts for support, grimacing. “Oh god—

After several tense moments of Potter waiting for Draco to do something nasty but nothing nasty forthcoming, he finally chanced returning his attention to his Charms work, and at length, Draco found himself drifting off once more to the soft
Gryffindor lately, after all, so it was time to let his red-and-gold flag flap free for a bit and renew his vows to his house’s motto.
Weasley didn’t bother waiting to learn how he ought to address Draco, though, instead just walking right over and reaching up, beanpole that he was, to try and pet him. Delighted at the audacity, Draco gave him a warning hiss, then nipped with intent to remove a finger—but Weasley jerked his hand back with a yelp, and that was almost as satisfying.
Draco let his mind drift back, back to the broken Vanishing Cabinet in need of mending. To an impossible task he had no business taking on. To a frail, rasping voice telling him he wasn’t a killer, that he could be
But at least Draco had a perfectly sound excuse, in that he was absolutely bored out of his skull, and annoying Potter had proven a perfect remedy for such doldrums in the past, so it stood to reason. The only question was how to go about surprising Potter
Draco’s birthday rolled around the first week of June, and Harry decided to start his special day off right with breakfast in bed—his preferred porridge, of course. As he was finishing his pumpkin juice, Harry placed a small gift box on the tray, trying not to fidget with excitement. Perhaps Draco could sense his eagerness, for he ignored the box at first, draining his cup to the last drop and daintily dabbing at his lips with his napkin.
“God, am I.” He was painfully hard now, and he really didn’t give two shits if Draco teased him for it. He’d wipe that smarmy expression off his face in short order, regardless.
This didn’t seem to matter to the owl, though, as whatever magical energies it was attuned to seemed to ping true, and so long as Draco kept above the clouds and flapped until he felt in his gizzard or craw or whatever body part birds navigated by that it was time to descend, he felt confident he’d make it to his destination eventually.
That was looking less and less likely now, though, for it would only be a matter of time after being hired before someone caught him commuting to work and outed him
He scooped up his bag of contraband from the bell tower, then swooped down and around to his bedroom window. The elves had cleared the balcony of the snowfall that blanketed the countryside, and when he touched down and shifted back, his polished black loafers squeaked against the smooth marble tiling.
“Keep being an insufferable irritation and perhaps you’ll find out,” Draco said, before realising it perhaps wasn’t quite the threat he’d meant it to be. He took a beat, steadied himself, then fixed Potter with a long, meaningful look. “…You really didn’t tell them to recruit me?”
But he wasn’t trying to. He was only trying to get back to the castle and its imposing Gothic architecture that was just
Draco weighed his options—sit around the Burrow all day, with nowhere to go and nothing to do except perhaps try to find Potter’s room and rifle through his things (tempting!) or at least get out and see a bit of civilisation, even if he had to do so as an owl and pretend to be Potter’s stupid pet the entire time. It was a difficult decision indeed, but Potter sweetened the deal with a reminder that Eeylops was having a holiday sale—3 scoops of their Merry Mix treats for 10 Sickles—so he resigned himself to an afternoon veritably stitched to Potter’s shoulder.
“Good point. It does get vicious,” Ron agreed. “That trove from Neville and Dean and Seamus wasn’t enough to tide you over?”
Draco took a breath, granting himself one final chance to come to his senses, then shifted from slick, straight trousers and a wool jumper over a button-down into a fluffy coat of pristine white feathers that nicely matched the cold marble balcony. He hopped up onto the banister, sighting the little Scops still making a wobbling attempt to gain altitude, then spread his wings and took off after it.
one to talk. You’re ready to take heads off the moment someone disparages the good name of Weasley or Granger.” He then allowed himself a superior little smile. “Or steals your Snitch.”
Harry slipped away, as quietly as possible, and half-jogged to the kitchen. He couldn’t listen to any more—it was
As they made their way down to the kitchen, the sounds of activity greeted them: bangs and clangs of pans, the hiss of running water, and the soft murmur of quiet conversation. Hermione and Ron were back, it seemed, which meant Harry and Draco’s idyllic morning was at an end. That would teach him to sleep in.
working toward something, and while he didn’t have anything in particular he was ‘dreaming of doing’, he still had drive and ambition. The urge to prove himself, to be something more than the very worst parts of his family name. He wanted, really he did, to tell Potter he was taking more N.E.W.T.s than even Potter was, just to show he wasn’t this beaten down pathetic carcass, that he still had some fucking

God, this was going to be a disaster. He’d spent so long worrying it wouldn’t be perfect, he hadn’t bothered taking any steps to

“Please; you’re utterly bereft of the Black line’s exquisite bone structure,” Draco sniffed. He turned to Harry. “We’ll have to blast ‘Noble’ off the family tapestry now.”
“Excellent—shall we Apparate around…” He glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner, which said it was past ten now. “Noon?”
When the doorknob jiggled again and Potter poked his stupid face back through, it was well after nightfall, and he was
Charlie lifted a brow, bemused. “…You don’t remember me? No—you were pretty out of it, so I guess you wouldn’t. I’m Charlie, Charlie Weasley.”
Draco made a noncommittal noise, certainly not prepared to discuss his current complete and utter lack of prospects going forward.
“Not necessary,” Harry smiled, guiding Draco closer, so they were better aligned. His cock stood stiff and proud, nosing at the inside of Draco thigh and weeping angrily for the loss of that warm, wet mouth.
Draco took a step back and shoved his hands in the pockets of his robes. His face still felt hot with anger, and he could feel his blood boiling in his veins. He knew he ought to be angry with
They put off christening the Snitch for later, as Hermione and Ron would be rumbling about now, and they had a terribly, horribly awkward lunch with the Malfoys to prepare for.

had to complain about. Maybe that was what had done in the last owl, even. Draco wanted peace, he wanted quiet, and he wanted to be forgotten. None of those things was going to come to pass sitting here lazily digesting owl treats on Harry Potter’s window sill, watching him stumble his way through a Charms essay poor Flitwick really didn’t deserve to have inflicted upon his person.

, a bright and squinty-eyed thing that had nearly knocked Draco off his perch the first time it had been shot his way.
“Evidently,” Harry muttered, cheeks still burning—though his lips refused to be wiped of the stupid smile plastered across them.
Potter wobbled unsteadily, barely catching himself before he went tumbling back down when Draco shoved him away. “I’m not concussed,” he protested—but winced when he touched the back of his head. “I don’t think.” He cast about for his wand, catching it where it had rolled under one of the desks. He slipped it back into his sleeve, then groused, “You could’ve just disarmed me with whatever wand you’ve been using, you know. I don’t think wands are
In a pique of adrenaline-fuelled anger and surprise, he lashed out with everything he had, and he screeched in triumph when he felt his free talon strike flesh. Potter yelped, and Draco was free. He took a tumble but managed to catch himself, soaring through one of the windows on the opposite side of the tower and transforming back before he’d even made it to ground level. He collapsed onto his knees as his feet hit the straw-covered ground with a sharp
“…I suppose you’ll be Weasley’s owl, then?” he said, scritching it under the chin with one hand while he untied the scroll with the other. He ought to have known; something
“Now, don’t tell anyone,” Potter warned, placing a finger over his lips, “but it’s got an Undetectable Extension Charm on it, so there’s probably more owl treats in there than you could eat in your entire lifetime.” Oh but Draco
The worst thing about being an Animagus, you see, was the fact that, after lengthy spell preparations that were entirely too time-consuming and convoluted, you didn’t even get to choose your form.
Harry wondered if the “Slytherin way” to seduction was romanticised siege warfare, driving Harry to the edge until he was finally forced to give in. If so, Draco had clearly studied at the foot of the masters—and patience had never been one of Harry’s virtues, a fact Draco was mercilessly taking advantage of. He almost imagined he could hear that damned clock in his head again, counting down the sighs, the breaths, the heated moments until Harry broke—but he only dug in his heels all the deeper, determined to do this
slowly. I mean, maybe it’s charmed to expand—otherwise if you put one on a young owl, you’d have to keep going back to the caster to get it changed out when it got too big for the band, right?”
“Hm.” Draco took him by the wrist, placing Harry’s palm so it splayed over his bare chest. It was still a marvel, seeing that bare expanse of smooth, porcelain skin, no horrible lacerations to remind Harry of what his thoughtless actions had nearly cost him. “Not so different,” Draco said, and Harry could feel it now: the racing
; instead, he said something stupid like, “Try not to forget everything over break,” and, “I’m not starting over from the beginning come next term.”
There he went again, talking to owls like a madman. And here Draco was, seeking him out, also like a madman.
A great wave of shame washed over him. He didn’t know what he’d expected, but it certainly hadn’t been to be shown up so eagerly and inexpertly, in the span of a breath. Still, there it was: even lascivious layabouts like Blaise and Pansy had dreams and ambitions—to some degree at least. They had

. “...You don’t seem half as pissed off as I’d have expected. Dare I hope you’ve finally learned to act your age?”
Draco’s eyes snapped up to meet his, steely grey and unamused. “That’s enough back-pedalling, Potter.”
He smashed his fist against the button for the Atrium when the lift finally came, face so hot he was surprised there wasn’t steam shooting out his ears. Harry-fucking-Potter had his life more together than Draco.
,” Draco proclaimed proudly, chest puffed out. “A nasty brute, as Potter tells it, but I’m pleased enough.”
“…What’s that?” he asked, more wary than curious, as if he feared it might explode like the poor bloke’s microwave from Ron’s story.
Draco squeezed tighter and thought he might be drawing blood. Good. “NO! No, no, uh, I just—” He grunted. “Just—please take it off. Please
let Teddy feel unloved, or let him grow up not knowing how great his parents were.” His tone carried the sound of someone speaking from experience, and Draco wondered, not for the first time, how much of the Harry Potter story was real, and how much was trumped-up fiction. But Potter wasn’t his friend, so he really didn’t care enough to ask.
Slowly, his eyes crawled from the chicken-scratch writing to the Gryffindor table, where Potter was stuffing his face with a bright yellow scramble. He must’ve felt Draco’s gaze on him, for his head snapped over just in time to catch Draco watching, and his brows lifted in a way that said

No, so pipe down and let’s find out what the caterpillar’s going to eat on Thursday.”—and another round of nappy changing (that Draco was content to let Potter handle all on his own), Tedward was finally put down for a nap, and Potter came plodding back into the sitting room, flopping onto the sofa next to Draco with a great sigh of relief.

can do, and…well…” He winced, eyes flicking up to meet Draco’s. “Well, Aurors generally work in pairs. They have partners, and Ron and I were ready to get in there, kick arse and take names and all that, but he’s not gonna be applying anymore, and you—”
Harry clutched his chest, as if struck a mortal blow. “I may need some reassurances of my own, in that case.”
?” Draco asked, scandalised, but managed to find a clean pair of slacks and button-down that didn’t make him look like he was off to his own funeral.
Draco’s kiss was bruising, and his hands, braced firmly at the base of Harry’s skull to hold him in place, felt like they might crush him if he struggled. Quite forgetting himself, Harry dropped the knife and melted into the kiss, pliant and languid, and his fingers skittered up and down Draco’s sides out of habit. He had the number of Draco’s ribs memorised by now.
. And more than you’ve got right now. And the pay’s decent, plus there’s benefits, and people would look up to you—”

Draco launched himself through the window—if for no other reason than to escape Potter’s effusive prattling—and beat his wings with great sweeping strokes in an effort to quickly gain altitude.
Whether acquiescing to Harry’s request he not cheat or simply because he didn’t feel he needed to, Draco refrained from transforming during the game, and while Harry narrowly beat him to the Snitch, it wasn’t enough to overcome Fred’s poor goal defence, resulting in victory for Draco’s team.
?” Harry prodded, collapsing back onto the pillows beside Draco and jabbing him in the side with an elbow.
He was in and out inside of fifteen minutes, being a simple man with simple tastes, and after slipping the little brown bag into his pocket, he rejoined Ron and Hermione at the twins’ shop.

It was by mere chance Draco noticed it. He’d taken, of late, to spending a few laps soaring around the castle after dinner to aid his digestion and quiet his thoughts. It was pleasant, really: the brisk night air ruffling his feathers, the sounds of all the inhuman nightlife scattered about the castle grounds, the twinkling dots of candles and lamplight in windows and bracketing doorways upon a sea of black. Things were ever so much simpler as an owl, and he found himself wondering, with a chill of foreboding, if any Animagus had ever been tempted to just…never turn back. To live out their life cocooned safe within an animal form, unbothered by the consequences of decisions—good and bad—made as a human.
Harry slid his own ring onto his right middle finger, where it sat cool and comfortably snug. “…Well, there’s a lot of meaning if I put it on you, I figure, and I don’t want to cheapen it.” He bobbed his head, ambivalent. “You know. If there ever came a time. Just, not saying that’s a
, Harry hadn’t thought about that. “We—that’s…we can do that?” He could feel his throat and chest flushing, mottled patches of red darkening his complexion. He didn’t have nearly enough experience under his belt to make an informed decision, and while the idea of a cock up his arse didn’t sound appealing on its face, there had to be something to it, right? Draco certainly didn’t seem like he relished pain, and yet here they were.
Realisation dawned then, and Draco straightened, swallowing thickly. “You’re…you’re the Weasley who was there when I…”
was his answer, right there. “Because we don’t get on,” he said instead, because simpler was always better with Potter.
As soon as the words had left his tongue, Draco felt the urge to physically reach out and snatch them back. As it was, he buttoned up, jaw snapping shut, and a strangled little whine of mortification died in his throat as Potter stood there, just blinking, dumbfounded and—for once—blessedly bereft of words.
Draco had never been able to ignore Potter before; why should he be surprised that now was no different?

Harry rolled his eyes with a chuckle. “God you’re such a spoilt prick.” He shook his head. “Seriously? There’s never been

Chasing the bad guys, being respected by the community, being…being the hero…” Maybe bouncing ideas off Draco hadn’t been such a good idea after all. “But after the last year…honestly, I just don’t know if I’ve got it in me. It feels like…like what people

“Remind me,” Draco said, their foreheads pressed together, and this close he was just a soft blur of light and dark and grey.
“You’ve always been older than me, and I’ve never shown you any respect before. Not about to start now.”
Draco perked up: Teddy? Was he finally going to get to meet the mysterious definitely-not-Potter’s-bastard-child Tedward?
With as close to a huffing sigh as he could manage, Draco shifted his weight to balance on one leg and held the other out, waiting.
He couldn’t remember the last time he’d pulled one over on Potter, not like this, and he was practically bouncing on the Slytherin bench in the Great Hall as he wolfed down his breakfast. Potter might withhold treats for a few days out of spite after this stunt, so he would need to ensure he ate proper portions as a human for a while.
he wanted an order put in, but he was capable of procuring his own owl treats, thank-you-very-much. In fact, he planned to do so on his very next trip to London, which was to take place just this afternoon.
The trunk containing the Quaffle, Snitch and Bludgers was trotted out, and as everyone began to take their positions, the Snitch was released, darting off into oblivion. The Bludgers would be next, and then the Quaffle tossed—but Draco really didn’t care about those. Well, he cared a
“Well,” Draco said, in a feeble attempt to collect himself. “There’s time now. To—and you’ve made me loathe this word—
“No,” he answered curtly, and it wasn’t a lie at all. They still had a good two months to go before they had to define this in any certain terms. He never had been and never
Harry winced; no, for all the teasing about being a ‘professional celebrity’, Draco wouldn’t have wanted to pursue such a ‘career’ any more than Harry. He liked working, liked feeling
me—all right, all right! I yield!” His resignation came just as Harry was preparing to Banish the tray back to the kitchen and convince Draco bodily to open his present, one hand already on Draco’s hip. “Don’t start something you aren’t prepared to finish,” Draco warned, eyes flicking down to Harry’s wayward hand. “We’re lunching with Mother and Father promptly at noon.”
Probation Officiate Wentsworth was, Draco supposed, a decent enough fellow, at least as far as Probation Officiates went. Older than Draco’s father even, he was a short, stout wizard, balding on top with hideous glasses that held lenses the size of tea saucers. Draco could
It was almost like back in late summer the year before, when he and Ron and Hermione had been stuck here. Except they weren’t living in fear for their lives anymore, and Draco was here now, so it was actually pretty nice. Grimmauld Place was a lot bigger than Perkins’ tent, even with its expanded interior, so they had all the room they might want to spread out. Plus, Kreacher had kept the place spotless, even after their abrupt departure, so while the decor still left something to be desired, it was as fine a place as any for four friends to share.
He’d fantasised for a bit after that, wondering what might have happened if he hadn’t let go—if Potter had Disapparated and necessarily taken Draco with him. He would have finally been
Still, something niggled at the back of Draco’s mind—a little worm he couldn’t shake. He frowned to himself. “…Tonks, you said was her name? The grandmother.”
Harry nodded encouragingly when Draco touched the knob, holding his breath as he pushed through. He’d only snagged a brief peek the night before, while Draco had been washing up, just to check it was ready. Hermione had shaken her head, fondly ruffling his hair, and told him
the field I would have seen you expressing any interest in entering after…well, after everything, but it’s sure to earn you a measure of esteem, and perhaps you’ll even be granted privileges for visitations with you father!” She swished in her long dress robes over to a table where the house-elves had set out a tea service, pouring herself a cup from the everwarm pot. “Naturally it would be horrid if they tried to put you in the field, but you’re very good with puzzles, so perhaps they could find a use for you behind the scenes, as it were? Rather than charging into battle, wand ready, where you might come to harm. Why, that sort of work might even be
“And did it? Did it happen?” Potter’s eyes drifted around the Owlery. “This is the best?” And Draco had nothing to say to that, so he didn’t. Potter sighed. “…You weren’t a very good Death Eater, you know.”
Fantastic. Because he hadn’t been humiliated enough for the afternoon. Potter whirled around at his friends’ summons, while Draco instinctively popped back into owl form and flitted into the shed’s rafters, hunkering low and cursing his moon-bright white plumage. Stealthy he was decidedly
.” A lash of flame snapped out, encircling the band and reducing it to a glob of molten metal that fell to the ground with a sizzling plop.
Mrs. Weasley ignored him, beaming at Draco. “Well, not to worry, we’ll get you sorted quickly enough.” She belatedly noticed Harry, who had stood quietly off to the side so Draco could get the mothering over and done with. It seemed to be his turn now, though, for she folded him into a hug half as frantic but twice as tight as Draco’s, clutching him to her breast and pressing a kiss onto his crown. “Oh Harry,
“I’ll meet you at the Weasleys’ shop for lunch,” Draco said, sending his dishes sailing into the sink. “I’m going to visit the Manor and let Mother and Father know of my plans to return to Hogwarts.”
…should be practised in matters such as this, or we’ll neither one of us enjoy it.” He gave another lazy roll of his hips, pulling a groan from Harry. “So until we’ve figured out just how we like it…let’s let the one getting it up the arse do the driving, shall we?”
“Oh, I reckon.” He took Draco’s wand, cast a quick Lubrication Charm, and then laid it to rest on its stand with his free hand while he slicked up his cock with the other. “Slide yours against mine.”
Harry’s heart was pounding a loud tattoo in his chest that he was sure Draco must be able to hear. There was a lot to unpack, but all that tumbled from his lips was, “That’s really not romantic.”
“Give it, I dunno, three days? Hermione’s leaving this evening, and Ron’ll have forgotten about you by then, so I can just say you got over your issues and flew back to Hogwarts.”
Potter shrugged. “You know as well as I that I won’t be the weirdest sight people see that day, and I’m sure I can think up an excuse to have you along.”
“As long as Draco reminds them to hold their tongues,” Ron grumbled, reaching for the evening edition of the
Ron ducked his head, full-on grinning now, and waved Harry off. “Enjoy your lizard boyfriend, if you must. Just don’t say we didn’t warn you.”

“Hm,” Draco said, pausing at the third-floor landing to throw a glance over his shoulder. “No regrets then, I take it?”
news, but he had to ease her into it gently, and he couldn’t do that with her standing there looking like a stiff breeze might send her to the floor. Good gad, she was going to faint dead away when he broke it to her—perhaps he ought to have her sitting down for this… “It’s…word on an apprenticeship, of sorts.”
“I didn’t think you’d actually spill inside me…” Draco tried to ease up onto his knees—but it was far too soon, and he collapsed back onto Harry’s cock with a satisfying squelch.
Potter’s shoulders slumped a bit, and he seemed to grow smaller, fitting back into his Potter-shaped shell instead of the visage of an avenging angel he adopted when he meant to see justice meted out. Draco wasn’t sure which Potter he preferred—the Boy Who Lived, or just the boy. “…I guess I can see that.” He wrinkled his nose. “…What made you go back at all? Why not give it up to the Ministry, after all the nasty shit that happened there? I mean, I get it’s your home, ancestral lands and all that, but…no offence, I always assumed you had, like, three other homes.”
He shot back out around the eastern side of the castle, dipping under another set of struts to enter the quad, where gaggles of students pointed at him—and Potter—in scandalised voices. He flared his wings to keep from slamming into the tall windows flanking the Hospital Wing, shooting up and over and relishing Potter’s loudly spat oaths as he narrowly avoided a quick trip to see Pomfrey himself.
it. You’re happier when you’re doing this thing, and you maybe accept that you deserve to be happy, even if it’s with something that other people probably wouldn’t like, or wouldn’t understand. So you say ‘what the hell’ and just go with it, because you’re tired of caring what other people think about what you should and shouldn’t do.” He fixed Draco with a look, all but daring him to try and look away. To be the first to break. “
agree…” Draco muttered, tearing into his pot pie with vigour. Weasley’s mother seemed partial to the kind of cuisine that stuck to the ribs, and Draco was living for it. He was going to be in a state three days from now when he had to go back to the house-elves and their pint-size portions.
Harry frowned. “…It’s really that bad?” There was flirtatious teasing, and then there was thoughtless cruelty; he’d never be able to forgive himself if he stumbled into the latter just because it got his cock hard. “Should we—” He didn’t want to say
Draco had swallowed, drawn himself up in the best imitation of his father in his prime he could muster, and lied through his teeth. “A well-rounded CV will be key to ensuring I can find a good foothold in…whatever is to come next, Sir. I’d like to have options. A leg-up, if you will.”
Draco was watching him, slumped against the table with his head supported in one hand, and he snickered softly, an amused smile curving his lips. “
Oh, so that was what those spells had been. Spells to stretch, spells to dull pain, probably even prophylactic spells.
The end of May soon rolled around, and Ron and Hermione showed up on the front steps on the 1st of June as promised, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Neither made any remark concerning Draco already being in residence, which was a small relief; Hermione had been the one to Side-Along Draco onto the property in the first place, so Harry supposed she had put two and two together easily enough, and Ron just seemed so thrilled to be out from under his mother’s hen-pecking he didn’t notice Regulus’s room had been given over to a new occupant.
Draco just stared at him, blank and helpless. “…But you know who I am. You know what I’ve done.” If Thomassen needed to see the Mark again, Draco was ready to show him, if it would get him out of this office all the sooner.
Draco had known it wouldn’t be easy making his way in life after Hogwarts. Inside that castle, he could still pretend at being a student, ignore the looming threat of adulthood and the responsibilities inherent therein. He could earn ten House points in Arithmancy, laugh at Potter’s shitty thesis statement, and reassure Pansy her new dress robes didn’t make her arse look fat, and that was a day well done for him. He could just be
“…Right, I’d better get back, or those two’ll come looking for me again. I know it goes against your very nature, but just try and keep a low profile for now? I’ll come back later, once everyone’s gone to bed.” He nodded to the open window. “You’re welcome to come and go as you please, but I’d refrain from roosting outside anywhere on the property, unless you want to get acquainted with Crookshanks again.”
“And I hope that includes you lot as well,” McGonagall said, just as Harry and the others were bidding their farewells after a sumptuous dinner in the Great Hall; Kreacher had made sure that Harry’s beloved treacle tart had been on the menu this evening, and he’d had half a mind to beg the old elf to come back to Grimmauld Place, Hermione’s probable protests be damned.

Potter glanced over his shoulder at the crowd passing by just on the other side of the Concealment Charm he’d thrown up to give them some privacy. The alleyway into which he’d ducked once his business in the Owl Emporium had been completed was by no means a glamorous place for a rendezvous, but Draco could at least transform back without fear of being caught out.

a Death Eater tromping about in their midst, free as a literal bird—“but I don’t see that it couldn’t be managed.”
But it wasn’t something that could be pushed—and judging from the book in her lap, she had her own way of coping. So Draco would continue coping as befit him too. “…I’m going to spend a few days at the Zabinis’. Blaise has invited me over—only for a short visit. I’ll be back before Christmas Eve, so you needn’t worry.”
Thomassen nodded at this, evidently satisfied with his response. “And how do you function when left to your own devices, then?”

Potter tossed the ruined jumper aside, then reached down to collect his discarded parchment and quill, sliding back onto the sill beside Draco. From his pocket, he extracted the purse of treats, placing it close enough that Draco could take nips whenever he so pleased. He so pleased right away, taking two at once.

Draco’s stomach sank, plummeting like he’d swallowed a lead nugget. His innards churned as his breakfast tried to claw its way back up from his gullet, and a cold sweat broke out over his forehead.
“Everything looks good on me, Harry, you should know that,” Draco said, then reached for his wand and began casting

“I’d say that’s as much for his good as for Teddy’s,” the woman laughed nervously, passing the baby over to Potter but keeping one eye on Draco. Where
Draco stamped one clawed foot squarely on Potter’s shitty essay—and then raked his talons through it, shredding the bottom-most few inches where Potter had
It was three weeks now since the final Leaving Feast Draco would ever have to attend. He was quit of Hogwarts at last, a free man with nothing more than a dodgy juvenile record to his name (and a troublesome ink blot on his arm). It hadn’t quite sunk in yet that, come September, for the first time in as long as he could remember he’d be somewhere
Potter gave a nod that was just this side of patronising. “Well… I mean, lots of us didn’t act the way we might usually during the war, so…” He shrugged. “I wasn’t going to judge.” He took another sip of his tea, then paused, brows knitting in confusion. “Wait, if you’ll be friends with the likes of

“I’m flattered, but taken.” He waved his fingers, flashing his ring. “Such a pity; I like you, too.”
Potter had the grace to look abashed, and he ducked his head, scrubbing weakly at his hair with a wince. “…Well, I’m not sure it would work anyway, not after Crabbe blew up the Room of Hidden Things, seeing as they shared a pocket dimension.”
Draco gave a low, raspy hiss when he drew within earshot, and Potter’s head snapped up, one hand raised to shield his eyes against the wan noonday sun. When he saw who’d just squawked at him, a smile broke over his features—oh what a different expression he’d be wearing once Draco rained faecal-fire down upon him—and he gave a stupid little wave, as if expecting Draco to wave back.
“I’m only saying: the Library’s warm, quiet, and the worst thing you’re going to smell in the stacks is Madam Pince’s hair spray.”
about to chance leaving the roosting room to hunt for mice or voles or maybe even some of the garden gnomes that surely populated the property when Potter appeared with a plate of leftovers from what looked to have been a sumptuous dinner.
He hopped down from his perch onto the floor, then executed a waddling turnabout to show Potter how very much an
“Er, yeah.” Harry reached for the salt. “Was good to see everyone again. Without, you know, impending doom hanging over all our heads.”
To distract himself, he checked Draco’s opinion as they turned in for the evening. “Have you thought any about what McGonagall said?”

With Andromeda returned, Potter excused them to return to the Burrow just in time for dinner. Weasley refused to leave Potter’s side once they got back, insistent they listen to a Cannons game on the Wireless together. Why someone who claimed to be a fan of the team would want to listen to them being soundly trounced in real time was beyond Draco, but Weasley was an odd duck who perhaps got off on humiliation. It would certainly explain a fair few things.

“Fuck yeah.” He released Draco, sliding his hands up Draco’s arm to settle at the nape of his neck and draw him down. “Humans have instincts
Draco slumped back in the chair, glaring at Thomassen, who seemed entirely too amused with the (well-deserved) strop Draco was throwing. “…And if I refuse? If I don’t
Draco slid a slender thigh between his own, bucking his hips gently so that Harry’s cock rubbed with agonisingly insufficient friction alongside Draco’s—enough to encourage the shaft to fill, just in case, but certainly not enough to finish the job. Quite the literal cocktease.
Draco did not want to ‘pop in’, but there was always the promise of more treats if he deigned to favour Potter with his presence, so another evening keeping Potter from tumbling out the window to his untimely (or was it overdue?) death it would be. It was certainly a more enjoyable way to pass the time than listening to Pansy and Blaise bicker back and forth about who was the more promiscuous, a fierce competition they’d been embroiled in since Third Year.
Harry glanced down at his Ministry badge, tapping it with a frown. “Well, this thing here says I’m the
“That—” Potter followed her gaze, forcing a smile and an unconvincing laugh. “Oh, that’s—that’s my new owl. I went to check Pig, like I said, when I heard a commotion outside, and I found Crookshanks attacking him. I guess he didn’t recognise him, seeing as I only just got him and all.”
Magical owls were, evidently, more capable creatures than Draco had given them credit for thus far, for the next day at breakfast, when the owls came through the Great Hall with the students’ morning post, a pair of Grey Owls flying in sync came swooping in, clutching between them a long, slender cylindrical package.

if they bothered to openly acknowledge it, naming themselves something as mundane as ‘boyfriends’ (and ‘mates’ was right out).

content to be quit of it, personally. I think I’ll find a nice little corner to keep myself to and give no one cause to look my way.” Potter might have a cavalier relationship with death, but Draco was certain that once it came for

the magic, at least.” He was certain he wasn’t getting his point across, and he could feel his frustration overtaking his arousal, wilting his cock. “It’s not…it’s not about the doing. For me. It’s—god, the whole thing’s meant to be an experience. Isn’t it?” It was why it had taken him so long to get to this point to begin with; he hadn’t been joking when he’d said he wanted to ‘savour’ it. What was the point in going to a ludicrously expensive restaurant for dinner, and then skipping the appetisers altogether? “Do whatever you need, really—just let me share it with you?”
lean into the owl thing and see just how much Potter would let him get away with all for the promise of a feathery companion to share a window sill with him on occasion. The Hogwarts grounds were
“Yeah, that’s what I thought,” Potter muttered—though he made sure not to turn his back to Draco, even as he shuffled from the Owlery after sending the Scops off on its delivery. “See you ‘round, tosser,” he said before he slipped out the door, showing Draco a couple of fingers (once more fresh and unbandaged; Draco would have to do something about that when the inevitable next time came around).
at the Floo announced a Fire Call from the Burrow several days later, just as the four of them were settling in at the kitchen table for breakfast. Mrs. Weasley poked her head through the eerie green flames, delivering morning greetings and news that several owls had just arrived bearing official-looking letters from Hogwarts. “There’s a few for us here at the Burrow, but there’s also one for you, Harry, as well as Ron and Hermione.” She peeked around Harry at Draco, smiling nervously. “Oh, I’m sorry—none of them seemed to be for you, dear.”

You can’t know how—” She choked herself up, shaking him like a rag doll, before she finally released him, holding him at arm’s length to get a good look at him. “Goodness, you’re skin and bones! Ronald Weasley, you haven’t been ‘losing’ the pies and casseroles I’ve been sending around, have you?”
“Well, with your name being what it is and that lovely ink on your arm, a lot of people are going to make inappropriate assumptions. So you can either change your name and start wearing long sleeves or grow a thicker skin about it. And then maybe start becoming something you
With each successive visit—now coming two to three times a week usually—Potter became more and more inured to Draco’s threats (toothless and otherwise), and somewhere around mid-October, he started showing up with of all things
Potter waved him down when it looked like Draco might chuck the mug of tea at him. “No, I just thought maybe they were all more…
While Draco had objected to his parents throwing any sort of affair for him at the Manor, he had been only too happy for Harry to organise something far more laid back at Grimmauld Place—which meant louder music, questionable drinks, and more games of Strip Exploding Snap. Pansy, Theo, Greg, and Millie showed up unfashionably early, which Harry suspected they had done on purpose, and dragged Draco off into the sitting room to shower him with gifts, with Harry, Hermione, and Ron pointedly not invited.
Potter was still standing there while Draco quietly had his mental crisis, blinking slowly like he’d just been kicked in the head by a Hippogriff. After a moment, he released a long, laboured breath, then in a choked voice, “…Were you? Flirting with me?”
But that would have been the coward’s way out, and perhaps he could scry for who sent it if it turned out to be something
The Dark Mark was still a nasty blotch on his skin, and Draco had to turn away from it. He’d stared at it enough over the summer holidays; he knew what it looked like. Thomassen reached over the desk and grabbed his wrist to tug him closer, studying the Mark with a frown before releasing Draco and leaning back again.
Draco swallowed, pressing his forehead to Harry’s. “…It’s not how I want to come, though.” He eased Harry’s hand away from stroking himself, then shifted on the mattress until his arse was hovering just over Harry’s groin—then bore down on Harry’s cock, rocking against him. His cock was trapped between his stomach and Draco’s arse, and it was
Draco just shrugged. “I can’t possibly lose any more esteem in the eyes of society than I already have—so if you’re bent on ruining your sterling reputation, then let it be on your head.”
He would wager Draco performed more physical labour in the next eight hours than he had in his entire life. When he tired of mixing mortar for the brick-layers and Scourgifying the flagstones in the corridors that had seen fighting, he shifted into the dragon and fired the forges for the metalwork and helped Hagrid haul loads of heavy stone from the Courtyard into the Great Hall to repair the sundered walls.
Two shakes turned out to be five minutes, and then the same woman from the painting, still eerily familiar to Draco’s eyes, though he couldn’t place why, came swanning out with an infant on her hip that she immediately pressed into Potter’s outstretched arms. “Thank you
, I can’t tell you how much…” She sighed, and Harry patted her arms. He’d known this was coming, but it didn’t make it any less uncomfortable.

Tedward burbled his unintelligible response around a toothless grin—and then in a flash, his hair went stark white-blond. Potter gave a panicked yelp, making a wild grab for the baby to draw him back into his arms. “Oh bollocks, look at his
Potter made some noises under his breath that were probably rude words, then crossed his arms over his chest, shrugging. “So? Is that all? If you just wanted to deck me quickly, I could’ve made myself available to you between classes.”
Draco wanted to swallow his tongue. It was difficult to tell if Potter had been deliberately attempting to goad him into that embarrassing slip, or if he was genuinely that thick and Draco had only given him too much credit. “I
Thomassen narrowed his eyes a tick, probably because he knew Draco was bullshitting him, but he didn’t call him on it, merely slapped the folder shut and placed it on his desk. Leaning back in his chair, he steepled his fingers and studied Draco closely. “Show me your arm.” Draco’s heart stopped. “Show me your arm,” Thomassen said again, more slowly but with ever so much more demand, and Draco licked his lips and quietly rolled up his sleeve. He didn’t need to be told which arm.

It was only, you weren’t allowed to miss people like Harry Potter when you were Draco Malfoy. You couldn’t say it out loud, even if you wanted to (and you definitely did
Draco was sober. “…Yes, I know.” He sighed loudly. “Why not just be a professional celebrity, then? Make your fortune giving speeches—signing babies and taking pictures with autographs.”
. Enough had changed in these past few years for Draco that it would have been nice to at least have hung on to this one tiny scrap of acrimonious constance, like an irritating comfort blanket.
Mrs. Weasley slipped three crisp envelopes through the connection, reminding them all she would expect them for Sunday dinner, and then closed the connection—just as Ron clomped back down the stairs, a bulging sack of clothes slung over one shoulder.

Harry rolled his eyes. “Come on, you’ve shared a home with several for the better part of the past year, and you’re still kicking.”
“Oh, I can’t be certain. I’m sure it’s nothing serious, though, or he would have sent a summons directly. This was only an inter-office memo.” He held the wrinkled crane up for Draco to see, but it was impossible to make out the writing. Damn useless human eyes.
. I picked my family.” He drew himself up tall, not at all ashamed. He wasn’t a coward. “We always pick each other.”
Animagecraft, Draco had learned through the course of his studies, was no different from any other branch of magic in this respect. It was perhaps a bit trickier to manage, requiring more dedication (or else desperation) to master than your average charm or jinx, and came with a whole
“One false move, and I’ll rip it off,” Draco warned, as if he could read Harry’s mind. He was still grimacing, and his lids fluttered open—his eyes were bright, like he was fighting back tears. “Shit, that was a bad idea.”
Well, he didn’t have one. That was it. It was just like Potter said: they worked best when one of them wasn’t speaking, whether because they weren’t human at all, or because they were focused on a task. When they dared try and have a conversation, it always went tits-up, so this was really all they could ever hope to have. A handful of weeks, a few months—and then quietly returning to their proper orbits, never to pass into each other’s spheres again for fear of destroying one another.
That soft, teasing smile Potter had been wearing twisted into a proper Harry Potter grin, and Draco wanted to roll his eyes right out the door. “Of course not. But let’s reassess in six months.” Then he got positively

Then Potter was on him, grabbing his shoulders and whirling him around to march him from the Hall. “What the

him like that. “And you couldn’t admit that back in the Great Hall because…?” He released a huff of laughter. “What, you just get off on taking the piss out of me?”
. God, he was never going to hear the end of it. It was hardly secret between them they’d always been a bit—all right, a
He slumped in place on his perch, awkwardly trying to work a talon between the band and his leg to tug it off, and Potter winced. “Ah—no, c’mon, don’t do that…”
“You think I don’t know that?” Potter said, with a manic sort of laughter, and he threw his hands up. “I’ve been used to some end or another for most of my life. Been betrayed more times than anyone ought to be by my age—sometimes by people I didn’t know. Too often by people I
Draco stared at him for a beat, boggling as Potter’s words really set in—along with his poorly disguised intentions. Subtlety was
Potter, to his credit, went pale and looked a bit queasy as he nodded, quickly and sharply. “…Yeah, yeah I suppose you wouldn’t. Sorry, wasn’t thinking…” Draco didn’t know why

Thomassen leaned way over his desk, far enough he could peer down at Draco, who hopped back up into the seat he’d just vacated and waited for further instruction. Thomassen only
he was—and Draco was on the ‘take as few classes as necessary to stay enrolled and try not to piss anyone off’ track. Between schedules that kept them out of each other’s lives (and fields of view) and the fact that House alignments were as strong as ever, the bonds forged in the war weakening once again as everyone returned to their proper corners, Draco didn’t really have to interact with Potter at all as a human.
He could feel Draco staring at him in the darkness, and then reaching over, gently tilting Harry’s head to face him. Draco lifted up onto his elbows, leaning forward to move his lips over Harry’s, and together they melted. Harry snaked an arm around Draco, drawing them chest to chest, and imagined he could feel the roaring inferno swirling within Draco as a real, physical heat, letting it sear him and reduce him to ash.
be Potter’s friend, whatever the outcome. He wasn’t built for it. He just wasn’t. He ran a tongue over his teeth, huffing. “…I need to go. Apparently.” He slipped back around the couch, taking the long way out of the room to keep as much space between himself and his mother as possible. He paused, though, at the threshold, because it felt too much like fleeing. “We’ll discuss this more when I return.” Yes, that sounded better. Almost like something his father would have said, and though he in no way wanted to follow in Lucius Malfoy’s footsteps, the man had certainly known how to hold himself.
won’t help,” Draco said, tone one of dangerous calm that he hoped sounded threatening. It was difficult to intimidate Potter these days. Slaying Dark Lords tended to go to one’s head.
Draco grunted to himself. “…Good to see you’ve got some sense, then.” Potter let a beat pass, giving Draco a
Draco frowned, because now Potter didn’t sound like he was speaking from blind faith—but from sure knowledge. “…How do you know that?”
Draco only chuckled darkly—then thrust his hips forward, his own cock bouncing merrily, and positioned Harry’s cock straight up, just under the shadow of his arse cleft.
but he hated the Owlery as a human. It reeked, you always came out covered in down or birdshit or both, and these days it felt like all the owls were watching him. They’d always given him a wide berth before, sensing he wasn’t quite one of them, but now when their eyes fell on him he sensed sneering judgement in their gazes, as if they’d read the
, with several phrases throughout the text scripted in by hand. “‘I, [Harry James Potter], do hereby take on sole responsibility for the actions—including damage to persons or property—of my [Dragon / sp. Antipodean Opaleye], forthwith, on this the [21st of June, 1998]. I understand that, should I fail to maintain sound control of this animal, which I have been made aware is a Class [5] Dangerous Creature, all legal repercussions will be borne by—’” Harry shook his head, baffled. “I’m sorry,

Potter glanced around the room, then down at the mugs of tea they were holding. “…Right, of course not,” he deadpanned.
“…Merlin you’re such a soft touch,” Draco mumbled, though his voice was thick with emotion. He shook his head, leaning forward and sliding his hands up over Harry’s chest, curling at his neck. “Of course,” he whispered, close enough to kiss. “Fuck, of course—I’m sorry, I was only—”
Once Pig had worked his way through his pile of treats, he hopped onto Draco’s desk and began to do a funny little dance, clearly waiting for Draco to entrust him with a letter in return. “No return post,” Draco said, and Pig seemed to wilt. “Well you evidently won’t shit on him for me, so what else can I possibly ask?” He leaned in close and said, conspiratorially, “He told
“…Why?” he asked, very small and a little bit petulant too, unable to keep the whine from seeping into his words. “Why won’t you leave this be? Why insist so? You’ll have your gang of Gryffindors traipsing about after you every step of the way, right through earning those horrid scarlet robes—they’ll look terrible on you, just so you know. Even without your Weasley by your side, you’ll have friends and compatriots aplenty, all just as eager as you to throw themselves in front of a panoply of curses and hexes and jinxes for glory. Even
“But I never wanted you in Azkaban, or shunned from the public eye for life or anything like that. Because I know what you did in the war. And I know what you didn’t do as well. That’s something not a lot of people outside your immediate family can say, I reckon.” He took a step toward Draco but kept well out of leg-sweeping range. Potter was a quick study, whether he was faced with an owl with pinpoint shitting accuracy or a humiliated pure-blood who’d been spending his free time reading too many books about how monastic wizards in Tibet channelled their magic for use in hand-to-hand combat. “You deserve better than this—better than probation and a bunch of doors slamming in your face. It’d be a monumental waste, you just fucking off after graduation, never to be seen or heard from again. And maybe it’ll make me sound full of myself, but given what we’ve been through, I reckon you ought to value my opinion over a bunch of randos on the street.”
from the communal porridge bowl where it had been dropped by a delivery owl passing overhead. She waved her wand over the soaking wet paper, Vanishing the goopy mess with a pinched scowl.

take it off, I think I should let my friend get him rebanded when he’s ready. Really that’s—just please—” He slapped down a coin purse on the countertop, and Draco knew the sound of a hefty amount of Galleons when he heard it. “
Dinner was, as expected, delicious, with the elves in the kitchen having quite outdone themselves. Tucking in, Harry couldn’t help but recall each and every one of the meals he’d shared at this table with friends—and now more than friends—and a knot that had taken root in his chest the moment they had walked through the sturdy wooden doors fronting the Entrance Hall began to grow, throbbing painfully, because god,
They drank deep to Zabini’s memory—and even knocked back a shot to Crabbe’s—and a few drams later, Goyle was blubbering an apology and confessing he’d hid in the Hufflepuff Common room when he’d roused after Harry and Draco had saved him from the Fiendfyre, as the entrance had been left open, perhaps by students hoping others might find sanctuary within. “Didn’ even fight, I didn’ want to… Just wanted to be a part of somethin’…”
Potter kicked him lightly in the shin. “Well you’ve gotta get ‘em started early if you want to make good fliers out of them.”
, crushing his slight form with its weight, claws digging and swiping and needle-like teeth snapping in his face. Instinct took over—the owl’s or the human’s, he couldn’t tell—and he began flailing and flapping, talons raking but only catching air, finding no purchase, and when he opened his mouth to scream, all that came out was the owl’s awful, rasping hiss. Jaws clamped onto his throat, pressing and holding until his lungs burned for want of air and the screeching hiss began to fade—
“You don’t want me to see your cock—so you’re going to punish me, by showing me your cock. Such elegant Gryffindor logic.”
. He didn’t want to rely on others, but being relied upon himself seemed to suit him just fine. Or perhaps this was more dragon stuff, like ‘providing for his mate’ or some such rubbish.
Dinner was quite the most filling thing Harry had had in months, and he sorely regretted taking so long to start reaching out to his friends and family again, mending ties the war had strained. He resolved to start dropping by on a much more regular basis; after all, Draco would never be able to be himself around Harry’s friends without frequent exposure.
being an owl—only that over the past few months, and the past few days in particular, he’d gotten used to it. Was that dangerous, he wondered? It had to be, didn’t it?
“Now here’s a question,” Ron said, doing his own fair share of ogling. “What’s faster—your Firebolt, or Draco?”
Potter took a step back, then seemed to find his Gryffindor courage and squared his shoulders, straightening. “
shall have a miserable time without you.” He hooked a finger into the collar of Harry’s shirt, drawing him closer. “The sooner we let my parents celebrate me, the sooner we can come back and have a proper do.” He turned the box over in his hands, carefully untying the ribbon wrapping it. Inside, he found another, smaller box, fashioned from wood, and when he undid the clasp, it popped open to reveal a shining, golden Snitch.
, and held out his arm, wrapped once more in the hideous red knitted jumper. “C’mon, so you don’t break your neck getting in.”
Draco lashed out with a sweeping kick, but Potter was evidently learning and nimbly leapt over it, bumping his shoulder against Draco’s as they mounted the steps and made their way to the kitchens.
And Blaise just gave him a sidelong look, declining to tease any further on the point. He knew as well as Draco what the past year had been like—how perhaps the most dangerous place in the wizarding world to be had been the Manor, Dark Mark or no. “…So, where did you go, then, if not here—where you would have been perfectly welcome to visit had you shown up and rung the front bell like a
And of course he was going to make this difficult. But no, this was salvageable, Potter was stupider than a bag of Gobstones, and Draco huffed in exaggerated exasperation, “Good gad, Potter, it was
“Arsehole.” He bumped shoulders with Harry, and they headed back to the Quidditch shed to return the broom. “…It crept up on me,” he said with a worried frown, leaning against the door jamb while Harry locked up. “I thought—I thought I was over this. It hasn’t been…a
After lunch—and a few more drinks than they probably should have enjoyed, given it wasn’t even yet two in the afternoon—they did a bit of window-shopping, and Harry managed to purchase most of his school supplies.
He’d been ashamed as he’d accepted it, knowing in his heart of hearts that Potter hadn’t stolen his wand from him. He’d let it go. Not consciously—he hadn’t been stupid enough to leave that for the Dark Lord to root out of his mind—but still, his fingers had loosened and his grip weakened, and then Potter had taken it and fled. Gone in a whirl of magic, off to parts unknown.
Potter gave him a funny look, like he thought this was a trick question. Maybe it was. “To help me study, obviously. Think we’ve done this enough times you can tell I need all the help I can get.”
He pursed his lips tightly at the crown, drawing the head in agonisingly slowly and tonguing the slit before lifting off again. He used his hand to spread the viscous lubricant from Harry’s Charm along the shaft—and Harry wondered what it tasted like. They were going about this entirely in the wrong order, but Harry didn’t want to say as such, lest Draco think better of sucking him off.
“Not as thrilled with their lengthy holiday down under as you might have hoped?” Harry asked, offering a sympathetic smile.
. No, no that wasn’t happening. Talking to Potter was a dangerous business, just begging for trouble. It had only ever brought Draco headaches, so why on
A click and a rattle sounded from inside the telephone apparatus, and shortly two square, silver badges came sliding out of the coin return. Harry’s read
, vowing swift and unflinching retribution on whoever the culprit might be. His spoons had behaved ever since.

He tried to bring it up casually in bed that night, taking Draco’s temperature on the matter. “Would you…would you be okay if I told Ron’s mum and dad? About—y’know. About us?”
He could see the West Tower now, and the Owlery sat atop it, with owls swooping in and out. He began flapping frantically for the nearest open window—
Draco opened his wings, tail wiggling as he prepared to launch himself and snatch those delicious little nuggets right from Potter’s hand—when Potter yelped, “Wait—
“…If it makes any difference,” Potter said, rudely interrupting Draco’s self-flagellation, “I don’t hate that you’re here. A heads-up would have been appreciated so I could’ve come up with a convincing story, but…I mean, it’s not like you’ve ruined my holiday.” He flashed a smile that was too bright by half for Draco at the moment. “Especially seeing as you’ll be spending most of your visit not being able to talk.” Draco showed him two fingers. “And you won’t be able to do that either.”
“Oh, well that’s very good then!” she said, nerves still heavy on her breath as her hand went to her neck to tug at the string of pearls there. “What sort of an apprenticeship?”
considering just tearing off out the door and flying back home. It was only the recognition that he’d be humiliated even
“Robards?” Potter frowned, nose wrinkling. “The Head Auror?” Draco nodded. “…Never. I’ve never spoken to him.”
His bladder made itself known with urgency, so he carefully slid out of bed, making sure he didn’t disturb his partner, and stumbled into the bathroom. He winced as he waddled, sorer than he had expected, considering he’d done relatively little of the hard work the previous night.
do I have to—” he started, then cut himself off. His shoulders tensed. “It’s not as if it’s a secret!”
But ‘weird’ wasn’t the worst quality in the world, nor was Potter being weird any great shock. It was just another one of those foibles Draco was learning about, tearing aside the perfect facade others saw in Potter and exposing him for the ridiculous wanker he was underneath.
Luna gave him a lovely potted plant she claimed to have come across when browsing the open-air gardens of Thistlebaum’s Horticultural Haven, saying, “It just called to me, hoping I would find it a new home where it could really put down roots.” Charlie had gone scarlet and tugged Harry aside later, explaining in a quick, quiet murmur that the plant grew wild in Romania at certain times of year and was commonly used to bring hen dragons into heat, driving the males wild with lust, and so he should be
“Why am I even here, Potter?” he asked, because since he couldn’t answer the question himself, perhaps Potter could. He claimed Draco was an open book, easy enough to read, after all.
mean you want more than to just sit alone in a nice cave in the Bavarian Alps for the rest of your days.” His tone waxed earnest, too much so for comfort. “I want that for you too.” He gave a little half-shrug with a crooked smile. “…It’d be nice to see you again after all this, outside of standing over your freshly murdered corpse.”
, so what had been meant to be a welcome finale to years of education wasted on parlour tricks and outright hogwash had instead turned into a year-long siege under the thumb of Death Eaters so foul a Dementor would’ve spat their soul back out.
Potter stared up at him, and Draco appreciated those precious few inches of difference in their heights; it wasn’t much, but it helped. “That’s what happens when you don’t pick a side at all. You’re left with nothing to hope for. Nothing to work for. I thought you Slytherins were supposed to be cunning or something. You ought to know by now that if you want your side to win, you’ve got to commit to it. You can’t do things like lie to your loony aunt’s face when I’m sitting in your parlour, or hold your goons back from finishing what Voldemort started. You can’t do the bare minimum and just hope for the best.”
Potter stared at him for a long, uncomfortable beat, then hung his head, nodding. “…I guess loyalty’s a pretty fine quality to have. My family’s mostly shit, so I can’t really relate.”
Alas, though, it seemed no such luck. Besides, after going on two weeks, Potter couldn’t have missed the news even if he’d wanted to. If nothing else, Weasley would’ve made
Draco’s nostrils flared, and his jaw tensed as he stared down at the rings, and if looks could kill, the bands would have been reduced to ash then and there. “Why are you giving me a

was Potter getting it into his head to write a tell-all corroborating the public’s worst fears, detailing at length the heinous acts and mischief managed by Draco using his Animagus form.

idea now. Really just absolutely terrible, but Potter had started it. Stupid snap decisions were not the sole purview of Gryffindors—and Draco had never been one to sit idly by and let Potter best him at
He was clearly not getting back to his nap so long as this interloper was hanging around, so he spread his wings and leapt from the tower, gliding around the property until he found his bedroom window, reluctantly left open on days he roosted in the belfry. His mother had complained about a draught, but he’d only told her to stoke the fires higher, in no mood to explain why he was whiling away his winter break in quiet solitude underneath a layer of feathers and down.
. Nothing of note had really changed, he supposed, except this was finally something they were doing now: sleeping together. Not just sharing a bed, but sharing their bodies in it, in every way he could think possible—and he knew Draco would tease him for the goofy smile he was wearing, just remembering what they’d done, so he took care to wipe it off before he returned to the bedroom.
When he’d nearly emptied the room of all its furnishings save a handsome bookcase of mahogany (probably stuffed full of texts on the Dark Arts) and Regulus’s writing desk, Harry wondered aloud, “Won’t your parents
you,” Harry corrected. “You’ll wear one, and I’ll wear one, and no one has to know what they mean but us, if you don’t want.”
Thomassen nodded to the seat in front of his desk, and after shutting the door—and finally blocking out all the curious glances thrown his way—Draco shuffled his way over and gingerly settled in. He prayed he wouldn’t be asked too many questions, because his stomach was still feeling out of sorts, and he didn’t want to ruin what looked like important case-related paperwork covering Thomassen’s desk.
He hadn’t let himself really think about the future in what felt like forever—first because he hadn’t thought he’d survive to adulthood, and now because it was so much easier to focus on the
Not in person, of course—unlike Potter, he didn’t have a death wish—but they had an understanding, so under cover of night, he poked his head out of the Dungeon, checked to be sure he wasn’t liable to be jumped the minute he showed his face outside of his House, and made his way to the Owlery, where one quick transformation had him winging his way to Gryffindor Tower.
much sharing between them. Charmwork only went so far, especially when both parties were otherwise indisposed.
“Well, you’re free to sign on to take them, even without having completed the coursework. You’ll only be expected to have done a bit of self-study if you hope to pass, that’s all.” He closed the folio, leaning across his desk to fix Draco with an expression bordering discomfitingly on pity. “Have you given any thought as to what you’d like to do once you’ve graduated and your probation’s up? You’ll be free to travel as you please, of course—but there’s plenty of work to be had or higher education to pursue here in Britain.”
After dinner, they bid their goodnights and returned to their rooms to get ready for bed. For Harry and Draco, there was no repeat of the previous night—nor anything similar, in part because their housemates were in residence and in part because Draco still seemed a bit sore, wincing when he took a seat or rose to his feet. It had sent a guilty little thrill through Harry every time it happened, and he’d worked very hard to keep it from showing on his features, but he wasn’t sure how successful he’d been. No, Draco would certainly let him know when he was ready for another round.
“I broke my wrist climbing that tree when I was seven—and I tried to go swimming in that pond when I was ten until I found out the hard way it was infested with leeches. Father commissioned a private Quidditch pitch for me, just between those hills…” He whirled around, shaking his head with an utterly baffled expression on his face, as if he couldn’t believe his eyes. “You’re mad.”
“Well, in lots of stuff, really. Not just Charms,” Potter clarified when Draco came calling at his window that evening. The rest of his roommates were downstairs caught up in a riveting game of Exploding Snap that evidently involved a few side bets—as if Weasley had any Knuts to spare—so they had a bit of privacy for the moment. Potter cast a long look at his trunk—which looked brand new and not like it had survived six-plus years being toted to and from Scotland—and sighed. “N.E.W.T.s are gonna be here sooner than I’d like, and Hermione can really only handle helping one of us at a time. Them being together, it seemed only fair I let Ron have at her, and honestly I’d rather not get in the middle of all…
Perhaps she might have been more eager to mould his young mind had he been forthright in explaining his reasons for pursuing Animagecraft in the first place—but it was best for the both of them that she assumed he meant to use such magics to mischievous ends…rather than to simply escape this ridiculous, stupid war. Really, how was the Dark Lord going to find him if he turned into a field mouse and scampered into a crack in the castle walls? Or a sea snake and went to live with the Merfolk in the Black Lake? It was hardly the noblest of ways to ride out the war—but no one would ever accuse him of being a Gryffindor.
Draco took the head in his mouth again, swirling his tongue around the crown, and then bobbed down, far enough Harry could feel the tip brush against the back of Draco’s throat. Draco’s jaw worked, and Harry could tell he was trying to take him in deeper—but in all their fumblings, neither had ever really managed more than just a mouthful.
Potter would invariably spot him watching on such occasions (a big white Barn Owl was difficult to miss, admittedly), but instead of ignoring Draco and focusing on the game—rather, on the Snitch he was meant to be catching—he would hover there, a hundred feet up, waving stupidly at Draco as if they were best mates. The others on the pitch probably thought he was going mad, acting so chummy with a bird; Draco didn’t disagree with them. Potter was
Draco felt that one, gasping, and he straightened. He leaned back, hands on the mattress now, supporting his weight, and he eased up onto his knees to give Harry more room to work. Harry took this as permission and decided it was time to get around to the
“You’ll get too fat to get yourself off the ground, you know,” Draco warned, stroking the tuft of feathers over his beak, and Pig’s eyes fluttered shut in bliss. He turned back to read the letter again, lips twisting into a scowl. Potter had certainly taken his
Draco’s body seized, going stiff as a board, and try as he might to wrestle his muscles back under conscious control, Potter’s spell held fast. From the corner of his eye, he could see Potter approaching, squinting to make out his attacker in the dim lamplight. He held himself with a wary caution, wand still trained on Draco, and it was only when he’d gotten within a few feet—good

forward gift and maybe leapfrogging several relationship milestones?” Draco fixed him with a sharp look, but he didn’t say anything, so Harry was going to count that as a win. “They’re…um, okay how can I put this without…” He shrugged, deciding to just go all-in with it. “They’re—
Harry shook his head in amusement. “Fine, be mysterious if you like. But I’d still like to drop in today if you lot don’t have any plans.”
Draco carefully collected himself, being completely, baldly honest when he said, “I’m not—we aren’t friends.”
Meanwhile, Draco was sitting here wallowing, his greatest goal in life at the moment to lie low enough to survive to his next birthday.
solutely not! Why on earth would you think such a thing?” He could hear the heat in her voice, and it was touching—they might’ve made a fine pair if he’d at all been enamoured of female favours and if she hadn’t been so devoted to throwing off the shackles of tradition.
“Everything all right at the Ministry, Mr Malfoy?” McGonagall asked, glancing up from her marking to see what Draco supposed must be a rather nasty frown on his features. He could have curdled milk with a glance.
Potter earned several confused looks when he toddled out of the roost room with Draco perched on his shoulder, though one of Weasley’s half a dozen brothers had his head buried in the morning edition of the
Harry wondered, as before, what life might have been like if things had gone just a little different. If not just Draco had been his friend, but Pansy and Theo and Greg and Millie too. He didn’t want to be a Slytherin—he loved those glorious red and gold banners and his lion-hearted friends. He just

pill. I know that better than anyone. But I don’t hate you.” Potter’s lips did something funny, like they wanted to say something but he wasn’t letting them. “To be honest, you never really mattered enough to me
Well too fucking bad. Because he wasn’t going to beg—and he also wasn’t going to sit idly by and let people take potshots at him and what was left of his family. There was keeping his head down, and there was hiding; the former was smart, and he was getting

He continued to follow the Scops as it took a long loop around the house, until it spotted an open window around the back and tucked its wings into a dive. Draco banked his lift, drifting down at a safe distance, and where the Scops zipped through the window, Draco instead chose a branch from one of the trees surrounding the property on which to alight.
“I assure you, Mr. Malfoy, there’s nothing untoward about these evaluations. We ask all Animagi to complete them, and once you’ve demonstrated satisfactory marks, everything will be settled and you may go on about your day. And Mr. Potter is, of course, welcome to join us—in fact, I must insist.”
He began whisking the eggs and sugar together, stealing glances at Hermione and Ron out of the corner of his eye. “…You’re sure you two are okay with this?”
His blood was thrumming in his ears, and his heart was a frantic, spasming mess in his chest. He hoped his father
was nothing he wanted any part of. He munched on a treat that tasted like Raspberry Liver and Onions—a less-than-successful flavour, he made a mental note—and wondered how Potter had managed to make it into any N.E.W.T-level classes at all if this was how he approached his schoolwork. Rank favouritism, that was what it was. “How about…Snitch? Since you seem to like Quidditch.”
No, he clearly hadn’t thought, despite their frequent sniping arguments about the old Black property Potter was attempting to wrest back into his grasp. Draco reached over to snatch up young Tedward, which Potter shockingly allowed without a fuss. He held the baby out at arm’s length, studying him with pinched lips. Yes, yes now that he looked he could see those stately Black features and carriage—good genes stood the test of time and poor breeding.
It was only difficult to maintain a healthy disdain for Potter, was all, when one was being reminded on an almost daily basis that he could be stupid in a sort of silly way in addition to his usual infuriating way. That he Vanished foods he didn’t like from his plate when Granger wasn’t looking. That he had ever so many of the same flaws Draco did and was thus just as human and fallible. Just as touchable.
Weasley’s mother, a round, apple-cheeked woman who clearly thought of Potter as one of her own brood, seemed delighted with Potter’s new ‘pet’, hastily wiping her hands on her apron when he entered the kitchen with Draco on his arm. She bustled over and cooed at Draco warmly, calling him a
Potter just stood there, slumped against the tower with a drunken sort of cock-eyed grin on his lips. “Come on, it’s still a passing grade. I was only being honest, after all. We aren’t friends, so I’m sure you wouldn’t want me coddling you.” Draco shoved away with a rough, gruff
“I don’t know what I want to do with my life. I was lucky enough to scrape by with a second chance, a final year here, and I’ve squandered half of it wallowing in self-pity. I no longer care much for what my father might think of me, but I know well enough he’d be disgusted with what I’ve let myself become…and I share the sentiment. All I’m asking…is for the chance to set myself arights. I won’t ask for any tutoring or extra time to prepare or anything of the sort—I just…” He tried biting back the words, but they came anyway. “…There are people I don’t want to disappoint. People who still think I’m worth something. So with your permission, ma’am.”
Potter tapped his chin, thinking. “…Pretty sure Neville’s working there some evenings for his thesis, but I can ask after his schedule, find out which days he won’t be there. And if I run it past Sprout, we won’t be disturbed at least.” He nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, that could be good.” He gave Draco a superior look. “See? Now was that so hard?”
, but not so tight he slipped away. Draco’s expression was tense, and Harry imagined he could smell the sweat, the nerves, of this step, this grand moment, as if everything were about to change. Which was ridiculous, but there it was all the same.
love-child. And don’t be ridiculous, he’s all of eight months old. He’s not going to remember you let alone recognise you.”
“…If you don’t want to be here, you don’t have to be.” Potter met his eyes, sharp and green and certain. “And you know that. Which means you want to be here, so maybe let’s stop playing stupid, since we know neither one of us
As soon as they ducked through the Floo returning home, Draco launched himself from Potter’s shoulder and made a beeline for the roost room, impatiently waiting for Potter to join him so he could get this
Hermione, predictably, bought him a book—one filled with sumptuous dessert recipes. Draco, legs thrown over Harry’s lap, was quick to point out the tabbed pages. “I’ve already highlighted my favourites, so get to practising.”
“It’s like she thinks if she takes her eye off me for two seconds, I’m gonna run off looking for more Horcruxes!” he groused over dinner their first evening back together. Draco had insisted on ‘cooking’, so it was Aunt Bessie’s steak pies all around. “I think she wouldn’t even let Ginny go back to Hogwarts if she had her way!” He shovelled a bit into his mouth, swallowing around a gulp of pumpkin juice. “I’m about at my wits’ end; June couldn’t come soon enough.” He slammed his glass back down with a contented sigh. “I’m officially changing my allegiance to the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black!”
A wanker who, it turned out, liked to teeter halfway out of windows in tall towers while he did his homework.
He swallowed thickly, then squared his jaw. “…That won’t happen,” he said, and he sounded so sober and serious that Draco almost wanted to believe him. But that was just the Boy Saviour in him. That ineffable quality that made people want to believe him capable of silly, impossible things, despite themselves. More fantasy.
, and then I stupidly mentioned I might be in the market for a partner because somehow I forgot we weren’t
Harry didn’t quite know how he was expected to be able to control his morning wood—especially if he woke particularly randy. Draco could sleep like the dead if he’d exerted himself the day before, and the thought of having to lie there, hard and wanting, for
Draco raised a brow, rolling up his sleeves; he’d still insisted on wearing a button-down with a waistcoat, the stuck-up prick. “…One wonders what could possibly get you off
After much trial and error and several stubbed toes, they finally reached the window sill, and Potter set him down with one hand while he reached to unlatch the window with the other. “I wish I could say it’s been fun—but I’ve got a goose egg on the back of my head that would argue otherwise.” He unthinkingly reached out and scritched Draco right under the ruff of feathers ringing his face, as if he were a proper owl and not only hiding in this form for reasons. Wanker. “G’night, Alabastard.”
Draco clenched his fists, driven to physically knock some sense into him. “Just because you’ve got the Minister for Magic at your beck and call, ready to indulge whatever whim strikes you, doesn’t give you the right to dick with other people’s lives—”
He fished the potatoes out from the pantry and gave them a good rinse before going through the kitchen drawers in search of a peeler. When he came up empty, he supposed he’d been meant to use magic for the task (he really needed to learn that Peeling Charm) and instead grabbed a paring knife to get to work.
It was as good a site as any for an after-curfew duel, Draco figured. Warded against spellfire damage and soundproofed to boot, there was little chance of them being disturbed while they worked through their issues. Issues that included reacquainting Draco with the sound of Potter’s nose crunching as he laid into it.
He’d spent so long seeking attention, now that Potter was offering it so sweetly, so casually, it was overwhelming.
Draco tapped Harry’s hand, where it was still settled on his hip. “You might just.” He shoved the hand away, rolling out of bed and sending the tray back down to the kitchen with a flick of his wand. “Step lively, Potter.”
that all the Aurors in residence were presently marking him and plotting ways to entrap him so he could rot in a cell alongside his father where he ought to be. He kept his head down, taking great care not to make eye contact with any of them, until the witch stopped short in front of a door bearing a plate that read
It wasn’t like they were wedding bands, after all; Harry had even gone out of his way to avoid gold.
Harry’s hips and back and stomach were protesting loudly, but he pushed through, too near the edge to stop now. “Come with me, Draco. I want to—I need to—”
insufferable had to have been a Weasley, or Weasley-adjacent at least. The owl melted under his attentions, and he rolled his eyes, then turned his focus to the letter, which was—predictably, because Weasley certainly wasn’t going to be writing him—from Potter.
For one, Draco didn’t have to do anything beyond make a show of flying off (after extracting promises of ample compensation for his trouble), wait long enough for Potter to leave, and pass off the delivery to Xerxes, who of course got a cut of the ‘profits’.
But it did expand, growing along with his ballooning form, until he’d drawn up to his full human height and it now sat comfortably about his ankle, a gleaming silver monstrosity with
“I’m going to get off—you’re going to get me off, and it’s going to be raw and hot and hard either way.” He quirked his lips. “…Or both ways.”
Draco jumped, he was certain, a good three feet in the air, whirling around with one hand already reaching for his wand while the other was raised in what he imagined to be self-defence but what probably looked to be an offer of forfeit. He couldn’t go five
“Ooh, wai’!” Ron said, mouth full of toast as he scrambled to his feet. He swallowed with some difficulty. “I’ve got a load of dirty washing I’ve been meaning to bring home—”
After nearly three weeks cooped up inside Grimmauld Place, though, they were beginning to run out of ways to entertain themselves—which really was saying something. With Diagon Alley likely to be recovering from the ravages of the war for months, and Harry wary of going anywhere near Gringotts these days, there was little else to do except mess about in bed, but Harry was quickly learning there was such thing as too much of a good thing.
Draco didn’t feel the need to elaborate any further, and Blaise didn’t prod. He was a better partner for conversation than Pansy like that. She would have put him on the rack until he cracked and told her every sordid detail, from his infant cousin to the bundle of contraband he’d hauled home to the lovely silver jewellery clapped round his ankle. Blaise was content to just enjoy a fellow aesthete’s company.
.” He slid down further and rolled his hips, dragging his cock up alongside Harry’s. “There they are.”
They were so exhausted by day’s end, they collapsed into bed back at Grimmauld Place and actually went to sleep—though Harry roused in the wee hours of the morning to hold up his end of their bargain, which seemed to suit Draco just fine.
He rejoined their kiss, having nothing more to say but still so much more to express, and eased Draco’s briefs down until he could palm his cock, tugging with a ruthless languidity. He’d neglected to put up any Silencing Charms and didn’t want to waste the breath to do so now, but he was still conscious of Ron and Hermione sleeping only one floor below. Draco fumbled with the ties to his bottoms to get his hand on Harry’s cock and rushed to catch up. They lost themselves in the warm, close darkness, biting back breathy sighs and swallowing moans until they came with silent screams.
something. And it probably always would. Like the Mark on his arm, he’d never be rid of this urge to prove to Potter he wasn’t the snivelling little weasel he somehow always made himself out to be.
No shop owner, Knockturn-based or otherwise, would want to put up with that sort of heat being brought down upon their heads.
Draco ran his eyes over the parchment once more, hoping that perhaps on a third pass it would say something different. No such luck—curse his
God, Harry loved him. As much as he’d ever loathed him, he fucking loved Draco now. He was funny and sexy and stubborn and proud, and everything that drove Harry mad about him drove him wild as well. Dragonflame roaring beneath a prickly, icy exterior—and he wanted to share it with
“Oh, leave off,” Potter snorted, grabbing their chairs and toting them back to the little shed near the doors to the Greenhouse. “I
She knocked on the door and announced, far more loudly than necessary, that ‘Draco Malfoy’ was here to see Auror Thomassen, and several heads from the Bullpen
“Mm, yes, I agree. You look even more oafish than usual when you try. Legilimency’s wasted on you—one could read you like a book.”
But that was a lie. He couldn’t have had this, because that just wasn’t how things had gone. There was a difference—a subtle one, but there—between not being given any choice, and there never having been a choice to begin with. Their very actions, made based on who they were at their core, had kept this from happening, kept them from finding each other, until it was
He was everything Draco had ever aspired to be. Hopes and dreams and ambition and desire. A hero, really—a hero whose face you wanted to stomp into a formless mess because that was how mature, well-bred wizards expressed their feelings.
, as just because people couldn’t see him didn’t mean they couldn’t hear him, and Potter finally buttoned up.
“Oi,” George warned from nearby. “Mum said no duels before dinner! It’s on your head if she catches you!”
Several weeks of this had left Draco, on this morning, in a particularly fine mood. It was a Saturday, and Saturdays meant Potter would be spending his afternoon playing pick-up Quidditch. In the past, Draco had watched these antics perched atop the Slytherin stands, preening at what a fine broom he’d bought (well, kind of) for Potter. Today, though, he thought he might get in on the action. Even as an owl, Draco’s Seeker skills were not diminished, and he had far more manoeuvrability now than he’d ever had on a broomstick, if a bit less speed. Between his human instincts and the owl’s excellent senses and flying prowess, Draco intended to find the Snitch first, capture it before Potter, and then take off into the wild blue. The game would be ruined, Potter would be in a snit, and Draco’s afternoon would be made.
Something soft hit Draco in the temple, and he flinched. “What the f—” An old pellet fell at his feet, instantly disintegrating with the impact.
Draco looked to be thinking along the same lines, for he took the watch with a trembling hand, head ducked so that none but Harry could see how his eyes were shining. Lucius, too, seemed troubled by the unusually emotional exchange, quickly shooing Draco back to his mother, who was delighted to bestow upon him a new broom—a Nimbus 2020.
something, arsehole,” he challenged, though not without a slight tremor in his voice as he carefully approached an overexcited Scops with some student’s band on its leg. It looked like it was about to piss itself with glee, so Potter might have more to fear from the owl in the hand than the one in the bush, as it were.
“I’m not thinking of purchasing anything—just want to poke my head in and see what’s what. Probably won’t have much leave to drop in once school gets going again.”
he didn’t agree. What an absolutely insipid take—what happened when you were disarmed in the midst of a duel, as certain boy wonders were so fond of doing to their opponents? Draco had gotten
bit bored, all right, but certainly not enough he needed Draco in his hair, bird’s nest though it was. Potter had friends by the bucket-load, and Draco was the one who’d pushed everyone away.
“Right, right, of course.” Potter sighed. “Greenhouses, then, yeah?” He made a face. “You know it won’t smell
As the hall emptied, Harry felt his stomach finally unclench, the deed done and the weight off his shoulders. People were still swarming the table, but Harry let them come with a sort of lazy abandon; the sooner they copped their feel of him, the sooner they’d be on their way, and then Harry and his friends might have some peace. Speaking of his friends—where were they? He’d turned his back for two seconds to shake the trembling hand of some ancient, hunch-backed witch who looked like she’d been kicking around since the Iron Age, and Draco had disappeared, along with Ron and Hermione.
As he mounted the steps up onto the dais, taking his place at the stately podium behind which Dumbledore had always delivered his own quirky speeches, Harry could not help but feel everyone’s expectations weighing more heavily now than they ever had. A collective breath was held, all eyes on him—and Harry swallowed thickly, cast a quiet
She fixed him with a fond look, cupping his cheek. “You’re a lifesaver, Harry, really.” She then flicked her eyes over to Draco. “Make sure these boys don’t get into any trouble, won’t you?” Draco cocked his head in confusion, and the woman laughed, tapping him on the beak. “Pretty boy. Right, I’m off!”
Charlie shrugged. “Told him all I knew—which admittedly wasn’t much and still isn’t. But he seemed to have something weighing on his mind. Unfortunately the conversation got interrupted, and we never really finished.”
Potter slipped a hand into his pocket, withdrawing a rather unremarkable pouch the size of his fist, and placed it atop the knot. “And, as promised, because I’m a man of my word…” He then unlaced the mouth of the pouch, leaving it open, before quickly backing away.
“Pretty sure it’s exactly what it looks like—an offer of employment.” Thomassen pointed to the topsheet. “I’ve already filled out most of it for you, and I’ve spelled it to add my signature once you’ve completed the bits you’ll need to sign yourself.”
In retrospect, this entire mess might have been avoided entirely had he simply chosen a different perch to roost upon. As it was, though, he’d been too lazy to hop up a few more branches, well out of striking distance, and thus sat just within arm’s reach of the odd student wandering into the Owlery in want of a delivery bird.
want to), because that simply wasn’t something you said to the person whose life you’d personally made or helped make a living hell for the past seven or so years. Especially when you had not apologised to them—and even more especially when you had no intention of doing so, either.
Potter gestured around the room. “It’s well past curfew, and you’ve never been all that good at sneaking around. Pay off Filch or something?”
But Draco laughed, real and genuine and bright. “Merlin, no—it’s only, I’ve read that some degree of…
Draco stared at him, expression blank. “Do you have any idea how mortifying it is to be the only wizard at a party wearing slacks with your dress robes instead of formal breeches because you’ve got a great big silver cuff on your leg you can’t explain away?”
. Through the thick-paned glass, Harry could see that the shop was packed with customers of all shapes and sizes—as many grown adults as children who were clearly Hogwarts students.
“Because I want you there,” Draco said simply, as if that was all there was to it. Which, there might well have been; Draco was still a tricky, fickle beast to navigate, too draconic by half at times and in ways Harry didn’t think he’d ever grow accustomed to. Truthfully, though, it smacked a bit of ‘hoarding’, and Harry wondered if they ought to speak with Charlie, to see what else they might try doing in order to settle those restless bits of Draco that refused to be tamed. Not that Harry
The Bertie Bott’s Beans went flying everywhere as Potter jerked his hand back, shaking it and spitting out several
“Well,” Draco shrugged. “It wouldn’t matter. A gaggle of seventh-year Ravenclaws is using it most evenings to prepare their senior theses.”
“Be a mate and let us see the memory if you give your old man a heart attack, yeah?” Ron called after him as Draco marched up the stairs.
But much like the daydreams wherein he escaped the manor with Potter and his band of renegade war heroes, this was just another flight of fancy. He’d done Dumbledore in as surely by his actions as if he’d cast the Killing Curse himself. So no, he didn’t want to go back to the Astronomy Tower, whatever Potter thought his reasoning might be.
“Mm, I think not. The sun’s been peeking in and out; I expect the afternoon to be quite pleasant.” She shooed him away. “Off with you. Let me get back to my reading. I mean to have roses again come spring, if those damned peacocks haven’t dug up the beds.”
try to tell me you haven’t,” he added, when Draco opened his mouth, protests evident on his lips. “Grimmauld Place has its charms—”
“Hear about him? You only wrote to him every other day, practically. About the most inane shit, too—honestly, I read your letters to fall asleep some nights. Just—” He snapped his fingers. “Sent me right off.” He wrinkled his nose. “…Is he not family, then? Your bastard, mayhaps?”
He flashed a cheeky grin, and Draco told himself that just because they had something of an arrangement now didn’t mean shitting on Potter for nearly giving Draco a heart attack was off the table. “I hate you,” he said, stalking forward to catch up. “I really do.”
Potter brought his arm down so that Draco could hop off onto the sill, then tossed aside the protective jumper and grabbed the quill and parchment he’d been working on before Draco’s arrival. “So. It’s a Transfiguration essay tonight. What do you know about Animagi?”
Oh they knew Draco was an Animagus, knew he’d been not quite himself for a while and brought down Dumbledore in his animalistic rampaging—but they didn’t know
That sick churning feeling in his midsection was back, but it wasn’t guilt this time. It was embarrassment, because he’d been so
It really was most everyone in the family: Ron and Hermione, Bill and Fleur, Fred and George; Ginny was home for the weekend, though she’d been spending most of her summer at Hogwarts, helping with the rebuilding; the only ones missing, aside from Charlie, who’d had to return to Romania, were Percy and Mr. Weasley, who were pulling long hours at the Ministry these days but had assured Mrs. Weasley they’d be home in time for dinner.
was apologising. It wasn’t as if he’d been there—seen that sad, stupid old man begging for Draco to reconsider, to allow him to hide Draco and his family, to give them sanctuary. How much would have been different had Draco had the courage to take his hand then? How much would be better? Could anything possibly be worse?
a challenge. “Take as many as you like—I’ll be back for the pouch tomorrow, if that’s all right.” Draco ignored him, already visually picking over the treats he could spot nearest the lip of the pouch and trying to decide which he would sample first. “Er…if you could, though, please don’t…you know. Don’t shit in it or anything, please.”
It was a madhouse. Several dozen scarlet-robed witches and wizards were hunched over desks packed cheek-to-jowl, some feverishly scribbling what were likely incident reports, some deep in discussion with colleagues while Self-Scrivening Quills took notes, some taking statements from harried civilians who looked nearly as frightened as Draco felt to be in the midst of it all, and the open room with its high-vaulted ceilings seemed to hum with the low droning roar of multitudes speaking at once, not unlike the Great Hall at mealtimes.

the auto-braking charm?! And attaching the mount with Bulgarian Pine Pitch instead of a Permanent Sticking Charm?! HE’S GOING TO BREAK HIS FUCKING NECK TRYING TO SAVE A FEW KNUTS.” He snatched up a quill, spearing it into an inkwell, and immediately set to work, scratching savagely through Potter’s terrible decisions and scrawling much more sensible choices beside them. The 2020, with the auto-braking charm
“You’ve been seen in his company,” Thomassen said, expression even, as if he didn’t know the fraught relationship Draco and Potter had had. Which, Draco supposed, he probably
“Wow.” Potter whistled low beneath his breath, turning back around proper to fall into step alongside Draco. “This relationship is moving
Lunch with the Malfoys was lunch with the Malfoys, and Harry was willing to bet all the gold in his Gringotts vault that the only reason it was an intimate meal for four rather than an extravagant affair in the ballroom with glitz and glam and a string quartet was because Draco had threatened to cut ties with them altogether if they dared invite another soul. Lucius seemed thrilled for the excuse to focus all his attention on his son, ignoring Harry’s presence altogether, and gifted him a handsome watch. Harry thought it seemed a bit stuffy for a gift, until he recognised the piece as something similar to the one Mr. Weasley had given Ron when he’d come of age—and the one Harry had received from Mrs. Weasley to the same end. Of course; with Lucius rotting in Azkaban for Draco’s seventeenth birthday—and Draco not much better off, drowning in his Animagus studies and fearful for his and his parents’ lives—there’d been no opportunity for traditional coming-of-age birthday gifts.

“I’m not your owl,” Draco snapped reflexively, and it was the only thing he could safely say. Opening his mouth any further would only deepen the hole he was digging for himself.
Draco caressed Harry’s jaw and drew away, breaking their kiss just enough to whisper against his lips, “Do you realise how much it hurts?”

, least of all Harry Potter himself. He crossed his arms over his chest, spitting out with as much venom as he could muster in his flustered state, “I’m not delivering any more of your silly letters, by the way.”
“Ah!” Potter drew his head back inside for a moment, then poked it out again. “My roommates are in—I’ll meet you in the Owlery, ten minutes.” And giving Draco no chance to protest—though he couldn’t rightly do much more than hiss and scream, and while that was satisfying in its own right, it wouldn’t really help just now—he shut the window and locked it tight.
again, that Voldemort had left an irrevocable taint on everything Harry had ever loved, but the human spirit, it seemed, was resilient.
He focused on giving it to Draco just how he’d begged—hard and hot and fast, pouring back into him the same desperation and arousal that thrummed through Harry’s veins. A constant, thrilling cycle of sex and sweat and desire. Harry watched his cock disappear into Draco’s arse, glistening with lubricant and his own leaking fluids, and Draco’s cock was dribbling all over Harry’s stomach in prelude.

Harry took his time choosing a broom from the rack, and by the time he returned, a handsome Nimbus model (pilfered from the Slytherin stores) over one shoulder, Draco had shed his human form for something rather more suited to his name.
As the afternoon wore on and conversation grew thin, Draco decided it was finally time to return home. And he meant to

the celebrity of the moment, but surely he hadn’t sired any illegitimate get just yet. Still, Draco filed the knowledge away for later use—one never knew when one might need to blackmail a prodigious pain in one’s feathered arse.
The beast that had assaulted him was sent flying in a blur of claws and orange, and suddenly he could breathe again. Someone reached down, hands slipping under his back to pick him up, and Draco began lashing out again, wings flapping in an effort to right himself and get the
a look, and Harry rushed to defend himself. “I’m serious! Maybe you could work with Bragge in the Dragon Research and Restraint Bureau.” He was mostly teasing, but as he said it, he realised it didn’t sound like all that terrible an idea at all. He recalled, with startling clarity, how livid Draco had been at the sight of the Gringotts dragon, tethered and tortured. Perhaps he had a different view of the creatures now that he understood first-hand how they weren’t so different from humans, in their own way, and would be of a mind to stop them being treated like soulless, common animals. “I’m just saying, you’ve got more options than you might think and people willing to lend a hand.”
