"Just a little more", "Just a little more".
He says, and everyone is on him in a minute. The giant group hugs are definitely one of my favorite things in our friend group if I was being honest. He was laughing for a little bit before giving a small cough which reminded us he was still healing and to not get ahead of ourselves. We all let go and Mione took it upon herself to start lecturing him about being impulsive in situations where there was going to be injuries.
"Ha-aaryy"
She blushes at the compliment as I take out the eclairs and she picks one, munching on it with pink cheeks. It makes me smile at how innocent and young she is. Harry appears and he looks happy to see me when his face flickers to something I can't put my finger on, but it's gone too fast. He comes over but instead of standing next to Hermione he stands next to me. Practically pressed against my side. He looks up at me with puppy eyes before settling his gaze at my eclairs.
They nodded but Harry was wearing a frown on his face.
She leaves with a bounce in her step and Tonks jaw drops, as my face blushes. Tonks turns to me saying,
I just run to him and throw my arms around his waist hugging him with everything I've got. It feels so surreal to feel his warmth when all I could feel the last time was ice cold. I bury my face in his robes as I try to get my emotions in check.
He lets out a nervous laugh and rakes a hand through his silvery hair that I can't help but follow, before he's saying.
"I love you."
"And it's you."
I set the tray down on Hermione's vanity. Well it should be her own vanity but it looks like she hasn't set anything out or doesn't have anything for it. So I transfigure the boring simple mirror that is identical to the other girls vanities and make it a large heart shape with a glowing light that turns on and off with a simple tap of your wand. The mirror I outlined with glittering gold and blue butterflies that roam around the mirror when it isn't in use, as well as have the wood polished and shinning.
-once the bond is formed it isn't simple to get rid of, but you can break it with the counter ritual and a caster who is magically strong enough. I do have the counter ritual as well.
"OH MY GOD!" we both call out.
I had thought I could walk somewhat deeper into the twisted forest before curving my path and exiting at the border of the village. But the more I kept walking I realized this must be an enchanted forest because I have completely lost my sense of direction. I tried walking from where I came from but I just went in a circle. I tried to calm myself down despite the fear crawling into my chest. I was a war hero for crying out loud! I couldn't let an enchanted forest kill me now! I had to keep making my parents and family proud! I had to..............find someone who loves me for me, not some title.
"It's awful Sev, it's just so dark and he takes over the manor later. He ruins everything, destruction and death is at every corner. Everyday I was tortured for their entertainment Sev, it hurt so much. So many people die and no one is left unscathed. I came back to help...... to make things right. With my help their will still be war but the casualties will be far less than before, too many people died. But Sev I can't do this alone, I need you please. You're all I have left Sev. I used an ancient artifact in the Malfoy family, it grants you your deepest desire but it comes with a price. It-it took away mothers love from me. She was my light as a kid growing up in a cell of a house with an abusive father and then the war, she was my strength. She's gone now, and I know last time you cared for me enough to help me. Heh.... You know I always wished that you were my father? You were always gentle and ignored when I flinched, you gave me comfort without even holding me. Just by being near you, you calmed me down, and helped me when I would faint from my anemia. Please don't leave me alone in this. I need you."
I give a whoop of joy and I feel so happy. And the tendril of Draco's feelings whisper the sentiment back to me.
"Yes, but so was Merlin. Also didn't you know that Merlin was a Slytherin? Just because one person who was evil came from a specific house or has a certain skill doesn't mean the skill or house is inherently bad.”
He nods and levitates me before turning me face down, to reveal ripped whip strikes. Seven in total and not at all neatly placed. He sighs softly next to me and places a warm hand on my shoulder before explaining he will have to heal it the muggle way.
"Do you need any help?" I asked but he shook his head, blush even stronger.
I think I'll make mini pecan and pumpkin pies, and tomato, basil, mozzarella and pesto panini's for tomorrows train ride. Yes, that sounds good. Can't turn in a dangerous criminal over to the ministry on an empty stomach!
Harry tensed at the news but I made sure to reassure him.
His eyebrows raise high disappearing  into his long silky ringlet curls, "wait. You made these? Draco they're amazing. Since when do you bake? You didn't tell me this."
I smile faintly, "don't worry, I'm alright."
I couldn't even continue talking and bit my lip out of guilt. But the others all protested.
~Okay, so I've been reading this book to look for a solution for this whole no talking thing and I've found just the thing. Only its well, how do I say this.... It's not exactly a light magic casting. It's not black magic, more like grey. It's powerful and connects two people together in a bond that isn't very easy to break, which is why its frowned upon. It's not anything that would hinder either one of the two people who complete the bond.
"Yes I'm back I needed to fix everything that went wrong last time, to save the people who deserved to still be alive, please don't say anything I need to help them."
"The one who always has flour in his hair."
This was the room with the flying keys and Draco looked to me much to everyone's amusement and I grinned as I flew into the air. He directed me to the right key and I caught it with some difficulty. And I will thoroughly say I never want to do that ever again. I felt as though One of the keys could have bashed into my face at any point, or worse made me blind! As I came back down Ron and Mione cheered as they went to unlock the door while Draco checked me over with a proud smile. He patted me down and I made my way through to the next challenge Filled with warm butterflies.
And I just buried my face into his fluffy white hair trying to memorize every single little detail of him in my mind again before I made the walk back to the castle. I noticed the forest was no longer covered in snow and instead was flourishing with all types of flowers and had a wide clear path all the way to the castle. My heart finally eased, the curse is gone. I had a wide grin on my face when seeing Draco peek up at me with a heart melting blush staining his cheeks.
I spend the rest of the few weeks sitting next to Harry in classes and keeping myself busy with my now finished project. I couldn't believe it! I actually have a tester potion for lycanthropy. I can't help but laugh out loud at that and I make sure to check all of
he paused in his pacing to look at me but cut off his words at my skeptical look.
I grin and say, "of course. So next year your going to meet your godfather Sirius Black." Harry's eyes widen.
My steps are heavy and uneven moving tortuously slow compared to my near hyperventilating breaths. Pain is coursing through my body and all I can think about is making it to my only safe haven, my room. My limbs won't stop shaking violently and the sweat and blood beginning to dry to on my broken skin isn't helping. It gets to the point where I miss a step on the manor staircase and I fall unceremoniously to the bottom. My body sprawled on the floor as if I'm an abandoned rag doll, and I have absolutely no energy to get up again.
"Come in Draco, how can I help you?"
Blaise had been incorporated into the group astonishingly fast and I couldn't complain one bit. Him and Ron got along the minute they started a chess game, and he connected like a missing puzzle piece with Mione when they conversed about legislations in the ministry. Though when it came to Neville it was something quite unpredictable, instead of talking about Herbology Blaise actually gave Neville tips on spells and his wand work.
I just enter his room and once he's sitting down I kneel in front of him and look at his ankle. He startles a bit and then gets amused.
"Oh yeah, its a muggle expression for getting to know each other. Like when your in a group of people you don't know and someone asks a question to spark conversation, so that everyone gets a feel of how everyone thinks and what they like."
I just cringed and put my face in my hands only peeking through my fingers once she was done. Big mistake, the others now knew that I was just going to not bring up what was being spoken of, if not for Hermione making it known that this was serious. That I would hide a problem of mine from them if I could. It's just that I had to fight and struggle with everything in the war and became used to dealing with it alone. Even before that I had put so much effort to play seeker, hiding the fact that I was anemic my whole life, not really wanting to admit I had such a weakness. I went so far as to take several pepper up potions and nutrient potions before games and stressful situations, especially during the war. Severus never knew until one day he found me fainting before I could go into my room after a meeting with Voldemort. I only got through it all with his extremely strong energy potions after I told him.
"Well it works then." Neville says.
He nods smiling, "thank you Draco, for giving me a chance." "Of course Blaise, anytime."
I wake up groggy and much too soon only to find the beautiful white snake slithered into a pile on my chest, and it brings a smile to my lips before closing my eyes again and softly slipping into a deep sleep in the dark room.
I'm glad I had used a cleaning charm on myself before trying to sleep. I wouldn't want to do anything to make the cute owl avoid physical touch. He sits happily on my shoulder huddled in the juncture of my shoulder and jaw.
Blaise puts away his calm facade when were finally alone and I bring him into a hug to calm down his no doubt warring emotions. He quickly accepts and relaxes in the comfort I'm giving.
I just smirk and hand him the letter. As he reads he pales.
I run a hand through my hair while Draco turns to me with a hesitant face. I furrow my brow in a way of saying,
I sigh tiredly once the blueberry tarts are in the oven and I spell the equipment clean. Even with taking two potions I still feel myself wobble, so I make a detour to my bag. Yes, I need another one and some freaking salve, because my back feels like its both on fire and unbearably itchy at the same time.
"I apologize if I offended you at all Draco, but I still believe what I said is true....."
D:[ Harry! It works! You can hear me!]
"No one should have to go through the experiences of a war, especially when under aged. We all make choices that we may regret or feel guilt at when all were thinking of is surviving just one more day. I understand in more ways than you know, and I think that at one point with the right motivators I could have done what you did."
He still looks a little upset so I scoot closer to him and give him another cookie. He seems to give a small smile and I think that's a win so I ruffle his hair. We all seem a bit tired after all that excitement so we head upstairs and get ready for sleep. I am completely exhausted and felt myself almost black out brushing my teeth, which made Harry keep an eye on me after. Once I had gotten to bed I blacked out. I would regret that in a few hours because I forgot to close my curtains and put silencing charms on them.
"Dont worry Dobby, could you take me to the manor?"
She puts a hand to her forehead and furrows her brows.
”.......When the war was in full swing, Malfoy Manor was the official base and I was able to hear things constantly. The death eaters would constantly spit at his name so I know that there is no way he was actually the one to betray your parents.I just know he was framed."
He hugs me grinning like this is the best day of his life, and if this had happened to me last time it would have been for me too. "When can we meet up in secret?" Asked Blaise.
"Right silly question, of course you are going to make it right? Mr. I'm a prodigy."
I smile at the name and through my addled mind I respond, "thanks dad."
I hated how much I liked debating with him and putting both of our theories together before writing back my findings. which always led to greater revelations and breakthroughs for the things we both decided was “our Project".
But I didn't care if I had use dark magic to succeed in this, I would do anything to save Harry. So I studied each methods intricacies and precise runes. Three out of the four needed blood and I was fully prepared to go ahead with it, especially because blood always made things much more successful and powerful. It's why any type of dark magic is prohibited.
" when the clock strikes midnight on the Pr-Draco's birthday and the full moon is high, everyone is cursed to stay this way forever. I become an actual candelabra, no longer able to walk and talk. Draco.... he will loose any sense of humanity in him. I will no longer be sentient in any way and Draco will be alone...... as if he was an animal all along and not a human."
His breath uneven from excitement and reeking as it gets huffed into my face. My back on the cold ground pinned by the werewolf who is opening his jaws.
And that was how we found ourselves in the ministry elevator slightly squished. Ron didn't look as if he minded since he was closest to Mione but I myself was pressed against Harry's chest and I couldn't control the flush on my face.
She looks as though she's about to cry from happiness.
So I croak out for Dobby to please go get Severus, and he nods rapidly before babbling reassurances. It isn't until that moment I realize the silence that settled. The only thing that kept it away was Dobby, who is known for his constant chatter. And I find that I hate this sudden quiet. Especially now when all I feel is the throes of crucio aftershocks, and the dripping whip cuts.
"Alright well it's honestly not that great of an idea but, I was thinking this. How about when we all get on the train for hogwarts I gift Ron a new cage that will secretly be laced with containment spells? That way once he puts Pettigrew inside the cage we can take him to the ministry no problem and get one of the aurors to question him under veritaserum. I have a cousin, Tonks, who should be an Auror by now and she can be trusted, if the way her and her mother are shunned from the family is anything to go by. Especially when I take into account what she did in the battle of-...... yes I think she is our best bet."
"Tom!"
I whispered. Blaise just pulls me closer and after a while breaks the silence. "Could I join you sometime? I might not get night terrors but I do get nightmares often. Is it okay for me to be there?"
He growled, "Why are you so late, Merlin your a disgrace. Lets go!"
This is something I want you to use for anything you need. Please use it.
"I hope one day you can tell me everything that weighs you down even if it's only so you don’t get hurt."
"To be honest with you my only plan is to hear word of where both of them are so that I can capture the little traitor. It's the only way to clear Black of his charges. Though I don't know where either one of them are. Why does this have to be so hard! But I do know that somehow Pettigrew shows up at hogwarts this year, as well as Black. So really all I'm doing is waiting for them to show up, not much of a plan I know-woah calm down!"
She smirks and ruffles my hair, "Sure kid, go ahead and open it, I'm ready. He isn't getting away from me."
I laugh at that and respond, "okay just let me get changed."
"Alright I know that the one to proceed has to be either one of these two. The one to go back is simple, it's this one I've put on the far right. But these two could be the other one we need."
All of us get situated, Harry and I on one side next to a sleeping Lupin. With Ron, Neville and Mione across from us.
Ron just nodded rapidly and told him all about you know who, the death eaters starting the first war, and how his parents died but didn't know how he defeated you know who. I tensed up at the death eater part of the story and I activated the neckalace to give him comfort as the story was told, making Harry give me a grateful smile. It was only when Ron finished his grand tale that he really looked at me and got this spark of realization in his eyes. He didn't take his eyes off me as he said, "wait are you... Draco Malfoy?" I nod a yes and he narrows his eyes. "Your father is a death eater isn't he?" Harry puts his hand on my arm when I tense, and Harry just says, "even if his father is or was one, that's his father not Draco. Draco is a good person and my first friend, he wouldn't hurt anyone willingly for fun." At those words my eyes sting and so many emotions flood through me. Guilt from hurting students when I was younger to show others and harry who was boss because I was afraid of my fathers punishments if I didn't. Regret for not standing up to him before and being so scared. Self hatred for what I did during the war and warmth at Harry's faith in me. I never want to give him any reason to break his trust. I use the medallion again but accidentally forget to isolate my gratefulness and I end up sending everything to him. It causes him to gasp and I immediately let go of the medallion unable to bring myself to look at Harry, and clear my throat.
The days pass by fast and soon I have learned everything about cooking, and I have written down as much as I can remember about the first timeline in my blood sealed journal.
I quickly get it from my bag and hand it to him before I take off my tie and start to unbutton my shirt with my back to him. Once the last button is undone I take off my shirt somewhat hesitantly but eventually take it off. My head is facing the floor, eyes staring intently at my shoes, and my white hair is valiantly trying to escape the leather cord keeping it tied.
Im sure I could take him on in a fight as we are both similar in build and I'm faster in my reflexes, but I'm much better with my sword and I had to choose today of all days to drop it off at the  black smiths for some work. I couldn't do that, and I couldn't just keep hiding in the library either.
"Just take them I know you're probably going to get injured and not want to come to me for things like this. I hate the thought of you being in pain, so take them and come back when it's all used up."
Needless to say Neville was blushing and I heard Draco laugh even though he didn't look like he was laughing. I was hit with the realization I would now be able to tell when he was hiding his emotions either on purpose or by accident from being trained. Like now.
And it’s now that I find myself standing outside looking at the one and only BuckBeak as Hagrid proudly shows him off. Harry being Harry is excited and tries to get closer but I quickly grab his hand with a rush of fear and adrenaline at the possibility of him being the one injured. He turns his head to me so quick I'm worried about whiplash in his neck. He gives me a concerned look, no doubt worried about the fear on my end of the bond. I shake my head and answer him.
First year:
I get to the bathroom and head for the sink to wash my face when I hear someone come out of the showers. I take out my hair clips and am about to put one in when I hear a very familiar voice laugh. I turn around and see Harry, of course its Harry, why wouldn't the person to catch me looking a mess be him. I give a ghost of a smile and clip back my hair and wash my face only to feel a fluffy towel get placed in my hands. I dry off and thank him as I ruffle my hair to get the flour out, it ends up coming out in a cloud and it makes him laugh harder. I just roll my eyes and affectionately run my fingers through his damp hair.
We both sigh into our tea and before I leave I get stocked up on potions. Once I get back to the others we all retire for the night and it's a bit tense in the boys dorm as we get ready. Last night still apparent on everyone's mind and it feels suffocating enough that I rush through my routine and quickly close my curtains, spelling them silent.
I nod "Yeah! Bring whatever you want. It'll be like a get together to cheer us up and let the others finally know you."
Before leaving I left Siren next to him for company and some extra protection. She just gave a small hiss, in agreement of her mission to keep him safe and give me a signal for when he wakes up. Ever since I let Siren bite me last year she made a bond with me and is able to talk to me when far away, sort of like the bond I have with Draco. It's one of the main reasons I wasn't too worried about the whole having a telepathic connection with Draco, because I had already had one with Siren. So with a gentle caress to Draco's fluffy hair and Sirens head I left with the others to our next class in high spirits.
His smile was breathtaking and so was the way he said my name on those plush lips.
He gives a slight pause before looking towards me, “I hate the thought of us not being on the same side so I'm glad we are this time."
I just continue to theorize with Harry on what will happen in our next class and I get that feeling of something important is going to happen. I already have the gut feeling that today is going to be the Buckbeak incident and already I'm trying to form a plan to avoid Blaise getting injured. Since he's the one taking my theoretical spot in this timeline it has to be either him or another one of the Slytherins. I come up with a plan of casting a moving spell and a shield, or just tackling him to the ground if I need to act quickly.
I swallow a knot in my throat at knowing the possible outcome, when I gather my courage to ask.
"I had pure blood lessons over the summer, now if you'll excuse me I will be leaving now. Thank you for your help."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were deep in a conversation as Ron explained how the wizarding world had their own government, but Neville was a little quiet and looked very nervous. So I asked if he was interested in herbology and that was all I needed to say for him to open up, as he endlessly talked about different plants and their benifits. I just nodded along and added some things that we would learn in a few years so he could gain more knowledge. He was suddenly anxious about going to hogwarts and I knew exactly why. So I reassured him , "don't be nervous Neville I can tell you'll be a great wizard don't let others intimidate you or get you down alright, no ones ever received a letter only to be rejected after." He tears up and confides in me that he's afraid he won't be good enough and that his wand isn't even his it's his fathers. I just put an arm around him and tell him," Neville no matter what I know you'll be okay, I can feel your magic all you need to do is practice and you'll do amazing things I guarantee it. Your parents would be proud of you finally going to hogwarts so do your best and be yourself , trust me Neville it's enough. Though I will tell you that using a wand that connects to you will make your magic stronger and easier to handle so if you want to I will help you get it." He just sniffles and nods. I pat his back and tell him I'll arrange for it to be done. That's when I decide some eclairs might cheer him up a bit, so I unshrink the container and hold it out for him. He smiles and thanks me, I turn to the others and offer them one. Each of them taking one with bright smiles, except Harry is giving me a much smaller one but his eyes hold so much warmth that I feel me heart skip a beat. I look away pushing the fluttering feeling in my chest away knowing that I couldn't let myself have romantic feelings for him for at least another four years or so. I cursed my older past self for having a crush on Harry. It had started in second year and grew instead of going away until I didn't have time for unrequited affection, when all that mattered was survival.
I didn't finish and Harry just climbed on my bed and puts his arms around me.
I hesitate but say another, "thank you", to the empty air before picking up the clothes and changing in the bathroom. I shiver in delight at the warmth coming back to me, now that I'm dry. I feel the material of the trousers and dress shirt mildly wondering how expensive they must be since the shirt feels like silk and the trousers are soft, rather than the scratchy texture I'm used to. But I give a small smile at being able to enjoy them even if for just a little while.
It wasn't until he murmured, "I'm not wearing anything under you cloak am I?"
"Is he alright? What happened to him? Oh god I didn't mean for this to happen. I'm such a fucking idiot! Please tell me he's going to be alright? Will his face forever be scarred because of me?!"
Neville snickers at the question all the while Ron seems to try and avoid answering but ultimately answers.
And Neville says, "Even though I'm still upset about what happened to Mione I understand that it had to happen. You saved Rons little sister from all of this so I know that if you could have, you would have avoided what happened to Mione."
Harry's POV:
The only good thing about this torture being a regular thing is that Dobby now transports me once I take the first step out of the drawing room. I no longer have to trek any farther, and in minutes I'm on my bed being tended to by Sev. I always give a breath of relief when I see him and as always he diligently heals my broken body, despite the sight he's met with. Wether it be broken bones or cursed whips and torn flesh.
It isn't long until Mione is whisking Ron, Neville, and I to the library for some studying and finishing homework. I stay for a good hour helping the others since I always finish my work in class or in the early hours of the morning after waking up drenched in my own sweat.
H:[thanks for the warning. I'll keep an eye on Ron and Neville then. What happened last time?]
"I guess its a good thing I have you to remind me then." Is the soft reply she gets.
It isn't until I begin seeing everything start to blur that I remember I didn't take a potion before coming down, and that's why I had felt so tired. I blink rapidly and make my way to my bag. I grab a potion and drink it as I steady myself with one hand on the table. I sigh at the minty aftertaste and the rush of new energy that courses through me. I put the bottle back inside my bag and turn to notice Blaise and Harry watching me. Harry with concern and Blaise with sadness and pain.
He asks with hope and happiness filling his eyes. I smile while saying yes, and no sooner than saying it I'm being engulfed in a bear hug from him.
Mione is watching in affection while the others smile. I just open the next one and see that this its Remus's so I put it to the side. I get another one and its Ron's. I hand it to him and he seems to be vibrating with excitement and nerves as he takes it from my hold. He stares at each item in disbelief as he pulls them out. Dress shirts, ink black dress robes with gold detailing, a fur lined winter coat in a dark grey color, leather Oxford shoes and designer socks. Dress pants, casual trousers and to pull it all together designer dress down T-shirts. He looks at the last items and turns bright red letting me know he got the boxers and briefs as well. He doesn't pull them out but he hugs the clothes softly to his chest as if to make sure they aren't just a figment of his imagination and looks at me with such gratitude.
I give him a smile through my discomfort and decide to just say fuck it. I can't take this any longer I need his help.
The snake nods and slithers out his tongue when I rub in between his eyes in a tiny circular motion. I smile softly and nod.
- let each other feel the other persons emotions faintly.
We all pass the night waiting with one another's presence as a moral booster, but after not getting any updates when midnight struck we all reluctantly decided to go to bed. My night routine goes by in a blur that I don't quite care to focus on at the moment, even if I would have less of a chance at tripping over Ron's strewn items. I could only muster up the energy to roll into my bed and close the curtains with a sigh. All while I force myself to not open the red curtains after everyone has fallen asleep to stare at Draco's vacant bed. I huff at how stupid and puppy-like I'm being and close my eyes tightly as I burrow into my blankets hugging a pillow to my chest. And though it feels like it takes years I do feel myself at one point slip into a dream that makes me feel warm and happy.
He watches me with careful eyes and I feel the need to calm him down, so I get up and hug him. He tenses but slowly relaxes as I talk, "yeah I will. It's okay I don't have to go back to know what I want." He pats my back and I soak up the feeling of us together with a smile.
Once we had gotten ourselves in order Sirius just sighed and shook his head.
”World War Two, nasty war that it was. It was happening in the muggle world and Tom himself was an orphan surrounded constantly by the threat of bombs being dropped over his head. He had gone to Dumbledoor and asked for the protection of Hogwarts for every magical child in danger from the war over the summer, but the headmaster refused....."
Forth year:
Before writing out my order and sending the galleons in a transfigured pouch along with the order. I make quick work of putting the catalogue in my bag and hurrying to the great hall. I get there and sit with the others as if nothing happened. And just like always we eat and go to our classes. I explain that I can translate for Draco in our classes and the professors though suspicious, nod and let me tag along with Draco as he keeps his position as their intern.
"What Draco? I thought you were okay with me killing someone before. Why not just one more? We could be together then!"
He asks while piping filling on tiny little macaroon tops. I just bring a stool over next to him and plop down as I retell what I just stumbled upon. He pauses and thinks for a few minutes and goes.
Once I'm settled in uncle Sev's armchair with a nice warm cup of tea I stare at Sev, who is in the arm chair across from me and let myself calm down for a minute more before I explain.
He becomes serious and nods.
As soon as we step off the train we were lead to the boats and had all decide to ride together even though it's four per boat. I didn't want to exclude Neville, he really is an amazing wizard he just needed support. It's upsetting that even his own house either ignored or picked on him so I decided that I would be his support system this time. As we got to the boats I paused and raised my hand to stroke the dark thestral, it was so devastatingly beautiful and I felt a connection with them. The others were looking at me a bit strangely and Ron was the one who questioned me as soon as we were riding across the lake. "Just thanking our magical creatures for the ride." Everyone just looked even more confused and I gave a wistful smile. It wasn't until we were making our way into the doors of the school that Neville got my attention and he whispered, "you were talking about the thestrals weren't you?" I just gave him a sad smile and his eyes looked at me with emotions I could name but made me feel cared about.
"I will but I don't know everything that happens since I wasn't that involved in your adventures the first time around. I actually didn't really know Ginny was the one who was supposed to be possessed until the day we were getting our supplies. I'm sort of piecing things together since I only really know everything that happens starting fourth year.... well I mean I do know what happens but-"
"Sirius! Merlin I'm so glad your out!"
"just because you seem unwell and I'd like you to start taking them daily. So once these 12 run out come back for more alright?"
So I nod and take a small sip of it. I cork it and put it inside my robes before nodding to them and spelling a silencing charm around us four.
"Oh how glorious it is for our kingdom to have such courageous and cunning men like you! I will knight you for these actions, please on your knee."
"Hey Ron I had some spare time and decided that scabbers should have an upgrade!"
I'm at the top of the astronomy tower waiting for about 20 minutes when I hear footsteps. I see Zabini looking nervous and relief floods his face as he sees me.
"Oh look at just how handsome you look now! Very nice. Now if only we could get a little more weight on you that would be fantastic."
I was left somewhat speechless that he would figure it out so quickly but I knew he was a fast learner. The others were watching the scene unfold with shocked eyes.
I let out a breath knowing it was bound to happen and just went with it. He frowns slightly and pulls the sleeve down before resolutely nodding once and then leading the way out. I just raise an eyebrow in question, wondering what in the world went through this curly Ravens mind, but he just keeps facing forward and walking all while not dropping my hand.
The quiet room being pierced by the shattering of ceramic mugs that I flung to the ground in my desperation to do something. The need to destroy something wether it be a random object or myself was an urge so strong I knew if I didn't grab something quickly it would not end well for me. So I had gripped the mug perched innocently on the counter next to me after wildly throwing myself at it. Clenching it in a bruising hold before smashing it shakily from the pent up nerves.
"It's okay Draco everyone knows you're the mother hen that can't help but feed and care for everyone."
Once I'm finally able to get him out of his paralyzing nightmare he gasps trying to breath through his tears and sobbing, his jumbled up words of "I'm sorry" and "Please stop" are the only sounds in the room. I just hug him close and he practically grips my sleep clothes as if I'm his lifeline. And in a way I might be. I ignore the huge blast that went off in the distance much to the incredulous stare of Ron.
I pause only for breath before continuing.
The entire way to the room I have a smile on my face matching the other boys, even through our night routines all the way until everyone is in their bed. I walk slowly to my desk and sit down trying to pull together my thoughts and feelings. With a soft snap of my fingers the elaborate glass lantern comes to life and radiates a warm glow across my glossed wooden desk. The package re-taped sitting innocently on the floor next to my right foot along with the extra supplies I ordered separately. I clip back my bangs thinking absentmindedly that I might be able to tie back my hair with a leather strap or ribbon by the end of the year.
She went into her office and we both waited for the headmaster to come. About five minutes later he did show up holding a deep crimson silk bag and handed it over to Draco.
Lupin looked at me sharply and It was then the air became impossibly cold and I knew what would happen. Everyone's eyes were glued to the figure opening the compartment door. I was shivering but turned to Harry and grabbed a hold of his hands.
I give myself only a minute to say an apologetic farewell to him. To my friend who was never meant to be.
Blaise could handle it because he is like me in so many ways. Already a witness to the harshness of our parents expectations and punishments. Though mine is more extreme it doesn't mean his experiences were any less painful for him. So as I look into Harry's still soft face and trusting eyes I can't bring myself to take that all away in one day. To burden him with things no eleven year old should have to deal with. So I decide to just tell him what he needs to know.
-it doesn't hinder either one of the persons relationships or marriages with other people who aren't their bond partner.
I look at Harry and I see a spark of doubt come over his features but I just smile at him for comfort and turn to stare into Sev's eyes. I just reply with, "look". He startles as he takes in the meaning of my response and hesitates but nods tensely as he places his hands on the sides of my face. I smile warmly knowing he only did that motion to be closer and more affectionate. He just chuckles and then he makes the connection.
The day is relaxed and perfect. To the point that it hurt to say a farewell to him later that night when Dobby worriedly came to take him away. I told him to come to me if he needed help and he agreed but I feared for his safety, while waiting anxiously the whole night for him. He didn't come back until three days later through which I asked Dobby what was going on multiple times.
I can't lie to him, I just can't. Not to Blaise. Maybe its because he's like me in so many ways it would be like lying to my past self. But I know I can trust him. I know it deep inside, because he needs someone who trusts him and I will not betray that trust. I would have been devastated if I were to have finally gotten someone who cares about me and then they don't trust me enough to lie to my face. So I know what I have to do.
I glared at Quirell and was about to sneak into the infirmary away from the others but Sev stopped me and said he needed to speak with me. I just nodded smiling at the others as I followed Sev to his quarters. As soon as we got there he swiftly scanned me and grazed  the cut on my cheek, it stung so I flinched. He frowned.
"Little Draco, Master wants you ready to go get supplies."
side. I smile at my handiwork.
"Merlin Draco your going to die! If this training is anything like I think it is, it's going to hurt. Shit, what are we going to do?"
I give him a sad smile, "I don't want to betray his trust so I can't tell you. But I can tell you that he is a good person. He's an innocent kid being forced to do things and act a certain way because he's afraid. I promised he wouldn't go through this alone because leaving him is like abandoning myself. We are too much alike and I will help him with everything I have so that he can be happy. Because when you live a life like ours, happiness is a dream. It's a wish........”
The barmaid returned with their drinks and Harriet smiled kindly and offered her thanks, "Listen," she started, "I'm nervous about this--"
"Does it bother you now, then?"
It wasn't even half eleven.
"You don't know anything--" she started, her voice raising and her cheeks flaring with color.
She realized then that the reason she found herself thinking constantly about what Malfoy had said to her was because she'd done just what he'd told her not to.
She laughed and ran a hand through her hair before looping her bag on the back of her chair. Draco Malfoy--trust her? That was a new one. Could they really have changed this much in three years? Well--actually, yes. That was a stupid question. Before she could stop herself, she said, "Not the sort of place I expected."
"Your mother saved me in the forest. Call it even."
Malfoy was looking at her, but not like she had three heads. If she had to describe it, the look on his face was almost...empathetic? Like he understood and felt bad, and not in a way that made her feel pitied, but in a way that made her feel like she didn't have to explain or be embarrassed. Her chest was heaving, heart pounding, her skin was almost vibrating from the unreleased magic that threatened to unleash it's defensive fury on a simple car crash. A firm hand on her arm tore her eyes from the wreck. It wasn't until she made eye contact with Malfoy that she noticed his lips moving, that he was telling her to breathe.
His hand-writing was exactly as she pictured it. Small, tidy script that ran like water, rippling over the parchment the same way water ripples over tiny pebbles at the edge of a stream.
She blinked at Malfoy once, twice--found that she didn't mind that he was dismissing her, that she didn't have it in her to fight him, not anymore. In fact, without his insistence, she wasn't sure she'd have been able to walk away. As if letting Riddle's body out of her sight would allow him to come alive once again.
"So. What do they say about assume?"
Ron rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything else as a Healer bustled into the room, “Fortunate he did. His familiarity with the curse helped us greatly, we should be able to break it in the next day or so,” the Healer was one Harriet hadn’t seen before, but she found herself pleased at her lack of bias towards Malfoy.
After the bird was gone, Harriet folded up the Prophet, ignoring the way her own face stared back at her with a forced smile, and threw it in the rubbish bin beside her desk. She didn't care what they had to say about her, never had. From then on she decided she wouldn't be reading the Prophet anymore. It was a waste of her time.
The rest of the event had proceeded much like the rest of them. Shaking hands and smiling tight-lipped, resisting the urge to spit "no comment" at every reporter looking for a sound bite as she was told she really should be more mindful of her
They were nearing the outskirts of town, Harriet was seemingly entirely alone, but her wand was in her hand and she new, though she couldn't see them, the others were close enough to come to her aid if needed. They'd walked nearly every cobble-stone street in the village, casting detection charms and searching for magical signatures. She'd even resorted to using the "point me!" spell, despite Robards telling them it was next to useless and not efficient enough to trust, but well, it told her to keep moving straight, in the direction of an abandoned manor she could only see if she lifted her hand to shield the glare of the sun from her eyes.
"Kicking dead bodies."
Harriet rolled her eyes and took a sip of her beer, trying hard not to snap back at him with a quip that would surely lead to an argument, which would surely lead to her storming out of the pub and Malfoy covered in the remnants of her pint. She raised an eyebrow at him over the rim of her glass and waited, intent on getting some sort of apology before she deigned to speak again.
And...well, yeah, there was still a lot to be sorted through.
Her body screamed in agony, each movement set off a stinging pain, similar to the
Malfoy sighed, “I assume you never want to speak to me again?”
“Apparently Malfoy has been very covertly contracted by the Ministry to help locate Dolohov, Greyback, and now Mulciber, I suppose. He’s been on the case for months—“ Hermione started to explain before Ron cut in.
"Sugar, does it look like anyone could give Lem trouble with me around?"
Draco didn't say anything but stepped aside with a wave of his arm, signaling her safe passage with a dramatic flourish. She'd taken three steps before he called out to her again, but what he said shocked her so sharply she didn't turn back around, merely froze, "Do you think we could ever be friends?"
"Charming."
everyone because of who they used to be!" Harry lifted her glass and finished it in one go, not caring that a bit of it dribbled down her chin before she drew the back of her hand across her mouth, "So, thanks for proving me wrong, and thanks for the drink, I hope you know how muggle money works because I'm certainly not sticking around to help you figure it out."
"Oh, piss off," Harriet muttered with a roll of her eyes, though her lips were turned upwards, "Why did we hate each other so much?" It was a stupid question, but warranted.
Before Harriet could protest any further, the line went dead.
after
"Don't we still?" Malfoy asked her curiously, and while she initially thought he was just trying to be a prat, she saw a note of sincerity in his eyes and heard it in his voice.
And she was wasting it. God, she was wasting it.
"I'm sorry," she muttered, her eyes flicking back to the cars and now shouting muggles as she slid her wand back up her sleeve and stood properly again. "That was--yeah," she was waiting for him to laugh, waiting for him to call her a nutter and change his mind entirely about continuing the evening or ever seeing her again.
It was 11:34am.
Hermione's features visibly softened and she threw her arms around Harriet's neck, "Oh, no, I'm sorry--I shouldn't have overreacted, I just--"
"-rriet, Harry? Can you hear me?" Hermione's voice broke through, pulling her back to the surface, "They want to know what you want to do with V-Voldemort's b-body."
"Don't. Stop rehashing it all, I get it. You feel like you owe me, is that it?"
She flicked her wand--
They sat in silence for a bit. Not uncomfortably so. It seemed they were just...staring at one another, taking the other in.
"W-what? No! No, it's not a date, I'm just--"
What horrible thing had Potter done to herself two years ago?
Draco fucking Malfoy. In the flesh.
But, at the end of the day she had sold it, if only to rid herself of the constant reminder that Sirius was gone and the house was empty. She was surprised at how liberating it had been to sign the house over. To buy her flat, positioned beautifully in muggle London, just far enough away from the tourist crowd, but not too far to lose out on the intricacies of old English architecture.
She didn't care about her image, but she didn't very well like hearing bits of gossip about her after particularly spiteful encounters, nor did she like the Minister pulling her in for tea, when they both really knew he was kindly trying to tell her that she was a Ministry employee now and had to act like one.
The Minister was still chuckling slightly as he spoke, "We received an anonymous tip that Dolohov, Greyback, and possibly Mulciber--"
It had been a few weeks before she heard from Malfoy again. Not that she was expecting to hear from him. Or that she even wanted to hear from him--he was still a prat. Still the bully she'd grown up with.
"You're on, Potter."
“We don’t mind, Harry, really!”
"'ello?"
It had made her remarkably happy to furnish the place, to decorate it how she pleased. She'd never truly had a place of her own before. Even at Hogwarts the girls dormitory hadn't really offered a chance for personal touches. She'd finally gotten every last detail right, down to the candle she had on the shelf in her bathroom. It had taken the entire year she'd lived there to finish up.
The first sob that left her throat was quickly followed by another, and another. Her shoulders wracked, her hands shook, and the tears staining her cheeks didn't seem like they'd ever stop. And then, they did.
the one who asked
“Apparently, the git’s become a Private Investigator. Helping families track down loved ones in hiding—and now helping the Ministry find the remaining Death Eaters,” Ron informed her.
"What the fuck are you doing here, Malfoy?" Ron snarled, his wand drawn and shoved sharply against his neck, though he was trying to work quickly before the curse worsened and severely hurt her.
Utterly and brutally numb.
"I'm sorry, alright? Shite--that was hardly the worst thing I've ever said to you."
"Harriet Potter, you're lying through your teeth, I can hear it in your voice! Don't tell me, then--but I will want details tomorrow!"
She took off at a run, then, unable to wait for the others to catch up should a brief hesitation allow them to get away. Breathing heavily, she flicked her wand at the stunned figure in black robes, binding his arms and legs tightly to his side, so as not to allow him movement, even if he came to anytime soon. Harry continued on, flicking her wand and sending flashes or red and blue light with the intent to stun or incapacitate. She caught another and left him to Ritchie, who had quickly caught up to her. She couldn't stop though--they hadn't gotten them all, if her memory was correct the other two should be right around her--
Malfoy
Feedback is always loved!
She met his silver eyes and rolled her own, "I'm not drunk just--clumsy," she admired, not having the tolerance to fight him at the moment. She was hardly tipsy, the Patil's (not to mention Hermione and Ron) would have her head if she was already drunk. They weren't big fans of Drunk Harriet as of late--least of all at an emotional charade like this.
Don't waste it.
"R-Ron--something's wrong--"
Harry had genuinely laughed at what he'd written. It was like he was half-trying to tell her she was full of shit and probably wouldn't keep her word, while also half-trying to tell her that he would appreciate it if she did. Feeling giddy for the first time in...a very long time, Harry scrawled a reply on the back of Malfoy's letter.
"She suggested I thank you before I never got the chance. I realized she was right--I thought my future would consist of Azkaban. I never thought..." he stopped speaking and shook his head, "Once I saw Vo--his body, I realized I had a few things to say to him, too."
“Precisely. So, when you get out of here, we’ll go for drinks and try again.”
She chanced another glance at the clock.
"I'm sure even you can imagine why my name can't publicly be tied to this investigation, Weasley," Malfoy sneered.
"Let's split up," Ron said suddenly, and Harriet turned to him in shock. He was the best strategist in the department, but splitting up didn't sound at all like a good idea to her. He held up a hand to signal that he wasn't finished, "We stay in sight of one another and move in formation. We'll watch one another's backs from afar, but splitting up might coax them out. Essentially, Harriet, if they see you their first instinct is going to be to attack. Especially if they think they've caught you alone. The moment one of us see's them, we'll call for backup. And if they aren't here, having split will allow us to cover more ground in less time."
They arrived in the village an hour after Kinglsey had instructed her to get their team together. After a quick planning session and going over their objectives (investigate casually, make sure no one gets hurt) Harriet was feeling hopeful. Or rather, she was trying to tell herself that she felt hopeful.
“Malfoy?” It was all she could manage, her voice gravelly with the effort it took not to cry out in pain. She glared at the pair of them when they exchanged a look.
"Not like I can frequent Knockturn Alley pubs--"
He was dead. Really dead. It was over.
"Oh, that--er. A muggle saying."
"And?" Malfoy leaned forward, his silver eyes boring into her own.
"Hate to burst your bubble, Coote, but I don't think we're about to be finishing this up anytime soon," Harriet sighed, "This doesn't feel off to you lot? Searching for them for years and an annonymous tip leads us here and the first place Ron and I walk into confirms it? It's too clean. Too neat."
to come here, Malfoy. You're the one who asked if it was possible for us to be friends. I came here because I wanted to, Merlin knows why after this shit--I'm trying this new thing, see, where I don't go around fucking
and was nearly floored to detect four figures lingering in the thick wood to her left and a fifth to her right. She raised a hand and ran it through her hair, a signal to alert the others that they weren't alone anymore. With a bang, Harriet flicked her wand, someone among the trees yelped, undoubtedly taken off guard.
She and Ron high-tailed it out of there with a brief apology and a promise to come back soon. Once they were out of sight of muggles, she tapped the tip of her wand against the coin in her pocket so it would warm and signal to the others that they needed to meet back up. Ron set about explaining what had happened to the other, while Harriet fiddled anxiously with her wand, sliding it in and out of her sleeve, very much at the ready.
Malfoy opened his mouth to say something, but whatever it was got lost in the sudden chaos that broke out around them. Two cars collided and the ensuing 'bang' accompanied by the sound of breaking glass, shouting, and someone crying had Harriet's heart pounding out of her chest, her wand was drawn and she'd yanked Malfoy down to the ground, trying to get low and avoid what was sure to be a duel, right there in the middle of Muggle London.
Potter was the one to break the silence, rubbing his hand on the back of his neck nervously. “So do you have any belongings or anything?” He asked.
“No?” Draco shook his head, slightly confused at her sentiment.
, but it was
“I has not broken ins, sir. Your wards simply did not keeps me out, I am here to serve Master Malfoy,” Fissy looked at Potter like he had three heads. Like he should have known that.
but instead he just shook his head no. He didn’t trust his voice, nor did he want to give Potter any reason to think lesser of him for being weak.
“I don’t know,” Draco started but was met with an unamused look from Potter, and an angry sneer from Kreacher. “Potter, please believe me. I swear on my life I haven’t the foggiest idea why one of the Malfoy house elves is in your home.” Draco was borderline pleading with Potter to believe him. He really had no clue.
“You’re perfect,” Harry kissed both cheeks and kneaded into the globes of Draco’s mouth-watering
He feels heavy in his bed, yet something feels off. His sheets are scratchy against his skin, but Draco feels almost like he’s floating, levitating in bed somehow. The limbo between sensations is making him feel queasy, and he has to focus on curling his toes to stop the wave of nausea.
“So you think this was an okay anniversary?” Harry asked, looking down at his thoroughly fucked husband.
“... However, Mr. Malfoy, you seem to have made at least the smallest of ripple effects outside of your usual activities leading up to your time here,” Shacklebolt reminded Draco of Officer Otters, not only in their appearances but in their demeanor. They both had nonchalant ways of carrying themselves, exuding authority without being overbearing or threatening. “You have had a saving grace come to you in the form of a savior that is known to all of Wizarding Britain,” Shacklebolt continued. What does that even mean,
Draco was finally left to his own devices, where he should be thinking over the dream he just had. He needed to get some closure, but the only thing that his brain was allowing for thoughts was
I'm SOOO sorry I haven't uploaded in a few days. I was distracted because it was my BIRTHDAY!!!! But yeah, now that that's over with, I should be back to a more regular schedule with my uploads. I'm also starting writing some oneshots if anyone would be interested in those :) I have a DM/HP oneshot up right now and I'm currently working on a One Direction Larry Stylinson oneshot soooooo if that's your thing please go check it out :D
“Yeah, you were amazing love, loved every second of it,” Harry said, crawling up to lay next to Draco, pulling him into his body to tangle their legs together.
Potter raised an eyebrow, “I know who you are, Malfoy. Do I need to owl Dr. Inkwood? You seem a bit off.”
Granger had stormed out of the floo disheveled into the living room at half 10 the next day with panic oozing in her voice as she explained to Draco and Potter that the intended caterer for the event had suddenly dropped dead the night before. Apparently he had had a stroke, and Granger was teetering between being upset that the man died, and upset that now she had no idea how she was going to follow through with the party without the huge amounts of food that was ordered.
This created a major problem, mainly for Draco, and total chaos within the Ministry rumor mill. If he was not able to return to the Manor until the Master of the house lifted the wards, then he would no longer qualify for house arrest. Draco didn’t know what to do, there wasn’t anything that
“Fissy will be fetchings a healer, Master Malfoy,” Fissy called, and disapparated with a
“Right, well you can borrow some things of mine until I’m able to take a trip to Diagon Alley. Might have to send someone else, maybe Hermione since it’s hard for me to be in public right now,” Potter stated. Of course it’s hard for him to be in public, Draco thought. What with thousands of witches and wizards wanting to praise Harry Potter, the boy who lived, for saving the wizarding world and defeating the Dark Lord. Draco had a sudden epiphany. How could he be so stupid? Of course Shacklebolt had been referring to Harry Potter, of all people. The
Ross snorted and Lem shook his head, "Rough looking fellows been 'round a bit, funny coats. Tried to pay for a meal with weird coins. Didn't say anything though, as they were gold and worth more than the fish and chips I made 'em."
"You're not going anywhere with her, convenient that you just happened to be here--"
Harriet unfurled it quickly, flicked her eyes to the unfinished bacon and toast on her plate, should the bird be hungry, and skimmed the contents. Once she hit the name at the bottom she read and re-read the letter until she had it memorized.
"You've got to be joking," she muttered to herself, her hand instinctively reaching to clasp the locket around her neck. The Stag--was this for real? Of all pubs in London that Malfoy could have picked...this was the one? She'd never been much for Divination--but this should have been a good sign. Or, it could have been a sign that this was an utterly terrible idea. Harriet shook her head and stepped inside. With a brief pause by the door, she surveyed the mild crowd and moved immediately to the platinum blonde head of hair at a table for two.
Harry sighed and pulled away from him, only then getting the chance to properly take in the sight of him. He was dressed smartly in a navy blue suit, as dress robes had been deemed old-fashioned for an event like this. His hair was as slicked back as ever, his shoes perfectly polished, his ego coiffed. The only thing she hadn't been expecting was the very slight shadow of stubble he'd grown since she'd seen him across the Great Hall a year ago, and he often hid behind his hand when the papers tried to photograph him.
And, yet...here she was.
Once inside, Harriet chose a spot close to the door with her back to the wall.
I have a bit of a stockpile of material, so I'll get a few chapters out fairly quickly. I'd love any and all feedback, of course.
An unfair wave of guilt rushed through her, and she wrapped an arm around her waist before doubling over with another sob. She couldn't very well desecrate a dead man's body--even if that man was Voldemort. Tom Marvolo Riddle. She wanted so terribly to feel relief and happiness, only, she couldn't. There was so much pain and loss--the range of her emotions shuffled through her and all she could think of was how she wished she hadn't gotten back on the train. Then she might've gone on to see what was waiting for her elsewhere.
It took her a few moments before she realized that they were safe. Everything was fine--
With a snap of her fingers, the champagne was vanished from her gown and the rest of her glass disappeared much smoother through her lips this time around.
"Potter--"
“Fuck off.”
“No, go. M’gonna sleep more anyway. I’ll be fine,” she insisted, trying her hardest not to let any of the pain deep into her voice. This was agonizing—she tried to imagine what it would feel like to have the Cruciatus cast on top of this, and how Riddle had ever expected anyone to be able to give up any information through this sheer, blinding pain.
"I don't hate you anymore, if that's what you want to know," she told him, her voice gentle and earnest--it struck her then that she had never, in the entirety of their lives, spoken like this to Malfoy. Spoken this much to Malfoy, even.
"I kicked him twice."
"Oh, my gosh! Harriet Jamie Potter! You're going on a date--with who? Someone I know?"
"If you want to be my friend you're going to have to work on not being such a jerk."
Kingsley nodded, "Of course. It's no matter. We've got eyes on them again, a near miss--but near enough to make them nervous. Or, to encourage them to come out of hiding again. They want to remain relevant, after all. I expect attacking Miss Potter was too tempting to resist."
"Why did you come here?"
"Shite, fuck--Minister, argh-!" As she pushed her chair out from her desk and tried to get her footing, Harriet really did fall out of it this time and Kinglsey laughed and stopped her chair from taking him out, "Sorry Kingsley," Harriet grumbled and pushed herself to her feet, wondering why she was spending so much time on the ground lately.
Malfoy left before she could answer, but she found it that she didn’t want to say no anyway. This new information, the whole PI side to Malfoy—it was intriguing and ultimately not what she expected from him. It shed new light and added another layer to someone that was surely becoming more impossible to read than ever.
She was smiling.
Malfoy looked wary, hesitant to take her word for it, but he put up his mask again as he spoke, "Even after everything--you're a strange creature, Potter."
"You're such a--a stupid git! I'm leaving!" And when she didn't walk away Malfoy raised his eyebrows at her expectantly. Oh, of course, of course she was the one who had to walk away. She wondered if he was trying to make her feel like she was tucking her tail and running.
There was a strange emptiness that overwhelmed her now.
Malfoy looked like he was going to say something scathing, but he merely shrugged, "Don't mention it."
"Therefore, you can live in a comfortable state of deniability," the accompanying eye roll was enough to set her temper off again.
He looked at her like she had three heads and it drew a laugh out of her.
Malfoy snorted, "Potter, be serious."
Harriet opened her laptop and pressed the power button. She was curious--Malfoy had chosen a pub in muggle London? She hadn't even thought he knew anything about London, outside the magical bits. Before she could put more thought into this, her flat rang with the chime of her telephone and she stood to answer it.
"You're Harriet Potter, I trust your eyes to find danger more than my own--even if it's imagined."
"You should have."
Her parents. Sirius. Remus and Tonks. Her father. Fred. Dumbledore. Hedwig, might be. Charity Burbage. Mad-Eye. Cedric. Dobby, finally Free. Colin Creevey would be there--she'd let him take as many photos with her as he wanted.
An anonymous tip--they got those all the time, but what was it about this one that Kingsley was so certain warranted an investigation? She supposed, based on the nature of the case, it was imperative that they followed-up on any and every possible lead in case one of them just happened to unearth something they could use.
The Healer helped her drink a calming draught after a brief explanation that it was the only potion able to help, coupled with cooling charms. Harriet didn’t attempt to speak again, but she did feel a relaxation in her limbs and a dullness that replaced the tension, which seemed to also dull the consistent buzz of pain. She closed her eyes briefly, inhale exhale, and opened them again.
"I was never diagnosed."
Kinglsey sighed and turned to him, "Draco is a Ministry asset. I've privately contracted his services. As a private investigator, he possesses a multitude of skills, one of them being tracking. Since he's joined us, the number of close calls in which we've almost captured Mulciber and Dolohov have nearly tripled. Our 'anonymous tip' of course, came from him."
be the death of me.”
“Oh, so sorry. I forget I need to be less jolly so early in the morning,” she apologized quickly, walking to Draco’s bedside, heels clicking the floor with each step.
Potter want Draco
(Same note from the beginning- I'm shamelessly fishing for comments as well as promoting my other in progress works)
“No need, she’s the reason I’m doing this. I want to start over with you. I remember how much of an arse I was that first day at Hogwarts, and more so after that of course. But it was the worst first impression I could have given you, and obviously it led to everything we’ve been through over the years,” Draco rambled on. “I want to introduce myself as the Draco Malfoy that I want to be, not that pompous, cocky eleven-year-old Draco Malfoy that was being spoon-fed lies about everything. So,” Draco said and held out a hand to shake. “Hi, I’m Draco Malfoy, I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life that I’m not proud of, but I have a lot to offer. I would love to be friends with the one and only Harry Potter, if he’ll have me.”
Granger looked at him with disapproval. If Draco hadn’t been so upset over the situation, he might have apologized about snapping at her so much.
Draco startled as a slick
, Draco jumped out of his bed (more like a slab with a blanket) and was brought face-to-face with his usual guard.
The days went by quickly, Grimmauld Place full of last minute adjustments to the party schedule from the party committee over tea, most days leading late into the nights and soon enough it was the day before the party and Draco was more nervous than he had anticipated.
Draco makes it two days after his talk with Granger without incident. On the third day, Draco’s body is shutting down.
“Oh? How so?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
wasn’t really the word for it. Surviving? No. Merely just
Kreacher informs Draco on the fourth morning in bed that he will be seeing Dr. Inkwood that afternoon. So Draco accepts Kreacher’s help, along with Fissy, in getting him into better looking shape. They dress him in dark slacks and a nice button up shirt. He was in desperate need of a shave. Looking like a caveman isn’t how he wants his first mind healer appointment to go. He wants to make a good impression on this doctor and hopefully she will see what a big farce it is that she was even owled into the situation.
Of course he was being sent to Azkaban. There was never a doubt in his mind that he wouldn’t be sent to rot in the most desolate place imaginable. The only time Draco ever let himself get his hopes up for anything different was when he was in this exact room, two weeks ago, being told he would be released to the Manor for house arrest. And now those hopes were being chewed up and spat out, all thanks to his loving father.
“Young Mr. Malfoy, you have been summoned from your temporary dwelling to be made aware of the decision that has been made for your subsequent sentencing,” Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister for Magic, spoke. “As you are now aware, you are unable to return to your previous residence of Malfoy Manor. It comes with no personal amusement or benefit to make you aware that the only chances of you not being sent to Azkaban, alongside your father, have taken a rather cosmic plummet, all thanks to the aforementioned.”
The aura of Grimmauld Place had shifted in the days leading up to Potter’s birthday. The house creaked less at night, and the people (Draco’s ancestors) in the portraits on the wall chided at passers by less often. Draco even noticed, oddly enough, that the house seemed to breathe a sigh of relief when it was full of chatting people; shuddering, almost as to thank the occupants for their presence.
The view of Draco’s face caused the Minister to give a quick, deep chuckle towards the lanky blond as they made eye contact with each other.
“Good morning, handsome,” Draco greeted back, kissing Harry’s chest before checking his watch. “It’s just after 8, thought we could have a bite to eat in bed before we head out?” he pointed to the steaming tea and toast, having put a stasis charm over it to keep it warm.
Now the pieces were fitting together as Draco got closer and closer. Someone in his extended family, mother’s side of course, had given their home as a replacement for the house arrest location. 12 Grimmauld Place was in fact the ancestral home of the Black family. His mother was Narcissa Black before her marriage to Lucius Malfoy. That part made sense, but why was his sentence reduced so significantly? And why had Minister Shacklebolt referred to one of his relatives as the savior?
“Why are you here?” Draco asked as Clementine was rereading some of the notes that the quill had made.
could possibly do. Nothing was in his control, nothing was going his way, and nothing would work out for him, Draco had decided upon hearing the news that he was going to need another trial, and his previously decided fate had been nullified by means of mistrial.
“I won’t be upset for the nickname if you bring me upstairs right now,” Draco whispered against Harry’s lips. This elicited an eager groan from Harry, who leaned forward to lift Draco up into his arms, supporting his bum in his strong hands. Draco moaned into the embrace and felt butterflies in his stomach again as he was apparated into their bedroom. Fuck, he loved it when Harry showed off his strength and impressive magical skill.

“No,” Potter decided. “I think it will be good for you to have her here.”
“Draco,” Potter nodded, shaking his hand. “I’m Harry Potter, nice to meet you. I’d absolutely love to be friends with you,” Potter said and smiled.
“Stop calling me that, Harry. Or I’ll revoke sex privileges for the next week,” Draco warned.
Suddenly, from two doors down, Potter flew out of his room and practically ran into Draco in his attempt to follow the noise, stopping short when he saw Draco’s stilled body.
“Mmm good morning, m' love,” Harry greeted, stretching a bit and suppressing a yawn with the back of his hand. “What time ‘s it?” he asked, laying an arm over his face to block the light filtering in between the shades.
“So. Where shall we begin?”
When it was time for his appointment with Dr. Inkwood, Draco was summoned to the garden. Draco was thankful to get out of the house, and Kreacher had helped him there. Draco couldn’t help but notice there were no signs of Potter on his way outside.
“Good day, Mr. Potter,” the shortest woman spoke. “We spoke earlier in the floo, I am Auror Harrissa Brynan, to my left is Auror Florence Fluke, and to my right is Auror Carrunia Joro,” Auror Brynan introduced, and it gave Draco a slight sense of relief to at least finally know the names of his escorts.
Once Draco had given every account of his past that he could remember, it was his turn to ask questions. It was only fair, he thought.
“Tell me what you want, Drake, baby. Wanna hear you,” Harry was leaving kitten licks all over Draco’s skin, and the blond man was absolutely drowning in Harry’s lust.
“Oh, Harry,” Draco choked out, obviously becoming emotional at Harry’s words. Normally, Draco didn’t wear his heart on his sleeve, and neither did Harry. But here and now, with so much love in the air and nothing to lose by letting go, neither man had it in them to hide the tears that they shared together. It was always sickeningly obvious to others just how much the pair loved each other.
to a Death Eater descendant of more Death Eaters?
Potter eventually gave the okay to release Fissy from her bindings. Kreacher begrudgingly did as he was told. Once freed from the ropes, Fissy immediately apparated across the room to stand in front of Draco with a quiet
. Harry mutters
Draco nodded. It was one of the few forms of communication Draco had granted towards the master of the house. He hadn’t spoken a single word to Potter in the entire time that he had been staying at 12 Grimmauld Place. This weekend marked exactly one month since moving in, and Draco still couldn’t get used to being in the presence of Harry Potter every bloody day. It was like torture, being made to cohabitate with the man he swore to never see again.
The next few weeks pass rather smoothly. Granger sets up camp in Potter’s library, working tirelessly for any clue how to deal with the ‘soul bond’ as everyone is now referring to it. Each day, Granger would report to Potter and Draco separately-as they haven’t spoken a word to each other (Potter’s birthday gift stowed away in Draco’s sock drawer). Draco did his best to help with the research, picking through the texts that felt a bit outdated, maybe even archaic. He mostly tried to absorb what Granger bestowed on him, but noticed his energy levels were draining as the weeks wore on. His muscles feeling numb on occasion, and a constant throb in his temple were the most irksome to Draco.

the time.
Draco again had all eyes on him. Even Kreacher, who had
back into the room to check if anybody would like to stay for dinner. Draco hummed, taken aback by the idea of being accepted into Potter’s social circle. Were they really doing this out of the kindness or their hearts?
“Oh, Master Malfoy! Sir!” the bound house elf sobbed out, tears flowing down her cheeks.
It had been awkward the first time Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley had visited after Draco became a semi-permanent inhabitant of 12 Grimmauld. He had quickly ran up to his room on the second floor, but could occasionally hear the trio from a floor below, their voices and sometimes laughter drifting up the staircase into Draco’s room. He since spends most of their visits blocking out voices and focusing on whatever book he had found that day in the library.
“So, uh where to begin?” Granger asked aloud. “Well, Harry’s birthday is in a few weeks and we were coming over to make plans for a little get together here. It’s his first since..” Granger broke off her sentence. Nobody needed to be explicitly told what she was referring to. Draco had already had his. His first birthday since the War. It was spent awaiting his fate from Wizengamot. He’d been arrested in May and his sentence was pushed to his 18th birthday. Draco thought maybe the court waited the extra two months so they could give him a heavier sentence, but things had made an unexpected turn.
I live for comments of any kind.. please let me know what you think!!!
Draco cleared his throat and regained his composure. “Well, I suppose I could do with a firewhiskey or two,” he said with a smirk and a wink.
Draco was hoping Potter didn’t see his wink. Potter was just here merely asking Draco to not be so uptight and high strung at his party and here Draco was practically screaming out to Potter
“You’re fighting it,” Granger commented one day while Draco made tea in the kitchen. She hadn’t found much information the past consecutive days. She had been watching him closer day by day, though. That’s how Draco found himself cornered in the room with her.
Looking further around the room, Draco sees that his room has been altered. He can clearly see that it is his room with the tell-tale haze of magical charms floating around. The charms are some sort of transfiguration, making the space more resemble a hospital suite than a bedroom. Even his bed has been modified, with rails on the edge of the queen sized mattress.
Draco had never seen a mind healer. The closest thing he had gotten to mental health care was at the Ministry when he was arrested and examined
blotchy skin.
Draco didn’t have words. He wouldn’t have spoken them even if he could formulate any utterance. His only words being spoken since the Battle had merely been identifying himself when he was arrested on Hogwarts grounds after all the smoke had cleared and the slew of Aurors appeared.
, Harry licked his licks and grinned wickedly up at Draco who was panting and trying to come back down to Earth after the mind-blowing sex.
Harry snaked a hand beneath Draco and began tugging lightly at his cock, following the same pattern as his tongue.
Draco’s eyes began rolling into his head, full body spasms wreaking havoc on his slim body, thrashing still in fear, sheets soaked in tears and sweat. His vision fades as two tall figures approach him. There are voices calling to him, but he can’t respond. A shadow falls upon him, and Draco welcomes it; the darkness taking him away from his pain and letting himself plummet down into the realm of unconsciousness.
Draco sighed. Of course Potter was going to limit his use of the potion. It was highly addictive, even to someone who didn’t have mental trauma that kept them awake until the wee hours of the morning. It was Thursday, or maybe it was Friday now that it was the middle of the night, and he had already used both of his weekly allowances, leaving him stranded until he was allowed another two for the week starting on Sunday.
Draco had revealed this to Clementine, though he left out the more gruesome bits, preferring to not sound as damaged as he felt. He felt it was enough of him to tell her his life story, as she had requested to start from the very beginning, as far back as his thoughts could go. He had offered to use a pensieve, claiming it would be more accurate, but Clementine had said that they wouldn’t use the pensieve until later on, if at all.
“Hey, now that’s the spirit!” Potter quickly saved Draco from his own thoughts.
Draco cleared his throat, “I wanted to apologize on behalf of Fissy and myself. I was unaware she would show up and I can see that it has caused an unnecessary snag in your life. I will send her away at once to avoid any more upheaval in your home.” Draco almost felt sick at apologizing.
that you’ve been begging to see for weeks now, or have you come to your senses and decided you’d rather save me the bore and see something worthwhile?” Draco reminded, poking at Harry’s sides, causing him to burst into giggles and Harry flipped them over to pin Draco to the bed by his wrists.
“Harry, that mouth of yours is sinful,” Draco murmured into the pillows. “It
“Right back at ya, Drake,” Harry smiled dopily.
“Kreacher does not deserves Master Black- er Malfoy- giving him helps. Kreacher doesn’t wants Master Malfoy to lie for him,” Kreacher teetered between relief and pain, wanting to please both his masters, but Draco knew he couldn’t disobey Potter.
Granger’s eyes looked like they were close to popping out of her head as she spun to face Draco who had been sitting on the armchair reading some new herbal potions text he had found that morning.
’s back and forth.
Pulling off with a
With a sigh, Draco said what he’s always thought about himself. “I think the wizarding world was so caught up with the Boy Who Lived, that they didn’t see the ‘Boy Who Didn’t Have a Choice’. I always felt like the victim of a twisted joke, but nobody seemed to understand me. I know it sounds conceited, ‘woe is me’ and all that. But I’ve had to live so much of my life in evil’s shadow that I can’t possibly ever be seen as good. No matter what I’ve done, I’ll always be ‘Draco Malfoy the Death Eater son of Death Eater Lucius Malfoy’,” Draco rubbed his hands over his face, feeling light headed as the words rushed from him. “Harry Potter is what you’d call ‘good’. I couldn’t ever be compared fairly to him. He defeated Voldemort, afterall.”
Friday morning arrived and Draco got up early to make Harry breakfast in bed. He wanted to go all out for his husband, but he knew the man could barely stomach more than tea and toast before 9 am so that’s exactly what he made. He could have had Kreacher make the breakfast, but he wanted it to be special. Plus the old house elf never got over the fact that Draco sold Malfoy Manor, stating that such an heirloom should have been kept in the family. He didn’t want to bother the aging elf.
Harry moaned at the pull of his hair and gave everything he had in him, ignoring the ache in his jaw and quickened his hand jerking.
He’s about to drift into a dream when suddenly the sound of knuckles rapping on the door in quick succession echo through the room. “Good morning, Draco!” a cheery black haired lady chimes loudly, as she walks in from the hallway. Her voice split into Draco’s head, and slightly startled the man, causing a groan to escape him.
Draco let his mind slip to thoughts of the alternative route his life could have taken. If it hadn’t been for Potter, he wouldn’t be able to experience this garden. Instead he would have been locked up in a dingy cell surrounded by death and despair. Clementine brought him back from his thoughts.
Draco set the tray of food down on the bed-side table and perched himself next to Harry. He traced his fingers down Harry’s abdomen and back up to his rising and falling chest. Draco reached his hands up to run along Harry’s strong jawline, admiring the pout of his lips each time a snore escaped his mouth.
At the exposure of Draco’s milky skin, Harry broke the kiss off to trail wet nibbles down Draco’s jaw and down his neck. When he got to Draco’s midsection, Harry made sure to give extra attention to the scars that he had left on Draco’s body all those years ago with the damned dark magic curse. He always gave more attention to those scars, he’ll never forgive himself for almost taking the life of his beloved husband back in sixth year with the
“You’re trying to fight the bond, in your mind. But your soul is where your magic comes from, and that’s where the bond is. The more you ignore the bond, the more your magic will drain, which will affect you physically. You’ll be more agitated, moody and will become tired more frequently. I didn’t think you’d be this far gone with the withdrawals, though,” Granger said, tapping her fingers against the wood of the table.
Potter took his wand out and tipped his head in a
“Why are you here, though?” Potter asked, “Why have you broken into my home?” Looking around, the kitchen looks like it had been burgled.
Potter
Usual disclaimers apply.
The papers reported on the event for weeks. The public was pleasantly distracted. Spirits were up-lifted in the name of hero's getting together and wearing fancy clothes.
Chambers and Coote had managed to round up the fourth, but Harriet could barely see what was going on for the pain was all consuming and seemed to be getting worse.
"Harry? Might I ask what it is you're accomplishing like that?"
The last time she remembered speaking to Draco was after the trials where she'd spoken on behalf of him and his mother. She had been unable to bring herself to speak for the Malfoy Patriarch, as his crimes went beyond that of his kin. But her testimony had lessened his sentence from 15 years, to ten with the potential for parole after five, and Draco's reduced from five years in Azkaban, to three years of probation. If she remembered correctly, Malfoy had told her to "stop meddling" and to "stop being a hero" because he didn't want her help anymore. She wondered if he felt the same now that he was finally off the hook.
Usual disclaimers apply. Happy reading!
"We don't have time for a pissing contest, Weasley. Ask the Minister when we get back to London--" Draco snapped, flicking his wand and muttering a few counter-curses under his breath, "This is all I can do here, we've got to get her--"
Even Snape.
Hermione chimed in, “Quite ingenious, really. With his...personal experience and insight. Of course, for publicity reasons, his name can’t be formally attached to the Ministry but, well, he doesn’t seem to care about that at all.”
Harriet was numb.
Harry opened her eyes and tried to sit up.
All her life she'd thought she was supposed to be an auror. That she was meant for it. And, well, she supposed at one time she had been. At one point, her entire life revolved around eradicating the darkness from the world. Being a "hero" or "the Chosen One". She had never pictured a life in which she had other options. She'd never been able to picture a life in which Voldemort didn't exist. A world where she was free.
“I’ve been working on a few things I want to speak with Healer Entwhistle about, we should be able to break it by tomorrow and get you out of here...though, from what the Minister’s been saying, I think you’ve been put on a temporary leave.”
He was curious, though he hardly put it past Potter to get herself into more trouble
"Harriet!" Ron shouted after her in warning, "On your left!"
She snapped at him and stood, with one last glare and a roll of her eyes, Harriet turned on her heel and swept out of the pub without a look behind her. It was only when she had made it across the street and there was more than enough distance between them did Harriet realize she'd left her purse on the back of her chair inside. She groaned and raised a hand to her face.
Harriet gnawed at her bottom lip and took a deep breath, "It's stupid but...could we switch seats?" She felt ashamed for even saying it aloud, but if she didn't, this encounter wouldn't be any fun at all, for either of them. She expected Malfoy to mock her, but the other just stood and held his chair out for her to sit before he took place in the other, "Sorry."
"What? No--"
That had been surprisingly easy.
Harry finally left, then, only to run into a flustered looking Ron and Hermione, who looked immensely relieved on spotting her.
"Malfoy, stop--"
Harry shook her head and laughed gently over Hermione's shoulder as Ron mimed that she was cut off, "Ron was right. It's a tough day. Merlin, when did he get so wise?" Ron pretended to be offended as he offered his arms to both of them before leading them back into the Great Hall.
He was there, she had seen him.
"No, nothing at all," his sarcasm was all it took to send her over the edge. Harry shoved Malfoy hard, causing him to hit the brick wall of the building behind them. He was raising his eyebrows at her and holding up his hands as if claiming his innocence. The smirk on his face suggested otherwise.
As always, the weekend went by far too quickly. Come Monday, Harriet was sitting at her desk, slouched so far down in her chair that she was nearly invisible to the naked eye behind her paperwork (which she always let build up like this). She wondered how long she could get away with this disappearing act before someone came looking for her and tried to get her to stand in the Atrium and answer questions for reporters--a ploy to pull positive public attention and lessen the spotlight on the fact that Antonin Dolohov and Fenrir Greyback were still as evasive as ever and had even begun attacking small muggle villages across Great Britain.
She turned--
"Will someone please tell me what the bloody fuck is going on?" Ron wondered incredulously, taking the pause in conversation as an invitation to interject. He'd watched the casual exchange between Malfoy and the Minister long enough, and still wasn't sure why everyone was looking at him like he had three heads.
"What's wit' all t'new faces this week, Lem?"
Today, she felt eyes on her--but that was typical. Every year the Gala was the same. Speakers gave a speech and she was expected to lead them all in a toast before they were supposed to eat, drink, and be some form of merry. This year, her "toast" had consisted of her raising her glass with a "To those we've lost" and leaving the dais as quickly as they'd pulled her onto it. Kingsley never minded her short toasts, she knew that he thought this whole pomp and circus act was ridiculous and an absolute waste of time. But as Minister, he had certain expectations to uphold.
I softly place a hand on his shoulder, "hey none of that talk of loosing me, I won't abandon you Blaise. Say what you have to, even if that means I get roughed up by your body guards, it doesn't change anything. I'm very good at spells so I can protect myself, you protect yourself by acting the part of Slytherins ice prince alright? We can even plan fights and duels ahead if we need to, were in this together you and I."
The night is peaceful with the soft breathing coming from Harry, and yet despite being warm and comforted by his presence before returning to that prison of a manor. All I can think about are all of my favorite memories with Tom.
I laughed and stood up with her in my arms and spun around making her giggle. I set her down grinning and turned to Blaise, who was watching with wide eyes and his mouth wide open. I laughed and introduced them to each other. Daisy was ecstatic to meet, "My Draco's best friend".
Wait.......WHAT?! Oh god no I have to fix this I can't change the time line too much or I won't know what happens in the future! "W-wait professor I can't play, really I um I would love to believe me, more than anything but I can't. I have err" think Draco think! What problem do  you have that could stop you from playing? Wait I know! -"I have anemia! Yup and its not recommended I play sports and besides I'm sure Katie bell is a great chaser, and you only have a seeker position open, and I would hate to take away a players passion."
It's finally troll day today, and I'm trying to figure out exactly what's supposed to happen. All I know is that Quirrell is the reason for the troll and that everyone was evacuated by house. I'm guessing that the golden trio was somehow involved in this whole mess because everything happens to them.
I furrow my brows, "You must be exhausted. Try to get some rest yeah?"
Thoughts of what he's seen float across my mind and I can't help but hate the world for causing him to go through this. To go through this because of one person. The same one who killed my parents. The same one who caused Draco's family to break into pieces even before he was born. I hated him for everything he's done to me and Draco, and there's no telling what Draco has witnessed, been through, or the horror he must have felt for hours at a time for who knows how long.
We both headed down as she asked how I had gotten all of the stuff.
I motion with my head to him and Draco smiled walking steadily to the dog making me hurry after him. Once we got there the dog seemed extremely suspicious but wagged his tail when I came close. Draco unwrapped the breadsticks and offered one to the black dog. Immediately it began to eat and at the reaction Draco gave the dog all five in the bag, while petting him despite the fur being matted and dirty. I smiled warmly at the scene and joined him.
"Hey, I need to go down to get........ er a lesson of sorts. So I'll be back later okay."
After I finished Hermione swatted at me and told me off for getting injured by the Cerberus and proceeded to try and unrobe my shirt and tie to see. I managed to keep them from seeing the injury and fight off her actions in half hearted movements and laughter. From there I had told them I planned on mapping out the challenges much to their protests. I just rolled my eyes and told them that it was the best move we could make. Ron, Neville and Hermione were against the idea and didn't understand why this was even a good idea. Only Harry had agreed and knew it was probably needed if I said it was, though he wanted to go along with me. I just remained stubborn in doing it alone and Harry was not happy.
"The whip is cursed so that magic can't heal the wounds according to my diagnostic spells. So I'm going to stitch you up and put salves on it."
"Yes!"
"I wish there was something to help you sleep more Draco, your looking a bit pale. You are eating enough right? I know that the loud noise in the great hall puts you on edge really bad."
Not more than a few minutes later the door opens to reveal a certain red head. " hey errr is it alright if I sit here? It's full everywhere else." I nod my acceptance after Harry looks at me in silent question. Ron sits down, "thanks, I'm Ron Weasley by the way". Harry spoke up then, "I'm Harry Potter an-" "your Harry Potter?!"
"It's only the scratch on my face and a clipped shoulder since the club and rubble hit me."
All I can do is sob as I cling onto him in any way.
I got over my momentary shock just in time to pluck both items from him and became his personal hair assistant in under a second. I towel dried his hair softly and he just laughed while leaning into the touch. After I carefully brushed out his silver locks I became acquainted with his soft hums and sighs of satisfaction. Finally once I was done I ran my fingers into his hair to let it dry in the slightly messy style I liked on him so much. He tilted his head back to see my own face sort of playfully and I had to resist the urge of touching his soft lips with mine.
“Anyways my point is, being able to talk to a snake isn't evil, its a gift."
I'm walking down a corridor when I spot a door and feel myself inching closer automatically without thought. I go through it and see a giant mirror in an abandoned room. I raise my eyebrows at such a sight before carefully going up to the ornate mirror. There are words at the top that I can't really understand the meaning of, but it doesn't stop me from standing right in front.
"So how do you feel about being my non blood brother because I quite like that idea?" He laughs and nods his head yes.
"Harry! I- Oh My Merlin it was Pettigrew! Now everything makes sense. Yes!"
"so Ron do you finally admit you have feelings for Mione?"
It gives me a warm feeling as we both make our way to the table after Pansy waves us to it.
"Thanks Harry, oh and I like your sleeping pants. Do try to not seduce Draco while I'm gone."
He understood what was at stake here more than Harry, because if something were to go wrong, Blaise could be on the chopping block for the dark mark much faster. I have no doubts about that. Age doesn't matter to Voldemort only what you have to offer. A scared child with abusive parents would still give up their wants and morals to keep themselves and their parents alive despite what others would think, especially children who make choices using logic rather than emotions.
That despite all the odds I fell in love with him.
Good bye my dear friend, perhaps in a different life we can meet again.
I smile and then Sev brings up something. "Draco I didn't know you had anemia?"
I hear a feminine sigh before she continues.
”They were his best friends and his only family after his real family burned his picture off of the family tree. You see My mother is a black, which means Sirius is my cousin of sorts, more like an uncle in my eyes but you get the point. You two aren't blood related but your mum and dad wanted him to be your godfather.”
His voice wavered with such deep emotion but I couldn't do much other than whisper, "it's alright, it will be fine Harry. Don't worry. Everything's going to be alright. I don't want you to be sorry okay?"
"Oh Merlin don't encourage them! It'll be a nightmare in third year!"
He immediately shuts his mouth with an audible click as Severus gives a deep chuckle. I give him a smile as I leave his embrace and he informs us that we should let Draco rest here until he wakes up. We all nod knowing he will be in safe hands with the dour potions professor and we all made our goodbyes to our sleeping friend.
I hear my name before I'm back in the manor, Greyback laughing and crawling on all fours like some rabid dog.
Draco's : POV
I run my hands through his hair and agree with his request. He closes his eyes and enjoys the feeling of someone caressing his hair with a smile. It makes me think of how starved he is of affection and care.
"yes, Please."
Sitting here on the front steps of the manor, I watch as the sun rises casting the most beautiful rays of colors across my skin. I never knew how such simple things could be what I most look forward to, until everything I thought I knew was just ripped out at the roots. That everything you where told was a lie, and as time goes by you even begin to notice that something isn't right. That you were wrong. You don't know anything anymore, maybe you never did, and you don't know what you should do to fix it. But your in too deep, and your loved ones are on the line.
I felt like I was punched in the gut. This. This was the reason he went insane? Because he was so desperately frightened for his life that he found any way to ensure his survival. Because Dumbledoor refused to help children stay safe?
Once the dog was done eating he nuzzled into Draco and then did the same to me. I didn't want to leave him now that he was so happy with company, so I looked imploringly at Draco who just smirked at the look.
We wait in silence for the balm to soak into his skin and Severus dabs a special tonic on the gashes, only for the wounds to shrink and become nonexistent. No scarring left on his skin. And I let out a relived breath knowing that this wouldn't be another thing for Draco to dislike about himself. I grin at the sight of his now healed face and unconsciously run up to Severus throwing my arms around his torso.
I smile as I remember the old me smuggling care for magical creatures books from the library and copying them so that I could write notes in it and keep my parents from knowing I had them. At that Hagrid relaxed a bit and I could see he was giving me a chance. Hagrid nodded a yes so Harry and I turn to each other, me with a small smile and Harry grinning and holding his hand in the air in front of me. I look at him questioningly and tilt my head to the side and press my hand against his lightly when he laughs and shakes his head. "It's like this Draco , keep your hand still I'm going to slap it" and a smack sound came from the impact. "It's called a high five, it's what you do when something succeeds or turns in your favor." My mouth goes into an o shape as I nod along, and Harry just links his arm with mine as we follow Hagrid into the bookstore. Harry is about to lick his ice cream when he looks at me and offers some to me. I just tell him I'm alright and to enjoy it. He's still hesitant but as we collect our books he's happily devouring it. He's so thin, he needs to eat more. Before, I used to think he had an eating disorder because he would eat so much at school and was thin. But then I noticed he only came back thin after the summer. So I realized that for some reason his food was restricted during the time he was away from school. I'll have to make sure he gets enough food from now on, he could easily out grow me if he has a good intake of nutrients from now on.
I'm about to call it quits when a golden brown owl comes soaring through the air only to stop in front of me. I grin knowing its from madam Flores. I give the owl a treat as I release the shrunken packages it's been holding. I softly caress his feathers earning a coo of affection as he cuddles onto the side of my face. I chuckle at his actions before petting him once more as he nips my ear in a goodbye. He leaves with a flutter of his feathers and he's gone in a flash of gold.
I furrow my eyebrows at hearing this. "How was this curse even put on you?"
I was desperate to find an answer.
"I'm sorry."
“Also Light wizards and dark wizards aren't synonyms for good and bad, it just means some wizards have an affinity for light or dark magic. Just because a spell is dark like a cutting curse doesn't mean it's used for evil. It all depends on the intent behind the curse, are you using the cutting curse on a person or for potions class on ingredients? The world isn't just black and white! It's grey as well and too many people aren't aware of the grey. I want to change this. I want us all to be better, to know more, to be aware of all the options we have to be great in life. And that is why I'm helping you, Zabini, because I know deep inside of you, your just waiting for the right opportunity to live freely. To not have to fight, to not be under your mothers thumb. And I will help you be who you really want to be. No matter how hard the road is, I will be here."
We nod and after getting nods from the others he leaves to check up on the other students.
Draco shakes his head, "Not yet. I'm getting lessons at the moment."
"How about at 9 in the astronomy tower? No one should be there at that time but, hmmm here give me a sec."
"How about we stop for tonight? I'll tell you some more on the weekend......... It'll be our last weekend here before we go back."
I'm laying down content with just looking at the stars and exchanging smiles with the blonde boy next to me as he points out constellations. When I'm ripped out of the peaceful scene of my dreams to hear a scream. I bolt up in my bed to see the others in a similar state. All while there is the feeling of fear that seems to permeate thickly in the room.
D:[ there's
I smile at him and Harry seems content at being able to know what happened.
When the chicken was done I looked for the connecting picnic baskets. It made me a little queazy thinking about the similarity between the picnic baskets and the vanishing cabinet, but I pushed the thought away and focused on putting the food in glass containers. I get silverware, napkins, a glass cup and a fancy glass bottle of pumpkin juice, with sticking notes telling him what everything was. I then added treacle tart that the guys made earlier at the last second. I showed them and when they gave the agreeing nod I released a breath and smiled. I thanked them and promised to come in after dinner to help them with anything they need. As well as to come see me if they got injured or were punished, they agreed hesitantly but still accepted my help. Before I could leave though Mimzy called my name and I gave her a proud beaming smile making her blush as she handed me two books. They read , 'cooking the muggle way from beginner to expert levels', and 'cooking the wizarding way from beginner to expert levels'. I thanked her and gave her a hug as I left with the picnic basket in hand. I shrunk it and charmed it to resize itself when it arrived to its destination, knowing that Harry wouldn't know how to do magic yet.
"Ahhh you've already been here before young Malfoy"
He shakes his head and continues talking to siren as I turn to Neville and ask how he’s coming along in his magic using his real wand. He goes into a long ramble on it and some new plants he's come across.
I nod and give him my best smile, "Thank you Sev, it's okay. Just go for it."
But as I look at the bed the dog became a person who looked worse for wear.
Well at least I'm not disowned yet, that's a plus. Though I'll need to pack a shit ton of strength potions and pepper ups for the summer. I can already tell I'm going to be hexed and cursed daily. I just pass the note to Hermione since she's practically burning a hole through my head with the intensity of her stare. She just gasps and looks about to cry making me flounder and patt her hand to comfort her. She passes the note to Ron and he just looks angry as he hands it Harry. Once Harry's done he looks at the letter hatefully and I pass it to Neville, and he just looks at the letter offended and hugs me.
Harrys eyes are full of indignant anger at the scene and Ron just wears an unsettled look of distaste worthy of a gold medal in my opinion. By this point the rest of the Weasley's have joined us and are wearing what I call their battle faces. I just watch the match between Ron's father and Lucius with sharp eyes and find that my gaze lingers at Ginny's cauldron.
Which made me grimace and nod, "Yes my back is...... well you'll see. It's obvious what made them."
I smile at them saying, "don't worry about it guys, I've lived with them for my whole life yeah? And look how I turned out! I think I'm alright."
"Alright this is going to sound crazy but bare with me. Draco is from a different time line, or something like that and in his original timeline he was 18. The thing is there is a war that will happen in the future so he came back to this time in order to help us."
the research Tom and I have, then cross referencing everything, just to be sure.
-death eaters escape Azkaban
Draco was sitting quietly, thinking about what I'd just said when the food appeared in front of us. He gracefully ignored how I jumped at the food and gave me a nod before saying,
He pops right next to me and he begins to anxiously look over me before wordlessly apparating us into my bedroom. He doesn't hesitate to put me on my bed and I smile gratefully to him as I thank him. And through his tears he begins to undo the buttons on my torn and bloodied shirt. He removes my shoes and socks as well all while I drowsily try to reassure him I'll be fine through his tears.
"It's a shame such a bright talented boy has such a sickness, don't worry I'll make sure it's kept a secret. I know how the Slytherin students would try to take advantage of it."
Neville was always the most visibly effected by what happens to Draco and so I made sure to be by his side whenever something like this occurred. He always appreciated it and I never minded him being a highly sensitive person. (Someone affected/ more in tune to other peoples emotions)
She immediately got that sparkle in her eyes that every woman got when I put on my pure blood etiquette, whether they were a server or an influencers wife. She had this slight pink hue to her cheeks as she practically cooed at me.
He looks so excited as he grins and thanks McGonagall and Wood for this chance and we both make our way to dinner since we missed charms, thank god for it being excused.
- cursed neckslace; Katie bell
"Thank you uncle Sev, I also thought you might want this" I said and hand him the letter from father.
All I can do is yell "what is going on?!"
I stand patiently on the train platform waiting for the others to come with a small cunning smile. Harry arrives first and tells me that Black is currently still in Harry's room at the Leaky cauldron until his name is cleared. I just smile and say,
I said goodbye and Draco waved gratefully at the headmasters back somewhat reluctantly. I knew he had conflicting feelings for the older wizard but never knew why until last year when we found out about Tom's story. And now even I had a certain dislike for the older man especially with all the similarities both Tom and I have, as both of us grew up in a hateful environment and were refused help from any adult.
At that news the Italian gives a sharp smirk with mirth filled eyes, "definitely, lover boy. I'm at your service and gracefully decide to take up this oh so important role for you, true slytherin ice prince."
I just say, "I'm apparently an abnormally fast learner, but Blaise that's not what I want to talk to you about. Look I don't want to be fighting with you, I don't want to be your enemy. But I understand, I get it if you have to say horrible things to me in public. Trust me I know, so can we have a truce between us? I want to be your friend Blaise. A friendship where there's trust going both ways not just one, where we help each other not to gain, but because we care about each other, and have a chance at happiness. Even if you aren't sure lets just give it a shot, what do you say? Friends?"
As I enter the dark shop filled to the brim with book shelves and other nicknacks related to reading and writing I make my way to the magical artifact section. After a while of looking I pick out a book that caught my eye, it's about the most powerful artifacts known and ones that are myth with detailed information on each one. So I flip through it and in the myth section I find the double pendulum. Yup I'm getting this. I look for a while longer and grab one on famous inventors of known artifacts. I leave that section and browse through ancient texts for something interesting when I come across a book in a foreign language. It has a lock and snakes decorate the cover, I try an unlocking spell but when I do it hisses and I realize it's parseltongue. I'm not sure whether I should get it but I decide to get it for Harry and give it to him later on. Now the last thing I need is to get a journal only I can open. I go to the journal section and ask which journal is the most secure. The seller motions to a row of leather bound journals with a flat smooth circle lock, it almost looks like a tiny mirror. He explains that to own the journal you need to cut your finger and let the blood soak the lock and press your finger to it so that its keyed to only you. Though you can also give permission for someone else to use it, all you'd need to do is add their blood and print to the lock as well right after the owner does it.
Mione says and it's then that I turn to face them and they take in the redness on my face. She starts to giggle and Neville joins her. Harry just looks slightly shocked and Ron is pouting as he glances to Mione.
It only took me a second for it to click and then we saw the troll. It bellowed and Hermione screamed. I got in front of her and put up a shield around her with a wave of my hand as I got out my wand for more precision.
"desperate times called for desperate measures. I needed things to be kept a secret if I helped prisoners in the cells. They needed healing and food, I couldn't just leave them there alone. I learned how to do this out of desperation, my magic understood and helped me. When I do wandless and wordless magic I'm not actually thinking or saying a spell, I just will my magic to do something and it does it. The only thing I can think to name it is core magic."
I decide to give her a salute as a thank you, which made her mouth pinch slightly at the corners and turn towards her office as quickly and as sharply as she could, with an overly cheerful farewell to Harry. I know I shouldn't feel amused by annoying her but I couldn't help the feeling of wanting to laugh. Harry gave me a look of, 'we're going to talk about this right?' and I just indulge him with a,
Harry said,
As soon as I was out and turned into the first hallway where I knew he would be he quickly let his mask fall to show his absolute worry and guilt.
I have tears running down my face but Blaise just keeps holding me and I thank him. "Don't thank me Draco, thank you for coming back. Thank you for coming to help us and.........for saving me. Don't think I haven't figured out why your helping me, I have a feeling I would have ended up just like you. Lost and forced to do things that would tear me apart. And you could have left me and let me go down that dark path but you didn't. You saved me. And I swear we are in this together no matter what."
I slip the book into my bag with no one but Ginny knowing and go back to Harry and Ron's side as I catch Harry's questioning gaze.
"What he means is that if he pushes himself too much he faints. And I don't know how much he can handle, for all I know he might not be able to run half a mile before fainting."
This is how we spent the day together and it was one of my favorites. It was nearing the night and for some reason Draco didn't want to leave the room so I quickly volunteered to stay with him. The others sent me smirks before making a show of rushing out of there for “our privacy”. Blaise sent Draco a wink and a finger gun motion making Draco's face flush violet. He rolled his eyes, pouting, after Blaise left and then motioned to the book at me.
"Okay um well I wanted to give you something and I didn't really want to have an audience...... err anyways here."
I make my way up there and sit back. As the hat gets set on my head I immediately hear the voice just like the first time.
He sighs and his giant glowing green orbs stare right into my own aged silver ones, making my heart stop and give me doubt. Should I tell him?
I know they will accept because they would do anything to take back something that is originally theirs. So I smirk and continue the horcrux research instead.
Sirius tries so hard not to laugh and I just grin at him.
He trusted me and I was relieved at having someone who just wanted to talk about normal everyday things, and the once in a while basking in the others comfort when we remember our home life. He was there for me when Sev took out the stitches in my back, and he was the one to help me put salves on it to this day. He made sure I got some mother henning from him as well as teasing.
I just bite my lip to stop the foolish smile threatening to take over my face and bring him closer to me, his head on my chest and our legs tangled. He threw his arm around me during his protests and we just laid there for a while longer. We stayed like that for a long enough time for him to doze off again. So I decided to stay like this until he rested enough since I know how hard it is for him to sleep peacefully.
I raise an eye brow and continue.
I stand there stock still before rushing out of there despite all the questions running through my mind. I ignore the hello's from students and go to the borders of the school and Apparate to the leaky cauldron. I blindly make my way to room 17 and I place a hand on the door. I don't even get to knock before the door opens and I'm being pulled into a hug.
"what's the plan?"
"Hey you left so quickly! Why-who is that?"
It was so soft and nothing more than an innocent brush of lips but it was everything I had hoped for and more. His lips soft and velvety made my mind fuzzy and blood rush from how amazing it was. When he pulled away slowly he looked up at me softly and I just brought him into my arms with a giant smile. I could hear that ever so soft tinkering bell in my mind letting me know he was giggling, as well as being able to feel the warm happiness and affection coming from him in my chest. I kissed the top of his head and he nuzzled into me even more at the action. I felt so deliriously happy at how this turned out and I knew he could feel it as well by how wide he was smiling.
Draco nods with a smaller smile and I can feel his nerves come back as he glances to Mione, Ron, and Neville. I could understand his nerves because the spell wasn't really something I was sure would be in the okay with families so light oriented.
I tense up because last time he didn't outright say anything, but was always subtly kind to me and helped me even if I tried pushing him away. I knew he might have suspected last time but I had mother then. I don't this time. Maybe I really can have a father who cares. I softly let go of him, "I had a suspicion that you might have known, I'm alright really. Just a few bruises is all."
And it all comes back in check. I immediately write back to Tom, telling him my findings and walking him through my check. He's as ecstatic
The next day I woke up feeling great.  I was incredibly warm and content at not having to wake up at the crack of dawn to cook food for people I hate. I pulled the nice source of warmth closer to me and sighed happily especially when the source of the warmth reminded me of Draco from the smell. It's then I blink open my eyes and realize why that bundle of warmth smelled of him,
I nod and chug down every single one.
He just gives me a teasing smile again,
I sigh while thinking of just how much stress is on Draco's shoulders now that he's back, going through all of this again. So I start heading to the kitchens to make the sadness in my chest leave and be replaced with the butterflies that always seem to appear when I'm with him.
I was so excited about this scene that I wrote it in one sitting. Please let me know how you feel about it!
“Thank you, Kreacher,” Granger accepted her cup, elbowing the older Weasley, and he muttered out his thanks to the house elf as well.
here? As if Draco couldn’t catch a break as it was, why did it have to be like this? Of the billions of people on the planet, why did it have to be the one that he spent so much effort avoiding, and praying to never see again?
“I’ll allow it for today, but only because it is our anniversary and because you just gave me two stunning orgasms,” Draco compromised. That made Harry smile harder, leaning over to kiss his husband.
“I guess so,” Draco trailed off, not knowing where she was going with this.
Potter nodded. Draco wondered what they had talked about. Maybe Shacklebolt had tried to persuade him to reconsider his agreement again, Draco hoped. Potter added nothing.
“We want to make it a special day to celebrate Harry, but also make it an event to see some of the people that we haven’t been able to catch up with for a few months,” Neville piped in, looking over at Draco a bit anxiously.
“You’re a free elf? And you’re choosing to serve Draco Malfoy?” Granger wasn’t convinced, but then she looked down at the clothing Fissy was wearing. Draco had insisted that she get rid of that horrendous smelling potato sack and put on actual clothing, though Potter had to help with that bit as nothing was her size and needed to be transfigured into smaller proportions. Granger was smart, Draco knew that. It wouldn’t take her long to figure out that if Fissy was wearing clothing, then she was indeed free to do as she pleases.
Draco thought. “She seems to be the only tangible connection you have to your life before- well, before you came here.”
Did I explain the bond well enough?
into the room, asking if he could get refreshments for the guest of Master Potter and Master Malfoy. Draco had caught Ginny Weasley and Granger giving Potter bewildered looks at the mention of ‘Master Malfoy’, but nobody commented further. Kreacher looked at everyone, getting ‘tea’ across the board of visitors and Potter, but a shake of the head ‘no’ from Draco.
Anywho.. please let me know what you think about this chapter, I changed my mind on things quite a few times and I'm hopeful that I chose the correct path for this fic.
Draco put his hands up in surrender, hoping to get the house elf to calm down, and possibly leave him alone. “Okay-Okay, it’s okay,” Draco rushed out, not wanting Potter to hear his house elf wailing in pain when they were together behind closed doors, doing god knows what to the elf, “he won’t punish you for anything, you know that,” Draco tried but that didn’t seem to get the elf to calm down at all, so he tried a different tactic. “He doesn’t have to know that you said that, I- I won’t tell him if you don’t,” Draco offered, and that made the house elf perk his ears a bit from their everlasting droop on the sides of his head.
"I think I answered that question already--"
"What are you doing here?" Harriet snapped before she could help herself, not intending her words to come out as rudely as they did.
Harriet scoffed at the idea even now and sipped idly from her glass. She'd tried therapy once before, well, a muggle therapist--but that had been different. She didn't need a mind-healer...maybe all she needed was a new mind. The thought caused her to snort mid-sip, gracefully choking and spluttering all over herself in the process which only made her laugh even harder. If only the Patil's could see her now.
Again, she was struck by the very words Malfoy had spoken to her in this very spot.
"Don't be. I was like that too, for a while."
"I don't really think I want to, Malfoy. As lovely as this evening has been--"
The rest of her thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. Stupidly, she tried to sit up again, only to feel gentle hands on her shoulders, holding her in place, “Idiot, don’t move—“ Malfoy hissed at her.
"Good thing you're hardly a lady, Scarhead."
Harry busied herself with straightening up around her flat (which took all of ten minutes as she always kept it clean). It was moments like this that she missed Grimmauld Place--there had always been something to be cleaned or fixed. Well, until there hadn't been anymore and Andromeda had encouraged her to sell the wretched home. Harriet had insisted against it, she didn't need the money and Kreacher would have been happy to look after it.
At last, her  eyes lingered on Draco, who looked like he was going to say something to her, but with prying eyes and attentive ears, he seemed to shrink away from the thought and merely nodded his head like his father.
Just when she was sure her knees were going to make sharp contact with the ground again, a pair of strong arms wrapped around her and kept her from falling. When she looked up to see who it was that she was looking at, Harriet nearly gasped.
First, she flicked her wand and tried to get her hair to fall in loose curls--but that made it look like she was trying too hard, and Merlin knew she wasn't going to try hard for a non-date with Draco Malfoy. She decided, long and straight was as good as anything. She compromised by putting in her contacts, instead of wearing her glasses, applying a little bit of mascara and some lip gloss.
"Stupid fucking Malfoy," she muttered under her breath and turned, trying not to tuck her tail between her legs as she went because if anything, one thing she had always held onto was her pride--and stubbornness. She clung to that pride even as she ran straight into someone and dropped to the sidewalk sharply.
Harry would’ve spoke again, only an aftershock rumbled through her and she ceased any and all attempts at telling Malfoy off.
All of this took at most 5 minutes--it was the outfit that was going to take longer. She didn't know what sort of place Malfoy was talking about, but he had said a pub, not a restaurant or anything too fancy. She settled on a pair of dark, skinny jeans, a pair of beige, knee high boots with a slight heel, and a white blouse. She put on a pair of pearl earrings, and didn't change the gold locket with a picture of her parents inside. Once she was satisfied, she grabbed her cloak and her pocket book, the one with the undetectable extension charm. Right before she decided to leave her flat, she pinched cheeks for color, pulled the cloak over herself and turned on her heel where she reappeared right in front of the pub and quickly made her way to the alley beside it to remove her cloak.
She was perfect for the job, after all, she'd been conditioned to be as such for the first 17 years of her life.
“No, just to fix you up after you’ve run amok,” Malfoy pointed out, leaving Harriet no other choice but to release his stupidly soft hand.
. A weak cry escaped her lips, alerting the whispering figure just out of sight.
Her stubbornness was only able to take her so far, however, as the pain caused her to cry out and close her eyes, surely in the brink of passing out, “You really can’t help being a fool, can you?” Malfoy hadn’t known when it had happened, only that he had taken one of her hands and was allowing her to squeeze it as tightly as she needed to try and distract her from the pain, “Surprised they haven’t done it sooner—the way you blindly threw yourself into those woods without waiting for your team to back you up—“
