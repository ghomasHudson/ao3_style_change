There was Narcissa Malfoy, sitting in a garden, looking young and cheerful, surrounded by daffodils. Next was a picture of Malfoy Manor in wintertime, a flurry of snow obscuring the shape of it. There were pictures of Draco at different ages; ten, riding a broom, thirteen, done up in party attire and looking unhappy, fifteen, one arm around Blaise Zabini, the other around the waist of a girl with dark hair and a shy blush high on her cheeks. There was a photo from a wedding, the same dark-haired girl smiling as Draco lifted a glass to her, white and silver swirling around them. The last picture was eerily familiar, Draco and the girl standing by a fountain, wrapped up in green scarves and heavy coats, laughing as the wind whipped around them.
“Salut mon coeur,” Malfoy murmured into the kiss, and Duchene hummed back at him. The display was disgustingly sweet- and not at all right for the middle of a grimy backwater pub, let alone a drug bust. Harry was going to have to obliviate himself as soon as possible. “J'ai un client, mon amour,” Malfoy continued, glancing back at Harry with unfamiliarity and a hint of coy playfulness. From this close, Harry noticed the subtle glamor. Malfoy’s eyes were blue, not grey, and his brows and lashes were dark, rather than the near-silver that they were in school. His nose was wrong too, though Harry couldn’t point out how. The tattoo on his arm was no dark mark, but instead a lovely bouquet of daffodils wrapped in dark ribbon.
“Right, then. I’ll see you soon Edward, Andromeda. Thank you, again.” He nodded, picked Teddy up and placed him on his feet, then rose to leave a kiss on Andy’s cheek. “Potter,” he said, and he walked out of the kitchen and into the sitting room. Teddy’s hair went a little grey.
“Is he blond too?” Harry asked after one such note was delivered, Andy’s barn owl nipping his fingers and cooing for treats.
“Blimey Harry, when did you get so dashing?” He flashed a brilliant smile at Harry and wagged his eyebrows.
“You’re so good, I’ve never seen anyone be so good,” Harry whispered, and he relished the shiver that coursed through Drake. Harry nodded and brought the paddle down hard on Drake’s lovely ass. Drake yelped and shuddered, but Harry’s hand smoothed itself over the red hot skin before long. He did it again, and again, until Drake wouldn’t stop shaking between the hits, and he began to babble.
“It does.” Harry rubbed his hands over his face, jostling his glasses. “He’s just… such a-”
“Water?” He asked, and Drake lazily pointed to a cooler in the corner. Harry chugged a glass himself and then got one for Drake, watching as a trickle of it ran down his chin. Harry licked the spill up, dangerously close to Drake’s mouth, and he was met with fire when he pulled away. Drake’s eyes were eerily familiar now, a deep grey that was quickly clearing from the fog of submission, and it sent chills over Harry’s body.
Harry couldn’t ease the tightness in his chest for hours after they had left.
“Sure, of course. And sending me into a pit of vipers without telling me who I’ll be working with is still, to this very moment, the most brilliant idea you lot have ever had.” Harry rolled his eyes and took in the disheveled appearance of their office as he closed the door behind him. It was still covered in the files from the last case they had, and they had barely gotten enough time to breathe before they were thrown into the thick of the illicit potions trade-- a case they had been slowly investigating for just over a year. Tonight, hopefully, would be the end to a wild goose chase, and the beginning of some well-deserved time off.
“Right.”
,” was the muttered response, and Harry squeezed as Drake keened. Harry adjusted the other boy until he was laying with his dick trapped between his body and the table, and he caressed the milky ass that was on display.
“Can I suck your cock?” He asked, and Harry shivered. He’d never heard anyone ask for that so directly, and it sent electricity zig-zagging through him. He nodded. “You have to say yes,” Drake said mildly.
Life happened only when he let his shoulders relax, when he wound down after work, when the light faded behind a veil of grey. It happened when he saw a stray dog, scared and shaking, on his walk to the market. It happened while he waited in a cue or when he played chess at the Burrow. It happened after funerals, after the crying and in between the chatter. It happened while he danced, while he dreamt, while he held his friends and sang quietly to himself. It happened when he waited for Teddy’s first birthday to roll back around, shuffling across the creaking floorboards of Grimmauld as it turned from a fortress into a home. Life crept up the walls like ivy. Life dripped through the ceiling during the thunderstorms of time. Life whispered on the breezes and rustled through the trees.
“Why?” Harry tried not to notice how Ron flinched.
Two wizards whispered in the dining hall of the Ministry.
!” Harry didn’t get to finish his sentence, because Malfoy’s--Draco’s-- lips were on his, and they were kissing, and his hands felt so familiar, so memorable on Harry’s face, and his hips and his back and his hair and…
It only took five minutes to find the files he needed to lock Jason
“Oh. I’ll think about it. Thanks Malfoy.” Harry dove back into his papers again, reciting the ingredients to pepper-up in his head and counting his teeth with his tongue to distract himself. He barely heard Ron over the racket in his brain, quietly asking,
“Mm.” Harry thought the night was full of specters and ghouls, faded memories and chances left untaken.
Beneath the headline was a small picture of Ron, Harry and Hermione, hugging after Harry and Ron completed their Auror training. Harry dropped his teacup.
It became a sort of game for Harry. The limits he could push Malfoy seemed endless, and he let loose a verbal torrent whenever the coast was clear enough. It was simultaneously frustrating and relaxing, getting to fume but wanting a reaction, needing anything other than the cool indifference Malfoy gave him.
“Okay, well. Thanks.” Harry pressed another kiss to Drake’s forehead and left the room as soon as he was sure he didn’t forget anything. He was all cut up inside.
Harry had rolled his eyes at her, saying
“Of course you have,” Draco rolled his eyes, and Harry felt his breath catch in his throat. Draco’s head was tilted slightly, his eyes bright and filled with the sunshine from outside. His hair caught a rainbow that had bounced off the decorative glass of the windows, washing him in color and softening his harsh angles, his high cheekbones, his sharp nose. He was wearing a light sweater, deep green and cashmere. Scorpius was cradled in his arms, small and precious, safe in his father’s embrace. Tiberius jumped out of Harry’s hold as he stared, mouth slightly agape and tears threatening him as they so often did these days.
“I won’t be fucking mad, Ron.”
Drake cancelled on him that weekend.
“Do you want me to tell you what I want,” the man said, and Harry felt his breath catch in his throat.
He couldn’t even try to piece together his feelings, raw and confusing as they were, so instead he sat in the dusty library of Grimmauld, toeing a dent in the old hardwood floor beneath him.
“I thought you’d gone,” Draco responded, his voice scratchy, side-stepping the question.
“Actually, mate, you literally made that exact rule. That was all you.”
And when Malfoy shoved him out of the way of a hex on a mission, and when he shouted Harry’s name with the exact same intonation, Harry could barely do anything but gawk. Somehow Malfoy knew, and he knew how to hit Harry exactly where it hurt. Somehow Malfoy knew Harry was madly in love with a man he was paying to love him back, and he was rubbing it in Harry’s face. Clearly. Harry ‘spilled’ boilwart into Malfoy’s tea later that evening, and he snickered as the man broke out in hives and would leave him itchy the next few days.
“Okay,” Harry breathed, letting Drake draw soothing circles on his hand. “Can you kiss my neck?” In an instant the blond was in his lap, licking a stripe from his collarbone to the sensitive spot behind his ear, and Harry felt arousal curl in his gut. He ran his hands over the long legs that were wrapped around him, and the man purred in his ears, which went straight to Harry’s cock. Harry experimentally flicked his own tongue against Drake’s neck, and his breath hitched excitingly, spurring Harry on. Harry pressed his lips along the slightly stubbly jaw, licked into salty collar bones and nipped at Drake’s soft earlobe. They lapped at each other for what felt like ages. When they were both breathing heavy, Harry ran his hand underneath the gauzy shirt Drake was wearing, eliciting a whine that made him tingle deliciously.
“Gave him a bit of a scare, I think,” Ron whispered, just loud enough for Harry to overhear.
“What are you on about,” he groused, and Ron glanced warily at him.
“What do you mean, Malfoy’s going to be there.” Harry was sitting in his office at Grimmauld, his auror robes half undone, and Ron was glancing queasily between Harry and the floo, his mouth in a tight frown.
Ron’s voice echoed through his mind, and Harry let his hand fall from where his wand was. He had promised. Christ.
, Malfoy. For all of it. For school. For the… you know.
“So what does he have to do then? Save the world for you, repay his life debt?” There was color high on Ron’s cheeks, and that annoyed Harry even more. His best friend cared more about a Hogwarts bully coming to Christmas than he did Harry’s feelings. Figures.
“Was it a rough breakup, Potter?” Malfoy said, pointing at the firewhiskey that was open on the counter. Harry wanted to smash his face in.
“Jus’ not hungry,” he responded, and it didn’t take a genius to figure out where he had adopted his imperious attitude from. Silence reigned for a few long seconds, with Harry carefully watching where Malfoy’s hand rested on Teddy’s back, strong and sturdy and pale. Malfoy cleared his throat.
is the definition of bliss.”
before the gust of magic whipped through the three of them, tearing them off their feet and slamming them into the wall of the stairwell.
“Yes, well,” Harry sniggered, “we wanted a good send-off for Auror Malfoy here, seeing as he’ll be leaving us for a stint, and, well… It was Ron’s idea, really.” Harry brushed his hand through his hair and knocked his hip into Draco, making him stumble into Ron. “Are we in trouble?”
“You don’t feel the same way.” Harry whispered, and Drake nodded solemnly. “Is it… someone else?” He asked, against his better judgement. There were pretty crystalline tears trapped in Drake’s eyelashes, and Harry hated himself. Drake nodded again. “Is it Harry?” Harry asked, and Drake's gasp stabbed him harshly in the chest. He stepped back from the door, and his own tears rolled down his face. Drake looked broken in front of him, and Harry sat on the bed, wiping his tears away with the back of his hand. “Okay. I’m okay, you should go. Goodbye Drake,” he stuttered, and Drake slipped out the door and out of his life.
And so Drake came over, and he came over and over and over. On Harry’s bed, on his kitchen table, on the floor, on the desk. And he kept coming over, at least once a week, for a month. And Harry could not fall in love with a muggle. He wouldn’t allow himself, not now and not ever. He wouldn’t fall for him, even when Drake showered in his shower, even when he ate crackers from the box in Harry’s kitchen, even when he kissed Harry’s jaw and whispered about all the things he would do to him. Harry wasn’t falling in love with a muggle, not even a little bit.
“Sorry, I have a lot of clients. Sometimes I forget.” Drake excused, and Harry bristled.
“But nothing, Harry,” Ron threw back, and Harry gulped. “He’s coming to Christmas because he’s my friend, and he asked me for a favor. You know as well as I do that he’s got nobody here to spend it with, his wife is still in France. He’s coming, and you’re coming, and you’re going to be civil- for me.”
When Malfoy would prance into the office after a bust, Ron hot on his heels and grinning like a mischievous pixie, Harry would have to take a few deep breaths and remind himself that punching his coworkers would probably not go down well, regardless of his legacy. When Malfoy trudged past him, covered in dirt and potions and sweat, Harry would have to hold his tongue against the cutting remarks that threatened to burst from him, vicious and cruel.
“Me? Why?” Harry looked up at Draco, and he saw familiar fiery grey eyes, and life stilled to a grinding halt.
“A bientôt mon fils! Ne t'inquiète pas pour Scorpius,” Andromeda called as the floo roared.
“Malfoy.”
“I was in love with my coworker,” Draco replied, and he sighed when Harry slumped. “I had been pretending, pretending that you were really you, because I thought it would help get you out of my system. And it didn’t.”
Ron remarked, tapping his finger against a floating candle, smiling.
, Draco purred in his head,
He managed to do this every year, to lock himself away and hide from the truth of it, the bitter taste of loneliness. He’d send a bottle of sherry to Petunia, his only acknowledgement of the family they had shared and lost. Otherwise he would sit at home and stew. For a few years he would let Hermione drag him out somewhere; to Bath, to downtown, to the park, to her home where she would dress up in a witch costume and charm paper stars to float in the air. But it turned sad, after a while, as he would sit and watch his friends laugh together. It was not that they were unfamiliar with loss, or pain, but it was different to grow up out of place, to never have a home he was safe in.
He was lucky, and he knew it. He was blessed to see the world change, to be able to blink, to breathe, to cry. He was lucky to feel the dull thud of longing in his heart, the pain of loss and the joy of kissing on park benches in June. He remembered the days he spent in bed, too lost to cry, his heart so broken that it felt as though it froze over. He was lucky that he knew Time would sooth him. That it would pull him out of the dark and into the sharp pain of hunger, exhaustion, fear. That one day he would wake up and he would be able to taste again, if he held Hope and Love close enough.
“Malfoy, leave me alone,” Harry blubbed, drowning in his own sorrow.
“Can I kiss you?” Harry asked quietly.
“I knew it. I know he is.” Teddy smiled and nodded to himself.
“Sorry,” Harry replied, his eyes zeroing in on Draco. “Just wanted to shake things up a bit.”
Harry thought.
Harry hoped he was right.
“If you want to, sure.” Drake picked a spot on the floor and Harry went over to where toys were splayed out on a table that smelled strongly of disinfectant. He grabbed the rope, and then on second thought he also nabbed a bottle of lubricant and a soft paddle. Then, he walked back to Drake and began unbuttoning his flouncy shirt. He grabbed his arms and tucked them behind him, loosely wrapping the rope around Drake’s wrists and slipping his finger between the knots to make sure there was still enough space for him to move around, just in case. He was briefly distracted by the thought of Drake wrapped tightly in the back rope, contrasting with his pale skin and pulling his limbs taut. The man was really too pretty to be real, and Harry caved, nuzzling into the blond’s neck. He smelled like jasmine and apple, crisp and clean.
“Lovely shrinking potion you have there,” Harry would remark over his burnt coffee, barely looking up.
“Are you coming out to count down with us?” She asked, a smile on her lips, as though she’d just walked in on them discussing politics and not necking in the dark like school children. Harry heard Scorpius shriek with laughter from the other room.
“My name is Drake, and I’ll be taking care of you tonight. Have a seat.” A gorgeous, tall, sandy-blond boy was sitting on the table in the middle of the room. He had on a loose white button down, and light slacks, and he looked like a goddamn angel. His ankles were crossed and he sat with poise, like he was a prince, like… Harry shook his head. This man looked nothing at all like Malfoy, it was just the way he was sitting and glaring like he owned the place, which, admittedly, could be possible. And Harry did
Malfoy simply nodded once, twisted out of Harry’s grip and was out the door in the span of a blink. Harry barely heard Malfoy mutter from down the hall, his shoes squeaking on the polished tiles,
, he was able to drag his hand through her hair and whisper back,
A last hurrah, they had called it. Harry had gotten a stitch in his side from laughing when Ron told him the plan, tipsy and tired. Draco had just shook his head, telling them it was a terrible idea and smiling like a contented cat. It
After the second time, Drake watched him curiously as they dressed.
Harry took a deep breath in. For now, they were his. For now, he held them tighter.
“Promise me you won’t get angry and blow the whole case.”
The rooms were a blur as Teddy paraded them around, telling everyone that they should,
“I suppose. I don’t, he hasn’t… We don’t talk about it.”
“Sac-re-bloo,” Harry mimicked and Andromeda glared at him. “What?”
He was lucky enough to meet life halfway, on most days. When Ginny left him, crying into his shoulder and telling him that
And Life continued, hidden behind the days on the calendar. Sneaking into the spaces between words. Grasping at him in the midst of every passing face, sliding underneath the wheels of every car, hovering over the passing clouds.
, oh-” And then they were kissing again, and Draco wasn’t leaving.
It wouldn’t have been that bad, but the man was impossible to pin down. At times he knew things nobody else knew, like where to hit wards cast by dark wizards so that they came down in only three hits, or how to get past mind-numbing fog bombs without losing track of time. Other times he was so calculating and cold that it felt like he was less a person and more a finely turned weapon, which was unsettling and left Harry with the taste of copper in his mouth. But then Malfoy would smile, or make a joke, and christ- the man could be painfully funny- and Harry would bite his lips and remind himself over and over that Malfoy was a Bad Person and Couldn’t Be Trusted. It was desperate work.
Harry was stunned, not only by the full rundown of plans that had flooded his senses, but also by Malfoy’s shamelessly flawless plan. It must have taken months to track everything out the way he had. Months of research and trickery for him to know the setup so well. Months where he was “dating” Jason Duchene, and Harry didn’t even
“Harry,” he called, smiling, framed by the doorway. “Ronald.”
They laughed together, leaving the pub early in the night, Draco claiming that he was a horrid father, Harry shoving him, denying it and smiling. Draco went home to his family. Harry went home to his empty rooms, his creaky floorboards.
Harry shed his own shirt and kneeled on the ground next to Drake, dragging his fingertips over the mountains and valleys of his body, feeling out the hard planes of muscle. When Harry looked up again, Drake’s eyes were hooded and his mouth hung open slightly, taking in short frantic breaths.
Drake looked as though he had swallowed a blast-ended skrewt. “I- I’m sorry Harry.”
When he woke up, his arms were empty, and he knew what he needed to do.
The Love was staring at him in the mirror every single day. He needed to look a little harder to see it on some days, on the days where his eyes were wet and lonely and scarred.
Draco Malfoy was an undercover agent for the French Aurors. Draco Malfoy had been tracking Jason Duchene for three months before Harry got on the case. Draco Malfoy was damn good at his job. Draco Malfoy was friends with Ron--Harry's Ron, and they were laughing together like old mates. Draco Malfoy had helped him catch Jason Duchene. Bloody hell.
“Go get’em Harry,” Ron encouraged, and Harry nodded. “We’ve got four officers waiting for your cue inside, and two waiting out here with me.” Ron cast a light mind link and tested it before Harry turned and walked towards the door. As he pushed on the solid wood, he faintly heard Ron’s voice echo in his head-
“Right. What gives?” Harry asked, and Hermione’s eyes were glittering. She only shrugged. Harry struggled for two seconds more before he saw it. A piece of paper was tacked onto the bottom of the second page, camouflaged into the curling scripts and photos.
“Your mother-” Harry began, and realization fell on him like a bucket of ice water. “Oh Draco,
“Is this some sort of sick,” Malfoy coughed hard, “some sick joke Potter?”
Harry tensed.
, it read,
“Mhm,” Harry replied thoughtlessly, finger dragging along the spines of the books, “Asteroid, Astro, Astro, Astrology, Astrology, Astrology, ha! Astronomy.” He pulled out the text and handed it to Hermione, oblivious to her calculating gaze.
“Do you want to know?” Hermione was a mad genius, but she was a shoddy actress. She sounded much too disinterested to be genuine.
Robard’s stern disposition melted. “No, no indeed. Though, couldn’t you have just thrown a goodbye party like a normal person?”
Harry hovered in the doorway as Draco cooed over Rose, as Hermione asked how it was that her heart had never loved so fully before.
“Of course he is Ted. He’s a good guy.” Harry brushed his hand through Teddy’s blond hair, and he tried not to wonder if Malfoy’s hair felt like this. Soft and thick.
“Ta,” Harry had whispered, one hand full of dust, the other on Draco’s elbow. Draco glanced back towards the hall, anticipating his son’s uncanny ability to wake just when his father needed rest most. Harry leaned in to kiss Draco’s cheek, but he was met with lips, Draco’s reply captured between them. And then they were kissing, and Harry could barely fathom the relief of it. The tension in his shoulders released, tension he hadn’t known he held. His floo powder was forgotten, dusting the floor and staining Draco’s robes. It couldn’t have lasted more than ten seconds, but when Draco pushed him away it felt as though decades had passed, as though their entire lives had disappeared and been rewritten in the span of a heartbeat.
“Sorry,” he rasped.
“If you- If I can- If you need, I can, um-” Harry stumbled over his own tongue, and suddenly Draco felt too close, too loud, too alive beneath Harry’s hand on his arm.
“The Rosier family is from France, as are the Malfoys, Harry. The Black Family Tapestry still hangs in your home, does it not?” Andy raised her eyebrows, and it was hard not to see the resemblance between her and her nephew.
“Oh, just lovely, thanks,” he responded sarcastically, but she didn’t flinch. They were seated at the kitchen table in the Granger-Weasley home in Sedgefield, a sweet muggle town in northern England. Ron and Draco were standing in the foyer, drinking fancy cocktails and sharing tales of their penpal-ship from the last four months. Four months where Ron was writing bloody love letters to Malfoy while Harry investigated a man they had practically already captured. The world was a cruel place.
“Anything we can do?” Malfoy asked, and Hermione laughed. “What? Three Aurors against one sexist politician? We can’t lose.” Hermione giggled again, but she shook her head. Harry bristled.
The man was brilliant. Still an arse, but brilliant. And now he was asking Harry to flirt with him.
“-have nowhere to escape to without you here. Besides, I won’t miss Scorp’s first birthday. I don’t think he’d ever forgive me.” Harry tried not to grovel, but the desperation crept in anyways. Harry had pulled Draco into the coat closet at the burrow, trying to avoid a confrontation in front of their family.
It was bright, and there was laughter and fairy lights lining the windows. The garden was especially brilliant, filled with pumpkins of different sizes and candles floating in the cool autumnal air. It smelled like spice cake and turkey, hinting at the holidays, reminding him of feasts at Hogwarts, cinnamon and apples and sawdust. At some point he had been wrapped up in conversation, drawn inside by the laughter, engaged in a lighthearted argument over quidditch teams and colors. He’d held Scorpius, then Rose, then mistaken one for the other, and then they were whisked away and drinks were pushed into his hands, fizzy and sweet. He’d chatted until people started to leave, and then he had found his way back to the garden, back to the cool rustle of leaves and the cloudless night.
“When?” He said, and he was up and hugging his friends before the reply came.
He didn’t like it. “Draco, you can eat my biscuit.” Teddy placed the biscuit in Malfoy’s hand, and Malfoy laughed, all white teeth and un-Malfoy-ish smile lines.
“I do
“Uncle Ree! Uncle Ree, look, Draco isa pirate!” The seven year old beamed, his hair a stark white replica of Malfoy’s blond head.
, the embrace said.
“Thank you, Auror Potter,” Malfoy would respond, all graciousness and unfaltering modesty.
“Those scorch marks really bring out how thin you are, Malfoy,” Harry would sneer as he strode past.
“Sure do, love. My next import is coming in tonight, if you want to come back and take a look.” The man pushed his galleons across the counter, his hand hovering. “I’ve half a mind to think you’re part siren yourself, with that smile of yours.”
“He’s all right. He’s with Andromeda.” Draco looked confused. Scared. Their voices were quiet in the darkness, whispered like the wind through the trees, as if they were trying to leave the air untouched by the sound of them.
Tiberius meowed again, and Harry looked down to find the cat rubbing against his leg, silvery-white and long. He knelt down and rubbed the cat behind its ears, cheered by its soft purring. After a while the cat jumped up into his lap, and Harry laughed.
“I’m a wizard,” he blurted, squeezing his eyes shut against the incredulous questions he knew would be coming. When he opened his eyes, Drake looked faint.
Draco focused his gaze on Harry as he placed the martini down.
“Slim to none,” Draco countered, but his mouth twitched with the effort to keep his smile in check.
he said that I should sit down, because being ‘too active’ isn’t good for the baby! The
“Okay, fine! You were right, I was wrong. Go ahead, say it, say that you told me so.”
, he could take her hand and apparate away, saying,
“Draco,” Harry hissed before the man could leave.
“Please do,” Drake arched his back, and Harry stripped himself of his jeans. His head was a rush of adrenaline and arousal.
.” Harry was trying to be calm, he was, but…
“Yes.” Harry responded, and he stood up as soon as Drake was off him. “Can I tie you up?” Harry asked, and the blond shrugged.
“We need to talk,” Harry stood and closed the half-open door, trapping Drake in his arms.
not falling in love, though. Harry still woke up at five on the weekdays, his body aching. He still showered and prepped and drank his morning tea black. He still rolled his eyes at Malfoy when he walked into the Auror office late. He still struggled to ignore the blond git’s commentary on his bad taste and his disastrous hair. He still ground his teeth when he was forced to run jobs with the arsehole. He still had to control his breathing whenever Malfoy got too close, he still groaned when Malfoy did something annoyingly smart. And when he licked his lips and glared at Harry with fiery grey eyes, Harry ignored it. And when he brought him afternoon tea with a splash of milk and two sugars, well, that was just coincidence, wasn’t it? And when he laughed--actually laughed-- at Harry’s jabs, and Harry’s heart tugged in a completely unwarranted way, well, maybe they were just getting used to each other. Of course. That was it. Harry wasn’t pent up anymore, and now he could occasionally get along with his git of a partner. All was well.
“Shame, that. Well. Vodka Martini, shaken, not stirred,” Harry could barely help the wonder he felt at his own words. So much had changed since he last said them.
- Harry began, and all of his instincts spurred into overdrive.
“You’re gorgeous, you’re like a painting, or a marble statue. Especially like this. So pretty.” Harry continued, and Drake panted hard, his cheeks coloring so attractively that Harry thought he could sit and watch it forever. Harry palmed himself through his jeans, and he was painfully hard. He unzipped his trousers and tugged his cock free, fisting it a couple of times before he got up to stand in front of Drake. “Suck,” he said, and Drake’s mouth was on him in an instant. It felt electric, and fiery, as though the hot mouth had its own brand of magic and it was casting wicked things with each slick tug. The mouth travelled lower, sucking on Harry’s heavy balls, and Harry nearly fainted with the pleasure of it, his toes curling conspiratorially. Drake moaned around his cock, and Harry had to pull away fiercely, his orgasm threatening him.
Harry tried his best to avoid Malfoy on every mission. He would tell Robards to send him in alone if they were ever partnered, he would make excuses not to join in on stakeouts, he would even claim that he needed the time to fill out paperwork, which made Robards roll his eyes and Ron puff a laugh of disbelief.
Life snuck silently across the floor while Harry slept, pulling the hems of his clothing and scuffing his shoes. It danced around with Time while he showered, using up all the sugar in the pantry and spoiling the milk. Life pulled the skeletons out of the closets, and Time laughed in the face of Death, unafraid. Time seduced the world into its never ending spiral, and Life marched onward, opening doors and sparking fires in the hearts of lovers, only for Time to put them out within the next month.
Harry took a deep breath, looked into Drake’s eyes, and let it go. “I don’t want to pay for this anymore,” he said.
“S’pose I should, considering the time. If that’s alright.” Harry downed the rest of his butterbeer, and Hermione’s eyebrows drew together.
“Perfect.”
“Of course, sir, you see…” Ron could barely stand from the laughter that shook his chest. “Sorry,
“Draco’s home is lovely, isn’t it?” She had said, her face buried in the stacks.
It was Harry’s turn to find Draco, the next time. He was sitting in the kitchen, changed into his house robes, palms pressed to his eyes, plates and food covering the island and the countertops. His chest shuddered with deep, uneven breaths, and Harry was all-too familiar with the pose.
Maybe George was right, maybe this was exactly what he had needed. He needed to feel someone arch and whine under his touch, needed the rush of power and the heady sense of anonymity. He craved the idea that this man was attracted to him and liked what he was doing, even if it was a lie. It felt good.
They talked about being queer, vaguely. Harry mentioned Ginny with all the grace he could, and Draco talked about Astoria as if she were an angel, his best friend and his closest confidant. They talked about work, about how Draco had found something in himself that could see a problem and find a solution.Draco told him that his wand holster had become a second skin, and he showed the inscription on the inside,
“Thank you.” Ron smiled so sweetly at him that Harry thought he might retch.
“Oh, of course. I’ll see you Monday. Thank you for the tea.” Draco smiled again, warmer than sunshine, and Harry felt his face flush. Before he could think twice about it, Harry stepped around the corner of the counter and bent to kiss the soft downy hair on Scorpius’ head. When he came up, Draco’s eyes were only inches away, his breath ghosting over Harry’s face. Harry blinked, glanced down at Draco’s parted lips, wet from the tea and rosy with the summer heat. He stepped away carefully, and mumbled a quick,
“Oh, trust Merlin, you will,” Ron laughed, then quieted as Harry glared. “Just say the code to the bartender, then you two will pounce when the time is right.”
An elderly man had lamented after Malfoy and Harry took his eye-witness account of a robbery.
Though it was slow, he still made progress. He bought Malfoy a drink in the pub after work, and they bickered over the superiority of dark versus light spirits.
In all, the day had made him feel even more lonely than he had been the month before. He still felt the achiness in his chest when he saw his family happy and together, their wounds from the war healing with each passing year. But now it would focus itself and become a burn that rested behind his heart every time he saw them make connections beyond him. He knew it was selfish, and horrible of him, and cruel, but he couldn’t help it.
“Come in,” a voice rang from the other side of the door, and Harry was nervous. Extremely, nervous. So nervous that he wanted to crawl out of his skin. But somehow the door was opened, and he was walking through it, and then he was in, and it had started. His palms were sweating.
“No, don’t play dumb.” Harry seethed. “I love you, I think. And I know this is stupid, and you don’t really know me, but I can’t pay you for this anymore.”
“No- well, yes he is. But-”
“Yes, yes! He just won the Navy and saved the, um, the Princess! See that?” Teddy pointed to a pot of jam and a pepper shaker. Malfoy remained impassive as always, his eyes never leaving a spot on the table. Harry nodded, his eyebrows drawn together as if contemplating a serious naval battle. “Can I have a sweet?” Teddy eyed the plate in front of them.
Harry swallowed. “I’m not really sure. I’d rather be doing it, but I don’t have much practice, I don’t want to hurt you.” He wished he’d taken the shot of firewhiskey George had offered him outside. Drake hopped off the table. Harry had used polyjuice for this occasion, but the bag of hair George had offered him came from a man who looked a surprising amount like him, with dark curly hair and a similar stature, so Harry knew that even when he was normal this man would stand an inch or so above him. Drake was lithe though, with thin wrists and delicate features that were strikingly beautiful.
He added, for good measure. He felt every step of Duchene’s poncy boots as they clicked towards him. He could see it all now- Duchene’s wand raised on his back, the green light, the pain and the nothingness.
I will snap every quill you own in two.” Ron stood to match him, and he leered over Harry.
“Who’s that?” Harry whispered.
Hermione smiled at him. “Really, it just helps that you listen. I work all day with people who talk. I just need someone to listen.” Hermione sighed again, and Ron brushed a hair behind her ear.
“I do house calls, if you ever want me to come by. It’s the same rate, and sometimes it’s more comfortable. And you’re a respectable client.” Drake was looking at him with those fiery eyes, the ones he always had when they were finishing up their evening.
“You, Harry Potter, are a fucking idiot,” Malfoy breathed.
“Draco,” Draco growled, and Harry shivered.
“You’re Drac-
Draco Malfoy was holding a gorgeous bottle of liquor, a full peach on display at the bottom of the bottle. He smiled brightly at the older wizard he was helping, and Harry seethed. Malfoy looked entirely too perfect in this setting. His hair was hanging just past his chin now, still silver blond and pompous as always. Half of it was dragged back, tied with a thin leather band, and pieces were hanging into his face, effortlessly framing his features and narrowly walking the line between messy and mouthwatering. He wore a white shirt underneath a steely grey waistcoat, and his sleeves were rolled up to his elbow, leaving the evil blotch of ink there on display. He looked devilish as he poured the drink into a crystal sherry glass. And then he looked up at Harry, and his easy smile flickered.
“Are you all right?” Harry asked, pulling up a stool and wrapping his fingers around Draco’s wrist. Draco let his hands fall, and his eyes were wet.
Draco Malfoy wasn’t going back to France in January. Harry had worried over it, had begged for him to stay, telling him that he’d-
“You could
It was on one of those nights where Harry was struggling to leave Draco’s home. They were up late, back from the pub and chatting up a storm in the kitchen. They had talked about loss, and how it felt to be without the people who raised them. They had talked about Astoria and Narcissa, they talked about Sirius and Remus, they talked about heartbreak, about the hopelessness of it. Draco had said the old records were muggle hits from the thirties and forties, that Narcissa had hidden them from Voldemort, that she and Draco used to dance to them when his father wasn’t around, swinging around each other in ballrooms filled with morning light. Harry had said that Grimmauld held echoes of everyone who had lived there, that it scared him when it was dark and quiet, that it reminded him of a cupboard underneath the stairs.
“Right. Vodka Martini, shaken, not stirred,” Harry dropped his silencing charm, reciting easily, and Malfoy smiled.
“Don’t bother.” Malfoy was tense. “I know it.”
“Is this a trap?” Harry laughed, but the sound of it fell flat on his ears. Hermione looked at him then, her eyes sharp and prying.
“Please do,” Draco responded, and Harry brushed his lips ever so softly over Draco’s, testing the waters that had previously gone uncharted. Draco leaned into the touch, pulling Harry to him, and the kiss went from chaste to brutal and violent, teeth clashing. They stumbled into the bedroom, lips locked and hands groping. Harry snapped and their clothes were gone, his hands free to roam all the skin he knew so well and simultaneously not at all. He groaned as Draco’s slim hand grasped at his cock, and he arched when Draco bit down on the spot of Harry’s collar that practically belonged to him. This was exactly where Harry belonged.
Harry wandlessly cast a silencing charm over himself, and watched as Malfoy sneered at the display. It only took a few moments for him to come and stand in front of Harry’s stool, but the seconds dragged in Harry’s mind. There was no way he would-
“That’s fine. I’ll give you my work number.”
“No, no that’s fine,” Mafloy cocked his head to look Harry in the eye. He was insufferably guarded now, when only a moment ago he had been smiling and drinking as if he belonged with them. Harry was pleased that Malfoy had been shaken from that delusion. “We’ll just have to think of something else.”
“Mmm,” he hummed and shrugged, as if it were a perfectly good answer. Ron didn’t look convinced. “I just don’t think he deserves it.”
“I know, I know,” Draco had said, his long finger held in Rose’s perfect hand. “Believe me, I’ll never forget it.”
“Harry Potter. Tell me my full name right this instant or I’ll hex your bollocks off.”
They should have been dead. They would have been, if Draco hadn’t been so quick, if he hadn’t shielded them when he did, seconds before it was too late. His lightning-fast reflexes had left Harry and Ron with little more than a few broken bones, well enough to pull Draco from the rubble, well enough to yell his name, well enough to apparate him directly to St. Mungo’s.
“Draco!” Ron stood, and Draco put a hand up to stop him.
?” Harry stood up, and a book flew off the shelf behind his desk. “Circe Ron, he could be up to-”
“Don’t be mad.”
“Auror Potter! You’re still here, wonderful. I was looking into the list of potions ingredients that were found at Vimbards last week, and it seems as though siren hair was one of the boxes that had gone missing in the attack on Cherry street, you know, the one with the fox animagus as the witness, yes? Anyways, I think I found another link between the two incidents and I would be interested to see what you have to add, you see because-” Malfoy had moved into the office now, his eyes glinting in the dim light. Harry suppressed a shiver.
“I’ve been worse. He’s seen me worse,” Draco whispered back, and Harry felt his eyes prickle again, uncomfortable and hot.
“Tch, va te faire enculer,” Duchene said towards Harry, though his incredulous stare didn’t last long, as Malfoy pulled him into another snog, slow and sweet and passionate. Harry thought he might puke.
Christ, I’m so sorry,
“Oh, kind of you to notice - my new diet is strictly made up of evil planning and flobberworms,” Malfoy would quip, barely a beat later.
“And I hear the weather has been good for siren hunting. Do their scales really sell for twice the amount in early spring? Fascinating,” Draco finished, twisting an orange peel over the drink and dropping it in. The perp beamed.
He fought with Malfoy that week, exchanging a stinging hex and words that cut brutally into his psyche. He was so harsh that he almost regretted it when Malfoy’s eyes went wide and he worried his bottom lip between his teeth, just like…
When he called Draco’s that night, there was no reply.
A witch laughed with her friends over lunch, two tables away from Harry.
“Drake-” Harry breathed, and the mouth was on his neck now.
Life echoed between his heartbeats while he sat across the table from steely eyes. Life tripped him and he fell into strong arms, over and over again. Life dragged confessions to his lips while he kissed. Life poured down his face when he felt the crash of emotion in his chest, love and fear and relief. Life tossed him into hell, then convinced him that it was worth more than all the stars in the night sky.
Drake’s eyes went wide, and he nodded. “Okay.”
Harry nodded and slid out of his chair as quietly as possible, tiptoeing into the hallway. Blue eyes peered at him from around the corner, and he followed them down the hall, sparing a moment every few steps to look at the photos that hung on the walls.
Harry shared that he felt lost when he didn’t have a cause, when he didn’t feel like he was doing enough to deserve the things he got. They never spoke about the war.
“He’s
Ron! Did you forget what he did to you? To
“Hah, ‘Mione, it's
“Then talk.”
Once he was fully prepared, Harry rolled a condom on, slicked up his cock and straddled the man on the table. He pressed in slowly, listening to the man under him breathe in shattered gasps of air. And then he was in, and it was tight and hot and Harry had forgotten how fucking good it was to feel this. Drake was babbling again, “Please fuck me, please please please, let me come please, I’m dying,” he rambled, and Harry pressed his hands into Drake’s back. The angle was too awkward for anything more than shameless rutting, so Harry thought he would push Drake as far as he could, until he broke. Harry pressed down in circles on Drake’s back, massaging with the cooling charm and rocking the tip of his cock into Drake’s soft heat. The man was gasping and shaking again, his arms straining against the ropes. “I’m, I’m gonna come, I’m so close, oh, Hal-” Harry pulled off and stepped away from the table as fast as he could, and Drake cried out into the table, humping on instinct and whining deliciously. “No, no, no, no,” he muttered, and Harry licked the shell of his ear.
“I don’t know a thing about you…” He echoed, and he pointed his wand directly at Harry’s chest. “When’s the last time you took Polyjuice, Potter? Was it two weeks ago? When you told
“Oh Senior Auror Robards,” Draco said, pulling himself together enough to talk and wipe at imaginary tears, “when in the world has Harry Potter ever acted like a normal person.”
“What’s all this?” Drake had said, and he had smiled brilliantly.
“Harry,” he responded, level as ever, though his cheeks were still flushed and his clothes had just been messily dragged on.
Life happens in the spaces between breaths.
Two weeks later, Harry and Malfoy were scheduled for a stakeout together. When Harry handed Malfoy the folded card with his flat address on it, Malfoy choked.
“Antione!” He barked, and Malfoy flinched. “Come here, pet.” Malfoy nodded and was by his side in an instant. “À qui appartiens-tu?” Duchene murmured into Malfoy’s neck, and Harry shivered.
“Right then, Mr. McDougall, you’re under arrest for smuggling magical creatures whilst on court-ordered probation. Auror Potter, feel free,” Draco said, and he waved his hand with vague nonchalance, still pouring Harry’s drink. Four Aurors were already apprehending the smuggler, stunning spells on the tips of their wands.
“You don’t know anything about me Malfoy,” Harry barked. “And it wasn’t a breakup, it was the end of a contract. Suck my dick, arsehole.” But Malfoy was smiling--no--laughing.
They passed the rest of their time on the job in deafening silence, both of them watching down the street for any sign of a scuffle. At twelve, their backup came, and they were off the clock again, but the quiet still reigned.
“Draco’s transferring… here. For a year. Robards requested it because of our teamwork on the Duchene case.” Ron rubbed the back of his neck and shot Harry a careful smile. Malfoy’s gaze was burning and unwavering. The lights in the small kitchen flickered gently as Harry felt angry magic lick up his body. “Brilliant? No?” Ron’s voice sounded small.
“Ainsi soit-il,” Duchene waved his hand with an air of nonchalance. Malfoy smiled and tugged Duchene’s lapel softly, as though they had shared some private victory. It was a horrifying performance.
He sidled up to the bar, right next to a burly figure who looked like he chewed on doxy bones in his spare time. Draco was talking to the man, his blond hair in a severe braid, his countenance leering and strong. As Draco spoke he threw a small bottle, caught it, then shook it thrice over the finger of alcohol and the sphere of ice in the cup. His smile was scathing. Harry wanted to devour it.
The club seemed almost like a hotel, with its eerily empty front room and too-quiet hallways. Harry read the number on his key. 432. He walked the halls until he found the matching number, and he knocked.
He heard in Diagon after the Prophet released a Malfoy exposé.
“Aw, you got a crush on me Malfoy? I’m flattered.” Harry deadpanned, and Malfoy choked on his tea.
It was hidden in the way his hand was held as Hermione walked down the aisle, Ron sobbing beside him. It was the magic that came in things that had nothing at all to do with wands or spells, but instead was how Molly hugged him, the smell of his pillow, the sound of birds after a sleepless night. Love was flickering in the pictures that covered his dresser and hung on his walls, a million moments captured and faded. It was the familiar song that floated through the hallway, played on ancient piano keys that were choked with dust. It was the taste of treacle when he needed something to lean on, the light brush of fingers underneath his shirt, the stubble on his chin.
“I was perfectly civil!” Harry argued, and Andromeda just shrugged. “What’s with you knowing french?” He countered, feigning disinterest despite his burning curiosity.
“You’re Hal, right?” Drake said, looking to a paper that rested beside him. “You noted that you’re into bondage, breathplay, impact play and denial, but you didn’t write if you’re a Dom or Sub. I can do either, what would you prefer?”
“I’m quitting the Aurors, Harry.” Draco shrugged, and his hands found Harry’s sweater, tugged the hem of it.
Before Harry could even blink, Malfoy was relaying information to Ron through the link, and describing in great detail how they would all get out of the bar alive, and hopefully successful.
Life was like that, luring you into feeling. It rolled him around, flinging him from one day to the next, and rubbing away the sharp edges war had left in him. Life was the scar tissue on his body fading while he laughed with his friends, while he worked, while he quit, while he dreamed and played and fell and fell and fell. Life was the balm on his shattered love, the tonic and the poison all at once.
Harry woke up angry and starved. The smell of bacon floated down the hallway to him, and he allowed it to rouse him from his morning grogginess. The sounds of Hermione laughing and Ron singing dragged him further down the hallway, and he was monumentally pleased to not find a blond slytherin sitting in his chair, as he had been last night.
“Ah, ‘twas on sale,” Malfoy would jest back, ignoring Harry’s poisonous tone.
“People are leaving,” Draco said, backlit by the orange glow of the party. He was wearing shiny silver chainmail, a sword on his hip. His hair was slicked back and tied at the nape of his neck, and he looked all at once exactly like his father and yet entirely different. The charms on Harry’s own hair had faded, leaving it more black than pink, and his vision was beginning to blur around the edges, as if he were looking through a fogged glass.
“Christ,” Harry responded. “
“Please,” he whined, his voice broken and strange in his own ears. He felt like he was ten feet above himself, his eyes shut tight against the sensations that threatened to overwhelm him. His fingers buzzed, and he dragged them through the head of hair on his chest. The hair was unusually soft, but it felt nice, perfect even. Draco was dragging his tongue over Harry’s chest, and though Harry’s breathing felt light and even, it skipped every time Draco brushed his tongue against his sensitive nipples. After what seemed like hours, Harry felt a finger press against him, and he was pulled back under the ocean of sensations. He didn’t register the stretching, or Draco’s preparations, but he did feel it when the man over him slid into him, brushing his prostate and making him hiss deliciously. “Pleasepleaseplease,” he muttered to himself, and he cried out when Draco rocked into him. It felt better than magic, better than butterbeer on a rainy day, better than anything. And when Draco leaned down and kissed Harry’s neck in just the right spot Harry’s whole body tensed.
“Ta, love,” Harry said, then they apparated away with a solid
“Okay, yeah we do, but will you stay after?” Harry asked, and Draco blessedly nodded.
“I’m not arguing with you on the clock,” Ron barely glanced down at Harry, who was trying to look petulant and annoyed.
“Mm. Bloody Fucking Brilliant,” Harry ground out, and then he whisked himself out of the kitchen and to the guest room two doors down, his magic crackling in the hallway.
“Tiberius, he’s a Bengal. And a menace,” Draco whispered back. “You can go find him, if you like.”
“What are the chances that you’re in my price range?” Harry smiled as the man next to him bristled.
“Inside bloke. Right. And how am
It was relieving when Draco bustled down the hallway, looking gaunt and tired, for he couldn’t possibly know about the significance of the day to Harry.
Harry nodded. They cleaned together in silence, plates clicking and water running intermittently. They picked up debris from the rooms of the house while the water boiled, straightening pillows and unsticking the lights from where they were draped along the walls. Draco called him in after a while, pouring rum into the tea when it was done steeping, adding lemon and honey. They sipped it in the garden, watching as the moon rose over the trees, hovering close to one another.
“Nice mud,” Harry would mutter while he scanned a report.
“Is he always like this?” Malfoy spoke quietly, but Harry could still hear him over the rush of blood in his ears and the thin walls between them. He didn’t listen for Ron’s response.
that you were in
“Starkly so, looks like a ghost when he’s not screaming like one,” Draco had smiled, happy to divulge, a fondness in his eyes that Harry tried not to be jealous of.
“Well that’s bollocks, has he even met you?” Malfoy was standing behind the couch, swirling a dark liquor and scowling at the papers in his hand. “You killed a mass murderer at seventeen, and he thinks you can’t handle a board meeting. Typical.” He had come over to retrieve some files on the Doxy wars for a recent case, but somewhere along the way Hermione and Ron had stumbled in, and then dinner was served, and so Malfoy was stuck in Grimmauld for the evening, fraying Harry’s nerves and chatting up his friends.
“No, no no no, Harry you absolute obnoxious idiot, don’t cry,” Malfoy said, wrapping his arms around Harry and running a hand down his back in a perfect recreation of Drake’s soothing motions. Harry wanted to rip Malfoy’s throat “Harry, you fool, look at me,” Malfoy tore Harry’s hands away from his eyes. “Harry. What’s my name?”
When he went to tea at Andy’s Harry was barely surprised to see Malfoy at her kitchen table, Teddy on his lap and what looked like pumpkin juice in his hand.
That night, Drake came screaming Harry’s name, and it felt so right that Harry had to fight to keep his mouth to himself. He cried after Drake left, curled up in his too-empty bed.
“May,” Hermione laughed into the bear-hug.
“Be patient,” Harry growled, and Drake stilled but continued to whine. Harry dragged him up by the ropes, until Drake was sitting back on his knees. There was a trail of precum that travelled from Drake’s cock to the pool on the table, and Harry wanted to taste it, so he did. As soon as his lips touched the head, Drake was arching up into his mouth, moaning wantonly. Harry didn’t move, he just let Drake fuck weakly into his mouth until he was gasping again, and Harry grasped the base of the man’s cock roughly, cutting off the imminent orgasm. Drake sobbed at the stimulation and struggled in his bonds even more aggressively than before.
It seemed that Harry was miraculously alone in his appraisal of Malfoy’s character. Everywhere he turned, people were singing praises for the stylish new “bad-boy” Auror, back from his fall into darkness.
It was insufferable, it was jarring, it was obnoxious, it was-
“But-”
He had spent quite a few evenings at Draco’s in the past month. He’d gone over on the weekends with Teddy, gone out to the botanical gardens, the aquarium, the park. He’d held Scorpius for long hours while Draco cooked, while Teddy chased Tiberius around the island of the kitchen. He’d been over after work, with Ron, drinks in hand and stories tumbling out of their mouths, slurred by alcohol and sharpened with adrenaline. He’d been over alone, he’d sat in the garden and watched the birds play in the deep red branches of the cherry plum tree, he’d laughed quietly as Draco told him about France, about how he found Tiberius, about his childhood dream of becoming an astronaut and starting the first magic school on the moon.
“Yeah, right, like I’m supposed to fucking believe that.” Malfoy tossed the scrap in the trash, and Harry glowered.
“Harry! Breakfast! And news!” Ron called over his shoulder, and though Harry was still pissed, he let Ron’s smile placate him, just a bit. He slid into his chair (which was luckily unmarred by past occupants) and poured himself some tea from the charmed pot in the center of the table. Hermione handed him a copy of the Quibbler, and Harry gratefully accepted it. He thumbed through the pages, searching for the missed connections and, though he would never admit it, the obituaries. But for some reason, the third page was stuck. Stuck hard, as if someone used an industrial-strength sticking charm.
“Did you see Sunday’s Quibbler?” Malfoy asked him, his voice careful.
When he woke up, his arms were wrapped tightly around a sleeping Draco Malfoy, and he was so quintessentially happy that he kissed every ounce of Draco’s skin he could find, until they were cuddled up and giggling in the early morning light.
“Why did you go to a sex dungeon?” Draco retaliated, and Harry saw his point. “We still need to do our jobs, Harry,” Draco smiled, running a hand along Harry’s jaw.
“Yeah mate, sounds about right,” Ron responded, and Harry felt his heart break a little. A family. A real family. It seemed so precious and lovely, and so painfully unattainable. Harry tried to ignore the tiny voice in the back of his head, the voice that forced him to realize that his friends weren’t his, but a knot of anticipation was nonetheless forming in his stomach. They had a family. Harry was part of it, sure, but he was also firmly outside of the world-stopping love Hermione and Ron had for each other- a passerby who was looking through shop windows as he walked. He would never marry Ginny, they would never have family getaways together, they wouldn’t raise their kids together. He was happy, of course, blissfully, overwhelmingly happy, but underneath it all he felt the boundaries come up. The walls that signified growing up, moving on. The bittersweet truth of being a side character in someone else’s loving romance story- a witness to unimaginable beauty.
Draco was the next to fall apart, clutching at his sides. His smile broke his face in half, and Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever witnessed that expression on him before.
“Mm, it’s nothing.” Draco rose, wiping away his tears and tucking his hair behind his ears. “Tea?”
“It’s the fucking truth Malfoy, and if you think I’m lying, then I guess you’ll just be leaving me to deal with criminals on my own, which would look pretty bad on your yearly evals, wouldn’t it.” Harry prickled. He was feeling even more bitter towards Malfoy since… well, since Drake left. “I’ll write it down again,” Harry sighed, and he got out another scrap.
“Ree! I’m a dragon!” He squealed, flushed and warm in Harry’s arms.
“What’s tonight?” Harry glanced up from the stack of papers that crowded his desk. Now that he was looking closer, he could see the lines of tension in Draco as he leaned a hand on the door jamb, idly picking at the molding.
“We do.”
“I’m so fucking stupid…” Harry clutched at Draco’s shirt, basking in the heat of him. “It’s-” Harry pulled back. “Why were you working in a sex dungeon?” He asked.
And every time he left, the urge to stay got stronger. The urge to never leave the warm home with the leaky faucet in the downstairs bath, the urge to keep sitting in the wicker porch chairs and let Draco talk him to sleep, the urge to close the distance between them before he left, to break down and beg Draco to let him stay. Anything to keep him from his own house, crowded with ghosts of a war and blood magic that wasn’t his, a family that would never be his.
Harry was lucky enough to learn that, with his borrowed years. He was lucky enough to learn that the flowers in his garden bloomed while he was waiting for his microwave to chime. He was lucky enough to witness that the winter passed while he looked forward to a luncheon in spring. He was lucky enough to see that Life trickled in while he waited for the big events, the punctuation marks, the things he wrung his hands over and worried his thumbs about.
“Do you like him?”
“What do you want,” Harry choked out, struggling to keep his hips from arching up and grinding into the lap of the man on top of him. Drake’s eyes flashed brilliantly.
“What?”
Malfoy looked him up and down slowly, analyzing every curve and movement. “Nor I,” he said, shrugging. “Distaste isn’t quite as striking on this face, lovely as it is.” Malfoy mused, and Harry bristled at the criticism, as backhanded as it was. Raucous laughter burst from a far table, and Harry flinched at the interruption.
Christmas wasn’t a complete disaster. Hermione and Ron shared their news, and there were many cheers and good tidings shared. Malfoy charmed the whole house in a matter of hours. Molly and Aurthur were quiet at first, but Malfoy’s general compliments on the house, the cooking and the decorations warmed Molly and placated Aurthur, at least enough for them to ease at Malfoy’s jarring presence. Bill and Charlie were dismissive, but not unkind. Only George was actively cold towards him, but that was pretty adjacent to how he usually acted in the Burrow, as if he were missing something important and couldn’t find it. Teddy ran around with Victorie, his hair a brilliant rainbow of color, high on joy and oblivious to the small threads of tension that were pulling at the adults.
“Did you eat yet?” Harry asked, and Drake shook his head. “Good.”
He really couldn’t pinpoint the reason he hated the Malfoys so much. Perhaps it was how unassumingly bland they were. They were one of the most powerful families in the world, and yet they still clung to shadows and switched allegiances in the drop of a hat. They were rats parading about in top hats and a general air of superiority that grated Harry’s nerves. And sure, Malfoy didn’t always wear robes like his father, and he laughed sometimes, and once Harry thought he saw Malfoy wearing unmatched socks- but that didn’t mean he wasn’t still a prick.
“Thank you. And yes, you did.” Harry sighed, dropping into the matching chair of the gigantic cabinet-desk that was braced against the wall. He fiddled with the hem of his shirt for a few long moments, listening to the sound of Hermione rolling the ladder around the stacks.
“Really?” Hermione feigned shock. A hole was torn in the thick curtains that were draped over the window, and dust floated through the beam of light over Hermione’s shoulder, illuminating her fly-away curls with a backdrop of gold.
“Harry,” was Draco’s harshly whispered reply, and he rolled his eyes as Harry blundered past it.
The curse was all Harry’s fault. He was the one who was supposed to watch the team’s back as they picked their way through the wards in the ancient building. Harry had underestimated the kickback of rushing in. He had misjudged the angle, he had acted carelessly. He had plucked the wrong cord of the protection spells on the third floor, and he’d barely had time to act before Draco had shouted at them to
“You-”
“Harry,” he countered, one foot in the cool green flames. Harry didn’t say anything for a few long seconds, and then he reached out a hand. Draco looked at it, frowned, swallowed, then slowly took it, solid and warm. Harry squeezed, shook it once.
“That happens.”
with him. He’d die before he let it happen. But then here he was, and there Drake was, humming under his breath and making Harry’s cuppa in exactly the way he likes it and… oh
Harry went to the party, pulling on an old shirt and muddying the knees of his pants to go as himself, then thinking better of it and changing, dragging in his nicest robes. After staring in the mirror for a few long minutes, he decided to use some sight potions and leave his glasses on the counter, charming his hair bright pink and squinting through the headache that was already forming. He would go as Teddy.
“I’ve made a friend,” Harry said quietly as he walked back into the kitchen, cradling Tiberius in his arms.
When Draco Malfoy stopped him in the street, his eyes sunken and skin pale, Harry took his hand. This was the deal he had struck with Life.
“It’s fine. Draco, there’s a sweet hotel down the street called ‘The Impeccable Pig.’ It’s truly lovely, trust us,” Hermione grinned and looked at Ron, who flamed red. Draco laughed easily with them, and Harry’s chest tightened. “They have a few spare wizarding rooms that are usually open. I’ll call now and check.” Hermione eased out of her chair and meandered down the hall, leaving Harry alone with his best friend and his worst nightmare. Well, second worst.
“Can I help you, sir?” Malfoy offered humbly, as though Harry wasn’t two moves from tearing his throat out and leaving the country, let alone the case.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Harry just held him tighter, and the night pressed up against them, wrapping them both up in its quiet darkness.
“I see that! Who am I?” Harry replied, pulling back to see recognition sparkle in Teddy’s eyes.
Their romance was just as gentle, just as cautious as it had been when they were only just friends. Harry spent most of his time in Draco’s kitchen over the next month, kissing him, holding him, revelling in the fact that they were nothing at all like Harry had expected them to be. Draco was shy and subtle and endlessly patient. Harry was full of light, he was kind and endearing and romantic. They were careful with each other, careful with the grief that hung over them sometimes, careful with the bliss.
“Harry if you say Draco is up to something I
“Aurors,” Robards warned, but he looked more confused than angry.
“He must be lonely, without Astoria,” she continued, and Harry started.
“I’m staying in London.”
“Harry? Mate, Draco asked you if you’re staying here tonight.” Ron nudged Harry’s hand. The dark mahogany clock in the entryway dinged ten times, and Harry shrugged.
Harry Potter could not fall in love with a muggle. He wouldn’t fucking allow it. He wouldn’t put them in danger like that, even if the git did have pretty eyes, and a perfect ass, and even if he fucked him eight ways to Sunday at least once a week. He wouldn’t fall in love with a muggle. He wouldn’t fall in love with a muggle sex worker. He isn’t falling in love with the man he
“You trust him?” Harry fiddled with his buttons again, shrugging off his cloak and relaxing into his home.
“Language, Mr. Potter.” Andy interrupted, and Teddy’s eyes went wide.
to not scare him away like that. Every time you come into the room he skitters away like a mouse.” Andy sat across from him and poured them their tea, piping hot and steeped to perfection. Teddy climbed up onto Harry’s lap and grabbed his hand, brushing his small fingers over the scars he found, pale little treasures traced onto Harry’s rich skin.
.” They were tangled together now, a mess of limbs and hearts and tea.
“Wouldn’t be too sure. Our inside bloke will recognize you in a heartbeat,” Ron sniffed, then pulled his wand out from underneath his red Auror robes.
and then he was out the door, walking away from Draco’s home with quick jittery steps.
Draco’s townhouse was nothing like Harry expected. The warm summer day filled the rooms with light, and all the windows were open, bringing in a dancing breeze and the smell of sage from the garden. The walls were covered in intricate wallpaper, faded in places and fresh in others. All of the furniture was dark and rich, and it contrasted hilariously with the baby-proofing charms that were littered throughout the house, glowing in soft pastel colors and sparkling against the afternoon sun. They had tea in Draco’s kitchen, mismatched cups on chipped saucers, the white tile glowing brightly, a vase of yellow roses sitting softly on the counter by the sink.
“I’ll help clean up,” Harry said, but he didn’t move, and Draco receded back into the house to bid his guests farewell.
The next week, Harry booked Drake for five hours and took him to a coffee shop, where they talked about their childhoods growing up as wizards. Drake grew up pureblood, and he went to Beauxbatons. Harry shared that he was raised by muggles, and he lied, saying he went to Durmstrang. They talked about work, and Harry said he worked in the Ministry, but he didn’t divulge where. They talked about their favorite quidditch teams, their annoying coworkers, their friends and their fears. It was so easy to talk to Drake, to watch him laugh at Harry’s stories about his childhood, to watch him eat biscuits in a way that was so achingly familiar, it was rattling and comforting all at once. And when he watched Drake suck chocolate off his finger, he felt absolutely perfect dragging him out the door and apparating him straight into bed, where Harry finished with Drake’s perfect cock fucking him into oblivion.
“I don’t kiss on the mouth, and I won’t do anything that involves scarring. Try not to pull my hair, but if that’s what you’re really into then it’s fine. My safe word is Chimera, and I don’t need any aftercare, so you’re free to leave when you’re done.” Drake took Harry’s hand in his and kissed his thumb. “We can go slow, you have me for three hours.” Drake’s eyes looked large and lusty, his pupils dilated just from the chat.
Ron snickered, his cheeks streaked with wetness. Harry sat, chastised and sulky.
! That’s your
“I, well I… Don’t know,” Harry sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose beneath his glasses. “He’s… Different than I thought. He’s… I may have misjudged him.”
When Draco Malfoy stopped by, Harry couldn’t bring himself to get angry, too overwhelmed and drained to muster up any foul feelings or bitter words. He watched as Draco hugged Ron, a hand clasped to his cheek, words whispered between them. Draco had brought a gift, wrapped in silver wrapping paper and shining brightly in his hand.
And now Draco Malfoy was in his fucking office, prancing about and bringing Ron tea every once in a while, as if he was wanted there. Harry wanted to throttle him. Or throttle himself. He wasn’t quite sure which one.
And Draco’s muttered response that he was
“Harry dear, come in, come in!” Andy puttered about, putting the kettle on and sliding a tray of biscuits across the table. Malfoy didn’t look at him.
a terrible idea. They were going to do it.
Draco smiled back, his own silver eyes going molten. “Consider them shaken.”
“Yes, yes yes,” came the muffled reply, and Harry lifted Drake’s hips until he could reach the buttons, then he dragged the pants down and off the body in front of him. Drake’s cock brushed against the table and Harry brushed it with his fingers. “
want to think about his most annoying coworker on a night where he was supposed to be having fun. The man smiled, and Harry eased into one of the two leather chairs.
it’s just.
“You’re joking.” Both his friends were watching him now, Hermione with tears spilling down her face. The bacon was burning. “This isn’t funny.”
“Do we?” He asked, and his cringe was barely visible, but Harry felt it.
When Harry kissed him for the first time, it was mostly an accident.
friends. Harry wasn’t okay with the sandstorm of jealousy in his head, battering against his skull while Malfoy took a drag from a charmed cigarette that left no smoke and made the room smell like treacle. He wasn’t okay with the shiny gold wedding band that glimmered on Malfoy’s finger. And he certainly wasn’t okay with the fact that Draco Malfoy was not hiding away in some hole somewhere, but instead fighting crime in France, doing the exact same job as Harry, and in some instances, doing it
“You were on the front page.”
When he finished, Drake was still watching him hazily. He was barely there still, and Harry smiled as he kissed his temple. Even though the man had said it was unnecessary, Harry cleaned them both and wrapped Drake in a blanket before he got dressed.
Harry only panicked for a second, but it was long enough to throw him even further off guard when a tall, lithe blond waltzed through the swinging doors that lead from the storage rooms of the establishment.
They’d talked until the small hours of morning, until the sky lightened on the horizon, until their voices had gone tired and shaky. Draco led Harry to the floo with a hand around his wrist, tiptoeing around squeaky floorboards. Tiberus meowed as they passed, and Draco shushed him softly. Harry had followed blindly, his eyes on Draco’s hair, on the Auror robes they both still wore, on the hand that rested on his arm, his skin.
“Drake,” Harry said, making the man pause with his hand on the door handle.
“Hey, I don’t make the rules, just play by ‘em.” Ron shrugged, pulling Harry into a side-along as he spoke. The sudden apparition barely impacted the conversation, and Harry continued to grouse as they landed.
“How is it-” Draco said, a flush high on his cheeks, “that you always get exactly what you want?”
“I-” Harry began, but Ron glared at him. “Fine.” He slumped back into his chair. A few seconds passed before Harry glanced up again, and Ron looked all too pleased with himself. The fire cracked, and it reminded Harry of jeering laughter. Fuck, he wouldn’t be surprised if this murderous house was laughing at him, it seemed to have a shine for dark humor.
“Lovely night,” Draco said, his hands cupped around his drink, steam curing up and around his face. His tears had dried, leaving only a telling gloss over his eyes and a shadow of a frown.
“I do.”
“I know I’m not… what you expected. But I’m everything you know. I promise.” Draco broke the silence carefully, and Harry shuddered. Draco was everything he had wanted with Drake and more, and it had taken the bloke pushing him to tears to realize it.
of it all, I swear!” Hermione was sitting in the loveseat across from him, her feet perched on a footstool and a cooling charm hovering around her.
They also talked about the joys life held. Draco told Harry that he always looked forward to Saturday, when he could hear the church bells from down the street chime every hour. He told him that he hadn’t cried when Astoria passed, he’d just held Scorpius for hours, held him and held him, seeing her eyes and her smile in his little face. Harry told Draco about his favorite pair of socks, the ones that made him smile every time he put them on, though they weren’t particularly special. Harry talked about his patronus, about how it changed after the war, about how he used Ron and Hermione’s wedding as his happiest memory because it had been rainy and warm, a haze of messiness and perfection.
“Ah, of course. Quite right.” Malfoy’s face had gone quite pale, and Harry was comforted by the fact that Malfoy looked as though he’d been chastised. He turned to walk out into the hall, but something took over in Harry and he grabbed Malfoy’s arm before he could leave.
He followed Draco to the floo as he left, catching the blond’s arm before he could make his escape.
“I just… well. He’s…”
--on Ron’s shoulder, and Harry bit back a growl.
“Ah, thank you. Not a fan, Edward?” Draco took a bite of the nibbled biscuit and Teddy scrunched up his nose comically.
“Toi, toujours toi,” Malfoy answered back, and his eyes met Harry’s.
“What are you playing at, Malfoy,” Harry spat, shoving him up against the wall. There was a wand holster on Malfoy’s arm, covering the… Harry gulped and shoved the other man again. “Why are you really here.”
It went like this, often. Harry tried to peel back the layers of Draco that his friends had already seen, already cherished, and he would end up with a wall thrust up at him, Malfoy’s eyes shuttered against him and his closed mouth set in a grim line.
Duchene up for a long, long time, and when he came back down to the ground floor, Duchene was thoroughly stunned, Ron was checking and double-checking all the potions Cho had gathered from the storage, and Draco Malfoy was staring at him with his own molten silver eyes.
“And do you like him?”
“Oh Harry, I would never!” She looked concerned, and Harry glared at her. She caved, dropping her act. “Well, alright, if you insist. I told you so.”
When he pushed the doors open, it was as if he’d been thrust back in time. Barely anything had changed in the year since Harry had been there last. Cigar smoke still clung to the air, thick and heavy, and Harry had to remind himself to breathe through the terrible urge to hurl. The clientele was still angsty and brooding, with promises of danger and contempt in their eyes. Harry ignored them.
Harry could not, in fact, believe it.
“Excuse me?” Harry responded, his insecurities dragging out the worst side of him.
Ron sounded frantic, and Harry was nearly guilted into following directions, but then the back door slammed open and Jason Duchene slithered in. He was flanked by two of the huge bodyguards, and he was beelining for Harry.
When the knock on the door came, Harry felt his heart leap into his throat. But it was just Malfoy, looking shaken. His eyes were wide as he crossed the threshold, and he looked at Harry as if he had grown a horn. They stood in silence for a moment, and Malfoy just stared hard, at Harry, at the chairs by the coffee table, at the door to the bedroom, at the kitchen counters that were covered in mugs, Drake’s shirt that hung untouched over the back of a kitchen chair.
“Do you think the veil is truly thinner tonight?” Draco looked lost, blurry and young in the dim light.
It was, again, Hermione who found them there, clutching at each other. She looked back and forth between them, rolled her eyes and closed the closet door, took a few steps away, then came back and opened it again.
Harry held out a biscuit, then pulled it back right before Teddy took it. “It’s like licorice, so you might not like it.” Teddy nodded sagely and sniffed it cautiously before he took a tiny bite with his one front tooth.
“Me? Are you me? I like your hair!” Teddy jumped up and down, his own hair flashing pink, then back to green. Teddy dragged him through every room, pointing out the costumes and describing what they were supposed to be. “Aunty Luna is a star, see! And Hermie is a queen, did you see her crown? And Uncle Ron is a pod, and Rosie is a pea with Scorbus. Draco is a knight, and Grams said she was an angel, but she’s not wearing a costume.”
