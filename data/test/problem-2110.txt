There we have it! Next week's chapter is "pregnant" (I mean... could it have been anything else? haha)
“Okay so we need...” Harry squinted at the list he wrote on a scrap piece of parchment. Draco snatched it out of his hand, sighing, “I can’t believe you are incapable of reading your own handwriting.” He smoothed out the crinkled piece and read out loud, “a gift for Ron, Hermione, Molly, Adelaide... Harry, you just wrote down most of the people we know.”
‘I don’t!’ Harry said in a raised voice and Draco tried his best not to cower away from the fighting Alphas. ‘I want it this way!’
Harry stopped walking, jerking Draco, who hadn’t noticed that Harry had stopped walking, back. ‘Here it is.’
Memory-Hermione stepped away from the fighting Alphas and left the floor. ‘This is where I left to talk to you,’ Hermione explained.
The appointment went much like before; Draco settling on the settee with Harry, both peppermint teas, a short chat about what Healer Roberts was going to do and then Healer Roberts was muttering spells under her breath and looking at them and a set of stones on her desk. Once she dropped her wand, she gave them a minute to gather their thoughts, before asking, “so how are you feeling?” It was an open question, and one clearly directed at the both of them.
he could still go into heat and if so, how close he’d be to one. It was more than unusual for male Omega’s to have heats past the age of 30, and Remus was certainly older than that. Maybe it had something to do with the limited contact and constant bond sickness. “I could ask Harry if he’d be amenable to vouch for you. I don’t think I’d be able to sway Hermione on her own.” He lowered his tone, adding, “she doesn’t seem to like you - either of you. Do you suspect…?”
‘Or Harry and I could visit as a couple,’ Draco said quietly, unsure about his own idea. He and Harry hadn’t bonded yet  but it wasn’t uncommon for Alphas to want to speak with the teachers, tutors or mentors the Omega had had. It could also imply that Draco was pregnant, because there was a day-care centre at Myrion as well, but Draco tried not to think about that.
Harry waited for a little while and then softly asked, “I saw the leaflets were about pregnancy... and two of the books, too.” He turned his head and pressed his lips against Draco’s hair, gently. “We haven’t really talked about having children. Is that something you want?”
“I like it,” he breathed. Upon Harry’s inquisitive hum, Draco elaborated, “you have no idea how good it feels when you…” He was sure though, that Harry would’ve felt Draco’s response through the bond.
Hermione blinked. She waved her wand, conjuring a chair in front of her desk. ‘I can’t promise that I won’t tell him, but we can talk.’
“They say you’re right on schedule with your healing,” Harry added. “It’ll be a few more weeks but…”
“It’s your stupid Alpha lizard brain.” Draco couldn’t keep the dissatisfaction, the insecurity, the tremble out of his voice.
His saviour growled. His feet knocked into a soft, warm body but it wasn’t pleasant. ‘Christ, be careful, you don’t have to hit me.’
‘Fine,’ Mrs Weasley said curtly. ‘Fine, you can do the intimate courtship but only if you promise, Harry, to never, take advantage of my beautiful boy. If he tells me you’ve hurt him or forced him to things he didn’t really want to, I
Draco hesitated for a split-second, and then placed his hand on Harry’s knee. “I hate that your work has you coming and going at irregular hours, sometimes not coming home at all... every time I feel sick, thinking you could've  been killed.”
“Congratulations.” He matched her tone, keeping his voice quiet. “Will you be taking her bond mark, too?” Adelaide’s old mark had faded to an ugly scar at the side of her throat, but rebonding could make the area clean again, hiding the scarred tissue behind a new bond mark.
Adelaide moved over, sat down next to him and tenderly draped her arm over his shoulders, pulling him closer. He let his body fell against hers, hiding his face against her shoulder.
Curiously, Draco picked up on of the flat things and considered the picture before turning it over and reading the back. He did this with all of the things and eventually picked one with an impossibly pale male on the front and a semi-attractive brunette. ‘I think we’ll watch this one.’
Harry stepped back a little and then sat down on the floor. He was quiet for a good while, but then, nothing more than a hushed whisper, “tell me what to do.”
WHY WHY WHY do I always want to use complicated grammatical structures I don't really know how to use? Urgh. I hope this was readable, I really took my time editing and took out sentences that were weird/that made me question my grammar.
Draco placed his hand in the crook of Harry’s arm, closing his eyes just in time before they apparated.
‘No,’ Harry confirmed. ‘Ginny and I were childhood sweethearts, yes, and it made sense to be together at the time, but having both presented as Alphas we fought all the time about who was in charge and who could take the decisions and so many other things. I have a strong personality and she has one too and I was sick of fighting with her all the time. We fought more than we did fun things.’ He seemed to ponder over what to say next and eventually said, much softer, ‘we couldn’t even share a bed without fighting constantly.’
The stranger did not comment, and instead pointed his wand at Draco’s face, whispering another spell in that cold, hissy voice, and Draco felt his throat constrict, restricting his breathing. If he breathed through his nose, it was okay, but the use of his mouth had been completely cut off. With tremendous effort, he pulled up one hip and forced it back down when the stranger kneeled next to his head to undo the top shackles, kicking him square in the stomach.
Contrary to what he had expected Harry didn’t do objectionable things to him, having him ordered to obey. Harry lifted Draco into his lap.
Draco’s eyes widened and he made an expectant noise, lifting his hips off the matrass to give Harry better access, making the Alpha grunt, ‘you’re so perfect,’ and proceeding to fuck Draco into the matrass. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist, moaning, lost in pleasure, but at the same time, still needing… He pushed his head back, offering his throat and Harry laughed breathlessly, ‘not yet,’ making the Omega cry out desperately.
A house elf let them into a drawing room, where Astoria and her older sister sat. They both stood up when Draco and Harry entered. The older sister shook Harry’s hand, introducing herself as, ‘Daphne Greengrass, pleasure to meet you,’ to which Harry replied, ‘Harry Potter, thank you for having me.’ She bent forward a little, as if expecting Harry to either kiss her hand or maybe her cheek, but then seemed to notice Draco. ‘I see you’ve brought someone along,’ she said slowly, as if not sure yet what she thought of this.
‘Good,’ Harry said and he placed his hand in the small of Draco’s back. ‘Do you want to look around first?’
“It’s not uncommon in male Omega pregnancies, especially those that have had a little help along the way,” Healer Roberts explained. “There’s no need to worry about anything, we’ll just schedule your checkups to be a little more frequent.”
Now Draco understood why Lupin had felt the need to act submissive. He didn’t want to offend Draco with his proposal.
“I do!” Draco looked up, finding that his Alpha looked quite forlorn. Guilt washed over him and he didn’t know what to say.
‘Oh dear, it’s…’ she put her arms around him and hugged him, ‘it’s quite all right, sweetie, no need to thank me, hmm, I’m just doing what is right…’ She let go of him after that and smiled that motherly smile again. ‘Now, shall we go downstairs?’
‘You can come when you take my fist.’ It sounded hot and Draco moaned once more, now pushing back against Harry’s hand eagerly, wanting to be good, wanting to come.
Harry made to knock, but Draco barged in, sank down on the couch and waited for Hermione to give him a cup of tea.
Harry smiled. “Yeah.” He sat down next to Draco and let the breakfast tray float right beside them. “Want some?”
Hermione slipped out of the office, shutting the door firmly behind her. ‘Of course I will.’ She gave Harry a mild slap on the wrist, the one hand he still held in the small of Draco’s back. Draco made a soft, whiny noise out of irritation and then bit his lip. Hermione was clearly an Alpha, he knew that somehow, so he wasn’t supposed to contradict her actions like that.
“Yeah.” Lupin rubbed his wrists over each other, an absentminded gesture that Draco recognised with pain in his heart. It was another weak attempt at self-placation. If there was anything Lupin didn’t feel, it was
I was supposed to write it in one sitting on Sunday, but like Draco, I too needed a bath to help me cool down.
“Yeah.” With a wave of his hand, Harry wordlessly casted a stasis charm over the bathwater, ensuring it would stay warm. Draco could feel his magic settle into the water. The feeling was hard to describe, it was like a million pinpricks, but it didn’t hurt. Instead, it was almost pleasant, like the touch of someone wearing a velvet glove.
Having read it through again now, (whilst re-writing some things) I feel like it's good enough to be uploaded.
Draco felt a smile form on his lips. ‘I would.’ Even though the things Hermione wrote were usually on a whole different level than Draco was used to, he enjoyed reading them nonetheless. It was fun and interesting and most always it was about improving the life for Omegas, which was something he was always interested in.
“Sure.” Harry stepped closer to the cribs and read the registration number on the tiny wrist bands the children had, and wrote their names on the paper.
Harry’s hand slid down, gripping Draco’s hip and forcing it down so he could undo the front tie of his trousers. Draco happily let it happen. He let his lips slide over Harry’s neck, sucking deep bruises into his skin and not caring how puberal that made them look. Harry was
‘Harry,’ he whispered, trying to catch the Alpha’s gaze, but Harry pushed Draco’s head back gently and let his teeth graze over the Omega’s throat.
‘Ah, yes, we’ve not quite come to bonding yet,’ Harry nodded, ‘Draco has recently moved to a different Alpha and needs some time to adjust, but everything has been settled already, of course.’ He smiled a rather fake smile and then bowed for Astoria, who graciously bowed back, making Draco feel jealous.
‘Ron and I share this floor, we have our own bedroom and bathroom here, as well as a room for Ron’s “experiments”.’ Hermione hadn’t done the actual air quotes thing, but it was obvious from how she spoke.
‘No. Hermione told me about this store where they apparently make the best clothing for Omegas and pushed me to take you there so you can pick some new things you like, instead of the things Molly patched up for you.’
Hermione looked up from her work and she seemed to be surprised to see Draco was alone. These days, it was strange to find him more than a few feet away from his Alpha.
‘Hmm, is that okay?’ Harry whispered against his ear. Draco moaned and pushed back against Harry’s finger. ‘More… I need more…’
“Your observation skills continue to baffle me.” Draco turned back around and busied himself with the garlands, tinsel and baubles. “Could you hand me the bells?”
Draco slowly started inching closer to Harry. Harry let out a nervous laugh. “Draco, what are you –”
“Look at that, don’t they look nice,” Healer Roberts commented before pointing out all the features of their child like she had done before. She manipulated the image with a light wave of her wand, and Draco was sure he recognised at least some of the shape. It looked decidedly more human-shaped than last time.
‘Harry left an Alpha-Alpha relationship to court me.’ Draco squeezed his eyes shut and focussed on the feelings of betrayal and anger, instead of how hurt he was.
Draco spread his legs a little, allowing Harry to slide in between his thighs. They weren’t allowed to have penetratative sex yet - and Draco honestly couldn’t imagine enjoying that right now - but this, this they could do. It felt good to feel Harry’s weight over him, to feel the Alpha respond to his body, to feel confident with his body again.
He leaned into her touch and tried not to cry, in which he failed miserably. ‘I… he left,’ he sobbed. Mrs Weasley guided him back to a chair and sat him down. ‘Now now, no need to be so sad because Harry left, I’m sure he had to go back to work or do something else. Not all of us have the liberty to be at home all day. He is a busy man.’ She handed him a handkerchief. He wiped away his tears and tried to push away the overwhelming feeling that he had been rejected again.
Sometimes he’d write in his Omega-journal, which had been a gift from Harry during their courtship. The journal became linked to the Omega owner, who would be the only one capable of opening and reading the journal. It was for his most private thoughts and he found himself using it more and more these days, now that he had more things to think about and ideas to process.
When Draco woke up, Harry was sitting next to his bed with two pieces of paper in his hands. The children, in separate cribs on the other side of the bed, were asleep.
While Draco took a moment to catch his breath, Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s neck, lightly kissing their bond mark and pressing his hips against Draco’s again.
Eventually, Remus broke it. “The Ministry has determined the information Sirius has given as useful, and as such, classified. It is hard to argue for a pardon when the information cannot be levied in open trial. Furthermore, it proves hard to convince them that Sirius is not dangerous, and is not a flight risk.”
Draco laughed light-heartedly. ‘And then they things about clingy Omegas… I was just upstairs, talking to Hermione.’ Harry’s hand found its usual place in the small of Draco’s back and he sighed a little, enjoying even these light touches.
“I mean it, Draco.” Harry sounded a lot more serious now. “Maybe I haven’t given it that much thought, yet, but I would like to have kids and if you want them now then that is something I want, too.”
‘But…’ he tried, but she interrupted him. ‘You’ve been so good, but I need you to back to sleep now, okay? Just go back to sleep.’
Ginny was present too, and she was grumpy as ever. On the other side of the room, she was complaining about something in a loud, annoyed tone. Draco decided to avoid her as much as he could. He let Harry guide them towards Adelaide and Arthur, who were chatting on the couch. Draco let himself sink down next to Adelaide while Harry settled on the armrest. Adelaide wore a scarf and Draco let his eyes flit over it, hesitating if he’d say something about it, but before he could, Molly called everyone into the kitchen. “It’s time to eat! Come get your fill.”
“Clinic mentioned that they sustain upwards of 90% of all male Omega pregnancies once you make it past twelve weeks,” Draco responded, trying not to guide the conversation to a subject that would be uncomfortable for Lupin.
What do you think? Are all three victims of abuse? Or maybe just one or two? What is up with Luna's Alpha?
Harry chuckled, ‘wrong question,’ just as Hermione exploded, ‘of course we don’t have those! That’s slavery!’
He would have been content with staying in bed and cuddling for a little while longer, but Harry had gently pushed him into getting dressed and going downstairs for breakfast.
Harry laughed again and it was such a nice, warm sound that Draco couldn’t help but purr a little. ‘You need an Alpha that will take good care of you, if you have that I don’t think heats are that bad.’
So he plastered himself to Harry’s side instead, spending most of his time in the office, close to his mate. Harry seemed bored out of his mind with the endless stream of paperwork that was his job now, and sometimes Draco thought the only reason Harry was still working at all was because Draco was keeping such a close eye on him. The domesticity of it all was comforting to Draco.
If you've received a notification of my uploading this chapter, but haven't read last week's chapter yet (I modified the PSA into chapter 7 instead of deleting the PSA and uploading a new chapter), please go back one chapter to be all caught up again!
It was a bright, sunny Saturday morning and Harry, Ron and Arthur were working in the Grimmauld Place backyard. Hermione was at work - they’d recently lost another employee of the ORO to the law department, and even though Hermione didn’t complain much, Draco had the idea she was buried in work.
‘Harry and I got into a fight,’ he blurted out, unable to keep quiet with her trying so hard to make him talk.
Just a little note before you start: There is a name mentioned (Myrion), and for those who misunderstand/don't understand, that is the tiny Omega school Draco went to.
Draco whimpered in anticipation and pushed himself up a bit more in an attempt to get closer to Harry. Harry, however, put his hands on Draco’s shoulders and pushed him back down. ‘Stay. You’re not allowed to come out until your temperature is back to normal.’
“I need to talk to you about something.” From across the office, lounging on the couch that stood there mostly so Draco had a settee to lounge on, it was easier to start talking.
Harry sat in one of the rickety kitchen chairs, looking calm, relaxed and at ease. Draco’s heart jumped and then he cursed himself. He was not in heat anymore, there was no need for his body to respond to Harry – or should he go back to saying Mr Potter?
‘You still need to give me enough space to be your Alpha though,’ Harry said sternly, ‘and you need to take the space you need for… I don’t know, Omega stuff.’
Every square centimeter of Draco was sore, and even the soft sheets against his skin felt scratchy. He was tired, and even breathing felt labouring. The sun shone in his eyes, making him feel warm, a blessing among all his other aches.
Harry immediately noted the shifted mood, and let his hand slip off Draco’s stomach, replacing it on his hip. “I’m sorry.”
Locating Riddles file took time, because it wasn’t where it was supposed to be, Hermione explained when she returned a few hours later. She immediately left the house again though, muttering something Draco couldn’t quite hear, but it was clear to him she had left to allow him and Harry to have some private time.
“Come on, we need water-based paint,” Lupin said, and he lifted his hand as if he wanted to use it to guide Draco along, before deciding against it, dropping his hand again. “It’s the safest thing to use.”
“I like it,” Draco repeated whilst slowly releasing his death grip on the counter. “Should we move back upstairs?”
‘Good afternoon,’ Adelaide greeted formally and she gave Hermione a nod – she couldn’t do more, still holding Draco, but she had noticed Hermione was an Alpha, Draco knew, because she adopted the standard etiquette for greeting Alphas. ‘Could you bring as back home, please? Draco is very upset.’
‘Much better.’ Draco moved over to the edge of the tub and stretched his hand out, grabbing Harry’s and pulling the Alpha closer. When Harry was close enough, he kneeled next to the tub. Draco bend forwards and kissed his Alpha, trying to entice him into biting him. ‘I don’t want to wait anymore,’ he mumbled.
‘Probably not…’ Harry shrugged. ‘Most Omega need a few heats before their fertility kicks in and it’s harder for two men to conceive than it is for a man and a female.’
Harry sniffed and made a soft noise. He placed his arm around Draco’s waist again and made him turn so that they were face to face. Draco stared at him, breathless, hanging somewhere between feeling aroused and awkward.
“Yes.” Draco let himself sink down into the soft blankets, patting the spot next to him to invite Harry once more.
‘Just a little over a week now.’ She frowned a little. ‘At first you were so weak we weren’t sure you were going to make it. I think you might have lost a few days’ worth of memories.’
Draco bit his lower lip nervously. ‘Well I… I wanted to thank you, sir… Mrs… Molly told me I was… that I nearly died and I understand you were part of the team that… brought me here.’
As Draco stared into the sunset, the sounds of his girls playing around him, Harry dozing on the chair next to him, and Remus and Sirius walking off on a walk to the beach, he decided that this was his happy ending, and nothing would ever come between him, and it, ever again.
Harry pushed Draco out of the kitchen, ‘well, so far for the first living room and the kitchen. There’s a second living room right here…’ he opened a door and closed it again swiftly. ‘It’s used by Ron and Hermione mostly though,’ he said as he guided Draco up the stairs. ‘When I was younger I used to sleep in the bedroom right there,’ he pointed and the door opened. ‘It’s a guest bedroom now, where you and Adelaide will be sleeping tonight. There’s a bathroom attached, too.’ Harry showed Draco the bathroom and Draco gasped. ‘It’s huge!’
Remus re-entered the room with Draco’s hospital bag. He extended his arm, wanting to give it to Hermione when Draco let go of the Alpha. “I don’t - I can’t -”
‘So you were… I saw your picture in the Prophet,’ he eventually said, very much aware of how closely they were being watched by Mr and Mrs Weasley.
‘I already have the bathwater running for you. Come on.’ Harry grabbed Draco by his arm and the touch send a jolt of electricity through Draco that made him grit his teeth.
When he could see the pair relax from his peripheral vision, he relaxed his hands and shoulders, and turned a little more towards the couple. Remus already had more colour on his face, his eyes, usually dull and sharp, observative but disinterested, were now lit up with colour and focussed on his mate.
‘The one on my side is from my elegant movements lessons I has this morning with my tutor, Miss Fawley, sir.’
Crawling deeper into the blankets, pushing and pulling on the duvet to make it resemble his nest a little more, he answered, “no.”
– he couldn’t just go to a different Alpha when his next heat would start. As Mrs Weasley had explained to him, Draco’s instincts had recognised Harry as his Alpha, as his owner. His body would need Harry when the next heat started. So he really didn’t have much of a choice in the matter anymore. Having a proper go at the courtship seemed like a farce, it would all lead to Harry binding him, owning him. He should’ve just bitten him when Draco was still in heat. It was a perfect excuse and Draco
It took the better part of two weeks to get everything surrounding the courtship settled, even with Harry pulling on all the strings he could.
Stealthily, he made his way up the stairs, sneaking to the floor where Harry slept. The light in his room was still on and Draco waited a few seconds, trying to determine if he still really wanted to do this and eventually deciding that
They entered the hardware store. The urge to place a protective hand on his stomach grew, and Draco fought it. He knew that muggles could not see his bump - it was obscured from sight by a glamour that Omegas naturally produced when pregnant, and only magical folks could see through that. Placing a hand on his stomach would just attract unwanted attention.
“If you got incarcerated I would not let anyone dissolve our bond,” Draco replied. “When Sirius comes to, you can bring him back to the Ministry. I would like it if you used your position to ensure his safety - en Remus’ - and get him transferred from Azkaban to a lighter prison, with better accommodations for conjugational visits. Like the Woodford Penitentiary.”
“Yeah. I haven’t been sleeping much,” Harry admitted. “I was worried for you. And the kids.” He placed the papers he’d been holding next to Draco. “Which one are we going to name what?” They’d discussed names a while back and had decided on two boy’s names and two girl’s names that they both liked.
Draco sniffed up the air a little bit, trying to determine if Ron was an Omega as well – which he thought was unlikely, because Omegas didn’t work – and decided Ron was probably a beta.
Harry closed an arm around Draco’s waist and yawned again. He opened his mouth as if to say something, but it only resulted in another yawn.
“Why are you always wearing a bracelet?” Victoria - she was so nosy sometimes, and Draco suspected she might be an Alpha - stepped up to Sirius and grabbed the chain that was strung between him and Remus. It only appeared outside of the house, and it was the reason why Sirius did not go out much. He felt uncomfortable with the visible reminder that he was a convict.
What made it even worse was that Adelaide had given birth to this adorable baby boy. Of course, Draco loved the little one, but it wasn’t his and more than before it made him long for a child that was his. His and Harry’s.
Harry stepped out of the kitchen floo, patting his overcoat to get rid of the soot. ‘Hi, Molly,’ he greeted Mrs Weasley in a careful, almost-cool manner. They didn’t hug either, Draco noted.
Healer Roberts nodded once and grabbed a piece of paper. “So far, have you been trying to conceive?”
Taking another sip of his tea, he considered her words. Female Omegas were fertile for a much longer period of time, and usually had heats until well in their thirties and sometimes forties, while their male counterparts usually only had heats until their late twenties.
‘I did hear something about Draco not living with his parents anymore,’ Miss Greengrass mentioned as she sat down again.
So now they stood on the edge of the Burrow’s wards, Harry holding both Draco and Adelaide tight, preparing for apparition. ‘Three… two… one…’
‘Are you done?’ Harry stepped back into the guest room. He’d left to grab clean clothes and dress in his own room. Draco pulled his shirt over his stomach. ‘Yes, let’s go eat something. I’m starving.’ He joined Harry and they walked downstairs together. Their fingers intertwined automatically and Draco suppressed a smile, looking away from Harry.
“Okay.” Draco appreciated the fact that Lupin used language that could not give away their situation. “I want yellow, I think.” He and Harry had decided against finding out the gender of their babies, so the nursery would have to be neutrally coloured. “It’s such a happy colour.”
Moving around usually helped against the fake-ass contractions. “Practising for real labour, my ass,” he said grimly, “I’m getting a c-section, for fuck’s sake.” With some more huffing and grumbling, he managed to get out of bed. He slid his feet into a pair of house slippers and started to make his way downstairs, stopping every time the stupid Braxton Hicks decided to rear its ugly head again.
Turning over on his back, he tried to relax his muscles and simultaneously kick off the sheets. He felt like he was burning up, every inch of his body burning and his blood boiling painfully in his veins.
She cleared her throat. ‘You were retrieved from your parents’ house by a Ministry rescue team after an anonymous letter was send to Harry, in which it was stated you were being abused severely and needed to be taken away from there as soon as possible. Harry obviously wanted to go and whisk you away immediately, but it took a day or two to find a team that was willing to help. You see, it wasn’t easy to break through the wards surrounding your house, and it was even harder to get through the ones that protected you. Next to that, they had to break the connection between you and your Alpha, so that he couldn’t just order you to come back. I had already agreed to take care of you, of course, but I hadn’t expected you to be in such a state, oh honey, I was so scared for you…’
Hermione got up and sat down next to Draco, carefully draping a supporting arm over his shoulders. “It might be. Maybe others that have been treated badly need a bit more attention, too. If you’d like, I could take a look at the case files and see if this is something others are experiencing, too. Would you like that?”
“That’s good.” Lupin cleared his throat. “I heard that nowadays, it’s nowhere near as risky as when I…”
‘Of course you are,’ Harry chuckled and he started rubbing the top of Draco’s hand with his thumb gently.
‘Sure, I’d like to have a sleepover at Grimmauld Place. Harry promised to show me what a television box is and we never got around doing that…’
‘I can’t agree more,’ a familiar voice spoke and Draco wriggled free of Mrs Weasley’s embrace to look at Harry.
‘If I could, I am very interested to see Draco’s records as well,’ Harry continued, as if he hadn’t just implied that Draco was pregnant, ‘I’ve noticed that he is quite studious and if his results here allow it, I would like allow him to study more.’
‘It’s okay… I’m right here…’ Harry soothed. ‘I’m going to let you go now, okay? You have to undress.’
In part, I understand that the ending of the previous chapter can be shocking to some, but at the same time I wondered: Why be so upset when earlier in the story I have described/ mentioned similar abuse. Is it
Hermione grabbed Draco by the arm again. ‘That’s our cue. Come on.’ She pulled him up, up, and Draco went through a reversed version of the journey into the pensieve.
“I know, I know.” He didn’t have the energy to start a discussion. He was tired pretty much all the time now. It was an expected side effect of the pregnancy - the male body wasn’t made for carrying a child and even though Omega’s could, it took its toll. Even with the potions he took to help sustain and strengthen the pregnancy, even with the vitamins and extra healthy food, it just wasn’t enough. “I think it’s just my instincts going haywire or something.”
Eyeing the green bottle, Draco decided that the potion would probably taste foul. Why else would it be in a green bottle? It was a bad omen, he was sure of it.
Harry quieted his words with another rough kiss, almost literally taking Draco’s breath away. Strong arms forced Draco to turn over, and he eagerly pressed his body against the now warm tiles of the shower wall, presenting himself for Harry the best he could.
“Being a house-husband suits you,” Draco lightly joked, using one of the words he’d learned from reading cheap, second-hand wizarding romance novels.
“Yes sweetie?” Draco sat up. Harry was already out for work. Sometimes Draco thought he was the only person in the entire French Ministry that actually worked.
‘Sure, Molly,’ Harry said, as if he wasn’t really worried about that. ‘Can Draco and I go now? I feel as though it’s perfect to go lie down in the garden for a while.’
Draco woke up with one hell of a hangover the next morning, and, finding that he was alone once more, took the floo to the Burrow. Arriving in the kitchen, he found Adelaide in a similar state. Molly seemed to be just fine, flurrying around like always.
‘She could live here,’ she bristled. ‘I told her time and time again how inappropriate it is to live with your ex but she… well she’s rather stubborn.’
The next time Draco woke, he was alone. Sleepily, he sat up. After a few minutes, he decided to get up and go look for Harry.
As Adelaide shuffled into the adjacent kitchen, she mentioned, “you seem out of it today. Everything okay?”
Mr Potter lifted him out the lukewarm water and Draco moaned. ‘Shh, it’s okay,’ Mr Potter whispered and he gently wrapped a towel around Draco’s body, drying him off. ‘Christ, you’re hot.’ Mr Potter touched Draco’s forehead as if taking his temperature, but his instinct had understood the words differently and he pushed his hips against Mr Potter’s, pleased to find that he was aroused as well.
Hermione looked at, smiling a careful smile and Harry beamed at him. ‘That’s okay, I could always just summon it.’
‘I would like to invite you for tea in my office, so we can talk about what exactly you wish to see.’ Miss Parkinson left no room for disagreement and led them all inside, to her light and airy office. Draco had only been in there twice: the first time had been when his parents enrolled him in Myrion and the second time was when it had been decided he had been old enough to leave Myrion again.
He read it thoroughly and highlighted whatever he thought was important to know, as well as making notes on things he wanted to ask more about.
He took a deep breath, taking the decision to finally talk about it in a split-second, and quietly said, “I don’t understand why it’s not… why we’re not…”
‘I’ll pay for it,’ Harry said. He turned his head a little to look at Adelaide, who was a few steps behind him and Draco. ‘You can pick some things out too, Adelaide. I can imagine you need a few new dresses.’
“Yeah…” Harry let go of his mate and dropped his bag on the floor, next to his chair. He sank down as well, and tucked into the food Draco had prepared, making no comment about the saltine crackers on Draco’s side of the table. “They’re making me the overseeing coordinator of cases.”
Draco remained quiet for a few more seconds, nursing his tea, before bouncing the ball back to Adelaide. “So how’s everything at the Burrow?”
“I’ll have dinner ready.” Draco pressed his lips against Harry’s whilst silently wrapping his arms around the Alpha, trapping him and keeping him close until Harry broke free from the embrace. “I really have to go now… I don’t want to be late. Last time I turned up late at the office Robards shouted at me for a whole fifteen minutes.” He pecked Draco on the cheek and rushed out the door, leaving Draco standing alone in the hallway.
“Getting the last request through took over a month,” Draco murmured, doubting he could be of any help. “There might not be enough time.”
Adelaide smiled a gentle, forgiving smile, as to send the message that she understood, that it was okay.
‘Agreed,’ Miss Greengrass said without batting an eye. ‘We have nothing to hide. Astoria is being treated perfectly well. It’s just terrible that some treat their Omegas so horribly.’
“Come on, you can go lie down.” He guided Draco into one of the labour rooms and helped him climb onto the bed.
Harry laughed and he sounded relieved, too. “I can’t believe it’s mostly a matter of a set of potions.”
“I’ll have to talk to Robards about it.” Harry placed a soft, gentle kiss on Draco’s temple. “Maybe we can find a mid-way solution.”
‘You’re perfect,’ Harry managed and he pushed his heels into the matrass to gain some leverage, and then flipped them over.
“Congratulations,” Andromeda said from her spot, smiling warmly at Draco and Harry. “And thank you for taking care of Remus so well.”
Draco tried to catch Astoria’s gaze to see how she responded to that statement, but Astoria steadfastly looked at her feet.
“Draco, are you sure about that?” Harry asked when Draco started to add garlands around the posters of their bed.
Harry cupped Draco’s face with his hand, letting his thumb stroke across the Omega’s face. “I do. From the day we met. And I met a lot of pretty Omegas back then. But you are the only one I want to come home to every day, the only one I could ever love.”
What do you think about Molly's response to Harry? Can Harry help Draco through his heat without knotting and/or bonding with him?? OHHH SO EXITED (even though it's my own story hahah)
When he carefully expressed his need for freedom, or at least leave the Burrow every once in a while, Harry had suggested that he, Draco and Adelaide could go shopping.
‘Yes, you wrote a complete report – about three visits. You’re supposed to fill out each category for each visit separately and make an independent report for each visit. Not cram them all into a very chaotic and senseless one,’ Hermione sighed, ‘I can’t believe you still work as an Auror when your report-making skill is this terrible.’
‘Hmmmww… bite me again…’ Draco murmured, feeling only a little embarrassed for asking Harry to bite him.
A soft, polite cough made him look up from the paper. His mother looked at the paper and shook her head ever so slightly. He folded the paper quickly and placed it back in the table.
‘You’re so clingy,’ Draco murmured, before answering, ‘I ahm – I asked Hermione if she knows if there are ways to induce a heat.’
I haven't quite decided on the ending yet, I've got two distinct options, and one requires me to write 1-2 more chapters, and the other one requires me to write 1 more chapter and/or an epilogue.
Draco thought about her question for a while and sipped from his tea in the meantime. “I think I may have been a bit restless before the last two... different than usual...” He hesitated about how to tell healer Roberts about the other things and looked at the floor. “I, uhh... during... I’m always... I mean I always need Harry to ahm... to knot me but... it’s been... really bad... last time.”
After three days he started to come back from the instinctive haze. He wondered where he was, who the red-haired lady that took care of him was, how he’d gotten here, but most of all, he wondered who his saviour had been. His memory was questionable at best and marred by things his instinct had told him. He wanted to ask about all these things, but the lady still pampered him and when she complimented him, touched him or came close enough, he forgot all about his questions.
‘No!’ he managed to say and he rolled over again, resolute to stay away from Harry as much as he could. The need slowly turned into pain, cramps in his stomach and he curled himself up in a ball, whimpering and whining from the pain and need. He had no idea how long it took, it could have been hours, or maybe just seconds.
Draco pushed his sheets back down again. In the dim light, he could see Adelaide looking at him inquisitively.
Molly pushed a cup of tea in his direction, looking at him encouragingly, so he continued, “healer Roberts warned us that any of the treatments, whichever we choose, can leave me irrational, clingy and with irregular heats so...”
‘Just let me know when you want to see me again, or if you want to talk, okay?’ Hermione requested and Draco nodded. ‘Of course.’
Hermione frowned. ‘Really… hmm… that’s… interesting… The Ministry encourages owners to bring their Omegas to mixed schools…’
Draco attached the bells to one of the posters and got down, stepping back a little to admire the result. “Well... Maybe... Fairy lights?”
“Be good for me now, don’t pull away,” Harry breathed in his ear, and Draco once more moaned his desire, but didn’t have to wait for much more longer. Strong hands gripped his hips, keeping him from moving, though Draco would not move even without that - he wanted to be good for his mate.
“That’s not it.” Draco bit his lower lip and admitted, “I just don’t want him to leave – ever. I feel like I need him near me all the time and when he gets home I just want to jump him and – I think about him all day and worry and – I’m just so clingy.”
After that, dinner was a quiet affair. His mother was still clearly fuming with anger, but that wasn’t was he was concerned about. His father kept looking at him in that way, the way he knew only came before severe punishment.
Draco attempted to settle back into the bed again, closing his eyes and filling his mind with images and memories that made him feel safe. In his mind’s eye, he filed through memories of his early relationship with Harry, the reunification with Adelaide, the joy he felt when he finally was pregnant, and the relief he’d felt when he had passed the twelve week mark.
Harry flicked on the lights without his wand and got out of bed. ‘I’ll be right there, I’ll just get a bath going.’
Untangled for only the shortest of moments, they stumbled out of the bathroom, Draco dropping himself into their nest and presenting himself an all-fours.
‘I remember that,’ Draco perked up, ‘some teachers were upset that they had to force their students to submit like that.’
“I know it’s been a while since we’ve had something to celebrate,” Molly began in a careful tone, “and I know not everyone may see this as a reason to celebrate, but…” She swallowed, as if she was afraid, although Draco couldn’t think of what for. “But all of you are important to Arthur and me, and we wanted to tell you that we have once again added a new member to our family.”
“So how’d you and Harry meet?” Lupin loaded his paint roller, beginning to paint. Draco watched him do it. It didn’t seem hard, but he’d never done it before, and he was fascinated by the mechanics of it all. “Um. So a few years ago, there was an upsurge in unusual Omega abuse. The ORO and DMLE started working together to visit all registered, unbonded Omegas preventatively.”
When he re-entered the kitchen, Harry cast another tempus. They both kept their eyes on it while it counted down. Three minutes had never seemed so long.
Draco glanced at Harry, waiting in a chair far enough away that he was sure he hadn’t heard. “Yes, thank you.”
‘Very well.’ He could hear his mother clearly now as well and quickly retreated to his safe window seat, trying to look as casual and elegant as he could, despite the fact he was positive there was a blush on his cheeks.
Harry sped forwards, grabbing onto Draco’s hips tight enough to bruise. He muttered a spell that made Draco’s trousers sink down to the floor and used his hands to spread his cheeks. Without much resistance, he pushed a finger in, making Draco gasp, “I already prepared, just fuck me, before Ron or Hermione gets home.”
he thought, but answered perfectly polite: ‘my life is wonderful, thank you for asking. My parents treat me very well. I love them dearly.’
Draco rolled over in the bed, rolling away from Harry and sitting up, thinking about the events of the last few months.
Hermione nodded knowingly. ‘Yes. So, I’ve written the proposals for the Wizengamot, would you like to read them?’
‘Aha. Well, I think that is all for now,’ Mr Potter told him politely. ‘I will see your mother now and ask permission for the other steps.’
“They turned me down because they thought I’d be biased. I’m sure they would do the same to you,” Harry said. “But you can try. Is there anyone else you could ask?”
Harry clenched his jaw and relaxed it again. “You talked about it with everyone! Molly, Hermione, Adelaide…! You bought these books – ”. He drew in a deep breath as if trying to calm himself, but it was too late. “You should have told me.”  The forceful tone of his voice made Draco step back even more, until he felt the cold wall against his back. “I’m not… ready…” he whispered.
“You were gone for 30 hours,” Harry informed him, although Draco was unsure why. Maybe he needed to say the words out loud to make them real, to make it real that Draco was back.
He let himself sink into his nest, breathing in the combined scent of him and Harry, and lavender and roses. As he rolled around, trying to find the right spot, he could feel Harry’s eyes on him, waiting at the edge of the nest for Draco to indicate he was allowed to join. When he was finally comfortable, he made eye contact with Harry and motioned for him to join.
Draco rose quickly, remembering his manners just in time and nodded. ‘Yes, mother, thank you.’ He stood still, because all guests were supposed to come to the Omega and greet them.
“Is it anything I can help with?” Draco then offered, expecting the answer to be a clear and resounding “no”.
There was shouting, people screaming, dead bodies on the floor. Draco could barely register it over the ringing in his own ears, now cowering behind his mate and regretting his choice to leave the room.
The sheets were soft and when Draco pressed his face into one of the pillows, it smelled pleasantly of lavender. “How did you say you knew about this place again?” he asked, turning over so his eyes could follow Harry around the room.
That was, until Harry’s knot started to swell and it caught on Draco’s rim every time Harry pulled out to thrust deeper, angling a little bit to make sure he hit that magical spot inside Draco every time.
Draco laughed. “You don’t know the half of it. I have no doubt Harry would slaughter his way through the masses if he thought I was in danger.”
“Come on baby, at least try to enjoy our downtime,” Harry said as he stepped closer. He caught Draco in one of his arms and gently pulled him close for a kiss.
‘FINALLY!’ Hermione shouted when they returned, but she didn’t sound angry. She sounded… excited. ‘What took you so long!?’
Draco couldn’t go back to sleep, and remained awake and in their bedroom until it was a reasonable time to go downstairs and make breakfast.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?! How about this Tom Riddle guy, huh? HARRY AND DRACO COMING CLOSE TO BONDING MAKES ME FEEL SO EXCITED (I feel so weird for getting hyped for my own story...)  Let me know what you think down below ^^
Harry bridged the gap between them, pressing his lips firmly against Draco’s and pulling him closer simultaneously. Draco moaned a little and eagerly pressed closer, gasping when his hips met Harry’s.
‘Draco?’ Harry stepped in the room. ‘Adelaide told me…’ He coughed awkwardly. ‘Anyway, I’m taking you to my room. Can you still walk?’
Someone commented about her even being listed as in the character list which was very smart! (You must be a Slytherin, hehe)
Draco whimpered because of how good it felt, how good it felt to be filled up, how good it was to come for his Alpha, the praise… ‘Harry…’
“They think he’s influencing me. Hurting me. Or using me to hurt others,” Lupin replied, his tone low, a rumble of frustration and tension.
“No.” He bent towards the shackles that held Draco’s ankles, murmuring a body stiffening spell to prevent him from kicking before ondoing the first shackle.
‘Yes. My house is big enough to accommodate more than one person. I live with her, Ron and Ginny, currently.’
“You’re not helping him.” Draco bared his throat for a split second, showing her his bond mark, hoping to placate her.
Draco purred at her and tried to move closer, wanted to be cuddled. She seemed to know exactly that that was what he wanted and moved over to him, putting her arms gently around him and cradling him softly. The rocking motion made him feel even sleepier and the snuggled closer, placing his head on her shoulder and sniffing up the warm Alpha-y scent. She chuckled and stroked his back with a gentle hand. ‘Such a good boy…’ she whispered to him.
At home, he’d never had the liberty of a nest. He could still hear his father’s voice echo in his mind:
“Have a nice day,” she added and then turned towards the next customer. Relieved, Draco made way to the exit. He could feel through the bond that Harry was near –
He just nodded. Desperation sneaked back into his heart. He looked away, pushing the unpleasant feeling away as much as he could.
‘I think I’m getting fat,’ Draco said as he slumped down on the couch next to Adelaide, holding a plate with cookies in one hand and a cup of tea in the other.
“Yeah,” Draco sighed before another thought sprung into his mind. “Hey I never asked, what were you called away for the night I went into labour?”
Draco looked at Harry, silently weighing his options. Did he really need Hermione present in order to voice his feelings?
‘Who was the official that visited you?’ It sounded urgent and Draco once more tried to open his eyes. ‘Who...?’
“Yes, you are,” Harry growled, and with one hand, he made Draco turn over, pressing him against the wall again. “Say it again.” His lips sought out their bond mark, teeth scraping over it, making Draco tremble and his head swim. “I’m yours, I’m yours,” he repeated. “Harry, please…”
‘I think they knew,’ Draco nodded, ‘but they weren’t concerned with that and didn’t have the time to pick other suitable things to read. When I still went to school it was the same for all the others there.’
When he was done, the room felt oddly empty, and he leaned against the wall next to the door, assessing the room. Maybe he’d paint the walls blue. Maybe he’d add a carpet. The posters of the ground bed could go. He didn’t want - or need - height in his nest. He needed easy access, and comfort.
“Morning,” she answered happily and she turned away a little so that his direct view wasn’t her chest anymore. “Let me get the kettle going.”
‘Ahm. I’m sorry. We’re not supposed to be, but then again, Draco and I go way back.’ Blaise sat down as well, placing Draco’s file on his desk. ‘I’ve been an assistant-teacher for all his time here and we spent quite some time together. I’ve only recently been promoted to this position.’
As Draco wasn’t allowed to speak unless spoken to, and his parents were unlikely to address him it was usually a quiet affair to him. Tonight, however, his mother started talking as soon as they sat down, fuming with anger.
“Thanks,” Draco answered, trying to sound like he was in less pain than he actually was. Harry kneeled next to the nest, uncorked one of the vials he’d brought and handed it to Draco, who drank it quickly, trying not to seem greedy. Almost immediately, a pleasant warmth started radiating from his core, reaching every sore spot in his body and relieving the pain within minutes. “Fuck, that stuff is good,” he said. Harry, seemingly more comfortable now, chuckled, “we did pay more than enough for their top notch quality stuff.”
“I don’t know?” His stomach calmed down a little more, which was a relief. “He hasn’t talked to his boss in person since Februari. It’s all been via owls. But I think… I mean… He can’t stay home forever.”
“Yeah, they’re putting in the paperwork soon.” Draco pressed his cold hands against Harry’s chest and stretched so that he could put his feet on the hot water bottle at the bottom of their bed. “And I… know we weren’t going to tell anyone yet but… I also told Adelaide that, uh, I’m pregnant. But I made her swear not to tell anyone!”
Harry settled in front of him, allowing Draco to crawl into his embrace. They were quiet for a little while. Draco considered taking a nap, and let his eyes fall closed. His breathing evened out, and a few minutes later, so did Harry’s.
Hermione got up, walking up to them, ‘I don’t think it’s a smart idea to go to Diagon Alley right now, with Draco…’ She let the end of the sentence open, but it was obvious to all of them: it would be rather unfortunate if Draco went into heat in the middle of London’s most popular wizarding high street.
Just as he was about to give up, Harry asked, slowly, ‘does the name Tom Riddle keep showing up in your files as well?’
‘Aren’t you a pretty one?’ she cooed at him again and she bend forward a bit to pet his cheek. He started purring without really wanting to.
The checkup at Sunny Spring went by in a blur, and when they stood outside again, he tried to reflect on the visit, but his brain only provided him with the comforting words Healer Roberts had spoken: “once pregnant, we can sustain and ensure the safety of Omega and child in about 90 percent of the cases.”
Draco followed Harry through the maze that was Greengrass manor. He didn’t look around much, having grown up in an estate that was much like this one. His parents were well associated with the Greengrasses and he’d come with them a few times when they visited. The Greengrasses had brought Astoria along a few times as well when they visited the manor, but it had been at least a year since he’d last seen Astoria. He’d never met her older sister, but knew she had one.
From time to time, Draco peered over to the couple to see if anything new happened, but it was mostly them cuddling, Harry rocking him and sometimes pushing his fingers back up Draco’s arse when Draco asked for it.
After making a selection of books that seemed worth his time, he decided to go over the informative section again, to make sure he hadn’t missed anything – he hoped to find something about male Omega pregnancies.
“I can only imagine,” Harry replied in a low, caring tone. “But they said it wouldn’t take anymore. They’d already put so many spells on you… there’s a limit.”
Mr Potter stared, clearly affected by this blatant display of Omega subjection. So Draco kept on smiling sweetly and tipped his head over to the side a bit, showing his vulnerable neck just a tiny bit. Mr Potter couldn’t look away, Draco was sure of it.
They stopped near the swings. Draco knelt down in front of her. ‘I’ll go talk to those boys, you just wait here, okay?’
Draco easily slid closer and basked in Harry’s body heat. “Yes…” It was an affirmative answer, but that was mostly because he had no idea what to say. He had always been a light sleeper, but sleeping when Harry was away – possibly getting
Harry gently combed through Draco’s hair with one hand and watched him sleep. ‘You’re such a stubborn idiot,’ Harry muttered. ‘Who would refuse help during heat? You would, you little idiot…’
Hermione placed her papers down on the kitchen table and accepted a cup of tea from Mrs Weasley before she addressed Draco. ‘Hello, Draco. It’s very nice to see you again.’ She spoke in a soft, but decided voice that made Draco feel safe and at ease.
. I don’t see how that can be dangerous.” In any normal situation, Draco would’ve wanted Harry to stay with him in the bookstore, but he needed Harry as far away as possible for the task at hand.
Draco looked away awkwardly. Through the bond he could feel that Harry had been paying attention and he dreaded the conversation they were most definitely going to have – Harry was gentle and patient when it came to difficult subjects, but also perseverant.
Harry wrapped his arms tightly around Draco, whispering, “you’re safe, you’re okay, I’m here, you’re safe…” He waited for Draco’s breathing to even out before carefully letting one of his hands pass over his mate. “Did they hurt you?”
‘Such a pleasure,’ Miss Greengrass said, bowing elegantly for Draco, ‘although I fear to have missed the bonding announcement in the Daily.’
He stood in front of Hermione’s desk and hesitated for a while, but eventually opened up one of her drawers and quickly found what he was looking for: a few hair ties and a scarf that smelled strongly of her. He lifted the scarf up to his nose and sniffed it, trying to decide if it was good enough. He really didn’t want to have to go to her directly to ask her for something else.
“I’m glad to see you’re happy.” Her voice was softer, had become a bit warmer, more like how she spoke to him when he still lived at home. “I... I should go. Merry Christmas, Mr Potter, Draco.”  She side-stepped around them and was gone before he realised, leaving him whispering “Merry Christmas, mother,” to an empty space.
‘I – my friend, Hermione Granger, lectured me before I started working for the ORO, and Molly did as well.’
Draco bent across the table, placing a hand on Lupin’s, squeezing it until the trembling stopped. Then he pulled back, slipping a finger behind one of the ribbon loops, and pulled it loose. The package came undone beautifully, the edges of silky paper unfolding itself to reveal a letter addressed to one Mr. Remus Lupin.
It wasn’t until he heard Hermione’s footsteps distance themselves from the bedroom door, that he could relax a little more.
“She’s in love with the idea of me. She doesn’t love me. Nobody does. Nobody can.” The last words were spoken through his teeth.
“Really,” Harry confirmed, and he closed the gap between them to kiss his mate. It was a sweet kiss, and Draco leaned into it almost desperately. He breathed Harry’s scent in, letting it fill his nose, allowing it to chase away all other senses, all of his insecurities and thoughts.
Harry sat down again, drew in a deep breath and turned towards Draco. ‘You want me to stay.’ It was a conclusion and Draco shyly nodded.
“He’s detained in a Ministry cell,” Harry said, delivering the information Remus so desperately wanted to know. He sounded tired. “The DMLE has agreed to negotiations.”
“I understand,” Mara said in a soft, friendly tone. “We usually recommend new parents to spread their visits a little, so that they can get used to the different stages of…”
It was not a good night. Draco tossed and turned, pulling the sheets over his body and kicking them back off again.
Draco snorted, ‘what is romantic about some idiot vampire becoming enthralled by a human, it’s so common. I like the werewolf guy way better.’
Draco had no idea what to say, so he leaned into Harry and wrapped his free arm around the Alpha’s waist. ‘That’s terrible,’ he whispered.
“It was Sirius’ intel that made us find the new hideout fairly soon - apparently every hideout needs to meet certain baseline demands, and they’re rather extravagant, so there’s a limited amount of places that can be used.”
“It’s not you,” Lupin murmured, a weak attempt at placating Tonks. “Omegas do well around other Omegas when it comes to physical and mental recovery.”
“Fuck,” Draco moaned fisting his own cock and coming as pushed himself down on Harry’s knot. “Ah, fuck, Harry…”
“I love you too.” Harry’s voice was low and rough, laden with emotion. He slowly unballed the fist he had made against the small of Draco’s back, now petting over the same spot with soft strokes. “I never knew I wanted a family this much,” he then murmured, his voice low.
‘Alright, that should to it.’ Hermione turned towards Draco. ‘Harry and I have agreed to the viewing of five key memories. I will join you when you view the first two, to give you an idea of how it works. The last three you will view alone, since they are of a more private nature. Next to that, the pensieve has been magically altered to allow us to watch all the memories in a third-person view. That should help you form an objective image of the events.’
“If I start to hope for anything we have more than now, I’m not sure if I could keep going.” Remus leaned forward, placing his elbows on his knees and blowing out a strained breath. “Maybe I should have let our bond be dissolved. I’m sure Tonks would have mated me.” The hopelessness in his tone was jarring.
“Thanks,” Draco said again as he put away all the vials. “I’m sure it’ll all be worth it in the end.”
Harry sneaked into the bedroom, making Draco turn over and sigh. “I’m still awake, Harry, you don’t have to be quiet.” Harry had been out in the field and, unexpectedly, had to work late. It had been too late for Draco to make arrangements to stay at the Burrow – Harry had send a message at around five in the afternoon.
He got up, turned to face Neville, ‘I guess I’ll see you again sometime,’ Neville said and he sounded bleak.
Harry wrapped an arm around Draco, letting his warm hand rest on the top of Draco’s bump, stroking it absentmindedly. “Hey,” he mumbled, sounding tired.
‘Oh my,’ the lady said and she smiled again, ‘well, good for you. When I was young we couldn’t be together out in the open like that, you know.’
Harry nodded. “I could feel your  uneasiness but I... I thought you would tell me when you were ready.”
They stumbled out of the fireplace and were immediately greeted by Bella. “Hello, please come with me, we’ve already prepared a room for you.” She ignored the second roar of the fireplace when Hermione came in, and led them through the yellow hallways. It wasn’t a far walk, but every now and then, Draco needed to stand still to breathe through the contractions. They remained relatively low in level, but were frequent, and ignited a cold, biting pain in his lower back, as well as increasing pelvic pressure.
Harry sighed, though he seemed genuinely amused, ‘guys, it’s just a film, it’s meant to be unreal. And romantic.’
Draco jerked his head to the side to see Mr Potter standing next to the bathtub. He blushed and wanted to curl up, disappear, felt embarrassed for being seen by him this way, but aroused at the same time.
“Of course,” Harry agreed, keeping silent about the tiring nature of his work. “Anything.” He helped Draco off the table and kept him close. Draco pressed in even closer to him, resisting the urge to press his cheek against Harry’s.
Draco moved a little bit and made a soft, needy noise when he felt how stimulating the motion was. ‘I…’
He opened the wardrobe. There wasn’t really any place for his clothes. Not that Harry owned very many clothes. The wardrobe was just too small. ‘Harry?’
Draco chuckled too, and gestured for Harry to come into the nest. “Come here, I’m cold without you.”
As soon as he realised this, the memory started to fade and he hurried to cooperate when he was being pulled out.
“No, when you had morning sickness you smelled sour all the time.” Harry let one of his hands settle in the small of Draco’s back, fingers feathering over the sensitive pressure point. It made Draco’s desire, just a low ember before, spark and ignite. He breathed in a sharp breath and pressed closer to his mate. “You know you don’t have to do that to make me want you,” he said, only halfway joking. He lifted his head, butting Harry’s out of the way and looked his mate in the eyes. It felt like Harry’s eyes could burn holes into his soul, and neither looked away for what felt like forever, and a fraction of a second at the same time. Then, Harry shifted to press his lips against Draco’s for a fiery open-mouthed kiss. His desire felt desperate and Draco responded with equal fire, pressing closer to Harry and tangling his fingers in Harry’s hair. He started to push Harry in the direction of the bathroom, pressing his hips against Harry’s to make him move.
Draco’s eyes closed again and he moaned willingly when Harry pushed a second finger in, and then a third. The bed creaked when Harry shifted into a different position and used his other hand to gently palm Draco’s cock. ‘Damn it, you’re so tight,’ the Alpha groaned.
Harry calmly responded, grabbing onto the Omega and pulling him close again, in a copy of the position he had used during Draco’s first heat.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay,” Draco said, trying to keep his tone low and soothing. He sent a glare up to the woman. “Step away from him.”
It was enough to distract the Alpha and she turned her head back to the table, murmuring a quiet apology.
He carefully moved his head a bit, to see who it was that talked to him, even though did it really matter? He was a good boy, she just told him so.
Draco looked away again, pulling his book out of his bag. He cleared his throat, tapping his fingers on his book.
He lifted his head of out his hands, showing Hermione the bite mark on his throat. ‘He bites me practically every night. He wants it just as much as I do. What is there to say?’
First, he took of all the bedding, and shook the duvet, eventually hanging it out the window so it could freshen up. He decided to wash all the blankets too, and picked out the things he’d borrowed from others. The apron Molly had donated didn’t smell like her anymore, anyway, and neither did the scarf and hair ties he’d nicked from Hermione. He put them aside with the plan to return all of the items to their rightful owners soon.
The baby store was overwhelming. First of all, it was massive, making Draco feel like he needed a map to navigate the space. Second of all, there were
Feeling that they were crossing into dangerous territory - they had hardly discussed Harry’s position at work at all, but Draco imagined that there would be an end to his extended leave at some point - Draco murmured, “I like having you at home with me. It makes me feel safe.”
Draco stirred his coffee and looked at the newspapers. Two of them were muggle newspapers, because they didn’t have the moving pictures. One was just a newspaper-y version of “Witch Weekly” which was approved Omega literature – well, some Alphas allowed their Omegas to read it because it was mostly wizarding gossip, and the other one was the Daily Prophet.
‘Urhg, you two are impossible,’ Hermione lamented, pointing at the two of them and then charming Harry’s report so that it flew back to his desk. ‘Redo this. The way you are supposed to do it.’
Draco sat nervously in the window bench, waiting for the Ministry officials to arrive. He’d seen then arrive at the manor, undoubtedly welcomed by his mother. It had been difficult to see from afar, but as far as he could tell, he had never seen any of the officials before.
Draco started crying, but kept on kneeling and baring his neck as much as he could. He needed the approval, the acceptance from his Alpha.
Draco nodded. “It does... But according to Healer Roberts, this is for the best... two weeks is the minimum time needed to recover properly from a heat and because I’m a bit older than is usual... If we want more than one kid we’re going to have to hurry.”
Following Healer Roberts’ instructions, they waited a full day before the last heat symptoms were gone, and then added 36 hours before taking a test.
‘Here, drink.’ Adelaide pushed a glass of water against his lips and he downed it quickly. It tasted fresh and minty. ‘What is that taste?’
Harry bent forward a little bit, pushed his nose against Draco’s neck and sniffed. ‘You don’t smell like heat anymore.’
,” Harry said in a low voice, and suddenly, Draco could use his mouth and legs again. He swallowed two large mouthfuls of air, feeling panicky tears stream down his face as he crawled towards Harry.
Harry closed his arms around Draco, and Draco leaned into it, allowing his mate to sneak in a hand between them. As always, Harry’s hands were warm against Draco’s cold skin, even through his shirt. He sighed. “I can’t believe it’s ten more weeks of this. I feel
Draco looked at her, noticing how conflicted she was about the situation. ‘I think my expectations were a little silly… It was far-fetched to believe that I would be the first for Harry.’
‘Hmmww?’ Draco answered sleepily and he pushed back a little at the body behind him, feeling that he was still tied together with the other man
‘I’ll go look around a bit more and talk to Augusta as well, so why don’t you stay with Neville for a while, Draco?’ Harry suggested.
‘I’ve transferred the case over to the Auror Office, with all the files and notes we had,’ Hermione spoke fast, but seemed to calm down a bit. ‘We’re not allowed to undertake any type of action, so…’
Draco felt a quick smile break through on his face when she did that. He was secretly a tiny, tiny bit in love with how Hermione always did that. It was so lovely and elegant and it fit her very well.
“I know.” Leaning into the strong Alpha, he tried to let his worries and fears go. Ever since the twins had been born, his frayed and frazzled instincts were always in overdrive, always hyper-sensitive. He hoped that it would get better soon, but had an inkling that he might always be overprotective of his two little treasures.
it read, in a pretty font. The sign was decorated with swirly vines, leaves and strawberries. ‘It looks pretty.’
I actually had the rough draft of this chapter done last night and I felt so guilty for not uploading it immediately, but I wanted to take another look at it with fresh eyes.
‘I am not,’ Harry confirmed. ‘Draco switched Alphas a few months ago and I’ve been granted permission to court him, despite the fact that he was originally promised to someone else.’
Draco shook his head. “No, not yet. We did talk about it for a bit... It’s just that the options that we have don’t really account for Harry’s job.”
Searching the files was boring and tedious work, Draco soon found out. He had to dig through a good few of them before he could find anything that resembled a pattern, and the idea was soon destroyed when he couldn’t find it anywhere else.
Again, it there are strange words/if I misused words or made grammar mistakes, do let me know, it only helps me become a better writer!
Harry, though he admitted he knew Lupin, would not volunteer any information about the Omega. When Draco grilled him, he’d answered, “he’ll tell you when he’s ready.”
‘Welcome!’ Mr Lovegood opened the door and invited them in. ‘The soup is in the kitchen, Luna’s serving it just now.’ He led them into the kitchen, where he pulled out a chair for Draco. Draco sat down on the rickety thing, not really trusting it to hold him.
‘You are oddly knowledgeable about Omegas and heats,’ Draco remarked and then was hit by a sudden realisation that made him jump away from Harry, ‘you don’t already have an Omega, do you?’
“Please,” Lupin repeated. It wasn’t an answer to the question. He kept his head low, avoiding eye-contact with both Harry and Tonks.
When he dressed himself, he noticed his normally flat stomach now was a bit rounded. He very gently stroked over the small bulge, wondering if, maybe…
weeks.” He placed a tentative hand on his stomach, shivering because his hand was cold, and because it felt like his skin was rippling away from his hand. It wasn’t exactly painful, but the sensation wasn’t pleasant either.
“I’m happy to hear that they did the job,” Draco answered with a smile. He had been having trouble sleeping himself, and had bought a weighted blanket to simulate the effect of Harry smothering him, moving the old blankets to the linen closet until Lupin asked for them.
‘Oh, no, my father’s a Beta,’ Luna explained. ‘My mother was an Alpha but she passed away a few years ago…’
Miss Parkinson opened the door, stepping inside, ‘Blaise, I have someone that would like to talk to you.’
‘That is all right. I will ask your mother for permission later. Let’s just talk a little bit for now, okay?’ Mr Potter smiled friendly at him. ‘When did you find out you were an Omega?’
‘Ron works at Weasleys Wizard Wheezes, in Diagon Alley,’ Hermione answered, clearly not bothered by Draco’s question.
‘I can’t believe that a bonding bite makes your heat so different…’ Harry mused, not responding to Draco’s wriggling.
“Did he deserve to go to Azkaban?” It felt bad, grilling Harry for answers, but Lupin wouldn’t talk, and Draco was just so curious. There was more to the story than either Harry or Lupin was telling him.
Harry came back up, and when he tried to kiss Draco, he turned his head away with a sated smile. “You know the rules. No kissing until you brush your teeth.”
One of the things Draco liked about her, was that she cared about both of their answers - she treated both him and Harry with respect. It was - once again - not the norm he’d grown up with. It was refreshing.
“Welcome to sunshine highlight,” Remus joked, but his tone was bitter. “The nicest room they have here. We must’ve gotten lucky.”
Harry sank down in his chair. Draco followed him with his eyes, when a stack of books with some leaflets on top on the coffee table caught his eye.
“Thanks.” Without looking, he took a bite and then laughed, surprised at the taste. “I thought they didn’t do mocha anymore.”
“Harry, Draco has lived in an abusive situation his entire life. You can’t expect him to know how to handle situations like this, at all. You should be careful with him, and not just assume he knows things. He’s never had an Alpha he could trust. Why would he trust you?” Hermione sounded calm and reasonable.
“Ice cream is always a good idea,” Harry easily countered. “Come on, it’s not even that busy there and my feet hurt.”
Lupin stepped forward, releasing Draco’s arm, presenting the binder to Hermione. “Inside you’ll find all the paperwork for my request to restart my conjugational visits with Sirius. I have attached a personal testimony, and it already contains the auror stamp you need to consider the request.”
Draco stopped moving, leaning back into Harry and sniffing up his wonderful, thick, warm Alpha scent. ‘You smell so good,’ he muttered, barely audible. It still felt awkward saying things like that, but Harry seemed to really like the compliments a lot and it was the truth anyway, so there was no reason not to say it.
The conversation - though not light in subject - kept Draco distracted as they walked. The weather was nice - unusually nice for London - and it wasn’t busy out.
‘It’s okay…’ Fingers brushed against his prostate again, making him whimper in need and move his hips back a little.
The shaggy man was hyperventilating on the kitchen floor. He’d curled up to be as small as possible, pulling in arms and legs, pressing his nose against his own wrist; a desperate attempt at self-placation. The position was a ghost of how Draco had survived his own panic attacks when he was still under his father’s thumb.
“We cannot wait for his arrival.” Her voice was low and understanding, but also strict. “We’ll make sure he can enter the room should he arrive in time or during the procedure. Okay?”
Today, when he reached into his bag for his noise-cancelling headphones, Sirius cleared his throat. Draco halted the action, turning towards Remus and Sirius. Like always, they were on the ground, close to the fireplace, with Sirius’ hands and ankles chained to a pole anchored in the ground next to the fireplace. He noted Remus, eyes glazed over, still not used to the touch of his mate. It made Draco wonder how long they had been living like this - Harry had mentioned that Sirius went to Azkaban when he was just a child.
“Stay close to me okay?” Draco murmured as he pulled on his coat, readying himself to enter the winter cold with Harry.
‘Well now he just has to,’ Adelaide decided as she and Draco stepped into the kitchen to show their new things to Mr and Mrs Weasley.
“How was your day?” Harry asked as he wrapped an arm around his mate, pulling him close. It was late, and they should be sleeping. Draco couldn’t - he had heartburn and the moment he relaxed, it came back again -  and he wasn’t sure if he somehow had kept Harry awake.
‘We’ve got enough evidence to let the Aurors confiscate the files,’ Hermione decided. ‘We don’t have the authorisation to do that, but they do.’ She seemed to be a bit disappointed when she added, ‘if we’ve come across a real criminal we might have transfer the case over to the Auror office.’
“Are you kidding, of course I’m happy!” Harry bent towards Draco to kiss him, before pulling him out of his chair and on top of himself. Draco let it happen without protest, still smiling when he settled into Harry’s lap. “I wonder what it’ll be this time.”
Hermione swiped her hair out of her face and tapped her lower lip with her index finger, looking pensive. “It’s not unheard of for Omegas to need a lot of personal attention from their Alpha,” she eventually said, though it didn’t sound confident.
Mrs Weasley said nothing for a while, but then moved closer, placing a hand on his shoulder and squeezing gently. ‘That’s nothing to be ashamed of, honey. I’ll gladly answer all the questions you have.’
Draco hesitated - he’d rather keep the kids with him - but eventually reluctantly agreed. “Okay. After that, we should go home again.”
‘I talked to Harry about what you told me,’ Hermione began, startling Draco out of his thoughts, ‘and he told me he remembered that things had gone a bit differently. To verify what he told me, I asked him if I could view his memories.’
“No need.” The kitchen door opened, and the woman - Tonks - came in first, with Harry right behind her. It took Draco a few seconds to understand that Harry had twisted one of Tonks’ arms on her back and was keeping unpleasant pressure on it, if Tonks’ scowl was anything to go by.
Draco tried to look away, but Harry held him in a firm grip, so he conceded. ‘I asked if she knows of ways to induce a heat.’ He could feel Harry tense up and added, quickly, ‘I can’t wait anymore, this is sheer torture, I feel like we’re just sitting around, waiting and I hate it. It makes me feel sick and awful and every time I feel even slightly aroused I get my hopes up and – ’
“Draco…” Harry managed for a response as he came, and then, “fuck, I love you,” making Draco laugh, “I love you too, Harry.”
Harry led Draco outside and into Diagon Alley, where it was even busier. He offered Draco his arm as guidance, which Draco happily accepted.
“No.” Draco placed a careful hand on his stomach, slowly rubbing over it in an attempt to mitigate the growing, unending, but low-level pain. He felt the eyes of the others in the room on him and made a frustrated noise. “Don’t look at me like that.”
Draco’s desire spiked and he let out a quiet moan, pressing against his mate tightly and answering his kiss with equal fire of his own. Harry tasted wonderful - Draco could nearly taste his desire and it made his knees buckle. His mate’s response was instantaneous, snaking an arm around Draco and pressing him tighter against the wall. Already desperate and wanting, Draco pressed his hips against Harry’s, rocking, trying to get friction. The water prevented that, though, and all he got was the smooth feel from skin on skin.
Here's chapter 6! (Finally) I know that currently I'm uploading a chapter every 3-4 months on average right now and I do feel a little guilty about that, but with uni and the fact that I have to study 40-50 hours a week, this is the most I can produce.
‘Are you sure it’s not just because I…’ Harry stared at the bite mark at Draco’s throat, nodding at it a little.
O my god I can't believe I almost lost this chapter. I couldn't find it in my files so I panicked like HOLY SHIT NO WHERE IS MY CHAPTER I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I WROTE AND I HAVE TO UPLOAD TODAY NOW WHAT?
Draco buried his face in Harry’s neck and drew in a deep breath. ‘Then don’t. Stay at home, with me.’
Quick note for everyone that commented when I said "I'm torn between two endings", I ended up merging them. This chapter encompasses one of the ideas that I had, and the epilogue is centered around the other idea that I had floating around in my head
Draco stood with behind the low fence that separated the day-care part of Myrion from the school, watching as Adelaide sat down next to two other Omegas. She started chatting with them. Draco couldn’t hear what they were talking about, but Adelaide seemed to be at ease and that was what was most important.
He threw himself down on the couch next to Adelaide grumbling and muttering under his breath, ‘stupid… hmpff…’
‘Shall we proceed?’ Miss Parkinson did not wait for an answer as she led them towards another part of the school, inside a building and knocked on a classroom door.
‘Of course you know, you just don’t want to talk about it,’ Mrs Weasley said matter-of-factly. ‘And I don’t have time to guess what it is, so you’ll just have to tell me if you want help.’
himself. He smelled like vomit, urine and embarrassment. Well maybe not the last thing, because due to the suppressants he was on, all the usual Omega qualities were absent in him. He couldn’t scent the air and taste the emotions, like his fellow Omegas could.
(although, writing smut it so hard! When I re-read what I've written I always wonder: is this hot? I don't know... But anyway, I've yet to receive complaints, so it's probably okay. At least, that's what I tell myself.)
He pulled up the blankets and hid himself in them, waiting until the lady would come to wake him up.
‘Uhm. Hello,’ Draco said, feeling out of place. Luckily, Harry stepped in behind him and wrapped his arms around Draco. ‘Hi there, I’ve spoken Lydia about an appointment?’
Strong arms lifted him out of his bed, with blankets and all. It didn’t hurt all, not like it had hurt the other times he was lifted out of his bed. He was pushed against a warm, broad, flat chest and snuggled closer, feeling safe.
‘To Mr Potter?’ She looked up now, not quite looking him in the eye but at least he could see more of her face now. She was much paler than he remembered.
Guessing it had been more than a few hours since he had been taken, he now assumed it was unlikely they were going to rape him - although the possibility that they were keeping him for someone also existed, and it was an unpleasant thought.
“He should’ve let their bond dissolve years ago.” Harry’s tone was low, but the fight, the aggression, had left his voice.
I really wanted to put something in with Draco and kids, because, let's face it, Draco really wants to have kids.
Harry was hurt. Harry’s emotions were so strong that they clouded his mind, making it hard for Draco to grasp his own feelings. Trying to block Harry out, Draco looked away.
He felt so safe and happy. An Alpha cared about him. He didn’t know how he came to the knowledge that she was an Alpha, but she definitely was one. One that cared about him. One that didn’t think he was scum of the earth. She thought he was pretty. Well, he knew he was pretty, but hearing it from an Alpha…
‘Yes, yes, yes, yes,’ Draco moaned and he pushed back against Harry’s fingers, finally feeling somewhat filled.
“We’ve been hosting another Omega for a few weeks now,” Draco answered the question Healer Roberts hadn’t asked yet. “I kind of like the company. It is more of an adjustment for Harry than for me.”
Draco opened the doors and inspected the amount of space. ‘I think that’ll do. Neither of us own a lot of clothes anyway. How much is… a hundred and forty pounds in galleons?’
He could feel something blunt pushing against his entrance and made a happy, needy noise. Harry now moaned a little as well and started pushing in. ‘Ugh, Draco, you’re so tight, damn it.’
“Sure.” Remus got up and took the stroller. Draco followed him with his eyes the entire time, losing attention for his immediate surroundings.
“Oh, when your next heat comes around, I’m sure we’ll be able to nudge your instincts in the right direction.” The stranger’s tone was airy, as if he did not care either way.
‘But I’m comfortable like this,’ Draco complained. He lay on his stomach on the bed, Harry on his side next to him. About half an hour ago, when Harry’s knot had diminished enough and they were finally able to untangle themselves, Draco had turned over on his stomach. Harry had thought it was funny and Draco knew that the odds of Harry knowing why Draco had done this – to keep as much of Harry inside of him for as long as he could – were against him.
He opened his eyes and could not keep the smile away from his face. Miss Fawley – no, Queen Violet of Blankfortia –  laughed her warm, sweet laugh. She had created a gigantic castle room within the blanket fort. He knew it was probably an illusion, because she had once explained to him that creating wizarding space was difficult and time-consuming, but it was still an amazing illusion. There were windows in their castle room and when he looked through them, he knew he’d see the massive grounds that surrounded Castle Blankfort.
‘I’m sure,’ Draco interrupted, not wanting to be rude, but he was so certain about it that he didn’t want to hear her objections. ‘I’ve given it a lot of thought and I… I love Harry.’
Harry turned to face the office, ‘is it okay if Draco and I go out to buy an extra wardrobe? We’re not really doing anything right now anyway.’
She crossed her arms, tensing the muscles in her jaw as if preparing to say ‘no’, when Draco made eye contact with her. He raised his eyebrows in challenge and added, “it’s Harry. I’m sure you know him.” If Harry’s behaviour before had been anything to go by, they knew each other.
‘Ah. I’m sorry, I should have told you side-along apparition is rather uncomfortable,’ Harry apologised and he eyed Adelaide, who looked a bit greenish, Draco observed.
‘We’re viewing the fight you two had and the moments leading up to that,’ Hermione announced, just as memory-Harry knocked on the office door and memory-Hermione opened it. Having been present for this part of the memory, Draco paid little attention and looked around a bit more.
‘I know, I know, it’s okay, I’m here, you’re safe here,’ Mrs Weasley comforted him and rocked him softly until the panic left his body. She kept on holding tight thought, and after a while, said, ‘did you want to report this to the ORO? They can help you decide if Harry has… abused you… and if… if any other things need to be done.’
Draco shrugged, feeling nervous butterflies flutter in his stomach - well, it was that or the morning sickness. “I don’t know. Maybe I used the wrong words. I’m okay when you leave the house.”
Entering Crossroads, Draco felt at home instantly. He had only been to the bookstore a few times now, but was glad Molly had introduced him to it.
Four hours later, the couple was laden with gifts and they were struggling to push through the shopping masses on Diagon Alley.
Draco nodded. ‘Okay…’ He hesitated for a moment, but asked, ‘shouldn’t I tell Mrs Weasley that you are here and what we are going to do?’ It seemed the polite thing to do. He had expected her to be in the kitchen because that was where she could usually be found, but this time…
‘I’m bringing him to a safe house.’ His saviour pressed his nose against Draco’s hair, sniffing it a little bit. ‘Don’t worry, I’ll bring you somewhere safe, okay?’
In the kitchen, he leaned against the countertop, while Hermione instructed Harry to sit. She placed her suitcase on the table and opened it. Inside stood a pensieve. Draco had seen them before, so he knew what they were, but why Hermione had brought one was a mystery to him.
comfortable like this, with Harry close. Come to think of it, it was really calming to have his Alpha this close. It made him feel drowsy… sleepy…
“I see,” Draco nodded. “Have you found anything relevant yet?” This confirmed what he had been thinking for a while now: Lupin was looking for a way to get back to his mate.
‘Well I have some news and I couldn’t just send you a patronus because, well, people would notice. Riddles file came through!’
Draco moaned a little, lazily participating in the cuddling, overly sensitive due to Harry’s ministrations.
‘Now there’s a good boy.’ Harry crawled onto the bed, hands sliding over Draco’s legs. The Alpha moaned. It sounded hungry to Draco and he shuddered.
Draco did as Hermione had suggested and walked to the house, but making sure he did not come close to either Alpha as he walked past them.
She seemed surprised momentarily, but recovered quickly. ‘Or course you can, I could owl him for you.’
Victoria and Elizabeth were asleep in the nursery. Remus was keeping an eye on them. And yet, Draco felt an incessant pull towards his babies. It took effort to ignore his panicky instincts.
Adelaide retreated to the guest room shortly after dinner, leaving him alone with Harry and Hermione. He sat in a kitchen chair while Hermione spread out pieces of parchment on the table. Draco tried to decipher what they were about, but he wasn’t that great at reading upside down, so couldn’t get much out of it. Harry though, sat on the right side of the table and hummed a few times, looked at them.
‘That was beyond inappropriate,’ Miss Parkinson said gravely. ‘You cannot treat old students that way, no matter how fond you are of them.’
It's a bit short, but I really tried! At first it was really crammed because I tried to put in so much information, but then I realised that that wasn't necessary because I'd be writing a series, so maybe an epilogue didn't really make sense?
Draco looked away from Mr Potter, to his mother, as if asking for permission. She nodded at him. He awkwardly picked up the hem of his long tunic and pulled it over his head. Beneath that he wore an undershirt, which he also took of carefully. Without looking at Mr Potter or his mother, he then fumbled with the complicated closure of his trousers. Mr Potter coughed again and Draco hastily pushed his trousers down. He didn’t wear any shoes, but did wear a pair if dainty white lace socks. It was a silly thing, really, wearing these girly socks when he didn’t want to dress like one, but when Miss Fawley had offered them to him he hadn’t been able to resist.
“I gathered as much,” Draco said drily, and Sirius barked out a wolfish laugh. “I like him, Rem. He’s sharp.”
Hermione blinked a few times. ‘That’s true.’ She pushed her chair back, studying Draco intently, making him feel uncomfortable. ‘So you could only read whatever was on the list?’
So they went about their day, taking the girls to the beach to play in the sand and by the water. Remus and Sirius were there too, and Remus shot Draco a meaningful look, making Draco press a finger to his own lips, gesturing for him to keep silent.
‘We should eat something.’ Harry broke the silence, standing up and moving towards the office door. ‘Are you coming?’ he asked when Draco remained sitting on the couch.
Miss Fawley carefully set down on the edge of his bed now and helped him pull op the covers. When he was completely hidden from sight, she started rubbing his back through the blankets. After a little while, he could hear her breathing in deeply, as if she was mustering up the courage to say anything. He tensed.
He was hot, tired and hungry. There was no way he could sleep though. He had managed to keep his instincts reasonably calm, telling himself over and over again that his children were safe and that he would suffer through whatever this was, and get back to them. But he would not permit himself to relax enough to sleep. This was how Stockholm syndrome started.
“Imagine the headlines: ‘pregnant runaway Omega’. Imagine the scandal!” Draco laughed. “I would not put you - or myself, for that matter - through such embarrassment.”
“Did you know about the situation when it happened?” Draco didn’t comment on the fact that Harry had now revealed the name of Lupin’s mate. The heartburn started to sink down, still painful but not so high it burned his throat anymore.
“Fuck me, bite me, make me yours.” Draco pressed back against Harry, shivering as he felt the hardness of his cock.
“A little disappointed,” Harry admitted, while Draco at the same time muttered, “really fucking sore.”
It felt amazing. Draco was stretched incredibly wide, almost painfully so and felt Harry’s hot come stream inside and he never, ever, ever wanted it to end. He moaned a little, ‘Harry…’
“Okay…” He walked up to Harry and kissed him quickly, only to be trapped in the Alpha’s arms when he wanted to pull back. “Harry…?” he asked, hesitant. Harry liked to cuddle, sure, but this was not… the usual thing. The uneasy feeling Draco could feel through the bond became stronger and he made a soft noise.
been rude. She was his only real friend, his only equal and to fight over something stupid was just… stupid.
Mr Potter didn’t seem to notice. He hugged Mrs Weasley, whispering something to her. She smiled and gestured at Draco, after which Mr Potter walked up to him and bowed. Another whiff of scent. ‘It’s a pleasure to see you in such good health, Draco,’ Mr Potter said when he stood upright again.
“Yeah. But it wasn’t really me alone. It was a team effort. I was distracted anyway.” It sounded like Harry didn’t want to talk about it, and Draco tried to let it go, but couldn’t help asking one more question: “where are they holding him?”
The television box – or TV, as Hermione had called it – was a weird little thing that apparently ran on something called electricity – something that came out of the wall and was connected to the box itself through a black lifeless snake. There also was something with a power box or however they’d called it, but this was complicated enough.
‘Hmm… You’ve been so good…’ Harry muttered as his lips gently went over Draco’s throat, biting every now and then.
“Oh. Okay.” Draco dropped the subject and placed Victoria back in her crib where she promptly fell asleep again. Bending over was still kind of painful, and he leaned into his back when he had let her go. Soon, he felt Harry’s warm, supportive hand settle over the sore spot, rubbing slow circles.
Draco slipped into Harry’s embrace and pecked him on the cheek. ‘Hi.’ He could feel Harry’s arms slowly wrapping around him and closed his eyes, expecting a kiss. ‘Where were you?’ Harry asked and he pressed his lips against Draco’s for a brief moment, ‘I couldn’t find you.’
Two breaths passed between Remus and his mate, and Draco looked away, allowing for a moment of privacy between the two. He could hear them whispering, and pressed his hands over his ears. This moment was for Remus and his mate. He would intrude as little as possible.
Draco rolled onto his back, making himself comfortable on the blanket Harry had placed down. ‘I don’t know.’
Draco mused over their morning rituals for a bit longer whilst making breakfast and was so lost in thought he never heard Harry enter, only sensing his mate when arms sneaked around his waist and Harry pressed his nose against Draco’s neck, breathing in deeply, scenting him. The intimate process of being scented by his mate still made Draco go weak, and he leaned more against Harry, knowing he could handle his weight.
“Hey, hey, take it easy.” Harry was immediately close to him, placing a gentle hand on Draco’s forearm to prevent him from sitting up. “They cut you open less than 24 hours ago. Try not to strain yourself.” The concern in his voice was touching, and Draco felt tears -
The painkillers helped, sure, but they did not alleviate the weariness in Draco’s bones, and so he stayed in bed for over a day after his heat had ended, only coming out when Harry insisted it was time to clean the sheets.
to Harry, but it hadn’t been necessary at all, as Harry started shaking his head as soon as Robards proposed the idea.
“I guess it’s good we have nine months to get used to the idea of a child,” he then half-laughed. “We should… I don’t know, make a list… lists… of things we need to buy, to do, and-”
Draco moved a little bit, so that he could peer over the edge of his duvet. ‘You are the queen of blanket forts.’
‘I expect you two back within the hour,’ Adelaide pointed at them bossily, ‘and I want a detailed report of the house from you, so no fumbling and finding a secure bedroom for the two of you.’
‘Yes,’ Draco confirmed, ‘but they only issue a new list once every two-to-three years so at some point you’ve read all the books and outgrown the magazines so…’
‘I didn’t know they’d been together,’ Draco carefully explained, trying to dodge the bullet, trying not to make Mrs Weasley angry at him.
It was a full house at the Borrow. All the kids were there, and a couple Draco didn’t recognize. The man had shaggy, brown hair, and a scar on his upper lip. He was skinny, and his suit - or at least, Draco assumed the outfit was supposed to be a suit - hung loosely around his too-large frame. A woman flanked him, as if they were attached at the hip. She wore black jeans and sneakers, and a brightly coloured rainbow sweater. Her eyes sparkled with excitement. It was obvious that she was the extraverted of the two.
Draco felt bold for just a moment and said, ‘I think I should meet her some time, if she has all these great ideas.’
“I’ve asked Kreacher to do it a few times, but like I said, he’s a lousy house elf,” Harry said with an amused smile. “Still sure you want to decorate the house?”
“Let’s take home a pint, when we’re done,”  Draco suggested carefully, though he knew Harry would not refuse him something he delighted in so much - especially not now.
He failed miserably. Every time he went over a sensitive spot he moaned a little and when he dried his arse – or attempted to – slick gushed out. He whimpered, the need to be filled by his Alpha – who stood
‘What kind of job does Ron do?’ Draco asked carefully. Harry had told him he could ask questions is he wanted to, but it was not polite, not the way Draco was trained so whenever he had to ask someone else a question, he was careful.
‘Fuck, Draco…’ Harry slid his hand lower and quickly pushed a finger in, making his Omega whimper and beg, ‘more, please…’
Healer Roberts laughed. “Understandable on both accounts.” She waited a beat, and then continued, “it’s really fairly normal to not conceive on the first heat, it only happens in about 24% of all cases, so please don’t feel discouraged because of that.”
“If you want to… I could help. It’s been a while since I left the house.” Lupin’s voice was unsteady.
A red-haired man walked into the kitchen. He was taller than Draco, that was for sure, and a bit… well Draco would usually say fat, but really, he wasn’t fat. Maybe a bit on the overweight side, but not actually fat. He smiled at Draco. ‘Hello there, I am Arthur Weasley.’
A quick glance at the clock told Draco that Harry persisted in going that for over three hours, before his memory-self broke free, crying in need.
Another leaflet was from St Mungo’s and provided general information about male Omega pregnancies. Interested, Draco flipped through it, thus finding out that it was indeed true that the bodies of male Omegas were not built for the (female) task of pregnancy. Depending on the type of bond the Alpha and Omega had, and the strength of the Omega’s magical core, the Omega’s body would not adept at all, in part, or completely to the pregnancy.
long to upload this chapter! I moved to a new apartment some two weeks ago and started studying at the university and my schedule as well as the subjects I take are rather demanding. And when I FINALLY was done writing this chapter, my beta ran out of time! I know, I know, terrible excuses...
(Also, tell me what you think of characters that are non-existent in the books, like Miss Fawley and Adelaide! Are they fun/good or do you think I should try to stick to the original characters for the most part?)
She smiled at him and handed him the Prophet. He took it from her, trying not to let his hands tremble. It had been at least four months ago, the last time he had been allowed to read the newspaper.
“Y-yeah.” Lupin’s eyes flitted nervously around the kitchen, trying to find the Alpha that had come in with him.
Draco shook his head. “No... We don’t have enough things yet and... I just want to be prepared for when... I know we haven’t decided anything yet on what to do and...”
“No. I would’ve offered him shelter if I had known.” Harry sighed, and added, “they kept me out of it on purpose. They knew I would have protested if I had been made aware of their actions.”
‘Yes.’ He drew in a deep breath, ‘I’ve never been treated this well in my life. My new Alpha is great.’
Mr Potter scribbled something down again. ‘I understand. And how is your life? Are you treated well?’
Harry, too, seemed to consider this option. “I’m not sure. I don’t - I didn’t like seeing you in pain after it all, and I felt like it’s been, a little too much for both of us but, I also don’t want to be wasting time when I know we don’t have much to begin with. And I feel like I - we - might lose courage if we don’t push through.”
Alright, another chapter. I found this particularly hard to write, mainly due to the fact that some people had a rather negative reaction to the last chapter. It most definitely affected me in a way that made me question myself. At first, I wanted to respond to them, but I eventually decided that everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Next to that, no-one said horrible things. It was a polite stating of their dislike of what I wrote.
“I know, take your time.”  Harry rubbed his warm hand over Draco’s back, helping the Omega relax and sort his thoughts out. “It’s just that... I know I’ll be nesting if... when we start all of this and I really want to be prepared for when it happens. I’m still conscious of what I’m doing now and... I might not be when I start taking those potions.” It all came out in one breath and Draco was panting a little when he’d thrown it all out.
“You can also turn them off,” Mara said from a few feet away. She had learned that coming too close made Draco nervous, and did her utmost best to not trigger his over-active instincts. “Just a tap on the bottom should do it. It makes sure that they don’t go off during nap time.”
‘Mr Potter is washing his hands and the sheets, I think. He told me to make sure you eat and drink before he comes back.’
Just as he was about to say something, inquire further, Molly and Harry came back in. Harry immediately stepped towards Draco, bending towards him and rubbing his cheek against Draco’s in a quick, but loving gesture. Draco could barely suppress a satisfied purr.
Well, there we have it. As promised, no detailed report of what went on during Draco's heat. In the next chapter, however, we will view Harry's memories. So as a little warning to those who think what I wrote is disputable, in the next chapter there will be some more of that (although as stated, no full-on noncon/rape).
Harry kept Tonks close and let his gaze slide over Lupin. A distinct feeling of pity and sadness came through the bond, and Draco reassessed Lupin. Maybe it wasn’t the connection between Harry and Lupin that had been the reason why Harry had avoided the couple all night.
Draco thought the conversation was a bit difficult to follow, as his parents had the habit of not using his name when they talked about him.
‘With lots of sand!’ The boy dug his hands into the sand and moulded it into a flat, thin, crumbling cookie-shaped pancake.
Next up: fixing the relation between Draco and Harry, as well as a greater involvement for Draco in the abuse cases!
After she had left he placed his hands on his own stomach and couldn’t help but finding it stupid it was so flat. He imagined what it would be like having his own soft curve there.
“I think it’s time for Alexander’s nap,” Adelaide announced and the awkward air that hung between Draco and Harry dispersed.
When he noticed his Alpha was back, he made a desperate noise and bared his neck again. Harry groaned and froze in place. ‘Damn it Draco. I can’t bite you.’
Harry’s boss was one of the entering aurors, and he stepped towards Harry and Draco immediately. “Take your mate home. I expect a report within 24 hours.”
With his free hand, Sirius patted Remus down for a pack of cigarettes and his lighter. Or maybe he patted Remus down so he could touch his mate. Draco didn’t know, nor did he care. He found himself intrigued by the couple. It was hard to look away from them. Was this what a mated couple looked down after two decades of being bonded? He could only hope that he and Harry would always remain that close.
Having quite some time left, he sat down in one of the many window seats that could be found in the store, and started flipping through his first pick: “Being an Omega”. It seemed to be targeted at newly presented Omegas, but then again, Draco had never had the luxury of access to these types of educational books.
“I could apply,” Draco murmured, feeling unsure about his offer. “Or we can ask… Molly, maybe. What about Hermione? She might not like you, but she has strong morals so…”
‘I’m not related to her by blood,’ Harry slowly considered, looking at Mrs Weasley, ‘but yes, family nonetheless. She actually lived at my house, currently.’
‘Alright, I think we should make some rules,’ Harry said suddenly. ‘If you don’t want to be victimised and I need to stop treating you like you’re so breakable, we need to make some rules.’
They stayed like that for a while, until, Hermione, ‘ahem, boys. We’ve got an investigation to wrap up. What are we going to do about Riddle?’
Breathing heavily, Harry drew back a little and pressed a hot kiss against the bite mark on Draco’s throat, biting at it lightly, ‘I know how you feel,’ he breathed, a hand stroking down and squeezing Draco’s arse a little.
‘Do you wish to file a complaint about me, for ordering you when I was not supposed to?’ Hermione asked in a professional matter.
Draco blinked. He had not expected that question. They were bonded mates, and legally speaking, there was no difference between wedded spouses and bonded mates. He’d grown up with the assumption marriage was for others… those who could not be mated like Alpha and Omega. Marriage was something he had never expected from life. “Do you
Harry coughed, making both the Omegas stop talking. ‘Not that I mind you reminiscing, but if one of you could open the gate?’
Draco did as instructed, watching Healer Roberts closely as she placed a flat, oval-shaped stone on his stomach. It was cold, and he tensed up a little. Healer Roberts was unbothered, conjuring her wand and murmuring a spell in a low tone. It made a blue-ish shimmer settle over Draco’s stomach, and with another spell, the stone projected up an image of their little baby. Harry’s fingers clenched around Draco’s.
A few days later, Draco found some leaflets wedged in between the pages of the novel he’d been reading. There was no note, nothing, just the leaflets.
“I see.” Asking questions didn’t feel like an option to Draco. He would take any information Lupin would offer him, though.
“I sometimes forget how sharp you are,” Draco chuckled. “We’re okay. We’re um, expecting twins, apparently.” It felt odd telling someone, even more so because it was Lupin. Lupin usually kept to himself, and so did Harry and Draco. It was a silent, mutual understanding. Only on rare occasions did they talk about anything personal.
