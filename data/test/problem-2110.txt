the lead.”
Harry’s heart leapt to his throat, but he froze in place and ignored the urge to run.
"You know what would be hilarious," Ron began, looking back and forth between Harry and the coffee pot with ever-increasing interest. "
“Yeah, well you seem in a good enough mood today, so, get out of my face with your cheer.”
Draco looked right at him, took a deep breath, and blurted, “Go out with me.”
As they approached the end of the day, and customers dwindled, Draco gave up on trying to sort out what he was feeling and started to pack up. Diego was up on a ladder, Potter was flitting about with closing procedure, and the day had a satisfying finished feeling to it. Despite his earlier emotional rattling, Draco felt accomplished and happy. He smiled up at his boyfriend when he noticed he was being watched.
“I— wait. Why?”
“We do have the key,” the man said quickly, leaning forward so the creature could see him. “Vault 1212.”
"I'll only send you home with a small amount this time, so we can see if it works on those nightmares," the doctor continued, heedless to Harry’s silence. “Rest. Rest is all you need, young man. Pure exhaustion, that's what's wrong with you; and who could blame you? Working hard as you have for so many years.”
He was almost finished the ale by the time he decided he needed to do something about this instead of just staring out the window melodramatically. He was, after all, a proud Gryffindor. He took hold of his courage and found the nicest piece of parchment he owned, writing as neatly as he could manage and wrote a letter. A letter he should have written months ago.
Harry had lifted his sleeve to wipe his forehead, lifted his glasses to his head to remove the grime from his eyes. When he put them back, Draco’s face was only an inch or so from his own. Quick as breathing, Draco’s mouth found his and kissed him firmly, a small breath releasing from both of them before he was gone.
contain his apron or his name tag or his antlers. She looked at him for a moment, cocked her head, and laughed a quick, adorable laugh.
“Look, it’s not my fault if you can’t appreciate a design conversation with a renowned...no, wait. We aren’t having this fight again. It's more important that I remind you of the false bottoms. Do you remember the false bottoms to drawers."
Harry, as though following his own demand, was staring at Draco and trying to see into his soul. In an instant, it all made sense; Draco’s body flooded with heated relief.
“I guess...how do you…is it hard to cut out a benefactor?”
"I don't drink anymore," Potter said quietly.
He looked at her, waiting for her to go on. Her face was scrunched up in that ‘I’ve been thinking too hard about this’ way. “There are ways I'm supposed to be feeling too. Maybe I should be yelling at you not to let him back into your life, to run in the other direction,” she continued. “But I’m not going to.”
September rolled by with Harry sat behind a desk. Suddenly, he and Draco had been together for two years. A
“Wait. A love potion?” Draco interrupted, deadpan.
Harry nodded again and stood up. “Thanks, Bill.”
“Sir—”
"So, the Docks, I think," she said, using her signature move of completely ignoring him and getting her way anyway. "They seem promising, all those old grain elevators and everything.”
“Yeah, yeah, yeah.” Ron waved him off. “Draco, etcetera etcetera. It’s a little hard to break almost a decade of calling you a slimy git, mate. Be patient.”
"Oh definitely," Harry laughed. "So, shall we?"
“Thought you weren’t coming?” Harry said softly.
, I hate both of you,” Pansy shouted. “It’s the fourteenth! The fucking Fourteenth of Fucking December. That's what day it is. Okay? Okay. Now. I am leaving, and you two are talking. Fuck.”
An hour later, sat at their table at the pub, it was taking everything in him not to rip the card into a million tiny pieces as he studied the tiny professional monogram stamped there. Pansy sat across from him with a large glass of house white that kept making her wince when she sipped.
“What?”
Draco took the next pair and chuckled, wagging a finger at her jokingly. "Fine, my magnanimous, raven-haired beauty," he teased. "But I'll remind you again, your compliments change nothing, darling."
"I'll give you a Galleon if you can convince him to go out with you by the end of the month."
“We’re having tea.”
. The attraction was almost certainly to that and Harry was not going to delude himself much longer.
“I wish you had never gone to that fucking affirmations workshop.”
“And then,” Hermione continued, ignoring him. “He found a box of that said he
“Er, right. Well. Yeah. Thanks,” he responded.
have told
"But that can't honestly be the first time we've ever… you know, touched."
“Sad?”
He was unobtainable, so that was check number one in Draco's column. He wasn't a pureblood, and he had, in theory, destroyed his father's little cult leader. So that was basically the entire list.
“Yes?”
Which is why Oscar was a surprise. The young man, just out of Hogwarts, had turned up at Luna's door, begging to be an assistant three days before the opening, despite the fact that Harry was pretty sure he had never mentioned to anyone except Hermione that he was looking. For some reason, though he was over-enthusiastic and underqualified, Harry hired him on the spot.
“You’re just rebounding from Diego.”
“You okay now?”
Draco’s brow furrowed. “Uh, you… okay, and everything?”
Harry was running around the kitchen, chasing a giggling Lily when he remembered. It was like a cold bucket of water being dumped all over him, and Lily stopped dead in the middle of the kitchen, a worried look on her face.
Harry was sunk.
, he thought.
"I don't mind. Despite all evidence to the contrary, I love this city."
,” Diego actually laughed. For a moment, he just stood there laughing at Draco. Just as Draco was starting to get annoyed, Diego sobered and cleared his throat. “You think he hasn’t told me you were still coming? If it bothered me, I’d have come to see you. Let’s not be that couple, seriously. It’s boring. Besides, I just came to say… you should really just ask him out, already.”
“He’s not supposed to be because of the whole honeymoon thing but he’s in the back. I’m not supposed to tell anyone that.”
“Cinnamon latte,” Potter shrugged, crouching down again, continuing with whatever he was doing with the large, glass-front display case.
But the silence that pushes us together is too fierce to break down
“Good. Do you need me to go get you a coffee or something before we start the open?”
Harry appeared in the kitchen, also pyjama-clad and wrapped in a wool blanket that was trailing on the floor. He sat at the empty seat to Draco’s left; Draco let the tension he’d been holding uncoil slightly. It seemed that the morning had brought back physical boundaries. As much as he wanted to pull Harry into his lap and keep him there forever, Ron be damned, something about the following of social cues on Harry’s part put Draco back at ease.
So here he stood, wincing and waiting for Potter to out him, or mock him, or worst of all, tell Diego who he really was.
“I tried so hard when I used to organise this to not let them do themed cocktails,” he said ruefully as Harry collected the highball glass, filled with beautiful layers of liqueur with a hibiscus flower adorning the bottom. “And here you are, proving all the vendors right.”
“I like
Draco is approaching comprehension when his back hits the lockers and his knees buckle and Harry's soap is in his mouth as he presses his face to Draco's neck.
“Father,” he said cooly, settling down across from him and smoothing out his hair.
“Harry, don’t. It’s too…”
“Hey!” Harry shouted, but started laughing too. “I resent that.”
“That, too, is a problem. I know
And, I think, we can all be grateful that this is the case. Draco Malfoy-Potter certainly is.
be dissuaded from waiting there until you arrived. While I admire the gusto, I fear I could not wait until your classes finished for the day.”
"But that would mean…"
Harry's smile was lovely. He hadn't seen it in so many months, not since before he'd broken anything. His breath caught in his throat and he felt like a very silly young teenager, falling for a crush. It was foolish and unfair. Harry may have started the conversation with the kiss the night before; he'd opened the door to reconciliation, but Draco wasn't stupid. He knew that he had many things to answer for, many apologies to make.
the arguments.
"Waffles can wait," Harry said simply.
you know? Like maybe he’s finally doing better? I...there’s so much time between here and there. Surely we could—”
Can you tell I've already completely mentally checked out from work right before break? Three posts in two days? Yup. I am doing no adulting right now...
of Potter's day.
“Any chance you can do breakfast tomorrow? I’m, er, staying the night.”
,” he insisted.
Harry took it automatically and opened it slowly. He smiled. “You should just put it back on. Oh, relax. God, your face,” he teased with a laugh. “I’m not suggesting we march down the aisle next week. But. Draco, I’m not sure there’s any point pretending I don’t still want to marry you. Oh sure, I don’t trust you right now. I’m hurt. I’m confused. And I sort of want to murder every person you’ve ever called ‘family’, but all of that changes nothing. I was ready to take you, for better or worse. This is worse.”
“Well…” she said, sounding affronted. “I’m
“No,” she said firmly. “You’re supposed to shag him before you marry your wife, then fall in love with him, realise that marrying Astoria is a terrible decision, and finally throw off this ridiculous sense of
’ a little harder for Diego to believe.
Malfoy’s mouth hung open for a moment. He looked down at the bench. He gulped.
Harry surprised himself by laughing; something about this man, obviously completely out of his element and thrown off by his day, soothed his nerves. He took in the small silver earring that was peeking out from the man’s cartilage, embraced the white t-shirt beneath a tight blazer, and enjoyed the bright teal of the man’s trousers.
this. The 'this' is me; it's not just my fault, it's who I
“Well…why are we here, Harry?”
“Why what?”
Simple. Direct. Threatening in a mysterious way that may or may not act as a deterrent. In other words, very Draco. He tore open the document and found a single sheet of paper inside.
“It isn’t?” Harry stuttered.
Harry lifted the cover and filled a plate before pausing. “Why?” he asked, puzzled.
Harry faced Bill with defiance and nodded. Bill sighed.
The box was one of those cheap photo storage boxes. Black, with a small brass window frame on the front for labelling the box. He lifted the lid.
, Malfoy,” he growled. “I have just as much right to be here as anyone else.”
balanced delicately in one hand.
Theo looked at her, shock in his features. He opened his mouth for a moment before wrapping her close and kissing her deeply.
Harry collapsed into his frame a little bit. “I’m not expecting anything, Gin. Don’t worry. I just want this last puzzle of his concluded. Then I can leave the house. Go back to...whatever my life is now. Move...forward.”
Her voice was desperate. His resolve inexplicably crumbled. “Yeah, fine. I have a gun in my sock.”
It didn’t matter that they had only written stupid, scrappy letters for a month and not figured out a damn thing in all that time.
"Ron, mate. I have been a supremely shit friend.”
“What?” Harry declared. “Why?”
The older women sitting behind the counter looked up briefly, annoyance flashing on her face as she sighed. “Look, love. Why you people don’t just floo is beyond me, but you well know you buy your ticket on the train, and you’re about four minutes from missing it. So if you really fancy the many hours of nostalgia, I suggest you run, dear.”
"I don't know that I've done much of anything, really,” Harry remarked. “Although, the Aurors are certainly seeing much more of you lately."
for you,” Harry whispered.
“You know why,” Harry replied sheepishly.
“Oh, shove it,
He sent it off before he could change his mind and three months later, when the England reserve team announced it’s new fall roster, he refused to let the little seed of satisfaction that wheedled its way into his stomach take root. He squashed it down heartily and never said another thing to anyone about that letter.
“Your concern is touching,” Draco scoffed. “But I assure you, I’m fine. I will be...fine. For a few months.”
“I just ran into him in Diagon and...well, okay, I sort of followed him, but the point is, he knows.”
“Neville,” Harry started. “Neville, it’s nothing. We can forget it ever happened.” Neville just stared at him, pleading in his eyes. Harry backtracked. “Or...or we can just check.”
There was nothing to be done for it; since that Saturday in the office, Harry had been completely distracted. He tried desperately to blame the fact that Ron was back and that he was still cleaning up the mess from the pixie incident, but he knew in his heart of hearts that his distraction had a much simpler cause.
“Didn’t you two used to be, I don’t know, friends or whatever? You must know the rumours that swirl about the place about you two,” Draco expounded, ignoring the tightness in Harry’s jaw and blazing forward, borrowing a line from the Gryffindor sensibility that he had begrudgingly admired for a long time. “I just thought we were at the point where...you can tell me this stuff, and everything. Surely, we’ve moved past the awkward half-truths stage.”
to go look for a job. He just didn’t want to. Every day was the same story; get up, hand out resumes, eat a chicken sandwich in a cafe, hand out more resumes, go home to make dinner. He had to find something soon, or he’d go insane.
The bravery fled him now. The stupid courage that held fast disappeared in the light of this tall blonde man and his shorter, squatter compatriot, who looked like he could break him into three separate pieces just with a fist.
Hermione’s eyes narrowed, taking stock of his story and seeming to try and line up all the evidence she had available to her.
“Go on,” Harry muttered, a hard tone in his voice that he hadn’t intended.
Harry argued with Hermione all the way down to London. For some reason, she had insisted they take the train. Which meant that it had taken five hours longer to get to Draco than it needed to. She’d insisted that he needed to get some more sleep, he’d insisted that there was no way he was going to be able to rest. Ginny had finally sent a
remember me,” she smiled, kicking off the wall she'd been lurking against and tugging her dress down.
"No, I would never suggest that. I don't want you doing this for anyone. I just want you to live again. Don't you want that?"
“And?”
“He’s just asleep,” Harry protested. “I don’t trust anyone right now. Are you seriously going to blame me for that?”
"Ron,” Harry warned. “Whatever you are about to suggest, it isn't happening. Even your eyebrows are untrustworthy right now."
“I—” But Draco gave up protesting. If he was honest with himself he knew three things.
Malfoy sighed dramatically. “Second-year theory papers,” he groaned. “They’re dreadful. I have no idea why I even set them. They’re unnecessary.”
day,” he declared, downing the rest of his beer in one long pull.
"Diego –”
Draco was flustered. “Did…did Ron call?”
Draco laughed harshly. “Dreams feel like the least of my worries.”
The ring box weighed down his pocket until finally, after pudding, they all started to trickle back to their homes. The years of the Burrow being able to hold them, house them, were long past. Hermione took the baby home, and Ron Apparated a short time later. Slowly, one at a time, the other families disappeared. Harry sat in the kitchen, helping with the washing up, and Draco took himself outside to stare up at the stars, unsure of if he should leave. He almost did.
“Sometimes. It’s adorable. Usually.” Harry looked very worried for a moment. “I’m pretty sure this isn’t going to be one of those times when it’s adorable.”
"Is this what it feels like to be right?"
“Happy Christmas, then,” he said in a strange, robotic tone. “See you next year.”
to be there, simply had to be. There was no way that with this much light, Draco’s Patronus form hadn’t revealed itself.
?" Ginny held her head in her hands, their mugs both empty, their chairs pushed out for comfort. They had been at this cafe for hours.
“Fuck,” he said. “I’m really off my game today. Joking, Draco. I was joking. Ugh, I haven’t had to tell anyone this in ages. I guess the beginning is true. I worked here right after I dropped out of Auror training–”
“Oh for fuck’s sake, you’re going to what, Potter? I’m standing here dying of utter anticipation.”
“I’m not sure you know what this means,” Draco frowned. “If you kiss me now, we can’t go back. Even to the hate.”
"I just don't understand," Carl began miserably. "I
“Draco, we should get the Aurors on that. Someone should be looking into it.”
His students seemed to like him; they would often turn up at Harry’s office hours gushing about him or walked into his classes full of new potions information they were dying to share. He was helpful to the other professors, with no request treated as unreasonable. Yet he was moody, prone to disappearing. Still, it was clear he was making some sort of effort. Malfoy was tersely polite at meals and staff meetings. He stopped going out of his way to avoid Harry on the grounds. He once even said hello and asked how Harry was when they passed each other on the stairs of the owlery. Harry tried to be pleasant back and felt the ice and mistrust start to thaw just enough for him to notice how hard Malfoy was trying to avoid angering anyone at all. It seemed sort of exhausting; a small spark inside of him wanted Harry to push some sort of reaction out of Malfoy again, as he had at the forest that first day. This newer version, the one who made himself smaller in the presence of others, was disconcerting and sad.
Ron nodded and stood up. “Hare. You know I love you, right? And that, if I thought something wasn’t any good for you, I’d tell you?”
They all stomp back to the change rooms in a neat line, always on display in the practice pitch. The reporters' clicks are audible even from a distance, and Draco has to fight the urge to run up and sheild Harry with his cloak; the sensation reminds him that the biography is sitting, blazing Harry's photo in full view, on top of his bag. His face heats with embarrassment.
The darkness was immediately replaced with the dreams, and Draco wasn’t ready.
“Yeah, look, I know, okay? You said it was too complicated, too much paperwork with the Ministry. We don’t have to do it officially if you don’t want to, but like—I’m done, Draco. I don’t want to be with anyone else. So just...marry me? Okay? We can work out the rest.”
Pansy exclaimed, a hand over her mouth. "You
He let a small, lecherous smile cross his mouth, knowing he was going to get another whack and not caring in the slightest. The memory of Neville’s shocked expression, the red that crept up his neck, the staggering away and the promise in even that simple action.
,” he hissed. “Like everything is fine?"
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”
"Did we just—" Harry stammered.
“Draco,” Pansy murmured. “Draco, you know that she’s already gone.”
"So,” Draco continued, “when I finally got the ostrich
For the rest of the morning, they sat at the desk, marking paper after paper. The only time they spoke was to share ridiculous tidbits from student writing, replying with a small laugh or a groan. The warmth from the fire and the light from the lanterns left a companionable fuzziness that lulled Draco into complete comfort. He stretched his feet out under the desk until they rested on the chair beside Harry, which made him start. Draco, laughing at the small jump, earned a tiny glare that sent electricity down his spine and made him snap back to the paper in front of him. A moment later, when Harry silently poked the arch of his socked foot making Draco jump in return, he looked up to find an adorable smile on his face.
to do.”
“I… don’t want that. I have an idea.”
It was easy enough to say, especially when your entire school knew that you were the miraculous survivor of a wartime tragic love tale that had been splashed around the papers. It sold better than being the gangly, unwanted baby of a couple that was too young and then died. Discovering that he had not been unloved had changed the trajectory of his life. The letter to Hogwarts Academy all those years ago had been the rather a shock; a full scholarship, set up in the name of his parents, and a full ride to attend a preeminent private school where they had both gone. His name was on wings in the library, his father had a plaque in the upper halls, and his mother’s face smiled out at him from the common room in his dormitory. The parents who had loved him so much were heroes, both within the school and within the families who had been going there for generations.
"And now," said Ron suggestively, tilting his head in Malfoy’s direction. "We are not."
“Look,” Neville interjected. “I’m sorry, alright? Is that why I’m here? I’m sorry for the...spores. And the...everything after.”
"Seasonal, I think, Mr Potter,” he mumbled quietly, scribbling something onto the pad on his desk. “Going to give you some vitamins. And perhaps a new sleeping draught? I have one I am fond of. Though it is quite strong, I think it may be just the ticket. Just have to be careful you don't use too much."
“I went to talk to a certain old
Harry around pretty quickly.”
“I just...it’s just a thought.”
“I think the
“Angelina might have mentioned,” Harry said with a chuckle. “Thanks, George.”
“Are you meant to be famous, then?” she asked as she handed them over. Making a split second decision, he simply sighed, took them, and ignored her comment. It was the only thing he was going to miss about the fame; being rude for no reason was actually quite freeing.
By the time he actually made it to the bright purple-and-orange corner of number 93, Harry had acquired not only his toastie and his mulled wine, but also had three new pocket broomstick care kits for Ginny, a strange little antique swiss army knife decorated with real fish scales for Arthur, and a feathered hat that was mostly a joke for Ron. He was also significantly happier.
Thankfully, the teasing was just evident enough that Draco managed to tamp down his annoyance.
“You didn’t hear? Thought everyone had heard…”
“How long you here? I can’t get away right now, but we should have a drink or something. Catch up. You know, without the two worrying over you.”
I were going to say anything, it would only be to remind you that you are single. And from what I hear in the world,
"What?"
"Mhmm?"
But his preparation was unnecessary. The backlash didn’t come. He heard a small sigh, full of resignation, come from Potter’s mouth, before he calmly reached out and took Draco’s right wrist instead. Draco looked up at Diego, who was still on the ladder straightening coffee bags, oblivious to his discomfort. When Draco let his gaze drift back to Potter, the glint of his glasses hid the expression in his eyes.
“Today,” Draco continued. “I had myself removed from your will, Father. The bank will send you the papers. I am entitled to
“The only notable exception,” Draco replied dryly.
Draco returned his smile. "Good choice. Degas. Alright then, let's get this done with, before the nausea comes back."
Malfoy finally looked at him, mouth open slightly, "Merlin, you have got to be kidding me. You are Harry fucking Potter. I, in case you have forgotten, am Draco fucking Malfoy. You do not want to go out with me. Not to eat food. Or go for a drink. Or a bloody walk."
“Take it up with him.” Draco heard him say.
Until he reads part four.
Where is it that the pain starts?
“Well, that’s certainly inconvenient,” he grimaced to himself quietly.
“Hm,” Harry muttered, taking a bite of a maple scone and smirking.
He laughed as he hung up, yet his whole body prickled with endless doubt. He spent the next hour trying to decide whether or not to call Abe, and he was so distracted by the many arguments warring in his head that he forgot to glance down and check the caller ID before he picked up.
. And why? For the sake of
Instead, having filled his cup, Harry leaned back against the counter, turned to face Malfoy, who quirked an eyebrow in question. Harry didn't reply for a moment, but for some reason, Malfoy also stayed rooted to the spot. They were locked in a strange and intense stance, both daring the other to leave first.
The smile Harry received in return for this statement was painfully shy; it took everything in him not to reach out, pull Draco’s face between his hands, and insist that he had meant it. Clearly, no one
Draco snickered. “Absolutely not. Go back to sleep.”
The snippets of memory that interrupted his sleep were always the same: a persistent reel of happy moments, clouded by sudden fights, misplaced anger, and true fear. But to explain, to tell anyone what happened, he had to go back. Right back. All the way to the beginning. Before everything. Three years ago seemed like a lifetime when he tried to sum it up.
“Harry, darling. I love you,” Hermione lectured. “And I suppose you’re grieving and everything. But did you seriously not realize that the ‘
about not marrying him. It just seemed easier. Oh my god, you should come! It’s next week.”
“Travers?” Harry asked. “
“You’ll go another day,” Draco snapped. His first name in Potter’s mouth was uncomfortable for any number of reasons, and he was currently trying desperately to be suspicious and unhappy with where he was.
Add to that the fact that the man could stand in a gaggle of people and still seem completely miserable and entirely, absolutely alone, and he was immediately sunk. Draco would have had to...well, not be Draco, to pretend it wasn't Potter.
This gave Harry pause. "Is everything
“I’d almost given up on you, Mr Potter,” Malkin was saying as she unceremoniously dropped to her knees in her beautifully tailored suit and began negotiating with the carpet at the base of one of the platforms. “It’s been...what, almost a year?”
“Stop doing that.”
There was just one sticking point. There was always
Draco chuckled. “Harry thinks you blame him, you think he blames you. Bloody Gryffindors.”
“I’ve been here for a while,” he clarified. “I was talking with Draco.”
“Just checking you’re alive,” Draco replied.
"I wish I could go back in time and tell you everything. Ask you to help me, tell you about the months before we met. We could have saved so much time."
Bill sighed, steepling his fingers on his desk and not meeting Harry’s eye. “Yes. Usually. That’s one of the more difficult decisions to make, much of the time. Especially with...well, with
“Yes, projections of
Pansy gripped his shoulder gently. "Well, since you’re spending more time with him these days, given how much you've been talking about him in your letters lately?"
Draco felt himself blush and refused to respond.
He offered Harry his hands, knowing better by now than to touch him without invitation in the midst of an attack. Harry gratefully took both Draco's hands in his own and focused on his concerned face, the pace of his breath, trying to slow down his thoughts. Finally, he the beat of his heart calmed and felt the immediate exhaustion take hold, so different from the general tired he always felt now. Instead, his head rolled down, his neck no longer stable enough to hold it up. His eyelids drooped, his muscles relaxing.
"Oh and I need the bigger bedroom, do I? Because I'm such a snob. Listen if you're going to just —"
“It’s Poppy, actually. And yes, that sounds lovely. It’s glorious to meet you, Mr Potter,” she added, reaching out to help Harry up. “Thank you for saving Malfoy here. We’ve all been wondering when some bloke would finally make him sack up and get out of this hellscape.”
“Sure, there are things I
The shop was rammed with holiday shoppers, but Harry’s grin remained firmly in place as he pushed his way through to the back room, where he knew George would be hiding and organizing while the younger employees took charge of the chaos. It had been Angelina’s only demand when they had expanded to the third store; during December, George took a step back and let other people run things. He actually seemed grateful after the first year, and he’d been much easier to convince ever since.
“We are going to be just fine, Madamoiselle. Just fine.”
Draco, despite the almost constant threats to do just that. He was afraid, most of the time, that Lucius Malfoy would finally lose what was left of his sanity and either do it anyway or have him killed. Pansy liked to insist that this worry was just Draco being melodramatic. Draco wasn’t so sure.
Draco laughed, feeling just a little bit lighter for having admitted to himself how he felt. “Why the fuck did I call you again?” he teased.
Harry had grown suddenly shy in the late hours of the afternoon. Sleep had engulfed them both, and apparently, waking up had rumpled and unsettled the man - whose eyes, Draco noted, were a more complex golden green when he wasn’t wearing his glasses.
. Please, mate. You’re my last hope.”
“Why would your father want you to meet some random bank worker, a
“Um,” Draco said about half an hour later, looking up for the first time and noticing that the cafe had become considerably busier. Still, Diego came over at his utterance and cooed appreciatively at what he found. He snatched the sketchbook from Draco’s hands and held it aloft.
“You know, strong enough. Strong when you need to be, but plenty stubborn too,” Draco said, taking a step away from the counter. "I'm sure of it. That's you to a tee."
“Sure.”
“Feels like I’m being forced,” Draco grumbled.
“These things are adding up to strange, though, Draco,” Diego continued. “The tension with Harry. The scars. That word those people used... Muggle? What’s it mean? Who are you? Is it some sort of cult?”
“I was just leaving,” Draco said, standing up and picking up his coat. Harry’s brow was twisted in discomfort, and Draco didn’t know what to do about it. He nodded at everyone in general and fled. He’d made it all the way to the door before he realised that Diego was right behind him.
Rather than invoking anger as Draco had been hoping, Carl's face fell even further; suddenly Draco was horrified he was going to cry. He wasn't sure his convictions could take that tonight.
“But, jobs can be hard to find.”
Draco nodded, taking another step back and smiling a gentle, lascivious grin that dropped to the bottom of Neville’s stomach before he had a chance to stop it. “We don’t want to be interrupted by our other...colleagues.”
The damned thing was delicious.
“Some big intercommunity organization that may or may not be raising money for...something. I think they’re building a hospital? Or...something. It’s that corporation. The one with the creepy name? Bloster and...something. Blurgin? Blakely?”
“Harry?” she questioned. “Listen, don’t get angry, but... are you sure you saw what you saw?”
“You asked who decided to move eleven days before Christmas,” Draco replied. “Just reminding you that was you.”
"We need to talk," Draco blurted.
Draco nodded, looking at his hands.
Draco put the paper into the same hand as the kitten and carefully took three steps forward. If he’d leant down right now, he would probably smell Harry’s cheap shampoo and cinnamon toothpaste.
figures something out, I’ve known about it for weeks and have already tried about seven different solutions.”
“He's fine! He's fine. Well…he's fine now,” he amended. “At the time, he sort of forgot that he had a family and a business and disappeared to Tenerife for a week. Took me days to track him down. And then, when I got him home, he couldn’t actually handle the place. So I just sort of...took over.”

“Right,” Pansy laughed. “And

“When he showed up yesterday with that story, I was expecting it to be impossible to do it a second time. But it wasn’t,” she insisted. “I believe him. He’s worked so hard to be someone he wasn’t raised to be, and you’re my family. If you need
Not even the walk through the twinkle lights to the flat helped distract him, and so when he saw Carl lingering against the door jamb in the corridor, he didn't bother disguising his sigh of frustration.
“Got it from the past owner,” Diego said as he descended. “Was so impressed with how Harry ran the place that he gave it to him when he retired, isn’t that right?”
Draco shrugged from his chair. His wand was out and he had a mug in his hand.
“Don’t tell anyone,” he begged by way of a reply.
“Usually,” Harry said with a shrug. He laughed at the look of irritation that crossed his face. “Okay, well, first thing’s first. You’re not using a strong enough memory. Were you remembering a time when you were happy?”
He nodded into the emptiness and began.
He tried, for a moment, to connect the timelines of what he understood. Draco, when they had first started seeing each other, had refused to come anywhere where they may run into wizards. He’d assumed it was just Draco being skittish and afraid of prejudice. Since those were both valid reasons, he’d just let it go.
"Especially this one,” Draco said fondly.
On Christmas day that year, they told Molly. Well, told would be an oversimplification. At Ron’s insistence, they instead simply turned up at the Burrow with Draco in tow. He’d tried his best to look presentable. Trimmed hair, oiled wingtip shoes, a suit jacket and a deep-green knitted vest that she’d made him with a tiny
He looked around the flat. At some point in the night, the bits and pieces of Carl that had been there had disappeared. It didn’t look empty, though. It was less claustrophobic, less not-him. For the first time in weeks, Draco remembered that he probably hadn't planned on staying with Carl.
Draco resisted. Harry could practically hear the thoughts that were spinning around his beautiful head. The questions he’d just raised to Hermione, the emotions he wanted to ask Harry about, the cautions he wanted to provide. But Harry silenced them all, not by pushing or forcing. They’d both had enough of that. Instead, he pulled back, letting an inch of space between them and staring up into Draco’s eyes as intently as he could. It took a couple of heartbeats, a few fervent moments before Draco let the questions be answered all at once and leaned back in. The gasps for breath sounded like one lung breathing, and the melting of Harry’s body turned into a hum all at once.
As time went on, however, he became more and more exhausted by the decision to let her help him.
Harry nodded once and walked away.
Technically, the gala was the last event he had to attend as Potter and Prose. His manager had set up the donation months ago, convinced that Harry needed the PR boost. At £500 a plate, he wasn’t sure how a fancy ass dinner in the Royal Botanicals was going to help his public image, but that was why he employed other people to do the parts of celebrity that he did not understand.
“What?”
at both of them and halted the conversation until Harry successfully poked her in the ribs enough for her to list it. He’d just sulked for the final hour, pretending Hermione wasn’t in the car with him.
Draco’s hands were very full; he was holding three folders and a bag of trash he’d meant to put in the bin at least five minutes ago. If his hands had not been so full—well, he’s not sure what he would have done, but it certainly would not have been standing passively while Harry Potter reached out and tucked his hair gently behind his ear. It certainly would not have been letting Potter spin on his heel and waltz very far away.
The house arrest was lifted long enough to have a funeral and read the will, the contents of which had not surprised Draco.
“Welcome to bloody Paris,” Draco sighed sarcastically. “You’ll never again not know the time. I’m going to eat, you coming?”
“Fucking,
Finally, after too many sleepless nights, he wrote a very short letter, three sentences that were going to cost him far more in pride than they were in postage.
Lambert’s expression shifted to a far less charitable glare. He shuffled a few papers around and pulled a file out from the bottom of his desk. “
“Oh, sorry!” he exclaimed, taking in Draco in a distant sort of way. “What time is it? There were...bells?”
She looked at him with a puzzled expression.
“I would never say that because I love Rose with every fibre of my being. I would die for her,” Harry insisted. “Besides, I don’t have to say it because you just did.”
They descended a staircase that Harry had never taken and hopped into a very short, very uneventful mine cart ride. They seemed to be only a level or two down, which was confusing given the vault number.
“That’d be you,” Draco muttered sleepily.
“What? Draco, don’t be daft."
Ginny softened and folded him into her arms. “Okay. Okay, let’s go. We can ask Madam Malkin what she knows. Then we’ll go for dinner at the old place. Get really drunk. Okay?”
Draco nodded and handed Harry a plate of roasted vegetables.
A tisking sound behind him made him whip around. "Watch your mouth, Mister," Amanda clucked in a passable impression of their boss. "Oooh, yesterday's jumper. Do
“Always wanted to,” Draco replied. “Seemed like my only chance.”
“Why?” Harry mused, genuinely confused. When Draco just looked away, he shook his head and headed toward the tent. “As long as you promise not to attack me, I think we'll be fine. Come on, let’s do it now. Then you should try the spell one more time. Make sure it wasn’t a fluke.”
“Okay. Up to you. Only…”
McGonagall finally looked up from where she had been writing, gazing at him over her spectacles with the sharp features that had spent many years chastising him.
“Late one, huh?”
“Aguamenti,” he murmured as he dropped his bag again. The water in his canteen was cool and refreshing, and he laughed at himself for not realising he could have done it sooner.
"Sounds fair,” Harry laughed, stepping forward to stop the doors closing. “Tomorrow?" he asked hastily.
“Yeah. Didn’t think so.”
Harry’s smile faltered. “Oh. Shit. This is weird, isn’t it? Damn. It is. Sorry, I keep forgetting we aren’t exactly…”
“That’s just what I was going to ask,” Draco said gruffly as he approached from the other direction. He gestured for them to follow as he walked into the gate of a small parkette. He turned them into a small green space with a hideous fountain that was empty for the winter and sat on the edge. Harry stood over him as Pansy began to pace.
“Okay, listen," she continued. "I’m Hermione. I...work for the government. He’s Harry. He’s a professor. That’s Ginny. She...plays a sport professionally. That’s not that important, but like...we aren’t exactly killers-for-hire, so you can relax. His husband died. About eight months ago.”
"I like your robes," Harry muttered eventually, taking a careful, calculated sip, but not breaking eye contact with the man who was now staring him down.
"Yeah, but you're Hermione,” Harry grumbled. “I think people are going to turn up just because it's
And that was it. He was done.
“Right now,” Draco insisted. “You’re off in ten minutes, right? Just...let’s try it.”
Harry bristled, sighed at the fact that he had bristled, and shoved McGonagall’s words deeper down in his chest as he icily replied. “It’s just a little hard to be out on the pitch and keep seeing
“Do you think he knows that we know he’s there, Zinzin?” Draco murmured, swinging his legs down from the window and watching the cat as it approached Harry’s trainers. “I don’t think he does, do you?”
“Is this your Muggle
There, before both of them, a small silver swirl of light dashed out in front of them. Draco gasped, immediately dropping the spell. Harry beamed at him.
“There’s a first time for everything, I guess,” she shot back, her voice full of teasing instead of serious, mum-levels of disappointment.
“Nev,” he said hesitantly. “Erm, you…you’re not...having second thoughts or anything are you?”
“You could be Audrey’s plus one! She doesn’t have a date.”
“Hermione,” the red-head—Ginny—interrupted warningly, “don’t.”
Draco suddenly closed the gap between them, sinking into a kiss that he had been planning for weeks, had been desperately trying to convince himself he didn’t need, wasn’t going to take. Which was pretty stupid, in retrospect. Of course he needed it. He sighed contentedly against Harry’s shocked lips and Harry laughed, wrapping his arms around Draco and kissing him again, more gently, more carefully. They needed to be more careful this time, Draco knew. It was just hard to remember when he was wrapped up in
Harry laughed despite his confusion. “What are you doing here?” he asked with a grin.
“We’re gonna land soon,” Harry said loudly, shouting in his ear. “If you wanna to do it.”
“Hermione, I’m fine. You go see Ron, I’ll see you in six days. You’re being a bit dramatic, love.”
Holy fuck.
“Um, yes,” Draco nodded, grasping Harry’s hand. “Next year.”
Draco resisted his quip, about how if he hadn't missed it, Draco wouldn't have played. He murmured what he hoped sounded like a grateful mumble. He stood. Slowly, he put his bag on his shoulder, turned and put the book on the bench beside Harry's toweled form. He let his eyes linger on his chest, let himself imagine a thousand more locker room fantasies that would never be enough.
Malfoy looked indignant, "I have."
Finally, they stormed out and Potter sagged against the counter.
They walked side by side for a block or two before she wrapped her arm through his and sighed.
"Oh, your friend Theo was by yesterday to pick up the sock donations. He mentioned. I'm so happy. I miss happy Draco. I missed
As Draco placed the antlers on the counter, the woman behind the till smiled a beatific grin at Harry pushing the pram out of the store; Draco couldn’t blame her. Harry Potter, dressed for winter and fit as he ever was, cut a hard figure to ignore while pushing a pram with a smiling baby.
“Don’t even start. Your name is on a piece of paper in my pocket, and the number to your vault was inside a concealed box. So don’t fucking play with me. I promise you, I’ve very little stopping me from destroying you right now. It has been a very long two days. Which, considering my year, is saying something.”
“Yeah, so?”
"I'll take this one if that's okay?" he supplied, pointing to the back bedroom.
turn down Knockturn, Harry almost dropped the phone as Ron continued to sputter. “Got to go,” he hissed.
Harry and Luna just stared at him for a moment.
“What the actual fuck, Draco,” he whispered, voice shaking.
“I know how I’m supposed to be feeling. I should be furious. I should be saying things like ‘how can I ever trust you now’ and ‘I’ll never be fooled again. But…” He trailed off with a sigh. “Hermione, what the hell am I supposed to do?”
“Out, Potter.”
game.”
“That’s true,” Travers grimaced. “Top marks. Grew up here. But I was ill. I didn’t spend much time outside. My parents were outcasts, dissenters in the first uprising. They fell out of society. No one really paid attention, and so no one even blinked when they sent me away to school at nine. It’s pretty easy to disappear from this world when no one cares about you at all.”
Well, okay. Harry was aware that this likely wasn’t actually a
“Well,” Potter said, scratching his face and considering. “You could make them look like mooncalves...it’d be kinda cute. Unless that’s too weird.”
“You still think you’re no good for me, huh?” he asked quietly.
Harry nodded, then looked away as he asked, “Why wasn’t he upset, Draco?”
Instead, he had gone straight home, showered, then crawled into bed, even though it was barely half five in the evening. He curled into a tight ball and didn't move. Even when he heard Draco floo in downstairs. Even when he bounded up the stairs and straight into bed, curling tightly around Harry's back.
He doesn’t really have time to contemplate the problem, though, because suddenly Harry is present as well, groaning and murmuring “fucking
Soon, they stood in front of a small, unassuming door, which Flitwick pushed open confidently. “These will be your quarters. They should be set up with whatever you requested from the start of term letter, but let Minerva know if you need anything. We’re meeting in the Hall for lunch at half-twelve and then you’ll have the afternoon to plan for your first week of lessons. The meetings don’t start until after dinner.”
“You still have a few months.”
Abe, predictably, stood up and clapped his hands together. “Knew it!” he declared. “Strings my ass. Well, and?”
“Yes, thank you, Potter,” Malfoy sneered, though he seemed like the tone caused him physical pain.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said in a rush. “I wasn’t trying to be sneaky, or anything. I’ll... I’ll stop coming here.”
“Don’t think he’s coming,” Draco muttered, blowing on the tea and taking a large, burning gulp that felt like safety and comfort .
’ to a unicorn? A unicorn is a fucking unicorn. White. Horn. Rainbow tail, which is utterly ridiculous, let me tell you. But children know what they like, and they like rainbow tails.”
“No rush,” came the unmistakably posh accent he’d been waiting for since the beginning of the year had revealed him sitting at the head tables. Neville chuckled and continued his task. His day was
Owen didn’t wait at home, of course. He hadn’t become the youngest agent in the company by following the orders of the faceless operatives on the other end of the line. He followed his gut, even if that same gut had nearly gotten him killed a half a dozen times or so.
Draco smiled blandly, smoothing back Rose’s hair.
“Well,” Potter considered. “There were moments when I knew I definitely should not be doing it, you know? But the timing was never right for me to just…quit.”
“Someone’s in a good mood,” Dean noted.
She shrugged at him, winked, and threw down a dusty case of frilly red panties, embellished with the words
“Theodore, darling,” she muttered, pulling away. “Were you actually worried about asking me to leave London? I’m only here still because of you. You are all such idiots. Seriously. How did you even survive without me.”
“But not Theo?” Draco snapped. It was uncharitable and he felt petty before he was even finished the sentence. Old arguments were hard to displace. Harry’s face turned dark for a fraction of a second and then he shook his head and sighed.
“Shut up.”
that I invited you to take a
Hurrying up the stairs, he was pretty sure he knew what awaited him in her office. Sure enough, as the gargoyle spun out of the way, he was attacked in an enthusiastic hug that only lasted a second. His head was swiped a moment later.
“Sorry,” he said when he noticed Draco looking. “This is so stupid. Its just...my friends had convinced me I was crazy.”
A bank vault in a building that had never been his friend.
Harry closed his eyes for a second and charged bravely into the conversation he’d wanted to have when he’d grabbed Malfoy’s dog that day in the park.
“I—” Harry started. “Fine. Okay. Nevermind then, I guess.”
Harry lasted three more months at the Ministry. For twelve long weeks, he battled his way through interdepartmental mistrust and overly cautious questioning of witnesses. He went to therapy and learned all the letters and acronyms that summarised who he was in the post-war world. But then, the story came out that prisoners were being released in light of the war crimes tribunal.
“Watch your tongue, young man,” Lucius snapped. “Who on earth gave you permission to transfer ownership? I certainly don’t remember hearing about it from the board.”
“Doesn’t matter,” Draco shrugged. “We’re taking the tunnels.”
A young witch with long, curly dark hair scurried out and nodded as though she already knew what she was going to be asked. Madam Malkin beckoned them to follow her to the back chamber, where the sight of the raised fitting platforms brought a chill to Harry’s bones he had not been expecting.
“It’s Molly, love,” she said. “Now come. You can help me in the kitchen.”
They approached the first desk they came too, where one of the stout creatures looked up with widened eyes.
“I'd half convinced myself you were going to turn up in a banana costume,” Draco murmured, embarassed.
"Good lord, no," Pansy grimaced.
“I thought you didn’t care what Potter thought any more?” Pansy smirked, taking another sip. “Merlin, this truly is awful.”
But that isn’t what happened. The Mage had made sure of that.
“I get it,” Harry said around his full mouth. “It’s an exhausting spell. Ready to try again after we eat?”
“Understood, Mrs Weasley,” Draco whispered, opening the box to gaze at the familiar brushed platinum inside. It had an inlay of flat, single moonstone, tiny and unassuming. Harry’s matching ring had an emerald instead. New beginnings and great love. Fitting, now. Fitting even then. The pain of it’s meaning not changing at all hurt him deeply, but Draco snapped the lid shut. Suddenly, he was pulled int a loose hug, a carefully held embrace with distance and caution, but a hug nonetheless.

whore. Do not believe we are on equal ground here, fool. I am here with a message from your mother. This is your last chance. After Samhain, the offer to return to your station and your house expires.”
A Sacred Family member who was either a squib or had had his memory severely altered.
“You okay?” he said to Draco in his soft, midnight voice. The one made of music and cotton, the one that soothed slights and lulled him back to sleep.
you speak to me like I am one of your lackeys. Do I need to remind you what is at stake for you?”
“You’re kidding, right?” Harry grinned at him and it threw Draco off balance. “I used to have the
He leapt back up and ran all the way down the stairs, finding the box still lit with bright blue flames that did not seem to consume the things it surrounded. Harry smiled. The flames were quite beautiful. He approached carefully and whispered the words to himself. When nothing happened, he spoke up.
He tried to reason with himself; it
Harry Potter had worn off.
“Draco, I promise, this is the only time I will ever do this to you,” Abe whined into the phone. “I will deal with the paystubs for a month.
bullshit, but it’s horrid and we are not living there. We’ll sell this place and buy a nice little terrace, okay?”
“I just…” Draco inhaled. Once said, this statement was going to be irreversible. “I think you should check. If the...spore thing is still a thing.”
“Why the fuck do you care?”
’; fairies with cute dresses and gnomes with pointed hats. Centaurs that helped passing children, and friendly dragons that let people ride them.
“You know why you’re doing this.”
Harry literally choked on his own spit trying to back up the conversation. He grabbed Draco by the shoulders right before he could sit and spun him around to face the aisle.
The street was dead and lifeless, save for the few vendors who did morning wares; the coffee carts, the woman selling the handknit broom covers for winter riding (which he’d almost been tempted to buy, simply because it looked like a giant, broom shaped tissue box with a spot for your hands to tuck into and hold on. January lesson game changer. He’d come back to that later, depending on whether or not he could convince himself he didn’t care how ridiculous it looked). He stretched his arms above his head and yawned in the refreshing morning air. Being out of bed had definitely been what he needed.
Draco took the box from her outstretched hand.
"Darling, it's Christmas and this is the first time you've thrown up. That's miraculous. Are you okay?"
Faded smiles, distant expressions, they were the norm. But Draco? Draco was vibrant. He’d forgiven everyone but himself. He’d found truth and happiness for everyone else, but still wilted every day.
“I can’t make anyone believe me. I don’t deserve another chance. I don’t understand why I’m being given one.”
The wild panic in the man’s eyes as he returned to the land of the living was sickeningly gratifying, and Harry didn’t even bother trying to deny himself that; he’d had a very long year. He allowed the macabre glee that flared in him as he recognized fear. He’d examine that later.
He had been uninformed on how significantly dogs would change your life. Suddenly, Draco had to go to training classes and be home at reasonable hours, take walks in places he’d missed for almost a decade of hiding out and hermitting. London took on a new life when he was forced to be in it. It definitely wasn’t all bad.
Draco didn’t reply. He read through the file and handed it back with a nod. “Yes.”
“It was just...
Harry nodded.
Draco saw Harry.
“Look,” he said gruffly. “No offence, but do you think maybe you can do your wallowing someplace warmer? Come on. Let’s get out of here.”
Draco opened the door with a confused expression, clearly concerned by the vehemence of the knocking. He looked tired and sad, such a strange disconnect from the way Harry had left him a few moments earlier that Harry’s stomach dropped to his feet; he had never been more sure about his theories than he was in this moment. He was right. He knew it.
"You know," Oscar said, hearing Harry and Luna discussing the problem yet again. "Those old school fairs were always fun… did you two go to Muggle primary? Did you have those?”
“He has a point,” the woman who had just unwillingly let go of his arm sighed.
has ever happened. Come in, come in, you great sod. We’re all through here.”
When he woke up in the middle of the night, there was an imprint of a peacock on his face. He scrubbed it in the bathroom mirror, his stomach lurching uncomfortably. He’d woken with Diego’s arm slung possessively across his hips, and it had dragged the entire list into the foreground so that he couldn’t ignore the problem. It was easy in the light of day, with Diego smiling at him, making him feel important and protected.
"Oh. Oh. Okay."
“You know, Potter, I was nervous about you being on my squad. A man with your level of… er,
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered.
“Not really,” he replied, with a smirk she probably couldn’t see in the darkness. “It’s only orientation.”
The sneer is fake and Harry seems to feel it. He scrunches up his nose, wrinkles his forehead, pauses for a second before huffing and walking away. Draco knows he'd have thrown a punch—or worse—had Potter asked him what was wrong.
why you have been brought here. Do you honestly not?”
Lou took a breath, tapping her pencil on the board before she continued. “Harry, did you end up going out with that man from the team? I know that was… a question for you.”
"What the
“Why?” she asked, genuinely puzzled. “Did you also want me to personally inform you that you are going to be required to teach Slytherins?”
“Your tie is hideous. Wear the black one.” She patted him on the cheek and headed back out of his apartment. “Don’t drink too much and embarrass me. Please. Just...behave.”
“This is
, I'm expecting to be in huge shit with Montgomery. But he just looks at me, straight-faced, and says '
Draco chuckled, pressing kisses to Harry's bare back, "Don't care. Missed you. Did you solve it?"
“The same weird dreams?”
“I’ve only known for a few weeks. And he just moved out last week. I swear, I had no idea. I didn’t even know
“I see him,” Harry smiled.
“Oh thank god. We’re short-staffed as it is and this new shipment of reindeer games — I shit you not, that’s what they’re called— is on its way because it missed the truck and also I’m pretty sure that Maya—”
“Luna?” he called as he opened the door.
She pulled back and grinned at him. "Is this the part where you tell me you got him back?"
The pitch was exactly the same, as though it hadn’t been destroyed and rebuilt at least three times. He wandered down to the Gryffindor entrance and snuck through the waving tapestries. On the third level, he moved out to the bleachers and was startled to find someone out in the field, flying and throwing a charmed Quaffle that returned to them like a boomerang. Harry watched hesitantly for a moment, feeling ludicrously like he was intruding.
“Well,” he replied. “And I wanted to apologise for the whole...thing…”
"You know, D," Harry grinned, pulling Draco to him and nibbling his ear, an act that always elicited Harry's favourite sounds in the world. “You sound suspicious like you might be
Her friend nodded, and she turned back to him.
“Borgin and Burke?” Harry asked, surprised. Gloria touched her nose. “Don’t they have, like, highly questionable business practices?”
in love; truthfully, had the student body ever been polled, the Headmistress would have simply discovered overwhelming relief that two of the school’s favourite professors and coaches were happy.
“Harry,” he whispered reverently. The name jolted Harry back to earth. His eyes snapped to Draco immediately. “Harry,” he repeated, pointing fervently.
The door slamming makes Draco startle; he’s pretty sure neither of them had actually touched it. The spark of frenetic magic wafts into his consciousness, right before Harry pulls off his shirt in the middle of the entryway, and Draco’s consciousness decides to fully take its leave.
“Oh, I can do you one better,” Harry said, paused at the door. “Think about it, Draco. Is Neville currently married?”
It took a moment, but Draco’s face broke into a smile and he laughed a little bit too before turning to Harry in irritation. “Not what I meant, idiot. I just...I have roommates. And we leave the doors open. It helps when I can hear people.”
Draco sniggered and rolled onto his back again. “Fine,” he muttered. “Keep your secrets.”
Stalling for his own sake, Draco looked down at the pram and found a small, smiling little girl in it. “Shouldn’t you...uh,” he began.
“Somehow, I don’t think we’re going to find what we’re looking for here,” Harry teased, poking the last shelf to their left and giggling to himself as the very realistic dildos that were housed there wiggled and shook.
“If not that,” Mcgonagall conceded, “then I expect at least a modicum of professionalism from you both.”
“I look ridiculous. You don’t have to rub it in. You, sitting there practically a carbon fucking copy of Frank with your impossibly perfect corset and your hair. I get it. I’m not Rocky. Pansy made me.”
“Well,” Draco groaned. “That was bizarre."
“It’s already ready. Serum and everything. I meant to warn you...the guy is using a new batch of poppies. He says you might dream.”
She took a step toward him and studied him in return, folding her arms and appraising him.
He heard himself babbling. He could admit to his terrified brain that this was not a wise move. But he couldn't seem to stop, not even when the large, brutish man stepped forward with a growl.
, but I am still pretty furious.”
With a suitcase and a pile of leftovers, Draco left Diego’s flat.
Part three.
witnessed a creature quite like the ones that surrounded their little party, dashing about from left to right.
Harry knew from school that Grand Openings needed direction and activities if they were going to be successful. They brought out people who had come on interest alone, and not necessarily because they were ready to spend money. He wanted to make his opening fun, but for the life of him, he couldn't work out a theme that wasn't unbearable or an immense amount of work.
Draco looked at her for the first time; he was shocked to find her leaning on the railing, eyes damp and a flush in her cheeks.
Draco sighed in return. “I am going to
“Pansy, stop,” he insisted. “I don’t ‘want’ him and I am
Draco was leaning on the edge of the door in Hermione and Ron’s kitchen, technically, under the guise of ‘drying dishes’. He had the towel flung over his shoulder and everything. But since he’d just been throwing a spell at all the dishes Harry held up with his own wand, they’d settled into their current positions instead. Harry was perched on the countertop, avoiding Draco’s gaze.
He sat up quickly. The solution was so simple it was ludicrous, so stupid it felt perfect despite its reckless roots. He pulled out the drawer and found a scrap of parchment and a pen.
He had unintentionally dropped the level of his voice, and that, combined with the words, forced Malfoy to sputter in surprise. Harry wisely walked away and went back to his floor. These things took time.
“Because I wanted you
. I’ve changed. No, that’s not it.”
“You think...Neville is…”
“Thanks for grabbing him,” Draco said sharply. “I appreciate it. Let’s go, boy."
"There's a lot I owe you, mama," Draco whispered. He was suddenly embarrassingly close to crying. "If you only knew what I'd been doing… What I've
“Why are you pushing this?” he interrupted, a little annoyed now. “You hate him.”
Worthy of Harry's
"It's a bit more than what you asked to pay, the lease,” he apologised. “I can try and talk it down."
“I’m leaving now,” he insisted. “Thanks for the lesson about the strings.”
Draco pulled back, looking momentarily wounded until Harry wound his hands into his slightly too long hair and held him there, in his lap.
"No, Harry. That's not true. London is where—if you'll excuse me—
His dinner turned to ash in his mouth, fork constantly adding a tinny taste to everything he placed on his tongue. The whole ‘interhouse unity’ game was great in theory, but he hardly felt that it was necessary to create an ever-changing seating chart in the Great Hall. Tonight, he was placed between three chattering first year Hufflepuffs who kept asking him questions through full mouths of roast beef. To his left, a sneering group of older students seemed extremely unhappy about the conversation; they kept glaring at Harry, as though he was causing the disruption. He’d been slowly turning to his right throughout the entire meal, which was a problem, since to his right sat Draco Malfoy.
Harry laughed again, surprising himself and apparently, also Malfoy, whose cautious smile was wavering and trepidacious. Harry tried to find a way to avoid the question he wanted to ask, but felt the Gryffindor bubble up inside of him. Almost against his will, he stepped over the edge onto dangerous ground.
“The Mage,” Harry had deadpanned. He was obviously not impressed. “The Mage is a story.”
he'd yelled, making people turn on the street.
Harry, ridiculously, had felt very emotional at this statement. He had never been able to explain it to Ron and Hermione so succinctly.
When he closed the door, it felt like it was the end. For the first time in weeks, something felt completed and almost okay.
him as they left.
“Sure,” Draco yawned. “You?”
need to fix his potions assignment. He would spend the hours between breakfast and lunch either buried in books doing research, or in his shirtsleeves over his gold cauldron, begging his latest combination not to blow up. But, after lunch, he’d throw on his cloak and find Draco.
“Understood,” he answered miserably, slinking out of the office and closing the door behind him.
Rose gave out a high-pitched squeal. “Abberlok,” she added decisively.
Harry looked at Draco, his hair in disarray, his pyjamas sagging. It was an image not many people had seen; or at least, that had always been his assumption. He nodded.
“Potter,” he replied gruffly. “What is it?”
Facing Harry and telling him that they belonged together.
Slowly, so slowly that for the first few hours, Harry wasn’t convinced it was actually happening, Draco started to show his humanity again. He swore gently under his breath when the work got hard. He made small quips when things went wrong. He allowed hilarious commentary about people they could see in the distance. Not mean, just funny. And then, of course, he apologised.
Potter believe that he’s the only one who can deliver shocking edicts and insufferable flirting?
Draco sighed and wrapped his arms around Harry, pulling him even closer to whisper, "I know, but please stop being a hero. I feel like I've just found you; I'm not ready to face losing you."
“You just look so happy,” Diego shrugged. “It’s nice to see you and Harry work out some of your issues or whatever.”
“Ron, I am doing a bad thing,” he panted, out of breath more from fear than exertion; fear of what, he could not quite put his finger on.  All he knew for sure was that he

Neville gulped. He — really and honestly — did not believe he was here for an apology. And everything about that reality was starting to sink in. In a painful, pant constricting sort of way.
When he got to the Burrow the week before Christmas, Harry felt listless and exhausted. He reasoned that it was because the last week of teaching before a holiday had been more difficult than any day as an Auror, with students hopped up on too much sugar and not enough sleep and the impending excitement of trips home and holiday traditions. There was the added problem of Harry being unprepared for the quiet of the Burrow before everyone else was also home.

Theo laughed at him when he got up to get his third. "Pansy," he laughed. "I think perhaps we're ready for gifts."

“Nah, you don’t need to be. I’d like that job, by the way? If the offer is still on the table.”
And at the same time, with his wand raised defensively, Harry's heart stopped beating at the muttering of one, particularly recognisable word.

“And the Driscoll’s?”
“Well, I
Diego laughed, overhearing the conversation from the other side of the bar, where he was rinsing out cups. “Cue the syrup defence,” he sang.
“Yeah, I do. I can see it. But, still.”
“There’s just one more joining us for tea,” he replied casually, walking to the corridor and breezing past the elf who was headed to the same place. No one said anything as he left and he exhaled a held breath as the conversation restarted at his back. His parents were hard to shock; he was counting on that trait to save him now. He whipped open the door, startling a casually staring Harry Potter, whose hands were stuck in smart black trousers, paired with trim black shoes and a dark green button-down that was, miraculously, meticulously tucked in. Draco collapsed in relief and a great calm washed over him. This, if nothing else, was the right choice.
“So. Want to go on a date, then?” Harry announced, glancing back at Draco. “Your dog seems to think it’s a good idea.”
“What?” Harry demanded.
“Love spores, actually.”
After the first step had been taken, their friendship stabilized before they ever worked out how to be lovers; it was months before Draco would admit that he loved Harry, even though it had likely been true since he’d written that letter. The real nature of the changes between them remained unknown to all but McGonagall, whom they told on their six month anniversary. She had merely smirked, nodded, and warned them not to tell the students, a knowing gaze behind her glasses that made them both squirm.
They walked down the highstreet silently for a moment before Harry cleared his throat.
"I have twelve pounds of Bertie Botts in my flat," Draco said out of the blue. "I don't know why I didn't throw them out. They're still in their little favour bags. I looked at them every day and thought 'you should throw them out'. But there they sit. Do you think my brain knew? That one day, we'd be standing here again?"
actually existing as a couple again. He thought they were both being themselves. He was doing his best. To hear Draco so directly contradict this belief annoyed him. And he snapped.
! How?!”
“It’s half ten!” Draco called after harry.
perfect. You know that.”
Harry smirked. It was easier, now, after years of practice, to recognise when Malfoy was just being swallowed by his own pride. He knew the telltale twitch of his hands, the avoidance of direct eye contact. Malfoy was embarrassed, not angry. So instead of replying, Harry pulled out his wand, and with a lazy flick, muttered ‘
Despite seeming both fierce and relatively annoyed, there was a hint of something else in the creature's voice, something that Owen understood better than most.
Malfoy didn't seem to have a reply to that, but he did move even further toward the other wall of the lift, shoving his hands in the pockets of his robes and not meeting Harry's eye.
“I’m in the middle of a class,” he complained, aware that Jordan Dawes was going to be completely incapable of helping him. Her hair was whipping wildly in the wind and she shrugged at him apologetically. “Alright, alright. Head back in. Tell her I’ll be up in five minutes, once I get these Hufflepuffs into the hall. If she can meet me there…”
They were in potions before he finally snapped. He’d made it through Charms and Advanced Detection Spells, two hours of torturous practice for their first set of midterm exams, due to attack the upper years the second week of December, now only a fortnight away.
“I’m exhausted,” Draco said, closing his eyes.
“I, good sir, am excellent.”
“Old friend?” she said, turning back to Draco.
His glib smirk from the previous night flashed through Draco's mind now as he gathered his wallet, phone, and keys without glancing at Harry again.
think of that? What the hell were you playing at, you sodding idiot.” He sat down on the edge of his bed for a moment. A moment to be angry and sad and confused, and in the midst of that moment, his brain remembered how to be alive. How to remember without the cloud of grief. Harry would never know why it was that moment. But it was.
of the problem for
Owl Harry.
“I know. I am. It’s just...he looked so…
” the brown-haired women hissed, turning sharply back to the bank worker, who just nodded shortly and began to walk away with a terse 'wait here' behind him.
“Fuck off,” Harry laughed, finishing the mopping just as Diego reemerged, smiling at the scene in front of him and jolting Draco back to Muggle reality.
“Relax. We both know this is the right choice. Admit it, I lasted longer than you thought I was going to.”
When Draco showed up with the parchment in hand already, fury crusted into every pore of his skin, Harry had grinned at him. Apparently, that had been all it took. He’d disarmed the Slytherin. Open emotion and intention? No secrets, only honesty? He won.
“For what?” Draco breathed.
. You do things. It's your… thing. You do things you shouldn’t be able to do. I know one hundred percent that you can do this. You just have to decide if it’s what you
“I’m sorry I’ve been working so much this summer.”
“Forgetting?”
"Are you sure?” Draco said, rare uncertainty creeping into his tone as he echoed Harry’s embrace. “You would tell me, right? If you needed… help." Draco was speaking so quietly now that Harry almost didn't hear the last word at all.
Like a terrible play where you can already see the ending, Enter DRACO MALFOY. Harry could still clearly remember the conversation from that day, almost word for word. They’d had their boots off, trading Quidditch magazines ver another cuppa that none of them needed, and Ron had looked up to see a blond, scowling head wander quietly into the room to fill his own mug.
Harry didn’t show up to meals, never appeared in the staff room in his customary desperate-for-tea stupor, and didn’t turn up at Draco’s table in the library each night with a stack of papers and a silent presence that Draco hadn’t realised he had grown to appreciate. In fact, if it weren’t for his students claiming otherwise, Draco would have been convinced that Potter hadn’t returned from the break at all.
They are safe
“Not why I was asking,” Harry shrugged. “Just wondered if you’d ever been to the Blueberry.”
“Psh,” Draco teased. “Sorry, we can’t all be Saint Harry Potter.”
“Exactly. What on earth would you even tell them?”
“I forgot to tell you, we are,” Harry said simply. “I’ve known it for years. We
Harry laughed a surprised laugh, and Malfoy smiled widely.
In the change rooms, the normal cajoling begins. The team's won the past three games, so everyone is jovial and loving. The ribbing is gentle, only picking on things that are known to be safe. No mean laughter, even with Draco. For a minute, he wonders how it is possible he is included, at all, let alone treated the same.
Draco looked away.
The cat had been in Draco’s care for only two weeks, but already, she seemed three times larger than she had. She was sweet and attentive, and Draco, in small increments, was seeming lighter. It had taken way too much effort on Harry’s part to get the kitten to Draco in a way that was neither suspicious nor conspicuous, and he now owed at least three first years favours that he would one day have to trade in on. The thirteenth plan had been the one to work, placing the kitten in a cardboard box, leaving it in the owlery in the space reserved for Draco’s preferred school owl, with a note that said ‘Can you give me a new home?’.
did and he did not want to be caught in the crossfire.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, rubbing his eyes and nodding. “Yeah, okay, fine.”
“Show me what happens when you try to cast it.”
Harry smiled against his lips and Draco pulled back to note that Harry—Harry Potter, famed battle survivor—had damp eyes.
“The shop was mother’s property,” Draco said coolly. “It is
“What is it, then?” he asked, the slight hiss behind his words involuntary.
But then Ginny decided she wanted to go grocery shopping. On
to the terrible disco for the next three nights.
“What? Just thought you should know.”
Draco sighed again, unlocked the door and ushered him inside. "Well?" he prompted. "What is it?"
“Come on,” he said slowly. “We met inside, in the fitting area.”
“Sorry to interrupt, but this is Mr Malfoy, and as we are standing in his office, I feel it would be prudent to get him up to speed, don’t you think, Ministers?”

“I can’t believe you would—no, wait, that’s not true. I completely believe you
of him. It’s not good enough. It’s not an apology. It’s not a reason for your trust. It’s just...all I have.”
The rest of the night had been just as wonderful. Hermione hugged Draco as he and Harry left, patting them both on the shoulders. Sure, she was a little drunk, but the meaning behind her words did not change.
Many hours passed before Harry finally stoppered his ink and shovelled the essays back into his bag. “Holy fucking Merlin,” he announced. “They’re done. Draco. Fucking
The commotion was instantaneous the moment he entered the office; he wasn’t sure what had been containing the cacophony of noise, but Draco definitely broke it when he opened the door.
“Definitely not.”
“Here’s the thing,” Potter said, whirling around suddenly and standing in front of him. “At first, I was really angry about the Incident, but whatever. They haven’t been back, and it’s not like I’m unable to take care of myself.”
conducted the investigation. So. What. Are you. Hoping. To find.”
Neville was really quite tired of fall. He had six crates of seeds still to move before the frost and his head was pounding from the hay fever that decided to plague him every year as the leaves began to turn, no matter how many Muggle meds he took or how many potions he tried to create. It was really unfair that the thing he loved most was the thing that made him so miserable for six weeks each year.
Most of the time, when he was having a good month, it felt right; it felt fair and normal and human. He was allowed to worry about paying his rent and whether or not his partner had bought milk on the way home. He was allowed to fantasise about getting a cat without ever really doing it. Draco was allowed to get a bit conceited and spend too much time on his hair. He was human, and he was alive, and he had chosen to survive. Fot that, he would not apologise.
He was out of the room before Draco had even managed to convince himself to open his eyes.
Malfoy smoothed down his hair from where it had been dishevelled in the wind, grinning as he shook his head and came to sit down against the wall as well.
, of all people.”
The kiss is not nearly enough. It is perfect, and uncomplicated, and it doesn't sear him the way he is anticipating. But it is not nearly enough. Draco smiles as Harry pulls away, turns away without even a pause, puts on a shirt and drags on some shorts.
it didn’t exactly end well. But does that mean I have to now ignore him forever? That hardly seems charitable.”
Queue Ron, believing that Harry's restlessness was simply boredom. Leave it to Ron to suggest a conquest, his favourite way of living vicariously through Harry without getting in trouble with his now-wife; from the moment that Harry had admitted that he was less than picky about the gender of those he slept with, Ron had taken it as an opportunity to set him up with as many people as possible.
The music on his ancient Muggle player was turned up loud, making the Bowie album that was on repeat this week sound tinny and even faker than normal, but it was better than endless jingle-bell-heavy versions of Deck the Halls.
“Took a few days. Ran into Bill. He said to stop in.”
“It’s not ‘imagined’. You know that.”
"But it's been
Harry was at a loss for what he was going to do with the day and it was seriously stressing him out. He
The smell of Scotland in late summer hadn’t changed at all. The wind by the water was just starting to have an edge of fall in it, and the breeze cleared his head from the stuffiness of the old stone building. He languorously walked the entire perimeter, heading down towards the Quidditch pitch without even meaning to.
Unfortunately, the wonderful sensation of his dog-hating people in general disappeared entirely when the dog broke free. Draco was always a little terrified of the day he just wouldn’t come back.
There had been the next day, Christmas Eve, naturally, where Harry had called Draco on an infrequently used mobile to come to the Ministry and help them identify Carl. The ingredients of Polyjuice found in his kitchen did enough of the evidence-collecting that Draco decided pressing charges was going to be cruel rather than helpful. He demanded that Carl be given to the Medihealers. It didn’t matter much, at this point. The Compulsion had been completely dispelled; as Draco stood beside Harry and Carl both in the atrium that day, he’d felt none of the confusion, none of the strange tug. He was merely content to let Harry be
Harry sat up too and stared at her for a moment. “Yeah, fine,” he relented. “Why the hell not.”
Draco cocked his head. “Wait, he isn’t? Why not?”

Hermione laughed. “Well,

The day they got it lived in his memory as fresh and as real as all the pain that followed it.
Harry had already pushed himself off the wall and was at a half-jog back into Knockturn. As he had known would be the case, Draco was nowhere on the street.
Harry shrugged. “Not particularly. It’d be nice to have some company, though. I don’t like food shops.”
She laughed at him meanly. “Whatever, darling. Keep telling yourself that.”
wizards in the end."
Malfoy laughed bitterly. "
“What are you on about, Malfoy? We all know that your ‘experience’ in the forest is hardly innocent.”
Theo’s money had come through first. A loophole in the Reparations law, a regulation that allowed him an allowance per year because he was the last living Nott. He’d found them the dingey flat and moved them in immediately. Having learned better than to trust any ounce of fortune, neither had left their Muggle jobs. They were content, comfortable.
"Okay, so let's just think about this rationally. What do we need?"
Neither of them much noticed.
“Oh, god. Harry, what did you do?”
He knew Draco was trying and he really wanted to let it go, to go out for dinner and forget the slight bump in the road. But hearing Draco say they weren’t okay set him off. For the first time in months, he felt like they
“Sure,” Neville replied with a shrug, his tone clearly stating that he was waiting for the point.
“Hey,” she said defensively. “You aren’t angry at
to explain it. I’m so, so—”
“Just for a little while, you big baby,” she replied, her voice catching just a tiny bit. “I feel a lot better about doing it now that you’re going to just get over yourself and go get Harry Potter into your bed.” She pulled back and arched her brow. “Right?”
Harry had laughed, and Ron seemed relieved. He realised with a start that six months ago, he likely would have snapped at Ron for a comment like that, and then gone into a sullen retreat for days.
“Not hate,” she insisted with a pointed stare. “Anger. Fear. Projections.”
"This is a new day. The day gave us this," he muttered.
“Sitting by the lake with Pansy and Blaise. Studying for finals in third year. That was such an easy year.”
When he came back to the main room, where the tables were still set up for the Hufflepuff and Slytherin second years, he found Draco Malfoy sitting on the first row of desks, nonchalant and kicking his bloody legs. He looked like a pale, put-together toddler. A small child, that is, if Neville were capable of ignoring the casual ease of his sexiness; he totally understood the appeal Harry found there, though there were still many moments when Neville’s brain short-circuited in trying to work out how that much forgiveness had been found even in
With Carl, he’d flirted so intensely that he’d felt sick. He left the bank with his number, and the attraction had been so mutual that he’d seen him that night. A week later, Carl had convinced him to leave his fiance. A week after that, he was summoning Hermione to the outside of the hall and announcing to her that there would be no wedding.
Pansy looked at him long and hard before she laughed. "Well, my love. That is definitely worth having a panic attack over.”
Harry clung tighter in response, nuzzling into Draco more, gripping him tight. “Relax. I’m going to hold you and keep you warm. You can worry about those things in the morning when you forget how safe you feel right now. Merlin, Malfoy. Why are you always so bloody freezing.”
“I had a funeral, Draco. We had a

. He hated the shops on Saturdays with very good reason. Ginny, as usual, had refused his refusal. She had talked him into coming through the strategic use of pointed glares over actual words. In another time, he'd have risked being punched for the chance to tell her how much she looked like her mother at that moment.
Bill’s small office was cosy and warm and contained a miniature version of the tree from the lobby.
Diego sighed a jovial sigh, stage whispering to Draco, “Seems it’s my turn a lot.” Still, he got the bucket from the mop closet, made them all laugh by saluting, and headed to the back. Draco continued to pack up as Harry flew around the cafe, expertly inverting chairs and pulling out a broom.
"Right. Okay. So not yet,” Ginny conceded with a small smile. “Well, fine, but I'm not going to sit around and watch you become some sort of strung out potion addict because you’re sad about a boy. You'd never allow it of
“Audrey,” Abe called from the side room. “Have you seen the box of oboe reeds that came in on Wednesday?”
“A Compulsion,” Harry deadpanned, not exactly disbelieving but looking for all the world like he wanted to slap Draco square in the face. Draco understood. He simply nodded. “Okay, fine. So a Compulsion. What does that have to do with the bank?”
it had been longer than he’d intended. Mostly, because the darkness was lifting, only slightly. He was waking up. He tried hard not to let his awareness shift too far toward the light. If he woke up before Harry had found him, he’d die of dehydration before anyone even heard him.
“The police?” Ginny interjected, stopping Harry with a hand on his arm. “Ginny, don’t. We’re going inside.”
He stormed off before Harry had the chance to respond; for no reason that he could understand, Harry’s heart swelled.
Draco’s face was both the picture of shock Harry had been anticipating, and yet something...more.
“Er, hey,” Harry replied.
“Mr Potter around?” he replied carefully.
“You can be mad at me in the morning,” Harry whispered, attaching himself to Draco’s neck. “But for now, admit how happy you are that I’m going to be in your bed all night long. I won’t disappear because you made me.”
Malfoy’s smile disappeared, replaced with a wary stare that was far more familiar and therefore, felt far safer as well. He shook his head tersely.
“Be in Scotland?” Harry finished for him, a small grin working it’s way up to his face. “Yeah, took a few days off to come home and take care of Rose. Wanted Ron and Hermione to get a few days away before the holidays.”
“So wise. So brilliant,” Draco mocked with a chuckle. “Tomorrow, though. We have to hike down, right? I need to get some sleep if I’m going to wake up again."
“Except he’s supposed to be putting a new spin on them,” Diego quipped helpfully.
“I’ll most likely be fine,” he said in an unconvincingly chipper voice, still careening around corners as quickly as he could without drawing attention. When Draco
From across the room was a disgustingly common phrase.
“Why do I feel like you’re mad at me?” Harry asked. Draco didn’t reply. “Listen, I just…you asked me if I was sure, before. About never having time to quit?”
For two months, it all worked quite well.
“Pansy,” he warned.
“Once or twice, I’ve managed the...the silver sparks. But it’s never enough to do anything with.”

to have our assistant manager with you?”
Instead, he started slipping potions again. Just sometimes, and just sips. It just seemed easier to face everything, if he was just slightly less present. He loved the idea of Draco being there all the time, and he was annoyed that Draco clearly did not feel the same way.
“Good,” Draco answered quietly, taking it from him.
“Right. Breath. Okay.”
“So, where is he?” she asked excitedly.
He just hadn’t considered what it meant to let people from work see him in it.
“Maybe not quite that long.”
“Long story,” Harry muttered.
Which would have been great had he had a
The line was already snaking around the corner by the time Harry got there. He hopped up and down on his black pumps, trying to stay warm. A few people wolf-whistled, a couple complimented his legs. The corset was his show stopper and it was hidden. He stayed calm as he waited. It was 25 minutes before a very small looking Draco Malfoy traipsed by.
It’s basic logistics and legal procedure, Father. I don’t understand your question.”
“And furthermore,” Harry said, his voice reaching a whole new level of volume that sent a shiver down Draco’s spine. “That the Ministry has been
“Stop doing what?” Draco replied innocently.
“Or that you were going to be expected to approach all lessons without prejudice or personal judgement?” The tone of warning she was now using was unmistakable.
afraid. Something deep down in his core told him that he was in grave danger. Serious trouble. He didn’t feel like that often. Before he’d been kicked out, every report from the agency had included the phrase "reckless to the point of stupidity" and "ignorant of limitations, even in regards to personal safety”.
“We need to go over the plans one more time,” Travers declared as Draco approached. He nodded over Draco’s shoulder. “Has he suspected anything?”

“That. And the other things,” Harry conceded, bracing for the rancour.

looked put together enough for the package delivery he was sure was behind the door.
“Well, I am,” Harry said firmly. “I was. I was never ready.”
"Yes Draco, I remember. False bottoms. Please, go for it. Explain to me, what on earth do you need those for?”
And so, while things were going well most of the time, they argued quite frequently. And as they continued to fight, Harry felt himself pulling back again. He was back in the field on a trial basis, and Draco did not like it. The fight that stuck in Harry's mind, the one that was the beginning of the end, had happened in early September.
Last chance. Not buying a rando coffee again if you’re going to be an ass.
“Professor, I—”
Harry groaned. “Do I have to tell him tonight?”
“I—” Carl began. He apparently didn’t know what he had been about to say, though, because he stopped speaking and stared at Draco instead.

appealing charcuterie board Draco had ever seen.
Since it was Pansy and Theo’s turn to host, Draco’s traditional Orphan’s Christmas quickly turned into a shit show; unsurprisingly, he also ended up the most drunk. The past four months of being reserved and polite finally exploded out of him in the rather cliched form of many, many shots of tequila. He woke up the next day with glitter in his hair and paint on his cheeks, and no memory as to why. According to Pansy, they were the result of him insisting that they decorate him like a Christmas tree and the efforts of Blaise’s drunken Charm work. He took a two-hour bath and still found glitter in various places for the next three days.
“Hermione, I refuse to let you feel guilty for this,” he insisted. “Honest question, though...do you think I have any hope of him forgiving me?”
Draco was glaring now. He didn’t love this summary of what Potter thought of him if he was honest.
Owen stood, defiant. Nodded.
"Carl?" he called out the second he pushed the door open. If he was going to deal with his current 'flatmate', he certainly didn't want to be surprised by the interaction.

She raised an eyebrow. “Fun.”
They were six months out of Auror training. Babies. Brand new and way too fresh in the field. To save them from themselves, they had not been given anything more taxing than Secrecy Act infractions since leaving day, and the job was quickly proving almost boring; sitting in an on-call room, shooting the shit and drinking way too much coffee with their fellow first-year officers. At twenty-three, it probably should have been fun, but instead, it was driving Harry mental.
Seamus laughed. “True love.”
“Harry, this is a disaster. I don’t think you understand how much I am hating everything right now.”
The surface was very tidy. That wasn’t surprising. Draco’s workspace was always meticulous, even at the Ministry, where new files were hitting his Unspeakables office every other minute. There was a clear file system, and anyone who chose not to follow it earned the wrath of the pernickety Lifelong Slytherin.
“Why are  you here, Harry?”
"Oh Merlin," Blaise groaned, sitting up to accept his package. "You've procreated, haven't you."
“Okay,” Draco said slowly, putting down his fork from the breakfast he’d forced Harry to have in the room. “So, you kissed him. Right before his wedding. And he didn’t take that well? No offence, but letting that turn into a five-year grudge makes you sound a little bit like my father.”
Harry tried to pull back like he’d been shot.
?” he sneered, to no effect. He had to admit that his cold, austere sneers were somewhat lacking these days. Something about the grey lighting, the uniform, his limp, unkempt hair.
"I don't know."
“I really hate both of you, you know.”
“Don’t you dare apologise,” she hissed. “For the first time ever, I am fully confident that this is not your fault. Merlin. How far we’ve come, Draco Malfoy?”
The long and the short of it is, when you finally find your soulmate; when Christmas is around the corner; when the lights are twinkling in everyone’s eye, forgiveness and forgetfulness in abundance. When these stars all align, there is little one can do to stop the force of time.
“No one else will work with him,” she’d said with a sneer showing her disapproval.
“He should be. I’m terrifying.”
“Sorry, Professor Potter?” Malfoy asked, a hint of annoyance just touching the edge of his gentle hum.
“You...
It was a few more weeks of silent neutrality, shared meals, and genial company before Harry started actually thinking of Malfoy as
The trek up the stairs felt charged and heavy. He did
Draco’s expression must have been hard enough for Travers to get his answer. He held up his hands in surrender and offered a file to him at the same time.
Harry reached up and took Neville’s hand from his mouth. He didn’t speak, kissed the back of the hand that had stopped him instead. Suddenly, there was a workbench behind his back that Harry was hoisting himself up onto. Suddenly, he was grasping at hair and pulling at a shirt that he managed to remove. Neville was dragging Harry’s chest into his own and shoving hands down the back of his trousers, and all the while, their mouths remained silently attached.
telling
Hesitation lingered in Harry for a moment longer before he finally seemed to just…let go.
A cheap version of a hammer in your hands
He consulted the list on the wall, the one that Hermione had affixed there. It was identical to the ones she’d put in all the other rooms. Organisation and a plan of action. He was already closer to actually getting this done that he had been the past five times. The first three, he’d frozen at the smell. The last two, he’d gotten stuck halfway through taping up the boxes because the old grandfather clock in the corner had chimed. He’d since sent Ron in to charm the clock motionless until Lucius could come to pick it up.
Still, the sacrifice had bought him an hour with the Mage. He cursed the day he’d changed his will, a petty and shortsighted act made on the day that Draco had informed his parents that he refused to get married and would not have a child, even if his life depended on it. That day, Lucius had the papers drawn up, making it impossible for Draco to inherit anything without a legal spouse; the gender did not matter all that much in the end. He had hoped that informing Draco would force the issue, but he’d been arrested before he could undo what he had done.
“Why?” Draco whispered, the sound barely audible.
“I have none,” he admitted.
Draco had come as Rocky. Harry hadn’t found his jaw or tongue since that had been revealed. There had always been a chance, technically, what with the blonde hair. But everything about Draco screamed buttoned-up prude, and Harry hadn’t even dared think about it.
"Bet you're like that, aren't you, Potter?” Draco said, squinting appraisingly.
"I thought we were passed this," Draco muttered to no one in particular.
“Team ready for this week?” he asked quietly.
Harry burst into a short trip of laughter that forced Draco to look up.
The boxes were piled in the centre of the room, where they’d been since they’d been delivered by the moving company. There were no case files, which was comforting. They’d been picked up by a young, blonde witch with a natural air of authority who would have been Harry’s type in a former lifetime.
The last thing he remembered of that night was the feeling of utter failure. He just wanted to sleep, pretend he had answers. He was going to deal with it tomorrow. He was going to get up and try harder in the morning. He was going to get up and love Draco better. Be a better Auror. Find a way to matter again. As he pulled the cork from the bottle, that is all he was thinking; that he just needed to sleep, and that tomorrow, he would do better.
“Happy Christmas,” Draco breathed as he stepped forward into Harry’s gaze. Harry forced himself to blink.
,” Harry repeated. “No. I just want...I want my old life back. So I’m going to take it. Draco and I are just—we’re just acquaintances.”
“Bloody hypocrite,” Draco said, looking down at Barkley who was yipping at his feet and spinning in a circle to go out. “Tells me not to get obsessed, but you fucking
Of course, this place wasn’t like that at all, and he hated that he didn’t hate it even slightly. The chairs were comfortable, but not at all trendy. The tables were the ideal height, and his little back corner was bright from the patio doors. The music was always an eclectic and bizarrely catchy mix; sometimes, it was old rock, sometimes it was a heart-wrenching, soul-blues. The pastries came from a bakery uptown that had always made a delicious blueberry scone. Draco’s Americano was always rich and dark, and the perfect temperature. Normally, he could happily spread out for hours on end, barely taking in his surroundings, drinking way too much caffeine because Deigo kept putting new cups in front of him while he was fully focused on his sketch.
uncharacteristic tardiness. I told Erica that you had a personal emergency but would only be twenty minutes late. She seemed fine with that. That was only five minutes ago, so if you duck out the shipping doors now, you can run to the pound shop on the corner, get antlers, and be back before she even notices.”
“Harry,” Draco announced, shocked. “Did you forget something?”
"No, seriously. It is. He found my Muggle account again."
don’t care, but...well, I don’t have an end to that sentence but most of these were woven before Godric was even in nappies and honestly you
Draco’s mouth fell open as his eyes landed on an elegant, older, and thoroughly delighted looking, Pansy Parkinson. His gaze flicked first to Diego, then to Harry, as he tried to calculate his move. Even as he did, Harry had subtly shifted to stand in front of Diego; ever the saviour. At this moment, Draco was endlessly thankful. Behind Pansy, Theodore Nott stood stoically, looking bored as he studied the random posters on the walls.
Unsure what was happening, Neville nodded. Draco took one last step, firmly into Neville’s personal space, and gently laid his hands on either side of Neville’s face. He pressed his forefinger into the backs of Neville’s ears, his thumbs rubbing firm circles along his cheeks. Instantly, the pressure receded and Neville relaxed into the massage without even realising. For a few moments, Draco just released the tension in his face.
, he told himself.
Then, he’d just never really stopped following Draco. At first, it had been infuriating; Draco didn’t trust people easily and he hated being treated like he was broken. The ridiculous man hadn’t given up though; Diego didn’t argue, didn’t fight back. He never questioned Draco’s choices or forced him to do anything. This unwavering bolstering had been exactly what he’d needed. Someone to just let him make his own decisions, not try and coerce him in any way. Fury had drifted into tolerance, and tolerance had become affection. Affection, as it is wont to do, became love.
“Forgot how much I hate you,” Draco whispered fondly, his cheeks getting a little brighter as he watched Harry smoosh his face into the face of his very picky dog.
"I'll give you 30 seconds to retract that last question," he scowled, holding out his hand. "I need your extra antlers, Mandy."
“Great,” he said sarcastically. “Can’t wait.”
Let me soothe it, ease it to a grave made of soft kisses and apology.
“I think it’s time for you to go,” Diego said, iron in his voice. Pansy laughed and pulled her arm from his grasp.
“For a little bit. But is that worth giving up what is being offered? A second and third attempt, a chance to just be happy?”
“That’s a very fancy coffee thingy,” Harry remarked, seeming to have decided to just ignore the bizarre coincidence they’d just discovered. Draco decided he could pretend, too. Clearly, this wasn’t a thing they were talking about right now.
reckless.”
Potter actually laughed, a short, cryptic sound. “No fucking kidding,” he returned.
As the sun set, the moon rose; Harry was grateful for the clear skies as the stars emerged. His warm jumper and the blanket he had wrapped around his shoulders made the ground comfortable and inviting. The constellations were easy to make out in the clear mountain air. He’d missed being outside. He’d needed the break after the field, but he made a deal with himself as he stared up at the darkening sky to try and get back to exploring.
Draco could let Harry labour under the assumption that he was thinking those things, though, because it bought him some time to process his actual current thought. The one that was simply screaming, over and over, about how Harry's scent was something like leather and broom wax and…honeysuckle? And that he may not survive unless he discovered why.
Harry sat in his usual fog, only occasionally nodding and making sounds of agreement as he let Draco speak for him. The ancient healer listened to his chest, shook his head, and then sat back down.
He tried to walk away, but Barkley had other plans. He sat down and stared up at Draco expectantly.
“I offered him a job,” Draco announced suddenly.
By the time Draco finally coerced himself out of bed and into clothing after Harry's annoyingly endearing departure, the elves had been and gone, leaving the usual ominous tray of breakfast with a side of guilt-tripping on the desk. The basket of pastries only contained a sensible assortment of healthy muffins, which reminded him that he was facing a very long day full of stakeholder meetings and board overseeing. The daily schedule that sat beneath his coffee mug confirmed the muffin prophecy and he sighed a weary sigh as he settled in.
She scowled at him and punched his arm. “Fine. But tell someone if you’re not fine. Okay?”
“So there is no way, in any world, where you are going to come back and suddenly be my partner again in the Auror department.”
“The seating chart is in the cloakroom?” Harry asked, confused. Draco nodded noncommittally as they entered the room.
"My notes," Harry replied automatically. "And space. And…I dunno, someplace old. Old bricks. Or stone. Those would be best."
Now, the three of them walked unhindered down the cobbled street until the reached the familiar striped awning of the robe shop. Harry paused and took a deep breath, studying the elaborate display. He pulled the black box from his rucksack, opened the lid, and gazed inside with bated breath. He wasn’t waiting for something to happen.
Draco finishes the book on a Tuesday night, a glass of scotch in his hand. It's the third, or possibly fourth. He doesn't care that he is drunk, even though that is why the quote breaks him in half.
“Harry, mate, you know you’re my best friend and all, but I think we need to draw the line at kinky—”
“Report?” Draco interjected, alarmed. “Ron, I’m not
It had all started as a not-very-funny joke. The pamphlets had all arrived on the same day, flooding down at breakfast from the morning owls like brightly coloured confetti. They’d made everyone laugh at the absurdity of the message. Yet, like some sort of creeping infectious trend, the surveys slowly crept in. There was no telling who had started it, who sent the survey back first, but once it had started it was hard to stop. Soon, the Professor’s promised pairings became an unstoppable fad. It made sense when you thought about it. No one
“I’m sorry, by the way… about,” Draco waved his hands noncommittally.
“Harry, are you alright? Do you need someone to come get you?”
“Malfoy…Draco,” he started.
"Draco," he laughed, "relax. I didn't know it was you. Ron just said I was on the couch, nothing more. Need a pillow."
“Is there...can I help?”
For a moment, neither of them spoke; frozen in the moment, both processing.
Harry nodded noncommittally, but he
“You rarely see even one star in the city. And when you do, it’s because it’s so bloody hot that you can barely breathe.” He sat up, pulling his knees up to his chest; Hermione was lying in her bright yellow fuzzy housecoat.
They had gone for drinks in Muggle London, at Harry's insistence. He still got recognized most wizarding places, and he wasn't interested in an autograph-filled evening. Surprisingly, Malfoy looked slightly sympathetic when he had explained this, agreeing almost right away to the change in location.
Amanda cleared her throat angrily, taking a step down from the ladder to glare at Erica. Draco shot her a begging, pleading sort of look that she of course ignored.
Draco paused here, but Harry didn't think it was for impact. It was like Draco needed a moment to recommit to his speech, collect himself. He gave a small nod.
Harry smiled and reached beneath the cushion. He dropped the box in Draco’s lap and smiled when Draco arched an annoyed eyebrow.
The whirlwind of moving to the school, starting his first full year of teaching and coaching, the baby and the fanfare of his new life had dulled the pain somewhat, but seeing Draco amongst all that tinsel, framed in the light of a mid-morning sunny day, had brought it all back to the surface. Everything felt unfinished, out of his control; he'd had to fight so hard to convince Draco to stay the first time, to have everyone understand why Harry Potter wanted Draco Malfoy. He hadn't even considered that he might have to continue fighting.
Potter burst into a light, shocked laugh that made Draco grin. “I guess there’s no time like the present. After you,
“I love him.”
“Relax, Harry,” Malfoy said. “I’m only teasing." Malfoy's smile broadened. "Now that I'm thinking about it, I wonder how often you hated me because you just didn’t get my terribly dry wit?”
“Well, get over it. Now, Carl, the one listed in your reports. He’s the one from the car in the summer, right?”
hadn’t finally decided to grow a pair.”
“No,” Draco admitted, letting go of Theo. “I don’t.”
The conversation floated around him, dull and so scripted that he could interact and seem like he was participating, while his entire mind was actually on the ticking of the clock that was bringing him closer and closer to his ridiculous decision.
"You know what, though? You owe me an explanation to. I know what you said, but you owe me the story as much as you owe it to him. We were just about to have tea. Boots off. Cost there. Let's go."
“It’s been two years, Dray,” Diego went on. “Two years of not knowing about this giant gap in who you are. Those people today... they were not fucking around,” he inhaled sharply, looking away. “I think that girl could have broken me in half. So, I think I need to know now?"
“Parkinson, whatever you want, why don’t we just step outside? These people did nothing wrong,” Harry said coolly.
tried to have you fired.”
How could he have been so stupid as to believe that they didn’t know where he was? That they hadn’t been watching? That they didn’t know where he lived, and what he did, and… and
He hung up before his father could get in the last word and pulled a small black ledger from its hiding place in the false front of his desk and flipped it open to the fourth page.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Harry asked, annoyance colouring his tone.
He stepped forward, took Neville’s hand in his own, pulled him off to the side of the walkway. He pressed them both into the wall, took the chance afforded to him by Neville’s furtive glance around to the crowds nearby. He pressed his lips to Neville’s, carefully. Gently. He waited to be pushed away. Instead, he was drawn closer, a free hand weaving into his hair, a clasped one gripping desperately.
"Go out with me," Harry replied in a less than dignified rush.
“Maybe,” Draco nodded.
"Strangers?” Harry replied, freezing in the entryway and glaring at Draco. “D. Come on. I'm sorry. I'm home
Diego was looking between Pansy and Draco, and he could tell that Diego did not like what he found. He had that pinched,
Draco was going to have some very strong urges if he ever found him. Urges of the injurious type.
Potter jolted but then lifted his shoulders in a shrug. "Was waiting for you to pick your room. The specs suggest one is slightly bigger."
Draco pulled down the paper on the large box he'd been handed and found his own very fancy muggle coffee machine.

“Dear Merlin. You’re right," he teased. "We need to sell that place immediately. The last thing it needs is haunting.”

Determined eye-closure when one had spent the day in mountain air eventually won and Harry must have fallen asleep despite his confusion. He knew this because a moment later, he was sharply awoken. Again.
“That was the last one,” he explained, holding up the net.
The words — the first Draco had ever spoken to him — leapt unbidden to his mind. How did he remember that? He was not the sort to remember trivial details or sentimentalities. The boy that had said those words had disappeared long before Draco had ever even entered his life fully. And yet, here they were, as clear as though Draco was standing here.

“All I did was kiss him,” Harry responded miserably.

“See? This is what I’m always saying to you and Theo. Hopeless romantics.”
He was rewarded for his perseverance.
When he scrubbed his face and his feet hit the floor, Draco turned his face away before he saw the muscles in Harry’s back and arms hoist him out of the high bed and out of Draco’s day. He listened as Harry riffled around on the floor and found his clothes, closed his eyes tight against the hurt, and hauled the covers up around him to push out the chill of the suddenly too-big bed.
“We most certainly are
“What do you mean I could just move on and ignore him?” he said as the phone rang.
"Oh my God!" she declared. "Are you
Harry, who had been wandering about the new room, examining various objects around him and exploring the bookshelves, snapped his gaze back to Draco. “Yes?” he confirmed.
above all else. The small, squat representative that arrived on his appointed day did not garner Lucius’ confidence and he had taken to repeating everything the man told him.
The flyer was graceful and precise, skilled with their turns and fast. Clearly they were an experienced player. Harry was puzzled since something about the way the person before him adjusted themselves at every throw was very familiar and disquieting. When the Quaffle went a bit wide, Harry suddenly realised why.
“I’m Harry,” he offered, for no apparent reason, extending his hand. The man smiled in return.

Harry shrugged. “Took the day in protest. They don’t fire my partner without telling me and get away with it. I brought food. Fired food.”
Draco nodded.
mouth to ask if Draco was okay.
“Scotland.”
Harry was back from a case, an easy one, but one that had taken him away from the house for 48 hours. He had come home excited to be there, a new feeling that he had missed. But Draco had been in a foul mood, a bad day, combined with bad weather making him grumpy and despondent. All Harry managed to say was 'hi' before Draco pounced.
Harry believed that, at some point, he’d stop being aware of how much time it had been. That being said, upon waking up for the two hundred and twenty-sixth time since an Auror had stood at his door and told him Draco Malfoy was dead, he knew it wasn’t going to be today.
laugh, and Poppy flashed him a wink and a smile that immediately endeared her to him. She offered both her arms.
“I...not second thoughts, nothing that...dramatic. I just. Harry, do you think I’m making a mistake?”
They walked in companionable silence, Barkley happily trotting between the two umbrellas, getting interminably wet. Harry couldn’t be certain, but it appeared that the sturdy dog was grinning up at them, looking back and forth between them and then pulling them along faster. They marched up to a small cafe with an awning that eerily matched Malfoy’s umbrella.
Potter laughed. "Is it ridiculous that I'm bloody tired? I'm going to take a nap. Tell me if anyone tries to murder us in the next forty minutes."
The ‘Mooncalf-icorn’, as Potter insisted on calling it, was a big hit, and the publisher had decided Draco would be the illustrator for the entire series, a simpering and inane group of board books about magical creatures. Every time he brought it up, Harry would burst into uncontrollable laughter, and eventually drag Draco down with him. It was hard not to laugh at the Muggle idea of what constituted a ‘
out?” Draco exclaimed, slightly shocked by such an easy admission of failure from the Chosen One.
“He hates Halloween,” explained Diego, sauntering in from the storage cupboard carrying a box of napkins. “He’s grumpy for like a week beforehand. I don’t know why Harry here is so crusty, but if you could kindly both fuck off, I’d appreciate it immensely. You are bringing the whole place down. You hand those sketches in?”
“What? That business with Hagrid?”
“Anything I can do to help?”
"Harry is right,” he decided. “We're talking in circles. Let's break now and reconvene tomorrow instead. In the meantime… Andrew, can you see if you can get that paperwork filed? And Draco, I trust you are still looking into the appointment of a new liaison?"
Five minutes passed before a zipper screech dipped into the heady silence all around him, and a blanket was proffered peacefully. Draco took it, a sickening orange plaid thing that could
Harry sighed. “Why would I care about that, Pansy. I don't even know him.”
gone all funny,” she defended.
Setting a timer and picking up his own mug, Ron sat heavily across from Draco and reached behind to a drawer, pulling out a pad of paper and a pen.
But unfortunately, when it happened, Draco was wholly unprepared for how complicated and perfect it actually was to fall in love with the man across the room.
fine?”
Harry stared at him for a moment; he wondered if Ron was currently paying enough attention to notice the shift in the tension in the room. Possibly. Probably. Still, he just stared at Draco instead.
“There
“Well… I mean… wait, what is this?”
Was he
“Look. I won’t seek you out,” Harry allowed. “But I’m not going to stay silent while you… do your little act.”
Draco stared at Harry and stayed silent. He agreed, but he didn’t trust himself to say so. His throat was dry, the hair on the back of his neck was prickling, and he was sure if he opened his mouth, all of his emotions were going to tumble out and all over Potter. When Harry stuck out his hand, however, he smiled and took it firmly; Draco let his palm linger, warm and dry, holding against Harry, whose fingers were chilled from many hours of writing. He let himself grip a little tighter, let his elbow fall to the desktop, moved his thumb just enough to feel the back of Harry’s hand beneath the pad. Before it could get awkward, he forced himself to let go.
“Something wrong?” Draco asked cautiously. He wasn’t sure that their relationship warranted this, personal details, check-ins. Jovial banter over lunch was hardly friendship. Still, he felt like he needed to ask. Potter shrugged again and turned to face him.
"Hey, babe,” he replied. “What's shakin'?"
The Time Warp brought Draco back to reality. He laughed the entire time he did the ridiculous dance. He hadn’t been so happy in a long, long time. This place was electric, addictive. Everyone knew the rules, everyone knew the steps. No one cared who you were or who your father was. No one was questioning whether or not you were throwing your life away, or if you should be further along since you were technically an adult with Responsibilities. All they cared about was if you remembered to call Janet a slut and if you were having fun.
you. Let’s just get off the street. Now.”
“Lou,” Harry said, leaning forward to rest his head on his bent knees. “Lou, there are just so,
Deep down, in his stomach, chest, groin, his body demanded the return of the phrase he explained to Hermione now.
“I mean, sure, but you really don’t need to worry about that. I know that you have Sirius’ all sorted, and yours is in trust since after the war. Do you need to make a change?”
“Best Christmas present you could give anyone this year is by sorting out this mess as soon as possible. It has been a miserable few seasons.”
He had an itch in the back of his throat, and he had felt all day like someone was watching him. He was annoyed and on edge when he stalked into the coffee shop looking for Diego.
Harry stood up too, brushing himself off and shaking his hair to release some of the grass that had settled there. When he stopped, Draco was surveying him closely.

“You don’t.”
When will you see me standing here?
This is a short chapter. The next one will not be. We are in the ending, for a while sure, but the end is in sight.

Ginny snorted meanly. "Well, that is truly the stupidest thing I have ever heard you say. I have known you how long? Don't you think that if this depression, this anxiety, were actually 'you', we'd have told you by now?”
. Or the kitten.” Harry let pain and anger hit his tone and it snapped Draco’s eyes back to his.
“I…” Potter hesitated and inhaled sharply. He pushed an unruly fluff of hair out of his face and then his whole body seemed to collapse into itself. “I’m sorry, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I just feel so discombobulated. Which is ludicrous. We’re
"Nothing," Harry shrugged. "Forgot."
Before he worked out what side of this internal battle he was going to land on, Draco had reached out, taken Harry’s hand, and pulled him close, until their chests were flush and their height difference unimportant.
“No,” Draco breathed. “The most complicated reason is that I’m here because you and I…”
“Hi, Hare!” Pansy called, rushing down from the second floor of the old Victorian. She was in her stocking feet, but her coat was on and a scarf was slung around her neck.
Since he had no plans to continue surviving, Draco had thrown himself into a dangerous and reckless lifestyle. He went to the club every night that week, drinking until he was close to blacking out, then taking home the first thing he found. Diego, however, had refused to leave him alone the night he’d found him in the bathroom, passed out on the floor. He kept trailing around after Draco, shoving water in his hands until Draco had given up and gone home. Diego had followed him home, and slept on the couch the entire night.
Draco, for the first time in ages, did not have a comeback. His hands fell to his sides and he stared at the floor. Harry took the opportunity to step forward, into Draco’s office, reaching out to hold open the door from behind where he stood.
Dramatic.”
the second they walked off the stage holding their certificates.
“Okay, well, let me know if there’s anything I can help you with. You’re my first customer today. Which, let me tell you, is pretty hilarious, all things considered.” The man chuckled and Harry stared at him. He failed to see how having no business at all was funny.
Draco had laughed, unintentionally, then. “Well, sure, but I’m pretty sure that the people involved don’t really give a shit about legality.”
Draco noticed everything in the long silence. He heard the bell on the door in stereo, felt the air from the vent above his head, and felt his face heat. Draco knew that Potter had taken a breath he hadn’t let out and that Diego was beaming his
“None of your business,” Draco clipped, his crisp RP accent coming through more pronounced than usual and his tone cold and detached. “I could very well ask you the same thing,
A year sped by him; for the anniversary of their first date, Harry surprised Draco with a trip to Spain, where they had eaten their weight in spicy, sultry food, frolicked for hours on white sand beaches, and fucked like teenagers for the better part of the too-hot afternoons. That particular break from reality was incredible; Harry slept soundly for the entire week and his heart swelled at the lightness in Draco's face, which had been missing for months.
from the side of the circle silenced them, though they continued to glare at each other, hands hovering over wand pockets and daggers in their eyes.
“Well, Malfoy,” he hummed. “You’re done.”
Draco backed out of the office before he could do anything else and walked himself straight into the floo to Dr Stenhouse’s office.
Harry strolled out of the lab grinning. It wasn’t until he was halfway back to the emergency ward that he realised how badly he’d fucked up.
The mornings were the hardest part. Returning to the world where Draco wasn’t allowed to acknowledge that he was hurting. The place beyond the deep grey of his bed-curtains was currently his least favourite of all the places he visited. Especially when the curtains were like this.
He’d been trying for months to shove aside the niggling feeling, and when he was in a good mood, it wasn’t that hard. When he wasn’t – which, frankly, was pretty often – the fact that everything about his life had become very predictable was impossible to ignore. And he was starting to find the predictability...difficult.
"Mr Malfoy,” he said casually as he got closer.
“But Harry,” Ginny went on. “I have been patiently waiting here for you to finish this story because I wanted to know. I wanted to understand what went wrong. What he’d done to you.”
Pansy. Well, okay. I don’t know this one for sure. But I’m pretty sure its Carl this time. Using Polyjuice. I think he has my hairbrush.”
"Come on, one date,” Harry insisted. “I'd like to hear about your work…what you've been up to. All that. You don't talk to me as it is, so there's nothing to ruin if it's awful. We can go back to politely ignoring each other."
This is pointless.”
“It’s morning. You have to go.”
“What about the curse?”
Harry grumbled and shoved a chip in his mouth. Both Seamus and Dean stared at him expectantly.
Harry, he was sure, hesitated for the barest fraction of a second before he disappeared into the darkened corridor and shut the door behind him.
It was strange, actually getting to know Malfoy, but in a good way. In the best way. Harry felt oddly lighter every time they met and he watched Malfoy react same way; with slight, infinitesimally small changes in how reserved he was around Harry. Far from refusing to look Harry in the eye, he now regularly spoke to him at work, even in front of other people. He would go out of his way to ask for an opinion on cases or shoot the shit in the break room. It wasn’t long before other people noticed too. They started leaving a space open for Draco at the table, asked him questions unprompted. The whole Auror department took in Draco Malfoy without batting an eye.
, obviously.” Pansy leaned backwards next to him and stayed quiet. “Shut up, Pans.”
them to mean, but how did he translate that into action? Did Potter seriously believe that he was going to just show up on a whim of a Wednesday morning and help him with the crossword puzzle over coffee? Like they’d been married for a decade?
Harry and Ron had quickly disappeared into the house, Hermione remaining at his side until Arthur came and took Rose from her arms. She squeezed his hand gently and smiled sadly before she, too, left him in the entryway.
“You aren’t coming in,” she said flatly the second she picked up.
Finally, as the whole staff stood listening to Professor Grubbly-Plank babble on about how to protect the forest from the students and the students from the forest, Harry snapped. They were standing at the edge of the pumpkin patch, gazing into the dark foliage, when Malfoy cleared his throat and raised a meek hand that halted the conversation.
Harry and Draco glanced at each other, sadness and guilt echoed in both their faces. Pansy didn’t miss it and sighed heavily.
“We’ll go shopping tomorrow after you’ve had some rest,” Pansy said, patting him on the shoulder. “We’re taking the van down to the place with this run. I’ll stop for lunch on the way back. Want soup?”
“Yes, I remember,” Draco smirked.
“It’s not like I would know the difference,” Potter laughed.
therapist,” he said, unable to contain his manic laughing any longer.
Ron sighed and stood up. “Okay, enough, Malfoy,” he complained. “Here’s what you’re going to do. He likes the museum. The big Muggle one, in the city.. It’s a bit ridiculous, actually. He looks like a little kid. Just ask him out. It’s Friday. You can handle this.”
that he was thinking about the possibility that he and Potter's magical signatures had just attuned, meaning that the historical implications of his research may be accurate. He also hadn't hinted that Harry's secondary argument that dark magic bonded more permanently to ruins and surfaces than its counterparts felt closer than ever to true.
When the piece came out, he winced at the photo. He supposed he was looking healthier—if a bit paler than normal; he had, after all, been running endlessly to try and keep the anxiety at bay. As promised, eating and sleeping had made him look less corpse-like. But there was something etched on his face that he hadn't realised had crept in. He didn't dislike the lines on his face or the darkness under his eyes. They were now from hard work rather than self-inflicted torture, but they shocked him nonetheless. There was a deep, dark part of him that knew why. He hadn’t ever really thought about what he would look like getting older.
September had been a hard month. They’d all gotten back to school in a scattered trickle rather than their usual mob. There were no thestral drawn carriages to bring them up to the ruined bridge, no boats to ferry them across the rubble in the centre of the lake. The other years had all arrived on the first and classes were in full swing—sort of. ‘Full swing’ also included mandatory rebuild hours, older students using newly minted spells to help return bricks to former locations. A constantly rotating string of ministry employees arrived every day to fortify walls and reapply charms. While most students weren’t actually expected to rebuild, the eighth years all seemed to collectively scoff at McGonnagall’s insistence and made themselves useful on the grounds. The other professors just excused them from class; no one was about to start a fight with a group of vets who probably didn’t actually need to be in school.
proposition him?”
"…Potter?" Draco breathed.
“Look, Marci, I’ve already
“Fucking Harry Potter,” he groaned to himself as he packed up for the day and spilt out onto the street.
“Draco,” Harry whined.
” she mocked, pitching her voice low and extra posh, as she always did when they started fighting. She was trying to get under his skin, try and pry a reaction from his calm. It infuriated her that he never took the bait.
Harry’s face darkened even more, which hurt Draco in a physical way that he couldn’t quite process right now. “Sit, Draco,” he said in an icy but powerful tone, leaving Draco no choice but to sit.
“What the hell is ‘fired food’?”
you,” Malfoy laughed, legs swung across Harry’s desk with a pasty in his hand. He had shown up at lunchtime with coffee for both of them, and now he and Ron were arguing about something dumb and Ministry-oriented. Harry had no idea what was going on.
Harry smiled again, pulled himself up and threw his shirt at him as he pulled on his robes. He moved as slinkily as he could manage out of the greenhouse, glowing when Neville followed him. He pushed Neville back into the greenhouse wall and kissed him deeply.
“What the fuck
With a focus on what was happening finally in front of him, Draco saw the small, whirling green dive-bombing pixies clearly.
“Hello, Harry,” she said without looking up.
“Harry, darling. For one thing, you really just aren’t that creative. If you wanted to lie about sleeping with Neville, there were simpler stories. More importantly, though, Hermione told me you were telling the truth.
“It’s raining cats and dogs out now, Bridge. I’d stay here for lunch if I were you,” he said, shaking his head like a dog and grinning at the counter. Which is when he noticed Draco, of course, meaning Draco had the wonderful privilege of seeing his bright, blooming smile disappear instantly. “So,” he said, striding purposefully forward. “He lives.”
How's Harry fairing, you ask? Oh, darlings.
, Harry. You haven't been you in ages. Draco tried to show you that. I think we'd have been in that hospital room a year and a half sooner without him. And how did you repay him?”
“Yeah, but weren’t they under investigation for money laundering and profiting from crime? Like, last year or something.”
“How is that because of me?” Draco grinned, catching Harry’s hand in his own.
Now, though, the sitting and the waiting were starting to get to him. He was always restless, and the fact that his body wasn't physically exhausted at the end of each day meant that the nightmares were back in full force. Nightly, Voldemort killed Dumbledore, only to turn around and kill everyone Harry had ever known in one, sweeping, deadly green arc. He'd wake up screaming in a cold sweat, alone in the darkness and unable to get back to sleep.
“Why are you rushing me? Got your boyfriend coming round?"
