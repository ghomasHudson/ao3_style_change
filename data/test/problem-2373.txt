Then he remembered.
"Potter," he spat.
He should have just cast
Next morning, Draco awoke slowly. It took a moment for him to remember everything that happened the night before.
Draco knew. He could see it all over Potter's face.
Draco nodded and dragged Harry with him back to his cubicle.
Draco blurted out the first thing that came to mind. "I still hate Pierce. He's done nothing but make my life miserable. And Barclay has me auditing budget reports with him now, as well."
Harry ran a hand through his messy hair, and Draco realised he was shaking. "I know. I just… Lawrence didn't have to die. He has a family."
Draco's mind raced. He didn't like this. But Harry had a point. It was best not to give away their location unless they were absolutely certain it had been compromised. Relocation had potential security flaws as well.
"We don't need this many biscuits," Potter moaned. "Nobody does."
And now, another week later, they'd packed all their belongings into a few bags with Extension Charms and bid farewell to the city.
It took a moment for Harry to understand. It was hard to look at Draco when he asked, "Why?"
"You know, you can sit closer to me if you want," Potter said after Draco handed him a mug and sat down again on the far end of the sofa.
The air in the office felt stifling then, and Harry couldn't stay there any longer. He turned on his heel and left, quietly shutting the door behind him as his breath came in quick, heaving gasps.
Whatever the reason, when it came time to close that evening, Potter did not ask Draco what he felt like having for dinner. He did not linger to chat. He merely placed his carefully folded blanket on the counter and wished Draco a good evening with a half-hearted wave.
Perfect.
It was true that he had no idea what he'd do if he wasn't an Auror, but anything had to be better than living with Potter.
Well, Draco wasn't going to argue with that. He ran his hands through Harry's messy hair and hooked his legs over Harry's shoulders. It wasn't long before he found himself moaning and asking Harry to stop, lest he come too soon.
He had barely snatched the tin and Draco's wand when he heard a plate smashing to the floor in the kitchen.
After a lengthy back-and-forth, Draco finally conceded and slid into the back seat whilst Potter and Lister sat up front. He tried to pay attention as Lister explained things about something called 'shifting gears', and there was something about a 'crutch'. Like all other Muggle things though, it made no sense and was too complicated for its own good.
"You can do that," Draco said. He opened all the cupboards, but there wasn't much in them. Some were empty. "Where's the tea?"
Until the door slammed open.
He didn't think time was capable of passing quickly that day, but it was already mid-afternoon.
Understanding finally seemed to strike, and Potter scrambled to get under the covers. Draco, still feeling bold thanks to the alcohol, rolled onto his side to face him. They looked at each other for a long while.
"Hmm," Draco said. He propped his chin on his hand and kept skimming. Parts of it were difficult to read, since MacDonald's handwriting was horrible. It alarmed him to learn he had been a suspect for a time. It was only slightly mollifying to read Jennings' note:
"Where shall we meet?"
He thought for a moment before continuing. "There was no meeting, though. Lawrence and I waited for a long time, but nobody ever came. Eventually, we came out of hiding and explored the building. It was on the first floor… That was where I saw the potion. It took me a moment to realise what it was. If I'd just been a little quicker—"
"You can start on the other side of the shop."
on the inside. Shaking his head, Harry tucked the card into his journal and spent the morning working on his book about his grandparents. Several people in the village had given him old cards, letters, and photos when he'd asked. Sometimes he liked to just sit and go through them all, to relive all their old memories. That soothed him more than anything, especially on days when he really felt he didn't have a grip on himself.
"I wonder who has access to that room."
That was how he had spent the day. After incinerating Draco's post, he had sat down and stared at the puzzle for hours, until the sun went down. And then he continued to stare, because the damn thing glowed in the dark. The last 30 or so pieces mocked him.
Draco and Potter didn't speak about their relationship that night.
He traced a finger around the edge of the album, then looked up at the clock and felt his heart clench. It was after noon already. Almost time for him to head to the bookshop.
Draco opened his mouth to say they had plans, but before he could, Potter said, "We'd love to."
"MacDonald already questioned me. If there was anything useful, they already got it."
Draco didn't ordinarily spend a lot of his time thinking about Potter.
And he had to laugh then. Draco was the one dying, and
His heart always began to beat a little faster as he walked past the sign that read
"I thought it was monthly," Harry said. He distinctly remembered Draco had visited with his Healer just a week or so ago.
He crossed his legs and arms.
"You're welcome to come to my house to help clean." She waved her toast at him. "You can't mope around all day."
Draco continued to stare as Harry entered the shop, hung his coat and scarf, and walked over to the counter.
Potter waved him off, then latched hands with the two nearest people and began dancing as a lively song started.
Harry exhaled. With shaky hands, he hung his coat. He walked slowly past Draco, whose eyes roved over him. Harry suppressed a shiver and gave a quick nod as he spilled coffee into a cup and retreated to his reading nook. Or, what was quite possibly
"I don't know why Muggle clothes have to be so complicated," he muttered, pressing a palm against his erection. Whatever they did, it wasn't going to take long.
Draco stilled himself and closed his eyes. "Just get on with it."
"Speaking of," said Harry, "Hand one over. I nearly froze my arse off on the way over here."
"God, this is so good," Harry breathed. His hands pressed against the backs of Draco's legs, and he rocked his hips gently.
The soothing pitter-patter of rain awoke Draco. It was early, and he could feel the cold air on his face. It was the perfect morning to spend in bed, half-asleep and listening to the rain. He nestled further under his blankets. A warm, heavy weight half-draped over him, though it was a bit lumpy.
Grief was an odd thing. When you hadn't lost someone yet, it was strange to miss them. Looking into Draco's eyes, Harry understood then. Everything in the past was too much, and there was no future. There was only the present, and even that wasn't enough.
It occurred to Draco that he would very much enjoy watching him masturbate one day and filed that idea away for later. Potter's breaths grew shaky, and Draco kissed him again. His brow furrowed as he let out a groan, and his cock pulsed in Draco's fingers as he came over his stomach and chest.
It was hot that day, and the blistering temperatures didn't relent for the entire week. Nights were uncomfortable as well, for the air was still and damp.
"Stop," Draco said, and took a deep breath.
"I told you," Draco said. He couldn't resist.
Draco began unpacking another month's supply of the blue potion and the clear potion. There was also a month's supply of two new potions - some thick, green sludge and something else that looked the colour of morning piss.
He ran his fingers over the counter top. It was so easy to picture Draco sitting there, watching him with a playful smile, reminding him not to forget to pick up dinner.
"Don't be such a killjoy," Perry said from the edge of the crowd.
Draco looked around the living room. It was a mess—the telly had fallen off its home atop a small wooden table, and the coffee table had been knocked over. Letters, books, and newspapers were scattered all over the floor. Their homey configuration had been spoilt, and it made him hate Pierce even more.
"I know." Potter blushed. "Let me suck you off."
"Good night," Potter said.
"Wait!" Draco leapt from his chair and reached for Harry. At the same moment Draco grabbed his arm, Harry turned on the spot to Apparate.
They collapsed onto the pillows afterwards in a warm tangle of limbs. There was still a lot of packing to do, and now they had to shower as well, but none of that mattered. Draco felt quite certain that this was one of those rare perfect moments in life.
Are you texting me to remind me - as though I could forget - or are you checking to make sure I’m still alive??
Just an educated guess. I haven't been there but the food looks good. I'd like to try it, but I don't really have anyone to go with. Can you imagine Ron at a place like that?
“As much as anything is, I suppose,” Draco shrugged.
Blaise keeps talking about your ex like I’m supposed to care. Can you do something about this?
RON I DON’T THINK I SHOULD SAY THAT! IT’S A FIRST DATE YOU IDIOT!  NOT HELPING!!!!
Well, yes? I mean, I guess so? Is there something else you’d like to do?
Harry wasn’t sure what did it - the drinks or the feeling in his gut telling him it was now or never - but he got up and strode towards Malfoy, stopping an inch from his chair. Malfoy’s eyes met his, not showing any surprise at seeing him there, but of course, nothing phased the blonde man.
Draco folded his newspaper and poured himself a cup of tea while he waited for Ron to get to his point.
Draco’s usually stoic face broke into a gentle grin. “I understand. After the war I was subjected to that particular brand of insanity. Thankfully, that’s tapered off.”
MALFOY. To think, I was honestly impressed you’d worked out the punctuation. What do you need?
Draco closed the door behind him and leant his head against it. He’s not attractive. You are not his type. That is a bad, bad idea.
“She wasn’t a very nice person, Potter.” Draco shrugged, his eyes returning to her roses.
Of your hexed face, Malfoy, not your bloody lunch. Bit fancy for a Tuesday, isn’t it?
Sorry, I know it’s an old photo, but what should I wear? Suit or the jacket?
Draco renewed his path towards Harry, who upon seeing him coming, stood straighter and his face brightened into a welcoming smile.
Draco was now watching him with an amused look on his face. “Trying to solve a puzzle, Potter?” he asked.
“Of course,” Draco agreed. He adjusted his sitting position. “Now, even for me, this is an extended period of being on my knees.” He cracked a cheeky smirk. “So how about this? Grab your clothes for tonight and come over. We can pretend to be girls and get ready together. Have a nice dinner and I’ll sort out the bird's nest you call your hair.”
Thanks go once more to my uber patient and most awesome Beta (or Alpha, really), Jade Presley. (Check out her work, she is amazeballs)
Draco stumbled, catching himself before he hit the floor. “What? What do you mean? I don’t know what you’re talking about!” He took a second to pull on the old Malfoy reserve. “He’s a friend.”
Troy’s face was understanding. “D, you’re an idiot. That boy is into you. He couldn’t be any more obvious.”
Harry was now opening laughing, and Draco felt surprisingly good about helping him relax. “Is that a yes?” he asked.
Shit, wrong person, sorry!
He almost stumbled as he removed himself far enough away from Harry that he could breathe again.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “I would have assumed Blaise and Pansy would have warned you I’d be here this morning.”
“What on earth is wrong with you, Potter?” Draco drawled. It was hard to look pompous on his knees but somehow, Draco managed to pull it off.
Malfoy??? What are you of all people doing with a *mobile*??
Harry muttered, “your favourites.” At Draco’s shocked look he rushed to continue, “at the shop, you said these ones were your favourites. So, I assumed they were what I should wear.”
Blaise made a sardonic remark and Draco allowed himself a smile. He sipped his mimosa and flicked open his copy of the Daily Prophet, breezing through the main news on the front page before letting out an inelegant snort.
“Hello?” Draco asked before holding the phone away from his ear at the sound of Pansy’s shriek.
Harry leaned more firmly against Draco’s arm and laid his hand on one of Draco’s. “I’m sorry.” He looked up at Draco. “Your mother was pretty incredible, you know, and she loved you so much.” The heat of Harry’s hand warmed the chill that had fallen upon Draco. No matter his parents flaws- and there were many- they were still his parents.
The sound of his oldest friend’s voice did a lot to dispel his worries. Of course, Pansy was right.
A voice broke through the tense moment, and Harry’s eyes flew open. They were standing in a well-lit alley, with people Apparating in and out around them. Draco stepped back quickly from Harry, dropping his arms to his sides and moving his gaze from Harry’s lips to his eyes. He held eye contact with Harry for a moment before turning to face the direction the voice came from.
“Darling,” Pansy quirked a smile, “do try to keep up. Did Potter want it to be a date with Draco?”
“Did he want it be be a date?” Blaise asked, out of nowhere.
“Hands on? Why would you ask-?” Draco caught himself. There had been something in Pansy’s tone. “What kind of guidance would I need to give Potter with my hands, Pansy?” he laughed it off. “I’m helping him to find dates, I don’t need to initiate him into the gay underground, for Merlin’s sake!”
Draco used his wand to move the boxes onto the ground. The lids zoomed off further than he intended, but he didn't care. He flipped through the files until he found the sealed records containing Ministry safe house locations and set them on the floor.
Draco crossed his arms. "What's wrong with me? What even
"Thanks," Draco said, and he meant it. For the pizza, and the talk.
"We're going," Potter said, as though that settled things.
Oh, yes. A veritable fucking rainbow of them. "There are. But the damage to my body is cumulative." He dared to look up. Potter's face looked drawn. He took a breath. "It's - I'm not -"
"I need more of the other as well," Draco called.
"Barclay?" Draco called.
At last, he found it, and Draco let out a sigh of relief at the sight of Harry sitting at the small table, leaning against his elbow and staring out the window.
"Level Nine, Department of Mysteries," the cool female voice announced. The lift clattered to a halt, and the grilles slid open.
Harry smiled. "Time to get up." He was sweating, but he didn't want to get out of bed. Just a few more minutes.
For a moment, Draco remembered what that felt like, to have hope.
was why his cheeks were wet. Not because he was too inconsolably grief-stricken to fathom, much less accept the facts of life and death.
Potter's Invisibility Cloak was something different, something incredible. Draco rubbed the silvery material between his fingers. It was unlike anything he'd felt before.
"Yes."
"Draco," he said. He looked surprised. He looked... well, he looked really good.
And before Potter could get another word in, Draco swept from the room. He threw himself into the armchair by the window and picked up his book of crosswords again.
Jennings nodded. "It's got to be, especially considering how much they would've needed for this potion. Odd choice…"
Then there were muffled noises. They seemed distant.
Potter always had to be so stubborn.
"I don't want to go to work Friday, that's all."
"I'm still here," Draco said, frowning.
"I thought staying away might help," Potter said, "but I can't stop thinking about you either. I don't know who said you can't be with anyone, but I hope you know it's rubbish. We can take things as slow as you need."
"Oh, okay, but -"
Potter exited the bathroom with messier hair than usual and gave a curt nod to Draco as he went back to the living room, where he belonged.
Robards bent down to pull a thick stack of parchment from his desk drawer and waved it in the air. "This many."
"Oh yes, it's always my fault, isn't it?"
Harry swallowed. He wondered if that was still true, if Draco still couldn't stop thinking about him, now that they had talked, now that everything had been laid out on the table. He began taking slow steps to avoid looking like a complete lunatic standing out there in the snow. Maybe it wouldn't matter. He only ever sat in that nook in the back anyhow. Surely that wouldn't be a bother?
"What if I need to contact you?"
"New here?" the man grunted. He looked at them through narrowed eyes, and Draco tried not to stare at the thick grey eyebrows that took up half his forehead.
The air seemed to crackle with possibility, and Harry felt so light-headed, wishing desperately that Draco would just
Draco was also convinced now that Lister was useless. Otherwise, he'd have warned them against adding too much washing powder to the washing machine. Instead, Draco had to face disaster on his own. It was a small mercy that Potter wasn't around to witness the soapy kitchen flood he'd created.
He let out a sigh of relief and leant into Harry, pressing their foreheads together. The living room was still a mess, but he didn't care. Now that Pierce was gone, it felt safe. It felt like home again.
"We're gonna do it once more, last time!" the ceilidh caller said from the stage over the music.
Harry pushed Draco onto his back and climbed on top of him, panting. "You really want it tonight, don't you?"
"I don't know about his personal life, but I know plenty about the way he thinks," Draco said. "Trust me, he couldn't pour piss out of a boot if there were instructions on the bottom. He's not orchestrating any elaborate murder plots. Why do you think he gets stuck with all these auditing assignments?"
Draco wiped his forehead and followed a crowd headed towards tables laden with biscuits and drinks.
"Thank you, sir." He fought to keep a smug grin from overtaking his face. Now was not the time.
Potter now. It was impossible to make that claim. Not when he dined and laughed together with him most nights of the week. Not when he welcomed and thanked Potter for his help cleaning the shop each evening. Not when he realised he liked the way 'Draco' sounded coming out of his mouth, which always turned up slightly as the last syllable escaped.
He tried distracting himself by thinking about the case. Something nagged at the back of Draco's mind, and as they finally turned onto Newtons Orchard, it struck him.
Harry had trouble processing... anything. Words, thoughts, feelings. Nothing seemed real. He looked up and saw Draco's exasperated expression. It looked like he was trying to decide between slapping Harry or pouncing on him.
Draco was too hungry to protest, so they tucked into their food. He was fond of chicken and ham pie, and he had to admit to himself that this one was especially good.
"Have you been feeling light-headed or dizzy lately? More tired than normal?"
Harry dropped the butter knife.
"I know enough."
What a fucking liar. Draco thought about fetching his wand right then. He'd Obliviate Potter and send him on his merry way back to London or wherever the hell it was he had lived before barging in on Draco's existence.
Harry swirled his tongue around Draco's cock once more before pushing his legs down and shifting to climb on top of him.
to know?"
Fuck.
But Potter occupied Draco's every waking thought the next day.
Draco shook his head and got out of bed as well. "I need to go home. Where are my clothes?"
Draco leapt to action. Pierce had thrown Harry off as they fell over, but Draco launched himself at Pierce and pinned him to the ground. One look into his remorseless expression was all it took, and Draco began punching him in the face. It was so cathartic to hear him cry out and writhe in pain. This was only a fraction of what he deserved for using the Cruciatus Curse on Harry.
Draco glanced into Pierce's cubicle on his way out and paused. The glint of a Chocolate Frog wrapper caught his eye. Pierce had one sitting on his desk.
With an absent nod from his father, he turned on his heel and left.
"I've no idea." Draco sent a stack of pants into his bag.
"Yes, I imagine so."
"I don't know for how long. Until the investigation has been completed."
"Left!" the caller shouted.
"That's not my problem," Draco said, folding his arms. "Venomous Tentacula—"
The next day, a massive storm moved into the area, and heavy rain began to fall early that morning.
Potter kissed him and whispered, "Good night."
"Can't. My house isn't connected."
"I'm looking for 'Newtons Orchard'," Potter said. "Let me know if you see it."
When Saturday finally arrived, Harry woke up early. His entire body tingled in anticipation. This was it. Today was the day. Draco had to have made up his fucking mind by now.
He paced the bedroom whilst trying to imagine where Potter might go, except he had no idea. He didn't know where his friends lived, and he didn't want to risk contacting them. It seemed unlikely Potter would go to his own home—no, he had to visit someone.
Draco swallowed everything Potter gave him, letting go of his cock only when his body went limp. He rested his cheek against Potter's thigh and watched him regain his senses.
"I really am writing," Potter spluttered. He picked up the notebook and began thumbing through it. "My grandparents, they used to live here. I only found out recently. I wanted to see what it was like here. Learn about them. Maybe write a book."
Not that it mattered much. Any Auror could find out who was working on what if they truly cared to find out. And Pierce certainly would.
Harry turned away and curled in on himself. Tears leaked out, an endless torrent of them. When was it going to stop?
Harry dumped the puzzle pieces onto the table. Several fell to the floor, and he bent down to pick them up.
Harry grinned. "Yeah, we'll figure it out over tea."
"And what about Pierce?" Draco asked, hoping to ignore the discomfort for the moment.
He frowned.
Whitby took the tin in both hands and ran his thumbs over the lid. "You did more for him than I did."
Draco pressed his lips together. "I
"No."
Draco blinked. Had he gone mad?
Harry groaned.
Now that there were a good number of edge pieces, Harry reached for the pile and began snapping all the wrong ones together.
Draco collapsed onto the sofa and rubbed his eyes. "Barclay guilted me into staying late."
It was strange, being back at this cottage. Draco's cottage.
"They just don't know me," Draco muttered.
"Mr. Potter." Whitby sat behind a desk, writing something. He waved Harry in. "I thought your friends were going to take you home tomorrow."
It was about a week, Harry learnt, that he'd been in St. Mungo's.
"Yes, yes, everyone should do more of that."
"Trust me, Potter, there's nothing to see."
Christmas had been lonely. Draco had been alone for years, and he'd become quite accustomed to it. So this loneliness over the holidays was very unwelcome. He’d slept poorly and spent a lot of time thinking. He couldn't get Potter out of his head. The lack of sleep chipped away at him, and at some point, he began considering going to Potter's house. Just to see him.
"Well, no more than the average student, I reckon. But it was nice. It was always something I noticed, especially after being cooped up at my aunt and uncle's every summer."
Draco blinked. That was unexpected.
"Ready?"
Draco winced. This certainly wasn't helping his headache. Perhaps Potter wouldn't kill him, but he might make Draco sick.
"Malfoy," Jennings said, looking up from his furrowed brow. "Why are you here?"
"God, oh god - I'm going to come," Draco cried, and the first spray of come to land on Harry's chest pushed him over the edge as well.
Draco narrowed his eyes. "A land deed."
Emily waved her hand and laughed. "Half the village can't dance. You'll fit right in."
have been arrested for that. But not precious Pierce." He crossed his arms.
"Good, good. Now, I'll take care of rerouting your post to the Ministry—"
"Excuse me?"
"That depends. Are you actually going to listen to me?"
Robards shook his head fiercely, pursing his lips. "I know Pierce. I've been acquainted with his family for decades."
He could never.
"God forbid I should ever be given one." He thought about his inevitable future at the Manor with a wife and children he didn't want.
"Malfoy!" came the voice again.
"And you think they'd send an anonymous tip luring you to some empty warehouse to set off an explosive?" Draco was growing frustrated. "If it's someone at the Ministry, they have easy access to you. They wouldn't need to go to those lengths. I'm telling you, this is related to the case you and Lawrence were working on. Why target both of you, anyhow?"
He turned and saw MacDonald smirking at him. But Draco didn't have time for her today.
"No, it's not that. I finished those."
"Well, it's not as though it's the first time someone wants to kill me," Harry said with a rueful smile. His hands gripped the edge of the sofa. "I need to think this through. I think we can figure out who it is." He looked up at Draco. "Who knows you're protecting me?"
Draco ran after Barclay down the long, dark corridor and through a black door at the end. As soon as they passed through the doorway, he immediately knew something was wrong.
Someone who knew about the case Potter and Lawrence were investigating and sent in an anonymous tip all on their own.
?" He had a pretty good idea of where the conversation was headed. It wasn't the first time this had happened.
He couldn't do anything about the first, but he could do something about the second.
"You don't get on with anyone."
"Erm, before."
"I can do both at once."
"Now do mine," Jeremy said, and Potter flipped over Jeremy's cards. There was a seven, a five, a three, another five—
"Go take a nap in the bedroom."
"What was that for?" Draco asked, slightly breathless. He tucked his keys into his pocket and started them off down the path.
"I… I don't have appropriate shoes."
Potter looked genuinely concerned. Damn.
"I told you," Draco said. "I told you you're a terrible dancer." He wished this would end.
"What?" Potter's smile fell, and he set his fish down.
As the days grew shorter and the leaves lost their vibrant green colouring, the civility that Draco had grown used to gradually turned into something else. Something undefinable.
That would do. He'd hand it in first thing tomorrow. He had no idea what he'd do afterwards, but anything had to be better than this. Perhaps he could focus on finding a partner.
He snatched a towel from the rail and barely wrapped it around himself before slamming the door open.
? "What—"
"The seventh, you say?"
Not that Draco had asked. He shifted uncomfortably and bit his lip.
That was something.
"Ordinarily when an anonymous tip comes in," Rutherford said, "I log information about its delivery. If it arrived via owl, I note what sort of owl delivered it, any unique markings it possessed… That sort of thing."
"Not yet."
They enjoyed a quiet breakfast, and Potter suggested they go on a walk afterwards.
A minute later, or possibly a few, a crack resonated, and Whitby stood before Draco in the clearing, hair in disarray.
"It can't be too much longer. It's already been four hours."
"Whose side are you on?"
"How can you fuck knowing someone you work with wants to kill you?"
"I reckon we might as well buy it now, before we need it," Potter said. He gave a bashful smile, mirroring his Chocolate Frog card photo.
It was something he had to remind himself of regularly. They didn't have to become friends, and it certainly wasn't as though Draco expected it. Civility would have been nice, however, since they were living in close quarters.
He stood shakily and stumbled out of the office and along the winding corridor to make his way back to the lift. His mind raced, and everything felt twisted and wrong.
Whitby furrowed his brow. "I'm afraid that's where this gets complicated. We were able to treat the emergent symptoms to bring you back from a critical state." He frowned as he looked at the parchment. Draco wondered how much practise this man had at delivering bad news. "We've been monitoring your condition however, and the infection poisoning your blood is still present. As of right now, we have no way to permanently treat the infection."
"Oh, and here's your map." Lister handed a map to Draco.
Harry blinked once, twice, a dozen times, trying to keep the hot tears from forcing their way out. He pulled back and looked at Draco, took in everything about him. "I don't want to stop."
Robards held a hand up. "I realise this is inconvenient. If it makes you feel better, this isn't the first time we've had to make such arrangements."
Draco sucked in a breath and bit his lip. He was already naked, but the intimacy of the moment stripped back another layer that left him feeling even more exposed and vulnerable. He gave Potter a sloppy kiss and pressed back against the welcome intrusion.
Finally.
Robards quietened him with a dark look. "If it's someone in the Ministry, secrecy is of utmost importance. I know you're already involved. But you need to let MacDonald and Jennings do their work. Just keep your mind on Potter."
Draco forced his mouth into a tight smile. From the corner of his eye, he saw Potter giving an equally strained grin.
"What?"
"I don't know. I was given five years four-and-a-half years ago. That was before I started managing my symptoms though. It - it could be longer." He tried to look hopeful, even though he hadn’t actually felt that way in a long time..
Potter took a deep breath. "I don't know." He looked at Draco and gave a small smile. "But at least we'll have some fun before then, right?"
But Potter didn't show.
Nine o'clock.
"Well, shall we?" Potter picked up the food and started making his way back towards the rear corner nook. Draco followed, and saw that Potter had left all his belongings there.
It wasn't how Draco imagined spending his Saturday. The hot bath he'd taken earlier seemed a long time ago.
"I'm going home!"
anything, you know. No exercise, unless you count the walks to and from work."
"Yes, and?" Rutherford's moustache puffed. "You're working on a case with him. Shall I assume there's anything more to this riveting story?"
"That should be fine," said Whitby. He was looking at the sky, transfixed. Draco looked up as well, but there was nothing of note. "It really is lovely out here," Whitby murmured. "I miss being able to see the stars. Astronomy was my favourite subject at Hogwarts, you know."
"My father's no longer a Death Eater. He was exonerated, and so was I."
"I hate shopping," Draco said, moping into his bowl of porridge. It was Monday morning. He and Potter always did the shopping on Monday, and Draco always whinged about it.
Draco bit his lip and swatted Harry's hand away. "I'm supposed to show you, remember?" He took his cock into his hand and began hypnotising Harry with slow, lazy pulls, squeezing just slightly at the head. Harry lay back, admiring the show, but he also wanted to lick the pink head poking out of Draco's foreskin, or kiss the dusky nipples on his flushed chest. He was certain he'd go mad with desire just watching. His hand began inching its way towards his own untouched erection, but Draco brushed him away again. Just as Harry was about to complain, Draco extended his fingers to take Harry's cock in hand as well. The hot press of their erections together made Harry lose all coherent thought. When Draco gave a light squeeze, he groaned and shut his eyes.
Rutherford was innocent. Of course.
. He searched the floor until he found his pen, then gathered his journal and took a slow, windy way through the shelves towards the front. Last as always. It was almost as though he'd never stopped coming here.
"I didn't see that one in the cupboard," Harry said. "But I did see all the astronomy books."
"That's impossible, unless…"
"No. I was just thinking maybe we're not so different any more." Potter stood and took his dishes to the sink, then left the kitchen.
"Have you taken part in this before?" Potter asked as they waited for others to arrive.
village,
This felt like a cruel joke, even if Robards insisted it wasn't. Protecting someone wasn't usually very exciting work, but if the client really was so important, this could make Draco look good.
"I'll write a summary and have it to you within a half-hour."
It was November, which meant they were entering the low season for tourists, and this suited him just fine. With any luck, Potter would go away with the rest of them.
In the light of day, the living room looked even smaller and more cramped. Draco really hoped the investigating Aurors would find whoever wanted to kill Potter quickly.
On Level Two, he let out a sigh of relief when he saw there were few people around. MacDonald and Jennings, thankfully, were not amongst them. Their cubicles were adjacent, which made Draco's task easier. He tiptoed into MacDonald's cubicle first, since she seemed to be leading the investigation.
"We should go to the Ministry and get help," he said.
"You're lucky Harry's here," he said to Pierce in a low voice. "Otherwise, you'd be dead."
"Harry," he said, and all the ire and frustration seemed to vanish from Harry's face. "We got him. Everything's going to be all right."
His hopes were dashed as soon as he entered though. Surely this much beige didn't foster a pleasing environment for eating.
Trembling hands worked their way into his hair, and Harry looked up to see Draco's panting, flushed face. The moonlight coming in from the window cast an otherworldly glow upon him. Harry's heart felt full to bursting, and in that moment, everything slid into place as realisation struck. It was all so simple.
"It's just... nice is all." Potter looked around. "Cosy." He gave a small smile.
"I reckon we'd better leave," Potter said.
"Something to drink?" Harry offered when they'd removed their shoes and hung their coats and scarves.
"Oh, yes." Draco crossed his arms. This felt good. "Shall I interrogate him, then? Would one of you be kind enough to fetch some Veritaserum?"
"I think they're happy as they are."
Draco scrambled to snatch Pierce's wand, which had clattered to the ground nearby in all the chaos.
He forced his legs to move to the sofa, sitting down in the space Draco had just recently occupied as he told Harry exactly what he'd wanted to hear, and exactly what he hadn't.
He surely didn't
All weekend, Draco felt wary and tense. He and Harry spoke long into the night Friday. They both agreed to bring their wands everywhere from now on, and Draco insisted they go everywhere together.
"Here."
"Live a little. At least look like you're enjoying yourself."
Draco glanced at his reflection in the window beside him. He tapped his foot. He checked his watch.
A waiter appeared. Lewis, who apparently fashioned himself some sort of wine connoisseur, ordered a bottle of something Draco knew he wouldn't like, then prattled on about his job. Draco didn't pay attention and took in his appearance instead.
Harry ran. The bedroom seemed so far away, and why in the
And that was that.
He talked for a long time about Lawrence's hobbies, and the tricks he liked to play on people, and the way he always treated Potter like someone normal, not like some precious figure who belonged on a pedestal.
"I beg your pardon?" Rutherford sent the box zooming back to its place on the shelf.
"Magic."
A thunderstorm rolled in later that afternoon. It brought cooler weather at last and Potter came back, soaked to the bone and gasping as though he had sprinted the entire way. Draco didn't bother suppressing his laughter.
What do you mean why? I’m not going to pump up your ego if you’re going to mock me and not even say yes.
“I didn’t intend to, but he doesn’t know!” Pansy threw her hands in the air, inadvertently splashing the remnants of her drink over the heads of both men. Sighing in exasperation, Pansy waved her wand to remove the mess and gently put down her glass. “It’s not our business, but Draco, you have to understand that Potter-”
Draco snorted. “Been watching me closely, have you?”
Draco didn’t waste any time. He offered Harry his hand, who blushed and accepted it, allowing himself to be pulled close to the blond’s body. Draco dropped his hands, guiding Harry’s around his waist before settling his own on the shorter man’s hips. They danced to the heavy beat of the song, the muggy heat of the club causing sweat to glide down their skin. As the song morphed into another, the beat of this one slowing encouraging the men to move their bodies closer to each other’s. Draco’s eyes had closed as they moved to the rhythm, but the popped open as Harry pressed his body right up against Draco’s. Bright green eyes met icy blue and time stood still.
“Huh?” Ron looked confused. He had been staring at the ceiling, obviously not thinking along the same lines as the other three.
Harry looked at him, perplexed. “How-”
Not feeling well so stayed home. Didn't want to infect you with the plague I'm currently experiencing.
Harry shook his head slowly. He might need to sober up a little to keep up with Malfoy tonight. He furrowed his brow trying to work out what angle Malfoy was working. Was he interested or not? He must be at least a little interested, as he’d asked Harry to sit down, and wasn’t mocking him. So he wasn’t disinterested, Harry was sure.
Draco moved into the dark room and paused, letting the beat of the music move through his body. He closed his eyes and smiled, rolling his neck before once again pointing out their reserved seats on the outskirts of the bar area before making a beeline for the bar and setting up a tab.
As they approached the club the group of men slowed down so Draco could cut through them to lead them to the bouncer. He kissed the familiar man on the cheek and asked after his family before being waved through.
Mitch and Tony just snickered. “You’ll work it out.” Tony stood. “C’mon, let’s go in.”
Draco traced an invisible circle on the table with his fingertip. “Potter,” he began. “I am taking you to meet some friends of mine tonight that even Pansy hasn’t met. They don’t care who I am and they won’t care who you are.” He traced faster. “I was… taught at a very young age that Malfoy’s wore armour. We were to be unflappable, unshakable. That act takes a lot of work.” He stared at a point somewhere behind Harry’s head. “At one point I got tired of the act. So I made efforts to step out of my comfort zones. Mingled with Muggles and so forth. I met some wizards who also stepped into Muggle London for fun and, well, we became good friends. We drink together and go to the clubs. And, this, the me you’re currently seeing, this is the me that they helped bring out. Comfortable, relaxed. I don’t have to hide.” He chuckled and returned his eyes to Harry’s. “I’ve drunk so much with them I’ve been unable to, for the most part.”
Harry just shrugged helplessly. “I just had so much and I didn’t know where we were going.”
“Well turns out I am,” Draco stood abruptly. “If you’re finished, we should go and get you dressed. We have about an hour before we meet the gentlemen for our pre-club drinks.”
“Potter doesn’t need our pity, Pansy. He is a perfectly fine person who just needs a little guidance.” Draco huffed a sigh, sitting back in his chair and pushing the newspaper away in annoyance. “Saviour of the wizarding world and he thinks he’s not good enough. Can you believe it? What on earth is wrong with him?”
It’s 7.01 Malfoy, and I was literally about to knock on your door. Are you ready?
He could feel Harry’s hand trembling in his, and couldn’t resist any more. He pressed Harry up against the nearest wall. “Is this okay?” he ran his tongue along the shell of Harry’s ear.
That was when Hermione had given him his first journal. She said writing had been immensely helpful for her, and it was a common suggestion from Muggle therapists to help work through all manner of mental distress. Harry gave her a tight smile as she held it out to him. It was a nice journal. Too nice, really. Thick, white pages were encased in smooth black leather. It smelled wonderful. He didn't think staining this precious book with his anguished rambling would really do anything, but he didn't want to hurt her feelings. So he took it.
Draco cringed internally, but he did feel guilty. Slightly. "Fine."
"Good for you."
"I'm sure."
"No, you're not. You were curious earlier, and you only asked me once. What did you learn?"
And Potter looked like he was being truthful, didn't he? He looked so earnest, almost desperate. It practically radiated off him. Draco took a moment to revel in it. He didn't completely believe Potter's story, but perhaps it would be fine. After all, Potter would finish up with whatever it was and leave soon enough.
"This is a typical Muggle kitchen," Lister said. He pointed to a white rectangular box with a window sitting on top of a counter. "This is a microwave. You can cook food in it."
"Yes, but I've never tried them on cashmere, and -"
Potter had a point. Draco was famished as well. But he wasn't about to admit that.
Then he remembered—the Charmed Galleon. Of course.
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s clammy forehead and inhaled.
Draco frowned. "Is it possible you cocked it up?"
." Draco gave him a light shove.
Mrs. Wilder had left a card in his letterbox. It had a sleeping cat on the front and said
"Good evening."
That had been 12 hours ago.
"Give it back, then." He held out his hand, but Potter kept staring at the parchment.
Sometimes Potter talked about Lawrence. Draco always remembered the night Potter talked about him with a tear-streaked face, and it was difficult to ignore him then. He caught himself watching Potter whenever he brought up Lawrence. The harder he tried to keep his face expressionless, the more his pain came through.
“Well, I hope he didn’t think it was a date,” Draco drawled. “As I’ve organised him a coming out of sorts.”
Big thanks again to my awesome beta jadepresley, who is simply amazing. What would I do without you? (Seriously, I never want to find out. *g*)
“Ever since sixth year,” Harry shot back and poured them both another wine.
Oh, well I was going to wear a suit. Let me see if I can find a photo and you can tell me what’s more appropriate.
Draco could feel himself begin to smile. He was touched that Harry had not only been paying enough attention to know what Draco had liked him wearing, but was making an effort to wear something he knew Draco would like.
Draco was spending a lovely morning at Zabini Manor. Every second Saturday he could be found there with Pansy and Blaise, partaking in a relaxed brunch. Today the table on the balcony had been set, and Draco tilted his head up to allow the sun to shine warmly on his face. Pansy was chattering away about the latest gossip she had heard over the counter where she worked; florists heard a remarkable amount of gossip and they spread even more, and they always knew which wizard needed to buy his wife or mistress a bunch of flowers to make up for a transgression.
And of course, by you I meant the generic *you* of the office.
Apologies for the delay in posting - I am back at work after maternity leave and it is HECTIC!
Malfoy??
He shot the security guard a quick smile and the group was waved through. “Table’s waiting, Mr Malfoy,” the man nodded respectfully. “Look for the yellow sparks.”
Malfoy’s eyes glinted with mischief. “Are you ready to come home with me, Potter?”
Pansy sipped her mimosa. “What on earth would Draco and Potter talk about?” She raised an arched eyebrow at Blaise. “It’s not as though they are exactly peers, are they? Draco was just doing the poor thing a favour. Very selfless of him.” Her mouth twitched as Draco’s head shot up to pin her with a glare.
Troy smacked the back of Draco’s head. “D’you think I’m an idiot, D?”
Ron threw himself down on the chair next to Blaise and grabbed a croissant and snagged Blaise’s glass. “Finally. I’ve been looking for you all over, Malfoy!”
“A line for a bar?” Harry whispered to Mitch. “Is that normal?”
“Which means no stories to the Prophet in the morning,” Harry finished. “Jeez, he really thought of everything, didn’t he?”
He was astonished when Harry turned bright red and muttered, “bathroom!” before speeding quickly out of the smoking area and down the stairs.
In a whirl of motion Harry had Draco pressed against the door where he had been resting a scant second ago. He pressed his body up against Draco’s, who gasped at the feel of the hard length against him. Harry kissed Draco roughly, full of teeth and lips and soft groans. It wasn’t until Draco relaxed in his arms and grabbed his arse with both hands that Harry let go and stepped back, panting. “I suppose I’ll see you at ten then.” He grinned cheekily up at Draco.
Don’t do it to him, he said to himself as they reached his friend. You’re not even close to being in his league he remonstrated himself as he made the appropriate introductions. He’s here to be introduced to new people, not for you to flirt with.
Draco buried his face in Harry’s neck, breathing in his scent deeply before running gentle kisses down his collarbone. Harry arched his neck allowing Draco better access, sighing his pleasure into Draco’s ear. Draco was becoming distracted by the clenching and releasing of Harry’s hands on his hips, so seized them in his, pressing them against the wall next to his head. He returned to his exploration of Harry’s neck, brushing soft kisses along sweat slicked skin before Draco released Harry’s hands, giving him the opportunity to grab Draco’s face and haul him in for a bruising kiss. They snogged against the wall as song after song faded in and out, until, breathless, Draco dropped his forehead to Harry’s. Harry was grinning uncertainly up at Draco.
Harry’s breath was hot against Draco’s skin and his eyes remained closed after Draco finished the perfect smudge of the eyeliner. Draco was sure that Harry hadn’t noticed how his fingers had lingered on his chin, stroking down before dropping away. Catching himself still staring, Draco backed away slowly. “Eyes open, Potter,” he demanded.
Harry nodded thoughtfully. “So, this is the real you?”
“Draco,” Harry’s voice was breathy. “Your jacket is still in the bathroom. You took it in when you got changed.”
“I’ll pick you up at ten, promise,” Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s cheek. “But you have to walk me home now, otherwise I might get lost and no one wants that.”
Draco found his usual stoic persona was worn down by Harry’s infectious laughter and he was talking much more than usual - if it were anyone but him, he might even say babbling. In return, Harry had lit up and was throwing in the odd snarky comment. Draco was sure he’d never laughed so freely or genuinely in his life.
“Dray!”
“No, but I am,” Draco sighed. “I thought I’d be able to manage this. We have only recently started to get along after school. I always thought he was attractive, but straight. And suddenly he was bent and needy and then I got to know him even more and he’s even more attractive.” He leant against the nearby wall. He turned eyes conflicted with emotion to Troy. “What am I meant to do? I’m meant to be showing him how to meet blokes, not hit on him.”
That Harry didn’t feel attractive blew Draco’s mind. That smile, he thought with a frustrated shake of his head. Has the idiot never looked in a mirror? Any fool can see how gorgeous he is.
Groaning at the prospect of an admittedly long walk back to the office, Draco offered to side-along apparate them both there to save time. He noted the slight tremble of Harry’s body as he draped an arm around his shoulders and they appeared on the balcony with a pop!
Not with magic, Malfoy, with the button on the edge - volume control. And for the record, it's now 1am. Go to bed! If you need something, message Blaise. He's the idiot who taught you how to a text, he can deal with you.
Harry chuckled lightly. “You take such good care of me,” and the tell-tale blush of embarrassment rose high onto his cheeks as he returned his hand to his drink after a light squeeze to Draco’s. Draco’s mind raced. He could feel the warm press of Harry’s leg alongside his and marvelled at it. Who would have thought that Harry bloody Potter would ever be willing to be this close to Draco Malfoy?
And if you think you can do better, you've worked out how to use the camera. You could always take one of yourself. You know. If you wanted.
Draco spent the next hour ensuring Harry didn’t get a moment to think. He was sure that what was happening in his bedroom was reminiscent of teenage girls going to a nightclub for the first time- there were piles of clothes on the floor, the sound of hysterical giggling and the occasional shriek. There had been a minor tussle over the eyeliner, with Draco, of course, victorious. He positioned Harry on the bed and leant over him, one knee between Harry’s now denim-clad legs. He held the brunette’s face still with one hand and dragged out the drawing of the line as long as he could, enjoying the feeling of Harry’s breath on his skin and the tingle on his fingers where they touched the other man’s chin.
“Thanks.” Draco didn’t look at Harry as he strode past. “I’ll just be a sec.”
Draco tried to repress a shiver as Harry’s lips brushed his ear lobe. “Well I know how terrible you are with names, Potter, figured you could do with a refresher.”
Harry’s eyes shot to the other man’s, blush visible even in the dim lighting. Draco leaned back in his chair, taking a sip of his wine. Harry’s voice dropped an octave as he replied, “shall I answer right now, Malfoy?”
Draco took a drag of the cigarette. “With who?” His stomach was in knots again. He didn’t really want to know. It was the old, selfish side of him which was saying I want him, he’s mine, almost overriding the voice saying he deserves better, someone more in his league.
“Why not?”
Harry turned away from the floo so that Draco couldn’t see his face. Draco noted the tense set of his shoulders and rapid breathing and softened his voice. “Potter, it’s okay. I’m not going to make you do anything awful. If you want to pull the plug, we can just have a nice dinner at the manor and you can show me that muggle movie you were telling me about.” He looked earnestly as he could through the flames. “My intent is not to go out of our way to out or upset you. I really just want you to meet some friends of mine.”
Half an hour later Harry was stepping through the fireplace with an armful of clothes. Draco, who had been sitting on the couch across from it immediately lost his composure. “What the hell, Potter!”
They settled themselves in their chairs and ate, still chatting. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard you talk so much,” Harry observed. “You seem to be the strong, silent type usually.”
Having flooed home immediately from Zabini Manor, Draco strode quickly to a mirror in the adjacent hallway and checked his reflection. Seeing his hair neatly in place, he returned to the floo to call Harry.
“Something like that.” Harry shrugged, resolved just to go with it. Malfoy would let him know either way, he was sure.
Before Malfoy could say anything, Harry blurted out, “come home with me, Malfoy.” He tucked his hands into his pockets, shoulders hunched.
“What just happened?” Draco looked at the others.
Malfoy was sitting at a small table with some co-workers, and the group were laughing and joking about their day at the Ministry. Harry bit his lip, admiring the way Malfoy’s eyes lit up, the line of his jaw and how his once pointed face was now softened with age. Malfoy, like his casually dressed teammates, was in a faded T-shirt, leather jacket and pair of well-worn jeans tucked into dragonhide ankle boots. Harry strained his eyes in the dim pub lighting to find the edges of the tattoos that sometimes peeked from behind his clothing. He often fantasised about running his tongue along the edges of those tattoos.
Was that you just avoiding me in the corridor, Malfoy? Why are you hiding?  Don’t be embarrassed. It’s cute :p
Draco didn't look up from the newspaper. “Didn’t we talk about this already?” he said irritably. “It went well, Pansy. He behaved and I made him look astonishingly unlike his usual self.” He shrugged. “As was expected.” He turned a page.
Draco chest swelled with pride. Yes, in fact, he had thought of everything. The night did, of course, allow for spontaneity, however, the major moves had been planned. He had even written the headline for the next day’s Quibbler, with a promise of ‘close source’ quotes ready for Luna prior to the early morning print.
But Harry froze when he stepped into the kitchen. Draco stood leaning stiffly with one hand against the kitchen table, face red and sweaty.
He realised he was wearing that same midnight blue jumper today, for early spring in the Lake District was still quite cold. For no reason whatsoever, he put his book down and began walking the perimeter of the shop, just to make sure everyone was doing fine. His steps slowed as he approached the rear corner nook, and his heart raced. Perhaps he needed to sit down. He smoothed his jumper and took a seat in the chair opposite Potter.
Uhm.. Draco?
Throughout the night, many more drinks were consumed. Draco lost count after Sal bought the table a round of suspicious looking shots, and that was around the point he realised that Harry was an affectionate drunk. A light touch on the hand turned into another, more lingering touch, and it seemed that he was finding it difficult to function without maintaining physical contact with Draco whenever they spoke. He would link their arms together, or lean his shoulder against Draco’s. At one point while he was speaking animatedly to Tony, Harry’s hand had landed high on Draco’s thigh as he leant forward, becoming more enthused about the topic. Draco hardly let himself breathe. He would have found this tipsy version of Harry quite amusing, had the feel of his hand not knotted his stomach.
Not like, you personally.  That would be ridiculous.
“Won’t you be hungover for breakfast tomorrow?” Draco smirked, “I don’t want to be stood up.”
“All right then, Potter,” he summoned a smile. “Time to get going.” He turned and pretended to search his room for his jacket.
I’m really looking forward to it.
The three men stood and made to walk in.
“Assume nothing, Blaise,” Draco sniffed imperiously. “There is no one better suited to this task.”
Your humble personality is awe inspiring too.
That's… good to know, Malfoy.
Again, Draco, I'm not just waiting by my phone for you. I appreciate the help, really. Doesn't solve the problem of not having anyone to go with. Unless you might be able to help me out there too?
“Firstly, I can see you doing that strange hand-wringing thing you do when you’re panicking,” Draco began.
Blaise shook his head firmly at Ron, who broke off mid-sentence.
Draco laughed and took Mitch by the arm. “I suppose it’s late enough to get to the club.”
“Because our first time will not be against a wall in a club with an audience while you’re drunk.” Draco bit Harry’s earlobe. “I shouldn’t even be kissing you when you’ve had so much.”
Draco smiled reassuringly. “I won’t let anything happen to you,” he promised, and took Harry’s hand, tucking it into the crook of his elbow. “I have you.” He met Harry’s eyes.
I’ll be quiet for a bit, things are happening out here. See you tonight.
I'm fucking this up. Draco Malfoy will you have dinner with me on Friday?
Shaking his head at himself. Developing feelings for a friend was not a good idea. Just because it worked for Blaise and Pansy does not mean that that’s what usually happens. That was good luck on their part. So far.
What are you doing? Is anything exciting happening? Have you got a lead on that case you were working on yesterday??
Also, do you actually want something or are you just being an annoying twat?
Not as noble as you might think.
Hints? What hints?
As Draco surveyed the scenery and sipped his wine, Harry laid a hand on Draco’s spare hand which rested on the table. He leant over and muttered into Draco’s ear, “thanks for repeating everyone’s names.”
Please don’t read too much into this, Malfoy, but I’ve been waiting ages to take you out. Trust me, I will not be dying (or getting cursed) today. Thanks for your concern
Draco made a dismissive sound and caught up to where Harry and the others were waiting. Draco checked Harry over - still in one piece and not a gibbering wreck, excellent - and led the men to the front of the waiting line.
Oh, no that’s not what I meant. Ignore the Ron thing. I meant, ice-cream? A movie?  Dancing? I’m sure you’re an excellent dancer.
“Hmm?” Draco raised a perfect eyebrow. “Yes, of course. When aren’t I?”
Draco smiled back without answering, smoothly drawling, “excuse me a moment, I’ll be right back,” before he slid out of the booth and strode to the men’s room. Checking to make sure it was empty, Draco moved straight to the basin. He rinsed his hands with cold water and rubbed it around the back of his neck. He braced his hands on the counter and sighed heavily. He’s your friend. He’s drunk. He’s lonely. He’s not interested in you. You’re the only person he knows here.
No. No one in the history of mobile phones has worked this out Malfoy.
Draco strolled up beside him, his right arm lightly brushing against Harry’s left. A tingle was left where they touched. “Yes,” he began, “it was typically used when the Malfoy’s were in danger. If they were unable to used magic to leave the property they would enter the maze. If you were not a Malfoy, or invited in, then you would be trapped wandering in the maze.” He pointed to the right of the maze to a bright, colourful garden area. “Those are Mother’s roses,” he began. “Before, well, everything, she would be out among them all day.” His voice dropped. “She used to talk to them, and said that was the secret to their beauty. The colours were brighter, scent was stronger and so on.”
From the corner of his eye, Draco watched Blaise very carefully not look at Pansy, his lips twitching. In contrast, his voice was very serious when he asked: “So who will provide that guidance, Draco? You’re a very busy man, so I assume-”
I know you've probably got better things to do. I was just -- never mind.
"It's fake," Potter said. "Just keep it on you. It's Charmed. If one of us taps it with our wand and says the secret phrase, it'll appear on the other person's Galleon."
Draco was running out of ideas, especially because all the blood had rushed to his erection. He tried not to laugh at the madness of it all, but he had to do something. Potter had stopped thrusting at least, but that did nothing for Draco's own erection, especially with Potter's breath tickling the back of his neck. He reached under the covers and gave an experimental squeeze through his pyjama bottoms.
"No, it wasn't him." Draco's mind raced, making connections that seemed fuzzy but plausible. "But the timing of the break-in and Pierce tampering with the files is too coincidental, don't you think?
Draco finally registered that it was Harry yelling, not Pierce. He paused with his fist in mid-air. His entire body felt as though it were on fire, and Pierce stared up at him with a dazed look.
Draco rolled his eyes and stepped out of the car, thankful that journey had at least ended. He took out several bags of shopping containing a new wardrobe and several books, leaving the food for Potter to bring in. He was halfway up the garden path when he heard a voice.
"So what? I never had to. We always had a house-elf at the Manor." He turned his head to avoid Potter's incredulous expression.
Pierce turned to face him again. "My wife," he said through gritted teeth. "She was killed during a raid thanks to Potter."
"It was."
skin. He no longer flinched when Potter came into the bookshop. He grudgingly handed over a blanket to Potter as well, though Draco always waited for him to ask.
He didn't even want to read.
"There isn't."
Jennings crossed his arms. "Robards doesn't want too many people involved."
Draco followed him into the kitchen and sat at the table to read through the file. Potter set two steaming mugs of tea down and sat across from him.
"Not really." Draco had never bothered to learn much practical, everyday magic.
Harry gave a roguish smile and grabbed hold of Draco's legs. "Well, if you insist."
Draco raised an eyebrow when he saw MacDonald standing in his cubicle. "Yes?"
Potter stopped. "What?"
Tomorrow, nobody would remember this. Nobody would remember them.
Draco opened one eye to see Pierce glaring at him. He still had his wand aimed at Harry.
"Are you mad?"
Fortunately, Draco's one-to-one with Robards wasn't until eleven, and it wasn't as though he had meetings with anyone else.
It was more hopeful than accurate, but it was the most diplomatic response he could think of. He didn't want to invite questions.
"As I thought. How about we make a deal?"
Lewis thought for a moment. "Why did you do it? Join them, I mean."
Draco thought it was silly, since they split to go their separate ways about two minutes after exiting the shop, but it seemed far easier to just give in to this small request, especially since he'd already taken his potions.
"No, no. I truly am curious how you two are getting on."
"You might want to think twice about that," Pierce said. "Who do you think Robards is going to believe if we get into a fight?"
"David, come here!" Potter called.
Draco sat in the back of the crowd, hoping nobody would notice him or give him dirty looks when the obvious Death Eater implications were brought up.
Draco nodded at them. He remembered Mary from the ceilidh, but she didn't recognise him. Jeremy remembered him since Draco had answered the door half-naked when they met.
It was fun, Draco had to admit.
He picked up his fork and ate. He worked clockwise around his plate: first, the duck in plum sauce, then the braised red cabbage, then the roasted potatoes. Whilst he ate, he focussed on the elegant geometric pattern on his plate. By the time he finished, most of the surrounding couples had stopped staring and returned to their own meals. Finally.
"That's all right, I can wait." Potter smiled with what Draco suspected was supposed to be encouragement. Under the safety of the counter, he tugged at his sleeves.
It seemed inevitable, obvious, but the realisation spun a fervent need he tried desperately to quench as he swallowed around Draco, glad to take anything he would give.
Draco tried not to look irritated whilst Potter explained how the caterers wanted to charge almost twice what they had done last year. He and Rosemary were trying to decide whether to find different options for food or make compromises in the existing budget and use the same caterers.
"Things to do, I know," said Potter. "But you have to eat sometime, right?"
He wanted to be an Auror, but it was an uphill battle. Draco was no stranger to nepotism, but it was supposed to work in his favour.
"You're a horrible dancer."
Christmas was approaching. Lights and festive baubles decorated a number of shop windows, and a number of bundled up villagers were out, rushing to somewhere warm, no doubt.
Robards told him to fetch his emergency bag, and when Draco returned, he handed over an old sardine tin that had been turned into a Portkey.
They tried to take him somewhere. He had no idea where - just that it was somewhere away from Draco.
Harry was busy as well. There were only two weeks until Bonfire Night, and once he and Rosemary had finalised the catering details, she convinced him to help her with some other last-minute tasks. And Harry being Harry, he readily agreed. Draco couldn't help but be annoyed by this. They were so close to figuring out this case, which meant their stay here was nearly over. Now wasn't the time to take on new endeavours or strengthen relationships that wouldn't matter.
Potter laughed, and Draco couldn't say whether it was Potter's infectious enthusiasm or something else, but he began laughing as well.
"Thanks." His face heated, and he looked away. He wasn't used to thanking Potter for anything.
"What was that?" he whispered against Harry's lips.
"I'd like it if you came," Potter said.
"Come on," Harry said, and he squeezed Draco's leg. "Let's have something to eat."
Barclay waved at him half-heartedly from his desk. "Morning," he said.
"And it's not as though we'll be able to argue whilst we're asleep."
A tapping noise from the living room dragged Harry from his thoughts. Who even knew he was here? Hermione or Ron wouldn't have bothered to knock, so it couldn't have been them.
Draco turned to look at him. He'd almost forgotten Barclay was there.
"You have nothing I want, trust me."
He held his breath at the sound of the bedroom door opening. Potter stepped through the bedroom lightly and into the bathroom. When the door shut, Draco turned the lamp on and settled back under the blankets to enjoy feeling so warm and relaxed.
He glanced at the clock again and bit his lip. There wasn't a camera in the house, and the urge to go and buy one right then warred with his desire to go to the bookshop and see Draco.
He stared at the empty chair across from him. At the half-full container of food on the table. At his own, still in his lap. The chips had gone limp, and the fish was shiny with oil. He closed the lid.
Someone wanted to kill Potter.
Draco wondered if that was a reference to Friday, when he'd left it open. Robards could be petty.
Draco and Potter exchanged a look. "No," they said.
"Are you all right?" Potter called from the other side of the door.
"Yes." All Aurors were required to keep an emergency bag packed with clothes and other essentials in the event of an urgent case. Draco had never needed his, and it sat locked in a cupboard under his desk, gathering dust. "Are we going to one of the safe houses then?"
And that thought stung.
"Look at me," Harry said in a strained voice.
"Pardon?"
"You're up early," Potter said.
Harry tried to stay awake.
"Are you sure they don't need help?" Draco tried again.
She hadn't invited him in years. After the war, the Malfoys were exonerated at their trial, but it came at a heavy price—Draco's father had given up the names of several Death Eaters, many of whom had been family friends at one point.
But of course, Harry worried. He reached out to smooth Draco's hair, then pulled him into a kiss. It was a surprise to Harry, how close he and Draco had become. Rather, that it was possible to become so close to anybody. Sometimes he forgot how long they'd known each other.
"Yes." Harry looked down at Draco. He was naked underneath the quilt - they both were. Another day, he would have pinned Draco down and done unspeakable things to him. He pushed himself off the bed and pulled on the clothes that lay nearest on the floor. "You can join us, you know."
Potter nodded. "We need to pick a meeting point. If I run into trouble, I'll Apparate there and send you the secret phrase. Then you'll know where to find me, and we'll be safe for a while, at least whilst we decide what to do next."
It was hot.
It never would be.
"It's plain as day all over your face!"
It certainly felt as though people were promoted every day. People who weren't him.
Of course. He pulled it over and flipped it open to the middle, staring at the photos without seeing them. Of fucking course. Why hadn't Harry thought of this earlier? Photos! What a bloody novel concept. He felt like such an idiot.
"You'd better explain why you're here then."
"Oh." He didn't particularly want to get lunch with Barclay, but he was one of the few people who didn't mind eating with Draco. "All right then. I suppose."
. Halfway through a plate of Jaffa Cakes and a cup of tea, the front door opened and Potter stepped inside.
Draco set the paper aside to shovel biscuits into his mouth and contemplate his life. Neither his parents nor his boss wanted him to continue working. He had no friends. And it was hard to imagine a world where Gregory Goyle would be getting married. To Astoria Greengrass, no less.
"I don't really have that luxury." He winced at the look on Potter's face. "Sorry. I - erm. Just give me a week."
Draco hurried inside, leaving the front door open, and went straight to the bedroom. He created neat stacks of trousers, pants, socks, shirts, and jumpers on the bed. He could hear Dorothy chattering Potter's ear off and decided to arrange each stack of clothing by colour before transferring everything to the wardrobe. Slowly.
They levitated Pierce's body and nudged it along through the air towards the lifts.
"Well, hurry then. I want to get ready for bed."
Draco raised an eyebrow. "Famous last words from the most famous wizard of our time. Fitting."
"Robards said you could help me."
"Then let's leave."
"Well, you'll pardon me if I don't want you negotiating my release if I'm kidnapped one day."
He tried to take his time, but the old bat had a lot to say. Finally, at the sound of applause and cheering, he returned to his seat. Except Potter beckoned to him.
"How exactly would somebody have got hold of any?"
"Well…"
"Out with it, Whitby. I'm already a dead man walking. You can't tell me anything worse than that."
Whitby scratched his temple. "Well, with what is essentially poisoned blood flowing to all your organs, you have to consider the toll it will take on your body. Over time, it will be -"
"You won't feel a thing. I promise."
In addition to the bevy of potions and journal-keeping, a conversation with Potter at the close of every evening had crept its way into Draco's daily routine.
Rutherford. He had to find Rutherford.
They all said their goodbyes, dropping off blankets and grabbing their coats on the way out. Potter approached the counter, last as usual and looking pensive. Draco clasped his hands together underneath the counter to keep from trembling so much. "Fish and chips, Potter," he barked.
"I don't remember that."
"About half an hour."
MacDonald and Jennings were convinced this had nothing to do with their case. Could they really be so wrong?
"You'll be helping Barclay again tomorrow, yeah?" Harry asked.
"Just a few more minutes. You can help me with the curtains while we wait." He began drawing the curtains back, letting in the weak spring sunlight.
"That's where the planning meeting is being held," Potter said. He held the door open, and they entered the dreary place.
"Food's great," he said.
He smirked and said, "I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, too. What a coincidence. I'll take that coffee now."
Ignoring his own fish and chips, Draco went over all the points from the day Potter and Lawrence were attacked.
"Hi," he said.
Draco slowed and shook him off. If Potter was still there - and Draco felt certain he was - there was no need for him to see this. No need for him to see anything. He knew it had been a mistake to bring Whitby to the bookshop.
Their group was small that day as well—Jeremy, Dorothy, Rosemary, and Naomi were the only ones there in addition to Harry and Draco. But Draco preferred it that way. He could only handle so many Muggles at once, and aside from some probing questions from Rosemary and Dorothy at the start, they eventually settled into safer topics, such as Bonfire Night, various Muggle children in the village, and then Jeremy and Dorothy tried to outdo each other in identifying plants and trees around them.
"I'll be back," he promised.
"There you are," Potter said. "He's a bit shy," he added to Dorothy.
Draco nodded slowly. Unfortunately, Harry was right. Robards had told him at the beginning that even he didn't know where Draco and Harry were being sent for security purposes. But someone did, and someone had made a record of it, in case there was an emergency.
Harry worked until his hand cramped, then put down his pen and stretched. His eyes darted to the clock, and his heart skipped a beat when he saw how late it had gotten.
their house Primrose Cottage anyway? - had died, and their next of kin couldn't afford to pay taxes on it? That wasn't Draco's problem.
"Lewis." He grinned. His glasses slid down his nose.
The look Draco gave him made Harry wish he hadn't asked. "Truth be told, I wasn't sure I'd actually use it."
"You must be Draco," she said, beaming. "Pleasure to meet you. I'm Emily."
Draco decided not to go home just yet.
"Harder," he said. "More."
Where had he heard that before?
"I didn't know you had blankets," said Potter, the last to leave. He frowned.
Whitby finally looked up and met Draco's eyes. "Not right away."
Harry shrugged. "You're forgetting I've spent the better part of my life with Voldemort wanting to kill me. I guess I learnt how to compartmentalise, or something." He squeezed Draco's shoulder. "Anyway, there's nothing we can do right now. And we're safe here."
"Well, I think I've lost enough money tonight," Potter said. He grinned at Jeremy. "I don't know how you did it, but I need to learn that trick one day."
Draco turned to look at him, eyes shining with appreciation. "I love it." He placed the box back on the table.
"Eating's not going to fix anything," Draco said. "And did you miss the memo that Pierce knows where we are? We should go somewhere else."
around?" he said in a low voice.
"I need to get more pastries."
"How about tonight?"
Draco looked over at him, curious. "A gift? You didn't need to get me anything."
"What time is it?"
"You're Rutherford?"
They stumbled to the bedroom and fell onto the bed in a tangled heap of arms and legs. Draco wasn't certain what to do with his hands—one clumsily lifted Potter's jumper and shirt up whilst the other wormed its way underneath the waistband of his trousers. His mind had been overtaken by a primal need to feel Potter's skin, and he didn't care how.
"Here, take this," she tried again.
Draco couldn't help scrutinising everyone he passed, wondering if it was them. If they were the one who killed Lawrence and tried to kill Potter. He paused in the centre of the Atrium, trying to discern who it could be.
"Told you it's more fun if you lighten up."
"Not long."
Harry grabbed hold of his hand, and they fell back slightly from the group. Draco laced their fingers together. He felt safe. It was a good idea to come out here, where he could make sure Harry was all right. He glanced over and saw Harry watching him.
When Draco Apparated back to the cottage, he lost his balance and fell to his knees.
"No. These days, I'm usually cold, actually."
"You're going to help me cook."
It was his third attempt at dating in as many months. Draco had signed up with a discreet matchmaking service earlier that summer. It promised a selection of high-quality potential partners, but so far, the experience had been disappointing.
Barclay looked up from his stack of parchment. "At the back of the access book, there's a map. What are you looking for?"
"Don't you see?" Draco said. "It has to be someone who could figure out what you and Lawrence were working on. And it definitely has to be someone who knows we can trace tips."
"Have you spoken to anyone here?" Draco asked. "Suspects, I mean."
"Fine." At least he wouldn't have to cook. At least he wouldn't have to argue with Potter over cooking.
He pushed his pyjama bottoms down enough to expose his erection, then sat on the edge of the bathtub and wrapped a hand around himself. Something caught his eye though, and Draco realised it was his book on the countertop. He'd left it there last night after rushing to get out.
But it was a long time before Draco finally fell asleep. He watched the rise and fall of Harry's chest until then.
Harry nodded. His entire face felt numb.
"Where exactly are we going?"
"What do you mean though, how can you not know?"
They lay tangled together afterwards whilst Potter caught his breath. Draco became conscious of his erection pressing into Potter's hip though, and eventually Potter did as well. He rolled onto his side and reached between them to take Draco's cock into his hand.
This was a side of Robards Draco had never seen before. He thought about his resignation letter, which still lay tucked away in the wardrobe under a stack of clothes.
