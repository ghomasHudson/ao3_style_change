Sirius shot Leo sour looks every few minutes, huffing childishly, and sticking his nose in the air. Leo didn’t seem to mind, or even notice really, sipping his tea calmly while reading the morning post.
Draco rolled his eyes turning his attention to Carina, “So, what are the Plans for today?”
"It is exhausting I’ll admit, and more than a bit confusing. But I think I’m just going to focus on looking for my cousins. Aunt Petunia said Aunt Violet died in child birth, and her Husband died not long before, Aunt Petunia doesn't remember his first or last name though. Never met him and skipped the wedding." Harry sighed rubbing his hand over his face.
Theo scowled at the blonde, “Back off Rae, she’s feeling guilty as it is.” Theo warned.
Leo frowned he still hadn't gotten use to them calling him that. It was a strategic move Julian had suggested to keep the rest of the school at arm’s length until they'd ascertained who could be trusted. Leo wouldn't put it past the old man to have student or teacher spies. The plan was to appear as unapproachable as possible.
“Potter,” Malfoy whispered.
Dumbledore smiled in a grandfatherly way that Harry felt was a bit condescending. "I’d believed telling you of your Aunt Violets passing would only add to the sense of loss you felt for your parents. As for your cousins I could convince Petunia to take you in, but no doubt asking her to take in your twin cousins would be pushing too far.”
Tinsel sagged in quiet relief before straightening and bowing, “Tinsel does not deserve such a kind Master. Tinsel will do this.”
“About you and Hogwarts resident ‘Mob Boss’ Leo Potter,” Blaise clarified smirking at his own private joke. He seemed to think it was ‘cute’ that the students began calling Potter and his group that. Though if Draco were honest, it seemed to fit, Leo and his group seemed to behave like they were part of the Mob. ‘Don Leo’… that was a frightening thought.
“What!” Draco chocked shoving himself into the far corner of his plush chair, away from his friend, “you’re basically my cousin!”
“…Yes,” Harry answered after a pause, glancing up at the two hesitantly. They didn’t appear to be angry. Maybe he was in the clear, he really wanted them to like Draco, and after all he was a big part of Harry’s life now.
“Theo,” Leo drawled slowly, causing the boy to straighten and focus his attention on his ‘Boss’.
The second son Charlie, had arrived not long after and unfortunately made the same misstep. Ginny had thrown a massive tantrum screaming at her stone faced parents about her lack of ‘invitation’ being their fault. For the first time in any of the Weasley boys memories, their mother shouted back ordering her to her room with no supper. What surprised the boys most was the acidic hostility the woman had for whomever this ‘Leo’ was.
Malfoy came back fairly quickly and handed him the tools to prep the ingredients.
Pansy huffed attempting to stare him down, her new lackey’s shifted uncomfortably for a moment before seeming to back down under his gaze. Pansy scowled before glaring back at them, and grudgingly stepping aside at the minute smirk on Malfoy’s face telling her she’d lost again.
xXxXHPxDMXxXx
Draco nearly gapped in shock as what looked like four Reindeer pulled a sleigh down to meet them. Pansy whistled appearing impressed.
“Actually,” Theo began frowning, he glanced at Lyra and the others (Sans Carina and Julian) “I’m a bit curious as well.” Murmurs of agreement came from the others.
“Are you sure?” Carina asked tearfully, glancing shyly up at him, total and absolute trust shining up at him from her eyes.
“You two are acting like children!” Lyra scolded, while scratching at the pup’s belly.
“I’m still interested yes, but I’ve stopped chasing him,” Draco sighed, twirling the spoon in his morning tea.
Leo chuckled, "I'm looking for solid allies Miss Bulstrode, and what better option than a Slytherin. They're sneaky, clever, and with the right motivations loyal. Plus my cousin has an… Interest in him."
Harry and the others burst out laughing while Orion pretended to act like a spoiled Pureblood and ordered them around.
“Because I can make your toes curl, and light every nerve in your body on fire. I can make you scream louder, beg harder, and need so much more… do you still want me to stop?”
Julian scowled scooping up the pup, as if he expected her to stomp on him, “He’s got better taste then your smelly heels, besides he’s just a pup, he’s spirited. Better than your mangy Kneazel!” The two glared each other down, until a pointed cough came from their right, interrupting the stare off.
“That’s what I’m afraid of,” The dark haired man sulked scowling at the carpet. “You can’t tell me you’re alright with what he wants to do to her!”
Draco scowled raising his eyes from the hourglass, and passing over the parchment, “Finished actually.”
If Harry needed rescuing from anyone, it more likely would be from Dumbledore himself. The man seemed far too interested in Harry’s personal affairs, and never seemed to share any of the important details until it was too late. This lack of honesty on Dumbledore’s part caused Harry to keep secrets of his own, however small they may have been.
Blaise frowned looking thoughtful, “What are you doing to reach your goal? So far I’ve only seen pathetic little pranks and sad little outbursts in class, nothing note worthy or overly impressive. A childish tantrum if you ask me.”
"Sirius do you remember Violet," Remus asked absently, running a finger over his first crush’s cheek. She possessed the kindest heart he’d ever had the honor to hold a place in.
“You realize this means I’m never letting you date right,” Leo informed his other cousin seriously. “I trust Theo with Cari, but you’re all I have left now Rae. I’m not sharing you.”
Leo walked into the Great Hall and paused waiting for Julian and his cousins to catch up. When they did he smirked and jerked his head in the Headmasters direction. Dumbledore stood in front of the Head table with Molly scanning the students anxiously.
"Sirius your awful, whatever, I'm not going to be part of this. And no I won't tell Leo." Remus huffed stalking out of the room, he should be use to Sirius’ idiocy by now.
The twins had never looked more different then in that moment. Carina wearing more casual yet conservative clothing, and Lyra choosing more free and wild clothing, it was eerie. It was like seeing two of the same person in different styles. So similar and yet, they looked like polar opposites. Lyra’s hair was tied up revealing her metal littered ears, with leather bands on her wrists, and a heart shaped Locket hanging from her neck. While Carina wore but a single piece of jewelry, an oval shaped locket.
Leo didn’t reply merely pressing him more firmly against the wall, making the small space feel even smaller, “Then I’ll
(See the end of the chapter for
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Leo chuckled lightly, pulling back to raise a brow at him, “Remus is Sirius’ Boyfriend, as well as an old friend of my Parents, he’s like a second Godfather to me. And this is Sirius’ Home so I really don’t have much of a say in who lives here. Not that I’d make him leave if I did.”
“’Lo Grandfather Charles, Grandmother Amelia, it’s good to see you.”
High-pitched giggling broke him from his trance and he yanked his hands back blushing furiously as he looked up at Leo through his fringe.
"Shopping!" They chorused.
“AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH”
Harry gave an unimpressed snort, as he pushed himself to his feet. He caught Draco’s hand and pulled himself up.  “My Boyfriend, you haven’t seen him have you, tall dark and jealous?”
Leo transfigured his chair again and sat staring at the red head contemplatively.
Lyra sighed reaching up reflexively to tighten her bun, a nervous habit of hers. She nearly jumped when she turned and ran right into a broad chest.
“Paul!” Chuckie and Harry protested in shock, Noah just looked shocked.
“THERE! THAT’S what I’m talking about. WHY are you being nice, WHY are you being so reasonable. You’re MALFOY, you’re not SUPPOSE to be nice and reasonable. You’re a slimy GIT! I DON’T like you so why are you being NICE to me you IDIOT!” Leo ranted, chest heaving with emotion.
Carina smiled tightly, folding her hands on the table in front of her “It wasn’t intended to be.”
“I can’t,” Draco sighed glancing down slightly in shame.
Well... alright then.  I think we can all agree the poll results were unanimous and that this story will be making a come back. Haha, I've already started editing and tweaking the chapter to my liking, I've got a feeling you'll all really enjoy this one ;)
Vernon almost flinched at her tone, “The BOY is doing it again!”
Draco smiled taking his hands over the table, “Good, because I was sure Sirius might’ve been getting revenge for that time I accidently made his hair fall out.”
The tiny elf shifted uncertainly, “You is to be going with Nixie now, yes?”
Orion sighed, before turning to him with mischief in her eyes, “How was your summer Harry?”
Relaxing slightly at the unspoken vow the raven haired boy straightened as the wall melted into an archway, and they strolled through. A pug faced girl with spiderlike eyelashes appeared before them as if she’d apparated there. “So you made it here, though not without help it seems, disappointing. You may go Zabini, you’re no longer needed, anyway Draco darling. I’m sure your family’s name will more then cover that little tidbit.
“Blaise, Adrian, these simpletons are now your friends as well, Orion Black and Mikhail Koshkov.” Draco introduced eyes dancing with laughter at Harry and his friend’s mystified expressions. He knew Orion or Mikhail would explain for him.
Cho surged to her feet, “It’s not ignorance! Its common sense, his kind is Wrong, DISGUSTING!”
“That hurt Kitten, why’d you run?”
Hermione hummed and gave him a critical look as she stirred her tea, "What aren't you telling me?"
“Leo does NOT like to be ignored,” she smirked before following her sister out.
On one of their dates, before Mr. Potter returned home, Harry had taken him to an Arcade where one of the Employees had flirted relentlessly with him. Harry had brushed it off as her being polite until she’d given him her number, and he’d had to kindly explain that he was gay and dating Draco. The girl had been devastated and a bit peeved claiming he’d led her on.
Draco rolled his eyes, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist and dropping his chin on top of the shorter teens head, “Next time mate, I promised Harry a trip to the Cinema.”
“And where exactly did you
Daphne straightened minutely subtly watching them from the corner of her eye.
Julian and Millicent were looking anywhere, but their three friends. Not wanting to get any more involved than they were.
“!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Thump Crash Bump
The Brunette felt her breath catch, “I thought you said I wasn’t sneaky,” She challenged slowly arching a perfectly plucked brow, the boy would see the frizzy caterpillar eyes her mum had spelled however.
(2) Liebe Frau – Dear Lady
Lyra smiled brushing her dark blonde hair over her shoulder, she’d curled it today. She huffed when she turned her head causing the long curls to spill back over into her face. The long curls seemed to bug her more than when she wore it straight. Sighing in annoyance she pulled her hair band off her wrist and gathered her hair up and tied it up in a messy bun.
“Draco!” Harry cried out in a throaty whine, practically crying at the weird feelings shooting through his body.
Fred’s hands shook as he stared down at the Birth certificate and the Ministry letter.
Leo rounded on him with a cold look, bracing his hands on the table, “Is that going to be a problem?”
Do you want me to continue 'The Lie in your Truth'?
Orion raised an amused brow, “You know corrupting doesn’t always involve sex Draco but thanks for clarifying.”
Professor Snape merely scoffed before sweeping out of the room in his usual eerie manner.
Harry swallowed thickly his eyes dancing between Draco’s anxiously, “Why?”
Ever since Theo told him Malfoy was having wet dreams about him he'd felt more and more uncomfortable around the boy.
Draco grinned cheekily, “Couldn’t keep his hands off me.” Harry huffed snatching Draco’s wrist and dragging him away from his ‘ex-friend’ who now couldn’t stop laughing.
… Well this was familiar!
“Found my birth certificate, the letter from the Ministry approving my new name with my new birth certificate attached… and the application for Ministry Support,” Julian shrugged, leaning against Fred’s bed post. “They were paid to take care of me, since I’m not actually their kid. Looking through Molly’s ‘Office’ I found a letter from Gringotts stating that in no uncertain terms was she allowed to access my inheritance. She and Uncle Arthur have been trying to take my inheritance for years.”
xXxXxXx
“I bet that you just LOVE to see everyone pissed off at me right?” Leo snarled, gesturing at Theo and Millicent, who both looked like deer caught in headlights. Malfoy’s brow wrinkled in confusion.
“You alright Golden Boy?”
“What?” Draco frowned before crowding Harry against the table, “Do you honestly believe I’d willingly go to a different school while you prance around attracting Merlin only knows who. I already told you, Malfoy’s DON’T share. I don’t want anyone touching what’s mine. And this… This is Mine!” Draco grabbed Harry’s ass roughly pressing their hips together.
“Well I’m boned this year,” Draco griped, crossing his arms in annoyance “Won’t even make it to Halloween with you two ganging up on me.”
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
Draco squirmed the firm pressure of the charm sending a curiously pleasant chill down his spine, “Let go, I’m very cross with you right now Leo Harrison James Potter.”
Leo smirked, looking pleased, “Do it.”
“Relax,” Julian murmured in amusement, turning his back on the older girl in favor of leering at Tracy, bumping the girls shoulder lightly, “No one’s going to bit, unless you’re into that sort of thing.”
"Its fine," Leo chuckled, pressing a cautious kiss to her temple, she seemed to revel in the attention.
Millicent wandered away looking amused, as she returned to her table, ignoring her classmates probing questions as she filled her plate.
Tracy glanced at him nervously, “She’s my best friend,” she mumbled nervously.
The five nodded jerkily, still refusing to meet his gaze. Leo nodded firmly before summoning a roll of parchment, “Alright here’s what we know.” Lyra and Julian repaired the table quickly and helped him unroll the parchment in front of them.
Leo chuckled, "Oh yes you are. Don't worry I'll be rough."
Lily relaxed slightly rubbing her sons back soothingly, “I know it wasn’t your fault Dad.”
Draco froze paling rapidly as his eyes snapped up. Eerie green eyes stared up at him from the dim shadows cast upon the young mans face. A sinful smirk curled his lips as he tuck both hands behind his head and cocked a brow. The blonde scrambled as if to climb off only to drop heavily back into place as an invisible force settled him in place, clearly a spell but how Leo accomplished that was beyond him.
“I have,” Harry agreed frowning in confusion. Did Draco think he was going to judge him based on his Parents? That wouldn’t be very fair. “So what about them, I don’t care about silly rumors or what people believe. I judge people for myself. I’ve never cared much for gossip or all that tripe. Those rags are always spewing nonsense about my godfather and I’ve learned to make my own opinions. Besides even if some of it was true, my godfather Sirius grew up in a snooty uptight dark family and he came out a great man. So I don’t judge people based on family… I judge people for who THEY are.”
“I think I should go take that shower now,” Leo pushed back shoving his hands in his pockets as he studied Draco’s face intently. Draco bit his lip frustrated at the strange emotions the raven stirred in him.
xXxXHPxDMXxXx
Lyra’s brow shot to her hairline, “Plans?” she huffed in amusement.
Upon entering the Suite the three took a moment to examine their new domain. The door had only opened when the three had placed their hands on the door pushing a bit of their magic into it. According to Blaise it was more secure than keys as no one could fake a magical signature.
"What?  What about Lyra?" Sirius asked, surprised Harry knew, and excited that at least one of his Niece’s was safe… probably.
“I’m sorry, I need to think,” Leo gasped waving his hand to put it back in place only partially to cover Draco from sight. For both their benefit, he wouldn’t want Draco in trouble because of him. Leo turned and dashed down the hall toward the common room.
“I’m very self Harry, and very possessive, I don’t like people touching what’s mine. Probably some weird psychological thing caused by my parents, but there you have it. I don’t let go of what’s mine very easily Harry. So if we started dating…” Draco trailed off. Harry had no idea what his innocent wide green doe eyes were doing to him. Draco always liked fragile things when he was younger. He always liked to break them to get his mothers attention. So he was very tempted to force Harry down on the bed and ‘break’ him. He didn’t want to though, not anymore. When he first climbed through the window he’d had every intention of mocking the weirdo who watched him from the tree, getting his name, then calling the Auror’s to report his annoying little Stalker. Then he saw him, and looked into his eyes, and realized the boy had meant no harm. Who was he kidding, he’d fallen in love with the boys wide doe eyes with their deep jade green color and the emerald green ring around them. He now had a crush on his stalker… maybe Viktor was right, Lucius really had messed him up more then he realized. Whatever life was more fun this way anyway. Crazy was fun.
Draco’s hands jumped to his shoulders, for balance, brows pinched in confusion. What the bloody hell was going on? What was Leo running from? Leo didn’t run from anything, at least that Draco knew of.
Draco grunted in pain as his head connected sharply with the wall behind him. He rubbed his head watching Leo retreat down the hall, before turning toward his common room allowing a wicked smirk to grace his lips. That had gone much better than planned.
Harry shook his head, "We didn't even know her name. We've been looking, but we don't have a last name other then Evans to look under."
To be honest I had quite a few interruptions in my writing, the first being... my sewer line collapsed and my house flooded ruining my floors so I was forced from the house for a little more than two Months while they replaced the damaged pipes, and cleaned, sanatized, and replaced the floors in my house. So again, I'm sooooo sorry!
“Yeah, I’m alright,” Harry smiled, and honestly he was, just knowing Draco was still on his side and willing to be there ease a lot of his doubts that had built up in his absence.
Harry agreed pedaling quickly down the street, it was noon and he didn’t want to be late.
Leo paused turning to look at her with a detached careless expression as if her desire held no importance to him, “And?”
Theo stopped and held out his hand, "I'm in."
Draco gulped staring wide eyed at the boy and feeling helpless as he closed in.
"Petunia!"
"Have you been sleeping at all?" Lyra asked, expression one of true concern, "You look tired."
Harry shivered and tried to shoulder the older boy off again, “Knock it off. Bloody Hell I’m beginning to wonder why.”
"W-wait, I'm not ready for this," Draco backed into the wall as the boy dropped his pants and stepped forward under the spray smirking sexily.
Draco hummed, “Should’ve hit the bloody bastard.”
"We're helping Malfoy." Julian stated, straight to the point, in an effort to not stare at the unintentionally seductive girls. They were half asleep and in Pajamas. Besides this was about Leo.
Twin- Lyra Amalthea Black (Carina's sister)
"Well this is it." Carina mused closing her trunk in her room.
A firm familiar hand grasped his shoulder as his Mother and two godfathers stepped out of the Floo. The three Adult’s seemed to pause apprehensively before slowly making their way over. Harry took a deep breath before turning to look up at his paternal Grandfather.
“No,” Leo amended quickly looking startled, he winced looking frustrated, “I’m not good at this sort of thing, and I’m not really sure how this is going to work. But I’m willing to try, and I’m selfish enough to ask you to give me the chance.”
Harry frowned glancing between his two friends, a bad feeling rising in his chest. Ron’s Godfather Gideon Prewett, being an Auror like Harry’s Dad, had instilled a sense of Justice in the teen much stronger then Harry’s Father had managed. So for the Red head to be acting the ways he was something must have gone wrong, whether he told them about it or not was the real question.
Draco rolled his eyes impatiently before grabbing himself and helping Harry line himself up, “Sit.” He demanded.
You think you’re my equal? That’s laughable, don’t flatter yourself, I’m a Malfoy. Did your parents teach you nothing you bloody simpleton. Never show your hand before the opponent. You play using your Parents influence, rather than building your own. I’m surprised no one’s step on you yet. So allow me to be the first. Move, before I have you moved.”
“You can’t get out Malfoy, I locked the door with a time sensitive spell.” Leo frowned looking uncomfortable again.
Leo frowned shaking his head as he measured out the doxy eggs, “Heat until it turns pink.”
3) Capo di tutti capi- Boss of bosses= Highest Ranking Family Member
3 My Sister's (Same Sister) Husband was Arrested New Years Day while on a Coffee run :( His Ex claimed he'd hit punched their Daughter (His oldest shes 3) he's been applying for full custady do to her Drug Addict boyfriend. The Boyfriends claiming he never touched the little girl. We dont believe it
Malfoy's petal pink lips parted in surprise as he looked up, 'Oh this will be to good'.
Harry grunted unhappily, “Take off your pants.”
"Gryffindor!"
Suspiciously enough on the fourth day, He was gone, nowhere to be seen. Harry and Draco exchanged a curious look before shrugging and taking a seat on the couch. They’d just finished watching an episode of South Park (“What the bloody hell am I watching Harry?” Draco had asked, looking horrified.) When Sirius strolled out of the Fireplace and took a seat on the couch next to the two.
Draco snorted skeptically, “You know they can’t, technically you aren’t bound to them. You are bound to me. You’re my house elf, they can’t touch you.”
“Fuck off, Bulstrode,” Leo grouched sagging in his seat and dragging his hand down his face in annoyance.
Draco smiled in relief before thanking her and quickly finding a table.
Draco smirked climbing onto his knees without unseating himself he roughly grabbed Harry’s hips chuckling when Harry’s hands caught his wrists as anchors, “You asked for it.”
"You treated me like an outsider. Which I now realize I was," Julian scoffed. “Nothing I did was good enough, and the way you looked at me sometimes, like I’d done something personally offensive. But it makes sense now. It was never me you were silently punishing. It was my Father, Fabian Prewett. Were you ever going to tell me that I was to be Grandfather Bertram’s Heir, or were you just going to pass my birthright on to Charlie?”
“Carina or Leo?” he asked frowning as he studied the numbers before him trying to figure out why they weren’t adding up.
“I woke once after arriving, to hear the Headmaster insisting to check me over. He kept saying the sigil on my chest, if it was there, could ruin all his plans. I guess my magic really wanted to hide it. Because after poking and prodding at my chest for a while he declared it wasn’t there. That my parents must not have believed in the old ritual. After changing for the first time after the accident… Julian walked in and saw it. We found Carina and hurried off to the Library. We found the answer in an old Journal. It was a book titled ‘Seals and Enochians’ it belonged to an ancestor of mine… actually it had been his personal research Journal so…”
Leo paused frowning at the boy, he didn’t know why. He just didn’t want the boy near Draco he was supposed to like Leo… When did he start thinking of Malfoy as Draco? Malfoy Dammit!
"Yeah, because I'm devastated to find out I was adopted. I had already figured it out. I'm way over it. So what's up?" Hermione dismissed casually, the slight tremor of her hand was ignored.
. HE bumped into ME! He’s rude, arrogant, and completely at fault here. He startled me okay,” Lyra huffed childishly, crossing her arms defensively.
“Yeah, you said your Uncle told you Draco was switching schools? Please come in.” Harry invited kindly. Draco wanted to throw them both into the hall.
"Remus… why ARE you two in a bush… together?"
Theo cleared his throat attempting to steer the conversation to safer grounds, “I have to admit we had an ulterior reason to inviting you both here other than to talk to Draco.”
Blaise’s expression was even colder then before, “He will.”
“My observations of the two run along the same lines and you seem to be right about Tracy feeling cornered. All the Death Eater talk is limited mostly to when Crabbe, Goyle, Pucey, and Laurent are around. Other than that it’s mostly awkward offhanded comments that seem to be rehearsed or automatic usually indicating that those responses have been ingrained out of habit or fear.” Millie noted thoughtfully.
Despite all appearances Ronald Weasley was NOT Stupid. He was actually incredibly smart, one of the reasons Hermione got so frustrated with him all the time. He just didn't care to try. Ron believed that if they knew how smart he was, they'd expect more out of him. So he didn't try. In conclusion, Ron Weasley was lazy.
Tracy faltered, as if startled at being included, “I know you don’t side with He-who-must not-be-named. I know you don’t side with Dumbledore. And from small observations I gather that you stand somewhere between them. You seem to fight for freedom to choose. Freedom to choose our own path, something both light and dark wouldn’t allow for.”
“Dammit Orion!”
Sirius frowned as he read Leo's note over Remus' shoulder, "So my little cousin has a stiffy for Leo eh?"
Malfoy held a hand up defensively, the other nervously clutching the strap of his bag, “Leo then. Are you feeling ok?”
Ginny blinked cocking her head curiously, “That’s what it’s been about? Dad said Malfoy’s didn’t like us but he never said why.”
“Well, isn’t this a lovely sight.”
“Friends?” Draco drawled coolly, raising a brow at the uncomfortable look on the girls face. Blaise and Adrian had given in and stopped trying to deny and argue with him after the first week of classes, and slowly over the course of their second week (This week) they’d given up completely.
The Letter from the Ministry was a letter of approval, stating that Fredrick Walden Weasley was his new name… and that the Ministry would be transferring money to their account for his care.
“Two vaults?” They finished in confusion, glancing at each other.
“IAN,” Carina yelped blushing furiously now.
Harry shrugged smiling contently, “I wanted to be alone with you, and what you had planned sounded like it was going to be crowded.”
Julian eyed his Cousins sympathetically, true regret in his eyes, “Sorry George, it’s not.”
“I’d hardly say it was
Malfoy nodded before gesturing at his notebook, “Do you mind than?”
DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM DM
Leo growled softly, mouth pressed into the skin below his ear, “Unless you’re planning to do something about it. Sit. Still.”
Sirius choked boggling up at the boy, “You never saw me!” he declared to the group before darting into a door on the left.
A tall Raven haired boy stood leaning in the doorway a cocky smirk in place. Rugged Bulgarian features and dark stubble, mocking sable eyes. It was him it was Mikhail.
Draco smiled warmly down at the shorter woman, Harry had obviously gotten his short stature from her, “Lovely to see you again Amelia, Charles. And how was work at the Ministry Charles? No trouble with the other Council members I trust? Draco may not have said much when these two arrived so suddenly two days ago, but Amelia and Charles had not had the same reservations and had discussed work while awaiting their Grandson’s arrival.
powerful upon claiming his title as Head of the Noble house of Prewitt, and wickedly intelligent. The perfect man, and if the rumors were true, the perfect lover as well. Pansy cleared her throat politely slowly lifting her eyes to the endless azure orbs of the Prewitt heir, she shifted awkwardly noticing the slow smile forming on the boys handsome features.
Carina closed her eyes as if that would change what was happening, she knew it would be a while before she spoke in an open unguarded manner with her cousin, Leo did not forgive very easily. Especially in the case of, forgiving those closest to him, when they have hurt him.
Leo sighed, he was to wound up for this sort of thing, "I'm sorry Rae, and I'm just feeling a bit wonky."
“Thank you Axel, there’s a large Caldron of Porridge with a weightless and heating charm on it, for you and your family, in the Kitchen. Have a Happy Christmas Mate.”
“We plan on remolding the Ministry Lord Zabini. You see, this is about more than just revenge against a mad old fool…. Dumbledore has the Ministry on puppets strings. Every Department every figure of power… are puppets, dancing on strings. The old man manipulated our lives, twisted them beyond repair. Lily Evans life was twisted beyond recognition. Violet Evans life snuffed out, erased from existence on a mere whim. To easy, far too easy, I won’t allow it. I believe you could help with this.”
Fred and George turned wary, glancing at each other, “Whose is it then?”
Don't hate me! We're getting closer I promise! Leo now knows he likes Draco! I just don't want to be one of those writers who takes forever for them to admit they like each other and then just throws everything at you in one half assed chapter! But we are almost there I promise!
By a very determined Malfoy, who seemed to make it his mission to get into his pants.
Harry held up his hands in a halting manner, looking regretful "Slow down, Carina, Ron’s right. And we’ve been out for far too long now. Someone’s bound to realize we’ve gone missing if we don’t get back soon. Plus, where would we even begin to look?"
“What did you say BOY?”
The Slytherin gasped in startled shock as he was suddenly rolled onto his back and his wrists were pinned to the soft pillow above his head. “You know… you’re right, I don’t know what I was thinking, plus we’re at mine so it’s not like the old man’s watching or anything. So I can do,
Hermione- Carina Aurora Black (Harry's Cousin)
“Thank you Orion!” Draco gritted out tightly.
Draco grinned sheepishly at the Cashier, “Hello, I know we’re kind of late but… I had a preordered Pizza under Black, we’re not too late are we?”
Leo chuckled pushing him back against the armrest of the couch, “I will.”
“A few days then… Julian,” Fred murmured, feeling a bit guilty as he gestured for the younger boy to leave. He and George had a lot to figure out. And Molly and Arthur had a lot to answer for. He was how ever sure of one thing… they would all regret hiding the truth, he was sure Julian and his friends would see to that. Whether Fred and George aided in their quest was yet to be seen.
The shivering group was shocked by the warm blast of air that poured out on them. But not as shocked as they were to see Sirius Black (Though Draco really shouldn’t have been) standing proudly in the middle of the huge marble entryway, smiling invitingly, his smile growing as the Crups rushed him. He knelt down patting the pup’s heads, “Padfoot, Moony, Prongs, Go find Leo, Julian, and the Twins.” And the Crups were off again.
"You say you keep me with the Dursley's for my protection," Leo seethed, the old goat had an excuse for everything didn’t he.
Carina chuckled as she slid onto the desk in front of Lyra allowing the girl to lay her head in her lap in exhaustion, "You guy did so well you wore us out," Carina laughed.
“Because, you always drag me up here Harry! If it’s not what you want, why do it?” Draco demanded looking upset, he ran his hands roughly through his already messy hair, “You said a boyfriend is supposed to satisfy all his boyfriends needs, what more can I do for you!”
Draco mused as his mind slowly clouded over. His only thoughts centering on the strangely alluring taste of the boy crowding him against the wall and the heavy Earthy smell invading his senses. Cautiously Draco reached up wrapping his arms around the taller boys’ neck, remembering the last time they were in this position. Draco pulled back unable to resist asking, “Not gonna run away this time are you?” He panted breathlessly.
“Seamus Finnegan and Dean Thomas, it’s please to meet you all.” The sandy haired boy introduced with a thick Irish accent, his tall dark skinned friend nodding at his name.
Lyra burst out laughing, as the small girl blushed obviously embarrassed for the much taller fifth year boy.
"Right," Remus and Sirius looked disturbed by Harry's admission, "That's not all, you have Cousin’s other than Dobbly."
Draco stared at the table in stunned silence, Leo did that because of him? Because Smith was planning to… Draco swallowed thickly attempting to quell the warm feeling coiling in his lower stomach.
Lily smiled brushing his cheek, “I know love, but knowing you, you’d sit and fuss over your Father just as much as I’m going to be. But he’s going to be fine, you go enjoy your summer, I’ll call for you when he wakes up alright?”
Smirking he muttered the time release spell, the door swung open, “You might want to set it again.”
Leo shivered before looking away quickly to focus on toasting more dragonfly thoraxes. “Add until it turns silver.”
Grasping the man’s wrists tightly, Draco twisted them inward causing the man to wince and quickly release him. Taking full advantage Draco sucked in a breath coughing as his throat burned, and he rasped out “I’d hoped we could come to some kind of agreement Professor, maybe even be civil, but I see that’s not likely to happen. Though I will warn you now Professor, I have use of a pensive and I will share what happened here with the Headmaster if I hear of you mismarking the purebloods grades.”
“By the way, how’d your Dad take the news?” Ginny asked innocently, covertly asking about his reaction to Harry’s relationship with Draco.
Sirius huffed, "Leo needs to get laid. Whether that boy admits it or not I'm ninety-eight percent sure he's bi if not outright gay."
“Damn it Draco, he just attacked you!” Ron hissed glancing at the door uneasily, obviously nervous about fetching his own bag, before silently summoning it from the classroom.
Ron paused before flipping carefully through the files, "I found something a few days ago."
Carina leaned down to place a sweet kiss on the boys lips when.
“What just happened?” Tracy asked warily, she’d never seen the boss that angry before.
“That’s what you basically just said,” Draco drawled dropping his chin in his hand and raising a bored brow at them.
Slamming a hand down on his desk, Severus’ lip curled in an ugly snarl, “Your Father asked me to keep an eye on you Brat! Refrain from making yourself more of a nuisance than strictly necessary, or I shall make your remaining days here very unpleasant.” The threat hung in the air for a beat.
Thump- Bump- Smack- Thump- Bump- Smack- Thump- Bump- Smack- Thump- Bump-
“You and Draco aren’t so different!” Harry blurted out, wincing at the sharp look that Sirius threw at him.
At that moment a grimacing waitress dropped off their pizza, “here you are, one large Garlic Anchovy Pineapple and Jalapeño Pizza. Enjoy!”
Draco smirked before releasing him and strolling calmly toward the hallway.
They walked until they reached a table hidden in a dark secluded corner. “Sit.”
Julian, on cue stepped forward bracing an arm on Leo’s shoulder, and smirked, "Hello Aunt Molly."
Theo nodded in agreement, pulling his arm back from Carina and leaning forward on the table, “He’s right Mate, and we can’t allow Daphne or Tracy to get too close before determining whether they’re friend or foe. Now I know for a fact Daphne’s family is pro Dark side but subtle observation over the years has told me there is a distinct possibility that she doesn’t share their views. Tracy is her best friend, has been since first year, she’s been a bit more involved in the whispers of possible Death Eater recruits, but that could be because she feels she has no other option. Millie and I will do some covert digging to see if we can’t get some more insight and if the information warrants further action we’ll bring it to you.”
Harry’s breath hitched as he attempted to force himself to calm down, “My Aunt and Uncle… and their… Son.” He forced out, frowning as he took deep even breaths, it seemed to be helping a bit.
Sirius blinked, looking dazed for a second before grinning, "Oh yeah, Lettie, real firecracker that one, how is she?"
"Julian then," Carina soothed, she liked it better anyway, Ronald was too… annoying for her taste. Julian fit her strategic friend quite nicely.
I didnt want to have to do an AN but i figured you all deserved an explanation.
“You, Carina, and Julian will receive one as well, as I said… it’s a family tradition.” Leo agreed, nodding stiffly. Draco frowned he planned to brand his family? Though he had to admit the perks of the sigil more than made up for the pain it would cause.
Draco and Blaise shared a look, this was not what they were expecting when they decided to follow Carina and Theo. They’d walked into something twisted and real. They’d initially believed Leo and his friends to be acting out, due to something small and unimportant. But thinking back on the feast and the accusations made against the Headmaster… they’d stepped into a war, a war just as real as the one Draco’s Father was tangled in.
“WHAT?” everyone demanded, their disbelief ringing loudly in their ears.
"Good, moving on." Leo smirked, as he paused in front of a door that wasn’t there a moment ago, silently thanking the Marauders for their map, and short cuts.
xXxXHPxDMXxXx
Leo scowled eyes darting between the evil girls, “You two are treading on thin ice.”
Harry rolled his eyes sighing heavily before giving Draco a hard look. Studying the boys face, he had to look again. Harry took a calculated step forward eyes never leaving the blondes face. Draco cleared his throat and looked away shoving his hands in his pockets. Harry blinked in shock and tried to catch the blonde’s eyes.
Leo sighed, rubbing Carina’s back, “I don’t know what’s wrong with me, it’s like I can’t control myself, I can’t sleep at night and every time I see him he somehow manages to get under my skin. It’s driving me insane.”
“Draco,” Narcissa drawled coolly, as he sat down at their ornately carved dining room table for breakfast.
"Should we get Leo?" Remus asked suddenly realizing just how messy things had gotten while Dumbledore had them all brainwashed.
Hermione’s eyes filled with happy tears before she turned to face the woman again, a smile still on her face, and his hand still clenched tightly in hers. She had Family!
"Anything else you wanna spring on me?" Harry grunted looking overwhelmed all of a sudden.
Harry sighed he hated his Parents jobs. Well not so much his mothers but when the Aurors called her in he did. He mostly hated his Dad’s job. He was always worrying about them.
“I hate being compared to them, they’re awful. They constantly remind me that everything I have is because of them. Nothing I own is really mine. I hate them for it. And the rules are just… ridiculous. Malfoy’s never this, or Malfoy’s don’t do that. All of them are about things I CAN’T do. It’s… Hell.”
“I’m saying kiss me,” Harry challenged raising a mocking brow at the boy, “Unless your too embarrassed. What never kissed anyone before?”
hold all the cards in this one love.”
“Draco,” Harry murmured nervously, his eyes shining uncertainly, asking him if he’d be there for him.
“My Dad’s an Auror. As are my Godfather and my Uncle Remus, my Grandparents are also very influential members of the Ministry… I’m not scared. The fact that they all know I’m a flaming poof and support me whole-heartedly is a plus as well.” Harry smirked at the dumbfounded look on Draco’s face.
Blaise nodded slowly, eye’s colder than ice “Do you need me to ‘take care of him’?”
Petunia frowned looking worried, "Harry, you have met Violet's daughters, right?"
Sirius waved off the formality confidently, “We’ll all be spending Christmas together, call me Sirius Lord Zabini.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The potion bled into a pink color as Leo was toasting the dragonfly thoraxes, “Add until it turns red.”
Leo paused, turning to glare at the boy. Theo was too tired to back down and he braced his hand on the table to glare at the other boy, “He knows he’s getting to you, that’s why he does it. Why can’t you just admit you want him and DO something about it? You’re killing us!”
xXxXHPxDMXxXx
"You, she looks like you Hermione." Harry confirmed nervously, he hoped he wouldn’t have to spell it out, but knowing Hermione she’d already come to the same conclusion.
Julian laughed, “Right, maybe that forced relationship isn’t so forced for him anymore?”
Harry was giving his so called ‘friend’ Paul a cool glare as he held onto the Blonde defensively.
"Same, Leo's wearing himself out," Lyra frowned, deflating as she worried her bottom lip.
hadn’t been lifted.
“Harry, you know Draco would never do anything to hurt you,” Dean reminded him seriously, catching his arm to gain his attention.
“What the FUCK?!”
“Don’t be silly,” Pansy’s giggled setting the hair on Draco’s arms on edge. This bird was mad, a quick (subtle) glance around the room had Draco catching a few unmasked reactions. A pretty Red haired girl in the corner scrunched her nose at Pansy’s laughter. Two younger students flinched and hunched further over their open books. A tall solidly built young man rolled his eyes at the scene while lining up a shot at the pool table. A petite Brunette shuddered uncomfortably as she idly flipped through a book she wasn’t really reading. And an older student sneered ‘covertly’ at her back. All the other students seemed to be watching the interaction with Interest. “You and I are from the two most influential families in the whole of Slytherin. Together we rule this little kingdom-”
Harry sat up looking back at him in disbelief, “What?”
"Harry, I mean Leo" Carina greeted, looking annoyed at his lack of explanation on his new name.
Leo stood leaning against his door jam with an impassive expression on his face. Draco frowned uncertainly before looking back at the frantically struggling man who was clawing at his own door jam to prevent the blanket from dragging him back in. “HELP ME DAMMIT!”
She shared Carina’s pretty mahogany colored eyes and heart shaped face, though where Carina’s hair fell in wild bushy curls, Lyra’s fell in thick silky waves. Leo ran his hand through it thoughtfully trying to decide if it was a dark blonde or a very light brown, he couldn’t really tell.
The Dursley’s and Mr. and Mrs. Evans froze in the doorway, looking up as if just noticing he was there.
"Aw come on Boss it's funny," Julian chuckled, before taking a sip of pumpkin juice.
“You know it had to be done right? You know why I have to be a Slytherin?” Draco asked quietly, breath ghosting over the shell of Harry’s ear.
Leo’s other brow shot up in surprise, clearly he thought Draco would put up more of a fight. He rolled off the blonde and waved his hand, the invisible force pinning him in place lifted allowing the blonde a much needed stretch while pulling his pants and trousers up once more, before he rolled onto his knees his hands planting themselves on Leo’s thighs the rough muggle material under his hands an absent observation. He hesitated lowering his face toward what he could now see was a very
Harry blushed glancing at the table, “Umm, I sort of, seduced him? I wanted to! He wanted to wait but we’d been seeing each other secretly for a while and I didn’t want to wait anymore.” He lied convincingly.
"Uh huh," Potter stepped closer, eyes drifting up and down the blondes exposed body.
Draco continued on with a cold sneer on his face, “Leo kissed me then ran away like a bloody coward he left me alone to deal with that stalker Smith who came back after hearing the suit of armor fall over.”
“That was my fault,” Harry blurted out, interrupting Draco who looked like he’d been about to confess or something else incredibly stupid like that.
He rested his head on Draco’s shoulder panting lightly against his throat. “So teach me.”
Harry gasped when he felt Draco’s hand close around his slightly hard length and begin to pull. “Draco.”
Harry sighed and agreed allowing his Godfathers to lead him back to the lobby, and back home.
Draco sat across from the two warily, he wasn’t sure what to expect from the newly discovered twins. If Malfoy wasn’t a Slytherin, and hadn’t spent the last four years watching the trio, he wouldn’t have noticed the subtle differences in the two girls. Granger’s hair was a shade darker and a bit shorter. Her eyes a tad rounder, complexion a bit paler, she stood a quarter of an inch taller as well.
Leo was losing his mind.
“Find out?” George finished.
Lyra laughed hugging her cousin tightly, Julian and Carina shook their heads at the grim look on their friend/cousins face. “I’m serious.” He insisted.
“Happy Birthday,” Harry joked in relief frowning when Draco pulled away again.
“You both must swear an oath that you won’t reveal anything we tell you, an oath of Silence.” Leo warned the two. Both girls nodded moving forward to make the oath.
Tracy paused looking surprised.
Mikhail shrugged smirk still in place as he saluted Orion causing the girl to laugh again. He settled beside Cho and a few of her friends, she shot Harry a nasty look before engaging Mikhail in conversation. The side looks she shot Harry, and Mikhail’s slowly darkening expression was all he needed to guess at the topic.
“Do it Malfoy,” Lyra insisted pointedly as they stood up to leave. “Oh and one word of advice,” Lyra turned to look at him.
Fred and George frowned uncertainly, “Is it true you’re our Cousin.” They chorus unintentionally for once.
"Julian," Carina sighed pulling him into a hug. He cried into her shoulder, cried for himself, cried for his childhood, but most of all he cried for-
“Truthfully? Your Hot, I’m selfish, and I don’t know there is just something really sexy about a Hot bloke spilling his life story out on my bed. But seriously, I want to get to know you. Yeah it’s really a physical attraction now but that’s honestly how most couples start. They see someone attractive and decide they want to get to know them.”
"The Marauders were neutral, he wanted us on his side, I remember everything now," Remus snarled, as the images flooded his brain. The Picture was the trigger. He handed the photo to Sirius and watched as his friend began to remember.
Harry was right now. She’d always believed her son was as happy as he could be, but seeing him now she knew. Harry wasn’t truly happy until he found Draco, and she’d be forever thankful for that day.
“Well done Ms Davis I’m impressed by your devotion to our cause, but tell me, why we should allow you to join us?” Leo drawled transfiguring a chair at an empty desk into a plush silk armchair and taking a seat. Millie cast a cleaning charm on the desk and leaned against it at his side.
Sirius deflated slightly, "Oh yeah, Merlin I forgot… what about the girls?"
In the weeks following Blaise and Leo’s alliance he’d seen the boy a mere handful of times, none of which offered the opportunity to sit and talk as the taller boy had promised. Now with winter break fast approaching Draco was growing frustrated.
Leo set a steady rhythm grinding repeatedly against Draco's hips causing the boy to pant and gasp helplessly in his arms.
Carina was the one to answer, “If you must know Malfoy, my cousin and I aren’t exactly speaking at present and it’s more than a little uncomfortable sitting in silence while they speak.”
Zacharias swallowed thickly a cold sweat break out on his forehead, as the other boy calmly washed his hands. He flinched when the taps were turned off and the icy gaze rested on him once again.
Hermione- Carina Aurora Black (Harry's Cousin)
Carina smirked at the stunned look on Malfoy’s face, and the jealous scowl on her boyfriends face. “Lovely, now if I may… when did you meet my sister?”
Daphne did her best to distance herself from the angry Slytherins. She stuck close to Draco who’d long ago distanced himself from the group. He’d throw concerned glances at Tracy, who’d been ordered to work with someone from their group in classes, and angry glares at Leo. He smoothly ignored the boy, by focusing on whoever he was working with.
Sorry :(
I please to you. You did after all claim to be mine.”
“Lose the slacks first,” He panted out, he wasn’t going to be naked while Draco still had his slacks on.
"No you’re not," Sirius and Leo chorused, unyielding expressions fixed firmly on their faces.
The blonde felt a mildly embarrassed flush fill his cheeks, it amazed him how the older boy could make such an innocent statement sound so intimate. “Okay,” He murmured still breathless from the kiss. The wicked grin this elicited from the raven had him feeling as if he’d just made a deal with the Devil. But honestly, as the boy sealed the promise with a kiss, Draco truly couldn’t care less.
“And we’ll decide if she can help us later,” Millie drawled in annoyance as if Tracy were testing her patience. She sipped her pumpkin juice, as she flipped through her Transfiguration text. “Now we eat, I’m not going to babysit you.”
"Aw Draco are you okay," Leo smirked looking calm as usual.
Harry scowled rubbing at his face roughly as he leaned heavily against the table. Was he really going to do this, with that complete prat? He was sort of acting like the same guy. Was this the real Draco or was he just compensating for his vulnerability last night?
“Come on guys let’s give them a minute.” Julian sighed. The couch squeaked as his weight was lifted from it and Leo listened to their retreating steps. He sighed raising his head after he heard the door close and lock.
HPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDMHPDM
Harry rubbed his eyes, “He’s gonna be okay?”
Hermione wrinkled her nose and shoved his hand out of her face, "Gross Ronald. Anyway Harry, I can only imagine what you’re going through, I mean first you’re a muggle, then your half-wizard, and now you’re a pureblood? You must be so confused. What do you plan to do now?"
Julian smirked, and mate, “I could be waiting for you….” He paused letting the notion sit for a moment, Draco’s interest seemed to pique as he raised an eyebrow. “Or I could be waiting for Nott and Bulstrode.” Julian finished.
“And where do you think you’re taking me Potter?” Draco deadpanned, scowling after the stupidly smug fool.
Leo glared at her, feeling rage boiling in his gut. He wasn’t sure what this overwhelming urge to boil Nott alive in a cauldron of untreated bubotuber pus.
Blaise leaned back in the chair, raising a curious brow.
“Yeah,” was all he could come up with, he had no idea what to say to them in that moment.
“Draco!” Harry cried, as Charles and Jonathan Evan’s attempted to pull the Teenager off the rapidly suffocating man. Draco had him by the throat… maybe, probably, he wasn’t exactly positive through all the chin rolls.
Sirius nodded not seeming happy either, "And you would have grown up as a pureblood more exposed to the prejudice against muggles, he wanted you for muggles. He didn't want to take any chances."
“What do you mean, is something wrong, Harry what’s going on?” Draco felt so confused, was something happening he needed to know about? Were his Aunt and Uncle trying to take him away and make him their Son? WHAT WAS HAPPENING?
As he paced a wicked plan began forming in his mind and he slowed to a stop.
“No,” Leo breathed forcing the boy back into the kiss, pressing his body flush against the blonde, holding his head in place with a hand in his hair. Draco moaned weakly, his fingers curling in the hair at the base of the boys’ neck. He grunted as a knee slide between his legs rubbing teasingly against his burning need. Leo rolled his hips little groaning as he pulled away, “You’re such a bloody tease.”
“No he’s still healing, but your Birthday’s coming soon so I thought I’d come home. Who’s this?” She asked suspiciously.
“Draco I want it!” Harry begged, face buried in the sheets as he begged.
Draco scoffed though he felt a bit of pride swell in his chest, “I’ve been waiting for that moment for years, it’s a bit anticlimactic actually.” He admitted, frowning lightly.
“In any case,” Leo turned to Julian and Lyra, “Keep an eye on Bulstrode and Nott. If we can’t trust them at all we’ll turn them away. If we can… well we’ll have some solid Allies.”
Dudley Dursley,… Could you even
Ron- Julian Michael Prewett (Fabian Prewett's Only son)
The Dwarf pulled the sleigh to a halt, barking a call out to the pups. The playing stopped as a much larger Hippogriff wandered over to the baby dripping its head to nuzzle its neck. One of the pups gave a parting bark before the three of them charged the sleigh. The Dwarf knocked his staff against the side of his seat causing a long carpet to unravel magically forming stairs for the three, now identifiable Crup, puppies to climb. The Dwarf grumbled in annoyance as the pups yipped excitedly, dual tails wagging, bouncing around him. Batting the Crups into the seat beside him, as the carpet magically rolled itself back up, he mumbled curses adjusting himself in his seat. With a loud crack of the reigns, the Reindeer were off again.
"Save me a seat okay," Lyra smiled, the resemblance was definitely more pronounce now.
The glass doors at the far end lead to a round pool sized bathtub built into the floor, three pocket doors near the door lead to toilets and sinks the size of small walk in closets. Shower stalls were located on the other side of the door. Draco wandered back into the main room curiously opening the double doors beside the bathroom. A it was a closet full of sinfully soft black robes, towels and comfortable rubber shower shoes.
Leo sighed in aggravated impatience, “What? What am I forgetting?”
“So now that we’ve had time to relax and have a bit of fun, I must insist we discuss at the very least our two possible recruits.” Julian threw in lazily, but a conflicted frown tugged at his lips.
Harry patted the boy’s knee comfortingly. Draco probably forgot who he was talking too. He was probably thinking out loud. Draco sat up quickly looking Harry right in the eye. “That’s another reason we probably shouldn’t see each other.” He mused thoughtfully his eyes trailing down to Harry’s lips.
“Well don’t let me stop you, I’m just relaxing,” Draco informed him. “Hop in… or not, your choice Potter.”
“We did knock,” Theo smirked rapping his knuckles mockingly against the bookshelf he stood next to.
Hermione cleared her throat primly and shot him a stern look, “I was merely looking out for my friends best interest, can’t have him dating prejudices berks that will try to control whom he’s friends with.”
Lyra sighed shaking her head at her Cousin and Uncles antics. It was far too late in the evening for this. It was time for bed.
Leo nodded, pointedly ignoring the Couples actions, “And we’ll all keep an eye out during classes in between.”
“This is amazing,” Draco murmured softly, lacing his fingers with Leo’s over his stomach.
…Draco…Kissing…………
Harry spent the next morning, anxiously distracted. He knew he had Sirius worried, but he couldn’t help doubting Draco’s sincerity. Would he really come back, or was last night just a bit of fun? Now that he’d had time to think, he realized how reckless last night had been, not that he regretted it. Merlin knows he could never regret something that good. He sat at the kitchen table, after Sirius went home, pushing his Sheppard’s pie around on his plate. Harry couldn’t help but feel silly, sulking over someone he didn’t even really know. Regardless, he was sort of disappointed.
Carina launched herself out of Leo's lap and into Sirius' to hug him. She had an Uncle. Maybe the loving Parent fantasy was out of her reach, but a loving Uncle was just as good right? She hoped he couldn’t sense how desperately she wanted this. A loving family… that wasn’t too selfish of her right? She just wanted to feel loved.
“Please that Prat hated me before that,” Harry grumbled, snaking his hands under Draco’s jacket and around his waist, and snuggled into his chest.
Carina glanced at Blaise, before dropping her gaze when she’d managed to meet his gaze, “He’d like to speak with you personally if you’d be willing.”
“Shh, we aren’t there yet!” Leo hushed him rudely before leaning over and whispering something to the statue.
Draco shook his head looking wary, “I highly doubt they’d approve-”
Harry folded the jacket neatly hiding it carefully in his trunk before pulling the box from earlier toward him. Reaching in he found the Lockets from earlier and pulled them out to examine. One of the lockets was silver in the shape of a heart carved to look like wings, and the other was a dull gunmetal color in the shape of an oval with a floral design carved into it. He opened the heart and nearly lost his breath at the picture of his mother at seventeen wrapped in his seventeen year old fathers arms. The two covered their eyes peering out of the picture curiously before waving happily at Harry. He swallowed thickly fighting back tears as he closed the locket setting them aside. He reached in again pulling out the velvet box, which turned out to be a wedding band. Engraved with the name Violet. Harry frowned assuming Violet was his Grandmother. Petunia never talked about her parents, they’d passed a few months before his parents. Harry didn’t even know his Grandparents names. He carefully replaced the ring in its box and hid it, lovingly wrapped in his Fathers cloak, in his trunk.
I'M SOOOOO SORRY! This chapter took ALOT longer than I thought, there are still a few parts i'm torn on, but I wanted to put something up.
“Like my eyes do you?” Draco chuckled in amusement.
Draco pursed his lips, resisting the urge to bait the man further. Obviously this man had attempted to get a job in a predominantly Pureblood Supremacist field and been road blocked. Draco grunted as the Professor snatched up the front of his robes effectively choking him. Causing the blonde to wheeze as he tried to take in a breath, but the Professor was bigger and heavier, and used it against him.
Leo was quite for a moment, “What are you doing here?” Leo demanded.
Draco frowned seeming to have an internal debate before stepping toward him cautiously, “If you had been waiting for me, hypothetically of course, (“Of course”) what business would you have had?”
"Prewett, I insist." Julian interrupted boldly, he didn’t care who Dumbledore thought he was he would address them appropriately.
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
Leo led them to an abandoned classroom and entered first, Tracy paused allowing Millicent to follow before her before entering herself.
“Hello Draco, it was absolutely boring,” Harry smiled happily turning to the doorway, “I want you to meet some people.”
Millie shrugged, ignoring the tiny redhead (strawberry blonde- Daphne would correct indignantly) “I haven’t heard anything either.”
Adrian brushed his arm with Draco’s covertly gaining his attention as they strolled calmly through the main common room, murmuring softly, “Relax Malfoy, I was the only one who saw you two.”
Carina chuckled darkly, stepping around Leo, "You say it's because of our shared blood, wouldn't it have been easier, better even to have kept us together." she smirked when Dumbledore faltered and didn't answer.
"Rae stop he hates that, and no we’re quite serious." Carina sighed, using the nickname Sirius gave her sister.
“DRACO!!!!!!!!” Harry cried, releasing all over their chests.
Julian frowned looking her over with a frustrated calculating gaze, “I’ve always prided myself on being able to read people. To be honest the fact that I can’t read you is rather, troublesome, but somehow incredibly …. Sexy. I won’t push you too tell me, after all I do love a challenge, though I thought it only fair to warn you.”
“Sirius, Rem’s looking for you, something about his shoes?”
Leo ignored his so-called family as they laughed and mocked him at lunch on Monday.
Tinsel smoothed out a shirt in his truck not meeting his gaze. “Master Draco is not to be worrying. Tinsel is a Good Elf. Not be saying anything about Masters trips, Or about…” Tinsel looks around with wide eyes before blinking up at him.
The girls giggled and cooed while Ron and Seamus laughed loudly on either side of him. Huffing in annoyance Harry squirmed off the bed batting away Ron and Hermione’s attempts at stopping him and attempted to slink away mulishly.
Ron- Julian Michael Prewett (Fabian Prewett's Only son)
Draco smirked rubbing himself lightly through his boxers as he waited for Harry to catch his breath, “So you’ll last longer.”
Malfoy groaned, looking away as if he regretted stopping in the first place, “I HAVE forgiven you and I TOLD you, you had nothing to be sorry FOR!”
“Leo in private Theo, we’re all on the same side here. You both have seen beneath the masks and haven’t betrayed us yet. I think you’ve earned the right.” Leo smiled lightly holding out his hand to shake the other boys.
"That is not the point here Padfoot, show some manner of decorum." Remus scolded, looking at his old friend reproachfully.
Five minutes later the two girls crept quietly out of their dorm and to the fire sitting in their own chairs not bothered by his state of undress, as they were pretty much the same.
Lyra lifted a hand to rub her neck before grinning at him, "Your passion for the truth gave me chills."
The others stared at him in disbelief while Draco dropped his napkin to rub the bridge of his nose with his thumb as he usually did when he thought Harry did or said something particularly stupid or foolish.
"Malfoy I presume?" He smirked, expecting a sharply spoken insult, or a scathing comment about his friends. His nerves were getting the best of him and he needed a good row right now. It never came.
Draco glanced up from applying the salve to his friends bleeding hand, “Potter.” He needn’t say more as Professors Snape’s lip curled in disgust.
“Really,” Millicent smirked, an evil glint in her eye, “You’re so lost for her.”
Leo faltered having expected Malfoy would through a tantrum or something, “You're testing the potion tomorrow, no backing out, no excuses. I’m not going to let you force me into testing another potion AGAIN just because you don’t want to.” Leo stated firmly, feeling off balanced by Malfoy's reasonable attitude.
Draco smirked at the mix of emotions on Leo’s handsome face. He couldn’t wait to have him all to himself. Draco sauntered out of the bathroom and down the hall it seemed like Leo’s friends would be helpful after all.
But what he did know… he couldn’t wait to spend this holiday with Leo. He wondered what the boy was like in his own domain. Was he more relaxed? Blaise mentioned he wore a mask at school, would he at home? He guessed he’d have to see.
“So what’s on the agenda then?” Theo asked curiously, he’d never actually just hung out with a Gryffindor. Well aside from Carina, but that was mainly just talking and getting to know each other. Gryffindors could be unusually trusting, it had been one of the many things he’d come to admire about the girl. So much so that the moment she’d shared her insecurities, and inevitably the reason behind them, he’d nearly stormed out of the Castle to find and kill the girl’s former ‘parents’. Unfortunately that wasn’t a possibility at present. Instead he’d been urging the girl to confide in her Sister and Cousin he hadn’t had much luck, as Carina was adamantly against the idea.
Vernon on the other hand looked like he was about to have a seizure, while Dudley just looked floored at his Mothers behavior. Harry could understand, his Aunt NEVER spoke about magic, and she NEVER had anything good to say about his Mum.
“Wait,” Carina demanded, pinching the bridge of her nose in annoyance “Start from the beginning.”
"Looking for someone," Leo called, when most of the students were seated.
Theo caught her hand under the table, holding it tightly, but outwardly showed no fear. Zabini gave a curt nod to Malfoy who was watching him subtly from the corner of his eye. “Of course, I’ll meet you in the library after classes.”
Carina flinched back, covering her ears, this was hitting very close to home. Leo growled ripping her hands away from her ears and shaking her by them, “Don’t try to fucking ignore me Carina! You don’t get to bury your bloody head in the sand! How dare you make baseless accusations against me! I thought you knew me better than that, I thought you’d care enough to bloody well ASK me instead of making your own mind up about me!”
Sirius and Remus were looking at him sternly.
Leo was desperate.
“Well I’m not going to let you shag me until it is!” Draco insisted a bit hysterically he’d admit, but could you blame him?
Sirius sat heavily in the Chair next to the fire, listening to the softly murmured conversation in the kitchen. This was not what he’d been expecting when he’d decided to come and check on Harry again today. His godson had been distracted as of late and he’d been worried. He took a sip of tea and watched the flames dance, trying to decide on what to do.
Harry sighed in annoyance, catching the tennis ball he’d been tossing against the wall. It was junked at the start of summer, along with the rest of the sports equipment the Dursley’s had bought Dudley, in an attempt to get him to exercise. Harry had rescued a few things to keep himself entertained until Dumbledore deemed it ‘safe’ to ‘rescue’ him.
“No!” Draco insisted shaking his head minutely, this was the last thing he needed this morning.
Jonathan merely looked disgusted, “and look what our Daughter and that Man have turned him into! He’s a Bloody psychopath! Every time you drag these two families into the same house he tries to hurt Harry again. There’s no reason, no provocation, he just
Draco chuckled, pulling the slightly resistant boy closer, “Well I’m going to teach you how to be a proper bed partner,” Harry scowled at the older boy’s smug smirk, “and you’re going to teach me how to be a boyfriend.”
Leo shrugged, looking more relaxed then they’d seen in a while “No agenda, let’s just go with the flow. I’ll follow you all. You want me to relax, let’s do something relaxing, fun, and spontaneous. I’m up for anything.”
Draco nearly gapped at the raven haired teen, did he seriously just ask a Mobsters heir to help rebuild the Government… was he Mad?
“That doesn’t say much, don’t do anything Cari wouldn’t do!” Lyra teased darting out of the room at her sisters indignant compliant. Her twin fast on her heels, the others following at a more sedated pace.
“Lord Potter I do believe we have an agreement,” Blaise finally decided, smirking at the huff of annoyance Lyra released, and the shocked expression on Draco’s face.
“Your old House Elf Dobby,” Carina pressed looking a bit confused. She would have thought the Blonde knew about it, unless Lucius kept it hidden.
“Yeah,” Harry murmured quietly attempting to burrow deeper into Draco’s warmth.
“My memory works fine Cara, you ran into me when you weren’t looking.” Blaise smirked, seemingly amused as Lyra puffed up indignantly.
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
“I’m impressed,” Leo admitted as he stood, “But tell me, why so interested in our cause? Do either of you even know what we stand for?”
“The Prewitts and Weasley’s have always been close,… Aunt Myrtle definitely would have said something.” Charlie agreed frowning at the carpet beneath his feet.
McGonagall looked at the list in shock, "Lyra Black." She paled.
“I could put an emphasis on my mouth. Just completely lose the filter with everyone else. Make them lose patience.” Millicent offered, quietly, eyeing Leo as if he may explode at her.
Holding his arm patiently Leo offered an encouraging smile, as he glided effortlessly in front of the boy. “Think of it like flying, just breath and glide, lean when you want to turn.” Gently easing the boy from his arm, he took both his hands in his own and guided him forward. Smiling as the boy muttered insults at him for ‘showing off’.
“Just one goal that brought us all together. Dumbledore. That manipulative, self-important, narcissistic, megalomaniac.” Leo seethed, gritting his teeth, “And you’re all too busy acting like children to focus on the actual PLAN!” Leo’s magic lashed out splintering the table they were at in half. The girls screamed jumping back while the guys tried to shield them. They turned to look at their angry leader warily.
"Dreaming about boss Malfoy?" Theo chuckled, a mocking edge to his tone. He hadn’t been pleased to learn the brunette was spending more time with his future lover than Draco himself was.
Leo sighed rubbing his temples. He was getting tired of all the crap his fight with Malfoy was bringing down on him. It was seriously taking a toll on his revenge plans as well. No one was focusing on the plan at all!
Hermione- Carina Aurora Black (Harry's Cousin)
“Alright then… I’ll just… stop bothering you then, yeah?” Malfoy shoved his hands in his pockets defensively and took a step back.
“Well I love a man with a wild side,” the girl could not flirt fluttering her eyes to much to the point that he thought she might have a twitch of sorts. She was trying way too hard to sound sexy, her voice taking on a nasally tone.
Leo hummed pressing a light kiss to his temple quickly before looking away. Draco could tell he was trying hard, he knew it must be difficult, trying to ignore the discomfort he was feeling. The blonde appreciated the sentiment but he didn’t want to b=push the other boy so he didn’t press him.
A mask settled firmly over his expression as he nodded tightly at the red head before stalking quickly away. “100 points from Gryffindor for conspiring to skip Detention, and Filch will see you at eight tonight sharp Mr. Prewett.”
"I'm sorry I called you all mad," The girl smiled clearly embarrassed, though no one could really blame her.
Julian waved him off, “Calm down Boss you should be use to the accusations by now, and besides, Julius Archibald is STILL in the hospital growing Fungus. If you weren’t jealous of him dating Malfoy go slip him the antidote and free the poor bastard when the Nurse is in the store room doing inventory.”
Sirius glanced at him, with large wounded eyes, “She’s my Baby Brothers Baby Remmy.” He insisted sorrowfully.
Harry- Leo Harry-James Potter
“I think you should test it.” He decided watching Malfoy carefully, he was expecting a quick refusal and an arguement.
Draco shrugged, “Like I said Potter, your choice.”
“Expecting someone else Kitten?” Draco asked looking amused, though there was an almost imperceptible edge to his voice that gave him away.
“Fine then Weasley,” Draco scoffed coldly, turning his attention back to his plate. Harry and his friends started in surprise at the tension emanating between the two as Ron returned the cold retort with one of his own. “Do what you want Malfoy.”
“Don’t be rude Draco,” Harry scolded, looking unimpressed.
“I don’t think I will, see…. You’ve been a little tease for months Kitten... You look absolutely delicious Love and I’m starving.” The dark glint in the older boys eyes had Draco shivering in a curious mix of fear and excitement.
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
Hermione- Carina Aurora Black (Harry's Cousin)
Harry scowled and allowed his head to bang against the wall behind him.
Malfoy nodded putting out the flames and taking the now green potion off the burner and carrying it over to the Professor.
“Really think I’m gonna like it rough,” Harry panted, his body thrilled at being manhandled so much.
“Like what, Cara*” Blaise smirked, leaning his chin on his hand nonchalantly.
Hermione- Carina Aurora Black (Harry's Cousin)
“It’s not her personality they didn’t like malŭk, it was her ruined status. You see Drumstrang was very different from here. Everything was about status or talent. Even the teachers would treat you differently. Aside from Draco and I there were only two other people who didn’t care about her status.”
I want you to know that no matter what the circumstances I will always be on your side. You are my brother and I will always care for you.
“Merlin,” she breathed, with her hand over her heart, as she looked at the album in wonder.
Bloody Hell he’d missed his family.
Draco scowled, “You’re not funny, look they’re more reason why we shouldn’t were neighbors, do you even realize how screwed up I am, Lucius is a mad man, I’m not subjecting someone to that.”
He could see Malfoy practically gapping in shock, but 'Malfoy's don't gape' so…
. Carina darted into the room and the sound was lowered drastically. Julian sighed before ushering them in before him.
Julian strolled past them smirking and WINKING at Pansy as he passed. Draco scowled after the bold fool in annoyance. He’d heard the rumors surrounding Hogwarts newly dubbed ‘Sex God’ he wasn’t sure how much of it was true but he was planning to keep the cretin far away from his friend.
“No, don’t even,” Leo scoffed, his eyes angry and guarded, “you should’ve talked to me about this, asked me, instead you thought you’d come to your own conclusions. You think you know me so well… we may be cousins Carina, but that doesn’t mean we know exactly what the others thinking.”
“She speaks ill of a friend for the way he was born, I’m uncomfortable around such prejudice, and ignorance so I should really move.” He explained tightly, expression darkening as the girl scoffed.
During the time he was trying to get Malfoy, and by extension his friends, to forgive him. He’d seen Malfoy talking to Carina about Charms, actually asking for her help in the class. He’d seen him playing chess with Julian in the library. He’d even seen him talking to Lyra at lunch, just talking about nothing in particular. Theo mentioned that he’d been tutoring first years in potions giving Leo a pointed look as if daring him to comment. Carina admitted that he was helping her with Arithmancy. She still didn’t look at him, as she was talking to Millicent.
“Draco wait!” Smith called out turning the corner and stopping in front of the suit of armor to catch his breath. “Where…?”
So sorry I've been MIA all year. I had to take some time away. I no it's not really much of an excuse, but I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and My Therapist Suggested I stay away for a while until I was sure I could handle being back. I took the time to heal even took the time away from writing to just focus on healing. I'm hoping I can get back into the swing of things and if anyone's still with the story I thank you for the loyalty. I have every intention of continuing both of my stories, i'm just trying to fight through the block I've encountered after being gone for so long. I have to remember where I wanted these stories to go and i'm trying to see if I can incorporate any of the idea's that have sprung up after rereading my works. Thank you for your loyalty and understanding. I Hope you continue to support my stories to the very end, if I've already lost you thank you for your support thus far.
"My first day at a new school," Lyra hummed to herself running a brush gently through her hair, as she gazed at herself in her Vanity mirror.
Leo flushed looking away from the others, had he really gotten angry at the other blokes over Malfoy. Was he really that agitated about being ignored? Because obviously it wasn’t jealousy, he couldn’t be gay… he just couldn’t.
Draco slowly pushed in making sure Harry was relaxed as he went, before waiting for Harry.
Draco grunted throwing her an annoyed scowl as he pulled the smaller teen into his lap wrapping his arms around him defensively, “No.”
Draco rolled his eyes at his possessive boyfriend, though he knew he’d act the same if the situation were reversed. Feeling safe introducing himself to the muggle teenagers, Draco stuck out his hand to the boy, “I’m Draco, Harry’s boyfriend.”
Leo scowled feeling even more on edge. He quickly reached over and closed Malfoy’s notebook firmly. Malfoy pulled his hands back quickly so they wouldn’t get caught and looked at Leo questioningly.
“I come in peace.”
“What the fuck?” he demanded through his teeth. Leo tilted his head eyeing the fuming blond in amusement, he reminded Leo of a grumpy child who missed his nap. He smirked deciding it was probably better if he didn’t share that with the other boy.
Blaise raised a brow in amusement, “Let me guess, it’s about that bellino little rebellion of yours.” He smirked, were these fools serious? Did they truly understand what they’d be getting into?
“So it makes things a bit easier,” Blaise continued eyeing his clenched fist, “We’ll keep your secrets Malfoy, we’ll even help you smuggle Potter down now and then, “But in return you keep our secrets and have our back when we need it.”
The next few days went the same as Leo tried his hardest to avoid the obsessed Slytherin. But Malfoy seemed determined. In the end Leo decided he had a very annoying completely mental stalker in the form of his rival and most hated fellow student.
Zabini quirked a brow in surprise the rest of his face unreadable, “And did I misread the situation Signora?” he drawled slowly, taking a small threatening step toward her.
Julian whistled obviously impressed, “The Cave Inimicum Charm is essentially a ward. Though it doesn’t keep anyone out for long, it merely gives the castor time to either escape or hide whatever incriminating evidence they’re trying to hide in the first place. Right useful Charm to have.”
Sam shifted awkwardly, he must look like such an idiot right now. The other man sighed heavily.
“Um… sounds… appetizing?”
Julian quirked a brow, “Okay, so why are you sulking in here, licking your wounds? Who’d you piss off?”
Draco scowled staring him dead in the eye as he undid his belt tossing it to the floor before shaking the slacks of and onto the floor. He raised a brow as Harry eyed his black silk boxer that cover impressive (If he did say so himself) bulge. Harry swallowed nervously before nodding. Draco crawled back over to him settling between his legs and once again grabbing the elastic of his pants. He forcefully yanked them down and lifting Harry’s legs yanked them off. “Last Chance.” Draco warned eyeing Harry’s impressive size appreciatively.
Pansy nodded hesitantly, flicking her eyes over to Julian.
The blonde hissed under his breath to avoid any unwanted attention, “
Theo blinked in surprise before reaching out and shaking the taller boy’s hand, “Alright then… Leo.”
Blaise smirked grimly at him, before revealing his wand twirling it in his fingers, “You know me too well.”
2 My Sister anounced on New Years Eve that she was Pregnant and having a Boy!
“How… do you know all that?” Leo asked bewildered, eyes studying the blondes face in wonder.
Harry was watching Draco worriedly the boy had fallen back on his bed hands folded beneath his head as his eyes scanned the posters on his ceiling. The boy looked so angry.
“Excuse you,” Orion barked smacking him round the head herself.
Theo cleared his throat awkwardly, "Um, Potter."
Hermione- Carina Aurora Black (Harry's Cousin)
Julian chuckled lightly. Professor Snape was ‘scolding a student’ not too far away, and it was obvious by the tick of muscle near his eyes and in his clenched jaw, he was restraining himself from rolling his eyes. Julian really couldn’t blame him though, these two girls were far too easy to manipulate, far too easy indeed. The second girl huffed and latched onto his other arm.
“Your cousin kissed me Black,” he deadpanned. Theo and Carina stared at him with dumb struck expressions on their faces.
Leo handed over three measures of flying seahorses, “Heat until it turns green then we let it sit overnight.”
Draco sighed as he finished putting away the last of his books. Feeling a weight land on his shoulder he spun around reaching for his wand.
"Excuse me," Harry's voice rose. He had no idea what to do, his world was tumbling down around him and he had no way of stopping it.
"What!" The two demanded in disbelief, the old man had hid her in plain sight!
Harry frowned clearly disgruntled by this information, “so you’re just going to play with me until I can keep up?”
Twin- Lyra Amalthea Black (Carina's sister)
Leo led him off the path and towards the woods near the shrieking shack, for a moment Draco had the sinking feeling that Leo was taking him there. Not a very romantic spot for a first date, Draco had thought sullenly. Only to be led in a different direction. His breath caught as they broke the tree line and entered a vast clearing. Soft light from faeries lit the snow covered plains, the small frozen waterfall glows a soft green as the tiny creatures danced around it in merriment. The snow looked soft and undisturbed, the scene was pure innocence.
(See the end of the chapter for
Leo was stiff as a board as he stared at the other boy in stunned disbelief. The students around them were gapping in shock by the end of it. Malfoy was glaring at him and panting heavily after his outburst. He ran an agitated hand through his hair giving Leo one last surly look before spinning on his heel and stalking off.
“I don’t know what to do!” Draco pleaded with the older raven haired man.
He didn’t get to sleep until eight thirty.
Over the next few days, Sirius was conspicuously present from morning until night, never giving the boys a moment to themselves. The second Draco arrived he’d call after them to leave the door open. The boys would shift awkwardly and agree.
“Merely stating an observation Boss,” Daphne defended innocently after dodging the pillow, a coy smile on her lips.
Julian nodded raising his cup of tea in agreement, expression still grim.
Theo sighed but didn’t move away, “Leo, your scaring Lyra, Carina can’t even look at you without wanting to cry, you’re their Cousin and they feel like their losing you to this.”
“Now,” Julian confirmed grimly, “We need to be on guard with these things the second they make themselves known, we can’t allow for any possible missteps. Especially when dealing with Slytherins, they’re a lot more observant and adapt at reading between the lines. And body language is essentially a second language for them.”
The Gryffindors stared at him skeptically, and Mikhail was sort of relieved they didn’t shout their surprise as he half expected them to. He’d have to give them more credit next time.
She paused realizing a moment later, “That bloody prick didn’t even apologize!”
Draco’s fist clenched in frustration, it was just his luck the first Slytherin he’d run into could see through his mask, though he’d no idea how. Even Lucius and Narcissa didn’t know the depth of his hatred for them, now he’d have to shut this bastard up, with a flick of his wrist his wand was in his hand. The other boys’ eyes followed the movement with an amused chuckle.
“No,” Draco chuckled kissing the boy softly, “You’re completely normal.”
Ron- Julian Michael Prewett (Fabian Prewett's Only son)
…. Julian should probably warn Theo about their Uncle…. The poor boy should know what to expect when Sirius was told about his oldest niece’s new boyfriend.
The moment the thought crossed his mind a cool slick chill slid inside coating his insides, causing him to wriggle and squirm in mild discomfort. He flinched as a thick calloused finger prodded his hole insistently. “Leo!”
“Weasley?!” Draco jumped in fright, looking around wildly, as if wondering where he’d come from.
“Leo.” Bugger!
“Hm,” her mother hummed absentmindedly.
“Leo, Leo, look at me!” Draco laughed joyfully heading straight toward him, his smile faltered as he grew closer. “Leo? How do I Stop!!?”
“Merlin Draco forget it,” Harry blushed covering himself with the blanket, “ ‘S not like it matters, everything you do is seductive.”
“What was that for?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another pause, “I see that.”
Julian chuckled as Lyra flopped huffily onto the couch beside him, shoving his book to the floor and dropping her head into his lap. He sat for a moment staring at the wall, asking himself what he could’ve possibly done to deserve such difficulties in life, before giving up and running a hand over her hair soothingly, “What happened?”
Malfoy glanced at him out of the corner of his eye, “Did you want to do the Prep work or did you want to do the actual brewing part of this potion?”
“Ravenclaw!” The hat shouted decisively.
Draco was grabbing at him desperately trying to find something to hold onto, putting up just enough of a fight to make Leo crazy.
“Did something happen?” Dean asked cautiously of his two friends.
Draco’s eye twitched, hearing what he expected were House elves, refer to him as such. Blaise pursed his lips and clenched his jaw doing well in hiding his amusement. Pansy had no such luck and burst in a fit of hysterical giggling fit.
“WHAT?” She bellowed back in annoyance.
Leo walked into Potions cautiously. He hadn’t seen Malfoy at all since they’d last spoke. Julian, Carina, and Lyra followed him in talking quietly. They’d been acting a bit strange the last few days. If he wasn’t feeling so tired he’d be suspicious.
“Ah, Ah, AH, DRA, CO! PL, EASE! M, ORE!” Harry practically yelled repeating himself getting louder and more vocal with each bob and twirl of his tongue.
Leo moved to the high back chair with its back to the wall, “would you care to take my seat Zabini? I’m sure it’s preferable to standing.”
Twin- Lyra Amalthea Black (Carina's sister)
"Aw Honey don't be like that." Ginny cooed, forcing herself into his lap, and wrapping his arms around her. She wrapped her other arm around his neck attempting to kiss him. “You’ll like being my man.”
"Their Uncle, your distant uncle sort of… I think."
“Peaceful,” Leo murmured in agreement, squeezing his hand gently, “I love Hogsmeade at night, I wanted to share this with you.”
"Leo Potter is the perfect fit for me and I will have him," Draco sneered, feeling suddenly defensive of his nonexistent relationship with the boy.
Malfoy did a double take when Leo dropped himself heavily into the seat beside him. Leo tossed his bag to the side next to his chair and turned to glared at Malfoy who raised his eyebrows questioningly.
Leo yelped and jumped behind the nearest student… who was a very small first year girl.
“Are you serious?” Draco breathed floored by the kindness of the usually stern sounding woman.
Leo’s gaze was smoldering, eyes hooded appealingly as he lazily studied Draco’s face, the hand on around his waist wandering his lower back. Draco flushed as his hand dipped under his shirt making its way up his back.
“What’s wrong Sev,” Draco drawled coldly at the grimacing man, anger burning in his eyes, “Does it upset you that you can’t beat me into submission anymore?”
xXxXHPxDMXxXx
Draco sat in a stunned silence for a moment before nodding slowly, “understood.”
“Do you like her?” Jonathan smirked, ignoring his daughter’s instant protests.
Draco arched, crying out as he spilled all over Leo’s stomach. The raven grunted, hips stuttering as the knot in his stomach snapped and pleasure raced up his spine. The blonde whimpered as Leo’s seed shot deep within him.
Lyra swallowed and took a step back before straightening herself and staring him down boldly, “And I was always taught it was polite to introduce myself before assuming anything. You may misread a situation and make an ass out of yourself.”
"Cousins?! That's crazy mate, you think someone would know if you had two twin cousins wandering around. I reckon the pressed be all over them. "Cousins to the boy who lived" How does it feel to have Harry Potter as a cousin?" Ron held the half eaten chicken wing in Hermione's face.
"What?" Harry asked confused, what did she mean other cousins?
"Of course," Lyra smirked, eyes sweeping up to the head table where the Headmaster sat. His eyes had dimed slightly in his fury. He should really learn to hide his emotions better. She shot his an impudent wink before smiling coolly at the silently stewing Mrs. Weasley.
Harry sighed leaning back against the bridge wall crossing his arms over his chest.
A sharp poke to his side had him turning his head to look at Seamus who was lying on his back at the end of Harry’s bed. The young Irishman smiled confidently, “Come on Har, Draco doesn’t seem like a push over mate. He can handle himself, I’m sure by the end of the Month the Man will be the King of All Slytherins!”
Draco cocked a brow coolly, responding off-handedly, “I wouldn’t know, we’d only just met this morning on the train.”
Draco was awoken twenty minutes after his head hit the pillow by a horrible bone chilling scream. Moving quickly he threw off the plush white comforter and darted out into the hall wand at the ready.
Draco was out by the Lake, as per Julian’s advice
“So Dobby’s another spy,” Carina mused, a disappointed look on her face, “I knew he was a bit strange. Dumbledore must have done something to him. Elves aren’t usually that free willed. It’s against their nature. Elves are simple creatures who enjoy spending their time making people happy.”
“Leo,” Carina turned to smirk at her cousin, “Is the first student to ever steal a book from the Hogwarts Library under Madam Pince’s nose.”
The man seemed to have caught up with himself and was watching Draco with a guarded scowl as if preparing to lash out again, the man seemingly regretted his rash actions and though he felt shaken, Draco was ok.
Tracy paled and floundered for a moment, “I could help, please, give me a moment of your time and I can tell you how, please I-”
“I’m worried about Draco,” Harry admitted, looking up at Ron who was leaning against his Headboard frowning down at him in concern. “What if he gets caught, what if we get caught? Those Slytherins can be really nasty.”
"I shouldn’t have HAD too. Speaking of common knowledge how are you going to explain away lying to me about my blood status… as I'm a pureblood and not a Half blood as you claimed," Leo hissed challengingly, he was going to make it clear to everyone that he didn’t trust the man.
Theo and Millie deflated exchanging blank looks, “What?” How would undermining authority help them? Did they really know what they were doing here? Maybe they’d made a mistake.
Leo smirked and spun on his heel tilting his head to the door, “Come on.” He didn’t wait long before strolling casually toward the door Draco hurrying after him. Leo led him in silence back to the Main entry way and then up the curved stairway. Draco hadn’t noticed the crystal chandelier before but the tiny jewels sparkled beautifully in the brightly lit room the large mosaic window above the door causing a prism like effect on the clear stones.
JPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJP JPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJP JPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJP JPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJPJP JPJPJPJPJP
Leo strolled casually down the hall, it was near curfew but he didn’t care, he’d skip any detention he received anyway. He just needed to think. All these new revelations were making his head spin. Did he like Malfoy? Did he like blokes? Could he really be gay? He didn’t think so. But everything was pointing at that being the case. Could he be gay and not even realize it?
Standing quickly he rushed out of his room, nearly shoving Dudley down the stairs as he ran down them. The other boy grunted angrily at him before hobbling after him not that he could catch Harry when he was hurrying, or do anything about it if he did.
Carina and Ron looked suspicious, eyeing the three with a sharp gaze. "Tell us what?"
“Nixie and Pipsy is to be escorting Masters Kitten and Friends to Home,” One of the little things piped up.
Carina began giggling noting the stony expression that overtook her cousin’s face.
I've been made aware that it might be difficult to keep up with some of the different names that I've changed. so at the beginning and end of each chapter I'll try to remember to post this note!
backyard. It was only after Lucius managed to blast the damned thing that he’d stopped screaming.
“Julian, why don’t you and the girls show the other to their rooms… I’ll show Draco to his in a moment.” Draco swallowed thickly at the promises laced in that simple statement.
She was half naked.
“RONALD!”
“I just didn’t understand the question, Draco made it seem so simple when he explained it though,” Carina chuckled.
Harry chuckled, “Yep.”
Stupid was never a word he would have used to describe himself, until today that is. Which is why he was beating himself up over the sheet of parchment he’d found in his Father’s workshop while looking for some broomstick polish.
All and all things are crazy. Im so sorry i havent responded to your messages. Im back, i bought a New laptop and hopefully i'll have what was supposed to be the Christmas chapter up soon! Thank you all for being so patient, HAPPY NEW YEAR!
What do you think? I won't post them right away I want to focus on the two stories I have going right now but I'd like to start the outline for them if you all think I should. Working on them will in no way effect these two stories! I promise!
Theo nodded shortly, his tight grip on his girlfriend’s hand relaxing slightly. The two ate talking casually about classes to complete the cover of their story, before standing with their group and leaving the Hall.
“Mother wanted me closer to home, every Malfoy before me has Graduated from Hogwarts, Father wanted to continue the tradition.”
Theo snorted, leaning casually against the book shelf, with his hands in his pockets, “We think you know why.”
“Of course, how could I forget,” Leo huffed, allowing his head to fall back against the wall.
“Hey!” Leo yelped as he seemingly glided out from under the… thing.
Remus nodded becoming serious, "Dumbledore can't be trusted."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“I’ll think about it,” Draco hedged, nodding at the redhead before heading toward the Slytherin table and taking his seat across from Blaise and Adrian, who’d gone on ahead of him.
Sirius shrugged, turning his attention back to the letter, "The other two percent is that he's asexual or something."
Carina had screamed at him for three hours before proceeding to ignore him. That’s how he knew she was beyond angry, they’d missed three classes. She wasn’t alone in punishing him. Julian refused to look at him and would only talk to him when necessary. Lyra whom he usually studied in the library with acted as if he wasn’t there, going so far as to knock his inkwell onto his essay when she dropped a new pile of books on the table to use. She didn’t even help him clean it up, only apologizing shortly before returning to her work. People in the hall would avoid his gaze and hurry passed him. Only Nott and Bulstrode seemed be talking to him, though conversation was slightly strained the two making it clear they didn’t approve of his actions.
Theo’s brow shot to his hairline teasingly, “What’s stopping you, say it?”
“I don’t know,” Harry sniffed trying to hold back tears, he’d obviously hurt the other boy without meaning to. He felt like a horrible boyfriend, “I guess I just couldn’t control myself. I thought you were trying to seduce me so we didn’t have to do anything else.”
Carina smiled, "I really do hate studying all the time, grades are important but it’s exhausting sometimes."
Leo turned just in time to have his tie grabbed and to be yanked out of the Great Hall by it. “OI!” he choked as the tie tightened painfully around his throat cutting off some of his air supply, causing him to choke. The other boy dragged him ruthlessly toward the dungeons ignoring the swatting hand trying to make him let go.
He ushered everyone in before entering himself.
"But that makes you…"
Carina smiled sheepishly at her twin, “Sorry Rea, hey Padfoot,” She rubbed the excited pup’s belly, smiling affectionately.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Relax,” He breathed as he slowly but forcefully pressed the head in.
Carina closed in behind him placing a calming hand on his back in a show of support, Lyra was moments behind her, probably taking everything in. She was after all new to the whole situation. They’d filled her in as much as they could, but actually being here was a whole different Quidditch game.
Amelia laced here arm with his, “Come Draco Mein Kind, I wanted to run an idea by you to get your opinion.”
The last was whispered in his ear as the Italian passed him. Draco didn’t know whether to be happy or frightened by Leo and Blaise’s new found ‘friendship’. The two were now often spotted speaking in the corridors between classes, causing fear and tension to spread through their fellow students. He’d once even spotted them laughing together. The seventh year Gryffindor he’d been passing spotted them a moment before him and promptly fainted. Yes the two boys caused quite a commotion. Draco wasn’t sure how much longer the school would remain standing now.
The boys started in surprise before hurrying after the girls shouting for them to wait for them.
