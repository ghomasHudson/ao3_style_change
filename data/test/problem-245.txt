'But I thought you'd been using the room - you know we'd stayed in,' Ginny said, giving her a thoughtful look.
'Thank me, after you've opened it.' Draco said, he had been grateful that his mother, he had no way of explaining this traditional gift to her otherwise - the engagement had nothing to do with it. More his heritage. Potter opened the box, and her eyes widened upon seeing the silver goblin made bracelet, it had been engraved with runes, the Malfoy crest, the Potter crest, and encrusted with jewels and protection spells had been added to it also. Potter looked to be on the verge of refusing to accept the gift, her mouth opened and closed quickly, and she seemed to be struggling for words.
Mrs Weasley still did not think very highly of the Daily Prophet. Neither did Aria, however much it was trying to make a new name for itself.
Mrs Weasley was waiting for her at the end of the long kitchen by the fireplace. Aria knew the moment she saw her, she was upset with or at something.
Draco caught Aria rolling her eyes. Miss Dursley left the room, Aria began to place the empty cups back onto the tray. Once she had done that, she got up with the tray in hand. As she neared the door she had come through she was tackled to the ground, the tray flew out of her hands up into the air and came crashing down.
'And he would have got himself killed!' Hermione replied firmly, 'They would have killed him - I'm not saying what he did was right - but he did not hand us over - I can't just forget that!'
Hermione and Ginny laughed, Ron looked almost understanding. The usual get-together at The Burrow was just the relaxing atmosphere she needed after a long tiring day of looking after Teddy.
Fleur exchanged a look with Mrs Weasley, then looked at Aria again. 'Send for him ... she needs him.'
'I came to see if you needed anything,' Draco coughed awkwardly trying to hide his own embarrassment, he felt a little out of place, and this was not the impression he had wanted to give her at all - she'd probably be thinking that he was after something more, coming to her room this late at night. 'Before you retire for the night.'
'I thought you did better than me,' Aria said as they left the classroom, 'don't understand why you didn't get points too.'
Draco placed Aria's sleeping form into his arms. They had spent the day avoiding The Dark Lord by trying to study. Though Aria kept getting distracted by the gardens. She had a wistful look on her face every time she looked out of the window. He carried her along the corridors of the Manor, towards his suite.
Draco waited, there had to be a point behind all the things Granger was informing him of, but Granger didn't elaborate. 'Why would she deny that her favourite flowers are orchids?'
It didn't matter that she was a half-blood, nor did it matter that most of the time she looked like a regular person, something the Malfoy's failed at, with their calm collected manner and dress code of sophisticatedness. Though she looked like a Malfoy and was soon to be one - Aria far from felt like one and it just didn't sit well with her. She felt like she was trying too hard at seeking approval she did not even need, but then she thought of Draco - of how Draco had put aside his beliefs, had tried to stick to the vows he swore to her - how he had gifted her that tapestry, the gift was just beyond words. This time she was doing something for Draco. Aria could be as elegant as the other Malfoy relations if she wanted to, and Aria was never one to back down from a challenge.
Again Draco knew the Dark Lord was not asking him a question. So he agreed with the statement. "She does."
'It's not just Malfoys you'll be meeting Miss Reyes,' Draco groaned, 'when my son mentions the extended family, he means all the Weasleys -'
Yes a whole two lovely months before Hogwarts started back up, Aria had jumped at the chance to repeat her last year when the offer came. She had not realised Malfoy was returning also.
'I think it's silly, so you lost in the last round.' Aria said after a few moments, 'You came second, that isn't a bad thing. It shows how talented you are, even though you didn't win. It proved how much knowledge you knew -'
"What's the catch?" Aria said as Draco placed the tray of food down upon a table beside her chair. "Why are you not just killing me."
Aria released the breath she hadn't been aware she was holding. Today she was finally returning to the wizarding world and she was not looking forward to being swarmed by a mass of people.
At least the whispers and mindless chatter had subsided a little, or at least Aria wasn't hearing it, neither had Hermione or Ginny. Aria wondered if Draco had said something, but thought better of it. That would be completely out of character and as much as he had sworn a magical oath, she doubted it would be something he would do. Perhaps then the other students had just got bored because Aria had not risen to it.
Draco grabbed Aria and cradled her towards his chest. Wings burst forth, swishing around - arching around - then pain, hot, burning pain which caused Draco to groan.
"My Lord." Snape bowed low. He had brought a young teen-aged girl with him. A girl who had dark hair like Aria and dark eyes that looked so much liked the Potions masters.
"The young masters, Goyle, and Crabbe will join Draco as added protection, I'm sure other Slytherins hoping to win my favour will join them. Headmaster Snape will be reporting on your progress. Miss Snape will be joining you within the Slytherin dorms. I only do this for your safety. Protection is necessary under the circumstances, your safety is very important to me, precious one. " he said.
'She hates dark cramped spaces. Her favourite colour is blue, the type of blue you see on a clear sunny day. And she's a lot smarter than people give her credit for.'
Draco instead looked out of the window, the rain seemed to sum up how this day was turning out, miserable - not even seeing his friends could cheer him up now.
The Vanilla scent made Aria aware of the person who now stood behind her. Aria kept her gaze forward, locked upon Voldemort. She only tilted her head slightly to allow access to the back of her neck as the choker was placed around her neck. "Now our world will understand and know that you are mine."
'Yes,' Aria replied, 'she also happens to be another one of Draco's wonderful distantly related cousins. And thanks to her, how Draco landed up in the hospital wing.'
Aria snuck out in the middle of the night again. She had been trying to guess the Headmaster's password. And she had succeeded. Sherbet lemon indeed. Such a sneaky Slytherin.
Draco switched on the light like he had seen Potter's cousin do so many times before. Dudley had woken and was now staring in a concerned manner at the wall which was the barrier between their room and Potter's.
'And I noticed your trunk, you didn't really scream "witch" but then I guess I don't either.' she said, 'Does it make a difference - being, what did you call it? Muggle-born? I'm still learning all the terms.'
The door opened once more, several more students this time. They had been waiting to see if all was clear. Aria recognized the Slytherins in her year easily Nott, Zabini, Greengrass, Bulstrode. Then the younger Slytherins took longer to put names to, Greengrass's little sister, Colby, Darce, Doyle, Kearney, and others Aria couldn't put names to.
Aria frowned blinking slightly looking at the goblin-made bracelet, another outdated tradition had started the gift of receiving it off, surely that couldn't be a coincidence. 'Do some families still follow old traditions even if they have gone out of date?'
'Don't worry,' Aria said, 'I had no clue - literally. The old Potions Professor - Snape - he would always use the old names for herbs, it confused the hell out of me, until my friend pointed it out.'
Normally Aria avoided any talk of leaving Hogwarts, for it had been her first home, but after the war, things had changed. Some things about Hogwarts had not changed at all, like the very fact Ron had peered over her shoulder to see what she was doing.
'You really should have been sorted into Slytherin!' Draco said disappointedly. 'No need to point that all out you know, could have just asked to stay and spend time with our guests.'
'No, no magical withdrawal, we've been spending quite a lot of time together that ... well, it's been kept at bay.' Aria said.
'He reminded me of Snape ... of how Snape treated us, and I know he only did it to fulfill his role as a spy,' Aria said as they walked past. 'But Professor Neumann is not, he has nothing to prove ... he was just being a bully, that's not the way to set an example. OK, I get the point in a demonstration ... but that - that was not teaching ...'
Draco groaned, he should have suspected it, 'I'm not giving you any money, you utter Slytherin. You knew, somehow. I don't care if I can't prove it but I know you, and that smug look on your face Potter, you can wipe it off now.'
'But-' Draco added once Aria had given him her undivided attention, 'I ask that you trust me, for you're not knowing what is it until - well you'll see.'
Weasley was red-faced, Granger looked startled, and Aria's hand had reached for her wand. Gregory walked towards where Draco had been sitting with Blaise and Theodore.
'Yes .. my godson,' Aria stated, 'I'm having him the whole day and for the night to give Dromeda a break.'
Draco took her hand and led them inside, with no furniture in place, the house looked empty and felt cold.
Everything could have been ruined ... Crabbe and Goyle wanting to stay behind, capture her - Draco had no choice, he had to go to, had to follow, besides the Dark Lord still had his family, and he hadn't figured it out then. Not even after what happened; Crabbe had set the Room of Requirement on fire, he thought all was lost, that he was going to die, then Potter, Weasley, and Granger had come back for them. They had lost Crabbe - Weasley and Granger safely had a hold of Goyle - but even then, even in those few moments that played over in his mind since he'd figured it out - when her hand had reached out for his - and being so suddenly close to her - his magic had reached out and brushed over hers, especially when she dived for no apparent reason - even though Potter did everything for a reason, she did not explain it. Then when she appeared to be dead - lying limp - it felt like something had lodged itself in his throat - but she had of course was fine.
'I hate him!' Draco snapped as they sat down in an air-chair in the new common room for the eighth-years. Only in the dorms would each house banner, be found; the common-room showed no signs of the Hogwarts house banners or even portraits. The only portrait they had was the guardian to the room. When Draco first saw it, he thought the walls looked like a family tree, but it was not. It was a tree of sorts, each branch led off to a person's name along with a date of birth, and most had a date of death, others just had the year of death, as there was no conclusive date. The Remembrance Tree was what they started calling it; it held all the names of lives lost, including those who had died fighting the Dark Lord the first time around.
Aria reentered the room, 'Remind me Dromeda, if I ever say I want children again - not to have any - remind me that they're exhausting.'
It seemed to be working, his father stabbed at his food, and Draco was glad he had sat between them now. Potter's magic was brushing against his again. Though he could not tell what she was feeling this time, he had no doubts by the smile upon her face, and the glint in her eyes, as into what she was feeling.
Meals were always held in silence. The Carrows would walk up and down the tables to try and catch any trouble makers or any talkers. Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Seamus were watched constantly. The Carrows had a good reason to be watching them. Thanks to Ginny who after a couple of days had decoded the DA coin messages. They figured that Aria was somehow in touch with Hermione from the first message. And the second had given them a spell to conceal their conversations in the Gryffindor common room. However, the presence of Voldemort made the usual silence of The Great Hall come to a stand-still. In a way, Ron supposed it had, for as soon as he had entered the students and professors had stopped eating. Snape had escorted him in, indicating towards to teachers table Voldemort however, headed straight for the Slytherin table without a word even spoken Aria had risen and so had Malfoy. They left the hall and students after a few moments began to very hesitantly eat their meals once more.
Aria was intriguing - she did not wear a bikini as the other Muggles did, she tended to favour wearing a two-piece swimsuit when they were by the pool. But it did not stop Draco from noticing the curves in her body or appreciate them. But Aria seemed to be uncomfortable with her skin, especially on the days she didn't wear her dorky glasses. Draco much preferred Aria with her glasses on - she didn't look the same - like a part of her was missing.
Draco couldn't figure Aria out, or figure out what she was up to, despite saying that she was with the half-giant, but she seemed to be quite vibrant, the was until the week before the anniversary of the battle of Hogwarts, come to think of it Aria had been quiet since notifications went up in regards to a gathering being held on the second of May.
'Isn't it sweet?' she said noticing Aria had caught the attention of it. 'Can't believe he thought of something like this.'
'Suppose so,' she shrugged, she had not missed the unsaid if you can manage it. Well, challenge accepted, 'Draco.'
"I believe so. Watch them. Be careful who you trust with the information inside it, Aria. It will I believe with no doubt help you with your quest."
That had been the reason why his mother had gone to such lengths - calling in the life debt. And if Potter found out - Merlin if she ever found out it had been a ruse, he doubted that he would still be alive.
For the moment Ron was in the kitchen, alongside Fred and George, trying to make sense of the package he had just been given.
Cygnus tilted his head downwards, and sighed deeply, 'I'm not proud of it - I should have been braver ... you see I found my compatible match. She's beautiful, and so caring like your Aria, but ...' Draco waited as Cygnus paused, Draco had sensed his cousin was far from finished. 'A Muggle-born witch.'
Draco groaned and turned over onto his stomach, for the life of him he couldn't find a comfortable position so he could fall asleep. His back ached ... his mind wouldn't shut off. Though he wasn't a master at Occlumency, he at least knew how to apply the principles to shut his mind off.
'Oh,' Potter said looking at them, and for the first time, Draco noticed the blue, glittery nail varnish, 'Emily - my - Muggle friend - I'm currently her new model - that's why I was so late, I had to go back home and change. I didn't think turning up in Muggle jeans would be appreciated.'
Draco could not help himself and as far as he was concerned he had no reason to feel guilty about it either; he felt smug. Very smug and very vain. It was like every fiber of his being coming suddenly alive, he had gotten control of his Veela transformation overnight, and that was on top of kissing Aria Potter and not being hexed to a million pieces for it. A Hogsmeade weekend was coming up - though he had still yet had to ask Aria to go with him, he was certain she would not turn him down. So he saw no reason in feeling guilty about how he was feeling.
'I know,' Aria sighed heavily, 'I guess you could say I'm worried if - you know Ron - could be right, in a sense.'
'Thank you.' Aria said softly barely looking him in the eye, she thrust the cage with his falcon in towards him. 'I thought you'd like him back.'
Aria had reached him on the podium now, she stood rather awkwardly waiting for whatever announcement was to come.
His grandmother returned to watching the gathering with interest, Aria was currently speaking with his mother. 'I like her, Aria is a little unusual ... she has an air about her -'
Aria held out her wrist to show them the bracelet, 'yeah it's true - all this time he was running around telling everyone he was pure-blood when he's a Veela.'
Ron's hands reached up and rubbed at his face, 'I know you've got compatible magic and all, I just don't get how you can be so sure.'
She just bloody knew it, shakily, Aria got to her feet, walked along the row to the nearest exit, down the center aisle, heading towards Kinsley who had continued with his speech.
Aria bit her lip, and shut her eyes tightly, 'You don't understand Draco, I don't think I'm ever going to. It's Dudley I feel for more than anything.'
'Got a fucking detention with Filch.' Draco grumbled as he sat down for dinner. 'Cleaning is so beneath me.'
'You heard me - stay away from her - I know what you are doing! I know what you are up to! You are unworthy -'
' ... as I was saying magical bonds can develop over a number of things. The types you'll be most aware of; the bond between wand and wizard, compatible magic ...'
'Well seeing as we couldn't use a Dementor,' Aria said, 'We had to settle for a Boggart instead - and no I'm not going to teach you like that. Don't even think of asking.'
Maybe things were moving along better than he thought they had been ... now if only he could find a comfortable enough position to fall asleep.
How he could deny those green eyes anything, he was outnumbered three to one by them, considering both his children had inherited the exact shape and shade of green colour their mother's eyes possessed.
Aria's magic was always on the brink of being summoned like she could cause harm to anyone at a moment's notice. Hexes and jinxes always at the tip of her tongue and oh how Aria wanted to - and she really wanted to- rip the Carrows apart limb from limb.
'It's not about Draco,' Aria said, 'You're going to have to get over it, I've forgiven him ... move on.'
Though Draco did not receive points as Aria had ... he found he could care less. He felt proud, just like this morning when he had found evidence of his inheritance ... seeing the feathers upon his bed had given him an ego boost, though he still hadn't been able to transform.
Potter walked quietly beside him, through the halls of the Manor until they reached the dining room. He opened the door for her, receiving a small 'thank you,' from Potter when she passed.
'And you're willing to take that chance?' Aria said. 'Not that I do not have faith in the wards, but this your mother - your father, Celena I can handle but the wrath of Narcissa Malfoy - I think not; I'm still indebted to her. And as much as I love you I rather not face the wrath of Mrs Weasley either - you know the woman that happens to be like a mother to me and the very same woman that ... overpowered your aunt Bellatrix.'
'It's fine, I understand,' Aria interrupted once more, 'It's probably best that they aren't anyway.'
Aria shook her head, being back here, as much as she had wanted to return, it was going to take some getting used to. 'Not really.'
'There was no need for that.' Granger said, 'you gave us quite a fright and Aria could have hexed him.'
'Did you?' Hermione said, the rest of her question went unasked, but Aria having been her friend for years knew what she had been thinking.
'You will notice five magically drawn square boxes, four of which have your own house colour - please enter the coloured square that belongs to you.' Aria called out once the doors closed behind the Hogwarts students. The green square, filled with Slytherins in the corner nearest to Aria, the Ravenclaws filled the blue square in the corner next to it, the Gryffindors stood in the red square in the opposite corner them, the Huffpuffs took the yellow square in the other corner nearest to Aria. Each house turned and stared at the white square in the center of them all.
"People who answered the DA call when we went into the Ministry. The messages are coming through to people Aria can trust."
'She's not going to go anywhere.' A soft voice said Draco faced the person who he had just sat down next to; his grandmother, Florence Malfoy. 'Your young lady.'
"I've been messing about with our old DA coins. See if we can send messages to Hermione. And I well I got something. A message of some kind." Ginny said settling down one of the air chairs of the Gryffindor common room. She slid him a note. "Take a look at what came through."
Ron rubbed at his face. He couldn't work it out, just why would they be being sent a bunch of numbers. "It's got to mean something." Ron took one look around him. Ginny, Neville, and Seamus all looking at the message the same way he did. Ron thought of something. "We're going to have to get hold of Luna. Just in case she gets one."
'No one's ever offered to take care of me before,' Aria whispered then corrected herself, 'at least not out loud.'
Draco's fists clenched, of course, he would bloody ask her to demonstrate the spell, who wouldn't, Draco glanced quickly at Aria, and he had not been the only one to turn in her direction.
Draco smiled, chuckling lightly, 'Yes I can imagine what you'll do to me. Now let me take a look at your ankle, it looks swollen.'
'No, he was picking on me, making me look incompetent in front of Aria,' Draco said, 'that's what he did, we all know by now that duels don't start with a bow, that's only in formal ones. But if he thinks that for one second -'
"These are no ordinary bracelets, my precious one." Voldemort continued. "I believe a demonstration is in order. Crucio!"
Aria Potter in one word was formidable. Draco savored the moment, taking in her sleeping form, Aria had crashed out on the desk next to him, just a few hours ago whilst they were doing their potions homework. The Christmas break had now arrived, not that it felt much like Christmas with Voldemort still ruling his home. However, Draco would take the small victories. They had a plan to harm the Carrows just enough so that they would never roam the halls of Hogwarts in any way ever again or at least he hoped the plan was underway. Aria was certain that by now someone in what she called Dumbledore's Army had worked out the coded messages. Rays of the morning sun peeked through the open windows, illuminating Aria and making her look like a goddess. Draco allowed himself the freedom of brushing her fringe back from her scar. His intended. The crazy plan muttered and agreed with his mother in the darkest of the night to keep Aria safe. There was a time he thought he would not have cared. Now he can't stand the thought of losing her.
'Your bracelet literally allows you to come and go to Malfoy Manor as you please.' Draco explained, he too was looking down at the bracelet, 'and the last one?'
'You do,' Fleur said, 'or you would not be wearing that bracelet - it is traditional for a Veela to give one upon an engagement - Bill has one like it, which I gave him.'
'But that is beside the point. We were talking about Malfoy, and you. What's so great about Malfoy anyway? What do you even like about him? To make you be able to stand being in his presence?'
Draco pushed the door open to find the Entrance Hall packed full of students, all asking the same question, when was the next session going to be. Draco exchanged a look with Aria and whispered, 'I don't think you would have lasted in Slytherin for very long after all, because you were trying to put people off, you failed.'
December had arrived bringing with a cold bitter wind. Aria for the first time in years had received a letter. Normally this would not cause her any concern. But the letter McGonagall had just given her had not been received the normal way. It had tried to come through the Muggle post.
'It's more than that,' Hermione replied, 'Much more, most people will have compatible magic with someone else - like how you can use some wands easier than others but others -'
Draco raised his wand, and copied the movements shown to the class earlier, pointed it at the table, non-verbally he cast the spell, and the table before him exploded.
"I've been trying, but I can't seem to do it yet," Aria said glancing out of the bedroom window, thinking of her failed communicative Patronus, she had not thought this would happen, she hadn't even realised about the portraits either until he said. Draco wanted to betray Voldemort. Could she trust him? "So what is our next move?"
Malfoy's hand reached out towards her, along with his magic. 'Aria, I thought - I thought you knew.'
Draco looked thoughtful and then he cursed. "Fucking Merlin! He's punishing me for refusing his mark on my return."
Aria shook her head against his hands, 'It may look it, but no. There are things ... I've told him a few things, things I couldn't avoid, like the nightmares and you. But his perspective changed when I saved his soul from Dementors.' Draco caught a glimpse of her frowning again. 'The Weasleys' were the closest - are the closest thing I have to a family. I know that they will always welcome me with open arms because that's who they are. But they never - not once verbally.'
Draco's voice seemed to have a bit of hesitancy about it, he blinked at her several times when she turned to face him. He seemed shell-shocked by her attire and appearance.
But why? They had never got along - and now, now - it was just odd. Draco had changed, or was it simply due to his oath - and when the hell did he become Draco? Even in her own personal thoughts, she was thinking of him as Draco, sure she had been calling him by his first name, but thinking his name as well an entirely different matter, he was Malfoy dammit not Draco! And when did she start to feel suddenly safe in Draco Malfoy's presence? What the hell was that about? Safe and Draco Malfoy did just not go together. Was her brain trying to play tricks on her? She must have imagined it all - but even her imagination wouldn't be that far-fetched.
'For what it is worth,' Ron said looking at Aria rather awkwardly, 'I am sorry. In all honestly, I think Malfoy needs his head testing - I mean his completely lost it thanks to your compatible magic - barmy I tell you. He would have never protected anyone but himself before now.'
Aria almost slapped herself for not thinking of it sooner. She would have had one from her parents if they were still alive and one with Sirius. The only reason Aria even knew such a bond existed was because of Teddy.
Again a silver light erupted from Draco's wand, then after a few moments vanished once more. And he continued, Aria watching him in the silence. It seemed strange that now she was starting to take notice of his pointed features - how had she not realised that he had Veela inheritance before - it seemed so obvious now, but then she supposed she had never really looked at Draco before, more she had looked, saw that it was him, shouted and argued with him and turned away. For someone with natural pale features and currently sporting a frown, due to his concentration - Draco was very good-looking. He looked far too tense for someone who was meant to be looking for a happy memory or had his posture always been that stiff.
'Nothing like that,' Aria reassured him, 'it's just - I went to a family ball so I could be introduced - and afterward, well it's hard to explain - before he'd have no problems at looking at me like I didn't belong there or a bit of filth - after the ball, that all stopped - that's what I meant by odd. Just not at all what I expected.'
Draco brought himself back to the matter at hand - the do not disturb sign. Was this some kind of Muggle code? Should he just go back to the swimming pool and inform Aria. It turned out he did not need to inform Aria after all, as she came down the corridor saving him the trouble.
'Of course, there is,' Aria said sounding astonished and waved it off. Ginny laughed, Neville shook his head in bewilderment and Luna smiled dreamily at her.
The practice dummy smashed into tiny pieces, which made Aria feel slightly better. What she wouldn't give to hex the living daylights out of Draco's cousin right now.
Draco turned his gaze to Aria, who was still showing no signs of being affected by his allure. The same girl who had spoken up for his family - though he had not known that at the time - the same girl that was now choosing to look past people's differences ... despite the fact of the rumours that followed her. Blaise was right - how could she stand it and not have lost her temper from it.
Pink confetti and hearts decorated the ceiling of the Great Hall the morning of Valentine's day, Aria yawned sleepily as sat down next to a positively beaming Hermione, who was sporting a new charm bracelet.
'No you're not,' Aria said frowning at him, with her I know better look. 'But I guess you more than made up for it - thank you, by the way, it's beautiful ...' her hand clasped at the silver chain around her neck, from under her coat and she pulled out the rubied shaped teardrop surrounded by diamonds; Draco's latest gift.
There were an exchange of looks, no-one really knew what to say to Aria's statement - she had never really explained what she had seen properly in Snape's memories, just the necessary facts. But Snape had a small part to play - just like she had, in Dumbledore's thought-out plan. Just another betrayal. What did that matter when the fate of lives had been at state? Nothing! The greater good ... was there such a thing?
Draco sighed heavily, running a hand through his hair, 'What's it going to take to get you to call me by my name again.'
Aria nodded and turned to Draco who looked sad and remorseful. "It was the only way. Only death frees us -" Draco pulled at his sleeve to reveal his hidden counterpart. " and I'd choose you or death over his rule any day."
'I died Dudley - I let him - I tried to go on -' Aria said, 'It was so peaceful D - I could have stayed there, but I came back though, I chose to come back.'
'Congratulations.' Narcissa said cupping Aria's face with her hands moments after Aria and Draco had broken apart.
'Of course, you're not, forgive me, I shouldn't have said that,' Ron said, shaking his head, 'just - be careful please Aria, you're like family, I don't - I can't stand to see you get hurt.'
'I thought you got along,' Blaise said, 'you certainly did when you were younger. Did you not know he was going to be here?'
'I thought you'd never ask,' Aria said, kissing his cheek which seemed to flush upon the contact, 'I'm sorry I've been ... I didn't - I'm sorry I never understood before. You - if you want to - can tell me anything. I won't break your confidence.'
'I know what this means -' Aria said, holding up her wrist to show the bracelet upon it, 'I know what you are - I know that this is only given by - why didn't you just tell me to begin with?'
No, Aria wasn't. Trusting she may be, that did not make her naive. After all, why would she question a letter from Narcissa?
'Mrs - Narcissa,' Aria changed the way she was about to address Draco's mother, very quickly when she noticed the disappointment Mrs Malfoy's look gave her. 'Draco said that - he believed that -'
'Well after the engagement news ... I thought people wouldn't have a very good opinion of me.' Aria said, 'Not that I care - I've never had anything to prove to everyone anyway.'
"Whoever said I couldn't cast them." Aria raised her eyebrows. "Doesn't know me very well. Now, do you want to take down the dark evil wizard terrorizing your families or not?"
'I see the new wand you been so busy making is working?' Hermione said, indicating to the offending wand that was still pointing at them.
His mother turned her head away and sighed, 'this was not how I wanted you to find out ... I was going to tell you, once you had gotten used to Aria. I know you despise the girl Lucius - but I'd thought you'd be adult enough - what happened to our family coming first? - I'd thought you'd see past -'
The morning of departure, Draco had yet to find Aria, a bit of panic set in for he had not been able to sense her magic either. When Aria failed to not turn up for breakfast, Draco went in search of her. When he found her, Aria was standing by the lake, staring at the Hogwarts as though she was trying to absorb every detail she could so she could commit it to memory.
They were excused after the meal. The moment Aria reached what had become her room, she found a new trunk that was full of new clothing. Aria had been wondering if more clothing was to come. She had found a few items of clothing on the first day within the room she had been given. Aria rolled her eyes and tried to not think about who had gifted her the clothes, to begin with.
'Insane woman.' Draco said to himself, as he drew his wand up to test the last foundations of the house wards. Satisfied that the house was guarded, Draco made his way around the grounds. Their back garden was more like a yard, the dense woodland area at the edge of their lands, and of course the lake, the wards if Draco had placed them correctly - which he was very confident that he had - would stretch to the end of their property. When he reached the trees that were the beginning of the woodland, Draco heard a rustle amongst the leaves.
Aria stumbled out of the fireplace, trying to gain her balance before she toppled over, but her hands were full as in one hand was a cage containing his own falcon, and the other her cat. Draco had to reach out to steady her.
as you'll most likely be aware, I've not had many dealings with Muggle money before. Could you advise on
'It was you that was stupid, Celena,' Aria sneered into the seemingly empty room. She did not cast the spell to reveal her, Aria recognized Draco's cousin's voice straight away. How could she forget the voice that had once told her she would never see Draco's wings. 'Perhaps you forgot about my protective bracelet, or perhaps you do not realise that I have no need of it to protect me. I am quite capable of doing that myself.'
It was official, the students of Hogwarts hated him, and they had no problems in proving their point to Draco. He was subjected to receiving nasty hexes and pranks. And it was only the day after Aria had shouted at him after their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, Draco suspected more to come. Draco was frustrated and angry, it was none of the other students' business what had gone on. How did Aria cope in the past with every pair of eyes that she came across, looking at her in disgust? How the tables had now turned.
Aria's smile brightened, and her eyes shone though held a mischievous glance about them, as though she knew something that he didn't. 'I've been with Hagrid!'
"Expecto Patronum," Aria whispered. No Patronus came to her. The major problem about living with Death Eater and Voldemort was being around them affected her happiness. To survive she needed that. It was her only means of escape now.
Aria had found peace and quiet eventually but of course, it had to be interrupted. Though she hadn't minded spending time with the first-year Slytherin; as Alana and herself had quite a few things in common regarding their backgrounds, it had been nice to enjoy the silence, though she should have known it wouldn't have lasted long in the eighth-year common room. Well, it had been nice whilst it lasted.
'The Daily Prophet likes to take things that concern me and blow them out of proportion,' Aria said, 'I'm fine.'
Aria took in their grinning faces. Before Aria stood one of her best friends and Ron was joined by Neville and Seamus.
Granger and Weasley gave the oddest reactions to her words, Granger hid her head under her arms, and Weasley choked, but it had been covered up as the bell rang ending the lesson. Aria shrugged at her friends as they regained their composure mouthing what looked like in a defensive manner, 'he asked.'
'I was hoping they'd be back by now.' Aria said, biting her lip. 'I was hoping Emily wouldn't mind applying sun cream to my back.'
Aria felt as well as heard the harsh intake of breath when she looked up at Draco, he stood with his eyes closed, when the eyelids opened, his stormy grey eyes were sparkling with desire.
Aria knew who it was even before he had spoken ... the feel of his magic, she had thought that he would have joined his friends like he usually did.
'You,' Mrs Weasley replied calmly and she withdrew from her robe, a newspaper, and not just any newspaper; the Daily Prophet. 'Care to explain why there's an announcement of your engagement to - to - young Mr Malfoy! And care to explain why you did not inform us?'
'No,' Aria said pulling a face, but her smile did not falter so she wasn't completely serious about it. 'Do you know how much trouble you got me in, with Ron and Hermione? They thought I was taking the mick - that we had kissed - then you went and confirmed it, in front of everyone I might add -'
Draco shook his head, at her slight exaggeration - how was it possible for someone who had been poisoned not that long ago, to be this relaxed now. But Aria was just so carefree like it didn't matter, all that mattered was the boy in front of her.
When Aria reached the designated room for tonight's advent, she took a breath before she walked in - to find no one there. The room was empty apart from the furniture. Perhaps she had just been the first to arrive - for Narcissa wouldn't invite her then not show up, come to think of it Narcissa would have been here to welcome everyone including Aria herself. Something most certainly did not feel quite right to Aria. Had she been led here on false pretense? That explained why no one was in the room. If so then the invitation she had received had not been from Narcissa but someone else entirely. Aria let the door close softly behind her.
She finally learned where she was being held, hostage. Malfoy Manor. For her safety, Voldemort had claimed Aria had been moved to Draco's suite. Draco took his usual room and Aria had been shown the guest room. The first couple of days had been awful, awkward passing of morning greetings with Draco, then spending her days trying to dodge the oncoming hexes so that Draco wouldn't be hurt.
'That's the first thing, you would never call him Draco, despite your engagement. He has always been Malfoy but since this whole compatible magic thing came to light, that's all changed.' Ron reasoned. 'You would have fought it head-on, you would have put up more of a fight than you have -'
Draco peered at Aria's face, he had been too comfortable to move before now, Aria too in spite of the way their current conversation was going. Aria seemed perplexed.
Ginny and Hermione exchanged a look, Aria said nothing. She did not know how she felt. She too had asked herself the same question about how the compatible magic, Draco and she shared might affect her. Though she was pretty sure it was not clouding her judgment as Ron put it. It felt the opposite - Fleur said that it was about sensing his magic but it didn't feel like that at all ... Draco's magic, for since she had found out about their compatible magic she had been trying to see if she could sense it. But it wasn't like sensing an emotion or an entwining of magic - it was protective ... the more time she spent with him, her head seemed to become clearer ... and her repetitive nightmares had been kept at bay - the last time she was at the Malfoy Manor - the Manor itself felt like it was encased by his magic - like he was projecting a shield around her.
'There's a reason why it's so honoured Aria, though compatible magic is common - true compatibility is not.' Hermione said. 'In some cultures, it is so honoured that people will only marry those with compatible magic.'
'No, I'll see you in the morning.' Aria said dismissing him. She summoned a towel from the floor and began to vigorously dry her hair with it. Draco stared at her, no wonder her hair was always a mess. He walked across the room Aria looked up the moment his feet had come to a distance she could see upon the floor.
In the next instant time froze as Aria's green eyes met the stormy grey eyes that belonged to Draco. She had never noticed that about him either, how stormy his eyes were. The air itself seemed to shift and Aria was unsure on whether it was Draco's magic that made the air intensify or whether it was something else entirely. But then it seemed to not matter how the air felt warm, for nothing else mattered, as Aria was swept up in Draco's magic as it wrapped around her providing its usual blanket of protection. Nothing mattered as lips brushed her own; almost ghost-like - the stormy eyes searched her own, for what she could not tell, and then Draco's lips found hers again. Forget about time freezing; Aria felt like she was melting or drowning, but then she chose to forget everything she was thinking and allowed herself to absorb the moment.
"There is no plan." The words kept running through his head. It just wasn't Aria. Normally she would be fighting. The DA would be up and running again and she'd be teaching the first-years how to defend themselves.
'You told me you choose your family,' Draco said, 'I knew the Black tapestry was in disarray, I couldn't add your family to the one at the Manor, the ancient enchantments are far too old. This was the best way to let you know, that well - they choose you back.'
'Yes, yes,' Aria said offhandedly. 'I'll behave.' And if Marge did act up, Aria could always think back upon her face as Marge blew up the last time she had come to visit to cheer herself up.
'It's not the only reason,' Draco said firmly, 'It's a reason yes, but not the only one.' There was a long pause, and Aria's head finally turned back towards him, her green eyes meeting his own. 'It's not the only one,' Draco repeated again. 'I changed for you ... because of you, you made me a better person. I like spending time with you - and those Patronus lessons ... you're my happy memory - I want to be with you, I want to get you ... understand you - ultimately be one with you - I love you Aria.'
Draco was about to correct her, but Aria merely raised her eyebrows shaking her head slightly, so he chose not to, 'My mother wanted us to offer our condolences, she is unable to make itself. You will have to forgive me ... I have only ever met Aria before; I'm Draco, Draco Malfoy.'
'They ... never liked me, they tried to "stomp" the magic out of me,' Aria said softly, her face tilted down towards the shelf of the vanity unit. Draco's hands stilled, he glanced towards the mirror and saw a pained expression on her face. 'How you saw Marge treating me ... that was basically every day of my life. Girl cook the breakfast, don't burn the bacon. Girl take the trash out, it's all your good for.' she paused wrinkles creasing her forehead as though lost in thought, and Draco returned to drying her hair. 'They made sure that I knew I was not wanted, that I was unwelcome in their home.'
'But you still decided to say something?' Blaise said, and Draco watched his friend's hands massaging his temple, 'I swear Potter's usual attitude of not doing the smart thing is rubbing off on you!'
'She attacked me-' Aria huffed, then smirked. 'Well tried and failed. Was boasting about setting the marquee on fire ... so wasn't hard to catch her off guard and bring her here.'
'How did you know?' Aria found herself asking, she looked up from the bracelet to the blue eyes, which remain cool and calm. 'That I was Draco's compatible match?' The smirk she gave though, said it all.
It was that thought that made up her mind for her, Aria straightened her back, head held high. She was doing this - doing this for Draco but most importantly she was doing this for herself.
"Dumbledore is dead. The Order is no longer safe, especially if I go there, they - The Order will be compromised."
'Wine?' his mother asked, changing the subject. Pouring some into Potter's glass before she could even answer, 'Oh you've had your nails done.'
Every fiber of his being was enraged. His wings spread of their own accord, hands became taloned, Draco lifted himself into the air and slammed straight into Cygnus.
'He would,' Aria said, 'that's Draco's cousin; Cygnus Neumann.' She knew instantly why he had been drawing so much attention, 'and yes, he's a Veela.'
'I hadn't quite finished!' Aria said, and she took a breath, 'Yes he hasn't changed completely - but he is different. It's hard to explain.'
'Yes ... it is a very old custom, the reason behind the bracelet is no longer followed, for it used to be a sign of a claim to warn other Veela off that had similar magical compatibility to the intended, that they were already taken. The charms of protection and runes came in much later.'
"Yes, I can, thank you, My Lord." Aria said and added thoughtfully, "though Draco is more than capable at demonstrating if it is required and I would not dare tutor anyone without his presence."
Potter was a completely different person when she was on her own. Or had he just not noticed how shy and reserved she could be. Or her sweet nature, or how her eyes light up as she tried to take in her surroundings all at once. And Potter said that he had lived a sheltered life!
'Don't change.' Draco whispered into her ear. 'Not your rambles, not the way you get so engrossed by something that you can't think of anything else. Not your determination of making things better. I vowed not to change you, now I'm asking you. Don't change a single thing.'
'They finally announced the eight-year accommodation,' Hermione said, 'Looks like as they are so many of us returning, they can't fit us into the dorms - so they built one for us, and we'll be sharing it with the other eight-years, they're calling it Memoriam Cornu.'
'No your not, we need to get you to the hospital wing, but first, your going to have to move your wings.'
'That's Slytherin for - I know you're right but I'm not going let you think that.' Aria retorted smugly. 'It makes sense though, if you think about it, it's bound to have lots of animals living around it like badgers, foxes which happen to live in dens. Rabbits - but that's warrens and deers live in thickets-'
'I didn't fix the family tapestry Aria,' Draco responded, 'I restored it, to its former glory. And added to it, slightly.'
Draco scowled, pausing as he wrote, bloody Cygnus. Bloody stupid Defence Against the Dark Arts, stupid lesson, had to ruin everything. Draco returned to his letter, there was no pointing dwelling on what had happened, he just had to correct it. He just had to. Draco could not get the image of Aria almost breaking down, of how she shook when she been ... well it wasn't exactly speaking to him, but he did not want to think of it as anything else. But her words, the last words he had heard her speak, "I want nothing ... nothing to do with you", Draco ran a hand through his hair again, he had no clue what to say, how to fix this, but by Merlin did he want to.
Aria began to read, alongside Granger, the Gryffindor boys, started talking amongst themselves, Finnigan providing the entertainment.
The words whirled around in his mind as though he was committing them to memory, trying to intake just how they had been spoken. Of course, he hadn't minded spending time with Aria ... so why was his mind so fixated on three words? It's not like it had been the first time Aria had arranged to spend time with him. Draco had thought that naturally their time together at Hogwarts would be limited, they moved in different circles. And he gathered she would want to spend most of her time spending it with her friends ... but then, she had been the one to say it, those words ...
Aria shrugged, it wasn't like Draco didn't know what her new obsession was. He had been with her when she had created the very wand she had moments ago been holding.
She thought that maybe she was trying to look for things, that Malfoy was up to something. Then she thought she most likely was doing so because Malfoy had so far stuck to his oath. Aria had done a bit of reading up on magical oaths - which it turned out to be different from vows, the intent was the same - just without the death of the person who took it broke it. Though somewhat pleased Malfoy wouldn't die if he broke his oath, it didn't settle her worries.
So Voldemort was checking in on her. Ron thought. Things were becoming much clearer. There was a plan. But no plan that Aria would or could tell him personally. And he felt hurt by that knowledge. She clearly trusted Hermione even though Hermione was not at Hogwarts for how else were the messages being communicated to them in the first place. Ron would do as he had been asked. He would wait for the plan. For now, all they could do was damage control. Ron's hand trembled slightly as he picked up his fork. He fucking hated the Cruciatus Curse. He hated the Carrows even more.
The words caused Draco to grimace, he could not lie to his grandmother, there was the added factor that his mother got along well with her. 'I ... that is my fault.'
This had been a very bad idea - coming here, agreeing to this stupid ... engagement ... Aria's hands curled into fists at her sides.
'No,' Andromeda said calmly, 'she wouldn't want to take him away from me -' she glanced at his mother, 'it's not my place to say why, she just knows how it feels -'
'Don't get what Draco?' Aria replied though she did not look up from the book she held in her hands.
'Arm,' Aria said, gesturing with her hand for him to hand it over. Draco looked at her skeptically, he sighed and held it out for her.
'I - I'm sorry, I just - can't handle - I thought,' Aria turned her head away, 'I'd thought I'd be able to handle it - it's not as though I'm not used to hearing such things.'
Silence filled the air, there was not much that needed to be said, but Aria did have a question to ask.
Maybe winning wasn't all that important. Because it did not compare to the warmth and affection Aria's eyes held, nor did it compare with the way that her magic filled the air so intensely that caused people to turn their heads. Had people forgotten just how powerful Aria was? Aria soon noticed the stares, for a blush graced her cheeks, the warmth of her magic faltered from the air.
'He must be -' Fleur said, 'there is no mistaking what you are wearing. And only Veela give bracelets like that - see each rune engraved into it - protection charms - and both your family crests to honour each one as the magic itself is honoured.'
Kingsley had fallen silent, there was a scurry of people rising from their seats, as soon as Kingsley bowed his head slightly, silence fell. Hundreds must have come for this gathering, but not one cough broke out, Aria smiled to herself at that, the community had come to respect the fifty people who had given their lives fighting.
Hogwarts in one word was now boring and Aria thought having Umbridge around had been bad. At least the trip to the forbidden forest had sort one lousy person out. Aria hated it, every dismal second that she walked the halls. She disliked what had become of the only home she had ever known. The looks of contempt and the mutters students used to swear at her under their breaths she was far used to, even the teachers looked at her as though they didn't recognise her anymore. If they only knew that she wanted the same thing as them. If they only knew that she disliked the torture curses thrown at misbehaving students as much as the rest of them. The poor first-years were scared to even speak in fear of doing something the Carrows deemed punishable.
Ron thought about it. It made so much sense. Aria had realized that Voldemort would go after The Order members. None of The Order members close to Dumbledore were working now. And the ones that were, couldn't send messages via Patrnous's freely.
'Quite all right,' his mother said sweetly, sparing a glance in his father's direction, stopping him from contradicting her, 'we've not been waiting long - no harm is done - a simple warming charm has kept the food warm, be sure to help yourself to as much as you want, Aria.'
As soon as they walked to the end of the seventh-floor corridor, Aria smiled, it seemed that Draco had not taken her friend's advice for long, and sure enough, Draco was walking up the staircase towards them. Aria giggled the moment he caught sight of them. Since Draco had shielded her with his wings, she felt giddy.
'Look at that,' Aria laughed, 'we actually have something in common - apart from being excellent flyers - who'd have thought.'
A card dropped in front of Aria's plate. She recognised the neat handwriting straight away; Draco's handwriting. It read; you asked, now you shall receive. My gift will give you a hint into the last meaning behind the knot rune. Before Aria had the chance to glance up petals of white and red fell over her head, showering her completely. She couldn't believe him ... what had he been thinking, of all the things he had to remember her little list of things she'd asked for at the top of her head. Aria brushed a few of the petals out of her hair and onto the pile that had fallen on the Gryffindor table. Magically the fallen petals transformed into a bouquet of red and white roses.
Draco emitted another sigh but said nothing. There was so much Aria had not told him, she considered telling him what it had been like, to try and make him understand, however, his magic calmed hers, and she relished in it.
'Wow ... we're what .. a week in and you already know my story,' Aria said, shaking her head, 'just not who I am.'
"The solution to your problem is here with us," Voldemort said casually, returning to the matter at hand. "Draco has graciously accepted the task of being your guard. The bracelet you now wear is part of a pair. The other attached to Draco. He is now responsible for you."
Aria turned her head away from him, she needed her courage; insecurities, however, won out. "This can't go wrong Draco. I need to be sure."
Ginny laughed, 'Ha! Like she's going to agree to come shopping with a Muggle-born, and two Weasleys. I think you've got some wishful thinking Aria.'
So subdued by his own thoughts, he had not heard the first-year Slytherin girl, until she was right next to him, the sound of her voice made him almost jump. 'You really screwed up, you know.'
Draco's ego slightly deflated at the embarrassment Aria caused. She had kissed him? Ha, he didn't think so, well she had but he had initiated the kiss. Aria gave him one last knowing smile, as though she could tell what was on his thoughts, before sliding into her seat. She looked extremely bored as the class began. He supposed an expert at the Patronus Charm would be, though it seemed as though she still had to get the knack of casting it nonverbally, as she had not been able to cast a corporeal Patronus non-verbally, only producing a cloud-like silver barrier that formed a shield. Draco laughed at the sight Aria produced halfway through the lesson, clearly fed-up with her boredom, she had once again begun to try casting the spell non-verbally, her face was screwed up, eyes closed and nose twitching.
'It won't be just anyone,' Blaise muttered, 'it will be one of her lot - it will be one of the members of Dumbledore's Army.'
The remembrance of the battle of Hogwarts was being held outside on the school grounds, and the day itself was crisp and clear, the only upside was that classes had been cancelled for the day. Aria stared at herself in the mirror, her dress robes were a light shade of blue, but it was not the dress she was taking any notice of what she had pulled out of her trunk. She was too busy taking deep breaths, and her death-like grip on the sides of the sink had not faltered. It felt so much like September first all over again, but today ... the anniversary of the battle Hogwarts, she felt like she was battling hard with herself ... her thoughts and emotions were all over the place but if she didn't make attempts to accept the fact that it was not her fault, then the guilt would always eat away at her.
'Some debts cannot be repaid, Aria,' Narcissa whispered back, 'and some debts are just not meant to be repaid. I too am indebted to you Aria, but you never wished for a repayment - you voiced no repayment. And when a person like that comes along it is best to leave the debt as it is- indebted. Besides you're a Malfoy now, you have made my son happy, given Lucius and I a life after the war, of which we played our fair parts and I never thought we would have, no Aria that for me is payment enough.'
"I forgive you." Aria yawned, stretching slightly. She reached out placing a hand on top of his, biting her lip. "I know." Her soft reply along with her startling green empathetic eyes said it all. She did not wish this upon him, she wished there was another way. "But I can't see you die."
Fingers ran through her hair, and Aria wallowed in the attention. Lips pressed against her forehead. 'Everyone grieves differently Aria, just because you're not crying now doesn't mean that you won't at all.'
'I'm sorry - I didn't mean it like that Aria,' Ron sighed heavily, 'I just ... don't want to see you get hurt - not after-'
'We'll leave you peace,' Weasley's mother said, getting up, breaking the silence, 'I'm glad it's all cleared up Aria, we shall see you for dinner Saturday.'
The end of the lesson could not have come fast enough. Malfoy seemed to be oddly confused, as Aria stood there glaring at him, tears still falling.
'I do not exactly fancy finding out that you've collapsed, Aria.' Draco said firmly, he then tilted his head towards the dummy, 'Reckon I stand a chance at winning this?'
Aria shook her head, what had he been thanking her for again? Oh, yeah, she had nodded, her body reacting of its own accord in her sleep-like state.
She sighed as one of her hands came to rest against her forehead. This had been going on for the last couple of weeks, she would find herself waking up abruptly in the middle of the night as though she had woken from a terrible nightmare. When in fact ... it was just the opposite, her dreams and been pleasant.
She felt like shouting, Anything! Anything else, then marry your son, please, I beg of you! But she did not, she was more mature than that ... she hoped. She was more deified than shouting to get her own way, though she was not above begging, and if it came to it she would. To hell with her dignity - she wanted her life - marrying Draco Malfoy had not been part of her life plans. At all! Begging sounded like an extremely good idea.
'Really D? Shotgun!' Potter retorted, pulling open a door to the back of the car, 'How old are you? Two?' Potter looked in his own direction when he showed no signs of moving, 'Well in you get Draco, or do you need me to open the door for you?'
Aria blinked, of course, Voldemort would be mad at him, no wonder Snape had been tortured, if he had kept this a secret, Aria never even knew that Snape had a daughter, Aria turned to Draco silently. This was their chance and only chance before Hogwarts. If Snape was truly on her side. Even though Dumbledore could no longer be saved, other lives could.
Draco watched her walk away to her waiting friends, Weasley was looking at Draco like he was a bit of filth, nothing unusual, Granger hurried Weasley away with Aria following them.
The loud sounding crack made Draco jump for he was not expecting it, neither had he been expecting for the person who had just Apparated to land so close that they caused them both to fall over, Draco's arms reached up automatically around what had fallen on him - or rather who. His eyes, which had closed, shot open and his breath caught in his chest as he found himself staring straight into familiar pools of emerald green eyes. Eyes which were embarrassed and blood-shot.
'Strange that,' Mr Ollivander said, 'Just a habit I got myself into ... learned all this from my father. Times were different when I grew up, women quite rightly have equal rights now.'
'Compatible magic?' Aria repeated, 'not much - from what I remember it's one of the most honoured types of magic.'
'M-m,' the dark-haired, young witch stuttered, she had not believed her own ears. Green eyes, searched the grey and blue eyes before her, in signs that they - that the elder woman had lost the plot. Mrs Malfoy however seemed to be extremely calm, and Draco Malfoy looked almost pleading, though she was not sure in what he's look was begging for; her to end this madness or go along with it. Aria Potter glanced from one to the other, sighed then cleared her throat to try again. 'Marry?' she managed to choke out, 'you want me to marry your son? In exchange for the life debt I owe you?' she had to repeat it all, or her brain would never believe it.
She sighed heavily, tilting her head back so that she faced the ceiling of the aeroplane. Dudley and Emily had fallen asleep some time ago.
'D, I think I've got the paperwork in my bag,' Emily said as soon as the door closed, with a frown upon her face.
'I don't get how you could be this close to someone who you've disliked for years,' Ginny said, indicating towards the picture, 'This is the same guy that tormented you for years - watched Hermione get tortured by his own aunt - in his own home!'
'Very well,' Mrs Malfoy said, 'We shall see you Sunday for dinner, no excuses,' she added the last part firmly, 'Lucius should be home from his stay in Azkaban.'
Ron looked at her with such disgust. Aria had to keep her emotions in check. Ron's eyes looked completely and utterly betrayed by her. Snape gave her a pointed look. Aria took a step and entered the Slytherin Common room. Leaving Ron behind and deal with the consequences that in no doubt in Aria's mind Snape would surely unleash upon Ron.
Blaise looked around at the busy street of Diagon Alley and the dirty looks and mutterings being thrown their way. 'Makes you wonder how Potter put up with this all these years - and never once lost it.'
Aria wasn't sure how much time had passed when the air shifted and she heard: 'Oh Aria why didn't you tell me?'
'Coeus!' Aria huffed, stupid falcon, well stupid owner more like. For the last week, Draco's falcon had turned up every day without fail, each time with a letter attached. Hadn't Draco got the hint? After-all Coeus had returned without a reply, and Aria had thrown the letters in a bin. She was debating on whether to let the falcon in or not, Aria sighed as she picked Epsilon up, placing her back into her basket - though Aria did receive a meow of protest.
The fact that Draco actually didn't care that she didn't know what she wanted to do with her life and was OK with that. Or the way his hands cupped her face whilst they kissed, holding her chin in a delicate grasp as though she was the most fragile thing he had ever held. Or just that his magic felt like nothing she had ever known, and she could get lost in it for days. The fact that Draco Malfoy made her feel stronger than she had in months - years - if she told the honest truth. But Aria said none of those things, Ron would not want to hear them.
That was another thing he liked about her - they had the same mannerisms. Not that Aria had noticed it yet - but they did both like to use their hands while they spoke to make their point. But he couldn't help the spring in his step - she had been with anyone like that, just like him.
'I was looking for you,' Aria said, feeling much calmer than before. The urge to hex something had disappeared the moment she heard his voice. It was wonderful how calming just from his sheer presence alone made her relax.
Aria zoned out the rest of his sentence, if Ripper was coming with Marge, then she would need to find somewhere safe for Epsilon and Coeus; who was still not budging since his arrival four days ago. Aria thought about taking them to Grimmauld, but Kreacher was old and as much as the elf seemed happier, Aria still didn't think leaving two animals with him was a smart idea.
This was going to be so much fun if the look on Malfoy's face was anything to go by. If she could just get Malfoy to call the whole thing off - or his father to get Narcissa to call it off, her life would be able to go back to normal.
Aria bit her lip, she didn't want to sympathise with the girl fearing that she may take it the wrong way, 'Yes that's the way through. You just go through the wall. Best take a run at it if you're nervous.'
'Sometimes,' Hermione said shaking her head, 'Just sometimes, I forget that you should have been placed in Slytherin.'
'No one can make wands as you do, Mr Ollivander,' Aria said, 'It turns out that I didn't need to buy a new one.' Though she was hardly going to tell him the reason why. 'I was actually here to ask you something, regarding wands and magical compatibility. You told me that wands always choose the wizard ... but they could be won, the alliance swayed - and that you could use another wand that wasn't your own. So if a person is magically compatible with another, then shouldn't their wand work for that person without it needed to be won -'
This had to be the oddest reunion Draco had ever come across. He knew that he had another aunt - he didn't know that his other aunt looked exactly like Bellatrix. His hand had stretched towards his wand in the first few moments of meeting her, but no one else had moved towards theirs. There was also the added fact that he had sensed Aria's magic from the woman - but upon a second glance he realised that it was not his aunt Aria's magic was wrapping around, but the baby boy that she held within her arms.
There was a flash of green within the fireplace and Potter stumbled through. Was she always this uncoordinated? She pushed her glasses back onto her face. Draco snorted at her soot-covered appearance, where had she come from to be covered like this? She glanced up at him, glaring intensely at him. Draco coughed awkwardly, unsure now what to do or say. Potter looked down at her appearance, gave an exasperated sigh, and pulled out her wand, with a flick the soot vanished, and another towards the fireplace, the soot disappeared from the floor surrounding the grate.
Draco murmured his agreement, it was disappointing that one person from their house had signed up. He looked at both Blaise's and Pansy's expectant faces. 'Fine, I'll do it.'
"Our Lord is an opportunist." Aria said, "he doesn't always think rationally, meaning we've got more than a slight chance at finding them."
Shit. Aria would be a fool not to know the meaning behind the coloured roses Draco had chosen, he was literally saying I love you intensely and my intentions are honourable. She gulped a card that had come with the roses and Aria picked it up slowly, her hand trembled as she did. This card just two words, in the same neat handwriting; Forgive me?
And Aria vanished without a further word, Draco hoped that this time she wouldn't be affected by withdrawal symptoms.
Aria had not been expecting that, her eyes widened, tears falling, as the audience in their seats all stood to stand ... every single last one of them. Hundreds of people, all standing, all because of her. Aria may have felt like she could have done more, but she had also done so much, it was not until now that she could see it for herself, did she realise just what she had even done.
Aria nodded, 'Yeah, it's how wands are made, the core has to be compatible with the type of the tree used. That's why there are so many combinations -'
'No, I'm better.' Aria retorted. 'I'm Aria Potter, it would be wise for you to not forget that. I'm not wasting my time with this or on you - it is beneath me. You want to harm me go ahead and try. You want the Malfoys to see me as someone who does not belong, go right ahead. The thing you do not understand is that they already know. And yet here I am, still standing, a half-blood in one of the purest blood houses there is, and about to marry into it. So good luck Celena, you're going to need it.'
'The Ministry can sue me later,' Aria said, 'besides, you missed one little factor Draco. The Muggles are all sleeping.'
'Much better,' Aria murmured happily as she felt his magic reach out and wrap her in its shields again. 'How ... what happens now? If we don't...'
Ron greeted them before Aria could say anything further, 'Morning beautiful, morning Aria.' He sat down on the other side of Hermione, while Neville took up the free seat next to Aria. The hall bustled with giggles and the occasional sounds of someone trying to discreetly gag, Valentine's Day had not changed at all, even the swarm of owls inundated with parcels was to be expected.
'Oh, shut up, you.' Aria replied Draco noticed her cheeks were a little flushed and her small smile. Her magic felt at ease, which in turn made Draco feel the same way, he slipped his hand towards hers and squeezed it. 'Library?'
'Thank you.' Everyone returned to their seats, Kingsley continued. 'The defeat of Voldemort would not have been possible, without those who chose to fight that day, so I am going to honour those who deserve to be acknowledged, the remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix, the staff members of Hogwarts, the members of Dumbledores Army ... because without them we wouldn't have been so well informed. To the villagers of Hogsmeade who came to fight when we had begun to think all was lost, the wizarding community is in your debt.'
'Susan Bones and Hannah Abbott, as well,' Pansy said thoughtfully, 'So far I've only heard about Daphne signing up.'
It came out like she had asked a question, she had not meant to, she was a bit relieved to see him. She was just surprised to see him in the Weasley household of all the things. She never thought that he would come here voluntarily or that Mrs Weasley would Firecall him. Some part of her believed herself to be caught up in a very strange dream that was until Draco reached out taking her hand in his and squeezing it.
'Well that sounds like fun,' his mother said, and somehow Draco knew where she was going with this before she even said anything. 'Why doesn't Draco go with you, even up the numbers - you can get to know one another as well then.'
'What's wrong?' Aria asked, well more demanded. 'It is Ron? George?' Please don't let it be George again, she could only handle that conversation once. Poor thing. The whole family had been devastated after losing Fred, but George ... had not been handling it well. He had drunk himself stupid ... so stupid he almost, almost, landing up killing himself. That was until Aria had spoken with him. Had pushed past her own issues, pushed away from her feelings of guilt, she had stepped into The Burrow, seeing them all for the first time in months, just to have words with George. Though she had never been as close to the twins as she had been Ron, she had always respected them, too much to let George stumble into the gloom, where his twin brother would not have wanted him to be. Somehow after hours of being locked up in the twins' old bedroom, she had got through to him. Now George was planning on opening up Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes again. 'Anyone?'
Draco's eyes were so intense with emotions, 'You realise I am meant to be the one bestowing gifts upon you ... not the other way around.'
'It's a pure-blood tradition too,' Ginny added, 'arranged marriages were based upon compatible magic.'
Aria felt like she was completely spoilt for choice, Potions, which was not her best subject, or a subject that she had always fallen asleep in. 'Potions. I might be able to remember more of that.'
"Let's get out of here before Snape comes," Ron said looking around the corridor wildly. "Seamus keep a lookout."
"Well, what do we have here. An attack on the Slytherin House on the very first night and three students from the Gryffindor House at the helm of it. I can assure you that Miss Potter does not need a rescue, she is completely safe within the Dark Lord's hands. I do believe you lot are not going to be once I gave him this information."
'I'm certain,' Aria said, she was so close to Draco now, that she was able to press her lips to his ear. 'I'm a Malfoy.'
'Draco has a new one,' Mrs Malfoy replied coolly, 'the one you ... required from him, will not work the same way for him again. You said so yourself when you battled the Dark Lord; "the wand chooses the wizard".'
Mrs Weasley sighed heavily, and closed her eyes, 'Aria,' her name was spoken so softly, and with such tenderness. 'You have long been part of our family, your problems are our problems.' Mrs Weasley looked at her, straight in the eye. 'Never feel like you can't come to us ... it took for George to - well until then for you to see us. However much we're grieving Aria, we would never turn you away. A year?' Mrs Weasley confirmed, Aria nodded. 'Still, I wish you have spoken to us, instead, we had to find out via this, paper.'
Their bonding was just a few days away. Draco gulped at the thought of that. Aria even though she called herself a Malfoy now - which made him want to grab her and ravish her on the spot every time she did so - Draco was forcing himself to wait, partly because he still couldn't believe that they were bonding. It baffled him to no end. He still had to figure out how his mother had figured Aria to be his compatible match. And his feelings being returned - he never thought for one moment that Aria would ever return his feelings.
Draco opened his eyes, eyebrows arched up into a questioning look, 'What do you think I'm trying to do?'
Draco had known this would be awkward for his friends to accept ... but there wasn't much choice in it - Aria had been his match and his family stood by the old values - it was worse for a Veela as they only choose those they had true compatibility with. 'We're still getting to know one another ... and she's made me realise that Muggles aren't as bad as we were led to believe - that they're not dirty ... well, you know...'
'I know.' Cygnus said softly his wings and taloned hands disappearing, 'but I wasn't after Aria, Draco. I'm Indebted to her!'
'Ah Draco, you made it,' Potter said, having spotted his approach. 'This is my cousin Dudley, everyone calls him D, and this is Emily. Guys this is Draco.'
'It's a husky.' Aria said, willing her best friend to understand, and fortunately, they had been friends long enough for Ron to get the message.
But this was no dream, as Hermione was currently sharing tentative glances with her, and Ron looked paralyzed from sheer shock. And she had most certainly not expected him to turn around and ask for her to help him with Defence Against the Dark Arts.
'I do not know,' his mother said, 'Aria did not say ... I tried to find out ... I had no luck, they were not overheard.'
The question should have been so easy to answer ... but she realised now, that there was more behind the comment that brought her here.
Draco squeezed Potter's shoulder, 'If you need anything, just knock.' He felt reluctant to leave her in such a state. 'I'll be awake, I haven't been able to get to sleep.' she looked as though she was about to protest and Draco interrupted her before she could, and said as sincerely as he could, so she would know he actually meant it; 'I mean it, Aria, if you need anything, just knock.'
Draco's heart warmed. She was too forgiving. He did not deserve such an intended, but he had her. He would do his best to keep it that way.
Draco frowned, but seemed happy with her explanation, 'It doesn't answer everything else though - at why they cared more about the dog than you - you could have been seriously hurt.'
'Of course Aria,' Malfoy said, his posture stiff, his fist clenched at his side. 'May I call you Aria? We are engaged after all. You can call me Draco.'
"Yes. Which leaves us with four more to figure out. Along with where all six are hiding and finding a way to destroy them."
A loud screech emitted from the room, Draco turned to where it had come from hoping to see his falcon - but it was not Coeus, instead, it was a barn owl, one that landed with a paper attached to it. His mother crossed the room and relieved the owl, she crossed the room back to the doorway and opened unfolded the paper without a word. Leaving a rather confused Draco who had never seen his mother act emotional and his father who seemed to be frozen to the spot. Draco glanced awkwardly at him, his family had never been one for showing their emotions Draco was unsure what to do. On one hand, this was his father on the other it was the very same man that treated Aria unfairly - not that Draco could talk, but still.
Potter said it so seriously, Draco wasn't sure whether to believe her or not. And to bring up her own upbringing, degrade it in such a manner, like how he had been led to believe all Muggles were filthy and stupid. He had to hand it to her ... she had some guts.
'Yes, we best,' Draco held out his hand to gesture for her to follow, he was slightly surprised when she caught it, and he gave her hand an encouraging squeeze. 'Speaking of things I need to tell you -' it was Aria's turn to give him a questioning look, 'I do not know if I told you - you see, it is a tradition of ours to hold a family gathering -'
"You're sure I'm casting it right?" Aria whispered. Even though they were in the middle of the night and Draco had placed the room under that concealment charm that stopped overhearing, she did not want to risk everything. If they got caught now, her return to Hogwarts would not happen. Nor could the things they had set in motion.
'He's magically pure,' Ginny said, 'that's why he says he's a pure-blood because he comes from a magical family. It's the same with Fleur, part Veela, magically pure.'
'No!' Aria voice was firmer this time, 'I want you to tell me ... because if this is some weird way of breaking up with me -'
For the first time in ages, Malfoy smirked. Though this time she could tell that he was slightly impressed.
'You're a Potter too,' Draco said sincerely, his hand reached up to cup her cheek. 'Remember that always.'
'Yeah, when I said, friends, I meant the term loosely,' Potter replied, 'I'm going away with my cousin and his girlfriend, we're going to go skiing for ten days, travel to America for another ten days, we wanted to do a huge tour of Europe but Emily couldn't find enough - funds. So we're doing a small couch trip and seeing some of the main sights.'
Aria rolled her eyes, as Professor McGonagall finished her announcement, turning back to the book she had taken out on compatible magic, whilst she waited for dinner to appear. She had already scribbled down the items she would need, she just needed to speak with Hagrid. Ollivander said the best way to becoming a wandmaker was through experimenting with the cores and mixing combinations herself. She had no interest in any dueling competition ... she just wanted to start making her own wands, it literally became a new obsession.
'Please don't tell me you fancy him.' Aria rolled her eyes, fancying Draco Malfoy was not necessarily a bad thing, now she could see past the pompous selfish little prick she had first met. 'Or worse, that - you know - love him -'
'But you are returning to Hogwarts, yes?' Mrs Malfoy said, Aria nodded, 'So you will have plenty of time to spend with one another, and not just over the rest of the summer. I expect you do as much or I will change my mind back to my original request.'
Draco was about to voice his opinion on that matter when he recalled the fact that he had indeed referred to their house as The Den. 'You mistake me if you think I'll allow our home to be called that retched name. I referred to it like that, because you have been doing almost since I took you to see it.'
'That I knew I could do it because I had done it before,' Aria replied with a sweet smile upon her face, 'sometimes it takes more confidence by knowing you can do something to be able to do something. So yeah - my thoughts were I knew I could do it.'
Aria left the room, smirking as she headed back down the hall. Merlin that felt good. It was not long until someone called out to her.
'I've got something to do today,' Aria said, she still didn't understand why Marge was coming to help with arrangements, mostly everything had been done, 'I'll be back in time for dinner -' Aria added as Vernon raised his eyebrows at her. Heaven knows how Vernon or Dudley would have survived, either of them knowing how to cook, they didn't even know how to turn the oven on if Aria had not been around to do it. Vernon said nothing, returning to his paper and Aria left the kitchen.
Draco sighed, as Emily shared a look with Dudley. Potter looked rather pale, and as though she was about to be sick.
Draco stayed close to her. With the attack from her old Gryffindor friends. They had to stay alert. And only Draco's presence calmed Aria.
After weeks of hearing about the last activity Aria assembled together for inter-house unity, Draco decided enough was enough, and by the looks of it so had the rest of Hogwarts, as it looked like the whole school had turned up. The numbers were so vast that McGonagall had postponed the meeting for an hour so they could rearrange the Great Hall.
Hogwarts was packed, normally after the exams where over students could relax and bask in the sun summer. Draco was managing to do one of those things, being outside enjoying the sun, Aria had long ago nestled herself against him. It still amazed Draco that Aria was completely relaxed in his presence ... despite their past, despite all that happened between them, Aria was truly comfortable. Part of Draco wished that their complementary magic had nothing to do with it, but then he knew he would not have what he did now at this very moment in time. But when Arias magic felt as it was now, so at ease, Draco too relaxed. He saw no reason not to, after all this had been Aria's idea, and this way it gave Draco a view of the other competitors, as sections of the castle grounds had been cleared for dueling practices.
"What happens next? Because the Dark Lord has a whole army out there waiting to kill us, especially if he finds out about this," Zabini said.
'I'm fine.' Potter said, not looking at Draco but her cousin. And Draco knew that her nightmare was about the war, not something she could talk about in front of Emily.
"What makes you think I can be trusted?" Aria corrected and pointed at her throat. "I belong to the Dark Lord after all."
His wand was out as he turned to the offending sound - perhaps he had not erected the ward correctly after all. His fist clenched tightly around his wand when there was no sign of life.
The only place that could offer her a place of solace except for being in Draco's presence surrounded by his magic; Hogwarts library.
Aria bit her lip, as she stared down at it, it was as though she was wondering how to voice herself without hurting his feelings. 'I don't know if - the engagement ... I don't think we're ...'
'There's no way I'm doing that!' Aria said. 'This bracelet is the only thing that's allowing me any peace or quiet.'
She's not affected by his allure! He had to remember that. Forgot about the compatible magic ... concentrate on the matters at hand ...
'Oh, no Professor,' Aria said innocently, almost too innocently, a smirk forming on her face. 'I don't see much point as I'd be disqualified.' She moved her arm and the sleeve of her robe fell down enough to reveal something glittering on her wrist - the bracelet Draco had given her, and his cousin blinked at her as the bell rang. Draco couldn't help it he was smirking also, she had finally put the bracelet back on and did a bit of research by the sound of things. While she wore the bracelet, which protected her from hexes and jinxes she wouldn't be allowed to compete in any dueling tournament.
'As long as -' Aria glanced towards Malfoy, 'he - agrees to my conditions, and doesn't try to change anything about me in any way.' She had to add it, for her own sanity, she could picture it now, Malfoy changing her hair, clothing, her dorky round glasses, personality just to please himself.
'Yes, true,' Aria said, giving up trying to read and talk at the same time. 'You should warn your friend that if he doesn't want to see himself hexed to back off. I get what he's trying to do, I understand he feels like he needs to repay them, but he won't repay it by following them around everywhere ... what does he think is going to happen? Someone will attack two of the war heroes and he'd be there to jump in to stop it?'
'What's going on Draco?' Aria's voice was soft and unsure. Draco knew that there would be no fooling her, Aria would be able to sense it within his magic if he tried, Draco was certain of that.
Aria did not quite understand who this him was. Perhaps they had called for a Healer ... not going to St Mungo's sounded really good, because Aria doubted she would be able to find the strength to stand again. It was times like these she was grateful that she had people who cared about her. Mrs Weasley had stuck her head into the flames of the fire .. calling whoever this apparent him was. Aria groaned letting her head fall to the table.
Draco stood with his hands in his pockets, glancing around the platform that was swarming full of people, other witches, and wizards all doing the same thing. The term had come to an end starting the three-week break over Christmas, meaning the cold weather had also set in. Draco drew his cloak tighter around himself and replaced his hands into his pockets. The sound of the Hogwarts Express pulled Draco's attention towards it and he watched as the train came to a stop.
'No, it's got nothing to do with Goyle bugging the hell out of us.' Ron said, and his head turned slightly, a frown etching his facial features. 'I'm far more concerned about you -'
Aria blinked at him, and something about her bemused expression made Draco add without thinking, 'I want to bond with you! Not break up!'
Draco too glanced up school, he had not been keen on coming back to Hogwarts. He was glad he had but even more so for the school year to be over. 'I know I am, I'll be glad to see the back of this place - start afresh.'
The door opened to the room Aria was being kept in. The first thing she saw was Voldemort's gleaming red eyes, though Aria would not find a hint of motives there. He didn't look like he was going to kill her at that exact moment for his wand was not at hand. He was not alone. Pale-faced more than normal entered Draco Malfoy carrying a tray upon which had the lastest meal. Aria caught Draco's eye. Just how humiliating, she had not been released for meals. The person who came with them usually had to try to force her to eat. The last Death Eater that tried left covered with food. Aria didn't care if she hadn't acted very ladylike when she spat the food out all over the Death Eater she barely remembered the name of.
'In the garden,' Aria said, 'I've told Draco I wouldn't and could not stand having the wedding inside the Manor itself, like his ancestors ... not after - all that happened. The garden was a good compromise. Narcissa is already talking about taking me shopping for my dress, I turned her down as a one on one, told her she'd be more than welcome to come with us.'
Aria frowned at the offending being that had jumped upon her for attention. Epsilon rubbed her face against one of Aria's hands. Definitely not a dream then. After several more nudges of her cat's head against her hand, Aria complied beginning to pet her. 'Alright fusspot, I got your point. But don't meow at me in dislike, when your fur ends up in a mess.'
Aria slammed the door to the guest room she had been shown to earlier behind her, and slid down the door, sinking slowly until she met the floor.
'Right well now we've established that Malfoy and Aria do actually love each other, can we get down to more important business.' Ginny said, looking at them both hopefully, 'Because I do believe we are in need of some serious shopping, and there is arranging everything, like the flowers - where are you getting married ... the Malfoy Manor?'
'Quite a few people I've spoken with - well people that have stopped me,' Bill corrected himself, 'say that it's such a commendable thing of you to do. Spend time - give someone a second chance that shouldn't have had one.'
'Of course, I was,' Aria muttered, withholding the sarcasm from her voice. How had she talked herself into this again, and why of all the subjects did it have to be history. No wonder she was beginning to fall asleep.
'Sorry, I forgot Emily had it, it's in her bag.' he replied quite calmly and closed the boot. 'We're all good to go.'
'So you'll promise to kiss me lots when I see you next?' Draco inquired. This earned him an exasperated sigh and a playful shove.
Aria looked up from the desk of the small room she had been using for an office, unicorn hairs and feathers laid out on the desk in front of her.
Draco hardly needed telling twice or the encouragement to steal Aria away from the rest of his family. He had no intentions of dancing with her, however, well at least not in front of his family members. He smiled unsurely towards Aria and gestured with his head towards the doors of the room. Draco steered her to the other end of the Manor when it became clear to Aria that they were doing so, she asked.
The second practice dummy stood no chance against the lash of water, the curse sliced the dummy in half. Aria took deep breaths to calm herself as the dummy's top half fell to the floor. The door opened to the room of requirement, Aria whipped around at the sound, wand still at the ready. Ron and Hermione were at the door, Aria shouldn't have been surprised by their arrival, of course, they would know where to find her.
'It already feels like your magic,' Aria said, eyes taking in all that she could observe, 'it's faint, but I can tell.'
'Like I said I have nothing to prove to you - and if you think you are worthy of Aria Potter then perhaps you should listen to the latest rumours you caused - she's not very happy with you after all is she -'
"Maybe this was a mistake Draco." Aria found herself muttering. Draco had taken great lengths to conceal this very classroom Aria now stood in, hidden in the depths of dungeons, long forgotten about. So forgotten that portraits no longer hung on the walls of the corridor or in the rooms along this very hall. It was perfect for them in every way. It did not mean that for one second Aria felt safe about these prospects. It could all go wrong in a manner of seconds and Aria was very prepared to cast the memory charm if she had to.
It was in Rome that they started their coach trip and it gave Draco an excuse to closer to Potter than normal, though they had sat together side by side on the plane it was not for a long length of time He re-framed from rolling his eyes as Potter took the seat nearest to the window. It was like watching a child that didn't want to miss out on anything as she looked out of the window constantly. From Rome, they traveled to Pisa, then to Florence, then to Venice. Each time they stopped Potter's face would look around as if stunned by what she was seeing.
Aria did not challenge him. She knew he would have already been told what happened on her first night. And Aria told him in her own words what happened.
'To be honest, I'm still finding this compatible magic thing ... a bit daunting.' Aria said, 'It's like it's changed Draco - or well ... if I tell you something - promise you won't tell anyone else?' Neville and Luna both nodded. 'Draco swore a magical binding oath - so I don't know if it's that ... his being a Veela - the compatible magic - or that fact that he, you know ... might actually like me.' Aria rubbed at her face, 'so, yeah, it's daunting.'
Aria felt like she was going to be sick. "Did you hear him? Wondering what a person would become if they ripped apart their soul."
'I know.' Aria said, pocketing the wand. Back when she first heard them, she hadn't known just how big of a deal the actual words had meant. Things were different now, she understood a lot more.
'Ron, please I'm not arguing with you over this, again. All I've heard from you is how much Goyle is annoying you, or about Draco -'
"What do you expect me to do?" Aria said gesturing to her choker. "Dumbledore is dead and I belong to the Dark Lord."
'I think the bigger picture is here,' Hermione said taking the Daily Prophet from Ron, 'is who they are trying to blame for your current condition.' she glanced over the article, 'though they mention no names they are heavily insinuating that it was foul play -'
Dudley grabbed what was clearly Potter's bag, placed it in the car, then did the same with Draco's looked around before he whispered, and even though the Muggle looked terrified, his voice had a threatening sound to it, 'Aria has told me a lot about you - so I'm going to make this clear only once - Aria has had enough shit to deal with, so if you in anyway wreck this holiday for her - or if you upset my cousin in any way, I'll kick your arse.'
'No, you just dislike the teacher - if you hate him so much, why don't you just ask Potter for lessons?' Pansy stated just as the girl in question came around the corner. 'You know as well as I do that she taught all of their little army. They're still hoping that she'll reinstate it.'
"You serve a greater purpose to me by me not killing you Aria." He glared. Aria did not understand. What purpose could that be? "Make no mistake I will kill you if you ever betray me or attempt to. No matter my reasoning for keeping you alive now."
Sirius looked bemused, but Ron laughed. There was a plan. Aria was spying and Dumbledore's Army was reinstated. Ron's coin went warm in his pocket. He grabbed at a quill and ink. Scribbling down the message.
'I have nothing to prove - unlike you.' Cygnus replied, 'Get out of my sight Draco before I give you a detention.'
'I'm Aria Potter,' she said shrugging it off, 'normal rules don't seem to apply when it comes to me.'
Once Great Hall doors opened, and the students from all the houses and years filed in - confused by the emptiness of it. Aria stood near where the teachers' table would usually be, Professor McGonagall stood beside her.
Aria understood though she said nothing as they walked into the dining room. Dinner had once again been laid out for them.
The spell cascaded towards Aria and she braced herself mentally as much as possible. The pain she expected to feel however did not come, at least not to her. Though the curse hit her it was Draco who had crumpled to the floor, screaming in pain. Aria's eyes went wide. Tears she did not know she had started to fall upon her cheeks.
His mother squeezed his shoulder, 'I'm sure she's just been busy and you'll most likely hear from by the end of the day.'
Draco pulled at the towel within her hands, shaking his head at her, Aria just pulled the towel away from him, frowning at him, 'I just figured out why your hair is so messy ... do you not care about -'
Aria took a deep breath before shutting the train door behind her. It had taken at least half an hour just to get through the crowd of people. She heaved her trunk along the corridor and slid open the last compartment door in the hopes that she would find one of her friends.
That was until he caught sight of the monstrous thing they would be getting on, to get to their destination.
'Draco?' Mrs Malfoy turned to her son, Aria followed suit. He seemed hesitant to speak, maybe just maybe he too was thinking of a way out of this. She could never be what he would want after all; Pure-blood, pretty, smart - apart from Quidditch and Defence Against the Dark Arts, she had never shown any talent for anything. Then Malfoy did something she had not ever expected.
'Oh get over it! I could have been in Slytherin ... big deal!' she called out over the chatter that had broken out, waving it off. 'And lastly, if you have ever been judgemental of a person.'
'Carl Webster?' Draco confirmed, 'The Hufflepuff -' he trailed off, causing both Pansy and Blaise to snort at him, some habits were hard to break. 'Well, he's not very good at defense now is he?'
'Oh mine was really good, Gran's like a different person - can't stop telling me how proud she is.' Neville said.
'I- I was hoping she wouldn't say anything ... but I - after everything - I think it's a good idea,' Aria said. 'I'm fed up of hearing Slytherins are bad - when yes, a few have given the house a bad name, but they're not all bad - look at Snape!'
Draco sneered at the direction the voice had come from, his friend was shaking his head at him, 'Fuck off Blaise ... just - fuck off.'
"Then you will train Crabbe and Goyle until you are satisfied and any other Slytherins that require tutoring." Voldemort was doing exactly what Aria and Draco expected him to do. Voldemort thought he would have more eyes on Aria if he allowed her to do this. "If you can do so without needing to demonstrate spells to them."
'Professor Neumann will take the position of Defence Against the Dart Arts - I'm sure you'll all make him feel welcome -'
'Of course not!' Draco replied, 'You're welcome here anytime you like. Do you want to talk about it?'
"Then we'll go through a secret passway, get you to Sirius's. He's gone crazy with worry." Ron said tugging at her wrist. Neville starting to walk down the corridor a few steps.
'I never said that,' Draco said, 'Just seemed like something Granger would say.' Aria smiled, shaking her head lightly, 'So what have you been doing?' Draco repeated as he rubbed the dirt from Aria's face.
Draco turned sharply at the voice, coming face to face to a freckled-faced red-headed Weasley. Thus far the Weasley brood had kept their distance, mostly Draco thought out of respect for Aria. It was not the Weasley Draco had been expecting to have words with him, instead, Draco was face to face with a stocky, red-haired, one ear Weasley, who Draco knew to be several years ahead of himself and in Hogwarts was never seen without his brother in tow. But Fred Weasley had died in the battle, leaving his twin George on his own.
'Haven't you considered the possibility that I'm fed up with fighting?' Aria replied, 'Why do you think that I haven't reformed the DA? Just because I didn't want to?'
'Merlin, Draco,' Aria exclaimed, and she turned deep red, 'I - it's not like - I - not that you need to know.' she rambled clearly struggling to find the words. 'Gosh, Draco, one of my best friends is a guy and he has quite a few older brothers. I think - we realised what they were up to, us girls.' she paused and added coldly, 'It's not hard to figure out - you know - especially when a guy and girl - run off together! I'm not stupid!'
'It's their first one ... without Fred,' Aria whispered, 'I don't want - I ... I know he was of age, that he made his choice but I still feel guilty and I wouldn't want to add to the reminder of what caused them to lose a son.'
'We have at least one thing on our side,' Theodore said, 'you - what you do now will impact the rest of Slytherin.'
'Oh I am,' Aria joked, 'I want to be showered with flower petals ... in front of a lot of people. Oh, a diamond ring that has encrusted emeralds and diamonds in the band ... I want snow, lots and lots of snow -'
'I'm over his death Hermione,' Aria said, she really didn't want to explain why she felt like the only room she was comfortable in was her godfather's old bedroom and that it was the only place she could fall asleep peacefully in. 'It's my house - Sirius's left it to me - I'll do what I want with it and if that means putting up with more toxic fumes Sirius implanted anywhere else, so his room wouldn't be changed - then, so be it.'
"It was knowledge that he wanted from the Ministry Aria. A Prophecy to be exact. That holds the reason why he tried to kill you in the first place. And he thought it would destroy you. For it says that you have a power he knows not. But you cannot survive whilst the other lives. The full prophecy if you wish to hear it is amongst one of my memory vials."
'Draco was unaware to expect me, for Lucius and I had declined his offer, I, however, changed my mind.' Narcissa said, looking over the surrounding crowd, 'I figured it best that I come alone - given the circumstances surrounding Lucius and what was our part -' Narcissa trailed off. 'Well you can understand, it is not like any harm will come to me.'
Aria couldn't figure it out, she chanced a quick glance to the seat next to her; Draco looked worn out from the previous night's advents. Had he been telling the truth when he said he had not been able to sleep or had she woken him up. And the way he looked at her, he seemed so concerned. He had not teased her after finding out about her nightmares, which she had been expecting, but nothing, no remarks of any kind. And there was the fact that she had felt safe when she had woken up and realised it was him, she just felt reassured somehow.
It looked no different - the teacher's table still placed in front of the four house tables, in the center was the throne-like chair that Dumbledore once used. It was one thing knowing that he was gone and another to actually see it. Aria looked around the Hall, so similar but yet so different ... the same Hall she had eaten meals in for so many years, and the same Hall that held all those lives they had lost in the final battle.
Ron's jaw dropped for a few seconds, 'Then - wow - true compatibility - for Malfoy's Patronus to be your favourite animal.'
Aria groaned then let out a breath of relief. 'Take a guess. Hi, Luna, Neville. Hermione and Ron in prefects compartment?'
The car journey was full of the most awkward conversation, he had ever had to encounter in Potter's presence. Full of things like; "so Aria said that you know each other from school", and "how did you start going out?". Potter was not helping him either, she sat there gleefully listening to his responses. This was why he disliked being around Muggles - he had no idea what to say or tell them without putting his foot in it and looking stupid. After a few hours, they reached the place Potter said Muggles called an airport. It was how they traveled all around the world without the use of a Portkey. He did not feel at all nervous, Potter's magic was slightly calming.
'Oh don't be so surprised, I'm just as cunning as you are,' Aria replied kissing his cheek, 'My boldness and bravery won out, the rest is history.'
Aria yawned completely bored, Defence Against the Dark Arts had moved onto magical bonds. And as far as she could tell she was not the only one.
'Did you rush into this - or was pushed into, some kind of agreement, with them - without advise or help - why Arthur or I could have - or one of the boys.' Mrs Weasley seemed to be struggling as to what to say first.
'I just don't feel like eating.' Aria found herself being somewhat honest with Mrs Weasley. It was rather strange though, she hadn't had this problem while she had been with Draco at the Manor, Aria had no problems there when she thought about it. She rubbed at her forehead willing the headache to go away.
Granger gave a heavy sigh, 'Well he can't bloody hex you that's for sure - his wand has been restricted.'
Draco's stormy grey eyes searched her own once more, and a warmness filled the air as his magic reached out. 'I honestly thought you knew. I - I'd thought you had worked it out when you had worked out about my Veela heritage. I gathered you'd figured out about the compatible magic, and how Veela's - ' he shrugged his shoulders, 'I know we should have told you from the beginning ... the truth that is ... but if I'm honest I couldn't face another rejection from you.'
Blaise gave him a sudden look of understanding. Theodore just raised an eyebrow. Then there was a sudden shout, that almost made them jump -
'It got too much!' she stated, she looked hastily around the sitting room for signs of life, she appeared to be relieved that Draco was alone. 'I hope you don't mind my turning up unannounced and early.'
'I'm not going to get hurt Ron,' Aria said, 'Besides, Draco swore that he wouldn't hurt me. I trust him. So even if you can't, could you at least trust me.' Aria stood up, intent on walking to the girls' dorms but stopped after several steps, she turned and faced one of her best friends. 'I'm tired Ron, I've had enough. I've done my part and I'm done fighting. I did what I was meant to do, I now want to live my life. I don't want to chase after any more crazy dangerous wizards, as much as I've loved the adventure that came with it. I don't want to be what people expect me to be anymore, I'm done.' Aria took a breath, looking at him as earnestly as she could. 'I'm done, Ron. No more fighting, the war is over, I just want to move on from it, and leave the shitty mess that it was, where it should be, behind me.'
Draco entered upon her shout, she had bathed he could from the way her hair was dripping wet. She also looked like she had been getting ready to settle in for the night, as she was wearing one of the long dressing gowns his mother had left for her.
Hogwarts wasn't Hogwarts anymore. That much was obvious, not even a week in, and everything that originally made Hogwarts was different. The Carrows were in charge of punishments and from what Ron heard he now guessed himself to be lucky to be handed detention with Hagrid in the Dark Forest. It had not stopped the hexes and jinxes from descending upon him whilst he walked the halls. How in Merlin's name had Aria coped all these years with it all?
Hermione searched her skeptically, sometimes ... just sometimes Aria wished she knew what was going on in her friend's mind, then she recalled the dreadful lessons with Snape and the curiosity died again - some things were best left alone.
Aria merely rolled her eyes at him. 'You try talking to a very stubborn unicorn Malfoy, about taking a tail hair without getting hurt.'
'What possessed you to try and clean Sirius's room anyway?' Hermione said rolling her eyes. She clearly had sensed it was time to change the subject.
Aria's hand went to her mouth, upon the moment she had pretty much opened the door and peered into the room. Tears welled in her eyes as she stepped forward, turning around to assimilate the room, her hand reached out, touching the tapestry nearest to her, then the hand clenched slightly as though she couldn't believe it.
'I can think of worse ways of spending my time, Draco. Forget it. Try a different memory. You're on the right track - just have a bit of patience -'
'You hurt her feelings Draco,' Pansy clarified, 'therego, that wonderful magical oath you told us you took - well you also happened to break -'
'So do tell us, you said you were going away, where exactly will you be traveling to? And you mentioned friends,' his mother asked.
'Figured you didn't have time, what with Quidditch and helping McGonagall.' Ron said, 'I've heard a lot about the activities from the younger students in passing.'
'We should be enjoying it while we can you know, the snow's not gone ... yet,' Ron commented, 'We should enjoy it before we all get jobs that ruin enjoying the nice weather.'
Draco found himself staring at the window, a little bored from all the last-minute checks, that he and his parents were doing in one of the sitting rooms within the Manor. He was fed up, considering they had already gone through the checks the previous day. Surely they didn't need to check the arrangements over this much.
Mrs Weasley let her after a few moments, 'Oh what a lovely bracelet,' she gave a thoughtful look, 'Bill has one - similar, not so feminine, but definitely like it.' she shook her head, as though she's had lost her original trail of thought. Which she had done, and Aria knew that, by what Mrs Weasley asked her next. 'Now, family dinner at seven on Friday, Ron and Hermione will have returned, and should be up for a get together by then, you'll be there, won't you?'
'Aria says that's judgemental, judging someone by certain behaviours or what house they are in.' Alana said, 'she's pretty cool, you know and you screwed up. She was happy ... she had told me so, said "I'm happier than I have been, for quite some time", and you screwed it up.'
'Magic flows through our very veins, Aria,' Narcissa said. Aria nodded her acknowledgment, she knew that. 'I could sense it, your sorrow, the love you held, the pain you felt. The power you wielded. It was like a fire in your very soul. It felt familiar like I had felt it before. I realised why the moment I embraced my son after the battle.'
Christmas day at Grimmauld Place was dark and dismal. But even Sirius's old house seemed better than Hogwarts at the moment. Upon Dumbledore's death, they had to place several of the Order's homes under The Fidelius Charm, they even had to redo Grimmauld Place because it had become so vulnerable due to having too many secret keepers upon Dumbledore's death.
'Muggle-born?' Aria said, turning to the voice. The girl reminded her so much of herself. She looked so small, though her girl before her had tidy brown hair and hazel eyes.
'He - he's not stuck up that's for sure -' Ginny raised her eyebrows, 'I know,' Aria said, 'but I know what I saw and who I've been with -'
Aria felt and heard something click onto her wrist. The strangest thing happened, something that didn't make sense. She felt oddly warm for a few moments, just like when she had first held her wand. It was as though her magic was trying to tell her something.
'Why are you doing this?' Aria said softly her eyes closed, another frown reached her face, 'If it wasn't for the fact I can tell you mean me no harm, I wouldn't let you ...'
Draco was unsure as to why Aria looked so nervous the morning of the Hogsmeade weekend, but she did, and her magic had a timid feel to it. Though she did look as though she was annoyed with him.
'He'll get over it,' came a voice from beside her, Aria turned to find Pansy Parkinson looking in the same direction, Aria had been. 'He's just feeling a bit ... wounded -'
'Hush.' Draco said. 'We've got time to figure this out. We don't need to do - to sort everything right now. But I think it's best you stay with me at the Manor for the rest of the holiday.'
Aria seemed hesitant, and with all the Muggles walking around it wasn't like she could just use magic. She glanced once more time to double-check, but it was apparent Dudley and Emily would not be returning any time soon. Wordlessly Aria handed him the bottle from her bag and turned her back was to him. Draco dried his hands on his towel and sat down on the sunbed. Aria, he noticed was trembling and her fisted-hand gripped at the towel underneath her.
Draco - though he hated to admit it - was currently pacing the length of the fireplace. It was Christmas Eve and he was waiting for Aria to appear through the grate. He knew that they had to work over some issues - like the fact that she changed the subject every time her Muggle relatives came up - and that she still had not forgiven him. Draco had known she wouldn't forgive him quickly, but he had hoped that the other night had proven that he was being truthful with her. Enough so that she wouldn't have to spend Christmas alone ... he just couldn't get that notion out of his head, it completely baffled him, for surely she would want to go to Weasley's if she didn't want to go to her Muggle relatives.
'The sign means exactly what it is meant to mean - do not disturb,' Aria said, as they walked back down the corridor. 'I guess you're just used to having the dorm door locked magically or something. That's what - well the guys in Gryffindor do. When - never mind.'
'Of course,' Aria said, and then she giggled, 'I just hadn't realised that Draco had lost the ability to speak.' she looked at him straight in the eye and added, 'I should kiss you more often if it's the only way to keep you quiet.'
'You owe me nothing!' came Aria's voice from behind them, Draco turned surprised at the sound of her voice, he hadn't even heard the sound of her apparating and held at her wand point was his other cousin Celena, 'But if you really want to repay the debt, could you deal with her -' Draco took in Aria's appearance, she looked frazzled and there was a small graze on her cheek.
His mother's shout sounded worried and she came racing back into his room. 'Aria -' she panted handing over the Daily Prophet. Draco took it without another word and was out the door the second he read the headline: SAVIOUR ADMITTED TO SAINT MUNGO'S.
'I don't live at Privet Drive anymore, Malfoy,' Aria said, 'I've got my own place and luckily most of my stuff is there - including your bloody falcon - I was only at the Dursleys to support Dudley, that was all.'
'Nothing like that, Draco,' Aria rolled her eyes, though he wasn't looking at her. 'I swear, just relax a little, you're too tense.'
'Because she has never cared that Ron and I didn't come from wealth, orchids are expensive to buy,' Granger stated obviously. 'Aria has a generous heart, Malfoy. Do be wise not to break it, you won't last two minutes if you do.'
"They probably felt the defenses would be weakest then, My Lord," Aria replied truthfully, after all it would have been exactly what she would have done.
"The memories have meaning to them. I took a great risk in getting that Pensieve and Dumbledore's memories down here." Aria said. "He told me to be careful with whom I trusted the information with Draco."
Aria was a force like no other. She barely slept, being kept so busy. Running around forming a secret Army. Training Crabbe and Goyle to defend her, well enough so The Dark Lord could be pleased with their progress but also enough that students could defend themselves from Crabbe and Goyle. Aria Potter should have been placed in Slytherin. Draco closed the curtains with a flick of his wand when he noticed her nose started to twitch. The offending sunlight kept at bay. Draco hoped this would allow her to sleep longer.
Aria took her duvet with her as she strolled across the room to open the window, letting the falcon swoop in. She took the letter and stared at the falcon when it made no move to fly back out of the open window. 'Well, get going then.' Aria gestured to the open window to Coeus, but the falcon still made no move to leave. Aria took a deep breath, closed the window, and placed the letter in the bin, along with the others.
'Because it's cold,' Hermione muttered without looking up. Aria shook her head before returning to the book, as Ron groaned.
Aria's trail of thoughts abruptly stopped as she caught sight of one of her best friends in the eighth-year common room; her very unimpressed male best friend.
Potter came out of the house, slamming the door behind her a big black bag held in her hands and a thunderous look upon her face. 'D, are you sure you haven't got the paperwork. I couldn't see it in the kitchen.' she placed the black bag in a black bin, before walking over.
Aria ducked her head turning away, clearly thinking along the same lines ... the last person they both wanted to speak of was Bellatrix Lestrange.
'Aria! Aria!' Draco called out her name, reaching out, the moment he touched her shoulder Potter abruptly woke up. Scrambling herself into a sitting position, she somehow had landed up sitting as though she was in his embrace. Draco spotted her glasses on the bedside table and placed them within her trembling hands.
'Aria, what is it, love?' Draco said helping her to her feet, only then did he notice that she had brought her stuff with her. This puzzled him, Aria was not due to see him until tomorrow. Draco's question it seemed was the wrong one to ask, for Aria blinked, her eyes watering up.
'Ah,' Blaise acknowledged, but he did not add anything more than that, nothing needs to be said. Pansy entered the common room settling herself down into an empty chair, dumping her bag at her feet.
Aria glanced over, a thoughtful expression on her face, Draco looked at Goyle than and Weasley and Granger, he caught Aria's eye, she understood within sheer moments why Goyle had been following them; the life-debt. Aria looked between Weasley and Granger and said nothing ... not one word. The question was, why the hell not?
It didn't matter that he didn't receive any points, he received something better for Aria kissed his cheek swiftly before making off after her friends.
'Oh,' Potter said turning her head to the direction of a house. 'I'll get it, put my bags in would you.' she turned back towards Draco. 'I'll be back in a minute. Just put your bag in the boot.' and went off into the house.
Aria knew her friends could tell something was wrong, with the apprehensive glances Ron and Hermione were sharing. But Aria just didn't want to talk about it. She considered herself lucky that the Professors had obviously been told and therefore she had not been called upon in her morning classes.
"It's the darkest of magic you can perform. That Slughorn was not kidding when he said it takes killing to be able to rip your soul apart. The only thing that can destroy them is something that would have no cure. But Seven pieces it is unheard of. You would need to destroy all of them before you took him on. The Dark Lord will not die otherwise."
Draco turned as his father's stern gaze changed into bewilderment. This was clearly new information to them both Draco and him.
'Well according to the rumours - your relationship, is at an end. Potter wants nothing to do with you, and it's all due to how to treated her in Defence after your cousin ... well yeah .. after certain events -'
"What did he want that was there?" Aria said. "He clearly knew that it was the only way to get hold of me. But I thought the weapon he wanted was at the Ministry. Not me." Aria remembered something Draco had told her. "But his plan changed."
'No, he did not ... but the facts remain the same, and the two of you are who you are ... if seen together - would most likely cause a public outcry.'
Draco glanced towards Dudley and repeated what he had told their aunt. 'We haven't known each other long.'
'I hope you don't think of me as being rude,' Aria said because no doubt her next question might be seen as though she wanted to know his secret, 'But how exactly is a wand made?'
Hermione, gave a puzzled thought for a few moments, 'Isn't she a home-schooled student, here for the dueling tournament.'
The wind had brought a bitter coldness to with them this Halloween. Aria and Draco like many of their fellow students took to staying within Hogwarts walls even if the very halls Hogwarts walls provided were no longer considered safe. Draco stirred the Polyjuice potion. They had begun running low again.
She was going to have an over-extreme wedding that surely was going to make a statement because that is what Malfoy's did best in Aria's opinion, no matter what had happened and who the Malfoy's had aligned themselves with, they walked with confidence and a purpose, everything calculated - just like the Slytherins' that they all were ... cunning indeed.
The flash of light was quick, but so was the shield from the protective charms placed in the bracelet.
'I'll be right out,' Aria called back her voice sounded so unlike her own, much like she had forced the words out as though she hadn't even thought about her reply. Hermione knew better, the door opened a few moments later. She did not utter a single word, did not look at Aria with any disapproval, Hermione merely crossed the bathroom and tugged on one of Aria's arms, with one arm dislodged, the other fell and Aria followed Hermione. Ron was waiting for them downstairs, his face as blank as Arias had been just moments before. Ron glanced at them both once when he took notice of their approach, his step fell easily into place, and the three of them left the safety that the eight-year common room provided. And though Aria couldn't exactly see him, had not seen him, she could sense that Draco was somewhere close by - sometimes Aria wondered how he had come to understand and know her so well, to give her the time and space and her friends the same comfort... but with the day being what it was, it didn't take a genius to figure it out.
Aria looked up at the sudden whispers, it didn't take long to figure out what the whispers around her were about, several of the female students were gazing towards the staff table, it was then Aria took note of who was on the table. McGonagall was in the throne-like chair, Flitwick was missing - Aria presumed he was with the first-years. Hagrid, Slughorn, Sprout joined her at the table along with the other professors and one person she recognised, with silvery-blond hair and pointed features.
'Are you having withdrawal symptoms?' Draco asked, but then he noticed Aria's appearance. Her hair was messier than normal and her face was covered slightly with dirt. 'What have you been doing?'
Aria watched opened mouthed as a form was flown backward across the room, slamming against the wall with a thud. The sound of the thud magnified due to the silence of the classroom. Her feet carried her across the room to the person, her heart was racing and fast-paced breathing.
Aria smirked at him, looking pretty pleased with herself. 'I win, you just called our home The Den.'
'I did not hide.' Aria corrected, 'I went out - just not where the wizarding community could mob me.'
Those had been her words in her letter, is that what she was trying to do? Set a good example by raising above the rumours? By accepting the apologies and acting like it was nothing? Had that been the reason she had agreed to the engagement?
Aria Potter guessed it had been three days since she had fallen into Voldemort's filthy hands. She wasn't exactly sure where she was, because, for the second time in her life, she had been thwarted by a portkey. Once she got out of here, she was going to make sure that portkeys could never be used again. Her magic snapped around her, for all the good it did, bound by dark magic to a chair. Aria calmed herself, exhausting herself or her magic would do her no good, only Voldemort or one of his supporters could release her.
