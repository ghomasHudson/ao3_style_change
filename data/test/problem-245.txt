This time Luna managed to stay standing, her jaw set and her eyes closed, but she didn’t fall. Astoria's distraction by this phenomenon gave Harry enough time to act without her noticing. Praying to whomever was listening that Luna would be alright when the spell broke, Harry cast another body binding curse, this time at the girl. Astoria went stiff as a board as soon as the spell hit her, and she fell back onto the floor with a loud thud. Thanks to his quick reflexes, Harry was able to catch Luna before she fell so that when loud footsteps seemed to be coming down the hall from behind them, Harry was not able to protect them with his wand. No longer caring who saw the extent of his power, Harry erected a strong shield spell around them, waiting for the worst.
“Thank you for your help, Mr. Dumbledore.” Hermione spoke, turning to see that she wasn’t talking to anyone.
“That’s actually a little terrifying.” Harry muttered.
“You two go on ahead.” George nodded to the door. He waited for them to leave before he cast a quick patrons. “Harry, he admitted to stealing the locket and he said he sold it to a wizard named Artikus Burch. I’ve never heard the name and neither has Fred, but I hope this helps.” He let the patronus play the message back before sending it on his way.
"Hey, it's okay, he won't hurt you anymore." Harry walked in, spelling a pot on the stove to make tea before kneeling before her, taking her hands in his. "I promise you that he will leave you alone." He looked up to Draco to to make sure that his lover knew that he was talking to him too. "You okay?"
"Well you see, Ginny gets her temper and her quick hexing skills from her mother." Harry supplied, laughing at the glare set on the girl's face. "So what Ron means is maybe we'll get to see Mrs. Weasley chew Dumbledore out."
Draco was more than lost to the amazing feeling of Harry's lips on his body. As much as he wanted to watch Harry worship his body, his eyes betrayed him, falling shut as his head dropped back and a low moan escaped his lips. He was surprised, but not unhappy when he felt Harry's lips collide with his own. Their hot and frenzied kiss only ended when the need for oxygen was overwhelming. Not missing a beat, Draco spelled the rest of Harry's clothes away, opening the glass door to the shower from behind, stepping back and pulling Harry under the warm water with him.
Watching from her spot a little off to the side, Pansy couldn't help but be in awe. She'd been staying with Blaise and Draco for just over two weeks and in such a short time she had been easily welcomed into the tight knit group before her. For the first time since starting school she felt as if she had finally found a place where she belonged, like she'd finally found her family.
His friends, including Draco, had all been understanding and supportive by giving him space. They could not possibly understand the conflicting feelings that plagued him, keeping him from sleeping at night, and no one dared try. They had all learned that he would come to them when he was ready and he was sure that it was Draco’s quiet support that kept even Ron and Hermione from hounding him to open up.
"I'll go to Dumbledore." That seemed to seal the deal. The man visibly deflated and seemed to give up entirely. He reached into his desk, pulled out a stack of parchment bound together by string, and placed it on the table.
"Professor Snape requires entry."
Severus looked his, familiar with the magic it took to create the Fidelius Charm and he was more than a little impressed that the group had managed it. The parchment simply held coordinates, proclaiming it to be the location of the Core Order Headquarters. Once he had read the parchment twice over to insure he would not forget, it disappeared, true to Hermione’s words. He heard a small gasp from behind and turned to see the same had happened to Narcissa.
"Could you ask Severus? He does have to go back for death eater meetings, doesn't he?" Luna asked.
Just as Harry was about to turn around to go back towards his rooms, he was struck from behind by a strong hex. Pulling himself from his thoughts, Harry pulled out his wand and gripped it tight, turning to face the hooded Slytherin who dared to attack him in the middle of the night. Thinking quickly, Harry fell into an easy dueling stance, striking back with a pretty nasty hex of his own. Because he didn't even need his wand, the use of the tool only made his hex stronger and it threw his attacker back and off their feet. As he did his best to advance on them, another spell flew at him from behind again.
If Harry was one to believe in miracles, he would have sworn one had taken place as he opened his eyes to see the familiar stone walls of Hogwarts. The joy was short-lived as the weight of Dumbledore's crippled body sagged fully into him and Harry was forced to gently lead the man down to the ground. There was a banging noise coming from bellow and Harry was soon confronted with a stricken Snape, the customary black robes billowing about him in a way so familiar it nearly lightened the boy's heart.
The rest of the night passed in much the same way, Severus made his rounds a few more times before sitting down at the desk, mulling over papers while he let Blaise, Draco and Harry take over for the rest of the night. He watched each boy carefully, noting each of their teaching strengths and how each was able to take on their leadership roles without stepping on the others' toes. He was more than a little impressed with the way they carried on and he was glad to see that the students were not as helpless as Voldemort or even his fellow teachers assumed them to be.
"The Transfiguration Monthly. I subscribed over the summer for some light reading." Harry responded, smirking at the dumbfounded looks his mates were giving him.
Hermione was seated comfortably in her favorite chair in the core’s library. It was located in the perfect vantage point to see the door while still being next to large windows allowing natural light in for most of the day to shine on the large tomes that littered the table before her. Amongst the books, there were large stacks of parchment and bottles of ink strewn about with half written ideas on the next possible horcrux. The theories found on them were scrawled in many hands as everyone from the core Order had done their part to help, though they were no closer than they had been when they had first started their research nearly a month prior. For once, things were blessedly quiet, though Hermione knew it wound’t be like this for long. With another sigh, she turned her focus back to the parchment infant of her. They knew that Tom Riddle’s Diary had been one. The ring was the second, that much was obvious, but then came the question of where the others could be.
"I wouldn't miss it for the world." Draco and Harry parted with one last kiss and Harry went back to his own dorm, a big stupid grin plastered on his face.
"Well Harry set up the password and the rooms, It wouldn't do to lock him out." Godric winked cheekily in response and Harry couldn't help but laugh.
"That is very true." The two sat in silence again, though this time it was very comforting. When they cleared their plates, Draco sent them to the sink and spelled them to wash themselves leaving him to focus on Harry again. "Well it's late, or early I suppose, I think I will be able to fall asleep now."
"Well he's taken care of, but you're not going to leave me all alone are you?" Ginny smiled, leaning in closer to Blaise who looked both bewildered and bit like he wasn't quite sure what he was getting himself into.
When he made it to the front door, Hermione stood waiting, his three companions just behind her.
Much to Draco’s immense relief, the odd group of teens had welcomed his mother with open arms and it wasn’t long before Narcissa Malfoy found herself the surrogate mother for most of them who desperately missed their own parents. Severus hadn’t quite become a surrogate father, but the respect the teenagers had for him could not be denied. The history between him and the children ran too deep to be completely ignored, but there wasn’t a single person in the house who held any ill will towards him and that was enough for the potions master. It was with his help that they had begun the complicated process of getting most of them to become unregistered animagus’. Between Severus and Harry, almost half of their group had successfully identified their animal forms and nearly half of those had been successful in their attempts.
"Sev?" Draco stood up instantly and was in his Godfather's arms before anyone else could react. The older man slumped forward as soon as the blond's arms encircled him. Despite his small stature, Draco easily supported the man, doing his best to comfort him while trying to get him to talk about what happened. Harry stood too, turning to the group, his voice very low.
"I think I might be beginning to."
“I know ‘Mione. I know you can’t help yourself especially,” Harry teased. He laughed when she swatted at his arm in protest. He took the opportunity to pull her closer in a half hug before kissing her on the cheek. “It wouldn’t be right if you weren’t eager to learn more about anything.”
"I'm going to have to talk to him if we're going to get anything done, aren't I?" Harry asked. As much as he didn't want to have to deal with the man, he knew that he needed the information and he would have to be mature about the situation.
There was a cold draft in the dungeons and it made Snape's cloak whip around him. It was his turn to patrol and it was nearing midnight. The night had been uneventful, but it was far from over. In all his years being a spy he knew that the cold feeling crawling up his spine could only mean that something bad was going to happen. He took his last round of the hall and nothing seemed out of place, though he kept a trained eye for any sign of movement. There was a noise from around the corner and Snape turned quickly to catch the student before they got away.
“I didn’t know.”

"With pleasure." Blaise nodded taking Harry's words as an order. While the boy himself was never comfortable being seen as their sole leader, and he hardly gave out any orders, Blaise as well as all of the other members of the DA respected him more than the boy could imagine and Blaise was happy to do as he was asked, especially since it would keep his little brother safe.
"Meet me in my dorm after, we need to talk." Draco brushed his hand over Harry's arm as he passed, making the action look accidental, but Harry knew better. He felt much calmer knowing that Draco seemed to understand.
“It’s here,” Harry mouthed to Draco, happy when the blond nodded his understanding. Harry slowly made eye contact with both Pansy and Blaise, hoping that they understood what was about to happen. He drew his wand, raising it up to his own eye level hoping that the three before him understood that he needed them ready at any moment. When he was sure that they understood, Harry turned back down the hall to stand before the door again. Instinctually, his hand went into his pocket and his fingers grazed over the fake gold coin. Taking it from its safe spot, Harry charmed a quick message to Hermione.
"I'm not sure I can do that." Snape cautioned, he figured he would be able to convince the boy to pretend to trust the man, but he wasn't sure if he would be able to fool the wizard with an act.
"The last time I let that happen I had a homicidal maniac trying to kill me."
With Draco's help, Harry was able to stand with Luna in between them so they could support her properly. Carefully they made their way through the dark halls in relative silence. When they reached the large wooden doors, Harry supported all of Luna's weight and Draco pushed open the heavy doors.
"Oh good," Ginny blushed deeply, turning the tables and burying her face into Harry's shoulder.
"Where do you think you're going?" Professor Snape bellowed and his students stopped in their tracks, returning to face their Head of House with pure dread on their faces. "And you, Potter, how is that you're always in the middle of a fight?"

"Ignore him." Draco glared at his best mate, allowing Harry to continue.
"Me, My Lord?" Snape was completely taken aback. He must be in the clear if Voldemort trusted him enough to allow him to take over such an important and powerful road.
“Cut the crap, Mundungus. Where is it?” George took his wand from its holster, spinning it through the fingers on his right hand. “Who did you sell it to?”
"Yeah, but you can have a go at it, maybe I missed something." Harry picked up the offending object gingerly, handing it to the blond. The second Draco's fingers touched the parchment, words formed on the page. Harry gasped in surprise and Ginny and Blaise soon crowded around the blond to have a look. Harry's scribble was still there, but now a clear message could be read that certainly hadn't been there before.
“Mundungus is a thief and leech. He would have peddled the locket by now, so I’m sure we’re going to need to track down whomever he sold it to and then send a group out to confront them for it.”

"You mean Malfoy?" Harry asks, even on his own ears Malfoy sounded strange when talking about the blond he had spent most of the past twenty-four hours with.
"Good, then we can plant someone in that spot when it happens."
"I am not Dumbledore's man." Snape said with such conviction that the whole room fell silent again. "I am trying to talk to Draco, but he doesn't trust me. I was hoping to gain his trust to get closer to Potter and figure out what the boy is up to. I know that they are planning something. The filthy Gryffindors that follow him around have been buzzing with hope and life ever since Potter and his gang started to disappear at night again. I think that they are still meeting like they did last year. I hope to infiltrate the group and take them down. I can only do this if I gain their trust."
"So what do we do now? We can't really run a secret operation in the school without him knowing." Harry said trying to reason with the man. While he knew that it was important to separate from the manipulative man, he wasn't sure how that would be possible.
“We’ll finish this later.” Harry grinned. Draco couldn’t help, but smile back. Sure he loved the quiet moments, but he also wouldn’t trade his new family for the world.
“I would thank you, but I think I might try to rest again now that I’m in less pain.” Narcissa moved to grasp Severus’ hand with one of her own while she combed through Draco’s hair with the other.

as our lovely housemates have named it." Draco rolled his eyes. "Why is she working with Nott? Does she think that since his family is the next most important with a son near her age she can shack up with him? I may have never liked her, but I've always thought better of her than that."
The old Gryffindor Head of House quarters had been cleaned out by the house elves and when Draco and Blaise entered their new dorm there was a fire already lit for them. Because it used to be for a Professor, and their family if they had one, there was a small kitchenette, library, lab, and store room all attached to the common room. Two bedrooms, each with their own bathrooms, were on the second floor, the staircase situated on the far right.
"It's all that prat Malfoy's fault. I don't know why you spoke for him at the trial, but you have to know that he's still bad. Bad blood will always be bad."
“Who better than the man I trust most to be my killer?” Dumbledore spoke as if he were merely discussing the weather for the week. “Yes, I suppose I had known that was his plan all along, but the confirmation-“ He trailed off as if lost in his own thoughts.
“Four? Does that mean you’ve located and destroyed another? What and where is it?”
"I made you coffee, no cream with two sugars." Harry slid the mug in front of him and then put down a plate of food too.
"It's okay, I'm not asking you to, I'm just letting you know that I am here for you when you're ready." The rest of the room had cleared by this point. Neither boy noticed that they where the only ones left or that everyone had signed the paper with no issues. The rest of the world melted away as they held onto each other. As much as Harry would have liked to bury his own insecurities, the ugly words and threats that his Uncle use to yell at him still came up to the forefront of his mind and haunted him. Nights like this night reminded him that he was loved. Normally he would find himself questioning why anyone would love him, but having Draco was starting to change all of that. Harry knew that when he was ready Draco would be there for him to bare his soul and start the much needed healing process. He also knew that Draco wouldn’t push him to speak before then and he was so grateful that he thought he might burst.
"Something was wrong with her broom, she just lost control and fell. It was almost like what happened to you in your first year." Katie looked downright frightened at the dark look that crossed Harry's face, she knew what he was thinking, this could be the work of the student who decorated Ginny's locker.

"What's wrong?" Ginny took the seat on his other side, her hand gently pulling on his arm, massaging the hand that was running through his hair.
Draco eyed him wirily, waiting for him so say something. When Harry motioned for him to sit as well, he took it as a good sign and took a seat. Harry waited until he was comfortable until speaking again.
“Why would someone like that be given access to the Order and to their headquarters?” Pansy asked.
" Throwing up a quick shield, Harry did his best to assess the situation in the few seconds that he had just bought himself. He was pretty sure that he knew who his attackers were, which meant that it had been Nott who he knocked over and the Greengrass girl who had just attacked him from behind.
“Harry’s right, we should take a break for lunch and then regroup.” Luna suggested and the groups broke up from there, their tasks decided upon.
While he waited for Draco to take his shower Harry stayed true to his word and began to make a large breakfast, brewing tea for himself and coffee for Draco. He knew what an addict Draco was, living with him for the past five days taught Harry quickly that a Draco without coffee was not pleasant to deal with. He only hoped that if he made things as easy as they could be the blond wouldn't act out without talking to him first. When Draco did join him Harry could tell that he still wasn't quite with him.
“Because I suspect that these chests are made of the same material and imbued with the same spells.” Dumbledore spoke in the tone he often used when he wanted to sound wise and all knowing, there had been a time when that tone had worked on Harry, but even now he was sure that the old wizard truly believed the words he was speaking.
The silence was telling and Harry watched as the two snakes danced around each other as if they were waiting for the other to strike first. Harry knew that he would have to make one of them crawl into the wall in order to gain entrance in to the next room and he sorely hoped that it would be Jaculus. He weighed his options as he watched them, not sure how he could force a snake into the lock mechanism.
"What do you want, Ron?" Harry's voice was even, but the air in the room started to get warmer and suddenly Ron looked extremely uncomfortable.
"That is a fair point, Miss Weasley." Draco nodded and while he didn't smile, Harry could see the humor in his eyes.
Harry was pretty sure that he would be sent to Azkaban by the end of the year. Maybe sooner, Hermione and Ron really were testing his patience. They were in advanced potions and the two were sitting behind him. Snape had made Draco his partner again, though in light of recent events it was much preferable to having to deal with one of his two best friends. Currently, they were stage whispering about his odd relationship with the blond beside him and while Draco didn't seem to mind, or even hear them, for that matter, Harry really couldn't deal with them anymore. Harry wasn’t surprised by Ron’s behavior, but he was more than a little surprised by Hermione going along with it.
"Honestly, you both need to shut it, I told you I will answer all of your questions tonight." Harry all but hissed at the two gossiping Gryffindors behind him.
"We use his name here-" Dean started to say, but Hermione cut him off.
"I don't even know why you took advanced potions, Weasley, obviously you can't follow it." Blaise smirked as he lay out on the rug in front of the fire.
"I don't know." Snape's tears had slowed considerably when Draco started to cry. It was if his parenting instincts had kicked in and he knew that he would have to put his own grief aside long enough to take care of Draco. "I'm going to try to get her back, Dragon, I promise." Snape said, rocking them back and forth. "I promise."
"Well we're heading up to bed, we made the new rooms for Pans and Luna this morning, so they're all set. Night everyone." Blaise said as he and Ginny went up to bed for the night. Draco and Harry followed their lead, saying goodnight to the girls before making their way to their room.
"Yes, but if you are politician you should care more for your people then your own personal gain, you would have to have some Gryffindor in you for that."
"I grew up with my aunt, uncle, and cousin. It was my mother’s sister. I never knew about this place, this world, wizards, magic, none of it. Magic was a bad word in that house. I was their servant, think of me like a house elf. I cooked for them, cleaned, and did everything I was asked. I never once got my birthday celebrated, I was lucky when they gave me food, and I lived in a cupboard under the stairs.
"That's rubbish and you know it. I literally came out and switched sides in the middle of a bloody war! I'm pretty sure that I'm in the most danger I could be unless I was actually you! I don't want to hear any of this hero shite! That's what it is, it's shite! You're just being selfish and you've once again completely forgot that I'm here to help you. We are all here to help you!" As he was speaking, Draco voice rose until he was yelling at the end. Harry took it silently, understanding that he both deserved it and that it was helping the boy vent. When he was sure that Draco was done, he continued talking, completely changing the topic. He knew that if he was going to have to tell Draco everything, he was going to have to start from the beginning.
Dumbledore set the cup he had been slowly sipping from down delicately and pulled back the sleeve of his robe to show his blackened and dying hand. Sitting on his ring finger was a plain gold ring with a large black stone that had a noticeable crack down the center.
“Who goes there?” The voice from the bar bellowed, far too similar to his deceased brother’s for Severus’ comfort.
"I am
"So its
“This ring was one of the few heirlooms left from a minor pure blood family, the Gaunts. They were once very prominent and important, but poor genes won out and they died off. It is believed that Tom Riddle’s mother was a daughter of the Gaunt line and when she’d married the name died with her. It was proof of his heritage and he would have used it to solidify in his mind that he came from good blood.”
"Alright then. Just call on one of the house elves if you need anything. Mipsy will be your personal elf during your stay."
"What do you think?" Harry asked as he looked over his group despondently. "I don't think we have any chasers in my group.
"Alright I think everyone is here." Harry called for attention when the last few students slipped in. "Today we're going to be running two lessons. For all of the students who have either not been here before, or to those who had trouble with this last year, we are going to have a recap of the simple shield spell. If you feel that you could benefit from this then please stand where the pillows are. Don't feel embarrassed if you think you need help with this spell, while it sounds simple, a well cast shield spell could really save you one day and I want to make sure that everyone here knows how to cast one." Harry waited for the students to move and get situated before he continued with his instructions. "Alright good. Now I know that Professor Williams assigned both the sixth and seventh years to practice the patronus charm. For those of you who need practice, and I'm sure that is most of you, you can move around the barrier to the other side and wait for further instructions.
“Are you going to just stand there or are you coming in?” The croaking voice of an old man called from the open doorway and that seemed to settle the matter for the quartet.
Harry was in no way naive. He knew that Voldemort as well as Dumbledore were keeping close tabs on him. While Dumbledore knew that he was far more powerful than he let on, the fact that the papers hadn't reported it as well as the fact that he didn't have any Death Eaters breathing down his neck showed Harry that at least the old man hadn't sold him out. He wasn't really sure what the wizard was up to, but he wasn't convinced that he was necessarily evil, but rather he was getting old and this war was taking its toll on the man's fragile sanity. That didn't mean that he felt any sympathy towards the man, however. He would never forgive him for the way that he manipulated the Order members, especially when he obviously knew or suspected more than he was willing to share.
“I suppose that makes sense.” Harry conceded. “If you're sure, love, but where does that put us? What do we do from here?" Harry asked sitting back and pulling Draco down to him. He agreed with the others, but he didn't want to upset the blond and he did trust him. However, that didn't mean that he trusted the girl.
"So your temper then. It's a wonder that a young man with emotions so vast as his is suddenly able to reel them in. It makes you wonder if he's alright."
"Thank you Gin, now I hate to do this, but we're going to have to go by raised hands, I want to make sure all of your questions are answered and that everyone hears the answer. I know that this is not what any of you expected, but this is a serious situation that you all need to understand and we just want to help you. We are at the brink of war and having Snape as an ally just might save us in the end, so who knows? Justin, I saw your hand first."
The core sat around the fire of the common room uncharacteristically quiet. Harry was seated in his customary armchair while Draco flanked on on his right side on the armrest. Pansy, a new, but undoubtably permanent fixture, flanked on on the left. Ginny and Blaise were sharing a single spot on the couch while Luna and Neville took on the rest of the seats. Dean and Seamus sat in the armchair across from Harry while Hermione and Ron took a spot on the floor in front of the couch, in the center of them all. They were waiting for him to start, but respecting his need to collect his thoughts.
"I'm sure I'll make it up to you. Come on, we've got work to do."
“I hope so.” Draco cleared his throat, pushing back his emotions and began to read.
"OH MY-" Draco cried, eyes wide, he had to control himself from releasing instantly. "Harry, oh Merlin." Draco continued to babble nonsense while Harry picked up his pace. "Harry if you keep this up-" but Draco didn't finish his sentence. Harry had gone deep enough to lick at his balls. The pleasure that was coursing through his body was enough to send him over the edge. Draco saw stars as he came hard, not having time to warn Harry. Harry was prepared, though and readily drank in all Draco had to offer.
"Yes, Sir." Severus' stern gaze softened ever so slightly and the other students at the table nearly gasped.
There didn’t seem a good reason to argue his point and Harry couldn’t find it in himself to try. “Okay, if you are sure.”
“Harry would you just tell me what—” Draco started, but his mouth flew open when a shimmering cloak emerged from the trunk and he lost sight of his boyfriend entirely. “Blood hell.”
"You're not use to forgiveness and kindness are you?" Even though it was posed as a question, Draco knew he meant it as a statement. "Well you might as well try and get use to it. I might be able to forgive you relatively easily, but the rest of the Order will question your every move until they truly let you in. Are you going to be able to forgive yourself in order for them to forgive you?"
Draco was stunned. Was it possible that Harry really was just that good of a person. He had expected so much more from the raven-haired man when he first came to him for help, but certainly he had not be expecting complete understanding and forgiveness. Harry might have been right to suspect that the grown, mature man before him was no longer the boy that had caused him so much grief as a child, but it was Draco who felt that he truly was speaking to a completely different person.
Harry felt like his whole body was on fire. He was so relaxed from Draco's magical fingers and the feel of the blond's naked body pressed tightly against his side made Harry see stars. In the month that the two had been together, they had really only made out before and while Harry had seen the blond with just a towel on he had never actually been so close to him naked. Draco pulled away from the kiss and started kissing a trail down Harry's neck again, his hands roaming over his sides, snaking up and down his ribs, pinching and playing with each of his erect nipples in the process. Harry moaned loudly, having half the mind to cast a weak silencing spell. He hardly cared if the others heard, but he knew Draco would be embarrassed in the morning if he didn't. His mind was taken away from all thoughts, but the blond when he felt his tongue moving lower. Harry was sure he would cum just at the sight of Draco making his way down his body, stopping just before his painfully erect cock. Draco looked up from his spot kneeling in between Harry's legs as if to ask permission. All words had failed Harry at this point and it was all the Gryffindor could do, but moan approvingly and thrust his hips up in a lame attempt to get Draco to move closer and
It was in this organized chaos that Severus found the teenagers when he walked into the kitchen in search of the heavenly smell and a strong cup of tea.
“Wretch or not, he’s still a being with feelings.” Hermione protested, though she knew that there wasn’t any hope. It was their best chance at finding the real locket and that was more important at this point. “That being said I understand that this is probably the only option. If we do this, I think that Pansy and Draco should be the only ones in the room with Harry because they are less likely to set him off. We know how he feels about us.”
"I thought you said it made no sense to make enemies of people who should be your friends?" Draco questioned, using Harry's own words against him. Draco was leveling him with a scolding look that would have made Mrs. Wesley proud. Instantly Harry felt ashamed and he colored under the boy's harsh gaze.
Harry thought, glaring at Ginny. "Accio John Donne poetry collection." The book flew to Harry's hand and he took to the floor, leaning against the settee allowing himself to be very close to Draco while seeming to not notice him as he began to delve into his book.
"I think I'm going to stay the night, if Blaise and Draco don't mind." Ginny looked to the two boys and they nodded their consent.
“I have already sent word to Hermione,” Pansy whispered, well aware that they were being watched, and most likely listened to.
"That was very insightful and mature." Gryffindor's portrait startled them from his spot above the fireplace. "Sorry to bother, but Professor Snape and Draco are about to return and I figured that this seemed like a conversation of a private nature and that you would want to know."
"How dare you bring her up! What would you know about being a pure-blood? You're a filthy half-blood! I don't know what the Dark Lord sees in you! Why he is so fond of you when you're not even worthy of our company!" Lucius growled back, sticking his finger into Severus' chest making the man back up even further.
Dumbledore replied, still smiling. Madame Pomfrey had moved to Ginny's side to care for her at this point so Harry had no qualms in leaving her in favor of staring down the Headmaster.
The portrait swung open and Harry walked in slowly. He hadn't realized that he had been speaking in parseltongue, otherwise he would have noticed the secondary precaution that the two wizards in the portrait seemed to have set in place. If he had noticed, it would have worried him even further.
"Of course, who else would I root for?" Draco asked and Harry smiled.
She smiled at them kindly, if not a little tired, and Severus found himself nodding in agreement, not quite sure how to respond. She showed them up the stairs and down the hall two doors to the left. Neville had been following behind them, but turned off to a door on the right side with a small wave and muttered, “good night.”
"I just got out of a meeting with the Headmaster. I think it best we speak in private." Snape looked around at all of his students surrounding him, suddenly feeling very uncomfortable.
“Just a moment ago, but Harry seems to have magically locked the door to your rooms. And it is me, I know what you’re thinking, I just came back to pick up my potions book, I left it here last night.” Draco and Hermione took a moment longer to stare at each other before he backed down, accepting that it was in fact her.
"It has been brought to my attention that there is a possibility that one or more students have taken what was meant to be Draco's role as student spy for Voldemort." Snape answered for his shaking Godson, more than surprised with how close he seemed to be with Potter, though he was very glad to see that someone cared for Draco as much as he did, even if it was the brat.
Like a child, Draco crawled from his spot on the couch to the other end and allowed Blaise to envelope him in a warm hug. He couldn’t remember the last time they did this, but he was reminded of simpler times when they had been children and had found comfort with one another when their parents had been particularly harsh and cold. Being only children, it had been easy for them to bond and they’d called each other brother nearly from the first day they had met.
It was only a week into his sixth year at Hogwarts and already Harry felt as if it was dragging. Hermione and Ron were still treating him like he was about to break. While he was still obviously upset about Sirius' death, it was his fault that he had lost his Godfather and nothing they said could convince him otherwise, he desperately needed them to treat him normally. They just didn't to understand. More troubling than the pairs constant hovering was the fact that Ginny seemed to dance between treating him like a good friend one moment and then trying desperately to convince him to give their relationship a go in the next moment. As far as Harry was concerned there never had been any relationship between them; everything was in the girl's overly active imagination.
"I bet you just love to be tied up by me. Just imagine all of the things that I'm going to do to you. Doesn't it just drive you crazy that I'm in control?"
"Is that all you've got?" Pansy taunted again, lunging forward with the ease of a snake that Hermione was caught completely off guard and the minor stinging hex penetrated her hasty shield, causing her to fall back on the cushions with the wind completely knocked out of her. Pansy sauntered over, her face set in a tight smirk. She looked down at the girl with her wand pointed, a triumphant gleam in her eyes. "Do you yield, Granger?"
"I'm sorry Harry." Hermione whispered, as if speaking too loudly would break whatever control Harry had on his anger. She gently kissed her best friend on the cheek in apology before running after her fiance to do her best damage control.
"What?" Pretty much every person in the room asked in unison, save Pansy and Luna, the latter looking very nonplussed and rather as if she had been expecting as much.
"Stay back Potter, I'll curse her again." If Harry hadn't known how old the girl was, he would have sworn that the harsh, cruel tone of her voice made her seem a lot older than a mere fourteen.
"Just make sure he's okay." Harry smiled. Everyone said goodbye to the blond as he headed out the door to track down his moody godfather.
“Yes, and good thing I was with Harry, they’ve had quite a night and even his magic has it’s limits.”
"Don't be silly, I forgot I had the bottle, I couldn't think of a better meal to pair it with." Harry smiled warmly, thanking the gods or the powers that be that allowed him to find his voice again in time to respond quickly without leaving the poor man to wait anxiously.
"I had to thank you somehow." Draco smiled, brushing the compliment aside as the tingling sensation in his belly started again, it seemed to be doing that every time Harry complimented him, smiled, or even blushed, and Draco found it rather unsettling, but comforting at the same time.
It didn't take Draco long to unpack. He hardly had anything to his name since the end of the war. His apartment had been modestly furnished at best. He didn't make much as a clerk and he had very few personal belongings beyond his family heirlooms. Those were all locked away at Gringotts, both for safe keeping and because Draco was lacking in the family pride department ever since his father's embarrassing arrest shortly after Voldemort's fall. He wondered what his old man would think of his only son running to Harry Potter for help. The thought made Draco snort in an undignified manner and actually made him laugh a little. He had been freed of all charges after the war, mostly due to Harry speaking on his behalf in front of the Wizengamot, but that didn’t stop society from doubting him and his mother. Draco would like to have thought that it was only his father's bad name that had brought aurors to his apartment, banging down his door and demanding that he leave while they conducted their search, but he knew that he had also made some very questionable decisions during the war and he would just have to live with that.
"What exactly did you lie about?" Snape asked, fearing the worst of the boy.
"The room is all set." Harry said quietly as if he has just realized that it was only the two of them in the house. Suddenly a blush came to his face and Draco found that he liked the flush look on the man's face, especially knowing that he was the one to cause it.

“You lot are clearly English, is that old fool Dippet still Headmaster at Hogwarts?” Draco shot a strange look at Blaise, but quickly hid it.
"Unfortunately." The man confirmed, his expression grim. He motioned for the three to follow him and they did so without question. The walk back to their rooms was quiet and Harry had enough time to think over their situation properly. After watching Luna's bravery and her ability to fight off the cruciatus curse Harry knew that she would be his first choice to be the secret keeper for the new safe house. With that in mind, he would have to remember to ask Severus to set up that meeting with Bill as soon as possible.
“I told Draco that, but you know how he is.” She spoke, but if she thought she was fooling Harry then she was and idiot. She might be the newest to their close knit group, but she had carved out a spot for herself and made herself comfortable. She had worried just as much as the rest and her waiting outside the safety of their common room was proof.
“Well, there’s no reason to waste a good opportunity.” Harry agreed which Draco nodded along with enthusiastically. They made their goodnights quick so they could run to their room, matching grins stretched across their faces.
"I could never forget you, love." Harry laughed, kissing her forehead before continuing. Blaise instantly felt jealous at the ease that existed between the two. He was about to say something, but held his tongue. He knew that Harry and Ginny were not an item, it was obvious that Harry was interested in Draco and Ginny seemed to like him, he knew that the two of them were more like he and Draco, but it was hard to push the feeling of jealousy away.
"That may be so, but I thought that everyone could change." Draco replied back cheekily.
“Get out!” Harry urged as he surged forward, narrowly dodging the old man’s arm as he flung it out, as if to curse him, but it was obvious that he was already flagging and wouldn’t have much more energy soon.
"Thank you." Draco could see why Harry trusted the red-head so much. She was strong, someone who most likely learned to hold her own because of her six brothers, and she was smart. He knew then that he wanted to get to know her better and that she would be someone smart to keep close.
“What are you sorry for?” Draco whispered and he could feel more then hear Harry’s unsteady breathing. “You don’t have to be sorry about anything.”
"Tell that to her."
“Goodnight, Sir.”
"So does that mean you're going to be heading to bed early?" Dean questioned. All of Harry's friend looked to him for his response.
"That girl really was always an airhead." Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry took a step back, blocking out his surroundings and began to think about his happiest memories. He knew that he would need to think of more than one to achieve the outcome he was aiming for. He thought of how it felt to sit amongst the Weasleys and truly feel like a member of a family. Memories of him, Ron, and Hermione laughing as they shared sweets while sitting by the lake at the end of every school year. He thought of the moment that he had thought that he would move in with Sirius and never have to go back to the Dursleys. He thought of Draco, everything about him, even their past and how overcoming that made him so happy with their present and their future. There were so many memories to choose from and not much time, so Harry did his best to put all of the love he had ever felt into the spell.
“Well you can’t go alone, even if you take Severus it would be too dangerous.” Draco countered, not in the least bit amused by his boyfriend’s sheer stubbornness.
"Well not exactly. It's an empty plot of land." Luna said cheerfully and everyone, but Harry looked at her as if she had just grown another head. "Trust me I thought Harry was crazy too, but he said that we're going to build the house ourselves!" This time everyone looked at Harry as if he was going crazy.
"No, actually she is under the impression that you lied about being gay and are actually dating Ginny."
"So you're sending
Harry nodded and went up to the second level of their private living quarters to the washroom connected to Draco's room. He had used it many times before as he had a habit of falling asleep on the couch during long study sessions with both or either boy and various Gryffindors from their year who shared classes with them. When he entered the sizable room he was happy to find his spare toiletries right where he had left them as well as the spare set of clothes that he made sure that Dobby kept clean and stocked in the cupboard. If Harry hadn't known better he would say that it looked as if he as lived in the chambers, or was at least dating one of the men who did. Maybe this was what Blaise was getting at, the boy wondered as he stripped down and stepped into the hot water that he had spelled from the tap.
"They are literally a part of a person's soul."
.” Harry hissed, punctuating his words with a few more hard thrusts. It was enough to cause Draco to find his release and Harry followed moments later.
The following morning found the group gathered in the front entrance of the house. Harry, Draco, Blaise, and Pansy had all agreed to wear simple black robes with nondescript black cloaks. Besides any obvious physical features, they took care to remove or hide anything on their person that might give their identity away. Seamus had suggested that Draco and and Harry wear glamours as they were the two most likely to be recognized, but Ginny had pointed out that whatever spells Artikus had cast around his home would certainly destroy the glamours and it would not be a good first impression for the group to make. Instead, the girls had helped Harry apply concealer to his forehead to hide the scar.
"Thank you." Feeling more comfortable than before, Pansy shifted, so she was sitting a little closer to the others and Hermione, on her other side, stopped what she was saying to Ron and turned to smile at her.
, I wouldn't rely on breaking into my mind for information." The smirk on his face was worthy of a Slytherin and Snape's gaze narrowed.
“You forget that he is a powerful wizard, Harry. He would have gone back and worked all kinds of magic to cloak it from those who did not know it was there.” The old wizard spoke in the same tone he’d used on Harry countless times and just as it had before, it grated on the boy’s nerves.
Severus saw the green light as it hurtled towards them before the loud bang of their departure rang through the room. Not a soul within the Manor would have been able to escape the Dark Lord’s wrath that night.
"Of course, My Lord, whatever it is that you believe must be so."
“No, but I think I know where it is.” All eyes abruptly flew to him. “There is something in Bellatrix’s vaults. She’d been bragging about being given the honor of holding something for the Dark Lord, and I’m fairly certain it’s a horcrux.”
"Hey that's alright, I understand. The first time I did this, I had the hardest time thinking up of my happiest moment. At first I thought it might have been the day that Hagrid came to get me and told me I was a wizard. It took a few tries, but I finally landed on my first broom ride."
The group of four rushed through the front door, nearly causing each other to fall in their haste, as they emerged from the small hut, the Dark Mark looming above them. In the distance, Harry could hear the popping sounds of arriving Death Eaters.
"Ah, was that due to your temper, his, or a bit of both?" Albus' cheerful smile was back and it made Severus want to scream.
"And what might that be?" Voldemort stepped over the trembling man on the floor without a care, kicking him in the side in the process, and glided over to the death eater who had just spoken.
"Let's just hope it doesn't come down to that." Severus whispered and a dead silence fell over them as Severus looked over the children in front of him. For all of their hard work, all of their bravery, they were just children and it was his job to protect them. He only wished that he would be able to so and keep himself alive to the end.
"Well he was my Godfather, so I used to spend time over the summer with him, especially when I was younger and he was home from Hogwarts. Most of the time he would order out food because he didn't have a house elf, but sometimes he would forget and be forced to cook. It was awful, I was always convinced he used actual potions ingredients and not food."
than us." Ron sneered, no longer willing to put up with Harry and his excuses. Harry had to admit, if only to himself, that the words stung even if they were true.
"Yeah, nothing to worry about." But Draco was worried. He wasn't an idiot, he knew he was developing some level of feelings for the brave Gryffindor and that was what was scaring him.
"These are really good, how did you learn to cook?" Harry asked and Draco ignored the very obvious subject change.
“As long as you tell him that he is never to mention, hint at, or suggest to anyone including all Death Eaters, Voldemort, or any pureblood who has questionable alliances that he spoke to you, he will not be able to lead anyone back to us. You will also need to tell him that he is never to return to this location even should you call upon him because if he does he will be forced to kill himself.” Pansy spoke in a mater-of-fact tone that would have caused Harry worry had he not known her so well. She spoke about the death of a house elf as if it meant nothing, but Harry knew that she felt remorse by the small look of discomfort in her eyes. She hid it well, like any good pureblood Slytherin would, but she didn’t like the situation anymore than he did.
"Hey, I'm okay too, you know." Ginny joked from beside them and the boys pulled away, both blushing at her comment.
"Oy, Mate! Are you trying to kill us?" Seamus complained from somewhere in the back of the pack. Harry ignored him and forged on, keeping an even pace while making sure to watch the rest of his team for stragglers.
"Well anyways, would you like to join in?" Harry instantly felt the air in the room relax when Hermione left.
"Thank you." Harry knew it was best to agree with him. The young aristocrat hadn't asserted himself in such a way to Harry in a civil situation before, but he knew that despite their friendship, Draco would expect him to listen. Normally Harry would fight the boy a bit more, but he knew he was right.
Harry opened his mouth to ask what he meant by his comment, but was stopped when the man’s wand shot up to the ceiling as he bellowed a curse that Harry had last heard while hiding behind the tents in the Quidditch World Cup camp ground. The sickly gray smoke that billowed from his wand took the form of a snake and skull and panic set in as Harry locked eyes with Draco.
"I don't know, you seem a bit overdressed for me." Harry smirked, his eyes alight with lust and appreciation as Draco slowly began to kneel on the bed, taking off his night shirt and pants with the utmost care. "Well if you're going to be that slow about it, I just might go to sleep."
"I'm not your responsibility." Draco smiled, unlike Blaise he wasn't angry.
"That's where it gets troubling. I'm pretty sure they're working for He Who Must Not Be Named."
"Hey sorry I took so long." Harry said, startling the pair. Ginny was leaning close to Blaise and the boy blushed deeply at being interrupted.
“That’s not helping.” Narcissa shook her head, but there was small smile on her lips as she reached out to grasp Severus’ hand in her own. “I understand everyone’s concern, but I know the spot that Severus speaks of, it won’t be hard to get in or out of, it’s just a bar that is frequented by death eaters, it’s not run by them and thus doesn’t have much to speak of for security. The two could be in and out in with no issue and then we will have the really difficult mission ahead.”
Severus’s thoughts returned to the woman in his arms as he realized that she had began to lightly doze while still upright. With careful movements, he helped remove the borrowed cloak from Aberforth from her shoulders before helping her out of the dirty rags which had once been fine robes. Her dress underneath was no better and he undid the buttons on her spine with ease. Narcissa had woken up enough to realize what he was doing and had helped to remove her arms from the sleeves before slumping against him. Ever a lady of propriety, Severus found a modest slip beneath the dress and felt that she was undressed enough for bed. With soft words and his hands on her shoulder and back, he guided her to the bed, pulling back the heavy covers to assist her beneath them. The bed looked infinitely more comfortable than the lounge, but he still wasn’t sure of Narcissa’s mental state and didn’t want her to be afraid to find him in her bed, or perhaps worse, disgusted to see him there come morning. As he stepped away, however, her pale hands wrapped around his wrists, pulling him back to her side.
"It's not a bother at all. Oh and just leave those for the house elves, they're always complaining that I don't leave enough work for the three of them." Harry smile kindly, standing almost awkwardly in his own home. Would it be crossing a line to reach out to the blond? He wanted to so badly, just to hug him or even kiss him. "Well, good night."
"Is that so? Well he better really be keeping his eye out. I fear we are in more danger than preciously assumed." Severus sneered.
"I was hoping that we could also talk about something else I've found troubling." Snape seemed intrigued and he sat back, taking up his cuppa while watching the boy carefully. “I’ve been beginning to think that things here at Hogwarts will only get worse. I think we’re relatively safe now, but it's obvious that Dumbledore is slowly losing his grip on reality and before long the board will try to remove him again."
"We cannot currently bring anyone in and we have decided no to alert the Ministry, but of course we will being continuing an investigation and Professor McGonagall and I feel that it would be best that Miss Wesley and Draco stay together since you are essentially providing protection detail for him already you can watch her as well. I will report to Potter if I discover anything, I expect you to report back to me."
“I understand, I keep telling myself that I should be grateful that she is alive, and doing better than we could have hoped. I’m still feeling pretty selfish wishing she was okay, though.”
“Good idea.” Harry smiled and kissed Draco soundly until all other thoughts left the boy’s mind.
"Good."
"Well if I worry you that must be saying something." Harry joked back, his face turning serious. For the next few minutes the two kept silent as he continued to create the powerful charm. When it got to the part where he needed Luna, he beckoned her forward, letting his magic and the spell envelope her completely. When the spell was done Luna had the brightest smile on her face that Harry had ever seen.
Harry looked away from Dumbledore to the closed chest. With a gentle tap of his wand, the chest opened and a small silver key sat waiting for him. The wall ahead opened much as the others had and revealed another hallway. “I’ll be right back, Sir.”
"I did not wake up at six in the bloody morning for you to be cryptic old man, don't play games with me."
“That would great, Nev, if you don’t mind. I’m famished.” Draco answered and stood, looking to his mother. “That’s okay with you, right Mum?”
The rain seemed to lessen, the closer they got to the small hut, and as soon as they appeared at the small gate, it was as if the property itself was untouched. The dark magic that radiated from the building was stifling and it seemed that Harry’s three companions could also feel the magic, as it wafted around them, curling in their nostrils like smoke. The front door opened without aid of a person, at least not one that they could see and the group stopped, looking at one another as if to ask what the next move would be.
"Well I don't know, I'd given him my uniform and turned to give him privacy. Which is weird because I wouldn't have done that around Ron or any of my other mates, but it was just different. And so when I turned around, I dunno he just looked
"How did you lie?" Hermione whispered to Harry so only the four could hear them.
"I'm surprised that the Headmaster has time to come visit a student who got in a simple accident."
The halls were empty since most of the students were in classes with an exception to the sixth years. A majority of their year would be in the library as exams were close with end of term so near and Harry was mildly surprised that Hermione hadn’t been orchestrating a very elaborate study plan for the group already. Draco held his hand loosely in his own while he gently guided them through the castle. They passed portraits who bid them good afternoon and even one of the castle ghosts was out, with whom they’d nodded to without stopping. Otherwise they stayed in a pleasant silence. Harry was just going to ask where Draco was taking him when they rounded a corner to a set of stairs that only lead to one section of the castle. Draco took them to the empty wall and walked past it three times. When a small, nondescript door appeared, Harry smiled, allowing his lover to take his hand and lead him in.
." Snape got in Harry's face, staring down at the boy. While Harry was smaller in stature, he stood his ground and stared right back. He felt the man try to probe at his mind again, but Harry's defenses were strong and he barely twitched at the intrusion. Snape put more of his own magic into the spell, and Harry's barriers began to shake. He almost felt the need to dip into the magic he didn't want anyone, but Draco, to know he had access to, but luckily the man stopped, backing off with an odd look on his face. "Get out."
"I was a student once, too." Snape's smirk was answer enough and every person in the room suddenly had more respect for the man. "Keep them safe, Potter. I'm sure you'll be hearing from me soon." Snape took his leave then, presumably to try and get a lead on the person who threatened Ginny.
Harry had no idea how to respond to the words and he simply nodded. Dumbledore appeared to have accepted the fact that his life was at its end. If his hand was anything to go by he was already dying, it was possible that Snape’s mission would simply hasten the inevitable. Harry did not like the man, but he also had a heart. He knew he would mourn the man’s loss, but the sting would fade. They were at war, one that Dumbledore had become far too comfortable puppeteering, and Harry knew that the old man had long since overstepped his bounds.
Harry waited for the rest of the students to clear out and for his friends to take their seats. Twenty-three students remained, sitting around him waiting for him to start. No one knew what this was about and many had the feeling that it certainly wasn't anything good if the look that was set on Harry's face was anything to go by.
“I don’t like it.” Draco said again and no one disputed that.
"So you set a raid on his apartment." It wasn’t a question. Harry didn't need to draw his wand to force Ron back and into one of the chairs. Ropes sprung up from the ground and trapped him in his place. "You invaded an innocent man's home to try and destroy his life and why? Because a childish grudge? Didn't you learn anything from the war? Molly will be furious with you she finds out! And what did you accomplish in the end?"
"Good." Nevertheless, Harry tightened his grip around her waist. "Do you have any idea who might have done this or what it is suppose to mean?"
Bellatrix was easy to spot. Between her wild hair and the fact that she was the only woman present, she stuck out from her spot in the middle of the crowd. Her eyes were wide and glossed over, though if that was due to the mostly empty bottle of firewhisky in her hand or due to her own brand of crazy, Harry wasn’t sure. Rodolphus was just as easy to spot, though he was nowhere near his wife and had instead taken up residence at the bar with his brother and was at least drinking out of a glass instead of the bottle.
“I’m very glad to hear that. Will Blaise be joining us soon, or have you tired him out?”
“Very true. Now that you mention it, I know you said no talk of the Junior Order, but I was thinking, since Christmas is coming up, it might be nice to have a party with the DA before we all separate for break.” It had been something he had thought of in passing and had mentioned to Hermione. She had also agreed that it would be fun, but with how busy they had been he’d completely forgotten.
With little time to think it over more, Severus found himself in a large field, looking across to a grand house.
Draco didn't question the boy and simply nodded. Together the two made their way back to their room. Luckily they avoided all other people the whole way and soon Draco was laying Harry down gently in their bed.
“Mum, how are you feeling?” Draco asked as he moved to kneel by his mother’s side. “And don’t lie to me, we can’t help you if you don’t tell us how much pain you’re in.”
"Honestly I have no idea. I keep to myself in most of my classes and Luna is really my only close friend in my year. Other than that I spend all of my time with you or other Gryffindors in your year. I can't imagine who I've pissed off, honest."
"You were going to tell me about what you're hiding." Blaise ground his teeth, annoyed and Harry and Ginny had to do their best to keep from laughing.
"Draco and Blaise Zabini have agreed to move into the old Gryffindor Head’s quarters, they should be doing so now." Harry continued to keep the blank look on his face. Harry would not give away his thoughts to either men, not sure if he could truly trust them especially after the past two years with Dumbledore holding more and more back from him. He felt a push at his mental wall and looked lazily toward Snape daring him to push harder. Snape looked annoyed as he tried to push further, surprised when he felt resistance. Harry was easily keeping his mind closed and no matter how hard Snape tried he could not use legilimency to gain access to the boys thoughts. "I've learned a few new tricks,
"So what did Dumbledore want?" Dean asked and all eyes fell on Harry again. Oftentimes the boy found it unnerving just how much his friends supported and trusted him.
"What?" Minerva was clearly outraged and Severus was glad he was not the only one not able to hold their temper.
"It's comforting to know that not all of Potter's friends are as daft as your brother." Draco said and to an outsider it might have sounded snide, but Harry could tell that he was only joking, he just hoped that Ginny could see the same thing.
"Hey." Draco smiled as he came to sit next to Harry, instantly cuddling into the boy. "We're making really good progress, I was honestly a bit doubtful when you said you wanted us to build a house, but I think we're doing pretty well." Instead of responding, Harry simply smiled, leaning in to kiss the boy gently.
"Has he?" Draco inquired amused that Harry had known what he had been thinking. "I wonder if he's gotten better at legilimency." Kreacher made a noise that sounded like an affirmation, but because he had been given orders by his master he knew better than to actually disobey him. "He wouldn't use it though, Harry's too noble for that."
“Severus!” Draco leapt from his seat next to Pansy, jostling the girl who grumbled and fell into the cushioned seat of the bench bellow her, not bothering to move further expect to glare in Draco’s general direction.
Draco couldn’t think of much to say in response so he just pulled Ginny closer and nestled deeper into the comfortable couch. Blaise and Harry joined them before long and the four settled into a companionable silence. Ginny left Draco’s side to join Blaise in the kitchen and Harry took up her vacated spot.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Merlin Draco, stop teasing." Harry whined pushing lamely at the blond. “I want your cock in me, now.”
“Are you sure?” Pansy asked. It was meant to be a whisper, but with the wind howling as loud as it was, she might as well have been screaming.
" The deranged woman cried, her wand aimed at her sister. Narcissa's cries rang through her home, though unlike before they where no longer sobs of pain, but the wails of a mad woman. All those present where forced to watch and Voldemort's red eyes swept through the room to see if anyone would dare look away. Farthest from him stood a man in full robes with his mask on proper, but nothing could hide his silver hair from view. Lucius Malfoy stood helpless as his wife was once again brutally tortured before him. The sight became too much and he succumbed, looking away as he always did.
. It was a word that Severus never trusted, not once in his life had he every felt safe. There might have been a time with Lily, but just like his love for her it had been built in lies and false pretenses. He had learned quickly never to trust and never to let his guard down.
"No I think I'm actually going to visit the library. I saw a book in there yesterday that I found intriguing." Draco's nonchalant mask seemed to fall away and Harry knew that spending time with Hermione and Ron made Malfoy feel uncomfortable.
"Yes well, she might be a bit flighty, but I know for a fact that she was the one who set up all the traps for Ginny. It seems that dear old Daphne has been telling her stories about our first and second years, so I suppose that's why she was trying to mimic them, maybe to make you think that it was an older student. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that we have a bigger problem on our hands."
,” Artikus spat, glaring at her, “it’s the whole damn world.” To her credit, Pansy didn’t even flinch from his criticism. Harry was rather proud of her, even with the strong hold he had on his own emotions, he wasn’t sure that he could have looked as unaffected as she did.
Slowly the room began to empty out until only Ginny, Harry, Blaise and Draco remained. It was nearing midnight and Harry was more than eager to return to the dorms and go to bed, but the look Ginny was throwing him made him hold back. He hadn't been able to get out of talking to Ron and Hermione and something told him he would also have to talk to the youngest Weasley as well.
"Most suitable? This is the worst room in the house! Hell sticking him up in the sealed room next to mine would even be better! Ron couldn't you put aside whatever grudge it is you have against Malfoy just this once? The bloke really needed a room and he actually came to me for help so you give him the worst room in the house?" Harry's voice was low and the pure anger in it was enough to make even brave Hermione falter. Anger flickered in Harry's eyes and neither had seen the young man look that mad since the war.
“Did Harry ever tell you about what was happening to him last year? The real reason why we went into the Department of Mysteries and why he thought that Sirius was in danger?” When Draco shook his head, Ginny sighed. “It’s not really up to us to tell you, it’s Harry’s story, but what it boils down to is that Harry’s dreams are not always dreams.”
"I am right here, Weasley." Draco drawled without looking back so only Harry could see the smirk on his face which was for the best. If Ron had seen it he would have been livid.
“Are we still safe here?” Draco asked the fear that had been eating at Harry for weeks.
"Now that's not true." Hermione said, shooting the Irishman a look.
"I don't know what to tell you Harry. I didn't know either until just now. Ginny just told me. Ron and his team were done with the search and he was telling Ginny how upset he was that he hadn't found anything. He even said he might plant something just to put Draco away."
"It's okay, Bill. We're in a bit of a rush, if you don't mind. I don't need any tea anyways." Harry reassured, smiling at the affronted look that Bill gave him. He really was Mrs. Weasley's son.
Draco thought that he was going to come right there. He had never seen anything hotter in his life. Without thinking, Draco began to strip off his clothing, leaving them in a pile next to him. He stood only in his boxers as he leaned against the door frame for support. Without hesitation, he pulled his own member from his boxers, stroking himself at the same rhythm as Harry, his eyes glued to the gorgeous man before him.
“Well that could have gone better, I’m sure,” Hermione said, her arms crossed and her brow raised.
“The leprechaun gold? No, we’re well past that.” Fred laughed, taking his other arm and leading him with his twin to the back room. They waved to Tom in unison and waltzed into the back room of the bar, kicking the door closed together before hauling the thief into the nearest chair.
Harry was just finishing ladling fresh homemade potato onion soup in bread bowls when the duo joined him. Wordlessly they helped him get spoons and a pot of tea, though Harry noticed that they interacted with ease as if they had done this before. He would have to ask Draco later what they had talked about in his absence, but whatever it had been it seemed to bring the two closer together.

"Never." Ginny bit back, jumping up in an impressive acrobatic feat, landing perfectly and in a dueling stance.
“So the other items will be from his family? If they weren’t prominent then how many artifacts will they have?” Harry was truly interested then. Loath as he was to admit it, this was information that could win them the war and there was no one else he could get it from.
"What Master Potter doesn't hear-" Kreacher trailed off, leaving the room for the basement. Draco sat alone in the kitchen mulling over his thoughts. Ever since the end of the war he had mostly just gone through the motions of everyday life. He worked as a clerk at Ollivander's, many people didn't trust the Malfoy name and Draco was just glad that he was even able to get a job. Other than that he didn't have a social life, his only close friend was Blaise Zabini and he had been out of town a lot recently to deal with his family's business in Italy so Draco didn't really get out much. He had been bored with life, but moving in with Harry, even if it was just temporary, brought a sense of excitement and adventure back into his life that Draco had sorely missed.
"Night." Draco said as he watched Harry leave, a slightly troubled look on the man's face. If Draco didn't know better he would have thought that Harry has actually been coming closer to him before that looked crossed his face. Draco pushed the thought aside and continued to sit staring at the dying candlelight, mulling over his own feelings.
“I really don’t know what you’re talking about!”
“Detention, Potter, and a word after class.” The rest of the room fell into an uneasy silence. Those who believed that Snape was still a greasy bat looked toward Harry with sympathetic eyes. Those who knew better looked on the boy just as worried, but for their own reasons.
"No fun." Harry jokingly replied, his drooping eyelids telling another story entirely. Draco just rolled his eyes, vowing that he would only rest a few minutes before getting up. He was serious about wanting to get his things. He couldn't wait to move in properly, the idea that Harry was not only willing to give their growing relationship a chance, but also that he was willing to let the boy into his home to live with him permanently made Draco's heart swell and the selfish part of him wanted to move in right away to claim what he felt should have always been his. For once in his life, Draco was happy and he didn't want to chance losing it. Closing his eyes, Draco felt sleep pulling at him and he couldn't find the energy to fight it. Beside him he could hear Harry's light snores.
The din in the Room of Requirement would have been enough to wake the castle had Harry not requested a fully soundproofed room. It was only five past ten, but the entire DA had already arrived and most were none too happy about having two Slytherins in their ranks. Harry was so relieved to have Ron and Hermione at his side again. Things might not have been all patched up, but they were at least willing to stand by him and he desperately needed that at the moment. Draco and Blaise stood to his right and Hermione and Ron to his left, Harry had a strange feeling of being flanked by body guards and he watched his fellow classmates continue to bicker amongst each other while occasionally stopping to glare at him. Harry wondered if he actually needed the protection.
"Word is that you have a secret organization already."
"They are hiding something and I will find out what!" Albus bellowed, grasping his wand faster than Mrs. Weasley could stop him.
"Our plan for infiltrating the school is going well." Voldemort nearly hissed and most of the people in the room shrank back even more. "Your son is doing better than I would have thought." Voldemort trained his eyes on Nott Sr. who bowed low before his master before stepping back into line. "But he is not alone, your daughter is doing equally well, I've heard that she is even running the plan, how delightful. I'm sure you and your wife are so proud."
“Soon, it’s half past.”
Harry couldn't help but smirk at the commentary. He knew his team would put on quite the show and he wasn't worried about finding the snitch before the other seeker. He hadn't been kidding when he had told Draco that the blond was his only real competition out of the three opposing seekers and he knew that he would be able to fly circles around the new guy. With that in mind, Harry took off higher into the sky. He wouldn’t be able to keep an eye on his teammates up there, but the faster he caught the snitch the faster they'd be back in the Gryffindor Tower where it would be undoubtably safer.
"I would love some more of that.” Harry answered honestly. When Draco gave him an appraising look he chuckled and sigh. “Well we can go back to your flat and claim your things if you want." Harry suggested, rubbing circles on his lovers bareback, his smile growing wider at the small moans falling from Draco's lips. "Or we could spend the whole day in bed." Harry tried a second time, his grin turning lewd.
As far as Harry was concerned, Professor Williams seemed competent in defense and he seemed like a natural teacher, but he couldn’t shake the fact that something was off about the man. It could just be that there was always something off about every defense professor since Harry started Hogwarts but this one in particular seemed odd. Harry had only known him for just a month, but he could confidently say that something wasn't right.
" The female assailant cried, surprising Harry enough to make his shield weaken. If Pansy was right, then it was a fourteen year old who had just sent that spell at him, a feat that was very scary when considering the fact that she was much too young to have so much anger and hatred.
“Okay children, enough it’s too early for fighting.” Hermione announced herself with Ron in toe. Choruses of ‘good morning’ and ‘do you expect anything else from those two?’ being called out from around the room. It wasn’t long before Seamus and Dean entered the fray and soon the kitchen was filled to the brim with every member of the core.
Harry sidestepped another attack from the snake, watching his sister closely as she seemed hesitant to react.
It seemed that he might have been a professor of sorts and he brought them fully into his sitting room, conjuring chairs with a lazy wave of his wand. The wards alone were proof that the disheveled man before them was stronger than he appeared, but that small feat of magic made Harry tense. This man was not one to trifle with.
"Not now, we've spent too much time here and walls have ears." Draco glared into the empty hall before starting in the direction of their Head of House's office.
"Just like I've always had you." Salazar nodded, kissing the man soundly. "Come, we should wait for them to return." They left the frame together, moving into the the portrait in the hallway, waiting for the boys.
"Nothing, Nott decided to show off a bit of fancy wand work." Blaise interjected, not sure why Harry was sticking around. He was grateful that Potter had helped, but he wasn’t sure how to react to his open kindness toward Draco.
"Actually we're all here for Ginny, Sir." Neville responded rather boldly which made Snape raise his brow at the boy.
“Okay,” Draco agreed. “But I don’t have to like it.”
"You really do care about him, don't you?" Blaise sounded surprised as they reached the portrait to his rooms. Harry waited for Blaise to let them in before responding.
"What in Merlin's name did you do with my best mate?" Ron shook his head, turning back to the work he had laid out in front of him.
“If you don’t do something soon I swear I- ah!” Draco started his tirade, but was abruptly stopped when Harry’s tongue found his entrance. “Fuck, Harry!”
“The sixth one is Nagini, I’ve noticed that she felt different in recent months. I can’t be certain who he killed to create it, but I am certain it’s the snake.” Severus offered up the little bit of information he had on the topic.
“You, Harry. You will need to work from here on alone, I’m afraid. This is likely to be the end of the road for me.”
"Did your patronus change when you became an animagus?" Draco waited with bated breath. He could see the calculating look in those green eyes. Harry had come to the same conclusion that he had, only he must have realized it hours before when Draco had first produced his own patronus.
"Good night, Malfoy." Harry called back, spelling the kitchen back into order before also heading up the stairs to his own room.
"I found Nott wondering the halls late last night. He said that there had been a meeting and that it was bad that I wasn't invited." The sneer was gone from his face and for the first time in a long time Draco saw the worry clearly written on the man's face. The expression made him squirm and the his stomach suddenly twist with anxiety.
“WHAT!” The roar of his dark master brought Severus’ attention back to the severity of the moment at hand.
Harry had heard enough, his family was in extreme and immediate danger. With a quick glance towards the door he confirmed that Severus had just made his escape back out into the cold. He wasted no time in moving through the bar and back out into the street. If he strained his hearing he could just hear the pop of Severus’ disapparating and he followed suite, taking his time to pop between seven different undisclosed locations before Harry found himself staring at his home, still invisible. He could see the ripple in the wards he knew that Severus had returned seconds before him. Harry made quick work of all the complicated spell he had cast to hide himself, his wards were strong enough that they wouldn’t have even let him in under so much concealment magic and then he nearly sprinted for the house. They had a very big problem on their hands and there was absolutely no time to waste.

"Good. That will be all for the night, gentleman. Oh and Lucius, if Severus is not able to gather enough information and it is because of your traitorous son, you will be sure to pay in full." The look that Voldemort shot Lucius was cold enough that Severus actually felt genuine fear for the shell of a man standing before him, though he felt absolutely no sympathy. Lucius was a disgusting excuse for a human being and no doubt wanted his son dead now more than ever.
“He told you that it was up to you to do it.” Harry said without clarifying. Severus knew that the boy was hoping that his vision was a lie.
"Yes, ma'am." Nott answered, rolling his eyes. He would just have to put up with this chit and if he played his cards right, he would rise the ranks and take the place that both Snape and Malfoy Sr. vacated.
"Why'd you stop?" Harry whined pulling at Draco trying to get him close enough to fill him again.
“Well introducing us went over better than anyone could hope.” Blaise pointed out which made Draco roll his eyes.
"It's too soon, we're not ready yet," Harry and the core had already began to develop a plan for this moment, evacuation of the core being a key component, but it was still too soon.
"I have missed you something awful." Harry laughed, Kingsley had always been like a second father to him and he felt guilty that he didn't come to visit often enough.
"How did you get in?" Blaise looked accusingly at Harry, but Draco seemed more or less unsurprised.
." Kreacher glared at Harry before leaving the room, less than happy with his master. "Master Potter has told me not to tell you his secrets." Kreacher informed Draco sullenly as he set food before the blond.
"Master Harry Potter Sir!" The shrill voice of Dobby pulled Harry from his dangerous thoughts and he composed himself in time to look up and see Dobby standing at his bedside. "Master Harry Potter the guest is cooking dinner and asks you to join him."
"Me too." Draco smiled and kissed him gently on the lips. "Never leave me."
The rest of the visit was rather silent. Ginny still hadn't woken up, but Madame Pomfrey assured them that she had given her some dreamless sleep, and that she wasn't expected to wake up until morning. At one point Ron excused himself to send a letter, but didn't explain to whom. The rest assumed that it was to his parents to tell them what had really happened. Just as he promised, Snape returned to escort them back to Draco's dorm after an hour had passed. Ron and Hermione had already asked them if they could stay on the couch that night, after the day that they had, they preferred to be close to those that they trusted.
“That I am not sure of, my boy. I wish I had more to give you, but that is all that I know about the matter.”
Harry's mind was whirling. He knew that Voldemort feared Dumbledore so it made sense that he would have wanted him dead, but why choose a boy when he himself had never been able to complete the task? Why send a child on such a dangerous task that they could not complete, only to have them return and receive a most harsh punishment.
Draco walked into the common room first, though Severus was right behind him. To any passer by, it would seem that they were perfectly okay, both with their neutral masks set in place, but to the three occupants within, it was obvious that something wasn't right. Before anyone one had time to react, Harry disentangled himself from Ginny and was on his feet and in front of Draco. While the blond didn't seem to react, Harry saw the emotions flit through his gray eyes and before the Slytherin could protest, Harry had him in a tight embrace.
Vipera began to slide back, away from Harry and toward the back of the small room. Jaculus was far less intimidated and stood his ground.
"At least I have a heart! How could you just abandon your wife? How can you ignore the fact that she's in the very room with us, losing her sanity at the hand of her sister?" Severus' voice boomed and Lucius had enough sense to at least back off.
“We have to move faster than I thought. The house needs to be completed and soon. If Voldemort means for you to kill Dumbledore it will have to happen before he is sent from the castle which means it must happen within the week. Once that happens none of us will be safe here.” Harry spoke and everyone seemed to nod together then.
On the other side of the room, Hermione, Harry, and Cho were circling around their group of students, stopping to help those who seemed to have trouble with wand movements or else to force their peer to stop and take a breather in between attempts.
"Oh I'm sure he'd much rather talk
“That’s a good point. I think everyone is done with their class early tomorrow. We can try to have a quick meeting and set up a schedule to have the house complete by. At least that way we have a time frame and also we have an idea of when we need the furniture.”
"We will, just make sure to cheer loud enough for us to hear you." Ginny said grinning. Draco took his leave and the team huddled up to hear the customary pep talk.
"It's Draco, and yes, sorry." Draco smiled kindly to the trio surprising them and buying him enough time to store his thoughts away for further investigation later.
"I am doing no such thing." Severus clipped back.
"Good. I will come by to collect you tomorrow at half past nine. There are some things we must go over before the meeting."
" Harry hissed, not realizing that he once again slipped into the ancient language of the snakes. He rested his head on top of Draco's, closing his eyes and letting exhaustion take over and pull him to sleep.
Ginny raced after the third year and the two weaved around each other in what almost looked like a choreographed dance. They were flying too fast and with a higher skill level than the rest of their teams and soon they had lost them all together. Faking to the left, Demelza attempted to score through the right most hoop, but when the ball left her fingertips Ginny swiped it up as it passed her in the air, turning swiftly and taking off at breakneck speed to the opposite side of the pitch. Demelza was fast, but Ginny was craftier and she was too far ahead for the younger girl to catch up. When she reached the goal she took a sharp right before turning fast enough to give herself whiplash and hurling the ball in the the center hop. The students in the stands watching let out a great whoop as Ron dove in the wrong direction and Ginny made the first goal of the match.
"It's a wonder he wasn't put into Slytherin." Pansy said offhandedly to Draco, though Harry still heard her with his heightened hearing.
“To truly understand what must be done, there are things that I must show you.”
Harry made his way to his new rooms with ease. Doing his best to keep in the shadows, he moved with a cat like grace. He had made it all the way up by the tower when he heard a small noise to his left that alerted him that someone was waiting there. Before he could turn around he felt the point of a wand in between his shoulder blades. He tried to turn his head, but a firm hand at the back of his head kept him in place. If he really wanted to, he could overpower the person both physically and magically. It was obvious that it was a woman, the thin fingers tangled in his hair where soft and slender. As for the magical abilities of the witch, Harry could feel them faintly without seeking them out, but he still could tell that he was more powerful.
“Of course love, but I think your Mum would be more comfortable with just you and Severus for right now.” Harry turned his gaze to the woman in question at the end of his sentence.
"Yes, but if he gets caught taking them then he would be in more trouble than it's worth." Harry pointed out and Luna nodded, trying to think of another way. While Harry started to pace, the girls started to shift through the papers on the table, calling out names of books and remarking on whether or not it could be of use.
"This wasn't the worst." Draco sagged against the wall, not surprised when he felt Harry stand closer to him and he leaned towards him without actually touching. Ever since the day by the lake he could feel Harry’s magic like a physical presence. He took the opportunity then to take comfort Harry's magic in a way that wasn’t possible in their shared classes or when they passed each other in the halls and at meals.
"Just be careful." Draco whimpered and Snape nodded, hating to leave Draco in such a state.
He had hesitated too long and the thing wearing his boyfriend’s face was advancing on him. He moved to raise his wand and cast the counter spell, but Dumbledore was between him and the creature before he could react. The figure before them turned into another man. This one was also blond, but his hair was curly and he had a wild nature about him that Draco never had. He was tall and well muscled and appeared to be in his early fifties. Harry could not see Dumbledore’s face as the man was deliberately situated between him and the bogart, but he knew that whomever this was they were here for the old man and not him.
"Oh so now you're friends? I guess you don't need me here then!" Ron continued to yell and Hermione even sat and joined Harry and Draco at the table, realizing that trying to stop Ron would be pointless. "Oh good, and you too. My own fiance won't even side with me!"
"No, thank you." Ginny could tell that something was very different about Harry and especially after what she saw tonight, she was sure that Draco was the one who brought about that change. Of course a part of her was sad that she couldn't be the reason that he smiled so brightly, but more importantly she was just happy that someone could bring the old Harry back.
"Alright, you lot win." Harry rolled his eyes and the four took their seats around the boy. "I suppose we should start the duel now." Though he sounded resigned, the smile was clear in his eyes and Draco and Ginny both took to the mock stage. "This duel is not choreographed. The purpose of it is to show you the many spells and techniques that we have been teaching you for the past month. Both Draco and Ginny have agreed to do this, I'm sure that knowing them there will be trash-talking involved, I would pay that no mind." At this everyone in the room laughed. "With that being said, I would like to have the two meet in the middle and bow, then take up your dueling stances.
"Of course, which is why nothing you say will leave this room, but if you send us out now I can guaranty you that Ginny will at least tell me because she is my sister and I don't know, I just might forget and tell the rest of the house as I am apt to do." Ron said with a fake innocent look on his face. This made all of the rest of the students in the room laugh and Snape knew that he was completely screwed.
"No, My Lord, you are correct as always." Bellatrix said humbly and bowed graciously before her master.
" Ron yelled and Hermione stepped forward so Ron could see her.
"We trust you, Harry, if this is that important then we all want to be here for you." Hermione smiled form her seat in the front and twenty-two other heads nodded their agreement.
"If you keep that up, we might have to throw the whole going slow thing right out the window." Draco said, moaning in between words when Harry would massage a little rougher over certain spots.
"Very well, if you and Miss Weasley intend on staying over any longer I would suggest you both spend the night, it would not do to have either of you out past curfew."
“Gellert.” There was a break in Dumbledore’s voice that held more emotion than Harry knew how to put into words. It surprised the boy and he suddenly felt the need to see this situation play out before stepping in, if that was even going to be necessary.
"Goodnight, Harry." Draco whispered, yawning and snuggling deeper into Harry's embrace.
Instead of responding, Harry rolled closer into Draco’s arms and willed his mind to quiet and allow him some rest. Draco was right, there was nothing to be had for staying up all night worrying with another day promising more problems on the horizon.
"That sounds reasonable enough, we should have a demonstration at that point. I think that the younger kids especially could benefit from a visual aid." Neville added.
"Voldemort is torturing her with the cruciatus and possibly other curses." Draco's face seemed to have lost all of its blood. The shaking turned into out right trembling as tears started to fall from his eyes as well. Gently Harry let go of the blond, allowing him to fall forward onto his godfather. He wanted so desperately to help, but he knew that there was nothing that he could do. It broke Harry's heart to see how much pain both men where in.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright, but just know I won’t offer to clean cauldrons again.”
“Thank you,” Harry murmured into the blond’s hair. He loved his friends, but spending time apart from them was also a welcomed experience.
“I love you, too. You’ll see. We’re going to find a way to end this war. Now let’s go to bed, love. I’m sure someone or something else is going to try and spell the rug from under us tomorrow and I don’t know about you, but I’d like to be prepared for it.”
"D, Please be careful. There is something going on in the Slytherin dorms, I don't think that there is anyone I can trust any more. I know Nott is involved, but there is a second person and I'm having a hard time figuring out who. I just know that something big is going to happen. P" Draco read the message out loud even though he knew the others could read it just fine over his shoulder.
"But you do and if I have to spend the rest of my life convincing you that you are I will."
Severus was sure that his day would never end by the time he had reached the former Headmaster’s quarters. He had left the Junior Order after he’d finished his meal with the promise of speaking to Harry and Draco privately when they had the time. He trusted the others as Draco trusted them and he knew that his Godson was not easily fooled. Harry was a good kid who highly regarded the trust of his friends, but even he seemed to understand that there were some conversations that were best to have in small audiences. He was tired in every bone; if he concentrated he was sure that even his magical core was exhausted, but he didn’t have time to dwell on such things. His night would not be over until he spoke to his last master and he knew this conversation would be a long one.
Footsteps pounding on the stone drew everyone's attention. Harry was running with a large stack of parchment under his arm, skillfully shrinking it and placing it safely away before brandishing his wand. Everything seemed to slow down then as Draco watched Harry cast a particularly strong binding charm to both Astoria and Nott, effectively stopping them from fighting back. Satisfied that they would not be able to escape the spell, Harry went straight to Draco, worry clearly written on his face.
Snape's parting words were still ringing in Harry's ears as they made their way through the quiet streets of Wizarding London. It was very disconcerting to see a place normally so full of life completely desolate. Harry pulled his hood up further, upping his magic like Snape had suggested. Luna moved closer to Harry instinctively, and the few sketchy peddlers still on the streets stayed clear of them. They made it to Gringotts without incident and as they made their way to the counter, Harry reeled in his magic and dropped his hood, though he motioned to Luna to keep hers on.
Kreacher grunted in response and Draco was surprised that the old house elf didn't make any comments about his master. Even though he was trained well and would never disobey his master, that never stopped him for talking about his dislike for blood traitors.
Not needing to be told twice, Harry jumped out of bed and raced a more than eager Draco to the master bathroom. Using magic to turn on the faucets, Harry made quick work of Draco's pajama bottoms and boxers the muggle way, loving that it allowed him to touch more of the boy’s skin. Starting from Draco's ankles, Harry kissed his way up his legs, alternating from one leg to the other. When he reached the top of his thighs, he purposefully ignored Draco's hardening length and moved up further, stopping to pay extra attention his Draco's nipples before capturing Draco's open in a searing kiss. With their lips locked and tongues dancing, Harry made sure to keep his hands on Draco's hips. He forced him still and he pushed the pale man against the closed shower door.
“Yes, that is what Williams and his grandfather seem to believe. If you knew this already then why would you send me to get the information?” Harry asked hoping to keep his annoyance from showing, though he wasn’t sure just how successful he was.
Draco sat at the large table in the common room as the the hour struck noon. It was Sunday and it seemed that the strenuous work of building a house from the day before had caused most of the core to sleep in. Harry was still snoring away the last he checked and the common room was strangely empty. The day previous had been strenuous on all of them due to the sheer amount of magic they had used. Draco was feeling how his body protested when he used simple spells and he had made a light breakfast of eggs and toast the muggle way, thankful that Harry had taught him how. They had all agreed to meet back in their common room around one and Draco found it surprisingly enjoyable to spend the time alone in the quiet. He loved his friends immensely, but it wasn’t often he got any relaxation in his life. A stirring from the direction of Blaise and Ginny’s room signaled the girl’s arrival. The silence was nice, but Draco certainly wouldn’t mind a little company.
“I’m sure there will be other students finding themselves in detention sooner or later.” Severus shrugged and motioned toward the door making it clear that their conversation was done.
Draco I am okay. I will not be back until late don’t wait up.”
The Room seemed to understand what Harry needed and a table with chairs enough for the six in the front of the room to sit at that looked similar to a muggle press conference set up. They took their seats and the rest of the rooms occupants situated themselves in the rows of chairs that also materialized for them. The group at the table waited for everyone to settle in before continuing.
“There wouldn’t have been much left from the Gaunts and even less that a young Riddle would have been able to obtain. No, there may be another avenue to look down. Riddle was an orphan who had no home and no family to call his own. He came to Hogwarts and it became his home. He believed himself to be an ancestor of Slytherin himself and treated the legacy of this school like it was his own.”
"This is none of your concern." Snape bit back, glaring at his student when he noticed that Nott had gone from smirking up at him to looking terrified.
"Severus is always welcome here, Godric, now let him in before he grows impatient."
"Oh?" Severus asked and instantly he felt Voldemort pry into his mind. Years of practice made him ready for the assault, however, and he spoon fed the man everything that he could ever hope to find. He gave small hints of his anger with Lucius, his pride at his own usefulness, a pinch of fear for his master, and topped it off with an eagerness to fulfill the man's every wish if only to earn the respect that he always wanted. Pleased with these things, Voldemort simply nodded and sneered.
When they arrived, they found themselves standing in the middle of a mad house. On closer inspection, Harry could tell that they were actually very well organized and that they were much farther along then he would have suspected. There were well placed piles of timber obviously farmed by Dean and Seamus, though the two were no where in sight. Draco and Blaise were using spells to strip them down to planks and Hermione, Ginny and Pansy were busy spelling the planks with as many protective and shielding spells that they had found. Ron and Neville were set off from the rest, with rolls of parchment spread out with the plans. They already had wood set down for the frame, though there was still a lack of concrete that would be needed to support the structure, that was where Harry and Luna came in. It seemed that Neville and Ron were just waiting for them to continue.
“But how could you have known that?”
"It's okay." Draco whispered, rubbing circles on the man's back, though his eyes where locked with Harry's. The boys shared a look before Harry joined them, sitting behind Draco, not sure how to act. He and Snape were closer than they had ever been, but this was something that he wasn't sure the man would be too keen on Harry seeing. He had invaded the man's personal space once before and he hadn't been too happy then. He only hoped that this time it would be different.
"May I, My Lord?" The childlike giddiness that seeped into her voice gave every Death Eater the chills.
"Hermione stopped by to pick up the book that she left so she's already here, but Sev wasn't at dinner."
“Mundungus Fletcher,” he spat and Harry growled. He knew the others would not know the name, but he was not in the least bit surprised to hear that the old thief stole from Sirius while he was forced to appear for Order meetings.
"Enough chatter, unless you all want to have detention with him." Snape warned from the front of the class, effectively silencing the class, his eyes sweeping over his students with distaste. While it seemed like he was glaring at the Gryffindors, he was really trying to evaluate if there were any other students acting oddly. It was obvious that Nott wasn't acting alone and that the other person involved had to be smart, but they had no further hints.
"You've taught yourself occlumency!" Dumbledore clapped like an exuberant child, ignoring Snape's mounting anger.
"We have other concerns as well, how did your conversation with Harry go?" Severus bit back a remark about how no other student was ever graced with the honor of being on first name basis with the headmaster, but he thought better of it.
Harry nodded his thanks and took his leave. He made sure to not be seen as he moved from the small room to the main hall, slipping the golden trinket over his neck and resting it against his chest under his robes. The rest of his friends had already taken off, it seemed that they had followed Hermione's orders not to wait for him and Harry did his best to slip into the dwindling crowd without calling any attention.
“Oh, he’ll be along soon I’m sure.” Ginny stole the final piece of toast from Draco’s forgotten plate. “I don’t remember the last time this room has been this empty or silent.”
With the help of his trusty map, Harry was able to find Draco sitting by the lake with Ginny and Luna. The girls saw him first, Draco's back was to him, and when he was close enough to hear them, Ginny warned Draco and the boy turned, his face blank and cold. Harry's heart broke. It felt like ages since he'd seen that look on Draco's face, and a lifetime ago that it had been directed at him. He stopped, a few yards away, and waited for Draco to make a move. When the blond turned again, as if he hadn't even seen Harry, the boy knew just how badly he had messed up, and prepared himself for a lifetime of groveling to make up for it.
!" Hermione shouted the first opening she saw. Pansy was quick to act, however and the strength of her shield actually made Hermione stagger back a bit before regaining her footing. "Nice, that was a quick reaction."
Just as Draco had predicted the man in question was in his private labs, making potions to ease his mind. Draco recognized the batch to be a simple pepper-up that he would make monthly for Madame Pomfrey to stock the Hospital Wing. Seeing his godfather work and seem so at peace made flashbacks of his childhood crop up in Draco's mind and he quickly shed his outer robe and moved into the room to gather more ingredients and start to help.
"If you's is sure." Dobby nodded somberly and then with a loud 'pop' was gone.
“Not all things can be destroyed, but sometimes you can alter things just enough with your magic that you can slip through their defenses, you should still have enough magic when you wake up to make it work.”
"I know that, Potter." Severus glared down at him and Harry held back from countering.
"I know that something is happening between you and Draco, and it's not that I disapprove, but I want to know what you're hiding. If you're hiding something that could hurt Draco, or if you're planning on hurting him—"
"I know you're hiding something, you all are!" And then the metaphorical light bulb went off in everyone's minds. Dumbledore had been letting the attacks and warnings go because he had thought that they where being targeted by Voldemort for information that they where holding back from the Order. Where he had come up with such a theory no one could quite figure out, but the eminent danger of the situation was finally clear.
"Of course, Harry, let me know if I can be of any more use." Dumbledore smiled fondly and Harry saw, for the first time, a glimmer of the man that he once thought he knew.
"Um- Mr. Malfoy should we run the drills?" The oldest of the group of three asked, her head held high to show her courage, though her voice quivered slightly.
"Thank you." Pansy didn't have to explain that she was thanking them for more than a chance at a new life. She was thankful that they were taking such good care of Draco and Blaise, that they didn't question her every move like she, as a Slytherin, would have done in their place. She didn't have to say any of that because Hermione and Luna seemed to understand her pretty well already and they both just smiled and nodded, Hermione returning to her conversation with Ron and Luna to her lunch. Looking around the group, Pansy felt a sudden weight lift from her shoulders and for the first time in a long time she felt like she was finally home.
"I never thought that a Gryffindor like you would have such a mouth." Blaise raised his brow when he was done coughing.
"Both of us?" Harry asked watching his best mate carefully, her words suddenly sinking in.
Harry let himself from the room with ease, making sure to school his face to look as miserable as possible should anyone see him in the halls and question why he left a private meeting with Snape with a smile on his face. He was not surprised to find Pansy and Draco waiting for him just down the hall.
"Okay I know that this was a really rushed meeting, I hope I didn't take anyone from something very important. We are going to try to keep this as quick and simple as we can so unless you have something constructive to say, please wait until we're done." He stopped to catch the eye of every single person around the table first to insure that he had just snipped any danger in the bud. When everyone nodded back at him, Harry continued. "Pansy is here because she has information on Ginny's second attacker. If you want to take over, feel free." Harry nodded toward the girl and all eyes fell on her.
"No." Harry blushed feeling like he'd just been caught doing something he knew he wasn't supposed to do. "I came to see if you could do me a favor. The aurors are currently tearing apart Draco Malfoy's London flat for no reason and it's a disgrace to treat a war hero like that just because of his name."

"Maybe." Draco looked weary. He knew from experience that while Slytherin house protected their own, on the inside it was a house made on deceit, lies, and blackmail. There were very few people that he trusted, one of them being Blaise. "I think I can trust Pansy, but that's about it."
"Blimey Harry, we're going to be unstoppable!" Ron, the new keeper, cried from across the room where he was standing with Dean and Seamus, the teams newest beaters.
Draco's eyes went wide. Sudden flashes of the conversation in Defense Against the Dark Arts ran through his mind. "...it is possible for the casters patronus to change if they become an animagus." "When you are in love with someone, some say with your soul mate, your patronus will change to match theirs..." When Harry turned back, Draco was the first to speak.
"Thank you, everyone." Harry smiled lovingly to all of his friends and Draco couldn't help but notice the pang of jealousy he felt that the looks weren't directed towards him.
"Let her go, Astoria, it's me you want." Harry's voice was stronger than he felt giving him a commanding air that made the girl hesitate.
"I assure, you
"I'd like to see him try and stop me." The two made quick work of storing their brooms and went to dinner, plots of flirting with their Slytherins forming as they went.
"I just wanted inform you about a student group that you may join if it interests you, but if you're going to be this way then I will retract my invitation." Harry responded coldly.
"Just because
“What?”
"I sent them a letter early this morning, if we're lucky they'll come here first to see you and we won't miss the show." Ron grinned and Hermione rolled her eyes.
Draco returned to his temporary home at half past seven. He had gotten caught up in his meeting and hadn't realized that he would be late for dinner. When he arrived he was surprised to find the kitchen empty though he could hear the unmistakable voice of Harry coming from the second floor.
"If I didn't know better, I would say it looks like you're flirting with Draco." Harry joked as he came up to the table. "I've got your timetables, McGonnagal said that all of your professors will understand if you don't have work done today if your class wasn't meant to have it due until tomorrow." Harry handed the two the pieces of parchment over, taking a seat next to Blaise. "And the team list is up in the common room, make sure to check it out when you have your free period."
“Well Harry’ll have no trouble finding it then.” Seamus spoke up. “Who should go with him, though?”
"It was a good meeting, I'm impressed with how well organized you have the students, Harry." Harry colored slightly at the compliment, but took it in stride.
"It's not that simple."

" Harry cried, striking down Nott. He turned to see just who had come to help him in time to hear the cruciatus belt from Astoria's lips. Harry's eyes locked with his ally just in time to see them crumple to the ground, screaming in pain.
"Well who could it be?" Harry asked a silent room. And that was it really, they had no clue and they were all stuck until whomever it was messed up and let something about themselves slip.
"I'm not sure that's necessary, I can make it to my rooms on my own."
“It’s just Harry,” the boy smiled.
He understood, of course. There was no denying that all of the teenager’s magic was heavily imbued into the house where they found themselves, but Severus could pick out Draco’s best. It was as easy as detecting his own magic, having been around the boy his entire life. He assumed that Narcissa could feel it even clearer since it was her own son and his magical core had formed in utero. A child’s magical signature was nearly as natural to their mother as their own. As if to prove his point, Narcissa closed her eyes and breathed in deeply, humming contentedly. Severus savored the moment of just holding her without the fear of lurking danger. There’d been a time when he thought he might never be able to do this again. He was so very glad to be wrong.
?" Ron roared and Harry strengthened his magic in order to keep him restrained.
"Your assumption is correct."
“So good, Harry.” Draco said, not knowing that he was responding to Harry’s question. He had heard the ancient snake language enough to recognize the phrase ‘my love’ and it still amazed Harry how easily the hissing drove Draco mad.
"Well it's up to you." His tone was casual, but the look in his eyes said it all, d
"Why yes, you naturally." Voldemort said, though his eyes seemed cold as ever.
"Are they always this obnoxiously cute?" Pansy asked though the grin on her face betrayed her.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well it wasn’t specifically for that, but it will be very useful.” Hermione produced a very small beaded bag from her pocket. It didn’t look like very much and everyone stared at it.
Draco was sitting up in bed reading a book when Harry entered their bedroom. The blond didn't seem to notice his presence and Harry smirked to himself, quickly thinking up a plan. Silently, Harry spelled all of his clothes into the hamper by the door, making sure to keep out of Draco's peripheral vision until the last second when he also spelled the blond's clothes away. Draco gasped, dropping his book to look up in time to see Harry tackle him. Laughing, Harry straddled his lover, bending down to capture his lips in a searing kiss. Groaning, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's necks, grinding his hips into Harry's.
"Everyone was able to cast a shield charm though a few still need help making it a strong one." Ginny reported while the rest of the members made their way to the refreshment table and started to help clean up.
Narcissa was impressed by the sheer magic that the children seemed capable of wielding and their ingenuity with creating new spells. “Thank you.”
"You don't have to eat my cooking if you don't want." Draco suggested as he sat down at the table, spelling up a serving for Harry, drowning in jam just as the man had eaten them just hours ago. Angry eyes followed his every move, but Ron stood still, just drinking in his own rage.
“Then I’ll leave you to rest. If you need anything at all don’t hesitate to ask, we don’t have any house elves here, but we’ve built a sort of communications system into the wards and you were keyed into the moment you stepped through the door. All you have to do is call out
“Yes. He told me that he had never intended for Draco to kill Dumbledore. He had always know he would fail. He expects me to do it.”
“Do we have a deal?” Fred asked when it was obvious that the man was satisfied that it was in fact actual currency.
"Oh really? And do you have any Slytherin in you?" Blaise asked Ginny, completely missing the knowing looks the two Gryffindors were throwing each other.
They passed through another hallway into a similar cavern, Harry was starting to wonder if they were just walking in circles and predictably as soon as they both filed into the room, the doorway closed. This time the room had two wooden chests waiting for them. They were plain, but certainly of a nicer craftsmanship than the crate that the bogart had crawled from. The wood was dark and exuded dark magic, as everything seemed to in the caves.

"I suppose you will be looking for protection for you mother and father and the clearing of their names?" Harry seemed to sneer with his words, but held the look off his face, instead holding him in a passive gaze that was even more terrifying than the sneer could have been.
“It’s not that it’s a bad plan, it’s just crazy.” Hermione corrected, though she looked just as concerned.
"Come on over, 'Mione." Harry stepped back to let his best friend through. When a dust covered, sobbing Hermione came through the fireplace, Harry was there to wrap her in a huge hug. It was then that Draco cleared his throat to make himself known.
Harry trained his focus to opposite side of the cavern. The snakes were taking care to insure that they came between him and the rear wall. There seemed to be no obvious markings to indicate that was where the door was, but he was sure if he found a way to around to the other side he would be able to find the entrance. It seemed the snakes were still distracted and paying him no mind so he began to inch as close to them as he dared, watching for movement from them, but also placing subtle spells on his glasses, hoping that with a little modification he could magnify the image. If he could convince them that he knew how to make it to the next room he hoped he would gain their trust. Simply killing them would do nothing, there had to be a reason for two snakes in an empty chamber, every task until that point had been deliberate and well thought out, this one would be no exception.
"I'm so glad you're okay, Gin. Fred and George were furious when they found out that Dumbledore just wrote the whole thing off.” Harry said from Ginny’s side in the same spot he had claimed the night before.
Dumbledore was being cryptic as always and it was infuriating. “Of course, they allow you to review your own memories or to see others, why?”
“Okay,” he didn’t like it, but they were running out of options and time and Harry knew that he had to do what was best for the greater good, no matter how much he heated to think like the old man. To destroy Voldemort he would have to find and destroy all of the horcruxes and it seemed very likely that there was one being guarded in the caves. He refused to consider that they could come to the end of these trials and no find one.
"Are they all set, Poppy?" His eyes swept over the three before landing on the woman.
"Silence!" All eyes fell on Harry who looked none too happy with his peers. "Wouldn't you think that I made sure he was being honest before I let him near any of you? Give me more credit than that." Blaise snorted next to him, but Harry ignored him. "Not only has he sacrificed his way of life and well being by aligning himself with us, but he also gave very useful information to the Order, which no I will not divulge here, and if they trust him, if I trust him, then you can at least feel certain that he's not here to harm anyone. You can continue."
“I don’t see anything tricky about it, the process seems quite straightforward. I am more concerned with how many times it can be done.” Harry said, his tone cool as he watched the rusty gears behind the man’s eyes begin to move.”
“What do we do?”
“It is possible, though I doubt he would have used something of Gryffindor’s. The rivalry between the houses might have kept him from choosing something from that particular founder, though anything is possible.”
"I assure you I would never, not intentionally." Harry cut him off before he could threaten him with something undoubtedly painful. Snape had warned him off hurting Draco before, the first time when Draco had gone to Dumbledore to announce his allegiance, and about every week since. If nothing else, Snape was persistent. He seemed to think that something was going on, which to his credit there was, just nothing meant to harm Draco, but rather to make the blond’s life easier while at Hogwarts.
While there had been much joy and celebration between the holidays and the successful animagus transformations, there was still plenty of serious plotting done. It had been decided that the only way to get into Bellatrix’s vaults would be a break it, though the details of that plan where still being formulated as no one could quite agree on what was the best course of action.
"Very intriguing, Severus. Do you think it can be done?" Voldemort asked and all of the other death eater's present where shocked into silence.
"I never wonder about his personal wellbeing." It was childish at best, but Severus was not going to start talking about feelings especially those of a boy he could hardly care less about.
"Well I've just lost my appetite." Draco cringed and took care of his dishes. "Before Weasley began his yelling I heard him mention remodeling. Are you working on the house today?"
Forgetting the issues that faced him all together, Harry let his mind wander back to his dream. It had been the farthest that he had ever gotten with Draco even in a dream. The last two nights it had been more kissing and heavy petting, but Harry couldn't help but wonder if Draco's lips really did feel that good. Abandoning the idea of a cold shower, Harry turned up the heat and began to lose himself in a fantasy. He wondered what it would be like to be with Draco, the real one not the man in his dreams. He figured it would be rough, passionate, he even considered what would happen if Draco had him in the shower like he was now. Harry's eyes closed as his hands began to roam over his body, completely oblivious to the fact that the star of his many fantasies was letting himself into Harry's rooms.
"Well the first time the Manor was raided we were forced to find lodging quickly. It was still so soon after the war no one would let us in so we stayed at a muggle inn. Mum and Father refused to eat muggle food and all of our wands had been stripped of us so I was forced to cook until we could go back. It's sort of like potions, actually, so I took it up rather quickly. I find cooking the muggle way soothing now."
“I suppose he did not go easy on you.” Pansy questioned and Harry sighed for dramatic flare.
“I believe he has hidden a horcrux in the cave which he hurt those children from the orphanage in.” Dumbledore spoke as soon as they stepped out of the memories.
"Harry is a real leader, I trust him with my life."
“You come back to me safe, you hear?” Ginny whispered in Blaise’s ear as she held his face firmly in her hands. “Don’t do anything rash.”
“Come on, we have no idea how long this will last and I, for one, would like to keep the bleeding to a minimum.”
"Mr. Potter, you will serve detention promptly after dinner. Arrive at my office no later than fifteen past eight. Do you understand?" It wasn't a question, but Harry nodded anyways. They where keeping up the act just incase someone was watching outside the door.
"Harry's right." Hermione asserted firmly also turning back to her work, blushing in embarrassment at her behavior. The conversation ended and while Ron was still less than silently fuming, the rest of the lesson went by without an incident.
doesn't mean I did. I don't know why you want to know about these things Mr. Potter, but you best just forget it!"
“I can’t tell you everything Harry, soon there will come a time that you will not have me to rely on.” Dumbledore had the nerve to level Harry with a reproachful look as if he had been the one to do something wrong. “You cannot expect that everyone around you give you all of the answers when you are capable of discovering them on your own.”
“I need safe passage for two, urgently. The enemy is on our tail and I fear we don’t have much time.” He paused a moment before thinking over his next words carefully, knowing that anyone of the teenagers could be with Draco when he received this message. “Draco, I’m bringing her home, just like I promised.”
"What is your name?" Snape intoned.
"It's alright, I thought you weren't going to show." Harry visibly relaxed when the blond was by his side and Katie rolled his eyes.
When they arrived at the guest room, Narcissa was sitting by the window, her face turned towards the sunlight. Her eyes had been closed, but they fluttered open when at the sound of the door. Harry noticed that both sides of the bed looked slept in, but as neither Draco nor Neville had made any mention of this fact, Harry thought it best to remain silent. He could tell just how much Severus cared about Narcissa and it was obvious that he looked at Draco like a son. He could ask Draco his opinion on the matter when they were alone.
“That bad?” This time it was Draco who shot him a look and Harry rolled his eyes to hide his smile.
"You are not sacrificing my daughter to screw us all over." Greengrass accused from the other side of Nott and Snape's brow raised in the classic Snape way that sent most students running away crying.
There was a roaring fire in the hearth, though there was no evidence of floo powder and Harry highly doubt this dodgy old man had many connections to the outside world. There was a single overstuffed chair sat perfectly facing the fire, though another moldy looking couch was tucked against the main window, both looking as if they had seen better days. The air smelled stale and Harry wondered when the last time he’d had a visitor was, or if they were the first people he had seen in a long time.
"Are you sure you've tried everything?" Draco asked gently. He could tell that his lover was more than a little frustrated by the whole situation and he wasn't about to try and test him.
"That's not exactly something I can explain." Harry ignored the glares from the two and continued. "He came to me directly. That takes a lot of courage when you consider our past." Ron snorted at that, but Harry pushed on ignoring him as best he could. "He openly apologized, something I never would have thought possible. He was completely open with me, admitted that he was wrong and a total arse. He told me everything that he was tasked to do by Voldemort and then he followed me to Dumbledore to take his stand."
"I told him that I had it, it was Harry that ended up knocking over all of the boxes, I swear that he's more klutzy than I am." Neville tried to sound affronted at Harry's teasing, but the smile that shined in his eyes gave him away.
Sighing, Harry laid back to drink in the sun. Closing his eyes from the heat of the sun's rays, he imagined that it would burn away the pain, anger, and stress building up in him. As he lay there he concentrated on heightening his other senses. Since the battle at the ministry, Harry had come to the realization that he could no longer wait around to be saved. He spent the summer training himself in any way he could that didn't involve magic. It was because of this that he noticed the soft steps that signaled someone else's approach.
"It is really nice." Draco agreed, but he was smiling directly at Harry making the other boy blush. "It's nice to feel at home here."
“It’s not just a dream mate, we need to get back to him. Neville, Luna go get Hermione, we’ll have to find Snape later. Gin you should come back with us.” Ron barked out orders and the rest of the junior order waited for instructions.
"If you haven't figured that out yet then I'm not going to help. You need to work this out on your own." Ginny said wisely but the kind smile on her face reassured Harry into thinking that maybe, just maybe this would work out for the best in the end.
"Well you must know that I don't really work for Voldemort, and recently I've been trying to keep my distance from Dumbledore as well, he's been an old puppet master for too long and now he thinks he's God. You however are clearly capable, if your actions this year are anything to go by."
“I don’t care how you treat me, just tell me, have you seen this before?” Harry pulled the fake locket from his jean’s pocket and dangled it before the elf. His reaction was instant and visceral. He reared back so quickly from the object the he knocked into Draco.
"Sometimes I don't know if I deserve their trust." Harry whispered under his breath, but at their close proximity Draco still heard his comment. This wasn't the first time that Draco noticed the boy doubt himself. It seemed completely out of character for Harry, his Harry, to act self-conscious, but Draco had a feeling that there was something that Harry wasn't telling him.
“I would never!”
“Well something like that wouldn’t be on the cards, but I’m sure that shouldn’t be too hard to find. Hermione could probably locate it in her favorite book.”
"You promise?" Hermione asked, her voice was small and raw from yelling and crying.
"Cock block." Harry muttered, making sure to kiss Draco once more before pulling back. "See you at practice? You need to run seeker drills with me until I can get McGonagall to agree to let you on the team."

“Well, we’ve managed crazy things before, we got out of Adare and I’ve made it through the death cave, we just need to have a good plan.” Harry said, sounding hopeful.
“You are Artikus Burch, correct?” Blaise was the first to talk and the small man nodded curtly.
” As Severus has predicted, his body merely slumped over as his limbs flailed and his body twitched. He wouldn’t have felt the pain of hitting the floor right then, but it would have left him with an awful bruise that Voldemort wouldn’t have allowed him to heal. Sometimes it was the small things in life that mattered.
"I'm sure that can be arraigned." Harry took the man's smirk as a good sign. He had been afraid that he might have overstepped unspoken boundaries, but as glad to see that he hadn't. Even with everything that had transpired between the two over the years, they where able to sit together and have a civil conversation, something that Harry found himself incredibly grateful for.
"No that can easily be arraigned." Hermione took a quick glance around to make sure that Madame Pomfrey was not around before taking out her fake galleon and changing the time and date to the next day at nine o'clock. "Should we also have another meeting after?"
"Honestly, Potter. You're pretty good at coming up with ideas, but you're really shite at researching them if all you do is stand there. You do know that to find a book you have to look at it right?" Hermione rolled her eyes in a good natured fashion as she often did with Ron, and Harry took that as a good sign. Since her move into the dorm, Pansy and Hermione seemed to become fast friends.
"Patience, love." Draco chuckled, dropping to his knees. Harry watched through lidded eyes as Draco slowly took his cock into his mouth. The sight of the thin, pale lips parting to wrap around him drove Harry mad. It took all of his willpower not to grip Draco by the hair and force him to take him all. By the smug look he managed around Harry’s thick cock it was safe to say that Draco knew just had his mouth was doing to break down Harry’s will.
When the war had first ended the dreams had come every night. No sleeping potions were able keep the horrors of his memories at bay. The screams of the dead cut through him like a knife and his own screams pierced the night, bringing Hermione and Ron running into his room. They had been living with him at the time, pretending that they were lonely too, but they had eachother and Harry knew they were just worried about him. Through the following months the dreams became easier to hide and soon the happy couple had moved out, satisfied that Harry was okay. Sometimes the boy-who-lived felt that his two closest friends knew that he wasn’t actually okay, but he continued to pretend and they continued to follow his lead.
"Sure, Potter, whatever is easier." Blaise answered for them and the brunet returned to his friends. "You sure you're alright there, little brother?"
“Don’t you worry about a thing, I’ll watch over our boys and keep them out of trouble.” Pansy promised.
“I can nearly
“Yes, well breakfast first, and I know Draco wants to talk to his mum before we do anything else.” A hiss from the vicinity of Harry’s chest startled the spy, but not as much as the snake that slithered from under the boy’s shirt and wound its way around the boy’s neck. “
The silence between them so was near palpable this time that Draco was sure he would chock on it. By the time he realized that it was Harry's stray magic, electrifying the air due to his anger, Draco was sure that he would suffocate.
"This is true, My Lord-"
“Thank you,” Narcissa smiled, even if only a small one, before looking around to catch the eyes of each of the men in the room. “All of you.”
“The latter.”
"Sorry I'm late, slept in and then Blaise chewed me out for being out so late. It's like he's my mum sometimes." Draco rolled his eyes falling in line with Harry.
"Why are you getting so invested in Mr. Malfoy's affairs?" Kingsley asked, not unkindly but with a teasing tone to it. “I would think that you’re appearance at his trial would have paid the life debt that you owed his mother.” Kingsley had been there during the trials and had heard all about how Narcissa had spared his life and lied to Voldemort, though Harry had helpfully left out the detail where she had only done so to save her own son.
"So you want me to trick the information from him?" Harry asked carefully.
Harry let the words sink into his bones, settling into his mind until they very nearly became a part of him. “Can you be both? Can you be good and great?”
"Okay I'm sure that you all have more questions, but it's getting late and we all have classes in the morning. I just need all of you to sign the document that Hermione has kindly set up for us on your way it. It just allows me to talk to Snape about this group existing as well as allow him access to this room while we hold meetings should he see fit to come. If you don't want to sign, please come see me and we can work something out."
"Should you be taught a lesson, then? We could make an example of you, though I would think that you would all have learned already." Reflexively all eyes went to the far corner of the room where a large cage sat shrouded in darkness. Inside sat a single cot, dirty from weeks of not being cleaned. There was also a disgusting bed pan that was only emptied once a day and a plate of what could hardly be considered food. Sitting on the floor in the middle of the mess was Narcissa Malfoy, dressed in rags and shivering from the after shock of the cruciatus curse that had been casted on her hours ago. She was the
"I can put in a good word for you, I still have my connections." Harry offered as he buttered up the steaming pancakes, eyes averting the blond's.
"The nargles didn't think so." The girl replied with an air about her that clearly stated that they were done with the conversation. Harry just shook his head, following her into an empty carriage and placing silencing spells around it so they could talk more on the ride down.
"Yes." Dobby nodded looking very uncomfortable.
When Harry's warm, wet mouth closed around his cock Draco saw stars. He clawed at the bedspread to try to get a grip on something, vaguely aware of Harry's arm over his hips to keep him from moving too much. Harry continued to distract Draco while he nudged his legs wider and slicked up his finger with lube. When Harry's first finger pushed at his entrance, Draco tensed, but when Harry's tongue started to make zig zag patterns up the bottom of his cock, Draco relaxed completely and just let Harry work his magic. Sliding his first finger in, Harry wiggled it around looking for that spot that would make Draco come undone. When Draco suddenly let out a loud moan, Harry smirked knowing that he had found his prostate. Gingerly he added a second finger, careful to alternate between hitting Draco's prostate and gently stretching him. By the time Harry added a third finger, Draco was panting and moaning helplessly.

“It’s near three in the morning so explications will have to wait until we’ve all gotten rest, I’m sure you understand.” Hermione said smiling slightly through the looks of worry that she kept casting about them.
Harry stood next to the man and did as he was instructed. With a simple waive of his wand, Harry had a strong shield completely surrounding them. He wasn’t going to pour all of his magic into it just yet, and he concentrated on opening a small gap for Dumbledore to cast the curse.
"Yeah? She didn't cause any trouble I hope." Draco eyed his lover wearily. He knew that he could trust her, she was one of his longest and dearest friends besides Blaise, and he knew that Harry would give her a fair shot, but the thought of the two of them talking alone made him feel a little uneasy.
"Cissa?" Snape asked, his voice breaking. How was he going to tell Draco?
“Here, take this,” he whispered as he held out the antidote. It would not cure her of her madness, but it would take away much of the physical effects of her torture. It seemed that she did still recognize him as Voldemort suggested, and she trusted him enough to take the potion without question. The ever present trembling in her arms and legs seemed to disappear instantly and she looked at him in awe.
“I don’t know. I hope so, but that’s why I want to make sure we have the house built before the winter hols. We need to have a place to go just in case and I want to make sure that we’ve at least got a plan.”
Severus had seen Draco come in and while the potion he was working on was so simple that even the first years could do it properly, he was a potions master for a reason and he hadn't risked taking his eyes off his work to greet the boy. He knew that Draco would understand however and was pleased to see the boy start to gather more ingredients and start up a batch of his own. Draco set up his own work station and began the prepping stages for the potion before putting a cauldron on and adjusting the temperature.
"No, that's Severus." Draco smiled genuinely. "But don't go telling people, you'll ruin his reputation."
"We know that, Ron, but it might be for the best." Ginny said to keep her overprotective brother from trying to fight her on it. "We're just going to have to do what we can."
"He seems to be taking to leadership well, it will be good for the boy." Dumbledore answered, not addressing Severus' first statement.
After another five minutes passed, Snape was about to get up and search for the man when the door to the office banged open and the aging wizard strolled in looking very troubled. Snape stayed quiet while he watched the powerful man set a fire in the hearth without so much as looking at it. He continued on into the room and as he got closer, Snape felt unbelievable dread fall over him. When the man stopped at his desk, he dropped a small object on the surface before taking a seat looking more tired than Snape felt. The Potions Master watching the object carefully, it looked like a ring, but the dark magic that it radiated made his skin crawl.
“There is that empty portion of the basement we can use.” Ginny offered. There was a room that was off the potions lab that was meant to be a storeroom for ingredients, but in their haste they hadn’t had the time to fill it with anything and so the shelves remained bare.
Harry saw the opening for what it was. When Vipera lunged again, Jaculus jumped back and Harry used his expansive magic to cast a wandless, wordless
“Sure, lead the way.”
material in your text.”
Malfoy." Kreacher looked rather displeased, but wouldn't dare defy his master to his face.
“I miss you too, Harry, but remember what I told you when we first met. I am always with you, in here.” As soon Sirius’ hand touched his chest, Harry was suddenly thrown from the dream-like state, slamming forcefully back into his own body. He woke with a gasp, reaching out for his godfather who wasn’t there.
"Because, it took a lot for Harry to admit that this is hard on him, he finally showed us that he is struggling, I just wanted to see that fake mask of indifference leave his face."
"Sure, that sounds good, good night guys, we'll go check on Ginny in the morning?" Harry and Draco left for bed to choruses of 'yes' and 'good night'. It wasn't until they got into their room and closed the door that Harry left out a great sigh, allowing the weight of the day to fall off his shoulders.
"Don't worry, we're all here to remind him." Draco responded quietly, grabbing Harry's hand to hold tightly in his own.
"Harry stop teasing." Harry smirked up at the boy, his normally green eyes black because of how dilated his pupils were. In response, Harry let go of the boy's arms, only to charm silk ropes to tie them to the headboard. Draco tugged at the confines for a second before realizing that he was not going to be able to get free. He was completely at Harry's mercy and the thought turned him on more than he thought it should have.
Harry felt like he was on top of the world. Nothing in his life in the past year had ever felt this right. He was flying over the Quidditch Pitch conducting tryouts for the Gryffindor team. He was not surprised to know that he had made team captain, he had actually been rather expecting it. Katie Bell hovered beside him watching the potential new team members with interest. She was the only other member from the original team left and Harry was heavily relying on her to help make a team that would be as great as the one they had just the year previous. Most of the students trying out where only there to get closer to Harry, but Draco and Blaise sitting silently in the stands seemed to ward off many of the younger students who were too afraid to get near Slytherins. Idiots aside, Harry was too happy to let them bother him anyway, the ones who came with a serious desire to play on the team seemed to be decent flyers.
"No, remember your role, my boy." The old wizard gasped, weakly batting at the rock.
"That's good, I'm sure I'll be able to get the information we need." Harry took the magazine and rolled it up to fit in his rucksack. "Well I think we've gone straight through our free period and lunch, we best get to our classes, I'll be sure to talk to Professor Williams today after class."
"Is that all you got?" Ron called in good nature and Draco glared, redoubling his efforts.
"Threatening students, I see." McGonnagal appeared at the end of the hall walking quickly to see what was going on.
him had shaken the boy to his core. He never asked again, but he always made sure to kiss and lick every one, to worship Harry's body and let the boy know that no matter what his past held, he would always love him. This time, he moved his hands from the scars on the boy's side and instead moved his hands to his sensitive back. Draco's hands were less gentle as he dug the pads of his fingers into Harry's spine, slowly working out every knot they could find. Moaning, Harry let his body relax into Draco's touch, letting his mate take the lead.
“You knew that it would take two people to get through the tests, that’s why you’ve never come here before.” It made sense in an insane sort of way, something that Harry was sure the wizard was capable of.
“You did a good thing today, Nev.” Luna smiled, her eyes both clear and present while looking far off and all knowing.
Harry pulled away gently and Draco looked at him questioningly, wondering if he was changing his mind. He was relieved when realized that Harry was only pulling away to strip off his own shirt, he then reached up to tug at Draco's. It didn't take long, but soon the two were both only in their boxers and they had returned to kissing, this time with hands roaming. It was Harry that took charge next. His hand was firm on Draco and the blond nearly cried out when Harry cupped him through his boxers. Smirking slightly, Harry took the opportunity to flip them so Draco was on the bottom. He made his way down Draco's body, paying extra attention to his nipples before moving farther down and pulling off his boxers. Draco watched, his breath caught in his throat, as Harry slowly wrapped his hand around his length, licking the slit first to capture the pre-cum waiting for him. The gasp that Draco let out was enough encouragement for Harry to continue and he didn't waste time, enveloping all of Draco with his mouth, taking him deep without hesitation.
." Ron made a gagging noise and Hermione rolled her eyes at his antics.
At her words, Harry visibly sagged down onto the couch into her open arms. He buried his face in Ginny's hair breathing in her spiced sent that was unmistakably the smell of Molly's kitchen. It was home. He wasn't sure how long they just sat there, but it was the most relaxing time he'd had since the start of term. Finally, feeling the call of sleep tugging at him, Harry pulled away.
“Yes. You have come in contact with one of them already. The diary that you destroyed in your second year was no normal diary.”
"That may not be true, I'm sure that young Mr. Malfoy still has a friend or two in his house, I'm sure if you talk to him you can figure something out. Until then watch how you act, especially around Nott."
matter." Hermione filled the boys in and Harry nodded his thank you before turning to address the rest of the students, his arms still firmly wrapped around Draco.
"You don't need to be." Harry smiled genuinely, reaching for his mug while unrolling the scroll in the air. He skimmed it quickly, his eyes flying across the lines.
"Of course, my dear." Harry stood as well, pulling the blond in for another searing kiss.
"Thanks. That really does help. I think I'm doing alright, I got the white mist to appear."
"Enough talk about work, boys, honestly." Ginny rolled her eyes also sensing Draco's discomfort. "I was wondering Draco, Neville and I wanted to have a modern wedding with a mix of magic and muggle influences. I haven't the slightest idea where to get high end wizarding suits and I figured you might know where to go."
"More compliments, I see. Honestly Malfoy if I didn't know better I would be convinced that you were not actually the boy I'd met at Hogwarts. That boy would have been caught dead complementing the likes of Harry Potter." Harry teased easily. He was completely in control of both his magic and his emotions and he was able to relax again. Draco's mask fell and the casual smile that Harry was finding himself so fond of returned.
"Well of course not Mr. Potter, you never do." The older mediwitch was able to keep herself from rolling her eyes only because she was a professional woman. "Put Miss Lovegood on the bed next to yours you and Mr. Malfoy can sit and wait on your bed. Who is going to come down and collect you after?"
He had done a lot of thinking about many things over the summer, including his place in the war and in the Order. If Draco had something important to say to him, enough so that he should feel the need to seek him out and apologize in public no less, it would be wise to hear him out first before reacting. Information was exactly what he needed, losing his cool could wait until later.
"Right this way." They followed the goblin into a back office away from the prying eyes of the main tellers and floor managers. They stopped in front of a door that was tall enough for an average human and when they entered it was obvious that it was Bill's office that they were shown to. Many photos of the Weasley family were placed around the room as well as a few pictures of the man and his fiancé Fleur. "He will be back shortly, Mr. Potter." Griphook nodded both to Harry and then to Luna. When the door was shut firmly, Luna let her hood drop.
"What can you tell me about a patronus? I know that I didn't assign this reading first so don't be afraid if you don't know much. Miss Granger?"
“I am impressed that you have made it this far, but I assure there is still many more tasks to go before you find what you seek. This such task it not for the faint of heart. Before you lie two chests, one holds a key which you may find useful in your journey ahead, the other you will find a potion of my own creation. It is deadly to those already injured, magnifying all of your hurts and pains. There are no riddles or hints, you will select a box if you select the poison you will be forced to take it. If it is the key then you are free to move on to the next room. If you refuse to take the potion all of the oxygen will leave this cavern and the next person to try this foolish task will be the one to find your body.”
"Thank you." Ever since the blond had moved in, Hermione hadn't had much time to talk to Harry and had only heard of his crush from Ginny. It was obvious that the two were happy and she was happy for Harry in turn. She only hopped that no matter what happened with Ron, that she would also be able to have the happiness that she knew Harry deserved.
. Harry realized, shaking his head at Voldemort. He was disgusted at the monster’s latest crime against wizarding kind, specifically to children who should not be tortured for things that were never in their power. But what did Draco telling him mean? He was sure that Voldemort had a back up plan set up. He was sure that there was no way that anyone actually expected Draco to succeed. While this didn't mean that Professor Dumbledore was in the clear, what did this mean of Malfoy and his loyalties? Slowly coming to himself, Harry realized that his magic had been let loose, quickly retracting it in time to hear the sharp intake of breath on Malfoy's part.
"I know that my idiot brother and Hermione have been pestering you non-stop recently, which is part of the reason why I’ve stopped trying to corner you to talk. I understand that you don't always want to talk, but don't forget that either way, I am here for you. You can always come to me if you need me."
"Did you tell Mum and Dad too?" The younger girl asked, worried.
"Don't move." Harry was right, it was a girl. The whisper was low and he couldn't place where he had heard it before.
"I believe that we both know what the important matter at hand is." Snape said, his eyes calculating. He took the seat across from the boy, his hands folding on the desk, his tea untouched.
Harry's eyes where shut tight so when Draco's hot mouth completely engulfed his erect cock, Harry was completely surprised and he nearly came at the sensation. In contrast to how he undressed him, Draco's mouth move quickly over Harry's cock, gripping it at the base to keep him from cumming too soon as his tongue teased the underside of the head and then dipped into the slit. Harry was panting and babbling in parseltongue which only spurred the blond on.
"I really should just keep you around, though." Harry laughed after the blush left his face. "But I think the house elves might get jealous that I like your cooking better." The dazzling smile on Harry's face was enough to make a blush rise to Draco's cheeks and this time the men found themselves in the opposite predicament from just minutes before. Harry laughed to himself as he returned to his food, ignoring the look on Draco's face. As much as Harry found the bit of color on the blond's pale cheeks attractive, he didn't want to analyze his own thoughts just yet.
“No, but they have been watching after you and they are so proud of who you have become. They wanted to see you too, but they can’t just yet, not until it’s your time and this is certainly not it.”
" Harry hissed in parseltongue making Draco scream.
"Where are you going?" Harry was startled when he realized that Draco was awake.
He tried to cast the spell again silently, hoping that whatever was causing the unnatural silence would not stop wordless spells, but there was still no light at the tip of his wand. Without being able to hear or see, Harry had no idea what might be coming his way. Fear began to set in for the first time since they let the castle and Harry gripped his wand tight, prepared for the worst.
"Neither will we." Salazar said from the portrait above the fireplace. He and Godric where sitting on the love seat in the picture, wrapped up in each other just as Harry and Draco where.
In the privacy of the locker room, both Harry and Draco were forced to see this situation at face value. Had this been Ron or one of his other mates, Harry would not have these butterflies fly around in his stomach, but he refused to overanalyze them. There would time for that later in the privacy of his well warded four-poster bed.
"Nah. I love her death, but she has six older brothers and a father to drive her crazy about boys. She doesn't need me to add to that." Harry smiled kindly this time trying his best to be supportive though all he really wanted to do was laugh at the other boy's comical expression.
"You need to calm down, we can work this out rationally." Albus tried, this time his smile faltering. Sometimes he wondered if Harry and Severus ever noticed that they were very similar. Neither could really hold in their temper, though Harry seemed to be quickly mastering that skill much sooner than Severus at any rate which amused Albus to no end.
"I'm not sure, but I think I should go make sure." Draco sighed. "I'll be back later, don't worry about it okay?" Draco kissed Harry gently on the lips and Harry smiled back.
"Would I?" Harry asked and Draco could hardly remember what Harry was referring to anymore as he watched as his full lips moved forming words that might as well have been in another language for how much Draco was actually processing them.
"Then why don't your treat me like an adult? Tell me what's actually going on?" Harry demanded. Madame Pomfrey looked like she was about to cut in, but a swift hard look from Snape silenced her. He wanted to hear the old man's answer as well.
“We’re going somewhere? Where?” This was the first that Harry had heard about them taking a trip and he mentally reviewed the conversations he’d had with the headmaster to make sure he hadn’t forgotten something.
The holidays came and went in the home of the Core Junior Order with more fanfare than what would be deemed appropriate since they were in the middle of a war, but Harry and his found family could not be bothered to feel contrite. They had decorated the house with a mix of handmade decorations and conjured ones. Hermione and Seamus had lead them through muggle traditions like baking and decorating sugar cookies while the rest of the wizard raised teenagers shared their own family traditions. Presents would have been hard to come by since they were essentially on lockdown and instead of exchanging things, the group had vowed to take a break from their tireless research and studies for the two days leading up to Yule, Yule itself, and the day after. If nothing else, Harry knew that he and his found family would always have the memories of those short four days; they’d honestly been the happiest of his life.
"Draco will accept you no matter what's happened in your past, Harry, you know that. I think you're more afraid of facing it again." When the boy nodded and hid his face in the fringe of his hair, Hermione moved around the table to pull him into a strong hug. Both were surprised when Pansy also came to hug the boy too, but the extra comfort did wonders and when both girls pulled back he had a small grateful smile on his face.
"Honestly, the rate in which you go through butter beer-" She was mumbling under her breath, but they all heard her causing all the boys to laugh and Hermione to roll her eyes. Ginny went off to the small kitchenette with Hermione to help the girl prepare snacks and drinks. Blaise moved to the large table that Seamus and others had been doing their homework on earlier, clearing it by hand in order to sort out whose work was whose, placing them in neat piles on one of the smaller desks against the wall.
"Alright then, have you figured out who will be dueling?" Hermione asked, ever the obsessive planner.
“Pretty much,” Draco nodded. “It’s not ideal, but the safety of the house and the core is far greater.”
"It seems we've had an incident in the Gryffindor girls locker room. Someone threatened Miss Weasley with a note written in blood in her locker." It was possibly the most words that Harry had ever heard Severus speak when he wasn't angry. The true gravity of the situation was lost on the Headmaster.
"I never knew he was your Godfather. I suppose that explains why he protected you so much when we were school."
“Thank you, I’m sure we can find our way, there is no need for you to worry about us.” Severus let them into their borrowed room and Hermione turned to go back up to her own. Narcissa had been quiet throughout the entire escape and entry to the core’s home and she let him bring her further into the bedroom without complaint. As much as he wanted to rest he knew that he had to see to her first. “Do you want to wash up first? I know you must be tired, but you will likely feel better after.”
"If I can at least know who the the second person is then I can gain their trust by telling them." Snape reasoned and Voldemort seemed to look convinced.
"She knows about Nott, which isn't surprising because he’s an idiot, but someone smarter has to be pulling the strings. She said that she knew there was an other person, but not who they might be. We do also have to consider that she could be working with them, this could be a trap, they're right Dray, we can't trust her blindly."
"What? You never said what room and I thought that this would be the most suitable." Ron shrugged and tried to act as if Harry's glare didn't bother him, though the slight cringe on his face gave him away instantly.
"How are you doing?" Harry asked Draco when he made his way over to the boy. Before he let the blond answer, he handed him a piece of chocolate and waited for him to finish it.
“Come in,” Severus called and the three were surprised to see Neville at the door.
"Honestly that boy is going to get himself killed." Hermione's voice startled the three as she took a seat on the bench bellow them.
Well things were certainly not going as planned and Harry realized he would have to think fast if he wanted to get out of this alive and without killing the snakes unnecessarily. He doubted that would allow him to leave the cavern. It seemed that there wasn’t going to be any explanation for what he needed to do to pass this point of the cave. Voldemort would have certainly expected that anyone who had the skills to get this far would not need any instructions because they would not be able to kill both snakes. To test his theory, Harry took a step forward, not surprised when both of the snakes hissed.
"Treason? You're the one who is too weak to go through with our Master's wishes! I have worked far too hard to be spoken down to by the likes of you! I may be a half-blood, but I'm doing far more in this war than you are! I might not agree with Draco's choices, but even the Dark Lord said that if I can return him to our side he will not be punishment free, but he will not be killed! How hard is it for you to care about your family more than you care about yourself?"
