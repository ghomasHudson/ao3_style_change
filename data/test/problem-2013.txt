“He does have a lot on his plate right now,” Fleur said firmly, “This is a stressful year, is it not? With the tournament and all. I would imagine he gets enough attention normally. Now this?”
“Oh,” Hermione said, putting a hand over her chest, “I didn’t-”
"Draco said... there was something we tap with out wands? Like to get into Diagon Alley." She yawned. Ron gave a panicked look over her head. Harry was in a similar place. Were these muggles not supposed to notice them hopping in the water to tap random bricks with sticks? Hermione was getting more tired by the minute too.
Draco gave him an exasperated smile. Harry was clearly trying so hard to be casual about this. To show that he could handle Draco telling him about this stuff.
"I... just wanted to say, um," he said and shifted a bit as he turned to look at Hermione in the eyes. She waited. "You look beautiful," he said quietly. Hermione stared and then looked away. "
A voice whispered in his head and Draco bit his lip, glad his face was obscured for the moment.
, Harry. You aren’t even that angry at him! You’re just upset that he was entrusted with information
Draco stared a bit at them all in horror. Sure, he was a little taken aback by Ron making prefect - especially when the Hermione decision was such an obvious choice - but why were they acting
“Hey,” Harry said suddenly as they descended from the sky, “You never told me why you could see thestrals.” He said. Draco grimaced. He was absently patting the side of his own thestral’s neck before remembering Harry, Neville, and Luna were the only other ones who could see them.
of this? “You should probably both get closer,” Harry advised them, “Otherwise you might miss it.”
Draco snorted, rubbing his eyes as he sat up.
No offense, of course. Ginny and Harry were an adorable couple. He just meant… okay, he wasn’t sure what he meant. Except he did. Listen, Draco had a rough summer. Nobody should expect him to be coherent. Especially about emotions.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So Harry’s the king,” Draco said, slamming down the chess piece. Ron snickered. “I’ve asked Hermione to put me in contact with Viktor,” he added, trying to quickly move on. “What piece would you make him?”
"What's this Mirror of Erised thing then?" He suggested, tempering his voice as much as he could given the circumstances. Theo gave a weak smile, seemingly appreciating the effort.
"Oh, uh, thanks, Cissa." Rowle told her. Nobody looked too thrilled by the offering, but it looked as though they were trying to placate her by taking small sips. Draco internally shook his head. He never knew his mother was so beloved among this group. His father's jaw clenched, looking at his wife with obvious betrayal before pushing one of the wands pointed at him to the side.
“I want to join.” He muttered.
“It isn’t
"Please," he said, standing up, "Not... not right now." He began, "My wife is-" He began, but was silenced by Theo quietly putting his wand down. Blaise followed. So did Pansy. Tristam. Astoria. Others that Draco didn't recognize.
“Your father was a dork,” Draco said, deciding to use Lily’s term in order to avoid offending the dead. “Explains a lot about you.”
“I’m not pouting!” Harry pouted. Draco looked at him. “I - he just wasn’t -”
“You what?” Draco asked and yawned. “Listen, I need to figure out what a pac man is.” He said. Muggle studies was really a wild class, wasn’t it?
to find him. He also found it immensely amusing that nobody seemed to confer with his cousin (you know... an auror) to see what she thought.
Fine.
The door swung open and Lucius Malfoy walked inside. Draco straightened up instantly, all too aware he must look disgusting given recent events. Behind him, Dobby also stumbled in with low whimpers and flinches.
“Ah, yes. Phlegm.” Ginny muttered. Draco sighed. Oh boy.
“I see,” Longbottom said slowly, “Why was your aunt imprisoned?” He asked. Draco blinked. That… was actually a good question. She was a Death Eater, yes, but so were his parents and Snape… they all managed to find a way out of their sentences. Biting his lip, he turned to look over Longbottom for a moment.
"No," Hermione answered tersely, "Their numbers are hurting thanks to Draco's poisoning and the explosion at the manor," she said. The mention of the manor made Draco's pocket feel heavier now that he was aware of the letter within, "So they aren't going to be focused on muggles when they should be redirecting their efforts towards the war - and hopefully the Elder Wand." She said. Harry nodded.
He gasped, "You were the specky git," he grumbled, thoroughly offended by the whole idea of being 'bony'. Please. "All scrawny with clothes three sizes too big."
Besides, he had other issues at the moment. As expected… Hogsmeade with Theo was a bit of a disaster.
“None of your business,” Draco snapped back and then immediately reconsidered, “Tomorrow we’re supposed to go to a Beauxbatons party.” He added before he could fill in the blanks with something else. “Where’s Ron?” He asked, “You two did make up, right?”
Draco nodded.
"We don't know, mate. That letter might be a good sign," he said and then glanced between Harry and Hermione, "But... Remus had a, um, theory," he explained. Draco felt a stab of impatience. What? Why couldn't they just spit it out? Perhaps Harry felt the rise in tension because he spoke next, reaching up to lightly tug Draco's hand until he sat back down.
For the record: Draco didn’t have a temper. Not really. Not exactly. Sort of. Listen. When you’re surrounded by two dying people and some twat who is technically not even real yet comes along saying they were going to kill you with a sword like this was 1536 then sometimes you let anger override other senses.
“Oh,” he said as he looked down at Ginny, “Is she dead?”
No. No, no... Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
“You’ll get used to this,” she informed the baby bump, “You just have to promise me you’ll help me keep them from doing stupid stuff all the time. It’s a tough job, but you’ll get the hang of it.” She said fondly and picked up the hospital bag that Sirius and James had left behind. There was another burst of green before James stumbled back in.
"Do you have it?" He asked and Dobby paused before glancing over his shoulder. Then with a grin that Harry warily recognized as a mischievous one he turned back to them and snapped his fingers. A jar with holes fell from the air. Sirius reached out and caught with a smug smile. Frowning, Harry leaned forward to see a rat with three paws was desperately clawing at the sides. Peter Pettigrew.
“Are you alright?” A girl asked him curiously and Draco recognized her from the train. The muggle girl who was hanging around Potter earlier.
Harry paused to find Hermione looking back at him. Only she wasn't in the ripped and muddied robes he bad last seen her in seconds ago. She looked oddly clean in a silk dress that was covered in blood. Harry raised the Death Eater’s wand. What was this? He opened his mouth to ask only for the sound of a door opening behind him to follow.
“Excuse me?”
Right. He needed to focus.
“How can it be okay?!” Harry asked, spinning around, “I don’t know what I’m doing, Draco!” He said, voice shaking more than he had ever heard it, “My mother is the reason I survived as a baby. The reason I survived Quirrell. Fawkes is the reason I survived the chamber. Sirius would have died if Hermione didn’t have a time turner and-”
Draco blinked. Who said what now?
He added as an afterthought and sat up, wincing at the pain shooting through his shoulder. Ron and Hermione were suddenly there. Harry was to the side - eyes wide and the snitch still in hand, looking torn between outraged and horrified.
He looked around to find - ah. This was Draco’s memory. He felt himself flush a bit as he glanced around the hospital wing. This would have been shortly after the Quirrell debacle. Draco was lying in his bed, picking at the sheets as he tried and failed to fall asleep.
“Even after all these years you’re still so condescending.” He muttered. Draco chuckled before grabbing a few eggs and opening his trunk. Harriet was tucked away inside, curled in one of Draco’s scarves. He sighed as she lifted her head up. For the past few months she had remained the same muddy brown color and about the size of his forearm with no change. He turned to Harry.
was a detective. He was very smart.” He added thoughtfully, “I told Harry he should write to him to solve the Chamber of Secrets nonsense, but he just laughed at me.” He added with a grumble. Nymphadora snorted.
“I’m fine with holding it.” Draco said and Hermione slammed her hand against the counter to make them all jump.
"It isn't just about him," Severus said sharply, "He is merely who people rally behind."
“I cannot stand him. Hermione, let me hit him-”
Ron, Hermione, and Harry left for Gringotts the next day.
There was an awkward pause.
Bellatrix’s grip on Draco only tightened.
“I asked you,” Voldemort said, robes sweeping broadly as he turned, “To bring me the prophecy. You told me you could do this.” He said, taking a step towards her. Bellatrix took a sharp breath, stepping back slightly.
“That’s your choice.” Draco told him coldly. Lucius looked at him.
“You think so? I do hope the Headless Hunt might share your thoughts, young Mr. Malfoy,” he mused, and Draco reached very deep into his soul to whip out the smile his mother always wore when she was forced into dinner parties.
He was a little pissed off about it, quite frankly.
"I'm helping." She said firmly and then flinched again when she tried to move. Harry opened his mouth to respond when a sudden pop followed. A pop and -
“Well, Hermione always tells me about muggleborn things, but I figured that… I mean, part of why purebloods don’t really like muggleborns is because they have to explain magic to them all the time because they don’t know things and I thought maybe it might be the same the other way around.” He said and took a deep breath, “And I made Hermione angry at me a lot this year so I don’t want to keep asking her about things
have to write a sixteen-inch essay on boggarts right before Christmas?" He asked and Harry rolled his eyes, "That seems a bit cruel and you look like you're a very nice professor." He tried. Andi considered, tapping a finger to her lips as she thought with what Draco assumed was all of her six-year-old wisdom.
would be a bloodbath. Andromeda might have read his mind because she was already shaking her head. "If my kids are both here then I'm here. Ted will take care of Teddy." She said and then pointed a finger, "You're lucky it's me and not him who came. I should warn you that the next time he sees you might involve a lot of yelling."
“No. No, you…” Draco trailed off before nodding. “I get it.” He finally said quietly. “It just sucks that it’s something I need to think about at all.” He muttered. Neville looked at him. “...sorry. That was probably, um, insensitive. Given that… uh, you know. Your parents being tortured into madness probably sucks more.”
“Right through here,” he said, gesturing to an area where all the curtains seemed to be bunched together against a wall to form a sort of impromptu maze. Just as McLaggen turned, looking for Hermione, Draco brought out one of Bellatrix’s knives and pressed his right up against his stomach. “So,” he continued as McLaggen jumped.
Please — I'll do anything!" She said as more gathered around. Draco looked around the room. He had an idea. Swallowing, he grabbed his mother's arm, hoping and praying that mothers had that extra sense she always claimed they did. Panicked eyes met his own and he squeezed before slipping something into her hand. It didn't ensure anyone's survival, but... Hell, he wouldn't go down without a fight at least.
“With
Sighing, he reached into his pocket (with his non-Harry-occupied hand) and managed to tug out the worn piece of parchment that had been burning a hole in his pocket all day. Nobody had really pressured him to open it, but he knew the others were anxious about what its contents held as well. Draco just wanted some privacy knowing that... well. The words might not bring good news. Plus, he couldn't be sure who it was even from.
“I… was a little, you know. Not great. After the Department of Mysteries I got a little obsessed with… things. Focused on occlumency all the time. Trying to figure out where Voldemort was hiding. I had Sirius and Remus train me when I couldn’t sleep. Everyone tried to help, but… they were all really gentle about it. Ginny was the only one to tell me to snap out of it.“ He shrugged, “I just preferred to be around her. Then I kissed her and that was that.” He said. A pause. “Ron was...not thrilled. At first.”
Draco still wasn’t really much into physical affection like his three friends seemed to be. While they were typically the ones to hug and ruffle hair and do all that gross stuff, Draco opted for more of the shoving approach (par Hermione). Ron was actually his favorite in this regard since he seemed to always know how much affection Draco could stand and never crossed that line. It was probably a perk to having to learn to read so many wildly different siblings.
"Don't let them con you-"
“Will do!” Harry said brightly and lightly shoved Draco as he passed, “Are you sure you don’t want to stay with us for the summer?” He asked innocently. Vernon’s face went purple.
“Um, nothing.” He said quickly and ran a hand through his hair. “Do you have a potion that can fix this?” He added with a vague gesture to his hair. Draco grinned.
“Quite well and concerned about you too,” he said. Ugh. Gross. Draco just wanted to make sure they were alive. Not if they were
"Dance?" Draco repeated and Harry nodded, still pulling at him.
“It has some holes, but they won’t think to question it since you were under so much stress.”
“You know,” Draco snapped, trying to keep the fear out of his voice, “I don’t particularly care to see your hair.”
The problem was... there wasn't just
“He’s trying to kill everyone.”
“Looks as though Malfoy is blocking Potter so he can catch the snitch. Um, I don’t quite see how he plans -
him. Damnit, he had warned him!
"I only need an hour or so," Hermione promised. Harry gave a small smile as she practically fell through the tent. He would give her a couple hours. She more than deserved it after Godric's Hallow. He replayed it all in his head over and over again. His parents' graves. The busted house. It was easy to let his mind wander as he stared at the light sprinkling of snow surrounding them in the woods. It was oddly peaceful for a war. His mind drifted back to Draco.
Draco struggled some more. He could feel the knife pressing in deeper, letting beads of blood roll down his neck. He gave a small whimper before trying to jerk away again.
“I’m planning on moving students out of Hogwarts. Not just Slytherins, but… a lot of the young ones. I want to move them out of here before I bring the Death Eaters in,” he explained. Andromeda nodded, “Theo left your safehouse so I’m not sure if that’s the best place for them. I don’t know where his loyalties lie now,” he admitted, “But I want the kids either in Beauxbatons or Durmstrang. I have people there that can help keep them safe,” he explained. “They can also help you set up a new safehouse for the rest of the Slytherins.” He told her.
“I’m not sure they deserve you,” she decided and patted the side of his face, “Go say bye to your friends and we’ll get your bags and floo powder,” she told him. Draco paused.
“Yeah,” he said with a shake of his head, “It’s… not easy to be a lawyer for a hippogriff.” He said with a wary glance at Hermione. She really looked terrible. Dark bags were under her eyes and her skin much too pale. Her eyes were bloodshot and hair even messier than usual – which was saying something. He really did have quite a few friends with bad hair, didn't he?
“What did it do to him?” Draco asked as Severus seemed to register the pain, gasping suddenly.
“What do I care if I get bitten by a werewolf?” He asked as Sirius (now a giant black dog) put himself between them and Lupin (who Draco felt like just came by to cause more problems, honestly. Harriet could have just told them that Sirius was innocent and he would have believed her), “I’m disowned and a Gryffindor. Bring on the full moons.”
“And he couldn’t have kissed you
He shook his head clear of it, taking a slow breath to slow down his heart.
Draco didn't know why it was there or how it got to be on the grounds in the middle of a battle... but he did know what Neville needed to do. Nagini was by Voldemort's side, tongue flicking out. Draco looked around. How could he tell him? Voldemort was seconds from -
“Okay?” He asked and Ginny looked pointedly at that paper, “Oh. Right. Yeah.” He sighed, “It should be a fun little family get together.” He muttered, shutting it with a little more force than necessary. Ginny gave a weak smile.
the idea that she wasn’t healing properly. Harry grimaced and edged closer to the trunk, putting his chin on his palm so he could hiss to her. After a few minutes, he nodded and sat back up.
“You kill me, you know that? Voldemort won’t need to finish me off. Blimey.” He muttered “Ron is going to pitch a fit.” He added, pointing his fork in the direction Smith had walked off. Draco wrinkled his nose.
“So…your friends suck.”
“As always, I’m open to sabotage, but I know you won’t let me.” He tried instead. Harry turned to give him that patented Potter look of disapproval. “Listen, if Zoe is having an unlucky day during the first task and we get her close enough-”
“Gross.” He grumbled, pushing her off of him. Hermione gave a bright laugh. “You’re my best friend too.” He sighed.
"Hey, Jenkins," he greeted a few weeks later and put down a few cups of pudding at the edge of his bed, "What do you have for me?" He asked as he grabbed a piece of parchment and quill. Jenkins had been a
“Theo, obviously. Zacharias Smith, Lee Jordan, Anthony Goldstein, Terry Boot, Tristam-”
“I - yes, I know,” Montague muttered, not meeting his eyes. Draco scoffed. Pathetic.
“Is your scream fatal?” Belby cut in, twisting his hands together nervously. Tristam pursed his lips.
In the following years down the road, when Harry inevitably gave his retelling of their years at Hogwarts, it would include a lot more details on things Draco didn’t really care to do into detail on. Especially about mundane things like Hermione storming out of divination, Twelawney talking like a possessed person, Buckbeak dying, and their very intense quidditch match against Slytherin.
“You wish,” he threw back, and Draco tried not to laugh at how badly he was going to be obliterated. Then, of course, it all backfired when the snake enchantment Severus had suggested revealed some surprising talents.
The whole rabbit chase ended up taking several hours. When he sniffed out Hermione once again she was by the lake with homework spread out. She grinned when she saw him.
“We could give him a cursed gift. Like, say it was from an admirer wishing him good luck and when he opens it-”
he choked out, “Don’t. Please.” He whispered and a hand was on his shoulder, squeezing tightly. “Please.” He repeated numbly. Something brushed his cheek.
"You didn't even do that."
“What are you -? Harry, stop.” Draco said and snatched the potion back, “Give me that.” He added and took the comb too. “How do you not know how to brush your hair?” He sighed and tried to spread out the potion beyond the area the idiot had dumped it all on. In the end he had to force Harry to sit down so he could properly fix it. His hair was actually really soft. Draco would have never guessed.
"Don't get cocky, Potter." Blaise said, emerging from the crowd to also put his wand down. Then came another. And another. People were lining up to place their wands down so that Harry had a small pile at his feet. Draco inwardly groaned. Oh, this would be a
Blaise slowly shook his head.
"No!" Draco practically yelped and flinched when his head thrummed with pain. God,
"I suppose."
people? Why? Because they’re Slytherins?”
"Accio!"
Luckily, Draco was considered a late reinforcement so most of the ire wasn't directed at him. He figured he would stay low for a few days just in case. He squeezed the watch around his neck patiently and waited for Ron's response. A warmth followed soon after along with the feeling of reassurance. Good. The others were safe then.
“I see, I see. I heard of the accident this summer as well. Very impressive. Unfortunate, but
“What are you even going on about?” Draco asked and Harry closed his eyes.
Five... Five...
“...but why?” He muttered. Lupin cleared his throat.
“He’s difficult to read because you didn’t raise him,” she muttered. Narcissa tensed. Right. This wasn’t going to go as well as he had hoped.
"Sorry," Draco said quickly and sighed, "I don't want to play the guilt card, but I do think Bellatrix's anger helped me learn my lesson." He suggested. At that, Andromeda's ire seemed to melt away and she pulled him into a tight hug. Draco hugged her back, feeling any residual anxiety from the past few days automatically leave him as he clutched at the sleeves of her dress with a deep breath. "I didn't mean to worry you." He whispered.
“Yeah, because she’s running out of pureblood marriage options, Theo. At this point it’s probably only you or an even worse bloodtraitor.”
He tried. Ron considered and then held up his hands.
"Draco, please," his mother told him and tried to move closer towards him. Draco watched her warily, "Cassiopeia was... she was only the beginning of it. It was a sign we had overstepped what we thought we could do. We had assumed, at least, you and the Parkinson girl would one day fall in love. You two were both so close as children... We figured we could at least grant you the freedom to marry someone you would love, but then... the tests came back..." She muttered, "Everything we tried to give you just soured."
Draco had no idea what dirt he apparently had, but Blaise paled slightly.
a bishop-”
"I... don't think Draco is quite up for robbing a bank," Sirius said slowly. "He can barely sleep for more than an hour at a time. Remus says some of the stuff they did-" he started and then stopped at the look on Harry's face. "He'll get better. He will. You just need to give him time."
“What was that about?” Draco asked, nodding towards where Severus disappeared again. Harry glanced over.
"Well," he said and rubbed the side of his arm, "Now that everyone knows everything you've done... I can promise you that the Weasleys will be coming to bother you," he told him and Severus fixed alarmed eyes on him, "Yeah, I can't save you there. Also, the Delacours too," he mused, tapping his fingers absently against his thigh, "It's going to be a lot of forced social interaction."
"I will," Harry interrupted, "But I want to wait here. In case you need me," He said and Draco bit his lip... then nodded. There was no harm in having him hide out with the cloak. It would be over soon enough... and then Sirius would get him somewhere safe. There was another shimmer and he felt something squeezed his hand before the pressure was gone. Draco tried not to let the wave of emotion that washed over him stay for very long.
“Hi,” He said and grabbed her hands so they were cupping hers over his cheeks. “I’ve missed you.” He said. Then glanced around warily. “Did… Severus…?” He asked, unwilling to risk the rest. Did Severus tell them all that he was alive? He had hoped him appearing out of nowhere didn’t come as a shock. Andromeda nodded. Good. They knew enough then.
"So, what I'm hearing is that you wouldn't tell me if Dumbledore had a Deathly Hallow?" He asked. Severus sighed, "Honestly, why do you even do this? What motivation do you have?" He asked, throwing up his hands. He paused to check the potion again before redirecting his frustration back to his godfather, "All I can gather is that you were once close to Lily Potter and... I don't even know! Is choosing this side of the war because you owe something to her? It feels like you would rather be with the Death Eaters for real," he said.
"Sirius," Pettigrew began, but Sirius had already struck so fast that it was actually impressive that the other man had managed to dodge it all. Harry raced past - Pettigrew might escape, but he was really no danger to Sirius. Besides, he had to find Draco. Sprinting up the stairs he looked around desperately for a sign of where to go as Ron grabbed their things still sitting on the table.
“Are you okay?” He asked quietly as the others continued deeper into the forest and Theo swallowed.
Jumping, Draco whipped around to see McGonagall in the doorway, lips pressed in a thin line.
“You’re a visionary.” Harry mumbled. Shaking his head, Draco walked over and flicked his head. “Hey!”
"Ron-"
“Nah, Viktor Krum took Hermione to the ball. No way they would add that stuff to them-” Tristam began, but Zoe cut in with a shake of her head.
Bellatrix barely dodged in time. The spell nicked her arm, sending her stumbling back with a sharp gasp of pain. When she looked back up her eyes were wild. Not that she had much recovery time because Andromeda stuck next, sending a yellow jet of light hurtling at her.
...well, then. Draco stood up. He liked Jenkins. The man was very strange, but Draco figured that was how muggles were. Maybe when the war was over he would break him out and buy him some pudding. For now, he'd leave his memory alone.
“I mean, it’s showing,” Draco said slowly, “I keep telling you that if you apply yourself you would actually get pretty decent grades. You nailed potions this morning.” He said. Harry laughed. It was nervous. Draco tilted his head. “Are you hiding something?” He asked, quite bluntly.
"...the Delacours."
Oh dear. Not the voices. Draco gave Hermione a worried look. They had both been silently investigating Harry and the sudden whispers he had begun to hear. Draco’s theory is that he could talk to the dead (well, other than ghosts kind of dead). After all, there had to be
At least McLaggen continued to stay far, far,
Luckily, his ailment didn't last too terribly wrong. As suspected, he was fine the next morning. Sirius had responded the following day.
“Seamus Finnigan told me you turned into Umbridge’s pet,” he sneered back, “What? Are you going to tell her about the DA next?” He added in a low whisper. Draco tilted his head a bit.
as pathetic anymore. Ron had actually filled out a bit more so his height didn’t look so disproportionate… for now, at least. Draco wouldn’t be surprised if he had
"I don't know," Andromeda told him, "I really don't. Ever since last year he had a million plans in place. Some I knew about and others I didn't. He might have escaped and just be hiding somewhere, but I can't risk anything. Not with..." She swallowed and looked at where Tonks had also gotten quiet. The rest of her words went unsaid. Andromeda simply buried her face in her hands. From the couch, Hermione shifted slightly in her sleep.
“Is this because of what I was saying earlier about love potions?” He asked and Harry bit his lip, “Because amortentia and Felix Felicis don’t operate similarly at all. Didn’t your Half-Blood Prince tell you that?” He asked.
“It’s not fair,” Ron disagreed and lightly kicked him, “Come on. Let’s grab Harry and ditch. Your grades are already perfect.”
. He walked over, kneeling down in front of him.
“She can,” Harry said and clapped him on the shoulder. Draco tried to turn around again, but Harry yanked on his arm impatiently. “Look, she wouldn't normally, but we both know you wouldn’t walk away if Nott caused trouble-”
“A month.”
“No,” he said, figuring being honest was his best bet, “But I don’t think it can hurt.”
“So where is it?”
“I don’t like Theo.”
“I’m surprised she still wants to talk to you,” Longbottom bit out. Draco felt his own temper rise.
It appeared it was time to see how much of a Gryffindor he was after all.
“Change.” Lupin’s voice said, stepping in front of him. Immediately, Draco watched as the Slytherin-clad version of himself melted away, forming a moon before Lupin flicked his wand.
“If you ask me a stupid question then I reserve the right to leave,” He said and Sirius clicked his tongue at him before bringing out a copy of Skeeter’s article. Draco groaned. “Not you too. I’m
,” he told him and knelt next to the girl still placed by the glass wall, “Lyra, you have to do your potions essay eventually,” he prompted and the girl groaned.
“How’s that even possible?”
years in Azkaban." He reminded her and Harry nodded.
"Ah," he said and nodded, "I suppose you are upset-"
Severus Snape might be many things... but a fool was not one of them. Draco knew this. It was why he decided he would be upfront the second he called Draco out on his bullshit.

Draco didn’t want strength, he wanted to be heading towards the green clad table. He wanted his reputation to be intact and the power that went along with his name and house.
“You truly are a terrifying thing, aren’t you?” He asked and gave Draco’s arm a small poke, “I mean, are you even
I hope you guys liked Future day. I like to think Merlin (from Merlin) would deadass create a whole wizarding holiday so that when Arthur rose from the dead there would be a bunch of sorcerers there to greet him lmao. It just feels like such a petty move on his part "Hey, you didn't legalize magic so I made a holiday where a bunch of sorcerers party hard in your name"
Draco stared. Sirius stared back.
“If you want to, sure. Just remember that you panic when he panics,” Lily said and entered the room to throw a bag on the floor before disappearing again. Sirius scowled.
“I cannot believe-” She choked out, the shock of her words rendering her silent. She pinched the bridge of her nose. As expected, picking Harry up from the Dursleys had been a nightmare. Dudley had been tricked into eating a handful of cursed candy (Draco had to admit, that was genius on the twins’ part) and Arthur had destroyed their living room. Nevertheless, the Weasleys didn’t have all the fun. Draco had gloriously socked Vernon Dursley in the face.
She was most certainly not allowed to die. If she did then not only was Draco going to be pissed, but Andromeda, Ted, and Remus were going to be so heartbroken and - fuck. She had a baby now. Giving a frustrated hiss through his teeth he climbed up a pile of rubble to try and -
“This hobo lion killed the king and told his son that it was his fault!” Draco said, already heating up at the memory, “So now this baby lion thinks he murdered his own father and Professor Burbage said this movie is supposed to be for muggle children. It is
“What are you doing?” Harry asked suspiciously as Draco went to drop some more pearl dust in. “That’s too much.” He said. Draco stared. Hermione was right. That damn book of his was
“I’m still not seeing why your family chose these names.”
“You’re blushing.” Harry informed him brightly, cutting off Draco’s thoughts completely.
Fenrir growled again.
“Graham Montague,” Pansy scowled, leaning back in her chair, “You are beginning to sound like our resident bloodtraitor,” she grumbled, pressing a finger to her temple, “I -
“Boggarts are something you’re going to come across eventually. You have to know how to deal with them.” He said softly. Draco closed his eyes. “Maybe we can work on it outside of class-”
McGonagall did, but not the point. They could argue over the logistics later. Draco bit lightly at her robes, pulling her towards the table. A few kids followed until Draco
“Oh, she’s beautiful!” He said and held out his finger. Harriet nudged him slightly before giving what Draco could only describe as an open mouthed smile. “Harriet?” He asked with a tilt of his head. Draco nodded solemnly.
Draco laughed.
“Your face is unfortunate.” Draco shot back, reaching back to make sure Ron was still safely behind him with his injured leg. Black outright laughed.
you?” Harry demanded and Draco felt his entire face flush.
“Movies?”
“Draco… please, please don’t do this-”
"Yeah, yeah. Just worry about not dying!" He called back and disapparated before he could get a response. There was a pop as Draco entered what looked to be a very small, poor dungeon. From beside him, there was a clatter along with a sharp yelp of alarm.
He hoped she was coping okay with all of this. As it was, he wouldn't be keeping her much longer. Draco would be passing her to a... friend soon enough.
Satisfied that his dismay on the situation shone through, he managed to get up only to be pushed back down by a rather exasperated Harry.
Then, because he was hated by his friends,
“I’m sorry, ” Moody scoffed, ”Are we not going to address the obvious here? The boy was taken by Bellatrix Lestrange and we only knew he was even alive because of Severus. Now, we’re just going to trust him?” He asked.
“Only Hermione,” he said and the girl in question scowled.
“So you haven’t even done it.”
“Ah,” he finally said, stomach sinking. Harry gave a slow intake as his own eyes fixated on the mirror, “It works for you too?” He asked, which was a stupid question, really. The Gryffindors were rubbing off on him.
Draco didn’t think he had ever seen Harry panic like this before. Overwhelmed? Angry? Upset? Frustrated? Yes. Never panicked though. Harry didn’t panic. Not like this. Then again… maybe this is why Dumbledore kept silent. Trauma simply happened to Harry and he was forced to continue in spite of it. Draco didn’t think anyone properly prepared him for any of the bad stuff that happened. It was a sucky reason to keep secrets from someone, but nevertheless… It was a reason. Either that or he didn’t want to risk putting Harry in a potentially gray scenario when the Chosen One should simply be operating in the black and white.
“Very well,” she said and tossed her hair over her shoulder, “Is that all you need from me?” She asked. Her eyes were flicking to Andromeda with her jaw clenching slightly. Draco could only offer an apologetic smile in return.
“I’m a parselmouth?” Harry interrupted, effectively ending the argument. Draco ran a hand over his face.
Draco dragged Ginny to the side, hoping that Harry had a better plan than he did. Two against one, right? They could take down a massive snake that killed people by looking them in the eyes like freaking Medusa.
“You did?!” Ron gasped, “Right in front of the blonde git king himself? Brilliant!”
“No. No, you didn’t. That doesn’t mean what you think it does.” Draco told him. “Normally, I find your obliviousness endearing, but this one is stressing me out. Not that you can’t have a threesome. That’s all you, but…” He held up his hands, “Maybe head to the library for that one.” He said.
“Careful, Potter.” Pansy said and leaned forward, “Don’t want to summon the scary dementors here, do we?” She whispered and wiggled her fingers tauntingly.
“I wouldn’t watch the beginning of that one,” Draco informed him stoically, “The ending is cute with your parents meeting you and all… but the first part is
"Oh, what an event you're making this out to be," he said, flicking his wand so that Rabastan shuddered still, "Betraying me. Trying to take out my Death Eaters." He said and turned back towards him. From the corner of his eyes, Draco could see his father move towards him, but someone whispered a spell that made him go still. "I'll find a way to make us even, Draco. Don't worry." Voldemort whispered.
“Why not?”
“Yes,” Hermione shot back hotly, “Imagine a poor muggleborn trying to escape a family wanting to burn them alive, only to be chased away by a murderous beast-”
"Draco -
“He probably would if I could ever fall asleep with all your snoring,” Draco shot and Harry slapped a hand over his heart.
“Part of being disowned means you learn to live on a budget,” Andromeda informed him flatly. Draco turned, gaping a bit as he stared back at Ron and Hermione in horror. Hermione was watching Vernon with an air concern, while Molly Weasley rushed over to greet her son and say something to Harry and his increasingly panicked uncle.
“It’s a holiday,” Ron said before Draco could explain, “Mainly a pureblood one, but I’m sure others have converted as well-”
be productive.” She finished. Harry flushed slightly, a protest on his lips, which ended when Ron clapped a hand on his shoulder. Strangely enough, that was all Ron offered before going back to his food. Draco waited for him to try and drag Harry into another scheme, but nothing… Harry gave him a curious look before shrugging it off. Yeah. Ron was probably just tired.
"Hm," Draco said and tugged him over towards the wooden fold-out chairs. His hair was already messed up. Granted, that was mainly Sirius' fault for ruffling it as they left the Great Hall, but still, "Yeah, I'm pretty sure my mother told... everyone." Draco said and Harry fell into an empty seat beside him, "Andi says we are not allowed to name him Albus."
Hagrid wailed.
“Anyone with two eyes and a few brain cells knows nothing is going on between Potter and Hermione,” Tristam said, picking up a piece of bread to butter, “Love potion. As if.” He snorted and threw an arm over Draco’s shoulders, “Unfortunately, Malfoy here has reason for concern. I heard she’s been getting hate mail, hasn’t she?” He asked. Draco gave a small nod. He hadn’t known whether to reveal that or not… Pansy might revel in the fact people were sending Hermione such wicked letters over Skeeter’s article proclaiming Hermione’s ‘devious’ intentions getting Krum (and Harry apparently) to like her.
"To the muggle studies room," Draco grumbled, "You were not invited-"
Whatever Ron was about to say was cut off. Draco frowned, following as Hermione gave a small gasp of horror. Draco sighed. Was he going to have to kill another spider? Ron was a baby around them, but Harry also never volunteered to kill the damn things when they came about. He had hoped Hermione might be -
"DRACO MALFOY YOU SIT BACK DOWN THIS INSTANT!" Hermione choked and Draco grinned at her.
Filled with something set between annoyance and exasperation, he joined the others in the locker rooms only to find the group whispering. Wood was arguing quietly with McGonagall, who was repeatedly shaking her head with her jaw set into a firm line. Frowning, he walked over to Harry.
“No,” He said quietly “But I-” He swallowed and shook his head “I’m confused.”
“That was your dad?” He asked, staring at the door with his head tilted.
Nevermind.
“…father?” He called hesitantly and Lucius froze.
“I don’t think your aunt and uncle are going to let them,” the healer told him and patted his knee, “They are all rather keen to see you.” She added. “I’m sure they’ll be wanting to hear how you escaped those Death Eaters too.” She said. “You’re going to be popular at school this year.”
And yet, Draco found himself more willing to protect the students than anything else. It wasn’t fair. Hogwarts was supposed to remain safe. How could he, in good conscience, put their lives as risk? Or what of the first and second years? Assuming they won this war and everyone lived… their memories of the school would be forever tainted.
“I know when mine is,” he grumbled, “Today. Possibly in ten minutes.”
Nymphadora was waiting for him this time.
“Is that a challenge?” She asked and looked around, “WHICH ONE OF YOU IS THEODORE NOTT?”
“No? You want to test that theory?” He asked and for good measure pressed the tip of the knife in, edging the magic inside to freeze his blood. McLaggen shivered before stepping back. “You have three seconds. Three… two-”
Draco still supported Sirius on his endeavor to keep Harry from getting himself killed though. Maybe Draco would tell him about their first and second years at Hogwarts… just so he had a baseline for their levels of foolishness. He would love for Remus to be there too, actually. ‘Oh, you’re upset Harry was reckless enough to keep the Marauders' map last year? Well, we tried to steal a magical stone from Voldemort when we were eleven so that’s nothing’.
“No, because I found you.” Theo said sharply, “What were you even thinking?” He added and Draco reached out to quiet him. “Do you have any idea-”
"- I notice many things, Mr. Malfoy. Many things. I am a man of skill. A man of patience. A man of focus," Sirius continued to read, "I am proud to say I knew the very second that Lily and James met that I knew they would marry. I have seen a similar spark between you and my godson. Yes. Yes, I am Harry Potter's godfather-"
“So was it mutual or what?” He asked and Draco groaned. He kind of thought he had lucked out with being disowned sometimes. It saved him from more conversations just like this – though with less homophobia.
toy broom!" Andi said indignantly from Sirius' arms, "See? I'm not Teddy!" She added to him. Sirius put a hand over his chest in apology before placing her down. She wasted no time stealing Victoire from Teddy with a promise to braid her hair. Remus gave his son a sympathetic look before turning to give Draco accusing eyes. What? It wasn't his fault his daughter was the more charming of the bunch.
. “And… did nobody else know? Did you just tell
Dora. Andromeda. Hermione. Ron.
“Mature.” Hermione said, but she was smiling as they went back to the common room. “Hey, before you go up to study we…” She began and trailed off as she looked at the other two. Harry blinked a few times before making a small ‘o’ with his mouth and then sprinting off to the dormitory.
“You’re okay with me doing this then?” he asked, unsure if he should hold the knives closer or further away. “I… didn’t think about the fact I would need to know dark magic.” He admitted. It felt so obvious. How could he try to join the Death Eaters if he didn’t know the type of magic they practiced? Andromeda smiled tightly.
“I thought we were supposed to do this class individually?” He frowned. Harry eyed Slughorn warily as he crushed the moonstone into fine dust.
“Was that any better?” Harry laughed. Draco shoved him away, though he was admittedly laughing too. “Come on, didn’t your pureblood upbringing better prepare you for this?” He asked and shoved him back.
Andromeda laughed.
“I -” He began and then fell silent as he took a step back, “Are those… my robes?” He asked. Draco looked down. Oh. Uh. He glanced back up at where Harry was evaluating Draco’s outfit choice with a raised eyebrow.
She practically screeched and threw down the hat altogether, “Besides, you get flustered when Harry gets close to you!” She told him, pointing a finger at his nose. “You get all red and nervous and sound like a complete idiot!”
He said, throwing up his arms. Harry watched, brows creased as Draco continued to ramble.
Ron didn’t really think it through though. Rumor had it that they made out during detention so… that backfired. Harry at least made it up to him by apologizing a million times and buying him a solid three pounds of chocolate.
"It wasn't a talk because I got a goddamn sex
“Shouldn’t you be offering help to your housemates?” Pansy jumped in. Draco paused. Montague he had expected to take advantage of his fall from grace, but… Pansy and him had been friends for years. He stared at her, momentarily too stunned to respond. “We wouldn’t want to accept anything from filthy blood traitors like you and Weasley over there,” she sneered.
“What did Malfoy do?” Weasley muttered from the other side from him.
“What was it you called Pansy?” Hermione asked when they finally situated Ron with a bucket and some pats on the back. “I’ve heard of a 'mudblood', but…” She fixed him with a baffled look, lips pressed into a line that was ready to turn into a disappointed frown at any moment.
“Are you okay?” She whispered. Draco nodded. “You… you’re crying.” She told him cautiously. Draco gave a small laugh as he wiped a few wayward tears away.
“I am not!”
Still, he didn’t want to discuss his love life with anybody in this room. He turned away. Nope. Not today.
“Hi.” She said softly and her smile was nothing but warmth. Draco felt as though he could drown in it. The clock rang above them and the smile immediately disappeared into one of dismay. “We need to talk.” She sighed, lowering her hand. Draco frowned.
“I knew a pureblood such as yourself wouldn’t have any trouble with Dumbledore,” Draco continued, walking closer. Montague looked vaguely shocked at the mere idea he had done anything at all, but it was quickly covered up with a smug smile when he heard the other Death Eaters rushing to join them. “Go ahead. Kill him.” Draco offered.
Throwing one last glare over his shoulder, he marched to where the others were drying off. Hermione seemed baffled at how she had gotten wet at all. Had they even explained to her what was happening? He hated this damn school.
Draco nodded.
metal teeth of death (Harry called them zippers, but Draco would only refer to them as 'unnecessary muggle teeth'). Still, muggles always seemed to throw new things into their fashion every so often that Draco could never figure out, "Wouldn't Death Eaters be more likely to attack muggles given that... you know, they're
Him. Desperate enough that he would turn against his friends? Anger thrummed through him as he slammed the door open, ignoring Sirius’ calls after him. He pushed past the house, hoping nobody noticed his eyes glazing over as he tried to make his way up to one of the spare bedrooms.
“Maybe, but a bit more than that. Most of my friends annoy me. He doesn’t.” Draco explained. Harry made a face at him, “Like, he’s so
"Draco Lucius Malfoy," Sirius read out. Fuck it. They were doing this now, "I have been waiting for this day for many years now. I write this from a dirty cave on a cold spring night," he said. Draco sat down, petting another bird by him. This was going to take awhile, "We haven't met. My name is Sirius Black. We our cousins, dear Draco. At this point in time, I don't know if we will be acquainted. I see you from distance. I have recently escaped from Azkaban and notice you have been sorted into Gryffindor-"
"You said you have personal experience," Harry asked him curiously, "What happened?" He asked. As open as Sirius was about... well, most things in the world, Harry realized that he didn't really know much about some of the more personal details of Sirius' life. Most relationships mentioned were just briefly labeled as some person he may have dated or hung out with no names attached. Hell, Harry didn't even know Sirius
to him? He broke. He fucking broke and it was too much to put himself back together. Was any of this even real? Maybe it was part of the Bellatrix's torture. Maybe he never left the manor. Maybe this was a game. He honest to God wasn't sure which would be worse - having this be real or having this be all an illusion.
“Wait,” Draco interrupted when Hermione opened her mouth in outrage, “It kills things? Muggles made something with the sole intention of it just...killing?” He frowned and tilted his head, “Surely, it must do other things.”
“It doesn’t bother you?” She asked, tilting her head. Draco shook his head.
“Yes,” Draco said and crossed the floor to look around, “Fuck, Ted. What happened?” He asked. Ted grimaced, “Nevermind. It doesn’t matter. We need to find a way to get you out of here.” He muttered, feeling panic rise. Draco had been looking for ways to break out of the cells. He wasn’t prepared to break anyone out of Cassi’s room.
that’s really important for me to know because if Voldemort finds out then we’re screwed.” He reasoned, “The thing is… I… think
"Oh, sure," Harry muttered sarcastically, "I'm shivering with anticipation."
you call her that? I've never known you to use that word."
"What do you want?" Harry finally asked. Draco shifted slightly in his sleep. Absently, he reached out and grabbed his hand, letting his thumb trail over his palm as he waited for Theo to get on with it.
“Ron and Harry told me a very different version of this,” she finally said. Draco tilted his head at her, “Theirs involved much less Theodore Nott,” she added as an explanation. Oh. Right. Draco’s retelling might have gotten a little sidetracked.
While they continued to get on quite well, Draco couldn’t say the same with his other classmates. Hermione was often fond of correcting everyone in hopes it would make her more well liked… It did not. Which, in turn, led to Draco coming to her defense more and more often.
“I would be
. Not after Theo...
"I like your robes, professor!" He said, "They're very black."
“...she’s interesting.” Harry said when Luna left to wander up and down the train for a while. He looked deeply disturbed, which… was probably a fair reaction upon meeting Luna. Draco shrugged, leaning back in the seat to think for a moment. “Hey.” Harry said and tapped his leg.
"I barely let you get away with that," Draco grumbled with a sigh, "And I think you made her to pretend to like it. Andromeda Rebeus." He shook his head, "I guess it isn't as terrible as some of your other suggestions," he admitted, inwardly smiling at the memory of Severus' face when Harry barked up
As it turned out, him and Fleur were a better duo than he thought. While obviously beautiful, she was actually pretty polite all things considered. Draco would have thought she would be annoyed by people crawling all over her by now. Harry had mentioned she had annoyed him earlier by being condescending during the beginning of the tournament, but honestly Draco was pretty sure she just was a blunt person. That and English wasn’t her first language. It was hard to be tactful when you were trying to keep up with what you were saying half the time.
He wasn’t sure why… but he felt like he did. Longbottom stared back at him before giving a small nod. Draco waited.
Harry cleared his throat.
So what did he do?
“Maybe,” he said slowly, “It… is really confusing and I still don’t get some things, but it’s interesting.” He admitted and fell back in his chair, “It makes it easier to talk to Ted and Hermione.” He said. Theo nodded.
"Umbridge is using a blood quill on Harry," he said and the smile disappeared from Andromeda's face. Sirius also froze - going so still that Draco felt as though he better get the rest of it out fairly quickly, "He didn't want us to tell anybody." He explained and went on to tell them both the reasons why nobody had said anything and what exactly Umbridge had been doing to Harry during all those detentions.
a romantic statement to open with. Harry pulled back in alarm. “What I avoided telling her was that I’m pretty sure I’ve known I would end up liking you since we were eleven.”
“Please don’t,” Draco whispered.
"What," Voldemort said slowly as he turned to look at where several of his Death Eaters were now falling to the ground, "Is this?" He asked. Bellatrix fell next to Rodolphus, whispering spells over him as he began to convulse. Draco grimaced. She could maybe save a few of them, but certainly not all. From his place behind Voldemort, Pettigrew made a squealing sound in alarm before also kneeling down to help. Draco didn't really think he would get very far.
"IT IS TRUE!" Harry exploded, going full-volume, "And you... you are so goddamn desperate... you would turn against everyone who actually does care about you for them. It's disgusting."
“Not enough time,” Draco sighed as the paper began to smoke, “It’s about to burst as it is. I thought McGonagall wasn’t going to tell Andromeda!” He groaned. What the Hell? He had convinced her (after shameless begging) to just confide in Severus since he was technically Draco’s - wait a damn minute.
“Yeah, and not asking me is a bad idea too.”
,” Draco told him, “It was stupid of you to just take a bloody walk with Viktor Krum in the middle of the night-”
"You know about Amelia Bones, right?" He asked. Harry froze before nodding. "And you know there... there were other things I did?" He asked. Harry nodded again. "And that there were other things I really, really, really messed up on?" He asked. He hadn't said anything about that. Not about that. Not to anyone. Still, Harry nodded all the same. Draco stared at him. "I don't get it."
“Draco Malfoy.”
Harry closed his eyes. Draco waited for a response, but Harry didn’t seem interested in giving one. Hesitantly, he reached out and grabbed one of his hands. Harry didn’t back away.
“I was
"Well, she started saying things she liked about me. I figured I should say stuff back," he began and Draco shrugged. Yeah, that was a good deduction, "Except, I mean... I said she was the smartest person that I've ever met and she kind of paused," he said and Draco bit his tongue, "Then I said I liked her eyes and it was good again... then I said other things like her laugh and stuff. That was good too," he reasoned, still looking baffled, "I figured since those were safe I would keep going, but then she got
this!”
“Well,” Hermione said hesitantly, “Maybe we can spend time together at Hogsmeade sometime.” She suggested and Zoe beamed.
Obviously. Still, Draco appreciated Ron voicing it.
"What? The poor girl is failing," Draco snorted and leaned back on Harry's desk at the front of the classroom, "Honestly, the whole 'mystery' behind it is kind of poppycock. We weren't even technically 'missing' for that year," he added with air quotes. A few people hurriedly reached for parchment in an attempt to start writing, "We were eighteen and went back for our final year at Hogwarts since we kind of missed it with the war or whatever," he said, waving the words away, "And it was like... three in the morning, I think-"
“A knife must come out of it,” Draco said, though he failed to see how a knife popping out of the hole would be much different than just a normal knife. That was really the only way he could think of metal shooting out of it though. “I don’t remember learning about it muggle studies…” he mused. Ron opened his mouth to respond, but it was at that moment a knock sounded.
“Let’s do this!” Sirius yelled and both marched into the fire with their respective floo powders and disappeared in a burst of green flames. Lily watched them, looking nonplussed as she continued rubbing her stomach. She glanced down.
or never again,” he told him. Draco didn’t bother saying he was spewing rubbish. It felt like a well-known fact at this point.
“Likes who? Don’t tell me it’s bloody Pansy-”
“Ew. Like the kissing way?” He asked, wrinkling his nose. “I thought you were only supposed to like girls that way?”
He had a point.
“Sprout, hm? She is pretty fit.” He said as Harry gagged, “But you’re not going to be dousing anything with love potion because I have a trump card,” He sang and leaned forward with a vicious gleam in his eye “I bet Andromeda doesn’t know about certain aspects of the World Cup with your little boyfriend, does she?” He tsked and Draco froze.
“Oh, yeah?” Draco said, voice rising slightly, “Well, I’ve seen
“...no…no, wait…” he murmured and Draco frowned. “Stop. Stop -
was. Actually, Draco had plenty of material to work with now, "Look at your hair!" He said and then gestured to... well. Harry wore muggle clothes quite nicely when they fit him. Shame.
"Alright," Harry interrupted loudly, "We got it from here. Thanks, Ron. We, er, won't... break up." He said with a subtle shrug. Draco returned it. Yeah, he had  no complaints there.
His godfather would not die over this
aka always pure) was now
of his house by any means, but if he was here, he might as well try to make a respectable lot out of them. Maybe he would ask McGonagall if he could still be on the quidditch team… or just join next season. He had ended up refusing her original offer in hopes to not form any attachments to someplace he had hoped to be in temporarily, but… If he was going to be disowned, then it didn’t really matter if he lost all sense of propriety, right?
Only sleep didn’t come easily. Not with so much to consider resting at the back of his mind. Rolling over, he grabbed the red quill hidden underneath his robes and a piece of parchment.
ally. Turns out, some of the worst people in the muggle world weren't even locked up. It was bewildering, but worked out well enough for Draco.
The group continued to murmur. Harry shifted a bit in discomfort.
"Fine, move over then."
” she began as Draco drifted away to look at something more interesting than the stacks of books they were supposed to be buying. Honestly, it was ridiculous that whoever their new defense teacher was had them buying solely
“Hold that thought," Draco finally said, "I need to clarify a few things.”
“Sorry, I should have been clearer. You’re an idiot,” he rectified and Ron rolled his eyes, “But you’re also one of the best strategists I’ve ever met. Incredibly lazy maybe, but still more practical than… two people whose names both start with H and I will deny saying that if you tell them.” He said, pointing at Ron’s nose. “Especially when it comes to the wizarding world. You’ve got to give yourself more credit.”
that had been her. Evil. Maybe he would retaliate by putting spiders in her hair. The thought made him smile a little. It was only after thirty minutes that Hagrid had come with Harry in tow that everyone calmed down.
“To… what?”
“Watch your tone.” Severus said, but something Draco said struck a chord. He could see it. Severus had somehow gone paler - fingers twitching slightly.
“What are you doing?” Draco called and grabbed his arm, “Tell me you’re going to help Harry and Hermione and not go after an innocent man.” He said and shook his head. He had been suspicious about Severus’ treatment towards Harry for awhile now, but really the events of this year solidified it. “You wouldn’t. Not over something that happened years ago. James Potter is
Ooh. Harry bit his lip.
… well, his parents would have to take him, wouldn’t they? He would not only reclaim his name, but honor it. Even his father couldn’t claim to have been of service to the Dark Lord at a mere eleven-years-old…
"Hey."
“Draco.” Andromeda called, voice gentle. Petunia looked downright gray - eyes wide and mouth slightly open. Giving her one last dark look, he turned away. Damn bloody
“Well?” Draco finally asked, “How was it?”
. I am a hardened Death Eater and spy, thank-you-very-much."
“Well, yeah, but aren’t more, er, mudbloods are next?” Harry said, cringing slightly at the word… God they were awful at this. Draco probably needed to cut in before someone realized that Crabbe and Goyle were simultaneously both smarter and stupider at once.
“I’m not kidding, Draco,” Tonks said, “You
"Glasses!" Cassi agreed, "You would think they would have something for that, wouldn't they? Eyesight spells aren't a thing yet?"
Not this again.
“As soon as the release papers are signed,” the healer told him, clapping his knee. Draco nodded. Good. He looked around his small area of St. Mungo’s. He wasn’t sure how long he had been there. The last thing he remembered clearly was Bellatrix whispering to him as Donovan chanted a spell under his breath. Then he woke up in the middle of London.
"Moony," Sirius called (now back in human form), "I found him!" he said and lifted up Andi who gasped.

. They were at the end of the race, right? The precipice of freedom. Of winning the war. Hermione was here and he should help her. And Ron and Tristam and Zoe and Neville and... and...
“Recovering.” He grumbled. Ron blinked. Harriet had (as per usual) been with Draco when he was taken. It had been a huge relief when he had finally gotten some time alone and she had slipped out of his sleeve. He hadn't been completely alone. “She… protected me when I slept a lot. Sometimes other Death Eaters would try to sneak up and attack me to gauge my reaction times. She did a good job biting them when they came too close. Eventually they struck back.” He explained.
“Not as friends,” he said with a nod “Um. I can meet you in the Great Hall at nine on Saturday?” He offered and Draco nodded, beaming up at him. “Great. I’ll see you then.” He said, the illusion of confidence starting to build up again. Draco laughed as he left, turning back to see Harry gaping.
“Aw, thanks-”
Damnit. He turned at Hermione’s voice, which sounded somewhere behind him as he quickly ran off towards the stairs. He waited to be sure there were no footsteps before climbing a few flights of stairs as other voices joined the chorus, calling his name. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
We won't be seeing Lucius for awhile. Thank God. That guy. Even Draco needs a break from him.
Even worse than
"So," Harry said with a nod, "Technically, we've been dealing with their shit much longer then they've been dealing with ours. That makes us the winners in this scenario, right?" He asked. Draco grinned.
“Than
“You almost made me look like the biggest idiot, Harry Potter,” Draco said, jutting a finger into his chest, “You know, we have weekly quotas of muggles to kill," he said and Harry flinched a bit, "And for the most part I'm pretty good at finding scum of the Earth to help my numbers, but last week I was a little lax," he admitted. Harry raised an eyebrow.
"You just said you hated her."
” Sadie grumbled and then looked Draco over, “Are you
“Because we don’t even have dates yet!” Ron groaned and flopped on his bed. Draco really wondered how he got stuck with these two as his friends.
"Have I -? No! Why are you looking for Theo?" He asked, shaking his head. Everyone was apparently looking for Theo. Blaise groaned, running a hand over his face before shoving a piece of parchment in his hand. Hurriedly, Draco unfolded it to see a neatly printed words sprawled on the parchment.
"I hope not," he said, "I haven't talked to anyone in three days. I'm going to relish this for the rest of the week."
“Dumbledore doesn’t exactly… know…” Draco said and both stared at him. “I don’t want him involved in this. I know he’s going to find out anyways, but the last thing I want is him trying to manipulate anything else. I need to be the puppet master for once.” Draco said, “If I don’t know everything that’s going on then I can’t control everything.” He explained and hesitated, “Is that a deal breaker?”
From somewhere outside, he heard a creak.
“Yes. I need new robes already,” he laughed nervously, “Is mother with you?” He asked, peering around. Lucius shook his head.
“Oh, shut up. It’s always you.” He muttered and dodged a swipe from Harry. McGonagall surprisingly didn’t scold them. She looked too worried with her jaw clenched and shoulders somehow more tense than normal. “I - oh, good. Mr. Weasley,” She greeted when Percy came into the room with Ron behind him. “Good, good. Let’s go.” She said, flicking her hand for them to follow.
"Harry?" He asked and tried to gauge where he was. They were outside. He could feel the sun trickling against his face, blinding him slightly as he started to make out a tree and - right. They had been studying. Draco must have fallen asleep. He turned to see Harry a few feet away. He looked somewhere between concerned and nervous. "I'm fine." Draco muttered and sat up, "You... you don't have to be over there." He said.
expression of his friend before.
"Is living like this not an act of valor?" He asked. Snape handed over the sword to him with a grimace to give his thoughts on the matter. Harry took off the locket and threw it on the ground, raising the tip of the sword to plunge down into the locket. Nothing happened. "Shit." He muttered and then paused when Snape brought out a bag and dumped it on the ground. Harry frowned and knelt down, looking inside to find...basilisk fangs? He looked up in wonder.
Not that everyone approved.
“Really? You’d admit that a very successful king was related to Gryffindor?”
"...this is going to take forever, isn't it?"
“I don’t really have time to grow old right now,” Draco told him wryly and walked forward to grab the wand. Dumbledore’s grip tightened for a moment before meeting his eyes. There was a hint of understanding beginning to bubble underneath before giving way to resignation. His fingers slowly loosened. Draco looked down. It didn’t look particularly foreboding. Just… a wand. Nothing to warrant it being any more significant than his own. He turned to stare Severus down.
“I am a pureblood child of a Death Eater. The nephew of one of the most famous Death Eaters ever. The godson of one of Voldemort’s favorites. Harry, I was
"Just the snake," he said and Draco raised an eyebrow, "I'm taking care of the seventh horcrux." He promised and let his hands fall so he could grab Draco's hands and kiss those instead. Why was he being so affectionate right now? He wasn't usually this touchy. The nagging feeling in the back of his head was sending up all sorts of warning signals, but Draco couldn't figure out how to best vocalize his concern.
"We can't let them die!" Harry shot back, "They're the reason Draco got into this fucking mess! He can't have gone through all of this just to have them die!" He said, voice shaking a bit towards the end. It would break his heart. Harry couldn't let that happen. He couldn't. It wasn't fair after everything they put him through that they - how
“And who is that one baby going to be?”
“...Draco?”
"Hey," Draco said before they went to walked inside, "Are you sure you should be going with us?" He asked Zoe, looking pointedly at her non-golden appearance. Her eyes narrowed, "This is a rescue mission. If there's a bunch of wayward curses you
Harry was hearing voices. The Heir of
“Curfew was an hour ago,” Severus greeted and Draco shut the door with a loud clang before flicking up wards and silencing charms around them, “What’s wrong?” He asked sharply and Draco pulled up a chair to sit.
"I won't hurt anyone I care about," Draco said without a beat of hesitation. Severus sighed, "I can figure out how to keep myself in good standing without that. I'll learn this," he added with a vague gesture to the ghostly figure in front of him, "Because I shouldn't limit my options or capabilities, but... I will do this my way. I will." He said firmly. Severus said nothing, but there was a twitch of his lips before he finally nodded. Good. They understood one another.
.” He hissed, gripping at his thigh when Draco tapped his wand on his shin.
"I think the snake is one too. I've been having dreams..." Harry trailed off, possibly under the weight of Severus' look at him. Draco frowned. Why was he looking at him like that? "So, we're close. There are just two." He said. Severus didn't respond at first.
“I knew you were useless. Didn’t I say he was useless?” He continued, pushing the thought away to look at Ron who nodded. “Okay, so in that case we can use him as bait-”
Besides them, Hermione and Viktor were also talking - though it wasn’t really a discussion as much as Hermione and Krum both repeating her name with varying degrees of success.
like an adult... but he wasn't actually willing to potentially tick the man off right now. It was a bit easy to forget that Sirius was actually a very powerful wizard who survived an abusive family, war, and Azkaban sometimes. Draco felt a little guilty remembering that now... how frustrating would it be to go through so much only to find yourself helpless to protecting your dead best friends' kid because you were confined to a house and not told basic things?
going to leave this house," Sirius said, voice tight and very clearly upset, "Because that... would be an overreaction and dangerous... and I guess that - even though I am the adult here - that some people feel the need to withhold information from me because I'm not to be trusted to behave reasonably." He said slowly and in a tone that had Draco slightly inching away from him.
is me offering to help you anyways.” He said. Pansy’s mouth popped open - he could see the retort about to leave her lips before her brain caught up with her. Silence fell between them. “There’s a place you can go. Someplace safe during the war. It’s where I sent Theo.” He tacked on. Pansy jerked back.
Normally, anyone who knew the basics of Harry would just shrug and say he had no parents to understand Draco's side of things and call it a day.
“No, I don’t!”
"Any other questions?" She asked and Derek pouted before going back to his book. Andromeda shook her head, "What are you three doing here? I thought you were hunting horcruxes," she said, tapping her wand to their clothes so that they cleaned themselves with a zip.
“I haven’t!” Draco complained as Hermione giggled beside him. Tonks raised an eyebrow at him. She did look rather ridiculous with her fish eyes and snout. “Stop doing that,” he grumbled and glanced around the shop. “People are
“Really,” He said and grimaced at the rows of books. “This is not how I thought I would be spending my Saturday.” He grumbled and then lightly nudged Draco, “But Hermione would be thrilled, wouldn’t she?” He asked. Draco gave a weak smile in return.
Harry asked, suddenly grabbing his arms so Draco would meet his eyes. “If we’re going to be in danger why can’t we at least do it together? We’ve always done it together,” He pointed out. “The stone, the basilisk, Sirius - we all managed to get out okay when it was all of us.” Harry said. Draco swallowed, “But the tournament? The graveyard? That’s when people started getting hurt. If I had been with you when you followed Bellatrix-”
Draco stared.
“Yeah,” Tristam agreed, whirling his pencil around his fingers, “Neville is cute and all, but… okay, don’t take this wrong way, but he’s
“Anyone ever told you that you’re a git?” Came the grumbled response. Before Draco could answer with a question of his own, furious sounding footsteps found them. McGonagall walked in, hand over her heart, along with several other professors, whose expressions ranged from alarmed to merely bored.
Yeah, Draco thought the DA was disbanded too. Apparently not.
"You have to say ‘I spy with my little eye,’" Harry interrupted, completely serious. There was still a bit of humor in his eyes as Draco stared back at him with an equal amount of stoicism. "Then you describe the thing." He added. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Right," Ron said as if they hadn't just witnessed some sort of weird foreplay, "Um, does this look alright?" He asked and Hermione opened her mouth, "I mean, does it look muggle-ish?" He rectified quickly. By Godric, help them.
“AND AS FOR YOU!” Andromeda shrieked, spinning around to where the others were. Ron dropped his drumstick in alarm, “NEED I REMIND YOU THAT MOLLY AND I ARE IN CONTACT?! IF I FIND OUT YOU DRAGGED HIM ON ANOTHER ILL-ADVISED ADVENTURE THEN YOU CAN EXPECT MORE THAN A HOWLER FROM HER!”
“Any advice?”
She was going to
“Fine,” Draco said as Hermione stirred the potion a few times, “But I get to be Montague. Crabbe and Goyle don’t talk much, so it’s better if you two go as them,” he reasoned and turned to Hermione, “You can’t go as Pansy if we think it’s her-”
"Draco," she said seriously, "I know him very well. I thought it was weird he would teach in general, but... there is something wrong with him. I'm going to the ministry to get back-up, okay? Just make sure nobody goes anywhere alone with him." She said. Draco frowned. What? "I'm serious," she said when he opened his mouth.
. Maybe Harry would understand.
From behind them, a small whimpering sound came. Draco jumped. He hadn’t realized something else was in the room. He turned to see Padfoot lifting his head up before moving to nudge the woman’s hand with his snout. The woman hummed and shifted slightly.
The good news? They were close enough to Hogwarts that they could probably fly there in a couple minutes. The bad news? Death Eaters.
Harry did so well that he won the Felix Felicis.
Ron choked out. Harry didn't look up. Despite the fact they could all hear Hermione's screams, none had reacted as strongly as Ron. He called her name constantly with screams of his own before yanking uselessly against the chains. At some point, he managed to get free and tried to disapparate. Harry had tried a few times too and when they failed Ron ended up pounding against the wall with helpless sobs.
“I don’t think Kreacher is a reliable source, Harry,” he said and ran his hand through his hair, “We need another plan in case this is a trap.” He tried and turned to Hermione who was nodding.
“You’re one of the smartest people I know,” he said and Draco looked up. “And the only reason I’m passing potions.” He added. Draco gave him a small smile. “And learning to lie to your friends is the hardest. They hardly count.” He shook his head. “You’ve only just started.”
Draco was pretty sure it was a joke. Voldemort had gotten oddly fond of him since he murdered Dumbledore. Not to say that ensured his safety in any way, shape, or form. It just allowed him to be a little more… argumentative at times. Also, Voldemort never publicly punished him, which was actually kind of nice…
"I can sneak back there and talk to Minerva and Severus. Maybe Remus can help me move the Order there," Theo said slowly and put a finger to his lip in deep thought, "It is also where we can keep whoever decides to pop in from the other countries." He added. Harry grinned. Theo would have to talk this all over with Hermione to make sure it was actually a viable plan, but... it felt promising. Like they finally had an upper-hand. Theo hit his knee with an almost frantic, yet relieved laugh. "We have a chance." He breathed out.
"I don't-"
"Draco-"
The wind continued to blow.
"Don't you dare try that shit with me," Theo said darkly, "My parents are Death Eaters. You don't think I know when someone is in my head?" He asked and pushed Draco away, "I'm not going to stand by and let you get killed for trying to play hero." He said in disgust. Draco swallowed. "Maybe you're right that the ministry won't take it seriously, but I can go to my parents right now and tell them everything. They'll all know never to trust you or a word that comes out of your mouth."
“I disagree.”
“Hermione!” Draco complained “Seriously? Why would-”
said I wouldn't actually ditch school and go get married. Obviously, I couldn't let that accusation stand so we left school and got married. There. Story done." He said. A few students frowned at one another, muttering in confusion.
Draco paused.
Dumbledore most definitely had something to do with it. Honestly, the favoritism was unreal.
"Do you want to try?" Ron asked one evening as Harry picked at his food from Bill and Fleur's dining room table. He out the watch, "He's feeling anxious. Maybe you help calm him down."
“Um, yeah?” He said and lightly kicked his leg, “I don’t even fancy girls, remember?”
Draco might have pondered more on the matter, but a gold glint had caught his eye as he looked down at his notes.
name. Snatchers came."
"I know," he agreed and patted his arm, "And good luck." He said as he moved towards the door. Harry would have answered, but it was at that moment Draco shifted slightly in his sleep, regaining Harry's attention. Theo paused by the door. For a moment it looked as though he might have stayed to see Draco wake up, but then thought better of it. Harry ignored him as he sat up, moving closer.
“It was fun getting the stuff for it,” he said and pointed to another of their memories. “I highly recommend we do that one too before calling a break.” He added. Draco sighed. Something told him he was about to get made fun of again.
"Father," Theo's voice called out somewhere, "How nice of you to join!" He said, readying his wand. Draco went to aid him only to find Blaise had beaten him there with a nod at Draco to show he had it under control. Right. Good. A shot echoed through the air, sending a few people looking around in alarm. Draco glanced up and grinned. The muggles were having fun at least. Jenkins and a few American wizards had taken to setting up behind one of Hogwart's walls and popping out to shoot at the opposing side. Draco was really impressed at their aim. Death Eaters went down within seconds - if not dead then injured enough to be stunned or killed by someone on the field at least. By this point, it was brutally clear that they were winning.
Oh, okay. Nope. Wasn’t a spider. That was definitely blood… and Filch’s cat.
“A potion.”
“I thought we were remembering how stupid we used to be-”
"You - but-" Harry tried and then threw down his quill, "Has anyone considered that sometimes I need to be coddled?!" He asked, a bit desperately. Draco snorted, "Has anyone considered that?! I'm under quite a bit of stress, you know!" He added, a bit hysterically. Hermione looked him dead in the eyes before snapping her book closed and getting up. Harry gave a betrayed splutter as she made her way to where Ron had been grimacing by the entrance - clearly torn between wanting to enter and not wanting to be sucked into doing work. "Draco?" Harry asked, turning to him again.
“Please tell me someone has some pumpkin juice because I’ve just had the worst freaking day.” He said flatly. Nobody spoke. “Hey, Myrtle.” He added offhandedly to the ghost, “We killed the snake that killed you.” He added. Professor Sprout made a high-pitched noise in the back of her throat.
Not to mention he was now being a dick to Hermione. Hermione.
time he went out to get a cup of coffee. "Besides, if you don't want me to do it then maybe I should grab McGonagall..." he trailed off, letting a feral grin cross his face as Hermione flushed dark red, "By the way, do many people know about the time you called her 'mom' last year?" He asked. Hermione hit his arm.
He shouted and grabbed at his hair, “Are you sure? I thought we had two more days?!”
It appeared Dumbledore was one of them. Draco could feel the man’s eyes on him - studying him intently. He stared back with equal fortitude.
would know.” He said and Ron gave a sarcastic gesture, “Okay, you know King Arthur?”
“Why are you all acting stupid?” Draco asked, crossing his arms over his chest, “I could have told you Ron was going to be prefect our second year.” He sniffed. Puzzled eyes all fell towards him. “Come on. He’s been dealing with this sort of stuff for years now. Who had to worry about Lockhart when that tunnel collapsed? Who got us through McGonagall’s chess set? Who figured out how to do a levitation spell to knock a troll out? Who found out the first task was dragons? Who nearly lost his leg trying to keep Sirius from getting Harry?” He said with a vague wave of his hand, “Besides, if he can even exist in a family
“Potter isn’t your only enemy,” he said cautiously. Both Bellatrix and Voldemort paused. “Dumbledore. Sirius Black. Mad-Eye Moody. The Order,” he shrugged. “They all trust me.” He said. Voldemort stared.
on these people. He lost track of how many insults she had managed to slip in about other members of faculty without anyone noticing. “Well, I would hate to keep you from your studies then. Run along.” He said, giving a patronizing wave of his hand.
‘Again’ because it wasn’t the first time Draco had demanded a law change since starting Hogwarts. The first time was when they were first-years and Draco was adamantly campaigning against teaching eleven-year-olds ‘alohomora’ because he thought it was irresponsible to show them how to break into places at such a young age. Hermione was indignant about the idea of withholding knowledge, but Draco felt as though his point was proven when they managed to get that super important, very well-guarded stone as a bunch of pre-teens.
Draco Malfoy apology. I’m honored... Though you don't really need to apologize. This was mostly my fault.” He said and moved a bit closer so he could sit shoulder to shoulder with him. “So, since we’re all made up again-”
"Excuse me?" Sirius frowned, "I am taken. By
"Draco-" Neville said, grabbing his arm. Draco tore himself away.
"I... think so, yeah. You try to be, which is more than some can say." He added under his breath and Draco smiled.
“I’m sorry you got hurt,” Harry told him with a frown, “If I had realized I could hurt Quirrell sooner I would have protected you better.”
friends would most certainly be her last.
Okay… this was a little weird. He shared puzzled looks with the other two as they left the quidditch pitch back towards the castle. He debated about pressing for more information, but based on McGonagall’s expression it would be no use. About three turns later, Draco realized with a cold prickling of his skin that they were heading towards the hospital wing.
"This seems to be going well."
"You and Nymphadora are here." She said and Draco bit his lip. There was a very good chance he might get taken down a few notches if he suggested either of them leave, but he also didn't really like the idea of them someplace they
"Who?"
"Oh, are you?
“I’m not very good at making friends,” she said softly, “Never was. I want to be helpful, but…” she trailed off and Draco furrowed his brows.
Gillyweed. That… would work. Very nicely.
maybe learn to navigate every social situation imaginable. Giving one last flustered goodbye to his parents, Harry dropped the stone in Draco's hand before glowering at everyone. "...are you going to be okay?" He asked, ire draining the second Draco looked down at the stone.
“I don’t know. Draco Delacour actually has a lovely ring to it.” A voice said and Draco turned to find Theo behind him. Well then. He narrowed his eyes. Him and Theo hadn’t exactly been on speaking terms in a couple days.
The world was oddly...pastel-ish. Draco crept quietly, ears perking up as he listened to the hum of voices get a tad louder and louder with his approach. From somewhere above him, paintings seemed to shift with curious eyes and low hums. The house felt familiar to him somehow. Maybe he had been here as a child. He couldn't be sure. It certainly felt welcoming now as the magic seemed to stir at his presence, warm and inviting him to move in closer. The voices behind the oak door grew louder.
says,” he told her, keeping his voice even. Something shattered next to them. “I want to serve the Dark Lord. If my parents won’t help me… then you can.” He said and gave a wild gesture, “They forced me to live among blood traitors and mudbloods for years. Surely you won’t condemn me to such a fate.” He said. Bellatrix stopped moving altogether. For a moment, he wondered if someone had hit her with a body binding spell.
“Are you sure?” He asked. Draco grimaced. He wasn’t, but that didn’t matter. Lupin seemed to understand because he walked over to flick the lock open. The boggart shuddered for a moment before letting the door swing open.
“Deep breath. In… out…”
Sirius had decided to fully embrace his new role at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and sent him (and everyone else) various products from puking pastels to muggle magic tricks.
“That isn’t a compliment! Hermione is a muggleborn. It won’t be so flattering when people accuse you of killing her, will it?” He snapped. Oh. Right.
more suspicious of anyone with a teaching background. Plus, Moody was easy to be wary of. The man had a spinning eye and constantly drank out of a hip flask. Sure, yeah, it was supposed to keep him from getting poisoned or whatever… but it was
“...we might die.” Harry said, sounding a little surprised by this fact. Draco was about to spin around to punch him when a honk sounded. He turned just in time to see a bright light flood the forest as a blue metal… thing entered the premise.
was it trying to tell him? The hat sighed - possibly sensing Draco’s irritation.
should understand feeling protective of their things (ahem, horcruxes, maybe?) it would be Voldemort. Sure enough, the man had laughed as if Draco had said something funny and sent him new robes every week much to everyone’s shock.
He hissed and yanked it down. Lo and behold. Two idiots and a guilty Hermione sat underneath.
“Only because you stole my socks-”
“I’m going to have to tell someone, Draco.”
"Is there something you're not telling me?" Draco asked, just to be sure. Harry smiled weakly and shook his head. Okay then... maybe he was just emotional knowing how close they were to end of this God forsaken war. "Well, I feel like I have to give a big, romantic speech too." Draco told him. Harry laughed.
“Oh, I found the poor thing wandering about the castle a few weeks ago,” she said, picking it up to kiss the top of its head. Draco had to mask his laugh into a cough. “Normally, she comes and goes as she pleases… I’ve named her Toodles.” Umbridge added. Draco gave a stoic nod.
“There was one person,” Severus answered him. Draco waited. “Because he was grateful for my service, he agreed to give her a chance. She did not take it.” He said solemnly and then gave a satisfied nod at his work of piling dark objects between them.
“You tend to calm down when they’re with you. Even if you don’t realize it.” He shrugged, “It’s easier than trying to wake you up every time, I suspect.” He explained. Draco closed his eyes. From beside him, Harry shifted slightly, hand tiredly reaching out. Draco reached down to touch his hand and immediately he stopped moving to fall back into whatever deep sleep he had been pulled from. “I can make them stop if you don’t like it.” Neville added, hesitantly.
“He is older,” Draco pointed out, “Is he even allowed to take you to the ball?”
"Sorry," he added to him and Severus rolled his eyes. "What are you doing here?" He asked and Severus rubbed the arm he had gotten shot in absently before glancing over his shoulder at the door. Silently, he gestured them all to sit before opening his cloak to bring out an old book.
Just as he was debating the technicalities of possibly taking his headmaster to court there was a squeaking of the doors behind them opening. A low murmur followed as Dumbledore smiled towards the other end of the hall.
“Sure,” he said and then fixed him with a long look, “There’s also something I wanted to talk to you about.” He added. Harry looked at him - a hint of confusion playing over his features. “I know you’re going through trauma. You saw someone die. Voldemort is back and all that, but… I…” He took a long breath before sitting up and clasping his hands together. “I want to make sure I have the story right.”
“It’s
“A friend,” he said, “They’ve sent me feelings everyday for a while now. Mostly good stuff. Laughter. Happiness. All that,” he shrugged. “Sometimes it's concern, but I think they try to keep it upbeat.” He mused and looked down at the watch fondly. “It was the only reason I didn’t lose my mind sometimes.”
Desperate. There was that word again. Maybe it applied to him after all.
there are some things we have to discuss, but before you say anything just know I had to do it to keep you safe-”
“My God,” he whispered, “He did it.”
“I don’t care. Stop almost dying. Every year. Honestly, can’t they just expel you already?” He muttered, shoving himself away. Theo was frowning at them, a small glare settled on Harry.
He turned, looking to the front of the hall to find the potions’ master staring innocently back at him. Draco wasn’t sure he had ever been betrayed like this before. He stared back, shocked and outraged before the letter gave a sharp hiss to regain his attention.
my family. If I take precautions then at least I have a chance with one or the other.” He said.
to the continent in search for Andromeda. Needless to say that while she had physically recovered, her magic was probably still healing to apparate all four of them any distance. Draco had offered to try, but given the fact he had been tortured for an inordinate amount of time it seemed equally precarious to try. The obvious solution would have been that Draco apparate with Harry and Hermione with Ron, but it was mutually agreed upon it was too risky in their weakened states to attempt to end up in the same place. For all they knew, Hermione might end up at one end of Scotland and Draco in another.
“This isn’t just concern, Draco. You’re breaking the law!” He whispered, “Dumbledore put you up to it, didn’t he? I get that he’s on your side of the war, but I don’t trust the man-”
Draco jumped, a little taken aback by Ron’s voice. He turned to find him staring in bewilderment not at them… but the television. “Is that supposed to be a ghost?” He asked curiously as he looked at the genie. He glanced down at them (both with tear tracks down their face). “Long day?”
"I - you didn't-" Harry choked out, going bright red as Draco turned to him with a raised eyebrow, "I didn't even - he's being dramatic. It wasn't even - I just happened to, um, you just - I happened to look down and, uh-"
“Good night,” he said and looked at the clock on the wall. Three in the morning. It appeared as though their on and off good mornings and good nights weren’t entirely nonsensical. He tried not to notice how close they were… the bed was kind of small. Harry showed no signs of leaving though. It left Draco trying not to choke on his scent before he eventually let go of the chain around his neck and drifted off back to sleep.
Ron made some improvements too... though this was through the watch. Draco might not be speaking, but Ron got the closest given that Draco had decided sharing his feelings through their connecting charm was okay.
“No… this… this woman…” He murmured and swallowed, “She was in Azkaban…” He breathed out, “Voldemort… he was talking to her and… he said your name… I couldn’t hear the rest.” He managed and then shook his head, “They said…” He frowned and looked up at Draco with furrowed brows.

. If anyone could help it would be Hermione.
"At... the Burrow?" Draco frowned, following his gaze, "Um, yeah. Usually a couple times during the summer or something. Why?" He asked.
.” She said and stormed over to where a boy was passing by. He froze, hands immediately going to beautifully braided hair in alarm as Zoe bounced over to right a few wayward strands. Theo sighed.
The others were thundering up quickly - Draco could hear Fenrir searching for Gibbon and Rowle. It was just him and Severus… and Dumbledore.
"It makes food into liquid according to Draco."
“Aw,” Draco chuckled when the colors settled. This time, there was a very small version of Harry blabbering about nothing as Remus very seriously nodded, hanging onto every non-coherent word as if it were life or death. “You were kind of cute.” He said and glanced over, “I wonder what went wrong.”
, that's now how you wear..." She sighed and turned to help him fix the tangled sleeves and clasps Ron had gotten tied up in as Draco considered the idea that Theo had been in Fleur's house... plotting. To overthrow Voldemort.
“Your parents?” Draco asked quietly as they sat across from one another.
"You agree then?" He whispered, "I should just leave him here?"
“I mean, it’s got to have been a rough summer… then with the dementors and, well, his aunt and uncle.” He said. Draco nodded. He had hoped with Voldemort back they would have found somewhere better to go… apparently not. Apparently it took a dementor attack to get him out of that hellhole. “Are you sure you’re okay?” Ron asked, putting a hand on his shoulder, “With Theo and all?” He asked.
His thought process changed rather quickly during their fifth year. Turns out, Harry didn't like it so much when the roles reversed. It was
“Which one?” Fleur asked and Draco bit his tongue as they moved.
He had no idea what to make of that.
"I'm sorry!" Hermione said as she quickly set to work reattaching Ron's hand, "Draco told me about this place and showed me a picture in case of an emergency, but he never had a chance to take me. It makes it a bit tricky with the apparation bit," she said though she seemed a bit off. Harry frowned as he watched her pause to regain her breath a few times before forcing herself to keep working. Ron watched her with an air of concern - now apparently all too familiar with the splinching process given his numerous splinches so far to focus on that. He was quiet as Harry started to digest where they were.
Draco looked around.
“Alright, alright-” He muttered and ripped open the envelope. “Calm dow-”

"Do you think Harry is suited for auror work?" He asked, a bit absently. McGonagall blinked. "I mean, obviously, he would be
“No,” Draco said, sitting up, “This is just helping me prioritize-”
“Harry,” Theo said, perhaps seeing a potential ally “Who were you cheering for during the World Cup?” He asked and Draco felt himself relax a little when Harry immediately latched onto the conversation. Even Ron begrudgingly allowed himself to be dragged into the discussion with the absurdity of the match.
“I asked you because I really wanted to go with you… as not exactly… friends.” He said slowly, nose wrinkling a bit. “I don’t know how you feel about that.” He said and Draco bit the inside of his cheek.
"Well, where is the mirror?" Blaise asked. Finally. A question Draco could actually answer.
been dating all summer… so, like, five months in total? It wasn’t the shortest relationship, but he had honestly expected it to go on much, much longer. Especially since Harry seemed to really like Ginny. Draco might be secretly dying inside at the pair of them together, but he could at least acknowledge that nobody made Harry smile at much as Ginny did… well, maybe Draco could, but that was only because Harry seemed secretly amused when other people got hexed (something both Draco and Ginny excelled in).
“Oh, don’t even worry about it. Half the time it’s a real treat.” She said, sitting down between Draco and Hermione.
There were pros and cons to Draco’s bad decision making.
”Its been a while since we’ve gotten dinner. You want to come over later?” Draco asked Jenkins as Harry hit his arm, "What?" He asked and then leaned over to scoop up Andi, "We should be going. I honestly just wanted to remind you not to take too long - and hey," Draco added to the class, "Remember that the Great Hall is closed today. According to Headmistress McGonagall if you're caught there then you get detention for a month," he told the students who all grumbled. "Jenkins, I'm sure Hermione and Ron would be very pleased if you attended." He added as an afterthought. Jenkins gave a gracious nod in return. "Alright, we're going to go fix the hair crisis - bye everyone!" He called, grabbing Teddy's hand to also lead him out as everyone returned his farewell.
“Um, yeah? I don’t think he’s going around staring at
“You wouldn’t think it just by looking at him, would you?”
“Come now, little lion. Stand tall,” Voldemort purred, “Tell me, is our Gryffindor afraid?” He asked. Draco swallowed back the tingling fear to look him straight in the eyes. “No, of course not.” He scoffed.
. Draco had gone after him… Draco had followed him and the others came… His father must have given it to her somehow. He did this. Why…?
“Besides, his family has no idea I’m in his life at all.” He mumbled and Hermione reached over to pat his arm. Draco’s pout furthered. “I just… don’t get why,” he finally admitted, “I only… I mean,” he took a long breath. “Theo has pretty much gone against every other norm for his bloodline. I don’t quite understand why he’s following
Draco growled and threw his hand up, “Just drink it,” he snapped and waited for Harry to get through the fire before downing his own. “Bloody think I can’t bloody do potions,” he grumbled and marched after him.
“He asked me out.”
know these things.” Draco said and tilted his head at him. “I guess it’s fine… you’re pretty enough to get away with it.” He grinned and Harry scoffed.
still angry with Severus over last year. He felt betrayed over him not rising up to be the person he thought he was. Draco had always looked up to him and… whatever. He was just disappointed. It was like the last real connection to his old life had finally given out.
he didn’t know. Draco couldn’t kill him. Not for this. Not for something that wasn’t even his fault. It was Draco’s fault. He couldn’t let him die over something
"That's awful," Hermione said, brows creasing together. Draco nodded. He didn't know much more than that. He got the feeling Severus might have been at the end of his father's 'temperaments' as well, but it wasn't something he had ever dared to ask about. Offhandedly, he wondered if it was something Sirius might be helpful with... not that the two would ever have an emotionally connected relationship, but... well. It didn't matter now, he supposed.
fancy being the first person to take her on. Sure enough, one of the Death Eaters stepped forward only to be immediately taken down. Draco shook his head in silent awe.
“You are still my family!” He shouted and then looked away. Why did nobody seem to understand this? “And it isn’t just you anymore.” He whispered to the ground, “If Voldemort wins then Hermione dies. Ted dies. Ron and Andromeda will be
“I think we can find out fairly quickly where your loyalties truly lie.” Bellatrix whispered and lowered her wand. Draco’s stomach sank. He wasn’t sure he liked where this was going. “Grab my arm.”
"I am upset by that."
He had… wary feelings about Moody. Harry and Ron said he had wary feelings about
Neville. Go.” He said, shoving him away.
"Then they'll send a group and we just ambush them." Theo shrugged. Harry nodded.
"So, right," Draco began as they stood in front of Ron in an otherwise empty common room, "Don't be a prick about it,
“Draco, that is awful! How could you say that to her?” Hermione said, tugging at her hair. Draco threw up his hands. They were never
“I don’t see it.” He finally said and Gabrielle looked at Fleur expectantly.

“Theo-”
"That herbology assignment is due today," he said... somehow sounding the same level of distressed he was when Voldemort returned, "I haven't started. Can you two help me?" He asked, sitting down to open one of the books to a random page and furiously began scribbling. Hermione and Draco looked at one another. "Hermione? Draco?"

"Ha," Draco said and shook his head, "I

“You will,” Neville shrugged and picked up his dropper, “Though, if you’re really feeling that guilty you can do me a favor.” He said lightly and reached into his bag to pull out a blue bound book. “Can you give this back to Professor Moody for me? I already read it twice now.” He said and held it out. Draco took it.
“His head!” He shouted and Harry yanked the sword up just in time to swiftly move up as the basilisk moved again. For a moment, Harry almost disappeared. Draco had no idea if he made it out or not until he saw the tip of the sword sticking out of the top of the basilisk. “...holy mother of Merlin.” He whispered and pushed himself up.
“Nothing! He’s actually quite lovely,” She admitted and Draco nodded. There you go. “...he’s asked me to the ball.” She added on quietly. Ah, there it was. “I suppose Ron might be pleased given how big of a fan he is… maybe I can get him an autograph or something.” She sighed.
Leaving him to mull over his own asshassery, Draco went in the same direction Hermione had stormed off in. She wasn’t hard to find. In fact, she was in the very same place she was the very first time Ron had made her cry.
“Oh, but I have so much catching up to do! Where’s Granger? Or did she decide to go off to Durmstrang?” He asked flatly. Draco gave a fake laugh before forcefully grabbing his arm and steering them away from the crowd. “You seem tense,” Theo told him, “Is something bothering you, sweetheart?”
“Do you hear it?” He asked, turning towards them with a frown, “You hear it, right?”
“It’s
"Draco snapped that in half last year before killing Dumbledore," he said, squeezing Draco's hand as he said the words. Theo turned to look at him, chin in his hand as he stared at him for a couple seconds before closing his eyes and taking a long breath, "Sorry..."
"The memory he mentioned... you called Lily Potter-"
Now he was helpless. All he could do - the
“Ah, yes. Draco Malfoy and his quill obsession. A well-known fact.” He scoffed and opened the door.
... Uh huh.... yeah, it was brilliant... Thank you, but it wasn't all my teaching, Lils... Well, I wouldn't say that." Remus continued, laughing. Draco watched fondly. He was almost a little disappointed he couldn't use the resurrection stone to see Lily and James himself. He was curious what it would be like to have an actual conversation with them.
have post-traumatic stress it is different enough from humans that-”
He asked. Silence. "Or, I know, perhaps you know of love through Grindelwald?"
“You are going to become a low class evil git.” Ron corrected himself and Draco didn’t even grace that with a response as he pointedly stared at the chicken that was in Ron’s grasp. “Shut up.”
Zoe growled and cursed when her bag broke, sending spilled ink and parchment everywhere. She bent down to pick it up, but a new bag came from seemingly nowhere and hit her in the face. “Seriously?” She asked. From the opposite side of the courtyard, Zach was trying to retreat, but kept getting blocked by Karkaroff appearing to give him some sort of award or random people coming up to give him good news.
A weak chuckle drifted over the remaining Death Eaters who had been shifting uncertainly around the room. Some had gone towards his mother while others were trying to keep his father from fighting back. Draco wouldn't let himself look at them. Not now.
“I have a cold so I can’t smell anything.”
“No. Though I did think I was in love with him earlier.” He mused and Harry blinked at him a few times. “It’s weird. Like… I regard him very fondly, but also the idea of kissing him seems weird. Kind of like Hermione, actually.” He frowned, “I’m pretty sure if kissing wasn’t involved in the relationship I would marry him.” He decided. Harry stared at him.
Moody held his wand up, but it sagged a bit as he tried to murmur something. Draco walked over and kicked it out of his hand as his one eye began to flutter. He turned back to Harry.
.” He said when Ron and Gabrielle broke the surface of the water. Fleur jumped up, moving towards the edge of the lake to greet her sister, wrapping a large towel around her with murmurs of reassurances and apologies.
“He most certainly does.”
“Stop it,” Hermione interjected, “We didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just… well,” she gestured to Harry. “We wanted to say hi since breaking the rules is apparently fine.” She added under her breath.
“I know,” Harry said, obviously distressed, “But what if they try to get you back by making you join the Death Eaters?” He explained. Draco would have been offended - should have been by the implication he would abandon them all for a glimpse of approval - but Harry seemed so upset by the mere suggestion that he stayed quiet. “Just… be careful, okay?” He added a little hesitantly. Draco pursed his lips, but nodded.
Draco paused.
“So do I,” he said coldly. Stupidly. Definitely stupidly because this was so, so,
“Don’t be cocky,” Draco sniffed, “I just don’t understand why we haven’t found a solution to this yet. Glasses cause so many problems. Harry has almost killed himself being so blind!”
“Maybe I fucked up too,” Draco shrugged, “Hope that makes you feel better about ruining her night when she did nothing wrong.” He said and for good measure, shook his head and said, “You see everyday how much she gets tormented. You couldn’t just let her have this?”
Hagrid was surprisingly an adept teacher. Draco had originally been pretty exasperated to learn he would be in charge of Care of Magical Creatures for the year (especially given the biting book from Hell). Hermione told him off endlessly when Draco had asked what teaching credentials he even had (it was a valid question and he stood by that). However, Draco had been pleasantly surprised to learn that while he didn't like Lupin’s teaching methods… He did really enjoy Hagrid’s.
“Want to skip class and drink firewhiskey?” She asked. Zoe glanced over and snorted at her. “What? He looks like he needs it. You can bring Weasley too. Not Granger though. As cute as she is, she’ll definitely tell on us.” Sadie grumbled. Zoe chuckled, though it seemed forced. Had Draco spoken with her since he'd been back? He didn't think so. Maybe it was Theo?
“Lucky guess.” He muttered and Draco gave a pleased laugh. Harriet was going to be a brilliant pet, he could already tell. “You’re
date then?”
Harry tensed.
Whatever else he might have said was cut off by the door slamming open. Nymphadora stood by the entrance, leaning against the doorframe with Harry right beside her.
“No tea party is any fun without Luna,” Neville said and Draco nodded.
“Is this your cat, professor?” He asked.
"He tried to talk to Draco at the feast," she said slowly, shoving the remainder of her breakfast away. Draco turned to meet her eyes, hoping to keep his face blank. "Maybe something happened... with Voldemort returning and all." She mused as the others cringed away from the name. Draco sighed, shutting his book with a small glare at all of them.
“That’s what I say too,” he laughed, “But Molly might not be pleased with you calling her home boring.” He explained. Fleur sighed. He could read her expression clearly.
“I know,” he sighed, “She thinks if she switches sides early on that they’ll spare her.” He said quietly. Dumbledore’s jaw tightened on that, but didn’t argue as he filed the list away. “As for Harry, I think he needs to know-”
”As if you did anything!” Draco called, walking into the room. Harry’s mouth dropped in greeting, ”Don't believe a word he says. I did all the heavy lifting," he informed the group gravely. Whispers flew across the classroom. In the back, he could see a few Beaxbatons uniforms (Fleur had made an exchange program for all the magical schools years ago) and - yep. Gabrielle Delacour was among them. She didn't seem to notice Draco given that she was fluttering her eyelashes at a boy who was smiling dreamily at her.
And there was his mother. He tried not to react too much to her. Narcissa was in an evening gown, eyes flicking over the room carefully until it landed on Voldemort...then Draco.
"Why? He's my cousin. Not yours. Back off."
had no idea how to deal with that. Theo didn’t seem to mind as he grinned up at the Weasleys.
"Uh, well. I, ugh." He groaned, sinking a bit in his seat. Draco frowned. This was
"Why? What did you feel?" He asked and Ron's lips pursed.
“I’ve used the killing curse,” he said and Draco raised a disbelieving brow, “In the manor. There was a Death Eater. I could have stunned him, but I just... I killed him. Didn’t even think about it.” He explained, looking very... matter-of-fact about the whole thing. Draco frowned. He couldn't think of anything less Harry-like. Sure, Harry threatened to kill people occasionally (Sirius during their third year for example), but he never actually
“Well, Lavender appears to be giving him
It was... well, kind of ugly. To him.
“What? I - I mean, I didn’t - what are you talking about?” He stuttered out and then flinched, “I just… You… did Hermione say…? I didn’t mean to!” He burst out so loudly that Draco almost fell off the couch.
The day was shaping up quite nicely.
, people weren’t kidding. Those were Harry’s eyes. From the shape to the color to the goddamn lashes. They were eerily identical. Ron blinked a few times before leaning forward to look at Harry’s face, also stunned by the revelation. They had seen Lily before, of course. Through pictures and hints of her when they checked to make sure the memories weren’t tampered. Nobody had stayed too long to get a good look at her though. It felt too personal to digest without Harry’s permission.
. He and Hermione had tried valiantly to reason with Harry - enough to get him to try firecalling him. Sirius hadn’t answered though.
on saying he was my friend. They already knew that. I figured it was better than saying my loyalties lied with him.” He explained and shook his head, taking a deep breath, “But what ended up coming out was… that I, uh, had strong feelings for him.” He mumbled.
“For what?”
“Wow, a
Draco wasn’t sure how his life had gone so wrong. If someone would have told that Hogwarts would lead to him becoming peacekeeper to a half-blood and a bloodtraitor with his best friend the mudblood in Gryffindor then he might have just agreed to go to Durmstrang.
Pansy didn’t respond. It wasn’t the first time he had apologized since the second-year incident… but it was the first time she didn’t shoot it down.
It was poorly worded and awkward, he knew. But Draco couldn’t find it within himself to care as he tied the string around a school owl and sent it off. From beside him, there was a curious hum. He turned to see Longbottom watching the owl take off.
“...McGonagall said she would tell you instead of Andromeda.” He said slowly. Severus just continued chopping up some ingredients, “You know what we
"Hey, Ginny," Neville laughed, "Have you heard of Sherlock Holmes?" He asked. Ginny (who apparently was not getting off of him) gave a slight shrug.
and he couldn't have one normal semester. First they hired Voldemort, then they let a giant snake petrify people, and now Draco was dealing with a very dramatic fugitive when he should be studying for transfiguration.
His mother’s letter from Umbridge consisted of only a handful of words.
"I'm trying this new thing. When you annoy me I'm going to say things I love about you so I won't
The world spun, everything growing disoriented as he tried to make sense of the figure in the hospital bed. Harry and Ron rushed forward, both giving their own reactions as Draco stood completely still. She was… not moving. Not in the way someone slept or even when they died, but… just… like a statue. He inched forward, fingers reaching out to brush over her skin.
Draco really fought hard against the whole thing. Why did they even need a name? Just call it fighting club or whatever and be done with it. Dumbledore didn't need an army. He needed a sense of compassion.
"You had to decide between your kids and some random guy," Draco pointed out. Jenkins peeked under his arm to look at him, "That's kind of my position. Granted, I did it to myself, but... I don't know. I have people I got to keep safe," he said, rubbing the back of his neck, "I knew there would be a war eventually. Now that it's here I'm just doing what I have to. You get that, right?"
“Not well, actually.”
(See the end of the chapter for
, she seemed to say. Wait for what? What was there left to wait for?
The Deathly fucking Hallows were
“That doesn’t mean people can go around hurting you!” Harry said hotly, “I should have let Ron stun him-”
Yep. That was what was happening. Gosh darnit. He would have to work on that.
the time. Before he could respond, Severus materialized with Ron and Hermione to effectively ruin the moment.
“What do you see, Draco?” Harry whispered as they stood in front of the old mirror. Draco only reached out to touch the glass with a sigh before withdrawing his hand, tilting his head down to hide the emotion on his face.
Evil little French fiend. He groaned, watching her waltz into the classroom. Alright, so… wait. Potions. There had to be a potion that would do the trick, right? Or maybe a potion ingredient? Or -
“I saw you.” Theo cut him off tersely. Ah… damnit. Draco felt his stomach twist. “Over the summer. You know, when you decided to break it off with me and go missing for a month.” He said.
“I called Remus!” Sirius said, pulling his head out of a fireplace, “He said to listen to Lily. Lily, come on! Say something!” He said, “For the sake of your unborn child give us some direction -
As suspected, a crowd of people were filed inside. Draco bit his lip and knocked slightly at the door frame. The low murmuring fell completely silent. The Order all turned to him unanimously.
“Hey,” Tonks greeted slowly and tilted her head, “That was really quick. How did you recognize me?” She asked. Draco snorted. She did look different. Her hair was blonde now - eyes a silver that almost matched his own. It was a curious look. Andromeda had told him once that sometimes Nymphadora’s appearance changed without her permission (though it didn’t happen as often since her auror training). He wondered if she had meant for them to look similar or if it was an accident.
Sure enough, a small group of first-years started following him through the castle. It was a very stressful situation. He had to keep snapping his jaws at them when they got too loud or hurriedly herd them somewhere if he thought someone was coming, but eventually he got them all into an empty classroom.
“Quick, dear. Before it’s too late.”
to be with remained forgotten. “I am glad to see you two have made up.” She mused. Harry blinked a few times.
"He's alright," he said, voice going a little high and strained. Sabelia tilted her head. When he locked eyes with her, he found his mouth almost moving without permission, "I'm pretty sure I would already die for him." He said without thinking then frowned. Wait a second. "Hey. No fair." He muttered and Teddy made a garbling noise. "You better hope that one goes back to Brazil and doesn't stay friends with your mom because if not... you won't get away with anything." He whispered. Teddy cooed in agreement, "Glad we're on the same page," he said and Ron peered over.
“I don’t have to. I still respect him. He’s a powerful man. Smart. I just don’t like how he runs this school. I came to get an education, not an adventure.”
"I'm really happy you're alive," he went with and interlaced their fingers. "I probably should have realized sooner. When your patronus came-"
“Severus needs to what?” Draco asked, “Kill you? So that you are the very last one to own that wand?” He asked and clicked his tongue, “You should have told us the truth from the beginning. At the very least you should have warned Harry. What the fuck was he supposed to do when Severus killed you? Why would you keep the fact you asked him to do that a secret?” He asked and Dumbledore closed his eyes.

Draco wasn’t jealous. He wasn’t. He understood. Oh, he definitely understood. It was fine. Totally fine. Great.
“You see, Neville wouldn’t talk to me this way-”
"There's something I need to tell you."
“No, I’m okay,” he said and gave a nod towards Harry moving towards them. “I’m going back to the common room.” He added. Hermione and Ron were nowhere to be seen. If he was going to deal with Harry - or even try and fix whatever occlumency mess he had gotten himself into - it was going to be at least ten minutes after he got decked by a fake package. Neville grimaced.
“He’s just using me as practice for when Ginny starts dating.” He grumbled. It possibly also had to do with the fact he was the first of their group to start dating and Ron being… well,
“-count backward from ten, alright?”
Another pause. Ron went white.
”You know, Professor Potter, I've been asking around and most of the other professors have a high level of qualifications to teach here. Not everyone gets the job through nepotism.” He said calmly and Draco’s mouth fell open before cackling loudly.
“You better explain to me what exactly happened, Draco.” He began and Draco felt a wave of panic when he saw the others start filing in. Giving Theo a sharp nod, he moved to the Gryffindor table to where Harry was waiting with his eyes narrowed at Theo. “I

“I took Felix Felicis earlier,” he whispered. Draco’s mouth parted slightly. Ah. That made
Nope. Not with Harry.
“You came.” He said, and his throat tightened at the sight of her. She wore a black cloak with the hood hiding more of her face, but he knew it was her. He could see wisps of pale blonde hair peeking out and recognized the diamond ring on her left hand.
“No!” Harry shouted, visibly distressed, “I liked both!”
“Except it isn’t the same! You hated your family.”
“Hermy-own.” Viktor said with so much determination that Draco kind of wanted Hermione to relent and say he got it right. On their other side, Cho and Cedric were both eagerly discussing something too low for anyone else to hear. Much to Draco’s horror, Harry was watching with a bit of a wistful look in his eyes. He reached out to kick him under the table before giving a very pointed look at where Parvati was playing absently with her food.
"You want me to fight like a wizard?" He called and tossed the sword to the side so it fell to the ground with a clatter, "Then let's go. Raise your wand fight me, Tom." He said, eyes glittering. Voldemort shook his head in disgust before raising his own. A few people gasped, but Draco raised his hand. "No, no," Draco told them, "Stay out of this. It's our duel." He promised. Voldemort sneered.
"He is now on a mission to get Sabelia and I officially married so he can have two moms. Apparently, me being an auror doesn't seal the deal. He needs back-up." She rolled her eyes. Draco snorted. "Don't get me wrong, I am absolutely thinking about marrying her... the problem is I want the proposal to be a surprise and it is
That was the reason they lost against Hufflepuff. The reason Harry fell hundreds of feet from the sky. It was terrifying to turn and see a figure plummeting to the ground with wisps of black following him. Part of Draco wanted to race towards him, but there was a moment of chilly nothingness that left him frozen.
"What are you saying? Harry, you're not going to
should get over it. It’s none of your business what I do,” He said and tugged Harry’s arm impatiently. “Come on, if we don’t finish our essays by noon I won’t get to see Theo,” he began, but fell silent when he caught sight of a Durmstrang student walking by with golden hair and eyes.
happened to your trunk?” Hermione asked, pulling Draco out of his thoughts. His - ? Shit. Draco grimaced. He knew he had forgotten to do something. Stupid. Hermione frowned, running a hand over the scratched and ruined leather on the side.
"We'll see each other again," he said, a little uncertain. Andromeda smiled at him.
“Tell me to do it,” Draco whispered and his voice cracked towards the end, “Ask me to just once and I… I’ll do it.” He said.
“And who was Voldemort loyal to?” Draco asked, voice sharpening more than he meant. Moody hummed, leaning back in his chair. “Who are you loyal to? Dumbledore?” He asked sardonically, “The man’s allegiance is unclear to say the least.” He said. Moody clicked his tongue.
“No, miss. Believe it or not, I need one for… personal reasons.” He decided. Umbridge’s brows went higher - almost reaching her hairline.
. More traumatic things had happened. In fact, this little revelation about Harry seemed laughable compared to some of the other things.
“...we were fighting?” He asked and turned to Draco, “This is the third time you’ve done this.
"Because it is going to be
she informed him between low hisses,
For a worrying moment, he wasn’t sure it worked. He was still there. Then he raised his hand and the other Draco did too. He smiled. It was just a mirror. Lupin walked over to look it over with unconcealed curiosity.
“I don’t think you understand this movie-”
“Hi, professor.” Draco greeted as he stepped into the DADA room. Lupin glanced back at him. He truly did look awful. Draco inwardly sighed. He wished he still had some pull with how this school operated. Lupin, of all people, should be able to stay. However, even outside Slytherin there was a rather potent stigma against werewolves and he was sure more than the Parkinsons complained.
“Do you trust me?” Draco asked and Theo fixed him with a long look that stood somewhere between ‘absolutely, with my life’ and ‘absolutely not with your own life’.
Oh, Ron... Draco was going to save this story for either his wedding day or blackmail purposes. He wasn't sure which one, but either way he was going to cherish these moments all the same.
“What did you say?”
"I wasn't thinking that," Hermione said hastily. Draco shrugged, "I'm just... confused. That's all." She said and patiently waited. Draco looked around the table. People were staring. They quickly looked away when he caught them.
And they did
“I don’t

been sorted into Slytherin.
"Harry Potter?" Someone asked and Harry looked down. He nodded warily.
"I'm sorry," Andromeda frowned, "Do you think your one good deed cancels out the nightmare you've been since birth?"
“Ah,” his father clicked his tongue, “Andromeda. I was wondering if I would see you today,” he sighed and Draco lowered his gaze. “Narcissa informed me you were… hijacking our son.”
"-last week Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley were said to have been there, but luckily escaped. Nobody knows what caused the explosion, but it appears to have taken out Fenrir Greyback and ten other Death Eaters. Reports say You-Know-Who and Bellatrix Lestrange were not at the manor when the explosion happened so don't let down your guard," Lee continued. Harry's eyes widened. Malfoy Manor? It
a Death Eater. Now? No. Now, he was just a jackass.
He said and Harry choked, "There was a bloody keynote speaker."
Draco loved his friends. Truly. But they were also terrible. Like. Awful. Horrible.
"I want to teach too," she said and wiggled out of Draco's grip. He sighed, watching as she took her place in front of Harry, "Hi. My name is Andi, but today you can call me Professor Ando-reada."
“Need any help?” Harry asked and Draco considered.
“That’s different!” Harry burst out, “Sirius hated his family!”
From the couch, Lily stretched.
“I can’t ask you to do that,” he whispered, voice catching. “You’ve worked hard to keep your family safe. I won’t ask you to leave it because I’m scared.” He said and Draco grimaced.
“Well, you’re an obvious choice to train for a spy,” Neville shrugged, “With You-Know-Who back, I mean. Between your family and your friends… plus, you’re smart.” He added with a shrug. Draco laughed.
Quirrell clapped his hands, and whatever else Draco might have done was thwarted by ropes slithering around him, binding his hands to his sides with a sharp tug. Harry’s eyes widened as he knelt down to help him, but Quirrell snapped his fingers.
"I didn't do it to be nasty..." Neville repeated, rubbing the back of his neck. Draco and Ginny unanimously laughed at him.
He paused that thought when he noticed a small flash of red caught his eye. He glanced around before shaking his letter a bit. A quill fell out, fluttering to the floor. He leaned over to pick it up, a hint of exasperation playing in the back of his mind. He glanced at the bottom of the letter and sure enough… gold ink was written neatly at the bottom of the list.
“Did you?” Draco cut him off. “Pansy? Of all people?”
“What are you up to-?”
surprised
"We don't have a couple minutes!" Draco shot back at her incredulously, "I just... got a little tired, but I'm okay now," he promised her. Even if he fell right back into whatever trance he had been before it was better to take advantage of this burst of energy while he still had it. Hermione bit her lip. "I know you want to be with Harry too." He said and glanced up to see Ron had already slipped away - probably to join Harry himself. Hermione opened her mouth, but quickly cut herself off by sighing.
Anywho! EPILOGUE! It's gonna be long and cute and I'm excited for you guys to see it! Thanks for making it this far <3 I know this is ridiculously long so like... thank you. You guys are the best.
"So," Dora said, walking over next to Draco while giving the pair amused eyes, "How are you doing?"
“No, but I’m sure he knew it was a possibility,” Draco grinned. Hermione rolled her eyes, but it did nothing to dampen her smile, “I just didn’t want you to walk out there alone.” He said gently and at that, Hermione bit her lip looking down.
.” Draco breathed out as he stood back up. Harry was still speaking.
She shrieked and Draco stuck out his tongue at him.
"No, no time," Draco shook his head, "You're going to have to trust me. You trust me, right?" He asked. Ted hesitated, "Please!" He added, voice growing panicked. He might have to apparate them again if he didn't leave soon. Draco had no idea what to do. No idea what he could do-
Unfortunately, he was getting neither. So yeah. His patience was a little thin.
“More stupid than usual.”
“Is that a snake?” He asked and sure enough, a head poked up with beady, silver eyes and a forked tongue. Hermione leaned forward eagerly.
"If I'm not feeling better tomorrow, I will." Draco lied. It wasn't that he didn't trust Pomfrey's discretion - he did, truly - he just felt sure this would go away on its own soon enough. Harry sighed, but got up to cross the room. There was the crinkling of paper and then something was thrown at his face. Git.
stupid. Harry blinked. “Don’t be foolish. There’s two of us and one of you.” Draco said. Moody snorted, eye whirling chaotically.
Whatever lightheartedness had previously filled the air was zapped as Harry took a step forward.
those occlumency lessons. Then, I expect you to get your act together because I know your grades are slipping and you have OWLs coming up.” She said. Draco grimaced.
There was a small cheer at that. Neville raised his wand as well.
did after school! Nonsense!” He said. Draco threw a piece of ginger at him. “Yeah, I know. Someone is trying to kill me.” He sighed, “Hermione already told me.” He grumbled.
Harry's voice suddenly cut in, rendering the rest of the world irrelevant. He turned to see Harry had recovered from whatever had been in his head, eyes blown wide with horror, "
"You do remember what
“Oh my God, you’re
“Aladdin is a bitch,” Ron said dutifully and sat down next to him, “I’m sorry about your mom.” He added quietly. “You know, if you ever asked… my mother would fight her for you.” He said. “I figured Andromeda had first dibs, but listen. Hey. Draco. My mom will fight her for you.” He said and Draco gave a snort. “My mom is already going to fight me for you.”
which Draco was pretty sure translated to ‘always kind’.
"Tell me what our legal names are," Harry said and Draco laughed at him, "At least let me know what mine is!" He said indignantly, "
“....he hasn’t killed me yet.” Harry’s voice grumbled. Ron gave a slight shrug at that as Hermione closed her eyes again. “Besides, I’m with you. Let’s just go to Zonko’s or -
“That is not the point,” Draco told him flatly, “The point is that I said he was an example of a superior muggle and now I have a bunch of Death Eaters reading those damned books and asking if they could come with me to kill him!” He said. Harry put a hand over his mouth in horror.
“I thought you would never ask,” he said and reached into his trunk to toss a bottle of Sleekeazy’s hair potion at him. “Here. You can keep the comb.” He added.
"I do have one final warning for you though," Draco said as he waited. Voldemort gave an impatient intake, "You should know that while Harry is a Gryffindor through and through... the sorting house did offer to put him into Slytherin." He said.

“Why did your parents name you after something that was
"Paperwork?" He heard Harry echo and gave a low laugh before marching over towards the portrait hole.
That being said... Year 3 is my favorite so I hope you guys enjoy it!
Draco felt a cold sense of dread at how... composed he was. That wasn't a good sign. He wished Severus was here. He would know what to do.
How dorky of her.
Draco had seen trolls before. His father took him to troll farms all the time as a child, but never had he been this close. The thing was grumbling lowly, its skin glittering with slime as he dragged a large club sluggishly behind it.
...no way. Draco went back to the peppermint he was slicing, feeling his face heat up. The only thing Slughorn would like more than knowing and being responsible for successful wizards is knowing and being responsible magical
“See, Peter? I told you this would be fun.” He said. Right. This man was a whack job. Draco turned to say something to Harry, but surprisingly he wasn't paying attention to Black. He was focused on Harriet hissing lowly with her eyes fixed on where Scabbers was wildly trying to escape Ron’s grasp.
No. No
. Here are the takeaways:
"You really have such little faith in him."
"You sound like-" Severus began defensively and then stopped, "I barely nicked precious Potter. Ask his son if you don't believe me." He grumbled a bit darkly. Draco frowned. What did that mean? He tried to think of when Harry would have -
“My parents might be waiting for me on the platform,” he said weakly. They wouldn’t completely abandon him, right? Ron grimaced.
"My understanding was the Ministry of Magic was taken over by Death Eaters," Severus added, sneering as he looked the two over with an air of disgust.
it added. Draco narrowed his eyes.
"Sure," he said and propped himself up on his elbows, "You seem kind of young to be talking about wars," he mused and then shook his head, "I guess that isn't unusual though," he mused. Draco shrugged.
name). “Um, do you think… your father…” He began and then stopped again.
"My students can assure you of my talents," she said and turned to look at Ginny, "I am a malnatus," she added to her. Zoe brightened a bit as she peered down at her, "My mother was forced to drink veritserum while carrying me and now it is... very easy for me to persuade the truth from others. I can promise I will do my job well." She told everyone with a nod, "Could you, perhaps, show me where this Lady of Gray is?" She asked, turning to someone Draco couldn't quite make out. Before he could get closer, Neville's eyes met his.
“Why half the time?” She asked cautiously, looking fearful and curious at once. Zoe nodded, picking at her robes as Theo rolled his eyes behind her. Draco bit back a grin. He had heard Zoe explain her predicament a few times already and he was pretty sure she liked telling the story.
“You wouldn’t really turn me over, would you?” Draco asked, a bit incredulously. He wouldn’t. Couldn’t. Not Theo. Sure, Draco knew he could wilt under the gaze of authority… He liked to think you could do the right thing by following the systems put in place, but... he wouldn't, right? "Theo, they don't even believe that Voldemort is really back!" Draco pointed out, "How can you think they'd be a good ally in any of this?"
“Theo, can you give us a second?” He asked as Harry innocently tilted his head. Theo blinked at the suddenness of the request, but didn’t argue as he glanced warily between the two.
“Shit,” Draco greeted and fell back onto the bed. Harry’s hand clasped around his knee. “Good morning.” He managed and grabbed the watch around his neck again. He squeezed tightly. More warmth came through. A burst of faith that momentarily slowed his heart down to normal speeds.
“Draco,” He greeted and smiled weakly. “What do I owe the pleasure?”
There was a pause. Draco wondered if he had somehow mucked this up already.
“The… curse?” Hermione repeated slowly.
Draco frowned and cracked open the door. Jugson snorted and pushed him further inside before letting the door slam shut behind him. He turned and immediately felt his heart drop.
"Sounds exhausting."
“Now, now. We all know Harry is only here because of Fleamont.” He said teasingly. Harry fixed him with a baffled glare. Wait. “...your grandfather.” Draco clarified. Harry blinked.

“Draco, that’s brilliant!” Hermione said and before he could ask what was happening, they were apparating again. Draco didn’t even bother to ask anymore. He figured explanations were pretty much dead at this point. He was surprised it took him this long to accept it.
“It’s your plan, mate.” He said and tapped his finger against his thigh before nodding. “Well, I think we’ve done it.” He mused and leaned back against his chair, “You might actually be able to pull this off… unless something goes horribly wrong, of course.” He mused. Draco snorted.
“Now, you listen to me James Potter. I know you’re scared. Hell, I am too… but there is nobody - and I mean
Well then.
might need to change, but perhaps he should have thought to look that up himself. At least it looked like he could still stuff his face with Honeydukes... it just couldn't be within an hour from when he did his duties with Dumbledore. Fair enough, he supposed.
Draco was a little bitter about the whole thing. Not that it mattered given everything else going on. Cedric Diggory was dead. Hermione had trapped Rita Skeeter in a bottle (much to Draco’s amusement). Harry won the tournament and Voldemort was back in action.
to worry over someone like that. To sit there not being able to do anything... to get scolded every time he tried. Harry wasn't suited for the patient, supportive friend role after all. Hermione and Ron were saints for being able to do it so well. Harry was still trying to learn.
