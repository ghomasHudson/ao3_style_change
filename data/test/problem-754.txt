“Because it’s your spot, and we should show the trees how far we’ve come.”
Draco blinked. The pool? A swimming pool? It took him a moment to remember those children in the lift when they’d first arrived. Right. Presumably there was a swimming pool in the basement. “No,” he barked out, harsher than he’d meant to. He was upset. And he felt guilty. Because he’d done nothing to make Potter’s life any easier back then. Quite the opposite, in fact.
'Oh, well, I'm glad, then.' Harry picked up the self-care paper from their Mind Healer, and gave it another once-over. 'Is there something on the list you'd actually like to do?'
In between bites of roast beef, Harry’s eyes darted around the room. Something twisted in his gut.
Harry shrugged his shoulders, and let out a little laugh. ‘Me neither.’
Draco licked at his bottom lip again. He was off-kilter. He didn’t know the first thing about any of this. Their relationship (undefined as it was) felt fragile, like it might snap apart with any sudden movements.
“I don’t want to talk to you,” Malfoy said, simply.
Harry exhaled. Fine.
‘Hmm? No … Oh, I forgot to mention, we didn’t get back together.’ Harry said with eyes closed, snuggling deeper into the pillow.
“I … he’s not—” Robert fumbled. It didn’t sound very convincing.
They were kissing.
‘Yeah, but only once I got here, and then I had no one to ask.’
Hermione seemed scandalised.
Neville exhaled his breath in a whoosh. ‘I see.’
“No, thank you.” He spared her a quick glance.
“Yeah.”
The old Draco might’ve said something cutting, something stupid, about Potter just lying there on a bed with shoes on. Just to rile Potter up, just to make Potter notice him or be impressed with his wit. But that would be pre-war Draco, and he is gone.
to it. Wanked to Harry’s words … and orgasmed.
Draco lay himself down properly, with his head on the pillow. So Harry followed suit, not quite knowing where this was going—but interested nonetheless. They looked up at the yellow canopy above them.
“It’s okay. I’m just teasing you.”
They settled into a two-person table together. A waiter came over to take their orders. Draco still couldn’t stop smiling. He kept trying not to... but it wasn't working.
. Red blotchy smudges on his cheeks.
Ron quirked an eyebrow. “And what’s a normal amount?”
Malfoy nodded, grabbing a magazine from the coffee table and settling into a seat.
Draco started thrusting upwards too, making smacking sounds against Harry’s arse. Their bodies found a steady, beautiful rhythm. A synchronicity.
“Harry!”
Harry's arms loosened on Draco, as Harry drew back to face him. His eyelids were heavy, but he opened them slowly, revealing dilated pupils. And Draco forgot to breathe.
Draco downed the rest of his glass, and set it on the edge of the bar counter.
“You think?” Malfoy looked at him like he couldn’t believe he didn’t know.
Harry smiled, stepping into the room.
She paused, and turned to him. She smiled when she saw what he was looking at. “You can meet me at the desk over there, when you’re ready.”
‘Mm, five more minutes,’ Malfoy mumbled.
Harry scrambled to sit up. It was as if a meadow of flowers had blossomed in his chest—as incredibly cheesy as that probably sounded. He just felt … warm, at the same time as his heartrate sped up rapidly with uncertainty, all along with a healthy dose of feeling a possible impending doom approaching—knowing that Draco might at any moment break his heart, rather than explain it’d all been a big misunderstanding.
Then he noticed the little lacquered signs on each display, announcing their reasonable prices under a familiar store logo. Marks and Spencer, Harry was inside Marks and Spencer.
Harry closed his journal softly, and took a deep breath. That’d all felt significant, somehow. Dense, like he was going to have to unpack it all more slowly. He fell asleep clutching the journal to his chest.
Harry nodded too, searching Malfoy’s face. He couldn’t figure him out.
They watched, Harry with a big smile, and Malfoy rather baffled by the whole thing.
made him blush. ‘Shut up,’ he said. ‘You are.’
Draco brushed his fingertips over Harry’s bicep—he had a tiny raised bit of skin on the back of his arm, near the armpit. A mole perhaps? He turned his head to bury his nose in Harry’s inky black curls, and kissed gently.
Draco didn’t have time to respond before the doors closed. With a sigh, he looked at the panels of buttons. Two. He was meant to go to two. He pressed the ‘2’ button. It lit up red.
And the room felt tense, as the space between them appeared to grow with each passing moment of silence.
“I don’t like him,” Draco bit back.
With one more deep breath, Draco got moving. He wrapped around the side of the building, past the over-flowing bins and up towards the entranceway.
He licked his lips. And scribbled a question he’d wanted to ask for a while.
Harry cuddled into him, wedging under Draco’s arm and kissing at his jaw. “Don’t overthink it. Remember? It doesn’t have to be complicated for no reason.”
“Harry,” Malfoy breathed out, going in for Harry’s jaw—just under the ear—planting kisses there.
Harry’s gaze snapped to the Slytherin table. Was his journal-mate among them? Most of the Slytherins were watching McGonagall with grim faces. Some looked out-right angry. Malfoy was different though, with his head resting on his hand, and eyes cast downwards.
Shrugging, Harry relented, 'I just don't like it. The attention, the expectations. I don't want them.' He sighed and kneaded the dough a little more gently. 'Anyway, I hate to bring up tea towels again but have you got any clean ones?'
Hermione and Ron came by, looking about as sombre as Harry felt. They sat themselves around his living room, with mugs of tea.
'Mm, wha' happen'd?' Ron said, though a mouthful of food, peering at Harry curiously.
…" Harry copied that down (with their actual names of course). “Congratulations on your wedding. Wait, no.
Draco’s mouth. That pink tongue.
Harry exhaled slow. ‘I don’t know.’
“Why aren’t you … with your family?” Harry asked tentatively, searching his memory for clues. Nothing had happened to Draco’s parents, had they? He avoided the Prophet like the plague, but, someone would’ve mentioned it if something had happened to Draco’s parents, probably.
Harry looked over to said-person. Said-person looked up from his book and shot Harry a warning glare. Harry looked away quickly, back to Hermione, sighing. “We hate each other,” he said miserably.
With a minute to spare, he grabbed the half-full bag of dried mulberries, since Draco had said he could have it, and pulled the Portkey out of his pocket. It was just a small metal bell.
He fidgeted with the cuff of his green flannel shirt. They were going on some Muggle
Could this be a Horcrux?
Hermione looked subtly sorrowful at that, but she nodded. “Just let it all out, tell me what you’ve been thinking.”
, he thought again. Because it all seemed natural, when it shouldn’t.
Draco leaned in to kiss Harry, as he pulled that awful tie off and tossed it aside. Harry melted into it, with hands travelling over him, tugging at the clasp of his robes, undoing buttons on his shirt. Harry opened his mouth to allow Draco’s tongue access. Merlin, that perfect, wet, amazing mouth.
"Me neither," admitted Harry. "Maybe we should do it anyway."
"Luna might know one," said Harry, catching her eye with a smile. She drifted over, head tilted.
"Merlin," muttered Malfoy after a few minutes. "For someone who never leaves the house, you certainly know how to walk."
"Luna, you know that's a weird thing to say, even for you, right?"
"I — " he started, and then turned to Harry again. "I'm very flattered by the invitation."
to give him anything," said Seamus.
"Dunc's my brother-in-law," she said, making a nod to the other tattoo artist behind her. "I asked him to teach me to tattoo, and I got hooked."
"Only if you don't mind the odd unexpected guy trying to snog you," said Harry darkly.
"Oh, yes," said Hermione, sounding amused. "Did I not warn you? It's a bit, um,
"You nearly called me Harry," said Harry. Malfoy blushed.
"He's always such a dear after a nap." She tapped her wand on the teapot, prompting it to pour itself. "You'd never know he was such a terror most of the time. Takes after his mother, I think."
"I'm joking," said Harry.
Janine winked at Amit, who blinked back at her. Janine didn't seem terribly offended by the lack of response.
"I can show you how to work the payphone," said Dean. "You'd have to get a Magic Mobile if you wanted to receive calls, but you could probably buy one with your first pay."
Shev turned to set up her pen for a moment; Harry leaned around her to watch as she assembled the gun with nimble fingers, dropped a little ink into a pot, and carefully dipped the needle in. Then she turned, grinned at him, pressed his hand down into the arm rest and brought the tattoo gun to his skin. Harry breathed out sharply.
You frown. He's walking you back?
You step through the portrait after him.
You order a scone and leave feeling oddly unsatisfied.
He says nothing. He takes your hand. It's cold, but so is yours.
He could be taking you to Voldemort, you think. He could lead you into a room and you could be ambushed and sacked and killed right there on Hogwarts property.
Sometimes, he holds you. He wraps his arms around your waist and throws a leg over yours. His feet are always cold, but you don't mind much anymore. He likes to bury his face into your hair. You don't understand it, but you're not complaining about the warm breath on the back of your neck.
And then, one night, you do.
You say nothing.
For a moment you don't realize that he's spoken to you, and so he has to say it again, softer, and that voice, that almost a whisper, grabs your attention and holds it.
Friday. Nothing.
He doesn't touch you. He just looks at you. Blinks up at you with big grey eyes, and your heart pulls painfully.
"Stay with me. I'll protect you. Please. Please, stay with me."
His reply comes much later, when you're already inside him, as connected as any two people can be.
Green apples and spices and musk and vanilla.
Thursday. Nothing.
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
He's facing away from you, and you run a hand soothingly over his back. He shudders.
He opens his eyes, and your heart skips a beat.
His sleeves are rolled up, since cotton is not a potion ingredient.
Neither of you sleeps with a shirt on anymore.
He is beautiful. He is the most beautiful like this. Hair falling into his eyes, pouted lips, pink cheeks from the heat of the potion. Everything about him is clean and perfect. No harsh lines, anywhere. No freckles or stray hairs, no laugh lines or birth marks. Nothing but long lashes and smooth, smooth skin that you want to touch. It would be like silk. Softer than silk. And his lips...
You want to kiss him. You don't.
Lower.
Monday. Potions. Staring. Mouth. Eyes. Staring. Nothing. Sleep. Wake. Cold. Alone. Nothing.
He stops again at the top of the boys' staircase. He's turning back, looking at you, questioning.
Actually, that's not true. You have a lot of answers. "I wasn't," or "I was looking at Hermione," or "you had something on your face," but none of those find their way to your throat and out of your mouth.
He looks at you.
to head to the Astronomy Tower, he's already outside. The Fat Lady eyes you both curiously, but says nothing as you pass through.
"Sounds like you know what you want," he said, only a tinge of jealousy in his tone. "You're right not to settle for less than that. You deserve it."
to be ignored. After breakfast Harry returned to his hopeless attempt at reading a book in the drawing room, where he heard Malfoy pacing up and down the stairs at least six times. After the seventh, he wasn't entirely surprised to see his white-blond head poke around the drawing room door.
Harry spent the morning reading the same three sentences of his book repeatedly, scanning all the week's Pamphlets, and had finally taken to flipping through the Littlewoods catalogue and wondering if he needed a wristwatch when the door to the drawing room opened.
"And I just wonder," said Dean. "How things might have gone if I'd not left him to his shitty friends and his shitty life."
"Quite," said Hermione. "Would you like to read my draft sometime, Draco? You're really the only person in the house likely to take even the slightest interest."
"Look. Granger. I'm
"Of course not," said Ron, patting him on the arm until he settled back down. "None of us would let that happen. It's not the same as it was before. Draco's in a good place, he's got documents now and a Muggle job and enough Muggle knowledge that he won't kill himself with a toaster. He'll find somewhere to stay. And none of us are just going to cut him out, are we?"
"Thanks, Harry," he said, eyeing Malfoy. "And you'll come, will you, Malfoy?"
Harry grinned.
Harry wasn't entirely sure where that left him. He didn't think he wanted anyone he knew, and he didn't know how to meet someone he might want. He didn't even know what that someone would look like, what kind of person they'd be.
He turned around and walked out of the shop, slightly dazed, with a strange feeling bubbling in his chest. Malfoy ran to catch up with him in a huff.
"You'll deeply regret it," said Harry, dry.
Hermione huffed against Harry's side, as if she were offended by this. Pansy's eyes flicked briefly to Ginny, but then she waved a hand at Draco.
"Yep, we're all dying to enact vengeance on a homeless addict," said Harry, rolling his eyes. "Makes us feel really big and tough. Don't worry, they've all agreed you can stay."
He was purposeful now, intent on exploring him, running his teeth along Harry's lip, and Harry slid his hands into Draco's silken hair. Draco made a soft noise into his mouth, and Harry thought he might die at the sound of it, wanted to hear it again and again. He pressed himself closer. The hand that was not supporting Draco's weight slid along Harry's torso, working under his t-shirt. Harry could feel something firm and hot pressing against his hip, and the thought made him feel giddy.
Harry frowned, looking at the date. July 1995, the week before Harry's fifteenth birthday. He somewhat doubted that Lupin was on holiday with some lovely friends, then. Had he been in with the werewolves all that time?
"Women find your deodorant irresistable," she repeated.
Harry stared into Draco's eyes, flashing with rage and panic and — fear. It was
"She's not wrong," said Dean quietly. "Gin —"
Everyone shot each other horrified or disgusted looks, but Harry's eyes were on Malfoy. He was standing with Pansy and casting contemptuous looks at any Gryffindor who caught his eye. Pansy looked them all up and down.
and they did a little hair celebration dance, Dean and Seamus clapping as they whirled, and Harry stared at them and thought about what Luna had said, wondered at the possibility that love could, in fact, be an infinite resource, for all that it seemed distant and impossible to Harry.
Ron cracked up.
"And besides," said Harry, "Me and Gin — we're not like that. We're friends. I just want her to be happy."
"Right," said Malfoy, in a small voice. "Bye."
"Ah, here we go," said Malfoy, taking out a huge chunk of books with titles like
"Um," he said. "Malfoy. Could you give us all a minute?"
"Oh, screw you,
"I didn't," said Draco.
Class was finishing as they arrived, and they watched the class pass them with shifty eyes. Pansy gave Harry a death glare.
The idea made Harry uneasy. He couldn't really put his finger on why. It just felt stupid, taking something good and right and nice and trying to make it different. He'd managed not to lose Ginny over their failed relationship, but he didn't want to take the risk with Luna. They were just better as friends.
The waiter did not look thrilled to have to seat two scruffy-looking young men in sports gear at nine o'clock at night, but his demeanour improved immensely when Harry made a show of counting the cash in his wallet and then ordered a substantial amount of food and drink for them both. Fish was quiet for a while as he ate his meal, focused in a way Harry found familiar, but once he'd finished half his curry and most of the beer he wiped his mouth on his sleeve and said, "Alright, so who are you to Draco?"
"Right," said Harry. "I'm going to go and get the shopping. Because I leave the house. Want anything?"
"Apparently, this is called a mixtape." He waved it over his shoulder. "Although I'm not sure why, since it is clearly not a tape. Elliot made it for me, so I imagine it's a little eccentric, but it's the best I've got for now."
"I am," said Ron, looking stern. "But that has a shiny silver lining."
Luna was significantly longer than Dean had been. They were all debating whether to buy takeaway when she returned, Harry letting the debate wash over him with one ear out for the sound of Luna's return.
"Ready to talk about it yet?" said Hermione, patting the back of his head with cotton soaked in healing salve.
you, you know."
turned down.
weird," said Harry, pulling himself up to standing. He held out his hand. "Come on, then."
"I dunno," he said eventually, "This seems pretty Slytherin to me."
She looked older. She looked beautiful.
"You drive me wild with desire!"
A few more moments of silent eating, and then Malfoy sighed heavily and leaned over to set his bowl on the side.
Draco pulled his wrist away and stood up.
"Where was that energy when you swore you were too sick to help me with breakfast?" complained Ron, from his position lying on the floor by the hearth.
"That's ridiculous," said Harry, voice a growl. Pansy had reason to be
"Yeah, but it's Malfoy," said Neville, although not with any particular strength.
Adhikari's office was a long, narrow room on the ground floor. One end was dominated by a large desk, the walls around it crammed with bookcases, each one stacked with books and binders up to the ceiling. Harry had a momentary vision of Hermione dashing over to inspect them and smiled.
"Yes. When I was made to. I did it. I wasn't very good at it. I don't — I don't really want to hurt people. I know you might not believe me, given that I
"Okay," she said slowly. "But if you get lonely… you can always go down to the soup run. There's that Christmas eve giveaway going on, isn't there?"
"Well," said Seamus. "I
He'd been angry enough. He'd hated enough.
"Well, Malfoy was how I found out the bath didn't work."
Harry looked at Hermione's dear face, soft and worried and safe. He thought about how much she loved him. He ground his teeth and stared into a nearby bush, working up the courage to say it.
Harry slumped against the wall, mind whirling. He realised now that he
When Harry moved away from Blaise, Malfoy made his excuses and slid gracefully to her side. Blaise muttered something, and Malfoy laughed, leaning close on her arm.
"Can I call you Draco?" he asked, and Malfoy set down the knife and looked at him properly.
Then Draco's face hardened. He shoved Harry back; Harry stumbled, landing against Sirius's bedroom door with a thump.
"Are you ticklish?" said Harry, with dark delight.
Ginny didn't talk. She just watched Harry, anxious glasses and careful movements, and Harry realised he'd made a mistake. He shouldn't be here, intruding on Ginny's network, making it harder for her to be open. He should be talking to a Mind Healer, someone magical, someone who could have some frame of reference for the vast ocean of things he now wanted to talk about.
Thankfully, only Ron, Hermione and Ginny were left, obviously waiting for him. Ginny looked up as he arrived.

"Guys," said Harry, summoning his Serious Voice, the one he used when DA lessons got out of hand. "Give me the catalogue, please."
Malfoy's silver eyes held Harry's for a long time.
"So," said Hermione carefully. "What exactly happened?"
They'd all gone through so much. It was all so horribly unfair.
"So when the drink hit just now and I started feeling all loose and

Harry stared at her. He almost wanted to laugh.
"Seamus Finnegan!" shouted a voice from the second floor; Ginny poked her head out of Luna's window. "You better have a
"What's that smell?" said Dean, peering around the two boys in the doorway. "It's really..."
"Hello, Harry," said Blaise, as though they were old friends. "I was wondering if I might be permitted to visit Draco."
"Yes, well," said Hermione. "It's all very funny, but Harry could have been hurt. What were you thinking?"
"Although if there's a magical binding a little less extreme than that, I wouldn't say no."
"Thank you very much, Harry," she said, as Harry handed her the biro back. "I look forward to working with you."
Malfoy crossed his arms. "Obviously not," he said. "We had much better things to do."
Then there were the Pamphlets that appeared one particularly memorable Saturday morning. Harry didn't see them straight away, as his first thought was getting to the kitchen for coffee.
Harry read the second one diligently, making sure that Hermione, Dean and Seamus saw him doing it.
too fast to see.
of self-reflection?"
"You're offering to help me do up Malfoy Manor," he said. "
"Oh yeah!" said Andrew. "You went out with her too! She's really – er, a lovely person."
Harry sat down. What was Malfoy
Harry decided to take advantage of the distraction to quickly strip off his ancient jeans and step into one of his new pairs.
"Where?" said Harry sharply.
"I'm happy for you," he said.
Draco sat carefully on the edge of the bed beside him, supporting himself on his arms, and didn't look Harry in the eye.
"Oh, to be that Firebolt, eh?" said Dean, winking at Ginny, who was still very much blushing. She rolled her eyes at him.
They spent the rest of the evening going over the books and picking out bits that seemed interesting or that they might like. It was hard not to get excited at the thought of experiencing them very soon, and it was difficult to not kiss Malfoy right then and there and start something. That wasn’t the point, though, and he felt that if he had tried, Malfoy wouldn’t have stood for it. Probably. It was hard to tell with Malfoy. He’d been more than eager last time.
Potter watched him, quiet and intense, as though he could read Draco’s thoughts. “I can’t turn back time and take you with me,” he said. “But I wish I could have. I wish I hadn’t left you there. I left you under Voldemort’s control when you’d saved me by refusing to recognise my face, and I…” He trailed off, looking confused and lost. “I’m sorry.”
“But you weren’t the one walking off and refusing to listen,” Potter said, and Draco felt suddenly lightheaded.
… he felt the first twinges of fear.
“Eggs,” Draco agreed, laughing again. “And toilet paper, and whatever else they levitate up to my second-story window. This is ingenious. I can just hide behind the curtain and watch.”
Who was he fucking kidding.
“I’m joking, for Merlin’s sake. I’m not going to—” He ran a hand through his hair, his eyes a little wider than usual. “This is strange, Potter, we both know that. But… I’m here, I’m willing, and…” The careful, guarded look that Harry was so used to dropped completely away, and he was left with just Malfoy. For a moment, it was breathtaking. “And I don’t know what to do.”
Harry laughed nervously. “You only need to give one. What are you—”
He looked down just at the moment that Harry’s eyes opened again, looking up and searching Draco’s face. He smirked, his mouth still full of Draco’s cock, and sight of that wicked grin sent Draco soaring over the edge.
“Do you know what you did wrong?” Draco asked airily, part of him cringing because he knew so, so deeply that no matter what Potter had done to him, Draco had done far worse.
“Tomorrow,” Malfoy agreed. “Now, shut up. Every time you open your mouth, you ruin the mood.”
Potter suddenly frowned and looked around the room. “Why would a curse that was bound to an ancient symbol manifest as something modern and mechanical?”
Potter filled them in on the Barb situation, leaving them in equal parts horror and incredulity.
Draco cleared his throat, as uncomfortable as if this fight was genuine. Potter was too good at this; it felt real.
He should buy a Hawaiian shirt.
“I need a drink,” Draco moaned.
“No,” Draco breathed, shaking his head. “I passed fledgling stage in fifth year. After sixth year, no new symptoms should have shown themselves. Not unless—” He broke off, staring at Potter.
‘Sort-of friends,’ Malfoy echoed. ‘Maybe, I don’t know. Whatever. Regardless, you should go.’
‘I’m not sure I’ve quite accepted this is happening, yet. Am I dreaming? Is this a hallucination?’ Draco said, staring at Harry’s lips.
All right, maybe Hermione was on to something. Maybe.
‘Laptap sounds better. It rhymes.’
“Want to have sex?” she asked straight away, coming forward to put hands on his waist, startling him.
Draco sighed, and relented. ‘Good morning.’
It was a lot of people. Harry recognised a lot of Fred’s friends and family, and people from school. Lots of people he didn’t know, too. Some stood around in their robes, looking awkward like they didn’t quite know what to do—wasn't this a funeral? Aren’t they supposed to be reserved, be sad? Some really were sad, of course—still deep in their own mourning. And that was okay, too.
Draco took a steady breath before continuing, 'Still—despite the threat of harm—he fought as a hero, alongside the likes of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley, Neville Longbottom, and so many others.' Draco caught Colin's mother's wet eyes, she nodded at him. 'We are here today to honour Colin Creevey's memory. And, what better way to honour him, than to showcase our veterans' brilliant photography? After all, photography, as you may know, was among Colin's greatest passions.'
Yes … overall, it was a bit lonely, being surrounded by couples, teenagers who were living in a Voldemort-free world for once. Happy, carefree people. He so wished he could be the same.
The door opened quickly, letting out a blast of cinnamon-scented air, and a glaring amount of light onto his face.
Harry just ... well, he was hoping that Draco was different now. That he wasn't that same boy he'd been at Hogwarts anymore. Was it intuition? Or a near-pathological (and naive) desire to believe the best in people? Just because they were chatting amicably now?
Harry nodded, sucking in a breath. ‘I’m glad …'
He watched his former arch-rival gently cradle her jaw, lean down, and kiss the supposed love of his life, to the ringing cheers and claps of the crowd.
'Morning,' Draco said, trying to keep from smiling at the sight of him. He crouched down to pack his spare shoes into his bag.
‘Sorry, if I’d known you wanted to talk—Well, you know you can always shout for me, yeah?’ Harry began, as he walked into the den and sat down on the couch.
Draco smiled, and the edges of his eyes crinkled. ‘I really must.’
Harry nodded with that tiny smile—happy with his description.
‘It’s fine.’ Draco seemed to tense up. ‘I was going to cast Crucio.’
He was so warm, and smooth, and solid.
“Night, Draco,” Potter mumbled into his pillow.
Harry exhaled a breath. Good. He was relieved.
Harry Potter thought they might do that again sometime.
Bruce Lee was drop-kicking bad guys. Good for him.
'Oh. All right,' Harry looked a bit baffled. 'Pint for me, then, and house red for Draco.'
“Is that why you have glasses?”
Malfoy tilted his face closer. Breaths flitted over Harry, and Malfoy smelled of chocolate chip pancakes and syrup.
Harry snorted, shaking his head.
He pulled up a stool so that he could sit on Draco’s right. A long-black-haired witch was bent over his left arm, tattooing him. Harry took Draco’s right hand into his lap, and peered over to watch.
Potter sighed with relief as he voided himself. Draco was frozen, he stared at his own reflection in the mirror and willed himself not to blush, and not to look.
So she's got a few years left, yes. It was still difficult to fathom. But … now Draco wondered: why
“Budge over,” he said, frowning slightly.
'Pans.'
“Love, I’m going to order wine and snacks and we’re simply going to be together tonight, all right?”
“Ron? Nah, he doesn’t hate you.”
The walk back was decidedly less relaxing. Possibly due to one Ronald Weasley. Though Draco couldn’t fault him for any of it. They all had every right to hate him.
“I just wanted to...”
Harry leaned back in his chair, looking up at the cracked white ceiling. ‘Why’d you do it, then? Why did you send them? Why did you tell me …'
Thank you for reading all this way ❤️
Oh fuck. Had Ginny written him another ridiculous poem, just like that sodding valentine in his second year? Shit. Now he was going to have to have another awkward conversation with her.
Harry looked at Draco, his mouth pink and wet with saliva, his hair mussed up, and his eyes: bare, open, sparkling. Harry swiped a hand through Draco’s hair to smooth it. ‘Imagine if it were your cock in my arse.’
Even being vaguely near, he’d feel terrible pangs of grief. Overwhelming pangs. Sometimes he'd have to Alohomora an empty classroom and give himself a moment to slow his breathing, and wipe away tears.
“What’s with that look?”
“Who was it?” asked Hermione this time, looking serious and determined.
'Er, yeah. Just for dinner, and how about I come back after, yeah? We can talk and catch up then. Would that be all right?'
Pansy continued, her voice soft, ‘You
Neville frowned down at her, still clutching the object in his hand. “I think I did miss something.”
Malfoy laughed. “Fuck. Sure, sure I used to want those things.”
Harry sucked in a breath. His pulse raced.
‘Right. So you were just going to come here, and, what? Throw together a plan on the fly?’
'I look a bit startled.'
‘It’s alright,’ Harry said. ‘We made it through.’
it. 'Maybe
Draco worried the side of his lip with an incisor. ‘All right.’
find myself for a little while. So I left Barcelona because I didn’t want them to be able to find me again, and I ended up here.’
Draco blinked at him. 'You want to go see them? Now?'
, spun the bottle to find out who he’d get to kiss next. Harry narrowed his eyes at the man. He just didn’t like him—he was allowed to not like him. He just seemed so smug, the way he smiled like that—
“I … do.” They’d exchanged a couple letters—
“Hmm?” Draco asked, adjusting the hoodie, getting it into the proper place. He looked at Harry, who looked back at him with mouth clamped shut, pulling on the other sleeve.
Harry laughed. 'No. It's digital, you can transfer the pictures onto a computer. Share them to Facebook and whatnot.'
Hermione reached across the table, and grasped Harry's arm, smiling warmly. 'We'll always support you with whatever you want.'
Harry’s stomach took that opportunity to rumble, reminding him they’d skipped lunch. ‘We should eat.’
'All right?' Harry asked.
He ignored her question. ‘What happened? Is everyone okay?’ He looked around them—the castle seemed whole, just as they’d left it. From what he could see, anyway. But looks can be deceiving …
Madam Pomfrey busied herself with getting the potions ready, lining them up on a silver tray, as Harry slid, awkwardly, out from underneath the blankets.
He looked down at his own hand holding the contraption. He’d forgotten... “I don’t know how...” he trailed off.
‘Me too.’
“I think I do,” Draco said, closing his eyes briefly. “It was easy because it meant I was special—part of a superior group. It appealed to my sense of pride. He told me I was better than Muggles, Muggleborns and Halfbloods—simply for having been born a Malfoy—and I accepted it.”
, he told it. He’d only just ended a relationship. These feelings couldn’t be real. They were … something like rebounding. Or, mistaking a newly-forming friendship for something they weren't.
Harry shot him that lopsided grin, the one that made it difficult to breathe.
'Hmm?'
) not be some ordinary fan. Instead, this might all be … personal. But everyone he knew was in the United Kingdom (not including Charlie in Romania, but … surely it wasn’t him either). So, really, it did not make sense.
Harry’s face felt very hot. It might be the spell. It might be embarrassment. Blushing. And all he could see was white-blond eyelashes and closed eyelids.
'Oh?'
This was all so lovely.
“Alright,” Draco answered again, feeling a lump form in his throat.
Draco sucked in a breath.
‘Okay, let’s do this,’ Harry said, getting up and pulling down the blanket so that he could climb in. He took off his glasses, and set them on the nightstand on his side of the bed.
Ron shrugged. “Sure.”
Harry realised he wasn’t hugging back. He lifted his arms to wrap gently around Draco’s back. ‘Are you okay?’ he asked softly.
A muscle in Harry’s jaw tensed. He rubbed at it, absentmindedly. Was he just jealous? Because Malfoy had something Harry didn’t—something Harry was finding he wanted more than anything. A real partner … someone to really love.
Shit, shit, fuck.
Harry smiled, relieved.
Okay … he wouldn’t ... Draco shut his eyes, and went back to dancing. ‘Oops you, think that I’m sent from a-bo-o-o-ve. I’m not that innocent.’
The girls laughed.
. This was a mistake. He wondered if he could pretend to be sick and get to go back to Hogwarts.
Harry grinned, grabbed his quill and wrote:
Draco went out the door first and led them down the empty, nondescript, and very grey hallway towards the lifts. He stopped without warning, turned, and enveloped Harry in his arms—burying his face in Harry’s neck, holding him tight.
‘Then don’t,’ said Draco, simply.
Draco sat up. “Merlin? How on earth do they know about Merlin?”
But, that didn’t matter, now did it? Another thing he’d come to terms with over the summer: he’s a tremendous bisexual. There are Chos and Ginnys, along with Charlies and Olivers out there, after all.
'That's very sweet, Harry,' said Hermione, smiling at him.
Eventually, the loud song that played after the story was finished startled Potter awake.
Potter wanted Draco’s stupid poem. It gave him a little thrill—and Draco almost considered giving it back to him, so that he could see his face as he read Draco’s silly, idiotic, yet undeniably truthful, thoughts.
'Not yet,' Harry agreed, planting kisses on every spot on the side of Draco's face that he could reach.
Harry rubbed a thumb over the condensation of his glass, making a streak. “Er, I’m just curious but … what would’ve happened if I’d dropped my hand from your shoulder during that spell?”
‘He pulled my hair. He said mean things about my parents.’
Harry’s breath had rapidly picked up. The room was getting fuzzy around the edges. His ears were ringing.
'Thank you,' he shouted, taking it.
'Ah. Did she,' Draco said, looking around the room for the offending subject. He found her, across the room, chatting with Morgan. She could've at least warned him.
“Psst.”
‘Fuck, yes.’ Malfoy traced the outline of Harry’s locket scar with his finger. ‘But I’ll need my things.’
him...”
He blinked at Malfoy. That all sounded … reassuring.
And Draco’s self-worth was hanging by a thread as it was. He was not going to be able to survive a weak of ridicule, of fighting with Potter. He’d deserve it, of course, but he certainly wasn’t in a good place for it right now.
Draco squeezed his hand again.
He blinked at him. 'Oh, not like
At least there weren’t many people around, as getting out didn’t take too long at all.
Draco followed him as they wound through the hallways, back into Luna’s main party room.
He smiled back. ‘Thank you, Pans.’
Draco sucked in a breath through his mouth. “Obviously what?”
Coincidently, or not, there was one last package for Harry. At least, any more mail would have to find its way to Grimmauld Place, or wait for him at Hogwarts until autumn.
Malfoy did not look down to where Harry was indicating. Instead, he exhaled slow. ‘Wearing pants hardly counts as being dressed.’
Other times, Harry tried to seek him out, but every time the opportunity seemed to strike, Hermione found something to distract him with. Things like: an essay due in a week, a personal favour (‘Please, Harry, will you bring this box of cookies over to Hagrid? I would, but I’m just so swamped with schoolwork.’), or an appeal to spend more time with Ron (‘He’s feeling a bit neglected, Harry.’)
“Malfoy?” he asked.
“I … thanks, ‘Mione.” Harry took a breath. “Okay … it’s just—I think it might not be working out. With her.” He winced.
Potter hummed a response, and took the cup straight from Draco’s mouth.
He sat with that. “People think it’s wrong.”
Harry kept going, starring at the journal now, furrowing his brow, speaking wildly, ‘You kissed Terry Boot, you kissed Hermione. You wouldn’t kiss me.’
Harry groaned. He was fucking this up.
“Why are you dressed like that?” Potter asked.
Morgan barked out a laugh, then covered her mouth. 'Really?
Pansy broke away, and awkwardly mumbled a, ‘Well then,’ before nodding sharply just the once, and hurrying off back to the Hufflepuff table. Her friend grinned at her, following Pansy’s hasty retreat—while looking very proud.
He scanned the messages. Some were apparently website links to romance novels, and underneath, Harry and Pansy seemed to be chatting about the books.
Draco broke down again. It was the way she’d said it—like she meant it. Like he hadn’t just trampled all over her dreams, like he wasn’t a horrible person for tricking her into marrying him. Sobs choked out of him, as she held him close—whispering kindnesses he wasn’t sure he deserved.
Harry's breaths came out in sharp gasps.
“Do you like it?” Harry asked.
So, he was going back to Hogwarts.
Ron, on the other hand, raised his eyebrows. ‘Well … that explains it, I guess.’
Harry attempted a smile. “Okay. Yeah, we should find her and talk to her.”
Malfoy nodded at the table itself; his long fingers wrapped around his mug. ‘Luna …'
‘And then you’d asked Cho Chang to the Ball.’
“Fine. Okay. Maybe I’ll check it out myself, then.”
‘Oh Harry! Are you alright, were you hurt?’ Hermione said.
'Salt is a very good gift. It's Ibiza's most important natural resource, there's a huge salt reserve here.'
'Yeah, all right.' Harry lifted his mobile up so he could see it properly, and tapped the buttons several times. 'Just sending him a text,' he explained.
‘Try not to stare at my arse, Harry,’ Draco quipped back, with a knowing lift of his eyebrow.
laughing at me.’
In the end, he just smashed the thing against the bed. Miraculously, it turned on. He kept smashing, and somehow found himself watching a blue screen and a castle appear.
‘Ew.’ Parvati grimaced.
“Oh! Well, that’s great.”
sorry. I was so stupid, and brash, then. I just didn’t think things through …'
Draco just exhaled slowly.
he thought he knew who Malfoy was. But maybe he’d been completely wrong, and that was probably a good thing.
Harry’s mouth opened a fraction, and he furrowed his brow. Draco felt a mad urge to reach over and smooth away the wrinkles there.
‘I don’t hate you,’ he answered.
Harry didn’t know what to say.
Ah. He found he didn't mind admitting it.
Draco pinched his mouth closed, staring over at Potter.
A round black and white photo of her stern face showed up as the number one option. She looked rather elegant.
, after all. Potter and Malfoy. They weren’t meant to get along.
'Mm?'
At least, Ron hadn’t told him he need to learn any Italian. It was an area tourists went to, after all.
“Because it’s how I feel,” Draco said with a miserable shrug.
She huffed and shot him a look. ‘You are absolutely no fun.’
Reluctantly, Vector nodded, with a thinly-veiled scowl. She spun around and stalked out.
'Yes, he'd taken his face make-up off at that point. So, er, we went out for a few drinks with the …
He peeked his head into the living room, and saw Ron and Hermione. Somehow, he wasn’t surprised to see them standing there, grinning at him. Hermione sent him a little awkward wave. Harry just rolled his eyes, smiling, and went back to the kitchen to fix two more cups.
Neville asked, “What do you think of that funny ball, though? It’d said ‘children’ in my own voice.”
“Ah, we’ve got company,” said Ginny dryly.
Once paid up, they exited into the hallway, went down the lift, and emerged into the bustling street.
“I love you.”
He nodded slowly. ‘Anytime.’ At least, he hoped he could. He’d certainly try, whenever needed. 'And if you want to talk more ...'
She looked at him a little longer than she had to. “All right, dear. Well, I’m going to look around for things we can put in our new cabinet.”
It wasn’t.
Draco scowled. He resented that word, as if Potter could be the same word you ascribe to a roast, or a plate of mashed potatoes. ‘No, no I would not say that.’
Malfoy took a deep breath. “Salazar … I thought the furthest we’d go was Edinburgh.”
Potter looked almost amused. ‘You saved me, in the Manor then. You’re good, and you’re brave. You’re smart, and rather sassy. And ... you've got a fine arse.’
'I did it for him,' Draco admitted through gritted teeth, as he very much did not look at Harry. He didn't want him to think he preferred … Merlin ... not that there was anything inherently
'Briefly.'
Harry tore his eyes away, instead looking at Draco’s face, with an air of hesitation. He nodded. “Only if you...”
Harry stared back, unsure of what to do here.
“Yeah. See you later.”
“Yes?”
‘No! Please, Harry—’
What were they doing? Draco would be hard-pressed to come up with an answer.
'But you … you seem to have a pretty hands-on amount of experience. I mean, when you're writing about it. It's all so vivid, like you've done a lot of … sexual activities.'
And he was still upset about Potter’s childhood. A cupboard?
‘But it said something about the contents being how they really felt.’
Merlin. Dramatic, much?
They looked at each other.
‘I was tired.’
“Um …” Harry said, after a bit. “Don’t you think it’s strange that we’re … I don’t know, getting along?”
“Well, yeah,” Potter said with a slight shrug of his shoulders. “It was a bit different to what you went through, but I had to adjust my worldview all the same.” Potter smiled, just a bit. “The Muggles who raised me—my aunt and uncle—they tried to make me believe I was a freak, that I was worthless and a burden—”
These were all the “right” things to say. The polite things. Harry wasn’t sure Malfoy meant it. He had no idea how Malfoy
'I'll just be off, then,' Harry said quietly, stepping towards the door.
Draco couldn’t open his eyes.
Right. Harry did, he rested his right hand lightly on Malfoy’s robed and slender shoulder.
They fell into a silence again. It was easy to do. Didn’t Potter see that he should stop trying to spark a conversation? (Or whatever the hell he was attempting.) His efforts were futile. Pointless. The two of them were too different. They
He felt good. He hadn’t wanked like that in a long while. Hadn’t had much of a sex drive at all, really.
So Harry tore the wrapping off. It
Draco Malfoy was sat with the First Year Hufflepuff again. The sticker girl. He had his hands in her hair, folding those thick black strands into a French braid.
. He tried to avoid talking about it — the face people pulled made him deeply uncomfortable.
"Yes," said Malfoy darkly. "Well. No. They seem clearer. But not in a
His hair was bright blue today. His chubby limbs were bigger, less baby-like than Harry remembered, and Harry realised it had been far too many months this time.
to say it. Sometimes it comes out before I can stop it. I've been chastised so many times, told I need to be
"Problem, Malfoy?" Seamus's voice rang out, bright with false cheer. Malfoy was silent for a moment.
“Thank you. I… yes. I will.” He frowns suddenly, eyes dropping again to the sweet wrapper on the floor. “Why didn’t it do anything?”
Harry blew out a sigh and leaned back against the bedframe just as a long, tremulous moan spilled through the door. Harry groaned, snagging the topmost pillow and attempting to smother himself with it.
The next day dawned with a complete reversal of Harry’s mood, however.
Those times were gone now. He trusted more easily, could interact with his emotions more freely. In some ways, he needed Eleanor less—and by needing her less, he was able to heal more, heal deeper than before.
“Are you sure these hoops are low enough?” Draco asked, looking at the highest hoop which stood at eye level.
“Nah. Nothing that mattered.”
“What are you talking about?” He looked around at the lot of them, confused and bleary-eyed.
And in taking that away, Draco was left to see what lay beneath.
That’s when it hit him. It was a soft realisation, where most of Draco’s truths in life had been harsh and jagged, and it was perhaps that more than anything else that made it real. Because when had Draco ever been given anything soft? Soft things led to disaster, and this could only lead to the most earth-shattering disaster of them all, so it had to be true.
Harry took a sip from the bottle, coughed up most of his insides, and then took a longer pull now that he knew what he was in for. “Don’t really fancy being an Auror,” he said, passing the bottle across the floor to Neville. “Sorry, it’s not much more exciting than that. I figure I can’t go wrong with a Transfiguration specialisation, and I can work the rest out later on.”
His breathing began to slow, his eyes drifting closed as they just held each other, warm beneath the stars, heartbeats thudding gently against each other’s chests. It should have been awkward, but Harry’s emotions were far too warped these days for him to bother with that. He didn’t care.
“This charade.” Draco waved a hand vaguely through the air.
Harry
Draco ran his hands through Potter’s hair, moaning helplessly against his lips as their kiss deepened, each frantically trying to leave their mark on the other, knowing with horrible certainty that this was it, all they’d ever get. It wasn’t fair. The last few days felt like weeks, and Draco had wasted them all. He’d wanted to know more about this strange, bitter version of the boy he’d known, but he hadn’t listened when Potter was practically screaming it to him. His empty flat, his stilted friendships, and the mystery that had drawn Draco back into his life what felt like a lifetime ago—Draco was only now beginning to understand what it all meant, and he was just going to walk away without any clue what he was losing.
It was a slow build, and then when it crested it was entirely too fast. Harry’s hand fell to the sheets again, and he twisted them as he came, crying out louder than he normally would into the quiet room.
They were closer than before, Draco leaning back against the sink and Potter propped on one hand beside him, almost caging him in. When had they moved?
It took him a second to recognise the face, but he soon realised Zach Smith had just stumbled in, drunk as a skunk and with his arms wrapped around the shoulders of two older women. It seemed as though he must have bumped into a family who were on their way through to the bistro. They all stood in the doorway arguing with each other while the mother shielded her children indignantly.
It had taken him all year to work out what the cabinet was missing. A broken Vanishing Cabinet that Vanishes items into a state of perpetual limbo—he’d spent months looking at it from the wrong angle. He’d tried to repair the connection between the two, so that it stopped Vanishing things to the wrong place, but even once the connection was repaired it kept failing him.
Potter nodded, looking the opposite of confused, which bothered Draco on levels he didn’t want to acknowledge. “And when a child does accidental magic, it accesses the core of their magical self, using the blood as a conduit, the same way as an adult does wandless magic.”
Malfoy,
Potter had got himself caught up in a Veela soulbond. And like a responsible wizard lover, he’d come straight to his mate’s doorstep to resolve it.
“Yeah, you’re probably right.” His brow furrowed, like he was trying to comprehend something that was just out of reach.
Eleanor regarded him. “Why do you think that?”
Potter unscrewed the lid from the container in his hand and studied the green dust inside. Draco thought that might be the end of the conversation, but just before he turned away, Potter looked up at him.
“I’m sorry, were you dropped on your head as a child?”
But the more Draco watched him, the more he wasn’t sure it was that simple. There were signs that it could be war flashbacks, but there also seemed to be something more—something that simmered below the surface in a way that the harsh, jolting reminders of a war didn’t tend to do.
“I bet you do.”
“George said no one knows why you became an Unspeakable.”
“Dobby!” someone sobbed, and Potter’s face split into anguish.
They stopped talking after that. Potter created a path of green cogs that twisted up most of the wall, and Draco discovered a pink pathway that circled the room several times. It was silent as they worked, Draco noting down the readings from the spell, and Potter monitoring the anchor to make sure they weren’t in danger. Draco felt like he was attuned to Potter’s every move, like every breath and every brush of their arms against each other was a conversation he’d never bothered to listen to before.
Potter frowned. “What should I do when she realises I haven’t?”
“Good?” Draco asked above him. He was holding him by both hips, massaging small circles with his thumbs as Harry got used to the sensation of being stretched.
“Seriously though,” Potter said, shoving a large tome aside and glaring at Draco. “I think we really do need to improve your wards.”
After sweeping his hand in a wide arc, which seemed to Draco as though it did nothing but send faint sparkles floating up into the sky, Potter slowly turned the handle and opened the door.
“Did you want to sleep in my bed tonight?” Malfoy asked quietly.
Potter glanced at him sideways. “Well, they’ve got each other, don’t they?” he said with a shrug. “It’s different. Everything’s different, out in the real world. Away from Hogwarts.”
“I suppose,” she said after a pause. Then, “Your hair is ruined.”
“We’ve got to get back, Morgan. We’ll leave you to it. I’m glad you’re all safe.”
And the curse had locked the doors.
“What’s going on?”
His eyes snapped open, and with the careful, deliberate grace of the utterly smashed, he set the Firewhiskey down on the coffee table, out of reach. Even in his imagination, he ought to know better. That wasn’t how this scene with Potter would go. No, because Potter was convinced that Draco was an arsehole. He was certain that despite all the painful lessons of Draco’s youth, the fact that he was blunt and snide meant that Draco hadn’t learned a goddamn thing, that he was still the idiotic sixteen-year-old eager for his Father’s approval. And yes, all right, perhaps his sense of humor was a little sharp, and maybe he sometimes took a joke too far, but that was just
Astoria turned, looking over to find Draco just standing there. His eyes focussed in on her, bringing him out of his thoughts, as she tilted her head, like she was concerned or trying to figure something out.
He edged even closer, and Malfoy’s breath hitched. Harry went for it, he leaned in, and brushed their lips together.
He stroked himself faster.
She quirked an eyebrow.
‘Then don’t go.’
Harry pulled away from his mouth to get a look at his face—which just made Malfoy frown. “What! No you don’t!”
‘Try some.’
Malfoy stared at him for a beat, his expression betraying nothing. But there was an intensity to him. “Alright.” He held out his hand.
'What should we do today?' Draco swiped a ripped-off chunk of naan over the plate, to soak up some juices, and took a big bite.
. 'Grab one of the presents for you next.'
She looked him in the eye, trying to gage if he were telling the truth. He was.
He Accio’d another mug. And waited. Sipped the tea. Tried to keep any unwanted feelings from creeping up. He was
‘You’re supposed to say “hello”, Draco.’
Draco let out another breathy laugh. “Ah.” He hesitated. “I suppose... we could, though?”
Harry looked down at his plate, miserably, and continued eating. Purple tasted like hamburger, for some reason.
“We could...” Harry licked his lips, Draco watched. “We could do some more of that later, though.”
She laughed. “So, I should just tell her how I feel, that’s what you’re saying?”
“In a towel. This morning.”
Thanks for reading ❤️
Hermione smiled, betraying a hint of amusement which Harry did not quite appreciate. “That they are, that they are.”
Harry opened his eyes, and looked at Neville. ‘What do you know about Draco Malfoy these days?’
Climbed over the bench.
Harry sucked in a breath. ‘Come here and kiss me, then.’
Malfoy froze.
Potter smiled a little. ‘You seem to have found yourself.’
A happy, breathy laugh, and Harry’s hand on his shoulder shifted, until Draco could feel warm fingertips gently grazing the back of his neck. ‘It’d be romantic if we kissed right now, wouldn't it?’
‘How was yours, Harry?’ Dean asked, turning to him, with a friendly expectant smile on his lips.
Draco babbled on about his favourite book series, and Harry tried to keep up. He gathered it was some kind of fiction/fantasy about someone who makes mountains? And has an enemy called Midnight who goes around eating said mountains? Then they talked of television (which Draco had never seen), and, before long, the sun had disappeared from the sky, and above them instead was a canopy of navy blue and a sprinkling of stars.
You're still not exactly sure how it happened, or why he keeps coming back.
She tossed him an apologetic glance. “Sorry, could you spell that.”
Malfoy pushed up to look at him. His expression was so relaxed, so open. More so than Harry had ever seen him. “Yeah. Very much.”
. More time to have Draco to himself, then.
“Pansy—” Whatever she thought was normal was sure to be skewed somehow.
Harry leant down and kissed Draco again. Salazar, it was wonderful to be kissed so much. Harry broke away to say, “We should go to your bench on the hiking trail one more time.”
He tried Exploding Snap with Ginny in the corner of the common room.
When he swam back to shore, he found Potter lying on the small pebbles, wearing pants.
‘It doesn’t matter if you’re any good. You’re Harry Potter. Everyone would watch anyway.’
‘I’d like to, you know, date you. That is, if you do,’ said Potter.
Pansy was well in her rights, as was Harry. But it still made him feel like he'd been left out of something. Ah well. Best not to dwell.
‘Different circumstances, of course. I struggled with my own identity because I was told I was a Wizard one minute, and the sodding “Boy Who Lived” the next. And every single year at school had me risking my life, fighting a war,
She got up and sauntered over to see what he was looking at. ‘It’s a rune. Gyfu, meaning gift or generosity.’
Harry shrugged, an unhappy sort of shrug.
Harry bit at his bottom lip. ‘They were
'Well let me know if you need anything.'
“Very good, here you are,” she said, placing a biro in front of him.
'Hush. You can use them, so you can work
She beamed up at him. “Thank you!”
When Draco returned, he found Blaise and Pansy in the lobby, sprawled out on leather chairs by the fireplace, chatting happily. He plopped himself down on the floor in front of Pansy’s, and she carded her fingers through his hair, sending goose bumps up the back of his arms. He shut his eyes and savoured the feeling. He felt safe. Protected. Potter and Weasley weren’t likely to approach him there.
“Grip me,” Draco breathed. “Stroke.”
'Perfect. Press your "on" switches now. For everyone else, the button has the following symbol.' Angelpreet drew a line and most of a circle on the chalkboard behind her desk. 'They may be on different areas of your computer, depending on the make and model you are using. But our computers here have them on the top of the computer console. Press them now, and if you're having any trouble, please raise your hand and I'll be right 'round.'
“Huh? Sorry—what?" Harry asked, blinking, coming back into himself.
Harry pulled away, and thumbed at Draco's cheekbone. 'What does this mean?'
He turned around and noticed his unmade bed next to Potter’s made one. It seemed a depressing sight, a symbol of his solitude, so he made up his own bed, even though he knew he didn’t have to. Housekeepers came around every day to tidy up, he’d been told.
Draco looked at the countertop, and spotted two steaming mugs of tea sitting there.
He swallowed, and sighed. “It’s not just Malfoy. I’m comparing myself to you and Ron, to Neville and Hannah, to Mr and Mrs Weasley … Ginny and I aren’t at all like that.”
And Harry's hands found Malfoy’s arse. Squeezing it, pressing him in closer.
Harry wiped his eyes again, with the base of his palm, and Draco pretended not to notice.
He wasn’t sure he wanted to know. This conversation had abruptly taken a strange, awkward turn. Draco couldn’t very well say anything about Harry this time, now could he? Not now that they knew their identities. And Harry didn’t really want to hear about Draco’s fantasies about other people. He wasn’t
“Ah when I was that age—” began the man.
They both stood, and the dock rocked a little. Draco feared for a moment that his legs would give out—he felt a bit noodle-y. But, thankfully, he was able to make it to solid land, one step at a time, breathing in and out carefully, with Potter trailing behind him.
Harry went straight into a toilet stall, locked the door, and leaned against the wall. He tried to school his breathing—it was too fast. From running off quickly, probably. And not because he was upset.
'I'm game,' Draco said. He was definitely well on his way to intoxicated, and dancing was about all he wanted to do.
Sometimes Harry feared Voldemort was still in his head.
Yes, it was Luna who had joined them. ‘Well, hello everyone.’
“It was a fun night. I had fun," Draco said, stepping forward some more.
‘Harry—you really can’t. Your place is here, with them,’ Draco said, nodding towards the Weasleys.
Harry snorted again. Jesus. Was Draco Malfoy funny? “I’ll tell you a secret.”
Harry nodded, still smiling.
‘Yeah. You know when you want something for so long? So long you’re convinced it’s impossible?’ Draco said with a slight smile, looking down at Harry’s lips.
“Yeah,” Harry said, straightening himself and looking around. Malfoy’s hand dropped from his elbow. The alleyway was rather dark, yes, but it led out into a warmly-lit square—and bodies were moving past.
The waiter left. And then it was just silence between them.
He nodded. “I’d like that.”
Malfoy rolled them over, so that he got to be on top, looking down.
Harry nodded, looking at Malfoy’s mouth. “Alright.”
He reached back to turn off the lamp on the nightstand, plunging the room into darkness. The only light came from the television.
Then, they stepped outside into the elements, into the quiet dark. Harry breathed the fresh, wintery air deep into his lungs.
She shot Draco one more meaningful look over her shoulder as she waltzed out of his office.
Draco folded his hands on the table. “I’m in this class as part of my probation, Potter,” he said quietly.
'Got something for me to wear?'
‘It’s actually pretty brilliant, you know? Wow, why do you keep scarves
The walk on the dirt path up to the Burrow’s front door was a sombre affair. They were returning without one important person.
He created a sodding account, under the name "Peter McDonald".
He glanced at himself in the mirror. He looked a bit better today—more rested, more relaxed. And the outfit was pretty good. Merlin—he still couldn’t believe Pansy had gotten him to wear some of Potter’s clothes. It almost seemed... too intimate a thing. Didn’t Potter realise that at all? Of course not. He was straight. It was just like doing a mate a favour, when they had nothing else to wear. Not that Draco thought they were really mates, just, approximations of friends, perhaps. Acquaintances who no longer fought like cats and dogs—
Draco hummed. ‘Well, now you can, I suppose.’
Thank you for reading so far ❤️ Feedback is very welcome
Blinking up at the ceiling, Draco replied, ‘I suppose I’ve always known that I preferred men. Though I didn’t know what it really meant, or what it entailed, until Hogwarts. Until I went to the library and looked up the words I’d heard father say, or the words Blaise had said. When I read about it, it made sense. It explained my feelings.’
‘Yes,’ she said, thrusting a finger at his chest accusingly. ‘He’s very vulnerable these days. He’s been through a lot, you know? And you lot decide to play a trick on him—’
“It’s off the gift registry at Marks and Spencer.”
‘Haven’t the faintest,’ Harry replied softly. Should he know? Is he supposed to just
Harry handed it over, and Malfoy forked up some his food and handed it back. They were careful to not brush fingers. A splat of white sauce dropped on Harry's pizza, and then he took a bite.
Harry let out a breathy laugh. ‘I see. Well I suppose it’s a similar idea. Just … smaller.’
Harry furrowed his brow. ‘We’ve learnt so much about one another through the diary … And he always has something supportive to say, something that helps me, and allows me to see things from a different perspective. I don’t know, a more … grounded perspective, a sensible perspective, I think. He’s become … a real friend.’
'N’en parlez plus.’
A crack of thunder boomed from the distance, making him jump.
Harry instantly felt a bit guilty thinking it, but that was all soon forgotten, when Draco leaned in conspiratorially, and muttered in his ear, “What
She floated after him, and found the crumpled paper, just down the corridor from the Gryffindor entrance.
Harry shrugged, flattening out his roll of parchment on the table. ‘Was fine.’
-swears
‘Ron!’ chastised Hermione.
Potter dodged the movement and blasted Draco’s head again, grinning.
Fuck …
‘Great aunt,’ Draco finished, looking at Harry with wide eyes.
Someone was shouting something, and cars were whizzing down the road nearby.
‘You actually have flour?’
Draco’s hands tightened on Harry’s arse, halting Harry’s attempt to grind against his mouth. ‘Please what, Harry?’ he said between featherlight kisses to Harry’s arsehole.
“What?” The prat, he
“Oh, I see,” Harry said. He didn’t. “Have you ever had a cat?”
Draco took his more hesitantly.
Draco shrugged.
Tears welled in Harry’s eyes, but he was unseeing.
“Well, er, that was all I wanted to say. Um … thank you. And, good night, then.” God, why did he have to be so bloody awkward?
The room was fairly full of people—people Harry didn’t recognise at all.
'Okay,' Harry said gently. 'I don't think I snore or anything. Sometimes I have nightmares, but they've become more rare lately. After therapy.' He shot Draco a smile.
Draco raised his eyebrows, as he simultaneously realised Pansy was rocking side to side a bit. “I’ve been with you the whole time. Pansy...” he lowered his voice. “Are you drunk? Off two drinks?”
He let himself fall forwards onto Draco, kissing his mouth messily, wetly. ‘You’re amazing’, he murmured against his lips.
. It wasn't always easy—but it was good.
“That is none of your business or concern.”
Potter smiled at him.
Hermione laughed, again. Harry didn’t see what was so funny. “Okay, you definitely fancy him.”
Draco tilted it towards his breakfast. Sure, it was missing a couple bites, but it was still beautiful. Draco paused, and adjusted his mug to the side, then moved the cutlery to the left a bit.
‘I’ll get it, shall I, Harry?’ Neville called from the living room.
Draco was watching him with his head resting on a hand. He shrugged—a quick upward motion of his shoulders without lifting his head from his hand. ‘It’s nice having you do all the work.’ A lazy smile grew on his mouth.
There was nowhere in the world he'd rather be, than right there, in this moment. The night felt like it could last forever, if he could will time itself to stop. And in the moment, he felt he just might have that power.
What—come back once a year in the summer for another few days of inserting himself into Harry's life?
Harry took a deep breath. “Okay, now we’ve established the ‘no falling in love with Draco Malfoy’ rule. How was your Christmas?”
‘It’s not like we’re strangers. We’re next-door neighbours. It’s already practically like living together.’
Draco’s French friend looked back at him over her shoulder. ‘Voulez-vous sortir?’
Ginny rolled her eyes. ‘Okay. I guess so. I hear he’s marginally better this year.’
So, Harry told him all about it—from the decor, to the food, to how Malfoy had cried at the first sight of his bride—over their paperwork. It was tedious work, and it helped to chat while they worked.
Draco glanced down, and they both stopped to admire his thick oatmeal-coloured socks, one seemingly longer than the other. ‘I did. Sock-knitting is my next focus.’
Suppressing a heavy exhale, he asked, 'Yes?' He waited for her to tell him something horrible—like she'd invited Harry Potter to marry him, or something similar.
Harry huffed—not quite a laugh but close enough. “Nah. Just didn’t sleep enough, I guess.” He slumped into his chair, with extra-large coffee in hand, and began pulling out the stack of files from his ‘to do’ pile, opening the one on the top.
, even. But to see one for himself was no easier.
'I will never do it again, if I can help it.'
Draco sucked in a breath.
'Good.'
‘It …
‘Mm,’ Harry answered, snuggling deeper into his pillow.
Draco bit at his bottom lip, staring down at the journals. ‘Well, if I’d got your message earlier … when we returned …'
Draco pulled him down against his crotch, and bucked his hips.
Draco turned to watch him grab a handful of Floo-powder, and arrange himself in the hearth. Harry looked up at him for a brief moment, and shot him a little smile.
; the room had started to shrink in on itself.
Draco laughed, and laughed. Tears welled up in his eyes. “Your love is an inspiration,” he repeated, breathlessly, making himself laugh again.
