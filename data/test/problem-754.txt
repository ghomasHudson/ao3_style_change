He takes a breath to taunt you further, so you squeeze him tighter and bite on the mark until whatever he wanted to say is forgotten to the moment. You hold out your hand and summon a chair, propping up Malfoy’s leg to open him to you.
Draco snaps his eyes open and Harry briefly mourns the loss of post-orgasmic Draco, but happily welcomes back his tetchy and contrarian boyfriend. To Harry’s surprise, Draco doesn’t refuse. Instead, he huffs like he’s entirely put out and sits up. He roughly yanks off his shirt, avoiding Harry’s gaze and carefully turning his left arm inward until he’s able to flop down on his stomach and tuck his arm beneath Harry’s pillow.
It was surreal how they went from ripping each other apart to enjoying each other’s company. Some days, Harry wondered if he was only imagining his friendship with Malfoy. Then Malfoy would say something particularly insulting, shocking Harry and cementing that this was reality.
Each day before he left for his meetings with Malfoy, Sirius encouraged Harry to head out, go out with friends, do anything. Each time Harry told him the standard response.
Draco squinted at Potter, unsure where this was going. He made a gesture with his hands for Potter to continue.
“Jeez, your stressed? I couldn’t tell,” Malfoy responded, rolling his eyes. “Relax, Potter, Father said he would win your case. Trust him.”
The group laughed, spending the remainder of lunch chatting. Luna and Ginny got on quite well, and Harry was happy to let them run most of the conversation, only contributing when it was asked of him. When the bell rang for the end of break, Harry bid goodbye to Ginny and Luna, who barely spared a second to say goodbye to him, before continuing their heated discussion about flower crowns of all things.
When he arrived back home, Sirius was sitting on the couch. He was staring at the television which was turned off.
“He isn’t with them anymore, Remus. I’ve had him for months now, and I’m working on making sure he never has to go back there.”
Minutes seemed to pass. Sirius watched as Harry gradually began to relax. Finally, Harry smiled, a small, timid smile. He uncurled his tight body, spreading his legs out. He chewed his lips as he thought over his next words.
“In the midnight hour, I can feel your power,” Sirius sang along to the words, his voice growing louder and deliberately bad. “Just like a prayer, you know I’ll take you there.”
When Sirius failed to notice him, Harry opened his mouth to force the words out. Before he managed though, he heard a small boof, and looked down to see Snuffles spread across the couch and Sirius’s lap. He was cramped in the small space but looked in no way close to moving. He wagged his tail as he lolled his head back to look at Harry.
The two walked a few steps away from the boy and dog.  Harry stood with the rope in his hand. Snuffles was sticking low to the ground and it wasn’t long before he was planted to the grass like he had been the concrete indoors.
The rest of the day passed relatively quick. When the final bell rang, Ron and Hermione both headed off towards the buses, bidding goodbye to Harry who made his way to the bathroom. He muttered as he walked through the near empty halls, thinking about all the things he needed to talk to Sirius about. He was just about to walk out the entrance and onto the field, when a hand wrapped around his arm, jerking him into the corner of the corridor.
“No, I just meant I didn’t expect you to get it for me. I had money,” Draco looked ready to snap at him again. “But thank you for getting it for me. I don’t think I’ve ever actually had popcorn from the cinemas. It always smells so nice though.”
Blood rushes through Draco’s ears, as loud as the wind outside. His heart thuds in his chest and it’s only Harry’s grip that keeps him from rocking his hips to alleviate the torturous pressure between his legs.
—builds and swells and possesses you. Your entire body ignites and you scream against your teeth as your orgasm breaks you.
You roll up your hips and take in a sharp breath. You’d forgotten just how incredible it feels to have something rubbing against your cock and have your cock actually respond, building heat, pulsing, twitching in the confines of your trousers.
“What do you want?” I ask, hooking my arms around your thighs to yank you down as close as you can get to me.
Draco’s breath hitches and he leans up on his elbow to look down at you. A tear splashes on your cheek just before he presses a gentle kiss to your lips. You brush your thumb across his lips when he pulls away.
You feel tiny puffs of air land on your cheek before it’s finally not enough and you need to break away for air.
It’s not long before you have him shoved against the tall bookcase, the shelves digging into his skull, his shoulders, his spine. Each shift of his body brings a wince to his features, his lip contorting where the blood streaks onto his chin. He gives up on pushing you and his fingers start to fumble with your trousers. You still, looking up at the ceiling as he frees your hard cock from where it was trapped against your fly. You move your hands to the shelf behind him and grip tight as you hear a another zip and a rustle of fabric.
, and yet there’s still one, two, three, four layers between us. The fact that I can feel you harden against me, but it’s not enough. Frankly, I don’t think it’ll ever be enough—I could stick my fingers inside your mouth, my cock inside your arse, my soul inside your heart, and still,
Draco squeezes his eyes tight, his entire face pink to the tip of his nose. Harry twists his fingers and Draco stutters, “Y–yes.”
It unlocks some primal part in your brain when he releases himself and uses his own come to jerk you off, and all you can do is hang on as Malfoy wrings your orgasm out of you as if it is his to take.
Harry brushes his fingers against the scar bisecting his waist and Draco lets out a stuttering breath, his torso twisting towards Harry’s touch. He snaps his eyes to Harry, his mouth agape and so un-Malfoy that it shocks Harry for a moment.
Harry puts his hands behind his head and stretches out. He nods at Draco with a small smirk. Draco leans in and kisses him roughly before he grabs Harry’s cock and sinks down, hissing through the delicious burn.
You ease up the pressure on his collar and stumble off of him. He stays on the ground. You watch, utterly fascinated, as his chest rapidly rises and falls in an effort to catch his breath. He stands and swipes his jumper from he ground, putting it on as he walks to the window, covering the damp white school shirt stuck to his back
“That sounds like a splendid idea. Boys, off you go,” Mr. Malfoy said, gesturing them to the door in dismissal.
Harry hesitated before nodding. Sirius didn’t waste any time, wrapping his arms around Harry’s small frame. Harry stood awkwardly, unsure of what to do with his arms. His head was tucked under Sirius chin, and he could smell the man’s cologne.
“That isn’t the only option available to us, but there are many things you need to be considering. My recommendation, it that you decide your next move quickly before the Dursleys wise up and get a lawyer.”
You’re both frozen, his legs bracketing your hips, yours trapped beneath; his hand in the center of your chest, yours in his hair, it’s as silky as it looks; his lips so fucking
“He’s gone.” Malfoy blinks up at the ceiling and you despair at the tears that well in his eyes and then disappear. Like magic. “My father’s gone and I didn’t even know until after it happened. And. And I know once they find out, everyone’s going to be
“That’s it.” Harry feels half out of his mind, feverish. “That’s it, Draco. I want you to come just like this and then I want to fuck you.”
He rakes his eyes over Draco’s lean form splayed out on Harry’s sheets, up to his face just in time to catch the tail-end of an eye roll. “Obviously, Potter.” His posh drawl is back and that simply won’t do.
Draco shakes his head, studiously avoiding Harry’s gaze, so Harry places his hands on the mattress either side of Draco’s face and kisses him deeply. Draco allows Harry to slip his tongue past his lips, his knuckles brushing against Harry’s shirt as his hand moves lower and lower. Harry’s arms shake where they are braced against the mattress, his breaths catching, his entire body trembling with the effort to stay still lest he scare Draco off. His only betrayal against his carefully concealed anticipation is the bruising force he kisses Draco with, greedily swallowing down all those tiny, helpless noises Draco vehemently denies he makes.
Harry knows his staring isn’t helping, and Draco is likely to hook his barbs—or worse, shut down completely—if he doesn’t do something soon. He moves his hand from Draco’s jaw and gently squeezes his thigh, hoping to reassure. He slides his hand up Draco’s leg, the soft fabric of his trousers bunching beneath his palm, until he skims over Draco’s hip and pushes the shirt so the blue fabric pools next to Draco’s waist.
Harry hardly has time to gather his bearings before Draco’s sure hand wraps around his cock and all thoughts frazzle out of his mind. He grips Draco’s hips, marveling at such a large expanse of unobstructed skin, and squeezes tight when Draco slowly sinks down. His breath leaves him in a woosh when Draco bottoms out.
Draco looks at him, frozen, with his belt hanging on by one loop. The belt slips and the tail hits the floor with a soft slap. Harry smirks. Draco drops the belt with a clatter, belatedly remembering how thin the walls are on this damn train, before moving his hands to his shirt.
You twitch around me as I slide my finger in and out, in and out; and when you start to move in spite of my grip, I add another finger. I can’t tell you what this does to me—the way you move, the way my fingers disappear inside of you, the way you bite my leg and chant
Ron nodded in agreement, and by the end of the week, Harry had introduced his two best mates to his new guardian. He wasn’t surprised to find they got on like a house on fire.
“I know it’s not much, but we can work on it. Fix it up, you know,” Sirius had hovered next to him, his nervousness creeping into his voice as he showed Harry into the unfurnished living room.
Harry noticed he had stopped halfway down the stairs, head quirked as he inspected the other boy. Shaking his head, he shot Mr. Malfoy a small smile and made his way to the bottom of the stairs. Harry noticed there was something different about Malfoy today. Rather than wearing what Harry had dubbed his miniature lawyer clothes, the other boy was dressed in a pair of black jeans and a dark green shirt. The shirt was well fitted, and accentuated any muscles on Malfoy’s biceps. It made Harry conscious of his own wardrobe, a pair of baggy blue jeans and oversized white shirt.
The car spluttered to a stop while Remus gave way at an intersection. He tapped the steering wheel and took a deep breath.
All things considering, the Judge seemed quite nice. His black hair was peppered with grey, and his glasses were like the pair Harry owned, round with gold rims. The robe he wore looked bizarre to Harry, but he supposed that came with the job. Overall, he didn’t seem like a bad person. Which was lucky, considering he held the fate of Harry’s future in his hands.
“Did you see that?” Hermione ushered them into seats towards the middle. “Malfoy saw us and didn’t even say anything. How bizarre is that?”
“Well, I suppose…” he trailed off, looking puzzled. “I guess it doesn’t feel that quick for me. Not after 12 years in prison. I suppose it might look odd to you, but we have known each other since we were 11, so it honestly doesn’t feel quick at all.”
“It’s that easy for you, is it? You just tell your friends we aren’t fighting anymore and sing kumbaya like a bunch of hippies.”
“However,” Harry’s heart sank. “It would require you to make a statement about the abuse you suffered at the hands of you Uncle and Aunt, which, if necessary, we will use to press
“What do you reckon is wrong with the git?” Ron asked, flopping into his seat, slouching with his arms crossed. His uniform was already rumpled, shirt untucked, tie crooked.
As they walked down the corridor lined with a number of doors, Harry wondered about what she had said. Someone wanted to meet him. His godfather wanted to meet him. He felt like fireworks had been set off in his chest. There was a wave of nerves flush over Harry, his palms still sweating, and his heart racing. He still felt cynical about the whole thing, but the idea that this was all some practical joke was slowly fading from his mind. It was all to elaborate.
“It’s about my boy, Draco,” Malfoy said. Harry’s furrowed his eyebrows. “Ever since we cancelled our holiday, he’s been… testy.”
As they chatted, Harry found it hard not to noticed how close Sirius and Remus now seemed. His godfather no longer looked like he wanted to bolt every time the other man spoke. Now, he laughed and joked with Remus, and he used any excuse he could to touch the sandy haired man. A pat on the shoulder. Sneaking food from his plate. He even once tried to go for a high five. Harry had facepalmed as his godfather held up his hand, but Remus begrudgingly high fived Sirius.
The rain outside had drifted off to a simple sprinkle. Though it was impossible to tell how late in the evening it was, it was nearing the time when Draco had to leave.
Malfoy looked like he had sucked on a lemon. Harry saw the outrage of not knowing eating at Malfoy as they walked. Harry let out another short laugh, and Malfoy’s cheeks began to tint pink.
“Mr. Potter,” he stepped up to Harry holding his hand out. “My name is Lucius Malfoy. I am going to be your new lawyer.”
Draco’s narrowed eyes looked him over again, assessing his every move. Harry turned to Mr. Malfoy to avoid the other boys gaze.
Harry blushed. He shrugged his shoulders, sinking low into the seat despite the spring digging into his back.
She launched into a recount of her morning in the Garden Nursery, looking for Fae people in the flower buds. She was recounting how she had learnt of their existence when a shadow fell over Harry.
When their laughter died down and they had caught their breath, neither spoke. They just smiled at the other, content with this time together.
Harry and Draco sat shoulder to shoulder on a bench in the corridor. Neither talked. Harry stared vacantly at a spot on the wall, while Draco surveyed the people walking past them with sharp eyes and an upturned nose. Harry could feel himself nodding off as they waited. The events of the day had left him truly exhausted.
Harry made his way to the kitchen after descending the stairs. There was a small hole in the floorboards near the fridge which he avoided from habit. The window above the sink looked out into the small backyard full of overgrown grass and weeds. Harry made a mental note to get started on the yard work now that he was out of school.
Sirius shot Harry an encouraging smile, nodding for him to head off. With another stammer and glance at the adults, Harry stumbled off across the expansive ballroom, his footsteps loud and unsure ringing through off the walls. He listened as Mrs. Malfoy guided Sirius and Remus into another room, shutting the door with a sharp bang behind them.
The class quickly shuffled into the room, confused looks still in place on many faces. Harry merely rolled his eyes at his teachers’ dramatics, before heading over to join Ron and Hermione, who were both heading towards the back of the room.
“Yeah, he gave it to me yesterday,” Harry continued tearing the juice box. “So, you don’t mind if I use the phone? I promise I will be quick.”
He made his way to the office Lucius had stalked off to, his chest tightening with each step. Sirius found the correct door, made of red-wood, and entered without knocking. The room was tight, packed with shelves filled with paper, and folders, and books. Files stacked on top of more files filled most the space. Sirius was sure this wasn’t an office of Malfoy’s and wondered which poor sack had been blackmailed into letting them use it.
In history, a menial, mind-numbing documentary was played, which in truth was just as ineffective as listing to Professor Binns drone on, on any normal day. Harry and Ron had a running bet with Hermione the guy was a ghost. The man was ancient and looked to be over 100 years old, his pale grey skin too abnormal for him to still be alive. In history, Harry tried to catch up on the sleep he had lost the night before. Many others in the room had planned to do the same. Neville had started snoring within ten minutes of the class, and Nott and Zabini were attempting to shoot paper wasps into Goyle’s open mouth.
Sirius hummed, looking concerned by the words. The conversation halted. Sirius pointed to the kitchen.
“I don’t know,” Potter picked some more weeds out of Snuffles hair. “I guess it was the first time I noticed your parents always come to your games.”
“Do you think he will?” Harry asked through a mouthful of eggs. “I thought you said you didn’t get on with your family.”
The words felt like a punch in the gut, and Sirius felt his chest clench. Harry still refused to look at him.
While he worked his way through his current dilemma, Harry failed to notice the Dursleys approaching. His Aunt and Uncle walked right past him, failing to acknowledge his presence, as they turned to enter the court room.
Remus hummed. As he sipped the last of his hot chocolate, Sirius detected the tell-tale expression of a man plotting.
The tone of his voice made it seem like a casual mention in the conversation, but the way Remus tightly gripped the steering wheel and glanced at him from the corner of his eyes told Harry otherwise. He felt like a rug had been ripped from under him.
Almost instantly, Harry’s attention drew back to his friends. Panic seized his throat. Did they know who he was looking for?
The voice sounded distant. Like he was swimming, floating on the surface and the noise was filtering through the water to his ears. He didn’t respond. He sat with his head in his hands, his glasses pushed onto his head as he pressed the palms of his hands harshly into his eye socket. He felt like screaming.
“What would you have me do, Father?” Malfoy drawled out. “I doubt there is much to do in a place such as this.”
“I didn’t mean… Everything I said wasn’t…” Harry groaned, running his hand through his hair, messing it even further. “The things I said last night. I didn’t mean them. I was angry and thought you were telling me I was crazy. I shouldn’t have lashed out. I don’t know why I did, I just… don’t want you to think I am crazy.”
“Of course not. This is nothing,” Mr. Malfoy inspected a piece of paper he pulled from his brief case, ignoring the two boys in the living room.
“Excellent,” Malfoy picked up his suitcase and cane. “Draco and I will arrive in the morning at 10 30, if that suits you both.”
“Oh, I know,” Harry said cheerfully. “Let’s get dinner after the movie, just us. My shout, seeing as you bought the movie tickets.”
“Relax. You aren’t about to break it by sitting on it, Potter. Pansy practically jumps on it each time she comes over.”
A sharp ‘Boof!’ sounded from the kitchen, and soon the two were soon attacked by a furious cuddle monster. Snuffled leapt onto them, using his front legs to hook himself over Sirius and Harry’s shoulders. He was as tall as Harry standing on his back legs, and he took that opportunity to give the boy a long, slobbery kiss on the boy’s cheek.
“Yeah, I went to the movies, by myself,” He emphasised the last word too much. He prayed Ginny didn’t pick up on it. “Um, and, I couldn’t decide what to watch. Luna told me to watch um…”
After a pause, Harry nodded. With a final squeeze to his shoulders, Sirius guided Harry into the living room to sit on the couch. The cushions were worn, making them more comfortable and softer than a brand-new couch.
“Quite in the back please,” Professor Binns droned from the front of the room before continuing his lecture.
Sirius felt his heart rate increase. A sharp anger was building in his chest and his breath was coming out in short huffs.
Sirius nodded along to the words. He handed files over to Malfoy. Harry began washing the plates they had used for lunch. When Malfoy had collected all he needed, he stood up straight and looked to them both. Harry was expecting to hear the usual goodbye. However, Malfoy said something unexpected.
Instead, when Sirius called him down, he took the stairs slowly. He made no noise. Harry peaked into the living room where Sirius was setting the coffee table up with tea and biscuits. He waited at the edge of the room behind the wall.
For a moment, Harry expected his name to follow, so used to the three being scolded by teachers in that very order. It took a moment for them all to realise what was happening. Applaud erupted around them, which Harry was quick to join in on, shooting his two friends a proud smile. Ron had gone pale. Hermione wide eyed. She stood first, making her way to the front of the hall to receive her badge. Harry had to haul Ron to his feet for the other to follow. Harry cheered them on as they accepted their badges, laughing at the stunned look painted on Ron’s face. He could hear Fred and George whooping in the crowd, chanting their last name over and over. The two stayed on stage while Dumbledore continued announcing the other Prefects. Harry wasn’t surprised to hear Draco’s name announced, alongside Parkinson’s.
“Lucius thinks I should replace James. Officially adopt Harry. Make sure his relatives can never touch him again.”
Harry squared his shoulders, and jutted his chin, ready for whatever his Aunt was about to say. He stared at the woman who had spent so many years tormenting and demeaning Harry every chance she got. Now, he knew he would never have to endure anymore of her comments after today. The thought was relieving. Euphoric even. He knew he could take one last comment she was about to throw his way.
Harry shuffled to the edge of the bed, placing his feet on the floor. He watched as Malfoy finished putting one shoe on and started on the other.
“I’m sorry you found out about Remus and I like that. I’d planned to tell you, but everything happened so quickly. It’s no excuse, but I really hadn’t meant for you to find out like that.”
“Ze noise can be a bit much,” Fleur said over the barking. “Don’t worry though, take your time. If you see someone you like, I can let zem out and you can get to know zem a little better.”
Harry looked over to Melissa as well, pleading with his eyes for her to say yes. She looked between the two of them, and for the first time, Harry noticed she was not smiling. She stared at him, and Harry couldn’t decide what she was thinking, only that something was puzzling her.
“I wish you would call him Remus, or even Moony. I watched that twat pull pranks on Professors when we were kids and there’s no way he should’ve been granted the title.”
“Thank you,” Harry smiled at Draco at he took one of the boxes. “You didn’t have to buy me popcorn though.”
Harry watched the sun sink low in the sky, a haze of orange and pink stretching across the city. He had caught the bus into town where the nearest cinema was. The entire trip he hadn’t been able to keep his legs from twitching, his nerves keeping him unfocused. He had nearly missed his stop, to busy staring out the window as he thought about meeting Draco. Thankfully, he realised just before the bus door slid shut, and ran up isle, ignoring the glare he received from the driver.
The drive would be a rather quick one, which Harry could easily have walked, but still it was nice to recline and be driven home by someone. Harry stared out the window, watching the landscape pass by, noticing a few students walking into town from Hogwarts.
Harry froze. Snuffles pulled gently against him to keep going but Harry stayed rooted where he was. Malfoy, who had kept walking, noticed Harry had fallen back. He didn’t look back, instead waited for the dark-haired boy to speak.
“What? How the hell do you even know the right number!” Sirius scrambled with the phone, shoving it to his ear in time to hear a familiar, soothing voice.
The second floor consisted of three rooms. The master bedroom, which was Sirius’s room, the spare room, Harry’s, and in between them the bathroom, complete with a bath and shower. Harry made quick work showering himself, mostly using the water to wash the sleep from his face. Once he emerged, he looked in the foggy mirror and attempted to flatten his wet hair. It refused to smooth out.
They were heading to science class after yet another mind-numbing class not even Hermione could pretend to be interested in. It was the last class of the day, the only thing that stood between them and the summer holidays. Ahead of him, Harry heard Seamus and Dean discussing their summer plans.
The two boys spent the rest of their time together mindlessly enjoying cartoons, and though they were teenagers, neither felt childish for allowing themselves this small reprise from the seriousness of life.
“How can I trust him? I barely know him! I don’t even know what I’m going to do if I lose and there is no one I can talk to about it because my friends are in a different country. My godfather is too busy trying to make sure he doesn’t lose me, and each time I try to talk about it, he tells me not to worry!” Harry finished the sentence yelling, his breath frantic and hands gesturing wildly.
Sirius broke out into a sharp grin, pure delight dancing in his eyes. He opened his mouth to respond.
“Actually, Sirius,” Harry said, pealing the wrapper off his juice. “Would it be ok if I called Draco and asked if he wants to hang out?”
“Mum!” Draco whined in the distance, before talking into the phone. “Sorry about her. My parents don’t really understand boundaries.”
Snuffles had stopped to sniff a nearby bush, and Harry tugged on his lead to keep the hound moving. Not taking the hint, Snuffles continued sniffing and Harry was forced to stop. Malfoy stopped as well, only a few steps ahead of them.
He had nearly finished getting dressed when Sirius knocked on his door. His godfather was dressed in a well-fitted black suit, his hair gelled back into a perfect slick style. As expensive and good as he looked, Harry could help but feel it was wrong to see his godfather in something that wasn’t jeans and shirts.
“Why though?” his voice was small. Nearly lost in the wind. “After everything, how could you still want to be with me?”
It didn’t take long for Harry and Sirius to make the decision. Snuffles was the dog for them. The adoption process was quick. Fleur was close to tears, kneeling and hugging Snuffles a number of times before the papers were signed. When they were finally ready to leave, Fleur having set them up with everything they could possibly need into two paper bags, Fleur made them promise to take care of her big boy.
It was definitely Potter. Draco was sure, even if he could barely hear the other boy over the excited yaps of the beast.
Still, walking into the courtroom led by Mr. Malfoy, Sirius’s hand on his shoulder, Draco by his side, Harry couldn’t help but notice how cold his hand was now, and that worried him.
“No wonder you were acting so awkward this morning,” the words were still timid, but they held a hint of amusement.
“Mother,” Draco Malfoy said. “When we get to Paris, will we be heading straight to our vacation house, or can we visit Grandmother first?”
After checking his schedule, Harry groaned, before entering the castle and beginning his decent to the dungeons for double Science. Deep into the castle, there were few if any windows lining the walls, leading the hallways to be shrouded in darkness. Harry stuck close to the wall, brushing the rough brick against his fingertips as he walked. Ahead of him, another boy walked, shoulders hunched over, neck hanging low, looking like he was walking to his execution. After a few moments, Harry noted the boy was none other than Neville Longbottom.
At this, the boys act dropped, and Harry was graced with one of the few genuine expressions he had seen from Draco. Furrowed eyebrows, concerned eyes, and a tight smile.
He looked ragged. Scars on his face from when he was young still prominent against his pale skin. His clothes ill-fitting and patchy, looked like they had outlived their make long ago, but from sheer force of will still held together. The bags under his eyes gave hint to the troubled sleep Sirius knew plagued the man. Remus Lupin was worn and tired, and he was everything Sirius had always desired.
“What are you on about?” Sirius demanded. “Don’t be daft, it doesn’t suit you Remus. Of course, I want you in our lives. And so does Harry. Who do you think made the call to you this morning?”
He could feel Draco peak over his shoulder. Draco scoffed at the sight of the writing, causing Harry to frown. Looking at the other boy, he noticed the flushed cheeks and scowl adorning his face.
“Pansy, she is my cousin,” Draco turned his attention on Parkinson, his eyes narrowed. “Not only that, she has had a shite time of it. You know what happened to her mum. Stop giving me shit for trying to be a decent relative for the first time ever.”
“The book was in our library. It’s tradition for families like ours to have a journal dedicated to the history of our lineage. That one is yours.”
They spent the rest of the morning floating awkwardly around the house. Harry tried to keep busy, but he couldn’t keep his mind on one set task. He went to walk Snuffles, but
There was a litter of small sandy coloured dogs in one kennel, the mother dog overlooking her four pups with disinterest as the young ones yapped and fought each other. Next to the litter of pups was a small white ball of fluff that Harry couldn’t be sure was a dog. A few cages up there was a droopy eyes elderly dog that had large droplets of drool accumulating in its mouth. The cacophony of barking was becoming overwhelming and Harry struggled to think.
Sirius pointed his finger at Professor Lupin who only laughed harder, holding his hands up in surrender. The two had overcome all awkwardness, and the friendly nature between them was unmistakable. There was the same tension there as before, but now Harry knew it was not hostile.
“I am not! And you were definitely being weird about yesterday. You've never asked how I am,” Harry walked into the living room, turning his back to Malfoy. The other boy followed.
The rest of the class had made their way out of the classroom already, leaving him with Professor McGonagall. The teacher finished gathering her notes from her desk. Harry tried to quickly sneak out before she noticed him.
Harry huffed, managing to finally extract Snuffles from the intoxicating scent of the bush. He refrained from answering Malfoys question. He still felt guilty about not telling his Ron and Hermione about his custody hearing. He tried to console himself by thinking they were off enjoying themselves without having to worry about Harry and his troubles.
Harry blushed as she let go of him. He could feel Sirius waiting to tease him as they left the store, a sly smirk across his face.
Harry was out of breath by the time be finished, his emotions seeping out of him, leaving him a tired mess. He leant back against his bedrest, too exhausted to hold himself up.
Sirius was incapable of talking, instead jerking his head in attempted nod. Everyone remained silent for a moment, listening to the honking of cars and shouts of pedestrians as they waited for someone to speak. Sirius had gone pale and his eyes were still bulging.
At the very end of the room, in the last kennel, sat a large black dog with scruffy hair and large paws. He was large enough to be a mastiff, but he looked to have another breed mixed in him as well. He laid with his belly flat on the cold concrete floor. His eyes watched the humans in the room, but he made no move of interest towards them. Not even his ears twitched when Fleur spoke.
The dark-haired boy looked away from Draco. Instead, he focused intently on his hands as he patted the beast. Draco huffed at the boy’s refusal to answer.
Harry went to sleep thinking about the other boy’s laughter, unsure what the uneasy feeling building inside him meant.
When he walked into the kitchen, Harry thought Malfoy looked as pleased to be there as Harry was having him here. His eyes roamed the house in disgust and his lip was curled as he surveyed each room. He looked like a miniature lawyer, dressed in Khakis and a button shirt. Mr. Malfoy looked much the same as he usually did, dressed in a three-piece suit and carrying his cane and briefcase.
“We had to chase Snuffles through some bushes. I think he saw a squirrel or something and went nuts.”
The other man was stunned for a moment, before laughter bubbled out of his mouth. The longer he laughed the more it sounded like tears. Remus ran his hand over his face, scratching along the stubble building beneath his chin.
“Professor,” Draco nodded. “I was just going. Father’s driver will be waiting for me. I will see you both tomorrow.”
“I promise you I wasn’t. I want you to understand why I suggested that. So, can we try talking about this again?”
As always, Mr. Malfoy arrived right on time. The thud of the door only cemented Harry’s bad mood, and he sunk low into his chair, resting his arms and head on the table. Sirius walked to the front door to greet the Father and son, shooting Harry a small look.
Reaching the end of the hallway, Sirius quickly scanned the various doors and their name plaques. On the left, he saw the name he was after; L. Malfoy. Without thinking twice, he ripped the door open.
I’m sorry for making you worry so much, but things have been pretty full on this summer. The thing is, I haven’t been very honest with you and Hermione this year. I really am sorry, I just didn’t know how to tell you everything that was going on, and I didn’t want you to worry anymore about me than you already do.
“Yeah, you idiot. We love you,” Ron bumped his knees against Harry’s. “Just don’t lie to us about this shit again. We could have helped you!”
“This was always going to be the case, Black. This was a guardianship hearing. Meaning, the Dursleys could demand another hearing challenging you for guardianship. We have already discussed this.”
“Well, I mean, your dad cares so much about you, he tried to have me off the team just for punching you. But, like, if my relatives ever saw you do that to me, they surely would have baked you a cake or some shit… or made me bake it.”
On his birthday, Sirius went above anything Harry could have expected, pulling off a surprise birthday party. He had invited the Malfoys and Remus, whom Harry now called Moony, to attend the small barbeque Sirius had whipped up. The entire night had been overwhelming, but not in the way that dinner with the Weasleys usually was. Rather than the loud rambunctious crowd the Weasleys were, the party was small and intimate, full of birthday wishes, sincere chatter, and presents. When it came to dinner, Sirius and Moony were both thrilled watching Mr. Malfoy suffer as he attempted to eat a hamburger with a knife and fork, sitting and giggling like schoolgirls as they snuck glances at the struggling man.
The question only made Potter laugh harder. All the stress pent up in Potter seemed to be seeping out. He still looked exhausted, but the tension within him was not as intense. Together they laughed at nothing and everything, unsure what it was that seemed so funny in the first place.
“You got me a present?” Harry couldn’t keep the disbelief from his voice. His birthday had been a few days ago. He had only even received presents from Ron, Hermione and some years Hagrid, Hogwarts agriculture teacher.
Sometimes, there was the odd day Potter came to school oozing misery looking for Draco with sharp words spilling from his mouth. There was always something different in Potter when he was the one starting the fights. Like his heart was not in it, and he was only looking for a distraction. And who was Draco not to comply? He shot back harsher words and violent jabs until both of them were left sore and upset, serving weeks’ worth of detention.
Yet, there was also a touch of something else, something different, that Harry could only describe as Draco’s touch filling the room. A poster of Draco’s favourite football team (Harry would deny ever knowing it was Tottenham) was stuck to the wall above the couch. A bookshelf bedside the bed was filled with nerdy books he knew only Draco and Hermione would enjoy. Even the way Draco held himself, relaxed and lazing about in his boxers, showed how casual, safe, he felt in this space.
Though they rarely properly fought throughout those days, there was always the escalation of tension that could become more if they continued. Despite Malfoy being a large distraction for Harry, the upcoming trial was becoming a deep source of stress for the other boy. It was two days before the court date that his stress and Malfoy’s stubbornness met head on.
Sirius exhaled, like a punch in the gut had knocked the wind from his lungs. He closed his eyes, rubbing them with his hands, scrubbing along the stubble on his chin. The bun of hair wobbled atop his head, and soon Harry noticed his godfather was huffing short, dry chuckles.
“Alright then, we can talk about something else. But this isn’t a conversation you can keep putting off.”
“Well, what about Harry then? Surely, he doesn’t feel the same,” Remus shifted in his seat. “I mean he’s straight. Just this year he had a crush on an older girl…Cho Chang.”
When he finally caught sight of Potter, he saw the boy’s frame slumped against the trunk of a thick oak tree in a small clearing. Snuffles was standing over him, blocking most of Draco’s view. He stepped forward to get closer to the two, and as he did, Draco stepped on a large branch. The branch emitted a large snap, and tripped him, sending him flying into the open space. He didn’t notice Potter or Snuffles look at him as he stumbled over his own feet.
The idea he had told Malfoy of all people what was going on seemed so ridiculous to Harry. Not two weeks ago, the two had been at each other’s throat, using anything and everything against the other for whatever reaction they could illicit. And yet, today he had told Malfoy about his life with Sirius and the Dursleys. For whatever reason, Harry had trusted Malfoy. There were nerves fluttering in Harry’s chest, but he was surprised to find he did not regret his conversation with the other boy. In fact, something inside him felt lighter after talking to Malfoy.
Harry shrugged, crossing his arms over his chest. He looked away from his Godfather, and his disappointed stare.
The last day of school followed much the same in all of Harry’s classes. He listened halfheartedly to Ron and Hermione’s summer plans. Harry knew they were trying to tone down their interesting plans for his own sake, but it still hurt to hear they would be gone all summer, leaving him alone. Hermione’s parents were going to take her to New York, somewhere she had been begging to go since Harry had met her in first year. Ron, for the first summer since Harry and he became friends, would also be gone, heading to Romania to visit his brother alongside the rest of his family. Unlike the two who would be travelling overseas, Harry would be stuck at home once again this summer. He refused to tell them his own plans.
After her words, Luna picked up her apple, taking a small bite. Neither spoke for a few moments. The crowds of student’s chatter, and laughter flowed through the lunch grounds. Harry’s mouth parted, and it took him a few minutes to think of a response.
“Um, we met this summer and she was really nice to talk to so I figured I would just sit with her. Kind of weird that she is Malfoys cousin, hey?”
“No!” Sirius said emphatically, forehead frowning. “Harry, god no! Don’t ever think that. I love you. Yes, I will admit, I was hurt about how things went last night, but I do not hate you, nor am I mad.”
“Mr. Black,” Sirius dropped the murderous glint in his eyes. “Recently, you served twelve years for a murder you were wrongfully committed of. Considering this, do you still believe you are fit to act as guardian of Mr. Potter?”
Harry sat up in bed. The covers fell to his waste, and his bed-shirt hung of his shoulders. The morning air formed goosebumps along his arms. He pulled his legs to the edge of the bed, his bare feet hitting the wooden floor. He could feel the accumulation of dirt beneath his feet and made a mental note to vacuum his floor later in the day.
It was Potter who noticed how low the sun had sunk in the sky. The light of the afternoon had taken on an orange haze that slipped through the cracks in the treetops.
Sirius couldn’t help the huff of laughter that came from him. He surged up to steal another kiss from Moony. After another chaste kiss, they sat back staring at each other once again. A quick glance into the restaurant showed that the waiter either didn’t see them, or simply didn’t care.
“I don’t fucking know anymore, Moony!” Sirius exploded, throwing his hands into the air. “What do you want me to say? That I’ve adjusted well to life outside of prison? That I don’t wake up from nightmares every fucking night? That I’m not pissed about the fact I missed out on twelve fucking years of my life because of a fucking mistake I made when I was twenty? What is it you want to hear?!”
After everyone was settled, Dumbledore stood, and soon the entire hall fell into silence. It was like magic. The Welcoming Ceremony began as it did every year, sorting the new students based on the personality test they submitted earlier that summer.
Sirius didn’t say anything when Harry entered. He sat across from his godfather at the table, the scrapping of his wooden chair along the floor the only noise filling the room. They sat there until the sun came up, and the clocks chimed for the fifth time.
Sirius walked into the kitchen and set about filling the kettle with water. When it was full, he placed it on its base and flipped the switch. The water started gurgling. Remus joined Harry at the table, sending the young boy a grin. Harry gave a small smile in return. Together they watched Sirius search the kitchen cupboards.
Sure enough, they had arrived at hells gate itself. Inside loomed a more prominent threat than Harry had been envisioning. Inside, a vampire who did not understand or care for the use of shampoo, awaited them.
“So, I was trying to bake a cake, because how hard could that be? And then, I, uh, kind of, accidentally, set fire to the place.”
Harry nodded. He wanted nothing more than to stay with Sirius and his hand itched to hold onto his godfathers. He refused the urge, berating himself for acting like such a child. Without a word he went to sit on the green lounge with silver trimmings set up in the corner of the room. As he sat, he watched as his godfather spoke quick words to the receptionist before making his way to the elevator.
For all the sights Harry expected to see, nothing could prepare him for what faced him. Draco Malfoy was sprawled on his stomach diagonally across his king-sized bed, wearing nothing but a plain green t-shirt and black boxers. He was listening to a cassette tape with headphones, his feet dangling in the air. The canopy of the bed fell around him like he was in a photoshoot.
Draco didn’t know why he felt disappointed by those words. The thought of leaving the clearing and heading back to the real world didn’t seem so appealing when he thought about Potter and him going back to their old ways when they left. But, Draco knew they couldn’t stay here forever.
“I think its best to decide when we get there, darling,” she responded without looking up from the form she was filling out.
He walked over to the makeshift living room with Sirius. Melissa split apart from them, heading to a chair in the corner of the room.
“Good morning, Mr. Potter,” Mr. Malfoy greeted Harry first, pulling off his jacket and placing it on a small hook Sirius had installed when they first moved in.
Draco stopped smirking at his Father’s words, and discretely dropped Harry’s hand, like he had been caught reaching into the cookie jar. Or whatever the rich person equivalent was. Draco’s mask of indifference returned, and he seamlessly turned into the Draco Malfoy Harry used to call his nemesis. Thankfully, Lucius Malfoy showed no indication he had seen the two boys as they were. Harry could understand why Draco didn’t want his father to see him holding hands with another boy. Shame burned in his own chest at the thought of other people seeing them like that. But it still hurt Harry for some reason. It wasn’t like he was about to call Malfoy out on his weird behaviour though. Harry had been the instigator of the hand holding after all. And their shoulders still brushed against each other’s, which, while a lot less comforting, was much less intimate than hand holding.
They were a street over from home when Sirius stopped. Harry noticed a few steps afterwards, and gently tugged Snuffles to a stop as well. Patiently, Snuffles sat at Harry’s feet, his butt brushing Harry’s leg. His mouth was open, his tongue hanging out and his breathes panting.
“What, and you believed him? My father only cares about himself and his family. Don’t delude yourself Potter, he doesn’t care if he wins your case.”
“Hey,” Sirius said, holding his hand against Harry’s cheek, pulling his gaze up until their eyes locked. “I promise you Harry, I will sort this out. You are never going back there. I am just making sure we have the best everything to make sure we win, ok?”
They had been sharing stories of Hogwarts. Remus was commending Harry on his school work while Harry tried to undermine his achievements. As they talked, Sirius felt clued out. He didn’t even know what kind of relationship Remus had built with Harry. When had they even met?
“What are you doing?” Hermione asked. Not in the way that meant she was curious, but in the accusatory, ‘you better not be serious’ way.
“Wait, so which one has a crush on the other? And how did you find this all out? I mean, honestly, this is just…bloody unbelievable!”
Harry tried to argue with him, to insist he could pay for his own tickets, but Draco was already off. Harry kept an eye on him as he walked away, noticing his sullen attitude. The lag in his steps, the slight slouch in his usually perfect posture. Harry shook his head.
“If you take on our case, I will make it worth your time,” Sirius said through gritted teeth, trying to keep the desperation and anger out of his voice.
Standing in front of him in his neatly pressed uniform was non-other than Draco Malfoy. He stared at the Harry with an unamused look. A new, gleaming Prefect badge was pinned to his blazer.
“Draco and I are going to check out the movies and see what’s on,” Harry eyes widened as he realised, he hadn’t asked Sirius if he could go out. “Is that alright?”
The booming words echoed through the hallway, making many people pause. None reacted more violently than Harry though. He immediately recognised the voice. Blood drained from his face and his body went rigid, like a corpse entering rigor mortis.
“What! Preposterous,” Vernon spluttered. His face was turning the alarming shade of purple. “The boy is lying!”
Harry went back to packing his things away, oblivious to the way Draco was staring behind him. He heard some shuffling, and he ignored Draco who he bet was ruffling through more of Harry’s things. The boy had no sense of privacy, Harry had learnt.
“Well then. I suppose I better chat with Harry about the possibility of a new Dad,” the words came out drier than they were meant to, with less humour and more awkwardness. The chuckle sounded forced and pained.
They didn’t live too far away from central London. If Harry wanted to go, it would only be a quick bus trip to the town.
“Yes, Draco,” Harry stood, walking over to stand in front of Draco. The other boy tried to sidestep him, but Harry grabbed his arm to keep him still. “Stop it!”
Something in those words caused Remus to look up at Sirius, his heartbroken expression turned sadder.
Harry thought about all the nights he had spent at Ron’s house, the other boy begging him to move in with him and his family. He thought about Hermione packing a second lunch everyday for him, always giving him any extra’s she had. He thought about how since moving in with Sirius, his friends concern had grown as he spent less days at Ron’s and started bringing his own meals. Though he assured them everything was fine, he knew they had caught on to a shift in Harry’s life. Things became harder for Harry the longer he put of telling them, and now he wasn’t sure they wouldn’t be pissed at him for the entire situation he had put them in.
“No,” Remus said firmly, his head shaking in jagged sharp motions. “No! Don’t tell me Harry wasn’t treated like that. Don’t tell me he was living in an abusive household, and I didn’t do anything to…”
Petunia had grabbed her hand bag and was ready to leave with her husband. She paused at The Judge’s word, slowing sinking back into her seat, keeping her eyes on the doors. At Sirius instruction, Harry too took his seat, resting on the edge of the chair as he waited for The Judge to continue speaking.
After showering and dressing, Harry made his way to his room. He sat on his bed a little too hard, the spring sending him bounding a few times before settling. The deep-rooted exhaustion clawing through him enticed him to lay his head on the pillow, but his discarded blazer lying on the bedroom floor caught his eye. He stood up, making his way over to retrieve the letters he had momentarily forgot about, the crisp paper smooth against his fingers. The letters retrieved, he made his way back over to his bed, sitting with his back against the wall and his legs pulled to his chest. The lamp bedside his bed illuminated the room is a soft glow. He slid the rubber band free and began opening the first letter from Ron. It was dated from just two weeks ago.
Absentmindedly, Potter ran his hands through Snuffles hair. He didn’t respond, and irritation was swimming in Draco’s chest.
“Since when has your gaydar ever been anything but terrible, Moony,” Sirius rolled his eyes. “Besides, I wasn’t sure Harry felt the same way, either. Not until about ten minutes ago.”
“I’m sorry, I just can’t believe Draco Malfoy agreed with something I said. I really should mark this down on the calendar or something.”
“Honestly, no wonder you and Weasley get on. Someone so much as mentions money and the other boy loses it.”
However, on the 1st of September 1995, Harry Potter woke with a scowl already on his face, and a ball of unease boiling in the pit of his stomach.
It was the waiting that put Sirius on edge. The constant waiting, and thinking, and thinking and waiting. What if Remus had moved on from what they had? He hadn’t said anything when they met up last, but maybe Sirius’s tongue in his mouth had stopped Remus before he could say anything. Did he force their relationship? Did Remus regret hooking up with him after everything they had been through? What if there was another man? Woman?
Malfoy scrunched his nose in disgust and even Harry, who loved walking Snuffles, thought the idea repulsive. Yet, it was better than sitting around the house where Malfoy could potentially overhear details about the case Harry didn’t need him knowing. With that, Harry rounded up Snuffles.
Harry began shaking his head. His hands slipped, and the messy tie came undone. With a frustrated groan, Harry threw his head back in defeat.
“How are you going?” Harry tried to say it nonchalantly, but his voice cracked on the last word. There was no mistaking his fear.
“Honestly, I asked the same thing. Well, you know how I was telling you about Harry and Draco and how I reckoned there was something a little extra stirring up there?”
It was that moment that Sirius looks back on now that he hard Harry safe in his care. The quickness of Harry wanting to move in with what was basically a stranger was the first warning sign of his godson’s abuse. It would be months later, the Dursley's refusing to sign the documents, and Harry showing up on his doorstep with a black eye and bruised arm for everything to finally add up in Sirius’ mind.
Harry left the bathroom with a stream of fog following him. He headed to his bedroom with his red towel wrapped around his waist. He made quick work opening his drawer and pulled out a pair of black jeans and a black shirt.
Harry could feel his face growing red, temper rising at the words his supposed mates were spewing. Just as he opened his mouth to rip into Dean, anther voice called out to them, spewing angry spiteful words.
The blonde rolled his eyes but refrained from responding. He followed Harry and Snuffles out the door.
Harry spent Sunday afternoon unsure how he was going to tell Sirius. After already having spent so much adopting Snuffles and buying all the things he needed, Harry was starting to worry Sirius would think it was all too much. There was a small part of him that thought perhaps Sirius would send Snuffles back.
Remus Lupin strode towards them, his brief case swinging by his side. He was clean shaven, his brown-grey hair ruffled as though he had run his hands through it several times that day. His suit was worn, and his shoes scuffed, but he looked comfortable and calm as he walked towards the boys.
Sirius finally cleared his throat. Harry took that as his time being up, and slowly moved away, wiping his eyes with shaking hands. Before he could step to far away, Sirius reached up and helped wipe away the streaks of tears on Harry’s cheeks, and the simple movement was enough to make Harry want to cry again. But he didn’t.
Remus sat back in chair. He took a deep breath, closing his eyes as though physically hurt by the words Sirius just spoke. When he opened them, Sirius noticed how glassy his eyes were, and his chest ached to see the man he loved so close to tears.
Harry’s chest tightened, but he kept a smile on his face, dropping onto the bench in front of Luna. They quickly fell into light conversation. Luna told Harry about the magazine she was reading, which her father was the owner of, and Harry told her about his morning classes. He pulled the lunch Sirius had packed for him from his bag, pulling a pained face at the sight of it. He unwrapped the sandwich, hummed, then re-wrapped the sandwich before placing it beside him.
Harry took a deep breath. The air in the manor had a chill, and the paintings covering the walls had eyes that followed his every move. Harry tried to walk quickly, pretending he wasn’t close to breaking out into a run to get away from the cavernous, chilling space. Reaching the staircase was like reaching the safety of Hogwarts after a chilling night at the Dursleys, filling him with unrelenting relief. Harry shook his head, berating himself for being so stupid. There was nothing about this room that was dangerous, he thought. His hammering heart slowed slightly, and after a few breaths, Harry started his assent up the twirling marble staircase.
Remus gave Sirius a knowing look, aware of his old friend’s diversion tactic before simply nodding his head.
“No, but you might do it if your wife knew she would receive all of the Black family’s priceless heirlooms, including the manor.”
Harry didn’t immediately worry when he lost sight of Sirius in the crowd. His Aunt Petunia was known for losing track of him when she took him and Dudley grocery shopping with her. The first few times it happened, Harry had panicked and cried, but his Aunt always found him before heading home, piling bags of groceries into his arms while reprimanding him for not staying with her. It was never intentional that Harry separated himself, and before he was seven, he realized she was purposefully losing him. One less thing to worry about. Soon enough, he knew to wait for her outside whatever shop she was visiting, ready to pick up the bags she shoved in his direction. Dudley always stuck his tongue out at his cousin, chewing on whatever treat his mother had bought him while Harry struggled under the weight of all the bags.
He had been hoping for a fight. Instead, Potter sunk even further into himself. His shoulders were hunched, and his face was still sickly pale.
“Well than what’s it like, Potter?” He turned around and Harry was shocked to see pure anger on the boy’s face. “I help you through the worst summer of your life, and then what? I know your just going to toss me aside the second Granger and Weasley come back”
It drew a laugh out of Potter, a short huff that turned into deep laughter. Seeing Potter throw his head back, eyes closed caused Draco to smile. The situation felt so surreal there wasn’t much more Draco could to than join in laughing.
“You know,” Luna spoke in a low, soft voice. “Sometimes, after someone experiences something bad, something traumatic, they keep their feelings hidden, even from themselves, as a way of protecting themselves. And sometimes, it’s not until they feel safe that they let themselves feel what they felt when they were hurt. This might be why your dreams are bad. It’s because you finally feel safe enough to let your guard down enough to feel what you need to feel.”
Harry stepped into the room, his eyes trained on Mr. Malfoy. The man looked like he had been sucking on a sour lemon, his lips pinched, and his nose scrunched slightly as he looked around the room. When he saw Harry, he stood up. The movement was sudden, and for a startling moment, thoughts of punishments and pain ran through Harry’s mind, causing him to jump back a step. Seeing his reaction caused Malfoy to still, posed in a crouch halfway between fully standing and sitting. The two stared at each other for a few moments, Harry’s eyes wide, Malfoy’s calculating, before the man slowly sat back down. He put his hands up in a gesture of peace, looking like he was trying to calm a frightened animal.
Sirius looked at him with red rimmed eyes and sighed. He stood from the chair and Harry heard his back crack several times as he stretched. He walked over to Harry with slow, deliberate steps, before putting his arms around Harry, holding him to his chest. Harry felt the man sigh as his godson wrapped his arms around Sirius’s body.
Harry stilled. He looked to Sirius who had gone pale at the words. He didn’t look surprised. Deep within Sirius, he knew there would be a price for Malfoy help. He had known ever since the thought of asking Malfoy for crossed his mind one desperate afternoon when Sirius knew he was losing the fight for Harry. Now, it seemed it was time to pay up. Sirius gave a single nod to Malfoy, his eyes calculating.
“We have older dogs that have been with us for years. Zey are just dying for a forever home, but if it is a puppy you have your heart set on, we have a few breeds available as vell.”
With a final pat down, Sirius let of Harry, and together they made their way down the stairs and out the front door, bidding goodbye to a sulking Snuffles.
The two fell silent, and Harry felt the need to apologies for never mentioning Professor Lupin to Sirius. It wasn’t that he didn’t like him as a teacher, in fact he had become one of Harry’s favorites. It was just the topic never arose. Harry opened his mouth to say something when Professor Lupin started talking.
Then, he began striding down the hallway once again, leaving Sirius, once again, emotionally drained from such a wild conversation.
“Letters. From my friends, I think. Aunt Petunia gave them to me, just then. I’m surprised she even kept them.”
Harry, however, was falling back into the thoughts that had flooded him all morning. His shoulders were tense, and he sunk low in his seat, arms and chin resting on his desk. His fight with Sirius had started out so simple. A simple conversation. Then it had escalated into Harry screaming and swearing at Sirius. Why did he go off like that?
