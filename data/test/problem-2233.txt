Harry smiled to himself, before pitching his voice low and calling out, “Malfoy, please! I promise I’m not! There’s these funny pains shooting through me.”
But this morning, he was late, leaving Harry to fend for himself and stare fixedly at his food while his friends giggled and blushed and flirted with all the elegance of pubescent Mandrakes.
After Draco had stormed out, the Great Hall had burst into noise. Harry had collapsed down onto the bench, pain and guilt throbbing through him. He had said horrible things to Draco, things that he didn’t even mean. He had just been there, looking at this proud, beautiful boy who would never love him, and something inside of him had broke. Even now, it was prodding jagged corners into him, every breath reminding him of the wound.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Honestly, Weasley, did you grow up in a wizarding household or not?” He casually flicked his wand at the paper, not failing to notice Potter biting back a smile at his ‘scourgify’, evidently reminded of another ink spill caused by the fluctuation of a very different emotion.
But here Malfoy was, standing a few feet away from him, dressed in Muggle clothes, navy scarf and a dark grey peacoat. He was taller than Harry remembered him and he had grown into his sharp edges, the lines of his jaw and nose now aristocratic rather than pointy.
After a few hours of driving, the bus rattled to a stop on the edge of a quaint village, the sign announcing that it was indeed Painswick. Thanking the driver, Harry stumbled out into the cold air, legs slightly numb from sitting for so long.
Draco was vaguely aware that the rest of the hall had gone quiet as his and Harry’s shouts echoed across the large space, but his blood was boiling too hot to pay much attention. This was too far.
He could hear Malfoy close behind him, the other boy finally catching up and tackling him to the ground.
The words were meant to come out mocking, but to Draco’s surprise, he felt a flash of something warm and unfamiliar go through him instead. To his utter horror, he realized that he was blushing slightly. Sweet Salazar, he hoped Potter chalked the reddening up to Draco’s cold and not his off-hand semblance of a compliment. That couldn’t be it anyhow. What an absurd thought. But there it was again. That strange heat curling through his insides as he examined Potter’s face, noticing each strand of dark hair that was falling across his famous lightening scar. Fucking shit.
The crowd fell into an abrupt silence, although this was due less to Malfoy’s words than the realization of his presence. More whispers began snaking through the on-lookers:
Exhausted, Harry stepped out of the main room, sagging against the wall in the quiet hallway outside. His black robes pooled on the floor as he sank down to rest for a moment, leaning his head against the wall in a moment of blissful peace. His head throbbed from a combination of the relentless noise and the multiple glasses of champagne that he had sipped away at throughout the evening. Taking off his glasses, he massaged his forehead, willing the pounding to stop. He fished his pocket watch out of his robes. It was nearly midnight. Well, that was some blessing at least. For appearances’ sake, he and Draco would have to mingle for half an hour more, but after that, they could Apparate back to their flat and sleep into tomorrow afternoon.
Malfoy snorted. “Didn’t know Granger had you so into taking notes that you did it for Quidditch too.”
“I’m going to have to teach my dad this one,” Weasley said. “The chips alone would fascinate him. Maybe I’ll get him a set for Christmas.”
“I know. I just fell asleep quite early last night and didn’t get a chance to have supper, so I thought I’d make myself some breakfast. I’d hoped not to wake anyone up but . . .” Harry gestured vaguely towards Malfoy.
The Slytherins looked around with blatant fascination as they came out into the Gryffindor common room. It was so different from their own, all cushy furniture and worn carpets and cozy warmth and red and gold absolutely everywhere.
Harry glanced over at the Slytherin table to see the blond cursing while holding a slim hand to his head.
Harry looked up so quickly from his breakfast bowl that he felt his neck begin to ache. The meal had been strangely silent so far, the two of them sneaking glances at each other when they thought the other wasn’t looking. He was desperate for some break in the tension. “Yes?”
“No, that’s not it, Ron,” Harry said quickly, seeing the murderously protective glint in his friend’s eyes. “He just, he kissed me.”
“I was just wondering what colour you would like your dress robes in,” she repeated, feather quill poised over her parchment.
Harry had always enjoyed Christmas Eve. The Dursleys were a bit more relaxed, softened by alcohol and Dudley’s preoccupation with presents, so he’d been able to sit unnoticed, munching on leftover treats and enjoying the sight of the glittering Christmas tree. It had always been a peaceful time.
Harry had wanted to spend the next day exploring Painswick a bit more to scope out good stores for Christmas shopping, however when he woke up, snow was falling so thickly that he knew he would have to postpone his reconnaissance for another day.
“And then I was hoping that you and I could work out some plays with the Beaters to improve our defense,” Ron chattered brightly in between heaping bites of food.
“Honestly, I’m a Slytherin, not an idiot!” Malfoy scoffed, leaning forward to rest his arms on his knees. “I’ve seen how you two look at each when you think the other won’t notice. In case you’ve forgotten, I’ve eaten at least one meal a day with you for the past couple weeks and during that time, I’ve had to watch you stare at each other like you’re Christmas dinner and a rare manuscript respectively!”
“You better. I’m not having it get out that I only pretended to date someone. My image will be damaged enough by this ruse already and if you make it worse, I will hex your hands off,” Draco said matter-of-factly, finally releasing Potter’s arm.
“You’re very good at that, Potter. Being nice,” Malfoy commented distantly, abruptly turning a corner onto another street.
“I had to!” He whispered back, tugging Draco down beside him as he slid into his seat. “They never would have fallen for it.”
He shrugged, half smile playing over his lips. “Well, that happens to work out quite well then, because it just so happens that I also, against all odds, like you, Harry Potter.”
And, house’s owner aside, there was no better place to find it than 9544 Magnolia. Harry spent the morning reading on one of the overstuffed sofas in the living room, unable to remember the last time he had sat down and read a book simply for pleasure.
Draco rolled his eyes, bursting into an explosive series of sneezes before he could refute Ron’s point.
Draco had barely said two words to Pansy since she got back from break. He knew that she was bound to ask about how his time with Harry had been and that he wouldn’t be able to sum up a smile anywhere near convincing. So he had pretended not to hear her when she asked if he wanted to walk to breakfast together on the first morning back, instead disappearing inside of his dorm room mumbling something about needing to change his tie.
“Shall we meet outside the Great Hall for dinner?” Malfoy called out, a hint of laughter colouring his voice. To be fair, the whole thing was rather absurd.
“And women,” George amended. “We are about to have the fight of a life time on our hands. Some of your comrades may fall, but I tell you, we cannot stop to mourn until we have disposed of all enemy forces. Do I make myself clear?”
Mouth suddenly dry, Harry simply nodded and quickly turned back to watch the game. What had he gotten himself into?
“I was reading up on why that might be,” Hermione interjected excitedly, slamming a large book down onto her and Ron’s shared desk. “And it’s likely due to psychological impact through—”
“Hi there, Colin,” Harry said, surprised to see him. In stark contrast to his second year, he and Colin had barely spoken to each other in years, the only incidents occurring when Colin and his brother, Dennis, had joined the DA in fifth year. “How are you?”
“O’Leary very much enjoys his work with Mr. Malfoy,” the elf added sincerely, looking over at his employer kindly.
“No, it’s cinnamon, not roses actually, but not a bad guess for someone with such an unrefined palette,” he begrudged. No! This was Potter! He did not need to begrudge him anything! Merlin, maybe he was running a fever? Yes, that was it. Definitely. The only logical explanation.
“Pansy!” Draco groaned, already questioning whether actually doing as Potter suggested and bringing one of his friends to play this Muggle game was a mistake.
was when he was with Harry. Not heir to the Malfoy name. Not a lackey of pureblood ideals. Not a sneering schoolboy.
“Wha- ohh.” Weasley’s eyes widened and he scrambled up from his chair so quickly that he nearly knocked it over. “Riight.”
“Roses,” Potter said faintly when he finally managed to shut his mouth. He nodded, saying it again, more firmly: “Roses.”
Malfoy shrugged. “Not usually. But I’ve come to quite like the tree, so maybe I’ll enjoy this too. Besides,” he pinked slightly. “We haven’t exactly even been on a real date yet. This could be our first proper one.”
“Of course,” she said, filing their orders away behind her desk. “Your robes should be ready with a week to spare before the term starts.”
“While that may be true, I think even you know what Polyjuice potion is,” Malfoy said, watching him with a careful glance.
“So,” Harry said, biting back a shiver as he and Malfoy began to walk down aimlessly down the street in the opposite direction. “What do you want to do?”
Pansy frowned, brushing a stray wisp of her dark hair out of her eyes. “But isn’t due for another week.”
“About the mistletoe.” Malfoy nodded up towards the deceptively innocent looking plant. “He really can’t continue to be putting this up everywhere or I’ll never be able to leave my room again without worrying about getting stuck.”
A sharp popping noise caused them to spring apart, looking wildly around for the source. Sparkling fireworks hung in the air around them, crackling with magic fire as O’Leary sent more of them off, filling the living room.
The two of them set out on the freshly plowed road, Harry still not entirely sure why he had actually asked the Slytherin to come along. The town wasn’t that big so it wasn’t like he actually could have gotten lost. Maybe he really had hurt himself during that snowball fight. Given himself a slightly concussion or something. Yes, that must be it.
“Pfft. You can’t believe everything you read, Potter,” Malfoy chided, placing elaborate swirls of icing across the roof. “Now, I think that we should go for a monochromatic colour scheme to represent the political and artistic repercussions of the Muggle industrial age. A treat for the eyes and the mind.”
It took Harry a moment to realize she was done talking and was now waiting for a response. “Sorry, am I interested in doing what?” He asked, confused.
Startled, Harry dropped his wand, causing the cloud to vanish. Before he had a chance to retrieve the wand, a girl with softly curling brown hair and a Hufflepuff tie picked it up and handed it to him.
Crabbe and Goyle hauled themselves up into the carriage, but Draco paused for a moment before handing Pansy up, gazing at his friend. She tipped her head, a slight smirk curving her reddened mouth.
“Nice! Now it’s your turn. You can either dare me to do something or ask me a question that I have to answer truthfully,” Harry explained, step skipping a bit lighter. He knew Malfoy wouldn’t back away from a competition, especially not one against him.
“I still hate you,” he said, reluctantly pulling back an inch, still tightly gripping Potter’s robes.
“Morning,” Harry said numbly, taking a step forward, just close enough to the mistletoe that he felt the spell grab onto him, holding him in place. At the same time, Malfoy stepped within range and immediately stopped in his tracks, frowning as the sensation of the spell came over him. He looked up, going white as he saw the small plant attached to the doorway.
“No,” Draco admitted. “If I did, they made Dobby read me the rest of it and he never could do the voices quite as good as Father.”
Ron hummed ponderously, snapping Harry out of his guilty reverie. “Maybe Malfoy is acting so strangely because he thinks he took the act too far and you’re planning to hex him for kissing you. I mean, it’s a fair assumption. I was half-wondering it myself.” He shrugged, grinning apologetically.
Malfoy shrugged, still smiling with that ‘gotcha’ expression that Harry remembered all too well. “You said that I could ask you any question and you had to respond with the truth, so I don’t see how this isn’t fair. I’m adhering to the rules of the game. Surely you’re not suggesting I should cheat, Potter?”
Draco blinked, insides twisting guiltily, although why he could not fathom. His pureblood societal manners prickled at him for his prolonged silence. Mouth moving to give a response before his head could catch up, he casually remarked, “You have nice eyes.”
“Mr. Malfoy shouldn’t stay out in the cold so long,” he scolded, betraying the worry that he too had been feeling.
“Ugh, Potter, you’re such a worrier!” Draco complained, but he softened his words with a teasing smile, running his hand through Harry’s hair one last time before stepping back.
Puzzled, but with a growing shiver of excitement, Harry watched as Hermione ducked into the other room and returned with the paper, eagerly shaking out the folds as she sat back on the couch.
Draco quietly picked away at his food, the surrounding roar of whispers taking away his appetite. He speared a single pea on the tarnished tines of his fork and swallowed, barely tasting it.
“Hey, hey!” Harry soothed, reaching out to take his hands. “I was just joshing. Everything will be fine tomorrow and no one will ask you to prepare any kind of food, I promise.”
At Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it was common knowledge that Draco Malfoy’s favourite class was potions. Now, whether that was because of genuine interest, or the fact that his position as Snape’s favourite student always had a hand in earning him good grades, no one could really say. And Draco would not give the rumour mills the satisfaction of a definite answer, shrugging the question off whenever anyone got up the nerve to ask him. He took a secret delight in keeping an air of mystery about the whole thing. Besides, he would much rather that the school was busy discussing his subject interest rather than his interest in a far different thing. Namely, a certain messy haired Chosen One whose very presence inexplicably made Draco feel as though he had a constant stream of Felix Felicis running through his Pureblood veins.
“I’m sorry, sir, I didn’t mean to offend you. I was just saying that our peppermint mochas were excellent,” the barista said timidly.
Barely keeping a straight face, Harry said, “Well, because you’ve been telling me about them for the past three hours.”
After the shenanigans with the mistletoe the day before, Harry holed up in his room, not sure if he could look Malfoy in the face and pretend everything was normal.
"What are you talking about? You're my partner." After a pause, he added, "And you're not going to die."
"Scarhead!" Someone yelled behind him. "Oh God, sorry, my dog ran behind some blasted cat… Oh, it's you."
Harry looked down and his stomach fluttered when he saw Draco through the lit up window. He tried to catch his attention but Draco wasn’t looking up and he soon moved away from the window.
When he rose from the table, a paper crane landed on his plate. He picked it up, knowing full well who it was from. He read the note inside with a bit of annoyance.
“I thought…” He stopped and opened his eyes to look at Harry in the eyes. He didn’t talk. He just shrugged. The git.
“Hey.” Draco tries to show a reassuring smile, but he suspects he doesn’t really manage. He’s nervous too, but not for the same reasons, probably. He hands him a small package, the manila paper neatly folded over a wooden box with two phials inside. “Here it is, two doses as promised.”
If Harry didn't know better he would think that Malfoy was flustered… By him. He turned his head, looking for confirmation, and made eye contact with Hermione, who had raised her eyes from her book again and looked from him to Malfoy with narrowed eyes.
And then Potter's expression changes to one of surprise. "Did you feel something?" Draco asks, eager.
“This is stupid,” he muttered but threw one sugar cube through the window anyway. He had good aim, and the cube hit the correct window, but it didn’t make the noise he expected. Draco probably hadn’t even noticed. It did upset a stray cat down below, though. It seemed the noise of the scared animal colliding with a rubbish bin was enough to wake up some neighbours, as some more windows lit up, but there wasn’t any movement in Draco’s flat.
Draco takes his wand and exhales. “Ok, let me help.” When the phial is empty they both stares at the still body. Slowly, Dudley’s breathing becomes less shallow; the heart rate rises slightly, a signal that the body is responding to the potion and trying to get the restoring fluid to every inch of his body.
It’s not that he lacks the knowledge to treat a muggle, he has excelled all his exams, and he is as proud of his A grades as he had been of his Outstandings at Hogwarts; he has worked hard for his grades. He is still baffled by the Muggle world and has struggled with all the misunderstanding and nonsense, because seriously, there's so much nonsense. But he has found help and some unexpected friends.
“I didn’t cheat. I passed. Until I messed it up at the end and… then, they failed me. Temporarily.” Potter raised his eyebrows and that was almost enough to crumble Draco’s resolution of not telling the whole truth. Almost. Because Potter doesn’t need to know that the sudden appearance of a cyclist made him push the brakes so suddenly that the examiner hit his head with a sickening thud, and he had to obliviate him, not for the quickly growing bump in his head, but for the fact that the cyclist was floating two feet in the air, confused but safe. So, he got his license but he hasn't been able to drive since then. “I panic just thinking of driving.”
“Uh, I… don’t think this is so difficult Potter: you open the phial and makes him drink it. If the result is as expected, repeat until total recovery.”
The third day in a row that the sodding moron tried to prank him - and succeeded - Harry thought that, really, after their argument the day before he should have seen it coming. It was Saturday and they had agreed on meeting to work on the group project after breakfast, in the eighth year’s common room.
“We’re still looking for the old man living in the other house. There’s a lot of debris and the structure could collapse, so we are working slow. The other affected house is empty, so…”
Once inside the resting room, Draco is unable to relax so he resolves to pick his book and distract himself. Liam is already napping, just in case the night, a Friday one, gets busy.
Saturdays are one of the busiest nights of the week, close after Fridays, so working both nights in a row leaves Draco knackered. He changes slowly and walks at a leisurely pace to the exit, wondering if he should stop to buy some groceries on the way home or go home directly to crash on his bed, when he notices him: an unmistakable, blond, obese man with a big moustache, smoking at the hospital door.
"No, listen, listen, I can drive them here and you can patch them up, it would be like team work. By the time I’ll finish my studies you'll be a doctor, right?"
The man snorts, but Potter’s aunt grabs his husband and hauls him out of the room before he can say a word. “We’ll leave you alone, and we’ll keep anyone from coming in.”
Saturday is Draco’s day off, but he switches schedule with one of the younger EMT, to have Monday free and be able to accompany Potter. Changing a day shift for a night one works against him, but Draco won’t tell Potter, of course. Merlin knows that he doesn’t need to know how much Draco is willing to do to accommodate him.
Draco tossed up his hands. "I would have got verbal admonition and maybe a couple weeks of community service! That was all! But
"Prick," Harry said. Draco heard him moving close and startled when a warm hand pressed against his forehead. "You're freezing, you berk."
Potter half smiles. His eyes are still sad but something akin determination starts to show on his face. He pulls at the cork and moves towards the bed.
"Believe me, I know. Remind me never to do another training session with you. I still have aches in muscles I didn't know I had. Still, what's with you and food?"
Robards steepled his fingers and looked as if he was at his last thread of patience. “Mr Malfoy, you may not be aware that Mrs Solomon has filed a complaint. So, I’m re-assigning you to another partner
"Don't you fear you'll be fired anyway? Listen, I'll just sit there with you, and in case something happens, I'll be there."
Harry laughed and started walking in the direction his wand pointed. "Probably," he said, then scrunched his nose. "She got upset with Ron when he joked about this mission."
He turned towards Harry, who sat on a striped armchair, tired but unharmed save for some bandages on his fingers where splinters had landed. "Is that another example of your legendary luck?"
“I’ve done this before,” he says with a wink. Draco wants to stop him right there, he fears he’s going to expose himself, to expose their lie, but apparently Liam only wants him close to boss him around and probably mark his territory to a potential new addition to the team. If Potter’s presence goes unnoticed by their superiors, Draco makes a promise to do some donation to some charity cause, in gratitude to some deity up there.
They arrive in front of a door, near the end of the corridor, and Potter knocks. His uncle opens the door and narrows his eyes. He opens his mouth to spit out some rash comment, Draco is sure, when he spots him behind his nephew and blanches.
Green eyes meet with his, and the thick eyebrows rise. There’s a question there. Draco inhales and straightens his posture trying to remember what about the whole conversation was. The box, the potion, right.
“Oh, well, I’m impressed…” Harry faltered at the sight of the white-blond hair that appeared under the knitted cap. He’d never seen anything like that. “Er, I mean…”
A bit later, the door opens and he thinks, momentarily relieved, that Carl is back. He's wrong, though: the door closes, and nobody enters. He sits back in the cushions and stares at the ceiling. It was bound to happen, he has avoided driving for long enough, and now, he has run out of luck. It shouldn't be a surprise, really. Story of his life.
Draco's satisfaction is short lived as Liam, his accidental partner this shift, turns to him with a snarl. "You drive this time, I don't want to hear your excuses,
“Oh Vernon, I’m sick worried about our Dudlikin. What if Harry won’t… you know, do… that thing that they… do,” she says, trying with little success to find appropriate words without being too obvious. Draco could guess what they are talking about, though.
Harry inhaled deeply, trying to get his anger under control. He turned to talk to their other partners and ignored Malfoy for the rest of the morning. Well, he tried to, but the prat was nearly impossible to ignore.
“As if I would tell you,” he says. Then he remembers Luna’s words about Potter being less talkative, and how he has smiled like Draco haven’t seen before, and tries to soften his answer. “You’ll laugh at me. Endlessly.”
“In the Great Hall. Drinking chocolate the first breakfast. In first year. It seemed you hadn’t tasted anything so good before.”
They sipped in silence, Malfoy lost in thought and unaware of Harry observing him. It was understandable, really, that Malfoy liked his life here, wherever ‘here’ was. In all these years, Harry has seen him struggling, isolated… the only times he has seen him out of his shop or in another context outside his job-related interactions (and it’s true, it was always in interrogations) it didn’t go well. People didn’t treat him well; his surname still was a liability.
He sets a low fire and puts an alarm to remind him when the potion may be ready to add the final ingredients and goes to the kitchen to prepare a proper breakfast for his visitor. He has considered his possibilities and after discarding Granger, or god forbid, Weasley, the best next option was obvious: inviting Lovegood for a chat over breakfast was never a bother. Sometimes it was a bit disconcerting, but that was to be expected.
Harry shrugged. "Maybe the man is a chatter and will hold us up way longer than expected. Maybe I get hungry in the middle of the way there."
Draco covers his face with his hands and breaths in slowly before releasing the air in a huff. "Ok," he mutters between his fingers, "stop it right there, you're not going to do whatever you are planning, no way."
He only stopped his teasing when Parkinson entered the common room and shouted: "Sweet Salazar, Potter! Where did you hide those muscles?"
Draco groans. Potter is not going to talk to him again if he has left thinking he has crossed a line Draco didn’t want to cross. And he’s not sure if he wants to but… he doesn’t want to close that door just yet, does he? He… may be interested… What could he lose? He’s not in the magical world anymore so is not like the scandal would follow him here, right? Draco shakes his head, he’s getting ahead of things. A kiss doesn’t mean that Potter would date him. Would Draco want to date Potter? Draco blushes. Ok, maybe.
Short of breath, Harry stopped and leaned his shoulder on a nearby tree, his hold on Draco's legs wavering.
With a groan, he got up when the alarm went off for a second time and rushed through his morning routine. He managed to exit the flat in record time, his toast still in his mouth. He was so distracted looking for his car key that he didn’t see the man standing on the sidewalk, waiting for his dog to stop sniffling the lamppost suspiciously.
Draco’s face was half-hidden in the shadow but Harry could tell that he had raised an eyebrow. “Mine and half of the neighbourhood’s, apparently. Don’t you know how to make a call?”
Draco snorts. "Yeah, right,” he says aloud and then scrubs his eyes to try to dispel his sour mood. “I’m good." Another lie. He fights a sting of guilt because he really likes Carl, and he already hides enough things as it is. He is the best partner he could get as he’s considerate of Draco’s space and doesn’t mind driving even if he complains now and then. It's not so easy when he's partnered with any of the other EMTs.
Harry sat on the low windowsill with the warm mug cradled in his hands and was grateful for his foresight: tonight the city was covered in snow. He would have ended drenched, and with frozen feet.
"I suppose this is what they call karma," he said, offering his hand and pulling Harry up. He kept smiling and didn't let go of it when Harry stood on his feet. Harry suspected he was extremely amused at his expense, but he had a nice smile and Harry was distracted by his eyes to really care; he couldn't make the exact colour in the dim light of the street. "I'm Draco, Draco Malfoy."
They found some stairs on the farthest side of the tower, open to the void that seemed to crave victims falling from the uneven steps. The snow covered half of the steps, and Draco reached out to the wall with trembling fingers.
Draco shrugged again. “Don’t mind me, I’m a bit defensive, that’s all,” he muttered. “Would you mind a cuppa? For the karmic equilibrium.”
"First," he says indignant, crossing his arms, "I'm not that hopeless, and I'm a fast learner, so apart of some minor missteps, I'm doing fine, thank you. Second," he mutters closing the distance between them, "is not as if there are many options on the wizarding world for a Malfoy. Not anymore.”
"Potter,” he sighs, the adrenaline rush has subsided and leaves him exhausted, he doesn’t have the energy for this, “it's your saviour complex talking, and maybe some hormone induced high thing. People can die, and knowing you, you'll feel responsible."
"Very well," Robards said, his tone dangerous. Draco wished that he didn’t fear expulsion from the MLE for attacking a fellow Auror. Otherwise, a fist in Harry’s face ought to shut him up. "Two weeks of suspension of work and salary! Both of you!"
Harry whirls around, wishing he could at least punch something if Draco isn't going to let him channel his anger into fucking. Instead, he drops to sit on Draco's sofa, leaning forward until his head rests in his hands atop his knees.
Malfoy pretends to faint in slow-motion, veering over sideways with his hand on his forehead until he's crumpled into a pointy blond pile on the floor.
"When have you ever known me to enjoy things that aren’t difficult?" Malfoy asked, and it was Harry's turn to snort.
The queue moved forward, bringing them inside the cafe. A wizard in a window seat played a harmonica, while two witches near him worked on a crossword puzzle that shone in the air like a hologram. Harry watched as Malfoy's eyes were drawn to the puzzle.
Today, the assistant was a middle-aged wizard with greying hair who wore a pair of mustard-yellow traditional robes in a thick brocade fabric. He looked like a nervous canary.
Malfoy is wearing the Muggle shirt he had on at that club, the loose maroon collared bowling shirt. Harry blinks. It seems wrong that he knows how that shirt felt under his hands. Malfoy looks good—his eyes sparkle with the mirth of having gifted Harry something truly horrible.
I don't think. I take a big step past Potter, out from behind the screen. As I pass him, I whisper, "
"I'm fine," I claim, sure I still look green from the nausea. "It was not pleasant, but I'm not dead."
Draco laughed, but mentally added 'read up on blowjob technique' to his to-do list. He'd have to carefully consider his internet search terms for that one.
"Fine." Draco sat up, resigned. "Oh, by the way, my mother Flooed. She is concerned that a non-magically-bound wedding ceremony performed by your son won't be recognised by the Malfoy Estate's entail."
A text from Lily: "Dad, tell me how to fill out an application to transfer to MACUSA. I am not even joking. I can't stay here. I just keep looking at people and thinking, 'you voted for R*mp, didn't you? And you!'" And from Albus, a string of skull emojis.
I study him, wondering if he's actually finding a way to be optimistic even though he's stuck with me in a fucking dungeon. But no—he still looks resigned. It's like he's asking out of duty, even though he knows it's futile.
, so none of it could possibly jinx the adoption. No clothes, no toys, not even any books or nursery decorations. Only
As they left the room, Harry asked curiously, “Do you actually think all jobs are crap, or did you just feel like arguing?”
Draco tried to keep his mouth shut, but the truth serum had other plans. "I would've asked you to dinner. At a restaurant with private rooms so you didn't have to deal with adoring fans or worry about getting dosed with love potions."
"It's capitalist nonsense, is what it is," Harry retorted with the fiery resistance of one certain he's right. "That bill practically makes it legal for businesses to nurture mini-Voldemorts!
be filled with shame, but is it really a music video that's going to make him feel that way? Come on!
"I guess there's not much we can do until we know exactly what he's prohibiting," Harry said, sighing and turning back to his onion.
"Doesn't seem quite likely." Draco popped a cherry into his mouth. He didn't want to brood about his parents—Merlin knew he'd done enough of that in therapy in the noughties. "Anyway, how's the little light of my life?"
Except Harry never looked like this, back then. Harry at the end of the war was half-starved and scraggle-haired, wearing clothes that didn’t fit and looking like the dangerous, slightly paranoid child-warrior that he was. This Harry doesn’t look like that. He looks healthy, robust, pink-cheeked, happy. And about eighteen. His red Christmas joggers are falling down on his slender hips, the years of treacle tarts and lagers and Shepherds Pie Wednesdays melted away.
Draco sighs. "At one point my mother instructed the elves to stop making it for me, because she was concerned about my caffeine levels. I was, apparently, having trouble sleeping, and she decided chocolate was the culprit. But I really love chocolate mousse—the good French kind, you understand—so I stormed the kitchen and instructed one of the elves to teach me how to make it."
"Breathe, Harry," Draco said, casting an orb of light that floated above their heads. "Are you alright? He's worse than I remembered. Every time, he's worse than I remembered."
Draco sighed, and put his fork down with a clatter. "I fucking hate hypotheticals like that. They're
Ron splutters, looking around as if he's being pranked, as if someone's going to stick their head out and tell him he's right. "Have you forgotten—are you two crazy?! Don't you remember what he's
“Is this like, your baseline level of cursing? Do you spend every waking moment of every day exercising self-control to keep them inside?”
"Did you know he died?" Harry asks, putting down his light zapper. "Dobby, I mean. Bellatrix got him; he died rescuing us." He swallows, not wanting to cry again, not now. "I dug him a grave and buried him."
Behind Malfoy stood a witch who was supremely distracted by a metal duck figurine, which sat in her hand, mooing. She was casting spells at it—presumably to make it quack, although Harry had long ago stopped publicly making such assumptions, because he somehow always ended up looking like an idiot when he did so.
Harry dreamed that Draco showed up at his flat in the middle of the night wearing a pair of stilettos and climbed into bed saying, “I want you to kiss me so badly, Harry. And if we kissed, it would really be sticking it to the man, wouldn’t it? You like that, don’t you?”
"Really bad," Draco agreed. "Hermione didn't have the full details yet, just the news that it's coming. He'll probably prohibit teaching 'foreign' spells, and possibly some of the cultural curricula."
“And it seems worth pointing out,” Ron added, “that everyone here seems to be complying with the dress code. Is it really that bad if we’re already meeting it?”
To be fair to himself, Harry thought, Draco hadn't mentioned it either. And neither of them had tried to initiate a repeat performance, either. Although Harry had thought about it. It had been so good, so easy. Of course he wanted to do it again. He just wasn't sure what
Jamiroquai has ended by the time Harry opens the door, and a piano melody starts up as he walks into the hallway.
“Yet,” Malfoy said, turning and raising an eyebrow. “What if I proposed that we should invent magical skateboards? There’s a career for us, right there. We’d get rich, there’d be plenty of interesting Charms Theory to interest me. There’d be,” he waved his hand, “cutting wood, or whatever it is that you like to do with your hands.”
Huh? Harry turned towards Albus, not understanding the question, and repeated the words in his brain. Now?
"Oh give me a break, Potter. We both know that's not true. Why would you be standing here right now if that were true?"
Draco looked up, and Harry found himself staring. Draco was pushing his hair off his face and looking at Harry in such an open way—not acting strange because Harry was the Saviour, not expecting Harry to have magical ability to fix things because he killed Voldemort, just seeing Harry for who he was and being willing to do the work together. Harry felt a flush rise from his chest and up his neck. He hadn't known that Draco knew so much about Lily.
"I've had outstanding ethics for exactly thirty-eight years," Draco said, looking somehow haughtier than usual with the strange face. "I won't make the same mistakes twice."
"Well, I think we would. Because we're both public figures, our sons are married, and we're thinking of the political implications, as much as I hate that. If it were real, I'd probably be annoyed at political concerns affecting our relationship."
"Right," Harry said, and sighed. "Fine. But if I fall in love with someone, we're cutting it off. No questions asked."
“No rest for the weary, Potter!” Draco quipped, summoning his wand. “I’m casting a Stopwatch Charm, ready or not, 3-2-”
Draco paused, and Harry had the horrible premonition that he might actually like a crystal sickle and hammer.
Harry huffed a laugh into Scorpius's fine hair, patting his back. "For this, I'll accept the nickname. See you soon."
Draco grinned, pressing his lips together to quell it as he pulled Harry's penis out of his pants. "It didn't require the last one to get you in bed last night."
was saying something. But with age, Harry had got at least a bit better about dropping things, so he changed the subject.
Andromeda looks tired, though she smiles at Harry as she tells him to come in. She's got Teddy strapped to her chest with some sort of wrap, which she starts untying so she can hand Teddy to Harry.
Harry knew from experience that the sofa was comfortable enough, though clearly not chosen for comfort. It was white. Harry had sat on it many times, but he didn't really want to sit there now, by himself. Maybe he should go help Lorraine. Maybe he should call Ron and have a good old-fashioned freakout—Ron probably wouldn't even blink, as it would come off as Harry being scared of commitment, which was of course a cultural expectation of men. Ron need never know that Harry's freakout was about agreeing to a decade-long marriage of convenience that required him to be Draco Malfoy's roommate in a much-too-fancy townhome with a vestibule.
"I like him, don't I?" Harry said. "I really like him, not just a little flirting, and that’s why I'm acting like an idiot. And I am a horrible person because I like someone who can't even tip a waiter properly!"
He knows he's being awful, that he's getting worked up over nothing. He knows that the fact that Hermione has an aunt doesn't
"With you." Draco's cheeks flushed with heat. "I'm not supposed to admit that if you say someone else gave you a better blowjob! I need to think of someone else! There was a solicitor named Marcie I used to fuck who had a tongue ring. She could do more interesting things with her tongue than you."
"I'd offer to help," Draco said, "but I think we both know we'd just be wasting my time. Besides, you don't need a Potions N.E.W.T."
"You're sweet." Hermione sighs. "The truth is, I don't have the energy to hate him anymore. How could I care about Draco Malfoy? Is that weird?"
"Oh!" Harry said, somehow swept up in Draco's desire for their decor to reflect their politics. He waved his wand in a silent Accio. A moment later a frame zoomed down the staircase and into Harry's outstretched hand. He walked over to the mantel and set it next to Draco's dove.
“Uh huh! Huh! No! Nope!” James, hand over his eyes, walked backwards out of the room, slamming into the wall with some drama before he closed the door. “Continue having a good night!” he shouted from the corridor, before his footsteps sounded up the stairs.
Draco snorted inelegantly and rose onto his knees, then dropped forward, head and arms landing near Harry’s head. “I will absolutely slaughter you.”
Scorpius flung his long arms around Harry's neck and squeezed. "Breakfast! You truly are the Saviour, Harry!"
They'd both just had birthdays, but still, Harry is eighteen and Ginny is seventeen. All of the Weasleys are deep in their grief over the loss of Fred and the others who died. And Harry is, quite frankly, a mess. He isn't sure what words to use to define the mess, but he is sure that he is some type of mess. Depressed? Traumatised? Who knows.
Ron turned the other way to look at Hermione, but she ignored him. “So you finished your worksheet for Penelope?” She gestured at Harry’s parchment.
Harry's head spun as everyone attempted to talk over one another. Lavender was pulled away and he wandered towards Albus, who had slumped despondently onto the corner of a sofa by the window, and sat next to him. Harry and Albus could always be counted on to lapse into silence when confronted with nonsense.
She paused, giving them a chance to speak, but they didn't and she continued. "You will brew it today under Professor Slughorn's guidance. It will then require a week to mature, and you will take the potion this time next week."
"Yes," Draco said, and Harry got the impression that he wanted to be more involved in this interview but didn't know how to interact with Lee. "They were best friends since they started at Hogwarts, so it's been almost twenty years that they've been close."
“Yes,” Draco says, smiling, pushing his hand against Harry’s chest. “But not until you’re back to looking your own age.”
"What the fuck am I going to do now?" Harry began to pace the two feet of the closet. "This has been my career for—for decades!"
Harry grabbed the lime fizz and, turning and letting his hand stay on Draco's back for a second too long, carried it back to Hermione. That was good, right? He thought he'd done okay. "Here you go, Mi."
Ever since they slept together (the second time), Harry and Draco have been sitting together in their shared classes. It feels like it should feel weirder. Harry feels like it should feel like they're sitting next to each other in the Potions classroom, like the ghost of Snape is going to appear and ask them what they think they're doing.
"We're okay," Draco says quietly. "I wasn't cross." Then, louder, "Though, I'm not sure whether you can really
“Are there any special dressing guidelines for the zoo?” Draco asked, looking into his wardrobe. He had already pushed through his early morning profanity and had wrapped himself in a dressing gown.
Draco looked flustered, but undeterred. "I certainly don't expect you to take a vow of celibacy for the next decade, so it seems prudent to discuss logistics."
What he did not expect was to open the door to Penelope’s office and see a familiar head of white-blond hair poking obnoxiously over the top of one of her wingback chairs.
"I know that. But still. And you bring up a good point. The only people who will be prosecuted are the ones who already vulnerable and—"
Harry tapped his finger lightly on the table. "Listen to the words you're saying! This makes no sense. I'm saying I like you. You're saying you wanted to be with me. And the conclusion you're coming to is divorce?! I thought you were supposed to be clever, logical."
Then, brilliant light through my closed eyes. Sea air, relieved shouts in the distance, the voice of the house-elf.
Oh. That's how they found out. Scorpius overheard them talking about—about what? About the dissolution of the vow. "We need your signature on our trust and wills, actually," Draco said, meeting his son's eyes, hoping futilely that Scorpius's hurt would diffuse. "You're the executor. The nullification of the vow meant we needed to change the other documents to reflect the magical status of our relationship."
If Harry had any doubt about his attraction to Draco (which he clearly didn't, despite pushing it out of his mind most of the time out of a swirling myriad of reasons), it would've been settled by the swoop of Harry's stomach, the tug of want he felt deep in his gut. Harry blinked, the smile dropping from his lips for the first time in hours.
"You're good at explaining this stuff," Harry said, leaning on one elbow. "You must tire of listening to us old folks, when you're used to the openness of teenagers."
“The motherfucking alarm is what’s wrong,” he moaned into his pillow, rolling onto his stomach and taking the duvet with him.
Draco hoped Lorraine was paying attention, because the vomit contingency was still in play. When he looked up, he knew his face looked as broken as he felt. He ran his hand through his hair, trying to settle his nerves and stomach.
Malfoy sighed. “I didn’t mean anything bad about Muggles. I was just trying to talk. Merlin, I don’t even know why I try.”
The wizard, who was wearing a pair of glasses with blue-tinted lenses, raised an eyebrow. "It's just
"Me too—yes—I'm in love with you. I'm not sure since when. It happened when I wasn't looking, if that makes sense. I don't want to stop being together. It felt like shit to hear you say you want to get divorced."
Harry found it hard to be in the same room as him. Something about proximity to Rump reminded him of the clashing of his wand and Voldemort's—or repelling magnets. It was like Harry's very existence was threatened by and threatening to the man standing before him.
“I dunno,” Ron said, waving his freckled hand. “You know how he gets in those letters. I can never keep the dragons straight.”
Something in my throat clenches. "True. Here's one of my grievances: I signed up for this, admittedly under duress, but I did, and yet the Dark Lord is still threatening me with werewolf rape. Or werewolf biting. Sometimes it's hard to know what, exactly, he's threatening me with."
have no self control? Draco, we've been living together for two years and the only time I have ever seen you cheat on the keto diet was when you had a butterbeer the day after Rump was elected. You bloody well have self control!"
"The night Dumbledore died—what did you think was going to happen, with the Vanishing Cabinet? It was clear you didn't think a whole mess of Death Eaters would come through and start shooting curses in the corridors. But—"
"God, you're hot when you talk about getting rid of all your money," Harry said, smiling but also clearly distracted—cheeks red, head lolling, voice uncontrolled. In a voice that sounded like an aside, like an actor pausing a performance, "Can I top you?"
"Mood," Draco said, sitting in the armchair opposite. He frowned. "Did I use that correctly? Is that what Albus is always saying?"
But Harry was a Gryffindor, and therefore extremely good at letting his stubbornness outweigh his desires, so he kept his mouth shut all the way to the front of the queue, through Malfoy ordering his bloody, buggering "usual," through telling Wren he was "fine thanks, and you?", through ordering a caramel latte with double caramel syrup, through standing awkwardly next to Malfoy waiting for their drinks, all the way until Malfoy grabbed his cup out of the air and walked out of the cafe wearing a stony expression.
"Thanks," she whispers. "Sometimes I think he will grow and it'll be perfect. Other times...not so much."
Ginny, face in a wide smile, pointed a finger at Harry. "Do you remember how you acted when James first came home? You told my mum she wasn't supporting his head enough!"
"The potion does what you’d imagine," Slughorn explained, "enhances the drinker’s imagination. It does not affect logic, knowledge, wishes, desires, or any of the mechanisms of the mind that lead to mental illness. All it will do is enhance your imagination."
They walk up the stairs to Harry's flat, and Draco subtly Levitates the bags Harry's carrying while Harry fumbles with the key.
After awhile, Malfoy sat on the stool next to Harry, back aristocratically straight. Harry stared at him for a moment, and then Malfoy slumped over onto his elbows, his body slouching like Harry’s. “Need to wait ten minutes.”
"Well, okay. What's wrong with it? Do you not like the colour? We can redecorate. Do you want to put out some of your own things? I can put up some shelves if you need to display your Order of Merlin in a prominent place."
"Are you fucking kidding me?" Harry asks, half laughing, half aghast that Malfoy is treating this as a competition.
"Shhhh," Harry whispers, peering out from his bedroom door. Draco stands behind him, and they're both wearing nothing but boxers.
Malfoy’s eyes twinkled with mirth. “A skateboard cult leader? Really, Potter? I saw a skateboard once when I was on an outing with Mother. I wonder what it’s like to ride and how they stay upright. I imagine there must be a charm in the wood, because it seems highly unlikely otherwise, don’t you think?”
Relieved, Harry smiled. "True. The only reason this whole thing works is because we antagonise each other, right?"
But as quickly as the numb look had crossed Draco’s face, he turned towards the watching Aurors, broke into a wide smile, and affected a dramatic bow—hand twirling and all.
“If you were the one injured, wouldn’t you want your mother with you?” she says in a rush with pleading eyes. He wants to tell her that her son is unconscious and it doesn’t make a difference to him right now, but that could be counterproductive. He also wants to tell her that he might have to do CPR, or to take some invasive measure, or that her son could die before arriving to the hospital. Something must have shown in his face because she speaks again, her voice wavering. “If-if you were to die wouldn’t you want your mother to have the chance to hold your hand?”
that he picked up this morning. Apparently, the guy Luna is going to travel with is the grandchild of
Ah, that's kind of easy. "Uhm, that would cost you at least a medium sized box of chocolates from Prestat."
“Are you… are you sure about this?” he asks, trying to look nonchalant while he’s perched on the kitchen counter and sips his coffee.
Draco and Harry enter the resting room in silence, brimming with energy. Draco turns and sees Potter beaming at him.
Potter smiles, and Draco thinks that maybe it wasn’t a mirage at all, and maybe it wasn’t suspicion what tinged Potter words. It’s definitely not suspicion now. “You studied for, what? Three years in a muggle university? All to get a degree and apply for a work in a muggle hospital?” It’s close to wonder. And admiration. And Draco doesn’t know what to do with that. Not coming from Potter, anyway. So he does what he never does: downplay it.
He made himself sure that the next two hours were torture for the pointy git. He sat next to him and leaned close until he could count the freckles on his nose.
He let Harry glare at him, a comfort of sorts. He wouldn’t mistreat a colleague on the brink of death, right? So maybe he wasn’t dying. When the glare morphed into something different, and Harry clenched his jaw as if trying to control himself, Draco felt compelled to talk. “Okay, everything hurts, my chest and my head more than anything else. I’m dizzy and I —” He coughed “— I would kill for a drink.”
“I thought the Malfoys were still wealthy enough to not need to work, even after the trials and that stuff.”
He went back to the window and blew his mug. The familiar scent of the cocoa was reassuring enough that the unsettling feeling almost disappeared.
They run to the ambulance, Potter on their heels, and when they start to get inside, they hear the other ambulance coming. “Good, they can take care of the kid and his mother, let’s go,” Liam urges them.
They are the first to arrive. The neighbour is a young girl, mother of one apparently, who is sitting on the curb cradling her baby with one arm while the other hangs strangely limp on her side.
They shared a look of confusion and held their wands up, Draco with a stunning spell on the tip of his tongue. Better safe than sorry, he thought. The footprints continued deep into the forest and up to the top of a gentle slope. There, in a clearing covered with purple vines, a tower stood, menacing and imposing.
“My godson.” Potter pauses and raises his head, looking pensive. “Actually, your cousin too, I guess.”
It was a bother, really, more than anything for the enquiry that followed from his teenager daughter. She demanded (quite reasonably) to be the first to know when his father found himself a partner.
“I told you, I want to help him. He’s family after all, and even when he was mean to me back then, in part it was because of my aunt and my uncle’s influence.” He pauses. “We have even talked about it, he said he realised it was wrong.” He pauses again. Draco suspects telling him about this is not easy. “He’s not good at talking, you know? But he tries. He even said once that I’m not a waste of space. That’s more kind words than his parents have said to me, ever.”
“You should have warned me!” Edith yelled from inside the room, like she expected Draco to follow her. Which he did, out of need to defend himself. “You jeopardized the whole mission!”
He works methodically, trying not to get distracted by the reasons why he is doing this. He knows on a conscious level that he wants to be on Potter’s good side, maybe making him owe Draco a favour that he would reclaim on times of need, maybe (and this is what he wants to avoid dwelling on it) he wants to do something nice for him just for the sake of it. There are other things too, but they usually mess with Draco’s mood so he actively avoids thinking about them.
He’s not the irritating prat he antagonized at school anymore. Not even the self-centred famous poster boy that he hated back then. Or envied, most likely. Maybe he never was. The reality of it hits him like a bludger: Harry Potter was an orphan, with a less than ideal childhood that, he only suspects, was the reason why he acted like the rules didn’t apply to him. The reason why he stands in front of a menace to defend anyone, to save them. Like he saved Draco from the Fiendfyre risking his own life, even when Draco… even when he… Draco fights back a sob. And Potter, the big-hearted idiot, reassures him and tells him that he can call him next time Teddy comes to visit, so he can met him without facing her aunt if he wants, when Draco has only realised what an idiot he’d been his whole life.
“Shit.” Draco restrains himself from hitting his face with the palm of his hand, or with the nearest solid surface. How can he been so careless?
He shifted until he found a comfortable position, ignoring Harry’s glance and regretting his past decisions. Kind of. Maybe a quieter career would have been more practical, but his good choices had made sense: enduring Auror training, abiding by the rules and working alongside the Ministry’s finest, using his magic — his
Grey clouds loomed in the darkening sky, a biting cold wind licking at the back of Draco’s neck. It might snow later. Hopefully after their little excursion, when they were home in front of a warm fire — or at a pub, in Harry’s case.
That's why he drops his book and rushes to catch Potter and take him aside, to a more discreet place.
The book has another book’s dust cover of course, but he doesn’t know if a Muggle would be interested in reading something with the words
Draco’s expression looked pained. His eyes searched Harry’s before he lowered and fixed his stare on his polished shoes. He opened his mouth as if he wanted to tell something but closed it before he could voice his thoughts.
When the emergency call comes, Draco is surprised that he hasn’t got to guide Potter’s actions, until he understands that this part is similar to when hitwizards are called to a crime scene, or whatever it is they do on a daily basis.
"You agreed," Harry insisted, looking the prat in the eye. He grabbed a mug of coffee, an eighth year's privilege, and looked around for the sugar bowl. Malfoy pushed it forward and Harry reached for it to put two spoonfuls in his mug. "If you don't like it you can change it with anyone but me."
Eidth knew, just like he, that the forest wasn’t safe. They weren’t privy to the actual cause behind the disappearances, but the field reports had some basis. Yet she had ignored Draco’s misgivings and entered unguarded. When she finally admitted they needed to call for backup, it was too late. He didn't think their scare and subsequent row was serious enough for her to fill a complaint. One that would set him with a new partner some days later.
“I can live with the mystery. Besides,” he says, turning in the direction of the doors, picking his book on the way, “I’m knackered, my shift is over and I have an early shift tomorrow so… see you around I guess.” He says waving the hand with his book.
With the patient secured at the back, Draco is about to close the doors when Mrs Dursley jumps forward and grabs his wrist.
He glares at her, because, come on, as if Potter would give him a chance. But then, he thinks that they have had a couple of civil conversations and maybe, just maybe,...
“For the love of Merlin, could you lot please be silent?” Harry turned to the voice. There it was the git, peering from the other side of the partition curtain, trying to maintain his dignity in a hospital gown. Harry jumped forward and hold him in a tight embrace.
He bites his lip. That is utterly skillful manipulation right there. He knows she knows she has struck a chord.
Draco looks at Potter, and a sudden sense of mutual understanding startles him. The sunset light might be tricking his mind because he is certain that Potter's eyes weren't so green before. Or his brain might be muddled because he doesn't find the glasses so ghastly. Then, the git speaks and the mirage breaks.
Draco doubted they would be completely dry anytime soon, but he supposed Harry had a point. The shivering was severe now, and the pain made him clench his teeth and grunt. He closed his eyes and felt Harry's hands on his shoulders, steadying him. Draco hadn't realized he was losing his balance until then.
Harry was still sitting in the same spot he was when Draco had slumped onto his side and closed his eyes, vaguely thinking that it was only going to be for a tiny second. The light was dimmer, so either the blizzard was raging out there, or much time had passed since they’d found shelter in the shallow cave.
as a title. Though in his short experience with them, he knows that there’s always someone who would contradict his expectations. Even if that someone went so far as to open it and read the chapter about, let’s say,
On Sunday he went to the quidditch pitch to fly before the sun rose. That wasn't an extraordinary event, he did it as often as he could; it was just the hour what was exceptional. He'd been awake for most of the night, at times trying to convince himself that he wouldn't rise to the bait and hit Malfoy with a bat bogey hex; at times he pondered just smothering the idiot; he even considered asking George for ideas for his long due revenge. So he reached a point when it was evident that sleep wouldn't come and he thought he better be doing something productive. Or at least enjoyable. Hence the flying.
The moron averted his eyes and turned his mouth down in distaste, an incongruous pink coloured his cheeks. "I drew the shortest straw. This seemed the most likely place for you to mope."
Draco frown deepens. There's something there, something he can read between the lines. In Potter's words and gestures, in the conversation with his aunt, in his uncle manners... It is not only a teenage grudge held against their caretakers, a rebel spirit against authority. Not part of the family, Potter has said.
He tries only once to get Liam to drive, but he is more stubborn than anything, and Draco finds himself on the driver seat with Potter besides him, with a determined expression. Draco looks at him briefly and then at the steering wheel. He exhales, his hands are sweating, he even can feel the adrenaline rush that comes with fear.
Damn woman and her timing. She could have waited till the end of the party when Harry could have carried her revelation home and mull on it in the peace of his own house. Preferably with two fingers of firewhiskey.
But he wouldn't, right? He might not hold him in high regard but he testified in his and his mother’s favour, so there is that. Surely his Gryffindor pride wouldn't let him do something hurtful or stupid…
Their destination is a neighbourhood full of old houses, where an apparently faulty gas installation has blown up. The firemen are already on their way, and they expect two injured people: an old man and his neighbour, who has made the call. Besides them, another ambulance has been called just in case.
He looked out the window at the sky while waiting for the milk to warm on the stove: no clouds nor snow tonight. A sudden brightness on a lower floor on the nearer building make him look down. Ah, it was his sleepless companion. He smiled faintly and stepped away from the window to prepare his chocolate. It was reassuring in a way that he wasn't the only one awake in this big city. It was difficult not feeling lonely even when there were millions of people around.
After sleeping like a log on Draco’s sofa last night, he thought last week’s string of 3 AM awakenings might finally have ended. But it seemed that he would have no such luck. He stood up and dragged his feet to the kitchen rubbing his eyes with one hand. A warm drink would be nice.
“Ok, now what?” Harry asked as he rubbed his eyes under his glasses. That tarnished them so he took it off to clean them and looked up at Malfoy. He was staring at him, a little frown settled between his eyebrows. He looked... sad.
And Draco tries not to, but he can’t help being a little shit and teases him.  “You mean another one? You better be thinking about a way to compensate me. And I warn you, I have expensive tastes." Well, damn, that sounded more like flirting. Is he flirting? Well, what he certainly is, is panicking, more so when Potter laughs.
Draco’s first reflex was to refuse, just for the sake of being contrary — old habits die hard, he supposed. But something was definitely wrong. After some hesitation he complied, lifting his shirt as much as he could. His arms felt like lead, so Harry reached out and grabbed his shirt, sliding it up to expose his torso.
"Ok, I'll go with you," he blurted. He didn't know why he'd said that. His muscles ached and his entire body begged for the bed in his flat; its soft mattress and its flannel sheets were as inviting as the best of luxuries.
She smiled back and Harry could see the relief in her eyes. She was the youngest Minister ever and she still struggled to be taken seriously; even when she had made enough merits. Harry always got angry on her behalf.
“Happy?” Harry startled. He had been so lost in his thoughts that he hadn’t seen the source of his distress approach. Malfoy continued, unaware of how the dancing had lit his face with a healthy blush. “You should be. I’ve gave them enough material to be on the frontpage tomorrow. My mother will be thrilled, until I clarify to her that there’s not even a tiny possibility for Astoria and me to get together again.” He said with a toothy grin, like sharing a internal joke that Harry was hardly getting, actually, but who could blame him; he was too distracted with Malfoy’s hair - the braid was half undone, the dance must been enthusiastic - and trying to control the fluters on his belly.
Harry’s voice pulled him out of his daze. Staying awake and remaining lucid were getting more and more difficult.
“You’re not broken,” Draco blurts out. Potter looks at him, bewildered, and he rushes his next words. “Still recovering, maybe, like all of us, but that’s to be expected.”
Draco goes back to the resting room, deflated, and finds Liam and Carl there. He doesn’t want to talk to any of them so he picks up his book and tells them he’s going to wait outside for the next call.
He opens the door and walks briskly through the corridors, looking for Potter, but they are deserted. He could be anywhere. He could have Apparated home already.
“Monday," he blurts. "The potion will be ready by Monday.” Potter’s face lights up, and Draco tries not to preen. “Two doses. If… if it works properly, I can do more. It will work, of course,” he adds hurriedly just in case Potter thinks ill of him.
He struggled with his underwear, struggled with his shirt and when he struggled with his trousers he paused and narrowed his eyes. Did he grabbed the wrong set of clothing? He shook his head. Who's else's clothes would be?
“No, I’ve said it just for effect. Of course, I would, just… let me check some things before we make a mess of it.” Draco wants to scream, he is going to spend his day off researching for this dork, and he has volunteered. Great. He quickly takes his phone out of his pocket to capture Potter’s goofy expression.
When his alarm clock went off he thought that it had to be a mistake. He was tired and absolutely not ready to be out of bed.
“Three years and a half, actually. The first semester was a disaster.” he mutters scuffing a broken tile with his foot.
Harry, who had met Nicholas Flamel, wasn't impressed by the rumors; but now that he met the woman herself he wasn't sure what to think. She was small and fragile, her skin like parchment, but her dark eyes were lively and sharp.
He had gained a reputation as a very competent potioneer, though. That’s why his modest business was flourishing.
Draco flicks his fingers, and the cigarette flies from the man’s hand. He knows they’re staring at him with wide eyes as he walks by them and steps on the cigarette. He keeps walking with a satisfying sensation, more so when he realises it’s the first time he has accomplished any wandless magic.
She smiled broadly, reminding him of an sphynx cat. “Oh, I know, divination is not an exact science, as I’ve said, is up to us in the end. But I’ve seen things, as I always do,” she moved closer, “and I can tell you that your truest equal and the one whom your soul craves, is the one with fair hair that broke this bone,” she said tapping his nose with her crooked index finger.
Draco sat at his desk, a cold cloth pressed over his black eye, soothing and effectively blocking the glares from Edith and the other Aurors.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Precisely." He stressed, but his mocking grin softened the edge of his words.
“He often talks about you. Well, not so much lately, he doesn’t talk much lately; I told him that he should think positive to dispel any wrackspurt that may have infected him, but I actually think he’s truly gloomy.”
Draco hummed and closed his eyes, his cheek resting on Harry’s neck. He counted the beats of Harry’s pulse, like an anchor. He barely noticed when Harry moved and resumed his unstable advance.
Draco let him sulk for a bit, then his resolve faltered. "I admit the strength of your slug-vomiting charm is impressive," Draco mumbled.
"He's perfectly healthy," he says handing the boy to Potter and looking intently at his face. Draco expects him to panic but he seems surprisingly at ease. How and when has the clumsy prat acquired the dexterity to hold such a tiny human is beyond him.
When he approaches, her face has a healthier tinge, probably because Liam has given her some painkillers and the pain in her shoulder has diminished. Potter is crouched beside him, handing him an antiseptic and looking interested in all the proceedings.
“He and his lot are a bunch of useless stick wavers. I told you, Petunia, I don't trust… that funny business. And if that good for nothing is as good as they say, he would have done something already.”
“Mr Potter, you certainly carry the strength of your ancestors.” She paused, looking at him in the eyes. “And the capacity of love from your mother’s lineage.”
“Sir. Sorry, Sir, but I’m a bit confused. I’m supposed to run over the testimonies again with my partner.”
“Ok, since you are here, I need you to tell me about any allergies, any treatments, medical history…” Draco trails off while checking monitors.
"No 'but', you're going to get me fired." He raises his voice and winces when Liam stirs on the sofa.
“No, Harry, you idiot.” Harry turned around to look at him, surprised by the use of his name. Malfoy shrugged. “This was nice,” he said toeing the expensive carpet, “but that’s not it.”
Draco huffs. “It’s not my fault that muggle customs are incomprehensible, and the available guides are incomplete and inaccurate.” He gives him a look out the corner of his eye when the idiot laughs.
“I’ll let you know that I have completed my formation as Emergency Medical Technician with the highest grades and without any…” he wavers, remembering some embarrassing moments in his training, “major incident.” He blushes as Potter raises a thick eyebrow and smiles slowly. “Stop imagining, that probably didn’t happen.”
He couldn't remember when he started favouring it, but the first night he woke up covered in sweat wondering where he was and feeling like he was intruding in his own flat, he could only think about how he'd sold his soul for a mug of hot dark cocoa. So that night he put his coat over his pyjamas, wrapped his scarf around his neck and trotted down the stairs and out to the street. It was freezing, and the streets were deserted.
Draco kneels next to the man. He breathes, good, but the pulse is weak. He assesses the severity of the wounds and starts to work on them quickly after immobilising his neck. When Potter kneels next to him, he takes his hand and puts it over a compress on a bleeding wound and keeps taking care of the rest.
His shifts are made of moments of calm and books, and then, at any given moment… Bam! Running and blood and navigating streets full of people and vehicles at top speed. Adrenaline and wounds. Other people's wounds, mind you.
"Ha! Longbottom is a menace.” He quipped. The young Herbology Professor was intense whenever someone mentioned his “field of expertise,” but Draco thought he wouldn't mind listening to that. It would be useful to know. Although, he supposed that wasn't interesting enough for a pub night conversation, or was it?
“I would if it made any sense, Potter. We need a plan, you can’t just barge in and fight every curse they throw at you! It’s a wonder you have survived for so long without a scratch. We need a strategy.”
“We are the result of our family tree, but is up to us to decide if we reach our full potential or if we fight our heritage.” She looked briefly to the side and then stepped into his personal space. She lowered her voice enough that he had to stoop awkwardly to heard her. “You have a big heart, Mr Potter; you’ve erred, and you’ve lost. But all those things were necessary for you to find what is written for you in the stars.”
Harry put his mug aside and opened his window. The chill of the night made him shiver, his thin pyjamas not nearly enough protection against the cold winter air. He was tempted to yell, but the possibility of having to face the rage of the neighbours stopped him. Barely. He looked around for an alternative and came back with a bowl of sugar cubes.
He was like a ragdoll. A ragdoll that could puke if treated too roughly. He hoped he wouldn't though. He wouldn't hear the end of it. And he would be endlessly embarrassed.
She looks suddenly sad and moves her head in affirmative. He stares, itching to ask for more, but he isn’t sure he wants to know any details.
Then Harry blinked and turned his attention back to the door. Draco felt off-balance, as if something had changed right then and there.
“Can you keep a secret? Well, I suppose you can, given your history but, would you keep a secret? For me? I mean is not a big deal, it’s just… it’s...”
Draco opened his eyes and didn't reply immediately, sorting through all the reasons he couldn't answer in the affirmative. "It hurts.”
Harry flashed him a tight smile and took a mouthful of his coffee. Merlin he needed it if he had to put up with the insufferable git.
“I’m here you drama queen,” he says, positioning the stretcher next to the limp body of the injured man.
“You couldn’t have decided you wanted me to live with you that night,” Draco says, his head tilted, his hands holding his cup under his nose, hiding his smile.
Harry frown deepened. It was the first time Draco called him by his surname. “Of course I do,” he said in all seriousness. “We are… friends.” Didn’t Draco consider him his friend?
Draco sits in the driver seat and isn’t conscious of his lack of nerves until they arrive at the hospital and leave the man in hands of the emergency doctors. He has made it. He has driven throughout London without thinking about what could go wrong, just wanting to bring his patient to safety.
Draco leaves while they complain to one another. He really should stop with the lies. Maybe if he could talk to someone about the weirdness of his life… Perhaps he should write to Pansy… Well, he should apologize first, for not being in contact. What would she say if he told her about Potter?
Everything happened too quickly and too slowly at the same time: the runes lit and the ingrained charm splintered the door, and, to Draco's horror, Harry's wand. A warning died in his throat when he felt the blast hitting him, and the anguish of losing the grip on his wand was nothing compared with the fear at the sensation of losing balance and falling.
Green eyes lock with his, huge and gleaming. Draco expects rage, or shouting, or insults… he doesn't expect the way Potter's face crumbles, eyes watering and shoulders trembling. For a moment, Draco is frozen in place, his brain unable to process what is happening. So when Potter raises his hands to cover his face, displacing his ugly glasses, Draco just acts without thinking and picks them up, tucking them in one hand and then… he moves forward to hug the trembling figure in front of him.
“Wait, you don’t have to do this,” Draco says, a hand pressed on Potter’s elbow. “I mean, you can do it if you want, but you shouldn’t do it because they say so.”
On Wednesday Harry left work late again. He definitely should look for another job, this one wasn’t his thing. He looked at his watch; on the bright side, he probably would find Draco taking a walk with Scarhead and could talk a bit with him before crashing on bed. Until the cursed hour when he would inevitably wake up, that is.
Harry exhaled. It would be nice to have someone beside him. An equal. But after Ginny, once he felt ready to try - every time he had actually tried - it was a disaster. His public image preceded him, and Harry found that their preconceived notions set a standard hard to match. One even told him that "Harry Potter is not like that." The date didn't end well, of course.
Harry frowned. It was true, it was the first time he had tasted it. He had forgotten about it. “I hadn’t tried it before.”
Had his cousin died? He was stable but… you can't know sometimes, the internal damage may be worse than it seems.
Potter smiles and closes the gap between them. The kiss is quick, and Draco is so surprised that his brain is trying to catch up when Potter moves away, looking apologetic.
“I’ll deny it, I’ll say you have tampered with it.” When Potter keeps staring at him, he can’t help and asks again, “What?”
"The healers were at a loss," Hermione said, earning a glare from the healer present in the room, “They said that it was like you weren't really here, which is nonsense, really. There were some travel spells written on the floor but it was obvious they weren't activated in the explosion. We feared some substances were interfering, and you wouldn't wake up, but…"
"It's been a while, isn't it?" Draco nods, feeling guilty at having called her after a long time for his own interest, but she continues with a smile. "I've met this guy, he's truly interesting, and we are talking about traveling to catalogue the population of Occamy in India. It would be an interesting article for the Quibbler, don't you think?"
Considering the fact that Potter has appeared in what he thought was a safe place, a place where he didn’t have to hide, didn’t have to expect constant disdain; that some ill intended words from him to the wrong people could ruin Draco's carefully built present life… Well, he is ‘ecstatic’.
Harry straightened his posture feeling suddenly self-conscious. Madame de Voir was the most famous seer of her time. Rumor had it that she had predicted - and avoided - her own death several times, and she was old as fuck.
Draco huffed softly and swore under his breath. It was the barest of moves, really, but enough to upset his bruised ribs.
"Could you just be silent? Wait, who are you?" Liam asks pointing at Potter with an accusatory finger as if he's the cause of all his troubles. Draco's mind is blank, so Potter beats him answering.
Suddenly, everything felt surreal, like if the right here and right now was a dream, and he wasn’t really awake; like the real world was the one he saw moments before.
“Stop acting like it and maybe one day I’ll believe you." He paused. "And I didn't mean it like that, you sensitive prick."
Draco has come to the conclusion that Harry is impulsive but also stubborn, and every decision he makes, he goes with until the end. He wishes there is no exception to that.
It’s late into his next shift that he finds himself facing Potter again. Draco is sitting in his usual spot, holding and not reading his new book because he's been thinking about this same bespectacled git since they last met.
Things like, if anyone could save them both, it would be Harry; that he trusted him with his life; that he would rather die if it would prevent Harry from having to suffer the same fate.
Harry smirked, and watched him as he did just that. All the eyes were on them, even the photographer was having the time of his life. He had to admit that they were a striking couple: the picture of elegance and grace.
you take care of the newbie. If he messes it up, I'll blame you." With that he lies back down on the couch with his back to them, pointedly ending the conversation.
Once inside, the door closes with a soft click, and Draco snorts. “As if we couldn’t keep a door closed.”
“Then I would suggest making yourself comfortable because I don’t know if there is magic or not in this reality; or even if there is if we could find some help.”
Draco stops so abruptly that Potter keeps walking before he realises and turns on the spot, a couple of feet ahead.
turn to drive. If I refuse… I can be in trouble. I don’t really need the job as you put it. I mean, financially, I don’t. But I don’t want to lose my job. I… I like to feel useful. I like to think… I could even become a proper doctor, someday.” He shrugs,  feeling helpless.
Harry snorted. Draco didn't blame him. He admitted he was prone to dramatics, and that went against his credibility at this point. But this time he wasn't exaggerating one bit.
“Oh, not a prick, then, is that an improvement?” Potter huffs. Draco smiles. “I think we should clarify that, because now that I was starting to like you...”
Seriously, Muggles use those blasted cars as if they were harmless brooms, but the truth is Draco has seen more damage caused by those things that by any other source in his time working as an EMT.
“Oh.” Draco lowers his head and stares at his tea, frowning, processing the information that Luna has poured over him in the first five minutes of their conversation, greetings aside.
He complied and closed his mouth, even when he had a lot still to say. But only the tiny possibility that both of them would make it out of this alive held his tongue back, because all the things he wanted to say were utterly ridiculous. And embarrassing.
When he was close to their buildings he saw Draco sat on a bench, his eyes lost in the distance, Scarhead sniffling idly on the near bushes.
“No, I mean, I thought you were so full of your fame, back then, when the thing is... I was a prick.” Potter’s smile could split his face in two. “What?”
He rushed to the coat hanger, grabbed the first thing at hand to put it over his pyjama, and ran outside. He didn’t feel the snow hitting his face nor the one under his bare feet. He didn’t bother with the lift and ran up the stairs to Draco’s flat. To Malfoy’s.
Draco’s eyelids fluttered, but refused to comply. He wanted to rest, but the urgency in Harry’s voice prompted him to make the effort.
"Ha!" Harry's deep laugh resonated in the big ballroom, earning him a few disapproving glances from more respectable witches and wizards. He even thought he had seen the Witch Weekly photographer raise his head in interest.
Draco wants him to shut up, to stop him right there, and test if the tingle he's felt would come back with another kiss, but he's at a loss for words. Potter sneaks out of the door with a mumbled goodbye, and when the door closes Draco leans his head on it feeling like an idiot. Potter probably thinks he's angry, which he's not; or maybe upset, in a way he is; or maybe he thinks Draco won't talk to him ever, which is preposterous, really, now that they have talked several times without punching each other. And they have kissed. Merlín, Potter has kissed
Harry cast a quick cleaning spell to get rid of the trail of discarded needles that dotted the floor in a path from the door, the scent of fir already beginning to tinge the air.
Harry slid into his seat at breakfast. “Morning,” he said, directing the greeting across the table at Ron and Hermione, whose heads were bent together as they discussed something.
“Only stupid people would choose to be famous,” Harry said soberly, the high from the argument dissipating.
“Merlin, I’m sorry! I don’t know why— actually, no, I do,” Potter smiled wanly, embarrassed, something sharp glittering in his gaze. “Can I talk to you?”
A quiet cough drew Harry’s attention back to Malfoy, who motioned to the polished staircase on the other side of the entryway. “If you’ll just follow me to your room.”
“O’Leary said it would be easiest for him if we ate at the same time,” Harry blurted out in explanation, hand tightening on the back of the chair opposite from the blond young man.
Harry looked up from the table to see a familiar face at the table beside them: it was the barista from the coffee shop, looking remarkably pedestrian out of their uniform.
The airy triumph that Harry had felt only seconds earlier fizzled away into nerves as he sat down beside Malfoy, smiling wanly at the Slytherins surrounding him.
“But you shouldn’t have to,” Hermione insisted firmly, a sudden familiar spark coming into her eyes. The same one that Harry had seen before she punched Malfoy and when she had realized the line-up of potions was a riddle in first year. The one that meant she had an idea.
“Better luck next time, Slytherin,” Weasley smirked, cleaning his victorious pieces off of the board, and heading up to his room, leaving the common room nearly empty aside from him and Potter.
Harry shrugged, having trouble looking Malfoy in the eye as he came nearer, sure that he would see the lie in his eyes. “Not too long,” he assured him.
larosesombre has taken great pleasure in threatening me with this prompt for awhile and now here it is! Hopefully I did it justice!
A splash sounded below him and Harry glanced down to see a person thrashing in the dark water and screaming bloody murder in an oddly familiar voice.
Madam Hooch walked out onto the field to confer with the team captains before the game started. The match wouldn’t be as ugly as a Slytherin-Gyffindor game, but inter-school Quidditch games were always rife with competition and fouls were common.
“Until you bloody well dropped me!” He shot back, his renewed annoyance sending him into a fit of coughing and reminding Harry why exactly he had carried him up to the common room in the first place.
“Alright then, well what do you suggest?” Ron asked, attempted to navigate another spoonful of porridge and tipping half of it onto the table.
They continued down the road for a ways, until Malfoy veered off of the road, walking into a thick stand of trees.
“Really . . .” Ron peered suspiciously towards Malfoy, who was watching this whole thing with a look of utter amusement, to Harry’s relief. He had been worried that Malfoy would get horribly offended by the whole encounter, but luckily, he seemed more entertained than insulted.
“Very smooth, boyfriend,” Malfoy whispered in his ear, winking at Harry as he passed him to survey the contents of their table.
Harry gaped, thoroughly perplexed by his boyfriend’s behavior. Draco had put up a serious fight against even holding hands at public events and now he was throwing kisses around like it was nothing? What had happened to his ridiculously private boyfriend who eyed all forms of PDA with utter distaste and his patented Malfoy sneer?
“To the gingerbread house competition?” Harry asked with surprise, setting down his empty mug on the counter.
But he was abruptly cut off as Malfoy muttered something under his breath, turned to Harry, taking him by the shoulders, and kissed him on the mouth.
Finally, a mere two hours after they had started the endeavour, the first tray of cookies was placed in the oven, O’Leary sagging with exhaustion.
But Draco wasn’t angry. He wasn’t anything. Just empty. Exhausted, like every drop of life had been wrung out of him, leaving beating pulses of pain behind where it used to be.
“But, why?” Harry said slowly. “You’re not exactly the biggest fan of Christmas, if I remember correctly.”
“It’s nearly curfew though,” Draco tried reasoning, but instead found himself being wrapped up into his cloak and swept out of the library.
This time there was no mistletoe, no chaste peck to break a spell. Just the taste of snow on his lips and an undeniable wanting as Harry leaned into him, Malfoy’s hands tightening on his back.
“Well, because we serve tea?” The barista offered helplessly, edging away from the counter as they eyed Malfoy’s steadily escalating temper.
Harry saw the flicker of indecision in his eyes and continued pushing, “I promise if it’s weird at all, you don’t have to, but I’d really like you to come. I’d like to spend Christmas with you.”
I've never actually written Teddy or Andromeda before, but I've always loved them in Drarry fics, so hopefully I did them justice!
“You should get a Christmas tree,” Harry said, trying to tug Malfoy away from thinking about the mistletoe’s origin. “If not for yourself, at least because O’Leary will enjoy it.”
“No, no I’m fine,” Harry assured hurriedly, swinging his broom over his shoulder and grabbing one end-handle on the crate.
Suddenly Harry was jerked out of his sluggish thoughts by a near-collision with a tree. He swerved, only to smack into a particularly long branch belonging to the same tree. His broom was sent spinning out across the dark depths of the lake, out of control. All Harry could do was grip tightly to the handle and wait for the turning to stop. The motion whipped at his robes, tangling the black fabric around his legs, the force also nearly pulling his glasses off of his face. His stomach started churning with nausea and he closed his eyes, hoping it would stop soon.
Harry smiled. “And it was great to see you and Teddy as well. We’ll have to try and meet up some time in the new year.”
Stunned and looking as though only his required Gryffindor bravery was keeping him from quailing under Pansy’s scowl, Potter nodded slowly. “Yes, okay, th-that makes sense.”
“Merlin, why does everyone keep bothering me about getting a tree?” Malfoy complained, cradling his head as he fell back onto the ground beside Harry.
The third time it happened was after dinner. Harry went up to his room, only to find Malfoy trapped under a sprig of mistletoe in the middle of the upstairs hallway.
Draco was mesmerized by the sight of snowflakes caught in Potter’s dark hair, starkly pale against the black, which was why he didn’t pay enough attention to the mischievous smirk that served as his only warning before Potter abruptly straightened and flung his handful of snow into Draco’s face.
The front walkway that led up to the door was half cleared, the shovel used to do the job abandoned by the doorstep. Harry began to make his way towards the house, trudging through the snow covering the first portion of the walkway, glad to shake it off of his boots when he reached the bare stone.
The other boy simply nodded, eyes still fixated on the road stretching out in a seemingly endless loop in front of them.
Impossibly contented, Harry leaned back, enjoying the feeling of Malfoy’s hand in his and the controlled roar of the other diners around them. Under the customers’ noise, the faint sound of radio could be heard, the announcer saying brightly “And now for our Muggle Christmas special, ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’, by someone named Mariah Carey, sure to be an educational experience!”
“My, Potter, such flattery! Do you say that to all the boys?” Draco said mockingly, lips curled into a smirk as he got out his Charms textbook. “’You don’t look so good’! A right knicker-dropper, that one.”
Malfoy’s face was so close to Harry’s that he could feel the faint whispers of his trembling breath. His grey eyes were wide and fixated on Harry’s face as the two boys stared at each other. Harry could feel Malfoy start to shiver, water droplets still clinging to his porcelain skin in memory of the freezing swim that he had just unwillingly taken.
Harry eyed his friend apprehensively, wondering if he was stable enough to leave alone, before reluctantly grabbing his coat and making his way out of the dorm. “See you down there.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but led Harry over towards a cozy looking coffee shop with fairy lights hung around the front window. Inside it was bustling, a steady line snaking through the configuration of small tables, up to the counter.
Malfoy pretended to consider his offer, staring off into the distance as if in deep thought. “Fine,” he agreed finally. “Your terms are acceptable.”
“Anytime, Weasley,” Draco replied distractedly, searching through the stacks of books they had gathered from the surrounding shelves at the beginning of their study session. “Anyone seen
"Character A hunts for their gift, much to the annoyance of Character B who wants it to remain a surprise."
“Five knuts says I can lobe this one past that snow bank,” Ron challenged, beginning to swing his gnome.
Quickly bringing the water to Mr. Weasley, Harry hurried out after him, his breath hanging like fog in the cold air as he looked around the garden, finally spotting Draco sitting on a small bench among some bare-branched bushes.
Harry felt a sinking sensation in his stomach, much like earlier when he had first run into the blond young man. There had to be some mistake. He couldn’t be staying . . . Malfoy couldn’t be . . . shit.
“Would both of you please stop with the hysterics so we can go to class?” Hermione sighed, hitching her satchel up her shoulder. “We’re going to be late and then Professor Snape is
Harry groaned, tucking his head against Draco’s shoulder. “Are you sure you want to be tied down to someone who has a permanent entourage wherever they go?”
“Draco Malfoy, I have never been more ashamed of you!” Pansy shouted furiously, the volume of her voice hurting as much as the stinging remnants of her palm. “You’re telling me that you realized you had genuine feelings for Potter and you didn’t tell him?!”
Potter grinned dangerously, suddenly flipping their hands over so that now he was trailing his fingertips across Draco’s skin, sending an odd shiver through him that did not help his still twisting insides. “Because you were infatuated with me since before even then and you were jealous,” Potter pronounced smugly, eyes lighting with triumph.
“Merlin, you foolish, foolish bloke!” Malfoy said loudly, shaking his head and turning the page. Harry glanced over in surprise.
It was the afternoon the next time Harry tried it again. He wasn’t sure at what point it had become a plan. All he knew was that here he was, standing underneath a bundle of charmed mistletoe that he had conjured above the fireplace in the living room, waiting for the sound of Malfoy’s footsteps, heart beating unnaturally loudly.
. He closes his eyes, feeling suddenly teary. He wants to scream for no rational reason, or for a million of reasons, he isn’t sure. Then he feels a hand on his arm.
"Something about me missing Neville's rant tonight at the pub — about the correct way to recollect wolfsbane blossoms or something — only because of us being in mortal danger."
Since his divorce, the magazine had made a headline in every occasion he talked with someone in public more than half an hour at a time.
Draco rolled his eyes. He doubted Granger would omit information like that. When he got his energy back, he would have a serious conversation with Harry about listening to his friends.
"For Merlin's sake, Potter, what is that for?" Draco said the moment Harry Apparated at their meeting point and took a good look at him. The small pouch that hung from Harry’s neck clashed awkwardly with his red robes and darker cloak.
“Ok,” Draco mutters. “Here’s the thing, and you can’t tell anyone.” At that Potter makes the gesture of zipping his mouth. “I did my six months, here, at the Hospital, and… I thought… I... didn’t want to sit in the Manor, twiddling my thumbs, seeing the days pass with the only company of my mother; and the only perspective of receiving the solicitor monthly, to hear about the state of family assets. Because if the war has left us something, it is total isolation from the world that my father believed was ours to rule. And before you speak,” he says when Potter opens his mouth, “I know there are worse things, my father losing his mind and his freedom is one of them, others losing their relatives for good, their brothers, their parents, their sons…” He feels his body shudder with the horrors their actions and inactions caused. His voice is a whisper when he continues. “I needed to do something, even if I can’t fix the past, at least I…”
“I’ll leave you two alone to talk,” she said. Harry’s silent protest was futile and he saw himself on the company of that imposing woman.
The lab it’s a nice room, nicer than the dungeons at Hogwarts. Snape would have been horrified at the tall window, but Draco has charmed it to avoid air currents and he can drag a curtain to block the light for photosensitive potions.
Soon enough, the idiot stumbles through the sliding doors and Draco's hair raises as the sensation intensifies. He thinks that he can see the tendrils of magic if he squints. Potter's going to get him in trouble because really, any ruckus the Saviour could cause… they would blame Draco just for being there, that's for sure.
He expects Potter to shout at him and jump at every potential danger, instead, he’s silent but alert. Draco suspects he casts a wordless cushioning charm once or twice, or at least he thinks he can feel the tingle of Potter’s magic on his skin. The git is more than capable of it, even when Draco wouldn’t admit that much, not aloud anyway. He‘s definitely sure that he levitates a cat who jumps onto the road from Merlin knows where, bouncing it to safety.
“Er, uhm, no, he is healthy, he does exercise. He’s in really good shape, my Diddy. Since he and his cousin…” she trails off, “H-he’s never broken a bone.” She bursts into uncontrollable tears. “Oh my poor boy, my poor Dudleykins, Look at you.”
“Are you asking as a Law Enforcement member or as a…” Draco was going to say a friend but stops himself in time. They have never been friends, far from it.
He arrived at the common room just in time, a bit breathless, but in time. He spotted Seamus and Zabini already hunched over a couple of books. The supreme idiot was preparing himself a cup of coffee on the kitchenette - another privilege of the eighth year's students -, with his back to the door.
“I… think so. Do you think he…” Potter doesn’t finish, looking around, probably out of fear someone might eavesdrop their conversation.
"Yes. Biology. Except you should qualify your language to account for asexuals. Ace erasure isn't done anymore." Draco's cheeks were red. "But, yes, in our case, biology. Nothing to get worked up over."
"Shit, shit, shit, shit, fucking shit," Ginny whispers, her cheeks red. She hops up from the bed and peers at a calendar on the wall above her desk. "
"Is it going to wake Granger?" Draco's folded himself into a seat on the floor behind the coffee table, one long leg bent up in front of him, carton in his hand. His stomach is all bunched up from his strange position, and there's a purple hickey on his chest near his collarbone.
"Well I'd hate to start now!" Draco said, a hand gesturing. "I'm just wondering if there's some downside I'm not seeing."
"It's okay," Harry said, pushing him through the door into Azure Cup. "It was my fault. I shouldn't have egged you on."
"Cheers." Harry signals the bartender for another round. "Come dance with me and Hermione. The only requirement is that you have to dance poorly, and you can't act weird around us because the Prophet keeps calling us 'heroes'."
"You can't influence the policy of the entire LabMag party by bribing me with a workplace tryst," Draco choked out.
Harry sat, happy for a cup of coffee, as he hadn't had a chance to go to Azure Cup before Teddy arrived. A pretty blue cup flew through the air, landing on the table in front of him, and Harry grabbed the pitcher of cream from the centre of the table and poured some in.
Harry blinked. "What? No! I meant Rump. Rump is the thing I can't believe we need to live with, not you. This—" he waved a hand, encompassing the house, "is all fine."
Harry had tuned her right out, but he was glad her workshop had been before his so at least he had a general idea of what to expect.
"Yeah, but realistically…" Harry's excitement was contagious, and Draco felt himself lightening. "Can I request a meeting, to present to you my concerns about the party platform?"
Harry leaned forward, tilting his head and fitting it into the space between Draco's ear and shoulder. "I want to. I know it's not an obligation."
But when Draco was leaning forward on his desk, elbows planted, chin in his hands, hanging on Hermione’s every word, Harry couldn’t forget that he’d
for sensitivity checking details about Indian dress and culture. Also a note that Harry and Draco's grandchild was named via reader poll!
For a long minute, they stood in silence. Harry tried to gather his wits for the curious stares they would get in the DMLE offices, the onslaught of press and onlookers they would encounter in the Atrium.
All of which was to say that it had been a nightmare for Harry, who thought York was an incompetent prick, but who couldn't act as if he wasn't supporting his subordinates even as he attempted to update departmental training and policies to make sure that foreign spells weren't treated as automatically suspicious. The MLEOs were nervous because they didn't like being near people who were casting incomprehensible spells—it made them jumpy, and unlike their Auror counterparts, they weren't highly trained enough to recognise the quality of spells (Dark or not) by the magical aura alone.
"Oh for the love of…" Draco murmured. "Alright, so when I say we 'hooked up at a Ministry function', what I mean is that we left and fucked at one of our homes, in a bed, with no one else in the house. Is that better?"
"And then when we made an announcement, it wouldn't be completely out of the blue?" Harry asked, trying to wrap his mind around this insanity.
The file cabinets clattered open drawer by drawer and papers flew out, landing neatly in a pile in Jorgen's hands.
"No," Harry said, shaking his head. "I don't think so. I don't think she likes Rump, but I think she'd do whatever he said, because that's her job."
"I'm just trying to remind you of the stakes, Harry!" Draco said, his foot tapping in either annoyance or anxiety—Harry couldn't tell which. He only knew the foot tapping was a bad sign. The last time he'd seen Draco's foot tapping like that had been three days before Albus and Scorpius's wedding.
"Come on, Dad, kiss your husband!" Lily goaded. The entire table of traitors started chanting "kiss him, kiss him" and Harry rolled his eyes, turned to face a still-laughing Draco, and pressed a kiss to his lips.
Draco snorted. “Not hardly a yogi. But I feel better if I do stretches before bed.” As if to emphasise his point, his sternum cracked as he raised his arms over his head and back. “Are
Harry blanched. "We have to tell Scorpius about nullifying the vow? Which means we have to tell Scorpius and Albus? Which means we have to tell Scorpius, Albus, James, Lily, and Teddy?"
. I'm saying that I cannot be married to you when you agreed to it because of manipulation. Not when I…" He met Harry's eyes. "You're going to force me to say it, aren't you?"
"We're in our primes," Draco objected with a genuinely aghast expression. "In the loo or like, hidden in an alcove or something? Or in your office?"
Whatever Malfoy was drinking was leaving a faint green tinge on his lips, but Harry didn't dare bring up the contents of his cup again—not right now, anyway, while they were tentatively getting along, possibly for the first time ever.
“I certainly am,” Draco drawled. “Much as people might like to limit masculinity to a narrow, toxic box, and to throw insults at gay men, they cannot with any principle claim that I am not a man. And the code is very clear that
But no one was here to see, so Harry coughed and turned, pointing toward the penguins. “How’s your tolerance of rotten fish smell?”
Draco decided not to think about it, and pressed a kiss to Harry's face. This caused Aster to show off her 'kisses', and before long they all three were covered in a layer of drool.
Albus slid an arm around Scorpius. Draco's mouth twisted into a displeased expression. Harry sighed. A small part of him had thought something would intervene before Rump
When they rounded the corner, Harry, then Draco, froze. On the sofa, facing them, were Scorpius, Albus, James, Teddy, Lily, and Nico. And then, really topping off the sense of impending doom, on the surrounding chairs sat Hermione, Ron, and, glaring daggers, Pansy Parkinson.
Aster was crawling towards them with something in her hand. "Pop!" she said again, smiling, pointing her hand at Draco.
Penelope nodded, then added, "Unlike Serotonin Potions, the Draught of Pure Imagination is not a potion that can be taken often, as it can become addictive and distracting. Imagination is one of those faculties that is necessary in moderation but dangerous in excess, as it can cause people to withdraw from reality. Imagination enhances reality, but we cannot allow it to
Lorraine’s eyes grew even wider, and she looked between the two of them seriously. She snapped her fingers, enacting elves-only-knew what magic upstairs. “Consider it being done! Master Harry’s room will be looking like a perfectly tidy guest room.”
"You are so fucking ridiculous," Draco drawled into his neck. "And yeah, I want to keep doing this."
"Legally I can only talk about my personal life," Harry said. "As it happens, my personal life is quite political."
"Well, we are magic, after all." She dreamily waved a hand in the air. "Glamours could change the appearance of our vestments. For that matter, so could Transfiguration. Are they planning to use the Thief's Downfall or a similar incantation to remove all magical enchantments to our appearance? If one is using a Glamour on their attire, does this law refer to only the current appearance, all magic considered, or to the underlying reality absent enchantment? And of course, who is to say which is
Ron launched into a story about how Rose was reacting to the election, and Harry walked over to Draco to help him with the drinks. Harry supposed he could just imitate what Draco was doing. That'd be enough.
"Alright," Draco said slowly. "The matter at hand is this: I'm going to bid for the Ministerial election in four years. I know you understand the political situation well enough to know why I am a good candidate. The Blimps are a complete disaster. They're terrible on social issues, despicable on queer rights, detestable on treatment of all social minorities; they are confused on fiscal policy, backward on immigration, wand-happy on defense, and contemptible on international diplomacy both Muggle and magical. They have the backing of the pure-blood traditionalists—and the right-wing Blimps more generally—only because they're scared and their xenophobic fears have been stoked by Rump and the rest of them."
It bounced satisfyingly off the back of Malfoy’s blond head. A posh hand adorned with rings came up to touch his hair, and he turned around. When his eyes landed on Harry, they rolled skyward. "What the fuck, Potter?"
I gape at him. He's actually worried about the rat. I don't know whether to dwell on that, or the fact that he's just praised my Transfiguration skill. "Sure thing, Potter. I'll try not to hurt
"It is awkward." Harry was glad they agreed on that. The idea that every person he knew was probably being sent a link to that article right now…
It's cold. Harry takes a deep breath, pulling the sleeves of his jumper down to his wrists. He can do this. It's just the Burrow. It's just Ginny.
Draco stood on Primrose Hill, fingers wrapped around a paper cup of cold coffee, wondering how much longer he could avoid returning home.
? Just because we never went through a phase of infatuation and tearing off each other's clothes? Give me a break. We're adults. We've both been married and divorced. We both understand that infatuation wears off and what's left—what's at the core of a relationship—is simply being there, day after day." He paused for a moment, then added, "So there's no reason to think you're lying to your children."
Draco looked up at Harry, his face resting on his hand, fingers mussing his hair. He was a study in weariness.
Malfoy gave a small grin and proceeded to prattle on about sentient curses (many of them could read people's desires and adjust accordingly, so they required the Curse-breaker to Occlude while unraveling the curse) while Harry finished his quiche and mocha. Harry found that he didn't even have trouble coming up with responses and questions during Malfoy's story, because the conversation flowed naturally once they weren't trying to make boring pleasantries.
him? And we had this list of names, a long list, from when we chose Penelope to run—and we started going through it, and no one was good enough. No one. Hermione crossed off every name. My name got crossed off because I was single, and I remember laughing this really mean, wild laugh at the absurdity of it all—as if my marital status were the thing standing in the way of a viable leftist political strategy. How could
Draco's brow furrows. "You think my eyes are silver? I always thought they were boring ol' grey, but silver sounds much more dashing."
The smile vanished from his face as he walked out of the public area and into the lifts corridor. He leaned against the side of the lift to give his heart a chance to calm down, relishing the quiet and the vaguely disdainful looks he was getting from a witch in traditional robes.
She grabs a sweater off of a hook—it looks like one of Arthur's cardigans, it comes down to her knees—and leads the way outside.
," Harry said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out Wilhelm, little wooden eyebrows and mouth arranged in a suggestive, almost congratulating smirk.
“James is upstairs choosing a room right now. Once he’s chosen, can you please bring his things up? They’re in the entrance hall.”
"Of course not," I say. "Most places don't have magic like this. Only big wizarding homes, or like, Hogwarts. It's not exactly something one often needs to do. My father tried to teach me, and, of course, I ignored him. Something about giving the magic form? I don't know."
If anyone could figure all this out, it was Parvati and Lavender. Officially, Parvarti was the public relations consultant and Lavender didn't work. Lav had wanted to stay home with their kids, Ajay and Abha, which she had done, but even when their kids were little, Lav had been an integral part of Parvati's business.
"What the fuck are you doing?" Malfoy hissed. “Is the Saviour cutting the queue? What about Gryffindor honour?”
Draco opened his mouth to utter what was sure to be a protest, so Harry leaned forward and kissed him, a big, loud peck on the lips.
"You can?" Draco reached out, surprised to see his hand trembling as he placed it against Harry's cheek.
Jorgen paused, unsure what to do, so Harry yanked Wilhelm off the wooden base, allowing Jorgen to put the rest of the clock into the bag.
"Oh sweet Merlin," Harry said. "I will just go. Give me my sugary coffee—what did you call it, a death drink?—and I'll just go."
Harry buys tokens with a bunch of notes Malfoy hands him ("Will one hundred pounds suffice? I exchanged too much when I bought these clothes") and Harry lets Malfoy lead them around the arcade, looking at different games.
He's talking to Neville when Malfoy walks in carrying an ancient-looking bottle. Malfoy scans the room until his eyes meet Harry's, and he strides over, brandishing the bottle. "Potter! I figured it out. It's aged in a troll stomach! Here you are, may it bring blessings on your home."
And not everyone is, not everyone survived—but this is a lot of people, and they're here, and alive, and maybe broken, but they're here.
Or maybe not, Harry thinks, as Malfoy rolls off Harry and onto his back, tugging Harry on top. Harry might not understand why, but he does know it feels different. Not because there's another cock. Harry doesn't know.
the one in charge of DMLE—because I try to mitigate the negative effects of his policies. So the question is, when does the political advantage of my getting sacked in a blaze of glory outweigh the advantages of having me in the role?"
lose his self control just because he had the hots for Harry Potter. Draco was no longer a horny teenager. He would not be party to Harry Potter's continued martyrdom.
The foot tapped. Harry noticed that Draco's shoes were nice—shiny, but not pretentious. There seemed to be adequate toe space—one of Harry's main fashion pet peeves was shoes without adequate toe space. Even an Undetectable Extension wasn't ideal for foot health.
Somehow, Harry is, though. He doesn't envy any of it. "You know the saying: wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."
"Yes. He thinks that with my notoriety and their organisation, we could make quite a splash in the news. What do you think?"
"I regret it," Draco choked out. At Harry's hurt expression, he hastened to add, "Not being with you. Doing it all wrong. It should've been different."
Harry tossed his arm over Draco's shoulders and tugged him tight. "When I was a teenager and first had an inkling that I might not be…particularly hetero, there were almost no role models for me to turn to. I only found out later that Dumbledore had been gay, in secret, all that time. What shit is that for a queer kid? The only person who might be able to point you in the right direction, keeping it a secret from you rather than wearing it proudly? I only found out later, from Rita Skeeter, of all people. What message was I supposed to take from that? That being queer sentenced people to lives of loneliness and bachelorhood?"
“No idea,” Harry said. This was fucking awkward. He didn’t want to sit here for hours in the dungeon with Malfoy wondering whether the potion was working. “Want to go outside?” he asked. “It’s probably nice out.”
The ice cream tasted worse after that reminder of the outside world. A reminder that, when it came down to it, they were still just putting on a show.
Draco closed his eyes, terrified of getting his hopes up. "We haven't…we've avoided all the real issues that would come up in a relationship, before now. We've been on company behaviour with each other. We can't…that's not real. It will be harder from here out than it's been."
Draco took a deep breath. "I am no longer comfortable with our arrangement. I can't—we can't—it's not fair to you."
After they'd been there two hours, the mediwitch informed them that the mother was six and a half centimetres dilated.
"Mi, can I ask you a question? How are you feeling about your parents? Do you want to talk about it?"
"That is fucked up!" Harry interrupted, his voice laced with shock. "What the fuck is wrong with rich people!?"
"Yes, and I'm just telling you it isn't funny." Draco sat up and changed the subject. "So I suppose you need to follow this gag order. For now, anyway, since it seems too early to get yourself fired. It's better for everyone if you're in the DMLE to keep things from going to shit. Who knows what horrifying policies Rump will enact."
Harry thinks he hears something, but it doesn't continue and he decides he's hearing things. A moment later, louder, he hears, "
"Sure," Draco says, scanning the shelf of chocolates. "Now Potter, your first lesson in mousse making: anything less than 60% cacao will not do."
"Let's just like, do the best we can, and then arrange them like they're sleeping. Facing away. Hope no one gets a close look."
"Kombucha is a fermented tea beverage that is effervescent and high in probiotics. Chia seeds make things a touch gelatinous and are high in omega-3s."
I'm not sure how often I'll be able to update! I'll try to keep it fairly regular, as that will be good for me during this lockdown. I'm sure your comments will inspire continued writing, too. <3
Draco blinked. The visible sadness had gone. Harry wished he could understand the look on Draco's face, but Draco was too good at keeping it in. Draco could Occlude; hiding emotions was child's play for him. What Harry wanted was for Draco to stop
“Well yeah,” Harry said. He wouldn’t want Malfoy not to be a git, obviously. Wait, why was that obvious? “But like, if someone had taught you some more tolerant ideas as a kid. We could’ve been friends if you hadn’t insulted Ron that first day of school. Or Hagrid.”
Harry blinked, the concerned-parent mantle settling effortlessly onto his shoulders. "Did you have it inspected? Did you bring anyone else to see it? Are you sure they didn't rip you off? How did you have enough money?"
Then with no warning, Harry removed his hands, throwing his arms up over his head, and pulled out of the kiss, leaving Draco's lips chasing his. "So you'll get the ban of magically binding entails into the party platform, then?"
Harry looked up at the lighting fixture. "It just feels real now, you know? If the kids know, it's real."
Albus Severus Potter has been known to rant about the inclusion of marriages and bonds under the purview of a department overseeing "propagation of the magical race" (the language used in the department's original charter, since updated to "reflect the times"). He often points out that the institution of marriage is, quite explicitly, about state control of the family unit and the (capitalist, bureaucratic) state interest in achieving replacement fertility. Scorpius Malfoy at this point usually adds that the history is unambiguously one in which heterosexual family structures were used to prop up the state as an institution at a time when magical governmental capacity was tenuous at best. (He then segues into a tangent about the difficulty of state control of a group of people as unpredictable and powerful as the magical populace.) Albus customarily agrees, concluding that the continued existence of B.A.I.R.N.s as a Ministry department proves that Magical Britain is committed to upholding and exploiting the heteronormative family structure as an organising principle of society, and that the only ethical and justice-promoting action is to embrace queer ways of living that challenge and decentralise the power inherent in the institution of marriage, the medicomagical treatment of reproduction, and the necessary failure of the capitalist state to support the dignity of life across the full spectrum of human flourishing.
Teddy looked up, grinning. "Draco was worrying about this for no reason—it doesn't seem at all transphobic to me. I mean, it's not like I'm some kind of arbiter for the entire trans and non-binary community, but this makes perfect sense."
Having adult children was a trip—they were self-sufficient, but they somehow retained their need to complain to him about everything. Like nothing bad could possibly have happened to them unless they related it to one or both of their parents. Harry found it charming. He wished he had someone who would always listen to his whinging.
Harry tries to focus on Malfoy's face. The rest of the room feels a little blurry, but he can focus on the face. "Your hair is longer."
Lily sighed, then quickly moved on to discuss a new charm she was developing—it was meant to Vanish pollutants from waterways, though she was struggling to get the charm to target contaminated sediment as well as contaminants in the water.
Harry found that seeing Malfoy made him feel two things: a desire to make Malfoy as annoyed to see him as he was to see Malfoy, and a desire to act like a fourteen-year-old idiot. Unfortunately for Malfoy, these two feelings went together, so Harry reached into his Enlarged Auror pocket, rummaged around past the Shrunken file of paperwork, a Chocolate Frog, and a cursed set of teeth he had forgotten to turn in to Misuse, until he found the box of Tic Tacs. He poured a few of the orange candies into his left hand, selected one with his right, ate those remaining in his left hand, and threw the single Tic Tac at Malfoy's head.
it was me." He catches my eye, though, and I know we both know it's at least true insofar as I, too, risked death.
Harry's brow furrowed. "It's not that deep. We're having coffee? I can't keep seeing you without feeling curious about how you are. We have too much history to ignore each other—I don't want to ignore you. So we can have coffee?"
we haven't been honest. Because the entire 'relationship' isn't honest." He made quotes in the air with his fingers, trying to emphasise the extent of the farce.
“Welcome! This workshop is not going to be for discussing personal issues—it’s not like group therapy. It’s for learning specific techniques to help deal with depression. We’ll continue discussing personal issues and dealing with your trauma in your individual sessions. But the first thing I want to establish here is trust.”
"Wait, what do you mean 'at a Ministry function'?" James asked loudly, almost bouncing in his seat. "You're not saying you hooked up at the
"Are you going to tell me what you want? Or shall I tell jokes? A hag, a witch, and a goblin walk into a bar."
No one could argue with that. The Wizengamot was notoriously glacial (unless they were launching a full inquiry against a fifteen-year-old, but Harry tried not to harp on that too much lest he be accused of holding a grudge).
He adjusted the scarf around his neck and walked home, trying to clear his head, ignoring the world around him. He walked up the steps, Vanishing a cigarette butt from the pavement in front of the house. He didn't allow himself to stop for breath or to prepare himself. Draco was a lot of things, but he was not in denial. He knew exactly how tenuous his morality was. Better to power through without allowing himself time to think—better to act like a Gryffindor and do what he'd decided he had to do, before his inner coward could win.
Harry refused to get into specifics about the war, but he couldn't stop seeing the image of a young, scared Draco refusing to identify him at the Manor. Of Draco unable to kill Dumbledore. He may have been an arsehole, but he did more than anyone who hid in their homes. He understood in a way others didn't—that wasn't a lie.
Harry squeezed it. "Sexually," he confirmed, trying not to form a mental image of it. It was the first time in his life he'd ever lied about having had sex with someone. All those times during adolescence when the other boys were claiming all sorts of apocryphal conquests, Harry never joined in. He couldn't believe he was breaking his streak now, at age fifty-five.
“Fuck politics!” Malfoy laughed. They’d reached the lake, and Malfoy sat by a little copse of trees, wrapping his arms across his chest against the chill in the air. “Maybe that was your problem when thinking about careers—you were thinking inside the box. You were thinking all possible career options were captured by the pamphlets Hogwarts hands out. You needed some imagination to realise your life goals are actually about wheeled wood planks.”
Harry's face flushes with heat. Fuck. He'd been doing a fairly good job of forgetting for the past couple days, and now. "Erm. Yes, of course. Invite her. Ginny is family."
Everyone sort of slowly turned to look at her, tilting their heads to accommodate her upside-downness.
Draco nodded, face unreadable. “On the contrary. It’s exactly what I signed up for.” He walked upstairs.
"I'm outraged that they won't tell us the names they're considering," Draco said, spinning on the ball of his expensive shoe and beginning another lap of the tiny office. "I have so many ideas, and to be honest, I don't trust a Potter with this decision. I love your children, but their names are
"Of course I haven't!" Harry shouted, exasperated. "Of course I hate it! But this is my life, Draco. I do things because I have to. Welcome to my world."
My father will lower the wards, and Potter will be gone before my father knows he was there. I won't be to blame for keeping him here. I won't.
being with you! What changed from last night? Last night you had your dick in my mouth, now this—like, what the actual fuck!"
"What makes you think I'm not angry at you already? I mean, still? I'll always be angry at you for that, you know, Harry. I may forgive you." She's acting like she's teasing, but they both know she's telling the truth. She leans forward to scrutinise him. "Merlin, you're terrified. What? What is it?"
Draco, wearing a slim grey Muggle suit, was sat at a small table by the front window. His face was appropriately sad, a funeral face. Harry didn't know how authentically upset Draco was about Penelope's loss, or if it was an act—part of the whole political ploy. Sure, Draco didn't want Rump in charge, but he hadn't been a vocal supporter of Penelope's at first. He'd come around and worked on her campaign, but Harry knew Draco had been frustrated with how she did things. Draco's greying blond hair fell elegantly across his forehead, and Harry self-consciously rumpled his own as he dropped into the opposite seat.
I stare for a long moment. "Potter. Are you suggesting we Transfigure Wormtail's corpse to look like one of us?"
"You know I did all that research and was the one to write Penelope's campaign platform on profiling."
"I'm seeing someone. It started after we split. But, for the past couple months, really." He takes a deep breath. "And I'm bisexual, I think. I mean, I like blokes. I can say that definitively."
They didn't answer, and it was dark, and Harry kept talking. "He thought I cancelled because I couldn't stomach hanging out with him unless I was high on imagination potion."
When he glanced into the room, Malfoy was there, standing in front of a desk across from Penelope and Professor Slughorn.
"It's still matrimonial magic tying us together," Draco said, shaking his head. "What if it is changing our feelings? What if we don't understand entirely how it works? I can't—I can't be with you like this. It makes me feel like a piece of shit."
"Be quiet—you're with him. You're my best friend. Ergo, I have to be friendly with him." She wrinkles her nose. "I don't know how to go about that. How did you end up friends with him?"
"It was nice to forget about it for a few minutes," Draco says. "But Weasley's right—we were forgetting. I don't think Granger has had a chance to really forgive me. Not yet."
Harry groaned. And he'd never stop being annoyed about it, no matter how many years had passed. In some ways his fame had only increased over time, as the papers reported all the details of his life, they solidified his place as a public figure. These days, he was just famous. He suspected most people under twenty didn't know
"That's enough of that," Draco said. "We don't need to awkwardly apologise at each other. Quite out of character."
Draco's still on the floor, propped up on his elbows, hair a mess, chocolate on his shirt, and his face slowly turns red. "Granger." He scrambles to his feet. "Ah. Hullo."
Harry raised Draco's shoe without thinking. "Posh keto junk food is still junk food." Laughter rang in Harry's ears.
It was Monday morning, 8:45am. Thinking he'd apologise to Robards later, Harry took off for Gringotts.
"He sends those all the time? For everything?" Draco asked, gaping. "To join the office raffle? To order a sarnie?"
"They'll probably have someone casting to Bind us the moment they remove the magic," Potter says. "Especially after what we did before, er—" He gestures at Wormtail.
"You just don't want them to know how prudish you are, refusing to snog in the Ministry loo. We're young. Vital!"
"Potter—" Malfoy starts, looking hungrily at Harry's lips, and Harry decides he doesn't want to hear what Malfoy's going to say. He lunges forward, grabbing Malfoy's bony shoulders and pressing their lips together. He pulls back almost immediately, wanting to look at Malfoy's face, to see his reaction—but Malfoy, bringing their lips together again, doesn't give him a chance. They're properly snogging now, on the dance floor, and the girl in the Ramones t-shirt seems to be cheering them on, but Harry can barely register anything except the heat of Malfoy's mouth, the way the prat's pointy fucking fingers are digging into his hips, a maddening slide of posh tongue.
Harry rolled his eyes. Draco was rubbing it on a little thick. "Yes, husband, hello. What can I do for you that couldn't wait until I get home later?"
"Quite right. And Teddy and Hermione want you too, Merlin knows why. They must have an inexplicable affinity for wild mops of hair. And who knows how this bizarre little family of yours will expand over the years. Hermione's Aunt Peggy, for one. She'll be cooking you hot-pot and you'll be cat sitting for her before you know it. And Andromeda, of course. We'll have to reconcile her with my mother. Oh, and my mother. Goodness, Potter, just wait until my mother decides you fall under the category of 'family.' You'll be trying to dodge her owls before you know it."
Draco put his free hand on the back of Aster's head and pulled her cheek to his chest, rocking back and forth. He looked at Harry. "The thing is, love potions and objects are overwhelmingly used against women and non-cis men. So it
Harry deflates as the world comes crashing back in. He slumps onto the arm of the sofa. "Ron—" Harry starts, his voice tired, but Hermione interrupts.
Harry's knife stilled. "It was like, the Inquisition Gang. No. Inquisition Troop? I can't fucking remember."
"Wren switched our coffees," Harry said bluntly, thrusting the cup out towards Malfoy. "Well, she switched our
, Draco! Do you know how much I hate doing that? How much I had to research and do all this work that plays to all my weaknesses? But I did it anyway so that these guidelines would become part of the institution. So that the department would continue to work, no matter who was at the helm."
"You're going to eat cake with the sugar spelled out? What will even be left? Just a pile of cocoa powder?"
Albus glanced at Scorpius, then back at Harry. "Er. We understand? And want you both to be happy? And it's kind of weird but these things happen—people fall in love with the people they're around, so, you know, these things happen. You're not the first person to fall in love with your kid's partner's parent."
Malfoy ran a hand through his hair. “I suppose I would. But that’s not really what I meant when I said we haven’t imagined anything about the present. Though of course I’m flattered if the best way you can think to use this once-in-a-lifetime imagination is to think of my looks.”
"Has it been that long?" Harry asked in horror, momentarily forgetting this was an interview and they'd planned out responses as best they could.
drunk," Teddy replied. "Just not as shitfaced as you two. And don't blame me. That was all your children's doing. I'm going to cast some charms to hydrate and so you won't puke, okay?"
"Why is that werewolf wearing fur robes?" Draco asks, panting, as he touches the floor, sticking one leg out to the side.
Now Malfoy's brow wrinkled with confusion. “Of course. Willy Wonka was one of the first wizarding films, Potter, keep up. How did
Draco smirked. "I didn't have to. All I had to do was mention that I was expecting you and they put me here. No one will ever get tired of flaunting the Saviour's patronage."
wearing a pair of red boxer briefs, and he refused to let Draco shame him. "I've been trying to find my jeans for the better part of an hour. But apparently none of my children or employees can do anything without help from me and I keep getting interrupted." He shot what he hoped was a meaningful glance at Draco, who was, he hoped Draco realised,
Harry snorted, then paused, thinking. "None of those personal things are separate from the issues, though. Talking about Albus and Scorpius trying to adopt a baby would automatically be taking a position on queer rights and adoption. Talking about my dashing new lover, who happens to consult for the LabMags, would automatically draw attention to my politics."
Hermione hugged the folders tight to her chest and looked up at him. Her beard was...fluffy. Black, curly.
Harry snorted, wanting to make fun of Blue-Lens to Malfoy. Fuck, he needed to get out of here if he felt like bonding with Malfoy of all people.
It's strange doing magic without a wand, but Potter manages to Stun the rat, and I manage to Levitate the corpse closer to the chain.
"Love Story? Beaches? Romeo and Juliet, the Leo and Claire Danes version?" She pauses. "Wait, so, I haven't even asked, because it's obviously not important. Do you consider yourself bisexual now? Because
“Draco.” When their eyes met, Harry continued, “Come with me. We can go celebrate while we’re changing our clothes.”
It was pleasant enough by the lake, birds chirping, the distant distinctive sound of hippogriff squawks, and the odd bray of a thestral providing a backdrop of sound that mixed with the scratching of Malfoy’s quill. Harry’s Conjured quill broke, as expected, and after his third Conjured quill, Malfoy sighed and pulled a spare quill from his robe. Harry nodded his thanks and imagined how strange it was to be writing with a quill that Malfoy had used before—maybe he’d used it to write personal thoughts in a diary. Maybe he’d used it during the war.
Malfoy's fingers tighten, and Harry's head drops in pleasure to his shoulder. Maybe it's that there're no expectations. He doesn't expect anything from Malfoy, and Malfoy doesn't expect anything from him. There's no pressure to become a perfect family, to be good role models for the entire wizarding world. There's only orgasms. Or at least, presumably there will be orgasms. Not yet. Not right this minute, please.
“Well, you’re welcome to stay here as long as you need,” Draco offered. “There are a few bedrooms on the fifth floor you can choose from.”
Lorraine appeared a few feet in front of him. "Master Draco is eating breakfast in the garden. Would Master Harry care to join?"
like unwanted guests into one's home, knocking things over unrepentantly, opening cabinets and stealing. Potter, in contrast, walks in politely, waiting for me to wave him inside. I try not to be charmed.
“That’s true,” Malfoy responded. “Better to stick with each other, because at least we understand why we can’t stop talking and coming up with crazy ideas about skateboards.”
Bed. Harry's stuff was still in Draco's room. They'd been sleeping in the same bed, talking to each other before they fell off to sleep, sharing each other's warmth from an arm's width away, listening to each other's morning expletives for weeks. Harry hadn't been so well rested since—well, maybe ever, thanks to Draco's Circadios.
"We're young," Draco said in that way he had. "Nowhere near as old as our parents were when our kids were born."
Nico was full deer-in-Lumos now, exactly as Draco had hoped. Draco stood, patted Nico on the shoulder, and returned to the kitchen.
Harry wearily got up off of his bed, heart heavy as a stone in his chest as he made his way back down to the common room.
“You better have a good reason for interrupting my studying, Potter,” Draco said, leaning back against a bookshelf. Not that he was actually getting any done. But in a round about way, that was Potter’s fault too, being such an annoyingly good kisser. Draco angrily shoved the thought back, focusing on Potter, who was pacing in a short length across the floor.
“Standing in one place usually doesn’t involve fending off morons who don’t know how gravity works,” he shot back, rolling his eyes.
The direct sentiment caused both of their cheeks to automatically redden with embarrassment, but Pansy smiled and abruptly hugged Draco, the embrace terribly awkward, but well-meant. Draco leaned into his friend’s shoulder, breathing in her familiar floral perfume. A scent that would always be comforting for him, reminding him of his oldest and closest friend.
“No,” Harry said through gritted teeth. “You just shouldn’t ask questions you know I’m not going to answer.”
“Yeah,” he said slowly, shaking off the odd sensation. “It’s a Muggle card game. With tokens and betting and stuff.”
“You have to open it, or it will only get worse,” Malfoy prompted him, sitting back down at the table.
“I saw a notice for a gingerbread house competition in Painswick and thought I’d check it out,” Harry said, gulping down the hot coffee as quickly as he could. The contest would be starting soon.
“Thanks, Harry,” Ron said, turning towards him with a wide smile, only to freeze, staring at Harry’s chest with a confused look on his face.
“This way, Potter,” Malfoy directed, heading down the road to the right of the house. Harry had only ever gone left to the village and was curious to see where Malfoy was leading him.
Harry swallowed, trying to smile convincingly. He didn’t want to get into this. “Just a scar. It’s nothing.”
Draco did his best to keep himself fully focused on his plate for the remainder of breakfast, engaging in a mundane conversation about Charms classwork with Crabbe and Goyle, who were both characteristically stumped by the concept assigned to them.
As promised, Draco had not moved from the couch and was staring distantly into the roaring flames in the hearth, the light glimmering in the reflection of his eyes.
He sucked in a fortifying breath and pushed the doors open. A storm of noise whirled around them, made up of the clinking of cutlery and the complaintive chattering of study-weary students ready for the upcoming weekend break.
“Are you trying to get us caught, Potter?” Malfoy huffed, stooping in front of a door with chipped purple paint and drawing out his wand, muttering a soft ‘alohomora’. He gently twisted the handle and the door swung open, letting a wave of warmth out into the blustering alleyway.
Now he stood watching as the children finished their song, which had been spirited if not particularly in tune, and burst into applause. To his great surprise, Malfoy joined him, clapping and smiling at the bowing kids.
As the Slytherins’ footsteps clattered around the corner, Potter looked up quickly, eyes flashing as he took in Draco and his friends.
“Definitely.” She leaned in to hug him, whispering in his ear, “And do be careful with Draco. He’s doing really well now, but he’s still fragile.” She looked at him meaningfully as she pulled back.
Unsure if it was meant to be a jab or an honest compliment, Harry simply nodding, sinking into his own chair and keeping his eyes fixed on the table in front of him, noting the swirls and scuffs in the wood.
“Well, I was planning to do my shopping in Diagon Alley,” Harry responded tersely, folding his arms defensively across his chest. “But then people started recognizing me and following me everywhere, so I had to leave.”
“Because,” Harry lowered his voice as a lower year Gryffindor passed them. “Since we’re supposed to be dating, it’ll look odd if we don’t spend our free time together.”
“Up for another chess tournament?” Ron asked eagerly between mouthfuls of porridge, some oats sticking to the side of his mouth due to his still unfortunate lack of coordination using his left hand.
“Fine by me!” Harry shouted back over his shoulder, before dashing out into the hall, where he promptly smacked into Ron and Hermione. It appeared they had finally decided to make their way out of the Charms classroom. Hermione still was absorbed in her book and Ron was still staring at her with a combination of awe and nervousness.
“What?” Harry looked over at Malfoy, sure the crowd’s dull buzz had distorted the Slytherin’s words.
Feeling a bit unsteady, Harry tightened his hold around Malfoy’s waist, reaching his right hand up and fisting it in his shirt, knowing that the action would rumple it irreparably and Malfoy would feel compelled to cast an ironing charm on it before he dared appear in public again. Malfoy’s strict grooming standards never failed to make Harry unreasonably cheerful, although why, he did not know.
“Of course, Mr. Potter. What about a nice blue?” She conjured up a swatch that was almost navy in colour.
“Thank you, Potter. It’s perfect,” Malfoy said quietly, glancing over at him with what could almost be mistaken for a smile. “I have something for you too.”
“Fine,” Harry relented, staring at Malfoy’s chin so he didn’t have to look in his eyes as he quickly mumbled, “IputupthemistletoebecauseIdidn’tknowifitwasjusttheshockofthefirstkissthatmademethinkIlikedyou.”
“Okay, listen up men!” George said, pacing back and forth in front of them like a general about to direct his troops into battle.
“So the mistletoe was what, just an insurance policy?” He grinned dangerously and Harry knew he was not escaping this time.
Slowly, the reporters slunk away from their table, peering at them from the bar, as the rest of the on-lookers gradually went back to their food, cringing fearfully away from Malfoy, who sat back down, sending them all a final scowl that seemed to promise death if anyone so much as breathed in the wrong direction.
Ron swore as his halted a few feet before Draco’s, passing over the coins. “Lucky first shot, Malfoy.”
Grabbing onto his shoulders, Malfoy rolled him over, intent on regaining the upper hand, only to smack himself against the trunk of a nearby pine tree.
At least that’s what Draco tried to tell himself. And while Potter’s lateness was partially responsible for his lack of concentration, it unfortunately had more to do with that damn kiss. It was not the first time the competitiveness of his ambition had gotten him into trouble, but it certainly had resulted in the worse consequences. Laborious detentions were nothing compared to having thoughts of Potter’s annoyingly soft lips constantly looping through his head. During class, at meals, and while studying. He could barely say a word to Potter without his attention getting snagged on his mouth instead of the casual responses coming out of it.
Now it was Harry’s turn to be confused. “Sorry, why am I supposed to be stopping the fire from burning? Isn’t that the point of having a fire?”
“What took you so long?” Malfoy complained, falling into step with Harry as Ron and Hermione walked out into the crisp late November air, now shyly holding hands.
Harry sighed. “You know I always think you look attractive; I just think that maybe you should go see Madam Pomfrey.”
At first, Harry couldn’t tell what Ron was frowning at. His shirt was clean, his robes relatively free of the short hairs constantly being shed by Crookshanks, and his tie was knotted properly, if a bit loosely, and the skinnier end wasn’t longer the fat one. Actually, now that Harry was looking at it, he hadn’t tied his tie so nicely in awhile. It was verging on perfect . . . except for the fact that its stripes were not gold and crimson, but silver and green. Shit. He must have grabbed Draco’s tie after their altercation outside the Great Hall.
“So, I’ll see you in Charms,” Harry prompted, smiling up at Draco in a way that still made him wonder if someone else was standing behind him as the real recipient of Harry’s smile.
The rest of the day and the weeks to come seemed toned in bleak black and white to Harry. He felt empty without Draco beside him, only catching brief glances of him from afar, walking to class with his head down and his books clasped tightly to his chest, as if to serve as some sort of armor.
“I don’t want to drown!” The person said, spluttering and shrill with fright, but slowly they relaxed enough that Harry was able to grab onto their arms and haul them up onto his broom. Robes dripping, the person clung onto Harry, getting his own robes drenched with lake water. Sighing, Harry resigned himself to his fate, prying himself away from the person’s tightening arms and seeing their face for the first time.
“Why don’t you come with me?” Harry suggested, fumbling for a reason for this odd request that had just popped out of him. “Um, well, I, er, oh! I could, I could use a, a guide to direct me to the different shops. Yes.”
“Hey, Potter, where are you going?” Malfoy called, pausing to transfigure his skates back into boots as Harry pushed up off the ground and took off running through the trees.
“You pick which one you want,” Malfoy said, gesturing to the expanse of evergreen trees tucked between the skeletal branches of leafless oaks and maples.
Ron started to laugh, his leg slung over Hermione’s lap and his face reddening as he tried to suppress his chuckles.
After a long stretch of silence filled only with the sound of their breaths, Harry whispered, "Will they be okay? Will they forgive us?"
"Here, take this," Harry says, grabbing a Charms journal he'd been consulting for homework and shoving it into Draco's hands. "In case anyone believed my oh-so-subtle tactic earlier."
"Do you enjoy looking at every issue from both sides, no matter your personal opinions about those issues?"
Granted, marrying Draco would be a bit more pleasant than dying by Voldemort's hand. At least, he was 99 percent sure it would be.
She walks over and surprises him by wrapping him in a hug. "Nope. Just promise me that if you get overwhelmed by the party, you'll go outside or something. I know it can be a lot, with people trying to talk to you about the war. Want me to charm your shirt to say
“About eight years.” Draco, to Harry’s surprise, dropped onto his bottom in the middle of the bedroom, arranged himself cross-legged, and began a series of stretches. “You?”
Harry, inexplicably, felt hurt by that. “I mean, if you want to, though I imagine that Penelope wanted us to stay together. Also I suppose all our other friends will think we’ve gone round the twist if we talk to them like this.”
I have no idea what a game show is, but I agree with his sentiment. I sigh. "Look, you're not allowed to mock me. I don't think this will work, but I feel like I need to try."
“I am well aware that the Ministry, and society as a whole, are scared of queer people with non-normative gender presentation,” Draco intoned. “Merlin knows my parents did everything they could to brainwash me on that front during my repressed childhood. But it is a con! A
A surprised laugh escaped Harry's mouth. "True. Well, for what it's worth, I like talking with you, whether we're on imagination potions or not. It's easier than with most people."
As soon as I think it, I'm flooded with a memory—the memory of accepting the Dark Mark. Fuck. That memory will not let go of me. It's as if every ounce of shame I've ever experienced has coalesced into that one memory. I inhale, trying to get through it, but the memory fades more quickly than it ever does. In its place, oddly, floats a more recent memory: I'm in the drawing room, looking at Harry Potter's swollen, yet still recognisable, face. I can feel my earlier uncertainty, my nausea. I feel myself torn between impossible choices, but at the forefront all I can think is
Harry and Draco both dropped from their forearms to the floor, attempting to get up to let James in.
"I'm not sure. I'll make a note to ask our Labour Secretary. We can see about supporting the work even if we're not a member nation."
Draco's hands started to shake, and Harry squeezed. Aster's fingers clenched at his forearm. He sucked in a breath. "And I thought of Harry. I told myself—I told myself, what's the big deal? We're already family. We're both single. Would I get a new roommate to get rid of Rump? Of course I would! Who wouldn't!? And so I explained all this to Harry. And he agreed, because—well, I don't want to put words in his mouth."
When they landed on the beach, Teddy let go of Harry's hand and ran towards the house screaming "Vic! Dodo! Viiiiiiiiic!"
Harry looks into the bag, pulls out a little modern clock and Levitates it to Draco's mantel. "I got you this because you're always needing to cast
Harry nods, hating talking about it but ploughing ahead anyway. "I want to. I don't particularly want to like, define anything. Do we have to? It seems—premature." What he doesn't say is he doesn't think he can manage that discussion. He doesn't want to talk about if they're a couple. If they're
Harry tugged their clasped hands. "And that isn't a bad thing! Not all bad, anyway. And I'm not so self-sacrificing that I would've agreed to marry you if I hated you. I didn't! I knew it'd be okay. I'm an adult and I made a decision. And I don't regret it."
Draco snorted inelegantly, rubbing his eyes. "Yes. I imagine that won't get any better once the baby comes."
Malfoy wrenches away from Harry's lips, and Harry chases it, not wanting to hear some bullshit excuse about why they should stop. The war is over
for flying." He turned, looking around the room for a moment, and then spun back towards them. "I am so fucking excited! This is like, so
). Really, it's Harry's fault, isn’t it? If anyone's to blame here. But how can he feel responsible when he wasn't even there with her? He—
"Yes," Potter says. "We have a fantastic arsenal here. A button, a mint, a watch, a candy that makes you puke, and dittany. Can you brew us a potion?"
Malfoy reaches into his pocket and withdraws his handful of tokens. He taps the bloke in front of them, the one with the spikier frosted tips, and says, "Excuse me."
Harry raised his shoe, thinking that a clear mark in his column, but Scorpius hollered, "Oh come on, Dad, it
"I want him dead," I say, and it's the first time I'm allowing myself to articulate this thought, but I know it's true. "I want you to win." It doesn't feel like some big reveal; it just feels like the simple truth.
She gives him a commiserating grimace. "Can I do anything to help? Shall I try to find you the Resurrection Stone for you to carry with you, or….?"
We kneel in front of the wall that has the magical anomaly, and Potter looks at me with big, inquiring green eyes.
Thirty minutes passed in which Harry and Malfoy, both depressed, both teenagers, reluctantly yet resolutely argued every point Penelope tried to add to the “evidence that does not support the thought” column on her parchment. In the end, they agreed on, “There are people in the world who allegedly enjoy their jobs,” but they’d run out of time, and Penelope sent them off with an assignment to write down their negative thoughts and the situations that triggered them and to think about alternative ways to respond.
Draco let out a noise like a cross between a frustrated groan, a lusty moan, and an amused laugh. "You have to stop with the bad innuendo. It's embarrassing."
Harry rolled onto his stomach, burying his face half into the pillow and half into Draco's arm. "That was one of the worst things that has ever happened to me."
"I forgot the part where you're a really good kisser," Harry whispered, and Draco dramatically covered Aster's ear with his free hand. Harry laughed. "And fit, too."
"No, I don't mean—I mean, we should tell her that we're secretly dating and that you are going to run for office and we're wondering the best PR strategy for breaking it to the public. So we tell her everything except that we're not really, you know, together."
“No,” Harry replied. “I don’t want a career where people are going to die on me. I’ve had enough of that.”
Harry gasps for air—Draco grabs his shoulders. "Focus on me, Harry. Look at my face that you hate so much."
Draco reached out blindly with the hand next to Harry, grasping until he found Harry's hand, and threaded their fingers together. He squeezed, and once Harry's fingers were clasped firmly between his, he leaned forward and glared at the assembled family. "
"I heard that," Hermione says, running her finger down the page. "Alright, it's after five o'clock on Samhain, the veil is thin, we conjure the flames according to these instructions, we send the letter to the Beyond."
“Additionally,” Pomfrey says, and how can there be more? “Orgasms stimulate the vagus nerve, which is also useful in calming intractable hiccoughs. My professional recommendation, therefore, is for digital rectal massage culminating in orgasm.”
