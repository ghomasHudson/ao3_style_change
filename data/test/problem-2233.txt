“Why do you think you’re not good for him? You’re still the same person Harry,” Remus gives him a stern look, already knowing Harry'll object to what he’s saying, “You are the same person and I know you would never hurt him. How many times have I told you that you can’t let what happened define you. Don’t make my mistakes. If he’s what you want, if he’s who you love, then don’t give up.”
“You mean how she chose her own happiness over the bigoted beliefs of her family?” Draco said, cutting her off, “That’s bullshit. Did the war teach you nothing?”
Potter’s eyes narrow and his lips press into a flat line.
Honestly, Harry’s presence is overwhelming, his familiar magic buzzing against Draco’s skin. It’s amazing that nearly a decade after defeating Voldemort, Harry’s magic still seems to seep from his pores, leaving no doubt to anyone in close proximity that he’s one of the most powerful wizards of their time.
,” Harry says in a rush, before he surges forward, grabbing Draco by the back of the head and crashing their lips together. If the moan that escapes him is any indication, Draco thinks Harry quite likes the taste of himself in Draco’s mouth.
Finally, Draco feels confident he won’t leave any body parts behind and twists them away from the alley, Harry’s bedroom pictured firmly in his mind.
Harry’s warm, spooned behind him. One of his arms is wound possessively around Draco’s waist and the other is above their heads, resting lightly in Draco’s hair. He’s snoring softly, warm puffs of breath tickling the back of Draco’s neck.
“You. I just want you.”
When they finally pull back, the smile that stretches Draco’s kiss-reddened lips nearly brings him to his knees.
Falling back on his impeccable manners, he stiffly says, “It’s a pleasure to see you, Ginevra.”
The kettle is just starting to whistle as they take seats at a long table. It’s old and scuffed in places, obviously the only thing in the room that hasn’t been replaced.
The humid air hits him in the face when he steps outside and he’s completely unprepared to be grabbed by Harry and pushed against the wall of the pub. All the oxygen is punched from his lungs and his pulse starts thudding loudly in his ears. He vaguely registers his shirt catching on the brick, probably snagging, but Draco doesn’t even care. Not with Harry standing up on his tip toes to kiss at his neck.
“Sit up on the table.”
As he steps through the single door that leads to the area of the prison where the inmates are housed, Draco feels wards shimmer over his skin. They’re similar to those in Gringotts and will strip the influence of any potion or charms. Another new measure implemented under Shaklebolt.
With the Muggles attention diverted, he moves quickly over to the owl and unties the note from its outstretched leg. Without waiting for a treat, or a reply, the owl flaps its wings and takes off into the darkening sky.
“I’m fine,” Harry says, snapping Draco from his thoughts, “Have a seat.”
Kade has a firm handshake and an easy going smile. Harry’s loath to admit that he’s also very fit.
As the clock on the wall loudly ticks the minutes away, Harry tries to settle his nerves. He’s half afraid he’s just going to word vomit all the feelings he’s been holding back right onto Draco as soon as he sees him.
Malfoy takes a drink of his coffee, stalling, before he finally nods, “Alright. That sounds good.”
“Open your mouth.” Draco does and Potter slides a bite of rich chocolate cake inside. It’s delicious, and Draco moans at the taste, “Good?”
“No, I. I don’t know what you mean, there’s nothing bothering me.” He knows that Harry talks to Andromeda, so she probably has a very good idea of what happened between them. But Draco doesn’t want to talk about it. He came here for an escape.
Draco expects more prep, Potter is nothing if not thorough, but he simply rubs a hand across his mouth and pulls Draco forward and into his lap.
Harry kisses his way across Draco’s chest, letting his tongue caress each scar. He sucks purple bruises into the pale skin; one at the base of Draco’s throat, one just below his right nipple, one over his rib cage.
“Don’t you dare try to lie to me, Draco Malfoy. You disappeared. No goodbye, no explanation, nothing. It was months before we found out where you were. Do you have any idea what that did to Harry?”
He just wants to get this over with. He glances once more at his reflection, grateful it isn’t a magical mirror and therefore is quiet, before letting out a deep breath and squaring his shoulders.
“He’s not so bad these days,” Harry replies, not meeting Ron’s eyes. Harry remembers telling his friend the same thing back in eighth year.
Malfoy’s eyes go comically wide as he shakes his head.
Malfoy seems a little surprised by the invitation, which is ridiculous. They’ve had dinner together a number of times by now, hell they see each other nearly everyday. It isn’t that strange of Harry to offer.
Harry stares. “You would come with me?”
Harry stands from the table, pulling Draco with him and Apparates them straight to his bedroom. He realizes his mistake when Draco meets his eyes with confusion and sadness in his own.
A few hours later, a knock sounds at the front door and Harry waves Kreacher off, going to open the door himself.
“Alright then,” Malfoy says with a clipped nod.
The tension in the room is heavy and Harry has no idea what to say. He doesn’t want the night to be ruined but really, all things considered, that could have gone much worse than it did.
His feelings towards Malfoy are still jumbled up, a mess of confusion, contradicting everything Harry thought he knew about the other man. Yeah, he can admit now that he possibly finds Malfoy attractive. But what he’s supposed to do with that, Harry doesn’t know. He finds a lot of people attractive, both men and women, and Harry is finally starting to accept that about himself.
Fuck it, Draco thinks as he walks over to his bag and pulls out the Muggle phone Kade insisted he bring with him. He taps at the screen and after three tries he’s able to find Kade’s contact information.
They continue like that, Potter feeding him small bites as he kneels on the floor. His knees are starting to protest when Potter finally lays the fork down. He scoots his chair back a bit and tells Draco to stand up.
And it’s as if Potter was waiting for those words. Something—a hint of dark desire, sparks bright in those stupidly green eyes, and then his mouth is on Draco’s.
Draco stands alone in the kitchen struggling to control his breathing. He’s seen Harry angry plenty of times, been on the receiving end of it more often than not, but this was different. A shiver runs down Draco’s spine as he thinks about what might have happened had he referred to Kade as his fiancé instead of his boyfriend.
How didn’t he know that his son was friends with Malfoy’s son? Hell, he hadn’t even known Malfoy had a son or that he apparently attended this school.
They stumble their way across the room, not able to keep their mouths or hands off one another. At some point, Draco rips Harry’s shirt off, throwing it over his shoulder not caring where it lands, just needing to feel Harry’s skin against his own. His glasses follow shortly after, tossed without care to the floor.
Everyone always goes on about Harry’s eyes. Yes, he has his mother’s eyes and yes, they are very green but Harry has never understood what’s so fascinating about them.
too. I really, really want too, Draco. But you could, um. Keep pulling on my hair if you’d like,” he says with a grin before he busies his mouth again and slowly takes Draco apart.
He doesn’t expect Harry to, once again, manhandle him around, laying Draco back against the pillows and quickly dragging his pants down, discarding them at the foot of the bed.
He doesn’t expect a fast response. To be honest, he doesn’t expect a response at all. So when Hootie flies back in the window only a half hour later, Harry jumps, lunging across the room to snatch the letter up.
Eyeing the Muggles walking past, Draco still feels a little overdressed in the blue flannel shirt and dark wash jeans he had pilfered from Harry’s wardrobe. After Harry saw him in the ensemble, he had backed Draco up against his bedroom door, running calloused fingers through his hair and kissing the breath from his lungs.
Most of the time Draco’s able to overlook the fact that his life here is based on lies and half truths. He’s used to hiding parts of himself from others. But tonight he aches with longing, wanting to be with someone who really knows him. Someone who knows his past and still chooses to love him anyway.
Draco pulls back and meets his eyes. “I’m sure Harry. I love
Everyone welcomes Blaise easily, congratulating the new couple with hugs and back slaps. Draco is drawn into the excitement and never does get an explanation.
“Nothing!” Harry says, shaking his head in disbelief. Of course that’s the conclusion Malfoy would draw from this. “What? You think this is some kind of incentive so that you'll let me fuck you? Why would I bother when you already give it up so easy.”
Hermione opens the door and enters the room. Once she sees him still in bed and obviously in pain, she crosses the room quickly, her face telling Harry a lecture is coming.
“You look so beautiful like this,” Draco says, shaky and overwhelmed.
Draco Malfoy has just barreled out of the Floo and into Harry, which is presumably Harry’s own fault, and Malfoy is the one apologizing.
Harry smiles, a snarky retort on the tip of his tongue, but then a melancholy feeling settles over him. Laying here, curled against Draco, he desperately wants all the time they’ve wasted back. Wants a time-turner so he can go and smack some sense into their younger selves. Because Harry knows that
It stings, the stretch just this side of painful but the pleasure, the feeling of Draco hard and throbbing, held so tightly inside Harry’s body, is earth shattering. Harry feels full and whole, in a way he never has before.
It’s been nearly eight months since the last time he spent a truly awful afternoon with his father, and Draco doesn’t expect this time to go any better than the last.
An hour later, Harry and Draco step out of the Floo and into the entrance hall of the Manor. Draco tenses beside him and the earlier good mood from their shared shower, seems to evaporate. Harry knows that Draco strongly dislikes being in this house. He’s seen first hand how Draco’s nightmares will return, how for days after a visit here he looks haunted and exhausted, a shell of the person he became after the war.
“I can’t cook, Potter. You know this,” Malfoy insists, removing his shoes and tucking them in the corner out of the way.
“No.” Harry grabs for his hand and guides it back to his head. “Don’t stop.”
Once again, Harry feels the desire to reach out and hold onto Malfoy swell up inside him. It’s like he has been floating along through life, struggling to stay above water and Malfoy is the lifeline he’s been waiting for.
When he walks into the kitchen he finds Kade leaning against the large island eating the last few bites of his breakfast. Draco’s own breakfast is waiting for him under a warming charm.
Harry feels the loneliness settle over him, cold and heavy, like a giant slab of ice slamming into his chest, going right down to his very core.
“Yeah okay,” Harry says rubbing at the back of his neck.
“Did that really just happen?” Draco asks, looking at Harry with wide eyes.
“Alright, if you’re sure? You know you can talk to me Draco, about anything.”
“Would you stop moving,” Draco says, his voice hoarse and low. He’s rolled away from Harry in his sleep, but one hand is stretched across the bed, resting on Harry’s stomach, “You’re stealing all the covers.”
“Hmm,” Draco hums, his hands already starting to tug at Harry’s hair. Merlin, Harry loves that, “I like how you think.”
When he sinks into the hot water, Harry lets out a content sigh. Draco climbs in, sitting in front of Harry and leaning back against his chest. Harry brings his arms up and wraps them around Draco, nuzzling his face into soft blonde hair.
Draco watches his hands move, completely entranced as his fingers handle the delicate clippings. Maybe that’s why he doesn’t hear the door to the greenhouse creak open or the soft clack of Astoria’s heels on the dirt floor, only startling and snapping his head up in irritation when he hears his name being called.
*~~~*
“Mipsy is being sorry Master Draco,” the elf says nervously, bowing low to ground.
“Ready?” Harry asks, shuffling forward and grabbing the base of Draco’s cock to hold it steady.
Potter waits with a smug smile on his face as Draco’s body calms back down to a low simmering arousal.
This week has been crazy so I haven't had a chance to reply to the comments on the last chapter yet, but I hope you guys know I appreciate them so much! I have two more chapters to write and then this fic should be complete!! I might start posting more often once I get them done, if that's something people would want. Maybe twice a week? Let me know what you think :)
Al and Scorpius are handed off to the teacher without incident leaving Harry with no other choice but to walk alongside Malfoy back to the Floo.
Draco sits back on his heels and stares up at Harry. His eyes are wild, the green almost completely eclipsed by black and his lips are red from being bitten. His entire body is shaking and the fact that Draco’s the one who made him loose control so fast, causes a rush of heady power to course though his body.
Draco nods and grants him a small smile as he distractedly continues to devour his breakfast. He enjoys the silence as he eats and watches amused, as his boyfriend moves around his kitchen with easy familiarity.
“You just need to focus. Line it up with your eyes and then follow through,” Harry’s voice is rough against his ear and a shiver shoots down his spine.
“I’ll tell you what to do. Please,” Draco begs and Harry nods, pushing his anxiety down.
Draco tenses, letting out a wrecked sob and holding Harry impossibly closer as he comes between them. His muscles contract, squeezing Harry tight and pulling him deeper, and Harry let’s himself fall. He comes hard, his orgasm going on and on, pulse after pulse making him tremble as he fills Draco up.
“I’m sorry,” she says, an apologetic smile on her face, “I don’t mean to make you uncomfortable, dear. It’s just that you look so much like your mother.”
The close proximity has Draco’s heart pounding. God, this was such a stupid idea. Draco stumbles a bit as they turn and Harry shoots him an amused look.
“It doesn’t matter,” Draco mutters, trying to push Harry’s weight off him.
“Fuck me,” Draco practically screams, when without warning Harry slams his fingers, not two but three, hard into Draco, crooking them up and rubbing them over that little nub of nerves that makes him light up like a bloody Christmas tree.
“Alright fine. If that’s what you think is best,” Kade finally says and Draco lets out a relieved breath at his agreement, though Kade looks anything but happy about it.
“Draco. Draco baby, that’s good, so good,” he rambles, hands tightening in Draco’s hair. Draco only moans in reply, the vibration pulling a whimper from Harry.
Draco’s mouth waters and before he consciously knows what he was doing, he crawls across the bed, sliding off the side, and kneels at Harry’s feet.
Draco crosses the room in three long strides, coming to a stop in front of Harry, his face softening in a way Harry thought he’d never see again.
Draco’s mouth is devastatingly hot as it moves against him and Harry lets himself sink into the feeling. His body soon relaxes enough to allow Draco’s tongue to push past the tight ring of muscle. And isn’t that just a whole new sensation; Draco’s tongue working further in, licking against sensitive tissues and nerves, lighting Harry up from the inside out.
“Yes, yes I know. But at least let me put my dick away before you start pointing out what an idiot I am,” Draco snarks making Harry laugh, and god has Draco missed hearing that sound. He really is an idiot.
“Yes, do try to contain yourself, you brute,” Draco says in mock seriousness, his eyes wet but dancing with humor.
“And here I thought you were going to offer me breakfast,” Draco complains with a pout.
As he cracks the eggs into a skillet, Draco muses that a lot of people would be surprised at his efficiency in caring for his child, at doing
Harry thinks. Aloud, he half sobs, “Just—please.
“Just after Winter hols in eighth year,” Harry answers honestly.
He pushes Draco down onto his back and crawls up after him to cover Draco’s body with his own. Their eyes meet, and in that moment Draco feels such a deep connection to the man above him that it makes his chest ache. God, he loves Harry so fucking much. And he knows this will ruin him, because Harry Potter is
“Thanks,” he says quietly. Malfoy smiles. Harry’s breath catches. It’s the status quo these days.
. And it’s like Harry hasn’t been breathing up until this moment.
Harry closes he eyes and takes a shaky breath. “Okay,” he says opening his eyes, keeping them fixed on Draco, “We’ll need to deal with this. Now.”
“Merlin help us,” Draco mutters, making Harry snort a laugh, “What do you think they’re up too?”
“We agreed a long time ago that this would be the solution should either of us fall in love with someone else.”
And just like that, Draco comes, his body clamping down impossibly tight around Harry’s cock.
Draco sags against the wall in front of him, and Harry follows him forward, peppering soft kisses to the back of his neck. After a moment their harsh breaths slow, and Harry decides they’ve pressed their luck enough for one night. He casts a quick cleaning charm to take care of the mess, then tucks Draco’s still half-hard cock back into his trousers.
“No, you’ve seen me reheat things. There’s a difference,” Malfoy says but he moves closer, definitely interested in what Harry’s doing.
“Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t hex you, Malfoy,” Potter growls through gritted teeth. This could be about what Draco said in the Great Hall at dinner, or it could be the Trip Jinx he sent Potter’s way as they were leaving Charms earlier that afternoon.
This was a terrible idea, Harry thinks the next afternoon as he stands beside Malfoy and watches as their sons play. The park Malfoy suggested they meet at is brilliant though, disguised with a Muggle Repelling Charm and fitted with all manner of high quality Wizarding playground equipment.
“I’m sure. I want this forever Draco, marry me,” Kade replies, cutting off Draco’s protests with a patient smile.
“I’m going to get a drink,” Harry states, narrowing his tired eyes, “Try not to knock the tree over, please.”
“What the fuck Draco?” Kade says in a strained voice but Harry barely hears him, he’s occupied with trying to restrain himself from ripping Draco from the other mans arms.
Potter pulls back just enough to speak. “My turn for dessert.”
Harry does so immediately, pulling almost the whole way out before thrusting back in hard. He sets up a steady rhythm and Draco loses himself in the feeling until he can no longer tell where his body ends and Harry’s begins.
“Take me home,” Draco says quietly, and Harry does.
Malfoy leans closer to look, and Harry tries to not be obvious about the fact that he’s breathing in deeply, trying to catch as much of Malfoy’s maddening scent as he can.
He grins against Draco’s back, his own voice fond and full of affection as he whispers, “Hate you.”
Draco doesn’t seem to mind, letting Harry back him up against the wall, meeting Harry’s rough kiss with eager enthusiasm. His mouth is hot and slick and perfect, and Harry lets his hands roam, touching every inch of Draco he can reach.
Harry brushes their lips together again, smiling into the kiss.
“Meet me in the greenhouse in ten minutes,” Harry whispers in Draco’s ear, just as the last of the guests head for the Floo.
Harry throws his head back and laughs loudly. “Remember in eighth year when -“ Harry’s cut off by Hermione’s voice floating through the door.
The elf pops into the room a second later, his small bony arms weighed down with the large piece of fabric. It’s rolled up tightly, tied off with a gleaming red bow, and Draco sees Harry eyeing it curiously beside him.
Draco mutters to himself when there’s no answer. He came to yell at Potter and the insufferable git isn’t even here.
*~~~*
. . .
He knows Ron’s right. Harry loves the party the Weasley’s throw every summer. The tradition had started after the war. When the dead were buried and everyone had spent many trying weeks grieving in their own ways, Molly insisted a get together to celebrate the living was just what everybody needed. So the bonfire became an annual event and Harry has never missed one, “Plus mum’ll lose the plot if you don’t show up,” Ron says with a pleading look.
. . .
He’ll admit that the last few weeks have been hard. Most nights he barely sleeps, his bed too empty without Draco there. At first, Draco’s excuses seemed valid, so Harry didn’t worry. But the more time that passed, the further Draco seemed to push him away. He didn’t understand it, couldn’t figure out where everything had gone so wrong.
And then Potter says his name—like a plea. And whatever was left of Draco’s doubts disintegrate to dust.
Draco watches as his father’s face contorts. You would think that his father would feel gratitude towards Potter, considering he’s the only reason Draco isn’t sitting in a cell too. But Lucius still holds Potter responsible for his loss of power and status.
But Draco certainly has no intention of dumping his baggage on Potter’s shoulders. He can’t unload all this on him. He should leave.
“You’re still married,” Hermione states matter of factly, her eyes narrowed and her lips pressed tightly together, smudging her pink lipstick.
Astoria wishes them a good evening and then Harry lifts their clasped hands, kissing Draco’s knuckles before Apparating them away without warning. Draco’s stomach tries to drop out through his feet and he stumbles when they land a moment later.
That old anger that Draco keeps buried rises to the surface and suddenly he has a strong urge to list all the ways his father has fucked up his life, his mothers life, his own. He wants to yell and scream at the unfairness of it all.
They stand wrapped around each other in silence for a few moments, Kade’s hands rubbing soothing circles on Draco’s lower back, before he slowly pulls out of their embrace and meets Draco’s gaze.
“I do. I care about him a lot,” he replies simply.
“Can you keep an eye on the boys for a few minutes?” Harry asks, already picking up his empty mug and shuffling his feet in the direction of the kitchen. He could just ask Kreacher to get him his coffee but Harry needs a minute without the noise and squeals assaulting his eardrums.
Malfoy always looks so put together, his clothes crisp and wrinkle free. His hair, even when pulled up in a messy knot, still looks styled to perfection. His sharp jaw never has even the hint of stubble and his nails are manicured and clean.
“Fine,” she says with a sigh, “Only because I don’t have time for your stubbornness this morning. But we are going to talk about this Draco, soon,” Astoria kisses his cheek and takes a step back, “I came out here to tell you that I received an owl from the Ministry, I have to go in early today.”
“Harry.”
“Fine. Vanilla spice latte,” Draco says, shuffling back towards the tables, “Thank you, Potter.”
That answer is unexpected, and so is the sting of disappointment Draco feels in his chest. There’s a part of him, small though it may be, that likes Potter’s stupid little gestures. He pushes it away though, because this is good. It means this thing between them can continue and stay uncomplicated. But—
“Why did you invite Malfoy if all you’re gonna do is glare at him all night?”
not Malfoy.
“Harry!” Scorpius jumps to his feet and gives Harry a fist bump, then a hug.
“Ugh! Fine Hermione,” Harry says, throwing his arms in the air, “It went terrible. He’s only back for me to sign the divorce papers. He ran his mouth, I lost my temper. Did you really expect anything else?”
Harry trudges down the stairs and into the kitchen. He taps his wand against the half full coffee pot, reheating it, and then fills his mug. He adds flavored creamer and a scoop of sugar, giving it a quick stir before he leans back against the counter. Steam wafts up from his cup, the smell of strong coffee and sweet vanilla causing a happy sigh to escape his lips.
“Yes.” Draco is panting and breathless already, but he can’t bring himself to care.
Before he can talk himself out of it, Draco walks to the fireplace and throws in a pinch of Floo powder.
He nods quickly. “Yes. Don’t you dare stop.”
Harry mouths at his neck, letting his teeth graze soft skin as his fingers quickly move to pull Draco’s cock free. He’s hard, heavy and hot in Harry’s hand, already slick with pre-come.
Harry cuts in, because he can’t listen to this speech again. “Ron, don’t. It’s fine.” Because it’s easier to lie and pretend that going to work everyday isn’t slowly stealing his sanity, than it is to admit that the career he’s had his heart set on since he was fourteen, isn’t as great as he imagined.
A shocked laugh escapes Draco and she gives him a tentative smile in return.
He’s Editor in Chief of
This chapter kind of ran away from me a bit, so this update is longer than usual! It picks up right where the last chapter ended. Enjoy <3
thanks for reading <3
She hands Draco a cream-colored piece of parchment, sealed closed with the Malfoy crest. He’s baffled for a moment before he realizes what it must be.
The flush turns a brighter red and Draco closes his eyes and breaths out.
The older that Harry gets, the more he seems to enjoy working in the kitchen, experimenting with new dishes and adding his own twists to old favorites. Over the last few years, Harry’s done a lot of cooking. No longer having a house elf makes it a necessity, if he wants to eat something other than takeaway that is.
Draco can’t deny that he’s excited. He’s never really been on a date before. The courting he was expected to do in regards to Astoria doesn’t really count.
She turns and immediately pulls him into a tight hug, her familiar scent enveloping him. Vanilla and apple butter and warm sun on fallen pine needles.
When they walk up to the restaurant, their hands not clasped but teasingly brushing, pinkies catching, Draco feels a smile stretch across his face.
Harry steps quickly into the room and claps on a hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, halting him.
“It’s nice to see you Granger,” Malfoy says, friendly enough, but Harry can hear the tension underneath the light tone.
“Give Rose a kiss from me,” Harry says with a smile, thinking of his goddaughter.
“I have to—I’m sorry but I can’t do this.” He knows he’s breathing too fast, probably looks like he’s gone mad, but he doesn’t care. He needs to talk to Harry, has to fix this before it’s too late.
Potter’s mouth is hot, his tongue wicked as it teases and caresses. He laves at Draco’s fingers, moaning around them as his eyelids drop closed.
Draco’s teeth dig into his lower lip, holding back a noise of his own. The sight of Harry on his knees—looking up at Draco through his lashes, his eyes dark and full of devotion—is absolutely devastating.
Potter doesn’t seem to have anything else to say though, as he grabs Draco by the ankles and hooks them over his shoulders. Then his thumbs are spreading Draco open.
They sit in comfortable silence for a few minutes, both sipping their drinks and watching the snow fall outside the window. Harry’s excited for the evening they have planned, Christmas movies and pizza with the kids, and then Scorpius is sleeping over for the first time.
There’s always a moment, when he’s buried so deep inside Draco’s body, and everything just becomes so overwhelming, that Harry loses it. He gives himself over to all the emotions that this irritating, beautiful bastard stirs up in him, and lets the rush of possessiveness overcome him.
The kitchen is bright and open. The cabinets have been replaced, the white standing out strikingly against the new marble counter tops and dark hardwood floor. It looks nothing like the dingy room it’d been five years ago.
And if Draco sleeps in Potter’s bed again that night, no one but them has to know.
“Christ, Draco,” Harry mumbles, pulling Draco to his feet, both of them stumbling before they manage to kick their pants away. They kiss then, soft and languid, tongues brushing lightly. Harry doesn’t know what he would have done if he’d lost this. “I don’t wanna stop kissing you.”
As he stares at the ceiling, his breathing still too quick, Harry realizes that of all the places Malfoy’s mouth had touched in his dream, their lips never met. Harry longs, even if it’s only an image his unconscious mind produces, to know what it’s like to kiss Malfoy. To have that mouth against his own. He thinks they would fit together perfectly, just as they do in so many other ways.
“I want you to fuck me,” Harry whispers.
Draco once told Harry that he reminded him of trees; strong and resistant, never wavering under pressure. Deep-rooted. Tall, his long legs making him eye level with Draco. His tan skin rough with blemishes and scars. And those eyes. Merlin. They’re so green, like the color of the leaves in summer.
“I’m going to need you to be more specific, Potter,” Draco says, rolling his eyes and feigning nonchalance, but Harry doesn’t miss the way he takes a step back.
“Oh. Yeah I uh. Looks like we’ll all be eating leftovers for a month,” Harry replies with a nervous laugh.
“I quit,” Harry repeats, “Sent my Patronus to Robards a few minutes ago. You’re not upset are you?” Harry has to ask because he can’t quite interrupt the look on his friends face. “You’ve been trying to get me to quit for months.”
“Holding cell.”
Draco pushes a little, watches the rain expand to fill the entire room. He watches it soak Barnaby and laughs at his face of utter betrayal. His magic, at this level, is playful. Barnaby may not agree, but a little bit of madness is wholesome.
She cuts him off again with the same hand gesture. She looks nothing like Narcissa, but they are wearing an identical facial expression. “I am trying to tell you that we have programs for omegas like you at this prison. It will be nothing like you are probably expecting.”
When it is finally Draco's turn on the stand, Dolohov’s lawyer asks him to explain the events as they occurred.
“My Confundus is not ideal, Mrs. Weasley!” Barnaby is always playing the victim. He continues to spout excuses throughout Draco’s quick trip to St. Mungos and his return to house arrest in Malfoy Manor. Draco starts to completely tune them out.
After that conversation, and several dressing downs from Barnaby and his mother, Draco feels like utter shit on the day of his trial. He makes Lucius, after five years of withdrawal in Azkaban, look like a top model.
“I’m going to Azkaban.” Draco says. “I am in withdrawal. My last hope to survive it is a bond bite.”
It’s too much. It’s already too much but when Potter’s hands come to cross across Draco’s torso, he twists like a feral cat to break free. The garden goes black, like he’s crossed from summer into the dead of winter.
Lucius is not
“Spit it out, Barnaby.”
The wards disallow apparation, not that Draco’s handcuffs would permit it anyway, so the two without magically bound hands will be taking turn rowing a little boat like muggles.
“No.” Barnaby holds his gut while he stands up. “You were fighting the whole time, before. I knew those damn Azkaban healers were trying to just kill you. They don’t have the money for whatever Granger is cooking up, I promise you that!”
“I didn’t know you were fond of traditional pureblood ways of life. Hitting your omega –”
“Mr. Malfoy, this song and dance will not sway the Wizengamot.” Mad-Dog seems to be growing taller in his anger, until he’s towering over Draco. “Isn’t it true that the omegan attributes could sway a court?”
Since he’d arrived, Draco has been running on the assumption that he was imprisoned in the Azkaban of nightmares in the North Sea. It turns out, New Azkaban is across the strait in actual England. It’s welcome news -- England is beholden to international law -- but Draco and his legal team will have to find a way to cross the water.
Granger tuts, speaking for the first time. “We’ll get you to St. Mungos soon enough, Malfoy.” She turns to Barnaby, “I can’t
The door opens and the water floods outside, leaving Draco wet from his waist down. Blaise, having been held under the current, is sputtering.
Harry rolls his eyes. “You know, most people automatically assume the Grimoire.”
Draco could. This room is small enough that he’d be able to use that same idea to fill the whole thing with freezing water. When they’d discovered Celeste, she’d had the water up to the bed skirt. Draco knows – he
“25.” Older Draco looks incredibly alarmed all of a sudden. He waves his hands in a complicated motion, no wand seemingly required, until they are both standing in an Azkaban holding cell, a nicer one than Draco has ever seen. The muggle kitchen has completely vanished.
“Isn’t keeping me out of Azkaban your job?” Draco asks, speaking into the little red phone that allows Barnaby to hear him. Barnaby, a weak and pathetic beta, flinches. He seems very wary of the muggle phone.
Finally, the pictures of Dolohov’s blown out head make Draco sink further into depression. Nobody wants an omega who can stomach shooting an alpha through the head and trying to find the bullet to hide the evidence.
Astrid screams at the top of her lungs for about half an hour, even when the guard comes to give them lunch. When Draco looks down at his tray, he sees that they’ve given him a knife, which they only do at dinner.
“Honestly, Draco.” Finally, Astrid Yaxley has spoken. “You never were too bright.”
If Astrid weren’t an insufferable person, he may have told her that he could feel the foundations down to where they were bolted into the ground. He could almost tell the exact dimensions of every room North and South of himself. If he concentrated enough, he was sure he could sense his father, pacing up and down his cell and mumbling to himself.
It is not surprising that the Dolohov family has a bit of a better lawyer. He looks like a bulldog come to life. This man reveals that Draco had been peddling muggle drugs from England to the continent for the past five years, working for Dolohov. Narcissa gives him a signature raised-eyebrow look at this information.
The white muggle shirt he’s wearing is open because it’s been split from the collar to the armpit, presumably by Draco himself, as he’s trying to staunch the flow of blood with a Wizard’s travelling cloak. Sometimes, he’s pressed in an alley behind the Leaky Cauldron. Other times, he’s imagined himself in Knockturn alley. Either way, it’s twilight. The entire scene is bathed in blue light.
Astrid is looking at him like he is the dumbest person in the world, and perhaps he is. “He’s not in withdrawal! He’s just all sad and mopey because he saw her and now: she’s gone.”
“An omega led astray by alphas!” Barnaby is yelling now. “Tell me
She tilts her head to the side. This had been a large point of contention for them, over the years. “Wouldn’t fuck me
Draco cocks his head to the side, looks at his father. He tries to understand if he seems desperate or not.
“I’m not sure if it exists either.” Draco says, honestly. “But I know that I’ve been there.”
Older Draco stands taller and points at him, accusatory. “You are terrified. You desperately want to return to go find Harry. Part of you thinks you’re dead.”
Blaise’s lawyer, whom Draco recognizes as the Parkinson representative, jumps on Barnaby with even more force than Dolohov’s had. Draco was housed in a low security ward with omegas instead of alphas, who would be raping him or worse. Draco was allowed to leave to go to required meetings with his officer – Granger – at any time. Draco had no reason to attempt to murder Blaise Zabini in cold blood, self-inflicted trauma or not.
part.”
Granger turns around in the boat, stilling it in the middle of the sea as she stops paddling. “
“It’s easy.” Draco says, which it is. “I take the drugs from London in a suitcase. I confund the muggle plane security officer. I arrive in Moscow and give the suitcase to...” it’s a dark moment.
impossible for an omega (a detruit!) to kill a healthy alpha with their bare hands.
“I thought it was a muggle in London.... but it was Dolohov.”
Sometimes Draco thinks about this as if it’s banal, just something for him to daydream about. Sometimes it’s so powerful it feels like he’ll die if it doesn’t happen. Sometimes he thinks it would change his life.
I do have this story somewhat planned, but it's been taking me forever to write the chapters. If you're following, bless you.
Lucius is getting angry, but Draco hates to be spoken to like he’s a child. “Tell Harry Potter – when he inevitably asks about the limits of your power – that you can go into the vellum that he so desperately wants to get into!”
Blaise is suffering in prison.
though, a small voice in Draco's head reminds him. Lucius is not permanently, clinically insane from withdrawal.
“Malfoy –” Harry asks and then seems to think better of it. He clears his through throat and then starts again. “Draco. Have you ever used old magick?”
“Relax, I’m only here for a minute, you’ll know soon enough.” Dream Lucius says wandering through the kitchen. He looks younger and somehow different than Draco has ever seen him. He’s about to ask that when Young Lucius turns to look at him face on.
The door slams shut so loud that the sound reverberates in the cell. For a second, Draco just stands there, clutching the scratchy linen that Granger assured him was a step up from regular Azkaban. It’s a four-person room with barely enough space to breathe, but his cellmates do seem to be immersed in something.
She’s outside on the balcony, which can be seen from the street. As soon as he pops into the alleyway her eyes settle on his. She gestures simply for him to walk upstairs.
“Which omegas?”
In a replication of every awkward or unpleasant conversation he’s ever had with his parents, he sits daintily across from her on the balcony. She’s drinking whiskey and he goes to pour himself one without asking.
“The Grimoire.” Older Draco is slouched onto the countertop with his head pillowed in his palm. “Start with the grimoire.”
“Is that the secret code around here?” Draco asks. “Nobody can tell me dick and I’m supposed to be okay with that?”
To add to that feeling, Hermione Granger has arranged (as a kindness) a meeting with Lucius before Draco’s court date.
“Oh, yes, I forgot you were friends still,” Blaise finally says but he’s too self-absorbed to see Draco’s own body betraying him. “I feel so guilty I can’t be with her; she’ll need my magic for the baby.”
This has happened to him several times since childhood, and Draco is eerily familiar with the feeling of bitter terror that takes hold. He tries to calm himself as the water keeps plunging down, knowing that his own magic won’t kill him, but the body’s natural response is too well developed. After a few seconds Draco starts to thrash until his eyes white-out along the edges.
Maleka is nodding next to her. “I miss my mother and father.” She sighs, somehow still unsettling, staring into space. “It’s so important to keep my magic, but there’s no reason for an omega not to visit.” Celeste Yaxley has been dead for seven years, so Draco is starting to seriously wonder about Maleka’s sanity when she says: “of course, that’s rarely possible from the grave.”
“No,” Draco says, noting that Potter instantly believes him. “No. I don’t make a practice of going out to Wiltshire ever and especially not to give myself a heart attack.”
“You went completely still. Like you were dead.”
“Don’t you feel better, darling?”
Within a few seconds, Draco is looking at Pansy as his younger self. He is living the All Hallow’s Eve ball as if it were the present.
"How is it sad?” he inquires, turning around. It’s as if he and Harry are standing in the middle of this street, exactly as it was fifteen years ago.
“He’s the researcher that’s constantly asking me these questions. Tell him what you can do.”
in history who has been wiped clean of his magic. Normally, the universe just lets nature run its course. Now, Draco will live on indefinitely.
He stands, shell-shocked, in the middle of his cell. He can’t be far away from Lucius, who would throw an absolute fit over this turn of events, and maybe if he screams loud enough –
“To whom, Mr. Malfoy?”
Draco wraps his arms around himself, still freezing, but shocked to find that he’s not wet. He’s even more surprised to find himself wearing Slytherin robes, especially because Harry is wearing a muggle suit.
“Can’t you just take my confession and send me to Azkaban?” Draco asks. “Or leave me to rot here?”
Barnaby laughs, a bit too enthusiastically given the circumstances. “Draco, don’t you think if you could pop back and forth to different dimensions, I’d not have found you in a muggle prison two months ago?”
Draco nods, “do what?”
Draco would love to scream. Of course, he should have an alpha. Of course, his prospects are utter shit at this moment to find somebody suitable enough. But even if things worked out somehow someway with somebody, it’s a bit rich that Lucius would suggest it would actually help him when his father has clearly been in withdrawal for years. Lucius himself is married to a pureblood alpha witch and is still suffering from withdrawal, even when his wife is just outside the door.
Draco hated modeling underwear and muggle workwear equally.
“You’re…. me?” Draco asks. Younger Draco asks.
He laughs at this. “No. Not quite.”
The High Inquisitor turns to Draco, finally, and asks if he has anything to say for himself.
“Not yet,” Blaise says. “She wants to do it before we get introduced to the whole prison population though, apparently somebody told her that bondings may stop alphas from attacking me, did you know that?”
“It’s tonight.” Harry says, with a faraway look in his eyes. To Draco’s blank look, “The full moon. It’s tonight.”
Harry is obviously drunk. He is heavily favoring one side and his face looks murderous, like the stupid robe has truly upset him.
Draco lies back in the grass. Now, it feels gloriously like he remembers, if not better. Potter pulls his hand away, and Draco eyes snap back at him, certain that he’s done something wrong. The scene shifts, as if he's looking at a copy of the garden he remembers.
“Merlin Draco, I’ve been doing this for an hour.”
“No.” Lucius snaps. “No. They said this was a place. A physical place somewhere between the fabric of the present and the future. Somewhere else entirely.”
During the rest of their easy conversation, Draco constantly wants to scream ‘
Potter turns around and flops against his bed, banging the back of his head against the wall in a gesture of giving up completely. “It’s not domestic violence. Merlin.”
“Shut the hell up, Malfoy.” He says it while gritting his teeth, so Draco knows he’s
Harry howls with another hoot of laughter. It startles Draco for the second time. “You know it! You know the history!” He says it like he’s barely restraining pointing his finger.
Barnaby spins a remarkably cheesy story. Draco is only a pitiful omega being harassed by a big bad alpha. Scared and hurt, Draco just snapped and shot a Death Eater turned Drug Dealer in the face without any reason. It is difficult for Draco not to roll his eyes.
“Did you set the ministry holding cell on fire?” Granger is asking.
Maleka finally looks up, her twin black stare only a little bit unsettling now. She tilts her head to the side.
says what he’s thinking. “Do you feel better with an alpha?” There is a long pause where Draco tries to convey with heavy eye contact what the elephant in the room is.
Draco knows that for sure. He knows the truth of the statement in his damn bones.
Barnaby strides over and grabs one of his wrists, feeling the tsunami bubbling underneath his skin. “Merlin and Morgana both. It’s like a fucking forest fire.”
She was detruit. How could that possibly be up for debate? Celeste has been the only person whom Draco has seen crack open brick and concrete because of her pain. Right before his sixth year, when she had died in the Manor, there were fissures all in the wood in her floors. It was like she was trying to sink through to the dungeon.
Lucius doesn’t pretend it’s a possibility that Draco won’t be here permanently in two weeks. For that, Draco is thankful.
Potter puts both of his hands into his hair like he’s standing in one of those muggle plane metal detectors. His face gets bright red – a feat for somebody so dark – and he turns to the wall behind him.
Day 3 of solitary conferment waiting for his trial is the first that feels like torture. He is starting to believe that his magic is sentient and feels so bad for him that it creates Harry. If most of it hadn’t been flushed out through his pores, he would have definitely convinced himself of this. As it is, Dream Harry seems weaker and weaker. The thought of never seeing him again makes Draco feel like he’s going to throw up.
For a split second, Lucius does look somewhat sympathetic. He quickly schools his features. “Ask Barnaby if you can visit me when you come to Azkaban for good.”
“They use it as…. A training ground. Somewhere that wizards can access all throughout their lives.”
“And… you know why he wants to be there.” Somehow, Draco immediately knows she’s talking about Harry.
“This is the side of you the Wizengamot doesn’t like, Draco!” Barnaby is frantic. Draco can still hear his insufferable voice through the phone, muffled. “Show them the real you.”
Suddenly, Draco feels like he might faint. “Harry Potter?”
“I wanted it!” He bursts out, tears stinging his eyes. “It was mine!”
“Domestic violence?” Draco lifts one of his eyebrows and watches Potter roll his shoulders back. Jackpot.
In his fantasy, he’s cold.
Barnaby grimaces. “You are a danger to the statute of security here.” This is true. “The prosecutor has said that you are...” Barnaby looks as if he is slowly being stabbed.
"Draco, please,” Dream Harry begs. He gets down on his knees before Draco, takes his hands. It’s incredibly overwhelming, even though it isn’t real. Draco is doubled over and tries to pull his hands away to steady himself, but Harry objects. “Draco. Listen.”
“Harry?” he asks a completely empty room with very little furniture. It’s a risk, for certain. This looks sort of like a vacant area of The Manor. Classroom? Unused bedroom?
Another day, another trial. This time, the location is the makeshift chamber the Dark Lord used to free the dementors. It sounds more dramatic than it feels.  Draco is sitting in a lawn chair that has moss growing on it.
Draco feels the hot burn of annoyance sting down his back. “Oh, really dim of me to realize in three seconds flat instead of inherently knowing about this stupid idea before even walking in.”
Azkaban arraignments do not live up to the hype. Each of the “council” is sat on a wooden church pew that looks as if it was swept in by the ocean. To Draco’s left, his own stunning team of legal professionals: Barnaby, his mother who will not speak, and himself.
produce power like that.
“Are you okay?” That’s Blaise. He’s been day-dreaming about Pansy through the whole Celeste conversation.
“It depresses me too!”
Nobody says a word until Narcissa decides to stir the pot a little. “Lucius said he would speak to you about what you have an obligation to say.”
They both stare at each other in an imaginary field. Now that Draco has his bearings, he studies himself more closely. This version of Draco doesn’t look as much like Lucius as he did at first sight. His hair is just as long, but it’s slightly wavy and falls in thick curtains down to the middle of his back. There are laugh lines all over his face: in the corners of his eyes. On his forehead.
“He talks about her in his sleep,” Maleka says. Compared to Astrid, Maleka is chronically creepy. “Or – he used to.”
It’s not even a sex fantasy (which would somehow be better). In the fantasy, he is physically beaten. On his face is a large black eye that stretches to his temple and an open gash that cuts from his neck down to his left nipple. Even though the story behind the wound is vague, those specific injuries are always present.
Somehow, Dream Harry knows that. “Hey,” he whispers taking his hand below Draco’s pointed chin and lifting up, forcing them to eye contact. “This is just a bad time for you. It won’t always be like this.”
“I’d like to ask Secretary Granger about the vellum.”
Nobody is around. “Harry?” Draco asks, thrilled to have travelled again.
Lucius looks pained. “Tell him the truth.”
He looks resigned, but also weirdly like he loves to humor Draco. Like he knew this might happen. He stands and for a moment they just look at each other.
This would make him a very calm prisoner, but a piss poor wizard. And– it breaks Draco’s heart to know that this is what he immediately thinks– a horrible omega. It’s like taking his birthright and throwing it back in his face.
Barnaby, by some miracle, has left him with some magic. He can still light sparks in his cell and play tic-tac-toe using his hand to draw the etches in the walls. Sometimes, the flint doesn’t seem to be required anymore and then it comes back all at once, as if he’s been recharged.
Draco has actually used the Daemonum. Harry didn’t need to know that though, apparently.
Lucius scoffs, “find an alpha.”
Draco is starting to get impatient. “Yes, Father, I know, the everlasting omega power, I’ve heard this before.”
He exits the room. Draco wakes up.
to submit
Harry holds up his hand. “I have an Arbatel.”
Finally, Lucius says, with a signature sneer, “you look awful.”
Lucius must see the blood start to drain from his face. “They were trying to help me. They wanted me to show them how to access… another world.”
Parkinson’s pregnant now so we’ll never be able to get you to stop touching her and keep your magic—”
“No, no, no, no, no.” Potter sounds a little bit desperate, and quickly gathers Draco’s upper body against his chest. “Focus on where we are. Focus on the trees and the sounds of the birds.”
He stands up straight, not able to stop himself from silently crying. He can’t meet Harry’s eyes. “Draco, baby. This is a real place. But time—it isn’t the same here.”
“Hey,” Potter reaches out and cups his cheek in his hand. He traces the side of his cheek, right where that stupid cut from muggle prison should be. For some reason, Draco isn’t surprised to feel that it isn’t there. “Focus. Don’t go there.”
That’s not surprising. Draco’s hormones are soaking the cell so much that he can feel it himself. If Potter said one spell it would be magnified by a thousand, a dangerous issue for Draco, but he can't stop it. Knowing that Potter is in trouble for something – that’s sweeter than candy. It makes his head spin.
Draco rolls his eyes. Apparently, standard procedure for welcoming inmates to Azkaban involves a trip to the principal’s office. “I can’t set anything on fire by myself.”
” He whispers it, as if anybody in a muggle prison would have any idea what that means. “Five years living without an alpha in the muggle world! Please tell me it isn’t true!”
Draco has never once discussed his dynamic inheritance with his father, even though they have remarkably similar stories. After seven years of not discussing it, it has become more and more awkward every time the subject is nudged.
“Not every omega is a simpering fool.” This implies that Draco is one. “Not every omega needs an alpha to kiss them goodnight.” This implies that Draco does. “And no omega needs an alpha to be magically powerful.” This, finally, is objectively true. “We are the strongest of wizards – we have no weakness but ourselves.”
Draco’s face heats, which is exactly what she wants. He doesn’t really know why he came here.
Draco has literally summoned demons to boost dark magic, just to get himself out of his own cellar when he has locked himself in. He isn’t afraid of the spirit of the moon, who is most often explored by children.
That’s a bit pot kettle for Draco’s taste.  “There’s not a lot I can do about it, is there?”
Draco doesn’t know. Those memories are gone. He wakes up and gets a text to go to a warehouse. The warehouse gives him a plane ticket. That’s all.  “After the war?”
He means for it to come out bitter and accusing, but instead it seems like a valid question. Something about standing in his father’s cell, which will soon be identical to
The lawyer looks extremely annoyed, even more so than Barnaby, still steaming about Draco’s not-so-secret job. “Mr. Malfoy you are on trial for knowingly killing Antonin Dolohov, a wizard, with a muggle firearm in muggle London.”
“Did you have a girlfriend or something?” Draco asks one morning, while he’s trying to wash his face in the stupid little basin. Granger’s fancy prisons have these little bathrooms attached to the side, but she’s managed to overlook that Draco would trade the bathroom at Malfoy Manor for one second without Blaise and the Yaxley sisters.
His story isn’t straight. Draco knows he went on the plane with the drugs. He returned to London with the empty suitcase and gave it back to a man with a long beard like Dumbledore. He had thought it was a muggle for many years, but recently he noticed the alpha pheromones and assumed it was a wizard. It is much easier to traffic drugs as a wizard.
our magic together – three omegas without any control – and break the magically cemented walls.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “What about Saint Potter, huh? Nobody cares that an omega can’t produce that amount of power?” Granger is looking at him with her eyebrows raised. Draco takes his hands and crosses his heart, “
Lucius and Draco are standing in silence when Draco
be, but I cannot help you with violent crimes.” Barnaby looks as if he is being punished. “I know that you are something of a sweetheart, Dra—”
Narcissa flips her stare back to him, just for a second. “I don’t pretend to know what you can and cannot do, darling.” It’s enough – barely – for Draco to deduce what he needs to do.
Draco does know, unfortunately, but only because he reads the astrology section in The Prophet. “Yes, well,” he’s looking at the ground again, curse him. “Doesn’t every young wizard want to commune with Phul?”
“Yes.” Draco doesn’t know at all. “I’ve spoken to him.” Harry did not mention why he was there at all.
The mind is so desperate.
“Your Honor, he is clearly lying to avoid a longer sentence!” The lawyer is holding somebody’s hand, somebody on Dolohov’s side. “This omega no longer has an alpha because of Draco Malfoy’s actions!”
Barnaby is mentioning the colloquial term for being destroyed by his own magic when there is no alpha for Draco to bond with. As an omega, he cannot use most of the magic building inside him, so it attacks his brain and his motor functions as his magic grows stronger. Three more years of this, by Draco’s estimate, and he’ll destroy half of the B-block where he’s currently being housed.
Draco can’t focus when he’s confused. He’s shaking like a leaf against Potter’s chest, which makes the hold incredibly awkward. Draco cringes a little when Potter presses his nose against the juncture of Draco’s jaw and inhales deeply. It’s so contradictory to the night in the holding cell, that Draco feels like he’s having a panic attack.
Blaise doesn’t respond. Draco usually exhibits this kind of behavior, but he’s been having much more interaction (granted – with omegas) in these few days than he has in several months. The Yaxleys have been primed by their parents to go through withdrawal on purpose because it makes them more powerful, so they don’t appear to be reacting the same way.
Potter laughs, deep and low. It sounds so good in his voice. It reminds Draco of singing. “I still don’t want to tell you, but you already know.”
appears before Draco it’s almost like he doesn’t recognize him. He doesn’t bother with formalities whatsoever. He drops to his knees in front of him and helps Draco hold his cloak to his chest.
Harry keeps shushing him, but every time Draco starts to settle he remembers that this is a horrible trick his mind decided to play in his insanity and it becomes impossible to listen to the praise that Dream Harry keeps whispering, to the point where it feels like he’s having a panic attack. It feels like he’s back in the white room, watching from the outside as his magic suffocates him.
He does look ridiculous. He fiddles with the collar and tries to see if it will tear away. Unfortunately, the “premium” pleather fabric sticks together.
Draco remembers this. Sort of. He remembers Potter’s divorce, but thought he dreamed talking to him about it. Or was it a separation? The newspaper had reported that Miss Weasel herself had abandoned the Savior. He wants to ask about it- he probably wanted to ask two years ago too- but knows it would be terribly uncouth. They haven’t had imaginary meetings in Draco’s subconscious yet.
Draco’s about to go back to his bed and start mourning that he is the only detruit in this room when Astrid’s big mouth finally says something interesting.
“I know.”
“—Then you know the risks.” Granger says it very seriously, like she’s telling him a secret. “You know what kind of magical energy is required.”
Did he take an oath?
In all his life, Draco has never associated his omega with an animal. It’s not something he’s proud of, to be certain, but the omega traits have always been a part of him. Not something separate. Not an animal.
Draco especially mourns the loss of the man he expected to become as a child. He misses the dream omega life he had imagined for himself when he presented.
When Celeste died, she had rambled for ages about the source. She had said it would be possible to find the source without an alpha. She could feel it within herself. Sometimes – she used to tell Draco that it burned in her neck.
Barnaby is slapping him.
It is unsightly. It had happened yesterday morning. To be frank, Draco doesn’t really remember the incident at all because – as Barnaby has so lovingly pointed out the previous week – his mind is being fried by his own excess magic. He has been told by staff that another inmate had tried to steal his books, so Draco punched him in the face and received a charming cut from an old screwdriver in return.
“How old are you?” Old Draco asks, casually.
“Draco, I can’t tell you this, you need to think about this.” He whispers this. “I can’t tell you.”
None of this makes any sense to Draco, but Potter seems to be genuine. He hadn’t even noticed that the garden had gone extremely dark in the couple of minutes when Draco was being too uncooperative. As he settles back against Potter, the sun seems to peek from behind the trees again.
"Nevertheless, those pigs can give you a comfortable life, Draco. One where money is not an issue! I just worry for you, my love."
The entire room looked like a macabre barbie doll bedroom. Draco felt as if he'd get a sugar rush simply looking at it. While he enjoyed simple feminine touches to his aesthetics, he had to admit that this room was a shot to the senses; an overload of girlish charm. The entire bloody room looked as if a child decorated it. Perhaps in his youth, this room would be something that Draco begged his father for, but now that he's an adult, he can't help but feel as if he had been regressed into his youth.
"Of course. Kreacher is happy to serve Master Draco," he cheered in a high pitched nasally tone, bowing before the blonde and receiving a curtsy back from Draco. Harry's eyebrows furrowed as Draco looked back at him, a smug smile on his pink lips. He looked like the cat that got the cream, his dainty nose in the air as he climbed up the spiral staircase towards the second floor, following the hobbling little house elf. Harry simply pursed his lips and walked towards the kitchen. The second floor looked as rundown and rickety as the first and Draco found himself missing his one room home with Ms. Shrew. They passed dozens of doors, each the same exact style and color. Cobwebs hung in the corners and the carpeting did little to stop the creaking of the floor which made Draco worry that he'd fall right through if he were to step too hard. The walls were littered with pictures of owners' pasts, each a new family member that Draco had never had the pleasure to meet. They looked quite the wild bunch, he thought. No doubt that was the cause of his mother's rather cavalier and eccentric tastes. Not to mention his Auntie Bellatrix: the woman was absolute menace to society.
Draco's cheeks turned bright red and he scoffed, pulling away from Harry's grasp. "Don't think I've fallen so easily, Mr. Potter. I assure you, you'll have to try much harder to win my affections before I could ever agree to marry you. I'll have you know, I have multiple suitors in line!"
Draco stopped in his tracks and whipped around to his friend. "That's why you object him?? Because you're infatuated with the idea of my and Mr. Potter's relationship. I assure you, 'Mione, Mr. Potter and I are nothing but cordial."
"Then it's settled! A masquerade ball!" Ron mused, smiling at Hermione's excitement.
"A-and I have a spare room!"
A small clearing of the throat alerted the two. They turned their heads to find Hermione staring at them, hands on her hips and cocked head.
"Oh, you wound me," Harry feigned pain as he clutched his heart dramatically. "What would your future spouse say if they heard that you swear like a sailor?"
Draco whined and trailed behind his father as his mother joined them. They piled into their carriage and the three of them drove off to town.
"Yeah, he's… beautiful," Harry murdered back, eyes never leaving the blonde vixen that lit up the room like a ball of lightning.
"Well, Pansy and I are just going to go and uhhhh look at somethings," Blaise said while hurriedly trying to drag Pansy away against her protests. "Make sure you return our Draco just as you'd found him, Harry~" thus, leaving the blonde and brunette alone in the exit of Honeydukes.
"Good morning! I see you two have gotten comfortable with some breakfast!" In came Ron, a sweaty mess with his shirt untucked and buttons undone. Draco smiled fondly at the messy appearance until Harry appeared from behind him.
Narcissa looks out into the water, not bothering to paddle anymore. It turns out that Barnaby is good enough to row the boat by himself. Perhaps he is worth the obscene amount of gold he’s paid.
Lucius sighs and stares into the wall. “You have to keep the animal in check, Draco.”
They both stare at each other for a long moment. Lucius grits his teeth. “You are an ungrateful child. Everything I did was to show you a higher order.”
Pansy looks confused, possibly for the first time he’s even known her. “What exactly do you want Draco?”
“Everybody here wants to only speak in cryptic riddles.” Draco roll his eyes. “What on earth is that rubbish supposed to mean?” Lucius’s eyes flash. No matter how hard he tries, when he starts yelling, he has a bit of a west country accent. When he speaks again, he struggles to maintain his breathing and sound as posh as possible.
She leans back in her chair and stares at him, hard. She’s been lurking around him since
Nobody bats an eye when Draco is cutting them a check, but at the trial everybody wants to find out he’s been working for Gringotts or something. Draco thinks that his mother should realize that people always choose money over pride, even omegas.
Does he smile at this? Is he supposed to laugh? “We attended the same school, didn’t we? We all discussed the Olympian spirits, right? Which one did you get on the quiz?”
Barnaby is sulking because he was supposed to go with Granger. Narcissa was a last minute and frankly unsettling arrival. The setting of the wild ocean, whipping ocean spray, and Draco shivering in a threadbare Azkaban robe also seem to add to a formidable ambiance.
have been since leaving the London prison.
Blaise looks at him oddly, “of course she visits me.”
“You.” Draco says in breathlessly. Breathlessly, goddamn it. “I see you.”
In the first stony silenced minute Lucius reaches out and slaps him across the face. “You’re letting them get to you.”
“What did I do to end up
“Anybody could do that,” Harry says, cocking his head to one side. “Isn’t a fantasy supposed to be something extraordinary?”
He throws Draco’s wrist back against his chest and grabs the back of his hair, throwing his face towards the ceiling. He waves his wand again, a complicated motion that Draco recognizes from caring for Celeste. Draco spares a moment to be surprised that Barnaby is capable of the flush.
an average omega could have overpowered an alpha drug lord and shot him!
Draco stops and stares at him, comprehension coming slowly. Soft waves on the beach.
"Just like Hogwarts, you couldn’t keep your hands to yourself, you couldn’t let anybody else be the center –”
Draco doesn’t believe that he murdered Dolohov in cold blood, but he’s a slight bit offended that Barnaby doesn’t think he has it in him. He also doesn’t relish the Wizengamot hearing about his pathetic withdrawal symptoms. Nobody in that lot wants to hear Barnaby's shit argument about Draco's lack of alpha attention being the reason for his criminal activity.
“Draco, go home. Heats are so arbitrary these days. You don’t need me.” She looks so pitying. “And I’m not going to bite you, Merlin. I don’t believe in that.”
“You don’t think Phul wants to meet you?” Potter asks, still smiling.
to avert his eyes. He’s never had a problem with alphas before, but this is somehow different. He doesn’t have anything to offer now except submissiveness.
It feels incredible though. Draco has never experienced it, except in class when it was taught, but he always feels calmed when he just imagines this hold. In this situation, if Draco had just been physically beaten, a touch like this would sooth his shattered nerves until they could sew themselves back up.
you.”
Draco has always been taught – in school because dynamic wasn’t something his family ever discussed – that omegas were special. The world’s magic has to be born from somewhere. It has to be generated by the connections between people and can be amplified by close relationships. Omegas are natural catalysts for power by carrying love and devotion in spades. An omega can intensify a mediocre wizard into the next phase of his capability. The old stories say that Merlin himself was a relatively weak wizard who relied on his children, all omegas, to amplify his power. A powerful alpha cannot sustain his own magic, they need something to fan it.
“Fine—I’ll go. You don’t’ need to entertain my stupid omega fantasies or mind games anymore, I’ll just go back—”
“Dueling space,” Harry Potter answers from behind him, walking into a door that Draco hadn’t seen before. “You don’t recognize it becau—”
“Violence then.” Potter’s face twists, like he’s smelled something bad. “Am I closer?”
“Well golly gee, Mr. Potter, you better get downtown immediately.” Draco rolls his eyes. He tries to pitch his voice higher, so that Harry can hear that he’s mocking him. “You might not have time to banish the pentagram, but you can still invite God into the circle.”
Harry is laughing, a full belly laugh that comes from deep within him. “Have you done it?”
Still standing like he has a metal rod in his spine, Potter doesn’t otherwise react.
Draco has had a repeated dream about Harry Potter for a long time. Before he saw him in the holding cell. Before he started hallucinating him. Draco has imagined him.
Draco doesn’t have anywhere to go, if he broke out of prison. Since Maleka, Blaise, and Astrid are three of the most tragically inept people perhaps on this Earth, Draco doesn’t feel they deserve to break out of prison either.
Everybody in the room looks relieved except Narcissa.
?” Draco asks sitting in the grass that doesn’t feel like grass. It feels scratchier, cheaper. It feels like he’s in a cheap imitation of his mother’s garden.
Draco can’t breathe very well. The feeling of panic always starts in his throat. He starts counting his fingers to make sure there are ten. Somehow, he counts twelve.
Through his tears, Draco rolls his eyes. He’s pouting. “I don’t care!” it sounds so petulant, so childish. “Every time I’m here we fight.” He finally looks down and makes eye contact, and Harry also looks shattered, as broken as Draco feels. “I don’t want to fight.”
had an omega wife that cared this much for his stupid, ugly ass. Draco doesn’t recognize this woman at all, so she couldn’t have been around during the war. A part of Draco that is entirely omega is screaming – why did that bastard choose her?
I'm back !
“The practice room for Dumbledore’s Army.” Draco supplies, easily. Potter raises his eyebrows. “I saw it once.” He doesn’t remind Harry that it was with Umbridge, but he can see that he knows already.
! Tap into the runes!”
Granger turns to him and rolls her eyes. “Have you been, or did he tell you about it?”
Despite how scintillating pushing dirt around the floor and staring at a blank wall is, Draco does expect one of these people to look up and say something to him.
The lawyers exchange looks with each other, each scrambling to make a comment about Draco’s insanity.
Harry is smiling. “I forgot you like this.” He shrugs. “You used to be so defensive about everything.” Draco rolls his shoulders back, ready to throw out an insult of his own, but Harry holds his hand. “I want you here. But not yet.”
Thank you so much for your comments and kudos!
"This isn’t a place for you to stay.”
“You are blinded by your nature.” Harry says and then winces at the look of hurt that inevitably flashes across Draco’s face. “I was too.”
If this happened before Draco remembers none of it. “Like the Grimoire or like the Daemonum?” Draco laughs. “Or like the Zohar?”
To Draco’s utter embarrassment, he feels the stupid tears threaten for what feels like the hundredth time recently. When he drops his eyes, he feels the first few start to fall, and he tries start talking, to make excuses for this, but his breath hitches. “Baby,” Harry says bringing his hands up to brush his tears away, the same classic alpha/omega transfer Draco was just lusting after. But Harry takes it once step further- he leans in and breathes in the scent just behind Draco’s ear, at his pulse, and kisses him a few times there, before whispering in his ear. “My baby-- don’t cry. Shhhhh. Don’t cry.”
His face softens around the edges, like Draco has said something impossibly sweet. He raises his hands, altogether more enticing because of the imagined height difference, and he runs the palms over Draco’s cheeks. It feels like coming home.
“Yes.” Draco answers quickly. He counts nine fingers.
. Draco isn’t hurt at all, the only wound he has is the old cut down his face from muggle prison, but he's been watched closely since.
Once, maybe two years ago, Draco had gotten off one of those planes somewhere in the Balkans and followed a shadowy man into a secluded wood. The muggle police had apparently discovered a stash of Dolohov’s horrible drugs and the only solution was to burn a lab. As soon as the torch touched that gasoline, the fire quickly followed the path of black liquid from right next to Draco’s feet the whole way into the little shack. It started slow and then exploded, all at once. There was an anticipation to that, a kind of drama that Draco wasn’t used to. He dreams about it sometimes.
to Draco, per se, but people in the real world always touch omegas, even ones as tetchy as he is. He is embarrassed to realize how much he’s been touched, even by strangers. He used to think he was shunned. Absurdly, he misses Pansy, even though she always lied to him. He misses the twins when they lived in Malfoy Manor. He misses Celeste.
“We’re trying to build a runes circle,” he says.
“Objection!” Barnaby says, finally. “He’s badgering my client!”
“You’re the one dating Pansy?” Draco asks quickly. He can’t stop himself. Even as it comes out of his mouth, he knows he’s going to pay for it brutally. Pansy has been his only real alpha in five years and if his body and magic realize she’s fully with Blaise, a person Draco is forced to live with now, he can kiss his remaining sanity goodbye. He can already feel his magic rising in his throat and threatening to choke him.
Has Astrid really been screaming about his being detruit for five hours?
you didn’t bail him out before this.”
It’s shocking. Is he changing the future by saying the wrong thing? Is he supposed to know what he said two bloody years ago?
Granger herself is raising one eyebrow at him. “Mr. Malfoy is talking about a new program we are implementing in the new wing. Therapy. For omegas.”
I kept feeling like everything I was writing was deteriorating in quality but I'm sort of happy with this. I'll start working on chap4 so hopefully it won't be another 4 months :)
Potter says, grabbing for his hand. “Don’t – when you wake up. Come find me.”
His omega would know that Draco wasn’t truly being cherished as he desperately desires, but the bite would help him. It would, very possibly, stop him from permanent impotence and the explosion of his omega magic. Draco is desperate.
Draco goes to Azkaban in the next week because he was already planning on it. His mother and himself are allowed three visits with Lucius every six months. As always, Lucius looks wan and sick upon arrival and his mother withholds every type of affection, even though they are perfectly allowed to touch. After a short discussion about Draco’s latest career accomplishments (notably, murdering an alpha drug dealer with a muggle gun), his mother strides out of the cell and leaves Draco to his own devices. The strangest part is, still, that she doesn’t touch either of them. The guards always look alarmed, which spawns an awkward moment where Lucius and Draco stare at each other. Draco knows that it is the bone-crushing loneliness he doesn’t usually see surface.
Granger cocks her head to the side, slowly starting to row the boat again. “I am aware that you mentioned it during holding.” Apparently, Draco mentioned it during holding. “But that’s not where you speak to him, is it?”
“I’ll ride back with you, Malfoy. I’ll explain the opportunity to you…more thoroughly.”
“What does it have to do with omegas?”
Astrid looks up slowly, for shock value. Draco is only a little bit appalled by her black eyes. They are a signature in the Yaxley family, and they are as upsetting as the legend. He doesn’t flinch at her disgusting gaze, as he’d be much more alarmed if she’d had her mother’s face.
The mere force of the water is not the genius of the flush. Draco’s own magic submerges him, holds him down, and waits for Draco’s body to panic. It’s the intensity that causes his magic to quickly fight for survival, a response to imminent death.
It’s getting worse.
It’s very difficult for Draco not to ask his father up front if he is broken. Omegas hold a vat of untapped power. They can be a conduit to
“Sorry.” Potter whispers, his breath tickling the sides of Draco’s ear. “I’m – I’m sorry about everything.”
“You aren’t really listening to me.” Lucius says, which is apparently all anybody can say to Draco these days. “I had hoped the more that they beat you the more you would fight back.”
“We are an obvious person!”  Phantom Draco begins to pace “I
and it is dying for attention. He’ll stay for a few hours and drown in her easy companionship, and even that will help a little. “If I die in prison it’s on you.” He does mean for this to be a joke.
For a minute, Draco is sad to see Granger look so disappointed.
Draco does seem to get some sympathy, particularly from stupid Barnaby. He doesn't stop the proceedings though.
The High Inquisitor holds out her hand to stop Dolohov’s mad-dog lawyer. Draco feels attacked from all sides. “Mr. Malfoy, how did you get into this line of work?”
Once, Draco witnessed a couple on the street near Diagon Alley. This was before the war, so it had to be over fifteen years ago. As they were walking, an acquaintance stopped them and gave the omega a hug, followed by the placement of their hands on the omega’s cheeks. This is the most common initiation for the passing of magic. It happened so easily, so casually, that Draco had always assumed that would happen to him one day.
“I don’t care!” Draco says desperately. “I don’t need to know!”
“Draco,” Barnaby, the Malfoy’s long-suffering lawyer, says to get his attention. Draco is staring at his hands and refuses to meet Barnaby’s eyes. “
“I tried to give you a child,” Pansy says, out of nowhere, but following Draco's train of thought. Draco nods, always having thought that was her plan. Pansy is – as most people are – a beta. She’s a friend that Draco hasn’t seen very often, but he does have a final few shreds of self-preservation. He still has enough will to live to ask the horrifying, embarrassing question he needs to ask.
“But I'm barren.” He knows this is the reason he doesn’t have a child. In the beginning, he’d tried to impregnate muggles, witches, and any other type of creatures to starve off the loneliness and his eventual decline into insanity. It's caught up to him anyway.
Bonding bites can only be given during an omega’s heat. They are a permanent mark of ownership. In Draco’s research, it would bind his magic to Pansy’s so that she could tap into it at any time. For Draco, the bite would serve as a reminder that he belongs to somebody. It would be visible, so he wouldn’t be threatened in prison. It would be a tacit reminder, so hopefully Draco could power through withdrawal. This is, in Draco’s inexpert opinion, the reason his father has not become detruit.
He's just been overreacting, he'll get this over with in a jiffy. Hell, maybe even tonight.
Finally halting the vigorous movement of his hand, Draco huffs out a breath that displaces a lock of hair falling on his forehead and throws his head back lightly, letting out a sigh.
"It's just that–ugh, I don't even know how to begin."
Draco laughed, the melodic sound washing over Harry in waves and leaving him refreshed.
"You're a bright boy, Draco. Don't let others tell you di-"
"The music has begun and it would be rather unsightly for us to just leave the dance floor," Harry whispered in hushed tones, "As much as you may detest me, I implore you resist the urge to storm off as we do this." Harry scooped up Draco by the waist and hand, gliding across the floor in unison with the other dance partners. The music had flooded the room and Draco couldn't break eye contact with Harry. Resentment and anger bubbled up underneath as the two of them were pulled together, chest to chest. Draco searched Harry's eyes and found once again an emotion he could not put his finger on. The dancing had caused the two of them to pant, hot breath hitting each other's faces. Draco found his heart racing in a way it hadn't been with Mr. Nott. His entire body trembled as Harry's hand rested lower on his hip. His confidence shriveled and once more, Draco found himself feeling like a naive child, shy and embarrassed. Harry's eyes were cooly watching him, showing no sign of fluster.
"Your mother is in town, doing the shopping." Lucius said calmly, "Are you alright, darling? You seem slightly...frazzled?"
"Harry James Potter, how are you?" He asked with a smile that didn't meet his eyes. He ignored Draco's confused and surprised expression, simply continuing with steely resolve to stare the werewolf down.
Harry nodded, coming closer to the boy and pulling out his wand from its harness. With a flick of the wrist, a paper appeared with Grimmauld Place's address, the ink fresh and still dripping. "Here," Harry said as she passed the paper to Draco, watching as the boy caressed the paper with his thumb for a second before folding it and shoving it in his back pocket. Harry nodded, "Well..alright then. I guess I'll..." He muttered
Molly retreats back inside and they’re left standing there alone. A tense silence hangs in the air between them and Harry shifts from foot to foot.
“Now I want some answers Draco. All this time and you’re just now showing up with divorce papers?”
“Starbucks,” Potter says with a grin, “I’m sad to say I might be a bit addicted to their caramel frappuccino’s.”
Suddenly, Draco wants nothing more than to be sitting in a dark theater with Potter.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t doubt it, but I’m guessing that’s not the only thing bothering you.” She’s suddenly serious, her eyes searching his face.
“Draco, gonna come,” Harry whimpers and Draco feels the first pulse hit his tongue.
When Harry’s nose brushes against the patch of blond curls at his groin and he swallows around Draco’s cock, his throat constricting tightly around the head, Draco arches off the bed so hard his back twinges. Draco cries out, begging and moaning shamelessly, not giving a single fuck about how needy and wrecked he probably looks. Desire burns in Harry’s eyes as he looks up, gaze locked on Draco, head still bobbing slowly. All the air evaporates from Draco’s lungs, leaving him gasping for breath.
“Yes, we can see that,” Hermione says slowly, her eyes flicking back and forth between them with a knowing look that Harry doesn’t like one bit.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco has never minded his situation. He goes out from time to time. Finds a fit bloke in a bar, maybe dances or has a quickie in the loo. It suits his needs. He’s never been interested in something serious.
, Potter gives in.
“Yeah, Potter. That sounds great,” Draco says, anticipation already threatening to overtake him.
Chapter 8 will be posted tomorrow :)
“Yeah,” Harry mumbles, pressing a kiss to Draco’s temple, “Course you can.”
Draco laughs, he cheeks flushing at the compliment. “You’re not too bad yourself Potter.”
They stand together, sharing ragged breaths and Harry presses soft kisses to Draco’s face. His eyelids, his nose, both cheeks, his forehead. And then Harry finally kisses his lips, his tongue slipping easily into Draco’s mouth.
Before Harry can formulate an answer, James appears in front of them bouncing on the balls of his feet.
“Hey, Malfoy.”
Thinking back it still makes Draco want to smile like a love-sick fool so he quickly cuts off that train of thought before he does or says something he’ll most definitely regret and instead focuses on trying to keep his knees from buckling.
Harry sees fire flash in Draco’s eyes and then he’s pulling almost all the way out before thrusting back in hard. Harry grabs for any part of Draco he can reach and pulls him down into a messy kiss.
. . .
“I know,” Malfoy soothes, his voice still raspy but comforting in a way that makes another whimper fall from Harry’s mouth.
Once in the kitchen, Draco scoops Scorpius up and sits him on the counter. Draco gets to work cutting up an apple, spreading creamy peanut butter on each slice. Scorpius shoves bite after bite into his mouth, having to be told numerous times to slow down.
“Stay,” Draco says impulsively. Harry gives him a questioning look so he clarifies, “The night. We don’t have to—I mean nothing else has to happen but I, I’ve missed you.”
“Hey!” Harry says, offended on behalf of his new pet.
Draco just laughs and accepts the plate that’s piled high with Molly’s delicious food. He’s just opening his mouth to speak when her eyes light up at something, or someone rather, behind him.
The words of protest die on his tongue, a strangled noise escaping him as his mouth drops open in shock. Kade is down on one knee holding out a platinum ring, the inlay of diamonds and alexandrite gemstones gleaming in the moonlight.
Harry’s mind is racing and his stomach flips as he thinks about what just happened. He’s paying little attention to where he’s actually going but that’s alright. Harry has walked this path through the castle many times since the war and he reckons he could probably do so blindfolded at this point.
“And you think you could be one?” Draco asks snidely. The days where he sat back and took his fathers shit long over.
The box is small but surprisingly heavy. Inside rests a glass figurine--a dragon. Draco lifts it out carefully, watching the way the greens and yellows shimmer as he twists it this way and that. There’s a note with it that simply reads: I miss you. And Draco grabs the countertop to stop himself from Apparating straight to Harry’s and falling into his arms, telling him—
Draco shakes his head and against his better judgement scratches out an affirmative reply, smiling as he adds his own post script. He ties the note to Orions leg, stroking the birds head once more, before opening the window and watching the owl fly away.
“Well, wow. That’s wonderful Hermione,” Draco’s a bit shocked at how much has changed. When Draco left, Hermione hadn’t even picked her specialty yet, Ron and George’s business was just starting to take off in the post war economy, and Rose, of course, wasn’t even thought of. Draco’s proud of his friends success but as happy as he is for them, he can’t help feeling left out. He’s missed so much.
The kiss that follows is coppery and wet. A desperate thing that has the ability to make Draco feel as though he’s breaking into a million pieces.
“Hullo Molly,” Draco says with a nervous smile.
“The Ferris wheel,” Harry replies with a grin.
Draco thinks that he’s quite happy with the way things are too.
Harry, there in the shower with him, standing flush against his back, and it’s his hand—bigger and rougher than Draco’s own—that’s pulls at his cock now. Harry’s mouth moves across the back of Draco’s neck, pressing soft kisses and gentle nips of teeth there, while his other hand drifts down to the cleft of Draco’s arse. His fingers rub teasingly, before two are shoved inside without warning. Draco whines quietly, the hand speeds up. Then he hears those words again, whispered in Harry’s hoarse voice--
Draco floos to Andromeda’s a few hours later, still feeling unsteady, like one wrong move will have everything crashing down around him. But then Teddy greets him with a happy squeal and a smile. He walks to Draco as fast as his short, stumbling legs will carry him, and something settles inside Draco’s chest.
“Draco,” Astoria starts, stepping closer to him, reaching out a hand that promises comfort.
“Er. Well, no. I was about to right before you showed up!” Harry quickly lies but it’s no use. Hermione has always been able to see right through his bullshit.
“I told you before, I trust your judgement. If you see enough good in him that you went and fell in love with the git, then he must not be all bad.”  Ron smiles at him a little sadly then. “I saw the paper yesterday. Can’t say I was surprised when you showed up last night.”
“No need to hold back. I want to hear you,” Draco says, his grin turning to a smirk when a loud moan escapes Harry’s open mouth, “There’s been permanent silencing charms on my bedroom since you started sleeping over.”
Harry’s heart feels like it’s rising higher, getting stuck somewhere in his throat. “I want you to fuck me,” he says, stopping to add lube and another finger.
Outwardly Draco nods, while internally his panic spirals out of control. What are they going to talk about? The long list of topics they can’t discuss, leave little that they could safely converse about. Are they going to a Muggle coffee shop? Surely Potter won’t want to be seen in public with him where someone might recognize them. And what’s the point of this anyway? Is this when Potter politely tells Draco that they can’t be friends? Is that what’s happening?
Of course Draco knows Potter used to watch him. The man practically stalked him for the entirety of sixth year. He just didn’t realize that Potter would remember these little meaningless things about him a decade later. Draco decides the fact that he remembers a lot of tiny details about Potter also, is entirely irrelevant.
“Harry Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World and Dark Lord Vanquisher. Of course people expected it,” Malfoy says with a laugh, “But I was always under the impression that you enjoyed it?”
Harry already has the movie ready to go and presses play before lifting his first slice to his mouth. He skips through the advertisements and a smile creeps onto his face as the opening credits begin, Al and James already rocking back and forth to the beginning of the first song.
Draco stares at the post script, rereading the words, trying to get them to make sense. The wards and the Floo are
Phantom Draco scoffs. He waves his hand until the cells is replaced with a meadow. Somehow, it’s the same meadow Draco saw in prison, but noticeably upgraded. It smells like real honeydew now, no faint trace of paint like it was designed for a theatre production. “Sorry-- Azkaban was depressing me.”
“The dementors won’t bother you.” Narcissa spits. “You can sit here in peace. You won’t be forced into anything else now that you don’t have enough magic.”
Potter looks furious. His spine pokers up and his eyes flame. Draco has been begging for this reaction from Potter since he was eleven. It feels like coming home.
She holds up her hand in a gesture to stop him talking. For some reason, he does. “Harry has reported that your power is stifling.”
After a while, the magic starts to burn when it’s forced from him and the tsunami becomes weaker. It doesn’t pound over him in a block but falls like a heavy rain. It doesn’t suffocate anymore, it just pours.
Harry throws his head back and laughs. “You know it.” He says, grinning so wide that his eyes crinkle at the corners. “You know damn well it’s not heating and cooling spells.”
Lucius is telling him about the experiments that they will start on him. Draco is sure of it. There have always been rumors about Azkaban-
But he’s not sitting on the bed. He’s... sitting on the floor? Potter squats and grabs the back of Draco’s hair and pulls his face up, so that they are staring in each other's eyes. “How did you know that story?”
When he flops across his cot and turns his back to Draco, something inside himself snaps. Things move so quickly. It’s like Draco is watching from outside of his body. Draco stands, waltzes over to Potter like he’s sleepwalking, and pushes his shoulder back to face him.
Typically, just when Draco expects to be the center of attention, nobody pays him any mind. Even though they’re not looking at him, Draco would recognize Blaise Zabini’s coffee colored skin anywhere. But it’s not him Draco is anxious about. The two girls that are playing some kind of game with dirt on the floor are much more nerve-wracking. Their mother died in his house a year before the war really started. Draco hasn’t spoken to Astrid nor Maleka Yaxley since.
Draco shrugs. He can feel his face scrunching up, making for more tears. Even in dreamland, he can feel his magic crying out for Harry, begging him to be closer. “Call me that again.”
How the hell long have these people been in a cell together?
“This is a pretty sad fantasy,” Harry says, his voice so casual and honey-sweet, it doesn’t startle Draco. Of course, Harry’s been here the whole time. Instead of merely dreaming of this moment (again) in his cell, Draco is literally rewatching it somewhere, as if in a pensieve.
When Draco sits up, he’s not excited to see Harry Potter staring back at him.
“Wait – Stay here!” Potter hisses. “Just—don’t think about the logistics of it. You don’t want to go back there either.”
And then, just like Draco knows it will, his magic pushes out from his skin to deflect the water. This amount of magical energy should be impossible, which is probably why the world rejects omegas in the first place.
“We were doing stealth exercises,” Ron nods and makes a go-on gesture, “He managed to trip over me while we were disillusioned and fire off a hex at the same time. Nearly singed my eyebrows off.”
They all sip their tea in silence for a moment, and then Harry is asking after Teddy. Andromeda lights up as she talks about her grandson and Draco is happy that the boy seems to have so many people who love him in his life.
“Oh, god,” Draco whimpers, arching up, his cock dragging against Harry’s stomach, “Fuck me, please.”
“Sweet Salazar. Astoria and I have never slept together, Potter, which is what I assume you’re asking. You do realize there are other means of conceiving a child, yes?”
Just as she opens her mouth to reply, the young waitress approaches the table and asks Hermione what she would like. She orders a cup of Earl Grey with lemon on the side and Draco smiles, glad that some things haven’t changed.
“Looks like he’s occupied at the moment.” Harry’s jaw tenses, teeth grinding together as he watches Draco lay a hand on Nott’s shoulder. He can feel Ron searching his face, so he drops his eyes to the table.
A whine escapes Draco’s throat and he moves his hands from where they’ve made their way into Potter’s hair, sliding them down to grip his shoulders.
Draco swaps their positions in a seeker fast movement, spinning them and backing Harry up against the wall. Draco crowds in, lips still moving against Harry’s, and slouches down a bit to line up their bodies.
Malfoy blows an irritated breath out through his nose. “Yes, Potter, I can see that. What I meant, was why did this arrive with that menace of an owl and interrupt my dinner?”
Draco just stares at him for a moment before throwing his arms up in exasperation. He walks over to the rail of the observation deck and can’t deny that it’s a breathtaking view. The city is a twinkling sea of lights; colorful, vibrant, and honestly just astounding when you take a moment to appreciate it. The moon, almost full overhead, makes it even more beautiful. Still, Draco has no idea why they’re here. Then again, unplanned stops to admire something such as a sunset or freshly fallen snow on the trees, is not an uncommon occurrence when one is dating a photographer.
Morning sex, followed by a shared shower—which led to yet more sex—and then breakfast; just to name a few. Not that Draco’s making a list, because he’s not. But if he were, the pancakes would be at the top.
Many hours later, when the sun is starting to set and they’ve all been stuffed full of desserts, Draco wanders outside to enjoy a minute of fresh air and silence.
It’s a scary thing—love. The most powerful magic of them all. It has the ability to make you forsake all logic and rational thought. It can break down all your walls, strip every ounce of your composure away and make you lose control.
“Somewhere like Ireland?” Harry asks, because he wants to make sure he understands what Draco’s saying, “You want to move to Ireland with me? You’re serious?”
He goes limp, eyes drifting shut once more. Harry presses soft kisses against his face, his voice warm and brimming with praise as he whispers words that Draco can’t quite comprehend.
. . .
“Draco,” Harry says calmly, taking another cautious step closer. They’re only a few feet apart now. Close enough that Harry could reach out and touch, but he won’t. Not yet, “Just listen, please. I have to tell you something and I want to make sure you understand. And then I’ll leave, if that’s what you really want.”
Harry’s leaning against the countertop, his knuckles nearly white from how tightly he’s gripping the edge.
Potter doesn’t ask what’s wrong. He doesn’t tell Draco that everything will be okay, doesn’t bother with meaningless sentiments. He just hugs back tighter and whispers the same words over and over again.
“Obviously,” Ginny says with a laugh, squinting an eye to inspect one of the half empty beer bottles that litter the table, before picking it up and downing its contents. Draco internally cringes—she doesn’t even know whose that was!
Malfoy stumbles over to them a few minutes later, shoving a glass of wine into Harry’s hand and perching on the arm of his chair.
Harry finally, reluctantly, pulls away and leads Draco over to where his gift is waiting.
Draco’s mouth drops open.
“Get the fuck off me, you oaf,” Draco snaps, pushing up on weak arms and dislodging Potter.
Harry glances out at the darkening sky and sighs. He says his goodbyes and makes promises to return, before leaving the castle grounds to Apparate home.
Harry looks equally affected and only gives a shaky nod in response. He brings their lips together again as he lines his cock up and breaches Draco’s willing body. Draco lets the feeling of being stretched wide around Harry’s cock overwhelm him, finally floating away completely as the world narrows down to just the two of them.
Harry smiles, pretty sure there’s a compliment in there somewhere.
Astoria reaches over and takes his hand, squeezing it hard, “You’re his chance at happiness Harry. And he deserves it, whether he thinks so or not.”
kudos and comments make my day <3
He stands up, knocking the chair over and not bothering to right it. He ignores his mother and Astoria’s concerned looks and walks to the hall closet, gathering his shoes. He pockets his wand, runs a hand through his hair to smooth it down.
The adrenaline that’s still pumping through Draco’s body is intoxicating and he can’t wait to get Harry home and on a flat surface. He’s very close to just jumping him where they sit.
Draco whines at the praise, then licks his lips and starts to move, raising up and dropping back down on Harry’s cock. He throws his head back, mouth hanging open as he works up a rhythm that has his cock slapping against his stomach and leaving a sticky trail behind. “Can’t—gonna, fuck, fuck,
Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are friends. It seems unbelievable to Harry, that the boy he used to hate is now an important person in his life, someone he misses when they’re apart, someone he trusts, someone whose opinion he values, someone he cares about.
Harry doesn’t pause to give Draco time to adjust, just pulls back out until only the head of his cock remains inside, and then he’s thrusting forward, again and again. Draco’s nails dig into Harry’s back, and Harry just clutches him closer, gripping Draco’s thighs hard enough to bruise. It feels like Harry is trying to crawl into Draco’s skin, his hands and mouth never breaking the contact as he keeps pounding into Draco.
“Yes, Harry, please,” Draco moans. So Harry goes a little rougher, faster, loses his tightly held control.
“Don’t, it’s fine,” Draco says in a surprisingly steady voice as he shakes off the hand on his shoulder, “I need a drink.”
. . .
“Hate you too,” Draco replies, equally venomous.
Draco sags forward, forcing Harry to take his weight as he struggles to catch his breath, sucking in air as thick as treacle.
Draco doesn’t really become aware again until they’re flooing back to Harry’s flat.
Malfoy and Blaise start arguing, almost instantly, over the proper way to ingest Gillyweed, which amuses Harry to no end. He sips his wine and watches as the others join the debate, Malfoy eventually getting so riled up that he climbs onto the sofa to wave his arms around dramatically. The scene is made all the more funny by the fact that someone has managed to get a bright pink
“God you smell good,” Harry murmurs against Draco’s skin.
And that’s how Draco ends up standing on the stoop of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, wearing borrowed jeans and a soft, long sleeved shirt that smells like Harry.
Harry sits in the chair beside Draco and rests a hand on his thigh. Draco’s hair is hanging loose around his face, ripped free from the hair tie by Harry’s hands. His lips are pink and swollen from Harry’s teeth and there’s a purpling bruise on his neck, just under his sharp jaw.
“Yeah, me too. Draco, baby fuck,” Harry growls, finally releasing his hold to gather Draco closer, fucking up to meet Draco’s thrusts and hitting his prostate every time. Draco winds his hands around Harry’s neck, his cock rubbing against Harry’s stomach, and the friction is enough to push Draco over the edge. He comes hard with a curse and Harry’s name on his lips.
An emotion Draco can’t quite put a name to starts to build in his chest. Harry hasn’t moved on. He hasn’t given up on Draco.
“You did,” Hermione says, brushing a kiss against his cheek, “Ron and I are happy for you.”
His hand shakes as he reaches out to trace Draco’s lips, memorizing the shape of them. Then, he forces two fingers inside, resting them on Draco’s tongue. Draco moans, sucking his fingers and coating them with saliva. Once they’re nice and wet, Harry pulls away, keeping his eyes locked on Draco’s as he reaches behind himself and slips one inside.
“Oh. I told you, you didn’t have to bring anything,” Harry says, accepting the cup.
His hotel actually isn’t far from the Leaky Cauldron though and Draco can’t stop himself from shooting paranoid glances over his shoulder. The last thing he needs is for someone else to tell Harry he’s back. No, it will be better coming from him and he also can’t deny that he wants the element of surprise on his side to give him the upper hand.
“Mate, maybe Hermione’s right. You’re not happy, maybe you should think about—“
Harry doesn’t release his hold on Draco, instead bringing their arms back and whacking the ball, sending it through the spinning blades of the little windmill and right into the hole on the other side.
Waking up in Harry’s arms isn’t something Draco ever thought he would experience again, but now that he is, he can’t imagine waking up any other way.
“Well you can have them all. I’m going to go and start breakfast,” Harry replies, untangling himself from the fluffy duvet and tucking it securely around Draco’s half asleep form, “Any requests?”
Still, he’s made a reservation at a Muggle hotel and he thinks it was a good decision. It isn’t as if he can just walk into the Leaky and get a room without fielding a thousand questions, not to mention the fact that his return to England would be all through Diagon by the end of the day.
But tonight the desire to look nice has taken hold of him.
Draco cries out as Potter bobs back up, licking at the precome beaded at the tip, before swallowing him down again and again.
“Hands above your head,” Draco says, smiling at the full body shudder his words cause, “You’re going to lay back and just enjoy.”
Draco scoffs and shakes his head.
Harry mumbles something back, not even sure if it’s actual words, his brain still not fully functioning yet.
Draco pushes it until the last second, finally starting his way down the long staircase after exactly five minutes and his breath hitches when his eyes land on Harry. He looks edible, the grey shirt he’s wearing clings unfairly to his chest and arms, tapering down to his slim waist. The jeans are tight, tucked into black boots, and Draco can imagine what his arse looks like in them.
(See the end of the chapter for
,” Harry says fiercely, his thumb caressing Draco’s cheekbone, catching the tears that have started to fall.
But Harry knows he’s going do it anyways.
Draco leans back and braces himself on his hands as Potter gets back to it. It feels like hours, Potter working him open with only his tongue. Potter’s mouth is incredible, warm and wet and devastatingly good.
But he wants more—needs it. The achy knot in his stomach is getting heavier and heavier, and Harry knows what will bring him relief.
It feels obscene, filthy, to be on display like this while Potter still sits there mostly clothed. But Draco stops worrying about that when he feels Potter’s tongue lick a broad stroke over his arsehole.
“Yeah. Yeah, I did,” Harry answers before he leans forward and covers Draco’s lips with his own.
“I don’t care!” Draco had yelled, immediately regretting it when his mother jumped. He continued, more quietly, “I am doing as you both asked, putting my own wants aside.” The words came out choked, broken. “She’s family. She’s coming to the wedding.”
“It’s Draco. He showed up at my door this afternoon,” Harry says in a rush, keeping his eyes fixed on a spot below the frame, “He wants me to sign the divorce papers.”
“It’s a birthday card for my dad,” Scorpius answers, proudly showing off his creation.
Draco lets out the breath he was holding and nods. Before he can speak, Harry is addressing Hermione, his tone pleading. “Can you please get ahold of Narcissa and tell her we’ll be there soon?”
Harry follows the elf out of the room and down the long hallway, ignoring the whispers of the many portraits that line the walls.
“Oh, fuck off,” Malfoy replies, before he picks up the cookie and takes a vicious bite, “I hate this holiday.”
Draco lets his eyes drift around the room, taking in the details he missed yesterday. Everything Draco left behind is there.
His parents aren’t naive. They always knew that Draco wasn’t interested in women. It wasn’t discussed often but when he turned fifteen his father had sat him down and told him, plain and simple, that he would be expected to marry a nice pureblood witch and continue the Malfoy line. If he wanted to have dalliances on the side, fine, as long as he was discreet.
. . .
“You’re welcome. Now I’m going down to put on the kettle and I’ll make some toast. You,” she looks at him pointedly, “go shower and get dressed.”
“Malfoy’s back!” Ronald Weasley exclaims when he finally walks up, “I’m reconsidering my opinion of your boyfriend, mate. He brought us shots.”
This...choking thing, is still new. Harry hasn’t quite been able to wrap his mind around why he likes it so much. Or why Malfoy does too.
“Not enough for me,” Harry repeats in soft whisper, “How could you think that? Draco, you are
“Please what?” His teeth catch Draco’s earlobe and bite down hard.
“Yes,” Draco hisses, “That stupid owl of yours ruined my dinner again! I had things to do tonight, Potter, and instead I had to come over here and return this—what even is this?”
Draco’s eyes snap open and he nods, fast and jerky. “I’m good, so good. Keep going.”
“For what?”
Draco does not go over to have dinner with Potter.
Draco inhales sharply, fastening his eyes on Harry’s and just staring for several long seconds.
He stops in his tracks, looking over at one his best friends in the world and he
Harry’s trusting him not to go too far, too fast. The clothes should probably stay, and Draco should probably slow down. He should stop grinding their hips together like this. Should stop licking into Harry’s mouth, should stop running his hands through Harry’s hair, stop tugging at it roughly.
Kade Parker, an up and coming magical photographer, had been at a charity event the magazine covered last year. He immediately caught Draco’s eye, his camera hanging from his neck and his warm smile lighting up his face. They instantly hit it off, falling quickly into a relationship. And while Kade’s promising career, as well as his own, draws a lot of public attention from the Wizarding community, Draco found that he doesn’t really mind it. It’s nothing like the attention his relationship with Harry received. The main difference being, that here in New York, Draco isn’t looked down on as Death Eater filth. His intentions towards Kade are never questioned. They can walk down the street together without being harassed and Kade never has to save or defend Draco.
He has twenty minutes to get them out the door and at this rate they won’t be halfway done with their breakfast by then. And of course, there’s also the fact that it will probably take Harry nearly fifteen of those minutes to wrangle them back into the bathroom and get rid of all the stickiness. Harry doesn’t know why cleaning charms never seem to get rid of syrup but it’s an inconvenience to say the least.
“I left to protect myself too. I didn’t think I was enough for you, I thought you would resent me. So I walked away before you could,” Draco admits quietly.
,” Draco snaps, turning back to the worktable. His hands clench into fists, he can feel the soil under his fingernails.
Harry’s teasing him, toying with him and Draco loves it. All he can think is
“I think I need to hear you say it.”
“Wouldn’t it be more fun if we made a wager out of it.”
“I’m going to take Scorpius to visit my parents this weekend. I’ll make sure the wards are open to you before I leave. You come over to the Manor and tell him how you feel.
Harry is not making a big deal about the date. He’s not.
The conversation shifts into something lighter after that and Harry is equal parts relieved and disappointed. As much as he doesn't feel ready to share anything too personal with Malfoy yet, he also wants to learn more about him. There are so many questions rattling around inside his head and Harry hopes in time he’ll get the answers to them.
Harry is on time every morning for the rest of the week, which means he doesn’t run into Malfoy again. And that’s good, surely. Just because they’re both apparently capable of civil conversation doesn’t mean they have to over do it.
When he finally steps into the warmth of the greenhouse the skin on his face stings harshly, the difference in temperature almost shocking. Within a few minutes spent in the magically controlled climate, Draco quickly shrugs out of his extra layers, sweat already starting to gather across his forehead.
Although, that’s all mostly due to the fact that nobody here knows who Draco really is. He’s been using the surname Black since he first came to the States and his Dark Mark is mostly unrecognizable after being tattooed over. Now a fox, his Patronus, lays curled sleeping on his forearm. Above the sleeping fox he has a beautifully done night sky, showcasing the constellation that’s his namesake, continuing up onto his bicep.
Hermione told Harry that Draco’s Portkey was leaving tonight. Harry argued with himself all week, finally deciding that he can’t allow things between himself and Draco to stay this way. He has to make things right before Draco walks back out of his life.
As he watches the storm light up the sky, he wishes, just for a moment, that he’s looking out onto Grimmuald Place instead. It’s nothing new, really. Draco is no stranger to this feeling of homesickness. It’s been five years now since he left England and he still misses it terribly at times. But Draco has a great life here in New York. He’s made something of himself, something he’s proud of.
“Harry,” Hermione says with a disapproving frown, hooking her arm through his and slowing his stomping pace, “You know that getting upset like this is exactly what she wants, so just try to calm down. This will all blow over soon enough.”
He tumbles out into the drawing room seconds later, quickly straightening his clothes and dusting himself off. Before he even has a chance to glance around and get his bearings, Harry hears footsteps approaching from down the hall.
Harry pays Neville an obscene amount of Galleons, thanking him repeatedly for procuring the strange plant in time for Draco’s birthday and promises to visit at Hogwarts in the fall.
Misery loves company after all.
Draco is so tight and wet and warm, and Harry loses himself to it. Pushes in and in with rough snaps of his hips, greedily swallowing every whimper, every whine and moan of pleasure that leaves Draco’s kiss swollen lips.
“Excuse me? What the fuck do you mean you haven’t been an Auror for three years!” Draco exclaims shocked. He quickly crosses the room, coming to a stop only a foot from where Harry stands with his back turned.
Draco couldn't sleep that night. The moonlight streamed through his drawn curtains, filling the room with a white light that reflected off of each surface and into Draco's eyes. He couldn't sleep just as he couldn't stop his fingertips from tracing his lips softly, feeling the tingle within them as he remembered over and over how Harry Potter had taken him by the waist and kissed him. With a frustrated groan, Draco tossed and turned in his bed, his hair splayed around him and entangled in all different directions.
"Yeah, well, it's a good thing that my parents fucking died to ensure that bloody Voldemort will remain just a pile of dust," Harry growled under his breath, attempting to keep his calm and cool.
"If only for the night-" Ron's Adam's apple bobbed as he gulped.
Draco wakes up with abrasive sunlight glinting off the dirty mirror of his cheap hostel room. He doesn't know exactly when he had fallen asleep last night, and as he turns over, he remembers the feeling of a large hand petting him, running through his platinum snowy hair. It was affectionate and warm, something that Draco would remember nowadays. Mr. NoName was gone and it was better that way. The wake up the next morning, the uncomfortable and silent dressing and departing. The man had left the money on the counter, and wasn't that lovely? Most men nowadays attempt to skip out on paying Draco if they can, but that's just the nature of men isn't it? Taking without anything in return? Draco's known a lot of men in his young 22 years of life and he's sure that they're all exactly the same: beasts with no morals.
"And rich"
The War had just ended and Harry found himself hopped up on a mix of adrenaline and utter loneliness. Ginny had just seemed to be the best choice and somewhere along the way, they had paired off. And it was good...for a while. At first, it had begun like any new relationship: words of endearment, constant letters back and forth, stolen kisses in the streets, and enough sex to last a man a life time. Ginny had always had a crush on him, Harry knows that. But as time marched on in it's steady pace, he's come to realize that she perhaps loved him for what she knows about him: The Chosen One, The Boy who Lived. It was easy to fall in love with someone that seemed larger than life itself and Ginny was more than happy to live in the grandeur of it all. But like all things, the War has come to an end and Harry is no longer the Golden Boy of Hogwarts. He's simply a man and Ginny found herself becoming less and less attracted to the Harry that was underneath that Golden plating. It was reasonable, Harry thought. After all, she hadn't asked to be in a relationship with an overly pessimistic and mostly bitter Harry Potter. But then was then and this was now and now Harry's found himself a shell of his former self. He's not sure if he still loved Ginny, perhaps a strong fondness, but fondness isn't love and Harry had been feeling fondness for the past year or so. So, when Ginny had revealed her plans to leave the country, Harry was ashamed to admit he was just a little relieved. She had said the distance would be good for them. You know what they say:
"Pretty little thing aren't ya?" Thomas purred into Draco's ear. Hands rubbing Draco's waist and hips, slowly digging and dipping down and into Draco's sweater. The sudden touch of cold hands made Draco flinch back.
Draco snapped his mouth shut, his eyes drifting down to the ground. The silence was uncomfortable, a thick tension wrapped around them and enveloped them in a state of limbo. Neither of them dared to bring up last night's events, as if voicing them would only reaffirm that it truly, actually happened. The silence was insufferable and Draco couldn't help but shiver as the sun took it's leave and the moon began to rise from its slumber. The wind picked up and howled, a chill running down Draco's spine.
"Draco, sit up at the table." Lucius firmly, but softly said and Draco righted himself. He continued to avoid eating, much to his parent's chagrin. But before dinner was over, he noticed the light tinny jingle of Lizzie's bell and from the corner of his eyes he saw her batting at the window. Perched on a tree branch outside was a beautiful white owl, peering inside the house. She had something in her beak, something that looked a lot like an envelope. The realization dawned on Draco suddenly and he couldn't help it as his lips curled into a smile.
"Of course I know that! I've drank before!" (If you counted the sips of wine and champagne his father and mother allowed him at dinner time). With a steely resolve, Draco braced himself and threw his head back, allowing a rush of bitter liquid to course down his throat. The fire whiskey made a hot way down to his stomach and sat there, warming it from the inside out. Draco pulled it away from his lips and grimaced, looking back at Potter who looked as if he were about to crack up in laughter.
"Well, If we had it your way, I'd be confined in your bed already, never to see the light of day again," Draco muttered sheepishly as Harry and him began to head back to the Manor.
"She's lovely," Draco said softly, only loud enough for Harry to hear, enrapt in the beauty of the portrait, "Don't you think?" Draco turned his head and found himself face-to-face with Harry. The man had once again been staring at him, intensely and deeply. His eyes met Draco's and the blonde had blushed deeply at the way Harry's pupils expanded. Harry quickly turned his head back to the painting, clearing his throat and fixing his tie.
Harry and Draco landed back abruptly, making Draco fall onto his ass with a "oof". Harry extended his hand out to lift the boy up, but Draco simply growled and stood up himself, disregarding the helping hand and brushing himself off instead.
"Oh?" Narcissa smugly smirked. "Just...a classmate?" She asked and Draco hissed out a 'mother!', which made the older woman chuckle at the sight of her flustered little boy. "Well, it's rather fetching. Must have cost a pretty penny, about… 200 galleons?"
Draco sighed and whined, "You know I can't say no when you beg like so, fine, I shall join you. But I cannot promise I will play nice with Mr. Potter, for I truly find no good qualities in the man except his overfilled pocketbook."
"Sounds splendid!" Hermione giggled, clapping her hands together. "Doesn't that sound wonderful, Draco?" She turned to Draco, taking his arm, realizing the gaze he held with Harry had still not yet broken. Draco was startled by the sudden action and turned to Hermione"
"Um...Kreacher.." Draco began, a nervous smile on his lips as he walked around the room, "Is-is this really
"I believe you know exactly of whom I speak. A certain Mr. Potter? Debonair businessman and dashing gentlemen?"
"A daddy's boy too huh?" Was the last thing Draco heard before his father apparated them away.
After about an hour, Draco and Hermione found themselves in a secluded area, away from the commotion of the party. They tittered away, making a note of the other guests and making fun of some of them. Hermione was pulled away by Ron and although Draco was happy for her, he felt slightly lonely now that his only friend at the party was occupied by another. Standing alone, Draco quietly sipped his champagne, watching the party unfold before him. A light tap on the shoulder alerted him. Draco turned around, only to be faced with the soldier from before.
"Come on, just play along for a second. Don't be a fucking git." Harry whined, nudging against Draco's waist with his socked foot.
Their heavy breathes fell onto each other's skin, their eyes never broke contact. Draco felt the heat of Harry's stare on him and like always it burned, burned him from his core and made his skin itch and crawl. The fading sunlight flooded the room and casted a shadow upon Draco's face, illuminating his sharp features and showing the sparkle in his eyes.  Draco watched as Harry's hand raised up from his side and found its way to Draco's cheek. With the lightest of touches, he brushed away a lock of icy blonde hair that had fallen. Draco couldn't help but slightly, ever so slightly lean into the touch-
"Do you have somewhere to go, Malfoy?" He asked frantically, his words dripping from his mouth like jumbled puzzle pieces. He didn't know how they came out or how they fit together, but they did and Harry wasn't able to stop himself from saying it.
Draco still has not spoken a word, too shocked to speak. He gulped softly as Harry pulled away, hand reaching up to straighten his coat and smooth back his hair. Draco felt his knees buckle, gripping the granite balusters for stability. He felt sick, he felt elated, he felt angry, he felt scared. Too many emotions to understand, so little time to do it in. Harry had walked away, disappearing into the masses of men and women, a mask lost amongst the other masks.
"I would rather die dirt poor than anything akin to your wife," Draco spat out, wriggling in Harry's grasp. "Your teasing will not get a rise from me, Mr. Potter. I assure you, I am not easily swayed."
Hermione smiled and nodded, taking Ron's arm and getting up from the table and up the stairs. Once again, Harry and Draco were alone. The silence between them was deafening and Harry wished, silently implored Draco to look up at him, to snap back at him with a witty and stinging retort. Draco remained silent.
"Well, it's quite a good thing you won't be my husband then." Draco mused, reaching out for the flask again and taking a smaller sip this time. He passed it back to Harry.
Hermione's cheeks grew into a pale blush as she attempted to bite back a smirk. "It's about time to recognize my excellence."
"To be some pureblood's stepford wife, I mean."
Draco quickly pulled back his fingers, cradling them in his chest as he whipped around and away from the painting. "I'm so so-" Draco turned pink in the cheeks as he was confronted with Harry, his arms folded and a quizzical raised eyebrow. Draco's sudden shock turned into annoyance. Harry cooly drifted from where he was, suddenly next to Draco and staring up at the painting as well. Draco's eyes shifted between Harry and the painting. The closeness was burning and Draco fought the urge to fidget in his spot. He turned his focus back to the painting, trying not to seem nervous. He took notice of the small details, the way her fingers curled around the spine of her book, the turn of her nose, the slope of her lips.
"Well, if you must know, the trip was quite long and tedious. I came in around 10 minutes ago, but I think I scared the valet when I flew in on BuckBeak. Next Christmas, darling, your parents are coming to us," Harry huffed as he stopped a servant with a tray of whiskey glasses filled with amber liquid. Harry took one sip and slightly cringed, only to down the rest of it. "Well that definitely tastes better than the stuff in my flask, but it still tastes like metal and rubbing alcohol. Who knew, fancy whiskey is just as shitty as regular cheap ones."
Draco's eyebrows furrowed. "You want me to..be your cleaning lady?"
Draco stopped dead in his tracks. With a growl that could only remind Harry of an angry kitten, he watched the blonde stomp towards him with fiery passion in his eyes and a scowl on his lips. Harry began backing up until his back was pressed against a wall and Draco was staring up at him, jaw clenched.
"Of course." Draco put the clip in his hair, the stones shining against the fine, silvery hair. "It's gorgeous. Thank you, Potter….Harry."
"What? Am I not allowed to converse with someone other than yourself?" Draco sneered. His grimace turned shy when he noticed the way Harry was staring at him. Although the man's face was obscured by a shiny black mask, Draco could see Harry's hazel eyes scanning him up and down, taking in his appearance. Harry's own cheeks turned slightly pink at the sight and Draco couldn't help but feel a buzz in his stomach, was it the alcohol?
Harry seemed to silence at that remark and Draco felt personally vindicated. He wanted to pat himself on the back for such a clever reply. Harry sighed, crossing his arms and taking in Draco's shaking body. He was only wearing a thin sweater, probably an attempt to make himself more appealing to Tom. Draco squirmed under Harry's gaze and in the dark, inky night, Draco could clearly make out his forest green eyes. Finally, Harry nudged his head to the side. "Come on, let's go inside before your Royal Arse freezes off." He pushes off of the wall that he was leaning against. Harry began to walk back inside without another word. Draco froze in place as he watched Harry walking cooly into the school, his wand drawn and glowing dimly at the tip to provide little lighted guidance. When Harry realized Draco wasn't following behind him, he turned his head back, "Are you coming or what?"
Harry hummed in consideration, peering down at the shiny silver canister. "Hard to explain."
"Hmm.. well cheers to that."
Draco swallowed his anger and held his tongue as he bowed his head down a little. "Hello Mr. Weasley, I must go now." Draco turned on his heel and scurried to his father at the entrance, holding Draco's books in one hand and the newly dubbed "Elizabeth" in the other. Before he could fully step on foot out the door, he could hear Ron and Harry chatting.
The brunette stuttered slightly, hands feeling heavy on Draco's petite waist. What was Draco talking about? Reputation? Fantasy? Harry's glasses began to fog up as Draco's hands began to stroke up Harry's neck softly. "It's 50 for a blow, double for a romp." Draco's gentle and sweet words felt like a stinging curse to Harry's ears and the brunette nearly flung him out of his arms at the proposition. Draco looked bewildered as Harry panted lightly, staring back at him like the blonde had grown a second head.
"He's a guest. Let him in." Harry cut her off quickly, his words becoming more frustrated and annoyed.
"Sorry princess, but your dormitory isn't exactly the prime example of cozy comfy living," Harry said as he finally fished out the object he was looking for. In this regard, Draco could say Harry was right. Although the color combinations of greens and silvers were Draco's favorite, he preferred them in a lighter setting, much like his own bedroom back home. While his bedroom was airy and light and reminiscent of the Roccoco French period, the Slytherin Common Rooms were simply dour, old and macabre.
Harry Potter. Of course it was.
"You did!"
"They can't hear you, it isn't like the photos or the newspapers here." Harry said as he sat up and walked over to Draco.
"Kreacher doesn't take orders from non-Black blood," the elf rasped out, his beady eyes narrowing at the man. An issue Harry had found early when he first was moving in: while Harry was Sirius Black's godchild, he technically was not of Black blood. Kreacher, a house elf of tradition and solemn family loyalty, found no reason to heed the requests of Harry Potter: a man of no familial blood. While he does begrudgingly follow some of Harry's orders, he does so in a slow and unorganized manner. Harry sighed, wondering if Hermione would be smug if she saw him groveling to request something of his house elf.
Nothing warms Harry's heart like the sight of a certain angel. Harry's not religious in the slightest, detesting the idea of it really, and yet he cannot help but believe that an ethereal being walks among them. Mr. Malfoy… Draco. He's nothing like Harry's ever seen before. Usually calm and stoic, Harry couldn't help but be embarrassed at his slight outburst at the night of the Masquerade. He doesn't know what came over him, but it must have been the Devil taunting him (once again, Harry Potter doesn't believe in the Devil). Draco Malfoy, cunning and sly fox, sweet and gentle doe, antagonizer of Harry's heart. And here Harry lies, in bed and staring up at his ceiling, reliving his aggressive confession over and over again in his head. It had been two nights since the party and Harry hadn't seen anything of Mr. Malfoy.
"Hey! Harry, where did you go?!" Ron came barging in the common room, shopping bags in hand and Hermione not far behind him. Harry and Draco pulled apart as quickly as possible, their faces as bright red as the Gryffindor red.
Harry simply hummed, "Muggles tend to enjoy drama. The more dramatic, the better," he stated, walking over towards the kitchen.
"She's barely wearing anything," Ron added under his breath.
A hand raised to cup Draco's cheek and it was as soft as snow, Harry noticed. Harry's thumb caressed the expanse of Draco's face, dragging down over his bottom lip, plump and pink. Draco's eyes were as wide as a startled doe, sweet and wonderfilled. Harry had frightened him, that much he knew. His feelings were scary, to say the least. Fingers trailing down to lift Draco's chin slightly, Harry sighed.
Draco and Harry have a moment or two
"Please, call me Ronald..or Ron, if you so wish."
The tea was cold and Draco knew it was time to leave. He sauntered down to the little bakery in Knockturn, selling ruffage and old bread, but the owner was sweet on Draco, and Draco wouldn't pass on free sweets. "Hello Dimitri," Draco purred as he entered the door, the brass bell above him jingling in the air. Dimitri Polavich was an older and rough man, with dark black facial hair and a stout, strong build. He had rough hands from back when he was in the military, back in Slovakia, and Draco shivered every time they caressed his skin. It was a funny thought, that such an abrasive man, owned a little bakery now.
"Oh?" Draco asked as he flipped through the pages of the book he had picked up, eyes not even lifting to meet his friend's face. "And are these men of any specific concern for me or…?"
So here Draco was, one year later and Draco finds himself seeking Thomas out when he's at his lowest, when the sadness is creeping up his throat and threatens to spill ink in his brain. Draco wrapped himself up in a wool sweater and parka, creeping outside the best he can. Thomas was already outside, standing cooly against the stone corridor wall.
"Can anyone tell me what you get when you mix golden holly and wormwood?" Snape's voice boomed through the room, bouncing off the walls and straight into the ears of his rather bored looking students. When he saw that no one else was answering, Draco's little pale hand shyly raised and caught the eye of his godfather.
"Wait," Harry shot his hand out to grab Draco's wrist. Draco's eyes shot down to the offending hand and then back to Harry's face. He looked...hurt. Pained...Desperate.
"Oh, don't you know how to make me sound like a cattle being sold," Draco snapped at his mother, hearing the rumble of soft laughter in his father's chest. The action made him feel warm inside, affection swimming through him. Lucius brought a gloved hand up to Draco's head and tousled his hair affectionately, making Draco whine in annoyance, trying desperately to smooth his hair back down.
"Hello there~" Draco cooed as the owl dropped the letter into his hands. He set down the envelope on his night stand, smiling down at the bird. "What a beautiful girl you are," he smiled, stroking her feathers lightly. The owl cooed happily, yellow eyes closing slowly and extending her neck out so Draco can scratch her there. "Perhaps I should also get an owl, for long distance communication." Draco hummed. Lizzie meowed from the bed and Draco sighed. "No offense, Lizzie. But we both have to admit, you're a bit of a diva when it comes to things like snow and rain."
And yet, he had dragged Draco out onto the veranda. He whipped him around, pinning him to the fence. Harry bared his teeth and snarled at the frightened little doll of a boy in front of him, speaking of angels and devils and bewitching smiles. Harry in that moment could envision himself marrying the boy. Draco in a white gown, Draco in his home, Draco carrying his children, Draco in his bed.
"W-what are we doing here?" Malfoy shivered, his blue parka suddenly not enough to keep away the cold front coming from the water. Harry seemed warm enough in his Gryffindor uniform, didn't feel the need to dress up for such an occasion.
"Let go of me!" Draco fought against him, but when he realized resistance was futile, he calmed down and let Harry grip him with unsure but steadfast intentions. "Yeah, yeah I live...nearby," he muttered, nodding his head back further into the street.
"Master Potter had insisted on these decor choices." The house elf groaned, a displeased turn of his wrinkled lips. "Kreacher told Master Potter that this room was not suitable for the son of Madame Narcissa Black, but Master Potter shooed Kreacher away."
"Are you telling me I'm not allowed to take a moment to myself? As if I'm the one who asked that disgusting man to drape himself upon me?" Draco huffed, crossing his arms.
"Oh? The gala was quite lovely, wasn't it? I do remember how beautiful Draco was. Oh! And how nicely he looked next to Mr. Potter. Do you know him? Draco had spent much of the night tucked into his side. It was quite dreamy wasn't it?"
"Merry Christmas, Malfoy." He muttered in usual unamused drawl.
"Oh, please.. let me introduce you-" Draco was suddenly cut off.
It was difficult to find Hermione in the masses, but eventually Draco was able to track her down. She wore a light pink dress, almost periwinkle in the shadows. Her mask was a lovely white and blue and reminded Draco of violets growing by his home. She was slightly breathless, she must have been dancing before or perhaps it was the warmth radiating from the multitude of bodies that were writhing against each other.
Draco glanced over his shoulder and noticed a boy staring back at him, brown wild hair and big green eyes. Glasses that sat awkwardly on his face and baggy clothes that don't exactly fit on his scrawny body. But he was cute. Draco could admit that. The boy was cute with the way he stared back at Draco, his floppy hair covering his eyes and the way he brushed it back to gaze longer at Draco. Draco's eyes scanned the boy, much like Lucius does when appraising a piece of art for the foyer or examining the outfits Narcissa dressed Draco in for their nightly dinners. As Draco waited by Lucius' side, his father chatting with the cashier who, upon seeing Lord Malfoy and his son, scurried to the back to get his things.
Harry instead was left alone, dread twisting his stomach into knots. Fuck, how could be forget about Ginny? She's been gone for a month now, investigating medicinal herbs in the south of Ireland and Harry had entirely forgotten. And now, Harry's found himself in a situation; the proverbial space between a rock and a hard place. Ginny was bound to notice a certain snowy haired brat in his home and was most likely going to be less than pleased. But then again, that wouldn't be new. Harry remembered the day she had announced her trip; it had been right after one of their more spiteful fights and she had thought throwing it in Harry's face would be better cannon fuel. If Harry was honest, he doesn't remember exactly when they started to become one of those couples: the type that stayed together for the sake of their friends and family. In the beginning, when everything was new and shiny and fresh, it was easy to fall in love.
Lonliness? Draco knows of it plenty.
"Ya know… our parents technically hated each other."
"Find someone else to do your slave work, Potter," he scoffed, turning on his heel and beginning to walk away. Harry watched as Draco began to get further away, his curled up body looking like something akin to an abandoned pet. Harry rolled his eyes and jogged up to the boy again.
"You've already seen him before! It's the same boy. Come on, just let us in alread-"
"Oh...uncle it's lovely." Draco sighed, holding the stone up to the light and admiring the reflections it caused.
"Now presenting, Sir Draco Malfoy." The attending announced. Draco's stormy grey eyes met wild hazel green.
"Ms. Granger has accompanied Mr. Weasley in the rose garden," Harry added as he followed along.
"HOW I'M DRESSED?" Draco exclaimed, "Now please! Please tell me how I'm dressed!" Draco was becoming pink in the face from the arguing, his blush running down from his cheeks, to his neck, to his chest and collarbones. His decalotage grew a lovely rose color. Mr. Potter's eyes scanned Draco's body and Draco noticed how his pupils seemed to blow slightly. The man cleared his throat and stood up straight, adjusting his necktie and suit. "I don't wish to discuss this all night. I'll be taking my leave now."
The two of them stood in the dark hallway, Harry stroking Draco's hair and Draco crying softly. The boy pulled his face up from Harry's chest and sniffled. "You're an asshole, Harry Potter. A right wanker." Draco's words came out harsh and weepy. Harry simply smiled, nodded and sighed. "I know I am, I'm sorry."
"Um...I'm not sure. What do you mean?" Draco asked sheepishly. It was an awkwardly intense question to ask someone you barely talk to; to ask someone who you barely knew. They weren't friends, Draco thought. He knew that Harry and him weren't the chummiest of pals that gabbed on well into the night. So Draco found himself staring back at Harry awkwardly, stuck in place and stuck in a place he knew he shouldn't be.
"You deem it women's work, but if you had ever actually gotten your hands dirty before, you'd know how tedious a task it could be." Draco spat out with as much venom and disdain as he could muster, not caring that Hermione was nudging him to stop talking.
"I assure you, Mr. Malfoy and I have less to discuss than you imagine." Harry finally spoke, ignoring the confused and angry glare from Draco who simply stated at him. "I walked Draco to his bedroom, and then retired to my own."
"And oops, there are no more empty rooms, they've all been freshly painted and therefore-"
Link to the painting btw! It's by French Roccoco artist Fragonard
"Well don't you two look lovely," Mr. Weasley smiled, sitting back down on the sofa. "As pretty as two pictures."
Draco's lips curled slightly as he placed his bookmarker back in between the pages. "I suppose so," he drawled. Harry instantly stuck out a hand for Draco to take, in order to help him off the ground. Draco took it without a word, allowing the man to bring him up to him, face to face. Draco began to dust himself off slightly, walking off before Harry and hoping to God that his cheeks weren't as hot and pink as they felt. Due to this, Draco couldn't see the small smirk that curled around Harry's lips and the fondness that began to creep onto his face.
Narcissa Malfoy was a lovely woman; a woman who enjoyed the finer accessories of life. A french native, Narcissa was fond of all things lace, gold, pearl, and glass. An upright woman, Narcissa walked with a graceful air, as if she floated upon clouds. Her head held high and a taste for luxury, she attempted to make her home, what was at first a dilapidated and broken farmhouse, into a cozy and loving environment for her newborn son, Draco. Draco had been the crown jewel of the Malfoy family. Doted on by both his parents, Draco had grown within a family of adoration and fondness. Although his mother sometimes smothered him, nitpicking and pushing little details, she wished to gift Draco with any luxury their small fortune could afford. His father, although not as overbearing, was just as affectionate, if not more. Draco had always found a special bond with his father that surpassed his bond with his mother. Lucius may not have been a rather emotional man, but often did Draco find a warm hand on his shoulder, or patting his back. Often did he find a warm chest to hug into when he absolutely needed one and often did Lucius', firm tone bring ease to his senses. His family was enough, more than enough for his tastes.
With a push of his heel off the boulder, Harry began walking away from the boy.
Draco's feet seemed to move by themselves as he trotted along behind Harry. He didn't exactly know where the brunette was taking him and he wasn't sure why he was following him anyways. The castle was eerily quiet in a way that Draco wasn't particularly fond of. The floors creaked and walls dripped and the whispers of ghosts and paintings buzzed in Draco's ears. It was a little unnerving, Draco could admit. Slytherin common room was in the dungeons of Hogwarts, so one would think he was used to the gloomy and morose surroundings, but if it were up to Draco he'd fashion it exactly the way his powder room looked back at home. It would definitely clash with the typical "down and dour slytherin" stereotype.
"What's your objection to Mr. Potter?! He's more than qualified, no?" Hermione whined, gripping onto Draco's arm. "Tall, dark, handsome, wealthy, intelligent, polite...I could go on."
"Oh come on, I've seen with my very eyes the longing stares he gives you, and you him. Hermione pulled away the material from Draco, forcing the boy to look towards her. "You're absolutely smitten!"
Ah, of course. Harry must be missing his parents. Draco had always assumed that Harry would have gone with the Weasleys or gone with Hermione to their homes for the holidays, but perhaps he doesn't. Perhaps instead he just stows away here in the Commons, nursing a flask of what smelled like fire whiskey. It was a sad thought, really. The idea that Harry simply sat alone in front of the fireplace during Christmas, waiting for his friends to return. Draco always went home for the holidays, his family threw a huge Christmas gala each year and Draco always adored any chance to dress up and be admired. But Harry didn't have anything like that, he didn't even have parents to go home to. The sudden revelation made it easier to understand why Harry would have such a thing hidden away.
Draco glanced upwards to find a man towering over him. He must have been at least his father's age, fat and sweating, beady eyes and a pig nose. He made Draco's entire body crawl and his wine tasted bitter. "U-um, No...no thank you," Draco attempted to give a small smile in decline. The man's face twisted into anger, "I don't see you with anyone else, what could possibly be the reason for your decline?" He spat out those words like venom from his tongue and it burned Draco's skin. "Sir, I don't want to dance with you, please leave," he scowled back, suddenly finding himself pressed against the wall, nowhere to go and being surrounded. Draco swallowed, but felt as if a rock was in his throat as a hand ran down his waist. Draco turned his head away from the labored and hot breath of the pig on top of him, bracing himself for whatever disgusting thing would occur.
"Ye-yes. Quite lovely, indeed." Harry's voice was gruff, as if he were holding his breath, as if he hadn't taken a single breath until this moment. Harry's voice was deep, as deep as the ocean and the thick forest just outside of Derbyshire. Draco suddenly realized he could get lost just by listening to Harry's voice. The thought made him anxious, suddenly aware that the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up and goosebumps erupted on his porcelain skin. Harry opened his mouth slightly to speak once more, but Draco had already fluttered off. He had needed to remove himself from Harry's side, lest he turn dark red and stammer over his words.
Harry smiled back, "Coming, darling."
Harry blinked once, twice, "Do I mean what?"
"Here, take the remote and try changing the channel." Harry handed the remote to Draco, watching as the blonde began clicking through the buttons with childlike amusement. Harry could stay there and watch Draco figure out the television all night, but the sudden ring of the grandfather clock on the wall made him flinch and join reality once more. He looked down at his watch and cursed, "I gotta go, Malfoy. I'm going to be late for work. I'll be done later in the night." He called back as he rushed towards the door. Draco gave no response back, simply too transfixed by his shiny new toy. Harry smiled, finding he didn't really mind.
