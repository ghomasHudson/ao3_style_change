"Ah, well," Harry says, scratching at the back of his hairline, "I feel like I could do better for a reunion than getting sauced and shouting at Seamus, before being Apparated to the moon, is all."
Instead they're trapped together inside possibly the tiniest proper room of a massive house, and Draco doesn't doubt Potter wishes just as fervently that he'd been sent an underling.
"Well, as ever, you're a pedant," Harry chuckles, and returns to tossing the salad with its dressing. "I dunno, it didn't feel quite like that to me. Besides, you're loads more nervous than I am."
why you're changing it. Not because I'm right," she says, with the smile of a spider eyeing a hapless fly.
"Oh, sod off," Draco mutters, attributing the flush he can feel on his face to the general heat of the kitchen. He does as he was silently asked and goes to set the table.
"You're ruining my holiday!" Harry cries.
"I don't suppose you're planning on wearing that thing underneath your suit," Draco says, eyeing the offending shirt.
"What are you going on about?" Harry pleads, confusion and desperation blending together on his face, but Draco won't be tricked again.
Looking at this design, Draco feels an elation that the dragon suit never gave him. This is a thing of beauty. Moreover, it's personal to Potter, so much more intentionally so than adding dragon ridges before remembering Norbert the dragon. And even more than that—
"So I'll Side-Along you."
won't do, and he pins with fastidious precision.
"Tell me what you do for work," Harry says, forcing down another gulp of lager.
He's met with the sound of Harry's cup scraping the saucer as he turns it again.
"What do you mean, can't go anywhere? You're right here."
"It's incredible," Potter murmurs, putting an almost reverent hand to the artwork. "The deer all move?"
"Harry, have you ever made shakshuka?"
For a moment, Harry is just taking in the sheer breadth of the expanded garden, and it doesn't hurt; Harry left long before it got this big. Draco can pretend Harry is just surprised to come home to a garden the size of an Olympic pool.
"I mean—" Malfoy seems to frown at his own nose, blinking so fast Harry worries, for a moment, that something's wrong physically. "My god, Potter, I'm only joking. No need for your gay panic." He takes a sharp turn of his heel and marches off, his whole body stiff with offense.
"We're just going to comb through your story," Potter says, "see it we can't pick out any new details."
"Civil of me. Reasonable of me. Hardly generous. Just because I don't call you by your father's name doesn't mean I'm ready to pin awards to your robes." Williamson seems to chuckle at his own little joke.
"And then? What comes after that?" Draco hates the question even before he's finished saying it, knows there are very few answers he'll like, but he knows he has to ask it.
"Thanks, Healer Goyle," Draco drawls, and pulls himself back up with a wince.
Today, as Draco arrives after his appointment with Dr. Fiddlewood—he'd had his tardy arrival cleared beforehand for a "medical appointment," and Potter declined to ask for further details given he wasn't allowed to—Potter is sweeping toward him already. "There you are," he says. Draco wonders if he's forgotten the permission he himself had granted. "You're needed in interrogation."
"What if I told you I'd made little trifles and put them in the fridge before you got here?"
"I wasn't—"
it?" He gets no answer as Pansy heads back to her station, giving the dressform sporting the Minchin job a thoughtful spin.
The same unseen force of Griselda's wandless, wordless magic flattens him before he can finish the incantation. She
And when he'd started to protest—not that he didn't want that, but that he couldn't, he didn't know how to, he
Draco thought then that comparing his troubles to a measly tick seemed trivializing, but she hadn't really been wrong, in the end. Draco's tick was just particularly big, and strong, and stubborn, and perhaps even had some demonic quality giving it that extra dose of tenaciousness. He imagined his tick to have horns.
"It's like I married a cat," Harry groans, scrabbling for his wand on the bedside table, which makes it roll off and clatter to the floor. "Ah, fuck. Draco, cast a cooling charm, will you? My wand's gone under the bed." But Draco's too sleepy to answer.
"Look—no—
Voldemort had evicted Lucius and Narcissa from the master chambers to take up his own residence there. Almost funny, now, to think of Lord Voldemort needing a shower to wash away his semi-human stink after a long day of terrorism and murder, a toilet where he might sit too long contemplating his next evil plot and rise with tingling legs. A bed where he might perform the very vulnerable action of sleep. A dresser within which to keep his ubiquitous hooded black robes, perhaps ordered in bulk by Wormtail, because he could not imagine Voldemort taking the time to place an order with Twilfitt's. A footman, Voldemort had said, to help him prepare for bed or for the day. Draco's job during the occupation. There was nothing untoward about his time in Voldemort's chambers that had once been his parents', but Draco vividly remembers buttoning and unbuttoning Voldemort's robes, feeling his strange heartbeat under icy skin; pulling those robes onto angular shoulders or pushing them off; he remembers the numbness of his fingers at the fastenings of He Who Must Not Be Named's trousers, of all things. They had fastened at both sides of his hips, and Draco had counted it as a tiny, tiny blessing.
He's far past first blush with Potter. Harry, really. He might never have the opportunity to call him by his first name, might will himself to think of him as Potter when he's on the job, but when he dreams, it's of
Draco leaves the Ministry building, but he certainly doesn't go home. No, instead he heads out to make his own private investigations, because he knows anything else he tries to do right now will produce only failure and irritation. He's met with a lot of closed doors—no Auror authority means no answers, usually—but still he forges on, cursing under his breath between each stop.
"I shared a dorm with you," Ron says, leaning forward to pin Harry with such a look of finality that Harry leans back in turn, looking thoroughly flustered. It's clearly a checkmate. Draco thinks he understands from context, especially given the way Hermione seems to have excused herself from the conversation and right into her mug, but oh, he's going to enjoy dragging that one out of Harry later.
"Or Friday, if Thursday's too soon," Draco says quickly, laying his quill aside. "Friday? Thursday?"
Sunlight, as Draco gets to his feet, pouring over a brilliant golden field.
Draco's balance shifts, and he stumbles noisily in the canola stalks. The figure turns abruptly, the whites of their eyes shining and wet in the silver light from above.
that line about the moon was so idiotic and he'd put it to parchment anyway. Maybe the admonishment would come bundled together with hints that Harry's outgrowing Draco now that he's got his real friends back, never mind that Harry's
A teapot joins them on the blanket, suddenly, bringing with it a small glass teacup Draco's never seen before. A tightly-wrapped ball of leaves sits in the teacup's bottom, and when the teapot levitates to pour a neat stream of boiling water over it, the leaves unfurl into a flower that radiates a delicate color into the water.
"A headache, from how terrible this wine is," Malfoy says, sticking his tongue out.
He's still tired; six hours is no replacement for night after night of little to no sleep. Draco comes downstairs to find Potter in the kitchen, plates of hot and delicious food waiting on the table.
The document vanishes behind the shimmering air with a rustle. "Alright." And the shimmer is no more.
Harry hates him. Harry
"I," Draco says, "promise I will do my absolute best not to give you any new reasons to kill me. Truly."
of sleep to make," Draco says. "Harry, they're going to look at you no matter what you wear. You could be wearing the dullest robes known to wizardkind, and they'd still want an eyeful."
The eulogy is what anyone would expect at a funeral. All of Lucius Malfoy's mistakes and faults of character are distilled into a handful of strong, positive words. His bribe-like monetary donations become his generosity. His obsession with blood purity becomes a strong interest in preserving history. His need for a perfect son in his exact image now makes him a dedicated father.
He does have to assure an irritated Pansy and aloof Blaise that he really is okay, but then Greg wants to know what could have made him not okay, and he
"I wasn't aware there wasn't any air inside the Great Hall. What have I been breathing all this time?" Pansy releases his face. "Potter's looking for you."
Draco sucks his teeth. He wants to be a patient person, so he will, just like Dr. Fiddlewood said he should. "You could try my therapist. She caters to the magical community but practices strictly non-magical therapy. No Legilimens or anything." He thinks of Dr. Fiddlewood's tick analogy, and purses his lips with a bit of disgust. "Just talking."
Harry stands, silent and stunned, listening to Malfoy's wracked breathing. Malfoy isn't lying—he
hug two giant stacked eggs. He doesn't look any less happy to see her, though. She judges Hermione to look "Elysian," Draco to look "delightfully harlotous," and Ron—well, she clucks her tongue. "Ron, you must wear couture to a Gala." Ron only laughs.
Harry casts his gaze up the stairs. "She's an orphan, too."
He busies himself sketching a new, more stylized suit, with an asymmetrical closure that leads to a tall Mandarin collar. The trousers are slim without being tight, fitted just right over low boots with intricate brogue detailing. Gold crested buttons march along the jacket's closure, and at the jacket's cuffs; he'll have them cast himself if he can't source any with dragons. He fills the jacket with interlocking drawings of various dragon breeds, at least those he can remember off the top of his head; these will be gold embroidery on a bordeaux silk taffeta that will make the whole thing gleam. Arcing over the croquis' head, he scribbles an impression of a Hungarian Horntail in flight. Pansy will make that incredible.
"He's asked the Aurors to find that root, and you are to help us to that end." Potter says it so matter-of-factly that Draco finds it hard to discern whether he's been corrected or if Potter simply hadn't listened to his last words, speaking over him instead.
Hermione rolls her eyes. "Do you think you could put together a photo album? Of, you know. You and Harry?"
"I can't wait to be horrified by your bedroom," Draco says, and just as he realizes he's said he can't wait to be in Harry's bedroom, a pile of paper that had been neatly cataloging itself by level of importance explodes into a crinkling flurry, like a bird being hit by a Bludger. "Oh, damn it all!"
"What a prude you've grown up to be, Pans." He sighs, though, because maybe-Harry-Potter is probably the one client he really shouldn't show his nipples to on a first outing. He slings away his cape with a practiced gesture, and summons a black silk poplin shirt with a dramatic pointed collar, said collar decorated with tonal embroidery of bats. "Better?" he asks, once he's nearly done buttoning up the new shirt; despite her stated feelings about his nipples, she doesn't even blink as he changes in front of her. Frequently topless models in the atelier have inured them both to most nudity.
It gets easier with every new acquaintance they find. Neville Longbottom's married Hannah Abbott and is, by Hannah's telling, the favorite professor of many a Hogwarts student. Luna reappears, a man neither of them recognize trailing behind her; Luna says she "forgot to mention" she has twin boys, headed for their first year at Hogwarts in the fall.
The usually empty garden of Twelve Grimmauld place is full and loud and bustling. It's no Ministry Gala, but that's the point—this is a guest list curated on Harry's terms. Harry looks over the scene, and his anxiety finds its companion in the joy Draco can see blooming in Harry's eyes.
"Maybe not the middle of the pond," Harry admits, "for a first kiss, then."
Draco before the moonlight might have said Potter's been a thief many times over long before now. Draco now says nothing, especially as Potter holds the tiny yellow blossom out to him. He takes the flower with fingers that don't feel like his own.
of all places, but puzzle pieces are beginning to slot themselves together in his brain and he can't do much more than sit back and let it happen.
"No!" Harry protests, and he shoves at Malfoy's shoulder, but given Malfoy's already on the ground, it doesn't do much. "I mean it, I just—didn't tell anyone, given I barely had a chance with Cho."
to drop in his perfect quip," she grumbles. "Alright, Draco, we'll be there Thursday afternoon. Don't forget us, darling, you know your memory is shit."
"If you drink some water," Potter says as he sits on the sofa, summoning a glass that fills itself with water as it travels. This one doesn't spill, and Draco plucks it out of the air with an ungainly hand.
That'd be no way to earn himself future work with the ministry, true. Draco heads home with a heavy sigh, back to the echoing mausoleum that is Malfoy Manor. There's a moment where his hand lingers over parchment in the study, tempted to owl Pansy and invite her and Blaise over for a day of so-called bereavement—but he's not ready to be dressed down for his atrocious behavior at the funeral, no matter how much he deserves it.
"I—" Draco feels that tension in Harry again, and he resents Ginny for introducing it into this part of tonight's cycle so early.
Neither Pansy nor Blaise let their entrance to Malfoy Manor be awkward. They both greet Draco as if the way he'd abandoned them at the funeral had never happened, and let Draco lead them to the sitting room, where he's laid out the food and opened one of four bottles of wine.
"Plummeted?" Draco studies Pertinger's drawn face, the valleys of her cheeks that hadn't been present in her personnel file photo. No amount of magical hydration and nutrition can substitute for a real meal. He wonders if his father had looked so shrunken as he approached death; his mother hadn't let him see the body, wanting him to remember his father hale and whole. He hadn't asked why she'd said
"You've what? Hired a private investigator? Sent some dogs out after him?" Blaise interrupts. "I am trying, Draco, to be as sensitive as everyone else, and Hecate knows it's hardly in me to tread lightly. But you are in dangerous waters."
"I—what, so the path to redemption is just to apologize to you for everything I've done?" Malfoy joins him without so much as a sigh of relief, so caught up in his indignation.
"What, is my wine not good enough?" Potter scoffs. "What is that you've got in the glass?"
Draco pauses, gripping his wand tighter. It's been a long time since anyone's had anything to say to him about his Death Eater childhood, much less tried to lure him into some kind of a trap. "Come now," he says, as gamely as he can manage, "be sporting about it if you're going to attack me. Let me put a face to the mastermind."
But the outer robe. Upon the black silk organza robe, Draco has embroidered and beaded the entire Northern sky's constellations. From Pisces to Virgo, from Orion to Ophiuchus, no constellation has been left out. Every star is a golden pearl connected to the next by a shimmering stripe of golden silk. Along the hem and around the collar, tiny golden stags chase ribbon-stitched suns, kicking up their silk heels and lowering their gleaming antlers every so often. Around the robe is a sparkling golden cloud, for all the stars in the spaces between each constellation.
"Gone home?" Draco repeats, upper lip curling as he looks first at Larch then at Potter's door. "Without so much as a by your leave?"
thought the proper response to shouting at me over a bungled lunch invitation was to lay me out a romantic picnic from a Muggle shop!"
"I've got my cup," Harry says with a shrug, suddenly clutching a mug Draco hadn't seen before; there's a telltale tag on a string hanging from its rim. "That one's for you."
"I mean—" Draco takes a step closer. "Are you ready?"
The Great Hall is bright when Draco follows Harry through. The long tables he ate at as a child have been cleared away, replaced with a number of round tables; Draco wonders if they're the same ones they trotted out for the Yule Ball, all those years ago. The walls are pushed out, borrowing from the rest of the castle to Expand the room. Floating balls of
"He knows what that means," Hermione says to Draco in a conspiratorial voice, to which Draco says nothing because he wants well out of it.
"Good morning, Pansy," Draco returns, trying for normalcy and falling just short of the mark. He hopes it's still close enough.
Draco bounces back up before he can think better of it. Then he forgets what he meant to say.
"What?" Harry stops, at least, though he pulls his elbow away.
to the words I say," Draco says, giving Harry's shoulder a gentle shove. "A therapist."
There's no response, and Harry turns his head, wondering if Malfoy's gone under, or swum away—and startles, because Malfoy is so much closer than Harry thought. He's quiet, sunk down to his chin, eyes hooded as he keeps them trained on the surface of the water.
He has yet to present the third sketch to Harry.
"And..." Draco grimaces. "You saw the Daily Prophet today?"
"You want to do whatever you please, is what you want," Potter says without looking at him.
been violent. That's why he needs to leave, and consequently, why Ron and Hermione won't let him leave.
"Hullo," Potter's voice says from the front hall. Draco pokes his head out of the sitting room door, just enough to get a glimpse of Potter holding the door open, no Disillusionment Charm in play at all.
"All yours," Pansy says, putting her free hand up. "I wouldn't dare step between a Malfoy and the longtime object of his obsession."
"Why are you doing this?" Draco's mouth is dry. He's screaming inside himself that it doesn't matter what fucking intel he gathers if he's just going to die, but he's asked it already, and why
"Harry," Draco says, catching the other man by the wrist with a note of warning in his voice. "Don't do anything stupid."
He wants to walk up behind a busy Harry, take advantage of his extra few inches of height to put his chin on Harry's shoulder, pillow himself against that broad back. He wants Harry to turn and smile at the sight of Draco, open his arms to him. He wants to be enveloped in those arms, feel the softness of Harry's front at the same time as the muscle in his biceps. (Draco knows it's there—he's felt enough of Harry's body today to really fuel these impossible fantasies.) He wants—
He thinks of himself and Harry seated in front of the hearth, a blanket made by Mrs. Weasley drawn over their laps, going over plans for their wedding day; Harry had thought a seating chart was silly, but Draco knew Pansy ought to be kept away from the Weasleys for the sake of peace. He thinks of Harry kissing him, affectionate and chaste; he thinks of Harry kissing him again, hungry and passionate.
"Miss me already?" Harry sighs, on the third day of Draco's extra-clingy campaign.
His wand glows silver, but nothing escapes it.
Harry parts Draco's cloak at the foot of the stairs, tutting as he makes his inspections. "You never can keep your nipples to yourself, can you?"
He wakes, stays on the sofa until he wakes again, considers making tea, and doesn't wake for a third time until mid-afternoon. Then he sits up, casts his eyes listlessly over the latest edition of the Prophet without taking anything in for not quite an hour, and lies back down for another fitful bout of sleep. He retrieves a box of almond biscuits or rye crackers from the kitchen in the dead of night, and falls asleep in the process of eating it amid all the bedclothes that make his nest.
"I'm not flirting now, you arse. I mean it." Draco squeezes his fingers tight around Harry's wrist, as if to better prove how much he means it. "I know you like to fling yourself into the fray to prove how much of a hero you are, but for once, think of your suffering husband and be at least a bit of a coward."
, he'd say thank you.
"Four entire bottles? What kind of afternoon are we having, Draco?" Pansy scoffs.
Harry builds a cage for his every feeling, and a new face for his new placid self; one with shorn hair, and a cold expression that will not be shaken by evil. His friends don't give up on him, exactly, but then Hermione gives birth, and she and Ron are busy with a newborn and a toddler all at once, and Harry is a wall to the rest of his friends besides. All their efforts over several months are so much seafoam dashed against the rocks.
me in the past."
"I did," Harry says, rather sheepishly. His meek posture doesn't quite match his saintly aesthetic.
think of, rubbing slow circles into Harry's palm with his thumb.
"You," she says, abandoning the client requests to stalk around his desk, "accepted this client request without consulting me, your business partner who was kind enough to grant you the office with a door that closes."
back to front more times than I could count,
"Quite," Pansy agrees, but it doesn't have any of her usual spunk to it. She selects her tea from the cabinet, and pulls out a mug emblazoned with the logo for the London Underground. (He's never been sure where it came from.)
What a trick. Harry Potter, wearing the designs of an exonerated former Death Eater? How newsworthy for the 25th anniversary of the end of the war. Of course Potter doesn't want art.
"As though someone had pulled a plug on a drain, yes," the orderly says, sighing. "And we couldn't find the plug
"Oh." Harry looks stunned. "Things like what?"
Warmth floods Draco like a dam breaking, and he turns to squeeze both Molly's hands. "They can fix Harry? They can bring back
Once they've come back to Harry's house, Draco rubs Harry's back as he vomits up most of what he consumed at the party, then pulls off his shoes, socks and jeans to put him to bed. Harry tries to wrap his legs around Draco and pull him in for something hot and heavy, but Draco admonishes him with a firm, "You're drunk," and goes off into the corner to borrow one of Harry's shirts to sleep in. He doesn't even think about what he's doing until he's got the shirt halfway over his head, filling his nose with Harry's scent, and he pauses for a moment to just really see himself. Wearing Harry's things, sleeping in Harry's bed, taking care of Harry. He loves all of it.
"Malfoy!" Williamson barks. "Get Dendron out of here!"
"I don't know, I'm not feeling very flattered, and you know how much my ego needs stroking." Harry makes himself face the wall rather than Malfoy, because he's feeling dangerously exhilarated, grinning wide and bright. Is he
He wants to talk. He wants to say something deceptively lighthearted about the domesticity of cooking side by side, even if Draco's task barely qualifies for sous chef duty. He wants to ask Potter if he ever dreamed of something as small as this, with someone he might actually care about.
"Shut up, Malfoy. I plan things."
He begs his brain to try to be methodical again as he measures, doing his level best to pretend he doesn't know where to put his hands and still get the measurement he needs. Draco asks Potter to turn around; back rise. At least he's out of Potter's line of sight now. Mid-thigh. The fullest point of his calf. His ankle, lastly. It gets easier the further down he goes.
Potter narrows his eyes and cants his head to one side, ever so slightly. "Inside the manor?"
"NO!" This time his wand tears from his hands with a brutal tug, its polished surface hitting the palm of Harry's hand with a slap. Draco's hands follow it up as he surges off the floor, reaching for his wand, but Harry's hand answers in kind and meets Draco's chest in a violent shove. Draco is sent sprawling back to the floor in a heap, and he's humiliated to find tears stinging his eyes.
Draco rolls his eyes, jaw clenched. "I said you're right, Parkinson."
"I knew you had it out for me," Malfoy says, putting a woeful hand to his forehead. "Even now, when we're old and grey, you make an attempt on my life for grudges you can't leave in our sordid, sordid past."
Stupid. Potter's not here for tea and biscuits, he's here to do some dramatic thing with his war memories.
Blaise sits up and leans forward, scrubbing his hands down his face. "I am
that if someone is in his house, it's not a Death Eater, it's not Fenrir Greyback, it's not bloody
Harry huffs a few breathy laughs, eyes closing. "I'm a mess," is all he says.
Potter only looks uncomfortable, and Draco has to contend with the fact that while Potter may or may not be a child, Draco himself is certainly being a
"No," Draco moans, as the unsuccessful summoning charm on the wand fades and the wood stills. "Please, Harry, for the sake of the victims, let me finish the damn spell!"
"Well—yes." Harry scratches at the back of his head. Since the last Auror went home, he's let his hair show again, thick and shiny. "I suppose you couldn't stay in here alone, given you don't have keys."
The carefully indifferent pose Draco has maintained since Harry entered the courtyard softens, his body slumping against the bench like a marionnette being set aside. "No, Harry. You haven't made me angry."
"It's my house, I've been told," Harry says delicately, to his hands clasped in his lap.
"Your Muggle relatives?" Draco doesn't mean to interrupt, but the information—even just the visual of a tiny Harry struggling to get a skillet on a stove—
It's been fifteen years since the end of the war, and fifteen years since the Wizengamot took Draco's wand in exchange for his freedom, but he still feels unsettled as he steps into the lift at the Ministry of Magic. In any other context, he'd feel ridiculous for taking the lift a single storey, especially heading
Lucius could not live with his regret, no. After years of cycling through several reactions to his incarceration—fury, pleading, attempted bribery, and finally unabashed sadness—he had fallen to listlessness, and could not be convinced or forced to eat or drink. He died, in fact, much like victims of Venari Virtute—just with less screaming.
Not just because you ground me." Harry turns that rueful smile on Draco. "And you do ground me. I can't handle this fucking event without you, Draco, and I know that's selfish, I know that's unfair of me to ask of you. But when you left me in there with Charlie, I just felt myself start to go to pieces, because I
It takes Draco a moment to realize Potter is cooking. Cooking what, he doesn't know, but there's already a pot on the stove, a tray going in the oven, and an aproned Potter is deftly pulling the leaves from oregano stems.
"Well, it's our house." Draco doesn't bother correcting himself. It'll always be Harry's house. "Where is Hermione?"
It just still required him to be awake.
But he won't be leaving the Manor. He finishes his dinner, does his own washing up, and pens a trite response to his mother that acknowledges her mundane European adventures and utterly ignores her plea for his company. He mentions, with just a few words, that he's been contracted by the Ministry; she'll like that. Then he ties the letter to the leg of Archimedes, his very moody horned owl, and spends the rest of his evening reading a Muggle novel before heading to bed at a reasonable hour, in one of the only bedrooms left unlocked.
up to this point.
"Company?" Harry lets a smirk steal across his face. "From me, Harry Saint Potter? You're not afraid I'll get all sanctimonious on you?"
want his riding coat, he has enough presence of mind to remember that, so he rises.
"I'm not looking soppy. I'm looking intrigued by a story I've certainly never heard before." Draco looks at Blaise's glass properly. "Besides, I've never known you to waste that much wine."
you still in here?"
"Don't sound
might be violent. He already
Potter only looks at Draco, clasping his hands together in front of his chest, fingers kneading nervously. He takes a hesitant breath. "The Gala for the 25th anniversary of the end of the war is in a little less than four months. And I thought—or well, Hermione thought—this would be a good time for me to..." His fingers squeeze at the backs of his hands extra tightly. "To be seen."
Malfoy stares at him, hand coming away from his face.
Draco yelps with pain as Harry all but grabs him by the face, forcing him to face Harry's furious eyes, his furrowed brow, his snarling mouth. "No! The answer is supposed to be no!"
"It's very..." Potter looks over the sketch several times, until Draco wants to snatch it back. "It's sleek," he finishes, looking up at Draco with an expression Draco can't identify.
"Oh, I'll overheat you," Draco mutters, putting his arm right back over Harry's naked chest. He's too tired to follow through on his vague promise, but it makes Harry chuckle anyway.
But Draco's weekends belong to Harry.
Dumbledore had looked as though he'd known, in those last moments of his life.
"Because you agreed to help me with it, and we're on bloody holiday," Harry slurs. Also, and he won't say this one out loud (he hopes), because Malfoy seems so much less drunk than Harry, and that's not fair.
"When I have children, I'll make sure they never feel alone," Harry tells the sky, from their seat on a hillside, watching the sun go down on perhaps their tenth or twelfth outing. They'll have to go back soon, before the predicted rain comes through.
been lying to Pansy. He can't lie again and say that he hasn't been. Just—not about this. "Will you at least come over here to accuse me of lying?" Draco pulls a nearby stool closer, and pats the leather seat, pushing his work away from the table's edge as he does.
"I—well, you know, you got all poetic about my, you know." He's saying
"There's just a lot." Harry sighs, maneuvering around until he's lying on his stomach, facing the food so he can grab a cracker, which he tops with a bit of Chevre. "We don't have to talk about this, you know. I brought you here to enjoy yourself."
Charlie Weasley has always been the most attractive Weasley brother, in Draco's very secret opinion, and he sees no reason to change that opinion when Harry runs into him. He also remembers, as Harry and Charlie strike up the conversational band, those photos from Harry's birthday party. The very passionate kiss between the two of them, specifically. They'd both no doubt been drunk, and it had been ten years ago,
"I thought you said we couldn't talk about horses."
"This feels like something you'd serve to seduce someone," Draco says, tasting the broccolini next. "Not someone you loathe."
"I think you can," Draco says, with no actual clue as to the legalities of giving a Ministry contractor vague medical information.
"You don't have to keep doing that," Harry says, quite simply, and drops a pile of salad next to the shepherd's pie.
Ten months. Draco plants a mulberry sapling at the back of the garden after pushing the boundaries of the property out with an Expansion Charm. Harry's going to be so surprised to find an entire tree has grown while he's been gone, never mind that it got a head start.
"Do—" He swallows, flicks his tongue against his upper lip. "Do you want to come inside?"
"I don't mean because of that." Draco settles back into the bed, wiggling his shoulders until the wound in his right one reminds him he oughtn't. "Because you're powerful, Harry. Exactly the kind of powerful wizard Griselda would want to drain of magic."
"Stop it, Draco."
Draco's hands-on work ethic in his garden doesn't apply in the kitchen. Vegetables, greens, and herbs from his garden are being chopped, sliced, julienned, minced, and chiffonaded all over Molly Weasley's kitchen with a few judicious waves of his wand. He pretends not to notice when Molly adjusts his kitchen magic, trying to take silent notes, instead. Molly's explanations have become increasingly meandering with age; sometimes she forgets what she was trying to teach in the first place, and tells an anecdote from the sixties instead.
But Harry won't stop laughing, one hand over his face as he continually fails to keep his giggling to himself. It takes him another long minute before he's composed enough to show Draco the dining room.
"I haven't talked about what you said at Hogwarts—"
"Don't tell me what to do!" Harry snaps in return, despite continuing to move through the door.
slow that also makes you ill?"

this got extremely long, whew! i actually cut it off before i even originally meant to, but i think it's working out. a hearty thank you to this update's betas, Saphira and ThestralHouseofBlack for doing such excellent work, and a shoutout to spacehubsands who was busy conquering university this week—you've got this!
the drain. Now she's a bonafide Squib." She presses her fingers to her mouth. "I shouldn't say that."
"Draco." A hand is covering his. Harry's hand, hot and rough and missing the tip of its pinky. Harry's hand, turning Draco's over; Harry's thumb, tracing slow circles into the dip of Draco's palm. "Look at me." Harry's other hand, finding a place on Draco's jaw to turn his head in Harry's direction, and Draco might as well burst into flame at the touch.
He's made it about himself, when Harry had just opened up to him. What a clod he is. "You should see your friends, Harry. I'm sure they miss you."
"We talk," she had confirmed. "And we ease the tick out."
"Fine. Fine. May my daughter never lift her head from that stupid phone ever again so my friends won't call me old," Hermione huffs, and takes an aggressive slurp of her coffee.
He realizes, as Harry's own pained realization flashes across his face, that he hadn't even mentioned the word
"You're going to make me look like the Pope," Harry sighs, but he holds out one hand regardless. "I can put these on, you know. I could have put all this on myself. You're a bit tall to be a house elf."
"I'd ask you to promise not to get angry, but I don't think I can," Draco says, with a dry chuckle. "This is for Harry Potter, Pansy."
Once his family had settled down to eat, Harry stayed standing in the corner of the room. He meekly bowed his head, not wanting to catch the eye of his uncle or cousin.
“I need to get dressed first sir,” said Harry as he tugged at his overlarge striped pyjamas.
Carefully unfolding the heavy parchment Harry stared in disbelief at the contents. This had to be some kind of joke.
They sat in silence for a while basking in the warmth of the fire until Opal asked a question.
If it was possible Snape’s face went even paler and hot fury burnt in his black eyes, “You’re parents are very much alive, and they were not drunks. Your mother was one of the kindest people I have ever known.”
Once safely shut in his cupboard Harry took a deep breath and slid his arm under his mattress, trying to feel for the thick parchment.
Silence hung in the air like choking smoke, and Harry felt like someone was squeezing painfully at his heart.
As Harry was setting the plates on the dining table, his uncle entered the kitchen. Vernon didn’t even spare a glance at his nephew. It was like Harry wasn’t even there.
“What did you do?” moaned Vernon.
“And you’re too young to stay at the Leaky Cauldron on your own,” Snape heaved a monumental sigh, “I suppose the only option is for you to come home with me.”
There was some more grumbling from Vernon and then the slam of the front door.
“I’m certainly not letting you stay here, no matter what the headmaster says. This is no place for a child.” Snape practically growled.
Harry noticed that he was quaking with fear or excitement (he couldn’t tell), this definitely had something to do with the letter he’d received a few weeks ago. Was he about to be finally saved from the abusive house of the Dursleys?
,” he hissed quietly, hoping Snape wouldn’t hear him.
Harry knew that he should probably be polite to this stranger, he could be dangerous, but he couldn’t help asking, “Who are you?”
Bobbin turned out the lights but left the fire going.
Harry nodded.
Snape addressed her again, “We have a guest staying, his name is Harry Potter. He will be sleeping on the sofa, please make up a temporary bed for him. We will also be needing supper, oh and see if you can find a small mouse for Potter’s snake. Thank you Bobbin, you’re dismissed.”
“Do your relatives ever buy you anything new?” He asked.
A few seconds after the chime went off there was the sound of scuffling upstairs, and the heavy thump of his uncle’s footsteps.
“Good morning, we’re here to make a withdrawal from the Potter vault,” explained Snape.
Snape seemed to fidget on the spot for a moment, as if he was unsure what to do, “Well we should be going now Potter, we have a lot of things to get for you.”
As soon as the table was cleared and the plates were washed up, Harry rushed out of the door and tried to make it to school on time.
The witch nodded and led them over to the shop window.
Harry nodded excitedly, “Can I get a snake?” he asked.
He’d never liked bacon or eggs they were too salty and rich for Harry’s simple stomach, but the few dregs of orange juice he’d managed to scavenge over the years had been delicious.
“I’m afraid so,” said Snape with a frown, “He always has his reasons, but he can expect far too much from people. Which he evidently did with your aunt and uncle.”
“Yes, he seems okay,” said Harry.
Harry waited with baited breath, we’re they about to be burgled?
Snape and Narcissa both nodded.
“Good afternoon, how can I help you?” asked a tall witch with bright blue dreadlocks.
For the first time the man looked directly at Harry. Harry wasn’t sure what he was looking for but it seemed like he found it when he extended a bony hand.
Once inside Snape led Harry up to a free desk-goblin.
The goblin looked over his desk and down at Harry, “Do you have his key, sir?”
“Got the lot here – another young man is being fitted up just now, in fact.”
Working on auto-pilot Harry’s mind wasn’t on what he was cooking, it was firmly set on the mysterious letter hidden in his cupboard.
Harry was stood on another footstool next to the blond, and Madam Malkin slipped an identical robe over Harry’s head.
He dressed in a pair of ragged jeans with holes torn in the knees, a ratty t-shirt that used to be blue and was now a washed-out grey, and his only pair of shoes – a faded pair of trainers that were falling apart at the seams. Harry also slipped on his glasses, which were held together with a copious amount of sellotape.
Harry shrugged, “Most muggles are okay, but my aunt, uncle and cousin are horrible. They didn’t even tell me I was a wizard. In fact I only found out today. And only because Professor Snape turned up at my house to collect me.”
“So where is he?” demanded the stranger.
“Sir… what was she?” asked Harry, curiosity overriding his manners.
“Good morning, you must be Vernon Dursley,” the stranger sounded like he thought that the morning was anything but good. Harry was inclined to agree.
“First we have to collect your money.”
The boy looked shocked for a moment, “Healers are they?”
“Many muggles are afraid of magic, and unfortunately your family seems to be on the more extreme end of the scale,” replied Snape with an air of disgust.
As they made their way out of the dining room Harry started to clear the table. The leftovers were his breakfast. There was never much because Vernon and Dudley ate like they were starving, but Petunia pecked at her food like a bird so there was always a bit left for Harry.
However, Harry knew better than to judge a book by its cover, and was proved right when he entered the store behind Snape.
Harry watched as they apperated away, and wondered if for the first time in his life if he had a friend.
The boy shifted awkwardly on his stool, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to pry.” He did look apologetic so Harry forgave him.
Harry shook his head, “I’m afraid I don’t know anything about them.”
They were in a deserted street, lined with identical brick houses and broken streetlamps. Harry could see the shadowy silhouette of a tall industrial chimney looming over the houses in the darkness. Harry shivered, this town didn’t seem very friendly. It was downright eerie compared to the cheerful and lively Diagon Alley.
Harry dressed swiftly and skipped brushing his teeth, fearing that his uncle would come back downstairs and try to stop him leaving with Snape.
He entered the shop feeling rather out of place. All the bright cheerful robes felt mocking next to Harry’s tatty hand-me-downs.
“Well Potter, we can make one last stop at one of the pet stores. If you want a pet of course.”
Snape gave a curt nod, “I’ll wait in the driveway for you,” and then he strode out of the door.
True to his word the blond boy’s father soon approached the front of Madam Malkin’s shop accompanied by Snape.
Harry’s guess was proved correct when his large cousin squeezed into the room. As Dudley passed the stove he gave Harry a sharp poke in the ribs with his elbow, nearly making him drop the teetering stack of plates.
The wandmaker gave Malfoy senior a respectful nod, “Wand still treating you well, Lucius?”
Meanwhile Snape gave Harry a sharp but thoughtful look. He’d expected the young Potter to be a carbon copy of his father. He practically was in appearance. But he was reserved, withdrawn and not to mention stick thin. Harry was nothing like the boisterous arrogant James Potter. For that Snape was relived, but also worried.
Madam Malkin led Harry to the back of the store where a blond boy with a pale pointed face was stood on a footstool, while a second witch pinned up his long black robes.
“The letter said I was a wizard…” Harry mumbled quietly.
Nevertheless, Harry felt a cold, hard ball of disappointment settle firmly in his stomach.
“Yes, he’s my father’s closest friend. Actually dad should be arriving here soon, you can meet him.”
“Saint Mungos,” said Harry.
Vernon whimpered and scurried away, Harry felt the thump of his footsteps as he went back upstairs. What could of the stranger done to scare his usually unflappable uncle?
Harry thought back to all the times when odd things had happened to him. Now he thought about it, he had nearly always been feeling scared or angry when something peculiar happened around him.
Snape just tutted, “Come along Potter, we’ll apparate to my house.”
Instead of going to interrogate Vernon for it, the stranger murmured a word harry didn’t understand.
“So Potter,” Asked Snape, “Which one do you want? Strictly speaking snakes aren’t on the approved pet list for Hogwarts but no one ever pays any attention to that rule.”
Harry had dared hoped that maybe, just maybe, there was someone out there who wanted him. Who wanted to take him away from this dreadful family, but it was just an elaborate hoax.
Vernon gave Dudley a lift in his fancy company car every morning, but Harry had no such luxury.
Harry heard the stranger step closer to his cupboard, and start unlatching the numerous locks. Harry wondered what he’d do when he got to the one that needed a key.
Snape glanced down at Harry, “This way Potter.”
The blond pulled an appalled face, “
Once Harry was sure Opal was okay, he took in his surroundings.
Snape gave a Harry an almost sad look, but he was pretty sure that this intimidating man had never been anything but fully in control of his emotions, “Your parents are in no state to look after themselves let alone use their Gringotts account. So its control has been passed on to you.”
Snape tapped the door with his wand and held it open for Harry to scurry inside. He then stepped in behind him and shut the door behind them, leaving them in total darkness.
Harry didn’t say anything and just watched as Ollivander whipped out a long tape measure.
Harry sat down and waited for Snape to arrive, he soon made an entrance and sat down as Bobbin started serving a thick creamy soup and large chunks of fresh bread.
Harry didn’t know what a muggle was but he guessed Snape was talking about his aunt and uncle.
Harry let out a stuttering gasp, the letter was real, and this man knew his mum? He blinked a few times and let the knowledge sink in.
The little snake wiggled until she was comfortable and replied, “
As soon as Harry gripped the wand he felt a sharp shock shoot up his arm, and a shower of silver and gold sparks shot out the end of the wand.
“Why on earth do you want the little freak?” questioned Vernon, his voice had warmed to the stranger slightly. It seemed he approved of the stranger’s negative attitude towards Harry.
He had a letter!
Harry handed Vernon the mail and went to stand in the corner again, excitement bubbling inside his chest like a fountain.
He then slid the key and the letter across the table towards the desk-goblin. The goblin examined the key and gave an approving nod, and then read the letter.
Harry couldn’t contain his gleeful excitement and a wild grin exploded across his face, “So will I get to leave the Dursleys for good!?” he asked jubilantly.
“Because that’s the only place freaks deserve to be!”
This time Harry managed to scavenge some toast crusts, the better half of a grapefruit and a few mouthfuls of scrambled eggs. All in all it was one of his better meals.
He nodded, “Yes, it’s a very fine wand Mister Ollivander.”
Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Bobbin.
“Here, try this,” said the wandmaker, handing over a thin black wand for Harry to wave.
Harry and Snape emerged from Gringotts blinking in the sunlight, and Harry didn’t know where to turn first. Diagon Alley really was very overwhelming.
There was the sharp clinking of the door chain, and the soft snick of a latch being unlocked as Harry’s uncle opened the door – grumbling to himself all the while.
It was all in all, his best birthday ever.
Harry held out his right arm, and to his surprise the tape measure started to take his measurements all on its own like a thin flat eel swimming through the air. Ollivander let the tape measure do its work while he flitted around the shelves, taking down boxes.
He nearly jumped out of his skin when the doorbell rang. Harry knew burglars definitely didn’t announce themselves before they broke in.
Snape gave Harry a piercing look but stayed silent.
,” hissed Harry as he held Opal up next to his face so he could converse with her properly.
The house elf led Harry and Opal to a dimly lit room with a small square table that was only set for two. Yet Harry noticed that a tiny saucer for Opal had been set to the side.
The reptile witch gently held the little snake out for Harry to hold. He carefully accepted the snakeling.
Snape nodded and withdrew a tiny golden key from his pocket, “I also have a letter from Professor Dumbledore.”
“Welcome to Diagon Alley, Potter,” said Snape, clearly enjoying the dumbstruck look of amazement on Harry’s face.
It was the thirty first of July, dead-on six o’clock in the morning when there was a loud crack outside. Harry jolted awake instantaneously. He’d always been a light sleeper. He put it down to the fact that he never felt very safe in this house, and was always on the lookout for danger.
The stranger replied rather gleefully, “Just a stinging hex, you best go back to bed because the next time my hand slips it won’t be so forgiving.”
“Really?” exclaimed Harry.
Harry nodded.
Harry grinned and turned to the witch, “Could I have the white one please.” He asked.
“Do I have to go home now?” asked Harry, worried that the Dursleys wouldn’t like Opal at all.
“I’m going to kill that old fool,” swore the stranger.
Ollivander glanced at Harry with his misty moonlike eyes, “Hmm yes, why not, aspen and basilisk fang. Not often used merely because of the scarcity of basilisks, not to mention they’re very reluctant to give anyone a shaving of their fangs.”
Silence.
An old man seemed to appear out of nowhere. His wide pale eyes shone like twin moons through the gloom of the shop.
As Harry’s eyes got used to the light he saw that the stranger was an almost sickly looking man, with pale skin and gaunt cheekbones, and there was something harsh and hawk-like in his hard stare.
Snape answered her, “Yes, we’re looking for a breed of snake that is relatively docile and doesn’t grow too big,” He glanced at Harry, “It would also need to be non-venomous.”
“Where is he?” repeated the stranger tersely.
,” She hissed.
They entered the shop just as Harry and the other boy finished their fittings.
The blond boy nearly fell off his stool, “That’s horrific!”
Opal nodded her tiny head, the light from the fireplace reflected in her pink eyes making them glow a vibrant red.
“First door on the left, Potter,” said Snape curtly.
So Harry made the beds, vacuumed the carpets, dusted the shelves and watered the houseplants. By the time all that was done it was nearly six o’clock and he had to make a start on dinner.
When Harry woke he was disorientated for a moment. His mattress was unusually soft and he was pleasantly warm. It was only when he opened his eyes that he remember what had happened.
“Do you know what house you’ll be in yet?”
Harry had already gathered that muggles were the wizarding word for non-magical people, “No both my parents were magical, but they couldn’t look after me so I was sent to my muggle aunt and uncle’s house.”
Harry knew he looked a mess, but it wasn’t like he had a choice. With one last feeble attempt at flattening his hair, Harry made his way outside to join Snape.
Harry grinned. “I think we’ve probably ordered so many of these now that we’re worthy of the best chicken.”
“Just checking!” Harry said with a grin. “I’ll get started in here then.”
Draco smiled. “I’m looking forward to it.”
“Oh. Yeah. Too many onions,” Harry said, nodding wisely. “I’ve made that mistake before.”
They fell silent as they began to read. Occasionally, at particularly thrilling moments, Harry felt an urge to grab Draco’s arm. An urge that he pushed down firmly. He wasn’t sure how well Draco would take to being grabbed out of the blue, even though they were friends. Instead, he shifted his position again, leaning against Draco so that their shoulders were pressed together comfortably.
“Oh, amazing,” Draco said, sitting forward slightly. “They do look nice, thank you.”
Draco snorted. “Thanks, Potter. It means a lot coming from you.”
Harry grinned. “You’ll find out. Good night,” he said, closing his eyes.
Harry laughed and pulled a notepad towards him, before taking a quill out of his apron pocket. “Yeah, I remember it well. Alright then, what exactly are you after and when for?”
Draco chuckled. “Yes, they are. Let’s order,” he added, nodding to where the café assistant was waiting to take their order.
“Sort of, yeah. I mean, they don’t stick to it religiously, but if they have people over for dinner they tend to,” Harry replied. “Molly doesn’t like to repeat a meal that someone has had before. Last time I had dinner there, we had a roast chicken dinner.”
Draco took the box and nodded. “Okay. If you want to have a look through that box, the one labelled ‘bedroom’, there’s all sorts in there and I know I won’t want it all. A lot of it is from my childhood.”
Harry gave him a torn look. “Yes please,” he said eventually. “I really want to carry on reading, but I also want cake.”
“Oh, bugger, have I not put one out?” Harry groaned, standing on his tiptoes to look over Ginny’s shoulder.
“Luckily for you, no,” Draco said. “Who was it this time?”
“Thanks,” Harry laughed, meeting Draco in the middle of the shop and taking his coffee. “If it makes you feel better, I haven’t watered anything yet.”
“Should we have a colour theme?” Harry suggested, taking another sip of his coffee. “For the display, I mean. We can do arrangements in any colour.”
Harry shook his head, grinning. “I don’t know whether to be insulted by that or not. Look, all you need to know is that I like him, we get on well, and we like going for coffee.”
“Good. Now get out of my sight,” McGonagall finished, gesturing for them to leave.
“Of course I want to be happy,” Draco sighed. “But if I went for this, put my heart into it, and it all went wrong then not only would I be miserable, I’d likely lose one of my best friends, not to mention my work colleague.”
“No, no, you stay there,” Draco shook his head. “It’s literally just plating up that I’ll be doing. Just… relax.”
“No swearing if you’re in public though,” Draco said, pointing a finger at him. “You know how she hates that.”
“Sounds like a nightmare,” Harry said, chuckling. “I wonder why people do it.”
Hermione stood up to go to the bar before any more could be said.
“Dare I ask what you’ve been doing?” Charlie asked warily.
Harry threw a piece of florist’s sponge at him. “Alright, alright. Well done, Mister Smartarse. Anyway, how come you don’t have plans tonight?”
“Well, we haven’t been on a ‘date’ for a good few weeks now,” Draco replied with a shrug. “Have they stopped trying to set you up?”
“Because it’s what people
“There’s not really much call for a roast dinner when you live alone,” Draco replied with a shrug. “Don’t you find that?”
Harry nodded. “She had a fair bit of trouble at the start, by all accounts, but the flowers speak for themselves and people got tired of vandalising the shop.”
“Okay, so no need to apologise again. He knows you’re sorry,” Charlie said. “Maybe take him a coffee when you first go in, but then just keep conversations work related unless he brings up anything else. Let him make the move. Do you think he’s angry or hurt?”
him.”
“Stop it. He’s here,” Pansy said, swatting Draco on the arm. “Auror Potter. What a surprise.”
“Keep your hands off! They’re not for you!” Harry laughed, holding the flowers out of his reach. “They’re for the ladies among us.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “You need to learn how to say no.”
“Oh, yeah, I didn’t think of it like that,” Harry said thoughtfully.
Let me know by return owl, or fire call, but don’t say anything to any of your family.
“Yes, sorry Molly, it went down the wrong way,” Harry said apologetically, recovering from the incident.
“You’re telling me. Look, I was sure of my feelings before today. Pansy helped me be honest with myself – not that I’ve told her that – but I still couldn’t tell you,” Draco said. “The fact you actually lied to me hurt. But now you’ve explained, I suppose I understand why you did it and I can’t really blame you.”
“Yeah, yeah, we’ll see,” Harry said, giving Draco a look of amusement. “Come on then. Let’s get out of here. I need to be at The Burrow for ten tomorrow to watch the kids do an Easter egg hunt.”
“Oh. Well, thank you. I suppose we have time to eat the sandwiches before we get started,” Draco replied, putting his notepad and quill down. “I want to do a move around of the displays. They’re looking a bit tired.”
Harry rolled his eyes but obediently lifted his cup to his mouth once more.
“A solid plan,” Draco nodded. “Here. Bacon sandwich,” he added, throwing a paper bag to Harry who caught it easily.
Groaning softly, he went to the fridge and grabbed a packet of cooked ham and the butter. Then he made his way to the counter by the sink to get some bread so he could make himself a sandwich. For all he’d had twenty chicken nuggets and extra large fries, as he’d predicted, he was hungry again. Not wanting to eat a great load more, a sandwich was the perfect compromise.
“Like I said, I can’t blame you for that. But if you’ve really fallen for him, don’t you think he deserves to know?” Charlie asked, his expression becoming serious again. “How can you work with him, knowing how you feel?”
“Let’s eat first,” Harry said, his sandwich already halfway to his mouth. “I’m starving.”
Charlie laughed. “I can imagine. Unless the flowers are likely to try and kill you?”
“A cat. I can’t walk a dog, can I? So a cat is the only real option,” Draco said. “I’ve looked into it. I’m going to adopt the cat that’s been in the shelter for the longest and it will come and live here with us.”
,” Harry sighed. “Look at Charlie.”
“I’d love to,” Draco said, smiling. “Although, perhaps after Christmas?”
“Well, yeah, but preaching about it to people isn’t,” Harry replied. “Especially when you barely know those people. Do you know where he suggested we go after we finished the bottle of wine?”
Harry looked around at Hermione before taking a step towards the bed. “How close can I get?”
Draco pulled Harry to his feet and they both ran up the stairs.
“Er, probably not a lot once I finish work, why?” Harry asked, looking at George over his shoulder as he walked into the back room to put the bouquet in a bucket.
As he drained his glass, it crossed his mind that perhaps it
“You have a very good set up there,” Arlo said, returning the smile. “Why would I want to leave?”
Harry grinned and settled into his chair, beginning to read.
“I’ve been going out with Draco, to–” Harry began before Charlie cut him off with a disbelieving laugh.
“Oh my word, you thought right,” Harry said as he looked at the treacle tart longingly. “This is my favourite.”
Draco laughed, reaching for their cloaks from the rack. “Wait until you sit on my sofas. They’re even better.”
Ten minutes later, Draco looked up as Harry walked back through the door, the bell jingling above the frame.
Harry gave him a mock salute and headed down the aisle.
“I’m just going to have my usual,” Draco said, following him. “I’m in the mood for chicken salad.”
Draco chuckled. “I will, don’t worry. Good night, Mother.”
Harry took the summoned jug and filled his glass back up, as well as Draco’s. “We’ll be alright in a few minutes. Then we can at least relocate to the sofa.”
“Thank you,” Draco replied. “I’m finished here and I’d better get going. I’ll be going home afterwards, so I’ll see you again soon,” he added, standing up and moving around to kiss Narcissa on the cheek. “Thank you for this.”
“Oh, that’s right, I’d forgotten your mother was going to work tomorrow,” Harry said, sitting down. “Well, I don’t know about you, but a lie-in sounds good.”
“Well,” Harry panted after a few minutes. “That was worth missing dinner for.”
George frowned thoughtfully. “Now there’s a question,” he said, tapping his chin with one finger. “He must be about twenty by now.”
Ron nodded. “Yeah, I think Mum was trying not to show how surprised she was,” he said before sniffing the air. He lifted Hugo up and sniffed again before making a face. “Ah, sorry, I need to go and take care of this situation before he puts everyone off their dinner.”
Harry laughed. “I have to agree, although the rest of your family are also great.”
“What kind of auction?” Harry asked, rolling over so that he could kiss Draco’s jaw.
“Urgent?”
Harry shook his head again. “Well, we’re glad you’ve all found psychic abilities.”
Harry grinned and pulled Draco in for a kiss before allowing him to lead the way to a small waterfront restaurant where they enjoyed pasta and wine.
Harry rolled his eyes but couldn’t keep the smile off his face. “Yeah, yeah. Alright, are we all done here now?”
Harry smiled, looking down at the worn, rather threadbare brown rabbit in Draco’s hands. “And you’ve still got it?”
“Remember Theodore Nott from school?” Draco asked. He was slowly working his way towards the counter, mopping as he went. “Him.”
“Of course we can! Watch!” Harry replied, twirling round to face Draco. He attempted to lead Draco further onto the floor but Draco tugged his hand free, leaving Harry on his own. Shrugging, Harry began to dance anyway.
“There’s always one,” Draco nodded. “I had one that did that last week. Took me three attempts to get the bow right.”
“How do you find working with him, then?” Harry asked, realising that this could give him an insight into what it would be like working with Draco if they were in a relationship.
“Just trying to be organised,” Harry said with another laugh. “We could always go and work some of lunch off…”
Harry didn’t know how he got through the rest of the meal, but he did. Lucius had questioned him several times, but had seemed satisfied with the responses he’d given and had gone back to his food each time with a roll of his eyes.
“Still, a bit of warning might have been nice,” Draco replied, sinking back into the sofa cushions beside Harry. “Then I might not have worried myself almost to death this morning.”
“Ah. Same as me,” Harry said with a smile. “Until some meddling friends of mine decided to take things into their own hands.”
Draco turned around again. “Hmm? Oh, yes. I suppose I would. People are always desperate to shove us together.”
“Oh. Yes, please,” Harry said, immediately digging a hand into his pocket. “He–”
“How in Merlin’s name did you find out about that?” Draco asked, whipping his head around to look at her.
“Do I get to know where we’re going yet?” Harry said, falling into step with Draco.
A few moments later, he found himself looking into the kitchen of Charlie’s cottage in Romania. Charlie and Arlo were both gazing at the fireplace with concern. Charlie’s brow was furrowed.
Charlie,” Harry said, shaking his head. “No. We just messed around a few times throughout the summer. But then he had to go back to Romania, and that was that. Neither of us were after anything serious at the time, but what we had helped a lot.”
“Not just yet,” Draco groaned. “I don’t think I can walk yet.”
“Just what I like to hear,” Draco said with a smile. “Shall we go through to the parlour then?”
Harry nodded. “Yeah, it’s really nice. And your sofa really does look comfortable.”
Harry shook his head, an amused smile on his lips as he took a drink from the bottle. He settled back against the sofa and gazed out of the window. He could see people walking past on the other side of the road, but they weren’t close enough to see into the house. He wondered whether people
“Well that hasn’t stopped them in the past,” Draco said. “But, I suppose you’re not complaining.”
Draco groaned softly into the kiss, his own fingers fumbling with the buttons on Harry’s shirt. He manoeuvred them over to the bed, pushing Harry down onto the soft mattress and crawling atop him, fingers still working on the buttons.
“I think all of my school things are in my old trunk, there,” Draco said, pointing.
“Oh, it was a tie in the end,” Harry replied, laughing. “Although if you ask Draco, I’m sure he’ll say that he won. Don’t believe him though.”
Draco opened a drawer and put his hand inside. “One… two… three.”
Harry shook his head. “No, lucky for you. People will talk about me no matter what I do. I’ve learned it’s easier not to worry about it.”
“Can you believe it’s October already?” Harry asked, watching as Draco pulled the security gate across.
socialising. Trust me. I am unlikely to be busy.”
Harry smiled, resting his head against Draco’s. “You’re not wrong. So… are you staying tonight?”
“Alright, then thank you. I will take them,” Harry said with a smile. He began to pull the bunches out of the bucket they were in, then paused. He dropped the bunches back into the bucket and picked the whole thing up. “I’ll bring this back with me after Christmas.”
“I know. It happens every year,” Harry said, chuckling. “I do still get surprised every time.”
“Oh, thanks,” Harry replied, immediately shrugging the jacket off. He’d decided to dress in Muggle clothes rather than wizarding robes, just in case there were Muggles around. He handed it to Draco, who hung it in a cupboard that was by the door. “So do you have neighbours?”
“I think so, yes,” Draco replied. “We can have a look tomorrow. We’ll need to pick ribbons and stuff too.”
Draco waited until he was settled and then sat at the other end of the sofa. The sofa was bigger than it looked and there was a decent space between them to allow them to adjust their seating position, should they want to.
“Yes, it is. Don’t think I don’t know what you’re doing,” Narcissa replied. “I am simply expressing my concern.”
“Really?” Harry asked, glancing at Draco curiously.
Draco shrugged. “Not sure, I assume they must think it’s going to end up coming to our department so want us to get eyes on it before it comes in.”
“I’m seeing someone,” Ginny said, taking one hand out of her pocket and pulling her ponytail free of her coat. “I have been for a little while, but I only just told Mum and Dad. Thought I’d come and see you, too.”
Harry shook his head as Draco disappeared into the back room. “Sorry about him.”
He didn’t have to dwell on it for too long, as Draco was soon back and handing Harry a cup of coffee.
“Look. This is obviously stressing you out. Why don’t you tell them next time they ask you about a date, that you already have one,” Draco said, the idea coming to him in bits. “Then let me know and I’ll arrange something better.”
“Oh, no, the bottle is fine,” Harry replied, feeling himself turn red as he took the bottle. “Yes, you were right. This is a comfy sofa.”
Pansy rolled her eyes dramatically but smiled. “I bumped into your mother at the bank. She told me you had a date.”
“Good. I should hope so,” Draco replied with a grin. “We need to make sure we’re not behind next week. All the Easter flowers will be taking up our time.”
“Now that would have been interesting,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow. “What will you tell them if they do tell you to bring him?”
Harry gave a laugh. “Yeah, alright. I’ll be hungry again in an hour, but it’ll fill a hole I suppose.”
Harry laughed and grabbed his cloak from the cupboard. “Alright, I won’t be long.”
Harry couldn’t help but smile at the gesture.
“Oh, they would be nice,” Harry agreed, still sipping at his coffee. “Or yellow poppies?”
Harry gave him an impressed look. “I can honestly say that that thought has never occurred to me, but it does make sense. Have you managed it yet?”
Draco nodded, looking around. “I think so. Everything is clean and protected, the sign is on the door… let’s get out of here.”
company over that of your friends ,” Draco replied, giving Harry a sideways look. “Not that I’m complaining. You’ve got me out of the house more than normal.”
Harry took a bite of his own slice of cake. “Oh, you’re right. It
Ron nodded, grinning. “Yeah, he’s been so close and then he finally cracked it – no pun intended – at the weekend. He was quite disappointed that we had roast beef on Sunday. He wanted to surprise her with it then.”
will be cold when I’ve walked the length of the dormitory to get here.”
Before he could dwell on the thought, the fireplace roared and Hermione stepped into the kitchen. “Granger!”
“That won’t be necessary, thank you,” Harry laughed. “I don’t mind being a couple of pages behind you.”
Harry leant over to check the list. “Yeah, that’s right. Dean Thomas from school, remember him? It’s his mum.”
Harry nodded, still smiling as he turned away and slid off his stool. He picked up a trug and headed onto the shop floor to pick up the dried flowers they would need, making sure to collect enough for two bouquets.
Harry couldn’t help laughing at the absurdity of the situation. He was glad to see that George was still capable of causing a scene that was so ridiculous it made all other thoughts disappear. He watched as Molly rescued the baby chicken from the sea of gravy it was sitting in and took it to the sink to give it a very careful bath.
Thankfully, their regular customers continued to visit and the business continued to go from strength to strength. It was as the weeks passed that the purchases of dried flower arrangements overtook the fresh flowers and both Draco and Harry found themselves wondering how it had happened.
“Thank you. It’s not too bad,” Draco replied as he shut the door and turned to face Harry. “You can use magic here. The last occupant had everything converted so that magic could be used in place of that electricity stuff.”
Harry smiled. “You’re a good egg, George.”
“I don’t have any plans either, really,” Harry said, sipping at his coffee. “I might go over to The Burrow at some point, but other than that, nothing is planned.”
“It helps when you created them in the first place,” Draco replied with a sheepish grin. “I wasn’t really sure you’d appreciate it, but I also wasn’t sure what would be appropriate to give you as a gift when we’ve only been seeing each other for a couple of weeks.”
Harry laughed. “Thanks, Ron. I’m okay for now.”
Harry nodded distractedly as he began threading the ferns into the unit.
Ron shrugged. “You know what people can be like. Anyway, what about you? How did your date go on Saturday?”
,” Harry said with a derisive snort. “I mean, I don’t mind juice bars. During the day. Not on a night when you’re trying to relax after a busy week!”
“Maybe,” Draco nodded. “Although I think mistletoe normally suggests something more than talking…”
“Like what?”
“I’m so sorry, Harry. Can I come through? Your note sounded a bit like you need a chat sooner rather than later,” Charlie replied, giving Harry an apologetic look. “I don’t have any appointments back in the UK for months so I thought I’d take a chance.”
“Here, drink your coffee first,” Harry replied, holding out one of the coffee cups. “I’m sure the orchid will be fine for now.”
day to buy your partner a bouquet of flowers on a whim.”
“I bet,” Harry replied with a smile.
it is,” Draco replied with a grin that looked almost proud. “I have the day off too and I’ve made some plans for us.”
“Mm, yes, it does,” Harry nodded. “Should we get a slice of that each?”
Harry grinned and sat up too, pulling a notepad across. He picked up a quill and drew a rough rectangle on the first blank page. “Alright, do you want to do the drawing or should I?”
Harry nodded again. “Yeah. Yeah, alright. Thanks Charlie. I’m really sorry for bothering you and interrupting your evening with Arlo.”
Harry rolled his eyes with a smile, but picked his mug up obediently, sipping at the coffee.
“Are you working on anything at the minute?” Harry asked, looking at Draco who shook his head.
“This is convenient,” Draco said, looking over his shoulder at Harry. “I like this particular alcove the best. It’s got the window and the fire, and it’s in the perfect position in the shop. Not too close to the café area, but not too far away either.”
“We both did,” Harry said. “I’m not complaining that we’re busy because Merlin knows it’s better than twiddling our thumbs, but it is a lot more tiring. I usually get home on a night and, once I’ve eaten, go straight to bed. I don’t sleep, but I haven’t got the motivation to do anything else, either.”
nice.”
Draco left the room quicker than he’d arrived there, immediately heading for the bathroom. He opened the cabinet he knew Harry kept his potions in and pulled out the rack containing the vials. “Why in Merlin’s name would you even have that potion,” he muttered to himself as he began rifling through the vials. “And not have the bloody antidote! For fuck’s sake!”
Draco nodded, sucking the chocolate off his fork as he pulled it back out of his mouth. “Yes. I’m glad you like it.”
“Thank you. It looks lovely,” Draco replied, taking the plate and examining the sandwich. “Plenty of chicken.”
Draco shook his head, looking amused as he stood up to follow Pansy into the dining room.
“Don’t worry, Father. We wouldn’t dream of inconveniencing you that much,” Draco said smoothly. “We were a bit late as we were having a discussion about Harry’s work.”
“I think that it would be a very awkward affair if I were to turn up,” Draco said, shaking his head. “Blaise Zabini and I are very different people.”
Charlie smiled as he placed the egg in Harry’s hand carefully. “Sorry about the mess.”
“Oh, don’t worry. I don’t think she expects them from you,” Ron said. “Well, not anymore, anyway.”
to him!” Draco exclaimed.
Draco hesitated. “No. I don’t.”
Draco took a deep breath and nodded.
“Same here,” Harry said. “I didn’t get much as a child, until I got to Hogwarts anyway, so I’m sort of used to not getting a lot at Christmas.”
Draco snorted. “And that is why I would never admit it if I had made it.”
“Oh Merlin, that time at school,” Draco groaned. “I was terrified.”
Harry, who found himself missing the warmth of Draco’s shoulder, shrugged. “I don’t know. Have we not got any orders we could make up?”
“Thank you,” Draco said with a smile, following her into the house. She wasn’t wrong. The early spring sun that they’d enjoyed over the Easter weekend had slipped away some time during the week to give way to thick, black clouds that were heavy with rain; rain which was now pounding down onto the streets.
“So it is. We’re still on for tomorrow, aren’t we?” Harry replied, glancing at Draco.
Harry grinned and pulled his apron off, hanging it on the hook in the store cupboard. “Thanks. Again. Enjoy your night.”
“Yeah, but the Harpies have a big game tomorrow,” Ron replied through a mouthful of roast chicken. “She doesn’t dare come home the night before because she knows Mum will make her eat a huge plate full.”
Harry nodded. “Sounds good. It’ll be a nice day tomorrow then.”
“It’ll be nice even if there’s snow,” Harry said, continuing to sweep the floor. “It’ll make being home even nicer.”
“Yes. Absolutely,” Draco nodded. “Let’s go and get some sleep.”
Harry stopped in his tracks and turned to face George. “Angelina’s cousin?”

Draco nodded, looking anxious. “Yes, but I modified it. Press it.”
“With the rules of ‘I Spy’?” Hermione asked disbelievingly. “How–”
“This is it,” Ron said, digging in his pocket for some money. “It’s more than I came in for.”
“That was mine,” Draco said, averting his gaze slightly. “I made it, I mean and they allowed me to bring it in. The reason I didn’t tell you then was because you said you’d want me to make it for you all the time, and that gave me all kinds of anxiety.”
Harry laughed and shifted so that he could press his forehead to Draco’s. “Don’t let me stop you.”
Upon arriving home, he threw off his cloak and ran straight upstairs, taking them two at a time, so that he could have a quick shower. He didn’t know why, but he always felt that turning up at Pansy’s
“Nice and early,” Draco said with a nod. “A full day of work to do before we have our date.”
“Potter,
“See you,” Draco replied, before turning on his heel and heading for the Apparition point.
There are two amazing pieces of artwork in this chapter. The first is by Krysta (StarLeighNight) and the second piece is by Peachbabypie.
Harry laughed. “Never say never. Alright, here goes,” he said, pulling out his wand and pointing it at the vase. He muttered a spell, changing the colour from off-white to a deep red. “That’s not bad, is it?”
“Why is that?” Draco asked, gazing through the glass window at the cat who was staring back at him.
“I think we did. But I have to admit, as first dates go, this wasn’t really how I thought this would play out,” Draco said, smiling.
can hear every word you’re saying,” Harry said, raising his voice slightly.
“Well, I didn’t want to go overboard, did I?” Draco asked, looking less anxious. “You might get a big head.”
“What’s happened?” Draco asked sharply, looking around only to find nothing seemed out of place.
For all ten years had passed since the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, and while he and Harry Potter had essentially made peace with one another, they still couldn’t be considered
“Good. Have we had any customers?”
The bell above the door rang clearly as Harry entered the shop and he winced. It always sounded so much louder at this time of the morning. Stepping away, he let the door swing shut behind him and he made his way through the shop to the back room.
“No, we haven’t. But maybe now we’ll get back to normal,” he said. “Although I think, perhaps, there’s another conversation we’re still to have, don’t you?”
“You too,” Harry replied, shifting the bucket of flowers in his arms. “I’ll be at yours for five.”
Draco rolled his eyes and followed Harry to the dance floor. He was aware that other people were watching them with interest.
“Exactly. Honestly, I don’t know where Hermione finds these people,” Harry sighed, downing the rest of his coffee. “That’s hit the spot. Do you want the baby or the birthday today?”
“Is it really that unexpected?”
“I know. I feel better actually saying it out loud, you know. I think I was just trying to convince myself that I was imagining it,” Harry replied.
“I suppose that makes sense,” Harry said, nodding. “I would be too, given how much I’ve talked about it.”
“Good night,” Draco echoed, studying Harry’s face for a moment before closing his own eyes. A warmth settled in his stomach. Maybe tonight would be the first night he got a full night’s sleep.
Draco arrived at his flat within moments of leaving Bookworms and Brews. He hadn’t bothered walking to the Apparition point, he’d simply ducked into a dark alley before turning. He pulled his cloak off as soon as he landed, marvelling at the fact he’d got home without splinching himself.
Harry snorted. “I suppose that’s a good thing, then. She seemed happy too, so I’m pleased for her.”
“A year?” Harry asked with a grin, sweeping some more fallen petals off the counter and into the bin.
Yet, when he thought about spending time with Draco, he felt none of the distrust he’d had for so long at school. It was one of the reasons he’d been so quick to tell Ron he already had a date, along with the prospect of spending more time in Bookworms and Brews. Spending time with Draco was now something he quite looked forward to on a daily basis. They still challenged each other, it was just more light-hearted now and they could laugh together instead of at one another. It hadn’t been easy, getting to that point, but after years working together, their relationship was certainly much improved.
Draco turned and headed back down the row, poking Harry in the side as he passed, smirking at the barely concealed yelp of surprise Harry gave.
“Fine, fine. Carry on,” Draco replied, giving Harry a grin. “It’s better than silence.”
“I’m sorry to hear that,” Harry replied sincerely.
Harry grinned and grabbed Draco’s hand, leading him up the stairs at a jog. Once they were in the bedroom, he pulled Draco in for another kiss, his hands pushing the soft material of Draco’s jumper up before sliding underneath and making Draco shudder with anticipation.
“With Blaise Zabini as a friend, a lot of conversations in later years revolved around girls. Not to mention Pansy throwing herself at me at every opportunity,” Draco replied with a chuckle. “I love Pansy, but as a sister, I suppose. Definitely not in any other way.”
“Oh, I see. Well, they’re not bad, I suppose,” Draco replied, ushering Harry through the door and closing it behind him. “They do the job.”
Sunday passed quickly for Harry, and it was soon Monday morning. He had jumped out of bed as soon as his alarm had gone off, instead of snoozing it and going back to sleep for another hour. He’d showered and was on his way into London before six am, fully intending to do as Charlie had suggested and call into their usual coffeeshop on his way in and get coffee for Draco. Of course, he would also get one for himself, but Draco’s would be much fancier.
Harry hummed to himself as he finished sweeping the last bit of the floor behind the counter.
“Alright, alright. There was Cho… Ginny… then the thing with Charlie and… that’s it, really,” Harry said, writing the names down and looking up at Draco. “None of the others were meaningful enough to be considered my ‘type’.”
Ron stepped backwards out of the kitchen.
Harry felt his stomach clench at her words. Suddenly he wasn’t hungry. Hermione hadn’t said anything yet, but he could tell it was serious. She wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t, he thought.
“That’s absolutely fine,” Draco said, picking his mug up to take a drink. “I do like all the fancy drinks, but I don’t think you can go wrong with a nice plain coffee, do you?”
“Indeed,” Draco snorted, then paused. “Do you think this is strange? Us, like this, I mean?”
“No, not really,” Harry said with a shrug. “We just went for coffee. We’re taking it slowly, just getting to know each other really to see if things will work.”
“Neither am I,” Draco replied quickly. “Trust me. Anyway, no date this weekend?”
“Because I wanted it to be a surprise,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “Come on. We’ve got half an hour before we have to leave.”
Draco laughed too. “Jealous is good too. So… what now?”
“Oh, you didn’t have to do that,” Molly replied, stepping backwards and gesturing for Harry to go inside. “But thank you.”
Draco glanced at his watch. “That time already? Yes, let’s get the sign out and hope for some customers this afternoon.”
“I hope so. I’ll nip down to Madam Malkin’s once we’re sorted with the delivery, if that’s alright?” Harry said.
Draco regarded Harry carefully. “That’s not a bad idea. Considering we haven’t really offered these kinds of things before, it could be good advertising.”
A wall of gentle noise reached their ears. Muted chatter was mixed with gently clinking china from the café that was fairly close to the entrance, and the air smelled of a mixture of leather, wood polish and freshly brewed coffee.
“Me neither, but it makes sense when Valentine’s Day falls on a Sunday. No-one wants their flowers a day early,” Harry replied, shaking his head. “Even though they’re always perfectly fine.”
“Erm, yeah, here,” Harry replied, quickly locating the reel of red ribbon and throwing across the shop to Draco. “There’s not much left on it though. I hope the delivery comes on time tomorrow.”
got together.”
Charlie laughed before being interrupted by the roast chicken levitating onto the table. “Oh, looks like dinner is ready.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco said with a grin. “I’m only teasing. You know I don’t mind.”
At six-thirty, Harry was outside of Paperwhite’s, dressed in some of his smartest robes. He hadn’t chosen dress robes, but he wanted to look smart as he knew that Draco would be making an effort, and it was Valentine’s Day, after all.
Arlo shook it and smiled. “Hello, Mrs Weasley. Charlie’s told me about your delicious cooking, and I’m very much looking forward to sampling it.”
“Here we go,” Draco said, walking towards Harry, a small tray in his hands containing two tall latte mugs. “I just got us the same.”
Harry shook his head, pulling his own wallet out of his pocket, counting out his money. “Very reasonable, I’d say. Why don’t I come here more often?”
“So, this date?” Draco asked, looking over at Harry. “What exactly did you tell Weasley?”
“Why not?” Harry panted in reply as he gazed up at Draco, his eyes dark.
Harry nodded. “Please. I’ll tell you all about it while we set up.”
“It would help, but I suppose it’s not a necessity,” Draco replied with another shrug. “Unless they ask. But I don’t suppose they’ll want to know every little detail just now. Maybe decide on hair colour though.”
“Really?” Harry asked, looking up at him. “Then maybe we eat there tonight?”
“Nothing special,” Narcissa replied. “I asked the house-elves to make the quickest meal they could so we’re having cooked ham and eggs.”
“Really. It’s just another thing in the list of things you’re good at,” Ginny said with a grin. “Quite annoying really.”
Harry stepped back and watched as Charlie threw the powder into the fire, calling out the address of the reserve before he stepped into the flames and disappeared. Then, he cleared his plate and cutlery away, washing them quickly and leaving them to dry on the draining board.
“What’s his name, anyway?” Ron asked. “You just keep saying ‘him’. Do I know him?”
“Here’s the blanket,” Draco said, pulling a soft woollen throw down from the back of the sofa. He shook it out and spread it across both of their laps.
“Only a couple of weeks to go and the big day will be here,” Harry sighed. “At least we’ll get a few days rest then.”
that had been accosted by that dreadful dwarf.”
Harry groaned. “You could say that. Apparently my love life is, yet again, everyone’s top priority.”
“No. Never,” Draco said with a chuckle. “She’d never let me forget I’d said it.”
Harry chuckled. “Oh, yes. Complete surprise. But even that sounds like more fun than my family meals as a child. Let's not talk about them anymore.”
“I mean that I haven’t been entirely forthcoming either,” Draco replied. “I realised after a few months that I was looking forward to the dates too. For reasons that I suspect are similar to yours. However, I am apparently still in the Slytherin frame of mind. I couldn’t be brave and confess to what I was feeling for fear of rejection. I never told you any lies, though, I promise you that. I was more than happy to help you out and go on fake dates with you, and that hasn’t changed. I would do that again, because I don’t think anyone should be forced to go out with someone they’ve never met. It goes back to when my father wanted to marry me off to a pure-blood girl. I hated the idea of that and I thank Merlin every day that my mother put her foot down after I came out to her. Of course, the number of pure-blood families who would be willing to let their daughter marry a Malfoy drastically reduced after the war, which might have helped my cause. But the one thing I wasn’t honest with you about were my true feelings.”
“He didn’t really let me explain. I told him why I did it, but unfortunately he didn’t think it was a good reason,” Harry replied, shaking his head. “And he’s absolutely right. It was a terrible reason. I’m thirty years old, I should be able to talk to him about this, shouldn’t I?”
Before anything else could be said, the door swung open again and Charlie poked his head into the room. “Is it safe to come in here? No arguing going on?”
“Because of our history, of course! We’re now, finally, in a good place with one another. If I tell him that I think I’ve fallen for him, it’ll ruin it all,” Harry exclaimed, as though it were obvious.
“No, I don’t hate them. I probably never did,” Draco said, shaking his head. “But Blaise probably doesn’t realise that. It’s not like I’m best friends with Weasley now.”
“I’m not stupid, Pansy,” Draco tutted. “I only live ten minutes away. I knew what the weather was like before I left home.”
“Just saying,” Ron replied, holding one hand up, keeping hold of Hugo with the other.
“Whatever’s the matter, Harry?” Narcissa asked, her voice full of concern as she looked across at him.
“It’s alright Hermione, I’m over it now,” Harry said, smiling. “Just vet them a bit more in future, okay?”
“I suppose it’s not unheard of,” Draco mused. “In fact, I’m sure we’ve had mistletoe appear before when we’ve had flowers from that supplier. It’s always a task to make sure you don’t end up under it with a customer if it appears above the counter.”
Draco nodded. “Yes. Because if you hadn’t, then I probably would have run away. Even though I wanted you to kiss me. I don’t know how that mistletoe got there, but I’m grateful for it.”
On arrival, Harry pushed Draco onto the bed. Pulling out his wand, he muttered a spell that saw both of them divested of their clothes. Tossing his wand onto the bedside table, Harry climbed on to the bed, straddling Draco and gazing down at him. “You really don’t deserve anything, you know that, don’t you?”
“And you don’t want to go out with a top Quidditch player?” Draco said, raising one eyebrow.
Harry laughed and jiggled Hugo slightly. “I don’t think I’ll make much difference. How’ve you been?”
“Hi, Ron, what are you doing here?” Harry asked, looking up as the bell above the door chimed. He was alone as Draco had just gone out for lunch.
“See you soon, then,” Harry said, leaning in to give Draco a quick kiss.
,” Draco said. “I very rarely venture out of my flat outside of coming to work and doing my food shopping. But going on these dates with you has made me realise that people are starting to forget what happened… what I did. It’s not the same as it was straight after Hogwarts and it’s time I started realising it.”
being perfectly clean was frowned upon.
Shrugging, Harry pushed the thoughts out of his mind and headed back into the lounge. Looking at his watch, he decided that it wasn’t too early to go to bed and continued through the lounge, into the hall and up the stairs to his bedroom. Looking at his watch again, he doubled back on himself and went into the bathroom. He had a shower every morning before heading into work, but he hadn’t had a proper bath for what felt like ages.
“Alright,” Harry said slowly, nodding. “Alright, we’ll go tomorrow morning.”
“Not yet. I was hoping you could help me with that,” Pansy said, drawing her legs up underneath her as she sat down. “But not tonight. You know my tastes, and my colour scheme, so I’ll come into the shop and we can talk about it, yes?”
already apologised?”
“Wait, did you make this?” Harry asked, his spoon already in his hand. “From scratch?”
“The thought has crossed my mind,” Draco nodded. “But I didn’t give him a chance to explain properly.”
Draco looked down at the box, turning it in his hands slightly. “Well, I could only find an old ripped one, so I used a bit more magic on it to fix it up and make it look nice.”
?” Pansy scoffed. “That does not sound like the Draco Malfoy I know.”
Harry repeated. “Anyway. She somehow knew before I did and asked Charlie to talk to me. And that’s what we did, we talked and then talking turned into more and I realised that, apparently, I liked men a bit more than I liked women. Ginny was good about it, and that’s probably why we’re still good friends now.”
Harry laughed, feeling relief settle in his stomach. “I think I do too. It’s been an… eventful night.”
“Or, and this is probably a crazy notion,” Draco began, putting the sweeping brush back and picking up the mop and bucket. “You could just assume he’s a Muggle and not say anything until you know otherwise.”
“There should be some digestives in the biscuit barrel,” Harry said, nodding in the direction of the Snitch-shaped biscuit barrel that sat on the counter by the kettle. “Help yourself.”
“No, that’s true,” Harry admitted, nodding. “I mean, bits of it have been a bit dodgy but most has been good.”
“Oh, I see. Well, I suppose that’s fair enough. Still a bit daft though, given that you didn’t know where it was,” Draco said.
“Oh… no, I’ve, er, got another date,” Harry said, thinking fast and praying that Draco wasn’t busy that night. “The same bloke as before.”
“Psychic isn’t a thing,” Draco whispered.
“Show off,” Draco muttered with a grin.
Harry shook his head again. “Nope. I thought it was strange too. I even expected them to be a bit put out by it, but they didn’t seem to be. Hopefully they won’t be in such a rush to arrange any more dates for me.”
“It’s not her birthday,” Harry said slowly, eyeing Ron suspiciously.
“Here we are,” Draco said after a moment. “Ah. There’s only a sofa here. That’s okay, isn’t it?”
“I enjoy it,” Harry replied with a shrug. “It’s just the kind of thing I was looking for after leaving the Aurors. It’s a much more peaceful way of life.”
Molly took her place at the table, levitating the roast potatoes ahead of her. “Arthur, can you carve, please?”
“It might look strange to other people, but it doesn’t feel strange to me,” Harry replied, meeting Draco’s gaze. “We’ve spent so much time together over these last few years that I… I would miss you if we weren’t in each other’s company. What about you?”
Harry shrugged, flushing again. “Didn’t think to, I suppose. I didn’t think it would be as awkward to move as it was.”
“Sorry for calling, Charlie,” Harry sighed as he got a bit closer to the fire. “I’ve made a mess of things.”
Harry shook his head and lifted his own cup to take a drink as a knock came at the door.
“But you’ve moved past it. You’re such good friends now, surely you can see that?” Pansy asked, her brow creasing slightly.
“Oi!” Harry laughed. “There’s no need for that.”
“Well, that wasn’t my reason, but yes that’s a good point,” Draco replied. “I was thinking it could just be easier.”
Draco groaned slightly. “I love roast beef. Potter, if you’ve made Theo’s meal a disappointment, I swear I will hex your behind so hard on Monday.”
“I looked up the most romantic places in the world,” Draco shrugged. “And I couldn’t decide which one, so why not do all of them? Or, at least, most of them.”
“Well, none of us really told Mum our suspicions,” she said with a grin. “She would never have believed us anyway.”
“I see,” Draco said quietly, gazing down at Mr McGregor. He lifted one hand and carefully ran it along Mr McGregor’s back, smiling as the cat purred happily and leaned into his touch. He looked up at Harry. “We have to have him.”
Harry nodded, feeling heat rise in his cheeks. “Thanks. I’ll bear that in mind.”
“That does make sense,” Draco said, nodding his head slowly. “I suppose I didn’t realise it before.”
who enjoyed yourself… it certainly feels like you did…”
“I do. It’s possibly not as light-hearted as you might expect, but I think it’ll be a good one to read,” Draco replied. “Now, before I sit down, would you like a coffee?”
“Maybe,” Ron conceded with a nod. “I suppose this is what happens when we move on, isn’t it?”
“Just don’t fall asleep,” Draco replied with a grin. “I’ll be back in a minute.”
“Good. I’ll be back in a minute,” Draco replied, before leaving the room once more.
“Did you have to put such a powerful repelling charm on them? It took me ages to do it by hand,” Harry said.
Much to Harry’s surprise, the rest of the month passed without any more blind dates and he wondered if maybe Hermione had given up. She had been the only one arranging dates for him so far and given that she’d got it so wrong, he wasn’t holding out much hope for anyone else doing better.
“Maybe… I’ll talk to him and find out,” Harry said. “If he does want paying, I’m sure it wouldn’t be much.”
“No room for treacle tart?” Draco asked, one eyebrow raised as a smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth.
“What’s that?” Draco asked, frowning slightly.
“Which
“That is very true, but I still appreciate the thought,” Draco replied with another smile. “Isn’t it funny that we both chose something that has significance to us both?”
“Why not?” Draco shrugged, still smiling. “I told you. It’s International Kissing Day, and I think we should celebrate it.”
“I have to say, Harry, that it’s remarkable how you two get along now. You were always so suspicious of him,” Molly said. “I’m glad you managed to put that all behind you.”
“I’ll talk to Robards tomorrow,” Harry said, as his heart rate began to return to normal. “Tell him I made a mistake. There’s no way I can go without that for three months.”
“No idea. The dried bouquets seem to be taking off now,” Draco said as he made his way along the hall. “So we’re finding ourselves making more of those. I can fully understand why, though. They do bring a certain something to the look of a room.”
Draco sighed as he gazed out of the window. It had been drizzling on and off all day. Draco knew this because he had been sitting in the window ever since Harry left for work that morning. It was how he’d spent the majority of his days since he’d been put on sick leave. He wasn’t sick, he was
“Of course it is,” Draco replied just as a knock sounded at the door. He slid past Harry and went to open the door. “While you’re there, maybe ask her where she orders her ribbons from so we know for the future. I’m not sure our supplier will do the fancier kind.”
“Not for me. Things have changed since we were at school. Working with him for the last however many years has made me… appreciate him for who he is,” Harry replied. “If that makes sense?”
“Indeed we will,” Draco said, returning the smile. “I wonder what has happened to Jeremy and George since we were last there.”
Harry lifted his hands as he returned the kiss, one snaking around Draco’s waist and the other moving to cup the back of his neck.
Harry watched as the table and chairs grew bigger and bigger until they were full size.
“Yeah, good point. I’m just about done with the sweeping if you want to get the mop?” Harry said.
“Exactly. Hopefully this is just a precaution anyway,” Draco replied, stowing his wand away in its holster. “It might not be as bad as they think, I think it’s just because they’re not sure of the origin.”
Charlie kissed her on the cheek and led Arlo past her, taking the last two empty seats that were on Harry’s other side.
“Quarter to five,” Draco replied, glancing at his watch. “They did say they’d be cutting it fine to pick the bouquet up so don’t worry that they’re not here yet.”
“I’m only joking,” Draco said, pulling out his wallet and counting out the money to pay for their purchases. He handed it to the assistant and told him to keep the change, before turning to Harry. “The usual alcove?”
“I don’t know,” Ron admitted, shrugging. “Maybe someone with more of a wizard-y name or something.”
“There was a moment where I thought they weren’t going to
Harry stopped what he was doing and stared at Draco. “I… don’t know. Oh, Merlin, I don’t know! What if he’s a Muggle and I say something wrong?”
Draco gave her a smile. “Thank you. Again. You and Weasley will have to come for dinner one night so we can thank you properly.”
Draco grinned and did the same.
“No! I want to guess again,” Draco said firmly. “I’m not giving up.”
“Not as busy as when we arrived,” Harry said, putting the tray down on the table. “I got us each a chocolate muffin. They look lovely.”
Harry shook his head. “No. He’s our age, but he didn’t go to Hogwarts and he’s called Adam.”
“Harry doesn’t really like to talk about it,” Charlie said, turning to Arlo.
“To a certain extent, yes. He was never on the same level as Crabbe and Goyle, of course, but he was a close second,” Draco said, nodding.
Draco nodded. “That sounds perfect. I’ll be back from the Manor by then too, with buffet supplies.”
“Thank you. I’ll see you at work on Monday,” Draco said as he stood up. “Early start if you don’t mind.”
“Ah. Fair enough,” Harry chuckled. “What was the potion?”
Harry and Ron both nodded. “Yeah, sounds good.”
“I didn’t say that,” Harry said, shaking his head. “I was just saying I won’t take my time over it, so we can get along to Bookworms and Brews.”
Harry glanced at his watch and nodded. “Yeah, I’d better. I won’t be long though.”
Draco laughed. “It’s good to have a new place to get lunch, too.”
“I don’t know. It was a present from Pansy, so I doubt it,” Draco replied, smoothing the blanket out over his leg. “It’s very comfortable.”
“Do you know any bachelors?” Harry asked, frowning slightly.
The three Malfoys made small talk as they waited for their food to arrive, with Harry contributing occasionally with a nod or a murmured agreement. Once their meals had arrived, conversation stopped as they began to eat.
Draco grinned and shifted so that he could kiss Harry hungrily, pinning him to the sofa with one hand.
“Here, grab hold of this,” Draco said, holding out a large metal key half an hour later.
“Hello everyone,” Charlie said, giving them a wide smile. “This is Arlo.”
“Don’t be silly. It was no trouble,” Hermione said, smiling. “I trust you know how to administer it?”
“Right. Let me just check which one I did last,” Harry said, turning back to the bucket he’d just put down. “I forgot to cross it off with George interrupting me.”
“Have you honestly not minded doing this?” Harry asked, shifting so that he could see Draco.
Before Draco could say anything else, Alice walked back into the room with her arms full of soft black fur.
“Hm, I suppose I can forgive you. It’s not like you’re lying after all,” Draco replied, smiling. “Yes. Let’s see how much further we can get. What time do you want to be home for?”
Harry turned in the direction of the voice and smiled as he spotted Draco walking towards him. “Hi.”
younger than me!”
“Yeah, I think so. It just needs the bow attached properly,” Harry replied, turning the vase around so that he could check the bouquet from all angles.
“Barely any,” Draco replied. “So don’t worry. No-one is going to look at us and put us on the front page for reading this together.”
“But wouldn’t you rather go and… meet other people instead of keeping me company because I’m too afraid to put my foot down with people who try to set me up?” Harry asked, biting his lip slightly.
“You’ll find out,” Draco smiled as the key began to glow. “Oh, here we go. Keep tight hold.”
A few seconds later, Draco walked into the back room, two cups of coffee and a paper bag in his hands. “I thought you might want a Danish too.”
“Are you sure?” Harry asked, picking up a stack of buckets that needed to be returned to the delivery driver and moving them to the delivery door. “Won’t your mum mind?”
Harry frowned slightly before nodding his head. “Yes, please.”
“Harry, please. Just think about it,” Draco said, reaching out to pull Harry back down beside him. “I
“I’ll say,” Draco said with a sigh. “Sorry I disappeared. I didn’t want to stay and cause more of a scene.”
The room lapsed into a comfortable silence as they finished their dessert, including a second helping for Harry.
“Please take the egg,” Charlie said. “It would make me feel better.”
“The falcon that brought your note was a speedy little thing,” Charlie said, his head floating in among the flames. “Is this a bad time? I forgot about the time difference.”
“I know, let’s hope for a quietly busy day,” Harry replied.
Draco chuckled. “I do like this one, I think I’ve said before. I was just curious.”
Draco nodded, turning away slightly with a smirk. He hadn’t lied, exactly, but there was an element of wanting to cheer Harry up as well as pulling him out of his funk. “So, we have no preorders to make up today. What do you say we have a go at some of the dried flower arrangements?”
“Taking it slowly, eh?” Ron asked, grinning.
Harry turned to a page in the back of his notepad and frowned. “I haven’t thought about it. I just think about going out for coffee with you as friends.”
“What happened?”
warm. He supposed that could be because of the amount of books around too.
Conversation was lost as they moved together, their actions growing more heated and frantic as the minutes passed until they finally came with an almost simultaneous cry. Draco slumped against Harry, breathing hard against his chest.
Draco locked the door and pulled the security gate across before securing the padlock. He turned to Harry. “Well, have a good Christmas morning and I’ll see you tomorrow evening.”
“When you put it like that, I suppose I can. But do you really still hate the Weasleys so much?” Pansy asked, raising her own eyebrow in response.
Harry laughed. “Pansy gloating? Surely not!”
Arlo leant across to Charlie. “Is every dinner like this?”
Harry smiled and leant up to kiss Draco gently. “Whatever you want. Upstairs is good.”
A few moments later, the door flew open.
“Oh, really? That explains a lot,” Harry said thoughtfully.
“I do. Go and sit down,” Draco said, following Harry across the room.
“A little bit,” Draco replied with a sigh. “Are we expected to take anything with us?”
Harry grinned. “I am. I hope I’m not too early?”
“Well, yeah, but I’ve lived here for years,” Harry said. “I thought you’d maybe leave them at your parents’.”
“I didn’t realise it was the same person,” Harry said with a frown. “How could I not realise?”
“Yes, of course,” Draco nodded, putting his coffee down and picking up his copy of the book. “Let’s see what we make of this.”
“I know, I know she does,” Molly replied, sighing again. “I still worry about them all, that’s all. Thank you, Harry.”
“I know, I know,” Draco sighed. “I will tell her eventually, of course.”
Harry nodded. “Oh, yeah. I think we’ll both be too busy to have dinner before then. But afterwards, definitely.”
“Exactly. But don’t worry, now you’ve explained it, I understand,” Draco replied with a grin. “We just need to get the books and we’ll be all set.”
“This smells amazing,” Draco whispered, leaning over to Harry.
“Don’t worry. She’ll take it seriously,” Ron replied. “I’ll tell her to bring it straight to you.”
Draco’s face was impassive as he continued to eat and Harry cursed inwardly. Draco’s toes were continuing their tracing journey, repeating the motion that had caused such a reaction in Harry.
“He does. We keep each other on our toes,” Ginny said with a smile. “I just hope George and Ron understand.”
“Well, no, I suppose not,” Harry replied sheepishly. “But it’s still nice to hear.”
Draco shook his head. “No. If I tell you, it won’t be a surprise will it? It won’t take us long to get there from here, don’t worry.”
“No? What did you expect?” Harry asked, glancing at him as he resumed jiggling Hugo on his lap.
Harry studied the cover and nodded. “This might give me a few ideas for comebacks when I’m talking to Molly,” he muttered. “Have you read it before?”
Draco nodded. “Yes.”
Harry snorted with laughter. “So why were you dancing?”
“No, nothing’s wrong,” Harry muttered. “Just having trouble deciding.”
“Can I get something made up to take away with me?” Ron asked, looking up at Harry.
“So, how long do you think we’ll get to eat in peace?” Harry asked, picking up the menu.
“Er, yeah… are you busy Saturday?” Harry replied sheepishly.
“You did kiss me, though,” Draco said, eyeing Harry. “That was brave, considering.”
Draco threw a dead flower head at Harry. “You put the idea in my head.”
“Because I’m the one arranging it,” Draco said, giving Harry a look that said it was obvious. “There won’t be any uncomfortable small talk, or trips to juice bars. We’ll have a nice night.”
Draco sighed. “That’s no good. We need something more. Alright, so what’s your type?”
“Do you think there’s anywhere on the alley that will sell something like that?” Harry asked. “I want to make this a special bouquet.”
“I don’t know. I offered to leave the job, but he said no to that,” Harry continued with a shrug. “He did ask me to go in early, so I
“No, just yourself,” Draco replied with a smile as they continued to strip the flowers off the display unit. “I’ll do the rest.”
Harry continued into the back room and Draco could hear the cupboard door being opened and left to shut itself with a bang before Harry appeared behind the counter. “Isn’t the delivery here yet? How are we meant to get everything ready when they’re late?”
“What? Why would I want you to leave? Do you have any idea what my mother would do if you left?” Draco exclaimed, staring at Harry.
“I don’t know, we just normally have our own chairs,” Draco replied, glancing at Harry.
“Delivery’s here,” Harry said, standing up. “Let’s get it sorted.”
“Sounds good. I am intrigued. Have you gone for fact or fiction this time?” Harry asked, glancing across at him.
“Yes, I think we should, don’t you?”
“An auction of men,” Draco replied, shifting closer to Harry. “You know, like bachelors.”
“Not really,” Draco said as he hopped off his stool and headed for the back room to get the catalogue. “I have vague ideas about colours, but that’s about it.”
“Oh don’t be silly. The
“Yes, good point. Shall we open the wine?” Pansy asked, sitting up suddenly.
“I have no idea,” Harry said. “But I’d guess that they think I’m incapable of finding myself a date.”
Harry laughed. “I can’t blame you. Right, well, if we’ve got no more to discuss, should we get going?”
“Hi Molly,” Harry said with a smile as he moved to give her a kiss on the cheek. “I didn’t realise Charlie was coming too.”
Harry laughed. “I think I can stretch to that. The book is good, isn’t it?”
Harry laughed. “Dean would give us what we want. I don’t think he’d go rogue. But we could try magic first if you’d rather?”
“Alright. You go and get yourself ready. I shall have the house-elves prepare a quick meal,” Narcissa said with a smile. “Although I don’t know why you decided you had to come here to get ready instead of going home?”
Harry had told Hermione he’d love to join them before she left. Now it was Sunday and he was doubting his decision. Grumbling to himself, he got dressed in his nicest shirt and trousers, pulling on a smart jacket to complete his outfit and giving himself one last look in the mirror. His hair was, as always, untidy and he decided not to make any attempt to fix it. If this man was put off by his hair, well then, so be it. It would just be a sign that it wasn’t meant to be.
Harry snorted. “Well, I doubt there’ll be any of
“I can’t think of a better way to spend the morning,” Draco smiled. “Well, I
“I quite like this one too, actually,” Draco replied, sliding his arm around Harry as they got more comfortable. “It reminds me of childhood Christmases before things got weird.”
“I think we’ll be alright,” Harry said, glancing into the shop. “We’ll just see what looks good. We’ve got all the colours we’ll need so we must be able to come up with something that looks half decent.”
“I didn’t want to continue reading it without you,” Harry admitted, his cheeks slowly turning pink. “It’s our thing, so it wouldn’t have been right to come on my own.”
“True. But these are new designs, we have to take a bit of time over them to make sure we get them right,” Draco said with a chuckle.
Not bothering to towel dry himself, Harry padded back down the landing to his bedroom. He knew he would be dry by the time he got there, thanks to his Charmed robe. It had become one of his favourite domestic spells over the last few years, especially in the cold winters they’d had, as it meant he was never too cold after a shower or a bath. He yawned as he pulled his curtains shut, blocking out the streetlights that were visible in the square outside. Then he shrugged off his bathrobe and climbed straight into bed. It was as warm as his robe had been and he snuggled down into the duvet, letting himself drift off to sleep.
“I know you mean well, Pans. I really do. But trust me. It can go no further than a little crush,” Draco said with a sigh. “It’s for the best.”
“Yes. It would,” Harry smiled. “This place is perfect. I can’t believe that we haven’t been bothered at all. Not even when we went to the café counter.”
“I can’t wait forever for that though, Harry. I need something to take my mind off it,” Draco replied. “I want you to take me to that Battersea place tomorrow. I want a cat.”
“Well, when you put it like that…” Harry said, trailing off with a laugh.
Charlie smiled. “Don’t worry about it. Arlo and I were just finishing dinner, and now that we’re done, I’m going to go and find him for dessert.”
Harry nodded slowly. “That doesn’t sound like a bad idea, actually. It’s so close to Christmas now that it would be a bit… I don’t know, it would seem odd for us to break it to everyone now. Afterwards it might be easier for them to understand it. I don’t think we should change our plans for Christmas either. You should go to your parents as planned, and I’ll go to The Burrow.”
Harry laughed. “There could be worse things.”
friend,” Draco corrected him with a grin. “But it has been a pleasure. I hope you think so too.”
Together, he and Harry took turns in putting vegetables onto both of their plates and trading tureens with others at the table.
So, it was an even bigger surprise when George burst through the door of Paperwhite’s one Thursday lunchtime in early April. “Harry, my good man!”
Charlie frowned. “I’ll never understand the mentality of people who do that. Oh! Harry, this is Arlo,” he said, his eyes widening briefly.
“I hope you don’t call that a tune,” Draco said as he carried the mop and bucket back into the shop. “I’ve heard better coming from that thing Granger calls a cat.”
“No, I did think it might be more controversial. It was good though,” Harry replied, nodding. “It was nice to read about the wizarding views on sexuality. They’re much better than the Muggle views. Although the views on marriage are a bit more lenient, I think.”
“Of course. I think we should be alright though,” Draco replied, reaching for some of the flowers. “This will be a good way to tell if we’ve estimated right, anyway.”
Harry gave a soft huff of laughter. The blurb was short and sweet, and if he was honest, reminded him of himself and Draco. He could certainly see why it had grabbed Draco’s attention. Placing the book on the table again, Harry looked around. The atmosphere was just as cosy as it had been on his first visit. The wood burner was crackling away, making their alcove nicely warm. Strictly speaking, he thought it should be too warm for a wood burner to be on, but there seemed to be a charm at work to prevent things from getting
“Yes, exactly.
Harry laughed. “Draco, we’re living in a stone castle. It stands to reason that my
Harry laughed. “So do I, and I have every intention of making good on that.”
Draco heaved a sigh. “Alright, alright. If you insist.”
Before he could say anything more, the bell above the door chimed and they both looked around.
Draco groaned. “How can you think about dinner? I’m still full from lunch!”
an effort though.”
“No, somehow it doesn’t,” Draco replied, a slight frown appearing. “I don’t know how it doesn’t, I can only assume it was something the original owner sorted out and left in place.”
“I say we just go with basic ribbon. Let the flowers do the talking,” Harry said, making his way back to the counter. “Plain red or green, maybe? Green might be better, since we’re using red and white flowers. And red paper?”
“Impressive,” Harry said, nodding slightly. “Should I take my shoes off?”
?” Pansy demanded, leaning forward again. “Why are you so against being happy?”
“Good. Should we get cake?” Harry asked, his voice turning hopeful.
Draco smiled again. “Me too,” he replied, heading into the back room and putting the bouquets on the worktop. Then he made his way back into the shop with the sweeping brush.
“Yeah,” Draco replied softly.
“Draco, hello,” Theo said as Draco entered the room. He was already sitting down, but he jumped up to pull Pansy’s chair out for her. “Sorry I didn’t come out when you first got here. I couldn’t leave the gravy, I was just on the point of finishing the roux.”
“No I didn’t. Not because there’s anything wrong with you, before you say it,” Harry replied firmly. “Just because they’d wonder why I hadn’t said anything about you sooner. This way, all they know is I have plans.”
“Oh, I was never
Harry laughed as he began to mop the floor. “You could go once a month.”
“Doesn’t surprise me,” Harry said with a shake of his head. He reached under the counter and pulled out a fresh stack of flower wrap. “So what are you going to do tonight, seeing as you aren’t going to be painting the town red?”
Harry laughed as they began to walk towards the café. “Good idea.”
“Yes. You can go next time,” Draco said, slipping off his stool and heading for the door. “Usual?”
“We could plan it?” Harry suggested, turning his head in his hand to look at Draco. “Sketch it out?”
“Oh, don’t I know it. You’ve never been one to give up,” Draco muttered, shaking his head. “Have another go then.”
Harry shook his head, laughing too. “Listen to us. Once over, we wouldn’t have cared whether anyone thought we were doing a good job.”
“So,” Harry repeated, before taking a breath. “I like you. I’d like to see where this could go if we took it further. I know it could get awkward, with us working together, but I think we’d be daft not to give it a go.”
“I’ll call and get some on my way home,” Harry said. “I’ll bring them with me tomorrow and we can compare them while we’re going through the receipts.”
“I’ll look forward to it,” Draco replied with a smile, shifting across so that he could rest his head on Harry’s chest. “Should I warn my parents?”
Draco chuckled. “You raise a good point. Alright. On three, then?”
Draco took a sip from his mug. “Mm, that’s good. You were right, I think I did need this.”
Draco chuckled. “Fair enough,” he said. “Well, we’re both here now, so you won’t have to wonder any longer.”
“Well, rather you than me,” Ron said, also shrugging. “I know I couldn’t do it.”
Harry shook his head, closing the door behind him. “Don’t worry about it. He was alright by the time we left, although I’m not even sure how much of it he’ll remember in the morning. He said he’d had a fair bit to drink.”
“Only the best for the Malfoys,” Draco replied with a snort. “No, I don’t mean that as it sounded. It was a good turkey.”
“Yeah, it does help keep the peace at home when he’s happy,” Ron said with a laugh. “So, how did your date go the other night?”
“And you didn’t stay with her? What’s wrong with you?” Harry asked with a frown. “Why would you come to a party on your own?”
But now, as September began to wind down and the sun was lower in the sky, Harry found himself thinking of them as a couple more and more and he had to keep reminding himself that it wasn’t the case. He’d begun to realise that he actually found Draco quite attractive after spending so much time with him, and it scared him which was why, on the morning of the eighteenth of September, he was in the post office sending a letter to Charlie Weasley.
“This is the last box,” Draco said as he carried a large cardboard box into Grimmauld Place. “Then we can start unpacking them.”
“I may have gone slightly overboard,” Draco admitted, looking around. “But I didn’t know what you would feel like eating.”
“Oh, very clever,” Harry said, following Draco’s finger. “You know I call those baskets!”
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco replied, balling up the paper bag and throwing it at Harry. “Finish your coffee. The delivery will be here in a minute.”
“I’m so glad you could both make it,” Narcissa said, once everyone was seated. “It’s been far too long since we’ve had dinner together.”
Harry chuckled. “Fair enough,” he said as he handed a plate to Draco. “Here’s your sandwich.”
the time.”
“Presumably he didn’t tell her of his intentions,” Draco said, checking his watch. “Or she wouldn’t have arranged it. Come on, get out the back, the delivery will be here in a minute.”
Harry laughed and looked at him. “Really?”
“Do you really think so?” Harry asked dubiously. “Would you be able to trust someone who’d lied to you for months?”
“Absolutely,” Draco nodded, holding his plate out.
Harry grinned as they swapped tureens and before long, everyone at the table had piles of steaming vegetables and roast potatoes on their plates, topped with thick slices of roast chicken and rivers of gravy running down the sides.
Harry shook his head. “No, we didn’t. We managed to persuade him to go to an Italian restaurant that was still open for food, instead. He drank tonic water all night.”
The assistant nodded and began to get their order together.
“Oh. Well, sorry. I’m not here to buy anything, I’m afraid,” Hermione said apologetically. “Harry, Molly asked me to call and see if you wanted to come for dinner at The Burrow tonight? She meant to send Errol yesterday but he wouldn’t get off his perch.”
Harry laughed, piling some chips onto his plate. For all he enjoyed the Sunday roasts at The Burrow, pie night was also one of his favourites. As the pie dish made its way around the table, Harry reached for the tureen of garden peas and spooned some onto his plate, pushing his chips aside to make room.
Harry chuckled. “The rules of the game are easy. Playing the game is a bit harder. You can give up if you want, and I’ll tell you the answer.”
“I was thinking the same. We’ve only got a few chapters left,” Harry nodded, picking up his sandwich and taking a bite. He gave a satisfied groan as he chewed. “This
“Interesting. Anyway, tomorrow evening, will you be able to get away to my place for five o’clock?” Draco asked, glancing across at Harry.
“Hi,” Tim said as they shook hands. “Nice to meet you.”
Harry snorted softly. “It’s not. I’ve managed to put them off.”
Harry caught Ron’s eye briefly before nodding. “I get what you’re saying. I don’t drink a lot, I have to admit.”
“Oh, sorry, I didn’t mean to make you jump.”
“Here you go,” Draco replied, reaching over to the counter and grabbing one of the plates he’d laid out. “We can load them up and then go and eat at the table.”
from me.”
“No, I didn’t really know I had the date until lunchtime,” Harry admitted. “It’s a blind date, so I can’t tell you anything else because I don’t know anything else myself.”
“Yes, please,” Harry nodded, watching as Draco headed out of the shop and down the street towards Rosa Lee’s tea shop. Then, sighing, he slumped back over the counter. He was only there for a moment before he sat up again, slipping off his stool and walking around the counter and onto the shop floor. He walked around the displays, inspecting all of the plants and flowers. He nipped off any damaged leaves that he saw, and checked on the water level in each pot.
“He said to apologise to you for shouting,” Harry replied, stepping inside as Draco turned to walk back down the hall. “I think it was a bit of a surprise.”
“Oh, Harry, don’t be silly!” Molly exclaimed, suddenly seeming more like her usual self. “I never wanted to dictate your love life at all, I just wanted to be sure that you weren’t missing out on anything.”
“Well, I know that, I was here when Granger asked you,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes. “How did it go? Although judging by your demeanour so far, I’m assuming not well.”
Once he’d realised that he was starting to see Draco as a potential boyfriend, he’d panicked. He and Draco worked together and had become very good friends over the years, but how could he possibly admit to Draco that he’d like more, given their history? They were finally in a good place and he didn’t want to do anything to upset the balance.
“No, I haven’t,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Mostly because I’ve been so busy at work, I haven’t had time for much else. This lunch is a welcome break.”
Harry nodded, still smiling. “Yes please.”
“Did you go to the juice bar?” Draco asked, an amused look on his face.
Draco nodded, opening the box of dress robes and beginning to look through them.
Ron shook his head. “Nah, sorry, you’re on your own with this one” he said. “I’ll have to wash up tonight after we’ve eaten and given the kids their dinner. See you tomorrow.”
“Not a problem. Just let me know if you want me to slow down,” Draco said with a cheeky grin.
The Burrow was warm and welcoming when Harry arrived, and full of happy, excited chatter from the adults and shrieks of delight from the children as they opened their presents. Overnight, a light layer of snow had fallen in Ottery St Catchpole making everywhere look even more Christmassy.
Pansy gestured for Draco to go through to the parlour. “Do you think it will be?”
Harry sighed and turned to Ron. “Alright no, it’s not. He’s probably done it to get back at me for using his mug at breakfast this morning.”
“That’s not a problem,” Alice said. “We can lend you one to get him home, and you can bring it back to us.”
“Not too bad though, are they?” Harry asked, looking concerned. “They should be okay for another week or so by my reckoning.”
“What?” Harry asked, suddenly feeling self-conscious.
Before long they had reached the end of the chapter and Harry turned to look at Draco. “It’s getting good, isn’t it?”
Draco gazed around once more, scrutinising everything in the shop as he did so. “Peace Lily!” He said triumphantly, turning back to Harry, his eyes shining.
Harry laughed. “You didn’t have to do that. I could have done this without an egg.”
“No. It did not go well,” Harry said through a mouthful of pastry. “Tim, he was called. He was nice enough, they’re always
“The Healers will figure it out, I’m sure they will,” Harry said, patting Draco’s knee.
“They were, I’ll give you that,” Draco nodded. “You did a good job.”
Harry laughed. “I don’t know. If they were to suddenly jump off the shelf, I’m sure you’d catch them before they suffered.”
“What made you so sure?”
“Of course I did,” Harry sighed. “Like I said, I’m not great at this. I thought, well I don’t know what I thought. I’ll understand if you want me to leave Paperwhite’s.”
Harry nodded and began walking again, looking both left and right but finding only occupied alcoves.
“I would be if he wasn’t fucking comatose on his bed!” Draco exclaimed. He was trying not to panic, but he had no idea how long Harry had been in that state.
“They will. Things aren’t like they used to be,” Harry said. “Ron can even be civil to Draco when he comes in now.”
“Yes, Professor,” Draco said quietly.
“I’ll do the floor,” Harry decided. “I’ll do it quickly.”
“They’d be stupid to try if you’re sat there with him,” Ron said with a snort. “You know, once over I’d have been right there with them but having got to know him, he’s actually not as bad now.”
“It ruined my afternoon too, but probably not in the same way,” Ron replied with a sigh. “I got soaked on the delivery run.”
“Oh yes. Alright then… Pansy?” Draco asked.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at that. “What does he think of this place? Has he seen it?”
“Stop it at once, the pair of you,” Narcissa said. “We are here to have a nice meal. Now, we took the liberty of getting a bottle of wine already. We just need to order our food, so perhaps we should look at the menu.”
Harry laughed again and moved to join Draco at the counter and they both piled food onto their plates.
Draco snorted. “Fair enough. I suppose Quidditch players do have a bit of a reputation and that’s something that you don’t need now.”
Harry laughed and steered Ron towards the Apparition point that had been set up. “Can you make it home in one piece?”

As the crowd makes its procession into the manor—the rites won't be held in the catacombs, but in a ballroom, after which the casket will be sent to the catacombs as part of the funerary spells—Draco sees Blaise and Pansy walking ahead.

"Not quite sure where I stand, really."

Draco hesitates, but only once. He opens the photo album to spread it across both their laps.
They hadn't meant to grow fond of each other in those weeks away from everyone and everything. Draco certainly meant to kiss Harry by the time he did, though, and certainly meant to invite him to his lodgings, and Merlin, he might have meant to fall in love with him, too.
The tone of the article, if one could call it that, was grossly salacious, especially when the author bragged of how
"Harry?" Draco calls through the small house, and wishes he could quiet the sound of his heartbeat as he listens hard for a response. Nothing.
And then, because he's grown manners over the last few decades,
Draco spends the rest of the day poring over the file Potter's given him. Loaned him. Whatever. He doesn't have that lamp in yet, nor can he cast his own spells, but Auror Larch is only too happy to cast a
But he can't think about any of those things. He can only think of putting his hand on the door to the shack, which doesn't have a door knob so much as a hole to pull it by.
under that. Everyone close enough at the Gala will see them, with only mesh and thin gauze between them and the world.
"Morning, Harry," says a voice Draco doesn't recognize at all. "Had a bit of a mixup with the milk, but we couldn't get you on the phone, so we hope you don't mind the replacement."
Draco shows them his wand. When they react with mild horror, he explains that no, it's fine—Harry Potter has gotten the Trace taken off him for the time being. He can perform as much magic as he likes. And he shows them that, too.
in a war that could have been
Despite the medical hydration charm, her lips are cracked and dry, and she shows him why when she swipes a sticky tongue across them. She's been muttering something this whole time, he realizes, and he leans closer.
"There aren't enough chairs out here," Blaise announces as he enters the yard with his cup of coffee, and duplicates the wicker furniture around the unlit fire pit until there's enough seating for all the adults behind him.
"Fairly pure, don't worry," Harry says. He picks up something Draco can't see past his robes, and beckons Draco right back out to the front steps. "Off we get."
Potter clears his throat. "Er. Well, what I was going to say," he says, as Draco inserts another pin into fabric, "is that I've got a plus one for the Gala?"
"Sorry." Harry's hand finds its place wrapped around Draco's. Draco checks Harry's handiwork; Hermione and Ron are one seat closer to the Minister, putting Harry's placard between Draco's and Ron's.
"I don't think I know how to dress you, Potter," he finally admits, murmuring in the isolation of the empty atelier.
There is no sex. Draco's fantasized about it, there's no mistake about that, but if he's resolving to enjoy Harry, then he's going to savor things. "You have work in the morning," he says as he adjusts his robes, and flicks his half-lidded gaze over to Harry to let his words be transparent.
"How depressing," Draco remarks. He's being flip, at first, and then as Potter's words process a second time—actually, yeah, that is depressing. Draco marks at Potter's shoulders—they need more ease than he thought—and wonders if now's his chance to finally ask why Potter's hermited away all these years. As unsociable as he seemed in their first meetings, he's certainly friendly enough now, if that lunch is any indication.
"Can you say it?" Potter asks, his eyes hooded in a way that makes Draco feel cornered.
I have so painstakingly made, and you're going to let me do my work!"
"Read the room, Harry!" Draco groans. Instead of the fanfare of presenting Harry with the eyeglass case and letting him open it up himself, Draco snaps the case open and grabs Harry by the shoulder to still him. Harry's so surprised that it works, and Draco slips the new frames onto his face with both hands. "It was supposed to be a surprise."
"What, to see Potter trespassing again?" Draco chuckles.
"Oh, Harry, we thought you were dead! I can't believe it's you!" She squeezes him tight again, as if to prove to herself again he's really there. "I'm so sorry, Harry, we all gave up on you, and you were here all along!"
"Yes! Hermione told me to make it, and I—"
Potter doesn't say anything in return, but the silence that surrounds them feels companionable rather than cold.
"Careful," Draco says, catching Harry's hand quickly. "I'd appreciate
"You know, I think I'll see you at the pub tonight," Malfoy replies. He takes a step back, smirking as he clasps his hands behind his back. "Au revoir, Potter." With that, and a resounding crack of displaced air, Malfoy is gone.
"Right, I knew that," Draco huffs, hiding behind an even bigger, sloppier stack. "I appreciate it, Head Auror Potter, but the manor is well-stocked with desks, and my work doesn't demand the sight of you wiggling your wand about in front of me—" He goes beetroot red behind his armful of parchment and he keeps it up like a fence. "I can work alone!"
"It's not even noon." Draco watches as a rocks glass fills itself with three fingers of whiskey, neat, and flies gracefully across the room into Potter's grasp. "Don't avoid my question."
The dining room is bereft of its table and chairs, leaving a massive space for Draco to work. Of course, having a table as large as the one he remembers having been in here would have been beneficial, given that all the work left on Harry's ensemble is in the details, and he tells Harry so without thinking much of it. Draco excuses himself to the lavatory, and when he returns, Harry is wrestling with the exact angle at which to float the dining room table back into the room.
Harry shrugs. "I dunno. Anything you like, I suppose." And as Draco's heart begins its awful plummet, he goes on, "We could go on holiday, after I've quit my horrid job. Spend a little bit more than a few hours in the great outdoors together."
"Not as chilly as you'd think," Harry replies.
Draco is startled away from listening to Dendron's interview. "Like what?" He knows full well
Draco can't help but laugh. "Only if you weren't paying attention."
He's taken too long to answer. Potter flushes, eyes half-lidded as he turns away. "Sorry, I—"
"Not in school, I mean."
Harry swallows. "Will you hold my hand again, Draco? Please?"
"S-sure, yeah." Harry is adrift in the waters of this conversation; this Draco Malfoy, penitent and soft, somehow even self-aware, defies everything Harry's learned about him growing up together.
"Ron! Ron, I can't—you're crushing your wife!" Hermione's muffled voice comes from between the two men.
my flat, you arrogant prick." Draco's voice is a sweet murmur despite his words, as he considers the fit of the armhole of the linen robe.
"Why the 25th anniversary?" Draco asks, before he can stop himself. "I don't recall hearing about your miraculous resurfacing for the 20th."
bollocks story!"
"We'll take the lifts," Draco says, quickly. He starts to pull away, but Potter's other hand is suddenly gripping his wrist, a vice keeping him in place with such strength Draco nearly stumbles. He hasn't let go of his wand, either, and the wood of it feels like it's burning Draco's skin with its magic. He hasn't had this much contact with a wand since—well, since Potter had put this same wand to his throat, but not for fifteen years before that.
"You put milk in it." Draco crinkles his nose in distaste. "Milk clouds the flavor profile."
Lily looks up then, tucking a springy lock of hair behind her ear, where it won't stay. She looks more like Harry than Draco, with her brown skin and curly black hair, and her inky dark eyes are all her own. Of course, any ways she looks like either of her fathers are as coincidental as her name. It was no cakewalk, applying for parenthood while Harry dealt with the extremely public fallout of quitting the Aurors and looking for a new, much less dangerous career, but the adoption finally went through three months ago.
"Hold still." Draco no sooner gives the warning than he's pulled Harry's glasses off with both hands, a gold eyeliner pen in hand. He's got to give it to the Muggles—they really know how to make makeup convenient. "Close your eyes."
"You should go upstairs," Potter says, which is not an answer.
"Upstairs?" Draco parrots. "What, is the one right there haunted?"
are."
"I don't know if—"
"Ugh, there must be a better term than boyfriend," Draco says breathlessly, propping himself up over Harry's chest once they break away. "I'm in my thirties, not thirteen. And it sounds so
"I can't imagine anyone but you would give a damn, frankly." Harry shucks his Levis off, making a pile of clothes on top of his boots that he finishes off by pulling his socks off by the toes. "I'll bet you only looked it up because you felt stupid every time someone called you that."
"Oh," Harry says, with a gentle chuckle, and reaches up to push a hand through his thick hair. The right hand, with its scars across the knuckles, and the indelible words from fifth year. "It's—well, it's actually this. At work, I just... It's a charm I cast, but it gets—wobbly, sometimes."
of all people. What a wake up call.
Draco finishes his piled-up work late, the last one in the atelier again, and bids his work on Potter's robes goodnight. He'll have to come in early to work on them, his body aching with the length of today. He shouldn't have pulled that little stunt with falling to his knees at Twelve Grimmauld.
"Hullo, Gran," Hugo says, pushing his sister away and grumbling. "Just wanted to see how the food's going."
"It’s not stupid, but you're drunk," Draco says gently, though it seems Harry's fit has sobered him up a good deal. "And you weren't ready for this."
He finds he suddenly can't go in the kitchen anymore. Draco looks at the table and his body seizes up, pain blossoming in all the places it remembers Griselda opening him up. Another one of Dr. Fiddlewood's ghosts that lives in the manor, keeping him from yet another part of his childhood home.
“With the greatest respect, you don’t know the meaning of the word,” Draco snorted. “I can’t remember the last time you just sat quietly reading. You didn’t even sit quietly while we were doing our homework at school. Constant chatter.”
“I think I might have that too,” Harry said, turning to look at him once more. “They’re always really good.”
“Ah yeah, good point,” Harry said with a nod of his own. “You wouldn’t want to drop anything on the book.”
“Just how is that supposed to help me, Potter?” Draco tutted, slapping Harry’s thigh with one hand. “If anything, that makes me
“I know. I arranged a date for him on Valentine’s night with someone I know through work,” Hermione said. “But it turned out that all he was interested in was Harry’s fame.”
Harry laughed. “Don’t worry about him. He’s not as bad as he likes to make out. Anyway, it’s not like you don’t know them all.”
“Oh? You’re going to cook for me, are you?” Draco replied.
“Mm, well, be careful,” Harry said, a slight frown creasing his brow.
Harry groaned. “I know, don’t remind me. Although I suppose I should be glad that it’s not Christmas that’s coming up.”
Ginny shrugged. “Of course we did. If you’d have broken this news before Christmas, I’d have won an extra five Galleons.”
“Alright, fair enough,” Ron said with a nod. “So you think it’ll get that far?”
Harry shook his head and glanced at Draco who was trying to hide a smile. “Don’t you start,” he muttered, poking him in the side. “It’s not like I’ve done this before.”
Harry nodded, biting his lip slightly. “Does it look alright? I know this is usually your department but I thought I’d have a go.”
“It’s nice and private,” Harry said, looking around briefly before reaching for his sandwich. “I dunno, it’s just cozy and homely here. Maybe it’s just because this is where we sat that first time.”
“If you like.” Harry grinned. “It’s been so long since I’ve spent Christmas
Draco grinned. “Good. I wanted to give you something different, but enough to avoid being boring. And yes, yes they are. I have fallen asleep here more than once.”
“I do know how to protect things, you know,” Harry sniffed. “I’m not a complete idiot.”
“Like I said, it’s been quite obvious over the last few months how close you’ve become,” Hermione said. “We would have been more surprised if you
“Here you go,” Draco said as he arrived back at their alcove. “Chicken salad on brown and a latte.”
“Yes, I think so,” Draco replied with a nod as he tied a neat white bow around the base of the centrepiece he was working on. “We’ve done thirty, they asked for twenty, so I think we’re covered for any mishaps in transit.”
Charlie nodded. “Good to hear it. What is it you’re doing these days?”
“I’ll probably be going mid-morning, so I’m there to do some present opening and then have lunch,” Harry said. “I usually stay until late evening, but I can leave earlier than that.”
The moment that Draco shut the door behind them, Harry was upon him, pinning him to the door. “Did you have fun?” he asked, his mouth millimetres from Draco’s ear and his voice low. “In the restaurant?”
Harry settled himself on the sofa and put his glass down on one of the coasters that sat on the table beside it. He gave a content sigh.
“Oh, shush,” Pansy muttered and Draco felt a sharp, stinging pain on the back of his hand.
“Are you saying I can’t be quiet?” Pansy asked, a look of outrage crossing her face.
“We’d better put this away,” Draco said, glancing at his watch. “We need to get closed up. We can do some more tomorrow.”
“He told me that he loves Quidditch. That’s it. I don’t know what team he supports or anything else,” Harry sighed. “I know I do. Don’t worry, I’m not accepting any more dates after this one.”
Pansy followed him into the room and settled herself into a corner of the sofa, pulling her feet up beside her.
Draco snorted but nodded. “Alright. Sounds good to me.”
“Trust me, if I could have swapped places with anyone at the time, I would have,” Harry said. “I wanted no part of it. Anyway, enough of that for now. Do you like your present?”
“You have a lab in here?” Harry asked, his eyes widening.
Draco laughed. “Yes, I do, luckily. Alright, now we’ve exchanged presents, let’s get settled for this show on the wireless.”
