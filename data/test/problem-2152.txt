She nodded standing up. Suddenly there was a great light and a shower of glitter fell on them all. In Bella's place stood a beautiful hawk. It slowly circled the group before landing in Edward's lap.
"I don't know what safeties Dumbledore placed on this spell" she replied "if I move to quickly I could kill him."
Books and wand holsters were next with the Boys getting one on their forearm and Hermione getting a thigh holster. After lunch Severus showed them to the apothecary and made them a personalized potions kit to his standards.
The morning of the trial came with Bella dressing in her official high priestess dress; meanwhile, Sirius and Remus were able to find traditional Peverell robes for Harry to wear. As the victim’s mate Draco was able to attend this session.
She then handed him an orb, "Give this to my brother, it has all the information needed to move forward. We will also need to floo directly to Hogwarts."
“Edward and someone else can sit with us,” Bella replied as they were handed the keys, “the cars sit five.”
Severus and Lucius were next as they were shown a room themed after the forests. The black marble furniture was accented with green walls, couches and a golden bedspread. Draco and Harry were shown their room to represent a volcano. Like the previous it to had black marble but this room was accented by fiery reds and oranges. Alice and Jaspers room could be either water or air as the room was made in colors of silver, ivory, and blue. Finally Sirius and Remus’s room was modeled after the earth with rich brown and green tones throughout it.
"1095 years old. My mate was born in 1901 and died, or so i thought, in 1918" Bella replied looking straight at Edward.
"well that was close," Sirius said, " While I order breakfast why doesn't everyone take turns getting ready"
"Well," Bella said, "I suppose I had better get ready. Time to make an entrance." she went into her room and changed into a Green ballgown with golden leaves. Upon closer inspection you can see Emerald chips in the dress and the leaves are pure gold. On her head was a golden circlet with oak leaves.
"I have studied the remains of the potion and the processed used to revive Tom," Severus stated to the others,"but I cannot for the life of me say that it caused the reaction."
“Kreacher,” called Sirius, “you can join them if you wish or you can join the household crew. Just ask the head house-elf where you are needed.”
Standing up and gently urging Chrissy to go stand next to Lily, Harry decided to try Eddy. "Eddy, you want to try it?" he offered.
Suddenly it was the day that Harry was meant to be rescued. He had let it slip to his cousin and aunt beforehand to ensure that they would be out of the house at the time. Luckily at that time Petunia was set to look at apartments so she and Dudley would already be out, that afternoon after Vernon had left for work and lunch had been settled Harry was quick to pack up all of his gear everything of value that was in his trunk. His Aunt Petunia also surprised him by bringing down Lily and James's trunks from the attic.
For the rest of the Summer each of the couples spent as much time as possible together exploring the manor and the surrounding grounds. On occasion when not in the Manor, Bella would complete her duties on Avalon she was able to meet with the creature council and discuss what was happening in the wizarding world. While the Volturi were on the council they agreed that the Cullens would act as their representatives.
A couple weeks later they apparate to Diagon Alley with Sirius, Remus, and Harry being disguised. The first thing they did was visit the Magical Optometrist and get Harry's eyes fixed. This further pissed Sirius and Remus as they learned that Harry had not only never gotten the right glasses but that his vision was getting worse because of them.
"They have?" Sirius asked "you would've thought Ron would have a problem with that knowing how hot headed he is as well as your family's feud"
"Go back for two weeks," Severus said "Then Lucius and remus and some of the cullens will go and stage a death eater attack. Take him to Foxwood Manor its completely off the grid."
Honored Houses: Slytherin, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff (holds 2 votes on the Wizengamot) (ALL TRUE NEUTRAL)
"Who is that? How do you all know her? And how soon as she going to be here and has she agreed to help us? I can't let Harry die Uncle Severus"
"I'm sorry?" Edward looked confused, he hadn't been expecting this reaction when he pictured the conversation in his head.
“That’s fine with us,” Carlisle said, “We should easily be able to follow. Do you mind if one or two us sit with you just in case?”
“Bloodquill exposure for at least 4 months, he got detention for 4 hours every 2 or 3 days. On top of that from the tests that Sev and Sirius have done he has about 80% of his core blocked. Physical abuse and malnutrition spanning from when he was about 2. Finally his mating with Draco has not been able to be completed.” Lucius said from the back seat.
“Here would be our room,” she said as she opened the door. The room was a celestial playground of stars, constellations, and otherworldly shades. The stars of the zodiac seemed to spin slowly around the ceiling, as if it was a window to peer directly at the cosmos. The stars along the walls glittered and winked awake, as if they had sensed the new person’s presence. All of the furniture, including a gorgeous vanity next to the bed, sparkled in bright gold, copper, and silver, and the king-sized bed was decked in fabulous, sensual silk colored in indigo.
"Draco this kitten is for you. He is a Blue Russian will have the same lifespan that you do." She then pulled out a black asp, "harry here is your familiar. These familiars will share your lifespan and after you two bond they will not onluy be able to communicate with each other."'
It was with a sigh of relief that the fifth years put down their quills for their final exam.  While some like Ron were relieved Draco and Hermione immediately started worrying about their scores. Harry somewhat in the middle tried to reassure them.
"Delores Jane Umbridge" He started, " You stand accused of twenty counts of child endangerment, misuse of a magical object,, child abuse, and attempted mureder. Should you be found guilty you face a life sentence in one of the most secure wings of Azkaban. How do you answer to these crimes."
Bella let her Glamour drop showing her eyes, pointed ears, changes to her hair and face, and tattoos. She looked at Edward to gauge his reaction.
"Your Royal Highness," he responded, "may your hand never falter. I shall get the bank president for you."
Lucius was escorting the other governors, minister fudge, amelia bones, and rufus scrimngor through Hogwarts on a surprise inspection of professor umbridge's new methods.
Everyone left assuring Sirius they would keep an eye out. Hermione leaves with the Weasleys assuring they will keep in touch for the summer by the mirror sirius gave them. After everyone leaves sirius packs grimmauld including Harry's letter and locks it down. He and Remus each apparate to Foxwood Manor and enter the wards.
"And how long do they live" Rose asked worriedly "she wasn't sure about getting pregnant if she would lose the child eventually"
".....and i had better not see any marks or anything on him" they heard her say. The Golden Trio looked in horror as they could see Vernon's face start to turn red.
"but wouldn't harry be in more danger or more detentions" Ron asked, "she targets him even when he keeps his mouth shut."
"May I," Bella asked knowing Draco would be on edge. With a quick glance to his godfather Draco turned back to her and nodded. Kneeling down by the couch she placed a hand on Harry's head and heart.
"Originally," she started, "I first came to know Lucius. He was about ten years old and was at one of the Yule parties held by some mutual friends. Through him i met Severus and eventually Tom. Not as you may know him Harry but as he was originally. He was a Charismatic and kind man. But not necessarily a good one, growing up in the orphanage and then Dumbledore supplementing the abuse here caused him to have a temper. Still I as a fey felt protective over him. All of them really."
smirking she said, "faerie elf, not uncommon that they mate with wizards or witches. However its diluted so it probably came from Lily's background not James. At least given the eyes."
"My name is Arabella Easton; High Priestess and Heir to Avalon/Ambassador to the Wizarding world/Healer and teacher of magic, Daughter of Lord Oberon and Lady Titania High King and Queen of the Faerie rulers of Avalon/Sister to Jareth the Goblin King and Puck the trickster" Bella said a sick smile growing on her lips,"and you madame Umbridge are toeing a very dangerous line"
"now for the students these will be at random and as such titles are needed" Kingsley stated " Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy, Cho Chang, Luna Lovegood, Neville Longbottom, Ron Weasley, Denis Creevey, and Blaise Zabini"
"Before we begin the trial" Madame Bones said, "regrettably Lord Potter as you are a direct victim you will have to abstain your votes"
hey quick note i changed how bella looked because i found a model and i prefer real people to drawings. Love the pics.SO THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PICTURES AND OUTFIT CHANGES. this is for a reason and since its my work its my deal if you dont like the pics sorry not sorry.
Everyone sat down; Esme, Carlisle and Edward on the couch, Rosalie and Alice on the love seat with their mates standing behind them, and Bella sitting in the highback chair facing them.
"Of course" Severus sighed acting more tired than he was.  As dumbledore ended the call the others came out of hiding.
"you'll get used to it," she shrugged turning to the giant Slytherin head on the wall and started speaking parcel tongue and three doors opened. The first door led to the living quarters, the second to the personal library and lab, and the third was the sitting area.  She quickly showed the Cullens to their rooms and the others to the seperate bathrooms. Meanwhile Sirius called dobby and kretcher.
Walking out of the library and nursery, the group found the kitchen behind the large, twirling staircase. It was oddly modern and enormous, with granite countertops, black tiles, and silver cabinets. Yet even with some modern technology – a gas stove, a coffee pot, and refrigeration – they could still feel magic sparkling around the kitchen. As they saw the houses elves and pixies bustling about cooking food for tonight.
Dumbledore was all for this as he figured it was a way to get her under his thumb. Meanwhile in their spare time Severus, bella, and sirius finished the potion to cure Tom.
"Its mine" Bella said "Completely off the grid it is located in the moors on the border of the fey world. Remus and Lucius know the way."
Everyone else then got dressed with the males, not the students, changing into suits and nicer robes, and the women putting on dresses.
“Quite a few my lady” Lucius stated “Severus Snape for Lord Prince as his inheritance was apparently hidden from him”
"She can very easily be able to drive to diagon alley as well as the people she's with and you can just leave the cars they are the rental company will come pick them up again"
The living space smelled and felt like a dark, cozy dwelling, all while never losing its grandeur. Black, velvet couches sat over a thick, carpeted floor around a heavy, mahogany table. A lit fireplace whistled and winked at the new occupant, as did an enormous painting of the round table and its occupants on the wall.
“Then this is an easy fix wouldn’t you say everyone” Bella stated as Sirius went to claim his seat. The same purple light enveloped him as he took the Black seat.
"excellent," Bella said with a sly grin "well then introductions can wait until results are done. please proceed"
"Never been able to open them", she said "so I don't know what's in them. It might honestly be nothing"
so real quick for timeline sake, i am changing the years to where it is harry potter timeline. also to fit into the whole birthday scenerio i am changing bella's birthday to be DEC 21st the winter solstice.
They made it in a good thirty minutes before the doors closed enough time for Lady Longbottom to find them and begin a conversation.
we are starting the story after yule holiday 5th year so the dates corresponding to the chapters will be posted at the beginning of each chapter.
"hem, hem" Delores Umbridge started "surely this is not the correct method to do so. should them memories not be viewed in private?"
"to true Lucius" Amelia said nodding, " I did not like the idea of installing ministry workers into Hogwarts as I believe they should remain separate. But Albus gave us no other alternatives."
The Wizengamot is wizarding Britain's high court of law and parliament. It predates the Ministry of Magic itself, dating back to the days of the medieval Wizards' Council. Its administrative headquarters are located in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement of the Ministry of Magic, whilst the trials take place in the dungeons of the lower levels.
Ok guys i really need the votes for the mpreg stuff. While the pregnancy chapters are some of the last the sex scenes are coming up. Please comment even uf you are just a guest and let me know
“Yes Professor Sprout said the same on her evaluations” Augusta stated, “Oh looks like we are starting”
"What your nose giving you trouble already remus," they turned and saw bella smirking, "I thought the full moon just passed."
"Hiya Harry," she said suddenly latching onto his arm "I hope we will see you alot this summer. I hear Dumbledore is going to have you come to the house early this year."
They went to the pair of Peugeot Rifters; Bella, Lucius, Remus, Edward, and Emmett climbing into one and the others climbing into the second one.
"Bull-Fucking-Shit! Edward," Bella said staring at him, "If you think that i or my mind are that fickle then you never new me in the first place. But thats the truth isn't it you don't know me."
"I agree" Bella said, "have the heads of house secretly interview their students then gather the evidence. In a few days Lucius can 'suggest' that Fudge and the governors come to Hogwarts to see the progress she has made. Perhaps make sure that Amelia Bones and Rufus Scrimengor are there. We can play a little memory movie. There is no way that either of them can get out of that."
"Well since we don't learn anything," Draco said " the least we could do was spend the time studying more important subjects"
At the end Bella began to sway and her eyes rolled into the back of her head. Before she could collapse Edward quickly rushed to his knees to brace her.
"Kingsly" she said "If you will please escort Delores umbridge to a cell she is under arrest for assault with a magical item, attempted murder, and possession of an illegal item."
Then Bella turned back. "Myself and my brothers each have a bird form. I am a hawk, Puck is a raven, and Jareth is a barn owl. Although the transformation can be messy sometimes. I would keep an eye on you each time the Cullens went hunting"
"On another note" Lucius responded, "We really should deal with Umbridge and Harry's detentions now rather than later. She is getting harsher in her detentions and I personally don't want to risk as session where it actually is him. Otherwise we may be back where we started."
"Its Harry, he is hurt badly and I won't be able to save him. Not like this. The issues i addressed in my letters have gotten worse as well. Its time for you to step in."
"There are two answers for that the first is the the chief warlock takes the votes of any unclaimed houses however there is a duty to report when that seat is claimed. As such Dumbledore has committed Line theft by not bringing up the houses of potter, black, etc"
The next meeting started with Dumbledore bringing up what happened to Vernon dursley and the house being destroyed. Immedietly the room was in uproar.
Everyone spent the rest of the day exploring the Chamber and just talking. They were interrupted when a cat patronus came in."
“Tinsel,” she said, “please take our luggage to the Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts, then I want you and five other elves to start cleaning and prepping the rooms. There is a dead Basilisk in there I want you to separate all of the parts into their correct containers and put them in the potions lab. The bags are marked please put Esme/Carlisle in the same room, then Alice/Jasper, Rosalie/Emmett, and Edward and myself.”
Span to each of the kids opening their OWL Letters. Attached to each of the OWL results was also a letter from the board of governors.
Tom Riddle/?/? Yes this will be a male 3 some and it will be revealed later in the chapters I just need to know what you think of that kind of pregnancy and if you also yes I already have the person in mind so you don't have to worry about that
She turned to the Cullen’s and made introductions. After they were made everyone went the luggage area to their things and started to head to the rental area.
"Cast every healing spell you can think of" Severus said as he prepared the calling ritual, "and pray"
"So now i need to pass the tradition along" she said as he began to investigate Edward. She took the pet carrier from Mossbone and handed Draco a grey kitten.
“Everyone’s things are already inside however they are not unpacked as the house-elves did not want to interfere,” Bella said, “If you wish them to do it later they can or you can do it yourselves either way.”
"that's a great idea" Harry agreed "but how will we get all the way to moaning Myrtle's bathroom without being seen by someone"
“I believe you mean Heir Potter” Lord Burke opened his mouth again to state “He has not yet reached the age of majority.”
While Tom had come back in Harry's forth year looking completely normal it was clear something was not right with the caring and powerful man they all followed, however they were not sure what could have caused it.
As the twins stepped forward into the seats they seamed to glow in purple light and the magic accepted them as true. The emblem of the Prewett household lit up on the head of the chairs.
" I suppose i wanted to make it easier on Lily and James and thought if I could bring Severus into the group then everything would fall into place"
all weekend." Severus remembered their excuses easily," I would assume that Draco has been in his dorms"
"Forgive our intrusion," Ophelia Strongborn one of the governors said, "we are here for a surprise inspection of all teachers."
"shadow travel" Bella replied, "its the only way besides mirrors that i can do so. Puck and Jareth can jump between planes"
Meanwhile throughout the rest of the summer Lucius and sirius spent the time teaching Draco, Harry, and Severus all about how the wizengmot worked.
As they walked down the aisle the Cullens were able to get quick glances of the goblins without staring. Not realizing that they had reached the front however, Emmett almost ran Alice and Jasper over.
"No" severus said "But it is for Slytherin. That is Salazar Slytherins locket which has been missing for three generation."
"Essentially the reason why you can't get pregnant is because the body freezes at the time of your change. From puberty till death a male is the same they always have the ability to carry children unless something is medically wrong with them. A female however, As you obviously know goes through cycles of Fertility vampire venom acts as a permanent birth control if you will. What my gift allows me to put my power is,is that essentially I make your uterus human I guess I'll be the best way to put it. You will get pregnant then the baby will be sustained on blood it will be a fully vampire baby without being an immortal child it will age it will learn it will grow and it will do so at a slightly faster rate"
"On that note Severus why don't you gather the necessary memories," Bella said, "try to see if you can sneak some from Umbridge so she can't say they were faked"
After Scorpius had been born, Draco realized just how much he loved children, which was a surprise as much to himself as it was to anybody. Who would have thought that Draco Malfoy was really rather paternal? And maternal as well, coincidentally, considering Astoria's atrocious lack thereof. Regardless, he'd wanted more children to love and Scorpius to grow up with.
He just scrunched his nose again and shook his head at him. "That's okay. You can keep it. I've got lots. My dad had them made for me last Christmas," he said with a small smile.
They talked a bit more in depth about the Wizarding World, seeing as how they were going to be more intimately acquainted with it now. When the children showed signs of waning, Marianne decided it was time to go.
"I focused on the love I have for them and the love they gave to me, and every day the hurt got a little less; a little better," Narcissa said quietly staring off into the darkness. "Focus on something else, dear," she told Hermione. "Focus on your beautiful children and your amazing husband. They love you dearly, no matter what. They will continue loving you, no matter what."
Lily giggled as he finally gave up and just contented his self with curling an errant lock around his finger one last time before sitting back in his chair.
The rest of their afternoon tea was unmemorable and rather bland. Narcissa was thankful for this to the edge of her sanity. Cassiopeia was a trying woman. She'd nearly been a deal breaker when Narcissa and Lucius had been engaged.
A deep rumbling vibrated through Lucius's chest as he slid his hands around her waist gripping her gown and pulling it up and exposing her pale, shapely legs. "Enough of this," he growled lowly, tugging her firmly against him and taking her full, flushed lips in a hard, heated kiss.
Their lips moved against each other and their tongues stroked and petted for a long while until they were rather unceremoniously interrupted.
Draco watched his messy headed companion for a moment then smiled sadly and nodded. Reaching over he rubbed a comforting hand over Harry's shoulder. "I get it."
"They don't seem too upset," Harry observed as the boys all began making exaggerated icky faces and pretending to gag good naturedly while Lily smacked them for being "unromantic".
Looking closer at the aisles of cases down the center of the shop, Harry had to admit his daughter was right. They were filled with beautiful, unique pieces of jewelry. Bracelets, rings, necklaces, earrings; enchanted, jeweled charms to wear for protection, prosperity, or luck, not to mention
"Why is it a nightmare?" she asked unable to hide her happy smile. "They sound wonderful. Draco sounds wonderful. Granted," she tilted her head in concession, "there is no love lost between us and the Malfoys, but the Wizarding World has changed so much since the end of the war. I don't see a reason why the Malfoys should be denied the chance to make amends and change themselves the way everyone else has."
"Of course, Harry. If you need anything don't hesitate to floo," Arthur told him with an understanding smile on his tired face.
"You're bloody right it was stupid," Draco snapped, not really feeling all that charitable at the moment. "What are you playing at, Potter?" he demanded harshly, slipping too easily back into the sneering boy of his youth.
"This, Potter, appears to be the research journal of the legendary Potions Mistress, Esther Luise Potter. She was a genius at potions in her time. A true Potioneer," Lucius told him as he continued to turn the pages gently, skimming them as he went. "Fascinating," he muttered to himself completely engrossed.
A small silver bell shaped like a dragon's head over the door chimed brightly as it closed behind them.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Not just any exotic bird. An exotic bird that will deliver mail like an owl." He grinned again at Draco's stunned face.
They sat in silence for a time before Draco set his tea down and turned to him with a serious look on his face. "Potter, I know it's not any of my business, but I like Albus, he's a good kid."
They read dry passage after dry passage, monotonous entry after monotonous entry and still learned nothing they didn't already know or that didn't have anything to do with what they were looking for.
Harry sighed and turned to the address the kids. Hugo and Rose were watching the goings on in utter fascination while Teddy, James, and Albus glared at Lily. She blushed and put a hand to her mouth, eyes wide and innocently apologetic.
They marched up to the counter to pay for their snakes and their supplies. A tank large enough for Lily to lie down in was floating next to the register, a container with enough dead rats preserved with a stasis spell to feed the snakes for a half a year, a book on constrictor care, and a tin of Artemis's favorite owl treats were all rung up by a suddenly starry eyed attendant.
"Vault two hundred and twelve, the Black Heirloom vault," the goblin announced boredly. "I will await you both here. I have another bag should you require it."
They stood there for a moment, their knees shaking and their lungs sucking in painful gulps of air. "What in the bloody hell was that?" Harry gasped, sweat dripping into his eyes.
A strong hand grabbed his wrist stilling his hand's progress before his fingers could curl around a glittering jewel. Harry blinked dazedly and shook his head to clear it. "What?"
They stood silently staring, studying each other until Draco remember the mixing bowl, flour, eggs, and sugar splashed across the kitchen floor.
Hermione didn't return from where she'd hid herself in her study, though. That troubled Harry to no end.
"Hm? Oh, it's called Raspberry Zinger. Harry buys it at the muggle grocers a few blocks from Grimmauld. I had the elves pick some up for me. I've been practically addicted to the stuff lately." He took a large sip from his cup with obvious relish.
The little boy glanced from his dad to Albus's dad and Lily. "I'm Scorpius," he said still looking up at Harry with awe as he gave Lily a smile and a wave.
Draco sighed and laid his arms around Harry's shoulders comfortingly. "I know, Harry, and I'm sure she knows that too. Being disowned and estranged from your family instills a certain lingering hurt and distrust that is hard to look past. I'm not surprised Andromeda's assuming the worst of us considering. Give her some time, okay?"
He wasn't oblivious to the fact that there seemed to be some sort of history between his grandma and Mrs. Malfoy, but that didn't keep her or Draco from being really nice to him. And he hadn't seen Harry look as happy as when he was with Draco. Before, when he was married to Aunt Ginny, truly happy smiles and laughter were rare. His smiles almost never reached his eyes. Harry hadn't been happy for a long time.
"How in God's name did you get the money to finance something like Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes?" Draco demanded seriously. It seemed Harry's nonchalant revelation had stripped Draco of his buzz.
Down the hall the five Potter and Malfoy children were peeking out of Scoprius’s bedroom watching eagerly as Stella hissed information to them from under Draco's bedroom door.
. Or at least that's what it looked like he was doing. He didn't exactly want anyone to know that he was reading the
in between giggles," he informed them rather smugly and matter-of-factly. "He was stuck doing the quickstep until Lockhart called a halt and Snape came around and set us all to rights."
"Yes," Draco answered seriously. "He knows everything. That Father was once the Dark Lord's right hand man, that I was given the task to kill Dumbledore, that we were imprisoned in our own home and I was forced to torture and kill people." His breath hitched then and he paused.
"Hush," he admonished softly, kissing her forehead and stroking a hand over her hair soothingly. "We'll figure something out. If worse comes to worse we can take Draco and Scorpius and move to our chateau in France. The Ministry doesn't have any extradition treaties on the continent."
"Thank you, Draco." Albus blushed then impulsively rushed forward and wrapped Draco's waist up in a quick hug before he darted away again, head ducked and face flaming red. Scorpius couldn't have looked more pleased.
Harry looked out of the Burrow’s kitchen window with a heavy heart. He watched his children sit morosely at the picnic table in the backyard while their cousins played and chased each other through the grass. The cup of tea in his hands had long since gone cold, but he couldn't bring himself to set it down.
“Well good for her then. She bloody deserves it doesn't she.” Fred tells them in the empty common room later that same night. Harry just hums back to him, unwilling to move himself from his position curled around his brother. Axel just lets his brother snuggle up to him, knowing that he needs the comfort and is a very touch based person.
They were in the library when they heard Hermione huff loudly, “I don’t understand this part, what did you get Harry?”
In Tom’s defence if he had known it was a ploy and he never would have gone. If only he had known that Dumbledore was waiting for that perfect time where he was so overwhelmed by the loss of his two children that he wasn't thinking clearly, for Dumbledore to make his move. If only had known that only a week after he lost his children that his mind would be so weak that Dumbledore could slip right in. If he had known, he would never have let Dumbledore so easily take control of his mind. But sadly he didn't know. And the Potters had paid the price, the Potters and their baby son, who happened to be the same age as one of his own.
“I don't have time for your shit today, Potter” Draco's harsh voice snapped at him. Harry smirked and was about to reply when Pansy stopped him, “Don’t even Potter, can't you just be the bigger person for once? We need to talk to Weaslette.”
Wrenley lets something slip, Cassius is adorable, Axel is a damn good brother, and everything in their lives seems to be slowly falling apart.
“You sure?” Ginny asked, “Positive, but you have to go like,” Harry paused to hear the steps, “right now”
“Ren? What's the matter?” Wrenley looked over to see Harry standing there, glasses perched precariously on his nose. “They saw,” she replied. All she got in response was a confused look, “Oh I swear to Merlin Cass, they didn't see Ginny they saw Wrenley.” Ginny swore.
“That doesn’t make us feel more assured, Ren” Narciss told her softly, “Good thing it wasn't supposed to” Wrenley told them.
When Harry came to next he was in the dorm, with his necklace taken off. “Shit, I disassociated.” Harry swore, he didn't disassociate often but he always hated when it did. It felt like he wasn't in his own body, like he was detached. “Hey, Cass. You okay, you look kind of pale.” Harry turned to look at Neville who had clearly been tasked with taking care of Harry while the others kept up appearances in the common room. “I - what’s the date?” Harry hated to ask, but sometimes the dissociation lasted longer than others.
“Just after the welcoming feast, you need me to tell you what happened?” Neville didn't wait for Harry to answer him, and jumped into what happened. After Neville got through who got sorted into which house, he asked, “Who is teaching Defense?” Keagen chuckled and said, “This god awful pink toad from the ministry.” Harry raised an eyebrow at him, “I’m not even joking” Neville told him.
"Hush, your unconscious" Ron told him, petting his hair lightly. Harry giggled, slapping his hand over Ron's mouth playfully. After Ron's noise of displeasure, "Tired." Harry told him, as if it explained everything.
Ron believed him eventually but not at first, and Harry certainly didn't blame him, because Harry himself hadn't wanted to believe it for a long time. Ron finally believed it when his own test came back sporting the name, ‘Axel Riddle Black’. Finding out that they were twins was definitely not something they had expected. Ron and Harry had always been close, Ron was the only one that Harry would talk to about the Dursleys. And, no matter what happened with Harry Ron always seemed to know exactly what Harry needed for comfort. It goes the other way around as well, Ron was never a touchy person but Harry was the only person that he ever allowed to prolonged constant because with Harry Ron knew that Harry was a touchy person because he had ever gotten that type of affection before and for some reason if it was Harry Ron had never seemed to mind.
Ron sighed, and rubbed his thumb across the bruises that were spread across Harry's face. The last things Harry remembered from the summer was his uncle's red sweaty face, the rough belt pounding his skin, the fists landing heavy on his face, the tough tip of his uncle's dress shoes against his ribs as he was kicked. It was bad.
"Why" Harry totally didn't whine, and they knew he was that tired when he didn't even complain about being called Shortstack, a nickname he had been given in third year that stuck around like a bad cold.
"Harry?" Fred asked, he knew it was Fred because it was deeper. "Harry can't come to the phone right now. Please leave a message."
"What happened during the summer?" George asked. Harry waited a while before answering, "you know what happened, my uncle happened"
I was pretty proud of the ending on this chapter. Like every other chapter this is not edited and I would love feedback on not only my characters but the story itself please let me know! I love reading everybody's comments about the chapters it makes my heart sing with joy!
“How did we not notice?” Aurora Zabini whispered, “It makes so much sense. Ginerva is the same age as Wrenley. Why didn’t we suspect the Weasley’s in the first place.”
Wrenley didn’t know what to say to that. So she did not respond, she just stared at the necklace in Pansy’s hand refusing to look at any of them, especially Draco. She could feel his eyes staring at the top of her head, but she didn't look up.
“You will call me, Sir or Professor, Potter. Show some respect. Now come along there are many who would like to speak with you two” Snape’s temper got the better of him, and Snape internally winced, oh his friends were going to kill him. The kids followed hesitantly no matter how much they hated Snape he was a professor.
When they all came into creature inheritances over the summer they were all shocked, after lots of research they all found out why this had happened. Another trip to gringotts and they all found out what creatures they were. Hermione was a submissive siren, she had inherited it from her mother. When she found this out she freaked. Eventually she found that unlike what Greek mythology says they don't lure people to their deaths. They are close relatives with the veela because they both have lures and they both control their lures. Ron had dominant werewolf genes in him, he didn't transform during full moons, but he was always super sore during that time. He was possessive and protective like a werewolf, he also had enhanced senses, although that was mostly close to full moon also.
Dumbledore had always told Harry that no matter how bad their treatment may seem, that they were his only living family, and that he needed to go back because of the bloodwards. So when it came out that not only were they not related at all, but also Dumbledore was paying them with Hogwarts funds to mistreat him so he would be easy to manipulate and shape to Dumbledore’s liking.
Soon everyone else came up the steps and settled into the dorm room, Harry, Neville, and Ron without their necklaces on, Dean and Seamus talking to them about their summer. Eventually their talk turned into senseless babbling, so Ron said, “Alright, I think we’ve lost the plot for today” Harry snorted, “Hey, has anybody found a missing plot?” Harry shouted into the bathroom where Neville was shaving and Dean was showering. He heard a couple of chuckles but no other responses. Harry sighed and settled into his bed, he was not looking forward to tomorrow.

Nott didn’t care, just took the necklace out and tried to yank it off. “Hey, what are you doing to my necklace” Harry pretended to be confused, and quickly grabbed it out of Theo’s grasp. “What is this really?” Nott asked, Harry understood the real meaning behind the question, of course he did, but he decided not to answer it. “It’s a necklace, dumbass” Harry wiggled out of Notts grasp.
“It’s true, uncle Luc” Theo told him, “Yeah we saw her” Blaise agreed. Lucius frowned at the common nickname but let it slide. During the summer they all went through their inheritances. Something that all pureblooded wizards do. Pureblood wizarding families all have some type of creature blood in them, everybody knows that. They also have destined mates, you are born either a submissive, a dominant, or a beta. Theo is the only sub out of all of them, so he usually gets away with more things like calling Lucius by Luc.
Draco raised an eyebrow and flicked a questioning look at Harry who nodded his head with a grin. "She did. She also wonders how you keep your hair so shiny."
"And probably worked to the bone in punishment," came a bitter mumble that -thankfully- only Draco heard.
The bright flashed of warding magic in the garden continued into the afternoon as they went over the plans for Teddy's birthday party in far more detail than Draco thought was strictly necessary. As long as Harry and Teddy's family and friends were there, he highly doubted the boy gave a rat's ass whether the napkins had a paisley pattern or a flourish on them.
Turning back to Harry, Draco chuckled and moved up to stroke a hand through Lily's wind blown, tangled hair and smile down at the slouching boys next to them . "They’re all exhausted," he said showing his obvious familiarity with tired children. "But that just means they had fun."
Teddy made a distressed noise and looked up at Harry frantically. "I can't bring Nova, Stella, or Ruby with me?" he asked sounding completely horrified.
It seemed somewhat incongruous since Grimmauld was the Black ancestral house, but the effect of being inhabited by Potters was undeniable. The place that had once reeked of Dark magic, had felt sickly and twisted just to stand in the foyer. Now it smelled like sugar cookies, and finger paints, and little girl play perfume, and little boy sweat. Now it felt warm and happy and inviting.
"That's- very nice," Lucius hedged awkwardly as he shook her hand, leaning away from her as she continued to lean forward. "It was good of you to meet with us, Miss Lovegood."
Lucius held her eyes in the mirror as he turned toward her and let his trousers and underwear fall to pool at his feet. His interest and amusement were very clear in all aspects of his body. "Potter defended us to your sister? That's not exactly expected."
Snorting in mock indignation, Harry reached over and playfully pushed at Draco's shoulder. "Shut up, you know you like me. You're glad we stayed."
"Draco, dear, is there something the matter?" Narcissa asked, sticking her head into the room when she didn’t hear the telltale sound of floo travel.
Smiling lightly, Narcissa stroked her hands up his chest and curled them around his neck burying her fingers in his long hair. "It's not all that unexpected," she almost whispered as she leaned closer to him feeling his arousal press into her through her silk nightgown. "He is in love with our son after all."
Of course, St. Thomas would have been obvious if Harry had spent more than five days straight at home in the last six months.
Draco smiled at the little girl and bent down to her level. "Hello. It's very nice to meet you, Chrissy. That's a pretty name," he told the shyly blushing little girl. She was about Lily's age, but obviously much less outgoing. "Is it short for something?"
Harry just shrugged, smiling back. "I think I’m alright with that. Slytherins have their good points, too."
Draco chuckled and bent down to lift her into his arms. "I know, Lily-flower, but it's past your bedtime."
Albus and Teddy grinned at each other and faded quietly back into the greenery like Harry and Ron had taught them.
The next morning breakfast was a rather odd affair. There were four more guests sitting at the Malfoy table than normal. Not that Narcissa minded much, seeing as there were two more children to fawn and fuss over.
"Fuck. Thank you," Potter gasped painfully sincere. He let his hands fall away so he could look Draco in the eyes. "I'm sorry. I should have said that before. Thank you, for bringing him back. How did you find him?"
"Seriously?" Harry asked, shocked. Then he took a step back and squinted at the platinum threads. "Hey! There we are." And he was right. He and his children were there along with the rest of the Weasleys spanning out from Septimus Weasley and Cedrella Black. Then there was Molly's family, the Prewetts, coming from Lucretia Black and Ignatius Prewett.
A sudden weighty feeling hit him in the chest and he blew out a long breath. He'd been thinking about Draco Malfoy a lot lately. Ever since their breakfast visit had subsequently evolved into an all day affair.
"Chrysanthemum!" Draco gasped in surprised delight. "That's a wonderful name! My mother was named after a flower as well. You will have to meet her."
Of course Harry didn't need any words to understand perfectly. Draco may have been frightened by how fast they were moving as well, but he hadn't wanted to stop seeing each other all together. That was Harry's cowardice; a failure for which he was now going to have to suffer Draco's aloofness.
The next morning, breakfast is all fun and games until the nightmare of Lucius’s youth comes back to haunt them.
A quick search later found the towels in all different colors and textures. He shook his head in amusement and selected a fluffy blue one before turning toward the single sink and using the spare toothbrush that Harry had left out for him.
“After the war you just kept on going, you didn’t have to stop to rest. Auror training, marriage, kids; it’s a lot to deal with after a war without a pause to breathe. Then James was born barely out of Hogwarts and your life hasn’t really slowed down since. Obviously it eventually overwhelmed her."
"France was boring me." She flicked a hand at him dismissively, her eyes still studying the tableau at the table. "Besides, why should I owl my own son and ask permission to visit my old home?"
There was a thundering of little feet and Albus and Scorpius stampeded down the stairs nearly tumbling over each other.
He nodded. "Yeah, ’course." He didn't tell her that Sirius spent the last two years of his life on the lam or locked inside his house. She would just start crying again.
Draco stared at his mother after her rather impassioned speech and mulled that over in his head. "You know, Mother, I'm sure that if you asked Harry would help you get in contact with her again."
Draco extinguished the remaining light in the room and Harry smiled in the dark. He was sure he hadn’t felt this warm and relaxed in years if ever. He was asleep in the blink of an eye.
“This isn’t funny, Draco” Lucius swore at his son. “I’m not joking.” Draco replied back. “It’s impossible Dragon, no matter what we might want to believe. Your sister is gone.”  Draco could see his mother, his aunt Bellatrix, his uncle Tom, and basically everyone else in the background. After what happened, they had all moved into Malfoy manor.
Wrenley can’t help it, she laughs. They all look at her like she lost her mind but she couldn't bring herself to care. Eventually she sighs to herself as she calms herself down, “I know” she tells them, ignoring all the shocked and almost angry looks.
They remember the day clearly, the day that Dumbledore gathered his most trusted and instead of fighting against their parents they targeted the place that Dumbeldore knew would hurt the most. He went for the kids. Their parents were overwhelmed with grief not only with the loss of their children but also the loss of their good friend Tom Riddle.
“What's this?” Theo Nott tried to grab his necklace from the inside of his shirt were it laid hidden. “Woah now Nott, let's not get ahead of ourselves. I don’t like you like that,” Harry teased while faking sympathy.
Everything was silent. If Potter had a necklace it means he is family. Potter, Dumbledore’s personal do-gooder, the golden boy. The boy that Tom went after. On that thought, Lucius turned to his good friend Tom. Who was as pale as a sick ghoul.
I was really proud if this chapter, no so much the end but I think it turned out good. Let me know what you think in the comments, feel free to leave constructive criticism or leave your feedback. I'm going to upload chapters as soon as they are finished and hopefully I will have a knew one done every week.
Seeing the looks on their faces Ginny knew that they didn’t believe her, and well she didn’t blame them because just by looking at her you could tell that she was not Ginny Weasley. So in a moment of panic, she snatched the necklace out of Pansy’s hand and ran. Putting the necklace on again was like a breath of fresh air, of course she didn’t like having to hide who she was but at that moment she was happy.
And all of a sudden it went quiet, Harry turned to see Snape behind him. It was obvious Snape had been informed of what happened yesterday and Cassius wanted to bang his head on the table. Axel next to him let out a small growl obviously trying to reign it in but his instincts got the better of him. Luckily, Snape didn't hear it.
Draco was about to respond when his father placed a firm hand on his shoulder. They needed this to go well, Potter may be family, and he doesn't know if this could be going any worse. Soon Cassius and Wrenley were being forced into a room.
“When was the last time you got tested at Gringotts?” They turned to the source of the words to find Mrs.Zabini.
I have uploaded these chapters in the beginning very quickly, I am hoping to continue at the same speed but if I don't continue at the same speed I hope to have a new chapter every week. Please leave Kudos, and Comments to let me know what you think. Let me know what you think of the characters, I would love your feedback on them!
“Am I a bitch, or do I just refuse to kiss your ass like everybody else, Parkinson?” Harry was stalling. He hoped that by drawing Malfoy and his friends into a fight they would forget about Ginny’s mishap earlier.
“Oh yeah, here” Harry handed her his paper absentmindedly to busy writing a letter to Sirius to pay full attention. And, yeah Sirius knew who they really were. He didn't find out until Harry did but it turned out he had compulsion charms on him since he was young.
He was about to continue yelling at the man in front of him when he heard an impatient cough. He turned to see the Malfoys, the Parkinsons, the Notts, the Zabinis, and even the Riddles. He didn't catch Snapes look of guilt when he saw just how angry his chosen family was with him at the moment. They wanted Potter to like them, after all, they might be family.
For twins Axel and Cassius really didn't look the part, especially not like Damarion and Zaydon. Axel had pale skin much like his fathers while Cassius had his grandmother black’s dark tan skin color. Axel’s eyes were the color of quicksilver much like his mother, while Cassius eyes were mossy green once again much like his grandmother on the Black side of the family. Axel has his fathers straight hair in his mothers chestnut brown color. While Cassius soft hair fell in loose waves in his fathers raven black color. Axel had his fathers sharp jawline and pointy nose. While Cassius had the signature black high cheekbones and big round doe eyes that were framed by long thick eyelashes. Cassius had mostly androgynous features but it suited him and even if it took him a little while to get used to his naturally given looks he rather liked the way it looked now.
“And, I’m not deserving of your respect you stuck up, spoiled famous arrogant little prince.” Snape sneered at the boy in front of him, refusing to believe that this foolish boy was a part of his family. If only he knew that he was talking to Tom Riddle’s heir and submissive son.
Keagen, Damarion, and Zayden eventually gave up and started to heal him completely after they tried, and failed to remove him from Axel’s shoulder. Cassius soon fell asleep and the rest of them just stared into the slowly dying fire in silence, they hoped that everything would be alright.
It’s...odd Wrenley will admit that. Over the years she learned to accept that the Malfoys are her family. Yet sitting in the large ass dining room all eyes on her being coddled by her parents, her argumentative and stubborn nature couldn’t just sit around and be gawked at.
Harry was not having a good day. First the asshole that he sometimes calls his brother woke him up at, fuck-only-knows oclock, and then Wrenley is freaking out, and now Malfoy has his head stuck up his arse running towards him like a chicken with his head cut off.
Wrenley just sighs at what Tom had told her, because she knew. Merlin did she know, and she knows how much they wish to be a family but know they can't. The house elves put the food on the table for them and announce that dinner is served, and Wrenley vows to herself that she will enjoy this, she has her family back and the rest can wait for now she supposes.
“Maybe we should explain,” Draco sighs, “Your name isn't Ginerva Weasley. It's Wrenley, Wrenley Malfoy.” Narcissa buts in. And then they all sit in silence, as if gauging her reaction and waiting for a meltdown.
When Harry had told his family about his feelings about the cupboard it took both Neville and Fred to keep a growly Ron from killing them, especially when they found out that being trapped for too long can cause the veela serious trauma, and Harry supposes that's why he had nightmares about the cupboard.
“Ginny Weasley” Draco told him, his voice uncharacteristically small. “She had a necklace that was ripped off, and when it came off she was a different person. She looked just like us, Father, it had to be her.”
He knew that deflecting like he was doing is a clear sign of somebody lying, and he knew that now the Slytherins in front of him have realized that the necklaces are a bigger deal then anybody lets on. But it was either deflect or tell the truth.
“That necklace you described sounds like a traditional goblin made necklace.Cursebreakers usually use them because they are very good at holding various charms. For example, a glamour charm.” Lucius answers him, not waiting for his fathers reply.
“Mission failed successfully” Harry replied as his eyes drooped, Axel snorted and moved Harry’s head so it rested on his shoulder. “How the fuck is that even possible?” Ron asked. Harry gestured to his own necklace in a way of showing them that he meant they had seen his necklace also. He knew that all understood when nobody questioned what he meant. Harry would have responded verbally but sometimes talking just felt like it was too much, and now was one of those times, they would deal with everything later.
Draco and Scorpius flooed from Grimmauld Place after Teddy, James, and Albus. Both of the youngest Malfoys had nervous pangs in their stomachs, neither of them were feeling all that confident at their anticipated reception.
Then again, maybe he was thinking about kids now because he suddenly found himself surrounded by ones he wanted to keep forever. He contemplated that as the boys' laughter continued to ring out from the garden.
She had a hand pressed to her heart and had to almost visibly shake herself from her thoughts before she was able to nod "Yes, dear. I'm sorry, it's just the last time I heard that was when
Harry shook his head slowly. “No. I don’t think he would like a horse, and I don’t really know what other gifts would be appropriate for a special birthday.”
Smiling back, Draco nodded. "I do. You'll have to come into the shop sometime and check out what I've got.”
Draco sighed, teasingly annoyed. "We missed you all, too. Quite a lot, actually,” he admitted, “It seems Potters start to grow on you after a while. Almost like a fungus."
She tisked dismissively then stepped to the table and took Lucius’s seat. Where she proceeded to ignore everyone around her as she snapped for a clean plate and silverware and a fresh napkin.
"So, you did." The older man smirked and leaned back in his deep brown leather chair, his fingers pressed together in front of him. "Then may I inquire as to the purpose of this meeting? I do not believe you are an Auror any longer and I have nothing to hide in any case."
He smiled at the memory and carded a hand through his hair. "Felt a bit like being hit with a really pushy freight train, actually."
There was a slightly choked sound from across the table, but by now they were both used to ignoring any disturbance from that seat.
Draco was seated on the stone laid patio with the kids sprawled around him. Narcissa was sitting primly at the table next to them sipping her tea and chuckling along to the story. Whatever it was it must be very funny.
"Oh." Harry had to work to keep his lips from twitching. "Would you like to see him, James?" he asked the unusually shy boy staring up at Mr. Malfoy warily.
A shocked protesting look crossed Harry’s handsome young face. "But Margaret you're not old at all. You don't look a day over thirty." He smirked and winked at her flirtatiously.
With several puzzled goodbyes and hurried steps, the children escaped the study and raced back to Scorpius's room. Lucius was left sitting at his desk very thoroughly diverted.
Shifting his attention on the oldest Potter child he looked down at him appraisingly as the boy did the same to him. "You, young man, must be the wizened big brother."
"Alright," Albus declared as he slammed a stack of books onto the heavy wooden library table. "These need looking at."
will do this," and he did a practiced swish and flick, clearly saying the magic words. The rickety lawn chair sitting off to the side sprang into the air a good four feet up.
They were all quiet for a time, then Albus murmured, "I wonder if they still have their Dark Marks."
Stunned silence stretched through the kitchen until a particularly shrill and happy shriek from outside snapped them out of their shock and they reeled back further away from each other.
They traded a quick kiss before they went off on their separate ways. Harry to round up the kids and Draco to finish the last bit of preparations and make sure their parents didn't get in too much trouble.
Cassiopeia sniffed distastefully. "How very plebeian of him." She turned her eyes back on Harry. "You defeated this Dark Lord, did you?"
Harry turned an aghast look on him causing Lucius to just lean away from the staff and roll his eyes. "Really. It should be just like testing wands. Nothing catastrophic is going to happen."
"Potter!" Lucius choked from next to him, the magic in the air thick and nearly suffocating. "Drop it, Potter, before you kill us both!"
"I imagine that little girl of his would be, yes," Cassiopeia added flippantly. "Girls are always the sweetest. It's such a pity I wasn't gifted with any daughters or granddaughters of my own." She gave an affected sigh.
"Oh, I imagine he already knows and is turning a blind eye." Draco grinned. "Besides, Harry said that his cousin wants to expose his family to the Wizarding World a bit before they go to Hogwarts. It should help with the transition."
It had taken a lot for Grimmauld to feel healthy again. Harry had to exorcise the house’s Darkness like a doctor would cut away cancerous tumors. A troll leg here, a shrieking painting there, a house-elf head here until the infection was gone and the healing could begin.
Hurriedly, he bent to pick up the bowl, not broken thankfully, and straightened, his eyes never leaving Andromeda.
"Sweet?" He sneered in disgust. "It's sweet that our grandson is trying to make his father fall in love with Potter? Yes, how very sweet."
Dudley muttered something rather rude about Harry’s amusement before answering. "About four months. We're hoping for another girl."
His heart gave a squeeze in his chest and Draco leaned forward pulling his son into his arms. "They will love you. And so will Albus's aunts and uncles and grandparents."
Draco laughed and leaned forward in interest. The two of them soon began an involved conversation about dragons, in myth, legend, and flesh. He was having a wonderful time and by the time Molly and the other men brought out desert and tea, Draco couldn't tear himself away from the knowledge and stories that Charlie had to share.
“I was surprised as well. I had never dreamed that she would want to have anything to do with me,” she said, eyes raptly watching as his back muscles moved and rippled fluidly under his pale skin.
Soon the elf reappeared with a rather bemused expression on its pointy gray face. "Master, there is a girl, a Missy Lovegood, at the door."
Molly and Arthur had sat him down in the kitchen shoved a plate of leftovers at him and forced him to drink half a pot of tea before they looked at him with somber, tired faces and began to explain.
"It's alright, Lily," Teddy soothed, wrapping his arms around her and squeezing comfortingly. "We'll think of something. It'll be alright."
The little girl nodded and she stepped forward shyly. Harry crouched down to her eye level and gave her a reassuring smile. "Okay, Chrissy. Would you like to try for red sparks or green sparks?"
Harry fingered the correct key out of his pocket and slid it into the lock, turning it as easily as any lock he'd ever opened. There was a near deafening series of knocks, bangs, and clicks before the door grinded open to reveal a pitch black vault.
"What happened a month ago?" Molly ignored the implications of the timing and urged him to continue the story.
"He knows that Mother saved your life," Draco continued quietly. "That you saved mine. He knows all of that. Even that the only reason we aren't in Azkaban is because you testified on our behalf.”
She sniffed and unclasped her cloak letting it fall to the floor expecting that a house-elf would be there to catch it. One was, of course, and the cloak was quickly whisked away by the frightened shivering creature. They all knew Mistress Cassiopeia de Vil Malfoy. They all knew better than to displease her, as well.
” one small snake hissed as he slithered his way up Teddy's arm, into his shirtsleeve, out his collar, and into his neon blue hair.
"What do you mean?" Teddy asked with a frown. "How is Draco being ordered to kill Dumbledore and let Death Eaters into Hogwarts ironic?"
Molly held him against her chest and blinked back the tears that had prickled at her eyes. "Anytime, dear. You can talk to me about anything."
"Well, hello ducklings!" He laughed and hugged Lily as she slammed into his legs. "Are you all ready for a birthday party?"
The kids blinked up in confusion then looked around to see curious and frightened stares directed at them. Lily inched toward her father one hand pressed over her snake. The boys quieted down and kept in a close group behind Harry the rest of the way through the Alley.
"I realize that you were not raised in our world," he began, voice level. "I realize that you do not understand that in the Wizarding World there is more to family heirlooms than just furniture and 'quirky old magical artifacts'. Inside these vaults will be much more than that, I promise you," he said.
"And I won’t let you keep accusing the Malfoys of wrongdoings toward my family. Draco is my friend, Narcissa has welcomed Teddy, welcomed all of us into her home with open arms, and Lucius has been kind and considerate to
Harry could have kissed her. There was no recrimination, no outrage, no protestations, just a simple, albeit slightly wary, question.
Scorpius gave a long suffering sigh and Albus couldn't help but giggle a little even though he was still upset and nervous. "Albus, Dad!" the boy responded as if it should have been obvious.
"Shut up, you stupid-heads! I think it's sweet!" Lily scolded them, her pretty little face pinched in annoyance at the boys for being so very immature.
"Yes." She nodded flicking a nervous glance across the table at Hermione. "Meaning homes where witches, sometimes wizards, have married into a muggle family and their spouses do not take to their magic well. Often times, as well, homes where a pure-blood has married a muggle-born or half-blood. Political differences are one of the leading conflicts that we encounter in abusive relationships."
Teddy studied her keenly for a moment before answering. "She's great. She let me stay with Harry and my cousins for a while. I haven't gotten to see them in a long time," he told her happily, but Draco could tell he was thinking, trying to figure out why exactly Narcissa asking.
"Yes, well, I suppose there is that," the older man conceded with a wry smirk. "All three of them do have rather striking resemblances to the Potter line."
Lily lifted her head from Harry's shoulder and gave him a small teary smile. "Hi," she said quietly still sniffling.
Harry tore his eyes away from the still baffling scene and gave Malfoy a nod. "Good morning, Malfoy. I'm sorry for the short notice."
"I have no idea, but it's delicious," Draco mumbled around his food causing Scorpius to mock scold him for talking with his mouthful. He shot his son an exaggerated glare and made a show of chewing with his mouth open just to spite.
An idea floated through Harry's head. Perhaps Chrissy wasn't the only one prone to accidental magic.
"No," Ron breathed numbly. "I had no idea. I-... She didn't tell me. I should have... I should have known," he stumbled through, voice breaking.
"From what I understand, she's a muggle as well and has no family history of a wizard on either side," Draco said munching on an orange flavored cookie. "It must come from the cousin's side. Harry's aunt was Lily Potter's sister after all. Perhaps magic is a recessive gene in the family."
"Because he told everybody Miss Cissy saved his life and that Mr. Malfoy and Draco didn't want to be Death Eaters anymore," Lily answered promptly, with absolute certainty.
"It's alright, Dud.” Harry waved him off. “We’ve mostly gotten past it, me and the kids. I'm still pissed that she abandoned the kids though. But I think we're better off now than we were for a long time."
Teddy shrugged and gave him a shortened version of the fight. "So, that’s why she was so mean," he finished, sadly.
Lucius stared at him in contemplation. He hadn't ever thought that Potter would wish to seek out his company apart from their financial meetings and the times that Draco and Narcissa forced them together. Potter asking for his assistance in exploring his own heirloom vaults was... surprising.
The results of the children’s machinations are a double-edged sword. And the wisdom of parents transcends socio-economic divides.
Dudley flinched when Harry put his fingers in his mouth and let loose a shrill whistle. Scowling, he rubbed at his smarting ears and watched the owl warily as it swooped through the open kitchen door, took the letter and a treat, and swooped back out again.
"But why!" he burst out. "It's not like we can't talk to them and tell them not to eat us if they get hungry."
Harry snorted. "You don't really need to apologize to him. Just send his papers back to him and say the Ministry is under a major internal investigation to make sure this never happens again."
Andromeda opened her mouth to protest, but the words choked off and she simply stared at him in shock.
Harry smiled brightly at him and kissed his sugary flavored lips. "I know," he said before he set his cake down and made his way toward Mowgli.
Narcissa made a disapproving sound in the back of her throat, shaking her head. "I can't imagine that Minister Shacklebolt will be too happy if he finds that out."
It was almost painfully apparent that Scorpius wasn't a really social child. Draco had told Harry that the little boy had problems relating to many children his age. That even sometimes the parents of the other kids in his primary classes would tell their children to avoid him because he was a Malfoy and Draco's son. It made anger burn in Harry's gut, but he tamped it down because there was nothing he could do except indulge Scorpius in as much time with his children as he wanted and make him feel welcomed and wanted.
Dudley scooted up close to her protectively and eyed the little creature warily. "That's one of those house-elves, right?"
Now that she was gone, Harry was paying more attention to him and his cousins. He’d played with them in the yard at Grimmauld, helped them charm their drawings to move, and had even let them make a mess when they’d tried to bake cookies.
Harry cleared his throat. "Teddy's my godson. Professor Lupin, you remember him, was his father. His grandmother is letting me keep him for a bit to give her a rest." He smiled sheepishly. "I should have told you he was coming, I'm sorry."
She wasn’t all that hard to find once Harry had narrowed down the islands. There were only so many Caribbean islands he could comb through before finally stumbling upon his wife.
He was almost projecting his younger self and his father. It made Ron distinctly uncomfortable on top of embarrassed by his wife’s rudeness.
"Oh yes. He never looks at anyone else, but me like that. It would appear our James Sirius has found himself a friend." Draco grinned at him and strode forward to lavish his own attention on the horse.
"Malfoy’s got a point, Harry," George chimed in with a shit eating grin on his face as he nibbled on a delicate looking cookie. "Your kids are as stubborn as you are. They won't stop ’til you've gone crazy or bought them their snake."
"No." Harry shifted uncomfortably. "I gave Fred and George my Triwizard winnings so that they could start their joke shop. They made me part owner. George owns two thirds now. I'm the junior partner," he explained.
Lucius frowned and nodded slowly. "Mostly, yes. Different types of investments." His voice was cool once more, but with a hint of wariness.
Oh, yes. It was right after the war and Lucius had wanted it to appear that his family was trying to be on the up and up. Marrying a respected decidedly neutral pure-blood family seemed like the perfect way to do that. Fat lot of good it did.
Dudley's jaw dropped then he broke into a relieved smile. His kids weren't just weird, they were actually wizards. "That's good. Thanks."
Harry chuckled mirthlessly and covered his face with his hands not bothering to remove his elbows from the table. "God. What the fuck are you doing here, Malfoy?"
Lily huffed in agitation and pushed at his leg in irritation. "I know that stupid, but Belle said that he was a -um- egg layer." She blushed, suddenly realizing that it didn't really translate from Parseltongue to English. People didn’t lay eggs after all.
A lump formed in Harry’s throat and he leaned over to lay his head on her strong soft shoulder for a moment before straightening up again. "Thanks Molly. Even though I know it, sometimes I just need to be reminded."
"I suspect it had something to do with an owl my son received in the small hours of the morning the night before," Draco drawled. "That and the fact that your daughter's snake just happened to be able to navigate through the packed Alley all the way to my shop with unerring directions."
Draco was reeling and he didn't really know what to do. He felt the urge to chase after his son and the small measure of protection Scorpius offered as he followed Mrs. Weasley outside. The other Weasleys wouldn't be unkind to him if Scorpius was standing with him, but the rise of his panicked thought abruptly left him when he felt a warm hand press to his lower back.
He had failed Ginny and he had failed their kids, but he had long since learned not to repeat his mistakes. Harry wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice not this time.
Harry shrugged again, pinking in the cheeks a little. "The Hat said I would do well there," he explained, "said that 'Slytherin would help me on my way to greatness'."
Harry grinned at him, but there was a worried tint to his beautiful eyes when he caught sight of a frowing Hermione now standing off to one side by herself.
Harry had to smile at the boy for that. Scorpius was perhaps the only child he knew that could make being a Parselmouth sound like the neatest thing since sliced bread. It probably had something to do with generations of Malfoys being sorted into Slytherin.
"Good evening, Weasley." Draco inclined his head politely as he not so covertly smoothed down Scorpius's hair with his free hand.
"I’ve had enough of your attitude, James. If you think you are the only one effected by your mother leaving then you are sorely mistaken. I’m sorry I have not been here for you and your brother and sister,”
"They need to see each other again," Lily declared as she laid her head on Teddy's shoulder. "Then they'll like each other again and fall in love and Scorpius can be our brother and Draco and Dad can have more babies to be our siblings." Her voice grew progressively higher with desperation and exhaustion and her eyes began to tear.
“I know,” Harry sighed. “Still she needs to let things like this go, to move on, but even if she can’t, I don’t want her to be completely estranged from Teddy. I never wanted that.”
He set the bowl back on the counter and sniffed disdainfully. She didn't want to be polite, well fine. He didn’t have to be either.
Harry wouldn't fool himself into thinking it would be easy, overcoming their fears. They may believe that he loved them, that he wouldn't abandon them, but deep down the fear was still there. He saw it every time he popped through the floo to run as errand or asked them if they wanted to visit the Burrow.
"Huh," Lucius huffed thoughtfully. "Well, what are you waiting for? Go see who it is," he instructed dismissively.
By the time they separated for the need to breathe, Draco was mostly on top of Harry and neither of them minded one bit. Deciding he liked where he was just fine, Draco relaxed on top of him and pressed his face into Harry's neck.
Some of the kids were already knocked out around the patio on the silk embroidered cushions the house-elves set out for them, but a few were still chatting and playing more sedate games in small groups. Percy and Audrey had already gathered their girls and headed home along with Bill and Fleur and their three kids. George and Angelina were still going strong, though, their kids still hopped up on sugar.
Harry shook himself out his daze helped along by Lucius's sarcasm. He gathered up the presence of mind to glare at him. "Shut it, you. Let's keep looking, shall we?"
There was a heavy silence between them, made heavier by the Caribbean sun beating down on them.  Harry’s heart was squeezing painfully, his wife was dangerously depressed and a large part of him wanted badly to fix everything right then and bring his wife home, the mother of his children. He wanted to wave his wand and vanish all the burnt edges and dusty corners until everything was right again.
After that Draco couldn't remember much, but he knew that they'd laid the baby, his little sister, to rest in the family mausoleum at the very edge of their property. He knew that she'd gone unnamed as was Wizarding custom, but had been given a place of respect with the other Malfoys that had gone before her.
Lily nodded with a bright smile, then tilted her head toward the snake and hissed at it. It hissed back and she giggled. "Belle said she thinks you're very pretty too."
Narcissa reddened a bit then she scowled. "You hold your tongue, Theodore Remus Lupin. I'm not above bending you over my knee if you deserve it, young man."
Watching him amusedly, Lucius answered, "It's a chest, in this case a chest of drawers, that is cursed to capture beings that succumb to the temptations of greed and thievery. It will literally suck you into its depths turning you into a jewel to temp others."
He was right, Teddy realized. How would they go about researching the war without getting the adults involved? "I think we're going to need help," he said.
A quick glance at the clock confirmed that it was indeed the kids' bedtime. "Of course, Lily." He smiled at her and bent to lift her into his arms.
Punished for his behavior with a blow to his pride, James blushed, lowered his head and murmured, "Yes, sir." Taking his hand back he scooted closer to his father.
She huffed in frustration, but once she realized that the children weren't actually hurting themselves, she relented with a nod. "Fine, you're right, dear. I'm just a tad nervous." She composed herself and turned toward the Weasleys with a disarming smile on her elegant face.
Draco watched the whole display with increasing suspicion. He had a sixth sense for scheming and it was definitely tingling. Oh yeah, he was so going to have a word with Shotzy sometime soon.
"Harry!" The dark man looked up in surprise. "To what do I owe this visit?" he asked, eyes flitting to each child's morose face then back to their father's.
Lucius took in those too innocent smiles that had suddenly pasted themselves to all five of the little heathens' faces and just knew that he was in over his head.
Scorpius frowned in concentration. "SSSSSSSSSSShHass," he hissed at Tal then looked up at Albus hopefully.
Harry just laughed heartily and leaned against the wall where the phone was hung, his fingers twirling the long curled cord absently. "Sure I do, Dud. You only use the phone because you're bloody afraid of owls."
Grin widening, Draco took his proffered hand and shook it. "Draco Malfoy. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Lupin." He flicked his eyes toward Harry looking at him expectantly.
Harry smirked, so enjoying his cousins' amazement that he couldn't feel bad about not realizing what a shock this would be for them. "I didn't think about it. I'm sure Marianne and Chrissy would like to see it next time you all visit, though. You'll have to remind me."
It had been a while since he'd seen Harry looking so good. He wasn't back to normal, or completely healed, but he looked like he was heading that way. The gauntness that had seemed permanently etched into his face since Ginny abandoned them was fading and those deep exhausted bruises under his eyes were lessening by the day. Of course the kids, fast healers that they were, seemed nearly back to normal. Their mother's absence hadn’t been that hard to recover from given that she’d been off for months before she left.
Truthfully, he’d known the moment he’d spotted her on the beach. Standing up he brushed sand off his butt, and looked down at her. She hadn’t moved an inch since he’d sat down. She didn’t move now, either.
It'd been a long day and by the time he stepped through the floo at the Burrow to pick up James, Albus, and Lily they were nearly in tears. They wouldn't let him out of their sight until the three of them had fallen asleep in the living room watching Harry review his financial papers.
The only thing worth noting in the Malfoy family history was that Lucius Malfoy had been, at one point, one of Voldemort's most trusted Death Eaters. After Voldemort disappeared the first time, Lucius had escaped prosecution by claiming to have been serving him under Imperious.
Draco's heart broke a little at the sight of Albus’s distress and he crouched on the ground pulling both Scorpius and Albus into his arms. "It's alright, Albus. I'm not mad. Don't ever think I'd be mad." He ran a comforting hand up and down the little boy’s back as he sniffled and buried his head in Draco's neck.
"That would be a goblin made sword," Lucius murmured quietly in his ear so that the goblin waiting for them at the cart wouldn't overhear. "The inscription, if I'm not mistaken -my Gobbledegook is a tad rusty mind- translates to 'take me up'," he lifted the sword from the table by the hilt and flipped it over to read the other sideof the blade, "and 'caste me away'
Harry watched in awe. How had Malfoy won over his children so damned quickly? He had to be some kind of snarky, posh Mary Poppins.
"She says she can't understand what they're saying, but the air tastes of..." Albus frowned trying to think of how to translate so that Teddy and Scorpius would understand. "Of contentment and happiness? Yeah, that's it."
Shaking his head, Draco leaned back a bit, loving the warmth of Harry's touch. "Just had a little chat with Granger. She took exception to the alcohol available for our adult guests."
Draco and Harry relaxed as the kids played. They talked about everything and nothing, just enjoying the cool evening air and their children's laughter. It felt comfortable and right. Both men were loath to think about when Draco had to floo with Scorpius back to the Manor at the end of their visit.
Draco frowned, but tried to remember. "Nymph-something or other. I really don't know. She left Hogwarts before my first year. I understand there was quite a difference in age between her and Lupin. Why?"
Sending a grateful look at Ron, Harry relaxed a fraction and took a sip of his drink. He shouldn't have been surprised that Ron was being so good about this. He'd matured a lot over the years.
"Astoria, my ex-wife," Draco began after a moment, "didn't exactly abandon Scorpius. She just refused to have anything to do with him."
Pausing when their lips were so close Draco could feel their heat, Harry whispered, "I missed you, Draco," then brought their mouths together firmly.
They made it to the bed eventually and curled up together mostly sated and mostly naked. They weren't quite ready to take that last full step in their intimacy, but they didn’t hesitate to enjoy one another in other ways.
"Teddy!" Albus moaned completely embarrassed while Draco burst out laughing, a pleasant rolling sound that filled Harry with warmth.
Thinking of Scorpius and the four Potter kids reminded him that he'd always wanted more children. He could admit that part of the reason was that he knew just how lonely it had been growing up in the Manor with just his parents and the house-elves for company. He’d longed for siblings to play with.
"Oh, yes!" She stepped forward and stuck her hand out to be shaken. "I remember you, quite well," Luna commented in all seriousness. "You had more Wrackspurts than even Harry, but they seem to have all gone away now." She smiled leaning forward to peer closely at him.
Teddy nodded, certain. Scorpius was a master schemer and he was a bit of a bookworm like Albus. He'd know what to look for and how to get it without the adults getting suspicious.
"Call me, George." George grinned then winked at him. "If you call all of us Weasley, we'll never figure out who you're talking to."
"For some reason I'm not really surprised," Ron drawled a slight smirk on his lips. "I've kinda guessed that you're already seeing someone, but I wouldn't have guessed it'd be Malfoy."
Draco laughed. "I'm sure the martis and other men of the community will forgive you this once for the oversight."
His dad hugged them too, and made pancakes for breakfast. James blushed a little remembering when his dad had held him as he cried just after his mum had left.
On the garden porch, Draco jumped to his feet and raced toward exotic section of the gardens, He'd heard the sound of his son’s scream and his heart was nearly pounding out of his throat. His son was in trouble.
Draco pulled away from placing a kiss on his sleeping son's forehead and running a gentle hand over Albus's hair who was curled up next to him. It had been a good night. A hundred times better than he would have expected it to be.
“Well?” Draco said, his voice was low and dangerous, “Who are you?” Ginny took a minute to respond before she forced a sneer onto her face, “What do you mean who am I? I’m Ginny Weasley, and give me back my necklace.”
Harry ignored the man in favor of his son, “Yeah, for your manners. They have got to be around her somewhere, can't you see that we were having a conversation. Didn’t Daddy teach you that it's not polite to interrupt when the adults were speaking”
So the Malfoys, The Parkinsons, The Notts, Tom and Bellatrix Riddle, and Aurora Zabini sat at the table in silence as they mourned the loss of their children that were stolen 14 years ago. Damarion Eric Parkinson and Zayden Tiberius Parkinson were twin boys who would be 17 and in their 7th year of Hogwarts. Keagen Dewan Nott is the youngest son of the Nott family who would be 15 years old, he was adopted after his birth family had tragically died due to a house fire. Amara Daniella Zabini was born almost exactly 9 months after older brother and would be 15 years old this year. Wrenley Malfoy, the youngest and only daughter to the Malfoy family would be 14 years old this year. And Cassius Ruben Riddle Black and Axel Riddle Black are the twin sons of Bellaxtrix Black and Tom Riddle who would be 15 years old this year as well.
“Oh shit” Harry mumbled, she was about to snap at him again when they heard footsteps fastly approaching, “Go back to the compartment Ren, I’ll take care of them.”
“Just tell us where she is, you four eyed cretin,” Malfoy yelled, pointing his wand at Cassius’s forehead. Harry didn't have it in him to be upset that he was being yelled at. One part of Cassius actually felt bad for Malfoy right now, but he couldn't let him see Wrenley; they had appearances they needed to keep up, they couldn't be a family right now. The other part of Cassius smirked when Malfoy pronounced cretin wrong, “First of all its Cretin,” Harry carefully sounded out the word cretin in the proper way, just to piss Malfoy off before continuing, “If your going to threaten me, at least do it properly, Malfoy”
Harry grinned, it's not like he lied, the Dursleys always told him that he wasted to much money and wouldn't feed him for days on end, or wouldn't feed him as a punishment, so as a result Harry can never eat to much in one sitting and  is very short for his age, and according to Pomphrey he isn't going to get much taller. “You're such a spoiled bitch, Potter. We don't have time for this, let us talk to Ginevra.” Pansy got into his face and yelled.
Harry could not control his fiery temper, “No. You have bloody not received my respect. You are an overgrown spineless coward who can’t let go of the past. A worthless piece of scum who saw it fit to bully children, and for what reason? Because you didn’t like his father? There is no chance that I will ever have any respect for the likes of you”
“Isn’t the eldest Weasel a curse breaker? What's his name? William isnt it? They all call him Bill” Pansy asked, Draco nodded his head as an answer and seemed to be lost in thought.
“Harry this is a drawing of an owl on your homework sheet,” Hermione got his attention, “Did you get a different sheet?”
