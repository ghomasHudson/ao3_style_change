Draco rolled his eyes again before he ran his hand through his hair and began to pace slightly hysterically. "What has become of my life? Rescuing and giving pep talks to Harry Fucking Potter! I will surely be killed for this! I've probably just got my whole family murdered," he muttered.
It used to be that you could avoid all the fanfare and simply shoot out a quick owl to the Department of Magical Transportation and get authorization for a portkey to the destination of your choosing. The problem was that there was nothing preventing a whole flock of people sharing a portkey when only one had registered for the thing. It wasn't much of an issue for a family going from Wales to Scotland but, after 911, most governing wizarding bodies started to enforce stricter measures around international travel. The Ministry of Magic created a customs department out of Heathrow specifically for witches and wizards traveling outside of the UK. It operated similarly to Platform 9¾, the arrivals and departure terminal out of sight from muggles, of course, but it wasn't uncommon for the muggles in Terminal 5 to wonder at the eccentrically dressed men and women who sometimes traveled with strange pets.
"Interhouse unity my arse--" Ron dodged a blow from Hermione before sitting across from them. "He's still a Malfoy."
Harry grabbed his jar full of porcupine quills and shook it side to side. "No, no -- you have to do it harder than that. Try doing it up and down and faster like you're.... Nevermind." He stopped himself but smiled mischievously.
always welcome. If I invite Harry Potter into their home through the front door, not only would I likely be responsible for your death but I'd also never get invited back for the holidays! They
Harry couldn't resist. He leaned in and let their lips brush together tenderly, their noses rubbing gently. Draco's eyes closed and his breath hitched as Harry reached out to cradle his head in his hand and he angled his head to kiss him harder. Draco responded by wrapping an arm around his back and pulling him even closer as he licked at Harry's bottom lip. Harry parted his lips and allowed Draco's tongue entry. He explore his mouth, gently at first and then passionately, possessively. Harry could have sworn he felt magic course between them as he felt all of his senses heighten. Draco tasted of treacle tart and smelled of lemon shampoo and felt so soft to hold but... Harry angled his hips to get closer and gasped when he felt how hard he was through the thin pajama bottoms he still wore and waves of pleasure shot through him as his own hard cock rubbed against him. He wondered briefly if this had been what Ginny meant by
Draco leaned over and kissed him on his scar. No one had ever done that... Most people were apt to gawk at it but even those who had been close to him always seemed fearful of touching it. It felt sort of symbolic in that moment: Draco being the only one who wanted to touch the trauma, and doing it so gently.
"I'll floo the Aussie's and see if they can crosscheck with muggle records!" he said, scrambling to his feet and leaving Draco staring up at him in that endearing,
"What the fuck does it look like I'm doing, Potter? Saving your arse!" he said as he turned to walk briskly down the corridor.
Harry leaned back to casually sit on the head table (which secretly made him feel quite rebellious) and crossed his arms.
"Seriously?? How did I wind up on a movie set?! I must've been pissed last night!" He laughed. "You're right, I think it's time I gave up the sauce. -- What are they shooting anyways?"
Theo crossed his arms and stepped closer. "I don't know what you're playing at Draco but I need to know where you stand. You can't play both sides, you have to pick a side!"
The first sign was when he noticed that, at some point within the last three years, whenever he would visit the graves of Dumbledore or Remus and Tonks, he began to find beautifully crafted bouquets of exotic looking, colorful flowers on each headstone. Birds of Paradise and Calla Lilies, Neville had said when Harry brought him a still picture he'd taken on a muggle Polaroid. Apparently, the strange flowers need to be grown with great care and a fair bit of magic to survive in this region and Neville casually revealed that Narcissa Malfoy was the only one he'd known to have successfully grown them in her garden. At first, he was bemused. Maybe it was Narcissa -- Tonks was her niece, after all. But why Remus? Would such a devoutly prejudiced woman really have such sympathy for her estranged niece's werewolf husband that he wasn't even sure she personally knew? And then, why Dumbledore? And the gravesites were so very far apart... Why would she possible care so much as to make regular visits to both? But it finally clicked one day when he was visiting Mad-Eye's grave at a completely different cemetery and he noticed the colorful bouquet on a distant headstone. When he went up to the grave and realized that it belonged to Vincent Crabbe, it all suddenly made sense.
Finally, he rolled his eyes. "Hermione, I've dated Ginny! I had a crush on Cho! Remember?!" he said indignantly, trying and failing to keep his voice even.
"That's exactly what she said you'd probably say." He leaned in and kissed Harry chastely. "She's a very sage woman, you know."
"Oh!" The girl's brown eyes went wide and she put on a performatively sweet voice. "What will it be for you today,
"Sorry, old friend, I'm actually here on business," he said, peering around the bar at the plethora of disreputable looking patrons until his eyes finally landed on the shadiest of the bunch: a man in a corner both whose face was wrapped in bandages like a mummy (or a Stepford wife after a go at plastic surgery).
Where's your head today? And --" he paused as an annoyed looking Alexandra knocked on the door, another owled message in hand. "
Harry smiled, brightly, filled to the brink with pure love as he took off the headphones and turned to face Draco.
Harry froze, aghast. "You think Krafft Sr. realized that his own son was a budding psychopath? Thought that pretending that they weren't wizards might keep him harmless?"
"Nah, mate. I'm pretty sure my conscious would be light as a feather right now. Probably lighter than it currently is, even..." He watched a spider crawl up the stone wall next to him and Harry was surprised when he didn't even flinch as it neared him. For the first time, Harry started to wonder if Ron might feel numb, too. "It's hard to feel like you've done enough when you do all this fighting the good fight and shite like that still happens to your best mate, the woman you love still gets tortured, and Fred still dies in the end." A tear rolled down his face and he didn't try to stop it. "At least maybe if I'd have killed them, I'd feel like I'd got
"Playing the nice guy! Like you're any different than Robards!" she huffed. "You bureaucratic arseholes are all the same! Yea, sure you're nice now but give it time!"
"You misunderstand. I don't give two fucks about who's a muggle or that blood purity crap you poms in the UK made up as an issue. Muggles are weak and harmless and not worth the hate and a wizard's a wizard. It's you lot would rather sit in your little circle, inbreeding, instead of figuring out how to truly elevate. So simple-minded. So limited. No, this... This is all about power, mate."
Draco felt his his chest constrict and then so did everything else as they disapparated on the spot.
actually changed his hair into the short, mousy brown mop of curls that it was supposed to because, really, it was a bit of a die roll. Draco hadn't thought much of it when he flummoxed his wedding vows by sneakily reciting the line
"What? Too bitter a pill to swallow?" he cooed, mockingly, his head cocked to one side. Harry hadn't seen this level of coldness in Draco since his misguided Hogwarts years and he was suddenly very appreciative that the cruel boy he'd known had grown up to find himself on the good side of things because, with the added effect of his magic positively buzzing off the walls, it was both awe inducing and terrifying. "Oh, do you want to be
"No, Draco!" he managed to get out between laughs. "They either adopt or get surrogates-- a woman who agrees to carry the child for them," he clarified when Draco looked even more bemused.
Ron laughed. "I figured you must be bisexual." He shrugged. "And you've never actually said anything so I thought maybe I was wrong."
Harry wanted to just tell the prat to stop acting so weird before the TSA agents flagged him as suspicious or something but he knew Draco well enough to know that it would likely only have the
Yes. Now that's another thing I never would have expected. We were proud arch enemies for many years.
Draco didn't remember walking to him. Maybe the wand caused him to float. All Draco remembered was standing over the man who had caused Harry so much pain, long before he'd killed him. The man who'd loomed as an ominous presence in the background of every happy moment he and Harry had even shared in these past six months. The man who had just taken away every happy moment they'd had yet to have... The man who had just doomed Draco to experience the worst pain imaginable for the rest of his miserable existence. Everything in Draco wanted to unleash the vast power bestowed upon him to destroy this man and he felt that power mixed with hatred roar in his ears, whirl in his chest as he lifted his wand, glare fixed on Sebastian Krafft.
"Neville!" Lee exclaimed as Neville and Hannah finally joined them. "How long did it take for Ron's weird love voodoo to work on you two?"
"Oh, hello! What a cute family!" He turned to see Isabela's mother, Margherita, a muggle woman whose half-blood husband was killed in the war, getting out of her car. "Harry is this your better half?"
He rolled his eyes. "-- which means that you'll catch on to things quicker than I and we can finish faster."
It was in that moment, when he realized that Ron was foregoing curry, that it occurred to him that maybe this was a bigger deal than he thought.
"Yea, yea -- I know -- the last time I used this was, admittedly, not my finest hour -- But, really, why mess with what works? Grab on," he said, extending his Hand of Glory.
"--and then the Little Witch That Could lived happily ever after," he concluded to a chorus of joyous cheers and applause.
Stevens shook her head again, "Well, I for one, am not comfortable serving up our leader on a silver platter without any proof!"
Harry shook his head slowly as if coming out of a spell and Draco started and turned away. They turned towards the crowd of friends staring at them and then each stomped off to sit on opposite ends of the couch.
He had fancied boys, in a way, before but that was normal, wasn't it? Oliver Wood, Cedrick Diggory, Viktor Krum, Draco Malfoy... Didn't most wizards admire good, fit Quidditch players? It was like, with muggle sports, who didn't think David Beckham was the hottest thing under the sun? Was that... not normal? He blushed.
Draco waited until Harry was right at the edge and then abruptly removed his mouth, leaving Harry whimpering and hips bucking upward, desperately hoping to rediscover refuge in the back of Draco's throat.
Harry laughed, morosely. "I thought I was worried that things were going to go badly tonight but I think I was secretly hoping that they
His heart stopped and he felt a cold sweat as panic crept into his core. He couldn't move and that familiar numbness was starting to ebb away at the edges of his mind. Was there a Dementor around? He didn't hear the screaming that he usually did and why was no one else reacting? He pried his eyes away from the stiff and bloodied bodies of his friends and saw nothing but the smiling faces of students all around him. His ears began to ring and it only magnified the too loud echoes of joyous laughs throughout the hall. He felt like he was spinning until, finally, his eyes landed on searching steel gray eyes. Draco Malfoy was staring at him with one eyebrow raised in concern. Just like that, the sounds in the room returned to normal and his heart resumed beating, only now at top speed. He risked a glance back over to the head table and saw nothing there besides the teachers having breakfast.
Draco had briefly noticed his aunt being there, she looked so much like Bellatrix he had known straight away. But she was a stranger, and that wasn’t the place. Maybe one day.
The man, thought, mistook his words and prodded “Longbottom’s friends were responsible for his death, after all, so this is the perfect occasion for payback, in Stephen’s memory”.
“He was beautiful, you know.” His mother had once told him in a detached voice, none of the affection that he could hear in Lupin’s present in her words. “Aunt Walbuga had always been severe looking, harsh jaw and small eyes, but her eldest was all pure blood symmetry and charm. You have his eyes, Draco.” She had said, as if talking about the weather. “He could have gone far.”
“Sorry. They are mostly disney. I- uhm - didn’t have a. . . conventional childhood”. He sighed, running a hand through his hair. The bird nest, Draco noted with a strange relief, was mostly unchanged from the familiar mess he was used to. Potter had let the front grow slightly longer, and the curls fell over his eyebrows, hiding his famous scar completely. “My friends declared I had a lot to catch up on, and I guess nine months do make for quite the collection.”
Draco was speechless, wondering what pushed Potter to tell him, of all people, something like that. He always mocked the other boy for his fears, knowing deep inside it was to cover the evidence of his bravery, and surely Potter would know he would use such a confession to ridicule him. Except this time you won’t, his mind supplied, and he nodded numbly.
He wanted to beg to call Granger, that he didn’t want any job or any burden or any Potter in his life. Wanted to ask who the fuck was Remus, and please what and why.
Dumbledore’s reaction caught him by surprise. The older wizard stood straighter, shaking his head. “What have you done. . . Oh, what have you done. I should have known, after Sirius. James and Lily. I should have seen it in your heart, one can only take as much. . . Please forgive the blindness of an old man”. He pleaded, louder, to the air.
“I know. That’s why I forgive all the shit you pull. And just so you know, when I was really angry I used to imagine you were Kirley Duke”.
It must have been strange for Potter to have grown without someone that believed in him, without a mother. These Muggles of his sounded awful, even without Lupin’s warnings. It had been a shock for Draco to hear Potter talking about his childhood, the loneliness lingering to each and every word even as he shrugged it off like it hadn’t mattered. His father had many expectations and little pride to show, but Draco could always count on his mother’s love, on her reassurance that he was enough.
A couple of hours later Draco was slouched on the sofa, Ron happily sleeping on his stomach. Potter had taken seat on the floor, his back propped against the coffee table for support, bare toes plucking mindlessly at the plush carpet.
Lupin sighed, resigned “Look, you were exhausted. I didn’t do much other than aiding your sleep, but it looked like you needed it, and I had things to take care of after. . . After” His voice drifted but Draco didn’t need any help to fill the blanks.
The other wizard glanced at the empty frames “Maybe, but aren’t all the reasons we act for personal?”
As a little boy, his mother used to tell him that life was like a waterfall trying to fit inside a glass. At some point, the overflow was inevitable.
On the positive side at home he was pampered and served in a way that was impossible in the castle, and he was allowed to see his friends often enough for boredom and loneliness not to become a daily occurrence .
He checked his options and, feeling out of depth, he decided to approach the closest establishment advertising food. He fumbled awkwardly with the Muggle currency that Lupin had exchanged for him. He had decided that the imminent bus ride, combined with three flights, was enough of daily first experiences for him to dare trying the plastic card his Professor said was somehow connected to his bank.
Draco stormed after him but Blaise grabbed his arm and stopped him just outside the classroom. "What was
Harry kissed him sweetly and then nodded. He had made his choice and, for once in his life, he didn't feel bulldozed. He knew he could make sacrifices, it just felt better when he got to decide to make them.
!" Draco sputtered, horrified and glued to the spot as Potter just marched straight up to the front door of the nearest home without a plan in sight. He jumped when the door wandlessly blew off its hinges as Harry approached and barged on in.
"But Draco! There's no way we're both going to be able to catch a portkey when it's only registered for me! Don't you think I should have Alex try to update it for both of us?"
It didn't take long to get through customs but, by the time he'd navigated the muggle crowds standing around those big metal turning things where rolling luggage appeared and then braved the never-ending queues for the rows of floo connected fireplaces and the designated apparition points, he only had a handful of hours left before his meeting was slated with Minister Oblansk and he was dying to get off of his feet and drown in a warm cup of tea. So when it was finally his turn and he stepped onto the apparition point, he thought about the place where the warmest welcome awaited him as he spun on the spot.
The fire roared green and they all greeted Bill and Fleur as they stepped out of the fireplace bearing a bottle of wine and an array of Fleur's homemade sweets.
?" Draco asked, trying to make sense of that information. "I know he grew up on a sheep station but that's all the way in Australia..."
Long seconds passed before the next strike of lighting flashed to illuminate an enraged Sebastian brandishing the Elder Wand and advancing quickly!
Madam Pomfrey had worked her magic and he was feeling fine now but, of course, she was insisting that he stay until she was sure the concussion had been fully healed.
Draco's heart warmed as he thought back to the initial pep talk that started everything. Harry was the only one who believed in him then and Draco had been so confused yet so touched! So much so that he had made the completely insane decision to follow Harry Sodding Potter out into the field with a broken wand hand and nothing but Harry's faith to rely on. Draco shook his head and laughed, incredulously, because dammit if history didn't repeat itself. He felt slightly hysterical to even be considering it!
Harry, you've no idea--" Draco stroked his cock slowly, mouth dry and pupils blown to shite as he took in the sight before him
! But then you started defending him and whatever the hell that was yesterday in potions," he glanced at him suspiciously. "...it was obvious that something had shifted. It wasn't until this morning that things started clicking into place and Hermione's hints started making sense." He chortled. "Yesterday she pointed out that she didn't think
Ron shrugged. "Harry, you've been gay for Malfoy for the past 7 years." Harry raised both eyebrows in surprise. "I just never expected you to act on it because he was...
"Oh, great. Another power hungry ego-maniac taking an interest in my life." Harry rolled his eyes and then reached out to pull Draco up onto his feet and into his arms.
"Are you saying that you want to skip the fancy smanchy place that's going to cost me an arm and a leg? To get cheesy chicken nachos, instead? Because I'm alright with that."
to make it absolutely clear which house you're from?" he asked as he made his way over to the mantelpiece where an array of framed moving pictures and portraits caught his eye.
Harry moaned, his half-hard cock twitching at the words and deciding for him that he was having none of that. He reached for the spoon and placed it back in the pot before finally leaning in to lick along the curve of Draco's neck, stopping to nibble at his earlobe and smirking at the sounds it drew from Draco's mouth.
Just last night they were allied around the fact that they were both glad to not have all the pomp and circumstance of their first weddings...
The first man pulled out a tiny box from his trouser pocket and pointed his wand so that it unshrunk to reveal an evidence box. He removed the lid to display a strange collection of books, files, and what appeared to be obscure potions ingredients -- some roots and twigs that he should probably send to Neville. Harry cocked his head as his eyes were drawn to a beat up old book that looked like it hadn't been touched in many years though its well worn spine suggested that it had once been a staple: "
Harry angled his hips again and relished the moan that escaped Draco's lips as he arched his head back. Ok, he must be doing something right, he thought. Draco reached down to guide his hips and encourage him to rock them and Harry bent down to lick at the span of his exposed neck, kissing and sucking a trail up to the soft spot beneath his ear. "Harry..." Draco whimpered and Harry couldn't resist anymore, he began to grind in earnest.
"Zabini, I have been set up. The acting Head Auror has been imperiused, the ministry has stopped searching for Ginny, and whoever
There was a time when he would have searched for a card, but he knew better now. He'd received anonymous flowers on 4 other occasions in as many years and they never came with a card.
It was only within the past year that they were able to focus on having an actual relationship that wasn't just her taking care of him. They didn't have that intense passion that you saw in muggle movies but they were doing ok for a good few months. That's why he was surprised that it was when things were finally going well that she had asked for the break. She framed it as being about what was best for him, as she always did, but he had a hunch that it might've really been because she'd wanted a break for a long, long time but was just too afraid to admit it and it wasn't until now that she thought that Harry might be well enough to handle it emotionally.
"You can't. But we need to find Ginny and I know that you want that as badly as I do. I can't make you believe me, but I would never hurt Ginny." He shook his head. "I can't hate that she loves you, or you her.
," but he highly doubted a gay tryst with Malfoy, the one bloke from school that she still despised more than anyone, was what she imagined.
Never one to disappoint, Harry stepped forward, letting go of Draco's hand to aim a quick series of red stunning spells into the void from where Sebastian's voice had come. Silence followed and Draco strained his ears for any sign of movement. Could it possibly be that easy?
"Draco... What if they don't make it? How am I supposed to live with myself? Knowing that while I should have been worried about her making it home, I was off having sex in an airport massage parlor?" He rolled his eyes.
"I love you, Harry. More than anything on this earth. And, Gods willing, I want to show you that every single day for the rest of my life. Harry James Potter, will you do me the immense honor of allowing me that chance? Will you be my husband?"
Harry looked at him and hesitated, clearly debating if he should say something or not. Finally, he sighed.
Thinking fast on his feet, Harry scurried down the front steps and broke out into an impromptu round of enthusiastic applause, feeling incredibly stupid as he drew the attention of the shocked girls and a befuddled Draco.
"Get a move on, mate!" Sebastian shouted, the tip of his wand pressing awkwardly into Draco's back. "And Malfoy, I swear if you try any funny business I'll kill you right here, right now!"
Harry and Draco both spun around to see Hermione, Ron, Blaise, and Ginny raise their glasses in agreement but were surprised to see that George, Angelina, and
"Tough nut, love," he chuckled. "You know, it's really nice to be able to do that. Kiss you. In public," he clarified in answer to Draco's raised brow as he bent to slip on his shoes.
Only Draco really knew how utterly at odds his calm demeanor was to the inner consternation presently reaching a fever pitch. He might have laughed at the ridiculousness of it all but he was pretty sure it would only come out as hysterics which, obviously, was bad for business.
"The courtrooms are there." Harry pointed to the open doors where the Dementors stood sentry. "I don't think there's a way around them... We're bound to be seen, if not by the wizengamot then definitely by the Dementors."
have together. You two have it all figured out so please tell me: What in the bloody hell am I supposed to do with that?"
"Oh," said the girl in the pink who now donned a troubled brow. "Well, when you put it like that..."
He stared at the brunette witch before him, completely baffled. This didn't make sense. He'd counted Astoria and her sister in his small circle of friends for years and he knew her to be smart and
say? Hermione, Gin you take Harry. Astoria and I have got Draco," Pansy directed as she took the white garment bag from Ginny before turning her gaze to Ron and Blaise. "You boys, greet our guests and direct them to their portkeys."
"I would love to get a demonstration from the war hero of your tried and true patronus charm! Can you show the class?"
When he finally made it to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement on level 2, the Aurors were already heading into a large meeting room. He slipped into the room without issue and, when he recognized Stevens, a witch from his training year, he took the seat behind her hoping to overhear anything that could give him a clue as to where Harry was being held.
That dream had felt too real, almost like the ones he'd had back when he was privy to glimpses of Voldemort's mind. Surely, that wouldn't make the slightest bit of sense in this context, but still...
Long, titillating minutes went by before Draco sped up and threw his head back as Harry gripped his thighs tighter to brace himself. At last, Draco stilled but his cock continued to pulse in spurts.
"Keep your head down. We just need to lay low until the disapparition jinx wears off and it shouldn't be much longer now. That way." He handed the shop keep some notes and nodded towards the only exit to the square that they hadn't seen an Auror stationed.
Harry felt his cock harden on cue but the middle of Heathrow was hardly the place and, of course... there were still other things to consider...
Draco carried on, seemingly unaware of what Harry was pretty sure to be a subtle act of wandless magic. Harry's mind drifted back to Ron's half-hearted joke from years ago when his own powers seemed to go into overdrive where Draco was concerned.
"Sorry, to disappoint. But I do prefer tea and Potter is very well hung." He shrugged against his bindings. "You know good dick can make a girl do crazy things."
Sebastian was right, he didn't much give a damn about girl Weasley though he didn't think Harry's strong, if somewhat moronic, Gryffindor morals would ever let him step out on his marriage. Draco would be lying if he said that he didn't think about portkeying directly to England when he'd found out that Harry was getting married. The fact that he didn't was all the evidence he needed that he was too far gone because the usually conniving, self-serving Slytherin hadn't been able to shake the thought that it just wouldn't be fair to show up and complicate Harry's life like that again.
all of them have been sudden. No preparation, no coming to terms with it, no goodbyes... No control."
Grey eyes were searching his with burning intensity. Draco licked his lips, made to speak but then bit his bottom lip, instead.
about being special. Nah, that silver spoon of yours never let you doubt it. No, you, mate, appreciate
Draco nodded. Potter directed him to sit on the nearest bench and then sat facing him. He cradled his hand gently with one of his own large, rough hands and Draco held his breath as he began to delicately pull out the shards of glass, one at a time.
He screwed up his face in confusion. He could tell she was trying to hint at something but it was making her look like she was having a fit. He raised a questioning brow and turned towards Ron.
Right on cue the gold gates began to seal the fireplaces, one at a time, starting at the furthest end of the room. The Aurors raised their wands at once and waved them in the same circular motion.
to find Ginny. If you haven't worked it out by now, Robards has been imperiused." Her eyes widened with comprehension. "You
He simply sighed, resigned. "If you're going to hex me then go ahead and get on with it, I really don't have all day," he said, crossing his arms impatiently.
Draco laughed. "No, he's an egotistical, opportunistic, manipulative dick, but that's most people I know." He shrugged and Harry screwed up his face, incredulously. "Anyways, I always interpreted his intrigue in my life and successes as more of a fascination with how I, as someone starting from somewhere way in the negatives in public opinion after the war, could actually garner so much favor and celebrity."
Harry dodged a curse from the man's wand and Draco flattened against the nearest wall as it ricocheted his way.
Draco, have you gone mad?!" she asked, nonplussed and completely losing all pretense of professionalism. "I'm not a miracle worker, you know?!"
He needed to get out of there, and soon! It was pointless to even think about wishes. The fact remained that Draco was still a coward who would do anything to uphold whatever face his parents needed him to wear, including marrying some crazy arse girl.
He watched as a familiar battle warred behind emerald green windows into a mind far too complicated by far too many experiences of love and loss. Draco sighed. It still amazed him that the man who he never saw bat an eye in the face of danger could look so scared and fragile when it came to matters of the heart.
"Yes, sir! Never misses a game! And Boply has helped host the game for six generations!" The little elf swelled with pride.
"You alright, mate?" asked Ron when he finally came down to the common room. Harry sat down heavily in the chair across from Ron and Hermione who were snuggled close on the couch near the fireplace. Ron handed him a plate of breakfast but Harry shook his head at it.
The third thing that really sealed the deal, and perhaps Harry's fate in going "goo-goo eyed" and caring way too much about the blonde git, was when Teddy started to gets posh gifts from 'Santa' every year that were far too extravagant for a toddler. Last year's box set of little practice snitches with the Black insignia on them were kind of a dead give away. Andromeda cursed whoever sent them every time Harry would release them in the house and pick Teddy up to zoom him around and try and catch one, but she didn't know who they'd come from. She entertained his theory that it might be from her estranged nephew, mostly for Harry's sake, but she remained skeptical because she insisted that Draco had never even met Teddy.
Harry bit his lip nervously. "Well... I don't think I could ever..." He paused. What if this was a deal breaker for Draco?
Harry was surprised when the typically shy kid stretched out his arms in a bid for Draco to hold him. Draco looked taken aback but he reached out to let the little boy clamber into his arms, all the same, softening as Teddy settled on his hip and pulled out his toy snitch from the pocket of his overalls to share with Draco.
Harry thought nothing of it as he unfolded the parchment and saw handwriting he'd never seen before -- that was hardly unusual. But as he read, his heart stopped:
"I appreciate the trust required to be willing to follow someone and I want to do everything in my power to make sure that I earn that trust and don't let you down once I've gained it. Now, enough of the sappy stuff!" He bit back his amusement and shook his head before going for it: "Let's kick butt and take names!"
"Well, of course not! I am doing no such thing..." He crossed his arms and huffed. "Harry's married and I am being respectful. That's all..."
He took a deep breath, realizing that they weren't used to seeing him like that and that two weeks in was not the time to lose it.
"Yes, I bet if I married Harry Potter then that would do loads more for my reputation! And we could even still have an heir! Did you know that muggle men use something called a surrogate to have babies? Pansy could be my surrogate and that would handle all of that!" he finished his slightly breathless ramblings, his heart threatening to beat out of his chest as he waited for their response.
"We were able to round up most of the students who cast at you. Most of them were Slytherin and a few of them were from other houses but just got caught up in group think. Theodore Nott did manage to slip away but since every other wand has been tested and accounted for, we're assuming that he was the one who cast the killing curse. The Aurors are on the case," he briefed him. Draco thought briefly that he really would make a good Auror if only he wanted to be one.
Harry clutched his heart and yelped, having nearly jumped clean out of his trainers! He spun around to find Draco frowning from the doorway, hair still in disarray and pale, bare legs on display in Harry's oversized Gryffindor hoodie (a gift from Hermione that the Slytherin swore he despised despite the fact that he wore it more than Harry).
"We have lots! Ginevra is alive and she's being held captive by Sebastian at his sheep station in Thundelarra!"
"Right... Thanks," he said, distracted as he came across transcriptions from the death eater post-war trials. What in Merlin's name had this guy been up to?
Draco was finding it very hard to pick his jaw up off the ground. Something was wrong. Something was very, very wrong. No wizard with even a hint of self-preservation would throw their wand in with the rubbish, not even as a joke! And especially not in these times -- no. This was just great. Harry Potter had literally just lost his fucking mind and Draco Malfoy was the only witness.
He'd made it all the way to Snape's old office in the dungeons before he realized that he had no plan. The door was locked. Sneaking in would probably startle Malfoy half to death and it would be just his luck if that resulted in another duel like the one in Moaning Mrytle's bathroom. He shivered at the thought. Bugger it. He was a Gryffindor, afterall, he thought as he brought his fist up and knocked hard on the wood door.
Lucius shot Harry one last look of contempt and then marched out, too -- his robes swirling in a flourish behind him.
because I couldn't eat for nearly three days because you, you stupid wanker, walked out, all upset, and called me
Harry bowed his head. "I don't know if someone that I love and care about is alive or not and yet another person that I trusted has betrayed me... Anavi, I
He shook away the lingering anger and smiled, genuinely, when he noticed that her stomach curved out just visibly now, even with her flowy robes.
! Erhm... Thanks, Anavi." He rubbed at the back of his neck sheepishly and she smiled as she exited and Hermione entered.
Draco held his breath as his own panic threatened to overcome him and he carefully resurrected his mask. It wasn't lost on him that right now, at that very moment, there was probably a castle full of people who thought that he had imperiused the Boy Who Lived or that there was a smaller portion who actually did believe that he genuinely wanted to help Harry but wanted him dead because of it. Either way, it meant that walking out of this room by Harry's side might be one of the biggest risks he took in his life. Was this how Harry had felt when he'd decided to stand by him during the trials?
Potter was backed up against the wall next to the grand staircase, his arms thrown in front of his face defensively as Granger tried to get a good look at him to cast another spell. Finnigan and Thomas tried to keep the crowd from getting too close while Weasley and Longbottom looked on worriedly. Luna Lovegood was dancing and waving her wand through the air, presumably trying to rid the air of Wrackspurts or the likes. Flitwick was giving orders for someone to get madam Pomfrey and Merrywhip just stood there helplessly. The scene was complete chaos!
He poked his head into the massage room where Harry sat, straddling the massage chair; he was face down in the little face hole and shirtless. With his hair pinned back up and out of the way, Draco swallowed at the sight of the rippling tendons in his back, far too tense for their own good but, Gods, were they sexy.
"What? Gay?" He scoffed. "They both are still under the impression that I am to marry a rich, pureblood girl." He rolled his eyes. "Like the Malfoy name isn't rubbish now. I suppose they are still holding out hope that they can find me a French bride or something like that."
It had always peeved him that Potter seemed incapable of minding his own business. The fact that he had somehow, inexplicably, become Potter's favorite subject for meddling was only the icing on that particular proverbial cake. When life made sense, it usually meant that Harry was hellbent on foiling Draco in some way. But now, in some bizarre twist of fate, most of Potter's meddling of late involved the green eyed boy either saving Draco's arse or defending it and it drove Draco crazy that he didn't know what to make of it.
They had made it about eight blocks away from the market when Draco slowed in front of a shop from which music was flowing.
Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Neville, Luna, Seamus, Dean, Parvati, Padma, Ernie and Hannah all raised their hands. There was a hush across room. "Ladies and gentlemen, Dumbledore's Army." There were more applause as his friends gave curt bows of their heads and Luna gave a pageant wave. He smiled at her before continuing.
Before she could go into full lecture mode, he slipped out of her grip to put both of his hands on her shoulders, pushing her up and facing her head on. "Hermione. I am not gay."
"We need to figure out what our next move is and I know a place that has the best fish and chips in all of London! Might as well eat," he shrugged.
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
Harry softened. "Not rose-coloured... Maybe I just cared a little more than most to try to see you clearly..." he said, reaching out to let the back of his fingers gently trace along the delicate curve of his cheek.
Draco and Harry exchanged glances and he watched as the rest of Draco's guard seemed to melt. To have these little ones genuinely care without it having to feel staged was clearly meaningful for him.
Harry took a deep breath and undressed. Draco was still floating and thankfully not watching him. He thought about leaving his pants on but reminded himself that he was a Gryffindor and this was Draco. He got closer to the water's edge before he quickly removed his pants and slid into the water so that his bottom half was no longer visible through the bubbles and he crouched down so only his head could be seen. He could feel the anxiety starting to bubble up.
"Nope! I'll take it!" He lit up, reaching out to take the note from her hand. Any other day he might've been more apt to follow protocol and assign someone else to follow-up, but he knew his CI was more likely to talk if he did it himself and they
They had a fun night, to say the least. The Golden Trio had a blast jumping around the stage singing
It was weird having this conversation with Malfoy. They were actually revealing vulnerable things about themselves.
"Well, I for one--" said Ron, stifling a yawn. "--say that the day I become friends with Malfoy is the day I put on one of Aunt Muriel's old biddy dresses and do the Waltz with Mcgonagall again." He cringed. "Not going to happen!"
"Rosie, don't you want to see your Uncle Harry become the youngest Head Auror ever inaugurated?" She cooed loudly making Harry smile and Hermione giggle. "See, that settles it then." Ron said smugly.
If you have your own thoughts of what pre-2001 pop songs Harry might've put on the mixtape I'd love to hear it! :-)
Harry woke up with a start, still on the couch and now drapped in a green blanket that smelled wonderfully like lemon shampoo. He breathed in the scent and felt himself melt into the cushions as he relaxed. He sleepily cast a tempus charm and nearly jumped off the couch when he realized he had only 20 minutes before double potions! He was already struggling in the class without the help of the Half Blood Prince and he couldn't afford to be late. There was no way he'd make it up to Gryffindor tower and back in time, though. He cringed at the idea of having to take the extra lessons Slughorn kept hinting at.
His fellow Slytherins were mostly split into 2 camps: the first being those whose families were tried and true death eaters who thought Draco a traitor; and the rest those who were neutral or team Order who now placed all blame for the hate the house was receiving onto him for being the one actual death eater. The Greengrasses weren't bad though. He had never been particularly close with either of them but, at some point, the younger one, Astoria, must've taken him for a sadcase and she and Daphne started forcing him to join them in the common room every now and then for a game of exploding snaps in their attempts to pull him out of hiding. "If you're going to hide in the shadows like a vampire then people are going to treat you like one!" Daphne kept insisting.
Draco shook his head. "No. By the time I moved to Australia... Harry, I was probably the most authentic version of myself I'd ever been: out, proud, and so much more invested in charity and helping out the little guy than I'd ever cared about keeping old pureblood families rich and in power. Yet, the man still followed me around like a dog with a bone looking to --" He broke off at the look on Harry's face and grinned before he leaned in to kiss away the puckered frown lines between his brows. "Well the details don't matter -- the point is, I don't think the whole act was completely fake. There was
Draco laughed and grabbed the nearest file. "I think that ship sailed long ago when the rotten git used me to get to you, dear. But, yes, tell me more about how giving a maniac the most powerful wand in the world sounds like a good idea." He rolled his eyes, sardonically.
"You know, I'm thiiiiis close to getting Ginny Weasley to go to Hogsmead with me," he said triumphantly, holding his thumb and index finger a millimetre apart. Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry really did scoff this time. Out of the corner of his eye he saw white blonde hair leaving the classroom and he hurried to gather his things. "I've got to go! Bye, professor!" he said, rushing out before Merrywhip could get out another word. The third floor corridor was crowded with students heading off to their next class but he could spot Malfoy and Zabini just ahead near the portrait of Merwyn the Malicious.
"And sometimes it's more straightforward. My godfather died in the war. He was a spy for the order and I'm so proud of all the things he did to protect me and others -- many of which will never be known to or acknowledged by most. But everyday I talk to his annoying arse portrait and whenever I'm home I pick his favorite flowers from my mother's garden for him. I take time to be grateful and proud of all the things he's contributed to my life or that I know because of him. It's all my way of reminding myself of his life and what he's done."
of you. I know this is a big change for us all but if there's ever a team of people I'd want to take this ride with then they're standing right here in this room."
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
"Why, hello there," he said, stroking its soft plumage with his knuckle. He carefully untied its note and it hooted happily as he tossed it an owl treat.
Blaise, who are these guys? Do they have a bone to pick with you? They knew where you lived, where to apparate..."
years, when I'd accepted my lot in life as a crack wizard and embraced my muggle side like my dear pops had always wanted," he said, conversationally as he carefully examined the bat. "It was all trickery on his part, of course; intent on dimming my light, you see. Even sent me off to Durmstrang with my grandfather's wand! An ash wand that had passed down through my father which he, in turn, bestowed upon me -- as if some grand honor, no less. Do you know what happens when you use a wand-- an
s to count. He started to head to his seat but the open bar in the back of the room was looking awfully inviting and he reasoned that there was no way he was going to make it through the night without a drink. A very
Harry nodded. "It's either gruesome ends for you or Teddy or just weird dreams with me at Hogwarts. Draco, they're too vivid. It was a similar thing back when I could see into Voldemort's mind as a teen!" Draco paled in the dim lighting. "It feels like a premonition. Like he's getting closer to the wand or like something bad is going to happen..."
"Eat, it's fine," he assured. "Mother just does that. She'll do or say something awful and then get scared that I'll leave her for good and then she'll do something nice and unexpectedly motherly like knit me something or make me my favorite meal. It's positively manipulative, of course, but, at least I get the good stuff," he said, doing a little happy dance as he savored his bite of pancakes.
Harry spent most of Sunday morning on the couch, wrapped up in a blanket and listlessly flipping through channels on the telly. His mind was numb and nothing seemed good enough to watch. The things he did get momentarily excited about were the things that reminded him of Draco. Ugh. Would he ever be able to watch MTV again?
Harry's grin grew and so did his cock. He wrapped his arms tighter around Draco's waist and rolled so that he was on his back with Draco lying on top of him.
"Almost exactly a month ago. She has stopped by once almost every month since January with a new item. She only missed March and has always come on a Wednesday --
Draco pushed off of the wall he'd been casually leaning against, hooded cloak pulled low over his face, and joined Pansy as she strode out of the café sipping a coffee.
Harry was silent for a few minutes as he looked off into the distance. Finally, his green eyes met Draco's and there was a calm there. "I think I finally can. Thank you, Draco."
Harry looked between his two friends in confusion when Ron dropped his fury to smile lovingly at his wife before taking her hand in his.
and I'll be damned if I lose you because you're being fucking careless!" He glared at him, furious but impassioned, his face only about an inch away from Draco's. The moment lingered. Draco's heart felt like it was about to beat out of his chest and his eyes slipped down to Potter's rose colored lips.
"Isabela Martinez, if you don't put that down right now! ¡Ay dios mio! Excuse me, Harry," she said as she hurried off to try to stop the girl from floating Genevieve's toy owl into a tree.
"Ok, where are we with the Warbeck case?" Harry asked, taking a sip of his coffee and thinking he could really use something stronger. He frowned at the thought and tried to focus.
Draco tilted his head this way and that, hoping that something on the thing would give him a clue as to what in Salazar's name it was supposed to be. He pressed one of the strange buttons that had the words "Play/Pause" printed in tiny print and was surprised when music started coming out of the the head contraption. He held it to his ear and smiled widely when he recognized "
"Oh my... Pink snapdragons, purple statice, and... birds of paradise? What a truly unique and lovely arrangement..." she said, slightly awed.
"Well, I think anyone who knows you knows that that's bollocks. You're one of the bravest men I know and that's partly because you're willing to love bravely. I trust you because, for someone who hasn't always been able to fight for himself, you're continuously willing to put
"Harry... something bad happened to you and I think you are dissociating." Harry screwed up his face at that but kept his eyes shut.
"It's my understanding that you all got a go at it in 5th year. As you might remember, it is a very complicated, advanced potion with many steps and dire consequences if brewed incorrectly. And it most certainly will make an appearance on your NEWT exams." Harry felt Hermione stiffen beside him. Slughorn clapped his hands together and bounced on the balls of his feet. "Ok, let's get to it! Oh -- but do be careful! I wouldn't want anyone falling into an irreversible sleep on my watch!"
He heard Hermione gasp and saw her raise a hand guiltily to cover her mouth. Flitwick looked affronted and Merrywhip blushed red in embarrassment.
"I did my research -- well, Hermione did, of course -- and it turns out that the Elder Wand is rumored to have a Thestral hair core and it's believed that only those who are capable of facing death can master it."
you think she might have been if not at home with you and not with the friend she said she would be with?"
"Draco, in my experience, people die and people leave you and those are pretty much the only guarantees in life." Draco felt a surge of guilt at that: he had left Harry, too. "What I wasn't prepared for is what happens when someone stays but they cheat. I just had no framework for it. All I knew was that I couldn't handle another loss so I was willing to go along with it -- to be blind."
They both glanced back at the table full of notorious Slytherins and former friends who all had their heads together.
He adjusted his position between her thighs so that he could insert two fingers. She clenched around him eagerly and, when he hooked his fingers and found the little bundle of nerves there, she cried out. He kissed and sucked on her budding clit and she gripped harder.
home is not a liability for Harry when we've already seen what they made of him meeting with his own damn confidential informant!"
Harry bit his lip and nodded fervently but didn't speak. Draco chuckled lightly when he realized it was because he was doing that thing where he forgot to breathe.
They rounded a corner where stairs led to a rail system and Weaselette's footprints made it about halfway up the stairs before the other two sets caught up to her and the trace disappeared.
It wasn't until later that night, when most of his friends had gone and his new wife was snoring softly by his side, that he was able to listen to the CD in its entirety. It was an emotional rollercoaster.
"Thank you for a lovely night, Sebastian. How about we connect in two weeks for our meeting with Benson? We've got mergers and acquisitions to discuss," he said, curtly.
Harry wiped the tears of laughter from his eyes. "It really is all about taking it one day at a time I guess. Some days it's really hard, and some days I realize that the people and things I value most in my life wouldn't have the same role in my life or bring me as much joy as they do if I hadn't experienced all the pain."
"Hey! You're that mean guy!" Some drunk girl in a neon pink catsuit blocked his path and pointed a finger at his chest. "Leave him alone!"
"My guess would be extreme over compensation," Draco mumbled, distractedly, eyes still concentrating hard on the wall. "Harry, did you check for muggle records? For that period there?" He pointed at the blank stretch of wall marked by a big, red question mark.
to look aghast in present company while Narcissa rubbed at his back and rolled her eyes. Andromeda giggled freely at her side and Harry could have sworn they shared a smirk.
. This right here--" He gestured between he and the former nemesis now curled up against his chest. "Is all the proof I need to know that you can't help who you love. What I did hate were the lies and the disrespect and the pretending... So tell me, Zabini, why would I choose to hurt her when she finally told me the truth?"
was what had caused him, Draco Sodding Malfoy, to ignore every Slytherin instinct for self preservation yelling at him to turn and fight and, instead, hastily discard his precious, trusted Hawthorn wand. He groaned as the facts settled: he was somewhere in the den of the enemy, utterly wandless, and Harry was probably...
"Merlin, that was a lot of cum!" He screwed up his face and stuck out his tongue when it finally went down.
"THIS WON'T BE MY LIFE!" he yelled, angrily, pushing himself up the wall and marching wobbly, yet determined, off to the hall where Walburga Black's portrait still hung.
"...Only it's come to my attention that Pansy and Hermione have arranged a bachelor party of sorts at some muggle bar. A few of our closest friends are expected to be in attendance..." he said with forced casualness as he pulled at Harry's t-shirt. Harry obligingly took it off even as his mouth twisted wryly.
Potter smirked and quirked up an eyebrow. "What happened to that new leaf, Malfoy?" Draco put down his book and scowled. "Ok, ok." He raised his hands in surrender. "I need to study for potions. Slughorn keeps suggesting that I take extra lessons," he said as he started to unpack his bag and pulled out a quill and his copy of
Why had he said that?? They hadn't discussed anything of the sort and he hadn't even seriously allowed himself to think about kids of his own since the miscarriage. Harry groaned inwardly, sure he had just managed to ruin everything, when soft lips found his.
made food the last thing on his mind. Draco had just informed him that Robards was imperiused and that Ginny's last known whereabouts were somewhere in Surrey.
"I'm afraid so, love. But the most ridiculous part is, this Sebastian bloke is doing all this and I've no idea if I'm even still the owner..." He frowned.
He heard keys jingling outside of the door to his flat but didn't bother to move. Only three people, besides Draco, knew he had this place and only one had a key.
"Anyways, there was only a 50/50 chance that it would make us any more attracted to each other but a 100% chance that it would make sure that we were stuck together for life. On the very likely chance that it didn't ignite this fabled passion everyone seems to be hoping for, then I thought she deserved a way out at some point," he defended. He crossed his arms and shrugged his shoulders, ruefully, his voice fading to a mere whisper. "And on the off chance that it did... I don't know, Pants. I just don't want to not be... well,
Ron and Hermione were great, of course, even if they didn't always get it. Ron always made sure that he ate, constantly bringing him food or having Mrs. Weasley send him something special. Harry wasn't sure if it was because he'd actually noticed that most days he simply didn't have an appetite and sometimes forwent eating or if it was simply because food was Ron's ultimate love language but, either way, he felt loved. Hermione would occasionally go into fits of worry but her solution to that was to keep busy. That's why each time she'd suggest more things for him to do, his love for her continued to outweigh his annoyance; she really thought she was helping. Overall, he just appreciated that they were the only 2 people in his life right now that ever asked him how he was doing, even if he did always respond with
The ginger shrugged “Your call, mate”, and that earned him a kick from the other Gryffindor. Harry was pushing him away with his foot “Don’t you have somewhere to be, maaate?”.
More than the faces of his friends, more than the real and good memories of Hogwarts, more than magic itself, it was stripping Harry of his own name, his identity, that had made his guts twist with guilt.
By the time he had made it to the Castle’s gates and Professor Slughorn had accompanied him to his new dormitory in the Slytherin Dungeon it was well past dinner time. Despite being tired, it had taken him a long time before falling into an agitated sleep.
“Wow, you really are a posh git!” Potter said with a demented smile. He was still holding onto his stomach, like the overdramatic wanker he was in both this and his previous identity.
They decided to surround the body of water with a ring of white pebbles, followed by a bigger ring, that was to be divided in four sections, leaving a cross of gravelled path to reach the pond. The outer parts of the sections would host a  circle of Red Daisy chrysanthemums.
“I haven’t got any options!” He said, and he was suddenly feeling faint. “I’ve got to do it! He’ll kill me! He’ll kill my whole family!”
“Well, it seems you weren’t the only one, since Potter has yet to make an appearance.” Theo sounded almost angry and the vindictive voice in Draco’s head wanted to retort that he was indeed having a secret affair with his sworn enemy.
Draco kneeled to look at the student instead. Because it was a student, laying face down on the cold ground, hit cowardly from behind. He was wearing dark robes on top of a burnt sienna jumper, his wand still held awkwardly in his right hand, partially hidden in the crook of his neck. He must have been running and had fallen down before even realising what was happening, his arm stretched in front of him to defend himself. But the danger had struck unexpectedly, dastardly avoiding direct confrontation with a child. Draco was disgusted.
Draco noticed just then the two abandoned brooms behind the Headmaster and the sudden feeling of alarm sent the clock in his mind ticking down faster.
They occasionally engaged in trivial conversation, thanks to which Draco discovered that the other boy worked as a trainee pastry chef at his uncle’s bakery and doubled as a delivery driver during the summer months, when their usual hand flew back to Alabama to help with his family’s farm seasonal harvest. Not that Draco had any idea what that actually meant. He nodded along, offering little, harmless information about himself, but mostly listening.
“Sorry” the boy said “You didn’t notice but the little girl in front of you dropped this”. His heavily accented tone was friendly enough but Draco could hear the hint of suspicion. He shrugged, unwilling to feel guilty, and the Muggle rolled his eyes, turning to get the attention of the family.
“Blaiseee! Is being painfully slow part of your upbringing, or do you take pleasure in torturing me?” Theo whined, his fingers drumming impatiently on the table. Next to him, Blaise was cutting his omelette in pieces so small Draco suspected it was very likely the second option.
Thursday morning Draco found himself distractedly pecking food while double checking his notes on the new type of fertiliser they were experimenting on. Working in a group made of some of the top Potions students in the school had revealed to be a very engaging experience. Draco was used to be the best in the class, and while knowing that he was naturally gifted in the subject he couldn’t deny Snape had favourited him over the others. So much so that his attention had diminished and by fifth year he found the class rather easy and boring. Now, where he had to confront his knowledge and ideas with people on his same skills level, his interest had sparked again. He found some of the other students theories rather brilliant and their common ground had allowed them to share them maturely. He was with equals and he was truly appreciating the challenge of keeping up with minds that were alike and yet different.
When the bucket was finally empty, she turned around to face him, and said “So you must not be dangerous” as a statement. As if it was a fact.
Draco had spent most of sixth year in the Room of Hidden Things, and it was like coming home. A terrible home, full of bad memories and loneliness, the home you were forced into and couldn’t avoid because of obligations, but from where you wanted nothing more than a way out. Potter had unwillingly been his lifeline, the light at the end of the dark tunnel of his despair, showing him there was still a door out of this place that was claiming his sanity. He had given him what Draco needed, the knowledge he was not alone. And now here they were, together, somewhere Draco thought he would never set his foot in again, and he was standing behind two people that wanted the other boy dead. He felt sick. All the noises from outside had died and the room was eerily silent. He had never bothered to look around, never wanted to, but now his eyes were caught by the immensity of the place, a huge labyrinth of precariously stacked objects created by centuries of students stumbling upon the room they just so appeared to need.
The airport was huge and confusing. More people that Draco had ever seen together swarmed around each other in various degrees of haste, but almost all acting as if they were late to something.
He had been an outcast himself, in the last year, never finding a place where he was truly comfortable, and knowing what it meant he felt shame for his actions.
The Gryffindork switched his pj bottoms for his own pair of purple trunks, which Draco’s mother would have deemed inappropriately short. On top of everything else, California seemed to have changed the idiot’s preference towards baggy clothes.
The portraits turned their head in sync to look at the newcomers. Draco noticed that the two belonging to the most recent Headmasters were hung directly behind McGonagall’s chair, Snape’s on the left. His frame was slightly smaller and less adorned, but the resemblance and accuracy of details of the picture were astounding. Dumbledore greeted them with a small smile, but the Potion Master ignored Potter in favour of giving Draco a scrutinising stare.
“I think Longbottom would like to try the Cruciatus curse, see if a little bit of pain teaches him how to treat his superiors”
Cars sped around them, loud and unfamiliar sounds of a world he didn’t belong to, and his wandering gaze landed on a huge poster of a suggestive woman in lingerie, eerie in her stillness. Draco had never felt so wrong footed and out of place as he was in that moment, the adrenaline and novelty of two days of travel finally crashing down on him, leaving him disoriented. But he couldn't possibly say all that, not without sounding insane or, worse, like an idiot.
“Ha- Evan. I might not know you well -“, not as well as I’d like “but I am sure that whatever you put your mind to, you’ll do just fine. Better than that, you’ll do great”.
Draco peeled it the rest of the way off the wall. Even with half of his face hidden, he could recognise the other boy clearly. Potter’s mouth was pulled into an embarrassed grin, his cheeks flushed pink and, although the picture was cut at bust level, from the hunch of his shoulder he was obviously standing with his hands in his pockets.
“Hey. . . Hello, everybody” Longbottom cleared his voice “Well, now that we are all here, we could decide the groups. We will take a break tomorrow but it would be nice to have them set up already for Monday”
“When you are finished with your praise, I don’t need your fucking pity either.” Draco interrupted, his skin crawling with barely repressed emotions. He needed to act, needed Potter’s face under his fists.
Potter. Harry. Who until now had kept his eyes trained on his mother, diverted his gaze. Draco, that had found himself often more interested in watching the other boy than the memories, looked again at the way Snape’s regret had changed him and, consequently, the fate of the war. A man, fighting constantly with his own childhood beliefs and experiences, that told him to hate James Potter’s son while the boy looked at him with Lily’s eyes. As Dumbledore accused him to only see what he expected to see, Draco knew he too had been guilty of making the same mistake. He listened while the two wizards discussed the punishment Lord Voldemort had set upon his family and how the man he had been supposed to kill had ultimately saved his life. And then he watched, horrified, as the same man confessed Harry Potter had to die.
“I’ll teach you the spell. But, Draco, they are somewhat connected to triggers of magic, a failsafe of sort, if you wish. It doesn’t mean he will regain everything if he sees you using your wand in front of him, but it might bring some memories back. So, you need to be careful, at least until the end of July. I am not sure how long it will take you to find him, though, so you should prepare to leave soon”. And with that he was up and pacing the kitchen as if soon meant right there and then.
“So,” he asked cautiously, “you are looking for a way out of your current living arrangements, am I correct?”
“I was aware that the inability of keeping your mouth shut was a Gryffindor’s trait, but this is edging on self arm”.
He felt his heart sinking and moved to turn away, when Harry’s playful tone added “Aren’t you coming?”
His aunt Bellatrix chimed in, voice sickly sweet and enamoured, assuring her Lord of the immense pleasure of being able to provide him with their family house and services. Not your house, Draco wanted to shout. Not our pleasure. Potter would have done it, tell the truth in the face of death, stupid, maybe, reckless, yes. Draco was proud of his self control. Or was it fear? For a brief moment an image of his own grave with the wording Draco Lucius Malfoy, 17, died stupid but brave appeared in his mind but he shook it away. He was no Potter but he was surely well on his way to be crazy. The discussion had shifted toward his extended family and Draco partially listen to the Dark Lord mocking Bellatrix about his other estranged aunt and the marriage of her daughter to his ex Defence Professor. Draco had been nasty with Professor Lupin but he secretly thought him to be the best Defence teacher they had so far. Not that the competition was worthy. Suddenly he heard his name and he froze in terror, startled. Everybody was laughing maliciously and it took him a minute to understand the question.
His eyes remained fixed on the harsh lights above him until it became painful. One of the little round bulbs was broken, dull, and for some reasons that bothered him immensely. Electricity, he scoffed unimpressed. Nothing in this fucking muggle world seemed to be going right. Just as he thought so, the two remaining bulbs started flickering until they burned out with a final sizzle, casting the kitchen in semidarkness. Draco could hear his heart pumping, could feel it beating against his ribcage like a mad bird. The floor was suddenly cold and he squirmed, scrambling up until the wall was behind his back, solid and supporting. He had always been in control of his magic, since he was five. Since forever. Long before most of the other kids and yet, here he was, frying fucking lightbulbs like a toddler.
“As I recall, you were often the one-“ Draco started, preparing himself for the resulting punch, but something in the other boy’s face left the words dying on his lips.
“Oh, please Po-Harry, let me take a picture of that martyr look. The Prophet is going to have a field day with an image of their agonizing hero”. He pleaded.
The remaining twin had visited Hogwarts during the week and spent some time with Professor Flitwick and his group.
Granger and her freckly boyfriend looked like they hadn’t slept in months. Her red-rimmed eyes still glistened with tears and Draco spared Weasley a look of contempt when the ginger sniffed loudly.
“Draco?” Snape’s eyes were questioning and something in the hunted look on Draco’s face seemed to soften the man’s demeanour. For a moment he thought his former Professor wanted to add something, but nothing came. Draco fled.
Potter never did well in front of a camera, and Draco almost smiled before realising that this assessment was not in line with what he had always believed about the other boy. It didn’t ring any less true. He frowned. Despite Potter being a huge attention seeker, Draco had noticed more than once before how the other wizard often looked flustered and uncomfortable under the spotlight.
“No.” Draco interrupted again, raising to his feet. “As extravagant as it might sound to you, I need sleep.” He deliberately ran his eyes over the other man’s figure, mouth twisted in disdain. He wasn’t sure when was the last time Lupin had slept, but the weariness from the approaching full-moon only accentuated further the signs of exhaustion on his already pale skin.
The first flight passed in a haze between tension and fascination, and it was over too soon. By the time the disembodied voice from above announced the approaching landing, Draco couldn’t remember having looked away once from the enthralling expanse of clouds lazily slipping away from underneath them. Even on his broom, he had never flown that high and everything seemed so calm and white up there. With his thoughts still captivated by this new perspective over the world, the sudden descend left him feeling somewhat cheated.
“Yeah. It was the first name that popped into my head and it stuck.” Potter admitted, rubbing the back of his neck. “Wait, am I missing something?”
with my parents being divorced and my mum moving back to France -“ He stopped, blushing sheepishly at Draco’s annoyed expression.
“Because you know me so well” Harry sighed, shaking his head “It really helps. . . to relax and focus, I mean. And it’s a challenge, I’ve always liked a challenge”. He raised his chin and locked Draco in a gaze that just proved so, but the Slytherin was still thinking about his first statement. Because you know me so well, and Merlin’s beard if that wasn’t true.
“But look at him carefully, look! Come closer! Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv —”.
The sound of steps was getting closer and Draco knew. His heart clenched painfully, and suddenly he wanted this long day to last a little bit longer. A little more time.
When Draco didn’t respond her went on as if talking to himself “I guessed nobody was thinking of him. And I really don’t know how I feel, I mean he was a pretty horrible person to me my whole life. . . But he did a lot for me too. And he had to do it in secret, so that nobody actually knew who he really was. . . It must have been pretty lonely, so I wanted to remember him —“
All Draco could see now was the destruction of the room and Granger’s blood pooling red on the floor.
I know in the book Draco calls Crabbe and Goyle by surname but I thought that was a bit too impersonal for someone going trough the mental changes I am making him have.
Oh father, what fools we have been, living our life mocking people for being less when we feared they were, in truth, much more, Draco pondered sadly. The perception of not actually being that special that had hit him hard that time at 11, when Potter refused his hand for a Weasley, came back stronger and, more than ever before, he felt small and insignificant. The people that had worshipped him when his family was well known and influential were quick to turn their backs once the Malfoys had lost it all. And at the end, now that it could truly be The End, he was alone.
“She took the best view!” The other wizard joked, not sounding resentful in the slightest. “And I got stuck with that stunning transmission pole”.
“Muggles are people, Draco. And Harry might have not been lucky with the ones he grew up with but he spent more than half of his life as one of them. He knew it in his bones how to adapt, and it was the safest option. Magic is not everything, despite what you were raised to believe”.
The threat, aimed craftily at the pupils,  had the power to make McGonagall hold her tongue, and both the student and teacher bodies fell quiet. Draco was disturbed that grown men would jeopardise the safety of what were mostly underage children. He had never thought about the other students of Hogwarts as possible victims of the war, probably never really cared before, but, after seeing Professor Burbage die, his little bubble had popped and now the reality of what was happening had hit him full force. He tried not to think about what would be of some of the wizards and witches that were in the Great Hall with him at that very moment if the Dark Lord was to win the war. People he had shared classes and meals with, or simply just passed across in the corridors, students that weren’t even fully qualified, just children or barely more. Somehow he doubted there would be mercy.
Draco was about to point out that he could have used one of his hands instead, when a bubble appeared from the liquid, inflating like a balloon and propelling the other wizard across the kitchen with a loud pop. It was over so quickly that Draco had to wonder if it actually happened, but Lupin’s slumped body against the cabinets was proof that something, at least, had happened.
Potter brought his friends back to reality and the moment was broken but the telling tinge of pink still lingered on their cheeks, their tired expressions a little bit brighter. The trio walked in front of the wall three times and Draco felt Vince and Greg move behind him. He made it trough the door just in time.
Draco watched while the parents thanked him profusely as if he was the second coming of Merlin himself, but the git only shook his head with nonchalant modesty. That, for some reason, irritated him immensely. He took in the boy’s figure, lingering on the mop of unruly, chestnut hair. He had an open, pleasant face, but his hair was truly terrible. Draco huffed in contempt.
“A clever plan, a very clever plan... and as you said it, under my nose” Draco felt oddly comforted by the praise, but then the fear came back when the Headmaster listed his unsuccessful attempts and assured him to have been aware of his plan all along. Fear and something like doubt, at the mentioning of Professor Snape. Draco had been irritated by the professor’s meddling in his business and he wanted to snort derisively at the old man conviction of Snape’s loyalty, but the fierce tone in Dumbledore voice stopped him. Snape? He didn’t have time to think about it.
Amycus was scanning the room when he stopped on Theo, and Draco’s heart sank. “Nott, perhaps” the Death Eater said, putting a hand on Theo’s shoulder. Draco saw his friend moving backwards out of the touch, eyes wild, but Amycus didn’t seem to notice and continued “lets see if you are as good of a wizard as your brother was”.
The knowledge that Potter was behind that flimsy wooden barrier, probably looking like the entitled speccy git he had always been, made Draco vibrate in anticipation. His hand raised on its own accord, as if to knock, but Scott quickly pulled another set of keys from his pocket and unceremoniously unlocked the door, already yelling “Honey, I am home!”, the “os” stretching ridiculously.
“Oh yeah” Draco replied with mock casualty “Just fresh from my 17th party actually. I have to say, between my father's birthday wishes from prison and the impending matter of murdering the Headmaster, I made the most of it. Why, are you thinking of getting me a belated present?”
“I agree with Dean” an amused voice said from behind and Granger came into view, followed by Potter and the two Weasleys. “Honestly, you guys, this is what’s wrong with the Wizarding World”.
The Ministry had fallen and Draco knew that this year the train ride would take him to a school that looked unchanged but was at the same time completely different. He didn’t like different, nowadays.
Technically, he could even claim to have seen telly before, as his longest flight provided a small, black frame lodged at the back of every seat, where tiny Muggles moved around soundlessly, completely unconcerned about his existence. He had barely paid them any mind in return, before slipping into his potion induced slumber. Really, he didn’t see what the fuss was about.
“Oh, sod off, you wanker. Anyway,” he said, turning his abnormally green eyes back to Draco “she is great!”
“Lucky me!” Draco mumbled “I suppose this is the moment to make you aware of my lack of underwear and general clothing. No offence, but I am not planning to keep wearing Potter’s.”
As it was, after his feet collided with what appeared to be solid air, it had taken only a glance at the empty space in front of him to know. He had found him.
The soft rosey light reflected on Harry’s glasses, pink and gold. “Hey” he responded, and Draco felt like climbing a steep set of stairs. The first step had been taken.
But, despite knowing that his own life was only going to get harder, a part of him still carried the little hope of his mother’s words that, for Harry, everything was gonna turn out ok.
“Yes” Draco gritted out. His flight was early the next morning and most of his day had been spent mechanically folding his new clothes by hand, in the desperate hope to keep his mind numb. As much as he had tried arguing against it, international portkeys were only released with the Ministry approval. It was a commodity they could not afford when playing “find the Potter before they find you”, so he had to swallow years of mistrust and loathing and put his life in the hands of Muggle’s dubious physic knowledge. While he had, in fact, tried listening to Lupin’s long list of reasons why airplanes were perfectly safe, actually being inside the thing was gonna be a completely different matter. Draco suspected that, even when presented with solid evidence of an airplane actually flying, part of him would always believe they had no business doing so.
“I have a mission for you” Draco said, putting a little gold coin in the rough hand of the creature and wishing that, for once, things will go his way.
“Cut the crap, ferret!” There was a hint of craze in Weasley’s blue eyes and Draco took an involuntary step back. “Where. Is. Harry?”
I came up with the spell “Obliviscere” as an alternative to “Obliviate”. I consider this spell similar to the one used to Hermione (and never stated) to plant new memories into her parents minds before sending them to Australia.
She gave him a small smile, just a slight lift of her lips “I guess”. From the corner of her eyes, she saw Theo entering the Common Room and, placing one hand on top of Draco’s, she levered herself up. Her touch lingered for a moment and then, with a quick nod, she left.
The Gryffindor in front of him, the still lingering roundness of youth made rough by the wear of too many punishments, was far from the nervous boy Draco used to made fun of.
Sorry for the late update but life is very crazy right now so it’ll be a bit sporadic for a while. Enjoy Draco’s angst, because I do 🙃
The hotdog looked both disgusting and the best thing he had ever held, and when the vendor had impatiently asked if he wanted ketchup Draco had agreed without thinking.
Draco smirked “Well, yes, all that too. But… he brought it on himself.” For a long time, he had blamed the other wizard for his father’s imprisonment, but as soon as the words were out of his mouth he realised how much he actually meant them.
Draco thought about all the expectations that he had always tried to live up to, how his life seemed planned out from birth to follow a path, where his name and his family’s were meant to stand out in the crowd, well aware of the importance of people’s opinions of them. About how he was supposed to marry a wealthy witch and continue his family legacy. He had always cared.
Draco thought of his own childhood, always pampered and spoilt. It was clear than Snape did not receive such attentions, as the child looked neglected and ignored, but when he spoke of the Wizarding World he had the same confidence of Draco. He was obviously proud of being a wizard. The fact that he only had eyes for Lily while the other girl, who appeared quite ordinary, was ignored was a further statement of his preferences. Draco had found out that both Snape and Voldemort had Muggle fathers and both had been resolved to distance themselves from that world.
Draco had only begrudgingly accepted Harry's invitation because he couldn't think of a kind way to say
"You lot are an extraordinary bunch, indeed! We've thus far been going over some of basic spells that are sure to come up on your NEWTS and I've been surprised by your skills in light of so many professorial changes."
Harry gasped and Draco kissed at the corners of his mouth as he slowly eased inside of him, centimeter by centimeter. He relished the way Harry's body resisted and pushed back against him while simultaneously clinching tight around his cock, trying to swallow him whole.
"I'm bored. Want to choke me with your cock in the bathroom? You know, proof that I'm all yours and all that?" he added, salaciously, when Harry sputtered into his drink.
Draco's face softened as comprehension dawned. Harry's eyes were drawn to the way he worried his lip, conflicted. Finally, Draco took a big step back and opened the door wide to let Harry in.
"I've got it, Harry!" said Melissa, one of his favorite volunteers at the center. He nodded his appreciations and, waving his wand to make the glitter and braids and bows disappear, went to make sure the pet pygmy puffs were fed.
Draco's heart sped up but he didn't look up from his book. "What is it, Potter?" he said with trained indifference. To both his delight and chagrin, Harry sat down opposite him in response.
"Who here can also cast a corporeal patronus?" He, Blaise, Daphne, and Theo were the only ones to put their hands down.
"Looky looky. What a sight we have here!" came Yaxley's haughty voice. "You like cock don't you, Mr. Potter?"
His unexpected business trip back home to England had been, by all accounts, a success. He'd managed to save Blaise's arse and potentially position Z&M International as
They had barely had even a moment to breathe between giving statements, filling out paperwork, and managing press; but it was all worth it because, after what's already being hailed as the speediest trial in wizengamot history, Sebastian Krafft was officially behind bars and under strict dementor watch in Azkaban!
"Draw him out, how?" Harry suddenly looked like he did when he got all protective and possessive and Draco noticed him unconsciously reach for the ring hanging from his neck.
Sebastian nodded and then smiled down at the polished blunt instrument. He lifted it into the air and beamed at it, proudly.
he gasped when a surge of pure, unadulterated power sung through his veins the moment his fingers wrapped around the base!
"We'd better go and grab our seats, Harry. Are you going to be alright?" She asked, eying him warily. He sighed, defeated, and nodded his agreement.
"Ok guys, the DA will walk among you to give you tips, answer any questions you may have, and unstun you. For now, I want you to only practice those 3 spells. I don't want to see any wandlight that's any color other than red!"
"Oh..." he said again. "Hmm... I don't know if I can do that without Harry... But I'll try. It'll help if Luna's there, she always throws me off guard!"
Hannah nodded enthusiastically. "Neville and I had just left the greenhouses after helping professor sprout pot mandrakes for extra house points. We ran into Ron on our way back to the castle."
"Yes, home stretch, indeed! Mark my words, Minister: Draco and I are confident that this will be looked back on as one of the most lucrative events in wizarding history!" Blaise raised his glass and Draco pulled his head out of his arse to do the same and say his farewells.
"While that sounds like a lovely idea for you and Draco to do on date nights, how about you just ask me yes or no questions and if I don't say anything you have your answer?"
Draco groaned. "Salazar, I swear if Blaise doesn't come through that gate in the next hour with Ginny in tow to end all of this then I'm going to find him and kill him myself."
So, we decided to be a couple of airheads." She shrugged as Luna smiled warmly and intertwined their fingers.
Draco pulled him even tighter to his side and kissed his forehead as Fleur floated in snacks from the kitchen, Charlie and his Romanian boyfriend got the first round of exploding snaps going, and everyone shouted Mrs. Weasley down when she tried to put on Celestina Warbeck.
Soft, slightly chapped lips brushed against his and he could feel Harry's fast, heavy breathing ghosting against them. They kissed so sweetly, so gentle that Draco nearly came undone.
Draco quirked a sceptical brow and examined the plate of chocolate chip pancakes closely, lifting them with a fork to check in between.
Despite their efforts, the aurors were still closing in, strong, and Harry had to wonder if they really stood a chance. But then, miraculously (or maybe not so miraculously), some of them appeared to stand down.
He noticed the stares and hushed voices that followed in his wake but feigned ignorance. It was annoying. Everywhere he went, he heard whispers of Lucius and the Dark Lord and Stupid. Fucking. Potter. The audacity that that decidedly mediocre plebeian would be mentioned in the same breath as someone as noble as his father or as great as the Dark Lord! It was laughable! Urgh, did no one else see Potter for what he really was: no more than a skilless but ridiculously lucky bastard with a questionable pedigree?
trusted global wizarding investment banking firm. Blaise was already ecstatically thinking about the next stage of their expansion and fantasizing about becoming the wizarding Barclay's when he left, but something wasn't sitting right with Draco and he couldn't put his finger on it...
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
"Now," The more pressing concern: "What on Earth are we supposed to do here for four hours until Blaise and Ginny's portkey?"
Harry rubbed at the back of his neck. "I don't know, Draco. I think... maybe I could... I don't even..." He looked so conflicted and Draco wanted to reach out again and sooth him. Harry shook his head, bemused. "It doesn't matter! This is all too much and a week and a half is not enough time for me to figure it out -- for
He felt the magic building in his core and the patio furniture began to quake. He took a deep breath and tried to keep his voice even as he talked.
"Why are we here, Sebastian?" he asked, edging closer to the safety of the forest's edge. Harry's earlier slip-up already made him guess that the Elder Wand was somewhere on the grounds. He hadn't the foggiest where it actually was and he couldn't imagine that Sebastian would either. Thus, he was fully expecting some kind of ill-fated scavenger hunt through the greenhouses or Hagrid's pumpkin patch.
"Well, you know I was raised by muggles so if you ever need any help stuuu-dying..." he yawned. The sleep was finally starting to hit him. He laid back and rested his eyes for a moment.
Harry ignored Jansen's bizarre peacocking and focused on the wand. He waited until the man bent down, close, before he reared back and head-butted him right in the nose.
But the poor dear -- I don't think she was quite right." The muggle woman shook her head. "She looked truly petrified. Maybe still in shock from the fall? But anyways, she was clutching on to this broken stick for dear life and when I tried to get her to have a seat so I could call someone to look her over, she just took off running out the door! She must've been injured because she had a slight limp."
His panic eased as he noticed the jumper, trousers, and school robes laid out on the chair and a tray with toast, eggs, sausage and fruit spread out on the coffee table.
He'd guessed from the moment he'd been apparated to the sleepy little town of Hogsmead and led to the Shrieking Shack that this night didn't bode well for him. Death by murderous tree was not, however, what he'd had in mind.
Harry's eyes followed an intricately braided, blonde, fishtail down the curve of an elegant neck to its pulse point and back up to where the loveliest shade of pink bloomed on delicate, pale cheeks and rosy lips parted
Lucius, like most other captured death eaters, was still sat in Azkaban awaiting trial as the Ministry was really drawing out the process. Draco and his mother had been there for only three weeks but it had been the most miserable three weeks of his life. He would be forever haunted by the screams of misery and hopelessness held within those walls. Just when he felt himself giving in to irrevocable despair, he was told that mother and his trials had been expedited. No one told him why, but he had his theories.
Harry bestowed soft, sweet, teasing kisses to swollen lips. He sucked gently on the delicate skin there and smirked triumphantly when he heard the sleepy, needy little moan he'd been waiting for. His tongue slipped inside, plundering deeper as if in desperate search of the sweet nectar at the center of that warm, wet, source of heat. Ginny opened up further and her hands made their way to his hair as she rocked against him, silently begging him for more.
I've ever worked for! And to think, you were only supposed to be a decoy! Enough of a distraction to shake up the bloke's already fucked up marriage so that it'd look too incriminating for Potter if he didn't cooperate. Then you'd come back to Melbourne, Potter would give up the wand, and you and I would probably be back to sipping coffee right now."
"Not since last week. We were meant to get lunch yesterday but she must've forgotten. I suppose she's having a rough week." Her expression saddened. "I know she's had a lot on her mind."
"You know I'm not worried about who knows, right? Not here and not in our world either if that's what you think... I wasn't not out, I was just... married. To a woman." He rolled his eyes at himself and scratched at the back of his neck, sheepishly. "It just never comes up when you're married to a woman -- but I'm not ashamed!"
"All done, dear," she said after a minute or two. "Take it easy the rest of the day and rest up, you should be fine. Mr. Potter, I believe Headmistress McGonagall would like to see you in her office to try and understand just what happened this afternoon. Apparently your Ministry PR rep has already asked to floo in."
The members of the wizengamot were filing down the hall and into to courtroom. They watched as they walked right past the dementors, untouched.
At first, he thought nothing of it as the sweet, light melody of Ms. Jackson's voice reached his ears. But then, he started paying attention to the lyrics and his jaw dropped.
"Now, are you done with your obligatory Gryffindor martyr shite, so we can grab something to eat before we find little Ms. Weaselette and clear your name? I'm famished."
"Potter is an excellent Auror and a magnificent wizard. He can handle this," he reassured himself and then grimaced, grateful that no one was around to hear him admit that aloud.
What he did want? He still didn't know exactly -- at least not when he thought about Bubblykicks' question:
"Give it a taste, hun. Let me know if it's sweet enough," she encouraged as she slid the cup across the counter.
He heard a loud sniff to his left and opened his eyes. Parvati Patil stood on the steps, eyes welling with tears as she looked around, lost. Draco looked at her awkwardly and then gazed wistfully towards the lake he so desperately wanted to already be sitting at, his free period promptly dwindling away. He sighed. Whatever Theo thought, this new leaf shite was real and took a lot more work and selflessness than he ever would've thought it would.
The man eventually stopped swearing and demanding to be unhanded long enough to notice them standing there.
"What in the?" Yaxley howled, letting go of Harry's hair, eyes searching for his wand. Rowle was a beat behind him but the fire was spreading quickly with so many flammable books, parchments, and ominous potions ingredients littered about the room. They gave up on the wand search to try to put it out manually, pants still around their ankles.
"GRAM! Did you see?!" he yelled back towards the house as Andromenda stepped out onto the porch, smirk firmly in place. "Draco's here!"
"What is this? Why can't I leave this God forsaken forest?!" He pointed the Elder Wand at the edge of the forest that led back to the castle and fired a powerfully charged jinx that, instead of flying straight out into the grounds, cracked like thunder as it richocheted off of what appeared to be an invisible wall.
Harry frowned murderously and cracked his neck before wandlessly sending the beefy man flying backwards against the opposite wall. The room shook, furniture was upturned, and portraits fell as Harry marched up to Hristofor, who now lay in a heap eying the wand that had flown just out of reach.
mostly just a crock of bullshite, there are still kernels of truth every now and again," he said, haughtily straightening his grey waistcoat and adjusting the caped travelers cloak draped over his shoulders.
Draco swallowed thickly as he pulled away and nodded as he made to leave with renewed hope and a plan forming with each step.
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
Draco filled with dread as he looked down into somber green eyes as picture Harry was marched away by Robards, himself, his hands magically bound behind his back. He paled, panic-stricken as he read the headline.
He waited until the delicate lace was fully spit-soaked before sitting back on his heels, green eyes wide and adoring. Draco smiled and bent down to kiss him, teasingly, before taking his chin in hand and squeezing his jaw so that his lips puckered and fell open at his whim.
"Come now, don't be ridiculous, Draco. I've already had Alexandra book you a portkey that will get you here by Sunday afternoon our time and, for added insurance, I've already reached out to your parents to let them know that you'll be visiting and just how excited you are to see them." He smirked smugly.
These dungeon rooms were designed to rob you of all sense of time but Harry guessed that it had to have not quite been 24 hours since they'd thrown him in here. He only prayed that they might have developed some
"Well... what happened today, happened before." He paused and looked at the floor. Then he felt Draco's leg press encouragingly against him and Hermione's hand came to rest on his left knee. He looked up to find that he had everyone's attention, even the portraits. "The summer before 6th year... I was..." He looked back to the floor. "Kidnapped and sexually assaulted by two death eaters."
Harry did feel like he melted every time Draco's tongue touched him so maybe he was on to something. It took a few more firm but gentle thrusts until Draco was fully buried in him. Harry held his breath, afraid to move.
Bullocks, the Elder Wand is just a myth!" He rolled his eyes indignantly, expecting the old man to laugh at any moment now and admit that he was just taking the piss. Instead he just stared meaningfully at Potter who stared back, avoiding Draco's gaze.
"So... she wasn't looking at the lamp, then. Merlin, right in front of my face," he huffed, bitterly.
"You can't let him get to you, Malfoy," he said without taking his eyes off of the task at hand. Draco had been briefly distracted, mesmerized even, when he realized that Potter had begun carefully, yet, wandlessly lifting out some of the more embedded shards before the words finally registered.
"Well..." She gave him that same rueful smile that Ron had. "Harry... You know... Ginny thought that you guys should go on a break so that you could explore some things..."
"So what? Neither has anyone else! It's not my fault that the stupid git had to go and break the all-time record!"
Right. It had to be a cruel joke or scam of some sort and he could floo over to Luna's right now and prove it.
"The timing was completely coincidental, I assure you. More a reflection of my unfortunate luck than anything," he said breathily as Harry reached out to tuck long, soft strands of blonde hair behind his ear. "The closet is a dangerous place. Can make you miss out on so much
The large floor was split up into sections. Nearest to him was a room where a number of nervous looking teenagers were preparing to take their apparition test.
"Ah," Draco said, exchanging a wry look with Andromeda. "Well I for one wouldn't know much about that one, Teddy, I've always preferred to kiss blokes," he said, casually, before sipping his tea.
"Never mind, just wake her already," Harry pressed. He had so many questions that needed answers -- now!
Not even fifteen minutes went by before Draco returned, fully dressed in his posh clothes, hair in its perfect fishtail, and a cup of fresh-brewed coffee in each hand. Harry stared at him in awed disbelief when he carefully tiptoed around scattered parchments, handed him one of the cups, and gracefully lowered himself down beside him. He reached for a file.
Draco sniffed and wiped his nose on Harry's t-shirt before he finally cracked one eye and peaked up at him.
Draco twisted his mouth, wryly, in thought. His disguise had been shot to shite back at the ministry by the time they'd made their escape but there had been so much going on that he had no idea if anyone had worked out who Harry Potter's accomplice was, yet.
Draco worried his lip as he contemplated the possibility. It was clear that he wished he could reassure him that it wouldn't be the case but...
Ollivander turned wide, fervent eyes to Draco who took a cautious step back, instinctively guarding his wand with his injured hand.
"Yea, good one!" said Dean who'd come over and clapped Draco on the shoulder. Draco looked a little stiff so Harry walked over and put a hand on his back and he immediately felt his tension ease.
Draco shot him a questioning brow. Harry simply smirked as he reached into his pocket and pulled out the Hawthorn wand and placed it in his palm.
!" he groaned as he snatched the aforementioned letter asking for the date, time and place of said party. "And I know for a fact he's already received the invitation with all the details spelled out in big, bold prints! Well, one thing's for sure: I do not want to be the poor git who lets Pansy and Granger know the cat's out of the bag!"
Draco smiled, affectionately, as he studied Harry's snoozing form, his heart warming as he took in each insignificant detail. He marveled at the way the sunbeams refracted through the damask patterns of the sheer curtains to dance in the raven strands of hair bent at odd angles and illuminated the barely-there freckles on Harry's face. He tried to commit them each to memory before taking in the way long, black eyelashes fanned out over the tops of Harry's cheeks. And, of course, there was the lightning shaped scar that made the man he loved
Draco watched from underneath the cloak as Yaxley and Rowle each grabbed Potter underneath an arm, still frozen in that stupid position with that shocked look on his face, and carried him off back into the building from which they'd come.
He almost cringed at the voice in his head but, instead, he slowed his breathing and embraced the memory of his 16th birthday and Aunt Bellatrix's repeated use of the
. Of course, since most things in his life counted as hard on average and complicated at best, it meant that he had utterly poured every bit of himself into it in these past eight years (including training) which, he recognized, was the main reason why he was being promoted so early in the first place. Should he tell them that it was probably ruining his marriage? Or that, despite the fact that this move theoretically meant more paper-pushing behind a desk and less danger and time out in the field, that the idea of sitting still terrified him more than facing dark magic?
Harry could be a boy, somewhere along the sand and the ocean, while the men fought in the conflict he had already given so much of his youth to. It felt somewhat wrong, making the choice for him, but then Harry hadn’t chosen to be the obsession of a madman either.
Draco prayed for some of that Gryffindor sheer luck. “Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM” he yelled, wandless. Helpless. But that was enough distraction to give Potter the needed time to turn the fight around.
“It was lovely, receiving your wishes” she told her friends, with such sincerity it almost made sense that knowing they cared was all she had needed to make her captivity bearable.
Lupin eyed him curiously, weighing the question like Draco was the one being a cryptic bastard. “Shrieking Shack” he replied, persisting in making zero fucking sense. “And Cardiff, but that hardly matters.”
Theo stood there facing a man with his same blue eyes but not much else in common. Draco froze, just barely hidden by the corner.
At the same time Draco though that Lily was changing Snape’s mindset. He saw the boy growing conflicted, while his feeling for his friend grew stronger. He saw them being sorted into different houses, their path separated by more than two tables. He saw his own father sitting beside Snape, proud of his colours, welcoming the new member. Despite being were he had hoped to be, the little boy’s eyes were sad. He though again about how the sorting was a way to unite but at the same time to divide. Then, he remembered Macmillan, telling Creevey’s parents about him. Luna, feeding Thestrals in the forest while talking to him like a friend. Potter, accepting his request without second thoughts. And maybe the separation was only in people’s mind, and the war did change some things for the better.
But that wasn’t what Draco was thinking, so he said it without realising how weird it sounded “Your mother”.
You are taking away another person’s liberty, their control, she had said. Pain goes away, as much as it hurts in the moment, it will pass. Death is a different matter, because when you are taking a life there is no coming back, but it’s the people who loved the deceased the ones that will have to live with the consequences.
Draco darted his gaze from Potter’s hand to his face, confused. He had expected the other wizard to ask him why, to be inquisitive. Even suspicious.
He picked a small baguette, still warm from the oven, and started buttering it, already checking the jam options with the corner of his eyes.
Draco was pulled closer and now mere inches from the other boy’s face, eyes scanning wildly for something. He would not look at the scar. He. Would. Not. And then he saw it, Potter’s nose, the only part of his physiognomy that wasn’t altered beyond recognition, was littered by a number of freckles. They were so faint, but for three that formed an almost perfect line on the right side of the bridge, that they were unnoticeable unless standing close. Intimately close. Draco had never been so near Potter and that detail, those tiny spots of brown on his school nemesis’s skin, helped him regain control. His Potter didn’t have freckles.
He fished Evan’s passport out of his pocket, running his thumb along the edge a few times before pushing it towards the boy.
“Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately. You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.”
“That.” It came after a beat, but something told him that this wasn’t exactly something Lupin had been unaware of. How disappointing.
Now that he had Harry alone he wasn’t really sure what exactly he wanted to say. He stepped closer, careful not to alarm the other boy of his presence and taking advantages of his unawareness to observe him better. This year, Harry seemed uncharacteristically concerned with his studies and Draco thought that the lack of a threat looming over his shoulders, making the future a probability more than an uncertainty, might be playing a role in his newfound commitment. From his standpoint Draco could only see him from the back but the messy stack of books and a half written transfiguration essay at his left told him the other boy was not simply basking in the sun filtering trough the window. He was sitting on the rather large bay of one of the massive windows opening the wall of the unused section of the Fourth floor. His head was bent forward in concentration and Draco could hear a soft chanting of incantations, almost whispered in a strange lulling way. A clicking sound and a small cry of triumph broke Draco from his dazed state and Harry suddenly spoke
What an iconic moment the sorting truly was. Little children, that before then were simply Matthew, and Lucy, and David and Zara, were now supposed to be a brave Gryffindor, or a clever Ravenclaw, a friendly Hufflepuff or a cunning Slytherin. He could see in their tense young faces that, this year, such identification was more of a curse than a blessing.
Encouraged by the mention of something he finally recognized, Draco relaxed into this new effortless banter.
Draco was still thinking about what Granger had said when luck wanted that he spotted just the person he was looking for. He was half way to the castle when he noticed a patch of yellow just at the edge of the forest. There was only one person that would agree to wear one of Granger’s obnoxious knitted hats, and a bright yellow one at that.
Draco was left alone, whatever scathing retort dying on his lips, shaken by the parting words of a stranger that, with so little effort, wished him more than he had ever dared to wish for himself.
He sounded so affectionate that Draco spared a moment to wonder if the two were involved as more than friends, but then Potter directed his thumb towards the third boy with a cheeky grin.
The werewolf had spent the previous afternoon patrolling the area around the airport in search of the best spot for them to apparate to, so it was of no surprise to Draco when they landed in a deserted alley behind some old buses. He shook the other man’s grip off his forearm and glared “It smells of piss!”
The Gryffindor pushed his glasses up his nose and the conversation appeared to be stalling once more.
“Allright, you know how he gets when he is inactive for too long. He was ready to bounce off the walls. I come from there actually, that’s why I’m a little late. Brought him breakfast, he was up at 5:30 if you believe it.” He told her, lifting tray after tray full of pastries from inside the crates.
It had felt like the foulest sin to pick it up and pocket it swiftly whilst the house was preoccupied with Harry’s disappearance. Sirius’ words resounded sharp in his mind, accusations of betrayal. Vile! Nasty! Wrong!
The end-of-spring air filtered heavily through the castle’s windows, carrying the smell of rain and, strangely, of wet dog. Magic bubbled under Draco’s skin, making the fine hair of his forearms stand under the baggy sleeves of his shirt. Powerful. Deadly.
Draco turned around to see Luna. A few feet behind her, stood a Hufflepuff boy, Macmillan, watching him with a look of distrustful curiosity.
At the end, some people stayed behind. Draco, who had been talking to Daphne and Luna, found himself tuning out when the Ravenclaw had breached the subject of Freshwater Plimpies.
“But I got this far, didn’t I?” he said slowly. “They thought I’d die in the attempt, but I’m here . . . and you’re in my power. . . . I’m the one with the wand. . . . You’re at my mercy. . . .” He tried again, in an attempt to regain the upper hand, some kind of control.
The other boy looked mildly embarrassed, and kept his gaze on the floor when he muttered “He actually overhead me talking to Ginny. She was joking that since I have reach maturity enough to admit my first crush was a guy, it wasn’t fair that, now that we called it off between us, I had double the options. Terry sort of jumped in and asked me out”
For reference, especially hair wise, I imagine him a bit like Nikolai, Prince of Denmark, in this particular picture that I am linking, for science purposes, of course (even age wise it works).
Anyway, enjoy and if you want to tell me what you think about it, it would make me super happy as it’s almost my birthday. Fun fact, I do actually share a birthday with one of our heros. I won’t tell which, but all i can say is Leo at heart (although Pottermore placed me in Slytherin and I want to think I am a Ravenclaw).
The two wizards and one witch were becoming legends and Draco could understand why Longbottom said it gave people hope. The Carrows had been steadily losing the already unstable bit of power they held over the student body, and they were getting sloppy and nervous. The siblings punishments, already on the other side of legal, were becoming more violent and public. Draco had been afraid it wouldn’t be long before they let go of all pretences and go for the kill.
Without checking if the other man was following, he started marching in what was hopefully the direction of the airport.
“The fuck you are! Take me back!” His hawthorn wand glowed, sending little sparks that caught on the other man’s jumper like cigarette burns.
Potter laughed humourlessly and Draco thought damn you, I don’t hate you anymore. I don’t want to do this. From his expression, the other wizard didn’t either. This wasn’t about them. It was bigger than petty school rivalries.
“Err. . . You need to pour the content of this bottle into the surface and then touch it. . . Ehm, I guess a finger should do”. They stood awkwardly next to each other until the other boy said “Well, if you are set. . . I —“
“You are impossible! It’s not my fault your family has a thing for stupid names!” Lupin’s eyes were slits and Draco smirked.
“Talking about my mother, I’ve received her letter”. Draco said, taking the envelope out of his robe pocket and casting a protective charm on it.
For the lack of better, he settled on flipping him off. Then, remembering his manners, he added his index in a double bird salute and averted his eyes, knowing he couldn’t stand to see the pity he would see in the other boy’s.
He quietly finished his breakfast and dabbed the lingering syrup from his lips with a tissue. He decided he would make a quick trip to the toilet to cast a “tempus” and freshen up before paying and get moving. The effect of the felix felicis would last him around 8 hours, but he was starting to doubt the potion believed he truly wanted to find Potter and was instead catering to his subconscious
The Gryffindor seemed slightly intrigued, but Draco thought he could see a small amount of uncertainty.
“Feeding the Thestrals, of course. Which, If I should listen to Miss Lovegood, is one of your favourite pastimes”.
“No point in hiding the truth, Severus. After all you were the one that gave me a year at best. And I am a fool in many ways, but not when it comes to my own mortality”.
“And what is that, exactly?” Draco believed his given supply of energy designated to deal with this shit was getting perilously low.
“Mhm, I understand.” He scratched his chin thoughtfully, cringing at the feeling of the days old stubble peppering his skin in patches. Ironically, he could never grow a proper beard. “And I think I can help”.
He called to his friend, who was sitting at the old desk they shared, head buried into his Arithmancy notes.
And, mostly, it had been of little use over the years, almost forgotten. A few hasty cleaning spells had done nothing against the stench of disuse and many surfaces were still covered in a thin layer of dust, both indicative signs of neglect.
The Gryffindor gave him a soft smile, scooting to the side to leave some space for Draco to sit. “You know. . . it’s okay” He said, in a earnest voice.
I am alive! So sorry, but this year has been crazy and I couldn’t find the time and the words. The story is all written in my mind, but unfortunately from there to actually being written is quite the difference. But, anyhow, your lovely comments prompted me to get my act together and hopefully this is okay.
He wanted to scoff, argue that Magic was indeed everything, if only to be contrary. Lupin cut him off, though, and stood up, heading for the kitchen.
“You still haven’t explained to me the obsession with the brat. With more capable wizards, myself included, you are putting an awful amount of faith in a below-average sixteen years old”.
She had smiled brightly and waved her hand in goodbye “Splinter will arrange the delivery of your trunk. Don’t forget to write, dear”.
Draco’s mouth was uncomfortably dry in the heat of the day; despite the soothing breeze coming from the open windows, he was still overdressed. He was about to ask for a glass of water, or to demand to know what the hell was Potter doing with all those boxes, when the other boy suddenly hummed in triumph, emerging from the cabinet, one of said boxes in his grasp.
Harry hadn’t chosen to lose his loving parent before having the opportunity to get to know them properly. He hadn’t chosen to be raised by people that despised the inner essence of his own being. He hadn’t chosen to be the child hero of a world quick to turn its back on him at the first, uncomfortable truth.
The first thing Draco noticed was that the room had been “cleaned”. He appraised with distaste the wrinkled bed sheets and the old-looking towels piled crookedly on the desk, before pulling his wand out of his magically enlarged jeans pocket. Reveling in using it again after a long day without, he set to “scourgify” every available surface.
He took notice of his proffered hand just as the other boy’s palm came in contact with his own, shaking firmly up and down twice.
“Remember, it might take big actions to win a war, but it’s the small ones that keep the spirits high”. She declared sagely, passing him a sugar quill. She was happily flipping trough the book on Magical Beasts he had bought her, her nose almost touching the pages. It was a rare edition on the lost and mythical species of the Northern Sea and Draco believed some were almost as absurd as Freshwater Plimplies. Needless to say, she looked completely engrossed over a picture of a something that looked like a cross between a toad and a musky rock. The table they shared with Longbottom, Thomas and the female counterpart of Weasley was scattered with the gainings of their earlier plunder at Honeydukes. Draco sucked on his quill and look at a spot a few tables away, sighing.
“Talk of the devil!” She reiterated and Draco stared uncomprehendingly, a growing suspicion he had gotten it all wrong. The boy lowered the crates on the counter, but even before seeing his face Draco had known those tight brown ringlets did not belong to the one he was looking for.
His mother placed a delicate hand at the base of his back, a barely there touch that spoke of love, of yearning for more.
“Oh Minerva, I would be careful if I were you. You see, the new regime is keen to purge the Wizarding World. Are you sure that all your little Gryffindors are worthy?”
“What?” Draco asked, flailing his arms around wildly “Because if it isn’t the biggest fucking dose of luck, I really can’t see how-“
“Good evening, Draco” Dumbledore’s voice was gentle, shooting. No, no, no Draco screamed in his head. Please, don’t be kind, I have to do this, make it easy, please.
Draco felt like mimicking the gesture “Listen, all I know is that Potter is somehow important for ending this war” he lied through his teeth “And I am tired. . . Filthy. Honestly, you don’t look any better”.
“It wouldn’t be the first time.” He said instead, going for cocky and falling a mile short. Bitterness tasted like burnt coffee.
Not enough to see much or to give a location, just small glimpse to assure himself that Harry was okay. There wasn’t any other way, nothing that could put him in closer contact with Harry without it being dangerous for the boy. He needed to cut all the ties and let Harry’s future decisions hide his tracks in between the billions of people and paths life threw his way. Hidden to all and to him, too.
“Ugh!!Honestly, Draco!” He yelled, leaving him gobsmacked and the few heads in the room turning towards them. Theo had the decency to look sorry, and when he continued it was softly “Are you really that self assured to think people haven’t got better to do that preoccupy their minds with what you deserve or not? Yes, I will concede there will be some that won’t be pleased, but your biggest enemy is yourself. Once you get out of whatever self-pity corner you are hiding in and stop making excuses you can actually live instead of exist!” He finished, sagging on the bench with an exaggerated huff.
“Well, I don’t really get why Blaise would redo the year. He had top marks last year and could just take the exams privately. . . Anyway, it’s easier for you two, you did nothing of significance, no one would have problems with you coming back” he huffed.
They caught up with Macmillan and a few other Hufflepuffs half way to the third floor. Theo had been impressed by Ernie’s inclination to recognise Draco’s merits regardless of his house. The Hufflepuff had said that being quick to judge, even people like Harry, in his youth made him learn to give others a chance. Coming from a traditional Pureblood family, even if one with different ideals from Theo’s, he had been interested in the other boy’s decision to sell his Manor, which was an important symbol for wizards and witches of their status. Theo had replied “What status?”, and that got them talking. So, three weeks into the school year, the two of them had struck some sort of friendship.
He stared at his legs, pale, long, raising above the water like floating branches of a dead tree. He could see the exact moment the first tear hit the surface, rippling it in symmetric circles. After that, it was all a blur.
“We are going to be living together.” He added, after a quick explanation. “Good thing the cat Weasel likes me better than the human one. He actually doesn’t seem too fond of Potty, funny enough. His words, not mine, before you express your doubts.”
“Err. . . Yeah, I think we should start, they can add ideas as they come. Uhm, any suggestion?” Longbottom sounded unsure but all the heads turned to him in rapt attention. “Professor Sprout will help us procuring the plants we need, and Flitwick has some great charms to make them bloom all year around he can teach us.” He continued with more confidence “I think we should collect ideas on what species we would like to see in the Gardens first, then we can work around design and placement”
I’ve noticed I am crap with titles, but that’s what the edit button is for once the light of creativity comes at me from above. Anyhow, I think i might be writing too fast and so im not sure about the quality of the work but i need to put the ideas down before my brain decide to never remember them again ever. Anyway, this story is not about looks but when i saw this picture https://photographymag.tn/people/portraits/portrait-photography-inspiration-not-my-fc-for-whit-but-kinda-close-and-they-dress-kinda-the-same-i-guess-lol/amp/.
“Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I’ve come of age now-“ the boy paused, his expressive green eyes going slightly out of focus as if trying to place an event he couldn’t quite recall.
Once satisfied he let himself fall on the mattress and reached blindly for the pink notebook that had been blessedly left on the bedside table. What Draco wanted the most in that moment was to get lost over the little figurine of his mother, to make sure that she was okay, but he swallowed convulsively against the need and opened the diary on the third blank page instead. He summoned a quill from his luggage, the only bit of wandless magic he had managed to master during sixth year, and started writing.
If he survived, tomorrow nothing would be the same. And, the cowardly part of Draco that was the last standing piece of his old self, was planning to survive with his teeth and nails, Salazar be damned.
It wasn’t until they had made their way downstairs and Potted had asked “Do you want to take one of the skateboards, or I am sure you could borrow Scott’s bike?”, that he remembered how utterly fucked he actually was.
Lupin released a breath, eyes still bulging in horror. “Be reasonable,” he pleaded, “I was there on the tower. Dumbledore must have known you were coming, he put me under a spell. I was. . . I couldn’t move. He was talking to ME. We were taking care of- we had a task. This is important, Draco”.
When he woke again they were descending towards San Francisco and he had missed both calls for food.
“Yeah, but you are a better friend now than you were a lover then. And it’s like when we were kids again, I missed it”.
You were just like that, he reminded himself. You, with your pride in your superior intellect, used to think just like that. Draco had never actually believed Granger’s blood to be the colour of mud, but the sight of it, staining the rich carpet the exact shade of red as his own, had been a powerful image in the confused reevaluation of his beliefs. She, with her red blood and her different parents, was a brighter witch than the  combination of both the pureblooded goons standing in front of him. Not even his younger self had been able to deny it.
He rolled the flavour around his mouth, thinking that if things went to shit he would never taste coffee again.
Potter was in the castle and Draco was looking for Greg and Vince. He had noticed the vicious gleam in their eyes during the silent exchange they shared while slipping away from the evacuating crowd, and he knew they were planning something.
When they reached the top of the staircase in silence, Draco’s breath was ragged. He wasn’t sure it was the steps or his fear of breaking down. He turned around, unable to go further.
Draco patted his pocket at the confirmation, feeling the hard contours of the bottle against his fingers. “Why?”
If he were to be completely honest, he wouldn’t probably have noticed hadn’t the diary already been resting across his bare stomach.
“Of course you do. Well, imagine how happy Potter will be when he finds out you sent the only animal that ever loved him to a Muggle Rescue Centre or whatever.” He drew a little smile next to his words,to convey just how Happy Potter would be.
He sank deeper into the velvety armchair at the far right corner of the Slytherin common room, away from the crowd of students most likely speculating about Potter. For some reason, this particular armchair had ended up in front of a window, which meant an unappealing view of the murky lake water. Draco watched as some bubbles raised from the bottom, popping mid way and releasing a green substance vaguely similar to bobotuber pus. He wrinkled his nose, focusing on the repetitive motion of the bubbles and willing his mind to clear and relax.
He lingered for a moment, watching Draco curiously, his head tilted in consideration. “I don’t know where you are going, but I hope you’ll find happiness once you get there.” And with that, he gave a final wave and disappeared into the crowd.
In this climate of animosity the Carrows still found some allies and Vincent and Greg were between the ones more eager to aid in inflicting punishments. After years living in his shadow, Draco found that his friends were happy to prove themselves good at something and showed a viciousness he didn’t think they had in them. They too had taken the Mark, just before the beginning of the school year, but while Draco was having second thoughts, they were clearly dedicated to the cause. When the Defence classes, that were now communal for all the seventh years, had turned into evident teaching of the Dark Arts, the two, Vincent especially, had embraced the opportunity to gain experience at the other students expenses. Draco believed that many of them were allowed into the class just to be used as experimental material.
“Mhmm” The other boy said noncommittally, a mirroring smile playing on his lips. “Anyway, we are going to have a small gathering in the Great Hall tonight. I think everyone will be there, you can tell the other Slytherins but I have a feeling they might know already. We have been given the ok to stay past curfew.” His grin was excited now.
I was hoping to write Harry in this one but it was going to be too long, so I’m getting this out of the way first.
Despite the pillow lines etched onto his face and the drowsiness from the early start, Harry had woken buzzing with energy. Breakfast had been filled with nonsensical blabbering and growing bucket lists of things that simply needed to be done.
“Oh, come off it, Malfoy.” Potter said, bringing him back to earth. “I am not trying to be your friend, I honestly don’t like you. You are an arrogant bastard at your best”
At Draco’s look of disbelief, he seemed to brace himself and sighed. “When I said I didn’t exactly have a conventional childhood, I meant it. I’ve actually spent years specifically not talking about this, but the last year has actually helped me come to terms with the fact that my experience wasn’t normal nor dismissable.”
Draco thought about the first time his mother had told him about death. He was four and playing by the pond in the garden, building a miniature castle with pebbles and dirt, while Narcissa read in the shade of the trees. The castle, like all castles that were worthy to be called so, needed pointy towers and flags, so Draco went to look for sticks in the nearby bushes. There, hidden by the foliage, was a swan. Draco knew that swans weren’t meant to be touched, his mother had said so many times. They might bite you, darling, she had chided gently. But it was so beautiful. And Draco touched it, and the swan didn’t bite. Its head fell to the side, in a weird angle, and Draco touched it again. And again. He poked it and the swan did not move. Then his mother came, and she hugged him and told him of things that sounded strange about falling asleep and moving on.
Harry laughed, eyes twinkling in amusement, looking a bit surprised at Draco’s joke but quite relaxed. When he stopped he suddenly turned serious and tilted his chin to better look in the Slytherin’s eyes “I didn’t know you were —“. He appeared unsure.
The two of them had just made it back from seeing Potter’s landlord. As the idiot had predicted, Miss Pérez was easily convinced. A woman in her early forties, she had a strong accent and a striking face.
So, our dear Potter is canonically good looking and tall. It says so on his wikipedia page, where JKR states that he had inherited his parents’ good looks (and they were both hotties, as we all know), and that after six years he was almost as tall as James, which was tall.
Knowing that he would later regret sleeping during the day, he swallowed the entire vial anyway, grimacing at the medicinal aftertaste of the lavender. He was asleep, face smushed against worn cotton, in an instant.
Granger stared at him with a mix of fascinated incredulity and disgust that kept him going. “He was really ashamed, you know with me being this evil overlord and everything his poor Gryffindork heart stood against. He is probably giving birth in a ditch.”
That night, Draco thought about the letter, about the comfort he had found in his own gardens during dark times. About how lovely it would be to have his final rest surrounded by the beauty of life.
The charm told him it was just a handful of minutes to seven and he had lost over an hour of his lucky day wandering around and eating. Time to go. On his way to the counter he tried fishing his wallet out of his too-tight jeans pocket, hopping a little like an idiot. He was so focused on his task that he missed the column in front of him and crashed into it with a huff.
It was so early that the room was drenched in darkness, a single sliver of first morning light barely filtering through the heavy drapes. Draco covered his face with his hands and let out a muffled scream.
Dumbledore reminded him of his job, pointing out being defenceless and prodded him to proceed, sounding unafraid. Was he actually so confident in his innocence?
Draco’s exhaustion fuelled his rage and he was suddenly shouting, tea scalding his trembling fingers “You need to take me back! I need to get back with them”.
An image of Lily arguing with Snape flashed in front of Draco’s eyes. The sun rays danced gold on Potter’s face, giving his dark hair auburn reflections “You look a lot like —“
It was only when he had reached the corridor to the main exit that he let himself slowly come to a halt.
Draco looked at her, and she was still a child too, they all were. She wasn’t ready. They knew this moment was going to come but none of them was prepared for it to happen.
To his left, his mother made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from the dark wizard and the snake.
“You’ll like him. Evan, I mean.” Scott affirmed with conviction, finally breaching the topic of Potter that Draco dreaded but at the same time was so curious about. “He is great, Allie wouldn't have left if she could help it. Allie - she is, or was, his roommate. They have been sharing almost from the moment he arrived in the States, and he might look a bit grumpy at the prospect of changing things, but you’ll get along.”
His chance had finally come, and the circumstances couldn’t be more different. The irony of using what he had once hoped would help him pleasing the Dark Lord to instead find the only boy actually able to destroy him, was almost poetic. What stayed the same was his once in a lifetime opportunity of a perfect day wasted on someone else’s fight.
From the tiny slit atop his window, his fingers danced loosely in the wind, until the cab caught speed and the air became too frigid.
Draco scoffed “It’s not like he’d approved.” In fact, his father downright detested when he talked like a garden gnome. After starting Hogwarts he had taken moderate pleasure at cursing under his breath whenever Lucius had chastised him about his grades, feeling a rush of euphoria at the small act of rebellion.
“Nah, he seems innocuous” But the other boy must have sensed his frustration because he hastily added “I know you are talking about what people might think and say about me, but I found out long time ago I never truly cared”.
“And if he doesn’t want to?” Snape sounded like he had been having this conversation a hundred times.
“But, my mother! She’ll go mad!” Even as he spoke he knew that Narcissa Malfoy’s pain was of no concern to the same Dark Lord that had sentenced her only son to an impossible task less than a year before.
“The train, you say?” The Headmaster demanded. There were no traces of crazy in his voice and Draco wanted to ask “how”, because it wasn’t fair to sound that composed on the edge of madness.
“No - No, it just reminded me of this absolute ginger tosser at school named Ron, that’s all. It’s a strange name for a cat.”
“Do you still think you don’t deserve him? Because I can’t see any other reason not to tell him. . . That little speech you pulled got everybody sold on the Draco Malfoy’s deserve his redemption arc idea; Yet you act like you don’t believe in it yourself.” He prodded, lightly squeezing Draco’s forearm. It was a new peculiar habit of Theo, to seek contact when he was speaking. Draco knew it meant things were comfortable between them, and silently enjoyed how far their friendship had gotten. He sighed, roaming the selection of french delicacies in front of him for something that caught his fancy. He loved his breakfast sweet and had strategically sat by the tray of buttery pastries. It was only seven in the morning and the Great Hall was still mostly empty. Theo not only was a nagging shit but also an early riser, and not a very considerate one. Blaise had mumbled something from under the duvet that didn’t sound much like a declaration of affection. Draco, on the contrary, knew that once he was awake there weren’t many chances he would be able to get back into slumber. After considering the benefits of a early breakfast, he had opted to follow Theo into the Great Hall. It was pleasantly calm, just a few other students sparsely occupying the tables, and Draco could enjoy his breakfast in peace. Or so he had thought.
He watched impassively as the fragile glass started its descent towards the laminated floor, to then snatch it at the last second with his left hand, just barely gripping it between his fingertips and his wand. His father might have bought his team a better chance at winning, but he did not buy his spot as Slytherin’s rightful seeker, Draco thought viciously.
“It won’t last” Blaise said, repeating Theo’s words “Boot was in our Potion group. He is way too boring for Potter”.
The youngest of the children, a toddler with hair almost as blond as his, dangled sleepily from her father’s shoulder, head bobbing up and down every time the man shifted to adjust the strap of his heavy looking duffle. A particularly brusque movement jolted her awake and Draco watched as she took in her surroundings, confusion replaced by curiosity when she met his eyes.
Draco was at loss for words, so she continued “It’s different, for the Muggleborns. They don’t have magic all around them when they go home, as a reminder of who they are. Just their wands.”
Suddenly the entire situation felt so surreal that Draco relaxed, tension leaving his limbs as he sagged against the sofa. When his body regained control he felt the uncomfortable pressure on his bladder and took the opportunity for a brief escape.
Draco startled, eyes jumping back to attention from where they had once again strayed towards the food. He flushed and she smiled knowingly.
He was just past the door threshold when he heard a muttered “Say what you want, but you and Padfoot are definitely related.”
That was it. The end. A terrible scream ripped the air, but the voice was different, male. Weasley and Potter, having somehow escaped Wormtail, barged into the room.
Ugh, so much for the mild, placating teacher persona. Lupin’s control was slipping and Draco wanted to give it a shove.
To his surprise, Scott snorted rather loudly “Evan is allergic to anything that could attract any form of recognition.”
But Harry didn’t have to die. If things went the right way, he didn’t even have to know there was a war going on at all.
Draco felt a surge of shame and wanted desperately to change the subject. “I didn’t picture you for a romantic, Potter. . . Love is the reason” he recited, with a grave voice “And do you think you have found a love like that? With Weasley?” As soon as he had said it he found he was oddly interested in the answer. He had seen the two of them joking with each other often during the two weeks in the castle.
Pansy had been one of his first friends and, like with Vincent and Theo, they had grown up together in very similar settings. Only, while Theo’s life had taken a different direction until their paths crossed again, starting a new kind of friendship that was genuinely out of mutual care rather than circumstances, Draco had never felt more distant from the girl sitting beside him.
Draco stared helplessly into the pale, blank eyes, before closing them and tucking the boy’s wand safely in the internal pocket of the robes, just above his heart.
The other boy seemed to agree, as he addressed him sarcastically “Not anymore. Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who’s lent you theirs?”
Draco went upstairs feeling slightly out of depth, not sure if he ought to be offended by the nonsensical remark.
In the days following Draco’s dreams were populated by a body spinning lazily midair, face morphing into the ones of his schoolmates. He never looked at them in the eyes but their mouths were always moving. From that prospective sad lips looked almost like they were smiling. Sometimes they would plea him, please Draco, please, other times they would wish Harry Potter a very happy birthday. In the background, a snake kept hissing, and in the coldness of the night the Manor had never felt emptier.
“Where in Merlin’s name did you even get a pensieve?” He asked, taking a big gulp of the water put in front of him and looking at the vial that now stood beside his empty plate. Apparently he couldn’t help his own damned curiosity either.
Harry nodded. His left hand slid to the chain around his neck, twirling the little pendant between his fingers absentmindedly. An owl, eyes two round pools of glass.
“I don’t know” he replied after a while, still facing the irregular stones on wall. He counted 43 on the second row from the ceiling.
In that single moment, lain across the rundown floor of the same train that had once taken Harry to the beginning of his new life, fate offered him one simple solution.
When you control, though, or modify the mind, it’s only the victim of the spell that will have to face the actions their body performed without their consent. Something done by them but not wanted. And yet, they couldn’t stop it from happening. Professor Achebe had told them that often those victims, although knowing they were indeed the injured parties, couldn’t help blaming themselves, especially if they were made to do something terrible. It was a different kind of torture, long lasting.
“Well, however low your opinion of me might have gotten in the last year, I haven’t actually killed the prat.”
The older wizard recognised the signs and hunched his shoulders, making himself smaller. He didn’t try to approach Draco and when he spoke his voice was incredibly sad “I gave him a second chance, I hope. At least, I like to think I have.”
“I know what these are!”, Draco snapped, irritated “I mean why should I give it to you? If I recall correctly, and pardon me but the events were so delightful that my brain might still be muddled, this little thing was given to me. Therefore, and again do say if I am mistaken, it is mine.” The last word was gritted out in challenge.
He couldn’t help the small flare of pride in his chest at the thought of the spells he had mastered during that wrecked year and hated himself for it.
He stayed there, looking at Harry’s retreating back and long after he was gone. People passed around him in a busy blur and, in the chaos, he was invisible. So, he took his time, a steady breath after the other.
The decision to change Harry’s birth year to 1978 had been a necessity, and it helped that the boy had grown a lot during summer. He could easily pass for a fresh-faced 18 year old.
“It’s a two way diary, if you wish. Anything you need to tell me just write it down, and I will be able to see it and write back without having to use owls or something else as ostentatious and slow”. Not Umbridge then. Probably.
He blanched, realising that he had just wished to die when, mere seconds before, his subconscious clearly knew how much he really wanted to survive this.
Draco came to his senses slowly, groggy with sleep and the disorienting feeling of waking up in an unknown place.  He shifted against rough fabric, coughing as a puff of dust filled his nostrils and made his eyes water. His mouth tasted stale and dry, and for a moment he wondered how much he had to drink the night before.
Only when he was sitting fully straight he spotted the other man. His pupils narrowed in shock even thought the deepest part of his subconscious argued that it wasn’t exactly unexpected. Professor Lupin was pacing the floor of what Draco realised must have been the lounge of a modest looking house. Remus Lupin, his brain provided helpfully.
Harry’s eyes were a little glossy when he raised his glass of orange juice in a mock toast. “To new chances, I suppose.”
“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?”
His heart was surely going to explode, he thought, while his mind unhelpfully pleaded: yes, please, help me, please. You can’t, but please find the way.
Potter nodded, handing him a smaller black object covered in buttons that Draco took with feigned nonchalance, when all he wanted was to turn it around and inspect it as he had done with the other one.
Potter head snapped up so quickly Draco was surprise it was still successfully attached to his neck.
“Would you be interested in renting a room for a couple of months? No obligations if you’d rather travel the country.” She queried, eyes back on him with the same contemplative twinkle.
Draco shifted uncomfortably “I really didn’t do much”. He still wasn’t sure how to speak to her. Not a person he would have ever imagined associating himself with, he was discovering more and more every day how much he actually appreciated Luna. There was no need for words, with Luna. No need for much, really. She projected an aura of acceptance that made him feel safe in his own skin. It was a refreshing break from the constant need to impress and come up on top that had always characterised most of his interactions. Yet, without judging, she had the ability of making people reevaluate their own opinions. Many thought her crazy but, after getting to know her, Draco had come to the conclusion that most were just unable to cope with seeing the world and themselves trough her eyes. So a praise from her was a little bit thrilling but also scary because it made him think about how he could have been better. Tried a little harder. The scariest thing of all, thought, was that he was sure she meant it and that pushed him to come to terms with the things he didn’t do, and find a sense of self worth in the little actions he did take. Because overcoming guilt was a terrible battle to face, and part of him wasn’t ready to see what was after. The rest of his life and, maybe, even happiness. After a childhood of having all he had demanded, Draco was entering adulthood questioning what he deserved.
“You broke into the Headmaster office?!? Wow!” Draco whistled, twirling the little bottle in between his fingers. “Just- wow! I’ve always thought you a lower class bore that had to scumble his way up Dumbledore’s skirt to secure even the minimal required desk job to match the personality, but the list of felonies just keeps on giving!”
Draco stared and the vacated space for a long moment, feeling a free-fall of emotions. He had been furious at Potter, for assuming, for feeling so self important to believe Draco wanted to hear what he had to say, but Potter had said he was scared too. Potter, the boy that didn’t need to work for attention, the boy that jumped into near-death situations like his brain couldn’t really grip the concept of danger, the boy that to Draco’s chagrin survived circumstances that older and better wizards wouldn’t, was scared. Somehow, that validated Draco’s fear too, and for the first time from the beginning of his task he felt less alone.
Dumbledore ignored the jab but his next words held so much pain that Draco froze “You have heard the prophecy, Severus. You must know, Harry is our only hope to end this war.”
“Your dislike for James and his friends is clouding your judgment.” Draco shifted in discomfort at the reproach but Snape seemed unfazed.
The inner part, enclosed in the symbolic embrace of mothers’ Love, would remain bare until the garden were finished. Weasley had said that the relatives of the victims needed a way to be involved as well, receiving a look from Granger similar to the one she gave him outside the Room of Hidden Things and bringing Draco to believe they were going to make out.
The pond was going to be the central piece of the Gardens, around which the flower beds would develop following a circular pattern.
He had always craved to be seen but this year needed to be different. With the magnitude of the task he had been assigned, he knew it wouldn’t serve him well to attract attention. Nonetheless, the idea of Potter silently knowing he had been overpowered, melted some of the stress away, allowing a slow smirk to stretch his lips. He might even get to enjoy the Welcoming Feast, after all.
“Point taken.” Scott allowed, before grinning lasciviously at his friend, “That didn’t stop you from blushing like a demure virgin when you were made employer of the month.”
“Well, your strange fascination with redheads, that you should be scared about” Draco said, curling is lip in mock disgust.
The what? Draco wanted to ask, his gaze following the other boy’s finger to where it pointed to the cabinet. The cabinet stared back, offering no help whatsoever.
He watched closely, not sure if hoping or dreading for a trace of uncertainty, something that could excuse his sudden need to keep Harry close and damned the consequences.
“I’m tired, even if I know that’s not what you were asking.” Lupin said “That’s actually the only reason I am not with the Order right this minute. Things are not good, Draco. Probably soon, we will see just how bad.”
As winter approached, the temperature in the Slytherin Common room dropped considerably, but Draco didn’t mind. This year was different. It wasn’t uncomfortable, didn’t seep in his bones and his heart like the frosty embrace of loneliness, when your life is on the line and you are suspended between your past and a future that might never come, with nobody there to share the heat.
The boys exchanged a quick handshake. Scott’s grasp was strong and he offered a genuine “Nice to meet ya.”, to which Draco responded with what he hoped was a friendly nod. If only his father could seem him now, shaking hands with Muggles like he was one of them. Shockingly, as Lupin’a voice quipped in his head, they didn’t look any different after all.
The green eyes widen slightly and in that quick second Draco thought the other wizard gave him an impercettibile nod. He barely had the time to register the absence of his wand that his mother was pulling him away, out of harm way, and Potter was gone.
“Don’t come and play mates with me, Potter” he spat, voice dripping with venom and wand arm straightening slightly.
He wanted to dismiss what Potter had said as a fabrication of Lupin’s new identity. He remembered, though, how the Professor had told him that nothing Potter knew was exactly a lie, but more like what his life would have been if he had never received his letter to Hogwarts.
His stomach was empty, not even the faint taste of the coffee he had for breakfast left but bile and acid. He rested his head against the cool ceramic, feeling disgusting but finding he didn’t have it in himself to care.
The water was scalding and Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had a bath. It was probably in the Prefect bathroom and nothing like this. This lonely, this fucking complicated.
After a quick Sonorus Slughorn booming voice resonated trough the dormitories and bleary eyed students started to appear in the Common Room, until the place was filled with squirming young people, insisting for answers. The Professor tried to maintain a certain order and explained them that the castle was under attack and they were required to follow him to the Great Hall where further actions to assure their safety would take place.
He could recognise the plea in the boy’s eyes, the growing confusion about why he hadn’t been released from the spell yet. Despite that, he couldn’t help stalling, lost in a sea of familiar memories. He took his time cataloguing each feature, each nod to the past.
“Okay, then. This is your room.” He gestured at the door in front of them, open enough that Draco could spot a gray wallpaper with a bird motif cutting it across the middle, like little white soldiers, silhouetted orderly on the battle line. Ready to fly any minute, now.
Part of him wanted to snap at the parents to keep their terrors in check, almost digging the confrontation as a potential distraction from his overworked mind. His lips curled but, before he could voice his complaints, he met the apologetic, almost pleading eyes of the mother. She looked exhausted but there was a glint of a challenge in her gaze. She would stand up for her children, if it came to that. Draco felt the pang of irritation fade, replaced by the sharper tug of homesickness. He gave her a curt nod and diverted his eyes to the floor.
“I said okay. They are not my memories to keep. . . And I guess they do in some way concern you, as well. It’s just that nobody has asked me that before. You took me by surprise.”
Never mind. People talked and, without any evidence, Draco knew Potter would keep the ordeal between the two of them. For all his flaws, the Gryffindor wasn’t one to wash his dirty laundry in public and Draco begrudgingly admired him for it.
It should have made it easy, that thought. Easy to take each step to the Astronomy Tower like it was the honour he had so foolishly believed it to be when there was another Draco living in his much healthier skin. But new Draco didn’t lie to himself, and this was anything but. Because, no matter the outcome, tonight was the end. The inevitable finish line.
He looked around and counted his blessings. Theo was standing close to the platform, a little child dangling from his hips. His friend, who had come to see Jack and Wendy off to Hogwarts, was soon to be married to Tam. He had met the younger Hufflepuff artist again at Saint Mungo’s, where Tam sometimes helped with the art therapy sessions. Together they adopter Sam. Sam was a bright little boy who’s biological mother was a single parent that had struggled with depression. She had been one of Theo’s patients and when Sam was nearly three he had lost her to a potion overdose. Surprisingly, it was Harry that had help Theo overcome the grief. Harry was no stranger to struggling with his own guilt and had learnt that not everybody could be saved. They had come to care a lot for each other, over the years. Even without counting their similar appearance, Harry filled in where Theo’s brother was missing. Working often closely together, Draco knew they understood one other, sometimes even better than he and Harry did. But that was ok. He too, on occasions, felt the same way with Granger.
Scott blinked a couple of times before his eyes cleared in understanding. “Oh, right. Yeah, sounds cool. Lemme give my uncle a quick call to say I’m done with deliveries and will get back a bit late and then I could drop you off at the apartment, if that works for you? So you get to meet Evan and see if you guys are on the same page.”
Draco barely had the time to register the words that the crowd started to push their way inside, dragging him along. He craned his neck to look at the spot where Potter’s body was a few moments before, and it was empty.
When Scott came back to his side and asked with a smile “Ready?”, Draco wasn’t sure he was ready at all.
The envious admiration of the other students in his regards had, also, a huge appeal to his vain side and his father was seldom impressed with the stories as his school mates were.
“I knocked him up. Turned out he had all the right bits going on down there. With a dainty jaw like that I should have suspected he was hiding a pair of tits. So much for the boy who lived!”
Draco dreamt of Quidditch of all things. At first it was freeing, the bite of wind on his cheeks and his feet dangling miles above the ground, like he was on top of the world. Like he wasn’t suffocating in responsibilities and dirt. Even in his subconscious he sensed it, the rush of adrenaline and the thrill of the chase, and leave it to him to feel the most alive while he was dreaming.
who does what..." Harry blushed. "But I really can't see him not being understanding or making sure you feel comfortable. He might be the most selfish prick I know but you seem to be his exception."
Harry snorted and Draco blushed, fiercely, mouth opening and closing as if he didn't know where to even begin.
He nodded. He got it. And Potter was right because he couldn't back out of this wedding, not now... His eyes were burning as the possibilities that he never knew were possibilities slipped through his fingers like grains of sand. The fates were cruel and surely he deserved this. He turned away so his hurt wouldn't show.
"Had us worried sick -- disappearing in the night without a word!" Hermione admonished. "And I know you haven't wanted to eat in the Great Hall but when you didn't even show up to snag breakfast from the kitchens we didn't know what to make of it!" she rambled.
"Malfoy, you're fast, brilliant and ridiculously clever." He pulled out his wand and made quick work of healing his skin.
" Draco furrowed his brow. "No, no, no. He likes girls -- that's all you! The only advice I have to offer is that girl parts are the weirdest things."
Draco could not believe that this was happening. It felt like a surreal, out-of-body experience only heightened by the fact that he was invisible. He was just almost at the point of convincing himself that this was some weird, fucked up, twisted dream when Rowle started in on Harry with a punishing rhythm which, unlubricated, had resulted in a trickle of thick, red blood to roll down Potter's thigh. He had the sudden urge to reach out and place a calming hand on Potter's back to let him know that he wasn't alone and it would be ok. No, he couldn't dream this. He'd dreamed of Potter before but those dreams were pleasant, if not, disconcerting -- no, his mind could never make something like this up because he wouldn't wish this on his worst enemy, even if that
"Well, believe it. There's not a sexual tension out there that the man can't accidentally detect!" George beamed.
"Who isn't these days?" he joked. He walked a little to the side and sat down on a step, patting the seat next to him. "What happened?"
Draco raised a finger mid-chew and closed his eyes as he savored his bite of perfectly golden, battered cod. Harry rolled his eyes and waited, impatiently. He didn't know what he'd been expecting, had he ever let himself dream about reuniting, but it was a weird sort of relief to see that Draco was the same ol' prat that he'd always been. Perhaps a bit bolder and certainly freer, but still the annoying, demanding man that he'd known. And they fell so easily back into their old banter that Harry could almost forget that the void of the past five and a half years had existed.
Draco took mercy on him and resumed the sweet, wonderful, slow and pleasurable torture of his tongue. He sucked again at the soft spot under his ear and Harry threw his head back in pleasure.
to the heart, but neither of them knew for sure what to expect. What he did know was that, right now, he had this beautiful man right here with him and, for whatever reason, they both loved each other much too deeply than was wise and despite everything that said that this shouldn't be possible.
The irony, he thought, that he would be left waiting and desperate for information in the very same interrogation room that he'd questioned countless suspects in, himself.
"And why be on a side where people..." He swallowed hard, unable to finish the sentence. He couldn't acknowledge what they'd done to him. Not yet.
Draco's heart clutched now as he remembered the awe and warmth that carried the barely whispered name to his ears.
Harry came closer so that they were standing with only about a foot between them. "You're brilliant," he breathed.
She was just kicking herself for leaving her wand on the coffee table when the thing turned towards her and exploded with a loud
update, ever since. Thankfully, she hadn't heard a peep from Sebastian since he'd finished chewing her out for yesterday's
He rolled his eyes. "Yes, so I could explore life not being a messed up, needy, dependent bastard before we decide to settle down and..." Hermione and Ron exchanged matching looks of incredulity. "What? Wait, does
Jansen looked just as smug as always as he strode into the cell. Harry frowned. Jansen was an overconfident, careless prick with the half-cocked instincts of a blast ended skrewt! But maybe... maybe that could be a good thing...
Draco's lips made their way, hungrily, to his and the moans coming from his mouth as he sped up made Harry's rock hard cock impossibly harder.
"Stupid, stubborn, prideful gits," Ron mumbled, finally breaking the silence as he took out his wand and transfigured some holly into a poor excuse of a mistletoe and floated it inbetween his best mate and his former enemy. "Are you two going to get over yourselves and snog or what?"
in general, were a slippery slope neither of them dared traverse but, they settled nicely into the topics that were within their "comfort zone." Quidditch was always a safe bet and he enjoyed hearing all of her inside scoops on the behind the scenes drama. Ginny hadn't really been involved much with the Hedwig Foundation because of her training schedule but she looked both proud and amused as he regaled her with the goings ons of his kids and the mystery of how Peter Piper the Pygmy Puff wound up tangled up in little Oliver's mother's wig. And, of course, family was an endless well to drink from when it came to finding things to gossip about.
He scooped Draco up in his arms and carried him out of the bathroom, through the club, and disapparated as soon as they reached the nearest deserted alley.
" He nodded towards the two boys in questions who now looked like they might soon come to blows. "--ever since!"
, I took a guess at where she might've gone Sunday night..." he said, watching Harry's reaction carefully.
