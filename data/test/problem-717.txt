“I know, I’ll change it next time”
“If it hurts…”
to Harry, and I’m talking about the unlimited cocktails”
Draco took off his blindfold the same time as Harry and he was completely dazed by the sight in front of him.
Pansy gasped for the tenth time “Hermione, I think I might faint”
was going to stop you” Pansy finally spoke and folded her arms together with a party hat on her head “But I wanted to see how long it will take for you guys to realise that we’re here. Honestly, in my humble opinion, I wanted to see more, I even expected you guys to go straight up to the bedroom without noticing us”
“W-will you ever going to confess to them?”
“We…” Draco blushed, giggling a bit before turning his head around and spoke “We did it the first time on the balcony of that rooftop too”
“What?” Draco pushed Potter’s hands down and wiped the git’s eyes with his hands “Can you see now?” He watched as Potter slowly open his eyes and there it was, the pair of emerald green eyes Draco used to be crazy about
kill my boyfriend with a taser” Draco chuckled and hooked his arm around Harry’s “You could die with this”
Pansy grabbed his shirt and pinched his waist, making Draco hissed out loud “Are you selling me out?”
“No, I can’t,
, what are you…” He held himself up by his elbows and watched as Potter moved lower
” Draco gaped, stepping forward and looked at the sight of the city from the balcony, the moon shining above them, the starry night, Harry knew how much Draco loved seeing the city at night “Why are we here?”
“I’m sorry, I can’t” Potter said and before Draco could turn around, he was already fleeing out of the pool area, Draco rolled over and sat back up with a dumbfounded look on his face
“Well, have a good night”
“Are you perhaps turned on by this? Me bossing you around?”
“N-no, you didn’t do anything” Potter said, chugging on his wine “It’s my fault”
“Truth or Dare!”
“Why is she so dramatic? I thought she’d support me on this” Draco whispered to him, his hair barely touched Harry’s cheek, making him shudder slightly
Ron asked, Romilda Vane was lying on the floor, hands grabbing and legs kicking at something invisible, she kept shaking her head since Ron couldn’t guess what it was “Excercising?”
For Potter, according to Pansy, he has been a wonderful boyfriend, that must have explained the conversation he heard when he was unconscious, maybe it was Potter worrying about him, or more like the
…” He started hiccuping again while crying, he couldn’t stop if he wanted to
“You know that?”
“Your…” Draco muttered quietly, his hand poking at the bulge on Harry’s tented boxer, his cheeks blushing “You know”
“Is this an invitation?” Ron stopped in front of the table and looked at him, his lips pressed against each other. There was a Muggle chess board on the table, Draco actually had no idea who put it there, and he only sat down because everyone already hogged up all the available chairs, but Draco could not let a chance like this go
“Early” Hermione answered “We’ll go hiking, then kayaking, then swimming under the waterfall, then after all of that, couple massages, and then…”
stupid thing he did today
Harry laughed breathlessly and leaned back, grabbing Draco’s hip and pounding in fast, his fingers on Draco could bruise him tomorrow, the blond gripped on the carpet of the stairs, pulling it and moaning loud, he couldn’t control what he was saying anymore
Draco made his last move, flicking the final chess piece from Ron’s side down on the ground, claiming his victory “
“I’m not
! The girls must be having too much sex and just went
“Malfoy, you look
“So, speeding dating, Pansy has a brilliant mind, right?” Harry spoke first after a while, and Draco finally looked up at him. His heart skipped a beat when he realised how close they were. Harry still looked the same, maybe a bit thinner, he wondered if Harry was still eating enough. And the robes he was wearing was actually a gift Draco gave him on Christmas two years ago. Draco stared at him, his heart ached, his body yearning to touch Harry, he couldn’t bring himself to say anything
“Why were you two near a fountain?” Theo asked
“What’s wrong with your hand? Did you hurt yourself ag-…”
Both Harry and Draco laughed as they opened the door as Hermione scolded Pansy for saying inappropriate stuff to their kid.
“I’ve got all night” He mumbled and grabbed Draco’s legs while standing up, making the blond clutch onto him tightly and let out a small squealing sound as he walked away
“It’s alright” Draco spoke, biting his lips nervously, his hands were on his thighs but Harry knew the blond was fidgeting with the tablecloth, he always did it when he was nervous “Actually, I, I have to apologise too. I acted too hasty, I…Brandon was a tosser, he, er, you were right, he was only using me. I can’t believe I’d trust him over you, we’ve known each other for so long and I’d trust a guy I only know for a few months”
Move over, you always sit on Harry’s lap, why the sudden change? Are you mad at him or something?” Weasley laughed loudly and leaned back on the couch as Draco fidgeted with his robes. How could he possibly sit on Potter’s lap?
“Can you do it?” Blaise spoke
“I’m going to go” Ron stood up and walked out of their booth, he just couldn’t take it anymore, he’d move out, he could crash at Harry’s place, and find a new place tomorrow. Ron marched into the restroom and turned on the tap, he bent down, washing his face, he needed to sober up, even when he wasn’t drunk
“Hey” He spoke first, making Draco look at him and
” Ginny said, staggering to Luna’s spot “
“You know?” Harry stuttered, still in dismay after his secret was found out, Draco could only chuckle at him.
“Don’t worry, he’s like that, but we, as in his friends, know that he appreciates us” Draco said, staring at the board “He doesn’t always care about anyone, and if he does, it means he likes you. Like the way he prepared an extra quill for you”
“Why are you uncle Draco’s boyfriend?” Harry turned his head and widened his eyes when Rose spoke, she was upset, he could tell
“What? An item?
“No, but do you hate me a little less now?” He asked, she was holding her face firm, cold like ice, but a happy smile was forming on the corner of her lips, she was actually trying to hold it in
“If you’re worried about my hands, you should give me your gloves instead” He let out a dry laugh, a joke was always a good way to diffuse an awkward situation, but when he noticed the gleam in Potter’s eyes, maybe a joke wasn’t the best idea “That’s a joke” Draco really hoped he wouldn’t show up next time with a new pair of gloves in a box.
Pansy, why are you getting all crazy about this? It’s just a date!” Draco tried to reason with her, but the date wasn’t the main point, Pansy was just furious with Harry because he won’t admit his feelings for Draco, that was what her rage was about “Calm down, Pansy”
Luna stood up and waved at him “Do you want to join?”
“I don’t know” He rubbed his own hands unconsciously, something was bothering him “Is it my business?”
“Why’d she wear robes to a party? Honestly” Pansy spoke from behind him, Draco chuckled at her and elbowed her arm
“You are”
Pansy and Hermione murmured in unison. Hermione stood up first and extended a hand
“What?”
well,
?” Pansy widened her eyes and looked at Robards without blinking, Draco has to admit he was even shivering a bit right now, Pansy always got serious about Hermione, she would do anything,
“Potter, I think I l-…”
Potter grinned, his hands wrapped around Draco’s waist, their lower bodies flushed “
“Let me help you” Harry took the towel from Draco’s hand and swept the kitchen counter for him
“Please, just, er…” Harry looked at the clock and back at Draco, this was the perfect moment, the blond was already standing, he was sitting on his couch, just a bit more “Five minutes, that’s all”
“Is this about the handshake in our First Year?” Potter chuckled and nudged Draco by his elbow “You know I’m sorry about that”
“Some things are just not meant to be, Potter”
“Oh right” Harry said as they walked up the stairs “Maybe we could go, once our kids have their Yule Ball”
to be a surprise party to welcome you guys back from your honeymoon” Hermione said with a serious tone, Harry was surprised to see that she didn’t give them a lecture first “I tried to say something but Pansy stopped me. I mean I can’t say anything because we were the ones that were here secretly in the first place” Hermione explained carefully and stood up to pull out a cake from out of the box on the table “Anyway, you can either go up and finish what you two intended to do or celebrate this first. Look, Luna even baked a cake, so, please put something on and decide”
this officer was
is waiting!” Granger tugged on Weasley’s robes and pulled him away “We’ll go first, see you in the Common Room”
“What?”
“You were flying alone?” Draco asked, arching an eyebrow at him. It was rare to see Potter alone, he was always with some Gryffindors “Not with Granger or Weasley?”
“Harry, is that for Draco?” Pansy asked, her eyes staring through Harry’s eyes, her hands on her hips “You’re going to propose to him?”
because mum thought he should be independent and not live in the house anymore. Then the next day, he had woken up on Blaise’s bed, half naked, and apparently, he was too pissed the previous night and had begged Blaise to let Ron live with him. It had started like that, Ron began living his live in the same house with Blaise, but since he lived with the guy, he knew exactly what kind of person Blaise was, a
“No, absolutely not. I didn’t, I didn’t feel like he was the one for me to give my first time to” Draco mumbled quietly, biting his lower lip
It was exactly three months ago when Draco found his new curiosity for healing, it was surprising even for him. There was a food poisoning incident back then with the pumpkin pies, every student that ate it immediately needed treatment. Draco was the only few who didn’t eat it, since he hated pumpkins. When he carried a pale and weak Pansy into the hospital wing, it was full of other students already, and he ended up having to heal her himself before she got any worse. Turned out, what he did to Pansy caught Madam Pomfrey’s eyes and she had asked him to be her assistant in the hospital wing, helping her whenever she needed it.
of hers, and he really didn’t want to bring her down, even though he didn’t like it, she was his friend and he will be there for her
tell Draco he has been in love with him for years “If you’re leaving again, and I can’t see you. I want to say that, er, I, I think I have feelings for you”
!” Ginny squeaked and turned to her girlfriend “Luna?”
of funny anyway.
Draco sighed, admitting defeat when Ron won. They have been playing four or five matches until now, each time either of them would win. Draco was also surprised Ron could be that good at it “Fine, you win”
Is Harry flirting with Draco or is he just doing this to make him warm? We’ll see 👀
saw, I’m sure it won’t be out for a long time” Ron grabbed the potatoes chips from the table and started eating “Maybe never”
” Draco pulled his legs back and stood up
“We are
He exclaimed, but Pansy only looked at him even weirder than before. Was he going crazy? Was this a dream?
“Look who’s in a rush” Blaise smirked, and began to kiss Ron’s cheeks, he moved it lower to the corner of his mouth, and teasingly sucked on Ron’s bottom lip, and let go. Ron punched his chest and huffed loudly
“You’re a good kid, Draco” She said, draping her arm over his shoulder and leaned on him “You’ll do great in the future”
Speak of the devil, Harry flinched as soon as he heard Pansy squealed “You
“Your hat doesn’t fit my robes” He said as Harry grinned at him, not saying anything, completely focused on making Draco warm. Then he took Draco’s hands, making the Slytherin jumped, but didn’t recoil from the touch. He held both of Draco’s hands in his, cupping them together and leaning closer. Draco was still in a haze before he realised Potter was blowing puffs of warm air into his hands. It was hard to stay on his feet, Draco’s breath hitched at the way Potter intertwined their hands after, enveloped him in his warmth, it was as if he was trying to protect Draco from the cold “Are you warm now?”
“Well, no, I think, I’m not sure” Draco bit his lower lips and looked up at Harry, sighing out “Er, I…I have a boyfriend”
Draco ordered and the Auror settled back down on his seat, the blond took a deep breath and intertwined his hands together, resting them on the table while processing what the fuck just happened
“Shut up, I was not” Draco laughed, pushing Theo away, his eyes never left Harry
“Oh-…oh yeah, it hurts a lot too” Ron said. He did get a few hexes today, but none of it could make him forget the feeling of Blaise against him right now, he couldn’t think straight. But did he ever think straight? Ron continued “But it’s alright” He was about to say more but then a skinny young guy passed by their booth and looked at Blaise
“If you say so” He shrugged, knowing he was, since Theodore was an easy one to read “I thought you wanted to get back with your former lover”
“Kind of” Harry smiled from ear to ear and moved closer “I wasn’t really subtle about it”
“Did you lose something?” Draco looked to the left to see Luna standing next to him. It’s been an hour into Neville’s birthday party, but he was in no mood for it, so instead, he’s been standing in the corner, until Luna found him
“I let Smith fucked me yesterday”
“You’re injured” Pansy glared at him “Harry, carry him”
“I know” Harry said and started walking, Draco leaned his chin on Harry’s broad shoulder, looking at the starry night and empty street while getting a piggyback from his boyfriend. Now that he has Harry right with him, he didn’t have to worry for another second, he was safe, right here in Harry’s arms.
“If it makes you happy” The blonde girl smiled at Draco.
“Hey, can you help me with this, I’m not sure how to do this” Goldstein pointed at the Lady’s Mantle on the table, looking defeated. Draco felt like someone was looking at him, he turned around to see Pansy, but she was now busy helping her girlfriend. Draco shrugged and picked up a knife
. That was when it started, they sometimes do it for fun, not always, once every few months if they were in a mood, it was a guilty thing to do, Harry knew it, but he felt different when he did it with Draco, perhaps because they were good friends, or perhaps it was something else he’d never admit to Draco himself.
saved the Wizarding World,
“Yeah” Pansy nodded at her wife and held her hand “I know someone, well, you know, after the war, things got hard for us Slytherin, especially Death Eaters?”
“Well, it fits, right?” Draco smirked at him and got kept staring at his finger before walking up the stairs again. He probably has to prepare for his date. Harry sighed before settling down on the couch when suddenly the Floo flared and Ron walked through
watching it.
“You are” Draco chuckled, stepping forward to be closer to Harry “And?”
“You fucker” Ron smacked his bare chest when they broke the kiss off “We could have been caught”
” Hermione said, sipping her tea from her red mug “Maybe we can come over? Movie night?”
tell me you have a perfect reason to do this?”
“I love you” Draco murmured close to Harry’s ear, squeezing on their locked hands and kissing Harry’s cheek “
“Horrifying? Absolutely” Pansy nodded, her eyes glued on Draco’s. She’d have to make Ron agree to side with her lies tomorrow when Draco asked him about it, and she knew he would, her talent was manipulating people “So, just choose.
Ginny laughed loudly before grunting and pressed her hand on her stomach “
“That’s a horrible place to put the spare keys at” Harry chuckled behind him and Draco glared at the officer with a twinkle of joy in his eyes
“Like?”
“I know” Hermione replied “He told Ron and I, Ron said he should have just destroyed your wand anyway, while I…I’m not proud to say this, but I said he shouldn’t have given it back”
“I love you” Harry said, pulling his fingers out and Draco can heard his zipper being pulled down and the clacking sound of his belt hitting the ground. Harry kissed the spot behind Draco’s ear and the blond looked at the city in front of him, it felt just like their first time again. In his life, he regretted a lot of things, but until he met Harry, he never think back again,  he never regretted giving Harry his virginity, he never regretted burning all those things to meet Harry, everything was perfect with Harry.
Draco waved at Hermione “Pansy wants to talk to you about book organising!”
annoying?” Draco scoffed loudly and folded his arms together “I’m not the clumsy twat that broke his arm in the middle of the night”
“Well, it contains a very awkward confession” Draco chuckled, it seemed like Ernie has already fallen for Terrence just from his look and kindness “Ernie is really a shy one, do you know that?”
“I’ll go check on him” Ron said, rushing to the bedroom door and slammed on it three times “
“One room” Hermione replied and pressed her lips into a thin line before continuing “
He said he’ll see you two tomorrow” Ron walked back to the spot next to Pansy and nodded at them “Trust me, Theo is a brilliant Healer and he will bring the potions to Draco later”
” Hermione said in a displeased tone “Please behave!”
” He spoke softly into Harry’s ear “
“Oh, well, I’m free tomorrow night”
“I’m sure you heard it the clearest” Theo chimed in smoothly, giggling as he hooked his arm around her “You looked so head over heels for that girl”
!” Draco heard Ron’s voice and suddenly Harry was pushed in the room by the redhead “Hi” Ron smiled cheekily and when his eyes caught Blaise’s, his cheeks turned redder than his hair and Ron turned away, Draco smirked once again,
“I think she’s pretty brilliant” Harry chuckled “Er, so, do you mind if I…ask you to dinner then?”
“It’s okay, I will bring him up” He said and the girls left the Common Room, the reason Potter was so moody was probably because of him. He didn’t know his impact on Potter would be this big, Draco nudged him with his elbow but he didn’t move, the blond tried to stand up but he was quickly pulled back
ideas?” Seamus clapped his hand together and Luna was standing up again
Pansy chuckled loudly, their plan B was quite insane, she was hoping they wouldn’t have to use it “Let’s hope this works”
” He barged in her office and slammed his hands on the table, startling the witch “Do you know about Potter’s party tomorrow night?”
to you
how hard could it be?
He said, disappearing into the green flames, he didn’t even have the chance to propose now. Harry sighed, flopping himself on the couch. Draco might not know about this, but today was the day Harry realised Draco was the one for him. It was a just one fine morning that day when he woke up with Draco next to him, sleeping soundly and breathing softly, his blond hair spread out on the pillow and his arm draped across Harry’s chest, it was
Luna said loudly through the girls’s screams “
He whispered, letting out small moans every time he rolled his hips and Harry’s cock touched his prostate. Draco leaned back, lifting himself up by his arms on the sand, he was tired already since they’ve been fooling around for a while before this “
“Live a little, Harry” He said, opening Harry’s jeans again, he pulled out the still hard cock and quickly swallowed it whole
thought…” Theo spoke, tilting his head with a smile ”We could make it happen…since you never got the chance to, she’s really good at persuading people”
“Nothing happened, Pansy, I can tell you that” Draco glanced at Potter and looked back at Pansy “He still doesn’t remember what happened that night”
, er, in
Pansy made her way to the bench they were sitting on and gave Draco the small eye drop bottle from her hand “I also got a wet cloth soaked in saltwater, if he needs it”
“I guess, yeah, at the right moment” Potter said “Lately I found out that I am not so brave when it comes to my romantic feelings, I don’t really know how to act, or what to say, my brain gets fuzzy when I talk to them”
, but my mummies said you aren’t, and I was sad, but then mommy gave me ice cream without telling mum, and then I’m happy again” Harry chuckled softly at her story, he also wished he could get ice cream and stopped sulking over Draco “Auntie Ginny says if you and uncle Draco get married, I get to be a—a flower girl”
“Would you soap my back?” He swayed around, looking at the wall with a smirk, he could not let Harry come that easily
Ginny jumped excitedly as she pushed Neville out so he could lead the way “
“Draco, before you rushed down here trying to sneak him in, Harry stood outside of our gates for ten minutes knocking on every window to see which one you’re in” Draco was speechless at her words, glancing at Harry, who gave him a guilty smile. The Manor was huge, he couldn’t blame Harry that “And you two spent five minutes out there before coming in”
a motorcycle, and
“Yeah, totally, like what the fuck, Harry, how could he do that?” Pansy frowned and huffed out a breath “Weird”
“Nothing” Draco said, he was too tired for any of this
“What’s that? I couldn’t hear you” Potter tilted his head to the side, he smiled knowingly at Draco,
“It’s not” Pansy gestured with her hand and urged them to come up “Quick, come up here and pick”
“No, it’s fine, honey” Pansy tapped her hand on Hermione’s legs as a way of assuring her wife and shook her head “I have to do this myself”
solution…or you know, you can stay there pining over him until you both grow old and you’ll die regretting not telling Draco how you felt”
did he have feelings for Draco?
“Wait” Harry spoke after swallowing his first strawberry bruschetta “You said you
look good in your robes today, not that you don’t look good on other days, but you know, today…you were
Harry mumbled, pulling Draco away as the blond stuck his tongue out, licking at the head one last time. Harry smiled, pulling Draco up on his feet and kissed him, Harry pushed Draco against the table, carrying him up in his arms and placing him on the table. Draco pulled him down with his hand on Harry’s chin, licking a trail up his jawline
!” Draco groaned mentally when he heard their answering machine. He couldn’t reach either of them on their mobile phones so he called their home phone, they were on their usual Friday date night, of course, so they wouldn’t answer their phone until the next morning. He had sent her a text saying ‘
“What do you think?”
“Bye” Potter gave them a bright smile before disappearing when his Portkey activated
“If it’s that serious—…”
“Maybe one more?” Harry grinned, his fingers teasing Draco’s rim and the blond looked up, he could probably go for another round “They haven’t got here yet”
“Can you sit down on this chair?” Ron tapped on the back of the wooden chair and practically pushed Harry down on it “Get comfortable.
You were going to propose
“I was telling you about the story I went travelling around the world” He said with a bright smile, Draco gave him a polite nod and felt guilty for thinking of Harry while he was on a date with another guy “Oh, time’s up” The bell rang and the guy, whose name Draco couldn’t remember, stood up to get to the other table. The blond was now greeted by a new guy, with dirty blond hair and a green robes
“How would I know?”
“Where’s Blaise?”
“Thanks” Draco said, heaving a sigh when Ron sat down on the chair “He has been hitting on me for weeks now, seems like he couldn’t get over me”
“What?”
you, Draco” Theo winked on his way to the lift “I want to meet Neville and
“Are we still on for that party this weekend? The Slytherins is hosting”
“Don’t blame
“Are you alright? Should I pull it out?”
“Top notch” Ginny raised her fifth Firewhisky glass in the air and spoke in a raspy voice “Absolutely divine”
possible,
“Potter’s interested in someone else?”
“It’s just, er, I’m overwhelmed, yeah pretty much” Harry smiled at him, moving his arms around Draco’s waist and ribcage “You’re
Their lips fitted perfectly with, and Harry felt like everything around him just disappeared, there were just Draco and him together, their bodies colliding. Their hands on each other’s skins, touching everywhere possible, like they were a couple of long lost lovers that has been reunited after decades. Every brush wasn’t just simply touching, it was to treasure and to savour the feeling of finally being able to do this together, to finally be together in love.
“Smith, for the tenth time, stop talking” Draco said, Smith kept asking about him, and won’t stop winking at Draco, which made him super uncomfortable, considering Smith was so not his type, he might have had a one night stand with him, but it was out of desperation, he wasn’t that sad anymore “I can’t do this if you don’t shut your mouth”
“Hey, did you enjoy the game?” Draco asked, elbowing Theodore, who was sulking in the corner of the room
They both jolted when they heard a familiar voice outside the room. They looked at each other with a sly smile before running to the door and opened it.
us?” Luna asked, chuckling softly “Alright, we can do that”
“No! No” He looked at them and sighed “I just, I just need to be alone right now, or maybe get a good shag, I’ll decide on the way home”
” Pansy yelled from the kitchen as the doorbell rang
“Oh” Harry said quietly as the truth struck him, Draco cocked his head to the side, eyeing Harry carefully. It couldn’t be that he was…jealous?
“It’s just a spot” Ron argued
early” Pansy said, nudging Hermione as they both smiled at them “We had to stall Lily here a bit”
“See? Just go ask him” Hermione said as Draco closed his book softly, he could run right now. He put his quill quietly in his bag and grabbed it to stand up
“Let me prove it to you” Harry mumbled, kissing Draco’s temple as they stood there under the water quietly, the blond felt something in his stomach, something in his mind saying...he trusted Harry, and he decided to listen to it.
“I have something to tell you, three things to be exact”
“You said you love uncle Draco” Rose stepped up and spoke, her hair was put up in a cute bun “I made everyone help”
“No” Ron said, glaring at Draco “But Hermione told me to be decent, and Zabini told me I couldn’t win against you”
” All of their friends joined, banging on the table and chanting the word, drinks were spilled all over the table, they were smiling at them, Draco turned around, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck and asked
“Deal” He said, and Harry held out a hand for him to shake
“My point is, if Harry in your world is also a helpless mess when it comes to someone he likes, then maybe they’re the same” Pansy said, and it reminded him about the time, there was a rumour that Potter had asked Cho Chang out for the Yule Ball, he was all shy and scared, according to other students, that he was turned down because she already agreed to go with Diggory. Draco huffed out a laugh, maybe they could be the same, just maybe “If you want to prove that these two worlds are not different, just try to make Hermione and I fall for each other”
“Ron” The redhead stood straight up and looked in the mirror, Blaise was standing at the door, looking at him with sorry eyes, it won’t work this time
“Draco!” The blond blinked twice when he realised Theodore was poking his arm “You’re zoning out”
“If we
inappropriate, guys” Ginny shook her head slowly but ended up grinning at them “I mean, it was sizzling
“Come on, let’s get your girlfriend” He said, leading the redhead to Luna “You should stop drinking, you might faint”
like you imagined, and I can confess to you, and kiss you…when I’m sober, and with your permission this time”
Pansy tapped a knife into her cocktail glass, catching everyone’s attention and grinning at them “
He avoided Harry tonight, for the obvious reason, but now the certain Gryffindor was nowhere to be seen. Pansy was talking to Millicent in the middle of the room, her eyes glancing at Hermione, who was at the other corner of the room, talking to Hannah Abbott. Theodore was starting a conversation with Neville, as he had planned the night before, while Blaise kept watching over Ron, who was chugging down a lot of beers.
” Draco covered his mouth when Harry thrusted up into him, he glared at the git before looking at Luna “So soon?”
“It’s a walk down memory lane” Harry grinned at him “The day I kissed you…it was supposed to be the best day of your life, but I ruined it by forgetting it. I’m a dumb arsehole, I know, so…with our friends’ permissions, I asked for their memories of that day, and I watched all of it, and asked them to corporate with me, and…recreate that day for you” Harry stepped back a bit and sighed “Everything I said that night, about me liking you, it’s all true, you know”
—what?” Harry choked on his own words.
“What about the mirror I saw? It says differently”
“Are you doing something for Hermione tonight?”
He heard Potter call him, his first name rolling off Potter’s tongue just easy like that, Draco’s stomach felt weird “
“We should play Kiss, Marry, Curse next” Hannah Abbott suggested while walking away with Neville. They seemed awfully close with each other, he should probably look into it.
“Why are there four glasses of wine on the counter?” Narcissa asked them and Ron realised he forgot to hide it. He rushed to the counter and grabbed a glass

? Now that’s a bit old fashioned, Mister Malfoy” Pansy laughed, Narcissa hasn’t spoken a word, instead she just looked around the place “I think when it’s time, he’ll get married”
“Harry
” Pansy and Hermione both called out her name in a high-pitched tone “You can’t say that”
“Harry” Pansy intervened worriedly and Hermione added “What are you doing?”
” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear and cried out when his husband started thrusting. At the beginning of their relationship, it took Draco months before he could get used to Harry’s size without wincing, now he felt like he was empty without Harry. The blond’s head fell forward and he rested his forehead on his hands, Harry sped up and the only sounds he could hear was the sound of skin slapping on skin and their breathing. The firefighter bent over and kissed the nape of Draco’s neck, his hand wandered down to stroke the blond again “
“Sorry again for that”
need to hear that” Potter added with a smile
” Pansy stomped to Robards’s spot and poked his chest with her newly manicured nails “I married this woman to
, right
“How bad I want to kiss you” He said, receiving a surprise look from the blond before Draco smirked and leaned down until their lips met.
Enjoy!
Pansy concluded from Hermione’s code and realised what she was trying to do
“I’m just…” Draco swallowed hard “I really hate eating seafood, all the peeling, cracking, I’d rather just eat more fish”
“Come closer” Draco hooked his finger, signalling Ron to leaned over, until his lips could hover breath over the redhead’s ear, the blond whispered the five words that made Ron shivered from head to toe “Blaise is fantastic in bed”
Draco laughed and looked at his own chest, the marks were a highlight now compared to the faded scars he had all those years ago. Draco jumped from the table down on his feet and quickly fell in Harry’s embrace, his body was still weak “
When she nodded her head and pointed at the air, Ron began guessing more out of panic “
!” Draco put his hand up “No, no, I’m Draco, yeah, Draco”
“That was scary” Ron whispered to Potter and snickered “I don’t think I’ve ever seen Robards that scared of anyone”
“Truly a lovely sight to see” Hermione added with a wink before dragging Pansy with her
!” Draco turned around to see his husband with a smile, he leaned closer and whispered in Draco’s ear “I have to show you something”
” Draco shushed her and added “That’s why you need to
Then I confessed that I like you during Quidditch last year, remember? We’ve been boyfriends since then”
it, Pansy was too predictable, this was probably be one of Pansy’s crazy ideas that Hermione agreed just because they’re married and Hermione tolerated her craziness
times or so in the past” Narcissa said, she noticed the atmosphere as soon as they got in the house, that was why she kept observing, there were even two pair of shoes on the floor behind the couch that Weasley forgot to pick up. She was glad Draco found someone, and with Potter, somehow she didn’t feel unsafe at all, on the contrary, she felt like he’d be the safest there. She trusted her son’s decision and if he was happy with Potter, she has to let him “And behave tomorrow”
Draco. If there was a moment in time Harry regretted the most, it would be years ago when he should have just confessed to Draco instead of chickened out. Draco’s eyes were opened, looking at Harry guiltily as he was still devoured by Brandon, they locked eyes and Harry knew what Draco was thinking. The blond was still confused about the whole proposal thing, but Harry knew his place, him and Brandon were still a couple, so he turned on his heel and Apparated away.
Pansy squealed loudly, putting a hand on her chest and heaving out a relief sigh, mean while Hermione next to her was wiping a drop of sweat on her forehead she didn’t know she had “You will
“Nothing, the mirror is broken” He said, feeling somewhat half relief and half disappointed when Harry didn’t see anything. Was the mirror really broken to him?
” Theo turned to look when Neville called, he had pushed Abbott away, but it didn’t mean anything, they still kissed, he probably didn’t want him to tell their friends. So Theo walked in the lift, ignoring the call
“What’s wrong?”
He murmured, and Pansy looked at him with a weird look, tilting her head to the side
“Don’t say that”
“Your wish is my command” Harry chuckled and sat back up with Draco clinging onto him like a koala bear, he stood up and grabbed Draco’s arse to balance them both before walking up the stairs, he smiled into the crook of Harry’s neck all the way up to his bedroom, he was unbelievably happy, and there was nothing that could ruin his mood right now, Pansy was right, he just need to live for the moment first, fuck everything else
“Hey, er” Ron muttered quietly “Do you, er, does Zabini…er, never mind” He shook it off and let Draco continued with powdering his face
“Hey, Malfoy” Potter’s face lightened up when he saw Draco, the blond pushed some of his hair behind his ear and swallowed hard, he waited until Potter was in front of him before he finally spoke
Harry added “Ron, I’m looking at you!”
She said with a grin, pointing at the dragon on her shoulder “This is your partner, Kitty, don’t worry, she’s nice”
“N-no, I will stay here” He shook his head and Potter shrugged, taking off his boots and leaving his short cargo trousers on
“What? But—but
“Are you bringing Draco with you?” Granger asked, and Draco realised he and Potter probably do this every year “Or is he staying with his parents?”
Professor in Hogwarts to
“Where’s yours?”
“Did you apologise to Luna?” She asked, narrowing her eyes at him, she didn’t believe him, she’d probably think he was scheming something “Are you scheming something?” Draco smiled in his head, pressing his lips into a thin line and nodded
Draco gasped, he knew that Theodore was a cuddly person, but he didn’t know he’d do it when he was drunk, but maybe he was also enjoying that truth “
” He exclaimed, and everyone looked at him, he softened up and cleared his throat, his eyes stopped at Pansy “Pansy, he’s ready, give him the animal”
“Yeah” Draco mumbled with a smile at the corner of his lips, his hands came up to rest on Potter’s firm bare chest “The feeling is mutual,
“Something” Draco repeated “Is it a person?”
” Draco yelled when a burst of flames shot up from the fire, he backed away and fell on his couch, setting the smoke detector in his apartment off, it started ringing loudly, making Draco panicked even more
“At least it’s not a pepper spray”
“Who are you to decide what makes me happy?”
“Well that’s why we’re setting them up” Hermione slipped her hands in Pansy’s hair and rested her chin on her head with a soft sigh. Hermione was invested in this just as much as Pansy so they were both frustrated with those two oblivious Aurors “Now that we’ve got them in the same place, it’s almost New Year, Harry hasn’t spoken any word to Draco, they’re clearly avoiding each other”
“…and five minutes into the car ride, we realised we forgot our kids at the mall” Pansy laughed and sipped on her champagne, leaning on Hermione for support “Hermione was yelling all the way back there,
“You did” He replied softly
Harry wasn’t wrong, right? He thought about what he did, and he didn’t know where he was wrong, maybe locking the jerk in the loo was a little extreme, but if not, how could he warn Draco? During the two weeks after the incident, he still met Draco and Brandon with their friends, but they didn’t talk. Harry didn’t want to look at them either, but only because all Draco did was snogging Brandon, Harry was annoyed, but he was in no place to say anything about it. Pansy said Draco did it on purpose to rile Harry up, partly because he locked Brandon in the loo, and also because Draco saw Haley wearing the ring Harry intended to propose Draco with and got angry. Since Draco always tell Pansy everything, Harry believed her words, or tried to. Because it all led to this moment right now, when Pansy told him Draco just had sex with Brandon.
Draco turned to look at the doorway and tilted his head to the side. Someone was outside. He placed the mug down on the counter and walked to the door, not forgetting to Accio his wand into his hand before opening it.
Draco turned away while Harry was leaning in when he heard a loud thump, like someone had fallen on the wooden floor, Luna’s shrill voice could be heard. The blond rushed to the spot where everyone was standing, forming a circle around Ginny, who has somehow fainted.
She mouthed without a sound so no one could hear, she looked slightly angry. What was the problem?
“Well, you didn’t mention whether the person is a girl or a guy, how could I know?” Ron protested and huffed loudly “You girls are mean”
Harry tried to get a better look but the tie was blocking his view.
” Draco exclaimed “Well…what now?”
“Ah, is it about Blaise?” Draco asked, and based on the flushed look on Ron’s face, he was right “What do you want to ask about?”
“See? You agreed as well” He chuckled and continued under her sceptical gaze “I just…I want to change, if anything, I want to be a better person. That’s why I want to apologise to everyone I’ve hurt, Luna, you, I’m sorry for acting like a total arse”
He groaned, looking up at the clear blue sky, squinting his eyes after he realised it was the middle of July.
“Yeah, I did”
“The Marauder’s Map? He inherited it from his dad, Sirius, Remus, and Peter, they made it themselves, it could track down everyone’s location in Hogwarts” She said as they kept walking, Draco hummed and realised maybe the map was the reason why Potter was able to follow him everywhere in Sixth Year “He has never used it on you though, I don’t expect him to, but I’m just saying, he has it”
“You could have just told me”
?” Draco purred into his ear, stroking Harry’s length softly, his eyes twinkling. This made his heart raced, he was excited
“And you had sex in Hogwarts? When?” Potter finally spoke, not to Draco anyway
Draco tilted his head to the side, avoiding Harry when the Auror leaned over for a kiss “I asked you to join me in the shower, not sex” He smirked but pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s cheek when he pouted “Now are you going to soap me up or should I do it myself?”
“Han, hey” Pansy called and Hannah walked to their spot, tying her hair brown hair up in a ponytail and leaned over the bar on her elbows “Tell me, do you think Draco likes Harry?”
“Calm down” Blaise added, exhaling another cloud of smoke from his mouth, he knew Blaise was rolling his eyes at his attitude right now, but he has
“I mean…normally I wouldn’t approve of this behaviour” Hermione said hesitantly, biting her lips, she was actually considering it “
“My bedroom” Harry spoke, heading up the stairs with Draco in his arms “We need to talk”
“I don’t”
“I think you will be okay” Potter said, finally meeting his eyes, this time, his green eyes and his warm hand have made Draco’s heart skip a beat. His smile sent a shiver down Draco’s spine, the nice kind. Draco swallowed hard, feeling an urge to squeeze his grip, but Potter was faster, tightening their locked hands. The blond’s breath hitched, and he looked away “Are you warm now?”
“So bad I could die” Harry said, squeezing Draco’s globes and making the blond moaned softly, his hands working on Harry’s belt and unzipped his jeans, rubbing on the Auror’s hardness from outside of his boxer “
“It’s fine, I think I had a bad hot dog today” Ginny shrugged it off and continued smiling at them “Not that bad, really”
“Harry isn’t over him either” Ron shrugged, chugging down his beer bottle and grabbed another from the table nearby “Maybe it’s a good thing. Did you call him on purpose?”
“I know” Draco’s lips formed into a smile, he pouted a bit when Harry pulled out, but gasped as soon as Harry pushed his fingers inside again “
“I’m not pompous”
“What are you up to?” She folded her arms across her chest, she didn’t trust him, not yet.
“Be happy for our son, Lucius, he has been cheerful and happy for a few years now” She placed her hand on Lucius’s shoulder and explained “If Potter is the reason, then maybe we should accept that fact”
He whined when Harry pushed his fingers inside him again after just pulling out
” Potter yawned and sat back up slowly “Is it over?”
“You could just use magic for it” Pansy leaned on the door in her black blazer dress and observed Draco panicking, she wore gold high heels to match the gold buttons on her dress, and a pendant necklace, her hair was so short it barely touched her shoulders, and she has her usual bold red lipstick on, the girl was ready to party
“Thank you, come on, Eddie” Luna received the boy from Ginny’s arm and brought him into the room nearby while the others set up the place
’ rolled out of his tongue, it was hard to even think of it. It’s been another week, all of his friends came by to cheer him up, none of it worked, he was too upset to do anything. All he did was work and sleep and eat and workout to stay in shape, he wasn’t
’ but he doubted she would see the text any time soon, and if she did, she won’t be able to call him now that his phone would run out of battery in a few minutes.
“Okay, I’m heading back, see you tomorrow” Draco opened the door and waited for an answer but the girls just started snogging “
Pansy chimed in brightly, her hand clutching on Harry’s bicep “It’s traditional to do it!”
“Until you realise you’re wrong and apologise, don’t speak to us” Draco said, grabbing Brandon’s hand and jacket “I’m disappointed in you, Harry. I can’t believe you’d damage our friendship like this” He said, pulling Brandon out of the restaurant. Harry groaned and buried his face in his hands, sitting down on the chair again, murmuring incoherently, he messed it all up.
“And she couldn’t heal it for you?” Draco scoffed and watched the way Potter pressed his lips together, unable to say anything, the blond sighed loudly “Potter, you can’t just go to the hospital wing for minor things like this. I’ve got people with serious injuries here, that one got a broken foot” Draco said, pointing at Ernie Macmillan, who broke his left foot when he tried to move a portrait in the hallway and it ended up falling on his toes “You can’t come in here just because of a scratch that you can heal yourself. You have been going here a lot, Potter, do you love the hospital wing that much?”
many things that make him cry, he couldn’t handle it “
“Hey”
Draco said as Hannah walked back to the bar, Pansy left, now it was just him and Potter again, which was awkward
—oh, Draco! You’re up!” Granger walked in the Common Room freely, which he has never seen before, giving Pansy a kiss on her cheek “I’m glad you’re up, Harry freaked out when he found you in the Room of Requirement, but you never want him to make a fuss about your health, so he asked me to check on you”
He has noticed that ten minutes ago, he was walking home from his work as usual when he realised there was a man following him, he could feel it, the hungry eyes on him, it was just a matter of time before the man attacked him. Pansy has scolded him many times,
He was tired of that already, it was all just empty words men said to him because they wanted to be inside him. Theo turned to his right when the door opened, and Neville walked out, he stopped and looked at Theo for a second before keep walking. Theo’s heart ached and he pressed himself harder against Roger, he pushed Roger’s head on his neck, letting the man making marks on him, he watched as Neville got in the lift, his eyes locked with the man he loves. Roger grind on him but he didn’t care, he stared at Neville watched the Auror pressed on the button, his eyes remained still on Theo. As soon as the door closed, Theo pushed Roger away and sighed
Draco closed his eyes, feeling someone holding him up in their arms, the voice was familiar, soft and low, he could barely open his eyes, he couldn’t see who the person was. Whoever it was, the guy was helping him, Draco fell back into a deep sleep after that
?” Draco stood up and walked back to the shore quickly, that did
” Unfortunately, his crush was the
“You are brilliant, you know that?” Harry grinned at him and looked to the right “Wanna try that?” Draco looked at the same direction, noticing a bowl of strawberries and melted chocolate next to them. It must have been a work of Pansy because there wasn’t strawberries and chocolate at that party. Draco grabbed a strawberry in his hand and placed it between his lips, Harry sighed out happily and moved closer, he took a bite of the strawberry, eating half of it and sucking on Draco’s lips at the same time. Harry held Draco’s hand up and sucked on the blond’s finger, making Draco shiver.
“Are you coming?” He asked, taking his shirt off to reveal his... Draco swallowed hard and diverted his eyes to look at the waterfall. Potter still trained hard at home, he could only assume by looking at his body. Who allowed him to look like that anyway?
come in”
“I should have known, you slept on the left side in our suite too” Harry snickered “Alright, roll over me” He said and Draco smiled at him before getting on the other side of the bed
“Are you trying to make me cry?” Draco croaked, wiping his eyes with his hands “Because I am, and it’s your faults”
“Really?”
“You can’t avoid him forever” Pansy whispered at Draco when they were having dinner in the Great Hall, with Potter just a few seats away from him. It was awkward, Draco ended up avoiding Potter since then, and when they finally saw each other at dinner, Draco immediately took the spot between Pansy and Theodore while Granger and Longbottom were opposite of them, which made Weasley and Potter sit farther from him “He’s your boyfriend”
“With you? It’s never enough” Harry propped back up on his elbow and grinned at Draco happily “I just want to fuck you forever”
Draco Malfoy, will you do me the honour of becoming my one and only husband forever?”
kept bothering me today, but I guess I can’t” Draco chuckled, it was incredibly hard referring to Potter with his first name, but he couldn’t just call him Potter here anymore
“I have troubles with some stuff during Potions, can you help me during dinner?” Goldstein added, Draco bit his lower lip and cursed his life. Why the fuck did this have to happen? Draco glanced at the two guys standing and finally made a decision
“Yeah, separately” Potter said, scratching the nape of his neck “I’m staying with my mum for a month, my dad for a month, and two weeks with Remus and Sirius”
“I…but you grew your hair out” Draco muttered, she let her hair grow out for months now. How-how could it be?
“No, no, I believe you” Harry said, grabbing his hands once again and their eyes met “Draco, look, I trust you, and it’s alright to freak out” He smiled, breathing calmly while Draco was even more scared, it should be the opposite “To be honest, I always think Luna’s right, she’s never been wrong to me before”
“Well, er” Potter slicked his wet hair to the back and finally answered “We are friends, right?”
“What?”
on the same day “Why are you being sentimental? What are you planning?”
” She said softly, hooking her arm around Ron’s and leaned her head on his shoulder “I’ll just have to set up a meeting and make them talk to each other again. One way or another, they’re going to be together anyway, with or without my help”
“Because,
He waved at the redhead, grinning as he stumbled away, bumping into a few Ravenclaws on the way. He must be really surprised then. Draco sighed in relief and got back to his own thoughts, which was a total mess that he needed to sort out.
“Yeah, she’s good at it” She nodded and dug her nails into his arm, making him squeal in pain “
“Yes, I can see that, honey” She covered Hannah’s eyes and glared at them with wide eyes
He put his hands up and stopped them “It’s not that serious, but serious enough for you two not to go in. We wouldn’t want you two to be sick too”
“Aren’t you tired of holding Draco like that?” Ginny asked as Harry was still holding Draco up in his arms “Just let him down”
“Oh god no, if you buy that, I’m going to burn it” Draco laughed softly
He murmured without thinking, and suddenly Harry was spasming, his body shaking and he let out a low growl in Draco’s ear, the man then buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, and the blond felt the warm fluid flowing inside him, he smiled to himself and ruffled Harry’s hair “Such a good boy” Harry didn’t answer, but he heard a soft and quiet chuckle from him, and then a cleaning charm was casted on him. Draco stayed there, playing with Harry’s hair for a while before the Auror pulled his soft cock out of Draco and spoke
“Of course we do” Draco smiled, looking at Harry cheekily and looked at their friends “Thank you guys”
“It’s like our first date” Harry said, hugging Draco from behind as the blond leaned on the balcony “Remember?”
He latched on Draco’s collarbone, smiling to himself when he saw marks showing up after a few attempts of making hickeys. It was obvious that Harry was proud of what he did to the blond, red marks on his neck standing out nicely comparing to his pale skin, which made it looked even more stunning. He stripped off Draco’s blouse,
“I’m sorry, I’m not in the mood” He buttoned his shirt back after Roger undoing it and folded his arms across his chest “Sorry, the photoshoot tired me out today”
“Now?”
“Oh, do you guys want to visit Neville’s office? It’s
” he murmured with heavy breath as soon as Harry let go, moving his lips down to Draco’s neck again, this time he went lower and latched onto Draco’s nipples. Draco opened his mouth, unable to control himself when all he could think of that he wanted Harry’s cock inside him right now. The Auror swirled his tongue around and sucked on the hard bud, his fingers still working at Draco’s entrance, he was stimulated everywhere, Draco couldn’t handle it “
doing this because I’m tired”
“He thinks that just because he goes to work and I took a few months off to take care of Ariel that he’s the
“Yeah, it’s after sex now so I just ordered food, I thought you were it” Pansy sat on the edge of the bed and got into her spot next to Hermione. Draco sat at the end of the bed and folded his legs to face the girls, he sighed and buried his face in his hands
boyfriend”
“Right” He huffed loudly, she understood that Lucius might have to take some time to take it all in, but she believed he could “I will behave”
” Draco moaned, his head falling back on Harry’s shoulder when the firefighter started poking at Draco’s entrance with his cock, the blond pushed back, cooperating and sighing out happily when Harry finally nudged in slowly. Harry snaked his hands around his waist to hug Draco’s closer, the blond’s eyes rolled to the back of his head when Harry went all the way in, he felt so full and happy.
Draco said, smiling at her and leaning back on his headboard “You’re just spending a lot of time with her lately, even more than before. Sometimes I just see you two together a lot, and not the other two, Padma Patil and Hannah Abbott”
“I’m tired” Draco whined “I’ve been working all day, fixing my design over and over again because my boss
“Er, that’s the ring finger, Draco”
He glared at Harry and the man smiled, showing his teeth, and his heart might melt at that smile.
“I didn’t mean Harry” Pansy smacked his arm and started pulling him with her. In front of them was Granger walking with Weasley and Potter, the three of them talking again “I meant Anthony, that guy has been tailing you since Third Year, when you hit puberty, but you and Harry were always so close. Everyone just assume you two were a couple even before Hogwarts, weird, I know. But then Harry confessed to you, everyone was surprised, since then Anthony stopped. And now, suddenly you’re acting distant again, he’s wiggling his way back, that’s why Harry burnt his cauldron”
” Another voice whispered and Draco realised he was blindfolded
“Hey, do you want to have another kid?” Harry asked, surprising Draco with the question
Once he reached his bedroom, Harry sat down at the end of his bed with Draco still straddling him, he felt nervous all of a sudden. Confronting with Draco after years of not talking was way harder than he imagined, he was still trying to process the whole thing, with Draco on his thighs.
“You…you mean it?” Harry swallowed, he has to pull himself together. In no way has he ever imagined himself getting in this kind of situation, Draco seducing him, it was like a fucking dream “What, what about your date?”
“Well, I thought…” Pansy grumbled, her face looked upset “That sucks, so after we went home, you two go separate ways?”
Pansy confessed to their crushes, the only problem was that Pansy’s crush was sober at the time, and then Pansy got married to her crush, but for Draco? His crush was drunk and ended up throwing up on his perfectly new boots he just got
“Don’t worry, you two can resolve it” Lilian touched his hand and walked away. She sounded just like Pansy and Hermione when they comforted him a day after their breakup. He was a mess of tears and snots, he has bags under his eyes and his lips were so dry since he didn’t eat nor drink. He holed up in his bedroom and it took Pansy three weeks to finally pull him to the kitchen and the living room. The first month was the hardest, the worst part was when he still found Harry’s stuff in his place, his scent on Draco’s bed, it all felt so emotional to him.
“So, I
Draco looked at Harry and pointed at their friends, who were looking at them, that was supposed to mean that
“Yeah, he really can’t” Draco said, turning back to look at Harry with a smile, he
“I think so, he was sweet” Draco said, remembering all the sweet things the other Harry did for him “He was kind, he didn’t push me to do anything I wasn’t comfortable with, he always insists we sit together, we sleep together, he says he loves me every day. In the end, I just fell for him”
. The hall is
“I can do another day” Draco shrugged, Pansy seemed really devoted to this
“Oh, I’m sorry, are you talking to me?” Draco replied “I thought we are playing your game to see who stays quiet the longest”
“I know, but you said the first time you saw the mirror, you see us holding hands and kissing right?”
? Which Auror are you going to pick, Draco?”
“Oh so would you rather that I go around and let every guy fuck me?” He grunted at Potter “Is it all in yet?”
“I’m a lot, but don’t give up on me”
“I already said yes, I can’t cancel it”
He looked at his finger, a drop of blood emerging from his skin, it wasn’t big, just a small cut, possibly from the crack on the mirror. Draco stepped back, suddenly feeling all dizzy, he took a huge breath in, the place was spinning around him, that was when he lost balance and everything went black.
“A parrot” Colin replied while putting the shirt on
firefighter that saved him
“I can come up with an excuse” Harry shrugged, pulling out and lying down next to Draco, sliding his arm under the blond’s head so Draco wouldn’t be uncomfortable lying without a pillow “Honestly if I say we had sex, they wouldn’t even be surprised”
“So, did you know the whole threat Hermione got was in Pansy’s plan all along?” Draco said when Harry carried him through the hall
” Draco burst into tears, standing up and extended his hand for Harry to slip the ring on his finger “
wine, in fact, I can marry wine if I could, but I already got a husband. So if I could, I’d divorce him and marry wine instead” He laughed softly when they kept staring at him, he chugged the wine down and wiped his mouth “I can’t get
“Library, he’s studying again, or reading, who knows? He’s in his little bubble that no one can get in” She huffed as they kept walking “He’s probably trying to get the best grades and get out of here”
” He commented, looking down at the ground and wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck as the firefighter started walking inside his apartment. Harry’s place was a bit smaller than Draco’s, but cosier…and messier. Draco has to admit, he felt kind of sad when Harry put him down on the red couch, but the feelings were soon gone when Harry took off his uniform
Draco choked on his food, his hand dropping the fork down on the plate, making a loud cackling sound. Pansy looked at him weirdly and leaned over
“Plan C?”
“Potter, you really need to learn how to talk properly” Draco rolled his eyes at him, waiting for an answer to this weird behaviour of his.
“Draco, it’s fine” Harry rested a hand on the table, he wanted to calm Draco down, he just wanted to hold Draco’s hand and tell him it’s alright “I avoided you first, and er, it helps him use you, I, if I was there at the beginning, I probably, I probably would have intervened, though I know I’m not in a place where I could do that”
Draco whined, his hands reached for Harry’s hair and gripped on them while Harry swirled his tongue around inside Draco, he squeezed on the blond’s arse, pushing them apart so he could go in deeper. He broke away and replaced his tongue with his finger again, this time he pushed in two digits, scissoring and stretching Draco out as he got back to attacking the blond’s chest, making as many marks as possible, partly he wanted to show people that Draco was his now, and partly also because he couldn’t resist Draco at all
“I…no” Ron muttered “I, er…”
” Harry asked eagerly, he couldn’t believe they fought. Should Harry come? “
“I’m not” Harry leaned in “I like you” He buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck and sighed “Ginny will pass out first”
“Thanks” He smiled at his friend “Can’t believe you guys didn’t invite me”
“I am
“It’s horrible” Draco said, he tried his best to mould the chocolate in the shape he wanted, but it was hard, and he sucked at it
say it” Hermione blushed and put the bag in her purse “You are so crazy”
. And you guys teasing each other in the water, now he’s sleeping on your shoulder”
“Oh, it’s not?”
“Do you get it now?”
He has created millions of scenarios in his mind and his father would throw a tantrum in most of them, so he hoped his mother would be the calm one, as she always has been. He even imagined his father throwing curses at Harry, but he doubted his father would win anyway. Draco was lost in his own thoughts until he heard something hitting his window. He expected an owl but there was nothing on the other side of it. He approached the window and looked down at his garden, nothing seemed different.
“Of course not” Pansy reassured him “Well, unless my wife calls, but don’t worry, she gets it” Pansy patted his shoulder to calm his nerves, Draco took a deep breath and knocked on the door “It will be okay”
“It’s alright” Harry said and growled low when Draco stroke his cock again, the blond was having that smug look on his face, he knew just what to do to make Harry weak
He said, and as soon as Potter was leaning in slowly for a kiss, Draco quickly met him halfway.
“I know Draco” He smiled, placing his hands on Draco’s knees
“Oh yeah, she’s one of my best friends, we study in the same university”
” Draco breathed out, turning around and bit his lower lips, draping his arms around Harry’s neck as the man pulled him flushed again, he pushed Harry’s head down for a kiss, smiling into it. He couldn’t help it, he was just…happy. For the first time in his life, he was truly happy, like he had found…the right one, he didn’t want to believe it, but his feelings never deceive him, and for once, his mind was agreeing with his heart, that he was all in for this man. And not just because the sex was brilliant, hell no, it was because of everything else, the sex was just a bonus, it was the way Harry cared for him in the smallest things, the words Harry said, the actions Harry did, it made Draco felt special, like he was loved, and he had wanted that since he was a kid. Harry was probably the only one to know Draco so well besides his friends and family, he knew how to get under Draco’s skin, and…they couldn’t seem to be apart from each other, no matter how much they tried to avoid one another, it seemed like…destiny wanted them to be together, and as corny as it sounded, Draco believed it.
” Draco smiled and grabbed his lotion bottle, standing up “Now I hate to say this, but stand up so I can put lotion on you because Pansy wants Aurors to be
“I said we’ll see them tomorrow, good bye darlings” Narcissa said and stepped forward, she whispered something in Pansy’s ear and walked away with Lucius. As soon as the door closed, Pansy let out a loud breath
“Don’t rub it in”
they will kiss, even
“Fine” Draco replied under his breath, kissing Harry on the lips “Then we’ll have to have sex a lot more, you know, so I have enough information for this question of yours” Harry laughed, pressing a kiss on Draco’s cheek, they were really meant to be, that Harry was sure.
“Oh, well” Draco stuttered, he finished his first bruschetta as well and sipped a bit on his champagne before speaking “Do you remember, that one time I asked you what I should do if I like someone and they’re too oblivious to see it?”
“I may hav—I may…,
” He gasped, his left eye was bright red and the other was normal, and it was green, Draco could be lost in that emerald green eyes of his…if it wasn’t for the infections
me” Pansy sighed in despair, but actually he knew she was being smug right now “Bye, Draco”
. Show me the guy” Hermione demanded and Draco turned his phone around to show the girls the
“He’s not my boyfriend, well, not my…he’s other Draco’s boyfriend” He mumbled quietly, luckily everyone was so focused on their own stories, Theodore talking about Astronomy with Longbottom, Granger hooked on a book, Weasley was busy eating, but Potter, Potter kept glancing at him. He couldn’t deny that it wasn’t understandable, in Potter’s eyes, Draco was his lover, and the fact that he suddenly pushed him away was definitely odd for him, hurtful even, but he didn’t know what else to do “Just cover for me when he stands up”
“I…will go now, have a good night” Potter said hesitantly before eyeing Draco up and down “You…look good in this robes too” Draco blushed red and watched Potter disappeared.
“And since everyone aren’t comfortable, we should refrain from doing it so much in front of you guys” Potter said, Draco looked at him with surprise, a smile was forming on his lips. So this was how it felt to have someone finishing your sentence “Is it working?”
“If you don’t want me to shag him, then you should have remembered what happened three months ago” Draco said, pushing Harry’s arm away and walked out of the restroom, but once again, Harry caught him by his arm
“It’s okay, we get it” Ron snickered, turning away and carrying Ariel up in his arms to run down to the beach. Harry and Draco exchanged knowing glances at each other with a smile before looking down when Lily tugged at their swimming trunks
Draco opened the box and picked up the silver ring in his hands, his mouth falling open “How did you know?”
“I mean what I mean, you know what I mean” Pansy arched an eyebrow at Draco, clearly acting like she understood him, which…she did “Well, guess we have to use plan B”
“Oh, you know, you don’t have to, it’s fine”
, I’ll tell” Draco said finally, making Pansy squealed loudly and clutched on his arm, shaking it violently “It was…it was one of those days after a Quidditch match between our house and the Gryffindor, and you know, I don’t know why, I…that night I dreamt that Potter and I were doing it in the middle of the field”
, I realised I love the way you say my name, so I kept finding reasons for you to call me Draco. When you first faked proposed to me, I wanted it to be real. And all the proposals after that, I wanted all of it to be real. When you and I had a falling out, the first one ever, I thought I had lost you. But when you actually proposed to me that night, I thought it was a dream, just like you” Draco took another breath and continued reading “When we first had our big fight, I thought that’d be
Draco yelped and wrapped his legs and arms around Potter when he stood up abruptly, carrying Draco in his arms,
“I don’t need your help, I would rather break my arm than having you healed it”
and absolutely
“Quick question” Draco said “How sure do you think Blaise is in love with Ron?”
excited for this. Draco smiled and kissed Potter’s forehead “Can we…go somewhere else and continue this?”
that there’s a happy ending to your
don’t worry” She reassured him but somehow he wasn’t convinced by the tone of her voice, she was scheming something, he knew it. As soon as she untied the blindfold, Draco opened his eyes to see a pub, Theo’s pub to be exact. Theo built
“I did charm my way through you, didn’t I?”
“Hold my hand, I want to show you something” He said, it was time for him to tell Harry what happened. He’s been feeling nervous the whole day, there was something telling him that he needed to do it, but now that Harry had given him the ring, he realised he surely has to. When Harry intertwined their hands together, Draco pulled him out of the room full of students partying and into the dark hall “Just…wait, I will show you”
“What will we do tonight?”
? What? I—Theo! Why?”
“I’m not stopping you. Oh you got a bit of…” Draco chuckled and wiped Harry’s lips with his thumb “My lipstick…”
“Ron, Harry, sit down” Hermione ordered them, and even though her tone was soft, Draco can still feel the threat in it
“Oh he is, but normally he sits with you and you help him. Draco, this is a problem, people are starting to get curious” Pansy folded her arms across her chest and huffed when they arrived at the Great Hall “You need to be closer to him if you don’t want to
“We are doing an Auror calendar! Twelve months, twelve hot Aurors” Pansy stepped in to tell them “You guys are the models, that’s the team I’ve hired to help” She pointed her finger at Theo and began “That’s Theodore, he’ll be in charge of your outfits. Then there’s Draco, he’ll be doing your face and hair, putting oil on your bodies. And Blaise, he’s the brilliant photographer, you’ll have to listen to him during the photoshoot”
“No, no” Draco cut him off and continued “I get it, you’re a faithful person, you wouldn’t want to feel like you’re cheating on someone you like, even when you don’t know if they like you back, but consider your place in the Wizarding world, they will definitely like you”
“Do not try to change the topic”
“Our son is dating Harry Potter”
“Thank you, Terry” Pansy softened her voice and smiled at them “Now, I have to pull some strings to get these animals for you, so no whining when you got it”
he told himself, and when Harry touched his leaking cock, Draco bent his back and came all over himself, he ended it with a loud moan, the blond heaved heavily and lied back down
“Oh yeah, I opened it by mistakes, of course, I was going to find Harry’s computer because I borrowed his, I found yours instead. And
” Pansy snivelled loudly, wiping her tears and snots with her handkerchief “I-I may have experienced love myself, but what you two have is incredibly precious, I—I cannot be more thrilled to officiate this wedding. When-when you love someone, you do not love them immediately, you love them from time to time, it doesn’t happen in a second, it happens because you work for it, it doesn’t just come up right away, it appears when you least expect it. Alright, now, have you prepared your vows? Harry?”
” Draco said in a raspy voice, Harry reached up and intertwined their hands together again, Draco cried out and jerked his whole body, arching his back up as his cock throbbed, the blond came quickly, spurting all over the balcony and the floor, Harry’s fingers still stroking him, spreading his come all over the head “
making…”
“Your
“Hi, I’m Penelope” The girl,
“Really?”
“You are beautiful” Harry murmured, taking Draco’s hands in his, warming it up with his body heat “You’re so perfect to me, I don’t know what I’d do without your present”
“I’m not sure I want to go”
they have been married for so long yet they didn’t become an old boring couple,
“I am
“What?” Draco exclaimed “
“I promise it is” Harry gave him a cheeky smile, there was something he was hiding based on the way he kept looking at Draco strangely “Close your eyes” Draco listened and squeezed his eyes closed as Harry touched his hands and led him outside “Wait for it, I’m going to Apparate both of us there” Harry notified him and tightened their grips, Draco felt light headed for a second before he was hit by the cold and the snow falling on his exposed skins. They were outdoor now, somewhere spacious, and Harry didn’t let go of his arms.
“You know they will be here tomorrow right? Pansy knows I come here”
He whined, running his hand through his wet hair, he liked it more when Harry rammed in him like a wild beast, when they both got lost in the moment, and until they could pass out right there. Draco, as Pansy always say, got higher libido than most people, so was Harry, maybe they were a match made in heaven after all “
, oh no, I was just thinking” Draco smiled mischievously and bit his lips “Like in those movies where the hot firefighter carried the girl in his arms. Have you ever done that?”
” He exclaimed and grabbed his Portkey “See you tomorrow” He said and soon, he was back at his own apartment, the apartment he got above Luna’s bookshop, he also sometimes took care of books with her, that was why he grew to be so close with Ginny too, since she came by a lot and slept on his couch when she was tired from Quidditch training.
just find Potter funny.
“It’s alright, no one is here, it’s summer” Harry said in reassurance, he played with Draco’s hands and gazed at him “Hey, do know where we should go?”
Potter mumbled softly behind him, and now the guilt was eating him up, he shouldn’t have avoided Potter like that, now he felt like he was actually leaving someone he loved
“It’s not—…”
“Oh, thank you for bringing me up to my dorm the other day” Theodore said, which made Draco turned to him with a chuckle “What?”
“Oh, yeah” Potter replied
he has concluded that during the three years of living the blond “
“Ron, this is a girl’s mask”
“You seriously don’t know?” Pansy asked
” The blond said, launching himself at Harry for another kiss, he rolled his hips again, moving in sync with Harry’s thrusts. He didn’t care anymore, he didn’t care if anyone caught them, it’d be
Ron squinted his eyes to read the words in Harry’s ring and looked at the words inside Draco’s ring in his hand “
“Not really” He said, sighing deeply and turning on his heels to talk to Ron “Why are you here? Another rematch?”
, the scent of apple from his lipgloss, the taste of wine from Draco’s tongue, the way their bodies were flushed together, Harry cupped Draco’s face and deepened their kiss. Kissing Draco felt like running under a rain, wet and exciting, kissing Draco felt like walking under the July sun, hot and sweating, kissing Draco felt like sleeping in on weekends, it made him keep wanting to do it. If he could kiss Draco forever, he would, he would do anything to be next to Draco. Harry slid his hands down to Draco’s legs and grazed his fingers over the blond’s inner thighs.
“Hold on” Pansy put a hand up in the air “Like…
get hard in front of you”
“Everyone” Harry stood up, pulled the chair out for her to settle down “This is Haley”
“You know, you don’t have to do this” Draco said when they were having dinner at the Great Hall, with Potter doing everything for him, putting his favourite food in his tray, filling up his goblet with pumpkin juice. Not only that, he also did a bunch of other things, like holding his bag for him, carrying books for him, Potter was just too nice for him. Maybe it was because he still considered Draco as his boyfriend, but it was getting annoying, because it was way too sweet, Draco could not handle it.
“It’s not sweats, I just took a shower”
“That’s not my business”
Draco couldn’t help but smile a bit and got back to watching the opera, it didn’t feel bad either, to have Potter leaning on him like this.
“What colour?” Pansy jumped to Theodore’s bed and grabbed the black nail polish “Maybe black? It fits you”
“You know when I told you guys I’d order a stripper for Harry’s birthday?” He asked, he felt so guilty for messing up his only assignment when he had begged the girls to let him do it
“I’m sorry” Pansy pouted, grabbing his chin with her hand and planted a kiss on his cheek “But honey, you
best friend,
“What? Er, no”
“Auror Malfoy and Auror Potter”
doing this for Ron”
“Kiss me, you arse” Ron nagged when his lips were still unoccupied
His grip on Harry’s hair was tighter and he kept going “
“Alright” Potter snickered softly and looked at Draco, the blond felt a sudden wave of unknown feelings in his heart but kept looking back at him “The kiss was perfect, in fact, I want more” He said jokingly, but Draco’s heart beat faster when he heard it
“Nowhere” Theodore shook his head, taking off his robes when Pansy rushed to him, touching his face
“He obviously likes you, I thought you listened to me when I gave you that speech” Pansy said, reminding him about the time she made a board to prove that Potter liked him. Sometimes he wondered if Pansy and Granger would ever talk to each other, because they seemed like they would actually hit it off. He scoffed at her and nodded “Okay, so you did hear the speech. How are you not convinced? Theo believes it”
before running out of the Ministry when he heard the familiar voice again
“Sure,
, Malfoy” Potter grabbed his shoulder the moment his hands started waving furiously, he made lots of hand gestures when he’s having a fit, it was a habit Pansy had pointed out many times but he couldn’t get rid of “I, it’s not a joke”
special” That was true, the blond had called his mother last week to ask her how to make chocolates, he wanted it to be done by his own hands, so he had sneaked out of his dorm almost every night since then to try making chocolate in the Hogwarts’s kitchen. Some of the elves even helped him, but last night, he was able to make the
“It’s Draco” Pansy repeated, sighing loudly “He came back this year, we…we have been hanging out secretly because he doesn’t want Harry to know he’s back,
“A favour, if you want”
name when he came, McLaggen was actually
It’s not like it’s wrong!”
“You know, Harry said—…”
“Are you sure you want to stay?” Potter asked him one more time “We hiked all the way here for this”
, to all of those, and
” He whined, his cock still untouched “More-…” Ron’s eyes widened when he heard a loud slam from the door of the restroom. Blaise stopped thrusting and the redhead covered his own mouth with his hands
“You crave it, blondie” Pansy teased him and chugged the rest of her drink left before getting off the stool “Gotta go in the lady’s room, order me another one please!” He nodded and she ran through the crowd to get to the loo. Draco asked Hannah for another Firewhisky and fiddled with the rim of his cup, he thought about love sometimes, he wanted it of course, but it was hard for a person like him to find a partner, it wasn’t just because he was a former Death Eater, it was also because his personalities were hard for people to love. He’s stubborn, opinionated, reserved and it wasn’t easy for anyone to read him, he was like a closed room with locks all over the door, and no one seemed to know the keys or find ways to get in, at least not yet. All the men that have been in his life and have gone away, none of them really left him with any important memories, he winded up forgetting all of them quickly, no one got him the way he wanted, no one really knew how to get under his skin…well, except one, one person he has been trying to avoid talking about, yet still ended up talking about him a whole lot. Draco turned to his left and saw a glimpse of Potter at a booth alone, his friends must be late again
Draco asked again, still not believing this was actually real. It couldn’t be real, he was either insane or this was all a prank, or maybe he died and this was his hell, where Potter was his boyfriend and he has to suffer it.
“I think I just felt Potter’s cock” Draco murmured quietly
couldn’t even process it. All those years, you guys built up this friendship, and thanks to your friendship with Draco, we were able to be friends with the Slytherin, and I was able to find love with Blaise. Why would you risk 7 years of friendship and throw it away just because of one small problem?”
“Excited?” He asked, picking up the moisturiser from his makeup box “I know Pansy’s idea is crazy, but it seems nice”
“You don’t look like yourself right now” She poked him repeatedly and tapped on his cheek “You left early yesterday, and this morning you didn’t even laugh at all the fun things we said”
!” Pansy waved at them and Potter arched an eyebrow at him
“I know, I’m sorry for that” Potter said and turned around to walk away
“I’m sorry” Potter said, extending his hand out to touch his arm, pleading for forgiveness. He didn’t want to look directly into the Gryffindor’s eyes, they always held power on him, he couldn’t say no to it,
“I can’t force you to do anything, it’s bad enough I’m helping you in secret when I should have told my girlfriend, who’s actually
“No smoking” He changed the topic and Blaise smiled at him, wrapping his arms around Ron’s waist
“I don’t think it could be expressed into words” Harry murmured, ghosting his lips over Draco’s “Maybe I could show you”
Draco never knew he could actually miss Harry’s sweet voice, his touches, and especially his cuddles. It was hard for him to sleep ever since he got back, curse Harry and his warm hugs. Draco sighed, looking at Harry from far away, he missed him. He wished they were boyfriends now, but that was such a crazy thought to have right now. He shook his head and looked the other way, getting back to his plan.
“I am, I am, I was always so brave when I flirt with him and I-…”
Brandon”
“Yeah? What about it?”
put a Silencio on you” Draco threatened without any venom in his words and he let Harry open the box.
”What are you saying? You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, you are my whole world” Harry said, leaning his forehead against Draco “I don’t care what the world thinks”
“Yeah” Harry said, losing his balance a bit when Ron Apparated back to his place. Instead of the quiet sound in the street just a second ago, he heard people shouting, music blasting out loud now
” He murmured and turned around, sitting back down on his chair. If the girls meddled in his business with Harry, he would kill them. Draco’s foot started tapping against the floor again, it was his habit when he got nervous. Draco felt his heart beating faster when Harry arrived from behind and sat down in front of him
“So let tonight be the night that you finally tell him how you feel” Pansy was still next to him, she murmured a spell and a box flew in her hand
“Oh, stupid me” He giggled and suddenly gasped “Where’s my husband?”
Ron stopped in his tracks once he saw Draco next to his best friend “Draco, you’re here too?”
“You’re incredible” Harry whispered into his ear, pushing the fourth digit into Draco’s entrance and his other hand teasing the blond’s nipple above the water. It was supposed to only be a bubble bath together, Draco should have known being alone in a room with Harry always lead to sex. He felt Harry’s hard length pressing on his back, his back flushed against Harry’s chest as his husband leaned on the bathtub
“Look” Harry pointed his finger at the sentence on this mirror in front of them” It says,
“Fuck, it does feel amazing” Potter sighed out happily
“So, do you want to have dinner tonight?”
“You did that, er, that thing for the game right?” Harry asked, now he was the one to make Draco stun “The last thing”
“Second” His mother continued “Because of the box, we know you like him”
“Nah”
“I know, I just want to lighten the mood” His best friend shrugged, nudging him with his elbow, he understood Harry, he knew Harry still wanted to propose, he just didn’t want to push “You know what I think when Blaise proposed to me?”
“It looks cute on me” Draco said, showing off his wrist. Just a few days ago Luna had given him a nice bracelet with flowers on them, it was small and cute. Draco didn’t think he’d ever put it on, but when he tried it on his left arm, the bracelet was something of the opposite to his Dark Mark, like a ray of sunshine in a dark sky. He felt more comfortable looking at his arm now, which was why he decided to keep wearing it, even when it didn’t match his clothes at all
“You’re good to go to Theo for your outfit, who’s next?”
” He crawled into Neville’s lap and straddled him “Listen, there was no emotion between me and them, maybe them for me, but I had none for them”
one in this household” Ron shrugged, sipping on his beer and grinned at Draco “I told him a guy was flirting with me yesterday, but he didn’t think I was telling the truth, he didn’t think I could get a guy. I’m showing him he should never mess with me, I can charm any guy whenever I want”
“What?
“Me? No, it’s alright” He said but she was already approaching him “Luna”
“Haven’t you noticed?” He said, avoiding her eyes, instead he kept looking at the certain group of Gryffindors “I hope you will”
“No, you won’t. Don’t worry” Pansy patted his back and reassured him “Don’t stress yourself. Maybe just…spray at the next person you see, I guess it’ll work” She said and Draco scoffed
Pansy squealed as soon as the bell rang, Draco looked at her and looked back at Harry, he didn’t even have the time to say anything yet. Draco choked on his own words and watched Harry moved to another table, with the guy who was flirting with Harry before, right next to him. Draco started panicking, he didn’t know what to do. He lost his chance again, and now the guy was all over Harry just like a while ago
“Dirt” She wiped his cheek and gasped “
” Rose answered, sticking her tongue out and slid her hand into Harry’s, beaming up at Harry. She was rebellious, but at the same time, a brilliant kid, she was exactly like the combination of Hermione and Pansy. He has been babysitting Rose with Draco since the day she was born, she was a loveable kid. She reached out for him and he carried her up in his arm like she was a baby
“Draco”
“Wanna get off?” Potter turned to ask him and Draco realised he won’t get to be on his back anymore, he nodded and slowly got off to the ground
” Draco cried out, tilting his head back and leaned on Harry’s shoulder, sobbing in ecstasy, he gripped on Harry’s biceps tightly and turned his head to the side for a kiss “
“It’s just a birthday, Ron” Harry said, still scribbling down his file, he wasn’t really excited about this birthday, after all, he
“Are you proposing to me again?” Draco asked as Harry laughed, he shook his head and cupped Draco’s face
’, you sounded pretty smug then” She tried to mimic his voice, which totally didn’t sound like him at all “I thought you were wrong,
“Well, yeah” Pansy shrugged and gave him a big smile, showing her white teeth, she was happy, he could tell “She
I always thought Harry would bring Draco to meet James and Lily at some point in their relationship, and I’m sure as hell it’d always be emotional.
“Oh, what is it? Is it something bad?”
Potter sat up and looked at him, he probably looked like a mess right now, wet hair, sweaty body, shaking limbs “What?”
“Stop smoking” He repeated “I hate smokes, I don’t want someone I love to taste like smoke when I kiss them”
“Are you obsessed with hospitals and getting yourself injured?” Draco chuckled dryly, he gripped tightly on his robes, still feeling Potter’s gaze on him. The Gryffindor wasn’t subtle, he probably didn’t know how to be subtle to save his life “So, what are you going to become? An Auror?”
“Don’t worry, I’ll come tonight to sort it out, I can borrow some from Theo’s boutique”
“I don’t”
version of you” Draco has to admit, he was falling for Harry as well “It wasn’t because you two look exactly alike, but it’s because of you, I fall for you” He didn’t know how to express himself, but he meant what he said. Even here or there, he still fell for Harry anyway “Do you…well, do you like me?”
, did you just bite me?” Harry flinched away, gaping at Draco and covering the spot on his neck that the blond just bite on
“Huh?” Theo let go and left his hand stroking the length
“I don’t know” He said “It wasn’t supposed to hurt
“Fuck me, Potter” He said and quickly got attacked by those lips again, he felt another wave of charm flowing through him, he should have known Harry would be careful in sex too, his hand started slithering between the cleft of Draco’s arse. The blond whimpered when Harry started pushing a digit in his lubed entrance. Their kiss deepened as Draco parted his lips, inviting Harry in again, he seemed to forgot all that was happening right now, all he felt was the way Harry invaded his mouth and his finger reaching just the right spot inside Draco. The blond whimpered quietly when Harry pushed in another finger, scissoring them, opening Draco wider. And since all his senses were heightened when he closed his eyes, all he could do was feel, their voices mixing into each other with the sound of water. His knees threatened to give up when Harry pushed in the third digit, curling his fingers, making Draco hummed into their kiss.
“Normally it would take three hours, five if it’s long”
“Is it all in?”
He bit on his lips to bit back a moan when Potter put his finger in along with his tongue, Draco put his arm on his forehead and felt the sweats on his face and hair, every muscle in his body ached for more
“It’s on your hand, Weasley” Draco pointed at his left hand and Ron laughed loudly after he realised he was holding his beer
“Oh, er, well, for starter…he
be fine” He said, smiling when Harry pulled him in a hug, he felt something poking his chest and looked up at his boyfriend “What’s that in your inside pocket?”
“Thank you guys” Draco said, tying up his robes and fixing his hair “I will definitely tell them tomorrow”
“You know he can’t cook to save his life, Hermione” Theo said, nudging her elbow as she nodded. It wasn’t wrong, he always found a way to buy food, or when he was…dating Harry, he would be the chef and Draco would just be the one to enjoy the food. Ever since they parted ways, Draco was back to eating random food again, since he never cooked nor know how to “Maybe I should tell Luna to make some extra food and bring it to you”
Draco raised a hand and stepped back when Potter was going to approach him “
“Hey, isn’t this an article of me in our graduation?” Harry showed him a picture of himself giving the speech at graduation and Draco yanked it from his hand again, putting it back in the box and closed it.
have already stood there waiting for him, Draco didn’t get the chance.
Pansy babbled and stared at Draco “I’ve heard your excuses for years, Draco. Don’t you think I’ve got those memorised on the back of my hand? Darling, listen…I love you, our friends love you, we just want you to find someone”
“We understand”
“So, er…do you, well, do you have feelings for me too?” Harry finally finished a sentence and Draco gave him a pleased smile.
“You know what I mean, Hermione” Draco rolled his eyes and shook his head, putting his wine glass back on the table nearby “I know what you’re doing, you’re going to make me kiss Potter”
are Harry” Brandon showed a slick smile, extending his hand for a handshake “Draco told me
“Is it good?” Harry asked, his eyes still glued on Draco’s glossy lips with a bit of chocolate on, but he didn’t dare touch it, though he felt an urge to.
think it’s adorable”
“That doesn’t prove anything”
“You will?”
” Draco said, looking back at Harry, his lips twitching a bit a formed a smile “If you notice, I always ask you first before I decide anything before, not that I will always choose your decision, but I feel like I want to hear what you think…and mostly, I’d listen to you. Like when I asked you whether I should become a Healer or not, I was torn then, because I wasn’t sure if people have accepted me yet at the time, but you helped me realised that I deserve better, and that I should do anything I want, so, I became a Healer because of you”
“Alright then” Ron patted his shoulder and walked back to the Floo, finally leaving Harry alone “But just so you know, it’s either
“Thank you, Draco, I’m enjoying it already” Luna smiled at him and gasped “
He shushed her, covering her open mouth with his hand “It was nothing much, it’s just…he was on top of me, and even in my fucking dream, he was nice enough to put his robes on the grass so it didn’t hurt my back.
“Plan A?”
“He said Hermione will be teaching him today” Blaise said, and if Draco was right, he could sense a bit of annoyance in his tone of voice. Blaise was never the type to say a lot of things, so when he did, it was because his emotions were high, sometimes it’d be joy, or affection, but now, it was probably because he was upset
“Funny story, the case I was working on” Harry explained “We had to collaborate with the Auror Force from America, and I met her” They had just met three weeks ago when the case started, Haley has been liking him since the first moment they met, he knew that, but never said anything. Things went crazy yesterday when they celebrated the case being solved, which led to Haley getting drunk and slept on his bed while he slept on the couch. In the morning she had invited herself to lunch when she saw the letter Pansy sent him, Harry didn’t want to be rude so he didn’t say anything, which he realised now he should have.
“Hey, Harry!” Pansy gripped his shoulder and grinned, she was wearing a the same shirt as Hermione, just in different colour, wearing matching shirts like the couple they were “How’s the new missing person case?”
“Here, try some” Draco held up a spoonful of soufflé and opened his mouth, signalling Harry to eat it. The Auror complied in reflex, he could never say no to Draco “So? Spectacular, right? I can eat ten of this”
“Pansy, er, she, she told me you had sex with Brandon”
“Yeah? What else should I call you? I thought you didn’t want me to call you babe or honey or other pet names because it always makes you blush” Potter said, ruffling his hair and smiling at him, a smile Draco has never seen on him before “That hurts, by the way”
“I’m pretty sure she said she wants to end up on Harry’s bed tonight” Hermione added just in time, this time it obviously was a lie “So she will be thrilled to be kissed by Harry. You know she likes him, it’s clear”
“I hit the bloody nail right on your head, Draco” Pansy smirked satisfactorily, sipping more of her drink and continued “I’m right, as always, you know—oh,
“Oh right, goodbye guys” She smiled at them and disappeared through the crowd again
“Er, sure” Neville said, crouching down so Draco could pushed Theodore on his back
” Draco bit his lower lip, hands grabbing the bedsheet tightly
they still fuck like bunnies every day. There was one time Draco bent down to pick up a quill in an Auror meeting, and somehow they ended up doing it in Harry’s office after the meeting was done. At the beginning of their relationship, Draco was afraid he wouldn’t be able to satisfy Harry’s sexual needs, turned out his fear was completely irrational when he realised he seduced Harry into having sex a hell lot too.
“This one is out” Blaise spoke, putting his cigarette in the ashtray on the table and picked a sleeping Ron up in his arms “We’re heading home first”
to tell” Neville argued “I…Theo, listen, there’s nothing between us, she just kissed me, I-I didn’t know, she just lunged at me, I was caught off guard” Based on his voice, Neville was really trying to explain it “She wanted to be back with me, yes, but I didn’t, I said no, I said no almost a week ago. Remember? After the first photoshoot, I-I just denied her, and I was going to find you, but you left, and-and then Roger was all over you, I-I thought, I thought you ended it with me”
“I still have them” Draco huffed playfully and swatted her hand away “Stop teasing me”
“What are you saying?”
for arriving late” He said, pouting when he was pushed in Blaise’s chest “You said you’d be home early”
“You’re forty and single” Pansy mumbled to him, sipping from her colourful glass of cocktail with her hair fell down to her shoulder “Harry,
fucking way that Potter’s into him. That was simply insane!
for you, Draco” Ron murmured to him, the redhead wasn’t the one to say sentimental things like this, so it must be the last resort to see him telling Draco this “And you know who’s the right one for you, Draco, you’re smart, you know that”
soft sponge on your face, Ron, don’t be such a baby” He rolled his eyes and luckily, the redhead listened
“Remember the guy you took a picture of in our university’s campus this morning, but you only saw his back and you asked me to find him? He was walking with a redhead at the time?”
“Yeah?” Hermione replied, gripping their hands together tight, she’d do that every time Pansy told a story about the past, especially the war, it was a kind of reassurance Hermione always gave Pansy “You’ve told me about your job”
“Hey” Draco turned around when Harry called him, they were about to go on a date when Harry got a call
“I know we have all opened our presents, but I want to give you this, another one” She pulled out a rectangle box wrapped in red papers and green ribbons, placing it on his lap.
Luna stood between them and announced the result. Their friends were cheering, except for Romilda, who turned out to be quite a sore loser when she kept hissing at Ron “
Pansy gasped and covered her mouth with her hand “
“Well, you look like you’ve lost something you really love, it’s like me when I lost my favourite dress, Ginny said I had that sad look”
” Ron covered her mouth and glared, Pansy was notorious for walking in on every couple when they do it in the bedroom, sometimes by accident, sometimes she just wanted to scare the hell out of them when she jumped in the room Polyjuiced as their parents “And don’t ever pull that prank again”
He yelled loudly and soon Draco was walking out with a black night robe on him while Harry only has his jeans on, they both have sex hair and sweaty bodies, he couldn’t imagine what they were doing in the bedroom earlier “We almost die trying to cover up for you two. I turned into an alcoholic for you”
Draco kept hearing two people talking next to him, the same voice from earlier, and another voice, of a girl, also a voice he had heard before
, Blaise” He wrapped his hands around Blaise’s neck, giving him a loving smile. He was now Ron’s,
“You’re gorgeous” Potter smiled and wrapped Draco’s legs around his middle, then the Auror put his arms on either side of Draco’s head and tilted his head down to kiss the blond, he felt Potter’s head poking at his entrance, and Draco arched against it, he
“Yeah, I know Potter likes me”
“Apparently dating is more important” Hermione huffed softly, picking up a book next to the couch “I can’t believe she left me to go on a date with some girl”
“Come on, I know you always have a backup to your backup plan, and then a backup to your backup backup plan” Ron scoffed and leaned on the wall next to Pansy “You’re exactly like Hermione at that point”
“Two hundred percent sure” Theo chuckled quietly and based on the gentle way Blaise was guiding Ron to help him with the photoshoot, Draco was two hundred percent sure too.
that guy in our history book, right?” She pointed out but he could only open his mouth in shock “He was born under the effect of love potion, when his father found out and tried to take him away, the mother killed them both with a curse and killed herself after. A tragic story, honestly”
You always make things complicated when it’s not. Why is it so hard to do this?
“I’m sorry” Harry laughed breathily, wiping the tears off Draco’s cheeks, kissing him at the same time “I’m sorry I made you cry”
“You finished his sentence for him” Harry made a choked noise, Draco looked at him strangely and nodded “And you gave him the address?”
” Draco walked with a limp on the way back. The horse ranch
“Can I try?” Potter said, holding his own wand in his hand. Draco gazed him with suspicion in his eyes but nodded anyway. He could feel Potter’s magic coursing through him, running under his skin, but it didn’t work “Can I, er, touch your hands? To see if it worked?” Draco bit on his lower lip, hesitating before extending his hands. They fit perfectly in Potter’s hands, but he didn’t want to pay attention to that, because what caught his interest was the warmth of Potter. His hands were practically burning, making Draco’s hands melt into him. A small content hum was out of his throat before he noticed it, Draco met Potter’s eyes and jerked his hands back.
“Y-yeah, he said Blaise looks better, and I disagree, because your robes fit your slim body and the colour really brings out your eyes. And while Blaise looks good and fit in robes like that, he’s kinda too firm for it, his shoulder is too broad for it, and you—you look delicate and radiant, and completely alluring in…it, and that’s when you started yelling…” Potter said and sat down, Draco stared at them, his feet frozen on the ground.
Draco mumbled, watched as Harry aligned himself up at his entrance. When he slowly pushed in, Draco gripped on his arm and pushed back, making it go deeper. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist as their chests touched, he kissed Draco lovingly and trailed the kisses down his neck “
“I know you can do it” Pansy said when Draco walked past her, there was a small break so he had to went in the loo, since he drank a lot to avoid talking “You’re chickening out again”
“I’m sorry” He put his hand on Harry’s chest, feeling comfortable with that action “I really am. When it comes to the things I’ve done to you…it’s too much, that I didn’t know where to start”
“You know, if he doesn’t want to show his face, he could just use Polyjuice, or a spell” Hermione suggested “Or he could just wear a mask. Remember those masks Luna used to make for the masquerade ball at the Ministry four years ago?” Hermione gasped and grabbed Pansy’s hand “She made a bunch and even sold it? I think she still has some left”
“Hey, er, how much do you think P—Harry loves me?” He asked in the library, lowering his voice so Potter couldn’t hear him. Granger was next to him, he figured it’d be easy just to ask her how her best friend felt about him
sex of your life?”
“Superglue” Hermione chuckled and pulled out a key card “So, we have already checked in our suites, your room is next to us”
This is just brilliant! I cannot believe this finally happened, I have to buy you two something, kind of like some gift, you know, for finally getting together. Draco, I cannot tell you how many times Harry dreamt about y—…”
“Yeah, Hermione gave me this as a present”
” Draco whispered the answer
“You will?” Hermione’s eyes twinkled with love “Really?”
“I changed my mind” Blaise shrugged and Pansy let go of the subject even though she still looked suspicious
” Draco placed both of his hands on Harry’s stomach and breathed out when he went all down. Draco felt so tight around him, all hot and quivering, he slowly moved back and forth, testing Harry’s patience when he couldn’t thrust up and just lying there letting Draco control him “You are really patient this time”
“You and your crazy ideas” Draco smiled, shaking his head and trying to ignore what Pansy had just suggested. She was going insane, telling Draco to do such a thing.
“Hey” Pansy said as the portrait opened again, Potter walked in along with Thomas and Finnigan, it was no surprise those two were hands in hands
to see Harry, but he ignored it. He will just have to avoid Harry for the rest of his life if he has to, he was too embarrassed, he would bury his feelings and live on like he always did.
“I think I do” Harry replied, looking at the kid “I do”
“Oh, me too” Draco said, he was a bit surprised
“I wonder what this hand could do to me in my bedroom” Smith whispered “We could be so good together again”
“Are you…disagreeing with me?” Pansy said, her eyes widened, Draco has to admit it, Pansy could be scary when she wanted to
“Kiss me, you can still do that, if you want”
” Pansy squeaked, clutching on Hermione’s wrist on the table “Is that…” Harry glanced at Draco when Pansy asked, he supposed Draco knew now, the ring band fitted perfectly on her finger, he didn’t know it could even work, but Draco’s fingers were thin and elegant, so of course it’d fit a girl.
“Are you incapable of hearing it the first time?” Draco bent down, grabbing the guy’s wrist “
“Brandon and him got into a fight—
“I think it’s better if Harry carries you” Hermione urged him “You can’t walk like this”
She rubbed his back as he trembled with heartache, Pansy let out a soft sigh and whispered something with her wife
” Pansy cupped his face and touched everywhere on his body “Are you okay? Did you get hurt? Were you attacked?
“I know” Pansy nodded, holding Hermione’s heels for her “So, you alright? No need for us to stay with you?”
“How did you know?”
“What’s this, mummy?” They heard Hugh pointing at something on the water and the girls leaning close to look
on the screen, showing all types of…bare arse and such
two weeks before Harry’s birthday, but who was counting anyway. Draco leaned back on the wall with his arms folded in the courtyard as he watched all the other students gathered together to talk. It was making him worried, everyone seemed to have made progress, except for himself, and Harry. They were practically strangers by now, before they’d still talk to each other, even though it was just insults flying back and forth, it still counted as talking. What should he even do now?
“Fun fact” Hermione pointed her finger in the air as they walked through the coffee farm. The one she had planned, there were other tourists, even Muggles, but that wasn’t what Draco worried about “Money
“Draco
approached them and Penelope nodded at him respectfully before walking away. Now he can see Harry clearly, and
“Are you alright?” Pansy walked to him and asked worriedly
“Oh, well, we’re not talking, but I don’t hate him, we just had a falling out”
coincidental” Pansy nudged him, he could never study anymore now that she got here “A few months ago, we were having lunch, and you two were making out, Luna suddenly mentioned something about how there are multiple universes that are existing at the same time like us right now, like there are hundreds of versions of us in each universe there”
Pansy squeaked and yelled at Draco “
” Draco quickly pushed Potter away when he heard the familiar voice of the Headmistress
“I’d do anything for you because you deserve some love, honey” Pansy grabbed his hand and held it tightly “It’s kinda sad to see you’re the only one left in our group”
you said
Also did I just imply Minnie and Poppy’s relationship? Hmm...maybe, maybe I did
“So…”
“Well, we are not sure” Hermione said and sighed, she pulled Pansy’s hand close and intertwined it with hers “Draco, feelings can’t be measured by time, if you ask me, I
“Oh” He grinned to himself as Harry walked to the living room and settled down next to him, the blond turned his head away to prevent himself from actually drooling from looking at Harry’s body, he received the cup from Harry’s hand and started drinking
Theodore murmured into Neville’s neck, sliding his hands into the blond hair of the Gryffindor. Draco couldn’t help but smiled a bit when he saw them leave the room, one more couple was on the way. Draco looked around the room only to see Harry staring at him again, it was like Sixth Year all over again, only this time Harry wasn’t hiding. The blond flushed from the intense stare and sipped on his drink, turning away, it was hard avoiding him like this, but he has no other choice.
