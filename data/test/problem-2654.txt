,” and it was nearly enough to make Harry come right there, moving against him.
“I don’t mind if I do,” Dumbledore said pleasantly. He reached into his pocket and withdrew what appeared to be a Quick-Quotes Quill. “Ah, here it is . . . I believe Rita Skeeter introduced me to the use of these handy little things. With some exaggeration, perhaps, but Alastor will just have to accept it . . . Shall we proceed?”
Remus ignored his change of subject. “How’s Draco?”
to include me!'
He didn't know for certain, but he had an idea that next year, the Sorting Hat's song might be a little less dire.
Far off, there was the burbling of a fountain, the sinking sun. Then the gate swung open and he was admitted.
Absorbed in his book, Harry didn’t answer.
The wind was whistling by Harry’s ears, and the bike was emitting a low roar, thrumming beneath him; it was so much more
'Ron,' Harry said urgently. 'You can't think she—likes him? She's in love with you. He's your brother. She's just trying to be nice—'
, or something ridiculous—"
“Your fans,” Ginny said from behind him, leaning against the doorframe, just as another four letters arrived.
. Aberforth told me to keep you as hostages, but I refused. If you wanted to leave, it was your choice. I don't regret it.'
'Maybe tomorrow will be better,' Harry suggested. He took a step closer to Malfoy, close enough that he could have reached out and taken him by the shoulders, if he had wanted to, but Malfoy was not looking at him.
“Ah,” Remus said, ignoring the remnants of Harry’s aggravation and taking a patient sip of his tea. “Peter and James, at James’s fifteenth birthday celebration—if you squint, you can spot Sirius attempting rather awfully to kiss every girl there in the background—"
Ron sees the expression on Harry's face and says tentatively, 'Herm, isn't an hour a—sort of a long time—'
'Oh, I'm sure Granger was positively eager to
‘Hmm,’ Harry only mumbled. ‘Come back to bed, Malfoy.’ He meant it to sound joking, riffing off Malfoy’s own comment, but it came out sounding like an invitation.
“Well, I hardly see what they have to protest about,” said Padma, who sat next to Hannah. “What else was the Headmaster supposed to do, cancel Potions for good? He had to appoint someone else.”
Harry felt a flash of guilt for his absence.
Harry thinks of Sectumsempra and says nothing.
Harry had to smile at the furious note in Draco’s voice, which he had no intention of heeding. “I’m not going anywhere,” he said stubbornly. “Since when?”
'Even if I'm an imposter?'  He raises his eyebrows at her.
“Ron!” Hermione said shrilly. Even Ginny looked taken aback.
'Professor,' he called out, 'I heard you were the best Seeker Gryffindor's ever had, until Harry!'
'Ah,' Mrs. Black says.  'A Death Eater, are you?'
'Blood ties mean obligations,' Malfoy says, cutting Harry off with a look.  'Blood faith, a common bond, you know.  If someone with the proven pedigree calls in a favour like that, you do what you can.  Pureblood etiquette, it's a law older than Hogwarts.'
'It's not an us and them situation,' Harry insisted. 'I'm not part of some big group who's always on the side of popular opinion—I mean, look how many times Hogwarts turned against me, no one would even talk to me when they thought I had it out for Muggle-borns in second year—'
'What has that got to do with—'
Harry instinctively folded his arms, hugging his elbows; he felt the shiver run through him, thinking always of Sirius. Cedric's body, sprawled in the graveyard; Sirius, arching back, forever. Every morning in the mirror, his mother's eyes. "Maybe you've forgotten why there's a war to begin with," he said tersely. "Me."
'Oh, honestly!' the man in the portrait harrumphed, sounding eerily like Hermione on one of her rages. When Harry and Malfoy did not even look up, he stalked out of his frame and fled from picture to picture until he'd left the hall altogether.
“Could be a spy,” Ron grumbled.
He doesn't stop to think about the fact that they started with Malfoy.
'I KNOW,' Malfoy bellowed. 'Will you let me finish? I saw you sixth year and everybody was fawning over you and acting like you were so precious and special—'
He says, ‘Are you happy?’
Ron's face immediately went from stony to sorry.
The thought of the small gasps she made when he put his hand round her breast while kissing her, and the idea that she'd never make those sounds for him again, sent something unpleasant knifing through his stomach.
'Ron has a point,' Harry said as he helped himself to the bowl of mashed potatoes. 'No one stopped them from coming. It was their choice.'
'I did not!'
Snape eyed him coldly. “There is a time and place for everything, Potter, and when we are practicing, I told you to
Malfoy looked at him for a moment, his lips pressed together, and then he exhaled. 'I know you were there,' he muttered. 'On the tower that night he died. Snape told me. He saw both broomsticks and he knew about your Invisibility Cloak, and then you were chasing us, it only made sense.'
Harry snorts, then tries to look innocent as Hermione fixes him with a glare.  'You can't give us detention, Hermione.'
“Well, if it isn’t Harry Potter,” Draco Malfoy spat at him, looking as if Christmas had come early. “Aren’t you a little far from home, Potter?”
'Well, there's a surprise,' Malfoy drawled. He led Pansy towards one of the brightly colored umbrellas, all of which seemed to have Heating Charms on them, from the circles of melted snow beneath their shade. If Harry didn't know better, he would think that Pansy was crying.
Professor McGonagall had agreed to announce the match, and donned her tartan cloak in honor of the occasion. She was nowhere near as partial a commentator as Lee Jordan, or as hilarious as Luna, but she was shrewd and accurate with her narration of the plays. Only four goals were scored, however, by the time Harry caught the Snitch in one hand, at least a meter in front of Malfoy's grasping fingers.
Hermione was near tears. 'Harry, I'm sorry, it's horrible—'
'You should go, Harry,' Hermione said. 'Here.'
“Oh, shut it,” he returned good-naturedly. “Both of them did all right in the Department of Mysteries, didn’t they?”
'What does that even mean?' Harry exclaimed. 'What are you saying? I—it's not like—I don't go around saying it to loads of people, I've never even said it to you—'
“Anyway,” he said, “Dumbledore told me what happened there.” He wasn’t exactly in the mood to talk about the war and Lucius Malfoy, but it seemed preferable to talk of how he’d fallen off his broom and anything remotely relating to the blow job Tonks had given him. “About—about his brother.”
'What's that smell?' he asks suspiciously, poking his head into the kitchen.  He still has a faded bruise on his neck from his fight with the wardrobe, well over a week ago, which makes Harry smile despite himself.  Malfoy's wearing one of Dudley's old shirts—'Did you used to be an elephant, Potter?' he demanded, after Harry neglected to tell him it had once belonged to a Muggle to prevent having to hear about it all day—and he's swimming in it.
'Yeah,' Harry said. 'Besides, Sirius would have approved. He always said you were his favorite cousin.'
“That’s nice,” Ginny said, as if she hadn’t heard him, and sat down next to Hermione. “What about Malfoy? He’s been strangely quiet lately, hasn’t he? I suppose the Slytherins are all still sad about Snape.”
'Harry,' she said quietly, Ron standing tall beside her. 'It's not your fault. They all chose it. You didn't make anyone fight. And they knew the stakes just as well as we did.'
“Budge up,” Draco finally demanded, poking him with his elbow. “If you’re going to steal my bed, the least you can do is make room.”
'He's—he's great, Hagrid,' Harry said, grinning back.
'Hogwarts tomorrow,' Harry said.
'I know. I was just hoping you'd have some perspective.'
There is a chorus of cheers.  Harry's face hurts from smiling.
'You've been reading them?' Harry exclaimed.
“Fine, I’ll go first,” Harry said, rolling his eyes at Remus. Green flame roared as he tossed a handful of Floo powder into the fire, and taking a deep breath, he stepped through.
'Because I didn't want to turn him in!' Malfoy snaps.  'He saved my life, all right?'
Griphook stroked the blade's handle with his long fingers, the rubies glittering in his grasp. 'You intended for me to believe you would give it to me at once, when your true plan was to wait until it served your purposes to do so,' he corrected. 'To some, there is no difference, but I do not think you are one of those wizards, Harry Potter. The kind who, in the end, care not what happens to others, as long as it is on behalf of the greater good . . .'
“No, you couldn’t’ve,” Ron said. He sounded annoyed. “Harry, you can’t save everybody. And we’re just as good at defense as you are. Well, nearly, anyway. You couldn’t’ve done anything more than we did, or Snape did, or McGonagall—"
'Of course I know
'But it's
“No,” Harry yelped. “Not with—with anybody. I just think so. Maybe. I mean, I don’t know for sure, but I, I think so.”
"Precisely. Now are we going to do this or aren't we?" Giving Harry one last smirk, he shut his eyes with exaggerated care and extended his wand.
But from the look on Malfoy's face, he reckoned Malfoy knew that.
‘Really, Harry,’ Hermione said, in that firm, warm tone he’d started to think was a bit motherly.
He doesn't
“I know,” Harry said, although the image that came to mind first was not Draco, wand out to hex him, but Draco, sprawled on his bed, lips parted, practically waiting to be kissed. “I—I’m being careful.” He rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Like I said, I should’ve told you—"
Harry winced; he had no desire to pore over old Charms exams all day. 'I can't, I have to meet—' he began; he was about to say Ron, but at Hermione's look of fury, he swiftly changed his mind. 'Malfoy. We need to rearrange the Quidditch schedule.'
Ona raises an eyebrow at him.  'There are pictures in books, which is the route most wizards take to satisfy their curiosity.  Of course, you aren't most wizards.'
It took Harry several seconds to pull his eyes from the page to slowly look up at Draco. "It's a book on the history of the magical world. It's really interesting."
On some level, Harry couldn’t blame Draco; Harry, of all people, knew what it was like to be missing a father, and moreover, to feel stunned and betrayed to find out that his father wasn’t perfect. But everything Harry had said was true, and it chilled him to know that, despite all of Harry’s rationalizing to the contrary, Draco might still be the loyal son of whom Lucius could be proud.
The blonde was grinning wickedly. “Why, haven’t you heard about the new Dark Arts professor, Potter? Pity you haven’t got connections on the board.”
It was slow and strange, not like usual; they were swimming in shadows, Malfoy's hair a tickle against Harry's cheek, his breathing a quiet rasp in the silence. 'I like you like this,' Harry said, on impulse. Malfoy gave a little start but said nothing; he seemed to be waiting for Harry to direct them, simply sitting there, blinking at Harry in the gloom.
'Those were different circumstances,' Harry argued. 'I keep my promises. I swear I'll pay Gringotts back.'
'You should sleep,' Harry said, clambering onto the bed beside Malfoy, who gave him an irritated look but did not shove him off. 'I'll just, um, be here. Don't mind me. Go to sleep.'
Across the room, he sees Ginny giving him a pointed wave, her other hand on her hip. It’s a pose reminiscent of Molly Weasley, which makes Harry feel a wave of affection for both of them, though he knows if he ever made the comparison to her face he’d be sleeping on the couch for a week. As it is, her eyes are hard, watching him with Malfoy. He knows they’ll fight about it when they get home, whispering so the kids don’t wake, and then he’ll draw her a bath with the fluorescent pink Drooble’s Bubbling Bathtime Solution that George gifted them as a joke last Christmas, and she’ll snort and have no choice but to forgive him.
‘Do you ever wish,’ Harry says once to Hermione, when she’s sleeping in their guest room after a fight with Ron, and Ginny’s off to Europe with the Harpies for a series of exhibition games. ‘I mean. Do you ever think that if we had parents, things might have turned out differently?’
Harry waited until Ron’s head disappeared from the flames before he stood up and faced the stairs, arms folded. Sure enough, after a moment, Draco appeared from the shadows, one eyebrow raised. Harry scowled at him. “You were listening.”
” Malfoy said, scrambling to his feet. “Now piss off, Potter. We don’t need the likes of you lurking around here.”
“Yeah, well, I had a lot of time in the hospital wing to think,” Ron reddened. “Anyway, we ought to keep our eyes out for anybody who might be the spy. Do you think it could be Malfoy?”
"Lord, listen to yourself," Malfoy drawled, sounding precariously close to boredom. "Stop being ridiculous.”
Harry thought, for the briefest of instants, that maybe Remus was staying because he was the spy. Then he shook it off. How dare he accuse Remus,
“I never agreed to that,” said Malfoy sharply, though there may have been a glint of admiration in his eyes. “Well, what is it, Potter, want me to fix the next Quidditch game? Want the answers to the next Potions exam? Maybe an apology for your little Mudblood friend—"
“Can’t what?” Draco looked at him strangely. “If you have a problem with kissing—"
Malfoy, Harry could see plainly, didn’t have an answer to that one.
The thought made him strangely gloomy.
Malfoy laughed so hard he almost knocked over the wine himself. Dinner was better after that.
Mrs. Black sounded pleased as she purred, “And darling Bella? She was always my favorite. How
'What's your favorite color?'
But Dumbledore stood up and smiled. “The Fidelius Charm, of course,” he clarified, as behind him a few portraits nodded their heads in approval. “They will need to go somewhere that nobody can find them. And for that, they will need a Secret Keeper.”
'Disgusting,' Malfoy commented beside him. 'A Hufflepuff House Cup? Ravenclaw I can stand, but Hufflepuff? The thought of the Great Hall bedecked in black and yellow is enough to make me vomit.'
'Our unfortunate habit of meeting here.'
'Fantastic,' Ron and Malfoy mutter in unison.  They glare at each other.
. You’re nobody. You don’t deserve my fucking touch, Malfoy. You don’t even deserve me looking at you.”
. I meant about the DA. Some of us can already produce Patronuses. We did all kinds of defense spells last year. They’ll be so far behind, won’t they hold us back?”
'Is that so, Mr. Malfoy?' she inquired, sharp amusement in her tone when he leapt back from Penelope as if caught at something far more forbidden. 'I recall hearing the same statement just after I gave you a D on your human transfiguration essay. I do hope Professor Clearwater is having better success.'
, Potter,' he insists, when Harry gives him a suspicious look.  'But he's sworn to protect me.  He swore an Unbreakable and if he doesn't, he dies.  I can get him to come to me.'
you?” But before he could speak, she continued on, “Mrs. Weasley’s just told us, I’m so sorry about your cousin. I know you didn’t like him much, and he seemed like a horrible, horrible boy, but it’s awful, isn’t it?”
Harry snorted. 'You mean like you two had me doing, a month or two ago?'
'In other words, you want to assuage your guilt,' Malfoy said sharply. 'Do you think it's going to make you feel any better, is that what this is, you dogging me everywhere?'
Demelza got first pick, Malfoy second, Harry third, Owen fourth. To Harry's shock, Demelza immediately shouted, 'Ginny Weasley, Chaser!' She gave Harry a wink as Ginny trotted up to them.
'I mean it,' Harry said. 'Thanks.'
“If there is, he didn’t tell me,” Harry said bitterly, finally finding something to take his mind off the previous night. “It’s all ‘Keep an eye out’ and ‘Work hard’ and ‘Practice your Occlumency,’ like that’s all there is to worry about! Something’s got to be going on; you heard them all summer, hiding behind doors.”
Harry's days were divided as they always were when Hermione and Ron were having a row; he ate meals with Ron and sat in the library with Hermione, flew with Ron and sat through Defense between the two of them. Ron's birthday had been the hardest, as he naturally felt Harry should spend the day with him, while Hermione insisted that everyone else would be celebrating Ron's birthday, and therefore, Harry should keep her company in the meantime. Each of them wanted his continual companionship, and he was actually relieved to catch a moment alone.
“It’s the principle,” Draco seethed. “Nott’s a traitor now—he’s never been much of a Slytherin, but now that he’s friends with Dumbledore’s favorite, now that he goes around with Harry Potter—"
Harry hadn't either.
She gave him a brief smile as she stubbed out her cigarette and stood, palms smoothing over her thighs. 'Thank you, Harry. For the house, too.'
"I was just," he began, and stopped. "Sorry. I'd thought—"
'Yes, yes,' Mrs. Weasley sniffled, 'that's fine, Ginny, dear.'
"That's hardly my fault, is it?"
Malfoy's eyebrows jumped. 'Are you mad? Right now?'
Hermione raised an eyebrow. 'A worthwhile use of your time, I'm sure. Oh, here, Andromeda, I'll take Teddy, I've missed him.'
"Forty two," Draco said. "Look, Potter, it's not unheard of, all right?"
'Oh yeah, he was the one who dated Ginny!'
"So eager to lose, are you?"
As the feast wound down, McGonagall directed the students to their respective houses, and the hall once again filled with students running every which way, Prefects yelling after them. For a brief second, it reminded Harry of the last battle, and he had to look away for a moment, the flames of the thousands of bobbing candles blurring in his vision.
Ron looked stricken at the possibility. “Blimey,” he said. “I’d never thought. Remind me to castrate Bill later, will you?”
'That's because I've changed the whole bottle to water,' Hermione whispers to Harry.  'They haven't noticed yet, I put a bit of flavoring in.  Oh, there's Professor Flitwick!  He must be here for Bill, he always said Bill was good at Charms.  Let's go say hello.'
Hermione gives a loud snort.  'It's because he made the deal with you, Harry,' she says in the long-suffering tone she uses when she has waited at least five minutes for Harry and Ron to figure out what she already knows.  'Not with me or with Ron, but with you.  And for all the things you are, Harry, you don't break your promises, not if you can help it.  Malfoy has to know that.'
“Since you’re offering so nicely,” Malfoy smirked back at him.
“Remus will be looking for us,” Harry gasped out as Draco wrenched at the button on his trousers.
Remus glanced across the room at Dumbledore. “I think we’ve established that you are not responsible for the acts that, under your appearance, someone else committed,” he said, to which Draco sneered. “Now, a few more. Did you have any idea that Tonks would try to pose as you?”
Harry took a step forward, prompting Malfoy to cross his arms over his skinny chest as if in protection; his nostrils flared like a nervous thestral. 'Malfoy,' Harry said. 'Come back to Hogwarts.'
'This one's fer Dumbledore,' Hagrid says, pushing Harry's glass of whisky towards him.
Harry stood there, Hedwig’s cage in one hand and his trunk at his side, feeling suddenly, bewilderingly alone. “I—no,” he said, “no, I don’t want to see him.”
Harry can hear Hermione and Ron laughing in the kitchen, cleaning up, and wishes he were in there with them.  'Malfoy is staying with us for awhile,' he says, careful on every word, as if saying them slowly will mean they are disconnected, separate from their meaning.  Neville, however, seems to gather their meaning without a problem.
'All right. Happy birthday, by the way.'
'Grimmauld Place it is, then,' Harry mutters, jerking his chair back and moving towards the door.  He can feel Ginny's eyes on him, but as painful as it is, he doesn't look up—just goes.
Malfoy to apologize.
Harry was torn between snorting in derision and kicking something in fury at the idea that he and Draco could be better off in love. He scowled. “Maybe I don’t want to,” he said. “Maybe I don’t care, maybe I want to stop caring about everybody, it hasn’t done me any good—"
onto the floor.  Harry isn't surprised to see a little cloud of dust rise up from the carpet.
In the first week, Malfoy runs into a suit of armor—'I swear it moved!' he yelps, when Harry finds him trapped beneath it—has two windows slam without warning on his fingers, and gets into a wrestling match with a wardrobe that tries to shut him inside.  To make matters worse, Ron amuses himself by agitating the bats until they fly at Malfoy's head.  Once they chase him out of the bath, clutching several towels around him and screaming.  Harry and Ron laugh so hard they almost choke.
that for a moment it was at Ron.
Harry blinked, his train of thought momentarily derailed. 'What? But you were jealous—with Hermione—'
'What are you doing here?'
'I can't—' Malfoy twists in his grasp, the muscles in his neck standing out as he wrenches his head back away from Harry, 'I don't know—'
Next to the table, there was a chair draped with Harry's dress robes from the previous night's Order of Merlin ceremony, and beside them on the floor, the sizeable velvet case containing his medal. Mrs. Weasley had seized Ron's with the aim of putting it in Gringotts at once, while the Ministry was keeping Hermione's safe until she returned from Australia.
'What did she ever do to you? Beat you at Quidditch, I suppose? Spill ink on you when we were first years?' Malfoy was funny with his grudges; he still hadn't forgiven Professor Flitwick for telling him he was mispronouncing his spells, back in second year, and he would often rattle off slights that fellow students had apparently done him, though to Harry most of them sounded like accidents and mistakes.
“Yeah,” Harry said, and from the way Cho stared at him in surprise, he knew she knew just what he meant. “It was a mistake.”
“I, but,” Harry said. “What happened to Tonks? I haven’t heard—and I’m not—"
Malfoy scoffed. 'Don't tell me you're waiting for a thank you card.'
? No, Potter, I'm not jealous of whichever poor girl has got your cock crammed down her throat.'
'You think the Death Eaters should walk free?' Doge said, his tone sharpening, as it had when he spoke to the Weasleys' Aunt Muriel at the wedding so long ago. Harry could just see the headline now: 'CHOSEN ONE' UNLEASHES FORMER DEATH EATERS ON HAPLESS CITIZENS! 'You think they deserve to live in the free and just society that we have all worked so hard to make and protect, that we fought for, while they worked to destroy it? The great Albus Dumbledore himself, whom we both so loved and revered, died to protect this world and those in it—'
The news had not made it in the Daily Prophet, of course, as Fudge seemed determined to strain out all relevant stories, but the Hogwarts rumor mill was running as usual. In the days after the attack, Harry heard from various sources that he had left Hogwarts to kill his aunt and uncle and finish the job he’d begun when he killed his cousin in July, that he had fought and killed a team of Aurors on the pretense they were all spies for Voldemort, and that he had been supporting an underground prostitution ring run by former professor Nymphadora Tonks. Harry could not decide which was the farthest from the truth.
Smiling, Harry did.
“You are here,” Snape said, his words careful, “because of a special exception from the Headmaster, and that is the only reason.” He scowled down at Harry. “There you have it, Potter: an exception made for you. Again.”
Malfoy turns his head towards the window, as if he looks hard enough, long enough, he will be able to see Azkaban.  'I know,' he mutters.  They both know that had he come to the Order, Lucius would have been safe.
'This isn't for the best!' Harry exploded. 'You don't know Draco, no one there did, they only heard the accusations, but I know better, I was there and I'll testify again, you have to give him another chance! You only heard one side of the story!'
'Yeah.'
“Stop it,” he said, almost sternly.
Dumbledore nodded solemnly, though his eyes still seemed to be smiling. “It’s very easy to love those who are similar to ourselves, Harry,” he said. “The challenge is to reach out to those who are not. I believe Hermione Granger has been a wonderful proponent of House unity. She is not wrong to think that together, even with our differences, we are stronger than we are apart.”
'Thought I needed a hero—'
“I think,” he said, and felt his throat close up unexpectedly. He hadn’t realized he was this nervous. “Um, I’m, I think I’m. Gay.”
Harry stepped forward, hoping that Dumbledore would take him aside and tell him why Snape had gone—had Voldemort called the Death Eaters to him? was Snape on a spying mission?—but before he could even speak, Dumbledore had winked at him and disappeared back inside Snape’s classroom with a click of the door. He looked at Hermione, bewildered. The Slytherins appeared equally confused, though Pansy seemed even more distraught.
The shock of the spell, coupled with the split second of lightning bolt pain, sent Harry stumbling backwards. He shook it off an instant later, however, and the tumult of emotions on Malfoy's face told him everything.
Any teasing Ron might have been about to give him was forgotten, as he snorted, “Oh, once Hermione
'Sorry, sir,' Dobby says, his bat-like ears drooping.  'But Harry Potter, the Secret Keeper is Professor Dumbledore himself, sir!'
'About Slytherin!' Hermione whispered. 'They probably just don't want to come back because they don't think they're welcome, but if we talked to some of them, convinced them that if they don't return, Slytherin will close—'
Harry didn't know.
Of all things, Pansy Parkinson's words flooded back to Harry, and he thought, startled, that he wasn't all that nice. He was good, and brave, but perhaps Pansy was right, he had never been nice.
He'd taken the mirror with him.
Harry gave Ron what he hoped was a telling look. “You mean you didn’t want her to come?”
THE END OF AN ERA: OLD FAMILY MEETS BLOODY DEMISE
"Sometimes," Hermione says, voice a quiet wisp of regret. "I try not to think about it very often."
So he doesn't tell Hermione.
'Fine, but not any more than anybody else, he's just an annoying little nuisance—'
happy, aren't they? And they went through the war together, too!'
“Don’t you dare—"
He felt someone touch his arm and looked up in surprise to see Hermione. When she pulled him away from them, he didn't resist.
'Yeah,' Harry said. 'Yeah, um, I'd like that. Gawain Robards, Mr. Robards, he said they'd take me if I came with the right N.E.W.T.s.'
For a cold moment, Harry realized that in all that had happened, he’d forgotten about Draco’s mother. Challenge momentarily forgotten, he asked, “Your mother?”
Malfoy blinked a couple times.
Hermione flashed him a knowing smile and Ron mimed vomiting behind a tapestry of angry trolls. Harry gave him an answering shove in the back and they went off laughing.
It wasn't that it was a particularly long kiss; Draco was hesitant, as if afraid that at any moment Harry would jump away. Harry himself was in too much of a stupor to do much more than splutter in his mind, so by the time he came to his senses, he had somehow moved from lying on his stomach to lying on his back, and Draco was kissing him again. His mind told him, as if his body was on autopilot, that he was kissing Draco back.
Besides, the Ministry had raided the Malfoys’ house for Dark artifacts, hadn’t they?
“Well, there’s nothing you can do about it now,” Ron snapped.
'Don't,' he says, now thoroughly embarrassed.  'I know.'
It's not until he's on the stairs that he feels the tears in his eyes.
'You GAVE HIM his WAND?' Neville shouts.
'Rolf's?'
Jimmy blushed. 'Oh, well, that's only because I wanted to be on Demelza's. You know. I thought she might give me a chance then. Brilliant girl, isn't she?'
'I wouldn't even feed that to you,' Harry says to Hedwig, who hoots and flutters over.  'All right, all right, here.'  She takes the pieces of toast he feeds to her and nibbles at his ear affectionately when she's done.
'I thought that would be us,' he said finally.
Hermione had reddened. “It’s just a silly charm Ginny taught me,” she explained. “It tells you how much something’s worth based on the materials it’s made of, things like that. It doesn’t account for the work put into it, of course, but it gives you a general idea. It’s useful for shopping, whether or not something’s a fair price or utterly outrageous.”
'Poor Slytherin, the outcast house,' Malfoy said sneeringly.
,’ Hermione said, and he knew that, but he did.
Harry said, after a moment, “Draco. Thanks.”
Harry blinked. 'I was supposed to know?'
'About nothing, Potter.' When Harry only waited, Malfoy sighed loudly. 'Asking where you were, why you weren't at school, I don't know! They weren't real letters, all right? Shut up about it.'
'Shh!' Ron hisses, glowering at her.  'Now Malfoy knows!  He'll tell everybody!'
Pansy and Daphne eyed him skeptically.
'Shut up, Malfoy,' Harry snaps.  'Before he died, Dumbledore offered Malfoy protection for himself and his family.  I—I have to follow through.  It's what Dumbledore wanted.'
'I don't want much to do with girls right now,' Harry scowled.
'We're drinking
'The truth comes out,' Malfoy said, nodding. 'Harry Potter, savior of the world, can't spare a hand to guide a slightly tipsy Slytherin.'
'You don't understand,' Malfoy snarled. 'You were never a Slytherin, and on top of it, you're the great Harry Potter, everyone was tripping over themselves to be your friend from the instant you got to Hogwarts!'
She looked thoughtful. “Well, it’s hard to say, isn’t it? Some of them disguise themselves very well. There are some spells you can use to test it, but they’re rather delicate. It depends how evil they are, too. Haven’t you been listening in Defense? Some things are outside the Ministry classification, but some still think of them as Dark magic. And, well, some of them, made of bones and human hands and things, it’s rather easy to surmise, wouldn’t you say?”
'Yeah, I recognize it.  But what do we do with it?'  Harry dangles the locket between his fingers.  'When Dumbledore destroyed the ring, he ended up with his one hand all blackened—you all saw it—'
or something of the sort.  It seemed like divination rubbish, but it might have something of use.  And keep me updated on what you figure out, I'll want to know—'
'Yes, in the head,' said Harry, snickering, and Malfoy made a face at him, because they both had the maturity of first-years. Elladora gave them a look that said exactly that.
'Do you want to be a dragon tamer?' The look on Malfoy's face was priceless. 'Um, I don't know, a cursebreaker? Er, the Minister of Magic? A professor?' With each suggestion, Malfoy's expression grew more and more incredulous.
'I did as much to Kreacher, two years ago,' Harry retorted. For a brief second, he thought to himself that perhaps Malfoy would make a good Unspeakable after all. That was, if he lived that long. 'Anyhow, Hermione, you can tell me now, right? The spell's wore off?'
They practice dueling during the first DA meeting at 12 Grimmauld Place.  To his surprise, a tall, freckled girl shows up with Cho Chang in tow, and both of them confer in whispers in the corner while Ron sends them suspicious looks.
that?"
'I didn't say that,' Harry muttered. 'Besides, Ron, Robards mentioned you. Said he'd take all of us if we got the required N.E.W.T.s. You, too, Hermione.'
'Wait,' Harry said, laughing. 'Where are you always running off to these days? I know it's N.E.W.T. year, but this seems more like SPEW. Don't tell me you're starting a support group for lonely Slytherins or something.'
Not being in the mood to retort, Harry gave up asking, stopped Draco from talking with his mouth, and slid one hand down over his ribs and into his pyjama bottoms. Draco hissed sharply.
"Oh, yeah? I know that that curse you just used is an Unforgivable Curse. I know that I could tell the Ministry and they'd have proof from your wand in no time. You must really want to see your dad again? Miss him enough to go to Azkaban for him? Oh wait, I forgot, your dad’s not there. Well, I suppose you’d just have to wait for him, keep his cell warm."
Harry nodded, despite an odd reluctance, which he thought Hermione could sense. It wasn’t that he was protecting Malfoy. Why would he want to protect someone who was supporting Voldemort? But ever since he’d seen Malfoy slump out of Tonks’s rooms, cringing away from Moody, he’d felt—
'Fire,' Harry says.
Harry glared at the floor. “I don’t see what love has to do with that,” he insisted stubbornly.
“H-harder,” Draco muttered, tearing his mouth away from Harry’s, and he sounded irritated at having to say it at all, embarrassed even in the darkness between them. Harry thought it endearing, amusing, and incredibly hot.
“A friend?” Hermione echoed again, alarmed. “Hagrid, I’m not so sure it’s the best idea to bring another giant here, especially not—well, you said yourself, they’re not exactly friendly, are they?”
“I know,” Harry said, but he didn’t look at Ron.
'Well, I'm not on
"Coming," Harry yelled back, stuffing his feet in his trainers without unlacing them. The back of one was crammed under his heel, and he wriggled his foot until it slipped on. He reached for his robes just as Draco stood up, startlingly close, and put a hand on his shoulder.
January hurried by that year, blustery and wet, and by the time February crept in, the talk of the entire school was on Slughorn's Valentine's party and the Hogsmeade weekend that followed. Harry had invitations from ten girls before he could even think about asking someone. He began to explain that he had decided to go alone, though this only made it worse; everyone, including Professor Slughorn himself, seemed to have an opinion on whom Harry should take instead.
'You-Know-Who!' Ron insists.
Hermione seized Harry by the arm at once and hissed, 'Go after her!'
'You didn't have to do that,' Malfoy drawled reluctantly. His eyes were sharp and gray in the hallway.
Harry wasn’t sure if he was relieved or not.
'Excuse me,' Malfoy interrupts.  'You are talking about my father.  I am standing right in front of you.'
Ginny raised an eyebrow; she still looked a mix between hurt and amused. 'So they get all the, the war stuff, and all of that, and I get your sexual crises—'
Draco just looked at him.
The remainder of the summer passed without further excitement, the greatest agitation being the flurry of Doxies that had re-colonized the curtains, and the heat wave slowly subsided into hints of autumn coming, crickets all night during their weekend at the Burrow, some night breezes propelling the windows shut. Hermione managed to ignore Ron for five days, during which she furiously knitted eleven hats, and then for no visible reason gave him a sudden embarrassed hug after he got his OWLs and began talking to him again.
“Hermione’s the best witch in the school,” Harry hissed right back. “She’s better at everything than you, so I don’t see how pure blood has anything to do with it.”
The room it provided was nothing that Harry had ever seen, but he liked its peaceful atmosphere; it was full of armchairs, and the windows were made of stained glass, though he couldn't tell what the pictures were supposed to portray. The early morning light through the glass cast a wash of green across Malfoy's face and Harry thought of the Slytherin lake water light, and simultaneously the long shadows and secret rooms of 12 Grimmauld Place.
“You think you can best me?” he hissed, taking a step forward. “After all this time, do you think you can possibly be better than me? You’re nothing, Malfoy. You’ll never be anything. You’re pathetic—just like your dad—"
'I don't know,' Harry said, embarrassed. 'How should I know what you, you're interested in?'
'The Astronomy Tower, huh?' he said casually.
'You're the best Transfiguration professor we've ever had,' Malfoy was saying sycophantically; unlucky for him, Professor McGonagall passed by at that very moment.
“We do so have windows,” Draco retorted. “And anyway, what gives you the right to take over
'If you need to contact me,' Harry repeated. 'Look, Malfoy, if I had used this mirror the way it was meant to be used, my godfather might still be alive. Just keep it, will you?'
Malfoy led Harry through the hallway lined with portraits, all of whom whispered and pointed, and down another hall whose marble floors were so polished that Harry could almost see his reflection. He expected to go to the drawing room he remembered, or the study where they had had their firechat, but Malfoy headed to a smaller room, papered in a blue and gold pattern that reminded Harry of peacocks. A small but merry fire was going in the little fireplace, and the diamond-paned windows were polished to a gleam. A large white quill hovered above the desk and its clutter of papers, as if awaiting orders; Malfoy waved his hand and it whisked itself into a drawer.
“Well, it’s probably infested with fleas now,” Draco muttered.
“Um,” Harry said, “Tonks, I’m not sure I—" and then there were footsteps and a sudden flaring of the gloomy lights along the hall, and he was being smothered in Hermione’s hair. She smelled like dust and lilacs and sniffed a little when she pulled away from him, saying like a copy of Mrs. Weasley, “Oh, Harry, you feel thin, haven’t you been eating?” Behind her, Ron was standing with his hands in his trouser pockets, lanky and uncomfortable, and when Harry looked up at him, he flashed Harry such a familiar grin that all the knots in Harry’s stomach pooled and dissolved.
The train's last whistle sounded, and Ginny said in the following silence, 'Oh, this is stupid.' She gave Harry an impish smile, stood up, and plopped down on his lap.
“He is his own person,” Harry said hotly. He couldn’t believe this was the second time he had to defend Draco in less than twenty four hours.
me, and he died.” Harry’s eyes burned. “And if I hadn’t been so stupid, Sirius wouldn’t have—"
The kitchen of the Burrow is exactly how Harry remembers it, with several pans undergoing a vigorous scrubbing in the sink, and the teakettle heating up on the stove.  Harry catches sight of a bowl full of peas, which are dutifully shelling themselves into a pot, both sitting on the countertop next to an open cookbook.  Mrs. Weasley's wand rests between the pages.
“Absolutely nutters, that one,” Ron muttered to Harry, a moment later, as they followed her down the hall.
Remus stirred his tea, sipped, and calmly set it back on the table. “This has given you a lot to think about,” he said. “Not everything is as simple as it seems. Not all our enemies are hooded figures who hate Muggles, are they?”
“I didn’t forget who he was,” Harry muttered, drawn into conversation despite himself. “I just—"
Though Harry wandered after Remus, Draco seemed more caught up in investigating the contents of the room. He ran a thin finger across the surface of the clock, dragging dust with him, and it made him sneeze. Harry smiled and left him to it.
Harry left school, and so did Malfoy. Harry joined Auror training, and Ron didn’t. He did meet Harry and Hermione for drinks, though, every Friday near the Ministry. Harry never asked exactly how they’d made up, but the world slowly recalibrated, as if the past year had never happened. Some days Ginny even came along, smiling at Harry like she too wanted to put Hogwarts behind them, and one day it felt as routine as breathing for Harry to go home with her to the Burrow, to stay as close as possible to her loud laughter and the firelight glimmering on her hair, instead of his cold, empty flat.
'He said,' Harry mutters, the solid anger he had felt only a moment ago dissolving rapidly into something slipperier, 'he said he could bring Snape to us.'
, just as Terry Boot cursed him from the other side, and he was left as rigid as a mummy, covered in boils. Harry couldn’t help covering a laugh.
Madam Pomfrey was in a near-frantic state when Harry and Hermione peeked their heads in the door, and she motioned them quickly into the room. “He’s in the bed by the window,” she said briskly, arms full of several glass bottles and a roll of bandages. “Don’t be long, now, it’s getting late,” and she bustled off to tend to a still-unconscious seventh year with a bad burn mark on her face.
Pulling it out, frowning at its knobbly shape, Harry climbed onto his bed and pulled the curtains. Were coins shaped like this? Sitting cross-legged, he whispered, “
When Harry finally opened his eyes, he saw Malfoy wiping his hand on the ground, the expression on his face unreadable. A slow flush was rising in Harry's face, his clothes were in sweaty disarray, and for all the times he had been caught unprepared in Potions or covered in Stinksap, Harry didn't think he had ever been more embarrassed. The loud zip when he did up his trousers sounded somehow obscene.
Ron stared at him. “Harry—you don’t have to—"
Malfoy's mouth went thin. 'See you.'
Nothing more than that.
“Ah,” Dumbledore repeated. After a moment, he said, “I’m pleased to hear it.”
Halfway through the afternoon, the remaining guests began to arrive for what Mrs. Weasley had promised would be a modest party. She was the first, with Ginny in tow, but Harry barely had a minute to greet them before Hagrid appeared in the door, sporting his great coat even in the summer heat.
Harry thinks of Ron’s frank, sorry frown in the warm light of their favorite pub, years ago now.
Harry thought of Malfoy's pale, drawn face as he emerged from talking to Phineas. He looked down. 'Remus said something to me once,' Harry said. 'It was after he died—'
'Right,' Harry says, 'I wasn't going to—'
'I do mean it,' Malfoy said irritably as he retrieved his wand. 'Why would I be doing the spell if I didn't mean it?'
“Shall I wait outside?”
When he got home, Harry began to re-pack his trunk in preparation for returning to Hogwarts the next day. He was juggling a stack of Martin Miggs the Mad Muggle comics Ron had lent him, and a very worn copy of
Tonks looked shocked for a moment, and her eyes shifted away uncomfortably, but after a moment she looked back at him again. “Been doing your research, have you?” Tonks said appraisingly. “I’ll bet Hermione helped you there.”
Harry sighed; the clock did, in fact, read half past ten, which was far later than he’d realized. “I suppose we should go,” he said.
'Can you trust any of these people?  Can you trust Kevin Entwhistle?'
A moment later, the office was empty, and the only sign anything had been amiss was a pile of notecards on the floor.
He was walking back from the library with Ron one evening—they had left Hermione behind, poring over her notes for the fifth time—when Ron gave a start. ''S cold,' he muttered. 'Wait a second—'
He wanted this.
From the other room, Harry could hear Teddy gurgling. He couldn't imagine Remus on a broom, and anyone who met Tonks knew she was dead clumsy on her best days. Still, when Teddy was old enough to walk, Harry planned to take him to as many Quidditch matches as Andromeda would allow.
'It's a good idea,' Harry says.  'I just don't know if she'll talk to us.'
"Potter. What are you reading?"
'Oh,' Malfoy says.  His head tips back a little, a bit closer to Harry's shoulder.  Harry lets it hover there for half a minute, then shoves to his feet.
'Something like that.' Ron scowled at the sight of Charlie, evidently reminded of his argument with Hermione.
'Oh, who cares,' Ron said. 'You-Know-Who is gone, Hermione. We don't have to worry about it anymore! Besides, you don't see anyone else caring, do you?'
' Malfoy shouted, catching Harry entirely off guard as memories swarmed him: Hermione was prodding an unappetizing lump of fish in the tent . . . he was lowering Dobby's small body into the dirt . . . Sirius arcing backwards and then Dumblefore, his body in an identical curve, poised in the air for a bare second before falling out of sight . . .
'I'm not giving up my wand,' Malfoy says sharply.
'It isn't!'
"Everybody just can't wait to have a piece of the fun," Draco hissed, "they've been waiting centuries to see the Malfoy family taken down, don't you get it? I bet the whole Ministry is laughing about it, bet they couldn't wait to raid the Manor; I'm sure old Fudge gets a good chuckle out of locking up all our wealth and saying he's preserving it, doesn't he? Well, I—"
Harry stared. “Conflicted? Malfoy, you were
“We’re practicing Defense!”
'You like him,' Harry said sourly. 'You're acting like it well enough.'
'You don't understand,' Malfoy said disgustedly.
“Well, good night,” Harry said abruptly to Ron, when they climbed into bed. He tried not to hear the hurt in Ron’s voice when he said good night, tried not to think about how Hermione might be whispering about him right now, telling Ginny how worried she’d become.
Only Malfoy.
And Harry had not stopped, even when Dumbledore had begged . . . he had gone on tipping the potion down Dumbledore's throat, promising him relief with each new cup . . .
Ginny rolled her eyes. “If you’re worried that I know about you and Hermione, Charlie saw you kissing on the stairway the day before he left, didn’t he say anything? That’s why he kept giving you funny looks and chuckling at dinner.”
Harry, for his part, glances furtively over at Cho, though she is now shielded by the tall girl she came with, Katie Bell, either Parvati or Padma—he can't tell—and Ginny.  He makes an exasperated noise.  'Aren't there other Ravenclaws we can ask?  I mean, there's Luna, isn't there—'
'Dunno.'  Harry shrugs.  'Hermione?'
“I wanted out,” Tonks said, not looking at him. Her eyes were glassy with what could only be the beginnings of tears, and that made Harry angrier than anything else: that after this, she could still want to cry about it, that she was guilty enough to do so. Part of him wanted her to try and hex him again, to praise Voldemort in front of him. It would be easier, he thought.
“Are you going to tell me something?”
Harry swallowed and something in his throat stuck. 'It's different,' he said with difficulty. 'I don't mean it like, like whatever it takes is necessary. I don't think people are expendable, or that they're—that their lives don't matter!'
And yet Malfoy was nobody like Ron or Hermione, someone whose death would tear out his stomach, the empty open wound he'd felt gaping inside after Dobby had taken the knife on his behalf. All at once they all came back to him, Sirius and then Dumbledore's crumpled body, even Hedwig, he had not even had time to look at her before the jet of light hit her . . . and Moody, who had died protecting him, as they all had . . .
'That was different,' Harry said hastily. 'I don't—I thought he was up to something, and I was right, I never cared about his breakfast, okay?'
'I was sorry about that,' Narcissa murmured, glancing over her shoulder at Harry, who scowled right back. 'When he died. I told Bella, I told her—'
'I'd rather help defeat He Who Must Not Be Named than revise for N.E.W.T.s anyway,' Ernie Macmillan announces, rising from his seat and straightening his robes pompously.  He gives a nod in Harry's direction.  'Why, this is—this is important work!'
Hermione makes a little sound in the back of her throat.  'That's what I mean, Ron,' she says.  'Harry has changed his mind, only the other way around.  Harry, Snape isn't the reason you're keeping Malfoy here.  He's here, we've all accepted that by now, and—'
Harry exclaimed, forgetting to be quiet, “
“Not very many people have been around,” Hermione explained, looking sadly at the empty common room. “Ginny and Dean are somewhere, Dean’s still—really upset—I know all the third years are sad about Dennis, they keep bursting into tears all over the place.” She looked both anxious for their sakes and annoyed. “Poor Ginny, both Dean and Colin need her, and she’s hardly had a moment to herself.”
'Being on Voldemort's side wouldn't have saved you,' Harry says quietly.
“Cho’s a good player,” Harry said honestly, though he had to agree that Ravenclaw had been looking at a fairly sure loss to Slytherin when the match had been halted, even with all of Slytherin’s fouls. “It was a pretty good match, too.”
'I don't believe you,' Malfoy says. 'You're lying.'
Sounding, if possible, even more skeptical, Draco said, “It’s some Muggle contraption, isn’t it, Potter? I don’t trust it. Is this what you wanted to show me? Because I’m certainly not impressed—"
!' she exclaimed, dumping a leather-bound text that had to be at least two thousand pages thick onto the table. Both Harry and Ron stared up at her.
Harry flushed. “I just thought—"
Pansy was rolling her hips in Malfoy’s hands and sliding up against him, whatever scanty scrap of fabric she was wearing slipping upwards to bare her stomach. Malfoy had his head tilted back, hair damp with sweat and falling in his face, and he was staring right at Harry, as if there were no one else in the club but the two of them.
It was almost a relief when Draco Malfoy found him in the hall after Charms and punched him in the mouth.
'You're such a prat, Malfoy,' Harry said, annoyed despite himself.
His heart was still thundering but he felt deflated. 'I don't—do you really think it'll make a difference? Going to Doge?'
“I’m not worried about Malfoy,” Hermione informed him. “I’m worried about you. I don’t want you to get hurt.”
'It's not a contest!' Harry yelled after him as Malfoy departed for another seat across the aisle. The worst part was, Harry was still turned on, and his cock was rubbing against the seam of his jeans in a most distracting manner. And all he could think about was seizing Malfoy by the ear, dragging him into the hall, and thrusting up against him, Ginny be damned.
Malfoy's eyes snapped open and they flicked immediately to Harry. 'Potter? What are you doing here?'
'Well, I don't think that justifies treating him as an, an object,' Ginny said, her voice shrill. 'For your gratification. It's sick and it's not. It's not nice.'
His eyes fell on
Ron looked at Harry and said, flat-out, 'Are you really sure he's worth all this trouble, mate?'
'Be careful!' Mrs. Weasley shouted after them, giving Harry one last squeeze around the shoulders. 'Ginny, owl us straightaway when you get to Hogwarts!'
with us,' Malfoy drawled.
“Come on, Harry,” he said, rubbing his face wearily, “we’ve got to get out of here.”
'Well,' Harry said, then took a deep breath. Wasn't Hermione always telling him he was too stubborn by far? 'I'm sorry too. For, for not being nice.'
“Professor McGonagall, considering the safety of students off school grounds, decided it would be a good idea to split the third-years into groups and have each Prefect take them to Hogsmeade for the first weekend, as they haven’t ever been,” Hermione explained. “Oh, Ron, it’s not so bad. Isn’t everyone’s safety more important than a little fun?”
“Well, Theodore Nott.”
'Yeah, well, McGonagall wanted Bill,' he shrugged, removing both Ginny and his cloak. 'He was Head Boy and all, got all the N.E.W.T.s, you know. But with Fleur and the baby on the way, he couldn't. I'd planned on heading straight back to Romania, but she made a good case—do it for Hogwarts, only a year, good pay, all that. I'm closer to Mum and Dad this way, too, and can look out for you lot.'
'I am,' Harry says.  'But this is your only chance.  I mean it, Malfoy.  This isn't Hogwarts.'
'I haven't done a thing,' Harry exclaimed. 'Well, the bruise is possibly my fault, I did let him walk into that wall . . .'
'But Hermione slapped him,' Ron remembers, sunning in the memory.  'Anyway, maybe it was your Furnunculus Curse on the train in fourth year—after all, I went with Tarantallegra—boils was like going easy on him—'
Harry stared; he thought Malfoy would be angry no matter the outcome, but now he remembered the blind fear in Malfoy's eyes as they'd raced by in Hogwarts, and the way his mum had whispered his name with her fingers trembling over Harry's pulse. Perhaps Malfoy knew now that there were much worse things than prison.
Draco screamed, then, dropping to his knees, and contorted so awfully that Harry was afraid his limbs were going to wrench apart; his face was twisted up in pain and, even after Harry stopped the spell, he curled around himself, what appeared to be tears squeezing out of his eyes, which were still clenched shut. He looked like a child, lying there, unmoving.
‘Why here?’
, and he didn’t know he was coming until he was and was and.
Flustered, Harry tried to manage an excuse, but at that moment, Ron bounded up to them. “Harry!” he exclaimed, latching onto Harry’s shoulder and leaning into him heavily. “Harry, there’s this girl, you’ve got to meet her, she really wants to—Harry, is that lipstick on your face?”
Hermione shrugs.  'I wasn't.  If we want him on our side, we have to get him to want it, too.  You boys, all you think about is violence and humiliation.'
Harry pushes, "But that's why all you
Harry thought of the witch beside him who had seized him by the arm and shuddered. 'No,' he said. 'I don't, I don't want to go to every trial and sit there and judge people and have to
“Potter, what—"
Ordinarily, Harry would be too incensed to care what had been said except for Ron's name, because when it came from Malfoy, it was never good. Still, the look of outrage on Malfoy's face made him burst into low laughter.
'Sharing body heat,' he says, and tries not to snicker at how scandalized Malfoy sounds.
“It’s against the law,” Ron said faintly.
'He has a name!'
Inside, Slughorn spotted him at once, pushing through the crowds to grasp him by the hand. 'Harry, Harry, my boy!' Slughorn greeted him jovially. 'So good to see you, so pleased you could come! After all those practices that kept you away in sixth year, and of course, your string of detentions—'
'She's doing fine.' Parvati smiled. 'I told her I'd owl her at once, I'll say hello for you.'
He sleeps a lot. He never dreams, though, nothing substantial. When he remembers anything, it is just shapes and color. Paint.
, Harry thought furiously at himself as Ron yawned and stretched.
January was winding down when he finally escaped to the Room of Requirement on a Friday evening, giving Ron and Hermione time to themselves. Yet once he got there, he didn’t feel like doing much of anything; even the lengthy essay Professor Kothari had assigned them on healing potions could not motivate him. It was a relief to finally be alone. He sat by the window instead, gazing out at the dimming sky, as his thoughts drifted . . . Colin had accosted him at dinner and poured out so many childhood stories about Dennis that he’d let his food get cold . . . Hermione was going spare about her Apparation test and would not stop dispensing random facts about Apparation accidents that she’d found doing unnecessary research . . . it had been less than three weeks since he had been here, in this very room, with Draco . . .
Harry's mouth quirked. 'It's fine, Ron,' he said.
"Well, yeah, but Hermione’s dating Anthony Goldstein now, she’s with him for the hols—"
But to Harry's dismay, Malfoy decides that Harry is the most likely ally of the three of them and promptly attaches himself.  He takes to following Harry around 12 Grimmauld Place, complaining from everything about rust in the water to the size of Ron's ears.  'I've been wearing the same shirt for three days, Potter,' he says petulantly one afternoon, trailing Harry down the stairs to the sitting room where Harry left a book.
The package contained a polyester tie—a considerable step up, for the Dursleys—and half a melted chocolate bar, undoubtedly Dudley's contribution.
He swallowed hard. How dare he? Who was Malfoy to say? There he was, distracting Harry, making him focus on dancing and Tonks and the way he'd looked in the pulsing lights, pale and thin and glistening with a sheen of sweat, his gazed fixed furiously on Harry . . .
'But my father—'
It was all Harry could do to sit up, his cock throbbing; he felt feverish, flushed and shivering both; the palms of his hands on the map were sticky with sweat, and he looked down in a daze at the little dots, the letters spelling out GINNY WEASLEY, which did not seem quite as important any longer—
'I am
Harry glances away from the way Lucius is curled in on himself.  It is all too easy to imagine this thin, haggard body as Sirius, and if Harry feels horror and sympathy for Sirius in these conditions, he might as well feel—
Harry shuts his eyes and thinks of the tower, and how he only realized how thin and skeletal Dumbledore looked in the moment that he toppled over the ramparts and fell out of sight.  He thinks of how fragile Malfoy's arms felt outside Azkaban, on the cliff, crushed into Harry's ribs.  He thinks of Malfoy's wand hand trembling.
He might be able to keep Voldemort out of his dreams with practice, but nothing kept out the nightmares.
Hermione flushed, apologetic, but Harry was embarrassed himself: he had lent Malfoy money to buy quills, and he hadn’t even got any for Ron. “I would buy you quills, Ron,” he said, quietly.
dog?”
,' Hermione said behind them, startling Malfoy so much that he toppled onto the floor with a squeak.
Ginny rolls her eyes.  'Spain peaked half a decade ago.  Charlie'd know that if he stopped to think.  He's just got a soft spot for them because they were his team, back when he was at school.  He pays more attention to dragons than broomsticks, these days.'
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Oh, please, Potter. You aren’t seriously running off to Wales.”
When he finally got to the door, Harry was breathing hard; his stomach felt like it was deflating, curling in on itself. The witch's words were ringing in his ears.
The corner of Tonks’s mouth twitched a little, and she said, with a regretful look in her eyes, “Me too, Harry.”
“Who do you think you would have believed?”
"Such as?"
Ron snorted. 'You want to spend the rest of your life eating cold fish in the Forest of Dean?'
And maybe he did love him, and what did it matter. Or maybe he didn’t, after all. What could he have known of love, in five short months of too many shadows and sidelong glances that never said enough?
As if on cue, Hermione's voice rang out behind them. 'Oh, Harry, you're featured in
And, after all, there were only six students in the classroom.
He could live with that.
'Oh, go there a lot, do you?' Malfoy drawled. He sounded downright sour.
'Night, Hermione,' Harry said. Malfoy elbowed him sharply in that region just below his underarm, where it hurt so much he almost shouted, but he did manage to knee Malfoy in the stomach before rolling over with his back to Malfoy again.
The rest of their shopping went by without a hitch, and by the time they arrived back at the Burrow, they were too exhausted to make the last Apparition to 12 Grimmauld Place. Ron turned on a Quidditch match on the wireless while Mrs. Weasley bustled around the kitchen, reminding Harry suddenly of Kreacher at his most attentive, multiple pots of food and chopping knives at his command. 'It smells great, Mrs. Weasley,' he said, and she came right over to him and gave him a fond kiss on the forehead. It had been months, and still people hugged one another too long before leaving, or urgently whispered, 'Keep safe,' before realizing there was no longer the same danger.
'At times?' Harry grinned.
Draco gave him an annoyed look. “Potter,” he said. “Why do you think I didn’t stay at Pansy’s? Her parents think she should spend less time with me. It’s a sentiment most Pureblood families share.”
'Some friends you have, Potter,' Malfoy mumbles beside him.  He jerks his arm experimentally, twisting against the wall.
“What?” Harry exclaimed, too shocked to keep his voice down. “But why? He’s already acknowledged that Voldemort is back, all the Prophet prints are letters from people who say they’ve seen him, and now he doesn’t want anyone to know?”
'You wouldn't if you
It's not as if he's blind to the headlines in the
“She’s at the bloody Burrow,” Ron shouted. They had passed among a crowd of young witches who were chattering fiercely just then, however, and he had to raise his voice even louder to repeat it to Harry. “Came from Goldstein’s yesterday, after I talked to you,” Ron continued, looking bewildered by the entire situation. “Spouting some rubbish about realizing he wasn’t the one she wanted to be with. Been whispering with Ginny ever since. Bloody girls.”
He had thought more than he liked to admit about what had happened in that classroom, and the way Malfoy had stood in a hurry and strode out the door. For several enjoyable minutes, Harry had wondered if perhaps Malfoy was deformed, or humiliatingly small, and that was why he had been insistent that Harry could not return the favor. After all, Harry knew blokes who wanked together; Seamus's sessions were practically a nightly ritual, and once Harry had come across the Weasley twins masturbating in their bedroom, lying on their separate beds. George—or had it been Fred?—had actually winked and invited Harry to join them, then laughed when Harry stumbled from the room in a hurry.
Harry takes a deep breath.  'I was wondering if I could see the cell he was in, if you knew it.  He was—I'm talking about—Sirius Black.'
Harry watched Ron eagerly pick through the three boxes of chocolates he had amassed, exclaiming now and then, “
Harry opens his mouth and she stomps on his foot.
'For the Order,' George agrees.  'Every Auror should have one, and you're right, we could make something a little more easy to hide, maybe—'
Malfoy was funny about being touched. Sometimes he would flare up if Harry so much as bumped against him and other times, carefully avoiding Harry's eyes, he'd slip a hand down between them before they'd barely got started.
'And Hermione and I would kill each other in about a week,' Ron put in, grinning. In his lap, Teddy had fallen asleep, hair halfway between blue and black. 'Come on, we need you, mate.'
Malfoy looked as if trying to decide upon something, and then he whipped out his mother's wand from his pocket. '
'You don't hate it now?'
get Snape?'
'Tracey Davis?' Malfoy interpreted, one eyebrow arched. 'She won't come back, she doesn't care about N.E.W.T.s. She's training to be a hairdresser.'
told him that his Occlumency lessons were to be put foremost, no matter what. But was that putting more people in danger?
Harry almost dropped his bag. 'What?'
Harry looked at the glittering rubies in the sword's hilt, out of place on the crumb-covered table in the dingy sunlight. He thought of its weight in his hand for the first time, when he was only twelve years old, face-to-face with a dead boy and his pet monster. He felt ancient.
Silence ruled until finally, his shame turning slowly into frustration, Harry snapped, “Months ago you would’ve been talking about it for days. You would’ve thought it was brilliant. You hate Malfoy.”
, suggested another, more doubting thought,
Malfoy is silent, too.  He turns his face towards Harry, slightly green.  'That could have been us, Potter.'
Malfoy sniffed. ‘You needn’t make it sound like I’m creeping away from a lovers’ tryst, Potter.’
What was
Harry glances at Malfoy, then away.  'He's with me,' he says.
‘C’mere then,’ Harry says, and she does.
'Oh, we wouldn't dream of it,' Hermione says innocently.  If Harry didn't know her at all, he might mistake the tone in her voice for apology, but he knows her very well.  She smiles at Zacharias.  'Here, do you want some salve for your hands?  Hedwig bites hard, I remember.'
'I'm not here to get him today or anything,' Harry reassures her.  'He, Lucius Malfoy I mean, I don't think he knows anything about this yet.  I just wanted to, to come by.'
'Good point,' Harry says.  'Besides, he doesn't seem to care much about defense, he isn't very good, is he?'
They walked quickly, not speaking, though Ginny kept casting knowing looks at Hermione and grinning, upon which Hermione would press her lips together, as if to keep from smiling. At this, Ron would glower at the floor, and Harry would hurry them along, eager to get to Tonks and hopefully change the subject.
“I’m fine, I’ve got Potions,” he said desperately and dashed away down the hall before she could even say goodbye. He imagined her staring after him, probably thinking he’d gone absolutely barking mad, but he wasn’t about to turn around, even to look.
“It wasn’t like that, Harry,” Tonks argued, giving him a pleading look, “I gave you a chance to save yourself, I made sure you had your wand before I gave you the Portkey—"
'Snape told me to come to you,' Malfoy blurts.  He looks flushed and desperate from struggling against Harry's spell, but he leans back as far as he can when Harry whirls on him.
—and for an instant, hands on her hips, she resembles Molly Weasley so much that Harry has to stifle a smile.
“My downfall as a true Marauder, Sirius liked to say,” Remus smiled as he sat down across from Harry.
Harry moved closer, though; everything was out of focus without his glasses. He eventually collided with Malfoy's warm limbs and tried to make sense of them, tracing a hand down his arm, thumb wrapping around his wrist. Malfoy turned his face into Harry's shoulder and Harry skimmed his hand up Malfoy's back, feeling him shudder gently at the touch. He looked all mussed now, hair rumpled from sleep and pajama top askew, and Harry was sure he was not much better. When he slipped his fingers through Malfoy's hair, Malfoy made a small noise that was almost contented.
, doesn’t she?”
Malfoy didn't answer, however; he was staring down at the map, as if he couldn't get enough. Harry was sure that Malfoy was calculating its use as a tool, but he couldn't muster any disgust; he was pleased that someone appreciated its value.
“I expect you will find out soon enough,” she said, and eyed him with stern amusement. “Hold on just a moment, you’ve got a bit of drool right—yes, there you are.”
, I’ve got to do Potions, I haven’t even started on my Transfiguration notes, and Pansy’ll kill me if I don’t return her book by the morning—"
'Well, we didn't learn much,' Harry pointed out, loath as he was to side against his best friend. 'And he didn't talk about the Dark Arts very much.' In fact, a rousing portion of the class had been devoted to whether the Caerphilly Catapults were on an upswing this season, but he hated to mention it, for he had shouted down Seamus just as loudly as Ron.
'I'm going to sleep,' Malfoy says.
, Harry finished in his head.
“I’m not a little girl,” she retorted, more to her mother than her brother, whom she promptly ignored. “I mean it, Mum, when’s the last time either of them came home with singed hair? It’s been at least a year! And I’m better in Potions, I am. Aren’t I, Hermione? I do better than
They’ve only had sex twice before, both between the spring of sixth year and the end of that summer, because after the war they didn’t speak for a year, and after that Molly Weasley did not have Voldemort to preoccupy her and protected her daughter’s supposed virginity with the tenacity of a Gringotts goblin.
The only brooms in the shed are the school brooms, full of dust and most with snapped twigs; they look as if they haven't been cared for in months, and Harry runs into several spider webs as he extricates the best two.
Harry smirked. As loath as Malfoy would be to admit it, Hogwarts was a sort of home to him, too.
!” Remus snapped. “That will be quite enough.” He turned to Dumbledore, who was listening calmly, eyes on the parchment. “Albus? Perhaps we might alter the record slightly—to cover Draco’s more, ahem, personal admissions—and, unless you have any questions?“
'Why don't you ask him yourself,' Pansy said, which would have been innocuous if not for the sidelong look she gave him. Harry glanced at Daphne and from the way she raised a delicate eyebrow, he knew she'd caught on. He was sure his face was crimson.
“I hate winter,” Padma was saying, her teeth chattering as she leaned into Theodore. Beside her, Lisa’s cheeks were pink with cold. “Oh, here comes the team—look, there’s Cho—"
Draco blinked. He looked blankly up at Harry, as if that had not been the question he was expecting, and its deviation threw him off. Before he could stop himself, he blurted, "What?"
'Just a second,' Harry yells back.  To a slumbering portrait of Mildred Horace Black, he mutters, 'Ten Galleons says it's something Malfoy did.'
‘I can’t sleep either,’ Harry offered. ‘In my bed, I mean.’
'Snow or no snow, it's at six o' clock,' Malfoy said. He flashed what might have almost been a smile. '
Harry shrugged. 'Hermione and Ron have been kissing a lot,' he said, ignoring Malfoy's strangled noise of disgust. 'Ernie Macmillan's parents sent me a ten page letter telling me all about his life the other day. Cho keeps asking me if I want to meet up, just for a coffee. I went by Cedric's grave just before school started, I thought I should. I told him it was over. I told him that Voldemort was finished, that he didn't die in vain. And his headstone, it says, it says,
Harry noticed, as he partnered up with Ron, that she swiftly changed her hair coloring back to pink. He doubted that Tonks, the daughter of Andromeda, would be thrilled about looking like Narcissa Malfoy.
The next thing he knows, it will be Blaise Zabini flinging himself at Harry, or worse still, Crabbe and Goyle.  'Um,' he says, at last.  'I guess that would be okay.'
Harry was strangely grateful that Ron hadn’t wished Malfoy’s dad dead. He’d probably thought it; so had Harry, more than once. In fact, sometimes he had lain awake and wished for nothing more than to have Lucius Malfoy at his wandpoint, his sneering face transformed by terror. But it suddenly seemed callous to say out loud that he should die. Harry thought of Malfoy’s drawn, quiet face. He wondered how he would feel.
'So it's true,' Malfoy said, suppressing a whimper. 'The Order did use Patronuses to communicate.'
“Don’t you talk about Sirius that way!” Harry shouted.
'It isn't,' Malfoy interrupted.
worry about it,” Harry snapped. “Only I haven’t a clue what I’m supposed to be worrying about, since nobody will tell me a thing. Are the Death Eaters in Wales? Is Voldemort?”
“Well, now you do,” Draco snarled. “Now get out.”
Maybe, he speculated, it wasn’t the same without any Black descendants living inside it. The thought was unexpectedly gloomy.
"Why?" Draco looks down at Harry, shifting to meet his eyes, perplexed. "We don't have to be."
'I didn't need them,' Harry said simply. 'They don't help, Malfoy, not the way you think they would. The Resurrection Stone doesn't bring anyone back from the dead, not the way you'd want. It doesn't do to sit around with the dead anyway. Not if you aren't living. Dumbledore said something like that to me in first year, when he caught me looking at the Mirror of Erised.'
“Hiya, Harry,” Colin Creevey said just then and dragged Harry back to the present. He half-smiled at Colin and his brother Dennis and sat down in the nearest chair next to Ron, who was trading completely made up stories with Seamus about his summer exploits. Harry felt a twinge of guilt at keeping the Tonks experience to himself, but before he could dwell on it, Hermione slid into the seat beside him.
"Tonks's mum got out, too," Ron pointed out. "Isn't she married to a Muggleborn wizard? Harry, didn't Sirius tell you that?"
"What?"
Near the end of the holidays, the Grangers had Harry over for dinner, complete with sugar-free after dinner mints. Mr. Granger made a lot of jokes about forgetting where he put his glasses.
'Me too, Harry,' she said sleepily, and crawled right out of bed and into the bed Harry and Malfoy had shared. 'Ron keeps jostling me, this is better. See you later.'
'You ought to care about this!' Hermione exclaimed, rounding on him. 'You're Head Boy! Didn't you read the letter that came with your badge? It's our job to look out for the welfare of the students at Hogwarts! That includes Slytherin, you know!'
At last most of Gryffindor departed, and aside from a few small clusters of students gathered up and down the table, it was just Harry and Hermione and Ron.
'Because of me and Snape and your mum,' Harry retorted. 'Real smart, Malfoy. Take some initiative for once, won't you? You're better than somebody's pawn.'
“I came back early,” Harry said quietly, not daring to look at Hermione. Now was not the time to explain to Ron why, exactly, he had returned to the castle so early. “How’s your leg?”
Remus looked thoughtful but not entirely surprised. “Quite a bit, I’d say,” he said at last. “You’ve certainly got her temper. And Lily could never stand for anything being unjust; she’d like Hermione a lot, I think. She was very—" He seemed to be struggling. “Alive. Vivid. I’m sorry, Harry, I don’t know how to put it better.”
“I didn’t tell Hermione and Ron,” Harry said. He was proud of how steady he’d managed to keep his voice. “I’ve only told you.“
So he kissed him.
'Yeah, with Cho crying all over the place and you and my sister being on and off every time I turn around.'
The hall was filled with noise as benches were pushed around and people jostled, and then it was silent again, a sea of students in black robes standing and facing their Headmistress.
“Tea would be nice, thank you,” Hermione said, and Ron and Harry agreed, though all of them eyed Hagrid’s plate of rock-like lumps suspiciously. While he was putting his copper kettle on the fire, Harry took a rock-biscuit and gnawed on it, hoping he wouldn’t break a tooth, and said innocently,
'Me too,' Harry said.
'I said, how'd it go with Malfoy last night?'
'I'll show you,' Hermione says, standing up and linking arms with him, looking amused.  'And by the way, I'm glad you're sober.  Ron and Malfoy, they've been doing shots for the past hour—they both think it's a competition, neither of them wants to be outdone by the other—'
He sounded like a stuttering version of Hermione, and Harry had to grin ruefully at her affect on Ron. 'So what you're saying, you're saying I need other life skills than foraging for berries,' he said. 'And erecting a camp tent.'
yesterday. You ought to keep your Mudblood on a leash.'
'That's awfully symbolic for you, Harry Potter,' Hermione teased. 'No, I think it's a lovely name. Here, it looks like he's got a letter for you, too.'
Ron shook his head emphatically. 'Well, of course she shouldn't go, Harry,' he said, as if he had been saying this for days and Harry was only just now catching up. 'No, no, you've got to go, Hermione can't go at all, absolutely not!'
'Did you or didn't you?'
'Oh yeah, forgot about that,' Harry says.  He concentrates, and a minute later, Malfoy is thrown back against the nearest upright chair, several large ropes having wound themselves around him.  Harry can't help showing a small grin of triumph when Malfoy struggles and cannot move.  'Nonverbal magic,' Harry says casually.  'Someone wasn't paying attention last year, it seems.  Too busy working for Voldemort, were you?'
Everyone is silent.  Then Hermione says, in that tentative voice that means she knows Harry will disagree, 'Maybe because Snape isn't—isn't actually working for Voldemort?'
,' Harry reads, feeling a flutter of disappointment.  'I suppose that means Malfoy's mum should be headed there in a couple days.  Oh, and he's scribbled a bit about chatting soon at the bottom.'
'Because he works with dragons?' Ron said doubtfully. 'And he's older and has a fang earring and a tattoo?'
Dumbledore said mildly, “And why would that be, Harry?”
,' she said, at which Charlie outright grinned, 'but while I happen to agree that you don't need a N.E.W.T. to stand up to the Dark Arts, you can't be saying that N.E.W.T.s aren't important . . . ?'
Tonks laughed. “Oh, that. It’s okay, I’ll show you. Just follow my lead, okay? Do what everybody else is doing. I mean, watch them.” She was pressed up against him and he could see the beads of sweat on her forehead, the flush in her cheeks. “Put your hands on my hips. No, lower. There you go. Now move. Feel the music? Okay, no, like this.” Harry was crimson with embarrassment, but he let her guide him into some sort of motion, keeping his eyes on how Malfoy was bumping up against Pansy. “Yeah,” Tonks said, low in his ear, “relax a little, there you go. You can move closer . . . Harry, I’m not made of
“I won’t,” Harry said, just as impatient as Ron. “I just want to know what’s going on.”
Harry stared as Malfoy walked down the corridor and gestured towards the loo there, then inside. When Harry hurried after him, his footsteps rang loud in the hallway, a sharp and shameful sound. He thought about leaving for one terrible second, and then he pushed the door open.
'He can?' Hermione says.
Tonks shrugged a shoulder. “It’s all right. Yeah. He wrote to me every week I was at Hogwarts, you know? I’m closer with my mum, but she gets a little vague, sometimes, she tends to forget time passing – the war was hard on her. Anyway, he was the one I’d tell about all my mischief, and the hearts I’d broken, and all of it. He always said he was proud of me.”
'Harry,' she hisses.  'We do need something, remember—we need a meeting place—'
“Bye, Harry,” Lisa and Padma waved, and Theodore might have grunted something akin to a goodbye.
“It’s that dratted woman,” Remus said. “Not for the first time do I wish we could just remove her. But her picture appears to be rather firmly stuck to the wall.”
Hermione's hand was poised over her parchment, ink slowly dripping from the tip, but she was not writing; she was frowning at Charlie, unsure where he was going.
“Snape was the only one who looked out for us,” Draco barreled on, “and he was the best professor here. Don’t we have the right to mourn for him? Don’t we?”
?' she burst out the minute she left the classroom, still clutching her bedraggled quill in one hand and a roll of blank parchment in the other; it was perhaps the first class ever that Hermione had left without taking a single note. She was so apoplectic that she was incapable of forming whole sentences. 'It was—
It had been an exhausting evening. After facing an irate Snape in what had been Harry’s worst Occlumency lesson all year, he’d managed to run to the pitch to catch the last hour of Quidditch practice. Jack had taken to forcing them into early morning and late night practice, as if it would improve their skills to play at all hours of the day. It had begun drizzling shortly after Harry arrived, and when he tramped off the pitch with Ron and Ginny, all three were damp, unhappy, and covered in mud.
“I told you after the Hogsmeade attack that he wasn’t the spy, and nothing had happened between us then,” Harry snapped, and even Ron quieted at the tone in his voice. “You know me, Ron. And he’s different, okay? I can’t explain how, but I know it. He wasn’t even at Hogsmeade when the attack happened, he couldn’t have had anything to do with it, and he was really upset about Snape, it was like losing his father all over again—"
Malfoy returned to classes a day later, slipping out into the hallway during lunch, as if hoping no one would see. Unfortunately for him, Harry was waiting, a brown paper package under one arm.
Which was why Hermione insisted to him again at dinner that someone must intervene. Yet the next Potions class, and the next, only the six of them appeared. Professor Kothari seemed hardly to notice, and taught them as cheerfully as if she had had a classroom full of hundreds.
“. . . absolutely ridiculous,” a portrait of a tall, scowling man was saying, shaking his head firmly. “There would be no point in government if we were able to dispose our leaders at will! Anarchy, I tell you! Elections serve a purpose.”
"I'm not surprised," Draco muttered, "you don't even know all the Hufflepuffs in our year, do you?"
'As long as it's not called HURL,' he added rapidly, the words muffled by her hair. 'Help the Underprivileged—'
Malfoy eyed him for a second. At last, he sighed dramatically, 'If you must.'
-num, no, wait, ex-
'Yeah.'
“Unless they never catch him,” Harry continued, “but that doesn’t do you much good, does it? He’d still be a fugitive . . .”
'Suppose so,' Harry shrugged. 'I told Cho I'd meet her for a coffee.'
'Er, he says that you and your mum ought to do the same,' Harry finishes.
And after Hermione goes off to finish reading a thick biography of Rowena Ravenclaw in the hopes of pinpointing what another of Voldemort's Horcruxes might be, Ron leans towards Harry, grinning.  'Don't tell her,' he whispers, 'because she doesn't know I saw, but last night she caught Malfoy trying to set fire to a book—it was one of Fred and George's new stock, the ones that insult you, you know, reckon they got the idea from the Marauder's Map—anyway, she started shouting and set that lot of birds on him.'
“I’m sorry about your dad,” Harry said, seriously. He didn’t ask who Kirley was, and didn’t care.
He felt weightless at the same time he felt as if a great burden were resting on his shoulders; something buoyant was brimming inside him and burned as it did. He had the leaden pain of grief dulling a place in his chest, and something prickling, something close to hope. He had no home, no family to speak of. But he had his friends. Someday, somewhere, he might have to die and, so doing, might fail a whole world.
Hermione rolled her eyes. 'Of course, you'd rather watch Quidditch every day, would you? Well,
Harry was unwavering. “Draco,” he acknowledged, as loud as he dared.
Harry just looked up at him, still half asleep. ‘What?’
Draco stopped. He didn’t turn around.
“Smart of you,” Tonks grinned. “Look at me, I haven’t got any parchment out at all. Here, why don’t you just tell me a little about what you’ve done, and we’ll go from there?”
.  He feels old and a little cruel when he says, 'I don't have any time.'
They looked at each other. Finally, Harry tried, 'So, um, what are you working on in Charms right now? Luna said you have an exam on Friday.'
Harry just stared at her. There were a thousand threads of emotion in him, and he couldn’t make sense of any of it.
After dinner, they all listened to carols on the wireless and sat by the fire, everyone's heads slowly drooping. Even Mrs. Weasley looked content, Harry thought, sitting beside Bill and talking at length about baby clothes.
“Wait,” Draco might have said, but Harry was already yelling, “
“Don’ know what else it coulda been. Suspectin’ Yeh-Know-Who’s gatherin’ forces, an’ with the Dementors gone an’ out o’ Azkaban, they mighta gone ter join ‘im in Wales, ‘cause Muggles can’ see ‘em, yeh know—the giants with Golgomath too, could be hidin’ out in the mountains. When Yeh-Know-Who firs’ came ter power, he pooled his strength out in the country, gatherin’ all his Death Eaters an’ allies before anybody even knew who he was. Could be the same kind o’ plan, only thanks ter you, Harry, this time we’ve got a warnin’ ter keep an eye out fer ‘im.”
“I’ll have you know that my great-great-uncle was bitten by a tap and died from it within the week,” Draco said indignantly.
Malfoy flushed but said, 'You haven't got one, have you? Perhaps you should try a bit harder, Potter, I'm sure someone would be willing to suffer your company. Moaning Myrtle, maybe . . . I hear that fat toad Eloise Midgen hasn't got anybody to take her . . .'
But upon reaching the kitchen, Harry could see why Hermione had been so conscious about Ron’s banging around. Gathered in the kitchen were at least a dozen witches and wizards, and Lupin and Mrs. Weasley were the only ones whom Harry recognized. Upon his entrance, several of them clapped, and one lavender-clad woman rushed forward to pump his hand. “Happy birthday, Harry Potter,” she declared, and with nothing more, quickly hurried out of the kitchen. When two others approached him just afterwards, it became clear that they were all merely there to wish him good tidings on his birthday.
His wandering eventually brought him to Scrivenshaft’s, and remembering that Hermione planned to visit, he climbed the stone steps and pushed into the shop, letting the smooth, heavy door click shut behind him. A tiny bell rang above his head, and he thought he heard the low burble of some kind of bird from the back of the shop. Everything was old wood and dust. He could see immediately why Hermione liked it; after all, the shop felt just like a library.
'I saw some once,' Harry says.  He shivers, despite how far from that cold water he is now, how many months it has been since he led Dumbledore back over the rocks.  'A lot of them, really.'
. He blinked at it for a moment, embarrassed, then pinned it on anyway.
The day of the match dawned clear and cold, the sky of the Great Hall a brilliant blue overhead as they ate breakfast. Ron's leg was jiggling nervously under the table, but aside from that, there was little sign of the upcoming match. Harry realized he had got used to Ginny's morning chatter before they headed off for the pitch, and he missed her easygoing cheer to temper her brother's nerves.
On his way back into the castle, he runs into Professor McGonagall, carrying a load of heavy books under her arm.  'Oh, hello, Potter,' she says distractedly.  'Been to see Hagrid, have you?'
'Too bad.' The smirk on Malfoy's face was so smug Harry felt like knocking the whole box out of his hands. 'I only give my sweets to those who deserve them.'
Harry stares at him.  When they went to bed the night before, Malfoy curled up beneath his duvet in wary silence, despite the fact that Harry has spent the past two and a half months listening to Malfoy complain incessantly about dust and Hedwig and vicious wardrobes and the size of Harry's shirts and blisters and Fleur Delacour and how much he despises casserole. Harry wasn't sure if Malfoy's silent treatment merited an apology or further mistrust, and in the end, he too went to sleep having offered neither.
“I,” Harry began, but just then Mrs. Weasley called Ginny to help with dinner and Hermione went along. He lowered his voice too. “Where are we really going, then?”
'His birthday was in June,' Hermione says, 'but you know, we could always throw him a late one.'
'I can't,' Harry says.  He expects the pang of memory, and it surprises him with its familiarity.  He shrugs.  'You haven't forgiven me for what I did to you in that bathroom.  I don't expect you to.  Listen, Malfoy, that's not what matters now.  You're either with us or you aren't.  If you're out for yourself that's the same as being for Voldemort, in the end.  It's like Hermione said.  If you aren't one hundred per cent committed—'
“I’m fine, Hermione,” Ron said, though he looked rather pleased that she was worried about him. “Where is everyone?”
Harry swallowed. He would talk to Malfoy. That’s what he would do. And Malfoy would say something horrible about Sirius and fleas and lost pets and Harry would punch him and that would be the end of it. Once he saw how rotten Malfoy was, it wouldn’t matter. He’d send Tonks an owl in the morning. And he’d find Malfoy and everything would settle itself.
'Well, I wouldn't be caught dead next to that lump,' Pansy declared, then eyed Harry with some trepidation. 'Not that I want him dead,' she added hastily. 'So what, Potter, you couldn't find a date after Loony turned you down? Little Astoria Greengrass is still looking for a partner. That is, if she's not still retching in the loo.'
Picking up the picture of his dad, Harry glanced down at the next one, which was of Remus sitting next to an enormous pile of books.
'I'll be in Gryffindor Tower if you want to
‘With whom,’ Hermione said. She sounded absent-minded, mild, but eight years of friendship meant Harry knew the calculation behind her casual tone. ‘And I’d imagine he’s sleeping in his dormitory bed, if he’s noticed you aren’t.’
Harry said, without tearing his eyes away, “I want you to cast the Cruciatus Curse on me like you really mean it, or I am not going to let you walk away like this.” He pushed closer to Draco, their faces inches apart. “Come on, Malfoy. I’ve always wanted to know. Do you hate me, or are you all talk?”
'Oh, you were the one out there conducting your pathetic song,' Harry retorted. 'Speaking of which, you never wrote a song about me, Malfoy, should I be hurt?'
fans,” he said, feeling altogether embarrassed. He didn’t want to be Gilderoy Lockhart, signing autographed pictures over breakfast, bowing at strangers as if it were his due when they wished him a happy birthday. He was relieved when Mrs. Weasley began to set dishes on the table, letting himself be distracted by breakfast while Ron, Hermione, and Ginny all eagerly began to open the new mail. With the exception of Hagrid and a card that fizzled into tiny fireworks from the twins, Harry knew none of the senders. A few of them were enchanted to sing, and Harry was startled every time by an unfamiliar voice singing him a happy birthday. One was from a high and screechy witch named Eloise, and Ron liked her rendition of “Happy Birthday” so much that he played it four times before Mrs. Weasley confiscated it.
'Um,' Harry said, 'hey, Malfoy.'
“Me?” Harry exclaimed. “Talk to the Slytherins?”
He smiled as the portrait swung shut behind her, shaking his head, and then he pulled out a scrap of parchment and began to write.
In the morning, no one was awake, and it took Harry a moment to realize he was still lying half-entangled with Malfoy beside him. In the effort it took to disengage his limbs, he jostled Malfoy, who made a sleepy noise and rolled over.
“I was trying to help you,” Draco said, and Harry could see in his eyes that, despite himself, he was telling the truth.
“Why would I want help from a madman?” Malfoy sneered, trying in vain to retrieve lost dignity. “What is this, Potter, your idea of charity?”
Leaving one's portrait is like an out-of-body experience. It is whiteness, and you cannot see yourself, but you are conscious of your own thoughts and the sounds of what is going on outside, if anything. Harry realizes, when he leaves his portrait, that this must be how the portraits at Hogwarts knew everything. They must have reported to Dumbledore.
'I don't
'I love you despite ze cheekens,' Fleur says and Harry, embarrassed, decides it is time to rejoin the party after all.
“What?”
“Did you know about the attack on Hogsmeade?”
Neville shrugged. His hair was getting long, and he had a few scars remaining, ones no magic would quite take away. They all had them. 'Yeah,' Neville said. 'I suppose so.'
Yes,' Hermione said seriously. 'Because—because it isn't over. There will always be evil in the world. Maybe not the Voldemort kind, maybe just the human kind, like Umbridge, but we've still got to fight it.'
He had been eighteen years old for five hours now. Drowsy birdsong drifted through the open window, while the just-rising sun turned to gold the room's pale gray walls, as well as the inhabitants of the Muggle pictures pasted there. It was just the sort of muggy morning that, less than two months ago, Harry had never thought he would live to see again.
'You know, I thought we were grown-up,' Harry said at last, when they were nearly to the doors. He had been thinking about the conversation they'd had with Hagrid, and the way adults still seemed to tell him what to do, rest or testify or leave the whole lot of Slytherin alone. He shrugged. 'On our own, in the woods, you know.'
Harry wasn’t aware he was flushing in horror. He had turned towards the door, luckily, and Ron was too busy brushing his teeth to notice anything.
“Be that as it may, I want you to be careful.” She looked at him solemnly for a long moment before standing up and stacking her books in a pile. “I’ve got to go to the library before curfew. But, Harry, if you don’t tell Ron at least part of this, soon, I’m going to tell him. Because he deserves to know. But I also think that he deserves to hear it from you.”
“I’d do it again,” Harry said roughly, dangerously. “Don’t you ever doubt it. I wouldn’t even hesitate.”
Malfoy snorted. 'I'd rather stay here.'
Harry watches Pansy Parkinson shove past Neville, her lips forming words that can't be unifying in the least, and he says wryly, 'Not quite.'
'I'm the one with the wand against your throat,' Malfoy hisses.
Andromeda, to Harry's surprise, sounded amused rather than offended. 'That's one way to put it, I suppose.'
Draco looked distasteful. "Very well. I still don't like Professor Lupin. Or you."
Harry was already distracted by the posters on the wall, which loudly advertised old matches with snippets of the announcer’s coverage and the roaring of the crowd. He watched the Seeker for the Tornados make a victory lap around the pitch with the Snitch held high in his fist. Next to him, a recording of a recent match was looping, and he absently heard the announcer yelling, “And there goes Perkins for the Arrows—but here comes Falmouth! Looking none too pleased—and it’s a nice save!—And it’s Perkins, Perkins with the Quaffle as the Arrows lead sixty-thirty—“
It's silent and cool in the Entrance Hall, and at that moment, everything feels exactly as it should be, late afternoon, everyone else in their common rooms or the library, studying for NEWTs or the next Potions exam.  Harry breathes it in, this one moment where he can pretend all is simple, normal, and then he exhales.
They went to the Hog's Head to avoid recognition; Harry had a notion that Aberforth wouldn't report them, and besides, it was worth it for the look of horror that crossed Malfoy's face as soon as they set foot in the bar.
'I liked it when there were only four of them,' Ron muttered.
“That’s awful,” said Hannah Abbott, the only Hufflepuff in the class, from across the aisle. “This is strange, isn’t it? I’m almost enjoying myself.”
'Hermione?' he said softly. 'Are you awake?'
Harry says, without looking at Malfoy, 'Dumbledore didn't think Malfoy was a killer.  And—and neither do I.'
“Did you hex him?”
On the first of September, Harry boarded the train at King’s Cross with Ginny, waving as Hermione and Ron disappeared off—with much grumbling on Ron’s part—to the Prefects’ car. Harry had all but forgotten Dudley’s death. The month filled with housework had pushed blocks of time between him and his aunt and uncle, and his thoughts were more likely to settle on Sirius than his deceased cousin. Even that had dulled, however, by the time he bid farewell to his room at 12 Grimmauld Place; he had cried, a few nights running, after dusting Sirius’s former room for Mrs. Weasley, and he still felt sudden pangs that stopped his lungs from working when he thought about his godfather’s arcing fall, but Sirius’s name on his lips was routine enough, now, and he stopped taking the long way to the kitchen so as to avoid the tapestry of Black lineage.
“They’re putting too much energy into useless things,” Hermione explained, sounding distraught. “How to seal up your home, what to tell your children if someone you know is killed, rubbish! And meanwhile, Voldemort—oh, Ron, don’t look at me like that—
Harry thought,
The room filled up quickly after that, and they settled down to work, which had become more varied as the year progressed: they were mostly working on dueling now, and Remus had suggested they pair up in threes for practice on fighting two foes at once, which they promptly did. Harry and Ron originally partnered with Neville, but once Harry saw Luna wandering around by herself, he left Ron to fend off Neville and Luna and circled the room with Remus.
'Oh, shut up,' Malfoy snaps, hair in his face, off-balance.  His arms are still around Harry.  He holds on a little too long, and Harry lets him.
“Well?” Draco demanded, not looking at him. “You heard him. Time’s up. Get out of here, Potter.”
got O’s.
This did not mean anyone let up, however; somehow the girls of Hogwarts, perhaps taking a cue from the fact that he was closest to no-nonsense Hermione and headstrong Ginny, thought that he only needed to be bullied into a relationship, and were determined to argue their way into a date. He was in the middle of a lecture from Sir Cadogan, of all people, about the virtues of Orla Quirke, when he heard footsteps and turned toward them gratefully. It was Malfoy, though most of his attention remained on the box of chocolates he was picking through.
She pulled him through aisle after aisle, past whizzing quills and self-sorting photographs, and one lanky wizard who had fallen asleep at his desk with his hat still on. 'Somewhere,' Hermione was muttering, 'somewhere, oh, it's got to be—oh!'
He said it in the way one might say, 'You're a flesh-eating slug,' and still Harry grinned.
Still, even Ron admitted that it was strange for Malfoy, of all people, to have been the person to save Harry from his fall.
Three days later, when the most harmful thing Malfoy has done is yowl at the top of his lungs when confronted with a spider in the shower, Harry gives him his wand back.  Malfoy, grinning gleefully, waves it in his face and shouts, "
Harry flushed. “So what? What does that even mean?”
'Kept us up half the night,' Hermione adds, giving a little shrug.
'So I'm bigger, then,' Ron said. When Harry nodded, he looked absurdly satisfied.
'Fuck off,' Malfoy says, his face pinched.  He's beginning to look as if this wasn't such a good idea.
Malfoy mumbled something. After Harry's impatient look, he said louder, 'I'd like to be an Unspeakable, all right, now shut up about it.'
'You tell us or we'll do worse than the Cruciatus Curse,' Harry snaps.  'And then we'll take you to the Ministry.  I've no doubt that
Harry thought with some regret of the book he had left in the Room of Requirement, now lost forever to the Fiendfyre, its original owner just as beyond reach. 'I've been, um, distracted, Professor.'
'I'll avoid him if he avoids me,' Harry began to retort, when the portrait hole swung open to admit Ron, covered in leaves and panting.
'And what?' Malfoy says impatiently.
He burst through the wall on Platform Nine and Three Quarters . . . Snuffles loped towards him with a newspaper in his mouth . . . Aunt Petunia handed him a plate containing only half a sausage and a teaspoonful of egg . . . Sirius was grinning at him as he polished a mirror . . . Harry reached out for the Snitch, its wings brushing his fingertips . . . Sirius arced backwards, falling, falling . . .
He had apparently abandoned any pretense of pride around Harry; Malfoy looked genuinely miserable.
“Sorry, what?”
Harry ruefully watched her begin writing, unsure whether he liked her or hated her. But by the end of the class, she clapped him on the shoulder after sticking her notes in her bag and said, deadpan, “Cheer up, Potter, I didn’t get an O either.” By the time he looked up at her, she was halfway to the door.
The first Hogsmeade weekend dawned chilly and bright, the sun high and gold by breakfast. When Harry reached the table, Ron was ripping savagely at his piece of toast, scowling. “Not bloody fair,” he muttered, “never asked to be a Prefect, nobody said I’d have to do
“Potter,” McGonagall said coolly, when they had reached the hall, “the Headmaster would like to see you. I trust you can find your way there on your own.”
She squeezed his hand again and moved forward to take Ron's.
'I don't know!' Malfoy repeats loudly, his face pinched with annoyance and what might be a trace of fear.  'I never knew where we were, he never told me, it's all a blur—'
Hermione shrugged. 'He's scum, Harry, we've always known that. The Imperius Curse, what rubbish.'
“You need to watch your temper,” Malfoy shouted through the wind to him, sneering as they rounded the corner by the Slytherin goalhoops and sped off on a curve, “I’d hate to think you would get so worked up about a couple of Muggles in Wales—"
'Well, Ravenclaw's a bit more interested in that sort of thing!  You know—learning!'
'I don't mean it like that, Malfoy! I'm trying to help!'
Andromeda passed by Harry on the stairs then, and she exclaimed, 'Cissy?'
'The Mirror of what?' Malfoy echoed, still looking as if Harry were speaking in Parseltongue. 'Never mind, I'm obviously unenlightened about the grand adventures of The Boy Who Lived—'
When he comes back around, Malfoy's snickering at him, and Harry shouts, 'Are we going to play or not?'
Harry sat down across from him and said, “It feels heavy,” before he could think about it. “I don’t know. It’s kind of nice.”
“Who was I supposed to tell?” Draco snapped. “I would have told Snape but I got him killed, didn’t I?”
Hermione blushes.  'Sometime, I will,' she says.  'Right now, I think we ought to work on things that will actually protect us, or stop an enemy from attacking—'
Harry bit his lip. 'I think Andromeda might've got your mum addicted to cigarettes.'
Harry turned it over in his fingers, frowning. “I thought you—" Harry began, when he looked up at Draco and saw him smiling strangely, almost sadly. Harry said, confused, “What is it?”
Harry wonders if Draco has the same thoughts. He wonders if, for Draco, being a painting is far less romantic and wonderful than Draco expected. He never asks, however. Usually he just sits and waits. The time passes faster than he thinks it will. Most of the time, Harry feels like a painting. He can't explain it, only that he has no desire to move, to live; he isn't, after all, a person. He's a replication of one.
Harry pressed at his hair again. 'Yeah,' he said at last. He was thinking of Godric, but for some reason, his dad's was the face that kept swimming before him. 'Yeah, sometimes we can be a little arrogant.'
'Yes you are,' Malfoy shot back. 'You pity us, pity
Malfoy's mouth dropped open. 'You—dare—'
, and Hermione’s frown when she said
Ron brightened; he might have even stood a bit straighter. 'I am, aren't I? Charlie's a bit on the short side, always has been, really.'
'Eloise is nice,' Harry said automatically; to his recollection, he had never exchanged a word with this Eloise Midgen in his life. 'Look, I don't want to go with anybody, so sod off. Who're you taking, anyway?'
“Hey,” Harry protested, “you play Quidditch too.”
Harry shrugged. 'A present?'
He felt a hand squeeze his shoulder, and then Mr. Weasley said gently, “Go on, Harry, go upstairs and get your things. I’ll take care of this.”
It just made him think of Sirius.
'I think if Hermione told me we were quits, I'd tell her we bloody well weren't, and she'd have to do better than that troll McLaggen to get me to lay off,' Ron said matter-of-factly. 'Sure, we have our rows, and we can both be pigheaded at times—'
'Oh, come off it, it's only Malfoy,' Ron snapped before Harry could answer. At the other end of the greenhouse, Professor Sprout looked up, and Ron lowered his voice to a vehement whisper. 'I mean it, Hermione, I've had enough of this, it's always Malfoy this, Malfoy that, is Malfoy enjoying his breakfast, doesn't Malfoy look handsome today, do you think Malfoy's marks in Charms are satisfactory! It's like sixth year all over again!'
Later that afternoon, he was attempting work with Ron in the library, head drooping over their Potions text, when Ron nudged him in the ribs. Four or five tables away, Malfoy had stopped Penelope in the aisle and seemed to be engaging in more blatant flattery.
Harry had taken it from her, frowning. “How do you know?”
Harry suddenly remembered Professor Kothari telling him sadly that she lamented Snape’s death as a colleague, and something itched, some missing link. He frowned. “I know I heard something about her, what was it? I was . . . reading . . . oh! Draco’s letter!”
'Potter—'
He thought of the spit-second images he’d glimpsed from Snape’s mind during that one Occlumency lesson: a sullen, yellow-faced boy cowering in the corner; a morose teenager, killing flies; a boy being mocked as he tried in vain to mount his broom. He pictured Snape hanging upside down and his dad and Sirius circling him eagerly. He wondered how Snape had felt, knowing he died for James Potter’s son. He wondered if Snape had ever been happy.
“I’m going up to bed,” Ron announced through the haze of his thoughts, and Harry shook himself out of it to find that Hermione was also preparing to leave. He frowned down at Harry. “You all right?”
'I'm only saying, there's a great deal of reform needed, and the sooner the better. There aren't any wizards or witches in place who'll stand up for the rights of non-wizards, is the problem, or precious few! Why, that absolute brute Macnair worked in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, that ought to tell you a bit about the Ministry's priorities, don't you think, Harry?'
And Malfoy,
“Harry,” Dumbledore welcomed him, as if he were presiding over something as innocuous as a Hogwarts feast. “It appears you have had quite the evening. Remus, thank you for bringing him back safely. Now, Harry, why don’t you sit down—"
‘He’s such a coward,’ Harry said furiously to Hermione, later in the library. He rubbed at his eyes; they felt gritty, tired. ‘Fucking Slytherins.’
And Draco, with one eyebrow raised, said coolly and unreadably, "I was."
Malfoy lifts a lip in disdain.  'Likely hours,' he sneers.  'Granger found a whole new room of books, she's driving Pince mad—the old bat won't let her alone—'
“I do,” Harry said, too quickly.
“I didn’t expect it,” Harry explained, “I thought he would just pay me back.”
Except for the wand he's twirling in his hands.
'Oh, Pansy Parkinson's brother was Kissed last week,' Hermione said fitfully, and Harry remembered seeing her crying at breakfast and only now wondered why. 'And Rowle before him, there haven't been many. Most of the worst Death Eaters were killed, after all, and the others were given life sentences, but there are a couple families who won't make a fuss, they can't, the Malfoys have sunk really low and the Ministry really wants the Manor—and nobody would testify for Draco—'
To Harry's shock, a serene blonde woman stepped out of the shadows, her mouth in an expression of distaste and her profile near-identical to Andromeda's. 'Auntie Walburga,' Narcissa Malfoy said calmly, ignoring Mrs. Black's squawk of surprise. 'That is enough.'
"Well, you’re doing a splendid job of it," Malfoy shot back. "What do you think, you could defeat the Dark Lord by having a crying fit over everybody he'd killed?"
Harry looks at her glowing face, the way she is beaming with conviction and knowledge and belief in him, and can't believe he ever compared her to Malfoy.
Comprehension dawns on Malfoy's face and quickly morphs into rage as realizations come flooding in, but Harry doesn't have time to argue about school pranks.  'Why would I help you?' he asks again.  'Why wouldn't I just kill you?  It'd save me and Voldemort a lot of trouble.'
As Harry fumbled through his trunk for his cloak, something shining caught his eye, and he grabbed for it with a gasp.
'How?' Harry demanded. 'He's still stuck-up, and awful, and he laughs at other people all the time!'
“Company?” Hermione echoed, sounding rather startled. “You mean, like another giant?”
“Oh, not
Harry's eyes flashed. "You rejected me."
'Hers works better,' Malfoy shrugged. 'Hey, speaking of wands. This Elder Wand. If I was the true master, don't I deserve to see it? If you don't want it, shouldn't I have it?'
Draco was lying on his stomach, carefully writing what appeared to be a very long letter, and he looked up with alarm when he heard the snick of the door. At the sight of Harry, he raised an eyebrow. “Potter,” he said.
“Well,” said Mr. Weasley, “the short of it is, I’m very sorry, but it seems your cousin has been, ahem, murdered. Your aunt and uncle have just found him, his body was left . . .”
Harry glared at him. 'Will you hear me out? I know it hasn't been easy for you, coming back, and we sort of just left you to it. I wanted you to have this in case you need to contact somebody. That's all.'
'We just got Slytherin back,' Harry said, and his voice sounded cold and furious, but he didn't care, even when Hermione looked scared and Ron taken aback. 'We can't let this happen! Not now. Not Malfoy.'
'I'm not going to class,' Harry said. 'I'm, um. I could stay here for a while, maybe. If you promise not to skip out in the morning like last time.'
Malfoy's hand was shaking with the finest tremors, Harry could tell because the water in the glass was trembling. He advanced towards Malfoy; why, he didn't know, but he wanted to do something, shove him or shake him or just hold on.
“I suppose,” Ron said reluctantly. “Hey, speaking of the Order, have you heard from Tonks, Harry? She wasn’t hurt?”
“Why can’t you just tell her?”
“You started that!” Draco snarled, clearly remembering their eerily similar encounter by the Potions classroom as well as Harry did. “There you go again, one minute you’re all smiles, the next you’re shoving your wand in my face—"
'I don't know where to
A week or so before, Harry remembered, he had come across Malfoy in the library, his pale head drooping on a book; Harry had put his hand on Malfoy's shoulder for a second, clumsy and brief. It was true that Malfoy had been up nights—revising, Harry had assumed—and Harry'd said, easily, 'Worried?' Malfoy had thrown him a pinched look and Harry had said, a little amused, 'Hey, it'll turn out all right.'
“Ron,” Harry said, and his throat tightened around the word, he couldn’t say any more. He hoped Ron got the message. After swallowing several times, he said, “But it doesn’t matter, Malfoy’s the same he’s always been. You were right.”
Harry would joke that he'd rather tell Hermione and Ron could take Malfoy, but he doesn't feel much like joking.  As he ascends the stairs, he thinks about his last glimpse of Lucius, and how he looked, curled with his back to Harry on the dirty brick.  If Lucius had been awake, Harry knows, he'd have looked far less vulnerable, less human.  Harry almost wishes he had been left with a memory of Lucius snarling at him in disgust, rather than that one image, matted hair and a cold stone floor.
Harry smirks.  'That's nice, Malfoy, but since you can't Apparate by yourself, I'd have to Apparate you back and then Apparate myself back here, and I don't have the energy to do that.  Now, if you would learn to Apparate, maybe this all could have been prevented—'
Hermione looked pink, too, and wouldn’t look at Harry when she spoke. “What kind of thoughts?”
Malfoy shot Harry a filthy look, but an instant later he was beaming up at Slughorn again, looking for all the world as if Slughorn were his long-time idol. 'What are we working on today, Professor?' Malfoy asked as Harry dumped his things on a desk further away. 'I did so enjoy your lessons last year, and I'm looking forward to repeating some of them, I'm sure there's always more to learn from you— '
Malfoy, always easy to set off, narrowed his eyes. 'Where's your Mudblood?' he taunted. 'I thought there was something different. Of course, you're probably used to the stench of dirty blood by now, Weasel.' He made a suggestive hand gesture that nearly had Ron leaping out of his seat.
“Malfoy,” he said, terrified. “Malfoy, Draco, look at me. Are you all right? Are you—"
Hermione snorted. ‘I saw you sitting next to Romilda Vane at supper, does that mean you two are an item now? Is that where you’re sneaking off to, after hours?’
'She is mental,' Ron concluded, making a face at Harry.
aren't possible Dark artifacts!"
Harry pulled back, Draco’s breath hot on his cheek, enough to stumble blindly forwards and pitch them both onto the couch, Draco beneath him. He was bony and sharp and hissed a little when Harry’s thigh slid easily and unexpectedly into the space between his, and Harry yanked off his glasses, dropping them to the table.
“Or I could get killed by Voldemort!” Harry said fiercely. “It didn’t stop Bellatrix from using it on Neville because the Ministry said it wasn’t allowed, did it?”
There was another long pause. Harry stared at him. “Well?”
'First-years,' Ron said, shaking his head; his hair was still tousled from sleep. 'Down by the lake trying to walk on the ice. I think one of them fell in. Pomfrey's down there. Oh, there's Hermione, I suppose I ought to go too . . .?' He said this in an inquiring tone, waiting for Harry to reassure him he might as well stay in the warmth of the dormitory.
“I think you’re the one messing around with things you don’t know anything about,” Harry retorted, his tone dangerous. “Be careful what you say, Malfoy, or you could end up just like your dad—or worse—I’d kill him if I got the chance—"
Not for the first time, Harry wished he had brought his Invisiblity Cloak along, despite Hermione's admonitions that it was not to be used lightly. Ducking his head, he gave thanks for the close proximity of the neon window display of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and dashed for the door.
Then, later that night, Malfoy flooed back.
to him,' Harry mocks.  'Malfoy, he's alive and he's okay.  And your mum should be on her way to France within the week.  They've got it all arranged, she'll be staying with Lupin—'
Draco might have inclined his head slightly, though Harry could not be sure. After Draco took his seat, the rest of the Slytherins dispersed to theirs. Silently, each of them began getting ingredients and inspecting the instructions that Professor Kothari had left on the board.
She looked at him curiously, as if love were a place she had always considered going on holiday. 'It sounds nice,' she said. 'My dad always said that love was a special kind of magic. Why? Do you want to be?'
When he arrived in the common room a good ten minutes later, Hermione took one look at his face and began rummaging in her bag for the bottle of dittany she always had on hand; after their trials in the forest, she kept it around, Voldemort or no Voldemort. 'Daub this around your eye,' she fussed. 'It should help the swelling. Harry—'
Ron looks as if he's inclined to disagree, so Harry jumps in.  'Then what do we do?'
'Doge, then,' he said. 'Come on, how do we get there?'
, he couldn’t escape. Turning, he expected the routine pity and anxiety that had colored everyone’s faces since they returned from the Department of Mysteries. However, what he found was Ron beaming up at him, eyes sharp with excitement.
Ron snorted. “Him? More like a suspect. Moody probably just scared him half to death, did you see him? Looked ready to piss himself.” He grinned widely, more cheerful at the idea of a terrified Malfoy.
'Well, o' course we all wan' ter see yeh back, Harry,' Hagrid boomed, 'an' you, Hermione, an' Ron too! Professor McGonagall told me straightaway.'
“I want to know,” Harry insisted, stepping closer to him, though he was careful to avoid the broken glass. “Draco.”
He hadn’t told Hermione what he had decided, yet, though she had owled him twice; Harry had said simply that he was getting to know Draco. Which was true, in a fashion. He was becoming very well acquainted with the way Draco squirmed under him when he put his mouth on Draco’s neck, and the exact way he hissed if Harry pulled too hard, and the swollen sight of his lips when they’d spent all afternoon kissing. He knew well the touch of Draco’s long fingers curling around his cock, and the sensitive spot just beneath Draco’s hips, and the way he shuddered against Harry, eyes squeezed closed.
Sirius's lazy fall. Cedric's last smile. The flash of green. His mother's eyes. Seamus’s arm around his shoulder, an easy camaraderie. Dudley’s piggy grin. Sirius . . .
'Oh,' Harry said, both relieved and embarrassed to have an excuse, 'I'm, well, I'm meeting Cho, actually.'
Cho saw him smiling and must have thought it was due to her story, because she looked pleased.
'The Weasley girl,' Malfoy pointed out. 'Chang. Hmm. Loony Lovegood.'
Harry laughed. 'I'll keep that in mind,' he said.
try to be on time for once, will you?'
"I'm not," Harry said. After a moment, as if to prove his solemn interest in the matter, he said, "How old is Benjamin Wilkes, anyway?"
?' he said loudly. 'This filth hole? Are you trying to poison me, Potter?'
'I wanted to meet you,' Harry says.  'I never knew who you were, sir.  I wish I had known.'
'Oh,' Harry says faintly.  Everything goes sliding into place.
Ron and Hermione both looked at him suspiciously, and Harry was terrified for a moment that they had both guessed about what had really happened between him and Tonks. “Like I said, I have to find more ink,” Hermione said, after a moment, and Harry let out the breath he’d been holding. Ron added, “I promised Seamus we’d go to Zonko’s, but maybe later.”
'Harry Potter's secret dark side,' Malfoy drawled. He made it sound like a front-page headline of the Daily Prophet. 'I ought to owl Rita, she always likes to be the first one with a scandal.'
Still, he wasn’t taking any chances. He wrapped it back up and crept from bed to lock it in his trunk. Whatever damage it could do there, it wouldn’t get to him unless it breathed fire. And the little figurine looked stationary enough to him.
'Let's be reasonable, my dear boy,' Doge pleaded. 'The war is over, and the people of Britain deserve to feel safe in their homes, to go on in peace without these reminders of what was.'
“You can call me whatever you want,” Harry assured him, and then saw the smirk unfurling on Malfoy’s face and amended, “Within reason, that is. If I say it’s okay.”
“Oh,” Harry said, thrown off, “yeah,” and told Dumbledore quickly about the dream he had had, as well as Hermione’s deductions. Throughout the whole story, Dumbledore nodded, and behind him, Harry saw many of the portraits listing just as keenly. He felt almost as if he were testifying before the Wizengamot again, so many eyes were on him.
“Potter,” Draco said, sounding furious and desperate all at once, and without warning, he seized Harry by the robes, wrenched him forward, and kissed him.
'Malfoy Manor,' Harry advised the little owl, who hooted softly and gave Harry's thumb an affectionate nibble. 'Make sure you get it to Draco Malfoy, all right?' He had always been sure that Hedwig understood him, but now he realized how foolish that was. 'Go on, then,' he said, as his owl hooted once more and shifted on the windowsill.
. . .
“You know,” Ron said to him, leaning on him as they made their way to the door behind two older, lanky wizards, both of whom were wearing leather jackets and wore their hair as long as Ginny’s, “I thought I saw Malfoy here awhile ago. Malfoy!” He laughed and his breath smelled of alcohol. “Funny, huh?”
“Oh, loads better,” Hagrid exclaimed. “Got in an awful fight with a centaur, bellowin’ like yeh wouldn’ believe, but he’s healin’ up splendidly, the lad—bin thinkin’ abou’ givin’ ‘im some company, come ter think o’ it—"
'I know,' said Harry, 'lunar fish, remember?'
He cast a disgusted look in Harry's direction and added, 'By the way, my present will be the best of all and Teddy will like me the most of all. There's no use fighting it, Potter, I'll be winning this one. Leave it to the natural Blacks, will you?'
'I don't believe you.'
It could not possibly work. It could only end badly.
Pansy looked at him, her mouth set in a concentrated line, almost as if she were asking him a question without words. If she were, however, he couldn't understand it.
Ron looked grimly at his plate. “Is there any other?”
“Don’t trust him?” When Harry nodded, Remus sighed. “Well, in these days, it’s better to be cautious. But I think you’ve found him to be more complicated than the boy who used to pull faces at you in Potions, haven’t you?”
Harry said immediately, “I already told you! It isn’t Malfoy!”
Meanwhile, Pansy began acknowledging him every time she saw him, perhaps out of guilt or in some odd kind of mockery; it always sounded derisive, the way she sneered out his surname, usually as she plowed past him with Daphne Greengrass following in her wake.
'You slapped him,' Harry pointed out, though a second later he remembered that Hermione had been all of thirteen at the time.
,” said Remus. “Go on, Draco.”
'Ron,' Hermione warned.
'It hasn't disappeared,' Harry said. He was almost surprised.
. How long could it really have lasted?’
“Hi,” Harry said, glancing around before stepping closer to Draco. “That was some match. Even if Baddock couldn’t keep his hands off Morag’s broom—and that Bludger that Goyle hit to the crowd—"
'Oh, how do you know?' Ron begins, waving a hand at her.
'I'm sure Hermione has it under control,' Harry began, but just then, Ron gave a small cheer and slammed the window shut with one last gust of cold air and the first couple snowflakes.
Draco snapped, "What?"
"At least you dance better than you did at the Yule Ball," Draco snorted. "I'm surprised the Patil girl survived."
'Hi, Harry,' she trilled, putting a friendly hand on his shoulder and making him wonder if love potions could be transmitted by skin contact. Hermione really did have him paranoid.
,' she continues, 'and we could use some help, and since Hogwarts isn't open right now—'
He leaned over and slipped the parchment to Hermione and Ron; down the table, Ginny frowned at her porridge but did not look at him.
An hour later, when the common room had emptied for dinner, he was still sitting there. When she marched through the portrait hole, Ginny didn't look surprised. She walked straight up to him, as if she were holding a certain number of words and had to deposit them into his lap before she lost one and they ceased to make sense.
Malfoy looked at him and did not say anything, his eyes strange, unreadable, gray and alive.
'Dobby knows, sir!  Harry Potter, sir, Dobby knows who the Secret Keeper is!'
'Not the summer hols that one year,' Andromeda said. 'Sirius wasn't at that year's Christmas but no one had said a thing, remember? I tried to ask our mother where he was, but Regulus kicked me so hard I had a bruise for weeks.'
'I'm going to be sick,' Harry said, and tottered out into the sunlit Diagon Alley without a single Galleon in his pocket. By the time he had recovered enough to re-enter Gringotts, Griphook was nowhere to be seen, and the sword had vanished with him.
“I still don’t—" Harry began, when it hit him. He glanced from Tonks to Dumbledore and back again. “But, why? Why
'Thanks,' Harry said, doubtful himself, and slipped out down the stairs.
'It's a long story,' Harry said. Then he smiled at her. 'Listen, I'll tell you later. Want to go for a walk around the lake after lunch tomorrow?'
“GO MORAG!” Padma shouted out, right in Harry’s ear, and he jumped. Theodore looked similarly put out, though he merely brushed snow off his lap and stared disinterestedly at the Slytherin goalhoops.
But did he know how not to hurt him? Was that what this was?
“Oh, my mum was never part of it,” Tonks said, an unreadable expression crossing her face. “She said that she couldn’t bear it, facing her choices like that, coming up against Bellatrix or Regulus and having to fight them. I still remember them fighting about it in the kitchen one day. Sirius called her a coward and then my dad punched him. That’s all I remember.”
Draco turned back to give him a withering stare. “Potter, I haven’t played Gobstones since I was twelve. Is that what you Gryffindors do for a good time?”
“Harry?” The voice was familiar but strained with urgency, and it startled Harry badly. His wand was in his hand in an instant—he could think of no one in Little Whinging save Mrs. Figg who ever called him Harry—and he leapt from the swing to see Arthur Weasley standing there, looking tired and anxious, with lines of worry creasing his forehead. “Harry,” he said again, and then, “Here, put that away, we don’t want anyone to see.”
She looks up at him with pain in the wetness of her eyes, both admonishing and startled. "D-don't be silly, Harry. This is my career. I never would have been made Minister if so many competent people hadn't died in the war. I'm lucky, and I'm glad I was able to have a hand in reconstruction."
Malfoy's mouth was slippery and hot and to Harry's embarrassment, he could hear himself groaning.
'And apologize.  You have to meet the people I want you to meet and apologize for killing Dumbledore—'
“I don’t know,” he said simply. “I didn’t think about it.”
'I was joking!'
'More than that,' Harry says.  'Dumbledore woke up.'
To Harry’s discomfort, Tonks wasn’t the only subject of the rumors fiercely circulating. More than one first year pointed at him and whispered as the night wore on, and he distinctly heard the words “You-Know-Who” passed dramatically along the benches. By the time students began streaming for the entrances, he was more than tired of the fearful awe their gazes all carried. And, to his acute embarrassment, this fearful awe changed to awe and jealousy when Tonks happened to pass him on their way to the exit.
Ron is eyeing Malfoy with distaste, and he says warily, 'Harry, you aren't Dumbledore.'
"Yes, Hermione?" Harry feels odd, addressing her like this, when she is pacing before him so obviously alive and he is but a mess of pigment on canvas with a touch of magic.
Across from him, Draco’s eyes seemed to be asking the same question.
Harry said, 'And—Penelope?'
'A fact for which Goyle will never forgive me,' Malfoy sighed. Then he said, carefully, 'If you haven't noticed, Potter, I'm not exactly chasing after Penelope Clearwater.' When Harry opened his mouth, Malfoy continued, 'Besides, Weasley seconds, how revolting.'
'Well, being an Auror certainly isn't the only path to success in the Ministry,' Hermione hmph-ed. 'Regardless, that settles it, doesn't it? Oh, please, Harry, you must come back with us! I don't think I could bear Hogwarts without you.'
“I don’t want this,” Harry pushed on, feeling as if his heart were pounding in the back of his throat. “I can’t stand this, you won’t even look at me, and I want—"
'Wait!' Ron says, jolting Harry out of his thoughts.  'Harry, hey!  Didn't you make Kreacher and Dobby follow him?  Didn't you have them tail him to find out what he was—'
“My, my,” she said, blinking watery eyes up at him. Ron looked utterly taken aback. “Young man, it appears we are standing under a bunch of mistletoe.”
It was another week before Hermione could pull him aside and inform him that the dragon didn’t appear to be dangerous at all, or even magical. It did, however, seem to be rather expensive. “What on earth did you buy him?” Hermione had hissed. “Harry, this is worth a lot.” When he’d told her about the quills, her eyebrows had shot up. “This could pay for far more than a handful of quills.”
But before Harry could answer, Ginny and Natalie landed with thumps beside him, and Ginny immediately seized him. “Harry, are you all right? You scared us so badly—we thought you were going to die—do you still have the Snitch? Oh, Harry! We won, we won!”
'Why me?'
But it is not Ron who reacts first; he is too busy recovering from the shock.  Hermione is the one who, before Harry can even pull out his wand in self-defense, has both Harry and Malfoy slammed against the wall, iron bands circling their wrists, with one shouted spell.  Harry feels as if he's just been hit by two Bludgers at once, and even Ron looks taken aback by Hermione's reaction.
'I think we could have been good,' Ginny said, sounding subdued. 'Really, I do. But your heart isn't in it now. You leave me out and you say you're trying but you aren't, not the way you would—you did—before.'
Harry looks at him, his pointed features, the spots of color rising in his cheeks.  'We'd have to Obliviate you,' he says again.  'But I—I promised.'
Tonks gave him a strange look. “Harry,” she said, almost softly, “didn’t anybody tell you? He was killed the first week in July.”
A prickle of guilt started in Harry's stomach, though he had never been close with Lavender. 'How was it?'
'He does not!' Harry seethed. 'He does not get to me!'
“Look, I did change my mind,” Tonks said, more quietly, when he said nothing. “I was worried, I found you—I was going to help you, I was—"
This, this was interesting, this experimentation—it was like mapping out a new continent, spread out under his hands. He learned the way Draco’s lips moved, more gently than he’d expected. He opened his eyes, once, and watched the shadows play over Draco’s eyelids, the soft angles of his cheekbones. Harry pulled on his bottom lip gently with his teeth. He slid his tongue hesitantly against Draco’s parted lips until they opened and Harry pulled him closer, swept his tongue into Draco’s mouth. He remembered the sounds Draco made, the way he moved into Harry, the way his cool fingers slipped up under Harry’s jumper and settled around his hip, and the way that made Harry’s stomach squirm pleasurably.
Harry persisted with a frown, “But it’s not a weapon! It doesn’t help me any. And loving somebody doesn’t change a thing.”
'Luna and I are friends!'
Again, Draco hesitated, as if he were planning to answer sarcastically and then thought better of it. In the end, his eyes tore away from Harry's and he watched his hands as he spoke. "I'd never had many real friends. My mother wanted to keep her only son as 'her baby' as long as possible. Excuse me for wanting to make some. I don't see why you keep harping on it. Get it through your thick head, not everything is about you, Potter."
“She called Goldstein chubby,” Ron continued to snicker, folding the paper and sticking it into his bag for posterity. “Ha, he is getting a bit round, isn’t he?”
