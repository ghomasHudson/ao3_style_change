"Yeah, Dean was too," Ginny snorted. She pushed her hair out of her face and leaned closer to Millie, the moonlight illuminating her cute face and turning it delicate, almost like something from a storybook. "So you have strong opinions on that? What does it take to, er, be cut out to be someone's girlfriend, then?"
It didn't feel real, someone else speaking of his circumstances. It had to be his own voice in his own head where he had been isolated for so long. It was like this was not Grindelwald but some figment of his imagination, with the choice of Grindelwald to voice this derision no doubt psychologically interesting. "I was drunk," Draco said in dazed defensiveness.
"He wanted me to 'stand alongside the Ministry'," Harry said, voice coming out so low and husky it sent a shiver down Draco's spine. The always-sharp scent of Harry's magic was so thick in the air, it almost felt stifling, curling around all of them in the aftermath of a burst, only made stronger after an explosion. "Talk them up, put on a show, make it look like they were working to fight Voldemort, when they're
Sooner or later, everyone will choose a side in the coming war, and a wizard of your strength cannot hide when that time comes. My wish is to delay that time a little longer. For when you cannot... I
Flitwick seemed fonder of Draco than expected. Draco thought back to showing off charms for Umbridge during Flitwick's review. He
Draco considered this. "Um. Yes?" He squared his shoulders, forcing himself to look Father in the eye, though it was difficult. Less difficult with both of the wands in his hands. "Father, I just don't want you to choose the losing side. You don't
what you hear, isn't it? Because you never knew your mother, and your father is pretty much your best friend, and losing him is your worst nightmare." Theo was like Luna in that way, oddly enough. Theo
Luna hadn't understood the innuendo, just as the Gryffindors hadn't understood she meant it literally. "She means the dragontamer
"Yes," Draco said, no point in hiding it. Gilderoy was more talkative than you might expect for four am, but then again, he must be starved for human company.
Draco managed not to draw his wand right in her face, but it was a close thing. Still, a number of people shrieked and ducked behind others at the sight of his wand in his pocket. Cho broke off, paling. "You wouldn't," she said hastily, looking to regret every word spoken in the irrational haze of heartbreak. "You wouldn't- curse me or my tongue, you can't, I'm your house's Seeker, about to play for the cup-"
Draco's attention drifted then, as the ritual of Voldemort making Wormtail his silver hand began, with all of the ceremonial show of magic and bowing and scraping and pitifulness. No doubt it was fascinating to the Death Eaters, but Draco knew what the end result would look like. What he didn't know the end of was Harry Potter, who was tied there almost forgotten. Draco stared at that pale still frame and saw those green eyes not dazed or hopeless, but rational, listening and registering everything going on. Those eyes had not given up.
Draco had shared more than one of those with her, in nauseating attempts to suck up to her in fifth year during the blue loop. The sight of her sent the nauseating sickly-sweet cough syrup taste of the rose syrup she put in his tea into the backs of his nostrils.
Draco smiled thinly. "I prefer the more controllable variety of reptile myself," he said, and held up his mother's enchanted watch to show Hagrid the snake as it took shape and coiled up. Then he cast a spell to conjure a butterfly made of light, and showed Hagrid how eagerly the snake swayed towards his wand and licked at its end right after it had done magic.
One by one, each of the boys formally introduced themselves. "Tony," Draco echoed. "Terry. Michael. Stephen. Kevin." A more white-bread, generic, British set of names had never been heard, but maybe that was for the good. You expected dark wizardry and treachery more from someone with a name like Gellert Grindelwald than your average garden-variety Kevin. "Charmed."
past. The blue loop, she had said, would transfer to the traveler's mind, and only live there. But he couldn't even speak about that memory, or let it out into the world in any way? What kind of enchantments had been on that mirror?
"Draco," a voice said, as an upperclassman came hustling incongruously into their dorm. It was Peregrine Bole from the Quidditch team, looking even less happy to be there than the boys in deep conference were to see him. "Draco, you have a visitor. A Gryffindor."
"You never would tell me what your Boggart was," Potter said thoughtfully. "And neither would the Slytherins." Lupin's gaze was going between Draco and Potter, with what seemed overt curiosity about the two of them. "I cornered Nott once to ask him, and he said that it should be obvious. That even having to ask meant you didn't deserve to know
history." She started to giggle at the cross look he gave her. "Don't worry, I won't remind your parents. Your mother was already shocked to see the bracelet you made me. Why didn't you tell me it was a replica of hers? She went and got the original to show me."
"It's just something for you to wear," Draco told him, "For luck. Like a knight going into a tournament. You're supposed to have something like that, or you were back in old times. A favor." Harry looked blank. "Like you have
"Fine!" Draco shoved the two fatal lying weapons into either pocket, as he faced the two fatal lying men. He pulled his last weapon out, one he understood rather better. "Did you keep the memory?"
"I know!" he yelled back, and turned to the vault with renewed determination, taking in each individual clump of items and casting Aduro occuro and Aveho defixio over and over on each. He let the clamps all loose on the talon wand, and could feel exhaustion setting in steadily, like he hadn't felt since fourth year, from the effort of burning the dark magic off by sheer brute force. This kind of magic did not come naturally to him, and he couldn't do it in en masse like a real Curse Breaker. But when he heard clankers returning, they were soon met by the sound of a chattering Harry Potter along with several goblin voices, pestering them about the dragon there- and then, yes, insisting on telling them the story of when he had fought a dragon in the Triwizard tournament.
"Shut up, shut up!" Pansy yelled, cheeks red with a look that Draco knew from experience meant she was fighting back tears. "Of course Draco doesn't like her!"
"I know," Dantanian sighed, eyeing the merveilleux with such greediness, it seemed there was room for little else in his head. "My name is Dantanian Noir, my mother's name is Astarte Noir, my grandmother's-"
It became noticeable as the days went on, though, how much Sirius wanted to destroy everything related to his heritage, and how little Draco wanted to allow it. Harry was quickly no longer the angriest at Draco, as Sirius met Draco's defense of various Black items with mounting frustration. It got to the point where Draco finally did have no choice but to go in league with Kreacher. Things like perfectly good fine china were at risk, simply because they had the Black crest and motto. "Just because the family was a certain thing in the past," Draco argued, "Doesn't mean you can't change what it means now. Isn't that what you're doing housing the Order here? You don't have to throw everything away, just clean it-"
"That saying you can never trust a Slytherin, which I hope you are not about to give me grounds to believe?" she hissed. "Frankenstein, I'm getting a very bad feeling about this..."
." He felt the air go ice-cold between them, which was good. Let her be thrown off-balance by the absolute discrepancy in class she had to feel between them, even if he was in disgrace with his famous family at the moment. "You make such interesting inventions, after all."
"Was it Aunt Bella? Her Cruciatus is worse," Draco blurted. He realized his slip a second later, and thought to add that he thought so because of seeing it cast on Harry. But Severus seemed too tired to question it. "Severus, I'm so sorry-"
That awful impulse made Draco pocket his wand. He took his hand off the hilt of it in his pocket, however comforting it felt to stroke it. He'd already made more than enough of a mess, literally as well as figuratively. The Slytherin dressing room looked like it had been hit by a very invernal apocalypse. The temperature felt ten degrees colder inside, even though there had been so much hot wind. Everything was a wrecked mess of green robes in tatters and blasted snakewood, fragments and splinters all around Draco where he stood in a center whose last feet had him untouched, nothing but the usual immaculate floor.
Harry rolled his hips down against Draco's more slowly, and then quickly again once he got another taste, bucking down in one unending wave of athletic thrusts, rhythm speeding with their breath. Before Draco knew it, he was the one gasping out the other's name and falling apart.
"Enter," said Severus, and Karkaroff of all people came waltzing in. Severus crossed back over the room to stand over Draco protectively.
"And what happened to Longbottom's parents, Malfoy?" Crouch demanded, and slammed his fist down hard on Draco's desk. "
I will be the only soul in this house for hours." He wrinkled his nose. "Well, there's Kreacher, but he's been confined to his room, he doesn't count. So if you ask how I can take it upon myself to try you? By what right? I'll tell you.
"What have you done, Draco?" Severus cried out wretchedly. "You promised me. You promised me! What have you
," Draco demanded, and pulled at Harry's robes. Harry moved to help, and in the motion, their hips rubbed together. Maybe this didn't count as going slow, but it was slower than Draco
Hermione found this attitude backward, and was not shy in saying so. She attributed Potter's moping mental state to his purported difficulty at summoning charms in Flitwick's class, one that alarmed Draco far more than her, given how vital Draco knew the summoning charm would be to Potter in the First Task. "You've been able to do summoning charms since first year," Hermione sighed. "Do you think you could give him some extra help?"
," Draco said, and poked him in the shoulder. "What is messed up is your ostracizing Hermione over a bloody broomstick. I've told you before, but I'll tell you again if you want to hear it, it's not a
He imagined his mind as a Black Dagger, with the obsidian catching every gem-like glint of flame, and plunged it into the fire of the blood moon.
Draco turned and the Elder Wand was still there and his hands dropped to the floor too and he threw up again, gasping retching not dry for once with the sobs that were streaming out of him, and it was hard to believe blood was not starting pouring out too, the blood of a snake...
Use these rings for it or don't, it doesn't matter. There isn't a speck of these not repurposed from your family's old jewelry."
"Gilderoy, ssh," Draco heard himself saying, actually stroking at Gilderoy's long tousled mane of blond hair. "It's alright. You can cry. I promise it's alright. And you're not a fraud. You still
Neville didn't look angry at him, though. Slowly, he crawled over and hugged Draco around the shoulders, before stumbling back to his own examination station. Harry did the same, before letting Draco head over to a sobered Professor Marchbanks, who had to live with it on her conscience that she had been forewarned and still caused a riot. Well, in her defense, Draco could have been more specific.
He waved the sleeve of his robe in neat derision, a dreamy motion of flaring ebony feathers and fur beneath, even as his words made an approaching Dorian nearly spill his lychee nectar all over his diamonds. Dantanian could not, in truth, had stood out any more at the gala if he had come naked, to say nothing of his light arrogant tenor voice that carried so well. "Daniel," Dorian greeted. "You look..."
It sounded like good reasoning to Draco, who had also discovered the usefulness of the storerooms as a good emergency place to be alone, albeit before with Harry. With Harry, though, he was terrified of Severus having some invisible alarm tripped and showing up any moment, whereas Severus had all but openly endorsed their Slytherin festivities. So he cast Sanguirenere, nowhere near drunk enough to mess that up, at least not yet, and conjured him and Theo green and silver cushions, and seats rather like Muggle bean bag chairs, along with bluebell flames above he happily tinted green with Colovaria. Then he slumped into his pouf beside Theo and took the sake, giving it a sniff. "Since when are you a sake person, Theo?"
"Draco, is Mr. Potter here bothering you?" Severus had come back into the classroom. Draco knew his schedule well enough to remember the prep he would be starting, a second-year class with Slytherin and someone else, that began rather soon. Severus would need them out of the way, even if they hadn't also happened to be his favorite and least favorite student, perhaps both in the entirety of Hogwarts. At least, Draco liked to tell himself being Severus's godson gave him that privilege. And Severus had been taking the time to teach him some things during his detention brewing sessions, so he must like Draco a little. Even though Draco had robbed him.
Except Aberforth made a pretense of meeting him for the first time, and Remus didn't seem to question it. "I know who Draco Black is," Aberforth said gruffly. "I read the papers, me. And he gave an awfully grandiose speech in the Hog's Head once." Remus gave him a look of bright interest, far more comfortable there in the snow-dusted rubble than anyone else. "About how Harry Potter was a god or something, I didn't listen too closely. Is he the one who's going to convince me?"
Well might he, as the pulsating roar around them was proven not just be the ringing and water in Draco's ears, but a crowd, from a distance. Draco remembered complaining about how poor this task was as a spectator sport. Now he had missed it entirely.
Grindelwald had to process a particularly large mouthful before he could answer. Draco wrinkled his nose and conjured him a napkin. Grindelwald used it and ate and talked on, full enough of life to make anyone who believed him an easy mark think twice. "Small hints, like for your pureblood status. And my deductions, like those of that Muggle detective you named. Sherlock Holmes. You've laid them out for me like delightful breadcrumbs, beautiful young ghost."
"I've looked," Harry said inanely, and kissed Draco's neck finally, teeth dragging there in a way that made Draco's toes curl against Harry's ankle. "I don't know- tell me what you want-" His lips kissed at the skin over his own initials, and moved them out of the way, so as not to miss an inch of skin without taking it off. He nuzzled at Draco's shoulder finally, senseless with affection, even as his weight on top of Draco was irresistible, the stabbing shape of his arousal the most of all.
"Langlock," Draco cast lazily. Gilderoy covered his mouth when a rather porcine snort forced its way out of him. Meanwhile, Karkaroff began to wave his arms in incoherent outrage. As the only individual there without a wand, they were safe to ignore him.
speaking. It gives you everything you want. The omnipotence of wishing. It changes reality to be what you wish it was. It's the power to make your desire real. Or at least...
Ron whined until he got scared, and then he was quizzing Draco about whether there were werewolves in the Forbidden Forest.
Theo read the note in front of him, as Draco had known he would do. "What is this?" he said, all the vagueness and nicknames stumping him.
"Draco, we've been so worried," Remus said, crushing him in a hug from one side. Sirius, usually less physically demonstrative, was even more enthusiastic, seizing him too to mess with his already tangled hair, until he made Draco flail at him.
Draco turned to Father, expecting to see him at least somewhat mollified, by a relatively pristine Potter offering a hand. But Father was staring at Draco instead, with a look that was generally unreadable, but tended to portend some form of ill for his son. Belatedly, it occurred to Draco that Father might not have relished the sight of Draco cleaning up Potter. Not only because it was servant's work, but because it made Draco and Potter seem closer than they actually were.
Draco met up with Ron and Hermione in front of Gryffindor Tower. Potter came out to see them off with the air of a terminally ill patient with only hours to live, whose parents had just sneaked out to go eat a large chocolate cake without him. "Don't worry about me," Potter said, "I'll see you at the feast. Have a good time," in a voice that meant anything but. He followed them to the Entrance Hall up to where Filch was checking the list that wouldn't have him on it.
- we are sorry, Danny. It seems that now, we are the only family you have left. How old are you precisely?"
About a week into their production of the potion, Hermione nervously informed Draco that she had read it was illegal to brew Wolfsbane without a license from the ministry, and that the Ministry liked to strictly track the potion. Draco just looked her straight in the eye, and asked her if that meant she wanted to back out. She sat there quietly for the whole time they were removing the flowers from the large batch of aconite, and then finally said no.
Luna looked quite bitter at Trevor, for getting to be the one who spent the Hogwarts Express ride being pawed by Neville Longbottom.
Hermione stayed firmly behind Draco, not risking him touching her. Then Wormtail was staring up at Draco, who took his wand back out at feeling that gaze on him.
"So," an unimpressed alto voice observed, as Millie's face once again came into view behind him in a mirror. It was his enchanted floating pocket mirror, which she seemed to be eyeing with contemptuous disdain. Millie's sole concession to vanity was an enchanted floating item of her own: a bucket that trailed underneath her dripping hands, which had black gloves on them but seemed to have outstretched their capabilities long ago. "From the sound of that, at least you're getting
But he couldn't show any weakness to this blockhead blowhard, so he climbed the steps by himself nonetheless, walked past the entrance three times thinking,
Harry looked supremely awkward, beginning work on the pod so noisily he was clearly trying to save himself from having to listen. He cut a sharp contrast with Draco, who'd sidled closer not to miss a word. As well as Neville, who seemed to have gained a taste for eavesdropping.
"I didn't mean to," Draco muttered, as Potter and Ron turned back around squinting in pain. "You don't know how hard it is with this bloody wand not to just explode everything in my path-"
"Avenseguim," Draco whispered. The wand gave a physical pull in the air towards where Hermione stood. She could not feel it in return. She passed out of his range of sight soon enough, but he could feel it tugging still, leading outside towards the Quidditch stands.
"Alright, my presence is urgently requested," he sighed theatrically. "Hagrid, Luna, always a pleasure. Neville, you're lucky you're my favorite Gryffindor..."
No, Harry would never know, nor Severus, nor- Merlin, nor would Hermione. Or at least Draco wouldn't be there to see them learn it.
New Year's Eve, when 1996 turned to 1997, the year where Dumbledore died and Hogwarts fell. At the moment, the only thing falling was Draco, onto Harry's lap with breathless laughter, trying to goad Harry into more than they were doing already, Harry's fingers finding him already wet and prepared for him. They had in truth accomplished little else since their first time other than experimenting with their newfound freedom with each other. But after all, Harry did consider New Year's Eve their anniversary. Better than the day Cantankerous Nott had died, even if that was when they had really taken the step to
Draco found his helpless feeling attenuated with Harry's attention fixed like this, lovely and desiring and caught. "I just want to," Harry breathed, "Help make you feel better..."
The bad news was, Sirius asked Harry to be his best man. The good news was, it didn't truly count as being one-upped, since Draco was asked the same by Remus. The members of the wedding parties quickly filled out once June started and the solstice advanced closer, the growing heat and sunlight testimony to the turn of season that would mean the excitement and risk of Sirius and Remus's joining. Draco and Harry were the only literal men in the party of groomsmen, which filled out as Tonks and Hermione for Sirius, and Alice Longbottom and McGonagall for Remus. Neville and Ron were to be ringbearers, and Ginny and Luna were to be the flower girls. As for Fred and George? Against everyone's better judgment, the esteemed proprietors of the sensational new business Weasley's Wizard Wheezes had been hired to DJ the afterparty.
"WHAT?" Harry screamed, thrashing in his bonds. "No, Draco, what are you doing? You're not like this! You're not on their side! Please, please say you're not-
Draco smiled at her a bit weakly, reaching out and flicking fondly at the turquoise bracelet on her wrist before answering. "Of course I do. It's one of the cornerstones of alchemy. It's supposed to be able to turn any object to gold, or grant the owner eternal life." And it sounded exactly like something Voldemort would want. If he was back yet, which he wasn't, but still-
, didn't it? Whoever had picked the Muggle clothes- Draco suspected it was Sirius- had a better eye than Draco had ever given him credit for. Or maybe Harry was just that gorgeous. He looked fit to be the groom himself, with Sirius finally getting his silver tie properly in place. He straightened his glasses and smiled over at Draco, and Draco stumbled over Ron's fancy white shoes.
Something cold slimed its way down Draco's spine. He told himself it was January wind, but he still wrapped his arms tightly around himself, against its bone-chill. "Why would Theo be happy?" he asked, more softly than he meant to. He felt his teeth chatter, like his warming charms had been mere empty noise. "You think something that would make
in the end." Severus eyed Draco like this was an accusation- seeming to sense, correctly, that Draco must have more of a vested interest in the case than he was letting on.
"I completed many experiments with it over the years. I did not only make and control Dementors, I controlled the moon. For instance, I could summon a false blood moon if I wished, if not a true one. Oh, you wouldn't believe how it makes poor unfortunate souls tremble, to watch the cackling, diabolical dark lord blot out the moon and turn it red!"
"No," Lupin said, with a shake of his head. "No, I didn't know." In Lupin's position, Draco didn't know if he could have forgiven Sirius that, then. Let alone so much else. "And it makes things clearer, to know you have heard the story of Sirius's great mistake. I
Draco's hands shook and he dropped his mother's wand, while Luna slid off her box. "I want to see in the mirror," she demanded. With an indulgent sigh, Hermione let Luna run forward. She offered Draco a hand up, and he leaned against her shoulder, watching Luna.
nepotism. It means the awarding of positions based not on merit but by personal connection. Except if we're going to talk merit, maybe I'm the captain because I'm the first Seeker in a decade to catch the Snitch all
All the Gryffindors engaged in a spontaneous midair hug, except for Ginny. As much as she made Draco nervous at the best of times, when in the same country mile as Harry, it was worth any price of admission to watch her plow her broom straight into the commentary stand, wrecking the lot and sending Zacharias Smith crumpling in a daze.
"Aguamenti!" was Draco's answer to the idea of running, but it was too late when the entire street looked to be on fire. Spells and curses were flying at them through the wall of flame he'd raised, and then with a Deprimo from Williamson, a wind was blowing through the center of the fire, blowing it right into their faces and leaving a path in the flames, like the sea parting, for the three of them to charge back through, right at them-
"Nothing- I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts, too..." Potter looked at Draco worriedly, as if he thought this would be news to Draco, poor clueless sod. Draco just nodded.
By the time Ron and Hermione were at the door, Lupin behind them, Severus had seized Draco off the ground and pressed his wand to his throat.
"You want me to put you back on it?" Draco asked doubtfully, and Sirius bit his lip, looking uncharacteristically boyish and bashful.
," said Black. "It's your old master's lot you fear. They aren't very happy with you, are they? You've been hiding for twelve years from Voldemort's old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter... they all think you're dead, or you'd have to answer to them... I've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went to the Potters' on your information... and Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort's supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they? There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they've seen the error of their ways... If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter-"
He had been grateful for the vials of numbing potion from his mother. But they didn't last long, and now he would have preferred a Sleeping Draught, or Dreamless Sleep if he could come by it. Even with a Muffliato around his bed and a Spelunca Secure keeping the curtains closed as tightly as an imaginary room with virtual walls, he felt irrationally no less secure against observation or intrusion. He'd slept with more charms than these on his bedroom, in the months of Malfoy Manor's occupation, and still not felt safe, although any sane person would be more afraid of a great hideous rabid snake man and his merry band of lunatics than the looming unknown. But there had been comfort in a way, to knowing death likely to come so soon. And even the soul-thinning constant terror of Dementors outside insufficient walls had became monotonous too. He was more adrift than ever, in the same bed from seven years ago, protected by charms he hadn't known, kept awake by a worse pain than this young back had ever known, and fears he had never known either.
Draco's body brushed Potter's, side to side and knee to knee, inevitable in a space this unsuited for two growing twelve-year-olds. He felt his own breath on Potter's neck, as he squirmed to try and fit, and found them face to face. He had thought he would be taller than Potter after the summer, but their growth spurts had hit them about the same. Their faces were too perfectly matched for Draco not to have to turn his face aside, noses brushing as he twisted his head away.
Aberforth looked so wracked with the shock of it, he seemed beyond tears, blue eyes dawning with something Draco realized he had never seen in them- something almost like hope.
"Draco," Harry just breathed, broad shoulders tight with tension. When Draco looked down, it seemed Harry's desire was more immediately pressing than he had realized. Draco stepped between them, not wanting anyone else to see just
-" Severus's eyes shot up as they went into the pub, to fix on the slumped form of a clearly drunken Aberforth, groggily serving one of his few grubby customers behind the bar. His spectacles threatened to slip off into the mead, before he clumsily righted them.
"Veritaserum," he blurted. This he had actually brewed before. In the summer after Dumbledore's murder, the Death Eaters had set Draco to filling their stores of it, with Severus far too busy and important to do it. He had failed at it so many times in a row back then, he'd thought they would call Severus in to do it instead. But Aunt Bella had just taken it upon herself to personally punish each failure, and it hadn't taken many more tries to get it right.
"Draco!" Harry screamed, as the power of Severus's blasting spell skimmed past Father and Mother and caught the side of the threshold, which caved in a great groaning of rock into the water. The rebounding splash soared out at all of them, and Harry shoved Draco and Grindelwald with him to the side just in time to avoid being fully soaked. Draco couldn't tell if the water caught Harry and took his magic from him, leaving him helpless. There was no way to see through the hissing brilliance of the silver-black water. A moment later, Grindelwald was the one stumbling to his feet and helping Draco up, dragging him to the right away from the floor which seemed in danger of completely caving in. A cutting curse sliced just where they had been, leaving further rock scored with the marks of the battle, and the vindictively exacting flash of the cut had Theodore Nott's name written on it. They hadn't stopped Theo from coming for them, if anything could stop him now.
"Right," said McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door. "I'll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?"
Harry seemed to hate the reminder of his own vulnerability. "You don't think you all could have done that better from here? No, I guess there's only room for one new
"To get the Longbottoms back their wands," Severus finished, in a voice like he didn't believe it for a second. "Potter was insistent upon this point, yes. He seemed intent upon painting you as some earnest do-gooder who was blameless in all proceedings. And the wands
"But what?" Draco whispered, already having a guess. It seemed he didn't need Occlumency to read Harry's mind, as Harry leaned in and breathed in his ear,
Aberforth regarded him with those unsettlingly bright blue eyes for a long interval. "Aye, and you imagine that," he gestured crudely to the Polaroid, "Is what I had in mind?" Draco managed not to flinch. "I can't imagine how you ever managed to get into that godforsaken place, let alone get that monster to cooperate with you. You shouldn't believe a damn word he said, you know. Not a one."
was the one affected." Draco did not respond to that as he had seemed to hope, no defiance, just buried his face in his knees, wracking up and down with sobs. "You are overreacting. I am perfectly fine. Do you think I have never been tortured by the Dark Lord or his followers before? An occupational hazard of the spy, a common one..."
"It's true," Sirius had said, staring up at the open sky as they arrived in mid-afternoon with Weasleys still levitating up blue fairy lights. "In Azkaban, I did miss the sky. Almost as much as I missed Remus's voice..."
From Draco's best visual estimate, they were seventh or eighth cousins. Maybe. Draco could trace closer lineage to almost every Slytherin in his year, including Pansy, who had thought she and Draco were destined to be wed since before they ever even met.
"As a matter of fact," Draco drawled, "I had been hoping it might placate this unreasonable woman into admitting me to the festivities." He jerked a thumb towards the slumbering Fat Lady. "But she proved
Mr. Weasley was obviously going to be fine. Draco couldn't see what all of the fuss had been about. Honestly, a part of him had to be resentful. Oh, Nagini had been merciful with this notorious blood traitor, but when it came to Severus, the best and bravest man that ever lived, she had to be on point? Nagini? More like nigiri, for how Draco would preferably make use of her. He'd eaten snake before- tasted like chicken- but never raw. Sashimi, maybe, with some avocado and eel sauce... was Draco getting hungry, waiting for the Weasleys and Harry to finish their sentimental visit?
Elfen was the word for Potter now, standing amidst the hubbub and bustle of Diagon Alley, so ethereal it seemed only right for him to be the one apart, watching but not part of the children's meaningless chatter. Potter'd had a birthday since they last met. The image Draco had so obsessively fixated on over the summer months, Potter wielding the bloodied Sword of Gryffindor, changed to wear this older face in Draco's mind.
Draco's ire raised. "No, you whiners, it's Viktor! Viktor Krum!" he exclaimed, in his rough but eloquent German, most skillful in it when he was angry. "So get behind your captain!"
Draco nodded, eyes going back to Sirius's part of the tree. "Oh, yes, Great-Aunt Walburga. She must have been so
"What did he mean?" Draco asked Severus, once Sirius had become a dog and padded out. So that explained his presence at Hogwarts. "For not torturing Harry?"
"The Malfoy name," Draco said tightly, "Is a hindrance to me, not a help. But I wouldn't expect someone of your limited intellect to understand-"
"And Ron can't come," Hermione said, "So it will just have to be us. Rita, will four be good enough to fill in about Harry and his life with friends at Hogwarts?" Skeeter nodded, laying out a piece of parchment for her quill, with an arm deliberately in the way between it and Draco so he couldn't curse this one too. Draco stole a look at her hands, but they both looked unburnt by now.
Well-built, handsome features, the same laugh as her, even the same waves in their black hair- and Draco had to lie to explain himself, he had almost forgotten...
"Shall we test it?" said Seguinus, and flicked his fingers in Gilderoy's direction. Gilderoy yelped and tried to scamper away, but Seguinus held him fast to his side with his other hand. No doubt, he'd left more marks. The water touched only Seguinus, but Gilderoy was shaking from head to toe.
to let Severus down, taking on more projects to distract himself from his duties as Slytherin captain. But he had promised to do the rings for Sirius and Remus already, and hoped she would be amenable to at least giving him instructions for a direction to take. She
It was annoying to have to admit the dueling lessons, but preferable to suspicion about, say, secret potions, so Draco explained their lessons to Theo, who could not have been more unimpressed. He kept nagging to the point where Draco called him a Hufflepuff, at which point Theo lay down beside Draco to fix those sharp blue eyes on him, full of unusual disquiet.
Draco felt an ear-splitting grin take over his face. "Here, come closer! Impervius!" he cast, and the rain seemed to land on it a little less brutally. She reached down and squeezed his wet hand from the bottom of the stands, before his other hand was seized by a very drowned-looking Pansy.
"'Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn't want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become- whatever it is the world
"It's totally a crush," Ron said eagerly, leaning forward in his excitement to mock Hermione. "She surrounded all his classes with hearts in her timetable." Draco made gagging noises, miming a fit of debilitating nausea, and saw Potter try to hide a smile. "And that's not all! She knew all the answers on that quiz about him-"
"Unless there's something else that Grindelwald could tell you," Draco said, none too subtly. "That only he could tell you."
In the middle of the night, caught stealing with two wands pointed at him, his back on fire, seven years before his own time- and yet Severus's sibilance, rising from calculated dullness to a crescendo of perfectly pitched disdain, felt like being washed in sunlight.
She was right about Harry having it hard. The next day, Draco was shown a truly extraordinary letter by Ron, which proved the point so well it made him grateful for Neville voting with his feet. "Check out this codswallop," Ron said briskly, "You're the only one who hasn't seen, you can burn it or whatever once it's done."
Severus caught himself at the broad rounded stone edge of the Pensieve, staring at Draco like they were dueling and he needed to find an opening to make his escape. "You would not do that. Not to the Order. Not to your uncles, or your friends, or your lover Potter-"
Draco couldn't even follow what he was saying anymore. "Charlie Weasley was a champion Seeker. And they say he's gay and good-looking..."
"What your Boggart was- what memory you use for your Patronus- why you needed those blood magic books- why you don't think you're good enough- how you knew about the diary in second year, who taught you Occlumency, Draco, you never tell me a thing! And you never told me about you and Nott! But now I've seen! You don't have to tell me. I
The discovery of the Eurydice myth had felt like a watershed. It had pushed Draco into action, even confronting Dumbledore. But he couldn't explain to Hermione how vital their research had become. He pinned his hopes on the Black library. They would figure this out with intelligence.
"And how long," Mr. Diggory said, joining Crouch in staring down Draco, "Have you been with Mr. Malfoy tonight?"
Draco happened upon Potter with his bag broken, trying to gather up his supplies to flee. He was immediately recognizable, but Draco played it off as though he had happened upon this charming tableau by chance. "What is it, Potter, what's going on?" Draco asked in his most innocent voice. But the sight of him seemed to fill Potter with, if anything,
"Much to my eternal inconvenience," Severus grumbled, and turned back to give him a wan look. "Oh, don't make that face, boy. If your father's tongue proves overly unkind in the weeks to follow, I do believe you might know a curse to stop it running."
They stayed up later than they should have catching up. Luna seemed sad to have been left out of it all, but the prospect of clearing Sirius's name the way the three of them had vowed had her in high spirits. She, for one, didn't seem to think failure an option. Draco, always unduly nervous about events unique to the red line, was not so sanguine. But he feigned it, and made her laugh so hard, they were both clutching their stomachs before they went to bed.
"Okay, okay," Draco said hastily. "Just please stop embarrassing yourself, you don't know how traumatizing this is for me personally. So you want us to have a thing to do together?"
"Yeah," Sirius said, closing his eyes for a moment. "Yeah, you're probably right." Severus's eyes shot open in disbelief. "I was reckless, because it was you, and because I was always reckless. It's hard to understand who I was back then. It wasn't... it wasn't good. It wasn't the man I
So if no one else was going to tell Potter to use a summoning charm to get his broom, well, Draco would just have to be the one to do it...
Draco's heart stayed in his mouth, as he watched them both soaring high after the spark of gold. He wanted his boyfriend to win, and besides, his pride could not stand it if another Slytherin Seeker did in a match what Draco had never done fairly, and actually beat Harry to the Snitch.
It was a crossroad then in Lupin's haunted eyes, which Draco had no more power than if he was dead to affect. A fork in the road, and to one side, calling Hagrid in and telling him he'd caught Sirius Black, and to call the headmaster, or perhaps
"Don't you miss Harry?" Luna asked one day, and he considered ejecting his cuddle-cousin from bed like some Muggle sci-fi escape pod. "I would miss Neville if I didn't see him all the time."
"You have a water-beetle in your hair, Hermione," said Krum, and Draco stared at it, wondering if it was Rita Skeeter, then flicked it none too gently away.
Explaining that he'd threatened essentially to burn off Umbridge's hand wasn't great, but it was better than Harry thinking he'd performed ungodly favors for Theo to weasel his way out. "You don't have any trust in me at all, do you?"
"The Dark Lord kept any knowledge of Bellatrix's activities with Theo from me," Severus began, in a tightly-drawn, furious exhalation. "I believed him grieving but harmless. You allowed me to think him so. I allowed him back into Slytherin, as his Head of House- I took him on as my student in a NEWT-level Defense class, after he had told
"Is it to just kill Grindelwald?" Ron asked. "So if we can't get the mirror, no one can? I mean, he's a-"
Umbridge's face went despairing then, and more hateful from that despair. "You're lying about the brand."
Draco tried to dart right into the house after Periander, but Hermione caught him by the elbow. He thought she would tell him to be careful and not get himself hurt, but her concerns were more pragmatic. "We're here for evidence! There's no point if we destroy it trying to catch him! Don't set anything on fire!"
"There, Winky! You couldn't see anything if you wanted to! Aren't you less scared? Your master can just vanish it when he comes and needs the seat."
"Draco," Draco said obligingly, choosing to leave off the Malfoy, and found himself losing patience with Potter's ridiculous kneeling, perched like an officious house elf waiting for orders. "You might as well sit down."
"I haven't had more than one person to celebrate Christmas with since my mother died," she said, and presented Severus, to his astonishment, with a present from Luna herself.
"Alright, Gilderoy," Draco said evenly, not resisting a natural step towards the appearance of greater closeness. That would provide an additional compulsion towards obedience for Lockhart, apart from the magical and hierarchical. No,
There was a price, almost immediately, to that unbroken illusion of happiness. He received a warning letter from Skeeter the night before, claiming she'd had no part in the story and tried to stop it- reading between the lines, it seemed to all add up to
"I know you well enough to take that as a compliment," Harry whispered, and pushed up the bottom of his mask to give Draco a kiss before putting it back into place. "And I wouldn't mind going to the underworld if you'd be the demon waiting." Harry made a noise when he pulled back. "Have you been drinking, Draco?"
"I was trying to see if his wounds were real, and how bad they were, nothing more," Karkaroff snapped. "Because if his father had truly beaten him, that would mean the rumors about him at the Quidditch World Cup were
, we all know it was even if you won't admit it- because you won't tell us things, not even Hermione! You really hurt
Draco's mind shut down. "Harry," he said softly, falling back against the wall. "You can't- bloody hell, you can't just
Draco drifted off that night with a smile, at the thought of poor Luna pining over verbally limited Neville. Draco himself, after all, must really must have written her too florid and verbose letters in comparison. But as he drifted off, happy to think of Luna rather than Harry's test tomorrow, a thought crossed his mind that made that subject no safe haven either.
"I didn't realize," Dorian said icily, "I thought he was pureblooded, because he had long hair," and followed his friends away. Dantanian didn't watch them go. He looked back at the ceiling.
Severus stared at him with a look like his godson had just decided to renounce magic and become a Nepalese goat-herder. "Who is
But Luna could catch her drift, and answered, bright and honest, "Narcissa Malfoy. It was very nice of her."
Draco ran forward, trying to see where in the piles of stone Harry had been felled, and he could make out a small figure in luminous white, unmoving beneath rock and ash-
Umbridge took one last shot, give her that, though if she'd had any sense, she'd have been trying to get him off the stand as quick as she could. Bad enough she'd already been laughed off half the way to the Fountain of Magical Brethren. "Can you deny, though, Mr. Malfoy, that you have at your young age earned the reputation of a very dark wizard?"
Dobby looked queasy, and shook his head resolutely. "Dobby is a Gryffindor, yes. Dobby is very much a Gryffindor. But Dobby is never, ever, ever being
Or he was just a self-absorbed bastard, and something bad had happened to someone he cared about- Ron, Luna, Dobby, Hermione- except then Harry would be nearly as involved- but if it was
"Dobby," Draco whispered, pulling him aside, "Did you really decipher it like that? Or are you just trying to help Potter?"
"Have you been listening to a word I said?" Draco groaned. "Rather than being so self-righteous, Hermione, try thinking about what
Draco got up and leaned out of the window, trying to let the icy air calm himself, trying to tell himself murdering Grindelwald would be counterproductive. However much it would make sense to add another life to his tally with Death, and how damn good it seemed it would feel at the moment.
"And that precludes jealousy?" Draco asked in exasperation. Maybe Potter wouldn't have been suited to Slytherin after all. "Never mind, Potter, just take my word for it that it would be good for you two to have some different hobbies, alright?"
"I don't know," Luna sighed, her new catchphrase. "I suppose that in a way, it's almost scarier, because it's real and it could happen..."
"What," Potter laughed, raking a hand through his hair self-consciously, "What are you so scared for, Draco? It's not like I can do anything to discipline you."
Luna had lit up at first, but then she looked doubtful and guilty. "I had hoped for that from the start," she said hesitantly, "When I heard there would be a ball. That it could be like last year. But I wanted you to have the chance to have an actual date. And then you kept saying how much you didn't want to go at all, and I didn't want to impose..."
Draco expected laughter, but none of it came. Instead, a few stifled giggles turned to an uneasy hush, as students seemed to process the implications. Maybe there couldn't be amusement when a Valentine also called him the petrifier of his fellow students.
He was woken by lips to his forehead, not kissing but slowly drawing across it, warm breath like a benediction. They could be no one's lips but the ones he loved the most. "Harry," he breathed, and so it was. He heard his own name issue in return, startled, from that beloved mouth, as if not expecting him to wake so soon. Then their faces were close, Harry leaning over him and staring down as if Draco had unveiled some secret to him.
Please, Mr. Black, never hesitate to make use of this channel to request any favor. I am anxious to repay you however I can. Even if it would be impossible, even were I not an exile, and- one must admit in good faith- an individual with a more narrow skill set than alleged in my published works. Severus has informed me that any assistance of mine is "less likely to improve than imperil"- such a way he has with words!- but I fear his assessments seem colored by a distinctly personal dislike. If you have any advice how to redress whatever wrongs I may have done Severus, I would be anxious to follow it, and languish in his displeasure no longer.
"Hermione?" Potter frowned. Draco once again feared for the survival of the wizarding world, if its fate lay in the hands of blundering clueless fools like Potter, or worse, Draco himself.
"Hermione already told us," Potter went on, "That you wrote to say you're sorry. But you're asking too much of
Mr. Weasley pulled Potter aside before they boarded, telling him the things he'd already overheard, which made Potter very cross when Draco told them he wasn't going to sit with them on the train. He'd already kicked a huffy Ginny out of the compartment, so when Draco kept walking, Potter went running after him in the corridor. "Draco, we need to talk about this. I need to tell them, and Mr. Weasley told me more..."
The others let the subject die, and the party gradually regained its former festive cheer with the aid of Butterbeers. But when everyone was leaving, Harry volunteered to stay back with Draco and clean up, moving the trophy cases back into place. "Draco," Harry said, taking his hand and staring into his eyes intently. "Draco, was that story really all true?"
"Oh, bloody hell, sorry," Potter blurted, practically threw her at Draco, and fled the Slytherin dorms like Imoogi really had been the monster of the Chamber of Secrets.
He was selfishly glad he had not seen this memory before speaking to Theo. What could he have said then?
"Thank you," Hermione said, "But you shouldn't have worried, Draco, you know you blow everyone in our year, everyone in the
Yes, Hermione was missing out, but she deserved it for continuing to hang about trying to bring around those uniformed cretins she called friends. So he didn't tell her about what he was learning, and only braved invading the Gryffindors' new library table during Easter holidays, when he heard them discussing electives.
Black's reflection looked appropriately remorseful. "I couldn't help it, Draco, after I saw him fall, and his broom blow away into the Whomping Willow. I saw the chance to do something for him, and to use the Black fortune for good for once. I didn't think to tell you before. I'm sorry. But if we can clear my name, I can tell everyone I got it and that it's safe..."
"Why would you have said nothing in your defense?" Fudge asked, looking unmoved, and Draco realized,
"Serpen-" Draco began, as quickly as he could, but Potter was already locked on for the kill. Lockhart barely even finished saying go before he had sprung forward.
Severus gave a groan when Draco said he had drank both of the draughts of peace he had given him as Christmas gifts already. He said he would give Draco a small supply to have on hand to take as needed during attacks, as well as calming draughts, and a tea of fermented Valerian to take regularly.
, her captor. She had spoke to him and smiled at him in her cell and been calm and patient and kind...
Flame appeared between them, a sharp forked blue shine of the burning tongue hissing and hissing like its dead lungs could choke on their own smoke. Smoke was rising everywhere, up from the corpse, from the end of his wand towards it where they were bound by it, the black inky thick evil smoke of the talon wand. But it was cut through everywhere by the moonstone-bright scintillation of the Mirror of Espilce, finally tearing open the scales from beneath and letting up great smoking flickering bursts and pillars of fatal light.
"Take care of Draco," was the last thing Harry said to any of them, laughing as he pushed Draco into Hermione's arms, before the call came for the champions to head towards the maze. Molly Weasley gave him a firm, motherly hug, and they all called out their wishes of luck, before Harry had to turn and leave them behind.
Longbottom still had more designs on Seamus's life than Draco had ever had. When Draco intervened to prevent Longbottom from melting his third cauldron in Potions, Severus was angry enough at him that he almost withheld the first batch of Angel's Infusion. Not quite, though, once Draco cheerfully reminded Severus of the time he sent Aurors after him, which had to be counted a slightly greater blow to godfather-godson harmony than the transgression of saving a Longbottom.
Jordan's eternally biased commentary descended then to shocked obscenities as Astoria hurled the Quaffle right past Ron into the top hoop, with Ron's eyes still fixed on where Theo's hands had just been holding it. And it quickly became clear just how little Ron had needed the stirring chorus of 'Weasley is our King' to underperform in his first ever match.
"Oh, hell," Draco hissed, and looked reflexively towards the toilet stall where they kept their cauldron hidden. But Krum didn't catch his stare. He only had eyes for Hermione. "Viktor, this isn't what it looks like..."
"I saw it in Dumbledore's Pensieve," Harry said softly, "In the trial of your aunt. Draco, this is... oh my god, you said Neville's here? He must be..."
He'd actually surprised Grindelwald. You always knew when that happened, because he'd stop running his trap for more than a second or two.
He felt 11 again, though, staring at the distant form of Potter, ready to choke on his breakfast out of a half-acknowledged, corrosive sort of envy. Before, he had begrudged Potter the attention, as he seemed to be getting now, other Gryffindors congratulating them with rumors spreading through all four tables of the heroic exploits of the great Harry Potter, and how the newest points he'd won from Gryffindor had been for taking on a twelve-foot mountain troll before he was even twelve years old. Draco remembered listening to this rubbish the first time and sniping to Vince and Greg how unimpressive it actually was to take on a troll, how he could have done it all alone and probably better. But it wasn't the notoriety that made his chest hurt now. It was the sight of the trio properly joined by their ordeal, which sounded just the sort of thing to knit a friendship that Draco's influence had clumsily wounded. And Draco had thought he would be fine, turning to a walking ghost, pretending not to exist, purposefully situating himself on the outside looking in. When he had thought Severus would be sending him back to 1998 days later. But this was forever, without even Slytherins to comfort him with false praise.
Young men often experiment with unusual attachments, out of youth and inexperience. Whether this indiscretion is a mere act of childish rebellion, or something more serious for the Chosen One, only time will tell. "I don't think it will last," says Mr. Black's former housemate and Quidditch teammate Millicent Bulstrode, a sturdy girl. "Draco is not a loyal person. If Harry Potter doesn't get away from him soon, Draco will destroy him."
"I'm sorry, dear, you did warn me," she said in a low voice. "We'll just leave that section off your exam entirely. It's safe, everyone! Remember, we're testing the students on Boggarts!"
"Sorry!" Harry ran back to get the talon wand. He shrunk back when Draco began to wave his wand and make a humming song over the cut, casting Vulnera Satentur. "What's that?"
"Calm yourself," Severus said, composure drawing around his harshly lit form like a veil. "We should go elsewhere to speak. You should not be wielding- if that is flame at the end of that thing- around relics..."
" Draco shrugged weakly. "And what are these reports I hear, hmm, of you changing places in a chess game with Mr. Weasley, to save him from taking the role of a sacrifice? Have you lost your wits? Is St. Mungo's looming in your future?"
The first time Crouch did it to them was at the start of October, though it repeated over the next few classes. Draco had heard talk of the fluffy things the Gryffindors had been made to do under the Imperius, like singing and animal impressions, but the Slytherins did not have it so easy. Tracey Davis was made to kiss one of Crouch's spiders, Pansy got on her knees and crawled from front to back of the room, Daphne pulled Pansy's hair, Millie held her face in a bowl underwater, and that was just the girls. Greg had to eat a cave spider whole, Vince put Blaise in a headlock, Theo had to sing a song about Gryffindor, and Blaise was made to get on his knees and kiss the bottom of Pansy's shoes. Of all of them, only Blaise showed any success in resisting the first time, jerking about awkwardly in front of a humiliated Pansy's legs, so it was more a sequence of humiliations than anything. And then was Draco, leaving the best for last.
"Get off me, Potter, you cheat!" Draco spat, trying to squirm out from under him. Potter didn't dispute the cheat remark, just pinned Draco's arms securely back under his knees again. Either Weasley really hadn't explained duels properly to Potter, or Potter just felt justified in this case. Always content to bend the rules for himself, that was Potter- who had his tongue spelled silent, so that did explain the lack of retort.
"He's the only reason my daughter is alive," says Mrs. Sofia Alba, the wife of the Catalan minister, and devoted mother of Miss Alba. An attractive woman of thirty-seven with long dark hair, Mrs. Alba's large black eyes brim with tears as she pleads eloquently for mercy in her native tongue. "I can never thank him enough for the miracle he accomplished bringing our Maria back."
"It's, um..." Draco leaned in very carefully to avoid breaking the Statute of Secrecy. He was almost completely sure telling this man would not be breaking it. "Enchanted," he whispered dramatically, and Hermione rolled her eyes.
"If there's another attack, I think this looks like my father would try and blame it on you. Maybe you should run, Hagrid..."
"What?" Harry let go of him to rake a hand through his hair. "That wasn't about Quidditch and we both know it. Not that Nott is good enough to be on your team to begin with-"
"Draco," Sirius said, reaching out and grasping his shoulder tightly, "I'm your uncle. Well, your first cousin once removed- I'm your blood family, and since you've been disowned, it only makes sense for
Draco?" Severus drawled, looking truly amused by then. Perhaps he hadn't been asleep yet when Filch came to get him. "Interesting your mind goes there at your tender age, when the traditional pastime for the Astronomy Tower is
The knocker did not disappoint, as the melodic voice asked its riddle for the night. Draco did not think he had to have a persecution complex, to think it might be intimating its opinion on the artist formerly known as Draco Malfoy. "Why is an evil man like a worn-out shoe?"
"Oh, we found some Periander family records. Dorian married Lamia in 1895, and they both died early- I forget when, not too long, after the turn of the century- well, Lamia didn't
The amount of homework the teachers were piling on was getting to Potter and Weasley. They were nearly always at Draco and Hermione's table in the library over break. If anyone had asked- not that Draco tended to exchange more words than necessary with his old pureblood friends- he would have admitted that Granger was his friend because of her exceptional intelligence. But he'd say he just barely tolerated the presence of Weasley and Potter for her sake- that he would, in fact, sooner call
"I don't know how to reverse it," Draco said, the first words he had ever spoken to his first cousin once removed. "I've tried before and it didn't work. This wand just has a will of its own."
Hagrid choked on his remaining tea and cake. "Anapneo!" Draco cast quickly, and soon he was faced with a wide-eyed Hagrid rubbing his throat and staring at Draco like he'd seen a ghost.
"Oh," Draco sighed, and let his head fall happily to the grass below him, as he began to laugh. "Don't worry, it's
Draco have been able to hear anything from the distance he had been, in a vast loud hall full of chaos and confusion? Had he even imagined it? Could he have just heard what he
"Well, we're all safe from the Dementors now, Draco can do a Patronus," Harry bit out with positively un-Gryffindorish sarcasm.
"What is it?" Sinistra asked, and Draco reached into his bag at his side for any calming or peace draughts and found he'd already taken all of them. And nothing would change the unbearable fact that Dumbledore had died because Draco was a coward. Wormtail's voice was speaking, from his own mouth,
I have told you of the circumstances of our son's birth. I can still imagine your horror, as you wrote back denying what I saw with my own eyes. You said it must have been a fire from somewhere or someone else. You even accused my mother, with her fresh in the ground. Since years have passed and you will not put aside the idea of her guilt, you must know the truth. Tell no one of this, and destroy this letter as soon as it is read. This is the truth about our son Dantanian.
It felt like the entire hall fell silent, people gasping and nudging each other. Draco could see a knot of his Slytherin yearmates stop moving at the far side of the dance floor, looking utterly stunned, probably not by what Percy had said, but at who he'd had the nerve to say it to, and so publicly. Draco looked around, and expected Severus to charge up and give Percy the tongue-lashing of his life, if not worse, but he was nowhere in sight. So Draco took a deep breath, stepped back, looked Percy up and down, and sneered.
The Gryffindor that Father speaks of is indeed Muggleborn, by the name of Hermione Granger. She is a rare exception that proves the rule to the general unworthiness of her foul-blooded kind. My mother and father would do well to acquaint themselves with the name, as while you have taught me of the importance of blood purity, you have also taught me of the importance of recognizing an extraordinary opportunity when it presents itself and seizing on it, for such may never appear again. With the exceptional discernment native to a Malfoy, I quickly deduced upon first acquaintance with the first-year Hogwarts class that Granger possesses an intellect and ambition that will lead her to prominence in the future. She is not only the brightest witch of our year, but the brightest wizard, probably of all years, and quite possibly of our generation. She may be Minister of Magic someday. If you and Father find this judgment precipitous or outrageous, I look forward to the passing of time to prove me correct.
"Because I heard him confess it. His old friends asked him why he had turned on James and Lily Potter, and he said it was because he had been scared, and it hadn't seemed like there was any point in trying to fight You-Know-Who back then."
? At best, you're buying Harry's lies, and at worst, you're covering for him because you helped him!"
He answered honestly in his head, trying to tune out the low murmurs of the hall full of people he was once again keeping waiting.
"Do you think I'm afraid," Dantanian said disdainfully, "For people to hear me talk about gods who desire sex with mortal beings, and pursue coitus by mystical transformation into swans..."
Finally, Harry let Draco take off his glasses. Then they kissed with true abandon, green eyes turning to hazy pools before they were too close even for that, eyes shutting. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, kissing him with everything in him, and felt Harry's hips try out a rhythm down on his, the same frenetic pace as he was kissing Draco back. "Don't come yet, Harry, don't..."
"No," Dantanian said, and turned to the boys he'd bound. "Not all of you will be old enough to understand this. Cygnus definitely won't. But you have the right to know, that
anyone you like! Can Snape say the same? Could he torture his godson? If you ordered him to kill him, would he?"
"Bloody hell, Draco," Ron called as they hurried along, "You're really upset, aren't you? Do you know this girl or something?"
"Okay, this part is tricky. I could just get in myself, but to let Muggles into the wards, I might have to go old-school..."
Even if it was hardly recognizable as such. It more closely resembled the plans Gilderoy had found in the library tower. Towers cut the morning sky like raised blades, disrepair and crumbling visible but standing still. Obsidian adornment curled over the roofs of towers and rooms and halls, gargoyles and arches and designs like stucco that caught ocean sunlight with violent clarity. The castle was not whole, but sections were, entire groups of towers with roofs over them. As lonely and forsaken the fortress looked, there was also something inviting to those halls.
"Yes, she's the only one I told, she's helping me," Draco said, and winced and added as quickly as he could, "And, um, Luna Lovegood, so anyway, if you can really promise me, Severus-"
before Severus contemptuously banished him from his sight. Or at least he tried, but then there was a knocking at the door.
But he didn't. Ron, Luna, and Hermione all came visiting every day, and went on walks with him to the kitchen and the Great Lake, while he recovered his strength and his will to be seen by other people. But Harry was nowhere to be found, nor did he answer an owl asking to talk, or any messages passed to him through their friends or Dobby. If Draco had been braver, he would have hunted Harry down. He still had the Marauder's Map. But he just watched the Harry Potter dot on it obsessively, like a great Horklump. He didn't even have the nerve to go to meals in the Great Hall, which he knew Harry was attending. There would be people there.
"I probably just scare you too much, Neville, you'll do fine next time if you're paired with Luna," Draco told him as they headed towards the exit. They had to mill around, waiting for Hermione with the Marauder's Map to direct them out in turn.
cautious, but you, you can be so overconfident, and reckless- I just got this terrible feeling looking at him, I can't explain it..."
Luna Lovegood did not make an appearance during the feast, which cast the one shadow over it all. But she appeared the next day at the entrance to the Slytherin dungeons, asking a baffled Vince if her cousin was inside.
now. If you were so desperate to meet me in secret in the middle of the night, Potter, you didn't have to make up all this nonsense about
"Blood traitors! Blood traitors and pariahs and polluted perversions, dirt in the blood and the fall of magic, blood traitor to the House of Black-"
"One hopes," Severus said coldly, "That in the future, a boy of your talents will find more constructive ends for those skills than crafting unnecessary presents for his godfather."
Hermione cast her spell wordlessly, but Draco knew it was her, by the precise way the snakes around Periander stopped tightening, even as Periander kept moving. It took another Petrificus totalus, freezing Periander as well, to make apparent just how exacting she had become: the snakes had been her initial target, not the wizard. They both were laid prone and helpless now in their tableau of dying vines and twice-ruined stone in winter, the serpents binding Periander's limbs and extremities like a set of ropes. Draco was pleased with that state of affairs, but Hermione was not.
Apparently the Ravenclaw blue and bronze didn't register. And Draco couldn't exactly tell her it was for Gilderoy. "Please, I just need it wrapped."
She sat up slowly, her limp, dry white hair in wisps around her face making her look far older than her skin would suggest. But her eyes were old, dark and sunken in her gaunt face as if there was the accumulated weight of centuries balanced upon the pupils, forcing them backwards into her skull. He had hardly seen a more haunted-looking woman, even counting actual ghosts- he presumed this patient was alive- and yet there was almost something familiar about her. She opened her mouth, and Draco presumed she was about to tell him how they knew each other, but no sound came out.
Draco got up, turned on his heel, and walked away. He let his steps take him where they wanted, and where they wanted seemed to be inside the castle, where the coming arrival of night made the broken towers cast long enough shadows that he could retreat unseen. He felt crumbling stone under his feet with every few steps, in between his expensive leather shoes sinking into mud and murk and green, cracking cobblestone or fallen rubble. But he kept walking, until the sound of the distant music and revelry was softer than the impact of his vicious feet on the weak stone.
The appearance of Harry seemed to make the Patronus disappear at once, as if happiness inevitably died beside him.
Hermione shot Draco a sharp look at that, but soon all four were caught up studying, which was a very good thing. Draco had paid so little attention to re-learning the blue loop's material, as well as new material for Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, that he would have been far from second in the year, maybe closer to the bottom, were it not for an enforced hospital stay with little to do but study and sulk. And Draco turned out to very much need their help, or at least Hermione's help, when reviewing for those new classes, along, of course, with History of Magic.
"I don't know," Draco bit out, an icy rage surging in him suddenly as he stared square at Pansy, finally able to meet her scrutiny with Luna and the first-years gone. "Why
"Everyone said I'm an enabler," Harry said miserably, "For your bad behavior, after we went to Gringotts. Hermione said I don't question you enough. That I let you get away with so much, just because I..." The next time he paced by Draco in the small room, Draco pressed him down into the red armchair. Harry let out a soft oof, and then exhaled more sharply when Draco seized his shoulders to keep him there, leaning over with green firelight swimming over both of them. "Draco, what are you..."
Draco kissed Harry, and Harry let out an anguished groan and kissed him back so hard it stung his mouth. Draco welcomed the lash of it, the ache like a testimony that Harry was here, was real, that he wanted Draco back. He pushed Harry off him, but only to sweep out the blankets from between them. Then he pulled Harry on top of him, grabbing onto Harry's back and arching up against him. "I'm yours," he gasped against Harry's mouth. "Everything you want, it's all yours," and wrapped his legs around Harry's waist, locking their bodies together.
"Right," Draco laughed. "Of course you don't want my Aunt Bella, and not just because you're queer." A rage like he had never known filled his lungs like bile.
Harry's face relaxed into pure fondness. "Okay, then, who is it who I've caught?" he said playfully, stroking Draco's wrists and rubbing at the pulse point with his thumb. "Is just 'dragon' alright? You
Voldemort surveyed his father's graveyard like a newly founded kingdom. "How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?" he whispered, and Draco thought of his own father with a flash of new terror, not sure whether he was more frightened for him to come or not. "And how many will be foolish enough to stay away?" Who would Draco watch die first, Harry or Father?
"Or," Dantanian countered, "The secret could be that there is no secret. But you'd have to use up one of your years to guess that."
Draco shuddered at the mention of Severus' new mission as a spy, but tried to maintain some continued facade of strength for Severus. "And Harry... he's okay? He's really okay? Sirius said, but... everyone, even Dumbledore- they want him to lie for me about the graveyard? To take all the blame for this? As if he didn't have enough reason to hate me already... can I see him?"
He had to hesitate, though, when the sound of unusually young voices made Aberforth Dumbledore appear from behind the bar. He was like some nightmare version of Dumbledore from an alternate dimension, elderliness making him seem decrepit rather than wise, a Dumbledore who had fallen on seriously hard times and never crawled out from under them. He was also, clearly, a committed alcoholic, in which case Draco could only mentally congratulate him on having at least had the sense to find himself the right profession.
you, Severus. Never against you. If I had my way, I would never have lied to you, not once in my life- I am sure you wished you had never had to lie to your godson about the memories, as I wished too, but things can all get so muddled-"
"It's blood magic," Draco reminded her. "Dark, dangerous blood magic that I'm totally unqualified for-"
"I can only speculate," Severus said unhappily, "But I deduced much from evaluating the memories from a perspective of incentives. Dantanian may have chosen them in a rush, soon before whatever mad act he committed that made Astaroth change, or he may have chosen at leisure. But he meant them for Dorian Malfoy, and he meant them to communicate some certain things." He looked at Draco, and it was almost like they were having one-on-one extra Potions lessons again.
When Draco opened his mouth again, guilt threatening his chest so much it felt it could clog and stop it, Gilderoy raised a hand. "The wards won't let anyone but me in
"You've been staring at that blank page for the past half hour, practically," Granger commented unhelpfully. "Almost longer than your Sorting." That earned her a baleful glare from Draco, finally forced to look up from his notebook by her annoyingness. "Oh, is that a sore spot? I thought it rather interesting that the hat took so long. Apparently it's called a
Harry looked like he desperately wanted to kiss Draco, a vibration between them like a pull at a tightened red thread linked invisibly between their hanging fingertips, as real as the line from Dorian to Dantanian.
"Is that how you see yourself?" Harry asked, looking genuinely troubled. "You're dressing up Luna and Hermione as goddesses, but you, you're some demon fallen from grace? Not a god-"
He managed to coax everyone out of dueling that day, insisting that they all ensure their Patronuses were in working order after Lavender Brown proved as colossally useless with making one as she was at not getting mauled by werewolves. Brown got frustrated at Draco goading her, and demanded to see his Patronus, which he had never shown. Which wasn't at all because he still wasn't completely confident in his ability to produce a Patronus right on call.
"Everything you can," she echoed, closing her eyes. They were still tear-swollen, though she'd stopped crying a while ago. "Which means there's still more you're not telling me." She seemed to find it almost beyond belief, and yet undeniable.
As for Sirius and Remus, Draco sent a long letter, and received a letter back from both of them, which was an apology as well. It was an apology for seeming to support Harry at Quidditch and not him from Sirius, and an acknowledgment of the validity of Draco's feelings with deep regret from Remus. Both of their handwriting had its place in the rambling letter, which ended in reassurances that Draco was wrong if he thought that they took him for granted and didn't care about him, and that they would try and prove it to him going forward. Draco could tell himself the damage he'd done to those relationships had healed. He tried to forgive them back. But it didn't seem he could make himself forgive what had really angered him at all of them in the first place.
"It's also called the Room of Hidden Things." Draco grabbed onto the wall as the mead hit with a belated strength. "Stands to reason that's where
Without the length of Astoria's hair, Draco might have mistaken her for her sister. She had grown up a lot without Draco noticing. He'd used to sit with her every day, let alone the hours spent every week with the Kingsnakes. Now she was a virtual stranger. If only Theo could be the same.
mind- a mind that had never quite healed from her intrusions, to judge by the dismal indecisive chaos it broke into on Christmas night...
"I really hated you for that sometimes, you know," Hermione said with a sigh, "That denial of yours, it seemed so convenient, so selfish, that you could just ignore the effect you had on him because it was easier for you. But it's not that, is it? It's that you
"Just that," Severus sighed, and then turned on Draco with ever-sharp dark eyes that Draco should have known would grow suspicious, at a blatant display of having received instruction in Transfiguration far past the first-year level. For the first time, Draco felt a push at his shields from Severus. His first instinct was to reinforce, but then he eagerly pushed his power into dropping them, hoping this could defy the will of magic, either causality or the mirror. But shields remained a palpable presence there, a construct independent of Draco's control, and Severus didn't push for long. When Draco opened his mouth to ask him to use his Legilimency in earnest, force his way inside and see everything, his tongue stuck to the top of his mouth.
in the background for that, letting whatever bizarre infatuation for a Malfoy that Harry had mistaken for love wash away, and give Harry the real thing with this pretty, clever girl.
Draco went with the other second-year Slytherins to the match in perfect contentment, grateful to catch the bright flash of orange of Ron's hair from the Gryffindor stands, in just the direction the pull was coming from. He stroked his wand twice to make sure. The voice telling him
Harry's agitation was contagious. "Bloody hell, Draco, are you trying to creep us all out?" Ron asked testily, patting Harry on the back. "How would you even know that? Is it something about the type of snake?"
"Nissy is always watching Millicent Bulstrode practice," Nissy said tearfully, and withdrew something from the rags she wore: a stylized Slytherin badge that Draco remembered all too well. He'd designed it himself.
"You're making that up," Draco protested, but found he had no urge right now to curse anything. Granted, there were urges in him now, different ones, far more complicated than cursing. But he'd gotten used to ignoring those by now. He could control himself. He was sure. Almost.
Doing the right thing this time, it turned out, couldn't have gone more smoothly for his purposes. If only it could always play out that easily.
"Yeah?" Draco said absently, turning the gold Black signet ring in his hand, before putting it back in its great onyx-and-gilt jewelry box.
"You seem to hold a very poor opinion of yourself," McGonagall observed. The more upset he got, the calmer it seemed to make her draw herself in turn. "In my experience, I can say I find it an unjustifiably poor one."
"Draco, who's used the Cruciatus curse on you?" Remus demanded. "Was it in the graveyard?" Draco shook his head bleakly, too out of it to think how he was incriminating himself. "Was it at home at your manor? Was it your family?" Draco didn't say anything. Aunt Bella would count as family, but that was the blue loop. Except when he was this drained, sometimes it was hard to sort out which memories were which between them.
have written me at least once, to check in after you stirred up my aunt and uncle against me. Or did you just mess with them for your own amusement? I can't believe you didn't write to me at all..."
According to Sirius, the security for Citadelle Xaphan was foolproof. Considering that Draco himself was a Black, and yet had not even known they
The distant sound of the party in full swing gave way to a merry furor of voices once they were inside. The voices quickly hit a lull at their arrival, though, heads turning to see Famous Harry Potter. Harry took Draco's arm, to make obvious who his date was.
"Hermione's your friend," Weasley interrupted, "And she would want you to help us, you know she would..." He looked around surreptitiously, then whispered, "Malfoy, do you know anything about enchanted mirrors?"
Frederick was coming back, and flinched, pain breaking out on his face nakedly, while Elizabeth scowled darker. "Because they were
Draco pushed the broom to glide beside Potter. "You would know. You're the one who follows me around in real life, Potter, seems only fair for me to do the same in the air." Potter made a stifled noise, then pointedly wrenched his face away from glaring at Draco to looking for the Snitch again.
his bones were telling him, up to the moon if necessary to get far enough away from what lay below. "Potter, where did you go?"
Hey all! Thanks so much for all your thoughts and comments, I definitely read them all and they mean a lot to me! <3 Hope you all are doing well and have a good weekend! :)
"Did I request your life story, Longbottom?" Severus snarled. "OUT!" Draco began to walk out with Neville before Severus's voice stopped them. "Go send them, Longbottom. If you require emotional counseling for this sensitive event, find it elsewhere. My burdensome godson is staying."
They were more careful watching the Marauder's Map after, and no one caught them after Krum. The only real casualty was Hermione's mood, as she spent the next several days quiet and guilty, whatever the ways Draco and Luna tried alternately flattering her and alarming her to cheer her up. "If she keeps being this sad," Luna said to him after, "We should tell her about the Naufragiam potion. She'd be so upset she'd forget all about that Viktor Krum."
him. "It wasn't me who betrayed them, I swear it, I didn't do it, I wouldn't have ever turned on James, you have to-"
"I don't have the time or energy to transfigure her anything else," Draco complained, though it sounded like lip service to a girl currently wearing a bracelet with Draco's handmade charms containing a Kali yantra, a pomegranate, a Medusa head, a St. Brigid's cross, an ankh, and an H for Hermione. But all this do-gooder business was exhausting for a slithering sort like him. "Salazar be damned. I'll see if I have anything of mine I can just give her."
"Riddikulus," Draco said, lifting his hand, scrunching his eyes shut, "Riddikulus!" He had taken the Felix Felicis, so even if he couldn't have last year, he should be lucky now-
"Kaktusblüte." Grindelwald rose to his feet and touched his shoulder from behind, gentle, almost paternal. They stared together at the narrow sliver of light from outside, like the outside world threatening to encroach in. "Now is far too early for despair. Particularly despair involving damage to Nurmengard's structural integrity that you wouldn't be alive to fix for me. Putting aside that intriguing remark about Dantanian, and the mystery of just
Finally, the witch at the counter was available. Draco chose to charitably assume she was underfunded and that this was the best she could do. Otherwise, he wouldn't have trusted her to assess a fly, let alone Ron's beloved old family pet. "It's my rat," Ron told the witch. "He's been a bit off-color ever since I brought him back from Egypt."
. Dantanian's young face came back into focus, lit by his fingers. From them grew a lazy spiral of blue fire, almost more like mist, though it whirled tightly into a white-hot coil to hover above his palm, as if just to show it could, before dissipating to a more diffused brightness. The aristocratic features of House Black were thrown into sharp relief behind the large doll-like eyes and lips, and the softness of childhood on Dantanian's Patronus-colored face, pale as if he had cast out all the blood in himself along with the fire on his hand. The effect was only slightly ruined, by him having to twist his small neck to get his hair out of his face again.
Instead of finally receiving the comprehension and apologies that Draco's admirable logic merited, the air went if anything more tense, in a dormitory that felt too small for all five of them. Had something worse happened to Granger than he remembered?
Draco gave his ten second-long Severus eye-roll. "Hermione, if you truly believe Uncle Sirius is after me, do you think it was judicious to allow my visit to your defenseless Muggle neighborhood regardless?" She paled as if the thought had not occurred to her. "Used to thinking of our worlds as hermetically sealed from one another? They're not, clearly. If I
"Lamia Periander," Dorian said eagerly. "Burke's had a letter from his cousin at Beauxbatons- you know, the one in first year there with my fiancé- and after he mentioned the smartest girl in their year is a pureblood called Periander, Vivienne Burke said everyone knows the name Periander at Beauxbatons! Did you know the Perianders are exiles? That they've just come to Britain from France, and they can't go back there or they'll be
"I take it, then, I didn't go naturally." He reminded Draco strangely, in that moment, of Neil Palmer.
. He sat himself as far from them as possible without invading the knots of other years. The space for him between Vince and Greg was missing anyway.
Riddle's face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. "So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that's a powerful counter-charm. I can see now- there is nothing special about you, after all. I wondered, you see. Because there are strange likenesses between us, Harry Potter. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself. We even look something alike... But after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That's all I wanted to know."
Dantanian watched as Elizabeth writhed, keen dark gaze all analysis. "No," he said after she stilled for a second time. "No, it's nothing close. I'm sorry, Frederick, but you said it. An eye for an eye. It's so
The abhorrence Draco's family held for Muggles, which had used to seem self-evidently sensible, had led to serious deprivation in his life. "Am I too old to learn?" he asked plaintively.
"Don't stop stroking my hair," Draco whined as his head dropped, enjoying what he knew would be some of the year's last rays of pure sunlight. "And hey, it's not like any of it wasn't true..."
"Are you..." Palmer seemed to be counting mentally, a process that took very long. "You'd... you'd be the age, wouldn't you? Her son."
"Uh, Snakewood?" Theo tried weakly, staring at the entrance as if he was willing it to open. That was stupid. Hadn't Snakewood been one of the passwords last year? For some reason, it stuck out in Draco's memory-
"I've been imagining some kind of gem-work you can't do without magic," Draco said with a sheepish smile. "It's way beyond what I can do, which is why I came to you, Professor. I don't know if you've ever transfigured this kind of thing before, and I know I'm not even in your house, so you don't have to help me, but..."
"You don't think it's special," Draco laughed, "Going out at Madam Puddifoot's, together, you and I, in front of the whole world? My, Chosen One, your standards
"Did you know what he was going to do?" Potter asked Draco, eyes pleading with him to say no. "Did you only realize this now, or have you just changed your mind because you don't want to see Ginny dead?"
"To where?" Hermione said, her adorable squirrel face so full of trepidation, she looked to have some suspicion already, much as she was hoping otherwise.
Eventually, as the crowds of students passing by were getting sparser, Severus came up to Draco's side, dragging his bags for him and looking sour. "Your uncle and his lupine companion," he drawled, "Intend to leave as soon as the students are gone. You'll be walking to Hogsmeade, and Apparating out from there. They've opened the wards of Grimmauld to you as an occupant."
Reaching out and touching his reflection did little to convince Draco that the image in the mirror before him was his own. He remembered his own 18-year-old face in some other mirror, pieces and small fragments in his memory of a brilliantly lit silver mirror with some sort of symbols and etchings, but it was a rapidly fading unreality, save for the wondering recollection that he'd cast a shattering charm and that it had shattered and yet not shattered-
"I, er, yeah," Harry said, faltering. "I mean, I talked a lot to Sirius this summer, over the two-way mirror you sent me, and he helped me figure out... yeah, I like both..."
Draco pushed aside his rationality for loyalty. "He should be thanking his lucky stars to get a poem from COUSIN!"
"Doesn't mean you won't still want to dance with me," he drawled, and bit Harry's ear when he complained.
a dark object that entered the castle. I'd think it could still be that, if it was anyone but Severus telling me it had been destroyed. Because an object like that could possess someone. Anyone, me, you, them, even Hagrid. Ginny Weasley, who was given it. Do you want the truth? Yes, it was my father's, alright? I saw it in a case at the Manor once, and I saw him putting it in Girl Weasley's cauldron in Diagon Alley, but I wasn't sure until I saw it in the common room, and then I panicked."
The dim figure of Harry moved from behind the glass cage, and panic spiked through Draco. "Let's see if it works!" Harry called, and Trelawney's prophecy went through Draco's mind- every choice he had ever made- everything he had ever said or done to Harry to bring him here, to his death, because Draco was his enemy, he was lying to him, holding back
The weather seemed to be holding, as predictions had said it would, for once sunny all day, for an outdoor wedding. When Draco finally strolled back, he found four of the five eldest Weasley boys levitating red chairs over on either side of a splendid golden walkway for the wedding aisle, with Mrs. Weasley and her very much recovered-looking husband at front with Frank and Alice Longbottom. All four were fussing over the arrangement of crimson and amber roses around the wedding arch. They called out greetings.
Unfortunately, Draco's Quidditch-related German was one of his few good areas in the language, due to a childhood spent half-following the German Quidditch Bundesliga. He knew that meant scrimmage, and so it did, as Krum proved rather excited for the chance to have even the slightest competitive play again. They released the Snitch three times, waited, and both searched for it, a Seeker one-on-one, and Krum wanted to play best of three. He won the first time rather easily, so much that Draco's pride was piqued. Krum had spotted the Snitch and nearly finished his dive before Draco so much as noticed him diving.
"Don't do that," Sirius said heavily. "Don't do the what if's. Don't play that game. It will drive you crazy, Draco, believe me. You can't try and reckon out how things would have been if you had just done something else, or you'll be no use to anyone, looking back instead of looking forward. We have to look forward now. Because even if the world doesn't want to believe it, Voldemort has returned, and
"You don't have to lie down and take that," Aberforth said fiercely. He withdrew a folded piece of paper from his pocket. "I believe you, Draco Black. And I'll help you. After our first meeting, I paid a visit to an old friend."
He sniffed the air, saying, "I smell guilt. There is a stench of guilt upon the air," and some part of Draco's mind, from the security of lack of choice, reflected that if
Sirius had talked about how much he loved making Remus laugh. Draco could feel that now, the unreasonable giddiness that sent bubbling up in him, however reluctant he had been to let go of his self-castigating wallowing.
"Thestrals, Luna told you," Draco said, trying to pull him in. "Come in, you know what they are, right?"
They had seen what Ron and Hermione had gone through, so that should have given Luna an idea what to expect, but Draco was on high alert. He was less worried about Luna than his own self control. If Umbridge was too nasty to Luna, he wasn't sure he could keep court decorum. Casting Langlock on one of the interrogators might count as prejudicing the judicial process.
evil if it means the war ending with all of you alive. I tortured my own mother for that. I'd kill for that- but I've already proven that. I'd do any spell under the sun. I would sell my
The following morning, Mr. Granger was seated in the living room, for what he called 'the early kick-off', and Draco took a seat curiously. This Muggle sport did indeed seem to involve a great deal of kicking. He was interested as well by the portal device Mr. Granger was watching it on, which he explained was this fabled telly-vision he had heard Dean Thomas speak of. Apparently, the image on the box before them was like a Wizard picture, a moving picture but a long one, and which could show something happening somewhere else at the same time.
It was an amusing temptation to lie, but Draco didn't. "How should I know? But if he does," Draco said archly, "He's certainly spent however many, many decades it was, since his sister died and Grindelwald dumped him, acting in a way entirely opposite to them." Severus's eyebrows raised at the word
"Lacarnum inflamari!" He didn't hit the chain directly the first time, but the very blast of it passing still rattled the chain more than anything had thus far. "Lacarnum inflamari!" Draco cast and hit directly this time, and the chain shrieked like a living thing. Draco grinned, opening his mouth wide and imagining the flames expelling not from the talon wand but his throat, like a real dragon. He called it out again and again.
He had spelled it impervious to water, but he still took care as he placed it back where he had found it on his wall of pictures, which in retrospect, it was very lucky he liberated from the Manor when he had. The Arsenal striker Ian Wright hung in place of pride, eternally frozen in the leap to score a header. Draco could hardly imagine he would have fared so well if left behind at Malfoy Manor.
"Hermione!" he snapped, looking about and drawing her right beside him as well. "Stay by me. Don't you dare wander away, not for a second." Draco might have made her a more appealing target this time for his father, by their friendship. Luna was in shorts, but Hermione as well as Ginny were in nightdresses, and it was sick and filthy that he even had to notice that and fear for them. Sooner than let Father humiliate Hermione like that woman, he would cast Lacarnum inflamari at Father himself, and see how well that fit with Peter's compunctions over underage wizardry.
"No," Draco said, grinning rather manically. "No, by all means, have your fun! I don't-" He tried to calm himself. "I don't want us to be enemies-"
Would it react the same once Aunt Bella escaped from Azkaban and came back for it? Would it turn any of his own spells against him- as if it would even need to, if Aunt Bella's Legilimency could just break right back into his head like that summer before sixth-year- and Severus was yelling something about Draco suffering from panic attacks, and Draco's gaze shot up with a start.
Tuesday brought Herbology, Charms, Potions again, Transfiguration, and Double Astronomy. His schedule hardly lightened for the rest of the week. As predicted, he was soon too busy to do much thinking. But he made time to go see Dobby in the kitchens, and recount everything about their respective summers. He didn't have the courage to inquire after the fate of Dobby's Kingsnakes hoodie, let alone his relationship with Wooky and Nissy. From the way they stayed far away, glancing over whispering behind their hands, he didn't have to ask.
Remus was of the opinion Draco may be biting off more than he could chew, while Sirius was serenely confident in Draco. "He thinks if you're capable of standing up to the great Sirius Black in a duel, you'll just magically get O's in everything," Remus sighed fondly. Draco suspected Luna would incline more towards Sirius's school of thinking than Remus's. As for Harry, he refrained from commenting on the decision entirely.
Umbridge did not protest the presence of their Head of Household at the presentation, nor even Blaise's inclusion, with his own Kingsnakes hoodie reading Assistant Manager rather than a position. But she seemed liable to draw the line at Draco leading Luna up by the hand, even when Luna proclaimed, "I'm the mascot!"
Sirius took on a look of incredible guilt before Hermione cut in to save him. "According to the legend we read, with what happened to Cadmus, the Resurrection Stone doesn't work, at least not the way it should. If the person you brought back didn't
"Do you love me?" Harry asked, voice shaking and going very small, cracking on the final word. He sounded a bit like he had as a child, in that memory, the first time he had been locked in the cupboard. He took a deep, shuddering breath, hands fists at his sides, staring at Draco with a pleading still in front of the despair, but a pleading which seemed on some level to know he wouldn't get the answer he wanted. And he didn't.
The one thing Draco did get out of that unpleasant little interlude was a visit from Hermione, who cornered him after Potions the next day with a hiss of, "Why did you tell Harry I'm hoarding all the books on the Chamber of Secrets?"
Lupin looked less fearful of Severus than fearful for Draco. Draco might have gotten to his feet and tried to punch him for that pity on his face, if his legs hadn't buckled under him the second he made the attempt. Severus pushed past Lupin to help Draco up, letting him lean against his side. Draco inhaled that familiar sour comforting odor of chemicals and grease and old stone, that imagined hint of dittany that accelerated the healing of scars.
Potter had told him. Draco had been so beside himself, he'd said the Slytherin password in front of Potter.
"Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was expelled," said Riddle carelessly. "I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn't going to waste those long years I'd spent searching for it. I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work."
, restored to all his bossy snaky glory, and not some substandard Defense professor with a vampire fetish. He was less afraid than he might have been, less afraid than he ever could have expected to be, because if this was death, it was death, and that was better than Dementors. Anything was better than Dementors.
"You bastard," Draco growled, wanting to throw aside any notion of stalling and rip Theo apart just as brutally as he'd had to rip apart Grindelwald.
"We can find a secure location," Remus said tentatively. "We have not yet chosen one, nor will we until right before the occasion, for the sake of secrecy. Albus may no longer be at Hogwarts, but he has pledged to assist us in that-"
Potter had his wand out in an instant. Looked like Draco hadn't been the only one to sneak his wand into his pajama pocket.
"Millie!" Ginny cried out, as if she could hold herself back no longer, and raced forward. Her red hair streamed behind her like a line of fire through the air, as powerful as she was small. "Millie, don't go! Please don't go!"
"I thought I was dreaming," Draco said, rubbing his eyes and adjusting his hoodie. "You're not here to take me back to Hogwarts?" He had been three days here waiting for the call back.
"I see what you mean about regressive gender politics," Draco commented, smirking at Hermione's dreamy look regardless, while even Remus seemed unaware now how much he was continually traumatizing the Grangers. He'd entered a serious discussion with Sirius about what poisons and curses could realistically be involved in the 'poison apple healed by a kiss' scenario.
tell on you to him about anything, why don't you get that? I'd always be on your side if you let me." Draco was silent, and a tear slid down Harry's cheek. "
Everything around them was eerily silent. Harry's muffled gasps against Draco's mouth echoed in the chilled air, the damp profaned feeling of the night around them not seeming to touch Harry and his warmth. Inside and outside of Draco was warm as he let Harry press him back, press him down, even against a gravestone-
"They said," Dantanian began, perhaps putting on more of an appearance of disorientation than he felt, "That one of the human guards found me, and stopped the Dementors. Just in time. That it's a miracle I'm not dead."
"Please," Theo said softly, "You're the most regal person I've ever met," and stroked his fingers over the exposed skin of Draco's arm. It gave Draco the creeps, since below the small faded white scar was the exact place where his Dark Mark had used to be. He hadn't seen the skull and snake there since the fake Moody had made him draw it on himself under Imperius, and for years then before that. But he could still imagine it there clear as day, especially since the feeling of Theo's hands on it hadn't been unfamiliar. Theo had hated the Mark, and tried not to look at it when they were together, but had been kind enough sometimes to put cream on it when it ached.
"Opaleye!" Dantanian hissed, eyes and voice brimming with longing. "Maman, Maman, please, can I have it, I'll hatch it, I'll take care of it, please, you say I'm the heir to-" She touched his shoulder at that, giving him a far sterner look than she had yet delivered him. He hastily shut his mouth, as if aware he had nearly publicly said a secret he could not tell. "It's an Opaleye egg," he said more quietly.
sorry," Ron said, approaching. Draco took the chance to seize Ron at one side, seize Luna back at the other side and press the mirror into Luna's pocket, unseen. Who on the planet could Draco trust more with his secrets, now that he had been relieved of even the corpse of Grindelwald?
Draco spun around to find a tall, strikingly handsome black-haired boy leaning against the nearest pillar watching. He looked blurred at the edges- as he had to be, for someone who should be as old as Hagrid by now.
"You really are out of touch, aren't you? What a boon to you I would be. Not just for access, but for everything I know about Hogwarts. I
He hadn't needed to make the threat obvious. "You are saying," Dumbledore commented, as benignly as if they were discussing the year's first snow, "That given the great influence you hold with Professor Snape and Mr. Potter, one would do well not to displease you, by refusing to tell you things that you think are true."
Hagrid was with that horrid dog of his, carrying a crossbow. "Abou' time. I bin waitin' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione, Draco?"
"Expelliarmus!" Draco yelled, and her wand flew into his grasp. He pushed it in his pocket, then advanced on her, wand and knife still drawn. "Where is she, Mother? Where's Aunt Bella?"
"What on Earth?" Harry breathed blankly, and pulled out the wand and the moonstone dagger, staring at the dagger's bloodied hilt. "Is this yours? What is this?" Draco refused to answer either of such obvious questions, and Harry went over and put them with his wand on the table across the room before coming back over. "Draco, why do you have that fancy knife under your pillow? I mean, I'd heard of sleeping with a knife under your pillow, but I thought it was just an expression- that wasn't for me, was it?"
Palmer blinked. "You and your mother," he said tiredly, "Were a taint upon his bloodline. He said House Black's strength came from its purity of blood, and he had always lived by that. He said..."
Draco stared down at Vince in dull dismay. "What are you doing? If you didn't agree with the older boys, why did you leave with them? Or is it that you did agree with them, and now you're just scared of what I'll do to you?"
Eventually, Draco caved. It felt the least he could do, once Luna picked up on the idea from Ron and declared herself unsalvageable with fright unless Draco agreed to this reasonable precaution. So Luna got her way, and Draco let her and Ron and Hermione do their worst disguising him. Ginny showed up with some expertise on long hair, which she admitted she'd often thought of coloring- much to Ron's outrage- before deciding against, to stay proud of her roots. Draco was torn between trying to come up with subtle ways to hint at the wonders of Slytherin lovers and Sapphic pleasures, and less subtle ways of demanding whether she still thought Harry Potter's eyes were as green as a fresh-pickled toad. But she was helpful nonetheless, and Draco ended Friday night with his hair gone from chin-length to all the way to the small of his back.
"I've been waiting," he said conversationally as they walked, sure Harry would know what he was talking about. "And I'm not saying I won't wait. I'd wait a damned long time, if that's what it takes. I'm just saying, I'm not waiting
To distract Hermione, he took her and Ron to the Black family tapestry, which Ron had only ever seen in picture form, and Hermione had only seen before Draco blasted Aunt Bella's name off it. Hermione seemed fascinated by that large, angry black scorch mark in place of a name, tracing it with her fingers, while Ron was more interested in finding the blasted name who had been expelled from the family for the temerity of wedding a Weasley.
For the first time, Draco wondered why no girls ever tried out for the Slytherin team. It seemed just to be the understood thing, or maybe it was just a byproduct of the size-over-skill mentality that seemed to have taken over the team in his time. But the selfish part of him was glad for the lack of any girls to provide slight, swift competition.
"Ahem," said Dumbledore. "I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes... First- to Mr. Ronald Weasley..."
"Yes, ma'am," Harry said. She gave him and Draco both another firm hug before going. Harry watched her leave, then quietly closed the door and sat down on the stairs. Draco sat down beside him and took out his wand. "You brought that?" Harry marveled, sitting without even his glasses, and Draco shrugged.
Draco began the brewing of Naufragiam the next day, once the remaining ingredients arrived in their extensive, careful packaging by owl post. He found the pomegranate seeds looked to have completely disappeared inside the tincture. That seemed apropos, given that it was tincture of
"Viktor," Draco said with a sigh, "Don't you think you've done enough, barging in here falsely accusing us and bullying a girl like this? If she doesn't like you, she doesn't like you. Get the message and leave her alone already."
"I trust you to conduct yourselves, always, with the utmost regard for your own and each other's safety," Dumbledore was saying. Draco tried not to snort. But Luna caught his unpleasant grimace and prodded his elbow. He forced a smile for her.
Draco shifted his feet shyly. "You will be after today, won't you? Don't worry, I'll figure out how to get you on the tapestry this summer..."
Draco stared down, but Aberforth did not give it to him yet. "If you want to stand up to Albus, you will need more than a fearsome reputation and a puppeteer's control of the Potter family jewels." Draco must have made a face then, because Aberforth cautioned, "No, brag not of your dark magic, if you think it of any worth whatsoever, you do not understand Albus. If you want cooperation- want information on those blasted Hallows or the like- want any acknowledgment of
He caught up by the time they reached the end of the labyrinth, but Theo went straight in the direction of the Slytherin common room. "Everte statum!" Draco yelled, throwing Theo in the direction of the stairs instead. Which Theo took as an invitation to flee up them.
Draco had once thought he should never be trusted with making even the smallest decisions. He wasn't so unsure of himself anymore, but he was getting to the point where he had to admit, maybe he shouldn't be trusted making
It felt like he had been exorcised. Like the nightmare he had seen in the dungeons was gone, and now he could go back to the reality he wanted. Like he had gone through a shattered mirror.
Draco closed his eyes and rubbed them hard. "Listen, just because me and my family have history with your headmaster doesn't mean he knows everything. There's more than one person he fucked over at the end of the war, you know." Krum's eyes focused on him truly for the first time, and Draco sprung on the first straw he could find. "Tell you what, Krum. You come flying with me tomorrow night, and I'll answer any question you have about that man. All the dirt on your headmaster's past you could ever want. All the things he wouldn't want you to know. Deal?"
me. I wish you didn't keep secrets, but I love that about you, how hard you to fight to protect the people you care about. Even- even me. And you're not going to scare me away-"
Why had the Dark Lord never tried to get these beasts to fight for him? Draco would have liked to see the defenders of Hogwarts trying to do battle with these Hippogriff-sized aberrations of nature with their eight eyes and eight legs and infinite capacity to terrify Ron Weasley. He smiled to himself, somewhere between trust in the blue loop and serene acceptance of his own impending death, as he imagined Dobby leading an army of house elves out of the kitchens to do battle with the convention of spiders.
The name still made Draco's insides clench up a bit, but the furious rush of hope that swept up through him overwhelmed that queasiness, left him exchanging glances with Remus, almost believing- "I still can't believe it," Sirius marveled. "Dumbledore's actually going to let us. I never thought he would."
"And we will find ways to requite that kindness," Draco cut in, "That do not involve risking ourselves and our- in my case quite dubious- academic careers for the interring of a creature who was happy to serve his sentimental benefactor's friends to his brood for a light spot of nibbles before bed."
"Oh, bloody hell," Draco muttered. "I hate that thing. Hey, Riddle, when you kill us, could you be sure and take that glorified piece of felt with us?" Ron dropped it abruptly, taking Draco's weary jibe too seriously, and Potter picked it up instead, staring it over.
Draco pulled his hand back from the vicinity of Harry's side as if it was radioactive. "I. Er. Well." He didn't know why he'd never thought of a lie for this. It had just seemed like the situation had long passed. It would have, if he hadn't been the one to bring it up. What would Harry believe of Draco? Himself as an Unspeakable? Married to some gorgeous faceless man? Standing over the corpse of his father? "Harry, I..." Harry got so mad when Draco didn't tell him things. But he would, as soon as he came up with a decent enough lie.
"I didn't mean it, not literally," Harry said breathlessly, but his thumb stroked Draco's chin. At least Harry looked somewhat affected by this tableau as well, if only through sheer disbelief.
"Not yet, darling, you know what's first," she said, and he followed sulky but obedient as she carried it over to a small but antique-looking kitchen table set, where they each assumed what were clearly their dinner chairs. "And no setting it on fire yourself this time! You have to pass your test."
Hermione's parents were staring at him in complete mystification. Hermione looked somewhere between amused and embarrassed. "Oh, Draco, you'd think you were a time traveler."
The other eyes, of course, were Harry's, big and green and magnetic from across the room. Luna felt like something steadying, then, that Draco had to hold onto tighter, with the thing that was buzzing and fizzing right underneath the uppermost layer of his skin. He had to steel himself to keep from letting it out, open his mouth and force himself to consciously breathe normally. Harry smiled at him, half-sheepish and half-hopeful. Draco was grateful that Harry's idiocy, with saving Gabrielle Delacour, had given Draco an excuse to act mad and keep his distance. Which was very ungrateful, after Harry had saved him too. But he wouldn't have been there in the first place, if Harry hadn't been dumb enough to feel-
"To interrogate your aunt about Potter's whereabouts?" Severus frowned, and Draco said nothing. "Ah," Severus said after a moment. "You went to kill her."
He cried for some time. But before the tears had left his face or voice, he recovered himself enough to ask, "Why is it you need Karkaroff so much?"
thinks I'm the Chosen One. He wanted to know what Dumbledore's been doing, where he goes, what he's 'up to'. And when I wouldn't tell him, he told me he'd..."
"Remus said you sent her a package," Sirius said with an uneasy look, his snowdrop ring glinting as his hand dropped. "Before the school year started."
He could brew that himself. Except- there was Severus in a dark corner, making stilted small talk with Sprout and Flitwick, and looking to hold affection for nothing and no one in the world save the tumbler of brandy in hand. It was hard to think what the use of Veritaserum would be. Both Severus and Dumbledore were strong Occlumens...
Try as Draco might, he couldn't come up with another con. He was just left with the understanding, in his own atrophied moral sense, that it was a poor state of affairs for Draco to be in any position to make such charts. It was the same as looking down at all those wizards at the cup final, knowing the changes he had already made in their fates, erasing the successful blue line. He had power, with his position near the center of events, along with a blue loop not too altered past recognition for his memory to help.
His self-reproach made him careless. He thought he had time to charm Ron and Harry's vials into wine for them, without Flitwick noticing. He didn't.
"Draco!" Potter kept shouting, until finally stomping away, and Draco's overwhelming relief was mixed with a slight degradation in his self-estimation that whatever Potter had to say, it was worth giving up so easily. He would have liked, he found, for Potter to have kept trying, so Draco could have the satisfaction of ignoring him for longer. It was cold up here without moving at a breakneck pace, so he cast a half-hearted Focillo to warm himself, which from this damn wand of his of course meant it practically felt like dragonfire, but at least he wasn't about to be frozen.
He hunched over his plate and began to shovel food into his face at the maximum pace, resolving not to take a single meal more in the Great Hall if this scrutiny endured much longer, and let that make him look guiltier. He could rationalize taking his meals in the kitchen with the house elves as monitoring for Dobby, though any rational part of him said it had been so long, he should just accept Dobby wasn't coming.
The gloom of the room, the terrible things Draco had seen and done here, were present once Draco took out his mother's wand. He looked backwards, reassuring himself there was no one else there to see this wand he had stolen. There was only his princesses, lovely and trusting.
"We can still win the cup," Theo said logically. "That's what's important, you know. It's only a fifty-point deficit. If we win our other two games by large enough margins, we could win it the way Gryffindor did in third year, even if they win
? Are you giving him bunny ears?" Draco nodded, glad the gesture had photographed, and Harry looked more fondly exasperated than surprised. "Oh, I figured you would do this. So did Luna. Even though according to her, you promised Hermione you weren't even going to
"Ron says he believes me now," Potter told them all happily, "That I didn't do it," and Hermione let out a shriek of happiness and threw herself on Ron, wet robes and all. Ron made protesting noises as Hermione grasped him around the neck, but Draco could see his ears turn red.
The announcer called, "Lamia Adora Periander, Heir to House Periander of the Ancient Knot, and her companion, Daniel Shaw."
"Is there a reason you ask?" Lupin asked calmly, with the first hint of anything but sunshine and lollipops Draco had seen him turn towards his beloved Potter. His eyes went to Draco for a long moment, who Lupin knew already knew, as if assessing whether Draco would tell Harry the truth.
"It's so beautiful," Harry exhaled, then added incongruously, "It looks like your room at Grimmauld. Or- like you. Pale, and shining."
Draco took a deep breath. "You're not going to believe me," he said, slowly and clearly so only they could hear. "But I promise I'm telling the truth. I was downstairs in Spell Damage, in the closed ward with Neville Longbottom. Sir, his parents have woken up."
Something flickered in Phineas's eyes, not quite threat. "Take your money and go. You will have nothing else from me."
Dumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt soggy pages, then looked slowly over at Draco. "Fascinating. I had believed this destroyed."
Draco gave Harry a slow clap that conveyed his opinion of that decision. Harry raked a hand back through his wet hair, giddily guilty. Draco had never thought he could feel so cold and so hot at once.
Severus had insisted that he not only keep making draught of peace, though Draco's had turned out fine in class, but that he would take over the other two Draco had been doing at Grimmauld. Draco had been speechless at the notion of Severus making Remus's potion for him again, when he had seemed more likely to concoct a potion of his own entrails to serve him. But Severus had just said something dry about Draco's Sisyphean ambition of twelve OWLs, making it likely that with any more extracurricular work, Draco would have no time for his captaincy at all.
"Were- were you lying?" Draco stuttered. "There was no shortage in ingredients, was there- you were never going away anywhere-"
A flash of anger showed through the front of passivity. "Indeed," Severus said in a low voice. "Indeed, you so often are. And
"He told me about you!" Draco called. "About what happened! Fifty years ago! With the Chamber of Secrets!"
I've looked into this, and it's hard to say. Ultimately, based on book canon, I would tend to think it can be used on animals, but not people- I don't see Fantastic Beasts as canon- in which case I wouldn't be sure about Animagi. But for Peter, with multiple names as well, I ultimately don't see it working. Sirius/Remus don't use it in the third book. So the answer for why Draco/Hermione don't use Accio is the same as why Sirius/Remus don't- I don't think it would work. But I'm not sure. Often these magical laws are very blurry lol
Draco looked up, not trusting his ears. He only began to believe them when Dumbledore declared the House Cup therefore remained with Slytherin, and the feast began, with the hall still covered in green.
Potter shook his head, chewing on his lower lip. "No, I just... Professor Lupin, he told me that the reason Dementors affect me so much more is because I've suffered worse than any other students, that I've been through more awful things, and so the memories the Dementors bring up are more powerful... and you're the other person I can think of, who has the worst memories."
"You need to stop leading Harry on," Diggory interrupted, "It's cruel, you know he likes you, and you just play around with him for fun? Harry's a really good person. He doesn't deserve anyone to toy around with him the way you do."
Draco hugged Luna closer too, while Mr. Weasley saw off the rest of their company. "Thank you, Luna," Draco mumbled. "You're the best cousin in the entire world. You're lucky we didn't both get arrested. Pink pajamas and all."
Draco's mouth snapped closed. He didn't understand how he could have forgotten. "Sorry," Draco whispered, "Sorry," and turned to go, even as he heard Severus make a noise to forestall him.
"Yes," Draco said with a sigh, "And that means the scrimmage is over, so you can stop trying to break your neck and saddle the Slytherin with the blame, Potter, sound good to you? Unless that's your strategy, to tire out your opponent the night before his match..."
"Then please," Potter said, voice going unbelievably desperate, as his eyes finally went from Draco's wand to his face again, as if less afraid of being hexed than being misunderstood. "Explain it to me, Draco, please. I'm not trying to be a bad person to you. I want to help you-"
"If it's any consolation," Draco said, "I think this is proof that Crookshanks is not only a good cat, but smarter than the rest of us." Her face looked like she'd reached the moment she could no longer continue indulging his lunacy, and he reached hurriedly into his pocket, for the Polaroid he had been carrying in anticipation of this moment sometime coming. "Wait, before you think I've been Confunded. Look at this picture, they're all Animagi- well, except for Lupin, it's like you said, he's a werewolf- he's Moony, Hermione, look at him, there he is, like on the map, that's the four of them who made it, Moony..." He forced her to look and tapped each face on the picture in turn. "Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. See, that's Lupin, Pettigrew, Uncle Sirius, and Potter's father..."
Draco could have laughed until he cried when their first task was, naturally, pairing up with each other and practicing Expelliarmus. Neville looked towards Luna, but she had already trotted over to Draco. Neville ended up with Harry instead, which at least guaranteed Harry should have the chance to demonstrate a successful disarming spell before Neville could stop him. Except there was no demonstration, bizarrely enough. Harry just told them to have at it.
Crouch gotten the name in? Unless it had been Karkaroff, coerced somehow, or who else? Wormtail on an unexpectedly intrepid return mission to Hogwarts, speeding in a Potter slip with it tied to his rat tail? There was no telling, and Draco hadn't elected to try and prevent it. One had to presume that whoever did it- read, most likely Crouch- also was the one to have enchanted the cup as a Portkey- which might count Karkaroff out, actually, given his drive to make Krum win, unless the man just really secretly hated Krum- understandable-
"Luna, we probably won't find anything," Hermione cautioned, but Luna was irrepressible, even once Draco Side-Alonged them both to the deserted forest from the pictures.
It was perhaps a measure of how worried Luna must be, that she seemed barely to hear that swipe, let alone react or retort. "I don't know if he can hear me. He's not responding. Draco, if you don't want to talk, please just say so, just thatso we know you aren't dead in there.
Draco had started saying he'd be an Unspeakable just as an excuse to avoid other students. But hearing his official ambition ridiculed as impossible in front of his whole house was still enough to put him in a foul mood for the week. At least Hermione and Potter agreed with him in his ever-growing abhorrence for the science, to the point that even straight-laced Hermione had stopped protesting his nasty but accurate impressions of Trelawney very much.
It proved to be functional, at least, when at last they reached a point where the vine completely blocked off the way forward. Dobby sent a burst of house elf magic out to disturb it before Draco could stop him, but the thing didn't seem to even register the touch. "Oh," Draco said suddenly, "This is what Karkaroff meant, when he said they'd blocked the mountain passage off!"
"Seguinus?" Gilderoy said blankly. Severus had to specify, a pained look crossing his face. Draco opened his mouth to announce his presence, only to close it once Severus asked,
"It's an Hour-Reversal charm?" Draco asked weakly. He knew damn well what a Time Turner was, after all the useless research on time travel, though he'd never thought he'd see one, at least not unless he somehow did become an Unspeakable.
, even Goldstein asked, as if Draco was their professor. Well, the discrepancy in power was at least as stark. "No, even I have trouble with that. Though there's an easy fix. Just call me Draco."
," and was so lax in his duty of pairing students that Lockhart had to come over and see what was the matter. His simpering left Severus looking sour he had not used a far more painful spell than Expelliarmus on the Defense professor.
"No," Draco laughed unsteadily, "No, I don't, I know I'm a hypocrite, but Luna- if you want me to, I'll try, if you say you will. He could have come to life as a person and done
Severus stopped beside his cauldron, and Draco forced up a smile. Blaise's absence from a bad cold had left the Slytherins at an odd number. "I'm fine to work alone, sir," Draco said, and the gaze cast on Draco then was almost worried.
"And that-" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, "That's the old school Sorting Hat." Ron picked it up and examined it just as doubtfully.
The enticing but elusive notion of hellwater from Gilderoy's Pensieve was not one Draco could let go of. The next time he could make it to Xaphan, at a time he was sure Severus wouldn't be there, was Sunday, right after their official visit. Draco made the irritating trek and Portkey journey all the way back. Then it was another Portkey, much to Gilderoy's unsteady reticence, to the place of nightmares, L'Infern in reality.
"He's vicious with it," Remus said quietly. "And you take that as a compliment, don't you, Draco?" He looked to find little humor in the situation, and ignored Sirius's puppyish whining to come kiss his neck better. Sirius was left calling forlornly after him, still vainly showing off the snake marks, but that was Sirius for you. He couldn't be any more whipped if Charlie Weasley started lending them dragontamer tools.
"Luna, I just think it's going to happen. And if we give this to Harry, no one will be able to take him away from Hogwarts for days. I know it's psychotic for me to do this, but..."
That Viktor's club happened to be in Bavaria, not too far from Austria? That was just the kind of coincidence that indicated the universe
"There's a magical-creature shop just over there," said Potter, looking eager to show off his newfound familiarity with Diagon Alley. He had little idea, of course, how many of these shops would be closed and boarded up in the space of a handful of years, but Draco tried not to think about the image of the alley then. Leave that for later, while there was still this sunshine day left.
"It's just the line lit up, as you said. The Elder Wand, that's the part of the symbol it means. It would make sense for it to be tied to it." Had she somehow figured out Dumbledore had the Elder Wand without his help? He wouldn't put it past her-
Draco almost fell to his knees where he stood at the sight of the tall slender figure, with the tightness in his lungs and the clamminess of skin tripling in a second. He knew it a woman, and not just because of the willowy curve of the body beneath the flowing black robes. He didn't know why he was so certain, until he realized the familiar feeling of the magic, and the dreadful déjà vu surety of the recognition where he had felt it before, where he had seen this figure before: Malfoy Manor.
In one desperate swing of his arm, Draco pulled his moonstone dagger and slashed wildly back at the whip. It held it off, but the force threw the dagger from Draco's hand into the water, clattering down inside all the coins there to benefit St. Mungo's, the glitter of moonstones fading as fire came down again sizzling against the water. Draco dove behind the statue, and the house elf's head was whipped clean off as a cackling Bellatrix advanced. Then she had severed the torso, her cackle growing with a magical exhilaration he knew well himself. The whip flew out, grazing the water just beside him and making his legs jerk from the sudden burst so near of unimaginable heat-
"If you free Sirius Black," Fudge finished, practically foaming at the mouth, "You will be letting the most dangerous criminal alive back out into the wizarding world, and no one, not wizards, not Muggles, not anyone under the sun will be able to feel safe, now that Sirius Black is walking free amongst them."
And then there was Theo, Theo who Draco had always flattered himself had a soft spot for him. Even in the red line, though Draco was a different enough person that was hardly objectively likely. It would have been preferable if Draco could somehow transfer his affections, and complete one of this year's top goals of lessening his obsession with Potter, by getting himself sweet on Theo. He'd used to think he was, in the summer after Father went to Azkaban. But just the thought of Potter made anyone around him seem dull, let alone calm, studious, unobtrusive Theo, who was always actively trying to blend into the background. Draco didn't fancy Theo anymore, try as he might to talk himself into it, but that didn't make it sting any less, that even Theo didn't believe he wasn't the Heir of Slytherin.
"It was all the pain at once, I think," Draco sighed, "But I'm glad I got it over with. I couldn't have lasted much longer, I'm glad I passed out from it- thank you, Dobby, you saved me again, so you don't have to punish yourself..."
"Distribution," Dumbledore echoed, and there was something almost like pain on his face- not betrayal or malice, though, nor even perhaps caused by Draco. His piercing blue eyes looked very much like Aberforth's had while speaking of the past, when his gaze left Draco in compulsive-looking fits to stare back at the letter. "To whom, may I ask?"
The Catalan ministry, the AAMC, is an autonomous government allied to the larger Ministerio de Magia of Spain. Mrs. Alba's husband, Minister Alba, says he has appealed to Castilia for intercession with Minister Scrimgeour. Spanish Minister of Magic Juan Correa confirms that t has spoken privately with Minister Scrimgeour about Mr. Lockhart's extraordinary case, and offers his country's gratitude to Britain's once-disgraced pariah. However, the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal that the Ministry will accept no mitigation of Mr. Lockhart's crimes with stories of unlikely heroism. They intend to bring him publicly to trial as soon as his health permits him to leave his hospital bed.
"And you're not," Draco said fiercely, unwilling to apologize for what he'd done. In Sirius's case, the implicit challenge in Severus's words made him practically snarl at his fellow member of the Order, before Draco pulled him back into a fiercer embrace, Remus holding Harry's face and speaking to him quietly at their side.
?" Draco gasped, and would have been well within his rights to cast Langlock on Potter for speaking such rubbish. "I've known him all my life. He might as well be my father. Except more intelligent, funnier, and far less likely to brawl with Weasleys in bookshops."
He would have just gone to Severus's chambers, expecting to knock on the door and perhaps wait some time before a cranky Severus deigned to acknowledge him. But as he passed the Potions storeroom, he saw a tall figure sneaking out with a large sack, looking around so nervously it was obvious he was a thief with stolen goods. It piqued Draco's curiosity, of course. Even before he saw the sandy blond hair, and saw that darting head turn towards the dungeon labyrinth. Towards Severus's chambers.
"Well," Draco said with a grin, "You're in luck, you lot. It just so happens you have a best friend who's a specialist at this sort of thing-"
"How many times do I have to tell you," Draco pleaded, "You're my friend, Ron, I would have told you, he would have told you- he didn't do it! You're just being stubborn by now! Friendships like you and Potter's should be unconditional anyway! Not, like, inherently contingent! You're his best mate, he misses you loads-"
"Don't you wish you knew," Draco teased, sinking lower into the bath. He felt an inappropriate heat when Harry's eyes followed. He hadn't thought he was done beating himself up for being a garbage human being yet. So it was very inconsiderate of anatomical features of his not to cooperate. "What is it, Harry? It seemed like something happened at St. Mungo's. I was just too busy being traumatized by the twins to see. Tell me."
. Maybe I'm a sociopath. I don't know. I shouldn't just be alright with it, that I killed a person, but- I don't feel
"There's shine and anti-rusting charms," she said, sounding relieved to be able to offer something to please the taste of Famous Harry Potter and his associate. "And if you look closer, every letter is embellished with a pattern of hundred very small pieces of rose quartz. It's known as the stone of unconditional love..."
"This is part of the exam, young man," she said, looking sympathetic but firm, and he took a deep breath before she opened the closet.
Draco's mouth had gone dry. He had to lick his lips several times to wet it enough to speak, and Theo's sideways glance at him was just white noise with the thrumming in his veins of possibility. "It's temporary, though, right? Two sunsets. So I don't know how useful..."
anything- never dare to offer myself to anyone, let alone him, with that mark carved on- with all of Seguinus's marks on me."
"Luna," Draco coaxed her, "It isn't too late to back out, you know. I can do this part all by myself, you can help me finish the potion part later-"
Draco followed the pull of his wand, shoving all and sundry out of his way, wishing he had Blaise beside him going, "Make way for the Heir of Slytherin!" But there was no need to panic yet. The tracking charm said she was here. He probably just couldn't see her behind Seamus Finnigan's fat head.
"Ronald Weasley," Draco said reverently. "I could kiss you right now, if my boyfriend wouldn't smother you in your sleep for it."
alive! I never thought I would see you again... Severus, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, this is all my fault, if I could have fought the Imperius curse... but I was too weak... or if I had just killed Pettigrew
"I don't think anyone says that," offered Neville, and Draco left them to their burdens and puzzles, Harry to Slughorn, Ron to Apparition, Hermione to her usual academic hysteria, and Luna and Neville to each other. He only flinched as he heard their conversation turn back to Apparition in his imminent absence. Hermione asked if anyone else besides Draco had missed every single Apparition lesson.
It took longer than falling through the trapdoor, though in the great undignified sliding of it all through this slimy rotten place- imagine, a Malfoy in the
Draco took one and popped it in his mouth defiantly. He brought his teeth down on the tartness beneath the layer of powdered sugar with an audible crunch. "You're the one with all the answers."
Draco thought as he watched the teachers and then students, picking at the turkey and ignoring his Christmas pudding. He might as well have been watching a scene in a Pensieve.
The Dark Mark surged up into the sky, Slytherin-green between the clouds, and in the distance, very distant, Draco heard louder screams. Draco's legs trembled, wand nearly dropping out of his hand, but then he ran forward. He could see the rain itself glowing the Dark Mark's acid green in the air before him, getting colder and colder, and Draco knew this feeling. This had never happened before, and yet he felt he had been right here before- had felt exactly this in months in a bleak island in a barren cell-
"I don't care," Harry insisted, and pulled Draco's hand to his mouth and kissed the back of it, green eyes radiant above it.
"Then come here, dragon-face," said Sirius, and enfolded Draco in a hug he knew he did not deserve in any timeline or universe, but Draco leaned into it the same.
"I burned the body, and sent an anonymous owl to his ancient mother, advising her of her inheritance of the property and his income. He did not seem to have any other family or connections. Under the circumstances, I thought best to keep it quiet. But his will did not leave
He was sure until the 23rd of February, the night before the Second Task. He was sitting in the library with his friends just before curfew. They were trying to distract Harry from his upcoming ordeal by helping Luna cram for her upcoming Potions theory exam. And then a twin pair of shadows fell over their books, one whose cheery voices sounded wrong in the hushed library environment. "What're you two doing here?" Ron asked.
Draco fastened a sneer onto his face and wished he had carried fewer books with him. He tried not to pick fights these days, especially with Potter. Any fight against Potter, he was bound to lose. But if someone came after him, he would come back twice as hard. "Are you asking if I'm guilty, Potter, or just sharing your suspicions and expecting me to be stabbed in the heart at your lack of faith in me?"
"There's a lot I have to tell you." Draco was not looking forward to hearing about her reaction to his blackmail attempt. What, it had worked on two other Hogwarts professors, it had been worth a try, at least..."And I'll always tell you as much of the truth as I can, remember? I promised that a year ago, Striker, and I'm going to try to hold to it now."
"The water is very cold," Gilderoy said, teeth chattering from sheer proximity to a pond which, if Draco's eyes didn't deceive him, did seem to have slightly expanded in diameter. "We'll be lucky if this doesn't kill a man of his age upon immersion, even with his cooperation. If he goes in petrified, I fear he'll simply drown. And even if we float him in and out..."
He tried to avoid the Gryffindors the rest of the day, though he had Double Arithmancy with Hermione. He didn't sit with her for once. But she kept trying to catch his eye during the lesson, though he would have thought her less friendly, given he'd just told one of her real best friends he
"That's very advanced magic, Draco," the miserable excuse for a teacher told him, when Draco came up to him to ask before their next class. "I can understand the desire, after you had to face up to such dark creatures. But it's beyond the abilities of a third-year, even one I am told is as talented as you. In the future, you should be able to rely on your professors to protect you."
"Sometimes," Draco said. "I know I am." He put on his Opaleye necklace before turning and surveying Hermione, who had also dressed up more than usual. "You look
"Will you, Gilderoy," Draco began, "Share all your knowledge from the Castell de L'Infern with the lawful members of House Black for the rebuilding of Citadelle Xaphan?"
"Thank you," Harry whispered, though his demeanor remained drooping. He only seemed to pick up his head and become alert again someone started knocking on the door.
It was a page torn from a very old library book. Draco was aghast at the thought of Hermione having willingly defaced a library book, which seemed to signify the apocalypse had truly come. But Potter was not so perturbed, as he smoothed it out eagerly and showed them to read.
"Do it. Cut my hand," Draco ordered. "My palm." He pulled it back and offered the skin to Harry. "Cut my palm. Just a little cut."
Potter stared at him uncomprehending, as Draco twisted his cheeks to one side then the other, pouting. "High five, Potter," said Draco. Like a sunburst from a defeated storm, a smile shot out unsteady and helpless on that adorable face. Potter leaned up and slapped Draco five so hard his hand hurt just not right after, but all the rest of the night.
Clearly Severus's status as Draco's godfather had not spread throughout the faculty. Say that much for McGonagall's discretion. It had to help that Severus had been less attentive after Draco had demolished his fireplace. Luckily the wall had been lacquered over again, in time for this unwanted visitor. Draco still caught Lockhart casting an apprehensive stare at the darker color of that section as he avoided Draco's gaze.
"Don't worry, there's no harm done," Luna said, and began to apply a fairly good Tergeo charm to the sap over herself, before siphoning off the most obvious sap from the others. Harry was staring at Draco's hair with some of the same dismay Draco felt, but he let out a laugh when Luna raised her wand towards it and Draco dove down in his seat, covering his head with his hands. "Draco, don't be frightened, I'll clean off your hair..."
Severus, who from the sound of things had actually been on the side of light all along. Which made his funeral a curiously harder prospect than Vince's. It made sense for Vince to have perished in Hogwarts, the same as Aunt Bella and Voldemort, the same as it would have for Draco or his parents. But Severus had fought just as hard as Potter to take down the Dark Lord, harder no doubt in his Slytherin way, and death was his reward all the same, leaving only some ill-attended funeral to loom as the last reminder of the man who had been Draco's godfather.
"Scabbers!" Ron shouted, pursuing him, and Draco watched them go rooting for Scabbers to elude them. Hermione, though, was quickly off too, in pursuit of the more impressive Crookshanks, who proved to be a cat of a very large kind, with a smushed face not unlike the house elves on the walls of Grimmauld Place.
"Oh, really?" she said, widening her eyes in faux-enlightenment. "Who would you say is the best student in this class, then, Professor Flitwick?"
The Weasleys went postal, crowding and getting their hands on it before Draco even could. They were all speaking at once, while their mother tried to coax them back to let Draco have it. Murmurs that filtered out from the redheaded whirlwind like
"Don't curse him, Draco," Luna sighed, sniffling a bit. "It wasn't his fault. There was an emergency at the Herbology greenhouses, just as he had to leave to meet me. He came when he could. It's not like he
"I am absolutely sure," Draco said truthfully. "I swear to you, Potter, I'll swear on anything in the world. My father was the most important of the Death Eaters, and he knew Pettigrew was a spy working for the Dark Lord from within the Order of the Phoenix. You know how it all worked, with the Fidelius Charm and the Secret Keeper?" He let Hermione drive the facts into their skulls once more, but Potter barely seemed to be following, hand trapped over his mouth without a sound coming out, eyes bigger than Draco had ever seen them.
than objectively simpler jinxes. And Harry failed to shield completely against it. His hands went to his throat and he glared at Draco in betrayal. Draco raised his wand again. "Finite-"
three syllables," Severus said icily, "If you intend to maintain any pretense you know what you're talking about-"
to learn. It took me much study to even approach its mastery, and when I performed it, it was the accomplishment of a great and noble feat! Whereas..."
At least he didn't have to bother feigning shock at Dumbledore's subsequent announcement that the Triwizard Tournament would be this year. Nor would it be new this time to any Weasleys and co. Sneaking a glance over at the excited Gryffindor faces, he wondered if extra time to concoct tricks to fool the Goblet of Fire might somehow push the Weasley twins over the line and help them con their way in. Granted, it wasn't an honor with the highest life expectancy, but it wasn't like one of them had a much longer one anyway, might as well go for the glory...
So take care of my godson, and no dueling accidents! And don't let Harry talk you into anything stupid.
"Draco," Severus said in alarm, and went over to clasp his shoulder. "There is an easy way to solve this. Get up. You will look at the memory in my Pensieve."
Draco tried not to react to the praise. He ran his fingers through his own hair teasingly instead, watching Harry watch him. When he bared his torso to the firelight, Harry looked ready to leap on him.
"Draco," Lupin said, and Draco almost did punch him for a split second, because there was more pity in his eyes than Draco had seen anyone in the red line look at him with once. "Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't think you are a very clever and accomplished young man..."
"Sociable lot, your family," Potter groused, but nodded in assent, saying he'd get Ron and Hermione back up to speed while Draco got Luna. As her letter had promised, she was in the last compartment again, which she seemed a bit sad to leave. She followed, though, even after he whispered the disclosure he had been mulling over all summer.
. I meant the second part is true, that I'm gay." Once they all climbed off, he leveled them with a paralyzing stare that kept them lined up beside the carriage. "I'm telling you all now openly. Reconfirming it directly. And if word spreads to my father, it will be through one of you and your parents, and I'll know. But I won't know
sometimes, as little as Harry liked how much time that meant Draco spending with Theo. He could assure Harry until he was blue in the face that he would never replace him with Theo, it didn't change how jealous Harry was, knowing that Theo had at least a small thing for Draco. Sometimes he caught Harry sneaking around daytime Slytherin practices, watching them, although that might not just be jealousy. He'd always seemed to like following Draco around and watching him.
Past the shed snakeskin, no different, there was the corpse of the Basilisk laid out across the floor of the Chamber, great and scaled and gleaming, its gaping maw with its venomous fangs left dead and open. There was the statue of Salazar Slytherin, a worse likeness every time Draco saw it. There was no small light-haired body at the foot of the statue. But it still did not fail to strike Draco, how much it felt he had seen all of this exactly before. Maybe Draco should have gone with Dobby to get the others, but if Luna had gone alone ahead before all of them, he wasn't about to leave her alone against the Death Eaters for a second longer than necessary. So now Draco stood alone in the Chamber of Secrets, looking for Luna, and did not find her. But there was someone waiting for him, and that was where the déjà vu came in.
When Grindelwald didn't move, Draco feared his flippant attempt at lightness had been too idiomatic. "All we need is for you to get into that water and submerge yourself completely, and that's your way to freedom."
"You're going to..." Draco panted, "Have to learn to kiss... properly, you great blunderbus." Harry laughed shakily, sucking on Draco's lower lip again. He seemed to have learned that Draco liked that, or he was in the process of learning it, tugging out the lip between his before returning to press kiss after kiss smacking against Draco's waiting mouth. Each one was like a lavishing of affection too deeply felt for him to keep holding back, another declaration restrained no longer.
"Draco!" a voice was calling. He just registered it as Weasley, despite how Weasley never called him his first name. "Draco, stop it!"
