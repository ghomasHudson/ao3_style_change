Chandra grins. “Damn, so it’s not just your good looks, huh?”
“Fuck off, Harry,” Draco says with a lopsided little smile and an eyeroll, and the strangeness and familiarity of that at the same time makes Harry feel like they really are on the cusp of something.  He’s so full, overflowing with the kind of energy that makes you feel like your organs are trembling with it.
There are several advantages to having lunch in Hermione’s office, the biggest of them being the fact that it’s so far away from the Auror department that overeager colleagues will usually leave him alone for at least an hour; the biggest disadvantage is having to try Hermione’s newest bizarre food adventure almost every day.
“Morning,” says a voice behind him.
She stops chewing and raises her eyebrows at Harry.
“Jackfruit.”
The last of Harry’s nervous knots let up. “Are you alright?”
“What happened to you in France?”
“Morning,” he replies, turning around, and—oh.
Harry is suddenly back in the Forbidden Forest, waiting to die a second time that day, being asked if Malfoy was alive. He can’t move. Narcissa rushes over to him and clutches his wrist, forcing him to look up at her instead of the door.
. He looks directly at the table when he says, “It was Madonna.”
, then closes his eyes and sips his tea. Harry watches him for a moment as he drinks his own. Should he say something? Make small talk? Is every morning going to be like this?
before he speaks.
Harry takes in his face; returns to his previous observation of Mr Diggory looking way older than he should. And the only explanation for that is—
That neither of them quite know how to handle the sensitivity of it, the wounds they have caused each other, the sinister thing that engulfed them in a fight that wasn’t theirs, and gave them no choice but to be what they were to each other.
But why did he come back from the future? Why to now? Why—
And Harry also realises, with a little flip of his stomach, that it was Malfoy who initiated this one. He was the brave one, not Harry. He smiles at that, and thinks that’s something he can say out loud. And take over, too, take the next step of bravery on this awkward path.
“Keep your fucking voice down,” he hisses. “People don’t know my real name here. What on Earth are you doing here? How do you even know I live here?”
It’s Arrabbiata too, his specialty. Not to impress Malfoy, but because he had everything in his pantry for making it.
“My—what?”
“Get off my case, Hermione, I tried your shitty johnfruit—”
They land painfully. Harry is disoriented and dizzy, and the first thing he does, instinctively, is reach for Draco to make sure he’s okay. A terrible mistake, he realises, when he hears a voice behind him.
Then, “You read Hesse?”
that is something he feels just a bit giddy about seeing.
It’s just that the sweat that beads in the dip above his top lip whenever Robards calls him in hurts his pride a bit; the Head Auror has this thing where instead of just straight-up saying what he wants, he asks all these questions that maybe Harry is supposed to know the answer to, but he doesn’t.
“There’s no going around it,” Harry says, and even though he recognises the fear on Malfoy’s face, he can’t say he feels much empathy; Malfoy is a coward who doesn’t want to face the consequences of his actions.
“You’ll think it’s silly,” Malfoy continues, “but my father always hated music, and he wouldn’t allow it in the house. He played classical on a charmed turntable during dinner, that was it.” He huffs out a tiny laugh. “I didn’t get it at the time, but now I think he did it to fill what would have otherwise been a meal filled with stilted conversation and eventually awkward silence. It was the only time we would be forced to spend more than a few minutes together. As a family.”
Narcissa nods and clears her throat. “Indeed he does. He has ever since he’s returned from France. Furthermore, he refuses to come back home, even for Christmas. We exchange letters. By which I mean I write to him, begging to know how he is, what he is doing, in essence, and he reluctantly answers. He doesn’t tell me much. I visit him sometimes… but I am lucky if he lets me see him twice a year.”
“What’s with the bloody clothes?” Draco asks, exasperated.
It almost happened to him once, in sixth year, and he just managed to catch it before his thoughts, his obsessiveness could grow a consciousness of their own without his permission.
Harry laughs a little; it comes out forced and breathy. “But... I think you just have to kind of be—good. You know? You can’t change the past. But you can decide to be a good person. And being good... it just means doing good things. I think that—that might be something worth holding onto.”
about Malfoy, the way he’s changed, is so close to something he knows the name of, knows the feeling of, and yet he can’t name it, can’t empathise with it. It makes his stomach churn in a strange, unsettling way. As if his body knows how he’s supposed to feel about Malfoy’s bizarre state, but his brain is yet to catch up with it.
The guy gives him a funny look, points behind Harry. “He’s right there,” he says, and Harry turns.
But that’s far-fetched; unrealistic, really. He hasn’t an idea what’s happened to Malfoy, in truth. And now Harry feels the urge to shake his head, rid it of thoughts that mean nothing, that are of no use other than to drive him mad, send him down a path of obsessiveness that serves no one.
Harry doesn’t own any breathtaking clothes, but he thinks he owns a pair of jeans that are not tattered beyond belief. A gift from Hermione, of course. He’s never worn them. He pairs them with his least ragged jumper—a dark red V-neck he only ever wears on the rare occasion he goes out. Only so that he doesn’t look completely out of place next to Malfoy.
“I don’t care. Keep me company.”
And he doesn’t mind that at all, not in the least; as he looks at Draco mouthing along to the lyrics intensely, swaying from side, moving his shoulders up and down while sitting on the floor, he can’t stop the question bouncing around in his head, creating a resounding echo—
“Clearly,” Harry snaps, and then instantly regrets it. He rubs at his eyes. “Sorry, it’s just—sorry. We haven’t got anywhere at all, and—and now they know Malfoy is staying with me. That’s an extra source of stress I didn’t need.”
“Bloody hell,” Harry mutters. He pushes his glasses up and rubs at his eyes. “Malfoy. You—you haven’t eaten meat in five years and you let me feed you beef and—fuck, Jesus, I got you butter chicken in the cafeteria—just because you didn’t want to be a bother?”
All he knows is that his entire childhood was spent in the shadow of his family’s hatred and bigotry. Harry stills. Rookwood Jr was not a Death Eater; he was merely the son of one, not unlike—
The sick sense of satisfaction grows in his stomach when Narcissa’s expression remains neutrally pleasant.
Harry’s heart stops. “Like what?”
is enough.
“You wanted to use the Time Turner to go back and save Cedric. And I didn’t help you,” Harry says.
“I am an Auror, Mrs Malfoy, I do believe I know how to Apparate without making a show of it,” Harry interrupts, slightly annoyed.
Well, almost: Harry doesn’t miss Chandra’s quiet snort from behind her cubicle, but he’s also glad that at least
“Still could have told me,” Harry grumbles. He knows all the while it’s his ego speaking, but he can’t help it. He does have to Know Everything. It’s just how he is, even if he knows he doesn’t have to be involved in cases where Chandra is called in for psychological profiling; that’s her area of expertise, not his, and undercover cases are usually classified.
“Draco!” Harry shouts, rising up from the ground. Draco struggles against the beam, thrashing and screaming.
But then he actually sees Malfoy, and Christ, how could ever
A sudden, dull bang comes from his kitchen window. There is a large, grey owl perched on his windowsill, holding its leg out towards him. It waits motionlessly for Harry to take the attached letter, and doesn’t wait for a treat before it flies away.
Narcissa takes a deep breath. “Draco... his father and I sent him to France shortly after the War. In the aftermath, over the first few months, someone would turn up at the gates almost every day, trying to get through the wards. Journalists, Muggle-born activists, concerned citizens... You cannot imagine how hateful people can be when they are encouraged to believe they are right, and that’s exactly what the outcome of the War has—”
“You came here last night?” Malfoy asks, frowning.
Then, before Harry can grasp what’s happening,
That’s where he’s filed away the aftermath of it all, too. The injustice of it all. The bureaucracy that did nothing to obliterate the bad that was done—obliterating it mercilessly would have been the only way for at least the remnants of justice to restore itself. The gradual, bitter realisation that that wasn't going to happen found a way to gouge the holes in his chest into craters, letting them fester into pustulous, gaping wounds that he cannot,
Harry sighs. “Malfoy,” he starts, gentle. “I can charm your face, if you want. Would you like me to?”
When he opens his eyes to find Malfoy drinking a little sip of tea out of his spoon, he knows it’s neither.
Once at home, he carries Draco to the guest room. He takes his shoes off before tucking him in under the covers. He takes one last deep breath to get rid of the remainder of his shakiness, then points his wand at Draco.
Draco just looks at him, so soft and unguarded it makes Harry’s chest ache. Then, quietly, “No. I think this—this is enough.”
wants to, but he doesn’t push it.
“Patil and Richards. A copy of their report is on your desk already. Chandra is on her way in. I know it’s unfortunate timing with your new flatmate and all, but please do come in as soon as you can. I’d like to put an end to this before someone else dies.”
Harry wants to reach out, grasp Draco's hand, do something to channel the heavy impulse to encourage that washes over him. But he doesn't want to disturb Draco; he has a feeling like he's supposed to witness this, not participate in it.
changed.
Harry is starting to feel prickles of irritation at the fact that he’s clearly missing something Draco has caught onto. “Because he couldn’t deal with losing Cedric, even after all those years. And I—I understand why he—there’s a reason Time Turners have such a short time limit. If that really does change in the future, if someone were to invent one that can take you decades into the past—you could alter the course of the future completely. I know for a fact that future me wouldn’t want to help him do that. Even if I—even if I do feel guilty about Cedric, and I—I am going to for the rest of my life.”
On Sunday morning, Harry wakes up with a plan. That is—a plan to get Malfoy to go to Diagon with him. With his actual, real face. A plan that, he tells himself, is important to do his job well, which is protecting Malfoy. Malfoy has said nothing of the sort, but Harry hopes that now, the thought of returning to the wizarding world is not as nightmarish for him as it was before.
And he does—he does know. Even if he’s not fully aware of it, or he can’t put it into eloquent words. He’s always been a creature guided by an instinctual moral compass that he’s never really needed to look at consciously. He did go to see Narcissa after he got her letter, and he did fight for Malfoy’s case with Robards. And he never thought twice about it.
“Okay. Well, there is one thing I’ve been meaning to ask for a while.”
Harry takes a deep breath. He sees it clearly now: he has to push against it, get it out the door and lock it fast. This is a road that leads nowhere,
And then he regrets it, because that’s not
“I’m really just a victim here. You know? So it isn’t fair—you’re not interrogating me as an Auror, is what I’m trying to say. You’re just bloody nosy—”
He has absolutely no clue what the everloving hell is coming out of his mouth or where he is going with this, but he continues nonetheless. “He’s invited all of us to relive the good old days for a few weeks, spend some time together like we used to.” His eyes search out Malfoy’s, and he hopes he conveys what he wants to. “Thought our school days were over,” he arches his eyebrows, “but they’re not.”
is the way he looks: his clothes, his hair, his posture, the way he holds himself when walks, his deliberate mannerisms.
They walk in silence, Malfoy a few paces in front of Harry, then he finally asks, “How long am I meant to be a... a
When Malfoy’s eyes open to lean away from the microphone and look down at the guitar, Harry’s limbs of lead let up like magic, fight or flight setting in. He chooses flight, turning abruptly on his heel and exiting the pub as quickly as he can without actually running.
But he has been aware. He’s had different levels of clarity on the matter for years, depending on how honest he feels with himself on a given day. Or how much alcohol he’s consumed. And, well, he’s very aware of it now.
So Harry makes breakfast and tries not to think about Malfoy. And, like when one is instructed not to think about the elephant, all he thinks about is Malfoy.
need to be protected,” Harry adds.
“I haven’t decided anything,” Harry replies disdainfully. There’s not a muscle that moves in Narcissa’s face.
Draco watches Harry’s face intently for a few seconds before he looks away and continues. “Except for my mother, I guess. But can you call it kindness, when—when she watched my father recruit me into a death cult when I was sixteen and did nothing?”
“I don’t know,” Harry admits. “No one does. I’m on the case with my partner, but the entire department is helping out one way or another. This is the biggest case we’ve had... well, since the War, really.”
Harry’s eyes widen. “What? No—”
, Harry thinks.
Malfoy’s eyes widen. He opens his mouth, closes it again. Opens it again, just to say, strained, “Are you being serious?”
And that’s how they end up in the living room, Harry sitting on the floor in front of the sofa, Draco sitting in an armchair opposite him. His ears are red.
“Malfoy?” he calls out as soon as he enters.
They get the case assigned to them. Not much of a surprise, really, considering Harry’s experience with Death Eaters and Chandra’s specialty being criminal psychology. The crime scenes are impeccable: not a clue left to figure a message beyond the subtext of
Draco laughs good-naturedly. “No.” He digs into his pocket and throws something at Harry. Harry just barely catches it. It’s a small crystal vial. “I’m one of those wise ones that carry hangover potion wherever they go, just in case.”
“What the actual—”
Harry’s stomach flips. Fuck, Malfoy doesn’t know he went to see him—
“It’s not from Chandra.” Harry picks up the little purple aeroplane and frowns at it. “It has Robards’ insignia.” He carefully unfolds the memo and quickly scans the hastily written lines. His sharp intake of breath immediately puts Hermione on edge.
Harry doesn't trust his voice to be steady, so he tilts his chin up slightly, and hopes that translates to
“Oh,” Katie says. “So what’s the plan? Are you staying for breakfast? William makes a mean—”
Harry bursts out laughing. Malfoy looks slightly offended. “Sorry, sorry, I’m not laughing at you. I’m just imagining your haughty little Pureblood self, thoroughly disgusted by anything Muggle, telling Crabbe and Goyle about a Muggle rock band. What I’d have given to hear
It’s better if he takes Draco home.
The sad smoke is slowly seeping into the room the more Harry looks at the inside of Malfoy’s right wrist, covered by his sleeve all the way up to his palms, and Harry suddenly can’t recall why he thought this would be a good idea.
Harry can feel his heart squeeze so hard in his chest he almost clutches at it. Whatever he feels for Draco, whatever this is—it has, for all intents and purposes, broken through his carefully constructed dams, resurfacing from under the river of Lethe, stronger than ever—fuelled by the wine in his blood, by Draco’s darling face under the soft ceiling lights, his utter vulnerability.
Draco stills. “What?”
“I do,” Harry nods. “We went to school together, and we were, erm, friends, but we lost touch a while ago. I ran into his mother a few days ago, and she told me where he lives. So I thought I’d pop by to surprise him,” he lies through his teeth.
Harry looks at him, bewildered. “What’s wrong?”
, he thinks, blond hair messy, cheeks red with pillow creases.
“Theodore Nott.” The words push past his lips in a haste to get ahead the bile. “I went to Hogwarts with him.”
, his mind says.
His immediate, almost instinctual honesty bothers Harry sometimes. This is one of those times.
Harry nods. “Right. I’ll take you there.”
They sip in silence for a few minutes. “Pinot gris,” Harry reads the label. It’s a pleasant, dry white wine. Harry isn’t big on wine, but this is good.
She seems to catch herself then, and a flicker of something akin to shame or regret flashes across her face. “Not that there is anything wrong with being different, mind, but with him, it has happened so quickly, you see. And he has never bothered to explain his… transformation, so to say.”
“That’s true,” Harry starts, “but according to his mother, Malfoy is completely disconnected from the wizarding world. All this time, we had been under the impression that he was hiding out at Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire, but he hasn’t set foot in there for years. Which means he never even received our owl. His mother told me that he’s disconnected from the Floo Network, and there are no wards around his flat. He is arguably much more vulnerable than other ex-Death Eaters.”
“Like you want to eat me up,” Draco says. He’s looking right at Harry, and Harry can’t look away. He opens his mouth to say something, but his head feels hot and dizzy with the amount of blood rushing to it.
Malfoy gapes. Harry feels a strange sense of satisfaction at that. He unscrews the bottle and pours both of them a generous finger, pushing one of them towards Malfoy.
Harry looks at her for a long, hard moment. A broken woman. An opportunist with hard lines between her eyebrows. Not good in the sense he prefers people to be, but loyal. He thinks about Malfoy, and he can’t conjure the words to describe him. He sighs and sits back down in the rose-patterned armchair.
“Are you one of those annoying people that don’t get hangovers?”
Harry supposes making Draco Malfoy breakfast might well be the catalyst for making this entire situation normal. Or a start. Whatever.
“Well, in any case, you’re keeping an eye on him now, right?”
“I don’t smoke,” Harry says.
He can’t stop looking at the body. At the stiff limbs and the open, expressionless eyes. And with every passing moment that he can’t tear his gaze away, he feels as if a cold hand were roaming inside his chest, ripping open his long-forgotten wounds.
Harry needs to get him away and into the safety of a warded house, and fast. But there is a strange, uncomfortable feeling in his chest, like something is out of place. He doesn’t quite know what to do with it.
The thought of seeing Malfoy after all these years unsettles him; Malfoy doesn’t belong to the forefront of his thoughts. Harry has taken meticulous care to tuck him away at the back, along with the memories of the War, and Sirius and the Veil, and Lupin and Fred and Dumbledore, the many holes Voldemort ripped in his chest.
“He was found dead outside his flat last week.” Malfoy clasps his hand over his mouth. “I’m sorry,” Harry adds. Even though Malfoy’s shock seems to be genuine, Harry can’t shake the feeling that something is off about him; and it’s not just his newfound Muggle life.
, why would he force himself to tear his gaze away, why would he try to fend off the warmth creeping into every fibre of his being?
“You’ve always been so no-nonsense,” Malfoy says. “So straight to the point.” He pauses, takes a deep drag on his cigarette, and says, “I’m still... the same person, I still feel like myself. I just feel like... the ideas I had were so wrong and bad that—that I am somehow wrong and bad myself. You know? And I have to, I feel like I have to be a different person entirely, from the bottom up, so I try, but then—then I don’t feel real.”
"But those things, they’re not even what surprised me the most. Not even close,” Draco continues. He takes in a big, shaky breath. Says, as he lets it out, “Kindness caught me off guard the most. I’ve never really seen much of it around me. Nobody has ever really been kind to me. You know?”
“Well, he hasn’t made an appearance at any charity functions organised for those affected by the War, nor shown any sign of repentance, even after he was spared a sentence. They say he’s holed up here, in the Manor. Not that I pay much attention to the rubbish the papers write, but it’s hard not to assume some truth to what they say. I guess there’s a certain comfort for him to be found here. The centre of all the prejudiced shite he grew up in. Unchanged by the world taking a turn for the better. Isn’t there? Are those the circumstances you meant, Mrs Malfoy?”
Harry flinches at Draco’s voice; but it’s too late. He can feel a sickening pull behind his navel, the world blurring around him, and he can just make out Draco’s body lunging towards him, grabbing his arm.
“Yes,” replies Malfoy.
“How’s the entourage?” Chandra asks between two bites of what seems to be Asian takeout, still taking notes at the same time. Such mundane things like niceties and the concept of breakfast food mean nothing to Chandra, and Harry particularly likes that about her.
He comes out of the shower to Draco lying on the sofa in the living room, right opposite the bathroom, sprawled like he owns the place. Harry ignores how dry his mouth becomes in an instant, how pathetically his breath catches in his throat.
is enough.
, but he knows it wouldn’t. So he waits, with patience he really doesn’t have, for Malfoy to open up by himself.
“Harry,” Draco interrupts gently. ”We will never know what these people would have done in a reality where Diggory didn’t come back to kill them. We will never know what kind of reality that would have been. Because that isn’t real anymore. Okay? This—this, now, is real.”
Draco is in the kitchen, pouring Firewhiskey into three glasses. Chandra laughs. “Wow.”
“Yes,” Chandra interrupts with an eyeroll. “Yes, Harry, it means that he is quite possibly in more danger than most ex-Death Eaters, and that your stupid hunch that was based on absolutely nothing was right. Probably.”
Chandra takes his face in both hands, forcing him to look at her. “Listen to me. You didn’t fuck up. Not any more than I did. There was no way for either of us to know. We did our job. We did our best. Okay?” She glances at Draco. “Did he do something to him? Or just a Stupefy?”
Harry doesn’t know what to say. The awkward silence is broken by a voice calling his name from the fireplace. Harry hurries over, and his stomach drops when he sees it’s Robards.
“I don’t know whether he keeps up with what is happening in the wizarding world, and I am afraid my warnings are not enough reason for him to be careful. I have told him of the murders, and I have begged him to return home where he would be protected, safe under the wards, at least until the culprit is caught.”
He falters, giving Harry a look that Harry thinks he’s perhaps meant to understand, but he doesn’t.
Quote at the beginning of the chapter—from one of Martin Luther King's sermons.
“But… what’s going to happen to his present self?” Harry asks. “If they—if they detain him, if they try to prevent him from using the Time Turner in the future, wouldn’t that also—”
“Well, I mean, it’s not like he’ll be missed,” Hermione shrugs. “Some people were pretty pissed he managed to avoid Azkaban again after the War, and rightfully so. I actually overheard Bronski and Yates in the morning, talking about how hungover they both were because they literally celebrated his death yesterday.” She shakes her head. “I mean, I won’t shed any tears, but to celebrate death in any case is quite morbid, isn’t it? And to defile the new fountain like that…”
“I was the one who grabbed you,” Draco says. “And I was the one who was targeted. Stop making this about yourself.” Harry opens his eyes and looks at Draco. He’s smiling. “So—what happened?”
“Dunno, just never have. I guess unconcerned hobo is just my natural state of being. I do appreciate a good sense for fashion, just not on myself. Like on you.”
Malfoy takes his shoes off by the door without a word, then sort of shuffles into the living room awkwardly, eyes darting around the flat. He takes in the open space, the TV and the U-shaped sofa; the swirling galaxies of the quartz kitchen island, the dark walnut floors and the pictures of Harry’s family: mostly Ron and Hermione and Teddy.
competition to be had when it comes to soggy five-quid street food.” Just as Harry is about to open his mouth for a retort, Hermione steers the conversation onto safer, non-food grounds. “Any new leads on the Macnair murder?”
“There’s an Apparition lock on the Ministry outside of the Atrium. But if you want to, we can make sure people don’t recognise you.”
“You okay?” Chandra asks from behind him. Harry flinches.
“But you... want to know. Yeah? And I—I haven’t really had to do this, so it’s a tad bit intimidating. So, just—” Malfoy shrugs, as if catching himself in need of a sign that he couldn’t care less, “tell me something about you. In return. That I don’t know. Trade me.” He pauses, then, “Like... why you’re so tense all the time.”
The way he uses his face now is far less expressive than Harry remembers. But the delicate highs of his cheeks, the refined shape of his jaw still make him look like one of the most naturally aristocratic people Harry has ever seen.
“Are you done with the psych profile?”
Harry pauses. There are two thoughts in his head at the same time, clashing so hard against each other he doesn’t even know how they can exist in the same space. He thinks,
There’s no lying about the turn of the tide; he has taken it in, Malfoy’s misery, even if he doesn’t quite know what’s happened to him or how he feels exactly. He has let the pathos trailing in the wake of Malfoy’s anguish crash into him.
Harry thinks with a burst of something joyous behind his sternum, seeing Malfoy act more like himself than he has any other time this past week.
“How come you’re... how come you’re wearing that?”
“Hmm,” Harry says, “what do you want to know?”
Harry turns off the lights with a flick of the wrist. He pulls the soft blanket off the sofa and spreads it over them both. Their legs tangle together, and Draco’s arms come up around him. Harry cradles the back of his neck, pressing a soft kiss to his forehead. Warmth spreads through him everywhere they touch. They sleep.
“Well,” Malfoy starts, “are you going to call me Draco?”
And it’s clunky, sometimes, because they have to take these steps, they have to make conscious decisions constantly to let old habits die, and they have to say them, act on them—and that’s hard.
Harry’s stomach gives a slight flip. “Oh... I didn’t think about it, really.” Not a lie; he didn’t. “Is it not how you like it?” Still not a lie, technically; it’s a question. But it’s a question he knows the answer to.
“Harry, it’s me!” The person shouts. Harry almost sobs with relief. It’s Chandra. As soon as she gets close enough, she points her wand at Mr Diggory again and puts him in a binding spell.
Harry nods and gives Chandra a grateful look before he Apparates.
“I see,” she says, obviously not convinced with Harry’s story. “Well, he isn’t home now. He works most evenings. You could come back tomorrow during the day. Or, well, I suppose you could stop by to see him at work. He’s at the White Lion in Brockley, just up the road,” she says.
His hair is still tousled, but not like he’s just woken up, more in the way Harry has only ever seen in Witch Weekly, when they try to make the men featured on their covers look all scruffy and casual. Certainly never own his own mess of a head.
They end up drinking the whole bottle, and Harry isn’t a lightweight by any means, but he’s quite tipsy by the time they Apparate home. He doesn’t usually drink wine. It affects him very differently than beer and whiskey.
Malfoy keeps his head up, though, up until the very moment the lift doors close in front of them. His shoulders sag, then, and his chin tilts towards his chest in a way that makes him look oddly vulnerable.
Harry looks up, and as he forms the words, a familiar sense of dread starts buzzing at the bottom of his stomach.
“Yeah,” Malfoy says, then a few beats later, “Can we Apparate from here?”
. He clears his throat. “Hogwarts felt like home. It really did. But it was… a home where peace was fragile. Fleeting. So I was always just, you know, waiting for that time when things would finally right themselves. Like, completely. First, a time when I would be surrounded by people that I love and people that love me. And when that happened, for a time without Voldemort. A time without evil.”
Harry thinks about how he, too, toasted his reflection last night—with four or five fingers of his best malt, in his nicest tumbler as well. But talking about that would open up a can of worms he’s not willing to talk about out loud—about the rage stuck in his throat like phlegm since the War ended. A memo whooshes into the room before he can incriminate himself, hits him square in the forehead, and flutters softly into his lap.
“Go home, Harry.” The look Chandra is giving him, the rare instance of her use of his first name—not
They land in the Atrium. As soon as Harry rights himself, he looks at Malfoy instinctively. He looks fine at first glance, but he also looks like he’s concentrating very hard on keeping it together.
“William, why is there a broken—oh. Sorry, I didn’t know—I thought you were out smoking. Hi,” she says to Harry, smiling at him; beaming, really.
Robards looks at him for a long moment, scratches at his jawline with blunt fingertips. “I can’t spare two Aurors for this, Potter,” he finally says. “Not right now, with a killer on the loose and resources already strained as is. But it also isn’t possible for a single Auror to be watching him around the clock.”
“Harry,” Draco says back from the kitchen table. He grins.
Malfoy just keeps looking at him without saying anything, and without the whiskey that helped him be brave last night, it makes Harry slightly anxious.
He’s about to slam the door in Harry’s face for the second time this morning, and Harry has to act fast, so he says, before the door closes, “The last victim was Theo Nott.”
Malfoy shakes his head. “Not at first. But I did, later, when Crabbe and Goyle looked at me funny when I asked them if they knew the Red Hot Chili Peppers.”
Draco’s eyes reflect a single-minded kind of courage. “Wasn’t he?”
them. And so he doesn’t have to have words for them, at least not for now. He feels Draco on top of him, feels the weight of him, feels his thighs clenching and unclenching around his hips.
“Who was on duty?”
“Malfoy, maybe this was—”
But by God, does it suit him; by God, does he look absolutely breathtaking indeed.
, he thinks with a pang as he looks at Malfoy’s limp body. A ghost of the future.
He gives Malfoy an apologetic smile; Malfoy looks away. Harry clears his throat.
Harry doesn’t ask. Instead, he says “Morning,” and then, “I made tea.”
, but Hughes manages to slip in a few celebratory dog whistles, obvious enough to serve as a source of malicious joy for those secretly happy about the murders, but too discreet to get her in trouble.
And fuck, Harry hasn’t even thought about that. How it must look that, after all this time, it’s not only that the one person Draco Malfoy shows up with after half a decade is Harry Potter, but the other way around too: Harry rarely ever goes out anymore, except when Ron and Hermione manage to drag him anywhere the person per square kilometre ratio is higher than ten. Which happens possibly twice a year.
for this job—”
“I—I don’t know,” he says, honest. He doesn’t know how to be anything else right now. “Can you imagine—do you know how that looked? Me knowing you, Draco Malfoy, and, and you’re just, you’re just there, on a stage in a Muggle pub, I’m—how was I supposed to react to that?”
It screams of a held-back sneer, and Harry wonders how or why Malfoy has learned to school his haughtiness into something more refined. Then his nostrils widen on a large inhale, his right hand reaches for the glass, and before Harry can blink, he tips his head back and downs it.
That's what the papers have named the murderer.
Malfoy takes it in stride. He looks ahead, doesn’t address anyone but the waitress—who doesn’t seem to recognise him, at least. At the same time, Harry isn’t quite sure how, he manages to look bored. As if he’s only just come back from a short holiday, not five years of complete absence, only to make his first public reappearance with Harry Potter, of all people.
“Yes, that would be for the best,” Harry starts. “But his mother says she has tried to talk him into that already, to no avail. And trust me when I say... if there’s one person in the universe Malfoy will listen to, it’s his mother. I don’t think there’s any use trying.”
One that Harry frequently passes by as well, but he’s never been inside. Now it taunts him with its big, golden letters above the arched doorway, daring him to go inside. He forgot to ask Katie what Malfoy does here exactly, but he can’t really imagine him cooking or cleaning dishes. Not that he can imagine him behind the bar, serving beer, but it still seems like the more likely possibility.
It makes Harry sick in the way many things do these days.
“As soon as this is handled, I’ll tell you everything. I’ll come find you. I promise. Alright?”
did he think that was light, that’s
Harry shakes his head. “Padma said it was wiped on purpose. She found traces of a magical signature, but not enough to go off of.” His fork hovers over his chana masala for a second, then takes a sharp turn and stabs into a chunk of not-chicken, leaving a greasy, red stain on Hermione’s Tupperware. Hermione smiles smugly.
When the lift closes behind them, he turns to Malfoy. “Have you decided where you’ll wait for me?”
“Oh,” the girl says, looking mildly suspicious. “William? Do you—do you know him?”
is the Malfoy he knows, the snooty bastard spitting his name with unadulterated disdain, the grisly sneer fitting his pointed features so perfectly that for the first time since he’s got himself into this entire mess, Harry feels like the world has finally righted itself.
For the first time since he saw him in Lewisham, Harry allows himself to take a detailed look at Malfoy’s face: he looks the same and different at the same time. His mouth is just as Harry remembered, slightly lopsided whenever he’s uncomfortable or angry, his top lip thin and arched, his bottom one thicker, jutting out slightly.
Harry doesn’t know if the reason he startles is because he’s been so lost in thought, or if Malfoy’s newfound quietness has spread to his way of walking.
When he gets to what is supposed to be Malfoy’s flat, he frowns. It’s a white terraced house, utterly indistinct, but Harry reckons he shouldn’t be surprised about that after everything else. What confuses him is that there are two names on the rusty post box in front of it, and neither of them are Malfoy’s. Which means he’s either using a fake name, or Narcissa gave him the wrong address. He walks up the single step to the door and knocks, holding his breath.
to do with this! Everything to do with what you deserve—you ignored me, you ignored my suffering, so he—so he has to die. This is the only way you will truly know what it feels like. What it feels like to be robbed of the light of your life too soon, what it feels like to live with the knowledge that years—
in his flat so much that he has to sit down for a second. God, he hasn’t even told Ron and Hermione. How the
Then they pop into Eeylops to buy Harry’s owl, Hendrix some food. “After Jimi?” Malfoy’s eyes light up. “Yes,” Harry says back, trying his damndest not to look too proud of himself.
“Obviously. What for?”
When they both try to suppress a yawn at the same time, and Harry collects their plates and glasses, Malfoy wordlessly picks up a kitchen cloth and dries whatever Harry washes.
But Harry has never thought Malfoy had a soft mouth before, and he does now; almost pliant in a way. And he’s almost sure it’s not the Firewhiskey. Malfoy
Oh, no.
When Draco doesn’t get any more than that despite his quirked eyebrows and stare, he sighs. “You didn’t get anywhere with the interviews?”
“Whoah,” Harry manages. Malfoy points at his glass, indicating for him to follow suit. So Harry does.
“Malfoy,” he shouts into the flat, and a blond head peeks out from what seems to be the kitchen right opposite the entrance. The expression on the face attached to it quickly turns from shocked to furious.
“I suppose everyone thinks some tremendously significant thing happened to me,” Draco continues. “Something tragic. Or some grand adventure. But the truth is... nothing really happened. That’s—that’s the point, you know? That’s what gave me pause, I—my mother and father sent me to France to get me away from all of it, you know. The people, the hatred, everything. Told me I could come back when it all died down.”
His voice is softer than he means it to be.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looks at him, eyes grateful. “Yeah. And then... suddenly, there was all the space. All the time. My mother put me up with a relative in Burgundy. I was just there—I wasn’t doing anything, just lying in bed all day and feeling like I didn’t have a place in the world. Like this body, these thoughts, these ideas, these memories... they were not mine. They didn’t feel mine. I would look in the mirror in the mornings and think,
Malfoy happened—Draco, actually. Draco happened. He happened to put no less than two bottles of wine in front of Harry last night. And he told him all those things about France and Muggles and himself and his mother. And he was happy with Harry’s taste in music, and he did an endearing little dance to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. And—and oh, yes, Harry is in love with him now.
A sudden, cold sense of understanding makes the back of Harry’s neck go numb.
Not as bad as Harry expected; he’s kind of disappointed with the lack of the disdainful
Sometimes, when he can’t quite warm his big bed enough to be able to go to sleep, he imagines it all different: Hermione as Minister for Magic, the apathy of officials disappearing, and the nepotism and influence of old money and bloodlines disappearing, too. Everyone getting what they deserve. And then he wakes up in the morning and gets dragged back to reality, the bitter dryness of his overbrewed Assam washing away any remainder of sweet, childish fantasies.
“By all means.” It’s Chandra who speaks up, gesturing at the still-empty piece of parchment before her.
The realisation hits him like a splash of cold water to the face. He got fooled again for the second time in as many minutes, but now he knows—Draco is just as nervous as him. He’s just better at hiding it. Better at pushing through it and clutching onto some sense of paper-thin confidence that is lost as soon as it’s questioned.
.” He grabs Draco’s other wrist, pulls him closer, and kisses him in earnest. Draco wraps his arms around his neck and sighs into his mouth softly.
“Not possible to you, daft boy. In the future it is.” His face turns bitter. “And what do you know, there are more surprising things in the future than an unrestricted Time Turner.”
It’s dawning on him just how bizarre this situation is. Having Malfoy in his flat is one thing, but for them to talk like this, for Malfoy to share such a delicate memory with him, for Harry to come to his defense—it’s so inside out, so foreign and new that it scares him, because he doesn’t know where it’ll go next, and whether he’ll know what to do with it.
“Look at all these people,” Malfoy says, looking out the window. “They can’t wait to run home and Firecall everyone and say,
Malfoy is not a bartender, and not a waiter at all.
He calls over his shoulder, “French toast okay?”
Malfoy laughs. A breathy little thing, almost quiet enough that Harry can pretend that he didn’t hear it, that it definitely wasn’t a response to his wide-eyed ogling. “Yes,” he says, “I always do when I go to bed drunk. Although the positions I find myself waking up in the mornings are most undignified.”
“At the White Lion. When you came to see me.” Draco averts his eyes. “I thought you—that you must have walked in by accident. That you saw me and just ran for it. Because you still hated me so much or something.” He lets out a quick breath through his nose and looks up at Harry. He looks determined, like someone who’s wanted to say something for a while. “But I don’t—why did you run away?”
“What?”
Harry barely listens. He looks at Draco’s limp body again, panic surging through him. “Mr Diggory, please—please let him go. He had nothing to do with—”
He opens his desk drawer and takes out a piece of parchment, unrolling it and placing it in front of them. “Please read it thoroughly before signing,” he says.
(See the end of the chapter for
But Harry’s a bloody coward, too, so he doesn’t. He just reaches out, and grabs the part of Draco closest to him—his ankle—and squeezes lightly. “It’s okay,” he says gently. “You don’t have to say any more if you don’t want to.”
“Get on with it, then,” he says.
“Right.”
Why am I—” his voice cuts off a little, and he pauses; allows himself a shaky intake of breath.
He stops right in front of Harry, the tip of his wand jabbed into Draco’s neck.
“Malfoy. Something is off about him.”
Harry looks at him. His best guess is that Malfoy is a coward, like he always has been, and he ran away from the confrontations he inevitably would have had to face in the wizarding world. That’s the obvious explanation for why he doesn’t want to go back; but his whole reservedness about being a potential target doesn’t fit the picture at all.
“Yeah.” Draco puts down his guitar and gets up from the armchair. He walks over to Harry and sits down right in front of him, cross-legged.
“Hi,” Harry says back, smiling politely.
“What—he, but he wasn’t even—”
Without the alcohol loosening his strains, and without Draco’s dizzying closeness, he realises the weight of his feelings, the weight of all this, and a little knot of panic slowly knits itself into a ball at the bottom of his stomach.
Malfoy sticks by him when they arrive in the Ministry, and settles by the window again. He nods at Chandra when she enters the room. She waves and settles in the chair opposite Harry.
Harry supposes that Malfoy does sense it, because he doesn’t bring any more bottles of wine to Harry, or suggests spending time together outside of mealtimes. Or maybe he doesn’t sense it, maybe he simply doesn’t want to spend time with Harry when not necessary.
“It’s good,” Harry says back.
Harry looks at Draco. He takes in the determined set of his mouth, the sweet blush on his ears. But his words refuse to penetrate through to the part of his brain that can make sense of them. “He’s unhinged,” Harry says. His own voice sounds foreign, detached from him. “He was babbling. He wasn’t making any sense.”
Malfoy looks at him again, fierce. His voice is so quiet now that Harry can barely hear him. “ Because I don’t deserve to be.”
Harry shakes his head. He can’t look at Draco. He doesn’t know anything.
“Harry. Harry, it’s okay.” It’s Chandra. She’s squeezing his arm, searching his face. “Harry, look at me.”
And so he comes to the maddening, dizzying conclusion that none of it matters. That he can't control the tide. That the storm is always going to be stronger than any flimsy dam he builds to fight it.
Draco looks up, sharp. “Yeah? Tell me one.”
He laughs again. Malfoy looks at him funny.
until Draco laughs at him softly. “Later,” is all he says, and Harry honestly doesn’t know how he’s so cool about this. The question sticks in his brain like honey; he needs it out, because he feels they’re not on equal footing here, and it’s bothering him.
“So... suppose you’re right and something is off. Do you actually think—do you mean he might be involved in the case?”
And the sooner that happens, the sooner they can leave this strange limbo behind. The sooner Harry can get to the bottom of this. So he digs through the back of his pantry for a bottle of Firewhiskey, which he sets on the table loudly enough to make Malfoy flinch and look up from his near-empty dinner plate. When he registers what’s on the table, he frowns and looks up at Harry.
“He’s hiding something.”
Why indeed.
“His son.”
“In that case,” Robards says, “wouldn’t it be in everyone’s best interest if he could somehow be convinced to return to Wiltshire for the time being? Sending out a negotiator is arguably not a big enough resource to be suggestive of preferential treatment.”
He hasn’t had anyone shower at his flat in ages. He hasn’t had anyone over for so long that any noise he doesn’t make himself confuses him. He feels a distant pang of loneliness at that. Then the water stops, and Harry gets up, trudges to the kitchen, and sets out to make tea.
. Malfoy works in a Muggle pub.
“Draco… has not lived here for a long time,” she starts.
Harry scans the typewritten pages with practiced ease.
Malfoy stops chewing and looks at Harry with wide eyes. Then he looks away again, chews slowly, and dabs at his mouth with a napkin. “I guess that’s the pretend friendliness out the window,” he says quietly.
“Yeah, yeah, course not.” Malfoy waves a dismissive hand at him. “Wrong choice of words, my bad.”
Harry wonders if Malfoy is letting his guard down because he’s too hungover to care, or because he feels more comfortable around Harry now that he’s put his cards on the table, showed Harry his vulnerability. The latter option makes him feel a bit giddy.
Malfoy looks at him for a long moment. He squeezes his lips together, then says, determined, “No.”
“Like what?” Harry asks, heart in his throat.
“It doesn’t taste anything like chicken,” he whines. That earns another eyeroll from Hermione.
“Harry,” Draco says, approaching him slowly, clearly alarmed. “What is it?”
Harry looks at him. “Hm?”
Harry scans the document; it’s more or less what he expected, listing his duties as a temporary custodian, disclaimers about personal harm, and a Vow of Secrecy from Malfoy’s side.
He doesn’t know if Malfoy senses something, the subtle distance that Harry has put between them, the controlled way he turns to Malfoy, reacts to him. They go to the Ministry together—Harry still glamours Malfoy every time—or the field, then they come home, and they have dinner.
“I have a guest room. To the right.”
It’s also an entirely unseemly place for Malfoy to live. He even owled Narcissa back to make sure she got the address right. Not only does Malfoy live in the Muggle world, but instead of Kensington or Mayfair or somewhere equally as posh, he apparently lives in bloody East London. A place completely outside the realms of the luxurious hauteur he grew up in, filled to the brim with working class people instead. The more Harry learns about this case, the more puzzled he becomes.
Malfoy looks at him, deadpan, grips the strap of his duffel bag and starts walking. “Wearing what? Use your words, Potter.”
“The letter was a Portkey. But you knew that before I realised, didn’t you—” Harry rubs at his eyes. “I’m so sorry—I’m such an idiot, I could’ve killed you, you could’ve died—”
Harry shakes his head no. “Patil didn’t find anything.”
Harry stares at him. He rewinds the tape in his head, reviews all the meals they’ve had this week. “But... I made beef stroganoff yesterday,” he says, confused.
Malfoy looks at him, swallows again, and asks, “Where to?”
Malfoy winces, eyes large, darting from Harry’s wand to his face. “What are you doing?”
Narcissa huffs a humourless laugh. “That makes two of us, Mr Potter. What I do know is that Draco is vulnerable in the non-magical world. Unsafe. His address is not connected to the Floo Network, so you will have to Apparate as close as you can, keeping in mind it is a Muggle neighbourhood—”
Draco freezes on top of him. “Ah, fuck, I’m sorry, I got carried away—” He makes to move out of Harry’s lap. Harry grabs his wrist.
Chandra and Harry stare at him. Chandra speaks up first. “What?”
Despite what Harry has interpreted as a minor breakthrough during lunch, their afternoon is spent in a similar, accidental-but-deliberate state of ignoring each other. And by dinnertime, Harry has had enough of the awkwardness. He’s had enough of not knowing what Malfoy’s deal is, not being able to decide if he should keep a closer eye on him or not.
He doesn’t want to see how Malfoy must look when he pushes the doors open. It’s enough to hear his deep, shaky intake of breath.
Harry wants to say something sappy and stupid, and then he catches himself, but the next thing he wants to say is also sappy and stupid, and so he has to pause for a bit to think. Finally, he just says “whatever you want to play,” and that’s lame, he knows that. But it’s better than saying “a love song” or “something just for me”.
Harry’s cold, sharp laugh makes her stop mid-sentence, shocked. “I can’t imagine? Really? Really, from
The truth is that Harry hasn’t allowed himself, in the past five years, to think about what he might do when he’s finally faced with the ghosts that rage beneath his river of oblivion, demanding to be dealt with. And what he does, in a bout of spontaneous desperation, is be cruel.
Harry takes some twisted sense of pleasure in her unmoving face, the lines between her eyebrows remaining soft. In the fact that he can say anything to her, and he knows she will not spit back at him, because it’s her who needs a favour from him, and badly. It makes him feel sick, somewhat, but it also embalms the festering holes in his chest; and he knows it won’t last long, that it will eventually grow into lye, swelling the wounds into craters again, but he’ll take anything now, any fast relief that will slow the violent thrumming in his veins.
Malfoy’s shaky intake of breath, the movement of his Adam’s apple as he swallows when he looks around Diagon don’t escape Harry. If what Narcissa said is true, Malfoy hasn’t set foot in the wizarding world for years. Harry is only just realising how unnerving it must be to be back after so long, even if he has no clue why Malfoy chose to be a voluntary outcast.
tend to.
The song Draco sings is Starry Night by Don McLean!
Friday morning greets Harry with a pounding headache. He groans; he should’ve started drinking water before the end of the night. Then he thinks of Malfoy, wonders if he’s up. If he’s in the same state as Harry. If he can hold his liqueur. If he—
“Sorry, sorry. Just—threw me a bit, is all.” He laughs again. “You gotta admit, Malfoy, that isn’t something one would expect to hear from you.”
“What do you mean we’re never going to know?” Harry frowns.
The beginning of the week passes in a blur. Harry is busy interviewing people and setting up theories with Chandra and getting absolutely nowhere. He’s also busy trying not to let his gaze linger on Malfoy’s jawline or his mouth, not to care when he strolls into the kitchen in that stupid white shirt with his thighs and his dragon tattoo. He’s trying not to let his thoughts get away from him and build a little shrine for Malfoy in his cerebellum.
Harry frowns. “Under the care of a working Auror?”
“If not for the planet, then for not having to bail on literally every single charity function an hour early to have shitty kebab in Lewisham because of your aversion to finger food.”
“Good morning, Mr Potter. Please, do come in.” She stands aside to let him through, and Harry notices the fine lines between her eyebrows. He suddenly remembers sitting in the pub a few months back, Ron hitting the ceiling over the faint wrinkles around his mouth that he discovered that morning, Hermione giving him a gentle look and saying, “Darling, that’s nothing to freak out about. It’s proof that, despite it all, it’s happiness and laughter that have left their mark on you. It’s an imprint of you.”
“It’s French.”
“It’s Thursday.”
When the name finally circles around his brain long enough to hit a wall, he is instantly snapped out of his reverie. “She was a Snatcher during the War. Avoided Azkaban because they could never prove anything on her. Inconclusive evidence.”
Then the blaring crackle of Apparition takes over his headspace, drowning out the echoing melody.
Harry grins. “I love how much you hate every time that happens.”
and they’re shooed out of the head office.
It’s been easy, these past years. Malfoy hasn’t been around, and Harry has become quite the expert at letting people and things from his past lie. Dusty and forgotten. But he’s only human, and his brain keeps pushing it to the forefront, waving it in front of him like a child desiring the attention of a parent.
It makes his head reel, as if you’d known someone to be a certain way that bothered you and they suddenly turned around and decided it was stupid, and
“You can ask.” Harry can feel his heart hammering at the bottom of his throat.
Harry has never seen this part of the Manor. As Narcissa gestures for him to sit in one of the worn-in, rose-patterned armchairs by the glass wall looking out into the beautiful, wild, unkempt garden, he’s acutely aware of the game that has already begun mere minutes after his arrival; a game in which Narcissa appeals to his weaknesses.
“People were… looking,” he says slowly, eyes back in front of him. “I saw Granger.” A pause. “I didn’t want her to see me.”
“Related to Augustus Rookwood, I presume?” Harry asks.
His eyes are on Harry, resolute. Harry has never been so terrified. And he knows, in the instant that he thinks that, that it’s an exaggeration. But it rings real and true all the same. And he’s shaking with it. He needs to swallow against the lump in his throat.
“Shut up,” Chandra replies. “Brainstorm with me.” She slams a piece of parchment and a quill on the table. “We need to get somewhere. I know you’re more involved in every way imaginable, but—but it’s driving me insane too. Let’s get somewhere with this.”
And then it also says, quiet and conspiring,
“Muggle clothes,” Harry says, slightly strained; he sounds awkward even to himself.
Malfoy just looks at him, so vulnerable and open that it makes Harry’s stomach ache. He’s shaking, too, and Harry doesn’t think it’s a good idea to make him go on. He’s said enough, more than Harry thought he would, more than he thought was behind this all.
“How’d you reckon they’d lost a child in the War?”
The girl who opens the door is definitely not Malfoy. She’s young, mid-twenties at most. “Yes?” she asks.
“All done.”
When Katie shuts the door behind herself, he clears his throat.
The great news, he supposes, is the fact that he isn’t to leave Malfoy’s side for a second, so any and all outrage will suffer the weakening effect of being in the form of the written word, because he sure as hell isn’t going to meet either one of them while Malfoy is living with him.
Harry’s stomach flips, low and dangerous. “Anything.”
Harry shakes his head. “No. I knew he existed, but he went to Durmstrang. He was a few years younger than me. And the thing is... I’m not even sure he was in the country during the War at all. But he definitely wasn’t a Death Eater. His father was.”
Malfoy looks at him, the same look, and Harry thinks he sort of understands, now. Not with words—if you asked him, he wouldn’t know what to say, but he feels it. “Alright,” he nods. Hesitates. Then, “Do you want me to start?”
“That’s not possible,” he breathes, heart beating in his throat. Mr Diggory can’t be from the future. “The time limit—”
The bar is to the left, but neither of the two bartenders behind it are Malfoy. Harry supposes this is his chance to verify whether Malfoy is indeed the William living with a Muggle girl called Katie in Lewisham, or all this is somehow one giant misunderstanding.
? And here I thought you’d have learned your fucking lesson.” He stands abruptly and crosses over to the door with a few long steps.
Harry stares at the top of Malfoy’s head, his messy, floppy cut. He realises, with another painful little squeeze, that he has locks of white hair hidden among the blond. “Come on,” he says as gently as he can without sounding patronising. He crouches down, draws his wand slowly.
“How do you know that?” Malfoy asks him quietly.
“Yes, most of the time,” Harry says lightly. “But this is one of my more sound ideas, I’m sure. Come on, Malfoy. Don’t tell me you haven’t missed it.”
Except that he isn’t, and when he enters the cafeteria at lunchtime, he finds it empty of Malfoy. His stomach grows uneasy with regret. He shouldn’t have left Malfoy just like that, what if something’s happened to him, fuck, he’s an idiot—
“Portkeys aren’t meant to be one-way,” Draco speaks up. Harry and Chandra both look at him. “Any charm that attempts to divert them from their original purpose is reversible.”
Malfoy swallows, nods slowly, then closes his eyes. Harry blinks; his eyes seem to have a hard time adjusting to Malfoy’s timidity. He takes a deep breath, then, focuses on the task at hand, and casts a glamour charm at Malfoy’s face.
Draco fidgets, tucks a lock of hair behind his ear. “You can also ask me something.” He looks straight at Harry, eyes determined, and Harry knows he doesn’t have to ask “Anything?” He can just ask. He stares back and nods.
(See the end of the chapter for
He takes a deep breath before he knocks on the front door of Malfoy’s house, his heart beating so loud in his chest he can almost hear it. He would be embarrassed for the hitch in his breath when the door opens if he’d have time to dwell on it, but he doesn’t, because it’s Malfoy who stands in the doorway.
“Your flatmate mentioned,” he says, slightly strained. “Anyway—you. And your strange newfound obsession with Muggles.”
, his “obsessive behaviour”, or whatever, does come in handy sometimes.
Malfoy turns his head toward Harry and smiles. It’s not a sneer, or a grin, or even a sad little thing, one of those self-deprecating ones that seem the truest on his face these days. Just a tiny, conspiratory quirk of the mouth. Just for Harry.
to leave charity functions an hour early. I
Harry can’t quite believe he’s arguing for Malfoy’s protection, but he tries not to think about it too much, because it does seem like the right thing to do—regardless of the negative connotations his mind attaches to everything that has to do with the name. And the face. And everything else about him.
, his brain supplies helpfully.
He looks at Harry, eyes intense with an emotion Harry feels very familiar with.
Draco’s voice shocks him out of his thoughts. As if he’s been admiring a beautiful animal, and has forgotten the fence separating them was electrified. He grins at Harry; not smugly, but genuinely, like this were a joke they were both in on. And if anything, that catches Harry more off guard than his blatant call-out.
Draco seems to consider. “Anything?”
“Then I found out I was a wizard and went to Hogwarts, and—”
They have lunch at The Leaky. It’s Saturday, and it’s midday, and Harry didn’t think this through at all. The stares, the whispers in the shops were one thing; but to sit here, to commit to sitting down for a long period of time with people coming and going by the window next to them, sitting at the other tables around them... Harry hasn’t felt this uncomfortable in public since the end of the War, when people just wouldn’t leave him alone, wouldn’t let him catch his breath in public.
Chandra raises her eyebrows at him. “Why do you know this, Potter?”
“He isn’t,” Malfoy interrupts. “He needs to leave, unfortunately.” His eyes, sharp as steel, cut to Harry.
Harry looks at him, and he wills his face to convey authority and professionalism. “That you move in with me,” he says, true Gryffindor-style. No beating around the bush, no wavering.
It’s Draco, face flushed with something that makes Harry think of embarrassed determination.
His eyes are the same light, soft shade of blue teetering on grey; but they’re more tired than Harry has ever seen them. More aware. Less sure.
“Relax, Harry, it’s just a Stupefy.” The figure points his wand at Draco again, levitating him next to himself as he starts walking towards Harry.
Draco doesn’t look up, keeping his eyes on his guitar. Harry feels lightheaded. Warm. He swallows, and the sound of it is lost in the continuing echo Draco creates.
“I have another question.”
he wants to say. And he’s open enough with Chandra to say that, he just can’t now. He feels exhausted, too drained to talk, to explain. Like the invisible hand in his chest has squeezed all the blood out of his veins.
Harry reaches out and squeezes his arm. “Hey, Draco, it’s okay. Everything is okay now.”
