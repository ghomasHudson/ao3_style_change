"Blaise are you sure this is really worth it?" Pansy asked one late night a week later. They had been meeting up and reading through their textbooks and mapping everything out so that they would be able to brew the potion in complete and utter secrecy.
Severus seemed to take a while to decide on the best course of action, before inclining his head. "Yes you may, but only for a little while. I don't wish him to get distressed when he's only just started to make some progress."
Draco nodded his head, his tongue suddenly sticking to the roof of his mouth. "Y-Yes, I wanted to know if you were doing anything this weekend?"
Harry was relaxed on the bed, his grin softening and the glow from his sun kissed cheeks fading slightly in the cooling shade of the room. Draco slid up onto the bed and fell onto his side, curling an arm underneath his hand, his other hand coming up to rest on Harry's abdomen. He smiled softly as Harry's own hand came up and entwined their fingers together. Draco wriggled closer and pressed a smooth kiss to his lover's cheek.
That was all before that day when they had been called up to go to the hospital.
When the dot moved away from the dungeons and towards the fifth floor again, Harry was out of bed and hurrying out of Gryffindor tower before he could think properly.
Harry nodded and watched as the blonde turned and started to descend the stairs. "Draco!" he called out, not wanting the night to be over, not yet. The blonde looked back up at him with a frown, "I er ... I hope you sleep well."
The younger man shrugged, "I just wanted to kiss you -it's been a small dream for the past few weeks."
"Like our relationship you mean?" Harry muttered, a dark shadow passing over his face as he turned his face away from Draco's.
Frowning, Draco asked, "What plan was that? To just hand yourself over to a maniac?"
Harry had leant his face into the soft caress before turning to press his lips against Draco's palm. Draco bit the inside of his cheek, willing the small piece of affection not to deter him from his food. He had spent two hours preparing it. Oh, but the way Harry had taken the digit into his mouth and sucked gently, and flicked his tongue over the smooth ridges of his nails, he was lost. He erection was pressing so hard against his trousers that he was sure the zip would split in two. He stood up from his chair and walked around the table to where Harry was sitting before cupping his face in both hands and molding their mouths together in a hot, passionate kiss. Harry's lips were sweet with the tang of red wine. It only saved to make him more intoxicating.
Harry wrinkled his nose, completely unused to the smell of muggle condoms and just how greasy they were. Draco hadn't shifted from his spot, which was probably a wise idea seeing as he was still covered in their love-making. His skin has started to prickle with goosepimples. The blonde man flinched under his hand as Harry carefully wiped his body down. "How're you feeling?" Harry asked, his throat so hoarse from giving head and all the moaning.
"Why?"
With a sigh he dropped him down into his desk chair and clawed his hands through his usually immaculate hair. He didn't want to wake up tomorrow morning because if he woke up, cold and alone, he would then have to suffer the arduous journey of travelling back to Brittany with Harry excusing himself to brew potions that didn't need restocking, or rushing off the hospital despite him having a long weekend holiday marked off in the registry. All he wanted was for the man to love him again, was that really such a terrible thing? They'd been happy up until recently, hadn't they? Or was he just deluding himself? With a dry sniff, he reached for his quill and made another bullet point on the page, watching as the tiny drop expanded out into the grain. He let his hand go through the motions of the letters, watching the ink crawl and curve along the page.
He didn't realise that the tears were running down his cheeks until they dripped off his chin and soaked through the collar of his nightshirt. He sniffed loudly and wiped his cheeks roughly. "Do …" he hiccoughed, "Do you really mean that? Are you sure?" his breath was coming out in rapid huffs, "I mean you can still walk out. I know it's been ten years but you're still young –in spirit –you don't really need me dogging you the res –"
Releasing his lover with a wet 'pop', Harry leaned up on his arms and knees and sat cross-legged between Draco's strong, pale thighs. "Try and relax, okay?"
Harry could not remember the last time that the bathroom felt so far away from their living room -it was as though the hallway had been elongated to make him suffer. He winced as his wavering legs moved one in front of the other, Draco steadied him whenever he strayed from the general pathway, but nothing he could do could make Harry feel so -dependant.
"Of course not, Master Malfoy, but sometimes having someone read it to you will fix it a little firmer into your mind so that you are more likely to remember it at a later date."
"Why do you say that?" Draco asked with a frown.
Finally he sighed and clutched the Biro so tightly that he feared it would snap in two.
A wet nose nudged his hand as he stood above the armchair, looking down at the embroidered covers. He glanced down at their dog and traced a pattern on the golden head before turning and collapsing backwards into the silvery-grey, curved backrest, his face returning into the comforting cup of his hands. He sighed heavily. He let his hands fall over the arms of the chair, the soft, delicate needlework felt familiar underneath his tracing fingers.
A faint blush crept on Harry's cheeks, but Draco ignored it as he unwound the tan arms from his waist. Harry let him, a gleam in his eyes that tickled the hairs on the back of Draco's neck. Loosening his tie and undoing the buttons of his waistcoat, Draco allowed his polished shoes to guide him down the hall to their bedroom.
It should have been
Draco was momentarily surprised. He hadn't expect a retaliation. Especially not from Potter! Smirking to hide his surprise he looked down his nose at the shorter boy and murmured, "So you want to play this game then, Potter?"
How time had flown.
Suffice to say Harry was glad for being all battered and bruised; it meant that he didn't gave to explain his hickey's over breakfast the next morning.
It had been a few years after that summer that everything had started to go wrong. It had started off fairly simple at first; a missed meal here, a late night there, but sooner or later Harry had started taking up night-shifts that would bleed him dry of both energy and liveliness. It hadn't been so bad at first, just a couple of incidents over the space of a couple of months. It hadn't really bothered Draco at all, a minor irritation that was quickly dissolved when Harry would take a couple of days off to spend with Draco. They had taken daily strolls around Brittany, dipping into each and any shop that took their fancy, and even stopped inside a coastal hotel that looked out over the sea and the sandy beach below. They had sipped at sweetened teas and eaten little cakes from a sweet, elderly muggleborn lady who had a young wizard for a grandson who would race along the sea wall with his friends, a little wooden muggle train clutched in his hand. Draco would chatter away about the incessant regulars who came into the shop almost daily to demand the newest stock he had. He would then listen to Harry about the abnormal amount of aurors he got in weekly who got splinched whilst apparating and using the floo network. One man had lost his eyebrow in Switzerland!
"W-what?!" Harry rasped out, his eyes wide and confused.
Draco could remember watching the dark-haired man stand gracefully and make his way over to the large ornate doors keeping the draft from the hallways from entering the room. The way he'd tugged the tartan blanket over his lap he turned toward the fireplace and closed his eyes to the soft heat emanating from it. As much as he slept he still felt tired and arguing with Severus just increased the pressure in both his head and in his chest.
He wanted to have air fill his lungs.
More like an 'ugly' way.
"So where are you taking me Mister Money-bags?" Harry asked with a teasing smile, as they walked casually up the high street, his arm wound around Draco's waist.
Draco shook his head, "I told him to get help so many times but he refused and snapped at me. He'd gotten so tiresome I almost didn't
Suffice to say that Severus was not happy about this abruptly change of plans on such short notice was a gross understatement. He did already know of Draco's illness but his anger was somewhat placated when Harry explained to him the personal assignment and that if he started it now than it should be ready to publish, success of fail, in the medical journals straight after the exams were marked and returned. The greasy-haired man leaned back in his chair in his office and hummed low in his throat. "I can't say that I am happy about this change in plan, Harry," Severus stated in a bland voice, "However, I suppose it would add credit to your final marks and it would give Ronald and Dennis the chance to step up and actually do some work here instead of hoping you will do it all. Yes, I did notice," he added with a frown down at his protégée, before sighing and inclining his head, "As long as Lucius is alright with you staying there for a few days longer you may have the rest of the week off but be back to work first thing on Monday morning, do you understand?"
“It’s broken,” Harry said.
cheats on Harry Potter? Who cheats on
Then Harry is laughing too, despite the shock still evident in his gaze. Dropping his broom, he steps forward to press a firm kiss to Draco’s mouth. “I bet mine’s bigger,” he says, grinning rakishly, before drawing his wand, and nearly yelling, “

“Ah!” Draco rears up, coming to stand properly on all fours, knees spread wide. Panting, hair falling into his sweaty face, Draco cranes his neck to glance at Harry, whose chin is gleaming with saliva, teeth slightly bared as he stuffs his fingers in and out of Draco. “Fuck me,” Draco tells him quietly, bucking back onto the three stiff digits. “Fuck me, Harry.”
Harry’s soft splutter is lost in the loud, sultry

She’s leaning forward slightly, her expression empathetic but also slightly pained. “I—” My voice is hoarse and I quickly clear my throat. “I haven’t the slightest what you’re on about,” I croak, but I already know there’s no use.
Malfoy led Scorpius to the stairs without comment or instruction; Harry expected him to disappear upstairs without looking back.
On the floor, casually lapping at the largest puddle, was a long, extremely fluffy, snow white ferret, its pink ears and nose wiggling every few seconds.
Potter had stared, his throat bobbing as he swallowed hard, his gaze dark as it roved over Draco’s face, his whole form, before nodding and saying, “Maybe you could brew me some more potions?”
Malfoy’s cock was smooth, pink and was already glistening with a coat of precome where it lay on his flat belly, oozing head peeking out from under the silken looking foreskin. His balls were a shade darker, slightly wrinkled where they met his body, and looked soft and sensitive. He had a triangular thatch of trimmed blond hair, neat and sharp along the sides almost as if he’d used a ruler and a razor to shave off the rest.
” Malfoy gritted out vehemently. “What happened was completely consensual, okay, Potter? So you can rest easy.”
“I lost
“Arse,” Draco mutters when Potter guffaws. “Why aren’t you shooting your silver beast at the rest of them?”
He’d been with Harry at the tattoo parlour when he’d gotten the twin black paw prints in memory of his godfather (Harry had jokingly referred to him as his ‘dogfather’ and had then laughed at his own joke for twenty minutes), a complete moon cycle in a gradient of grey in memory of Remus Lupin (elegant and also strangely titillating but Draco had never told Harry that), the bright, fiery phoenix as a tribute to Albus Dumbledore (and to the bird itself, as Harry had insisted), a beautifully illustrated cat to pay homage to Minerva McGonagall (complete with the exact same markings around the eyes), a pink umbrella with miniscule sparks shooting out the pointed end for Hagrid (something Draco hadn’t really understood at first but had just accepted because it made Harry smile that crinkly-eyed smile for a long time) and the deathly hallows symbol which Harry got inked right underneath the scar that the horcrux had left on his chest.
“Well, someone had to step in.” Harry laughs. “You wouldn’t let me touch you or even look at you properly and Merlin knows that you’d have bitten my head off if I’d brought it up with you.”
love on me, by the way!” Draco interrupted him, still waving the ruined robes around. “Do you see a pattern here?!” He paused here, teeth bared as he glared daggers at Harry.
thereafter.
“And I haven’t ‘bonked’ this one yet, so...” He shrugs like it’s self explanatory and heads into the bathroom, leaving the door ajar. I hear the scrape of the shower curtain being pushed aside, the squeak of a tap and then the rush of the shower running.
“Hi,” Draco finally says, breaking the nerve-wracking silence. Harry lets Caesar bound out of his arms, tucking his thumbs into his pockets and bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet. “You look so much better,” Draco says, the wonder in his own voice clear.
The party is loud and cheerful and by the time the last of their guests are Flooing out, Scorpius is throwing up because he ate too much cake, and Harry is standing in a quiet corner of the room, carrying Lyra who’s fast asleep with her face buried against his neck.
“No,” Harry says pointedly. “Something else. It’s rubbish and I’m absolutely not interested, but those nagging shits won’t take no for an answer.”
“Who’s the guy?” Malfoy’s tone was so familiar that Harry could almost picture him – one eyebrow raised, eyes slightly narrowed in suspicious appraisal.
“I’m not waving anything in your pointy face, Malfoy!” Potter retorts sullenly.
James reached for something behind Harry and then lifted Lily into Harry’s arms. When Harry nestled her close, he saw she was conscious and once again cocooned in a Warming charm. Looking up at him, she sobbed once, her lip trembling, her eyes terrified. She looked utterly exhausted. At once Harry knew that absolutely could not let another dementor anywhere near her for as long as he could manage.
“You’re having my parents sent to Azkaban?” he asks softly, his tone so frighteningly frigid that the ball of dread slowly unravelling inside Harry’s stomach is suddenly exploding all at once, his blood turning cold in his veins.
Draco cups his face gently, still grinning like a loon. “You certainly did, Potter.”
Fuck off, Draco wants to spit. But then Potter is pressing damp, open-mouthed kisses along Draco’s neck and it’s all Draco can do to simply melt into the mattress, his whole system shutting down with record speed.
“You’re a

“Well?” Malfoy yells, gesturing to himself, “Here,
It’s the most intimate Draco has let himself get with anyone and so the knowledge that they still haven’t addressed what Harry had revealed is a constant thorn in Draco’s side. He doesn’t, however, have it in him to bring it up, Harry’s expression of shameful defeat from that evening still fresh in his mind.
. Would you like to go get lunch somewhere?”
The jug must’ve been self-filling because after Harry drank his own share and put it back, it still sloshed heavily with water. Malfoy was still sitting up, and when Harry pulled back he spoke again, soft and hesitant.
He’s shaking now, Draco, his thighs and hips aching with the strain, his throat dry and rasping from breathing in through his mouth. Each exhale of his comes out as a high-pitched, needy little keen, his fingers tightening around Harry’s hair in warning yet again.
Harry just takes it all in rather blankly, looking down Diagon Alley on his left and Knockturn Alley on his right before turning around on the spot once, feeling completely lost.

Looking very serious now, Malfoy said, “I would have to agree. You seem absolutely incapable of protecting yourself
to openly investigate the matter,” Draco says, voice icy and low. “He told everybody that the boy died of dragon pox and then proceeded to lock our Veela ancestry in archaic blood magic. The following generations all had their Veela genes repressed so they – we – simply appeared to be,” he smirks slightly, albeit with a modest tilt of his head, “just slightly above average in the looks department.”
Malfoy’s mouth sags open, and he plucks his glasses off his nose to glare incredulously at Harry. “Are you on pain potions or are you simply inebriated?”
I give no fucks this time. “I have no desire to be friends with that fucking arse-wipe.”
“Word spreads, Potter,” Draco says quietly. “Gnopf is well known and he didn’t bother keeping mum about it.”
with you?!”
“No.”
Potter now just stared straight ahead, cheeks and ears flaming red, hands clenched into fists in his lap. Draco slid onto the stool next to him and placed neatly clasped hands on the bar, looking around the pub with great interest as though he had never seen human beings before.
“Why?”

Harry remembers being so completely out of it that when he’d finally spotted the head of platinum blond, glinting under the multicoloured strobe lights, he’d not given himself more than two seconds to consider it before meandering over, ears ringing and vision swimming. He’d felt like someone he’d never ordinarily be, someone who’d regularly and gleefully throw back drinks with mysterious pills mixed into them, someone who’d find nothing more amusing than bellowing at his friend to climb atop a bar and thrust his pelvis out at the room – he’d felt more reckless than he had in years, had felt exhilarated and

asking him a dozen questions. When he looks from Potter’s hand on his arm up to his face, he notes the same enquiring glint in his eyes –
“You’re into balls, then?” Harry murmurs, releasing Malfoy’s prick to reach further below and locate his wildly swinging balls and tug, thrusting steadily into the wet heat of Malfoy’s arse, hips pumping so hard that they bounce right off the fleshy softness of his bum. “D’you enjoy having a pair in your mouth, Malfoy?”

Harry swallows the saliva that floods his mouth just from looking at Draco’s pink, moistened lips. “You know,” Harry reaches out and tucks a strand of impossibly soft, pale golden hair behind Malfoy’s delicately rounded ear, “I don’t remember much of that night at all. Seamus slipped something into my drink when I was already sozzled,” he rolls his eyes when Malfoy smirks again, “and I suspect that contributed to me retaining almost
Draco had seen that tattoo seven years ago for the very first time and since then had never failed to find it – and every other tattoo on Harry’s body – rather exceptionally beautiful every single time he stared at it for more than a few seconds.
“You didn’t hurt me,” Malfoy interrupts wearily. “You didn’t force me either.”
“Bill,” Ron half yells down to the other end of the table. “Up for some one-on-one Seeking? Ginny has a Snitch.”
“Will you marry me?” Harry asked quietly, plucking the ring out and tossing the box aside.
“Yeah,” Potter whispers back, and turns the page.
“A—a friend,” Harry lied quickly. “Decent bloke,” he added, feeling utterly
The blush spreading across those high, aristocratic cheekbones is unmistakable. “Getting a little ahead of ourselves, are we?” Draco nuzzles at him. “You’re a cocky bastard, aren’t you?”

“You need to move,” Malfoy said urgently. “Come on, move, push deeper--”
His hand slid, punishingly slow, so slowly that the lean muscles along the back of his arm started to get strained. And Malfoy, like it was the most natural thing to do, let his legs fall open slightly as Harry’s hand travelled up the side of his knee.

And now there’s more of it,
“Heedless of the fact that had he ended up hurting you, he’d have lived the rest of his life with the sort of guilt that would have probably killed him,” Weasley says, low and calm. “The man was barely just starting to get over the pit of depressed despair he’d fallen into since he was turned. And then
Harry emits a choked off sound as his stag erupts out his wand, leaping gracefully through the air and cantering around them twice before galloping off into the Forest.
Barely half a minute after he’d let himself into the alcove behind the tapestry with the angry centaurs on it, Harry was on him.
--and then, literally out of nowhere, he let out a little snort, his mouth turning up at the corners before he looked away, shaking his head with his eyebrows raised in exasperation.
“Are you, perchance, under the impression that I was on...a date of some sort just now?” Potter asks politely –
It’ll go away, he’d believed all through.
Ron chokes on his first sip of beer, Dean leans dangerously far back on his stool to stare incredulously at Draco, Seamus looks at him with his eyebrows somewhere up near his hairline, and I feel my bottle slipping from my suddenly clammy grasp.
She leaped off his lap with an indignant chirp and scurried away haughtily and before Harry could call out and coax her back, the goddamn phone rang again.
massive, my back hurts
The mid-morning sun beats down on his head, his hands beginning to sweat a little as he stands at the edge of the overgrown front garden, staring blankly at the filthy front door, the black paint on it flaking off, the enormous, brass knocker in desperate need of polishing.
His cry was still ringing around the kitchen when Harry, scissoring for a brief three seconds, pulled out his fingers, leaving Draco impatiently clenching for more. When he pressed the tip of his well-slicked cock to Draco’s hole, Draco became aware of his own whorish panting. Harry must have heard it too because instead of pushing in and fucking him like Draco was aching for him to, he simply slapped Draco’s arsehole with his cock, the wet smacks lewd and Harry’s evil chuckle ever lewder.
The water’s too hot as it sluices down his body; yet he doesn’t move or make to adjust the temperature any. He stands there, head bowed against the jets, eyes shut, hair hanging into his face, his palms braced against the tiles, shoulders slumped inwards.
“What,” Draco slurred, completely out of it.
of him as Draco sobs and trembles and spills inside his mouth. As Draco attempts to catch his breath, Potter starts pushing his fingers back into him, and Draco groans, pinching shut around his fingers and canting his hips up.
It’s cold enough that his ears hurt despite the thick, black earmuffs he’s got on. He can’t decide if it’s the snow that’s unnaturally white where it flutters down around them or whether the sky is just that densely black, but the scene around him looks oddly ethereal.
Now it just made him
mate, you mean,” Harry said flatly, eyes dull and groin aching.
And then,
Something in Draco snaps. “I think I am falling in—” Draco nearly slaps a hand over his own mouth as he breaks off mid-sentence. Harry’s eyes are very big behind his mud flecked glasses, his breathing suddenly ragged and loud.
Potter loudly smacked himself on the forehead.
Four... More than four—your wh-whole fucking
“Yeah.” Harry’s cock sprung out, half hard with a bead of moisture at the tip.
“Why?” Draco chokes out, more tears blurring his vision as he stares down at it, throat aching with suppressed emotion. “Potter, you giant
As though emboldened further just by that gasp, Potter drives his tongue deeper into Draco’s mouth, his hands squeezing Draco’s arse cheeks, massaging them apart in maddening circles through his trousers. Potter’s mouth tastes citrusy and strangely smoky and Draco isn’t even able to enjoy it as much as he’d like to because Potter is now brazenly jiggling handfuls of his bum, kissing Draco hard enough to send his head cracking back against the door and make his balls pull up painfully tight against his body.
Harry had barely just managed to kill the beast and send out a Patronus before collapsing, not daring to reach up and check his wound or stem the blood loss, and
Harry’s silent laugh vibrates against his skin, his arm tightening around Draco’s waist as he nuzzles into his neck. “I love you, Draco Malfoy,” he says softly, honest and indulgent.
And so he’d just found himself sitting quietly on the low wall that ringed the oval courtyard, as people had scooped up the scant bit of snow that had collected on the ground, and was basically just sludgy mulch at this point, and thrown it at each other, hooting and howling like a bunch of boorish kerns. Finnigan had climbed into the frozen fountain in the centre of the courtyard, slipping and sliding on the ice, to poke at the marble centaur’s gonads, and upon being dared to lick the bulbous carving (by his own boyfriend, no less) proceeded to get his tongue stuck on the centaur’s balls.
Draco smiled and watched as Harry drifted back along the corridor. "Hey Potter!" he called out when the brunette boy was several meters away. Harry turned with a faint frown. Draco smiled even wider, "I love you!" he called out, his cheeks hurting a little with all the smiling.
"That sounds fair -Seeker would love that wouldn't he?"
Draco rolled his eyes, "we're going on a little holiday -he needs a break from this sordid city"
It was a while until the shower spray shut off. It had been going on so long that Draco was tempted to go into the bathroom and make sure that Harry was alright. But the brunette man was soon coming out of the bathroom, a healthy glow blossoming on his cheeks and towel-drying his body. Draco smiled, "do you feel better?"
Completely unaware about what his friends were up to every night for the last three weeks, Draco went about his days in a somewhat bored fashion. It was all the same; breakfast, lessons, lunch, lessons, dinner, repeat. The only thing that would really break up the mundane cycle was whenever he would get a letter from his mother or if he would be sent a note from Harry during one of their classes, asking to meet him in the Room of Requirement after curfew. Since the Christmas Holidays, Granger and Weasley had been turning a blind eye to Harry whenever he disappeared during the night. They still supervised sometimes, and had even been getting along better with Draco as well, which he secretly felt proud over.
"If I didn't give a fuck, Malfoy, I wouldn't have asked!" Harry ground out in response.
"Mister Potter what are you doing out of bed?" snapped the nurse briskly.
"Big words for you, Malfoy," Harry teased with a small smile.
The blonde man nodded from his position beneath Harry, "More than I was that night in the function room over twenty years ago and I thought to myself 'that young apprentice has the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen –I wonder if he has a beautiful voice to match'."
Harry let the letter droop in his hand and he ran his fingers over his face. Draco had taken ill again? That was three times in the last two months, no one should be getting that ill that often without someone finding the proper cause for it. He pursed his lips tightly. He needed to do a little extra research, he was sure he had missed something in Draco's personal file that Severus had allowed his to study for his presentation. He wanted to be able to help Draco, even if he had to create a potion from scratch for that very purpose. Judging from the symptoms that Draco had written about in previous problems he was sure that there was a stronger potion and an additional salve that could be used to bring Draco's fever down and to help clear the air that got into his lungs. He just needed another month to brew it, which would eat a significant amount of hi studying time. However, he mentally concluded as he stared off out of his window, if he were to use Draco's illnesses as a means of passing his exams, the studying would simply go hand in hand with the potion. First off he would take one of the potions to Draco and access his responses and then alter the potion accordingly if it did not work.
Could he live with a world without Draco? Did he want to live in a world without Draco? Or would it be better for him to live in a world where Draco wasn't even there, and then he wouldn't have nightmares about killing someone who was already dead of unfortunate circumstances. He'd be able to get some proper sleep! He wouldn't have anything to worry about. No more graveyard shifts at the hospital and he could go home at whatever time he wanted –to an empty house. Whatever brief flicker of bliss he may have felt was immediately drowned in the black lake in his head at the thought of waking up alone and falling asleep alone every night no matter what. He wouldn't have the miniscule relief of having the feeling of Draco's fingers slip between his own in the middle of the night when he was fast asleep –it had been like a phantom touch ghosting through into his sleeping mind and fighting the nightmare away. Even for a moment, but the relief washed through him like a warm wave.
He didn't say anything as he settled down on the stone balcony, his back to the stone pillars and loosening his tie. He bent his knees and propped his elbows up, before tilting his head back and heaving a soft sigh. Harry glanced over at the blonde, quickly checking to make sure that there were no bumps or bruises marring the flawless skin, before letting his eyes slip back over to the horizon.
natural for
weren't subtle in sixth year." His lips curled into a sneer as he adjusted his grip on his wand.
Draco smiled; feeling a little bit more relaxed. He could literally see the excitement bubbling up inside his boyfriend from across the kitchen table as he sipped at his wine."Only if you want to, there's no pressure and no rush. As soon as you say the word, we'll go looking for a puppy to adopt"
"Draco-o-o" Harry moaned lustfully as Draco kissed his hipbones, licking the soft skin. Draco was torn. He didn't wand to hurt Harry but he was burning with desire and Harry was spurring him on by clutching at his bed-hair. "Draco please! I'm not glass -I won't break! Please, please, PLEASE!"
And then came the whimpering.
"Indeed so, you have a sharp mind. Not that I doubted Severus of course. And in answer to your question, Mister Potter, yes; it would seem you made my son quite excitable and he had to stay in bed for the duration of the day."
Harry glanced around; sure enough a few people were in fact staring at him. He shrugged to Hermione, "It's probably some stupid Slytherin tactic to psyche me out before the first task. It'll blow over, don't worry."
Draco rolled his eyes at that one. He had to suppress a snicker or risk getting a confused look from Pansy.
Draco looked down at the brunette apprentice with mild surprise and couldn't help himself feel a little excitable at what that question might mean. He wasn't holding out any hope, but he did enjoy talking to the young brunette. He tried to fit in without being insolent and he was certainly fairly passionate about what he could do with his apprenticeship. "Are you offering me to be your first private patient Mister Potter? Because if that's the case then I must say that I am intrigued as to how you would proceed with helping me fight my ailments, as I have been assured without a doubt that they cannot be healed."
For days he had been awake all night and had debated on whether or not to go to the Room of Requirement. Not for anything in particular but just to see if anything remained. That moment had cinched the night for him, for the fear to spike. When he had watched Potter's broom turned around he had never felt so happy to see that scar-headed git's face, and probably never would again. It wasn't like all of that could be cast aside anyway. There was too much there for them to get past, not that he was even sure he wanted to. If the room had any magic left he wanted to use that magic to take him away for a little while, to a place where he didn't feel ashamed and didn't get people spitting onto the back of his robes or his shoes.
"Oh Harry, only you can make me laugh like an imbecile," he chuckled as he pressed a long, loving kiss to Harry's mouth before releasing him, to watch him hold the crane high over his head and release it into a sudden brutal gust of warm wind. They watched the bird flutter off towards the sea.
The lake water seemed to darken around him, as though something had swallowed the sun up. Draco's weight was becoming far too much of a strain as he fought to keep them away from the lakebed. He felt his head grow hot again but there would be no point in crying underwater. He didn't realise it immediately when he felt Draco's limp ghostly body slide out from under his arm and slowly began sinking back down into the darkening depths below. Harry wanted to cry out and reach down for him but he had no air left, no adrenaline fuelled fire in his muscles to keep him from sinking too. He tried to fight the darkness clouding in around him but it swarmed closer, clawing at him as stars filled his vision and he gradually lost feeling in his toes and fingers. His heart was erratic and becoming muffled in his ears as he felt his body grow heavy and slide further through the dark blue-grey water. His chest felt as though it was being crushed through a great amount of pressure, making it uncomfortable and suffocating as his eyelids blinked shut against the panic, the pain and the ghostly pale man drifting far below him no doubt never to be seen again.
Casting his tearful eyes around the room he clutched heavily at his hair, the heat from his anger brimming out of every orifice on his head. His eyes were blurred with the angry tears that had sprung up behind his golden lashes. How dare they! How dare they barge in here and take the love of his life away from him! He let out a series of cries, they were not squeals or wails or yells, they were merely the most horrifying sound anyone could make, the sound of trapped air releasing itself through ones mouth and ripping all oxygen from ones lungs.
topic brought up between them was enough to make them tense up. "So, Draco, Harry, Severus was telling me this morning about how he had recently bought a new house by the Lake District and has invited us along for two weeks in August. Isn't that lovely?" she beamed at the both of them, their haggard appearances not registering in her mind as she waited for a response.
Draco kicked the front door shut with a swift kick, and sighed.
He felt his stomach knot in disgust at himself as he had waited longer and longer to take the last train in the evening from Paris so that by the time he got home he was too hungry and exhausted to do anything other than fall straight to sleep as Draco would have fallen asleep at least two hours beforehand. He had even come home one night, around the same time as tonight, and had ended up crying himself into a state as Draco had fallen asleep on the table with a candle burning down to a stump in its holder and a roast poussin turned stone cold in front of him. Once he'd stripped the blonde and put him safely in bed and dispensed with the ruined food, he had gone down into the main shop downstairs, crouched into a corner behind the counter and cried and screamed into his knees whilst clutching at his ears so as not to wake Draco. He had cried until his skull had felt hot beneath his skin and his tears were scorching trails down his skin. He wept until he'd choked on his own saliva and blood from where he'd been biting his tongue.
after all, and I want to lay with my lover," the last word came out as a hushed whisper and seemed to caress Harry through the air.
Once they had eaten Draco placed both plates on the coffee table and cuddled Harry against his chest, rubbing soothing circles into Harry's car-sore muscles. The muscles unwound beneath his magical fingers and soon Harry was humming and moaning languidly as he closed his eyes into the tender motions and soon drifted off to sleep against the blond mans chest. Draco managed to stay awake until the movie they were watching ending, and only when the end credits started rolling up he screen did he start to yawn and feel his eyelids drooping heavily. He stretched his arms out behind his head and summoned a blanket from the bedroom. He placed the blanket delicately around Harry's bony shoulders, before fluffing the pillow behind him and nestling down along the sofa, with Harry's bald head nuzzled against his chest.
Running his fingers through Harry's silky black hair, he eased himself against from the other boys face and tugged him up onto his feet. Both panting, he spun Harry around and bent him over the desk, "Are you ready for me to open your Chamber of Secrets?" he purred as ran his length against the cleft of Harry's arse.
Draco felt dread knot in his chest. "So," he choked out in a strangled voice, "A list of what Harry and I have not been doing a lot of recently?"
Draco was in no mood. He had just woken up to yelling, he still had bed hair and morning breath and he was half-dressed. "Hermione just shut the fuck up!" he cried out, blood rushing up to his face. She turned to him again, about to start another tirade but he cut across her, "Harry is fine alright! I brought him home! He did not escape or anything like that! They're making shit up!"
The dark-skinned boy grumbled in reply before frowning, "Where is Draco tonight anyway? I thought he would have been here by now." He glanced over at the doors to the hall but most students were already seated and eating away, completely oblivious to the lack of blonde hair.
Harry felt guilt settle inside his mind as they walked along the cool terrace surrounded by the balmy evening air. A light breeze ruffled his hair and he inwardly winced, especially seeing as how Lucius' hair remained unaffected. Not a hair was out of place. "If you don't mind my asking sir, but is your son afraid of his condition?"
They linked their fingers together as they strode along the walk-way that over-looked the sea. Gulls cawed some distance along the shore. The dull buzz of nightclub music could be heard vaguely over the gentle hush of the waves crashing against the shoreline.
The rest of the day seemed to pass them by almost instantly as they dragged themselves to and from lessons. Potter was hardly ever mentioned, which was ironic considering just how much Draco used to complain about the boy. Now that they were friends -or was it more? -it was almost as though the scarred boy didn't exist to them anymore. Blaise couldn't deny that he sort of missed Draco's childish ramblings. True they had been annoying, but they had almost been a part of every day life. Now it was like a part of the boy was missing, and if getting that back, meant making the sod hopelessly in love with his once-rival, then so be it.
Halloween blurred by with Draco being tormented though he tried to keep his head low and get on with his work as best as he could. Not that the teachers cared whether he did write spectacular assignments. He accepted whatever grades he could get that were high enough for most basic jobs in the Ministry. He would take the task of being a social climber if he really needed to, because at this point he was expecting nothing less from the wizarding world.
"What happened?" Ginny asked from her seat opposite Harry. She had been trying to be discreet with her desire to talk to him but he really didn't need to have any conversations about the future. It was a sore subject for him and despite what she claimed; she really didn't understand why it made him feel physically sick to think of it.
Draco let out a dry chuckle, "Yeah, I guess so. It's a lot easier than I thought," he stated with a quirked eyebrow. To his surprise, Harry chuckled too as they both settled down against the fireplace, the firelight dancing over Draco's legs. They sipped at their drinks and talked in soft tones about nothing in particular. It was comfortable and calming and a much better way to spend the night.
He sighed as he fumbled with his key in his lock and pushed his bedroom door open and stopped dead. He blinked in surprise, feeling as though his eyes were playing a trick on him. "What are you doing here?" he asked in surprise, his stomach dropping through his shoes.
"Those stupid
"Oh, and Harry?"
"I know it hasn't seemed like it, but I have missed being with you," he murmured so softly he wasn't sure the blonde had heard him, "I don't know what is going on with me and I really wish I could fix it for you," he looked up to see that Draco's eyes were gleaming as much as his own. "I wish I could be good enough for you," he choked as his voice broke, his eyes so hot and exhausted from crying so much over the last few months that he shuddered and wrapped his arms tighter around himself.
Harry shifted, bracing himself on Draco's knee with one hand while he guided himself. It was uncomfortable at first. Harry grabbed a small bottle of lube -manually -and made it a little easier to slide inside the blonde. It took a little while, a lot of pushing and stopping and tiny thrusts to get Draco used to the intrusion.
Hermione rolled her eyes, "rubbish! They are professionals!"
And then came the night that Draco found out that Harry had died, and that he hadn't told anyone else about it.
"Don't do that," Draco pleaded softly, the gentle tone in his voice making Harry's heart twist in his chest.
"Hold still," Harry murmured drowsily as he placed a placating hand on Draco's tense butt cheek. He eased himself off of the bed and padded clumsily over to the small cupboard across the room. He grabbed a small pot with a salve inside and came back over to kneel beside Draco's legs. "You're going to need to unclench," he advised softly as he stroked Draco's hot skin with one hand and with his free one, he dabbed it into the salve.
"There would have been no guarantee that I would have gone to where you did. I might have gone to an even worse place."
At the very least it was another photo to their growing collection.
As if the 'Potter Stinks' badges weren't enough, Draco had decided that he desperately needed to rile Potter up more. He needed to get under the boys' skin and stay there. His plan was ingenious, of course everything out of his head was. He was Draco Malfoy after all.
Frowning, Harry asked, "Really?"
Besides, it had been a long time since any of them had done something devious for the sake of being juvenile. The war had made them grow up too quickly. It was time to grab their teen years back!
"No, love, not yet," at Harry's crestfallen features, Draco felt his heart ache, "do you want to get all snuggled up and I'll bring the laptop in here?" Harry nodded and watched as Draco left to quickly snatch up his laptop. Draco ran his fingers over the smooth object before slowly straightening his back and walking along the smooth floorboards to the bedroom. As he nudged open the door with his foot, he smiled warmly at the sight of Harry's face peering up from a cocoon of warm blankets. "Any room in that cocoon for me, Hun?" he teased with a soft glint in his eyes as he flicked his wand at the lamp on his side of the bed. The dull light shined off of Harry's smooth head, but it only managed to make him look more vulnerable and sweet.
Draco looked steadily into Harry's bright green eyes before sighing feebly, and pushing his chair out from underneath the table. He pushed himself up onto his feet and walked around the edge of the table, his fingers skirting over Harry's tense shoulder.
He hadn't told Draco. He'd barely written anything to the blonde man in the last month. He felt guilty about it, like he had abandoned the young master, but he couldn't help himself. The only thing he had sent was more bath oils, potions and salves in a one-off package that would last him a month.
Draco reached out just as Harry was taking his temperature and slipped his long pale fingers around Harry's wrist and in a sober voice he murmured, "I believe you can do it."
?' the voice sneered in the back of his mind. '
Theo nodded his head in agreement, "He was being more depressing than usual."
"I know," Draco stated kissing Harry's nose, "but I want to." Harry was left with a small blush kissing his cheeks as Draco sauntered off down the hallway, a new spring of hope in his step, as he made his way towards the bathroom.
"A likely story," Draco muttered to himself, before sighing. It was too cold to argue. It had been such a long, distressing day and his nerves were shot. He rubbed at his chest and drew in a couple of long breaths, "I can only handle a small number of things at a time. You know this. It would seem that father's death just pushed me out a little too far and I wasn't ready for all of it yet."
Harry stands at the center of the room, with his wand in one hand and an axe in the other, waiting for the sun to dip below the horizon. Draco has charmed the walls, made them impervious to Harry’s attempts to break them down. But he hasn’t thought of this. He’s with Pansy now, leaving Harry to his bloody walls.
“The curse was targeting Malfoy. You were hit since you were in such close proximity, but it's a much weaker variant. You can make it out, Harry. You can help Malfoy navigate out.” Ron says from his corner.
“What do you mean?” Draco’s smiling at him, eyes soft. It’s a daydream. Harry swallows down the grief of the realization.
Harry snaps back to the portrait. His parents have disintegrated out of the frame.
It wipes its face, smearing its bloody tears across its sallow cheeks.
. He strides forward, reaching to untie him, but his fingers, slick with blood, slip on the knots.
“What about you? Us?”
Draco’s written a note under her picture:
Harry inspects the board closely. 7 people dead over 2 months. Inconsistencies in their deaths, but clearly perpetrated by the same actor. A pale blue envelope mailed to each victim. It explodes within minutes of delivery, enveloping its target into a coma.
Draco flinches, then stills. It’s the worst thing he could have heard—that Harry thinks their time together was damnation.
,” louder, facing Ron. Ron doesn’t hear him. Because… because Ron’s not here. Ron and his stubborn, incongruous armchair aren’t here. Harry can hear the humming of Mungo’s Stasis charms echoing somewhere in his mind, the quiet bustle of the hallway, the frantic whispering.
Draco lifts his head off Harry’s shoulder, dazed and content. Juice drips down his wrist and he licks away a stray drop. “What is?”
“What… what is that?” In the days—
Ron is Harry’s best friend in the whole world but sometimes he can be a bit daft.
Harry sees it now. He stands slowly. “Who is that?” He asks softly, peering intently into the forest to get a better look.
. You were a gift. You saved me, Draco. Now let me do the same.”
“They won’t try Obliviation with Malfoy. Healers think it’s too late, that he’s too weak even to break out of the simplest version.”
Harry nods, still staring at the clone.
“No, this isn’t love,” Draco lies, loud and desperate.
“Without memories, the curse will implode into the simplest version of itself: a basic mind trap. Straightforward, simple. The kind that Aurors learn in training.”
“Rid your mind of all emotion,” Snape continues. “Empty it, make it blank and calm.”
“Hermione had a near conniption,” he chuckles. “But it’s the logical solution. The curse absorbs everything you show it and gives it back to you, better and smarter. If there’s no data for it to learn from, then you’re free.”
“It’s over, it’s all over,” she informs, as if Voldemort’s death is a cure for her son’s own.
“What is this?”
With every generation, it grows stronger. A poison, a perversion of their most human instinct. Their love, twisted to drastic lengths. It strangles their hearts and pollutes their minds until it runs wicked, mean and obsessive and undying.
“Potter, are you drunk?”
, it says gleefully,
“I live in paradise!”
The voice just wails again. Its fingertips poke out from the cracks, begging for release.
Harry stumbles back, stunned and speechless.
“Draco, what is that?”
“What is this?”
Narcissa stills. She sees Andromeda, lying a few paces away, her splintered bones shrouded by her dark golden hair.
The curse builds like bile in his throat, clutching at his breath until,
“JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO, RON,” Harry bellows.
,” it rasps, its tongue sharp over old syllables. It hasn’t spoken in years, having stopped nine-and-a-half years ago, when it finally tired of screaming for help.
, Lucius had murmured, several years ago. In Draco’s memory, they walk through the Manor’s gardens, Lucius’ hand overwhelming Draco’s little fingers. The trees swallow his words, so he repeats, louder and clearer:
, he thinks viciously.
Draco turns back confusedly. “It’s Easter, not Halloween.”
. “Draco, what have you done?”
“What are you talking about?” Draco shouts, cowering from the flashes of light striking down at him. “I’m happy!”
“It’s poisoned.”
The blood runs darker and faster the next night, pooling up to Harry’s ankles.
Harry whips around, but it’s too late. The creature lunges forward, clutches Harry’s arm, and pulls him toward the wall. It screeches savagely, “

Everything is still. The walls bleed.
Draco meets an old friend, ten years later.
Draco stills.
“You’re my son,” she replies softly.
Draco stills. He clasps his hands on his lap and stares at where Harry was picking off paint chips.
. Harry is a gift from the sky in the form of a friend. Draco had been so grateful that he hadn’t asked questions.
“The other two?” Draco croaks.
Deep bags under his eyes. His beard, wild and dark. A bloody handprint on his shirt.

, he steps forward. Harry sees him first, shakes his head, frantic. Then, the men turn, their smiles dripping away. They reach for their wands but Draco’s faster.
Draco grimaces. He doesn’t remember coming in, but he remembers leaving, running and running, frightened and free.

“In the beginning, there were three sisters, who loved each other very much. They were always together, playing in the rivers, chasing after the winds. One day, they heard a rumor whispered between tree leaves.
And everyone else, somewhere in between, caught in a barbaric war. When she was younger, she believed the story a figment of her mother’s imagination—her characters painted in her daughters’ likeness. She imagined herself the hero, the persistent one who claims magic as her own.
It wakes on the day Harry doesn’t return.
He remembers suddenly—Draco’s hand on his chest. A bloody outline the next morning. Draco’s fingers on his jaw. Red prints left behind.
Draco is fast asleep, blond hair peeking from under the covers. He wants to leave.
Narcissa walks unseeing toward the horizon. There is a glint of familiar white-blond lying where the sun touches the Earth. She kneels beside him and clutches him tight to her chest.
, Lucius whispers now, from his cell, eyes wild and breath sour.
Harry doesn’t remember falling asleep, but he startles awake the next morning. Draco is slumped over next to him. The blood is gone, but it’ll be back tonight. He rises gently, careful not to wake Draco, and seeks his reflection in the bathroom mirror.
A memory, then. Out of place, but relevant. Harry remembers Ron’s words: The curse doesn’t know which memories are relevant. It’s guessing, responding to Harry’s needs. It’s
“Potter, stand back,” Draco commands.
There’s a film of blood covering the floor. It laps against the bed posts, licks at Harry’s toes.
Draco looks down at his own empty basket, then at Harry’s, filled with colorful eggs and wrapped candies. “Oh,” he replies.
Harry clenches his jaw. He stares at the sky adamantly. “I’ll find you,” he replies.
Whispers swarm the Malfoy family. A curse, they say. The men, driven to insanity; the women, deranged.
, it whispers,
Harry gives Ron a conciliatory nod and reaches out to brush a dark curl away from Draco’s forehead. Draco has platinum hair, he remembers, as an afterthought.
Harry continues, softly. He sets Draco back down and cradles his face. “I was disobedient, unruly, and they needed me gone.” He steps closer, takes Draco’s hands in his. “But, this…

Draco blinks. “I know. Do you miss them?”
“Empty it,” Harry whispers. He takes a last look at Draco and closes his eyes.

“Draco, why are you here?”
Harry sighs and lies next to him until the sun comes up and the blood disappears. When he wakes, there are bloody fingerprints at the top of his neck.
Draco nods. He knows better now. The Malfoy line will end with him and their sick, twisted love will fade in a grave.
Harry stomps toward him, happy and sweet. There’s chocolate on his lower lip. “You okay?” He calls. His charmed bunny ears droop to the left. His sticky hand finds Draco’s waist, his lips Draco’s cheek. “You didn’t find any,” he points out.
“It’s a curse, Harry. 'Mione figured it out. It’s preying on your memories.”
It is Draco’s mirror image, underneath the grief and torment.
day 14 prompt: poisoned fruit.
“But… I’ve been good. I’ve been perfect.” He throws the apple to the ground and turns to Harry furiously. “What did you do?”
Draco sighs. He drops his nose into the crook of Harry’s neck. “Please, just sleep. It’ll be okay,” he murmurs. “I’ve got you, Harry.”
Harry grunts. The walls speak quietly, the faint susurration of blood rushing behind them.
“No, he’s not,” Harry replies serenely. He’s not. Draco is in the kitchen, wearing the light blue sweater Harry gave him last Christmas and a rosy flush Harry gave him two minutes ago.
“I love that picture of us,” Draco says happily, laying his head on Harry’s shoulder.
The walls are bleeding again.
“Sir?” He calls out. “I’m Auror Potter, come forward please.”
Except. Except, Draco doesn’t drink tea. He drinks cheap, Instant coffee, a consequence of his time spent working in America. Harry teases him about it all the time.
Harry laughs, breathlessly and wildly. “It’s there, Draco! It’s right there, behind the wall!”
“There’s a whole world out there, Draco. Where you can live.
The Burrow. Except, there are two Georges.
Draco’s weak now. His blood seeps through Narcissa’s clothes and sticks to her hands. His eyes flutter, struggling to stay open.
“Harry,” Draco whispers. He blinks rapidly but his mortal eyes won’t adjust to divine darkness. He collapses to his knees and begins to pray, verses slipping out from under his jaw. The ground is wet and it licks at Draco’s legs, then at his arms and forehead as he lies prostrate on the grass. The stench of copper slides down his throat and he hesitantly opens his eyes to brightness, hoping that it’s all over.
“It’s you, Harry. You’re teaching it how to trap you.”
how to learn, how to adapt. You can force it to consume everything around it until it knows right from wrong. Until it becomes as intelligent as any of us, but you can never teach it instinct. Look around, Harry, use your instinct.”

Harry strides forward, takes Draco’s shoulders in his hands. This is real now; Harry remembers this morning. “I’ll come for you, okay? We know what it is now, we’ll figure out how to stop it. Draco, you’ll be fine.”

“NO!” Harry’s kneeling, face hidden in his hands. “No, I can’t do this alone, I can’t, come back… please come back.” He knows it’s impossible;
But perhaps Draco is a fool too, swayed by Potter’s green eyes and juvenile flirting.
Harry shakes his head, silently, frantically. There’s a pale blue envelope on Draco’s desk.
It rejoices in its awakening, erupting from Draco, relentless and unmerciful. It rips them apart, limb by limb, until the men lie in pieces, strewn across the floor. Some are still alive, whimpering, begging for forgiveness, prostrate at Draco’s feet. Their arms have been torn away or their eyes burned out. Draco kicks them aside and wraps his fingers around their throats.
He whips around.
“Draco—” Harry gasps.
It looks as expected, an image Draco has seen every day, and yet, he’s repulsed. He inspects it closely.
Harry nods toward the half-eaten apple in Draco’s hand. It burns bright green between his pale fingers.
The curse settles, sinks into his veins, satisfied.
There’s movement again in the trees. A slight rustling in the long grass, accompanied by a shining white, like a mirror held up toward the clearing.
Draco’s falling now. His eyes are shut, he’s laying on the floor, head tilted toward Harry.
But when the Mark is carved into Draco’s arm, all he feels is his father’s hand around his own, and all he sees is his mother’s smile in the garden as she waves back.
Draco shakes him off. “Right,” he mumbles, “Loony Luna.”
Draco is scrambling forward, panicked. He palms his wand and repairs the wall in one quick spell. He pulls Harry back toward the bed, sharply. “Harry, please, stop,” he begs. “You’re okay, you’re alright.”
, Lucius would say, incessant.
She continues. “But the eldest sister was foolish and naive. She was entranced by the wonders of the world. She grew distracted from her goal; even more so, when she fell in love with a forest spirit. Only halfway around the world, she ran off with him, leaving her sisters behind. In all her passion for the world, she forgot magic. She became the first Muggle.”
The sun is plucked away from the sky
and places them gently in Draco’s basket. He sways lightly, knocking his shoulders into Draco’s.
Harry places a hand over Draco’s, whispers, “The walls are bleeding again. I’ll keep watch.”
Harry doesn’t move. He’s watching the sky intently. “Take another bite,” he whispers.
, Ron had said. AI doesn’t understand emotions, won’t bring him back now that it knows he doesn’t belong.

The room fills in further, encouraged. Case files pile up on Harry’s desk; Draco’s Statue of Liberty trinket is back, in the right place this time; an evidence board on the wall, newspaper clippings, Draco’s neat, white notes, Harry’s scrawl.
“The headmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency. I can only hope that you prove more adept at it than Potions,” Snape says, looking up at Harry with dark, hooded eyes.
Harry’s sobered up, cautious. He steps out in front of Draco, shielding him, one hand outstretched and another hand on his wand.
Harry sits at the edge of their bed, feet planted firmly on the floor and wand gripped tight.
“It’s okay,” Harry whispers. He knows Draco’s burden and they’ll never speak of this again. He grips Draco’s wand and frees himself. Then, clutches Draco close to his chest.
Harry collapses into the chair beside Ron, mind whirling. The room twists around them. They’re in the Gryffindor Common Room now, Ginny and Hermione near the fireplace, no more Walnut table and Cherry chairs. Except, Molly Weasley’s washing dishes in the corner.
He finds the source easily, the same spot he was working on last night, and starts to peel away the paint. It’s easier tonight, the blue is eager to crumble away. The walls swell as the creature surfaces. A familiar handprint, then two, a face, a body, outlined behind Harry’s walls.
Harry steps back.
“You can’t teach humanity,” Ron continues. “You can teach a

Harry steps back and brings the axe above his shoulder. He swings. The wall cracks.
Draco’s breath rattles. “Muggles, monsters, and magic, yeah?” He asks. “Which am I?”
“Hermione’s calling it an AI-Curse. Artificial Intelligence. It sweeps through your mind quickly and puts together a scenario where you feel comfortable. It’ll get things wrong, of course. It doesn’t know which memories are relevant, which are wrong, which are just daydreams. That’s where you come in. You tell It when it’s wrong and you reward It when it’s right.”
Their baby-blue paint has started to crack after nights of blood seeping through it. Harry picks at it slowly, until he can see the bright drywall underneath. A small window of white, shining through the blood.

Harry reaches out, holds his hand just out of reach, hoping to lure it out. “Who are you?” He whispers, leaning closer, closer.
. Bellatrix is here too, prostrated at her master’s feet, her throat slit in her own spectacle of loyalty.
for the
Seemingly random victims. A middle-aged mother, an elderly school teacher, a teenager days away from his 15th birthday. Muggles, Purebloods, Half-Bloods, and a Squib. Varying races, different financials.
Draco looks around wildly. Blood boils up from the ground, rich and incessant. It rushes between Draco’s flowers, consumes the apple thrown away, bubbles under Draco. He stands frantically and clutches at Harry. The wind screeches, tearing apart his home.
“The Malfoy you came here with never left.” Draco’s lip curls upward. “I did.”
—he’s been in the garden, Draco’s never even seen a cloud.
day 6 prompt: in the forbidden forest.
“The diverse victims— someone is teaching it how to learn, adapt to every condition,” Harry whispers. Draco’s standing near his desk again, illuminated by the soft light of his lamp. Soft blonde locks fall into his eyes as he looks over a case file. Harry wonders if this version will flinch away if he reaches out. Wonders if the curse has learned this detail yet. He hopes it hasn’t.
“HARRY!”
Harry creeps forward, frantic to see its face. The screaming stops.
Draco turns toward the wall and for a moment, Harry thinks he can see it. His brows furrow and his mouth pinches tight. Then, he shakes his head and looks back at Harry. He brings his hands to Harry’s jaw and peers into his eyes. “Harry, let’s just go, yeah? We’ll stay with Ron and Hermione for a week.”
“You’re anesthetized.”
“We’re not dating, we’re not anything, why are you in my flat?”
“Like your hair, Mum,” Draco whispers.
Dropping the pale legs unceremoniously, Harry leaned right over Draco so that his pale legs were pushed up against his chest. They were nose-to-nose as Harry dipped his head to capture his mouth in a hot, passionate kiss with chapped lips nipping and sucking at one another before his teeth drew Draco's bottom lip out and suckled once again. Their bodies were hot and salty with sweat, plastered together as Harry –after a few more deep thrusts –came hot and heavy inside his husband, his face contorted into that of both pleasure and pain as he collapsed on top of Draco at a somewhat awkward angle, just in time for the older man's cum to spurt out and hit his chin.
Draco sniffed and tried to stop tears from forming in his eyes once again, to no avail, as he curled up on his side under the bed and continued running his trembling fingers through the dog's glossy fur.
When Draco turned around to see him, he gave an awkward little smile, "Hey, sorry about this but ... Well, after what you said about seeing Christmas for the first time, I thought that -maybe -we could see another type of first Christmas together."
Mulling it over one morning, Theo had simply shrugged across from him, "Perhaps you didn't use a strong enough potion on him. You know how stubborn Draco can be. You probably needed a really strong one on him."
That was when he noticed that Harry's nose was bleeding rather profusely. He had merely frowned and sat Harry down on the toilet lid and carefully, expertly, blotted the running river until nothing was left to stream out. Once he was sure that Harry was able to breathe properly, he had knelt before him, toothbrush in hand, and gently brushed Harry's teeth, getting rid of as much of the vomit-flavor as possible.
'. "Shoot," she pouted, "I'm late for meeting Blaise. Here, can you give this to him?" she help out a small smoked glass phial to him.
"About us. I'll write about our life ... For Harry. He gave her a glance over his shoulder, "it's what Harry wanted me to do for him."
The silence that followed was heavy with tension but he soon exhaled deeply and ran a hand down his face, "There were too many memories for me to go back there. I wanted to stay here for once."
Draco peered into the bedroom just in time to see Harry growl in frustration, tossing the pyjamas off of the end of the bed, his face contorted with anger. "Harry?" Draco whispered, edging just inside the doorframe, not wanting his irritated lover to lash out at him.
Draco did as he was told. Pressed into the mattress he felt completely crushed. His dick was raw from the friction of the cotton sheets and between his legs was drenched with sweat and pre-cum. Harry tenderly reached over and eased the blonde onto his back, smoothing his tan hands down the muscular thighs. "God, you look gorgeous!" he gushed.
When Potter finally did emerge, it was in a loose grey shirt, baggy bottoms, dressing gown and a towel wrapped around something large and rounded in the crook of his arm. Was that the golden egg he'd gotten from the dragon? Why did he need to bathe the bloody thing?
Draco tore his eyes around the room, spinning around searching for Seeker. He soon found the blond tuft of Seeker's tail shaking from underneath the bed in their bedroom. Draco barely made it to the bedroom without tripping heavily over his slippery socks on the floorboards. "Seeker?" he breathed as he bent down on all fours and peered underneath the bed. The dog was used to witches and wizards popping in and out unannounced and yet this intrusion had rendered the poor animal to a quivering mass of gold fur. "Hey bud it's okay" Draco tried to soothe in a quavering voice as he flattened himself to stroke the fur under the bed. Seeker's large watery, almond eyes looked sad at Draco's words but licked at Draco's hand as the blond continued to stroke his fur and ears.
At this point even Draco had to admit that maybe those pick-up lines were working after all. He couldn't control his satisfied smirk as he watched Potter dash out of the classroom, when the bell went, as fast as he could. Draco had the same problem but he was able to wait until he got down to the privacy of his own bed before taking his dick out and jerking himself off.
The very next day they had gone out and purchased the collar and name-tag, labeling the hyper puppy as 'Seeker' for life.
Draco pressed a kiss to Harry's forehead, "I'll cook you up some nice hot chicken soup when we get you home, alright?"
Draco moaned and nipped along Harry's chest before rocking his hips, hooking his legs tighter around Harry's thighs for leverage. Strong hands gripped his buttocks. "Positive," he grunted, as he used Harry as an anchor to grind down against his lap. Draco felt his eyes roll back -it was all so intense! Harry was so deep and every time he twitched, he hit against that sweet spot.
"Harry," Draco insisted firmly his eyes bright and serious, "I am perfectly well. Just let me have this, okay? No one will know and it's not like you haven't woken up in my bed."
"Yes," he breathed out, his mouth working on its own accord. However, as soon as the word was out there, in the air, he found that he did not regret them. It felt so right. They had spent a great portion of their life together -why not take it that one extra step? Allowing the world to know that they were one another's alone, and no one elses?
Draco snorted and looked away, "To be perfectly honest, Severus, I would prefer it if we were arguing. As it stands we barely say two words to one another and it's infuriating me. He leaves first thing in the morning and gets home later and later every night. He only came home earlier than usual one night last month. And that wasn't until ten o'clock. Any later and he would have been on the last train home."
Those words continued to ring in Harry's ears later that night as he settled down to sleep for the final night in their own hotel. Starting the following morning he would take on a workload of intensive training and studying in order to prepare for his upcoming exams. He just didn't realise how big a part Draco and his letters would play in keeping his sanity as well as getting him out of the stifling hospital a few times a month.
Blaise suppressed the smirk he felt threatening to crawl onto his lips. He found it amusing that Draco still insisted on calling the four-eyed git 'Potter' around them, as though they would take offence to the fact that the boy actually had a first name. "Any idea what that news was?" he asked, keeping his voice as neutral as possible.
"Your potions-"
"It could ..."
"Pardon my intrusion, since you appear to be very deep in thought, but it seems to me that you've bored yourself into a catatonic state, unless I am very much mistaken?" purred a voice that trailed over Harry like silken ribbons wrapping around his muscles. He turned around on the spot in a whir of golden infused light and came face-to-face with a tall aristocratic looking blonde with chiselled alabaster features, steely grey eyes and petal pink lips drawn up into an amused smirk. Harry peered a little higher –the man was at least a head taller than he was –and saw that his slicked back hair was a fine shock of white-blonde hair that glistened like pale gold in the lamplight. The man extended his hand, clutching a flute of champagne in his free hand, and smirked a little wider, "My name is Draco Malfoy, son of Lucius Malfoy. May I enquire as to who you are?"
This caught Hermione off-guard, "Pack? What do you mean by 'pack'?"
Harry tugged the fabric of his hospital gown, "can you transfigure this into a pair of fleece pyjamas, please?" he whispered, his breath tickling Draco's ear.
"Draco?"
"Back to the station," Draco responded in an indifferent manner as he tilted his head to one side to watch the streets jitter past him. The roads in Paris were ever so bothersome; crammed with too many people too busy to remember the rules of driving a coach and not enough room to do it in. Not to mention a lot of the roads were uneven and awkward under the wheels, making Draco feel travel sick every time.
Hermione had told him an interesting little story along with teaching him to make the cranes; that if one made a thousand of said cranes then they would be grants one wish -for whatever they wanted.
Draco bit down on his bottom lip before reaching up and slowly exploring Harry's mouth with his own. Harry whimpered as he broke the kiss but Draco merely smiled softly and stroked the sweaty black hair out of his eyes, "Just promise me one thing, Potter."
But as soon as the coolness of the tiles touched the soles of his feet, and a veil of steam washed over his features, the scent of apples hanging in the air, he felt his self-loathing melt away to be replaced with the feeling of how unclean he had felt during the hospital. He grimaced. Wasn't hygiene meant to be one of the top priorities for patients? He winced at the cold toilet lid made contact through his snuggly pyjamas. Draco smiled and ran a hand down his cheek, the way he always did when Harry was feeling ill or vulnerable.
It was very late into the evening when he came to the last box, having sent an awful lot of the old papers into the fireplace to burn. They were useless now anyway. When he came to that last box he frowned as it merely seemed to be a hazardous jumble of letters tossed about inside, with no real order to them whatsoever; the only way to tell them in any sort of order was the date scribbled in the bottom right hand corner of every envelope. Realisation bubbled to the forefront of his mind as he recognised some of the untidy, chicken scratch writing that adorned the first few letters.
