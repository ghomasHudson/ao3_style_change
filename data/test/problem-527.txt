"No."
Hermione grinned, teeth white in the dark. Harry liked the look in her eyes.
In their searching, they'd been able to build up a rough timeline of when Voldemort had created each horcrux, although they were far from determining any locations, and so after learning this information, the three of them (mainly Hermione) managed to narrow down the time period of its creation to a time Voldemort was known to have been around Hogwarts.
"Sorry." She said as they reached her, voice cracking. "I'm being so stupid." Ron extended a hand to her before Harry got the chance. She took it gratefully, allowing herself to be gently pulled up and into a hug. Harry watched Ron lean down to whisper something in her ear, watched her face smooth of creases, a grateful smile grace her lips.
"They might not even find us, they might just assume we left?" As if in answer, a sudden banging sounded from beneath them. Harry stood up quickly, his heart suddenly in his throat. Muffled shouting sounded, and small pops, like someone was casting curses at thin air.
"Should we..." Harry's voice caught in his throat as bile once again rose up. Swallowing hard, he resisted the urge to vomit. "Should we check the bedrooms?"
"Sorry!" Ron replied sheepishly. "Did you find anything?"
And so, a careful plan and plenty of reconnaissance later, they'd made the portkey trip to the grounds. It was a cold day, snow threatening to fall. A select few members of the Order knew of the mission, Remus and Bill Weasley among them, and were waiting outside the grounds, on high alert. They couldn't risk bringing more people into the castle for fear of rousing attention through numbers. If any Death Eaters had set any proximity alarms or sensor spells, it would be much easier for the three of them to quickly escape than a whole squad.
Not that he'd ever thought there'd be something to find in this sad, empty shell.
"And how the hell do we get out of here?" Ron agonized, pacing up and down the neatly made beds. Harry stood in place, bouncing up and down on his heels. Hermione faced the door for a second, taking a deep breath, before turning to face them, a steely look of determination on her face.
"Oh, my god."
"Here!" Hermione was stood, a slender black clad figure silhouetted against an open doorway. She disappeared inside.
Death Eater? Unlikely. Looting was strangely not a part of their modus operandi. The roving gangs of dark wizards held with almost Viking-esque behaviour; murder and rape, burn and devastate - but not pillage. They probably thought themselves above the possessions of a half blood family.
"Harry?" Her voice was far away, quiet and echoing, but distance couldn't disguise the worry in her tone. If he glanced to one side, he could see the tiny body, hundreds of metres beneath him, slowly taking the steps one by one. "Harry?"
Harry gestured sharply at Ron to follow her, and with a filthy look and curse, he did. Hesitating for a second longer, Harry watched as the steady light flickered, long hooded shadows about to turn the corner. Leaping and running, he sprinted into the Slytherin dormitories. "What about the others?" Harry said, barely over a whisper.
"They have."
Thankfully, yet surprisingly, it didn't. Eight beds, still made and untouched, and a long cold fireplace were all that greeted him. No ghosts, no bodies. Harry retreated and made his way onwards.
Harry nodded eventually, eyes on his feet and the worn out limestone stairs. He blinked up at Ron after a moment of silence. Ron had grown taller and broader in last few years. He was now physically the adult man that he'd been forced to become over the years. Harry supposed he was too. There was a certain acknowledgement he'd allowed himself; in the feel of his bony hands, the breadth of his shoulders, the stretch and bend of his legs. The three of them had spent much of the previous year in South America, chasing what turned out to be a futile lead on a horcrux, and they all still bore the deep tans and scars the weather and battles had forced upon them.
"Right. Just. Just wanted to double check." Harry blew an exhale, leaning back on his hands. He didn't question her plan, he rarely did. He watched Ron build himself up to, though, the taller man's dark eyes flicking between the wall and the girl, lips peeled back from his teeth in a frustrated snarl.
Harry hung back slightly, out of earshot of the reassuring whispers Ron was muttering into her hair. He turned to one side awkwardly, stepping towards the grey of the corridor. He could easily tell it was the way out, a breeze pulling cold air towards them like osmosis. From ice to damp, ice to damp. He paused.
"That's not how the enchantment works. It's not... stuck to the ghost's soul with glue, it cant be just removed. It becomes one with the ghost. It merges, becomes one." She looked into Harry's eyes, her own big brown eyes wet. "The only way to destroy the horcrux is to destroy the soul of the ghost. Voldemort didn't just hide this fragment, he gave it the ultimate protection from destruction; a thinking, reasoning being that can..." She laughed without any humour, "That can walk through walls and vanish without trace."
He turned as he reached the entrance, glancing back over his shoulder to his friend. Ron hadn't hesitated and was disappearing into the dark. With a breath, Harry did the same.
"Is there any point?"
"The same way we got in."
"No idea, didn't see. More than two." The shadows had betrayed that much.
Harry thanked them with a smile and nod, but secretly would rather have died himself than bring the danger of his presence to their doorstep. And so, Grimmauld place became home. An old, gross, smelly and cursed home, but more of a home than Privet Drive ever had been.
Ron, unfortunately, gained a rather prominent scar running from his chin up to his temple, thanks to a nasty little pitched battle against a group of Death Eaters that had caught up with them in Peru. They'd won, mainly thanks to a series of preemptive curses Hermione had rigged the area with, but Ron would carry the evidence with him forever; a thin streak of silver-white against the freckle-brown of his face.
"Only good thing that came from this place closing, that." Ron joked darkly. "No more bloody potions."
Harry couldn't take his eyes from the scene.
"Well I sure hope nobody followed us this time, because if they did then I'm pretty sure they heard that giant explosion." Ron snapped. Hermione ignored him.
Harry shrugged.
The house still played base to the Order of the Phoenix, and a day rarely went by without a heavy booted wizard or witch stomping through the house, shouting for help or planning a meeting or simply looking for a place to rest before venturing back out into battle.
"Let's blow a fucking hole in the wall."
The same hollow, empty picture frames graced all of the walls, and up near the high ceiling, thin windows showed a night sky through dirty glass.
Ron broke his horrified gaze to look back at Harry. His face looked thin, thinner and older than it had before they'd set foot in this tomb.
"I'm here Hermione." He answered. He watched her head snap up to follow his voice.
Harry had questioned the usefulness of this, surely any living (technically) being could be reasoned with, and would Voldemort risk the ghost being found out and persuaded to take part in the destruction of the parasitic soul attached to it? Hermione had answered with a sigh and shrug.
"...Get away from the edge!" She sounded oddly shrill in the echo, he watched her hand fly up to clutch the front of her jumper. Harry smiled, affection blossoming in his chest. Hermione's mothering was stupidly comforting, a token that had only developed more as they found themselves in more and more dangerous situations year upon year upon year.
"Here." An unexpected voice behind Harry startled him, and as he whipped around, he lost his balance on the precipice. Fortunately, Ron's quick lunge was enough to yank Harry back before the Boy Who Lived became the Pancake Who Died. Heart thudding, he used both his friend and the banister to pull himself up.
They checked other rooms as they passed, but found only more of the same; dark, damp rooms, devoid of all life besides the green mould reclaiming each surface.
They all dressed in dark colours. This wasn't by any way a means of camouflage, but the cruel times they were in didn't feel for bright, happy colours. Everywhere you looked in the world, you'd see the same at this point. Wizards once priding themselves in the swish of their long, maroon cloaks now favoured shorter, darker, more... well in Harry's opinion, more muggle fashions. Trousers, coats and boots. A world at war, and each person a soldier whether they chose it or not.
It was unpleasant to find that time and desolation had not robbed the corridors beneath the castle of any of its slime. If anything, the floors were more treacherous and the walls greener. Harry considered casting a sticking charm to make the soles of his boots tacky, fingering his wand and pushing away a hair from his glasses with a numb-feeling hand.
"Yeah." She agreed. "Yeah, I know."
Dust filled the air and small bits of mortar flew towards the three of them, Harry and Ron shrinking back and shielding their eyes.
Taking a steadying breath, feeling his heart punching against his ribs, Harry shook his head.
"Shit!" Harry hissed, spinning back to his friends, eyes wide. "Get back!"
"Are you suggesting-" Hermione span herself to face Ron, cutting him off with a hard hand to the chest, a determined set to her jaw.
"How are we going to get in?" Hermione whispered, eyes wide and pupils black in the dim. Harry shrugged. It felt wrong to speak loud in the suffocating quiet, each shiver and movement echoing and booming. Ron stepped forward, thin hand reaching forward to push on the rough surface of the painting. When nothing happened, he hooked his fingers beneath the rim and tried pulling, a scowl dusting across his forehead. Failing to move it, he shrugged apologetically and stepped back, folding his arms tightly, hands clenched.
Investigations were initiated into the disappearances. But what became apparent to anybody who cared was the simple fact of what linked the victims. Their blood heritage.
"How could anybody live down here?" Ron asked, revolted. Harry watched as he swiped a finger along the wall, turning it and pulling a face at the revealed algae. "Fucking gross."
"Hermione wanted to check the dungeons together." Ron exhaled, flexing his hands and attempting to crack his neck from side to side. Harry watched him frown and jerk harder, searching for relief, before they turned to walk back down the staircase together.
It wasnt until the summer following the school closure that war was officially declared. By then, Harry had already moved into Grimmauld Place, no longer assured of the safety of his blood relatives without Dumbledore there to guarantee it.
"I thought you said the anti-muggle charms were still holding?" Ron frowned, lightly tugging on her sleeve as if to reassure himself she was there. Hermione fell into step with the pair of them, tugging her coat back down from where it'd rucked up.
"Fine." He said shortly. "Leave Hermione outside, I'll check the girls. You do the boys'." Harry nodded, pushing back off the wall and walking slowly to the dark staircase at the other side of the room, trying to keep his eyes on the wall and off of the rotting bodies around his feet.
"Hermione," He started. She turned to face him, hands on her hips. "Herm, love, we're underwater." Hermione blinked slowly at the endearment, at Harry's soft tone. She frowned, her brow barely wrinkling, and tucked a stray curl behind her ear.
"Shit..." He heard Ron gasp behind him. Hermione gaped audibly, breath catching in her lungs, forcing out a half-sob. Stumbling to a corner, leaning a hand against the algae encrusted wall to support himself, Harry threw up.
"If we don't check, why did we bother coming?" Harry breathed, narrowed eyes looking across at Ron's impassive face. Ron swore, glancing to one side and running a hand across his stubble as he was want to do when frustrated.
"Where?" Harry's head swung back to the common room, running escape options through his head, a dozen a minute. It was the only exit, the corridor an abrupt and cold, dark dead end a few feet behind them.
They left the bloody room without saying another word. What word could be said? Hermione was a little down the corridor, sat with her knees drawn up to her chin and her wand clutched tightly in one hand. She looked up at them as they walked towards her. Her face was pale beneath her tan, eyes red.
The three of them turned to watch the door, eyes wide and hearts in mouths.
They reached the stairway leading to the castle dungeons, Harry pushing slightly ahead to take a deep breath of the dank air. How many times had they dejectedly trodden this very path en route to a Potions class? Harry looked down into the dark. Hogwarts truly had lost its charm. A draught whistled slightly, a shiver chasing down his spine.
Harry let them snip. He'd long since learned his lesson about trying to mediate the two of them. If anything, his interference simply earned him the brunt of both of their ire. Instead, he slipped around Hermione, stood running carefully steady hands down her coat, and awkwardly made his way over the shattered bricks and wood, tiptoeing across patches of clear floor. Once inside, he cast a Lumos charm and threw it high with a flourish, illuminating the whole room in a sickly pale, yellow glow.
"Harry, Ron!" Hermione had shut the door gently behind the pair of them and cast a wordless locking charm on it, leaving a oil-slick like sheen on the surface of the wood briefly.
"I think someone must have been into the rooms on these lower floors." She greeted them, hopping lightly to her feet. "They look ransacked."
It was at the top of one of these that Harry Potter stood. The toes of his boots peeked millimetres out over the precipice. He was around the tenth story of the building, eleventh maybe. He'd lost count as he climbed. His hand brushed the cold stone of the bannister next to him. A touch was enough to drown out the vertigo that was threatening to bring tears to his eyes. He lowered himself slowly down, sitting on the edge of the top step and dangling his legs into the void.
There was the crux of the matter. The reason why they'd returned to this empty, abandoned, cursed place. The search for horcruxes had led them, in a small town in Peru, to a clue.
"Jesus Christ, Ron."
Huh. That was strange. From ahead, the direction they'd come in, a soft yellow light illuminated the corner. That didn't make sense, they were many hundreds of metres and lots of turns away from the entrance, plus.... plus the sun had set...
"Well?" Ron mumbled, gently pushing past Harry and taking a step forward. He glanced back over his shoulder, tossing his head slightly to get his hair from his eyes. He grinned, winking at Hermione. "Let's break into Slytherin common rooms." Hermione snorted and the spell the dark had over them was broken. Harry watched her, rolling her eyes and pushing Ron's arm, her hand hovering a little too long to feel the warmth. He swallowed, throat dry. They descended into the shadow.
"What do we do then?" Hermione breathed, eyes large and dark as she looked to Harry for answers.
"Snape's room." Hermione whispered as a black door loomed on their left. Like the classrooms on the floors above, the door was cracked open and as they walked, they could see overturned tables and potion spills, still slick and shiny on the floor.
"If you can think of another way out, please. By all means." Hermione tugged on the very tips of Harry's hair, pulling a tingle from his scalp. She addressed Ron over his head, and Harry felt him shrug more than heard him.
In South America he, and later Harry, had learned that it was possible to bind a fragment to another soul. Not just any soul, no, to the soul of one whose body was no longer a part of the earth. Through an elegant enchantment, the young Dark Lord had woven the fate of one of his horcruxes to the fate of a ghost.
"That we blow a fucking hole in the wall, uhuh." If they weren't in such a dangerous situation, if they weren't standing a few minutes away from the murdered bodies of fifty house elves, Harry might have laughed. As it was, he drew himself forward, running his hands over his face, hard, feeling the roll of his cold wand across his forehead. He rested his elbows on his knees, head lolling to the floor. He was so tired. A warm hand on his neck didn't shock him, no more than anything could. A small, grateful sound escaped his lips as she ran her hand through his dust filthy hair.
Coming back here was like reopening a wound that had just begun to heal. It had been four years since Dumbledore had fallen from the tower, four years since Hogwarts had closed its doors to students for the final time. Four years since a lot of children found themselves becoming adults rather quickly.
It took Harry a moment before he realised what she meant. He beat Ron to the punch though, a glance at his confused, sweat and dirt smeared face revealed that much. Harry took a breath and sat down on the nearest bed.
The empty halls belied no mystery, no air of brilliance nor any hidden secrets. Not anymore. Empty picture frames hung like question marks, doors half opened onto empty classrooms and candles long burned out sat like misshapen, dripping monoliths. Moving staircases stood frozen, most connected up but some jutting out and ending in nothing but a hundred feet of dust and darkness.
"Probably all of them." Harry answered. "Massacre."
"There's no way out of the dormitories!" Ron spat after Hermione, who was already ten steps ahead of the pair of them and scrambling through the rubble.
"It wasn't this bad when Filch was still here." Hermione commented, pulling her wand out for light as they walked deeper, stepping ahead of the pair. Harry felt the lump in his throat grow as they walked, Hermione's shorter steps ringing faster in the hollow air. Soon, the faint glow from behind them faded to nothing and her Lumos was the only thing between the three of them and the growing black.
"Stand back." Hermione inhaled on a mutter, pulling on Harry's sleeve. Harry remembered when she was taller than both him and Ron, a bossy head held high and proud. Now, her head was still proud and high, but reached no higher than his shoulder. She'd pulled her hair tightly up into a bun on top of her head, dark hair slicked into place with some gel. Years of running and fighting had taught them all the best ways of dressing to avoid accidents, and Hermione's hair had enough times been the victim of Death Eater hands grabbing and yanking that she now kept it tightly away whenever they were out. Harry knew, had been told in choked whispers enough times that she regularly considered cutting it all off, shaving it down to a dark fuzz, but she hadn't so far, still holding onto her length, maybe like some sort of safety blanket. Harry didn't know. She'd be beautiful with it shorn as she was with it long, and he'd be a shield between her and any dark he could, for as long as he could.
"Ron?" Harry looked to the other man, who had stilled and was staring at Hermione, head cocked.
"Come on!" Ron hissed at him from the foot of the girls' staircase, Hermione already halfway up. Swerving around, Harry made the distance in seconds, barely a step behind Ron as they ascended.
"There's dozens of them." Ron said hoarsely.
He blinked. And again, trying to clear the dust volitantes from his eyes, trying to make sense of what the room was showing him.
"Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay." He wasn't. Was anyone? His head hurt, and his lungs felt a little like fire, brick dust still working its way up and out.
"How many of them?" Ron breathed as he and Harry shot up, eyebrows knotted between his eyes. Harry shook his head, grabbing his friend's shoulder to push him ahead.
Eventually they reached the Slytherin portrait. Like every other painting, the subject had long since moved on, leaving behind an empty glade, streaked left to right with grey oils of dying sunlight.
Hermione followed shortly after, having sent her parents somewhere warm and as safe as she could hope. The Weasleys remained in the Burrow, having extended Harry an open invitation to their hearth.
"He seems different to before. Kinder."
Harry nods. His mind drifts to the family he left behind - Ron and Hermione, the Weasleys, even Andromeda. They only speak for a few minutes every time Teddy floos over.
Harry nodded, looking around the space.
“Draco, this is the first time since Lily was born that we’ve had a night to ourselves. And that was two fucking years ago. Maybe you could look a little more… emotional?”
"What day is it?" Draco asked, feeling his stomach drop.
"Its the day. I'm here to take the wards down and end your house arrest. Did you say this jam is cherry?"
Teddy scowled, somehow managing to perfect the one Draco often gives off, shaking his head.
Draco didn't wait to hear what Potter responded with - didn't even pause to see the look on his face. He simply whirled on his heel and ran all the way to his room, slamming doors and sobbing as he went.
“Hi,” she said, pushing past him to get inside. “Thanks for opening the door. I thought you might be low on food, so I brought some stuff over. Also got some old baby stuff that Rose and Hugo don’t use anymore, I thought it may be useful.”
"Harry's promised me a picnic," Draco beams. "Mother used to make picnics when I was a child. The peacocks always stole my sandwiches."
He was dressed in his best robes - dark grey, shining in the right light - paired with charcoal trousers and a perfectly tailored waistcoat.
Draco had made a grave mistake while he stayed with his parents in France after the war - he'd submitted to an Alpha who was already engaged to his own Omega, who quickly cast Draco away when he fell pregnant.
"She's got plans," Harry offered, brows furrowing as a group of four-year-olds darted up the stairs towards the office. "Where are you lot going?"
"It is."
He made a mental note to come back to this store very soon, grabbed a pair of leather trousers, and hustled in what he hoped was the general direction of the tills, hoping he wouldn't be distracted by any more of the shop's unusual items.
Draco watched as the tiles filed back, opening a tiny arch into a new room. He followed Potter in, marvelling at the space.
Aurors. What did they want this time?
Potter finally steered him into an empty corridor, then into a small alcove. He tapped his wand against one of the tiles in the wall, whispering a password.
"Yeah," Potter admits, scratching the back of his neck. "I organized it after Hermione pointed out your behaviour. They said you didn't have the Dark Mark, and she figured out the only other option. I figured you might have trouble getting hold of any potions on your own."
He wasn't as pointy as he'd once been, now tall and elegant, hair down to his shoulders. He'd tied the top half up in a bun, the other half floating down to his collar.
"She's doing quite well. Sold the manor after father went to Azkaban, moved to the south of France. We write, but it's been a long time since I've seen her."
"You're asking me if I always want to shag you, or only for one week a month. Merlin, let me think." But that seemed to be enough, with Harry sweeping forwards to pin Draco against the worktop.
"Except for every weather report for the last two weeks, telling you a storm was blowing in this week."
"What are you eating?" Draco asked, eyeing up the pan.
"No thank you. I won't be staying long." He turned to Draco, a strange look in his eye, before getting down to business. "As you're aware, the two of you have been under house arrest for almost two years. You'll be released in 32 days, as agreed when the sentence was first put in place."
Draco's mind blanks out, coming back from his wolf as he straddles Potter's waist on the carpet. He doesn't know how they ended up there, but Draco's hands are on Potter's chest, twisting his nipples through his shirt. Draco doesn't want to move.
"Its main clientele are people who would rather not be seen in less discreet establishments. Lots of politicians and low-level celebrities. Or anyone with a preference for privacy."
"Don't panic. If Harry here can stop that godson of his getting all his food stuck on the ceiling, we can make sure there are no major incidents while your kid has lunch. Now," Jenna said, inspecting her newly-blue nails, "when would you want her to start?"
As he was unmated, his heats lasted a full week. He then took a few days off to spend with Scorpius, since the boy spent the week with either Harry and Teddy or Luna. Even Neville volunteered to look after him if either of them were ever unavailable.
Harry glanced down quickly, realising he was wearing the cashmere jumper Draco had left a few weeks ago, before looking back up at him.
"Well done. How many balls is Maria juggling?"
After the war, when all the trials had finished and Harry didn't have to attend any more official ceremonies, he disappeared. Left a letter on Kingsley's desk, informing him he was officially leaving the magical world and vanished.
“You can’t hog the whole bottle,” Ron retorts, snatching the bottle and chugging it like she did. This goes on a few more times, with other couples mimicking their competition, until everyone is delightfully drunk.
“Hold on,” Ron says, his mouth working as if trying to figure out how to begin. “Harry told you this? And you never told me?”
“Well, it’s not easy visiting every country in the world before Christmas break,” Ginny jokes, taking a seat in the chair beside Hermione, who takes Rose from Ron gently and with her hands and a murmur creates a soft, glowing ball of light that floats from her palm. Rose calms down immediately, staring in awe at the ball of light.
“Still,” Ron says so earnestly that even Hermione raises a brow, to which he blushes, though continuing anyway. “Still, we don’t know why they ended things in Sixth Year, and how Ginny was involved. And now, do you think they reignited their flame, so to speak?”
“Yes,” Harry says slowly, without looking at Draco, “I did say that.”
“It would be easier, though, I think, to have been both in Slytherin, or different people entirely,” Draco says thoughtfully, settling back against Harry’s chest. He curls an arm around Harry’s waist, and even just that simple touch sets Harry's heart aflame.
Hermione looks slightly flustered, but doesn’t back down. “Yes. I’d like to surprise my husband. I’ve been so busy at work, and he’s been so wonderful with the baby at home, and I thought…”
“Well let’s see,” Pansy says sarcastically, examining her sharp black nails that glow in the firelight. “The boy who broke your heart is asking you to brew an illegal potion
Harry takes another long sip of his wine. Draco watches him, then looks away, a flush rising on his neck, which startles Harry even more. Suddenly the room grows hotter, and Harry looks everywhere except at Draco.
“I only meant—” But then Draco sees the twitch at the corner of Harry’s mouth, the slightest movement, but it’s enough to make Draco blush. “Well, you know what I meant. Don’t play the innocent, Potter, it was never for you.”
No response. Then Harry kissed him.
Inside is the same as Harry remembers it. Leather couches and velvet cushions bask in a greenish light from the lake which laps against the windows. Dark, glossy floors reflect the low ceiling, producing the effect of walking inside a layer of some posh lord, which technically, is not very far from the truth.
His head pokes out, then sees it’s Ginny, and sits up fully. He’s shirtless, his hair crumpled and unwashed, with a few days stubble on his chin. “Ginny?”
“Good night, Weasley.”
“Did not a single Professor accept you?” Miss Weasley asks, mocking. “I am so sorry, Ron, that is quite pitiful.”
It was like the world needed to stop turning for a moment, so that they could experience a small window of peace, between war and healing. They all just needed to take a deep breath, to forget the harsh words and bitter spells cast, to pretend that they had always liked each other from the start.
“I guessed as much a month ago,” Hermione says. “I knew without a doubt at the Christmas party. Ron figured it out then on his own.”
“Yes, I’m surprised nobody else caught on.”
But if Draco is beautiful, Harry is decidedly indecent.
“Hey,” she says, bumping into him. He looks up at her, surprised.
“So imperative that you waited sixteen years to tell me?”
“Well, I’ve always been a liar, haven’t I?” Draco asks softly. Harry flinches, and for a moment Draco almost pities him. Almost.
* * *
One day they hated each other to the point of dueling, and the next that hatred seemed to boil over into something else, something no less intense, but no longer hostile.
The problem of his “out of tune,” uncontrollable magic only becomes exacerbated when four very familiar letters, enveloped and stamped with Hogwarts’ bright red seal, arrive at the Weasley’s modest country estate in late July.
“Why did—”
A much needed reprieve, if you ask Draco.
Harry watches Draco pace nervously in the shadows beside the large, oak wood doors of the Great Hall. Draco sifts his fingers through his blond locks, and Harry wonders not for the first time how they would feel. Soft, wispy, like finely spun thread? Or silky, velvety, smooth strands that he could grip in his hand?
Suddenly Malfoy looks up and they lock eyes. Harry forces himself to look away, focusing on the Headmistress’s speech.
He opens the book to where he had left a small piece of parchment marking where he left off, scanning the page not for the words already printed inside, but the scrawled handwriting crammed in the margins. The black ink is almost seductive in its hidden knowledge.
This interaction lets Hermione’s hopes down a little. She had not considered that if Malfoy
“And if he has nothing on, it gets even better.”
“I don’t know if I could go back after what happened.” Harry pauses. “After what I let happen.” Draco flinches ever so slightly.
“...to me….help you. I swore … your mother… protect you...the Unbreakable Vow, Draco—”
He feels torn in two directions, and only one holds his heart in a vice-like grip. Why is it that all the choices in his life feel like picking the lesser of two evils? After all, no matter how painful it is to love Harry in secret, it has always been much worse not loving him at all.
* * *
“Eighth Years, thank you for returning to Hogwarts after so recent a tragedy. I know how difficult this must be, when we have all lost someone dear to us within these walls. When I look amongst you, I cannot help but see where others should be, who are now lost to us.”
Ancient Runes with Professor Babbling
Hermione sighs, though not without a certain fondness that always accompanies any criticism of Harry. He’s just being Harry, after all.
Suddenly he’s lurched towards Malfoy by their joined wrists, and nearly collides with his chest, stepping back just in time.
Harry turned to Draco, amused, only to find him bashfully looking away, scuffing his fancy leather shoes in the snow.
Percy pulled out the paper and presented it as evidence, pointing to a part in the scribbled text that said just that. Draco could see Lucius’ grin grow into a large smile and he looked over to Draco and gave a smug smirk. Fairburn straightened his back and looked hopeful. Draco tensed his eyebrows in confusion and ignored them, focusing instead on the carefully crafted case Percy had put together.
Hogsmeade was unusually peaceful when he made it through the gates, small huddles of Hogwarts students were splattered around but the large Christmas crowds were long gone. Harry walked without trouble through the streets.
“Get a room!”
Just as Hermione had said, the Eighth Years were gathering in the common room, some with skates in hand. The Slytherins sat awkwardly in the corner, looking confused at the gathering. Of course, they hadn’t been invited. They were such a small group, only three of them. Blaise Zabini had made valiant efforts to separate himself from the other two but had eventually given into his fate. The green of their house would forever be untrustworthy without the efforts of the collective.
“Harry! Are you going to the library?” Hermione came around the corner, with a large pile of books under one arm, he nodded, “I was just going there myself to drop these off.”
“Yeah, that makes sense. What about, um, the letters. Everything alright with- there?”
Molly came around the corner with a tray loaded with roasted vegetables, distracting Arthur from pressing further into Harry’s hidden love life. Ron looked at him and raised an invisible ginger eyebrow but shrugged.
The pigeon noticed him and flew off the door, landed on his head and dropped the letter. Harry caught it and tried to look up at the bird but it was already in the air again, it had used his head as a take-off point. Harry was about to walk back inside to the ‘letter room’ to plop this one with the rest when he caught sight of the handwriting on the envelope, it was Luna’s. Wavy with a hint of elegance, the letter was addressed to:
), “back to the library. As I did help you get that grade after all.”
Lucius smiled manically as his attorney made his way to the jury box.
Harry smiled at the beaming sunlight as he walked the path to Hogsmeade. It had melted the snow away, leaving fragrant flower blossoms to take its place. Feeling sentimental, Harry admired the fresh colours as he went, wondering to himself if stopping to sniff them might be a little bit on the ridiculous side of things. He nodded with a bright smile in greeting to every person he passed, who looked shocked for a moment but nodded happily back. Sue him, he was in a good mood.
Snowflakes danced in the air, heavier now, falling gracefully on Draco Malfoy’s neatly styled hair. He had an apprehensive look on his aristocratic, pointy face. He closed his eyes for a moment and then reopened them, smiled and glided his way over to Luna. Every eye in the place followed him closely. He acted like he hadn’t even noticed the defensive quiet or the scrutinising stares, just kept on walking until he was towering over Luna. She was beaming up at him like she’d found out he’d hung the stars in the sky.
Wilkis Fairburn pulled the paper from him and fanned it out further. A large microscope teetered down from the invisible ceiling to hover over the illegible script. The jury leaned in, so did the judge, equally as interested. Fairburn pointed to a line even tinier than the ones above it.
“Godric…” Harry unwrapped the box and pulled it open. It was filled with soft, paper stuffing in the middle of which was a pair of simple ice skates. “Draco, they’re amazing, but I don’t know how to skate.”
Harry smiled, “Yeah? Sounds good. Can’t promise I’ll be at your level, though.”
“I’m so sorry, Draco.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Whatever it is, it’s a bloody good excuse to drink alcohol and eat way too many sweets, so I’m down.”
“Harry! This shirt is Egyptian cotton! If it stains, I swear-”
Thank you for reading this particularly long chapter!
“Yeah mate, it’s a ‘Biscuit Party’ or something,” Ron piped in, laughing, “how she comes up with this stuff, I’ve always wondered!”
The word ‘boyfriend’ felt good to say and Harry smiled as he spoke, turning his head to look up at Draco’s pointy nose, waiting for him to make some sort of comment on it.
“How cute!” She pouted at the blond, “but Draco, I’ve just realised, you haven’t even introduced your bestest friends to your boyfriend yet!”
“Hello, Harry.”
“You look ridiculous!”
“Are you?”
Seamus clapped Harry on the back from behind.
Fairburn shot up like a rocket that had been waiting to go off, “Objection! That is incorrect!”
There it is then, the first time they’ve ever acknowledged all those nights over the last month.
“A lot of people are sorry, actually.”
“The hyena tree, or the Alihotsy tree, is a plant whose leaves can produce bouts of uncontrollable laughter.” Draco panted each word out, trying to breathe through small giggles. Harry looked over to him and watched him wipe a tear away. His stomach flipped over. A real snowflake drifted onto his face, cold and wet. It cooled him down pleasantly and he started to regain some of his senses.
“I think I might actually be able to help you with this one.”
“He’s eleven. Here, I got you an early Christmas present.”
“Uh, no, I’m good. Hey, actually, I was wondering if you could,” he thought for a moment, “clean the very top floor for me? The whole floor. Right now.” He added.
Harry reluctantly pulled away and turned his head to face Dean.
“I’ll take them, ‘Mione. I’m going there anyway.”
Eventually, Pansy grew cold, as she always did at some point and she yelled at him across the ice to ‘get his bottom back to the lakeside’. She was shivering when he finally slid to a halt in front of them. Seamus was still there.
Draco pulled Harry closer to kiss him. He was bundled up in his winter coat again and held Harry against his body like he was trying to steal his body warmth.
Seamus balled up a particularly large chunk of snow and launched it, with both hands.
“You stay away from my shop and my customers, you hear!? Or there will be hell to pay!” Without another word, he whirled around and stomped back into the shop.
Harry laughed out loud when he spotted Draco come around the corner.
Draco jerked his body away from Harry’s.
Harry thought of McGonagall’s lectures about House Unity.
Harry Potter, as great as the stories about him boasted he was, felt he was a terrible coward. He had, without warning, holed himself up in Grimmauld place with only Kreacher and the angry portrait of Walburga Black to keep him company. Walburga’s cries of dismay were better than the mounting pressure of being the Boy Who Lived Twice, Harry reasoned to himself. He pulled his lethargic form out of a dusty old chair with a great deal of effort. A loud groan echoed around the library but he couldn’t tell if it had come from him or the house settling. Harry made his way along the dusty bookshelves, what seemed like hundreds of them in an endless, winding maze. He read the spines of books as he went, searching for something new to read. Harry never used to be that type, but he had picked up a few boring history volumes from amongst the piles and piles of Dark Arts textbooks. There was nothing bloody better to do anyway.
“Fine then, come here. You did offer, so kindly, to help me, after all.”
Harry stared at the red ‘E’ on his page in wonder. An ‘E’ in Charms in Eighth year! Was this what Hermione felt like?
“I can see that, Mr Potter,” she began taking each book individually and whizzed them back off to their proper places with a clever charm, one by one.
“Uh, where do you want me to put you?”
The whole area looked like an outdoor Yule Ball. ‘Sort of like Bill and Fleur’s…’ Harry’s brain supplied, oh so helpfully. He managed to squash any ‘not fun’ memories by pouring himself a glass of something that looked like punch but smelt like hot chocolate. Harry’s stomach wasn’t quite settled enough to take a sip just yet, so he held the glass awkwardly and looked around. He was in a giant plain, no less than two football fields in size. The place was very well decorated. It seemed like Luna had made a point not to put up anything that looked too Christmas-y. This was, after all, not a Christmas party. Floating, glass snowflakes dazzled ten feet above them like weirdly shaped disco balls. Lanterns carrying bursts of blue fire lined the trimming of a large tent in the centre where tables were laid with plates and glasses. The table of pastries was under its own, special tent off to the side. People were everywhere, dressed in their very best robes. Harry was suddenly happy Hermione had forced him to go out shopping, otherwise, he would have looked like one of the waiters (who were carrying around trays of empty plates, presumably for collecting one's selection of pastries).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“It’s not a huge deal mate, just a theory going around that’s all. See, Michael Corner, you remember him right? Yeah, well, he said to Hermione and I that he heard from Lavender that she had maybe heard Cho saying that McLaggen had been told by Neville that Luna had maybe, possibly, sort of, invited… uh, Malfoy.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harry pet Alistar’s beautiful silver coat as he read under candlelight.
Pansy gasped, “Why, Draco! And leave the both of you naughty boys unchaperoned on a date? What kind of friends would we be? No, Blaise and I shall join you henceforth!”
Harry looked down at the demented biscuits shoved into a Tupperware container. Feeling sarcastic, he muttered out a terse, “Brilliant.” He was not feeling very optimistic about the next day.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, Draco?” No one else was left on the lakeside, just him and Draco. Alone. “Do you need something?”
“It was all in Draco’s smiles and wistful sighs, even a blind mountain troll would be able to tell there was love in the air.” Pansy sing-songed.
He watched Harry huff and dig some galleons out of his pocket to pay, “Don’t you worry ‘bout that, it's on me. Just… tell him I’m sorry, will you? And that he’s welcome here anytime.”
“I said yes.”
“Ronald! My book’s going to get wet!”
“We should do this again sometime.” Harry blurted out without really thinking.
Harry was still finishing the last ¼ of an inch as he was sitting down, eyes trained on the parchment. He didn’t notice he was sitting alone at the workstation until the bell rang and Slughorn walked in.
“Well, I need to go purchase a few more, if you don’t mind.”
With the small paperback wobbling on top of its larger, heavier counterparts, Harry eventually made his way to Madam Pince’s desk. He dropped the pile on the wood with a sigh of relief and
The lake was crowded when they arrived a while later.
After another half hour of browsing, he plopped a small pile of books on the shop counter and paid.
“That wasn’t what I asked, Draco.”
“I can walk just fine now, Potter. Thank you.”
“Well... I just thought that…”
“So how does the exchange work then?”
“I appreciate the thought, but so far all you’ve done is stare at my writing and nod at it like you know what it means.”
Draco enjoyed the long hours on the ice, forgetting all his troubles and basking in the glory of the power skating gave him.
“It’s a fact of my life and I can’t do anything about it. All I can do is to move forward,” He laced his hand in Harry’s with nervous fingers. That’s what their relationship was, more or less. All nerves, carefulness and learning. A comfortable silence washed over them and they basked in each other’s presence for a while.
“It’s alright, you don’t need to tell me. Forget, uh, forget I even asked.”
“Oh, I knew he’d take it poorly!” Hermione gestured to Harry emphatically. Ron was quick to continue, reassuringly.
Draco looked alarmed and inched away at Seamus’ sheer intensity.
“Malfoy!”
Dun-dun-dun?
Thank you so much for reading! xx
Draco flinched at the impact, “At least I won’t be cold.”
It was snowing. A layer of white was dusting the grounds outside of Grimmauld Place. Harry could feel the chill it brought in the air, even when he was safe inside the Black family library. Evidence of Death Eater ransacking still littered the rooms of the ancient house. Even so, it was still the easiest place for him to call home. It had already been multiple months since Harry’s purpose had been fulfilled and Voldemort had been defeated. He still felt tired and empty, the same sort of feeling that he got after the Battle of Hogwarts. The only difference now was that he had lost interest in seeing anyone. Even Ron and Hermione had been ghosted for the larger part of two seasons. Letters from them (from all his friends) were thrown, unopened, on a table in one of the house's many sitting rooms.
Percy plucked a random paper from his pile and brushed it off, in so doing, he knocked a few books off the table. They landed on the ground with a loud thunk that echoed in the silent night. Harry winced.
of his senses indeed.
Kreacher seemed to age a couple of years as he caught sight of the huge pile.
“Can you… help me up the path?”
I wasn't quite happy with this chapter, so I edited it again and have now reposted it. Hopefully, it's a bit better now!
“I think I just stole from Honeydukes again. Technically.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Yes, master?”
“Alright, should we go somewhere more private then?”
“Eat up! I swear sometimes that school must be starving you!”
Now, what will I do with my life every weekend? :)
Ron fixed him with a stare that he felt saw into his very soul but kept his mouth shut and then smiled at him, for which Harry was insanely grateful. There was nothing else he felt he could say. Hermione didn’t seem nearly as satisfied but Ron came up behind her and put his hand on her shoulder. She seemed to understand what that meant and neither of them said anything else for a while like they were having their own psychic conversation. ‘Love is weird.’ Harry thought as he took the container out of Ron’s hand, pulled out a piece of fudge and sank into it happily. It tasted stupidly sweet, but most of all, it tasted like Molly’s love.
It was brutal and to the point, each word landed like a blow to Draco’s already fragile psyche.
“I didn’t even know you told them about us.”
“I was quite looking forward to living with you,” he mumbled.
They squeezed through the Honeydukes entrance, crowded with what seemed to be the entire Hogwarts’ student body. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand to keep him close and they began browsing the various tubs of sweets. Draco stopped at every one of them, staring longingly at the colourful treats and pouting at Harry until he would chuckle and pop them into a paper bag for purchase. Ron might have said something about ‘being wrapped around his little pointy finger’ but the look of pure joy on Draco’s face as he tasted tested from tray after tray made it all worth it.
“Uh-huh,” Harry said, in false understanding.
a bit of a nerd.
“...concerned about,”
There are only three more chapters left! Ah, I cry.
“Uh, sure.” He didn’t really know what that meant.
Draco smiled as the winter air flew across his face at high speed and he sped up to make it go faster.
Harry swung around and spotted Luna Lovegood behind him, smiling in that pleasant, whimsical way that only Luna could. He relaxed his shoulders and greeted her with a nod.
The sun was shining over the snow-covered grounds and many students had made their way outside to enjoy the little bit of warmth. From their table in the library, they could see the snowy Scottish countryside out of a window. Harry was spending more time staring out there than the work in front of him, potions - 30 inches on the benefits and properties of fluxweed (Merlin, he hated N.E.W.T.s). Hermione snapped her book shut, to which Harry and Ron immediately perked up. That meant that Hermione would be merciful and free them all from studying.
“I love you, Hermione. I’d die for you.”
Harry thought of Narcissa and of that time in the forest.
in chipped, gold paint
Ron scoffed. Harry looked up at him quizzically and caught Hermione giving Ron a look of ‘for-the-love-of-Merlin-shut-up-you-blithering-moron’.
“I mean it’s not finished. The jury failed to conclude.”
Seamus took a few deep breaths and planted his hands on his knees, he was still panting aggressively as Draco carefully backed away with Harry grinning along beside him.
That was all it took, in a matter of moments the peaceful lakeside had turned into a battlefield. A happy one for once. The fight became more and more intense, soldiers joining together and then splitting into separate factions. The ice skaters had become land born and were making quick work of Padma and Parvati’s makeshift bunker.
“We’ll be working in pairs today, on a simple Fluxweed Syrup. So I hope you’ve all done your homework! I’ll be collecting it after- Ah! Mr Malfoy! Thank you for joining us!”
“What can I say, Potter, you bring out the worst in me,” Blaise grinned wide and followed Pansy as she skipped up to them, seeing their stop as an invitation. She was beaming at them so wide it was almost scary.
“This case is clear and should be equally as concise. My client is a free man and is fully able to handle his family's vaults, as he has done since the age of eighteen. There is simply no way Draco Malfoy could be named as the inheritor of the Malfoy estate as he is no longer a Malfoy at all. He is no longer fit as a descendant of my client and should not be liable for the contract for a moment more at the present date. My aim here today is that this outdated contract of inheritance is made, without a doubt, null and void. Thank you.”
“Brilliant.”
“Father- Lucius is a bit more conniving than that, sadly.”
“We are gathered here today on the grounds of the inheritance of Malfoy Manor and its finances. This will be a trial by jury. Plaintiff, please introduce yourself and present your opening statement.”
Harry’s anger slid away into shock, “Will do,” Flume smiled tightly and even cast a feather-light charm on the bag for him.
Harry’s face fought to keep a smile. Absolutely insufferable.
Dean peaked around the corner of the doorway, “He’s been running around for the last hour, I think he’s about to have a heart attack.”
“Pansy, this is Harry Potter. Harry, this is Pansy Parkinson.”
“Yes, well, I have a lot more adrenaline when I’m skating. I stay warm. You, however, are going to catch your death,” Draco pointed to his thin sweater and worn gloves, “You’re the saviour of the wizarding world and you can’t afford to get some new winter wear? Maybe a scarf?”
“I also have to, uh, go buy a gift for,” Harry looked around, refusing to make eye contact, “someone.”
Harry, Ron and Hermione all turned to stare at Arthur in shock.
Wonderfully confusing butterflies erupted in Harry’s stomach for all sorts of reasons. Draco had said his name for one, his first name. And he’d laughed and touched him. His hand was warm on Harry’s shoulder, it drifted slightly down his arm before Draco pulled it away. He instantly missed it. Right now, it didn’t matter to him that he hadn’t yet managed to find Ron and Hermione, he was comfortable here, with Malfoy. At every word the other spoke, Harry felt his chest warm more and more. In an effort to even out his softening facial features, he scanned the table of desserts beside them and noticed a dish of bright purple muffins. There was a sticker on the plate that read ‘Lovegood’s Hyena Muffins’ in big bold lettering. He leant over and picked one up to inspect it. Draco broke off mid-sentence and his eyes went big.
Draco held his head proudly as the last eighth years trotted over to compliment him, they continued on until Pansy cleared her throat and ordered them all back up to the castle. Draco hadn’t talked so much in a good while, but he answered questions and received praise with gratitude and happiness, all the way back to the warm common room.
I'd like to give a special thanks to vanillacrisp, who leaves lovely comments on every chapter! <3 You have no idea how much that means to me!
“Just open the damned thing.” Draco frowned and tapped his foot, impatiently. He looked oddly nervous.
“I think this is going quite well! We have a real shot here! And just wait ‘til my next point, you’ll see Draco, we have this in the bag.”
Draco shook his head, “Of course not, no one is.”
Draco laughed and put his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “It’s okay Harry, I know what you mean, you don’t have to explain yourself. I’m looking forward to moving back to London if I can.”
Malfoy tucked the card back into his pocket as he led Harry in.
"Is it really that big of a problem?"
To the back of the room, there were two arches - tall, broad, made of silver. Beyond one, Draco could make out hospital beds and witches in medical garb, potion benches and ingredient racks through the other.
Another tiny alley led off the one they were in, straight to a large, brightly painted door.
"Hello, Auror-"
"What is it with this place being down an alley?"
"Potter?"
He loves it.
"You need to leave," he manages to force out, turning away from the warmth of love - of him.
"I can't," Potter replied, holding his hips in place while trying to pull out.
Draco's breaths are coming up short, almost panting.
It had been far too long since Harry had dated someone - even longer since he'd had the confidence for a one night stand - and the idea of the blond was getting his blood boiling.
Draco was not about to let him call him by his given name. And he absolutely refused to admit he liked the way it sounded.
“All the wildflowers blossom in late Spring,” she had said again when Christmas came and went. “The Burrow will look lovely covered in daisy chains.”
"They've already driven me mad, Potter. The question is when you'll finally lose it."
But now he was alone with an Alpha, in a closed-in space, with a young son. He was only grateful for the strength of the smell of potions and ingredients, masking his own scent.
Potter, werewolf or not, was the definition of an Alpha.
"Hey, you can look at me you know. This will be really weird for both of us if not."
Harry growled into his ear, hands clamping down on slim hips, dragging him up off the floor. Draco gladly wrapped his legs around Harry's waist, letting himself be carried to the Floo.
Panic crept up Draco's throat, digging into his skin wherever the ropes touched him.
Merlin, Draco thought. He's actually going to fuck my mouth.
Harry pulled him into another hug, pulling Draco’s head into his chest and forcing calm over their Mark.
Dray. Merlin, Malfoy was letting someone call him Dray.
"I tried to avoid the papers, around that time."
"What would you like to drink?" Malfoy asked, picking up the wine list.
"Thank you. I'll see you out," Draco's mother says, leading Potter out of the sitting room.
"He doesn't- he didn't transform, did he?" His mother asks, putting down her teacup and staring at Draco.
He could already hear Harry racing down the stairs, pulled by Mark screaming with pain.
"I'll take that as a no. We can fix that," she insists. Harry noticed the other girls all lifted their heads, nodding enthusiastically.
She'd called later that afternoon. A kind, thoughtful face that asked him questions that pushed his memory. She must have approved his answers, or been captured by his questions since she offered him a trial day.
"Shit," Draco breathed, pulling away.
"Harry!" She cried, causing the rest of the Weasleys to turn and rush him.
She's talking about potion regimes, healthy eating, regular exercise. All the thing a loving, willing parent would want to hear.
"Narcissa, I know you love him. That's obvious. But he needs to be somewhere he can't accidentally hurt you. We have specialists who can check on him - they're all excellent at defensive magic, so he couldn't hurt them if he tried. It should settle down over a few months, but for now, we can't know how or when it will happen."
What is this? An update? Unbelievable.
"You're feeling very generous, aren't you?"
"It all seems very... functional. You said there were some changes in the law, thanks to this lot?"
Draco ran his hands down Harry's side, making it to the bottom of his jumper and letting his fingers skim smooth skin. Back up, under the jumper, feeling every smooth plain and raised scar.
"I've already heard it all from Sophie." Harry waved a hand towards the door, where the shrieks of the first children could be heard. "Go on, off to work with you."
Draco hummed, walking around them to look at the kitchen more closely.
"How did you find this place?"
Hermione snorted, pushing him away from his cauldron so she could peer into it.
"Like he was the only person in the room. Harry, that's how you used to look at Ginny. It's how you look at someone you love. Tell me, honestly, how did you meet?"
But the small blond was smiling, and he was babbling away to Teddy about they were a family now, and they could share a room if he wanted, and he had to have blue walls.
If the bubbling in Harry's chest was anything to go by, Malfoy was right.
Harry swore under his breath, choking on a toffee. He settled for glaring at her.
"Draco-"
It was intoxicating, and Draco realised he'd have to be careful with the other man.
"No, it didn't. But we did take a while in the restaurant, and you insisted we walk the whole way back."
"No, they're-"
Merlin, Draco wished he'd get to the point.
"When can you start?"
If the way Malfoy's eyes took him in was anything to go by, the girls had done well.
"Your coffee, Dear."
"Well, we're technically still going through what you've paid for." Harry can't help himself. He winks, delighted when Malfoy blushes again and hides his face in another menu.
Potter had given his wand back.
Hermione looked doubtful, watching the way her old friend ran his hands through the blond's hair, leaning down so Draco could whisper something in his ear, making Harry laugh.
Harry hadn't had the energy to change much after he moved to the muggle world. As the only piece of magic in his life, it seemed far too daunting.
"It's not for a dog."
Harry was laughing far too much. He could feel himself getting louder, but he really didn't care.
The body behind him hummed, pressing itself flush against his back.
And Teddy was shifting his hair through every shade of blue he could think of, until the two of them settled on a colour.
He loves it. Loves this silent moment with this beautiful man.
"What the fuck did you expect? Did you think you'd just stand there and I'd magically be able to blow you? I can hardly move like this, so you're going to have to do all the hard work."
"Careful, you're leaning too close."
"About a month. More, if you include my boss telling me stories about where he works."
He wasn't even dressed properly! The T-shirt he'd slept in and a pair of comfy pyjama bottoms hardly constituted proper dress.
Something was tugging at his gut - not illness, but a feeling. A feeling of unnameable dread.
Something warm and slick was... well it was leaking out of somewhere unspeakable. Draco could hear his wolf in his mind, begging for Potter's cock to push through the slick.
"How is your mother?"
"She has very beautiful hair. How does ginger hair curl like that? Kay could never manage it."
"How long do you have him?" Looking up at the sound of feet running overhead.
"Okay. Well, we'll have to arrange something soon."
It was big, white, and flooded with natural light. On two of the walls were magical windows - one showing a golden beach lined with palm trees, the other showing a vineyard. Desks were scattered around the office, piled high with paperwork. Boards speckled the space, covered in notes and papers, occasionally turned to a witch or wizard to add some new piece of information.
Harry grinned, taking a sip of orange juice.
Harry looks at his feet, shrugging. "I couldn't stay. You know what the papers were like. I spoke at trials, and all they cared about was the fact I broke up with Ginny!"
, Potter?”
Harry beamed at him. That was a lot purer than he had imagined, though on second thought a first-year trying to sue someone would be a bit far-fetched anyway.
Draco groaned but let Pansy wiggle in between him and his boyfriend, linking their arms so they were all forced to skip along with her all the way to the Hogsmeade gate. Blaise was laughing all the way there, staying a metre behind to free himself from Pansy’s insistent grabs towards him. It was strange but nice. Her chatting, about the weather and classes and what boys she thought were the cutest (he made the list, Harry was happy to find), distracted them both from the weird looks they got and soon Harry didn’t even notice them.
“He is.”
“I’m happy, is all. You did surprisingly well!”
With a mouthful of roasted sweet potato, Arthur continued with vigour.
“It helps you sleep, right?”
“Of course, and it’s not a Christmas party,” Hermione replied after a moment. She finally moved away from Ron and sat down on one of the dusty sofas.
“Right, now that we’re all very well acquainted, can you two bugger off?”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Thank you all. But I still would rather be six foot under right about now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So… I’m assuming the two of you also know about this Malfoy business?” He asked Ron and Hermione.
“You sure you don’t want me to be in there with you?”
“Thank you, Harry. My mother taught me to skate when I was a child.”
Harry stared up at the large, densely decorated archway that was being used as an entrance. A very pointless one since the party was being held outside and completely in the open. Luna hadn’t mentioned in her letter that it was an outdoor event, it felt too cold to be. The noise of the crowd was palpable, most of the guests must have already arrived. Or at least that’s what Harry hoped because there were just so many people, all talking in tight-knit cliques. He looked around, semi-frantically, to try and spot Ron and Hermione and fit in just as well but he couldn’t see them at first glance. He’d have to venture deeper into the party, Harry thought glumly.
“Hmm? Say what?”
“Oh no, don’t eat that!” he rushed out as Harry brought the muffin to his mouth but it was too late, he had already taken a large bite. He looked up at Draco who was staring at him like he was anticipating something awful to happen. ‘What’s the matter? They’re just Luna’s muffins,’ he wanted to say. Before he could get a single word out, his face had broken into a manic grin and he just could not stop laughing. Loud and unashamed, he laughed so hard that he started to clutch his stomach in pain. He laughed until his sides were burning and his eyes watered. Through the tears, he could see Draco watching him, sympathetically.
Thank you so much for reading! I've been making good (hopefully) progress on the drafts of future chapters. Plans are unfolding in my head!
It occurred to Harry only the afternoon before that he did actually have to bring a pastry to share for ‘
“Almost entirely healed now,” Draco brought his voice down to a whisper, “I’ll be back skating by tonight.”
Lucius chuckled, victorious and proud, at his son and his joke of an attorney. Really, he didn’t stand a chance at all! It was foolish of him to think so in the first place!
“-And never come back here again! You pathetic Death Eater scum! You should be rotting in Azkaban with your crook of a father! I will not have you tarnishing my shop with your dark magic!”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Anyway, I think I might have found the perfect lawyer for young Mr Malfoy-”
“I see you bought something too,” Harry gestured to it.
Ron looked disinterested but the idea of being outside greatly outweighed any of his objections. Hermione chuckled, Ron was a complete open book and she was incredibly good at reading.
“Still awake then?”
“Of course, Potter! Come walk with us! Here, take Draco’s waist and help him down. My arm’s getting awfully tired.” Draco looked positively betrayed as he was unceremoniously dropped and left there, standing like an angry flamingo. Pansy and Blaise started to stroll off, leaving them to stare at each other. Draco snorted.
Hermione stared at him quizzically for a few moments. Harry felt like a confusing art piece in a museum.
Draco was huddled on the ground, his arm leaning against a broken Honeydukes crate which he had evidently landed on upon being thrown from the porch. Ambrosius Flume stood above him, spitting out scathing remark after scathing remark.
The trail down to the lake was much easier to traverse in the spring. It was clean of snow and flowers brushed his ankles as he walked. Over the crickets buzzing and birds chirping, Harry could hear the boisterous screaming of his friends. They could forgive him for being late, how couldn’t they with all of the sweets he had brought. Though Harry doubted any of them would have the chance to sample them, with Draco’s sweet tooth as strong as it was. He looked up as he passed a particularly familiar rock, looking over the horizon to where the shore was just visible.
“Don’t eat that if you don’t want to be sick later, Harry. Molly is going to stuff you full of food as soon as we walk through the front door.”
“O-oh. Probably not, no. That’s good. You’re welcome.” The words were shaky and uneven.
He brought the envelope closer to his face to examine it and was immediately assaulted by the smell of pine and gingerbread. It made for an unholy combination.
“Can you…”
The cold air was biting when he left, in stark contrast to the warm bookstore. He spotted Draco a ways away down the road, leaning against the side of the Three Broomsticks with a large paper bag hanging from one arm. Patrons were glaring at him as they entered the pub, how had Harry never noticed how bad it was before? Draco turned when Harry got closer and smiled at him.
“I’ve never skated in front of others before.”
“Don’t pretend you don’t enjoy me being gross and sappy.” He whispered into his ear.
“...your health. Can you at least tell me about the foot? That’s new.”
“I’m proud of you too!”
“What?”
“I’ll just share yours if I get too cold,” Harry winked at him and watched his nose turn red, “What’s wrong Draco? Getting a bit cold there?” He wiggled his eyebrows and grinned.
That did make Draco feel an awful lot better.
Draco wiggled his fingers at him and departed, leaving Harry to frantically look around at stores for any idea of a possible gift. He spotted an empty street corner with a tall, wonky building proclaiming:
“Come here then,
friends, and it’s not like they haven’t seen it all before.”
“Very happy to meet you too, Pansy,” Harry found he couldn’t stop smiling, this was ridiculous. And it became even more so when Zabini strolled over and the whole charade began again.
Suddenly, Harry remembered Henry and subsequently remembered the small paperback Henry had given him that day in the library.
“I should have asked Hermione what she was bringing,” Harry muttered aloud half an hour later, as he scooped handfuls of spilled flour into a small bin. “Or at least asked her to help me.” But honestly, her dragging him and Ron up and down Diagon Alley last week had been enough of her unintentional bossiness. He had never spent that many galleons on one outfit in his life. Harry had already forgiven her for it in his mind though. It gave him a strange sense of comfort to hear Hermione sigh and say, “Honestly!” while sending a loving glare to Ron’s back (as he retreated to return the ugly, orange ‘Chudley Cannons’ sweater to the rack it came from).
“You,” she jabbed him in the chest with her finger, “Have had enough ‘small tastings’ to feed an entire Quidditch team in the last hour alone. Let the children have a meal.”
“Yes, well, I’d like to help people. As opposed to the opposite, I’ve had rather enough of that.”
when he was helping Percy with the case. Clearly, it didn’t end up being all that helpful. On that note, they probably wouldn’t need it again, as useful as it’s proven itself. Harry looked down at the heavy stack in his arms, he might as well make the most of this trip.
“Merlin’s bollocks! How difficult can it be to decide between a crazed Death Eater and a well behaved Hogwarts student!”
“I thought we would have had it. I was sure our case would work.”
“I’m very sorry boys, but I’m going to have to ask you both to take an early leave.” Luna looked down on them with her hands planted on her hips. She looked more amused than angry, as he and Draco were unceremoniously booted out of the party area and out of the warming charms. They were lying in the snow now, facing up to the stars.
“Hello, Potter.”
“I’m a little upset in an odd way.”
When Draco came down the steps a little bit later, his eyes were stern and he looked intensely at the wall in front of him. Harry shot up from where he was crouched on the ground and opened and closed his mouth.
Harry stopped where he was standing and waited for Draco to say something. When he didn’t, Harry coughed.
And without a second glance, he limped over to a large rock and sat down, not dissimilar to a toddler having a tantrum. Harry smiled, finding it surprisingly endearing, maybe even a little cute. He shook his head and went off to find Hermione and Ron.
Harry laughed and plucked a chocolate from the bag, handing it to Draco as he sat up.
“Shut it, you. I would like to go on a date with my boyfriend please, if he is so inclined,” Harry said, mocking Draco’s posh drawl.
Hanging the ball over her head, Ron let gravity do the work as it landed with a crunch. She gasped and let go of Harry.
“You’ll be happy to know that I’m more aware than anyone of the intricacies of my family's past and present horrors.”
“Holy shit, are you okay?”
“Wait here!” Harry dashed back up the stairs, expertly weaving across the few floorboards that weren’t yet creaky. He only hoped he had actually packed it.
“...Thank you, I suppose.”
“Wait here, I’ll be back down soon.”
“Hey there!” He called out.
“What do you
“Haven’t heard that one in a while, Zabini.”
“No, thank Salazar, I don’t need all that trouble. It’s only ever when I go places alone now.”
“They look wonderful Harry! Would you like me to accompany you to the exchange table?”
Seamus picked the perfect time to start making kissing noises from behind them.
Draco immediately thought of the cool, clear winter air and of shining ice under his feet.
“‘Can you help me up the path’...
Ooooh, what a dramatic chapter! The ball is officially rolling!
Harry tunes Neville out as they continue on. The path is strange in the daytime. They pass familiar trees and rocks and roots, yet it all seems different in the bright light of the sun. In Harry’s opinion, things look pretty under the moonlight.
The cooing noises continued and as he neared the front door he realised it wasn’t an owl at all, but a pigeon. He chuckled, to think he was about to open the door to take mail that wasn’t there. Except that it must have been there because the corner of a bright green and red striped envelope was being pushed into his mail flap, seemingly by the pigeon. No, it had to be just a very small owl, trying its best. Harry jerked the door open and stared in shock. Talons hanging on for dear life on his door knocker, leaning down to push open the small flap with its beak was a pigeon. A regular, London city pigeon.
It was warm and wonderfully quiet and smelt thickly of old books. Hermione would love it here, Harry thought, she was probably already their best clientele. He browsed the shelves without much luck. What did Draco even like to read about? He peered along the spines of various books and spotted a familiar face through an open-backed shelf.
“Sorry… uh, I’d like to return these.”
Draco sighed but dropped his arms from their defensive position.
Too far away to hear them over the chatter, Harry tries and fails to read their lips. Parvati chips off some sparkly pink polish from her thumbnail and shifts from foot to foot. She steadies herself, looks directly at Pansy, and speaks.
Kreacher gave him a withering stare but dropped the potato he had been peeling and hobbled out of the room. Harry felt bad watching him go but he would have felt worse if Kreacher thought he had some obligation to make some stupid dessert for him. Harry made a mental note to make sure the kitchen was spotless for his return. At least this way he was caring for the ancient Black family residence instead of baking for Harry’s ‘lowly’ friends.
Harry was about to ask if that was a good thing or a bad thing, but Draco had already walked to the lakeshore, leaving him behind. He quickly trotted to catch up.
“You two are disgusting.”
Pansy clapped her hands together, interrupting Draco’s fond gazing.
Harry would have smiled then if only his cheeks weren’t burning with the wrath of a million suns. A boost of confidence came to him with Gryffindor valour.
“By the way, if you don’t mind me asking, why did you have the book in the first place? I don’t know many eleven-year-olds who would be as interested in the laws of the wizarding world.”
Madam Pince took it from him and turned it over in her hands, squinting at it. She shrugged and cast the same charm as the others at it. It didn’t move. Harry tilted his head, so did Madam Pince.
Harry perked up with a smile that could melt away the cold winter. Draco looked at him blankly. He knew Harry didn’t, wouldn’t do something like that on purpose, but it was still odd.
“I’m really sorry, I guess it’s just what I thought I needed. I’m back now though! I’ve really missed you guys.”
“It’s official. My father has been freed from house arrest,” Harry made a harsh intake of breath, “and is currently finding a suitable date for the court to gather. McGonagall was informing me that it will most likely fall after the Christmas holidays. She also asked me if I wanted to challenge him at all.”
“Alright, Harry! I’m Henry,” Henry puffed up his chest and confidently opened his hand for a handshake, “it’s nice to meet you!”
“Don’t be rude Ron! And it’s called ‘The Great Pastry Exchange.”
“Maybe I can help.”
Harry was completely frozen by the time they had made it back to the common room and his entire body hurt. Draco, in comparison, was positively beaming with joy.
Hermione sighed and gave Harry a fond look, shaking her head but smiling.
“Good on you, mate! Dream big!” He clapped Henry on the back and the small boy made an odd squeak before trotting off to the other side of the store. “He’s a strange one,” Harry said to himself.
“I’m sorry! My adrenaline is very high right now!”
worried,
“Yipee… how?”
Over the stream of heads, Harry could see Hermione and Ron walking together, hand in hand. A small part of him wanted to make childish gagging noises at his best friends staring lovingly into each other’s eyes, but he couldn’t deny how happy they both were. Maybe he should find someone like that, someone to be the ‘Hermione’ to his ‘Ron’. Godric knows no matter who he dated he would never be the ‘Hermione’. Maybe if he dated Goyle… ew.
jealous.
“It’s too late for me to send a letter back right now, so feel free to spend the night. Though Pigwidgeon’s cage might be a tad small.”
in the conditions of the death of the inheritor
It felt like freedom and peace. Under the stress of the trial, Draco had completely forgotten to take a moment for himself, to do something he loved and that made him happy. Pansy, Blaise and Harry sat at the rocky shore, hooting and wooing every time he made the simplest, most minuscule of jumps.
“Did- did the book help?”
“Draco, darling, I know this must be so hard for you. But I want you to know that I’m proud of you. So is Blaise, right Blaise?” Pansy was holding his hand in hers but let go to smack Blaise on the arm.
Henry scratched the back of his neck and coughed. He hesitated before answering, “My dad’s a lawyer, I want to... follow in his footsteps one day.”
“Shush, let’s go.”
Harry hesitated before taking it, “No, I’m pretty sure it’s from Hogwarts.” He recalled seeing the Hogwarts library sticker on the back inside cover, “see, look,” he flipped it open and pointed to it.
Draco began reciting the password to the door but was cut off when it swung open without him finishing. Seamus was puffing loudly, red in the face.
They both ignored Ron joining in with a chorus of inappropriate moans as they ran hand in hand, giggling, up the path.
“Please?” Harry amended immediately as if that would help the elf.
“I could take over, if you need to,” Harry could see his dark circles even in the dim dungeon light “, wake up.”
“Mr Weasley? Your closing statement?”
“Yes, Harry told us a while ago. I still can’t believe it. How can a father want to throw away his only child like that?”
“I’m glad you find my pain funny.”
“You came! Oh, I’m so glad Draco.” Her voice boomed in the stillness. “Did you bring something for the exchange?”
“So, what now?”
The stone statue guarding the headmistress’ office stared down at them and they stared back for a while.
“So! What are we doing first? Madam Puddifoots? Zonko’s perhaps?”
“Oh, to hell with it.” He whispered and plucked his own muffin from the plate and popped it into his mouth and then Draco was laughing too, just as loudly as Harry was. If anyone had turned to look at where all the noise was coming from, neither of them noticed.
Harry was just about to make the trip upstairs to half-heartedly enjoy a bath when a loud coo sounded from the front door. ‘Another letter,’ he thought grumpily, ‘great’. Another letter meant an even heavier weight on his conscience.
Percy’s confidence had grown exponentially as the morning progressed, the shaking was gone and his words were less aggravating to listen to. Draco gave him a terse and concise smile as he stood to deliver his final point. He wanted this to be over.
Draco reached out to take the bag and pulled the books from it, reading the covers and running his hand along their spines.
“She’s invited just about everyone in her year and ours,” Hermione told him, “I know for sure that Ginny and Neville will be there, and apparently Seamus and Dean might spend a couple of days back in Britain for it.”
He stops, giving up outrunning Harry, and whirls around to face him with an angry frown on his face.
His nonchalant attitude did not go unnoticed, “Does that happen often, then?”
“Well… I meant ‘please’.
The jury took a painful hour to deliberate. Draco bit at his nails and tapped his foot. He wanted to go home. But he knew now he couldn’t, not ever again after today. So where could he go? Maybe Hagrid would be open to the idea of an assistant at the end of the year. When finally the jury was seated again, the judge read over the paper and rubbed the bridge of his nose in exhaustion. He read aloud, “We the jury find this case thoroughly undecidable and worthy of a second hearing.”
I hope you enjoyed it! xx
Percy looked up into the cloudy sky, “How am I going to tell Dad I failed?”
It was all a bit bittersweet. The lake rippled in the sunlight and made waves up the rocky beach, no longer a flat plane but a flowing body of water. Harry could see Seamus and Dean running around, chasing people with balls of fresh mud, laughing themselves silly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You're going to eat me out of my vault! I think I know how to keep you happy now though!” Harry shouted to him over the din. Draco smiled manically and pulled him along to the next section.
“People are staring.”
“That’s what I thought. You both do need to finish that scroll by tonight though, it’s due tomorrow. Come on, then. We should go meet up with them all in the common room.”.
As Harry finally drew his attention from Draco’s retreating back, he spotted Hermione sitting alone on a large couch, watching him. He walked over, feeling strangely light, and plopped down next to her.
“I’m not sure actually, haven’t had a chance to read it yet.”
“I doubt it’s going to be that much of a big deal, don’t worry.” Draco gave him a comforting smile and pecked him on the forehead, leaving him to lean against the stone wall and tap his foot on the floor.
Harry and Ron laughed until their sides hurt, and when the book was safely tucked in her bag, Hermione joined in too.
“Can you please move all of the letters from that sitting room,” he pointed over Kreacher’s head, “to my bedroom?”
“Nasty stuff, nasty stuff indeed,” Arthur took a long sip, “How is he handling it?”
Harry could hear Draco’s grin, “Is this to be a date-date?”
“Kreacher!” Harry called into the empty hallway. A loud popping noise.
The air was still crisp enough to suggest he wrap his scarf a bit tighter around his neck. It was dark green with silver tassels, an obvious gift from a certain Slytherin. As long as he didn’t wear it to Quidditch games, Ron had said, then he was free to revel in the glances it earned him. Pleased as he was of his relationship, why should he hide it? It was a badge of honour, representing Draco’s achievements and growth in life and in character. Harry was filled with glowing pride at its unapologetic ‘him-ness’, hard-earned and long deserved.
Thank you so much for reading! This chapter is a little longer than its predecessors, hope you enjoyed it! xx
Pansy looked genuinely shocked for a moment, eyes wide open and mouth agape. She gathered herself together before giving Parvati a small, hopeful, smile. Smacking Draco’s side and getting up, silently ordering him to follow, she makes her way to her dorm room. Blaise trails after them. Before long they come back, Pansy swinging a pair of ice skates from her arm and the two boys behind her.
Harry moved forward to try; running a hand lightly across the brushstrokes. It was maybe the only clean surface they'd come across in the dungeons; charmed to be resistant to dirt for all time, beyond the lifespan of the artist and the attention span of the subject. The once gilded frame had not been given the same treatment; brassy and tarnished where it wasnt slime coated.
"They think I'm under an invisibility cloak... guys, they know it's us." Heavy footsteps joined the cacophony of noises. Someone was climbing the stairs.
"Shit, shit, shit." Ron began a path of panicked pacing. Hermione, breathing rapidly, raised her wand and pointed it steadily at the door. Harry looked between his friends. The only people he had left.
Harry allowed her to pull him back and he stood shoulder to shoulder with Ron, drawing his own wand and zipping his coat up to his chin, swiping his hand across his upper lip and glancing to catch Ron's eye. There wasn't anything beyond the portrait door, he knew that, but they'd all learned the truth behind 'better safe than sorry'.
"Ron, shut it." He shot back, glaring at the redhead before turning a softer gaze to Draco. "You've got brewing experience?"
I'm hoping to get the fourth and final part of The Mark up sometime this week, then I've got a week off dedicated to writing. That is the current plan, but as anyone who follows this channel knows, every time I make a plan it falls apart.
“You know you do have to choose a date at some point, don’t you?” This time she was brandishing wedding books, littered with pictures of red and golden leaves, forcing them into his arms. “I’m sure Harry would be delighted to have a date in mind.”
"Really?" Andromeda asked, glancing up at the living room ceiling. "How-"
Maria was nodding, giggling at the prospect.
For the first time, he feels it - feels the building pleasure every time Potter rocks into him, the lightning shooting through his skin wherever Potter touches. The sound of Potter breathy moans, crooning in his ear, whispering filthy encouragements with every stroke.
Potter bucked forwards, cock sliding into Draco's mouth, hot and heavy against his tongue.
"And you're gay?" That's the part Harry really couldn't believe. Or maybe he could. It was difficult to figure Malfoy out.
"What the fuck, Potter?" Panic was bubbling in his chest, catching his breath and clenching his gut.
Draco stayed up half the night, twirling his wand around his fingers. He had his wand back.
“I could eat you out?”
Draco was sweating - no different to any other time he had all the cauldrons bubbling at once. There'd been a massive order of his version of a sickness potion - it was smooth and tasted almost like water, which made it easier for people to drink when they were ill. Now he was planning to work through the night to get it finished.
Draco turned then, the flames under the cauldrons blowing out as his mind narrowed down onto Harry.
It can't be happening. He can't let it happen.
It was open and warm, with balloons huddled in corners and self-filling glasses on silver trays hovering in midair.
"Very nice to meet you. He's just waiting up in the office. That's right, straight up the stairs. Only one door to worry about. There you go."
Draco swore, squeezing Harry's thigh, and Harry decided he'd do anything to get that sensation again.
"The lady in the shop said it matched my eyes."
He didn't realise he was making a noise until Potter brought his lips to Draco's ear, words dragging across his skin.
Of course, he couldn't always hide it. It was there; when he looked in the mirror, when he got dressed, when he showered.
Draco quickly summoned a nearby vase of flowers, watching with bated breath as Potter cast another spell.
Draco was furious. How dare Potter come into his home, eat his jam, and make him feel like he wasn't allowed to wear his own bloody pyjamas at his own bloody breakfast table.
"Harry," Draco whispered, breath fanning over his face.
"What?"
The door opened, a figure stepping in and closing it behind them.
Harry found them in the tapestry room, Teddy sat on the floor drawing, Draco gingerly touching a burn mark.
Potter grinned down at him - wide and dangerous and hungry - as he moved around the table to push at Draco's thighs.
He nodded.
Ron was still frowning, trying to crane his neck to see the little girl.
Draco wanted to fight. Wanted to curse Potter out for the very suggestion. Merlin, if only Potter's fingers, rubbing gentle circles into his rim, weren't sending sparks straight to his cock.
They'd talked about France at the shop - about his whirlwind romance with Scorpius' father, the aftermath, the years of work it took to become half the man he had once been. All for you, he never said.
Draco admired the Slytherin edge to her methods, but was utterly exhausted with her constant jibes. It was why he kept sending Harry to get the kids.
When they came back, only Luna and Hermione dared mention the wedding. Harry pointedly ignored it all.
His eyes paused when he went far enough into the store, finding himself staring at a pair of leather trousers, hanging next to a shelf of collars and leashes.
"Draco, don't." Harry warned, already moving back from the door. "If you need anything, owl Neville or Luna. But I'm going to be out of commission for a week or so, alright?"
Everything crashes around him, sending him toppling over the edge of an unseen waterfall, crying out as it plunges him under the water.
Harry suppressed a laugh, taking a long drink from his coffee to hide a smile. Hermione burst out laughing.
"Kitchen."
They had a simple routine that week - fuck until you pass out, an hour in the morning for other necessities, then right back into bed.
He'd defied expectations by raising his son alone. Now he aimed to beat that expectation again by becoming a potions master.
Draco vaguely feels himself nodding, wondering if he could get away with disappearing. He won't be able to hide it forever.
"Yeah, we're pretty happy with how far we've come. Although I want to start offering services for younger ones. We specify 18 months minimum, but I want to offer space for those younger. Lots of single parents out there who need somewhere to put their kids so they can work."
"Fuck," Potter whimpered as Draco's tongue finally - finally - licked a filthy stripe over the head of his cock.
"-possible. I've written to every potions master, nobody will take him on."
Harry sees Malfoy smile, even though he tries to hide it, and barely listens as he orders wine.
Stumbling out of bed, searching the room for- for something. His mind raced to find an answer, but none came. Just the dark, thrilling bliss running under his skin.
"That's my cherry jam!"
"This is Sirius, my godfather," Harry's fingers brushed against the burn mark, then moved further along. "This is Andromeda, and this is Tonks, Teddy's mum."
Which is how he found Harry fucking Potter once more.
"Its... definitely not what I imagined."
Harry felt Draco's finger's brush against his neck as he set the collar in place, relishing in the quiet click as the clasp closed.
"No."
And even that failure of a date was with someone he knew. This was a complete stranger. Harry wondered, briefly, if he'd ask too many questions about his scars.
Then it was all wet heat, rippling around him as Potter swallowed.
"Draco," Potter smiled up to him, wand in hand. "Ready to have the last of the tracking spells removed?"
“Take this off for me?”
The fire roared to life behind him. He turned to see Narcissa Malfoy walkthrough, quickly followed by Draco. He hadn't seen him in at least a week. He'd been pleased when Draco had shown up on his doorstep unannounced Friday evening, demanding to be let in and watch telly with Teddy for the second visit in a row.
Sophie whistled, long and low, resting her head back. She was almost completely submerged in the pit, light brown hair fanning out around her.
"Harry works at a daycare centre for young children. Teddy goes there every now and then when he wants to get out of the house."
He'd been sat in Potter's office ever since, curled over and whimpering in pain. Not from the itching or the cramping in his gut. No, he was in pain because he was hard - had been for well over an hour now - and he couldn't explain it.
There was the suspicious pack that George had left when he helped them move in, but they still weren’t certain if they would turn into canaries eating them.
"So," Ron said, shoving his hands into his pockets.
Draco's mother hadn't been in the drawing-room. After throwing on what he'd been able to grab - underwear, shirt, trousers - he crept through the Manor. She wasn't even in the Manor.
"I INVITED YOU OVER FOR TEA. FUCKING TEA, SEAMUS. HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO BLOW UP AN ORDER OF WOLFSBANE THIS SOON BEFORE IT GETS COLLECTED? MERLIN'S FUCKING BOLLOCKS GET OUT OF MY SHOP BEFORE I GO OUT OF BUSINESS!"
"Lycanthropy in the new advancing stage causes an increase in fertility rates. We have a young woman at the moment who couldn't have children - tried for years, got told she had such low rates it was impossible - but now she can! Her rates have tripled over her last two changes. This could change everything."
"I'll go see what he needs," Draco says, pressing a kiss to Harry's neck. "Give you time to sort yourself out."
He's afraid, desperate, and very pissed at the git who keeps making him feel this way.
"Don't forget to show him your drawing wall, Ted."
The only one who knew where he could be found was Andromeda since he'd insisted on being an active part of Teddy's life.
"You want me to-?" Potter swallowed, soothing a cracked voice. He closed his eyes, pressing the heels of his hands into them, before looking down at Draco. "You're sure."
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione nodded, watching Harry's face. Draining the last of her tea, placing it gently on the table, she folded her hands together.
"You think he's different now?"
“Draco I’m- I’m not like him,” Harry growled. “I would never leave you.”
“Perhaps a winter wedding? The snow would be lovely,” Luna had said when the first few months went by, determined to convince Draco she knew what she was saying.
"Yeah. Wait, didn't you read the papers? Just after the trials, he broke it off with Weasley's sister and told everyone he was gay."
He tried not to think about it too often. He figured it was a dangerous road to go down, wondering how all his friends were.
"I'm going to go watch telly!" Teddy announced, rushing off down the stairs.
"That wasn't my fault." Harry insisted, pointing an accusing spoon at Draco. "Just because I made you jump a little, doesn't mean you can blame me."
Draco supposed he should be grateful. Then again, his brewing was currently being interrupted by a much bigger, much more persistent problem.
"This is a list of contacts and changes in the law surrounding lycanthropy." Draco flinched. Why should Potter know? "A lot has changed, and the Lycanthropy Department has ordered that everyone should be given this pack to help them-"
Of course, they'd all overreacted. Someone had gone running off, coming back with a medical witch and Potter, panting and asking him where he hurt.
"Teddy," Harry said, surprising himself with how good his Angry Parent Voice was.
"No more drinks. I won't do anything to you if you keep drinking."
Harry turned at the sound of Teddy yelling, seeing Draco carrying him down the stairs over his shoulder.
"He doesn't like going down the stairs when he can't see the way he's going," Harry explained shaking his head. Teddy was wearing trousers, a shirt, and socks. It even looked as if Draco had managed to comb his hair.
That was when Fleur looked up, presumably to greet Teddy and Andromeda, and spotted Harry sat in his armchair.
“Oh, of course.” Harry brings his hands to tug at the buttons of Draco’s shirt. “I’ll definitely get that off for you.”
There was heat at his back - wide and warm and definitely not his mother.
"She married a muggle, had a kid with him. Tonks. She-"
"Morning, Jenna."
Just as Hermione had said, Harry return later that night with Chinese food. And, surprisingly, without the kids.
Harry felt his cock stir. Merlin, he wanted it.
"What is it? Did you hit your side when you fell?" Potter's hands were suddenly pressing against his sides where Draco's own hands were clenching. Potter's touches were soft and gentle, tracing over his sides as he searched for injuries.
"Around two."
But first he needed a job, and everywhere he'd tried had turned their noses up.
"You tied me to the fucking table!" Draco cried, trying to push Potter away.
"What do you think?" Jenna asked at the same moment face poked its way around the door. Head dyed bright pink, Harry couldn't help but be reminded of Tonks for a moment.
When he got to the bottom he put the boy down, watching as he ran straight to Andromeda, tears in his eyes.
Malfoy's eyes snap up to his, a blush rising on his cheeks. Harry decides he likes that look on Malfoy, a moment before he realises he likes looking at Malfoy.
"Want you," he heard just before the blond screamed. He'd wanted to be gentle, but he needed to be inside him too badly for kindness.
But then, on what should have been an ordinary Tuesday, everything turned on its head.
"Harry?" The voice called, followed by the smell of pastries.
"Are you saying there's a chance you might already be pregnant?"
"So, this is the legal area?" Draco asked, eyeing the array of desks. There had to be at least fifty, spread out across the room.
Teddy's bottom lip wobbled, worrying Harry that he'd gone a step too far, before the boy turned tail and sprinted towards the stairs, snatching his underwear on the way.
It hit Draco in three perfect little bundles, in time with the last furious thrusts of Potter's hips.
"Very original, Potter. Lord help you, because I'm certainly not holding your hand through this. Draco, Harry. Harry, Draco. Be a dear and lock up, would you? Kay owes me a drink."
Harry scowled, looking past Jenna. Sophie was in the ball pit, submerged up to her chin. A small group of children were sat on the opposite side of the pit, throwing colourful plastic balls at her head.
He wants to hate it. Wants to despise every second. But he can't.
Draco said nothing, he stared forward blankly, devoid of emotion.
“That’s perfect, then. Shall we meet up again at the Three Broomsticks in an hour?”
The other eye opened in interest, “Mm, well, as long as you brought some for me then I don’t mind all that much.”
Harry hummed, still stubbornly bitter, “Well done.”
“‘S no stress! Just a small get together, you can spend the time hanging around us if you like. We’ll hide you behind our backs!” Ron gave him a playful wink and Harry tried to give a meek laugh at his joke. A look of realisation flashed on Hermione’s face.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“I think I found something useful!” He pushed a plate of tarts out of the way and planted the stack of parchment on top of Arthur’s placemat, “You won’t believe how intricate wizarding wills and inheritances are! Fascinating stuff, it’s a real pleasure to be working on a case like this!”
“Very much. It always has. I think it wears me out.”
Percy, although wonderfully confident in study, was not so much in practice. He was shaking as he stood and took a trembling breath, he nodded in greeting, “Your honour, members of the jury. I am Percy Weasley, I’ll be Draco Malfoy’s attorney today,” another uneven breath, “my client is the rightful inheritor of the Malfoy estate and vaults, as made clear by a contract initiated and signed by the defendant himself in 1881. Which states that Draco Malfoy is to inherit all land, finances and property previously owned by his father at the age of eighteen. As he is currently at that age, it should now be put into action. Thank you.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The letters took a whole day to go through and a melancholy feeling washed over him as the pile got smaller and smaller. Harry only skim read the ones detailing how concerned people were about how he was, he focused on the personal news ones instead, because those didn’t make him want to cry like a baby. He learnt about all of Ron and Hermione’s romantic escapades, along with Hermione’s million and one moral missions. He learnt that Neville had taken an apprenticeship under Professor Sprout and was hoping to one day teach Herbology. He learnt that Dean and Seamus had decided to escape the country for a bit together and head around Europe on a ‘Bro’s Trip’. He learnt that Ginny was very excited to return to Hogwarts the following year to finish her education and was helping rebuild. All of this without him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Geez, did Luna drop this thing in a bath of Christmas spirit or something?”
“Are you okay with that?”
Harry blinked a few times in rapid succession, “Yeah, we’ve grown pretty, uh, pretty close this year. And it’s just a lot of power for a crazed blood purist to hold, so...” Harry quickly amended. It wasn’t that he believed the Weasley’s would drop the cause if they knew about him and Draco, it was more that they might find him to be biased.
"Potter, I need you to understand something. I want you in my mouth. I'll control the speed, but you're the one who needs to move. Got it?"
"Wand," Draco handed over his wand, feeling his heart constrict at the feeling. Potter waved his own wand over it, murmuring a spell, before handing it back. "Try a spell."
"Thanks."
Luna Lovegood had shown up, along with Neville and his grandmother, who had sat with Andromeda and Narcissa and talked about any topic other than Harry.
The waitress nods, heading off to another table while Draco turns to Harry.
The whole morning in the potions lab had been fun - the witches and wizards in there had all welcomed him, testing his knowledge and sharing gossip about the legal and auror teams.
It was warm and cosy. Plush sofas, oak kitchen, glass tables. Draco had, of course, transformed most of it to his own liking.
He'd meant to spit the words at him, but his voice was rough and sleepy, and he was rather worried it came out sounding fond.
But they were grinning, and in love. The wedding was booked for the middle of winter - Draco refused to tell Harry why just yet.
"I see she dressed herself today."
"I've been overseeing every batch made for you," Potter said simply. "We had one incident where they found out who they were supplying and tried to change it. I make sure that doesn't happen anymore. Nobody in the brewing team knows who they're brewing for. It could be a five-year-old girl or Greyback for all they know. They make it, I check it and seal it, then an owl takes each parcel wherever it needs to go."
Vulnerable.
"I'd help you, Harry." Draco piped up, shifting just before Harry kicked him again.
Draco had been certain he'd be hexed or cursed the moment he stepped out of the floo, but everyone seemed to ignore him. They bustled past, some talking in small groups, others nose-deep in books and letters.
Although it definitely sounded like his type.
Draco wanted it. Draco wanted it so badly it hurt. But he couldn’t bear to hear everyone talking about it, every time he saw them.
Harry swore. He may have survived numerous near-death experiences, but this conversation would kill him. He'd die choking on a toffee.
"Harry, we need to talk."
"What are you doing here?"
"Well, that was certainly easier," Andromeda said, smiling at Harry. "It's been far too long."
No. No.
Harry considered him a moment, then directed his gaze to Finnigan. "I told you to leave." When he looked ready to argue, Harry shifted his head towards Draco. "You're scaring the kid. Get out of here."
"Fi-Six. That's cheating, she picked another one up."
Andromeda and Narcissa both raised an eyebrow, and Harry suddenly realised Draco got most of his expressions from the Blacks.
"So am I."
"I- thank you, Potter." He said, holding a hand out.
Draco screamed as Potter's teeth dug into the crook of his neck, clamping down and sucking as his hips started to move.
All she could say for sure was it wasn't the strangest thing that had ever happened to them.
"One day, they're going to drive us mad," Harry had complained, the grin never leaving his face as they found the exact shade of blue Scorpius demanded.
“Draco”? Hermione asked, poking her head into the back of the potions shop.
“So he’s still trying to get the kids?” Draco asked himself, sifting through the bags Hermione had left on the counter.”
Teddy stopped immediately, whirling to look at Harry, barrelling towards him.
"Merlin," he whispered when Harry's hands reached up, undoing the clasp of the collar and carefully holding his wrists. He closed his eyes, hoping Draco would take the initiative to put the collar on him.
“Potter, you are allowed to say the word wedding without being hexed. Enduring my attempts at muggle cooking can be just as torturous, and I  doubt you want a repeat of my last attempt.”
"We were thinking of putting Rose into a daycare," he answered, nodding down at the girl hugging his leg.
Harry wasn't sure what was about to happen, but he was certain he didn't want to be there when it did.
They fell out onto a plush carpet, breathing heavily, one on top of the other.
"It's strange," Malfoy continued, pushing Harry down an alley. "Hearing that girl call you Potter. I was the only one who did that."
"I think we gained one," Sophie said as she climbed out of the ball pit, watching a small girl in a neon cardigan rush towards a table.
"What are you doing here?"
Potter grinned, eyes flicking down to his hands.
His breath hitched, a spark of fear racing down his spine. Without thinking his hand went to his stomach - barely swollen over the last 5 months, but its there. It's obvious.
Potter was his Alpha.
She must have guessed who the other one was as well, since she never asked, never mentioned his name. On the few times he visited, she came up with excuses of illness, decorating or trips out, closing the door in his face.
"Did you do this?" He asks, voice shaking.
"Well then, I'll give you these." She taps a stack of parchments and books, balancing on an empty stool. "And I want you to track everything. Everything. What you eat, any exercise, any sexual activity-" Draco splutters, completely ignored by the witch, "- and of course the measurements around your waist. Any changes in emotions, any changes to your transformations. If it's not normal, I want it written down."
"Well, this isn't what I expected," Malfoy said, eyes raking down Harry's body.
Draco liked looking out the little window in the brewing room to watch Neville taking care of the plants. Having a fellow Omega nearby put his mind at ease.
“Because I’m drop-dead gorgeous and you can’t keep your hands off me?”
Tumbling out the other side, Harry didn't even try to move them to his bedroom. Instead, they stayed there on the rug in front of the fire, grinding into each other while frantic hands stripped them of clothes.
When Harry asked them to move in, the only thing that stopped Draco from agreeing immediately was Scorpius. If he wasn't happy, Draco simply wouldn't let himself.
"You know I couldn't stay here. Draco did, of course." Narcissa was watching her son, perhaps confused by his closeness to Harry. "It was only this morning he told me he's been living with muggles since I left. Can you believe that?"
Harry followed Jenna's gaze, seeing little Rose sat at one of the dining tables, legs swinging as she stared out at the other playing children.
Draco wishes he had the strength to punch Potter, but somehow the knowledge that his body had done this before reassured him - brought him down from a dangerous place and let him be peaceful.
"No," Potter whispers, hands resting on Draco's shoulders for leverage.
"I did," she agreed, grinning. Then her eyes locked on Draco's long, unstyled hair and pounced on him. "You should let the kids do your hair! I can send Kay the pictures."
It feels impossible.
So simple – just saying it. Letting the fear clawing at his throat escape.
"I've wanted you since the moment I saw you in my shop." Harry admitted, nose traversing the skin of Draco's neck. The place his mark should be was burning, begging for him to be claimed, but he had to hold back.
"Yes, mum."
"Sure. Let's see how strong this garlic is, shall we?"
Harry turned, facing the blond who'd come to take him on a date. Facing Malfoy.
"You're-"
His mother knows - she knew the second he came home, hiding the books and parchments in his robes. If there was one thing Draco was grateful for, it was not having to have that conversation with his mother.
His dildo collection - all very carefully hidden beneath his bed - included one very special one he used to practice this exact act.
Draco opened the box, eyebrows knitting together as he looked at what was inside.
Hermione's name on Draco's tongue sounded weird, but Harry was happy he was trying.
"Harry!" A sing-song voice drifted up the stairs, followed by stamping feet and a head covered in very red curls.
Harry ducked his head, knowing he was guilty of that at least.
"What did you do?" Narcissa asked, staring at the boy. He'd climbed onto the sofa between them, turning his face Into Andromeda's side.
"No, I'll be keeping mine," Malfoy said, folding it and placing it in the booth. "What about you, dear?"
"What did you do to your hair-"
"Potter," he greeted, walking down the stairs to see the auror in the entrance hall.
"Just a few friends," Andromeda assured.
And there was Seamus Finnigan, running out from the back of the store and nearly colliding with Draco.
"Draco, you're not okay. Let me get you home, yeah?"
"Well, you know how it is. Very busy." Draco was grinning at him, eyes darting down to his jumper.
"There's a private one hidden just round here," Potter answers, steering him out of the office and through thin, twisting halls. "Safespace."
"Great! I'll call Kay, get her to sort things her side."
Jenna pushed her way into the office, rolling her eyes.
"Draco," the sound sent shivers down his spine, "stop playing hard to get. You're already having my baby."
Mark me, the voice begged.
Plus it's hot as fuck and Draco knows, somewhere in his mind, that he could come undone just by sucking on Potter's beautiful cock.
Yes, cried the voice in Draco's mind.
“Of course it is,” Harry replied, passing the tub to Draco and retreiving his own tub from where he had stashed them. “And I’ve learned from the Battle of the Cookie Dough about one each.”
"Keep screaming for me."
"I hear spring is a lovely time for a wedding."
"Draco-" Potter whines, lunging into a kiss.
"Yeah, I'm on a paperwork day."
"Why didn't you write!"
"I can't say I'm particularly pleased it's him, but if he makes you happy, then I'm willing to see what he's like. And don't even try to shut us all out again. We're not letting you do that again."
"This is a lovely little place," Hermione commented, peering round at the place. "I see you have a staff wanted poster in the window."
Draco was moaning before he knew it, logic abandoning him as he dug nails into Potter's perfect hips and sucked as hard as he could with every thrust.
"I must have been about his age. It's not changed. Not much."
"Harry!"
"If you sign up for a whole year, you get five days a week for the price of three." Harry explained, looking to Hermione for help.
“Want some ice cream?” Harry asked when dinner was finished, pulling a tub of Ben and Jerry’s out of seemingly nowhere.
“I’ll keep an eye on this. You can make tea.”
"Go away, Potter."
Draco closed his eyes, banishing tears as his lips stretched around Potter.
"Harry! It's doing the bubble thing! It's doing the bubble thing!"
“Of course she is. It’s very commendable, how well she can hold a grudge.”
"Of course. We- we really should talk. About the other night."
"Sounds like you've got a good setup here," Hermione offered, shushing Hugo as he struggled against her arms.
Draco curses, letting his anger swell as the tiny light at the end of his wand turns blue.
"It's very nice. Just down here."
Draco wasn't sure he would ever want to stop. He could already imagine what it would be like, having Potter's cock bruising his throat.
"No," Draco answers, staring through a gap in the protective screens. Potter is standing at one of the legal desks, laughing with Granger and some other witch, grin wide and bright and beautiful. "No, he won't."
Narcissa nodded, holding her hand out for one of the trays. It floated towards her, letting her take a glass before moving back to its station. She murmured into the glass. It filled with red wine in a second.
"Are you sure Rose-" Harry tugged at Ron's arm as he tried to stand, forcing him back into the pit.
"That's no time to see the whole Department! I'll take you with me when I leave here, give you a tour of where you'd be working."
