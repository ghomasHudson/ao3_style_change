He thrashes as Harry jumps backwards, hands up in apology, and tumbles from the chair, his shoulder slamming down hard onto the stone hearth, one of his hands touches the burning wood for a moment, and Malfoy jerks, and then seems to know exactly where he is, and where he isn’t.
Draco shakes his head, like a bird shaking off water, and his eyes focus on Harry. He stares at him, wets his lips with his tongue and breathes deeply.
Sometimes they don’t talk at all; Draco seems to be working his way through a host of muggle novels, some that he’s seen Hermione with and some that are foreign to him, and he’s content to read while Harry dozes. Harry’s seen titles such as
Harry knew that really, if he wanted to know, he would be able to trace Dursley one way or another. But as much as Harry wanted to confront him and see that fear in his eyes, he also wanted to be left alone to forget that Vernon ever existed, for Vernon's sake as well as his.
Draco slides the match box closed and places it on the bedside cabinet. He turns away from Harry and takes the candle over to the bathroom. Harry thinks Draco must not have heard him.
He’s not wearing a cloak, Harry notices. He’s dressed, but only in a thin pair of robes, with no cloak or coat, or gloves or that ridiculous winter hat he’d had in third year. As if he had dressed in a hurry and paid no mind to his clothes.
The pieces of the puzzle slotted together into a disturbing picture in Harry’s mind, and it made horrible sense. It explained why he’d been so avoiding when Harry asked about his holidays, why he had snapped when Harry pushed about the dreamless sleep.
Harry, realising that he’s going to be the one to carry the conversation, flops over the back of the couch next to Malfoy’s armchair, and sighs as he sinks into the worn cushions.
Harry curls his hands into fists, and the fluorescent lights above them flicker ominously. Vernon jumps, and his gaze flits between Harry and the lights. He stands frozen to the spot, and Harry can see real fear wash over his face.
One of them ran deep from the tip of his shoulder to the beginnings of his navel, and Harry can’t stop staring at where it slashed through the delicate skin of his areola. Harry can’t tear his gaze away from it, so fixated that he doesn’t realise that his hand has come up to gently caress the marks until Draco inhales sharply at the finger-tip touch, and Harry almost pulls his hand away. However, he looks into Draco’s face and finds him watching him with the same intensity, his wet lips parted and the pupils of his wide-eyes so black they almost swallowed the grey.
For a moment Malfoy glances up and their eyes meet, and Harry awkwardly raises his goblet of pumpkin juice in greeting, and pretends that he wasn’t staring. Malfoy’s frown stays on his face, but he gives a small nod before he goes back to miserably pushing food around his plate.
Pomfrey swears under her breath, and Harry raises his eyebrows, having never heard her speak that like, having never even pictured her speaking like that.
And for the time being, that was that. Perhaps, in a few days or weeks, or maybe months or years, Harry would decide to open Dudley's letter, and maybe even reply. But at that moment, he decided that Dudley could wait. Even if he was curious about how Dudley had posted the letter, he wasn't
Harry’s starts, and now he can’t make himself stop. The words keep flowing out of him, like water down a stream, and he needs to
Harry will admit, maybe only to Hermione, that he does have a knack for stalking Malfoy. Perhaps that’s unfair to say, because the map gives him an unfair advantage. He spends nights watching
Harry can see Draco’s shoulders shake, and his fingers tug out strands of his hair, but he doesn’t make a sound, a practiced talent.
“You… You could try going to Pomfrey, she’d give you some Dreamless Sleep if you asked, she won’t give me any since… She would give you some.”
He hadn’t managed to sleep, just lay there with his head pounding, thinking about Draco’s slender fingers, how soft the skin of his hand was, how empty he had felt when Draco fled.
Harry slowly set off in that direction, crouching as low to the ground as he could, wincing when thorns scraped his ankles.
Harry looks up at him properly for the first time since he started talking; his face is tight with barely contained fury, but there’s guilt hidden in his eyes. Harry had seen Draco look like that before, especially in those early months after the war when Draco had been almost paralysed with shame, and he could never stand it, even before they became close, but especially not now.
“These boys - different houses - it was a stinging hex, they said - he was tied to a chair - they said they gave him Dreamless sleep.” His explanation comes out in a jumbled mess, and Pomfrey gasps sharply when he gets to the part about Dreamless Sleep.
Harry remembered that stage of surprise, “Alby, my youngest, he’s two in August, and usually just copies whatever James says and does. James loves that, and will go around the house pointing at things, loudly exclaiming what they’re called, so Albus knows as well,” Harry chuckled at the thought, “If they stay as close as they are now, they’d be the type of brothers that would follow each other to the end of the earth, just like…”
In the house, Harry tucked James and Albus into their beds and cast a simple spell over the room as he silently exited it. When he wandered back downstairs, Ted was happily eating an evening snack in the living room, but the mood was doused in the kitchen, where Ginny was sat at the table, a cup of tea between her hands, an envelope in front of her, Hogwarts' seal pressed into the wax.
“Oh. Didn’t know you were there…” He muttered, stepping over the bench to sit next to Malfoy, albeit facing the opposite way.
“That looked like quite a comfy conversation, and I swear I saw fireworks flying at the end, when you both looked into each other's eyes as if you were all the other could ever want and more.”
He sighed, “I’ll be honest, it was more like one large, alcohol-fuelled therapy session than a memorial. I feel a bit guilty.”
Refusing to let him downplay any more, Hermione resolutely held up her hand, “Save it, Harry. I’m no idiot, I do have eyes, you know. And I can see that you’re still not over each other, now even less than before.”
“Oh? I’ve heard you’re quite the Auror, Potter. Wasn’t difficult to guess that you’d go into the profession, but nonetheless, it suits you.”
McGonagall, who had observed Harry during his few seconds of bewilderment, looked around and sighed.
“I apologized for that, I intend to do so personally to all of them as well. That aside, Potter, had you not been so wrapped up in your own issues, you might have noticed that I was, in fact, quietly wondering what it would be like to be looked at by you, in the way which you looked at Cho, and later Miss Ginny Weasley. Well, Mrs Ginny Potter by now, I assume.”
Seamus finally retreats with a wink, and joins Dean, where he immediately fills him in, and they both look back with thumbs up.
Harry sat up straight, “You don’t- Needing one isn’t the point, though. It’s an advanced spell, you have to practice it a few times before you can produce a full one.”
“I know, he won’t be forgotten, no one that ever knew him would let themselves forget him. I’m not sure anyone ever could.”
Draco looked out of the window, and paused for so long that Harry wondered if he’d heard him or if he was doing it for effect.
The fic is named what it is after Harry and Draco's patronuses, or, in Draco's case, supposed patronus. I went through a looooong list that had every animal alive on it, but narrowed it down to animals that were predatory, shy and intelligent. Through this, I came across the Grey Fox, or Fox just for simplicity. I think it fits Draco well as a patronus, but if anyone disagrees, I'd like to hear some alternatives :)
“Hermione, you could be a great help to other mothers, you know. There are lots of muggle-born witches that become mothers in the wizarding world and can really struggle. I remember Ginny telling me about it, she’s been doing research into this. She is a little unsure about writing an article about it though, since she’s really a Quidditch journalist.”
He held his fingers to the edge of the cage in hopes to feel any connection towards the animal and let out a wide grin. The owl bent down to touch beak to finger through the cage and closed its eyes as if to purr.
"Don't cum yet Malfoy, do you hear?" Harry whispered, keeping his gaze locked with Draco's who was squinting from all the nerves messing with him.
"Why can't you ever teach me how to do something like that?" Ron threw a chocolate over at Hermoine, feeling quite like a useless Wizard compared to his girlfriend.
Harry couldn't believe what he had read and reread over a dozen times in the past hour he layed in bed for.
He leaned back into the great sofa which had almost eaten him up, letting him sink deep into its cushions. His back felt relieved of all tension and he let out a soft laugh.
Harry had layed down on his own sofa. It reminded him that his was a lot more firm and uncomfortable compared to Malfoy's. He began to already miss his presence.
Again he slammed against the sensitive spot and Malfoy cried out Harry's name over and over to keep hitting it.
"Professor Slughorn has filled in the position as the potions professor, but I'm sure you'd already known of that Potter," Snape paused to stare directly at Harry, "I find it will be fitting for the both of you to spend the first day cleaning his classroom -- spotless," he dragged out the last word directing his eye contact between the two.
"I'm sure if you followed through--he might help you instead," Pansy had lowered her voice, acknowledging Draco now closing his eyes as if he longed to be lulled to sleep.
Draco rested his head back into the sheets to breathe in the familiar Hogwarts scent that had comforted him since he was 11.
They stood like that, swaying back and forth, complete silence between them but the music filled the void as if it was their conversation. Something was so beautiful and yet so fragile about this moment, Harry wanted it to last forever he'd kept telling himself.
Even at the trials when Harry had spoken for Draco, he'd been too afraid to even look at him for the whole of it.
"More more more more mo-re ah-haah, Harry-" He dug his nails into Harry's shoulders as the pleasure flooded his insides, building up a pool in his stomach.
"Malfoy.." Harry muttered subconsciously. Malfoy had dragged his fingertips over the cabinet like it was his lover, it mesmerized Harry, to say the least. Gentle but so intrigued by the object he seemed so very interested in. No way was he just window shopping, Malfoy was being obviously odd. Something his friends, however, did not see.
Harry's whole body was on top of Malfoy, pinning him down, his face was red with what Malfoy couldn't tell was anger or breathing problems.
Draco furrowed his brows, "It's fine Potter, they're kids," He turned around to hide from Harry and continued his writing.
Draco wasn't really used to disobeying his Godfather's orders, so he just went to his wardrobe and took a few robes and a couple of his favorite black button-up shirts. He put them in the trunk and watched them disappearing into its depths. So, there were the Extension Charms on this trunk. Draco thought it was good and threw more shirts, a couple of t-shirts, jumpers, and a few trousers in it as well as a book from his nightstand and a few bottles of ink and a set of quills from his drawer.
"Kreacher!" Draco called the elf. Kreacher appeared already holding full dinner tray. "Thanks, Kreacher," Draco said and tried to take it, but the tray flew in the air and out of the kitchen following closely by Severus. Draco glared at his back and hurried after him.
This time Draco sat facing him, but unfortunately this time Potter wasn't half-naked, though he looked rather good in his ripped jeans and a tight grey t-shirt. Draco noticed he left his strange black sweater with a hood on the bench near the kitchen counter and Draco sincerely hoped he'd forget about it.
But now Draco was relaxed, sitting back in his chair, drinking pumpkin juice and listening to Harry talking to his friends about what they would be doing if the thief – Fletcher or something like that – had already sold the locket to someone.
She wasn't in any hurry to stand up and go away, and Draco didn't want her here any longer, so he laid his head on Harry's shoulder and started kissing his neck.
Draco looked down on a parchment in his hand. It was a letter he wrote to Potter about fifteen minutes ago, except for the one line in a familiar messy handwriting at the end of the page.
Draco rather liked that Potter's notes became more and more like letters. Potter trusted him enough to tell they were changing their location, he cared enough to ask Draco if he needed something and he wanted to know about Draco's day.
"Hey," he greeted her. "No... What? Why the hell are you asking?... Gin... Okay... No, he's fine... Why, are you his mother?... Okay, okay, calm down, bloody hell... What? Pansy!... Well, I'm not asking you if you and Gin... Okay, fine... Alright... Bye." he ended the call and looked at Draco. "Well, she's furious you didn't tell her anything, she was really worried until Gin said to her that I left with, er, a very posh and very cute blonde guy–"
"Shit — what time is it?" He heard Harry mumble to himself while checking his watch. Harry sighed in relief when he realized it was too early to be attending to his Auror duties just yet.
"There will be no talking from either of you," The professor had turned back to walk towards the great hall with his robes flowing behind.
Draco shook his head with a sulkened expression, "I don't really have anyone that would want to even come over."
"If I have to sleep with a bloody Slytherin I'll be sleeping outside honestly..." Ron groaned as Hermoine petted his arm.
"My bad Ron," Harry quickly looked back at Pansy who was surrounded by a few Slytherins, only Blaise was recognizable from the distance but he was surprised to not see Draco anywhere near them.
His eyes wandered across the room in search of the bright blonde but felt disappointed when he realized Malfoy wasn't in the room.
Reaching up with one hand, he stroked the side of Draco's jaw before leading him slowly back down into a sweet kiss. Draco's lip quivered when Harry bit into it gently, asking for entrance into his mouth to wrestle tongues.
She grinned softly at the two, "Well thank you, I've been doing much better in case if you're wondering Draco, I didn't mean to leave your letters hanging," She admitted, "I read them every day and every day I feel better, only I kept hoping you'd come to see me." Draco's face fell with shame.
"I assume you didn't bring yours so, you can borrow another one of mine," Malfoy's fingers lingered a little too long over Harry's but let Harry explore the scented book. It was as if it had been dipped in Draco's cologne and made Harry feel even redder.
When Harry had returned he'd come back to almost a full table of people. He'd noticed that Hermione had arrived, and greeted her with a wave.
Keeping his erection calm, he watched as Malfoy's mouth was left agape, eyes tightly closed, and tried to match his strokes with the smaller's.
Something seemed so innocent but so intimate about this sudden change to their afternoon, it made Harry's heart flip and pump even faster than he thought it could handle.
He found the comb lying next to the bin near Draco's desk and saw a crumpled piece of paper inside the bin. He'd remember when Draco had torn it out yesterday and tossed it.
Harry grinned in embarrassment, he could not understand why his friends did not see anything suspicious about Malfoy. Hermione was making sure Harry wasn't going around bad-mouthing Malfoy to everyone, he didn't care to bad-mouth the Slytherin, he really just wanted to make sure he wasn't planning something dangerous. He had given them all the arguments he could think of to convince them to keep an eye on him, they only decided to call him obsessive.
Harry couldn't wait till he returned to the Malfoy Manor later, all morning till afternoon he counted down the hours to minutes, to seconds.
Giving Draco one last look, Draco nodded before clenching his eyes tightly, waiting for Harry to split him open.
Draco was so tight, even with the bit of lube he'd use to prep him, he squeezed tightly around Harry's shaft.
Ron and Pansy would go back to chatting away while Harry would flash many glances back at Draco who only looked upset and uncomfortable.
Harry hadn't really thought this through. He'd only planned on knowing where Malfoy was but what was he to do now?
His erection begged to be touched and Harry obeyed, never wanting this beautiful scene in front of him to end.
Ron shrugged, "I don't think I can live to have another rat again," He shuddered and examined this owl closely. It was a beaut for sure, coated in gold and brown, a very unique combination that wasn't often seen.
Hermione swallowed deeply and turned to her friends, she wasn’t exactly sure why she was heavily intimidated by asking a question.
Harry shrugged while Ron spoke up, talking all about their summer at the Weasley's, how they'd been asked to return to Hogwarts early, and his newly formed opinion on 'not all Slytherins are that bad'.
"Draco," Harry paused, "I want to explore that with you." Harry realized how bold he was being but this is what he wanted. He wouldn't have thought he could get this far just a few months ago and was grateful for every moment they shared together.
It was already getting quite late so he figured to lay down and get comfortable so he could visit Hermoine early tomorrow.
"I treat my books with care and see that someone like you will be returning for another if you keep your clumsiness up."
Harry awoke sometime early because it was still dark out it seemed, or he'd somehow managed to sleep all day.
"I am not clumsy, I treat all my books with great care," He paused to fully read the first paragraph, "I have a whole shelf dedicated to La Gaudière alone."
quick thanks for reading this far, I've been addicted to writing this and hope I can stay motivated to finish it
"Nevermind -- thought I heard something," Malfoy mumbled to his friends who paid no attention to his pause.
"Oh look at the time! Well, you all better be off for now, I've got some things I need to do," The trio frowned while being led out the door.
Harry had even gone as far as to twirl Malfoy around after the blonde had shown him how to. He softly let himself dip Malfoy in and out, every so often until he let Draco sit, half dipped, in his arms.
"Shh, Draco dear, it's alright," She whispered to the blonde who seemed to calm his emotions, letting go.
"Your skin is so soft here Draco," Harry spoke softly while his hand's movements grew more aggressive and rapidly raced to feel everything he could.
Harry's wandering eyes scanned the pages before Draco quickly pulled back with a worried expression.
Harry looked over at Malfoy who was too busy now pouring the tea to notice Harry's stare. Draco was one charming bloke he'd admit, even with how disheveled and comfortable he looked, he seemed fresh and soft. Very unMalfoy-like.
"What have you been doing anyway? You ran off for a solid few," He scrunched his nose and eyed Harry suspiciously.
Ron felt about the same way as Harry and welcomed Hermoine and Harry to always hang with him until the school year officially started.
Ron looked over at Harry and snapped his fingers to wake him from his daydreaming, "Sure Pansy, Three Broomsticks Inn?" He questioned earning a short nod. "Yea we can all go together, Draco's idea you can thank him," Draco's eyes shot up as he furrowed his brows at his close friend.
Harry had begun to feel sick at the many thoughts but everything had begun to make too much sense if his theory was correct. Should he confront Draco later at the pub? Or perhaps when they're alone?
"Harry I must thank you for writing back to me, I was quite worried about you." Luna brushed her hair back, grinning towards the darker haired boy.
Draco shifted uncomfortably in his seat beside Pansy, this had been a bad idea to come after what had happened but Pansy wouldn't let him go so easily.
"Morning princess," Ron teased, a familiar nickname they'd begin to call each other since Harry had begun to live with the Weasley's.
Sitting back up, he looked at Harry with a thought, "You can take your shoes off too, get comfortable," He got up towards a nearby sink and ran his hands under the water for a moment.
"Surely most of the dreams weren't ever dangerous? Not that I can remember of," He flipped through to see just how many pages were filled and Merlin was it a lot.
Draco had not been expecting a guest, for he was the only Slytherin awake to his knowledge, studying away in the common room of the snake's house.
The Manor itself was absolutely terrifying to Harry. The dark and eerie vibe to it sent cold chills down Harry's spine but he was here for Draco, and he was desperate to get closer to Draco.
"I haven't, I don't quite like the idea of that though," Draco kicked his leg with a loud thud. Ron looked over and connected the dots. With a smug look, he began to turn his hands into puppets, furiously making out with one another that matched his kissy face.
Harry gladly accepted and laughed to himself, "Never thought I'd hear you say that in a million years." His stance was a bit awkward compared to Draco's who locked his hand in Harry's, other latched onto his shoulder.
Draco gasped and bucked his hips when Harry slammed into him, violent sensations filled Draco as his mind grew cloudy. They only continued to moan and groan out each other's names into the air, Harry felt his stomach pool with sensual pleasure, a pressure was built and felt himself about to release.
Harry studied his once swollen and blackened eye and realized it seemed normal. Maybe Draco had covered it up with some illusion spell? What the spell couldn't cover up though, was the gray tone to his skin. He really didn't look too well and Harry felt he should be alarmed by this but only kept an eye on him from a distance.
Draco nodded his head and returned to the sofa, sitting a little too close to Harry but he didn't exactly mind it.
"Shall we go return these to Professor Slughorn?" Harry had shot Malfoy a mischievous grin, for once he could give the blonde a taste of his own medicine and tease the helpless Slytherin.
He shook the thought off and casually walked over towards the sofa and laid down beside Malfoy who acted as if this wasn't the first time they'd done this.
Breathing into Harry's ear he whispered, "I save first names for the bed," Everything about that comment made Harry shutter.
You had your group of HufflePuffs lounging in the center sofas, your Ravenclaws working the hardest to perfect everything they disliked about the place, and the Slytherins hanging on the sides, pointing at others and laughing every so often.
"Beautiful," Harry released the nipple with a loud popping sound before moving back up to captivate Draco's mouth into a sweet deep kiss.
Harry out of nowhere had dipped down his shaft quickly and came back up with a pop sound, startling Draco who had stuttered out a half-groan.
"Thank you to everyone who have returned at my request, we might expect more students to show later but if you all could follow me I would like to explain some things quickly." Everyone had gone quiet but quickly followed after.
"It's so much, so much, s-so much.." Draco whined as Harry continued to pound mercilessly into him, slamming right onto his prostate every time now. Draco could only handle so much more.
Draco nodded, "Where is mother ?" The elf perked up, "Mrs. Malfoy is in her room..." and with a silent thanks, Harry followed quickly Draco to wherever his mother's room was.
The room of requirement was badly damaged to the point where the door had stopped working and instead you had to step inside through the massive hole in it.
Harry awoke again for probably the 3rd time that morning, the last being from Ron with a repeated "Harry get up, get up." Ron threw a loose pillow onto Harry who groaned in response.
He watched closely as Draco's slender fingers pressed firmly against his quill, writing a lot more fast-paced than he usually did. He seemed stressed and tense, possibly from Harry's dumb comment.
Harry let out a huffed laugh with Hermoine before prying the bird off to hand to Ron. "Don't go stealing my bird now Harry," Ron sighed in defeat as Constance finally nuzzled into Ron's shoulder.
Draco let his head rest on Harry's shoulder, head of hair falling out of place and eyes slowly shutting to rest. They stood as the music box had continued to play off in the background of their minds, swaying together back and forth with glasses of wine in hand.
Harry shrugged and took the chances to read through the first few pages, very familiar with what was written, it was almost embarrassing to be reading a narrative of his wet dreams. He didn't want Draco to know that though as he may take it the wrong way.
"I don't understand why this room can't just clean itself honestly, Isn't It suppose to help those in need of helping?" Ron complained from across the room.
The minutes passed by painfully slow and the scratching of the quill to parchment rung in his ears. But alas, when he'd glance at his pocket watch he had realized that he could resume himself in the novel.
His home reminded him of the loneliness his house took on. Everything was disheveled into Harry's own way, it smelled musky and he would definitely have to check later if something had rotted or molded in the kitchen. All his curtains had been closed, leaving the place very much dark and gloomy.
Harry guided Draco's movements into an increasingly rough pattern, heavy pantings were exchanged as the boys fought to dominate the other.
"Thank yooooou — my noble knight. ." Draco made a shooing motion with his hand lightly, instantly closing his eyes and curling into a fetal position.
Draco crept up slow to Harry, careful Harry would do something outrageous to him if he'd move any faster.
The music was mellow and moody, something Harry instantly took a liking to as he began to move around with Malfoy. He hadn't really danced since the Yule ball but Malfoy went slow for him to match the rhythm of the song.
It seemed like forever before they'd gotten back, parting their ways into their rooms. Harry couldn't help but remain close to Draco the entire trip back.
"Constance no!" Ron reached for Constance who had flown over to sit on Harry's shoulder and purr into him on their way back to the common room.
"It's so nice to see you young boy, waiting for your book?" He pulled the book out from under the counter to Harry's relief.
"I-I, well — I think a couple of years after Toucher Le Ciel had been published," Harry began to calculate the year that would have been but Draco's eyes lit with excitement once more.
"What time is it?" Harry murmured out while sitting up to stop the pillow throwing. Ron looked down at his pocket watch, "Dunno sometime past 7?" Not that it really mattered when they got up since they didn't have classes for another week.
The kiss didn't last long when Draco was grinding into Harry's growing erection more and more, Harry couldn't resist any longer.
Don't know when I'll be able to update, I work a lot and have school so yea.. Let me know if you genuinely want me to keep on updating tho. Also sorry if my English is bad I'll try to edit it a little :)
played a large role in Draco's 'recent' mental decline. Unfortunately for Draco, Pansy really cared about him and his health.
"It's a long story, I don't know any covering spells and the only person I know who does is ignoring me," He admitted. It was nice out actually, even with it being how late it was. Hermoine had let them know she was running late and would later join them.
"Bloody fucks Harry, you're taking forever," Draco faintly husked earning a soft chuckle from Harry.
Draco had raised his back a little from below him, arching slightly but grinding his hips up into Harry's hand for more. Harry grinned and bent down to place a warm kiss on Malfoy's cheek.
They approached her chair cautiously, Draco silently wishing he'd find her asleep and have to come back another day. But there she was, reading some large novel, glasses tipped and tea in hand. She looked much healthier than he'd seen her last time.
next chap was supposed to have smut but I haven't been in the mood for writing smut so it might be delayed duno :(
Harry himself began to wander around the common room, it wasn't that bad before they'd began to fix it up, but now it was looking really nice and comfortable.
She began to run her hands through her friend's hair as if to temporarily comfort him. Both of them avoided talking about
The group approached where the common room would be located, all the paintings around looked to have been empty and lifeless.
"Please.." Draco motioned towards their crotches, rutting upwards to create any sort of friction between them. Harry let out a low groan of pleasure, happily grinning at the mess he created in Draco.
"So I was wondering Potter," Malfoy paused to sit down once more, "If you would like to read Coeurs Dansent with me. . " Harry flushed. What a question to ask, of course he would want to read La Gaudière's newest book with La Gaudière himself.
"It's a muggle tradition, February 14th, a day to celebrate romantic love and admiration." Harry quoted.
This isn't a big deal, he's not a bad guy anymore. Harry was the one to protest this at the death eater trials anyway. Harry just wasn't sure how to feel about his ex-enemy suddenly inviting him out to read at the Malfoy Manor.
Harry shook his head, trying to focus on McGonagall's quick tour until they'd reach the old dorms which were still perfectly intact as before.
Another artifact he always kept with him was plastered on the inside of his favorite book, a letter from La Gaudière herself! He kept and treasured this worn-out piece of parchment with smears and smudges from when he cried upon first receiving it. It was embarrassing but deeply emotional for Harry to receive a letter back.
Harry was deathly afraid to say anything more and only looked down at the floor between them, Draco's movements froze and he felt a cold sweat cover him.
Harry hungrily took a rose budded nipple into his mouth and sucked softly at it, running his tongue in circles and making sure to coat every inch in his saliva.
"You really should show me how it works though, I'm really curious as to how it could have given me this," Harry pointed to the bite mark. Draco looked up and blushed at the cause of it while drying his face.
Something else shined between both his eyes to Harry, a beautiful warmth would flutter Harry's heart as he continued the long stare.
"Harry please, please.. I need you inside me.." He flushed at his own words and how disgusting he was to be begging for Harry to make love with him.
They had taken a break after finishing the 3rd chapter and used it to talk about their lives after the war and why Santiago was the favorite of literally anyone who read Coeurs Dansent for every reason possible.
"Alright Potter if you came to ask if someone has moved their stuff into here, no one has wanted to room with me-"
Harry examined it closer up, it had been left several pages into the book so he assumed it was charmed to remain hidden.
He broke apart from the group with Ron and Hermoine and examined the owls perched around in their cages. Harry couldn't bear to get himself another owl even if it made him almost handicapped.
"Evening students, is everyone here?" She looked around and counted the Gryffindor heads before motioning them all to follow. "I'm sure you all know how to get there by floo but I don't want to see you all come back with one less head."
Closing the curtains on his large bed he kept a slit open so he could watch Draco peacefully fall asleep over a book.
Gonna need to go back and proof this, I've been behind on stuff and my sleeping schedule went graveyard..
Draco tried his best to forget the fact he'd just shed a tear over Harry Potter, but offered him a start to their friendship.
"Thanks, Hermione, that's a lot coming from you," Harry smirked, sitting down beside Draco since Hermoine had basically stolen his spot.
Draco stretched out like a cat before slipping out of bed to quickly get ready to see his mother. He was more than nervous and hoped it didn't show to Potter of all people.
Harry nodded and scanned over the first paragraph, "She hadn't but one lace left in her dress, a disheveled mess she was — Where was her boy? 'Santiago?' She called out under a whisper." Harry paused to sip his tea. Reading Malfoys writing in front of him made him a little shy.
Harry began to catch up with Luna about their shared letters, finally giving his time to the blonde who was very invested in helping Harry in any way possible.
"Bloody hell Harry I've been looking for you, Pansy won't leave me alone and Hermoine has been sick to her stomach, sent her down to the hospital wing." He sighed.
Curiosity got the best of Harry as he quickly took it, shoving it in the pockets of his robes, reminding himself to take it out later.
"Property of the Half-Blood Prince..." Malfoy attempted to reach back for the book but Harry kept it just out of reach.
"You shouldn't expect much, I'm not as fit as you make me out to be," Draco huffed into their kiss, grabbing onto Harry's shoulders, pulling him down into his body.
Just the thought of that made Harry almost reach his climax, but he wanted to make sure he came when Malfoy would.
"Can you be gentle..?" Harry hadn't even registered how painful this could be for Draco and calmly stroked his hips in reassurance.
Upon entering the Three Broomsticks, Harry's eyes had spotted Draco's blonde hair in an instant, giving him a long stare to let the other know he wasn't going to play nice tonight.
"What do you think you'll be getting then?" Hermoine chimed in turning to look at the friendly owl that followed its eyes on them.
Harry grabbed ahold of Draco's smaller shaft and stroked it up and down vigorously, doing anything to help Draco finish off.
Ron's eyes lit up at the sight and he slowly walked over to Harry, unsure if he'd actually been bought a new owl or not.
Hagrid had a laugh and the four spent a while just catching up or listening to the almost unbelievable stories Hagrid had to say about his summer.
"Forget your book again Potter?" Malfoy turned to grab the one he let Potter borrow yesterday but Harry interjected.
“Professor, you don’t suppose the fat lady was captured and taken elsewhere?” Seamus had turned to Dumbledore with humor behind his question.
"Hold on guys I forgot something in the last place," Harry nodded off from the two, grinning to himself.
"I doubt that but thank you," Draco patted the side of Harry's cheeks and gestured them both towards the door.
Harry politely followed behind, admiring the paintings on the walls until the room was revealed to them. It wasn't cold and monochrome like most of the other rooms in the Malfoy Manor. It was somewhat cozy looking and warm with all sorts of colors decorated around the shelved room.
He would look back on all the erotic dreams he'd had about Malfoy over the summer and wondered if they had all been written down in that strange book of his.
"You're making my skin burn Potter what are you doing to me?" Draco muffled, unable to keep his muttering to a minimum anymore.
"I was wondering if you'd like to spend today with me, seeing as you're always ahead in class we could skip today to do something together.." Harry rambled nervously.
"I think shes a Constance, Mum always said if she had another daughter that's what she'd name it." He let his fingers past the cage holes to stroke the gentle owl.
A couple of the books had dropped, taking him by surprise, he let out a small yelp. Harry turned to Malfoy for a moment, seeing the blonde flushed with embarrassment for a moment before returning to shoving the glasses back where they seemed to belong.
To say Harry was obsessed with La Gaudière's works would be an understatement. Harry wasn't obsessed he was captivated and moved by the works, pages, and pure poetry of Gaudière. Harry spent a good amount of his time reading as a hobby in his youth but after Luna had let him borrow one of his best seller's, he'd found himself slowly collecting every single one of them and basically framing them on his heart with a big sign saying "La Gaudière's #1 Fan".
Ron huffed, "Why has Draco been acting so...odd..." He thought aloud. Harry thought to himself possible reasons, surely it had to have been partly because he'd basically lost his father figure, his family's manor, and how traumatic becoming a death eater had been. Harry had almost missed Draco's name-calling and their occasional duels now, but he also enjoyed being able to breathe in the same air as Draco without any problems.
Potter had no idea what it could be, even growing up with both muggles and magic-folk, it didn't ring any bells.
Harry wasn't sure if anyone here would be able to lift them up and out but figured he'd deal with it later.
“I would rather sleep on the floor than share a room with any of those Slytherin gits,” Ron was one of the many students to be moaning about the sudden change in rooming arrangements.
"Harry, could you show Draco a thing or two about cleaning up the fireplace?" Draco glared at Pansy with a roll of his eyes.
The stranger let out a huffed laugh and nodded his head, "I suppose you could say so, Coeurs Dansent is my favorite yet."
"I'm glad, I poured the most soul and effort into it, enslaving my mind for what? A year and a half?" He answered himself and picked his book back up.
"You're brilliant," Harry stammered out, "I mean, i-it's brilliant. Your writing is brilliant. Violet and Santiago and Brute and the old man are all brilliant." Both Malfoy and Harry had flushed at the words he couldn't stop himself from blabbering out madly.
"Ooh, he retaliates," Pansy chuckled and bent down to where Ron had been scrubbing and with a wave of her wand, the floor was cleaned in an instant.
Harry had flipped through many pages, skipping a few pages here and there until he'd reach his very recent dreams. He could imagine back to when he'd study Draco when he was writing before drifting to sleep. Never did he think Draco would be writing down their shared dream that night.
Harry snaked his arms around the blonde's waist from behind, letting his head lean on his shoulder blade. He hummed softly, hoping to calm the other of whatever paranoid thoughts he was having.
"Tonight for me?" Harry held a hand upon Draco's shoulder. Harry's patience was running out and he was too curious as to how Draco even obtained such a book.
"Pansy's workin' me harder than my mum does," Harry cracked a soft laugh with Ron and they chatted for a while when Draco got up to help Pansy who didn't even seem in the slightest exhausted.
Like an excited dog, Harry seated himself on Draco's bed and waited for Draco to bring the book over.
Harry got up from his bed and stalked his way over to Malfoy, bending down over Malfoy's shoulder, his breath was hot and sent a shiver down the blonde's spine.
came with me." Harry smiled and layed down now on the comfy bed, taking in all of the Slytherin's scent which was now bleeded into the sheets.
Pansy had let Draco lean into her side for the duration of McGonagall's speech and provided him with comforting strokes through his hair.
The two had passed out on the sofa, the wine had been spilled and they were both still half-naked with their clothes thrown across the floor.
They had settled that tomorrow they would take off to visit the Malfoy Manor and possibly stay the week there if his mother would allow it. Merlin knows Draco's father would be having a meltdown if he'd knew Harry Potter would be staying at
Draco's arm had begun to snake up and down Potter's sides, stroking carefully at first, but he aimed for aggression in the end. He could hear Harry's heart speed up with his touch, it was almost magical to him.
Draco himself looked a lot better in the warm candle lighting in contrast from earlier when he looked deathly pale.
"I can only assume the great majority and vital places of Hogwarts will be completely restored a week prior to the new school year." She paused.
Harry had heard that since Malfoy's mother's passing, he had been given the full heritage of the Manor and had at one point thought of visiting.
Harry thanked her and she soon left, Harry forgetting to ask why she had even stopped by besides letting him know she'd seen his owl fly out as normal.
When Harry had reached the last page he'd seen the bits and remains of the last page torn out. He frowned, pulling the page out of his pocket to layout over its missing pieces. "Why did you rip this one out?" He felt confused and was too scared to even bother to reread the last page to himself again.
"Do you want a glass?" He sipped down the drink, letting it relax his nerves that Harry seemed to be stirring up.
Harry revealed the bouquet of roses in front of him, closing his eyes tight he cleared his throat before speaking.
inviting him to tag along. If you would have told Harry he'd have shagged Malfoy then gone to see his sickly mother with him in the Malfoy Manor all in the same week that summer, he would have thought you'd been insane.
Clothes removed aggressively, two naked boys collapsed onto the bed, rutting against each other like horny dogs.
"I've spent far longer studying spells for things like this than you," She bit into the chocolate, "I don't think you're suited enough to be able to handle spells like that," She joked with a hushed laugh.
He held two fingers up to Draco's mouth, seeing as they hadn't any lube around and he would definitely have to look into lubing charms later.
Draco whined out as Harry trailed his kisses up to the base of Draco's hardened cock. Running his tongue up and down the shaft, he dipped into the slit when he felt Draco lightly buck up. He didn't know how experienced Draco really was and wasn't sure if the dreams had really counted.
It was nearly time to leave when he quickly gathered his belongings and flood as quickly as he could to the Malfoy Manor's drawing-room as the day before.
Draco looked so fucking gorgeous to Harry, all he wanted to do was making sweet love right then and there but he didn't want to make it unenjoyable for Draco, so he took his sweet time scissoring the tight hole.
"I wouldn't see why not," He wondered if only a certain portion of students had been selected for their house or year. That could explain why Ginny didn't get a letter.
"Would you. . like to come over and read in my room of La Gaudière with me?" The stranger had trouble getting out.
Harry had awoken to his body unable to rest anymore, he had dreamed about the book he was reading with Malfoy but somehow he and Draco had been put into the story itself.
A sense of Nostalgia had hit him and he grinned looking about. He already knew what he'd be needing since it was practically all the same every year.
Draco leaned into Harry's warming chest, burying his face in the soft fabric. Harry furiously blushed at the sight of Malfoy collapsing against him and his magical touch; Harry would be mad if he said he wasn't extremely turned on by Draco in such a vulnerable state.
"Have too, get dressed we're going to visit Hagrid with Hermoine in a bit," Harry's eyes lit up at the mention of Hagrid.
A good handful of students were chatting outside on the steps near the entrance. Some he'd recognized, and some he wasn't so sure of.
Not that returning to Hogwarts would solve these frequent dreams of his, but at least he could attempt one thing he'd been longing for over the last few months since he'd last seen Malfoy in the Death Eater trials.
Harry had hundreds of letters crumpled up or stashed away in his desk, all written for the Slytherin's eyes to read, but he'd never sent them. Even without an owl, he'd been deathly afraid of Malfoy's judgment.
"Early enough to leave for Diagon Alley," Draco sighed and threw his head back into the pillow. "You're going to just leave me now?"
"I think you being there will be a good enough gift to her," Harry didn't really know if that was true or not but he wanted to calm Draco's nerves and gave the blonde a warm smile.
Harry could see Draco's soul, deep in his eyes, luna had once told him that the eyes show the strength of someone's soul. He'd definitely tried to read people's eyes before but Malfoy's were really something. One eye screamed hurt, confused, and emotional. The other was a mask much like the one he showed as a kid, rude, blunt and self-centered.
Just then several footsteps had erupted through the common room catching both of their attentions. Several hushed and mumbled voices were heard, chattering amongst themselves, very unSlytherin-like. Pansy quickly got up to peer out towards the common room and her mouth went agape at the sight. Draco's stomach dropped as he knew what was happening, he knew that the plan had already started to take place and form.
"Late Potter, I've been awaiting you all morning," Malfoy scoffed, taking his coat and making his way to their reading room.
They melted into each other, Draco wrapping his arms around in Harry's untamed hair, and Harry moving his free hand to dip just below Draco's hip, cupping and squeezing his ass.
"Have you?" He thought about how long he and Malfoy would be reading it together before they finished, or before Malfoy got too buzzed to continue.
Harry lit up with excitement, "Yes, yes? Really? I don't even know you but yes, no one knows La Gaudière as I do and they never listen to me," Harry stopped himself from rambling.
"Potter, I must tell you that when anyone but the author reads from here..." He muttered, "The things written in here can bend into reality, please be careful." He handed the book back over to Harry who almost felt unsure if he should even read it at all thinking back to when he got the bite.
"Draco, my boy, you finally came to visit your dear old mother," She let out a soft laugh and opened her arms to embrace Draco.
Harry followed with a soft chuckle and wrapped an arm around Draco's body, snuggling close to smell the cologne Draco had still faintly on. "Talk later Draco, I need to enjoy this while I can," Draco huffed in response and adjusted himself more comfortably.
"Draco Malfoy is not getting another glass of wine, isn't it making you sleepy?" Draco looped an arm over Harry's shoulder and sighed heavily into Harry's ear.
Harry had gone down with Ron to the Great Hall where everyone seemed to be gathered around helping with whatever he could. Luckily everyone was already almost finished with the halls surrounding the Great Hall itself which was already restored.
His head was racing with thoughts and confusion. Over and over the scene at Borgin & Burkes replayed in his head.
"Hey.." A slightly worried Pansy had slowly allowed herself into the room, inching towards her friend.
"If I hear you've done anything to Draco I'll have your head Potter, I've got my eyes on you," She spoke venomously and pulled back.
The Gryffindor common room seemed to be missing. The paintings that once decored the wall were torn and the color had been sucked from them.
The best part of heading back from Hogsmeade, besides when they'd get back to the dormitory, was the way Draco looked up at the stars. Harry would have loved to capture that moment and save it for later if Draco hadn't stopped since he'd notice Harry staring at him.
His legs had begun to grow jello-like, he struggled to hold them both up and released a warm sigh into the blonde locks. "Potter. . ." Draco had purred into his chest, he wasn't going easy on Harry.
Harry had almost forgotten about the paper in his pocket and eagerly ripped it out, unfolding it carefully to smooth it out.
"Is that such a bad thing considering what you've done?" Harry almost gasped from what he'd said. He didn't actually think poorly of Malfoy anymore or suspect him of any more wrongdoings, but all the negative talk of the Malfoy family over the summer had really gotten to his brain.
"I know, I'm having terrible flashbacks to the Yule Ball," He cringed at the thought of his younger self 'dancing' with one of the poor Patil twins. Draco huffed a laugh along with Harry remembering back to Pansy, reminding himself he needed to owl her soon before she would come over to his place by force and curse him into oblivion and back.
Being an Auror wasn't all that bad for Harry. He quite enjoyed being surrounded by his friends and paperwork gave him time to sneak in a few reads every now and then.
After trailing his eyes over Malfoy's sleeping figure he looked over to his desk. A large book was left open which seemed to be blank.
With access to the new house room, everyone stepped inside anxiously. It was very bare but layed out very differently than any other house common room Harry had ever seen.
"Now there have been some adjustments made for the eighth-year students. Seeing as the remaining houses have no room for an extra year of students, it has been decided all eighth-year witches and wizards will join in unity as one household." McGonagall presented a new dormitory entrance for all eighth-years to witness.
There was no way he was going to sleep if he didn't assure his brain that these questions would be remembered to be asked tomorrow.
Harry Potter wrapped himself in his invisibility cloak carefully. He did not want to smush the bouquet of roses he had with him.
A worried Snape and McGonagall stepped into the crowd of students, wavering over them with their height. Dumbledore nodded towards the professors and cleared the room with a loud silence.
"Yea, right, that's why I can hear you moaning out his name in your sleep from down the hall." He began to clench his stomach as he couldn't stop from laughing.
"Where do you figure everyone's went out to?" He opened his own room to reveal it empty of Longbottom.
Ron huffed and walked over towards her and with a wave of his wand the curtain began to stitch itself back to health.
His thoughts began to trail off to Malfoy alone, and the idea that he might be able to watch him closely without his friends' help.
Why had Malfoy even invited Harry to his Manor anyways? How could he even trust Harry with his identity? Questions continued to flood his mind as he quickly grabbed a sheet of parchment to scribble down on.
"He's in the last room down the hall, to the left," She smiled with evil behind her eyes. She could really be scary sometimes.
Harry wouldn't mind his lunch breaks or any breaks he got at all. Any free time he had was all focused on reading and reading and reading. All he ever did was read and study and research.
His feathered kisses had trailed up from Draco's wrist to his dark mark, which Draco had instinctively pulled away from. "Sorry," He mumbled. He left lingering kisses all around and eventually on top of the mark. So many beautiful places on Draco that he had yet to really explore.
"I was wondering if you'd know where Malfoy was.." It sounded weird to be asking this, Pansy surely would suspect it.
Harry shrugged and sat down beside Neville who seemed to be studying his wand as if he'd never seen it before. Harry would have to remember later to cast a
Harry turned his attention back to Malfoy whose face had relaxed now, his eyes batting around the disheveled room they were about to spend the next few hours in. The blonde ran his fingers through his hair now catching Harry staring at him for more than a second. Harry half expected Malfoy to spit something else out to get onto his nerves, but nothing ever left the blonde's lips.
"Harry you need to stop thinking so loud, honestly," Hermione sighed to herself. Her arms crossed as she also was staring off out the window. Ron had fallen fast asleep, clutching his own excess luggage like a pillow.
"I don't mind at all," He glanced at her outfit which was always a work of art, very odd but very pleasant choice in fashion. Reminded him of Malfoy and his choice in clothing.
"So she is," He turned away from Harry quickly. "No hard feelings towards my mother though, she really was a lovely woman and mother to me."
His lips drooled of pleasure and bliss. Images of Harry pooled around in his mind. He couldn't help but let a soft moan escape him when he envisioned Harry's hand instead of his. Pumping his dick with his beastly hands, whispering sweet nothings into his ear and driving him mad.
"They're just potion books I found while cleaning," Malfoy avoided Harry's burning eyes that seemed superior. This wasn't like Malfoy at all.
"Very heroic, very self-centered. The boy who had everything, but nothing." Malfoy put on his thickest English accent and gestured to Harry with a smirk.
The room was already decored very nicely and already resembled the original house's rooms but with two large queen-sized beds.
It didn't help him, his friends, and Draco would all be together in the pub. Probably be filling the air with some sort of awkward tension.
He got up and quickly closed the shades to relieve Draco of any future headache and further groaning.
Draco peeked out over at what Harry was talking about and sighed, "I figured you'd wake up with a throbbing pain not actually there and investigate it, find even possible traces of magic from this book, I don't really know." He took the page from Harry's hand gently to read it over.
"Excuse me while I visit the toilet," Harry breathed out quickly as he shuffled out of his train cubby. The hall was filled with conversating students who paid no mind to Harry as he carefully slipped on his invisibility cloak.
"Goodnight Malfoy," Harry hummed and sat back down on his own bed, feeling himself begin to drift off.
Harry was unsure if Drack was on good terms with what was left of his family. Curious, Harry would ask him about it when he got to his room.
The question came out more like a statement but Harry just shrugged his shoulders while setting away his last quill.
A shuffling could be heard approaching the room, drawing the attention of Harry and Draco to whoever was about to enter.
"I tried to call out for Malfoy but soon I felt my body start to burn and... There were these younger years who thought it'd be funny to pick on a mudblood."
Harry hummed happily while letting his fingers stroke up and down the small of Draco's back, slipping under his sweater to feel his hot pulsing skin. The blonde purred into Harry's ear seductively at the touch.
Ron groaned knowing he'd have to go all the way back up to the 7th floor. They'd made their way back up and towards the room of requirement sluggishly, complaining to each other on the way there.
Harry grumbled but got up to be met with a cup of tea from Ron with a smile. "Thanks," He mumbled out with a sip.
"I figured you'd pissed on it Weasley," Pansy had paid the Golden Boys a visit from across the room with a smug look.
"Muggle technology, brilliant isn't it?" Draco offered a hand towards Harry to get up into the open space with him.
Getting back up and fumbling to his desk in the dark, he pulled out a book with a letter plastered to the inside of it. Quickly, he tugged at his lamp he rarely used and relit the room, lining up both note to letter.
Harry quickly got up and left the room in a hurry. Turning around next to the door he picked up a quill and wrote off his name next to Draco's on the piece of parchment.
Draco hungrily began to suck and lick in the crook of Harry's neck, purring against his skin, Harry flushed with excitement and gripped onto Malfoy's hips and ass.
His room was a mess Harry had never expected from such a properly dressed prat, nonetheless, Harry carefully carried Malfoy over to his bed and layed him down to sink into his covers.
He looked out from the slit of his curtain and realized Malfoy must have moved to his bed and got up.
Slowly, however, Harry uncovered and wrapped the cloak up in his hand. His cheeks flushed with the embarrassment of being caught by Malfoy of all people. Harry thought about starting a fight with Malfoy, telling him about what he had seen earlier and what he suspected of the potential death eater.
"H-harry~" Draco moaned sharply when Harry began to use his free hand to twist the other nipple. Harry's first name on Draco's tongue sent shivers down Harry's spine, only motivating him to stir Draco up more.
"You're even better in real life Potter, how is that even possible?" Draco had caught his breath but felt himself grow drowsy.
The three of them had to move on from the creature and continued to explore the shops they needed to, collecting books, quills, and everything in between.
Harry admired Draco in such a vulnerable pose and bent down to fully begin to thrust in and out, earning soft whimpers from the smaller.
The sun rays that leaked into their room, bouncing off their bodies as they danced together to the beautiful song that seemed to have lasted forever.
While Harry was thankful the Weasleys even let him stay with them, he always felt like a bother and especially unwanted by Ginny herself.
A rush of excitement tickled his nerves as he realized what he'd done. He was definitely going to get a fussy Ron for the next week from this.
"Ah Harry Potter, how are you? Looking for an owl I see?" The man turned away from the lady to give Harry his full attention. Narcissa turned to Harry with a tense look.
Harry eyed Malfoy up and down, he was particularly dressed well tonight, Harry only wished to make a mess of right now.
"How about I show you?" N0ot much of a question, Malfoy nodded while he let Harry pick him up by his legs as he layed his back on the sofa.
Harry nodded, unapologetically staring down Malfoy's adorable vulnerable state. Harry lightly wondered if he had always had a sort of attraction to the Slytherin but pushed the thought down when he returned to the drawing-room to floo back home.
Harry frowned, was he just saying that? The stranger grabbed his cup of tea and took a long lengthy sip, it was steaming up his glasses.
"I didn't intend for it to end like this," He let go of Potter to get up and over to the sink, letting the water fill the cup in his hands so he could wash his face off.
The halls were lively now with students leaving the great halls to attend to their morning classes or unpack in their dorms.
"A little bird told me to come here," she looked around as if the bird was flying about in the space they shared.
As if the Malfoy had read his mind he spoke softly while flipping open his own book, "We can start from the beginning if you don't mind."
"Look Harry, there's more students," Ron pointed forwards as they finally arrived at the entrance of Hogwarts.
Draco had buried his hands in his face beside Harry, not wanting to see how Harry was reacting to his cursed writing.
He inched closer to the mirrored image and inspected the wound which was still bleeding, dripping down his neck onto his robes.
"Sorry Malfoy, I don't work from home," Harry murmured as he followed the less welcoming Malfoy. He definitely seemed more uptight and stiffened than yesterday but made sure to let Harry know he had been missing him all morning, fixing him up a cup of tea without asking.
Harry had switched his bottoms and slugged his way to the kitchen, the smell of cooked eggs drawing him closer.
His heart fell at the words. He had read an interview with La Gaudière where she mentioned that her mother had recently passed which had almost held her career on hold. She instead used that pain to write this. Harry wondered if the writing in this book would differ from her others.
"Hold on you're going to make a mess if you drag it off," Harry offered his assistance while Draco struggled to hold the large piece of wood on his own.
"Listen Harry, I knew you were obsessed with Malfoy but I didn't think you could actually stand to sleep in the same room as him, you're insane." He wiped the tears from his eyes.
Draco released a long moan before quickly casting a cleaning spell and scurrying away from Harry's view.
"Harry, reading with you is — so fun, please keep doing it with me. . . Come back tomorrow will you?" Harry chuckled lightly.
"Everything I've ever wanted to do Malfoy," He let his hands grab at Draco's ass, earning a hushed whine which pleased Harry.
Thankfully summer was just about over and he could return to Hogwarts for his last year, officially.
"Alright there mate? We're in no rush," Ron huffed as Harry had bolted from his room, almost splashing the cup of tea up all over himself. Harry flushed and nodded.
"How far do you want to go with this, Draco?" He'd reach back up to Draco's face to whisper seductively to the other. Draco released a hot breath and closed his eyes tight. "All the way Harry, I'm done waiting."
The room still dark, he could hear muffled cries much like the ones in his dream, he got up carefully. He approached Draco's bed and pulled back a curtain to reveal a balled-up, sleeping Draco.
Malfoy hadn't even let Potter flip to the page they had left off on before he started reading with low vibration to his voice. It sounded as if he had just woken up or rather hadn't gotten a lot of sleep seeing as it quickly roughened up.
Draco had slid it right out of the cover to place atop of the inside squared box and pressed a needle thing down.
Retracting his fingers from Draco's mouth, he brought the saliva-coated flesh to Draco's rim and pressed hard. "
Harry felt relieved and cast his own cleaning spell before covering himself again and feeling a wave of exhaustion wash over him.
"I just want to really appreciate what I'm looking at," Harry kissed down on the sensitive skin now exposed from the briefs. He'd feel Draco's tighs up and down, soft as he'd imagine them to be, but they shook with every gentle touch.
The steps up to Dumbledore’s office were rather large and waxed, the air between the friends was tainted with a thick shared silence. The sounds of their shoes clamping against the waxed steps echoed through the walk-up.
He blushed at the thought of going even further with Draco and had to snap his thoughts away when he heard McGonagall come in with a frail smile on her face.
. Harry always admired the handwriting. Name always punctuated with a curly and very distinct heart shape that Harry deeply found charming.
Harry had enough, taking his own hands to feel Draco up and down, dipping his head in to capture Draco in more kisses, setting his glass of wine down on a nearby counter.
Harry bent down and tenderly places kiss along the river trailed scars, marking them as beautiful rather than mistakes he'd made. He hadn't known when but Draco had knotted his fingers through his hair, it seemed he rather enjoyed that not just in their dreams.
"Draco," Harry groaned out, tilting his head down to rest against Draco's, their breaths exchanged and Harry began to lick at the wet and pretty lips of Draco's.
"I adore her son, is that weird to say about a person you created?" Draco thought aloud while tapping the side of his drink.
"Yes — yes Potter," Draco stuttered out as he wrapped his arms tightly around Harry, hungry to feel him.
Harry might've stayed there next to him for hours, or maybe just minutes. But he felt a sense of comfort between them there and watched in awe as Draco slept calmly after that.
"Harry put that book down please — You never listen to me do you?" Hermione sighed in defeat as Harry looked up shamefully.
Harry blushed for a moment, "I suppose... yes, I wanted to make sure he was on good terms with you--I thought it would benefit his health to do so," He sweated, careful with his wording.
" With a press of his wand to the creased pages, everything was revealed. What a stupidly easy charm he probably could have guessed this whole time.
Harry chuckled and grabbed his wand, making sure to use a cleaning spell before he felt sure he could get comfortable with Draco in bed.
Draco assumed this was because he'd been saved by Potter from being sent to Azkaban but didn't really know for sure.
The grey-bearded wizard walked with them down the hall towards the staircase. Large groups of Gryffindor students were huddled around the fat lady’s painting that seemed to be unoccupied.
"Ah did she? I suppose maybe later then," Hagrid shut the door on the three, all just as confused as the other.
Harry sat down on the cushioned seat, inches apart from this person who radiated heat off like an oven.
"Don't cry, it's alright," He shushed the blonde, hoping he could speak to his sleeping self and get it to calm.
“Are you sure you went the right way? Did you perhaps get lost?” Dumbledore began to move closer to the children.
"What business would you two have to be still on the train?" Snape sneered, looking back and forth between the two.
"Bloody floor still looks like it's covered in urine," Ron huffed as he continued to scrub the same spot over and over with both a sponge and whatever cleaning spell he could test on it.
"Morning you three, how's it?" Hagrid had let the three in. The place had once been burnt to the ground but you really couldn't even tell that now. It was a lot cleaner and bare, but mostly because Hagrid's personal belongings had been engulfed in the flames.
Draco's hot tongue, swiveling around Harry's fingers felt heavenly. Such a pretty sight it was to Harry, he'd almost finger fuck him orally if his cock wasn't so hard now.
"Yes, It was very good Harry," Luna pushed her hair back. "I won't spoil anything seeing as you're not very far in."
, I've come to find those charming," He assured Harry who'd ghost his fingers over them, creating tingling sensations in Draco.
"Right, sure," Harry walked over to where Malfoy crouched, pushing away ashy pieces of wood that chalked up the floor with awful marks to clean up.
Harry's first reaction was confusion but he proceeded to reread it over and over and over to fully understand what it was.
Clearing out the students surrounding the wall, Dumbledore quickly pulled off and set down the paintings to the side to run his hands across the now naked wall.
"You thought I was a girl and were disappointed when you found otherwise, too embarrassed you went along with it didn't you?" He sighed to himself.
He didn't particularly look how Hermoine described him, but to be fair he'd only studied Malfoy's face in his erotic dream.
It couldn't be possible though . . . Harry had always thought La Gaudière was a female from how feminine everything she — he wrote, portrayed, and presented to Harry and his audience.
if they'd like to go to Hogsmeade with us later," Pansy smirked, now taking all of Draco's books in her hands.
Harry's hot and wet tongue hadn't hesitated and licked around the tip of the blonde's sensitive cock, catching Draco off-guard as he sucked in a quick breath. Draco had continued to mumble out curse words towards Harry while grabbing and gripping at his hair, eager to plunge him down and face fuck him balls deep already.
They'd have some time to relax and watch Pansy and Ron struggle to work together, muffling their laughs to each other.
"Draco come for me?" He breathed into the other's. Draco could only nod, unable to get any words out other than the sweet taste of Harry on his tongue.
Thankfully it didn't take Draco long to reach his climax after Harry did and spilled into Harry's warm hand, going limp as well under Harry.
He could take in the grey bulbs that concerned for him. The stranger held his book out to Harry, taking the bookmark from his spot, Harry looked down at his own book.
Harry didn't know what to expect,  but what he didn't expect was for Draco to simply walk out of the bathroom, and out the room.
"Should I bring flowers? A gift? Money perhaps? I don't think I can afford that right now.." Draco began to mumble to himself in the mirror.
Harry bobbed his head up and down, letting his mouth fill and choke on Draco, he couldn't stop himself.
"I suppose we should go back to finish the room of requirement, Pansy will be an arse about it later if we don't by the time she's back," Harry agreed, making sure to dump off his tea on the way back to the castle.
The figure had turned around at his desk, his face sulked in the orange light that barely lit the room.
"With that being said, starting tomorrow, each house of students will go out to Diagon Alley to assemble their school supplies." Parts of the room let out a soft applause and shortly were released for the night.
"Yea lets just go, I've been itching to get out of this stuffy place," He looked around with a frown. The place would definitely need some improvement to feel homier.
"Fine," Malfoy hissed out before turning towards where the dungeons would be, leaving Potter to himself now.
Malfoy let out a light laugh. "You don't know anything about me Potter, don't say things you don't mean," Malfoy flicked his wand out towards the direction Harry was in, another miss.
Even when he was looking over the documents, dipping his quill in and out of the jar of ink, scratching and scribbling what needed to be did and done; Harry's mind was elsewhere, still deep in the book he possessed on his lap that he felt too protective over.
He hadn't even asked Malfoy if it was alright to come over so early after work but was met with an answer.
"This is my favorite disk," Malfoy hummed, leaning closer to Potter's ear who melted into the blonde's touch.
Ron pouted, "My feelings..." Before embracing Hermoine with a fit of laughter shared between the two.
While it wasn't anywhere near the Great Hall he'd seen it as the only thing left on a checklist someone made of rooms in need of restoration.
Harry nodded to Slughorn on his way out with Malfoy, keeping a distance from the Slytherin at first but then noticing the weird way Malfoy was walking and approached him.
"Shit-" Harry jolted, feeling a violent and throbbing pain in the side of his neck. He placed a hand over the sudden pained spot, drawing his hand back he was met with a glistening, reddened substance covering his fingers.
Harry's and Draco's relationship was odd but they seemed to have adjusted to becoming a little more than friends at this point. Draco opened up to Harry that night about something as personal as his mother and
"God Potter I cannot believe I'm even showing you this," Draco mumbled out, turning open to the first page. "
"Shit, shit shit shiiiit — " He quickened his pace to dance around the room grabbing his coat, gloves, socks, and shoes. He had almost forgotten to put a shirt on so he just pulled on a loose robe he found on the floor.
Harry scoffed, grabbing his clothes. "You're being serious?" Harry frowned just thinking Draco could be grumpy from being awoken so early.
Draco's pale neck was now tinted in soft pink. Swiftly turning away from Harry, he closed the book and slumped over on his bed, pulling the bed curtains shut.
"Stop, stop, Potter--Stop you prat! I'm up, I'm up!" He swatted Harry's hand away, calming from his laughter high.
Everyone seemed to really be caught up in a debate between Ron and Hermoine that had broken out but Harry would only use this distraction to press even closer to Draco's side.
The expressions Draco gave reminded him of the ones he gave Harry in his dreams, beautiful and broken. Saliva had still glossed over Draco's swollen and red mouth, the sight made Harry release a low groan and motivated him to thrust harder and faster.
The room of requirement had spent them the entire day to clean up, plus they'd have to come back tomorrow to get the door and the magic in it replaced for it to actually be able to function correctly.
Harry released his grip from Malfoy and nodded, thanking Draco for going back to pour him a glass. He hummed into the glass of wine, reminding himself to only have a glass of it and not a whole bottle like Draco had liked to do regularly.
"And thou shall hand me thy bloody fine wine . . ." Draco slurred reaching for his empty glass once more to get the last drop out of it.
Draco was crying in his sleep it seemed, tears were leaking down his face and he was letting out small sobs.
"I'm starting to think you're not actually that bad Weasley," She looked back at Harry realizing he felt out of place.
"Oh and Harry, Ron, you both received a letter earlier I almost forgot about." Molly got up to search for what she was looking for before pulling out two separate letters.
, don't ignore me," Draco spat at him with a quick glance. Harry turned away, afraid of letting Draco know he'd gotten into his bloody bin and uncovered what felt like a shared dirty secret between them.
"Come on, up we go," Harry hoisted the blonde up, arm still draped over Harry to lean most of his heavy feeling body onto the other.
"Draco... why? I'd expect that of your father but your mother?" Harry didn't intend to shame Draco but quickly realized that's what he'd basically done.
The blond sucked in a deep breath before collapsing onto his bed. No one was in the bedrooms so he was free to relax for the moment and release any built-up emotion.
Harry thought he'd been caught watching, but Draco soon returned with pants and sat at his desk to reopen a book and scribble down in it.
Draco sat up with a sly grin on his face, drool dripping down his chin, and chest puffed to expose his half-naked chest.
Malfoy bent down, lazily glossing his eyes over the two worn-out books. Oddly, they both seemed a little different than the rest, they almost seemed to be once strapped together with string but have separated upon falling to the floor. He set them both on the counter, separate from the others, and continued pulling stuff from the cabinet.
"Sod-off Potter," Harry leaned closer to rest his head on Malfoy's shoulder who only seemed to flinch at the touch.
was, Ron was too busy stuffing his face like an absolute hog to notice your absence,” Hermione shot a glare towards the ginger whose face scrunched in retaliation. “I did notice thank you, I know Harry can handle himself away from us for more than 5 minutes,” Ron shrugged to Harry who didn't seem to care if they missed him or not. This conversation seemed pointless anyway.
You'd think he was researching something important or studying up on something to help with his cases, but that would not be the case.
"Harry? Harry! Where have you been? We've been looking for you everywhere!" Harry turned towards the voice to see Hermione and Ron standing at the end of the hall, out of breath.
Ron grinned as he gave Hermoine a long hug and a peck on the lips before Hermoine turned to greet Harry with a friendly hug.
Morning had awoken the two who had passed out respectively in their own beds, Harry was still unsure how far he could go with Draco even though he had shagged the poor blonde.
"You look like you've been attacked by a werewolf Potter, what happened?" Harry perked up and the mention of him and smirked over at Draco who looked panicked.
Where was she? He looked around desperately near where they'd seen the lovely owl from earlier. He spotted her moved down a ways and desperately made his way over.
Malfoy had ignored his question and walked back over to the box to pull out a slim, large round object, encased in a colorful circular cover.
"S-so sappy P-Potter — stop talking nonsens—" Draco felt Harry dip down again this time his tip hitting the back of Harry's throat, he let out a gasp while arching his body up into Potter's.
"He knew it was me . . he knew it was me and he said nothing . . ." Harry sat down on his bed and cupped his face.
The train ride to Hogwarts was beyond uncomfortable for Harry, Malfoy seemed to keep quiet the entire time, occasionally giving his input on something Blaise would ask about. Malfoy had also left to the washroom for a moment, Harry now able to move about to a better position that seemed to go unoccupied for the entire ride.
"Did she mention what house will go out tomorrow?" Ron fumbled out of his seat while Harry shrugged.
Ron shook his head, "She's just running late." Pansy smiled while picking her fork around her salad. Harry didn't seem very hungry and neither did Ron since they'd had a snack before coming.
"Right, I'm serious about those papers though, you've been late on them and Lentulus is getting on my arse about it," She tucked in her hair before making her leave.
The dark-haired man turned to the boys with a scowl heavy on his face as they had suddenly stopped in front of the potions classroom.
"Merlin... Malfoy," He paused his whisper and used his free hand to place it upon Draco's cheek to wipe the tears.
Malfoy hummed while grabbing out a couple of glasses, "I do, but I like to go around the Manor for inspiration." He gleamed to Harry, trusting him with such fond knowledge.
Malfoy was lightly snoring away on his bed with his curtains opened, letting Harry's eyes wander for just a little too long.
Harry tried to remain friendly but Ginny has been ignoring him all summer and it felt like hell when they ran into each other.
Harry looked between his book and Malfoy's before relaxing his posture and attitude. "We can just take one then if that's all we'll need," Malfoy rolled his eyes, now regaining some of himself back.
"I hope the trip wasn't rough, its really been a pain in the arse trying to reopen the floo network to here," He opened a hand to take Harry's coat.
Harry gently cupped Draco's tense jaw, "I've been wanting to make these dreams a reality actually," He breathed, holding a long and competitive stare. Draco swallowed hard and closed his eyes, warm salty tears ran down his cheeks to which Harry's thumb wiped away.
Not long after they arrived, considerably late to the sorting ceremony that is, they passed through one of the many entrances into the school and Harry's eyes landed on a familiar face. Light locks bounced around as Luna seemed to be having a conversation with Neville about something particularly funny. Luna then caught hold of Harry's eyes as if he had called out to her, they shared a friendly grin but Snape quickly guided them down the halls. Harry reminded himself to find Luna later to catch up on their letters they had shared over the break.
"Sounds very Malfoyish if you ask me," He paused to consider his choice in words, "It's actually my favorite but I'm starting to really like this one," He pointed to the cover of the book they were reading.
"You're not selfish, I may not completely understand your reasoning but you're concerned for your mother which is what a good son does," he laid a hand over Draco's, "What if you went to go see her now with someone? Would that make you feel better?"
Draco nodded, breaking out of Harry's touch as he left Harry to wait in the restroom. He'd leave a few minutes later to make it not seem as weird for Draco's sake.
“Pretty sure that was more than just 5 minutes,” Hermione’s attention was paused when she caught sight of the staircase. "That's odd," Hermione approached where their once common room was. "Did we take a wrong turn?" Ron mumbled, just as confused as Hermione.
Draco wiped the corner of his eye away, "I'm scared to see her face, I don't want her to die Potter but, what can I do? Seeing her will only upset me more, it's so selfish of me really." Harry hadn't expected Draco to have come out with this so easily but in a way, it made Harry silently happy as if he was furthering their relationship.
"I didn't think you'd want me to continue them," He paused, "You can keep it but please don't use it for stupid things." Harry laughed lightly and brushed his hand over Draco's jaw. He wasn't sure how far he could go without upsetting Draco but he figured it would be okay if Draco had written these things.
"Bloody hell Harry- Can't you let a man get his beauty sleep..?" Ron Mumbled before reaching for his covers.
Everything from last night had come back to Harry in an instant and he instinctively looked over towards Malfoy's bed, he wasn't there.
Only until he heard the sound of a door opening and light footsteps did he awake from his trance to look up in the search for whoever was disturbing him.
Harry collapsed onto the side of Draco, unable to even pick up his wand to clean themselves, to which Draco had to do.
"Ahah- F-Fuck," Draco's words sputtered out as Harry's large hot cock had slowly been pushed halfway in. At first, the pain was so hot and burned, Draco thought his whole ass had been ripped in half but when Harry had finally stopped to rest, balls deep inside Draco, he calmed at the pressure.
"Sorry I got lost!" Harry called back, walking towards his friends, the book clutched to the side of him protectively.
Harry was up quite early compared to Draco who was sleeping away peacefully in his arms. Careful not to wake the other, he slid out of the bed and over to his own bed. He got ready quickly since he would have to leave for Diagon Alley early.
“It seems that the Gryffindor tower has been cursed,” He ran his hands through his long faded locks.
Harry hadn't thought of that, nor did he want to imagine feeling sympathy for Malfoy. "Maybe you're right Luna."
The two boys refused to look at each other and followed behind the elder teacher to the gates of the school. It was cold out, very much contrasting how it was just hours previously. The wind was blowing through their locks, Harry could have sworn he felt a drop of rain but he wasn't sure after a while.
"No Potter, whatever you stole from me was a mistake, shouldn't have been seen by anyone, let alone you."
Harry admired the sleepy Slytherin and turned back to comb through his messy hair. He didn't need to take anything with him, maybe his wand but now he was a bit too early. Harry got a brilliant idea and left the room without a word.
"Anyways, I gave him a look up and down and he seemed almost sickly... His hair was in a mess and he had a swollen eye,"
By the time the train had reached its destination, Malfoy had returned, carefully grabbing his luggage and trailing behind his friends while Harry followed behind slowly.
Malfoy was pulling out potion books that seemed to vary in size and shape, sorting them into a pile until he had the whole cabinet cleared.
Harry shoved his wand in his pocket and let his legs carry him over to where Malfoy was hiding, jumping straight onto the blonde who almost screamed out in terror. Malfoy definitely did not expect such a move from Harry and his wand was knocked from his hand, now rolling across the floor of the train.
The bright and warming sun had shone through the window to rest on Draco, awakening him before Harry. He got up quickly and covered himself with the clothes he could find; attempting to clean up the wine mess at that, he heard Harry groan and toss himself over to blink his eyes open.
"Hey, it's alright," The stranger rested a hand on Harry's knee, "If it bothers you so much you could take my copy, clean as a newborn's arse it is." Harry paused his movement and looked up.
"Ron's going to end up fat honestly," Hermoine puffed, giving Ron a judgmental stare while he was shoving food down his throat.
Harry looked to Hermione for her input when she just released a long-held breath, “It’s not a big deal, we should be more concerned about the cursed common room."
It was just a minute away from a new day, and even if Draco was up at such an ungodly hour, he busied away with his studies without care.
"Been a while hasn't it?" Hermoine admitted. She was right, they both hadn't seen her for about a month but still kept in touch through the Wealsey owl.
He cautiously set the second cup of tea down on Draco's side table when he felt a hand snake up his arm.
"Finally, you both took forever," A familiar voice made Ron and Harry turn to be met with a dramatic Hermoine.
He took out a scratch piece of paper and a loose pen, scribbling down something Harry watched closely.
"You love me Malfoy," Harry leaned down, breath hovering over the body of Draco's that was soon stripped open like a book. He looked a beautiful mess, exchanging hot and heavy breaths, Harry had undone his buckle to reveal a perky bulge, restrained under clothing.
Harry turned to find his usual seat, a quiet place in the corner of the building with a large window to look out into the busy street with.
"He wouldn't do that for me, he'd probably be embarrassed to be seen aiding me," Draco wished this conversation to be over with, any talk about Harry Potter or the Death Eaters made him feel simply ill.
After it had been getting late, McGonagall had gathered everyone to the Great Hall for a celebration dinner.
"So beautiful underneath me like this, you're gorgeous Draco," He repeated praises to Draco which made the smaller's face heat up and turn red. He tried to hide the side of his face in the pillow under him but Harry only continued to embarrass the blonde.
Harry had finished scribbling down the large list of questions when he had finally shut off his light, forcing himself to get some rest.
"Just a certain someone I was in a duel with, things got quite messy," He kicked softly at Draco's foot under the table which made him jump.
He could almost feel Harry push through his guts and push into his stomach with how large and full he was.
"Maybe they're off helping with other things, we should go look after I change," Harry suggested and walked into his own room.
Harry felt almost uneasy with half his spot being taken up but he was too accustomed to his usual spot that he felt himself move forward towards the stranger.
When Harry's hand had drifted lightly over Draco's robbing erection, Draco let out a breathy moan into Harry's mouth. Harry's own erection was growing just at the sight of Draco. Breaking apart, Harry slid down Draco's body to his briefs, venturing his hands by dipping them low to tug off the restraining clothing.
Harry hadn't planned on going back to say goodbye though to Molly, it didn't seem like a casual thing he could do to his friend's family. And besides, he had already bid his farewells before leaving for Hogwarts anyway.
"Y-yes, thank you," He'd already prepaid for the book and gladly took the book over with such caution.
Malfoy's free hand traveled up his shirt and gripped onto a sensitive bud to twist and pull on, only wishing it was Harry's hot mouth suckling on it.
Many questions flooded Harry's mind. It was quite obvious that this was the continuation of last night's dream, written by Draco Malfoy himself. Harry's face was hot with embarrassment like he'd just been stripped of his clothing,
"You're awful to dance with," Malfoy thought aloud into Harry's warm chest. Harry laughed lightly, petting through the blonde locks with his free hand.
Harry warmly grinned and pulled Draco into a loving embrace, "Don't be," He mumbled into Draco's shoulder, "There's no need for that if the feeling is mutual," Draco scoffed at that as they broke apart.
Flipping back to the page he had marked off on, he found himself eager to leave work for today. He couldn't even really focus on what he was reading just thinking of what he was going to do after work which lit a burning smile onto his face.
Even the media had thought La Gaudière to be a girl. Harry laughed lightly to himself now remembering how La Gaudière had told him he wanted his identity to remain a secret.
Somehow in his dreams, he'd been able to completely let go and stand his ground to Malfoy. Even in the most embarrassing ways possible.
"Harry rested a hand over Draco's and softly grinned, "You won't stop writing these, will you? If you're going to toss it I'd like to keep it..." Harry blushed at the request he'd given.
Ron nodded, "I think she's homesick, she didn't really have a lot of time to prep for this returnal."
Draco felt a cold sweat overtake him when he realized that this would be their first time. His first time especially having Harry spread and squeeze him apart. This would definitely hurt.
Draco let out a choked sob as he gripped onto his mother who only ran a soothing hand down his back to calm him.
"Ever heard of personal space, Potter?" Draco mumbled under his breath, careful to not draw attention.
While out of school, Luna had owled Harry about a predicted attack targeted towards the raven-haired boy. At first, he didn’t quite take it seriously but with Malfoy acting suspiciously, he was keeping an eye out for any possible attack from him.
"Right, not like I won't have to listen to you and Dean fuck at the start of next week," Harry shot back, "Why didn't your boyfriend come anyways?" Seamus shrugged, "None of your business."
"Don't touch things that aren't yours, Potter! Give it back you git," Harry had thought for a moment at the almost reverse in roles before flipping through the first few pages of the mysterious book.
"What are you doing Malfoy?" Harry made the blonde flinch with the sudden approach and his face twisted.
inching closer to Draco. Harry could see tears begin to build in Draco's eyes, threatening to spill any second.
Draco pulled away, alarming Harry for a moment. "I need my wine," Draco mumbled to himself while pulling out a large unopened bottle of wine from the cabinet; he poured the liquid into a fancy glass he had used yesterday and swung back over to Harry.
Harry kept a long rambling of his thoughts at bay as he picked up the note one last time while blowing the candle out on his side table.
He wasn't complaining though, he made sure to reach for whatever little progress he could make with the blonde.
Would he accept Malfoy's invitation anyway? Yes, yes he would. Does that mean he's not freaked out at all? No, he is definitely freaking out.
Harry rolled his eyes, "Sod-off that's none of your business," Seamus held a hand to his chest, "Rude." He scoffed, "As your room neighbor I have every right to be apart of your love life if I'm going to have to listen to you guys bang every night."
"You're right, I don't Malfoy," Harry blurted out, "I can't imagine what it would be like to have lost a motherly figure after have gotten to spend time with her."
"A-ah," Draco cried out, fists clenched harder into Harry's flesh as he continued to push in until he felt his balls rest at Draco's swollen entrance.
Making his way to the bathroom across the guest room, Ginny had just stepped out of her room to greet a crotch soaked, messy-haired, Harry Potter.
"Sod off Potter," Malfoy tucked the books deeper in the pit of his arm when suddenly Harry snatched something from his hand.
Harry was careful to not make any noise, even with it being dark and almost running into every wall, he navigated his way to the Slytherin's house which awaited him a lonesome blonde.
"Look at me Potter, I'm serious," He commanded but Harry bent over the sink, just the other side of his neck was a bloody mess.
"Back already Potter? My my, let me help you with those," Draco was quick to welcome Harry back and grab onto the books Harry struggled to caress in his arms.
"I wanted to ask you if you were leaving to see your family for the week, now that your house has gone to Diagon Alley I don't see the point in staying when you have a family back home-"
Who would have thought Malfoy would have shown up to restore Hogwarts, the very place he'd help destroy-
Harry huffed out a weak laugh and admired how friendly Draco could be when he wasn't being such a prat.
Harry still didn't know why he had been having erotic dreams all summer about Malfoy but it kept him constantly on his mind. Making the summer feel extra long.
Harry was quickly winded from the few blocks he'd sprinted from his place to a local bookshop which had been promoting
Draco had been cockwarming Harry and only continued to rock back and forth getting Harry to slip out a hot breathed moan.
"You two seem to like to follow us," Pansy laughed turning back to the ripped curtains that sprawled out on the floor.
A long sofa wrapped itself around a corner of the room with many books pre-opened and littered around it. A few discarded bottles of wine caught Harry's eye as he saw the stained maroon carpet beneath them.
He'd throat down Draco's cock suddenly, pulling back with a pop sound that had Draco's body shudder against him.
Harry thought Draco had ignored his statement when he had only continued to flick his quill around on his desk.
Harry subconsciously searched for Malfoy who he'd finally spot sitting beside Pansy and her friends. Draco was slouching over the table and looked awfully tired, with dark circles around his eyes.
"Be patient love," Harry's hot breath left Draco's ear and carefully licked itself down his throat, leaving soft love bites before lapping at them with soft kisses.
Both fingers had fit perfectly into Draco's puckered pink hole, slipping in and out as if he'd been stretched out before this. Harry wondered if their dreams could allow for that to happen but lost thought when he'd lightly brush against Draco's prostate earning a rasped moan from Draco's pretty lips. He'd arched his back too, hoping to press against it again but Harry had retracted his fingers again.
Draco curls up smaller, and pulls out a clump of hair from the back of his head. If Harry squints he’s certain there’s a small bald patch. Seeing the small patch of skin makes his chest ache.
Harry looks away. Draco’s stopped looking at him, and is now staring down at his parchment, idly dragging his quill across it.
He makes his way to the back of the classroom and slips quietly into the chair next to Draco. Draco flinches, as if only just noticing that there’s other students in the room, and then he just stares at Harry with an unreadable expression.
For a start it’s more spacious. Naturally, this was the ancestral home of a magical lineage, they would never have to put up with things like lack of
Malfoy’s voice had lost the dull monotony, and now he was blazing, close to the boy Harry had hated, but unlike then there’s crack in his complexion. His eyes are haunted, still.
“I’m not sure. I wasn’t really… We were away, for a bit. And then I wasn’t really thinking when we were there. I don’t really remember much.”
Harry stares at Draco in shock as he rambles. It’s the most he’s said in weeks, and properly the most he’s said at once all year.
Harry sort-of convinced Draco to come along with him after he's finished his Auror shift. Draco had been hesitant, still suspicious of muggle supermarkets, and Harry could almost hear Draco getting ready to say “
“Yes you did.” Harry is about to argue that he truly had no clue what the spell would do when Draco carries on, “I meant to hurt you. I was going to use the Cruciatus curse on you. I don’t know if it would have worked. Maybe nothing would have happened. Maybe I would have tortured you in Myrtle’s bathroom. It worked on Rowle, you know that. Maybe I would have been a torturer instead of a murderer.”
However, despite their unspoken arrangement, one chilled night in mid-February, Harry stumbles down to the common room and finds it empty.
Malfoy, the fingers of one hand still twisted in the limp strands of his hair, just nods at him, and Harry knows that he understands.
“I don’t sleep much either,” He confesses. Malfoy sighs, and it sounds suspiciously like a hidden sob. Harry politely looks the other way.
Draco lets out a small noise in his sleep, and then Harry remembers suddenly where he is, and calms down. He can’t see out of the window because Draco’s room doesn’t have one. He pulls the duvet up to his chin and stares blankly at the blackness above him.
“Don’t stop.” A quiet voice whispers into his ear. He turns his head slightly to see Draco’s gaze flickering between his face, his wand and the china doll. “I want to see.”
She’s young, pale-faced with a splattering of brown freckles across her nose. Her face is set in a hard line, and for a moment he’s reminded inexplicably of Ginny at her most determined.
“Yes.” Harry says. He expects Draco to at least argue a little, but instead he flicks his wand and wordlessly Accios two pillows from their bedroom. He sits on one, and passes the other one to Harry. Harry hugged it to his chest.
Harry realises that Draco was still staring at him, kneeling just outside the open door. He has a bewildered look on his face. Harry understands; Draco isn't fond of dark spaces.
As he nears the source of the noise, Harry can make out a small figure behind a tree, either kneeling or crouching. He slowly tip-toes forwards, and clear as day can make out the sound of a familiar sob.
Hermione doesn’t notice that Harry’s not all there, engrossed in her book, eating the occasional spoonful of milk-sodden cereal.
Harry’s never been good at comforting people. Had never learned how; as a child there had been no one to teach him, and by the time he got older everything he did just felt awkward. But that night in the common room Harry had done something right, so he wraps his arm around Draco, who leans into him without any noise, and silently cries into Harry’s chest.
Draco stares at him, and his grey eyes flicker down to Harry’s lips, before he turns away and pulls his cloak tighter around his thin shoulders.
He didn't see and didn't care where Weasley was and what he was doing, but he saw Granger, who, with a bated breath, was watching Draco while he was casting. She was still sitting on the bed clutching Harry's hand tightly and staring at his lifeless face.
"When Nagini bit me I passed out, I suppose my shields had gone weak and I slipped into Riddle's mind. He was too excited that Nagini found me and was able to bite me so he didn't even notice me inside of his sick fucking head. And I saw everything what happened through his eyes. I felt his enormous triumph when he saw myself falling out of the window with Ron and Hermione. And then we disappeared. I felt such a strong anger and fury, I'd kill everyone who'd risk to show up in front of me." Harry apparently felt Draco tensed in his arms, he drew him closer and cupped his face with his free hand. "I mean he felt all of this, not me. It's just hard to separate his thoughts and emotions from mine when I trapped in his mind like this. Did I scare you?"
Draco's days at Grimmauld Place were boring and even. Almost all he did was eating, sleeping and a lot of reading. Sometimes it was spending time with his Godfather, who told him a little about what was going on outside. For some weird reasons Severus didn't let him into the library, but he gave Draco a few ancient books about wizarding history and family blood magic.
"He has an order from Dumbledore," Harry's hand tightened on Draco's shoulder. "Sorry, I can't tell you, 'Mione."
That and the incredible shag, that Harry gave to him before they went to sleep, fucking him sweetly and slowly at first and brutally rough and fast at the end. After Harry finally let him come, the seconds before he spilled inside of Draco himself, Draco blacked out for some time again, and was vaguely aware of Harry cleaning him up with a wet towel. But he remembered Harry's strong arms around his body and Harry's breath in his hair when he was falling asleep.
Draco jumped and tried to pull away from Harry when he heard Weasley, but Harry was still pressing him to the wall and holding him by the hips.
"Malfoy," he looked up at Granger and she might have seen all his emotions on his face, because she just stared at him and didn't say whatever she was going to.
But all thoughts and worries left his head when he felt Harry squeezing him tightly and kissing the top of his head, whispering quiet “I love you so much, baby,” into Draco’s hair.
"And why is that? I think I can do whatever the hell I want and you of all people have nothing to say about it."
"Ask Hermione to bring me some food please, if you'd suddenly decide she's worth enough for you to talk to," Potter said him coolly and Draco already regretted a little the way he talked about Harry's friends. But just a little.
Draco had never got ready so fast in his life before and only five minutes later he was already standing among tall great oaks holding Kreacher's hand. He closed his eyes and inhaled slowly and deeply.
Everyone laughed and started shouting something, but it wasn't really easy to understand, not that Draco was trying to, anyway. Harry was laughing too, but then he leaned his forehead against Draco's and tightened his arm around Draco's waist.
"There is a Burn-Healing paste just in case," Potter said gesturing to the small tube on the bedside table and rubbing his scar with his free hand. "I don't know what he's going to do to you, and what he really can do. I mean, through the Mark. He wanted to find you but he can't because of the wards on the house. But he can still torture you through it, and he was saying to your father that he'd torture you to death. But it's not gonna happen, you know, right? Snape will help you and I will do all I can too."
He gave the letter to Kreacher and went to the bathroom to brush his teeth and comb his hair. When he was almost done, the loud crack of elf's appearance made him jump and drop his hairbrush on the floor.
Draco didn't answer, just stared at the bookshelf on the opposite wall replaying Severus' last words in his mind.
Severus ignored their stares and was murmuring more spells and briefly touching Harry's body with his fingertips.
At the same time a silver otter appeared and said: "Be in the place where you left us in a five, Ron will come to fetch you," in Granger's voice.
Also it was quite a surprise for Draco, who never liked being around people more than it was absolutely necessary, that he didn't mind loud Italians and the noisy tourists groups that were everywhere around the city. He was just enjoying being here with Harry too much to care about them.
All Draco's body was on fire and he was really surprised he hadn't passed out from all the sensations. And he was sure he'd fall if it wasn't for Harry's arms around him and Draco's own hands around Harry's neck.
"We should wait a little longer." Potter shifted on the blanket and leaned back on Draco's cushion so their thighs and arms were pressed together.
"Draco," Harry called for him from the bed before Draco had a chance to answer to Granger. "Will you be with me?" he asked quietly.
Draco didn't come while Harry was sucking and biting the skin of the inner sides of his thighs, though all Draco's body was trembling uncontrollably. Draco didn't come when Harry started licking around his hole, though he was a sobbing incoherent mess by that time. Draco didn't come when Harry started fucking him with his tongue, though his throat was already hurting from moaning and crying out loud.
"You've already spent half of it in here, relax Severus," Harry said with a grin, casually sprawling on one of the benches and looking as gorgeous as always.
But Draco couldn't speak, so he just held Harry as close to himself as he could and tried to stop crying (he couldn't even remember when he began).
Malfoy, obviously, doesn’t look up. “It’s a good reading spot, and it’s quiet. Usually.” He says with a pointed tone. Harry doesn’t believe him.
What happens next is a blur to him: There’s the roar of a Floo, and then Harry’s being ushered through it with Draco’s warm weight still draped over his shoulders, and Pomfrey is speaking to the Healers - they’re in St Mungo’s and then Draco is snatched away from him and he sits - or maybe he falls - into an uncomfortable chair, and then the world drags itself into focus again.
The Gryffindor stumbles back at the look on Harry’s face, and then he steps forward, stupidly brave. He pulls out his wand, and Harry hits him.
“Hey,” Harry says when he walks into the common room three nights later, finding Malfoy in the same spot, and almost the exact same position.
But Harry had never told him the details. He had locked them away in his mind and vowed never to speak about it and until now he had done a fairly good job.
Harry didn’t know what Hermione would do if she knew about him and Draco. Sure, Harry was certain she knew that they talked without hurling insults now and maybe she thought they had a tentative friendship, but he was certain she didn’t know about their night-time ritual, or how many times they met in the dark. Even if she found out about that, Harry didn’t want to think about her reaction to Harry and Draco
Harry adapted. He had no choice in doing anything else, but he had escaped them years ago, and now after feeling that freedom, the idea of living in the same house as a Dursley made him feel sick.
When he was small enough to be in primary school, they had learnt about mines, Harry couldn’t remember what class it was. It was easy to get lost in a mine, alone in the dark, and so people would take pieces of string and tie them to the exits, so no matter how far in they went, they would always be able to find their way out if they remembered their piece of string.
Harry puts on his glasses and sighs, half under Draco’s bed, when he can finally see properly. He’s about to shuffle out from the small space when the light from his wand glints against something stuffed up against the wall, as far away from Harry as it could get.
He hisses and pulls his burnt hand from the fire, cradling it to his chest as he scrambles backwards. He stops when he hits the side of the armchair, and Harry can see him curl up, head on his knees, his unburnt hand fisted in his hair, and then he starts to rock himself slowly, like a child after…
Draco doesn’t lift his head when Harry approaches, doesn’t take any notice of him. Harry sits quietly into the chair opposite, and suddenly realises that his front still smells of vomit.
Pomfrey is gone, she could be back at Hogwarts, or in the room where Draco had been taken before the door was slammed in his face.
He goes to bed early that night, complaining of a headache. It’s not truly a lie. His head is pounding. He stays awake for hours, tossing and turning in the sheets, and is still conscious when Draco slips under the covers next to him.
The question catches Harry off-guard, and any response gets stuck somewhere between his chest and his throat.
He doesn’t see Hermione in any other lessons that morning, and then he begins to worry. He takes the stairs to the dorm two at a time, and then remembers that he won’t be able to get into her dorm, as boys and girls were still prohibited from each other's sleeping spaces. Luckily for him the Patil twins are in the common room, so he asks one of them to go look for her for him. Padma does, and then she comes back down grim-faced.
Harry laughs without humour. “It was years ago, and there’s no evidence. Who’d you think would be believed in court, a middle class pensioner that took in his orphaned nephew by marriage, or said nephew who he said was a delinquent and, according to him, was sent to a reform school for problem boys and then just vanished when he was seventeen? There’s no point. It would be dragging it out for nothing.”
“Oh, merlin. What happened? I hope you weren’t fighting.” She doesn’t say it particularly accusingly, and Harry spares her a glare, because he supposes it wouldn’t’ve been particularly out of the ordinary in the past.
about me in the forest, you thought I was up to something! You probably thought that I was on some mad quest to bloody resurrect the Dark Lord!”
Harry doesn’t know for sure what Draco’s talking about - today, or Christmas Eve in the forest, or maybe he’s thinking about a bloodier event, when Harry had slashed his chest open in the bathroom. That was only a couple of years ago, but it felt ancient.
They're not in front of the bed, so Harry flops onto the floor like a fish thrown onto land, and looks under the bed. Well, feels under the bed, as even with his wand all he can make out are blurry shapes.
Harry wants to argue, wants to make Malfoy shout at him again, wants to shout at Malfoy for being so
Draco sits awkwardly on his own bed and observes Harry. “Are you, um, do you want to stay, just for a bit? I don’t mind.”
“Funny shaped door,” Malfoy continues in that same flat tone. He’s lying, it would be obvious even to a flobberworm, but Harry doesn’t push it. Not yet.
Draco strikes two more matches and watches them burn before lighting the candle with the fourth match. He doesn’t need to, when the Lumos begins to flicker Harry can just cast it again, but he supposes it’s part of Draco’s routine.
“But I… the things I said, about your family… I was awful. And you know that I am sorry about it.” He says.
He’s lucky that the Eighth Year common room isn’t too far from the Astronomy Tower, and the stairs seem to be on his side, for he hardly has to wait before another staircase slots into place.
He doesn’t remember how he gets back to Hogwarts, but suddenly the white tile under his feet turns to slabs of hard stone, and there’s a warm hand on his forehead, and he looks up into the blue eyes of Ron Weasley.
Madam Pomfrey rushes out from her office, and despite the situation Harry finds her presence a small comfort.
There’s a hushed murmur coming from all four tables, and Harry understands why when Hermione slides a copy of the Daily Prophet over to him.
Draco takes the trolley from Harry and walks briskly to the end of the aisle, weaving through muggles with polite murmurs. To anyone else he must look like a normal shopper, but Harry can see the stiffness in his legs, and the way his knuckles are white where his long fingers wrap tightly around the trolley handle.
Harry feels a bit like he’s been slapped. Draco doesn’t notice; his eyes are tightly shut. He tries not to think about Ginny, because he still isn’t sure where he stands with her. He had loved her once, and he still did, but not like he had done when he walked into the forest. That part of him had been numbed and sliced off months ago, and Harry knew it wouldn’t grow back.
There’s a candlestick next to his bed, but instead of lighting it he just watches the match, and Harry watches him, and the match burns down to nothing, and small black pieces of wood float down onto the covers.
“Merlin, yes.” Draco doesn’t need to be told twice, he tosses his cutlery onto his plate and grabs his bag from his lap.
Harry impulsively makes a decision then, and turns away from the familiarity of the Gryffindor table and strides over to the Slytherins, not pausing to take a breath until he’s flopped onto the bench opposite Draco. Draco jumps at the thump of him hitting the bench, and then his eyes widen in surprise when he sees that it’s Harry. He glances around at the rest of the school, who haven’t noticed yet.
And Harry understands Malfoy, too. Harry had never had to live in the same house as the Dark Lord, but Harry knows what it’s like to wake to red eyes. He knows what it’s like to have terror grip your very soul and dig its claws in, to feel the despair in the pit of his stomach rise through his body, and have the feeling stay with him even long after waking up, managing to admit to himself in the quiet stillness of night that even though Lord Voldemort was finally dead and the Horcrux inside of him was gone, he would forever carry some part of Tom Riddle with him.
Draco’s plate looks untouched, as if he had only put food on it for show, or like it was plastic food that rich people kept (One of Aunt Petunia's friends had kept plastic food out for show, and Harry still doesn't understand why). Harry wonders, not for the first time, how much Draco actually eats.
Harry hesitantly, certain that Draco would pull away, links their pinkie fingers together. Draco’s fingers are cold despite the charm.
Draco lets out a small noise, a mix between a groan and a whimper, and Harry shyly places a hand on his shoulder, unsure whether it’ll be a comfort or not. Draco twitches again, his hands coming up to clutch his head, and then the noise he lets out is high and shrill, like the sound of a cat caterwauling, and Harry shakes him.
“Oh,” Draco says, and wets his lips. For a moment Harry thinks he’s going to say something about Fred, but he doesn’t speak again.
“I wanted to see if you were alright,” Harry says honestly. Draco looks confused, and still twitchy like he expects someone to jump out and hex him at any moment. “Is your, uh, hand okay?”
Harry studies him after he’s flopped on the couch. There’s a patch of mottled grey-purple on the underside of his chin that wasn’t there last time.
Draco’s face spasms, and something like anxiety passes through him before he smooths out the expression. “Does it have to be done here?”
Draco watches it intensely, and Harry senses that this is another one of Draco’s rituals, so he lays down quietly against the cushions and watches.
Ron had looked at him silently, blue eyes full of concern, and Harry had stopped talking. And never said anything about it again.
Startled, he sits up, and for once the dizziness that accompanies him upon waking isn’t present, and he goes to grab his glasses from his bedside cabinet and his hand bumps against something soft and warm.
“It’s not,” Malfoy cuts him off. “it’s nothing like that… Just, she’d give you some if you asked. But she’s strict with it, she won’t give it to you all the time.”
As Harry stares into the fire and thinks, he hears a deceptively soft noise. He glances at Malfoy; his face is no longer slack, it’s twisted into a face familiar to the one he had made on the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy murmurs something soft, and the gentle noise is a heavy contrast to the fright that seems to stiffen his entire body even though he’s still sleeping.
Not knowing what possesses him, Harry casts one over them both. Malfoy shudders as the warmth envelopes him, but he stops shivering. He hasn’t told Harry to get lost yet, hasn’t spoken a word. Malfoy’s barely said a word all year; Harry wonders if someone’s cursed him.
“Are you alright? Has anything happened? Did you see him?” He asks, hand on his wand holster, clearly worried. Harry shakes his head.
Harry wants to argue that it wasn’t exactly the same, and whereas Harry’s scar had been awful, it hadn’t nearly slashed through his arteries.
Harry would kill him. He was not a violent man, but the rage twisted with terror would set his magic ablaze inside him, and Dursley would not survive it. Harry was certain he had come close to something in the middle of Tescos before Draco apparated them away -
It’s only when they land in Grimmauld Place that Harry can breathe again. As he draws in a desperate breath, he realises that Draco apparated them.
“I know,” Malfoy says quietly. He reaches up a hand and tugs a lock of his hair. Harry wonders about that for a moment.
He cooks that night, and Harry is aware the whole time that Draco’s cooking is awful; he keeps promising to teach him to cook but he can never bring himself to. Harry eats what's on his plate, tongue not tasting what he was swallowing. It felt like chewing wet cardboard.
The weather is kind that morning; there’s a sulphurous sun seeping through his window, and the sky is a cerulean blue. Harry can’t help but feel like something is wrong as he goes through the motions of the morning.
But why was Malfoy here? It was definitely him that he spied through the window, Harry knows Malfoy anywhere, but why? Of all places in the middle of winter, why here? There had to be a reason. And Harry is determined to find out.
Harry pats his hand, and rejoices slightly when Draco doesn’t pull away. “You’ll get it back soon, and it’ll be like you always had it.”
“Oh.” Most of the hall has stopped their silent staring by now, but Harry can hear the buzz of a rumour passing along them, and he knows that they are all concocting their own stories as to why such an unlikely pair is sitting together.
Harry’s stumped, but he hears the flush of the toilet and shuffles quickly out from under the bed, and winces as he bangs his head on the bed frame. He’s rubbing the spot when Draco comes out from the bathroom, looking far more awake then he had before, the redness under his eyes washed away.
He’s panting like a dog now, but he can’t stop. He sprints past Hagrid’s hut without sparing the groundskeeper a thought.
Harry nods, shifting Draco’s weight slightly as the thinner boy stares blearily around at the empty beds. “That's what they said.”
Despite the fact that Draco is the person Harry now talks to most outside of Hermione and Ron, Harry has never actually seen inside his room. It’s disappointingly almost identical to Harry’s, with the same bed and desk and chair. Draco’s room doesn’t have a window, though.
“Yeah. Worst thing is I don’t know what, and knowing Hermione she won’t tell me until I guess, which I won’t. And I just… I don’t know. I just don’t feel anything. Everything’s just… Off. Like the world started to spin in the opposite way to what it used to.”
Draco shrugs and sits up, keeping his eyes on the dark water. “I don’t know. Any life under the water, I suppose. I never saw the Giant Squid, but in the old common room we would sometimes see Merfolk. But since the war… they’ve gone.”
He shakes himself again. It’s a stupid train of thought; he would be missed if he were to suddenly vanish. He’s Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived-twice, and he would not be defeated by a forest.
But I’m not going to kill myself - that upset my Mother, and I know it would upset you two. But I’m not ever getting my wand back - I know that.”
In the end, Harry tells Draco absolutely everything. They’re in the library, Draco’s favourite spot in the house that Harry has grown more fond of, and Harry’s curled up next to Draco in front of a roaring fire, cradling a cup of Draco’s expensive tea, and he lets the rest of it spill out of him. Every shout, every slap, and lock being drawn.
Eventually, Draco sniffs, and swallows. He picks up a handkerchief from the bedside cabinet, and dabs at his eyes.
Malfoy gives no indication that the question upsets him, but he’s not forthcoming either. “Yes,” is all he says.
“Draco?” He calls frantically, and looks over the edge with trepidation. Harry can only see darkness, and the occasional shimmer.
He’s not really there for the rest of the class, and he doesn’t feel the looks he and Draco get from the other students. He’s dimly aware of giving Draco the teacup after class, and of him gently tucking it into his bag, like it’s something precious. Through the fog that has suddenly overtaken his mind, something in his chest soars like a shooting star.
Someone, a Fifth Year Ravenclaw, Harry thinks, started calling him Mental Malfoy, and though as far as Harry knows they didn’t say it to his face, when Harry had heard it he had turned around so quickly that one of the girls she was gossiping with gasped and dropped her textbooks.
Draco reopens the box of matches and seems to be counting them. At least that’s what Harry thinks he’s doing, he can’t make it out.
He goes in the direction of McGonagall's classroom, and is almost there when he hears a shout. It’s somewhere close, but he can’t quite make it out.
Maybe Draco was just a light eater, and was able to survive on a snobs diet of two grapes and a gulp of pumpkin juice, but Harry didn’t think that was quite right. In general, Draco looks like he’s ready to fall over at any moment.
Harry regrets that now. What they were now… it was confusing Harry. They aren’t exactly friends, but they definitely aren’t enemies. Somewhere in the middle, and there was something fragile about them now. About Malfoy especially.
Draco glances down, and then blinks at the plate as if just noticing it in front of him. He frowns at it, the skin between his eyebrows crinkling, his teeth worrying his pink bottom lip.
Despite his thin frame, Draco soon becomes a dead weight over Harry’s shoulder, and it’s harder to drag him than he thought it’d be. He doesn’t want to cast a lightening charm, because Harry’s certain that with one more spell Draco will be sick.
Draco carries on reciting his monologue on the health benefits of muggle ice cream, but Harry’s not listening over the sound of buzzing in his ears.
He can’t. His head is cloudy with lack of rest, but he knows he won’t sleep anymore today. Rays of the morning sun are just starting to filter through the curtains.
“When I first learnt that the Earth turned, I thought Mother was lying to me. I was certain that we’d fall off.”
Harry stares at the ground. This could have been his final resting place. A lonely grave in the cold, dark forest. There doesn’t seem to even be animals here anymore.
It takes a moment for him to register what he’s seeing, and when he does he forgets his wand entirely and throws a punch that would rival the strength of werewolf at the peak of its transformation.
“And then I learnt about the stars, and their names and the constellations, and which planets were there and which planet had which moons, and it was nice, knowing that my name meant something important. Did nothing for my ego, though. And then it was a comfort, knowing that whatever happened, the world would still be turning. But now… I feel like I’m going to fall off at any moment.”
Harry regrets it immensely. Malfoy seems to deflate if Harry’s poked him with a sharp pin. The anger leaves him, and he’s left with only shame running through his now-hunched shoulders.
This chapter was originally going to be twice as long, but I had to split it in two. I'll probably post the original other half tomorrow or Sunday.
Harry expects him to jump up and start spitting insults, but he doesn’t. He just sits there, blue-lipped and shivering under the oak tree, staring at Harry with watery, red-rimmed eyes. He glances at Harry’s wand, and wraps his arms around himself, looking away, now still.
A single, salty tear slips from Draco’s eye. It slides down his face and makes a tiny dot on his pillow. “Why? I don’t understand you. You should stay away, everyone else did.”
Draco lets out another groan, and Harry reaches across him and fumbles for his glasses and wand. He manages to grab his wand, but his glasses tumble onto the carpet.
Draco is, once again and unsurprisingly, missing from breakfast. Harry had been trying to talk to the elusive Slytherin since that night on the tower, but he had taken to moving about the entire castle instead of pacing in his room, and Harry had yet to catch him unawares.
Draco’s freshly painted door opens slowly, and then wider when Draco sees it’s just Harry. Harry glances at him, his heart still pounding, and then Draco looks into the dark corridor and opens the door to let him in.
“You’re not a freak. Those muggle relatives are the freaks, for doing that to a child!” Draco burst out. “Even my father -” Draco abruptly stops.
Harry is moving before he realises it, at the door before he realises he’s on his feet, someone jeers at him as he leaves the common room but Harry doesn’t care to make out what’s said.
Ron, too. Ron had lost his own brother, and it hurt so much that he couldn’t bear to come back to Hogwarts, who floo calls them regularly but can’t bear to set foot on the grounds. Harry couldn’t blame him either.
Draco fiddles with his duvet, smoothing the creases in it. “Uh, no. I wasn’t asleep. I was reading. I was going to go down to the common room, but it’s bloody freezing, isn’t it?”
“Sorry,” He gasps breathlessly, his heart beginning to recede now that he wasn't alone. “Did I wake you?”
Harry closes his eyes, and then quickly opens them again when he’s faced with darkness. “No. But… I didn’t really die, I suppose. I thought I might.”
Harry’s blabbering, and Draco’s just staring at him and nodding occasionally, a pensive look on his face. It’s only when Harry finishes that he realises that the tables around them have gone quiet.
Well, like a child after a nightmare. Out of the black suits Malfoy had worn throughout sixth year, he suddenly looks incredibly young.
we could do about it, and I stopped sleeping. Every few nights I get a few hours… but I don’t want to sleep because -.”
Harry watches in a trance as Draco unbuttons his robes and pushes them off his shoulders. He’s not wearing a shirt underneath, and Harry is instantly greeted with the view of Draco’s bare chest.
Draco meets his eyes, and there’s something inside  the dampness of his eyes and the arch of his lips that makes Harry’s chest ache with what he suddenly recognises with longing, and the realisation stumps him for just a moment; he doesn’t have time to dwell on that because Draco, for a reason Harry cannot comprehend in the moment, drops his gaze to Harry’s chin, and then, slowly begins to lean forward.
“You’re a traitor, Harry Potter!” He shouts. Or maybe he whispers it, Harry can barely make it out over the thunder in his ears. His wand is forgotten, and whatever the emptiness inside was holding back now flows out of him, like water overfilling a gutter.
The attention spurs Harry into movement, and he pushes past them and into the Great Hall. Instinctively his body turns towards the Gryffindor table, but even though his other friends are seated there, seeing Hermione and Ron’s absence makes it feel empty. Instead, he turns towards the Slytherin table.
Harry stares between both boys, and then back to Draco, who’s straining against his bonds without making a sound, and Harry says
A little over a fortnight after the ‘The The Tescos incident’, as Draco had begun to call it, Harry arrives home to find a letter waiting for him on the jade marble of the kitchen worktops. Harry picks it up without thinking and sees that it’s addressed to him.
Harry sees Draco hesitate, and the nightmarish image of waking up to Voldemort above him abruptly pops into his head, and he’s about to say
Harry jerks around. Draco is curled up under his cloak on the wooden floor of the balcony, leaning against the railing, facing the drop. The night wind whips at his face, making his hair flutter. There’s a bald patch on the left side of his head.
“Push who?” Ron had appeared through the growing crowd, and handed Hermione a glass of wine and Harry a beer, and they all clinked before taking a swig from their drinks.
James, holding a stuffed hippogriff toy, beamed at her, while Albus looked from his mother to his father, then made grabby hands at the latter, who picked him up with a smile. After glancing at the clock on the wall, Harry moved through the kitchen to the hallway, transferring Albus to Ginny on the way. In discontentment, Albus whined and reached for him again.
Moments later, Ron stumbled into the kitchen, with a bedhead of hair and Harry’s bathrobe falling open, revealing more than anyone felt necessary.
“I must admit,” Hermione said, pushing her cleared plate forwards so she could lean on the table, “I wasn’t sure it was a good idea for him to come tonight. It can be traumatizing, you know, revisiting the place where a loved one has died. Especially when you were as close to them as George was to Fred.”
Ginny, stood in the doorway, still in her pj's, red-orange hair sticking up in all directions, like the lashing flames in a fire, chuckled sleepily, followed by a yawn, "Mmh, morning to you too," she responded, stepping aside as Harry walked into the home. Ginny looked from Harry, back outside before closing the door, "No Ted?"
"Hi Luna, I'm good, thanks." He gestured for them to keep walking, and after shifting the files (as well as an old Quibbler) she was holding a bit, so they were no longer slipping from her grip, they walked down to Harry's office. "The boys were pretty good this morning, Ginny was a little bit quiet though. S'pose she's a bit nervous about the article in today's Prophet, re-reading it at the kitchen table and all..." His recount of the earlier hours wasn't a long one, for Harry had accidentally caught the eye of one of his colleagues, who seemed to have recently shaved, a particular thing that had always stirred a feeling in Harry, a kind of feeling that made him bite the inside of his lip to distract him from... Well, the distraction that this man had caused him. Shaking his heated cheeks, he quickly moved his staring from the smirking man down to the floor.
Hermione’s face lit up, “No way! I see no reason why she shouldn’t write it. Thank you Harry, perhaps I could talk to her about collaborating on the subject. Where is she?”
Ginny managed a sad smile at that, the memory of one of many silly pranks he and George played on her swirling in her mind.
“Of course you did.” Harry moved on from the disappointment, “Alright, so no mixing business with pleasure-”
Exparated, Harry yielded, “Your clothes gave me away this morning, I’m afraid. Took about three hungover minds and maybe five minutes before the penny dropped, but they caught on to the fact that I’d slept over at yours. So far, I think it’s just Dean and Seamus that suspect…” they catch each other's eyes, only to swiftly avert them again, “Something.”
Harry exchanged a look with Ron, who rolled his eyes, and continued to nod along with Hermione’s rambling, as he had finally figured out that was her preferred form of ‘conversation’ when she had something to get off her chest. He guided her towards one of the standing tables while Ron went to clap someone he had recognised on the back.
“Whoa, sounds like quite the adventure. Admirable of you, very humanitarian to dedicate time and effort into curing ailments. A lot of academic people in your friend circle?”
A few minutes of silence set in, during which Draco was simply confused at Harry’s resolution to be annoyingly stubborn and his determination in the matter. The night air was clearing Draco’s mind a bit, chasing away the alcohol-induced cloudiness in his mind. Harry’s hair had become messier than it was at the beginning of the evening, but somehow it was a comfort to Draco, to see some of the old Harry again. Those smart dress robes and the well-groomed stubble didn’t fit in with the Harry that Draco remembered. His headstrong attitude had never gone though, and he’d heard how well that trait worked out for him while he was doing his job.
He flashed Draco that cheeky grin of his, and Draco’s stomach flipped, and he could have sworn that his knees almost buckled, had he not used the wall to steady himself.
The hedgehog, as it in fact was, took one look at Draco and Scorpius, and scurried off into the safe leaves of a bush. Scorpius made a sad noise, Draco picked him up, “How about, instead of trapping creatures, we silently watch them from a safe distance. Especially ones that are covered in pointy things.”
He only laughed softly, nodded or shook his head to agree with his son whenever he wanted assurance and smiled, because he couldn’t help the grin his little boy always brought to his face. Astoria simply sat and listened, at first fighting the jealousy that wrenched at her heart, but it slowly subsided every time Scorpius laughed, because she knew Draco made him happy, there was always a sparkle to him whenever Draco sent a letter.
“No, not lost, I seem to have lost my companions, is all.” He’d adjusted to the light, which came from a sparkling ball that Malfoy had sent up to hover overhead. He undid the Lumos charm and looked Malfoy up and down. The suit he was wearing was grey, as was his shirt. No tie, and black dress shoes. What was new, was his long hair, which was tied behind his head somewhere Harry couldn’t see, and was long enough to lay over his shoulder. He seemed a bit taller than the time Harry had last seen him, but his whole demeanor and his looks were as damned breathtaking as they always had been.
After what would have been a few miles of walking, he had circled back to the robes shop, and the prospect of seeing shopkeeper from earlier again making him squirm with anxiousness, Draco hurriedly turned into a sidestreet to catch the breath he didn’t know had escaped him, body heaving from the uncommon amount of exercise. The raw, aching pain of scar tissue over his chest and back refusing to stretch as his lungs expanded was easily dulled with a whispered spell and a fluid movement of his hand, but the uneasy feeling of being watched, stayed. Fighting the need to sink to his knees in exhaustion, both mental and physical, made Draco feel guilty and regretful that he never managed to eat enough to keep himself strong nor exercise enough to feel fit. He had to lean against the old, greying brick wall for support, wind rushing between the buildings, dragging wet, dead leaves with it, until the silhouette in the corner of his eye came too close for comfort, and Draco finally managed to apparate home, not waiting to find out if whoever he saw had actually been there, nor what they might have wanted.
“Well, one must tidy themselves up every now and again, don’t you think? Not all of us can pull off a hat like that, after all.”
Harry looked up in concern, but Ginny shook her head to let him know it wasn’t too serious, “There’s, erm- Tomato sauce smeared across the kitchen wall. I cleaned the floor but it stained the paint and it still smells of tomato in there.”
Ginny sighed, “Oh, don’t be silly, he told me he was gay when I asked about Astoria. Anyway, we invited him to stay, of course, and he wanted to refuse. I understood, it’s a little odd being somewhere where you hardly know anyone and everyone else knows each other, but you know how Mum is… She pretty much told him he shouldn’t be rude and that he must stay because now he’d already help set up.”
Ginny slowly looked up at Harry. After reading the letter, this one addressed to her, out loud, silence had hung in the air for several minutes, each one with their own thoughts and memories to go over.
On the other side sat little Scorpius, patiently waiting while he watched a miniature quidditch player fly around in front of him, his mother observing from the next room, whispering charms that made the tiny player flip and loop the loop as it whizzed around Scorpius’ head, right past his ear to make him giggle. When the fire rose and orange bled green, Scorpius sprang up, quidditch player forgotten, instantly enveloped in a hug. Draco tightened his arms around the boy as he stood up and sat in an armchair, Scorpius now warmly snuggled into his father’s lap. Draco complemented his clothes- "Don’t you look smart in those trousers", and asked Scorpius every question he’d been storing for this visit. Had he been eating his vegetables, had he been brushing his teeth, had he fed the ducks, had he combed his hair by himself, had he kissed Mummy everyday, had he been to friend’s house again, and so on.
“Malfoy, I know you’re joking, but it really sounds like you’re mocking me. Anyway, what is your patronus? I never saw you produce one.”
Draco laughed, but went along with it. Matching Ted’s whisper, he crouched lower, “I trapped the family cat in the attic.”
The tension in the room strained and became near unbearable, so Harry nodded, “Yeah, he was kind enough to offer.”
Andromeda had wandered into the house and was helping the men with spelling their suits into place and setting their hair straight. Harry asked her if she was coming, but she shook her head no, “I’m not up for it, dear. Give everyone my love, though, and here’s a card for young Victoire,” she handed Harry a beautifully decorated envelope. He smiled and hugged her, and she stepped back into the fireplace, but not before complementing Luna and Hermione on their dresses. Luna was wearing a silky yellow dress and had wrapped her shoulders in a sheer pink shawl. Ron was awestruck by Hermione, monochrome in lavender heels and a quarter-sleeved dress that passed her knees. Dean, wearing dove grey and a tie matching Dean’s, twirled Luna around with a smile, “Looking lovely as ever, ladies.”
'That’s one of us.' “I’m very glad I could help. If you ever need any more, just let me know and I’ll whip you up another vial.”
As far as Draco was concerned, they- Draco and Astoria, could have moved from their marital home into the Manor, as it was large enough to house both of them without having to see each other on a daily basis, and at the same time Scorpius’ time wouldn’t be divided, instead shared by his parents. Not to mention, Narcissa was in the same place and would have welcomed the company, even if it did mean she had to deduct three rooms from her host portfolio, for she had renovated one wing of the Manor into accommodation suitable for a few dozen students, who came from all over the magical world. Draco had learned about host families in the year following the defeat of Voldemort, as he’d not returned to Hogwarts for the eighth year he’d been asked to attend. He’d instead been accepted into Uagadou, Uganda’s wizarding school, so he could pursue and specialise in his passion of Alchemy. That’s what he wrote in his letter to the school’s head, anyway.
Ron, unaffected by the turn in the conversation, spoke up again, “Anyway, he’s doing some work with George now, but they only started a few weeks ago, as far as I know.”
Harry shakes his head understandingly, “It’s alright, you don’t have to explain. I get it. Of course you can see Ted, he’s already ten and you’ve only just met him. After his grandma, you’re his closest relative, after all.” Harry stops to consider the request for a moment, “He spends most days with her while I’m working, but the three of us could get dinner some time this coming week. Or I could drop him off at the restaurant and make myself scarce for a while, if you prefer...”
Draco cleared his throat and leaned closer to Harry, “I think they agree with what you said last night. We had it coming, let’s be honest.”
Potter didn't notice and continued telling something about Weasley and mushrooms, but Draco couldn't bring himself to pay enough attention to the story while he had an opportunity to watch Potter's broad shoulders, the line of his strong neck, his hands... He was wearing some ridiculous orange t-shirt, so Draco could see his bare tanned arms, the muscles in his forearms flexing when he was waving his hands. Draco lingered his gaze on these big gentle hands, imagining what it'd be like to be held in them.
"Draco, you'll wear the helmet or we're not going anywhere," Harry said in a surprisingly stern voice. "I'm not joking."
"Malfoy," it was Granger this time. "How exactly did it happen that you're here? Did Harry allow it? Did you change the side in the war or what? What about your parents?"
"You've been told the truth," she accepted the flowers with a big beautiful smile. "And, please, call me Narcissa, dear," she added, patting slightly blushing Harry on the arm.
He much more cared about words they were saying. Harry was talking about him the whole sixth year with his friends? Of course Draco had noticed that Potter was watching him or even following him sometimes, it was obvious he guessed that Draco became a Death Eater and Potter wanted to catch him. But Weasley and Granger were talking about it like it was some obsession, inability to think or talk about something or someone else.
Potter turned his head to look at Draco. "Truth is that I actually care, Malfoy. I don't hate you, don't think I really ever have. And it's not my home, it's just the place I owe."
He was telling him about their family holidays they were spending in France in the old Malfoy's Manor or in Spain in the sea-house his mother inherit from one of her Black great-aunts.
Draco ignored Granger's relieved but panicked "Harry!" and was grateful for Weasley who didn't let her jump on the bed.
"Why it is you and not me who thinks about my Mark and my protection?" Draco mused out loud staring at Potter in disbelief. "So you're saying you are concentrated on the Dark Lord's thoughts right now?"
"Are you capable of being serious, Potter?" Severus sounded tired and rather annoyed. "There is no need to answer that question," he held his hand when Potter was going to say something.
it was quite acceptable to sit on. They spent a good part of the night on that sofa, kissing, cuddling, drinking tea, talking about Quidditch and kissing again.
And Harry was just perfect himself, much more perfect than Draco had ever imagined him to be, and he had imagined a lot. He just never really believed he would have a chance to know what it's like to be with Harry that close.
Suddenly Harry let go of his hand and Draco panicked at first, but then Harry kneeled down and Draco saw a motorbike near one of the walls, and Harry was unlocking the chain from around the lamppost with a broken lamp.
Severus ignored him, but Potter opened his enormously green eyes and stared at him. Draco tried to look away but Severus' hands found their way into Potter's black hair and were running through them carefully tilting Potter's head to the side for a better access to his injury.
And now Draco suddenly realized that Harry looked older than twenty or twenty one. Was he really much older than all of them, or did he just look older?
Draco asked him back then why in the name of Merlin he had to cook when he was a child, but Potter didn't answer and fell silent for a long few minutes and when he started to speak it was to ask Draco to tell him about the book he was reading. All Draco wanted to do that moment was to
They went to Draco's – now old – room and Harry helped him to gather his things and move them into the new one.
So Draco cleared his throat awkwardly and asked Kreacher for butter. He could feel the fire of Severus' gaze on him while he was buttering his scone and then putting berries on it.
"I wish I could let Pansy know that I'm fine," Draco said quietly. "Do you know something about her?" he looked up at Harry who awkwardly looked away from him and then took a step back.
"Yeah... There weren't any Death Eaters but there was his fucking snake. I don't even know how, but she was able to use Bathilda Bagshot's body to lure us into a trap."
"Harry," Draco breathed Harry's name and closed his eyes. He felt Harry's hand in his hair again, and decided not to think about the words he was going to say next. "Do you– Do you still want to– to kiss me?"
Draco concentrated on his magic once more and cast a spell to stop the bleeding from Harry's neck, then he cast quick
Draco whined pitifully when after some more time Harry tugged him up from when he was trying to leave a love bite over Harry's hip bone, but the next moment he almost choked on his own breath, when Harry asked him in his low sexy voice:
The ride on the motorbike to his parents' house was amazing as always, but a short one, much to Draco's disappointment. They stopped by the flower shop and Harry bought a large bouquet of roses for Draco's mother; and the rest of the ride Draco had to hold onto Harry with one hand, because he was holding it in the other.
