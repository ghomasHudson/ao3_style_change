"-and that finishes my report. Does anyone else have anything to add?" A chorus of "no"'s comes back and McGonagall nods satisfied. "Then we see each other at supper. Please be present for the sorting tomorrow, heads of houses and you of course," she says, and her gaze runs over Malfoy, Sprout, Flitwick, Potter, and you. You fight your blush at being included in a group with Potter, but then they are all leaving and you hurry to catch up with Potter, who is of course at Malfoy's side.
someone, that wasn't him. He wants to take his hand away, to curl up and cry for a long time, but he couldn't bring himself too. Harry looks like he needs a friend. Who was Draco to deny him that?
"But you know someone, who does," Harry says like it's a fact and he's sure to see a flicker of acceptance in Zabini's eyes, but then the Slytherin sneers.
Draco was raised to be a Lord and to act and think as such, to feel superior and sneer while driving by, but all he felt was pity. Pity for that common folk, blind to all the possibilities and knowledge the world had to offer. Content like a dog with the owner feeding them scrabes, never intending to take the bird for themselves.
"No, I think I want to see this," he says very slowly as if he was speaking to a toddler and you want to snap back, but Potter puts his hand on Malfoy's arm and shakes his head infinitesimally. Malfoy sighs as if he's doing Potter a favor and leaves.
"Draco Malfoy, with my dear sister, Miss Lyra Malfoy, at your service, your Majesties, Prince" Draco greeted the king, queen and Prince Harold, although not bowing deeper than he had too. Many noblemen fell on their knees tonight in hopes to gain favour, but Draco couldn't care less. He didn't need the King's favour. He would let Lyra marry a nobleman of proper standing, but even the thought of Lyra catching Prince Harold's attention was ludicrous. She might be pretty and witty, but so were many else. She wasn't special and Draco had no illusions of her becoming the future Queen, no matter what Mother said.
"Maybe," she says, shrugging, "His name is on my list. But we can only know if we can find the Parselmouth."
"Well, you have three minutes until curfew. I'll suggest, you hurry up, Mr. Potter," he drawls, and Harry winces and curses himself for staying out so late. Hermione would have his head if he would lose house points for his tardiness. Snape follows Harry's back with his eyes for some time until he turns around the corner and left the dungeons. He cast a quick Tempus, noting with satisfaction, that he finished his rounds for today and left for his own quarters with something like a leap in his walk.
to feel comfortable around my best friends." The tears were running freely now. Ron looked a bit guilty, but Harry refused to feel bad for it. Ron hadn't been outright talking badly about Draco, but he would make suggestions about Draco's behavior that made Harry wonder and doubt. He should have talked to Draco instead of showing up drunk and dump that over Draco's head. And look where that got him!
"Would you like to have a glass of wine with me tonight, Potter? It's been so long since I've been in Hogwarts, I'm in need of a tour guide." You batter your eyelashes at him, a move that always lets you pull whoever you want, but Potter glares at you.
.Â He had always prided himself to be unattached, aloof and passionless about his partners, his lovers. Whether they left him first or he left them, he would carry on with his life, unaffected.
Malfoy came down a few times, always cleaning and feeding him. He expressed his concern that Potter would find out about it, that Potter would hurt Malfoy, but Malfoy only gave a thin-lipped smile in response.
"As you know, my father intends to let me marry for love and he never specified the gender of my future spouse," Harry said with a wicked grin, "And something tells me, that he already likes you very much. I'm sure, he won't be against it."
"I can't! He has a spell on me, he will know where to we leave, it's too dangerous!" Malfoy explained frantically and his stomach was filled with dread.
The Yule Ball neared and Draco tried pathetically to scout his rivals. Harry was interested in Cho, Draco could see that, but the Gryffindor was to shy to do something about it. Draco laughed at the absurdity of it all. He was sure, that Harry wouldn't like him back, but he looked for signs anyways. After he dropped a few hints here and there, which proved to be pointless, he gave up. Either Harry was deadset on being his nemesis, or the boy was just dense as hell. Draco tipped on the latter, but he had no evidence to back that up.
"But not yet. He's amusing, you know? He pretends, he doesn't like the pain, but he comes from it. He craves it. These days, I don't even have to touch his cock," a satisfied grin morphed his face and he almost looked pleasant, like the boy he knew from school, "I only have to grab his hair, bite his shoulder, or slap him across the face. He's a
"She's pleased with you as well. You've shown your manners and your abilities before and you're known for your wit and knowledge. She wanted someone wise for me, not beauty." Harry smiled at his mother, who returned it with a regal nod. That's why she had been watching Draco so intently. He had been judged, not Lyra.
"Thank you, your majesty," Draco said and slightly turned to observe his sister. She was still courtysing as she hadn't been allowed to rise yet. Normally that was left to the queen. She was judging all the young maidens tonight, observing their manners and looks, sorting through them, while discarding the unsatisfactory like old clothes. But Queen Lily wasn't looking at Lyra at all. Her attention was still on Draco and he allowed himself to look slightly confused. Her warm smile didn't ease his concerns.
The subject gets older and older and with every experience he makes, his heart grows heavier and his mind a bit darker. His moments of happiness decreased until they were nonexistent and the god wonders, why he never noticed. When the subject was still a child, he visited him quite often, sometimes over a thousand times a year. But now, he sees, he hasn't visited this subject in over three years. He briefly puzzled, if this was the will of the goddess of destiny too. If he could feel resent, he probably would. This is the closest he can get to human emotions. But he refused to give up on this subject. He was a challenge, a test he was willing to take and confident to pass.
"Yes, of course," he drawls, "I am Professor Malfoy and I teach the Art of Potions. I have been working here for the last five years, a pleasure to meet you." He doesn't add anything else and leans back. Potter huffs. "I already introduced myself, but sure. I'm Harry Potter, I teach Defense. Also been here for five years."
"-and I think, that would be a great idea. What do you think, Professor?" Now they are both looking at you, McGonagall more exasperated and Potter amused. You make an effort to close your mouth and swallow. Damn him and his sexiness.
"Shall we then?" Draco asked uselessly and escorted them into the snake pit. Their names were announced and several of Draco's acquiantances turned their heads to greet them with a toast. Draco smiled in return, left Mother with her chatty friends and then introduced his sister to the royal family. As the momentary head of house it was his responsibility to represent the Malfoy name and so he bowed in front of the royal family and waited for King James's command.
"You'd be surprised, darling," he smirked, kissed him soundly on the mouth and didn't react to the sharp inhale on the other side of the table.
"Well, you want him to love you, don't you?" Ron asked, his finger again in Harry's face, "So go out there and do it."
"He's not a witch," Draco adds, and the potion master narrows his eyes, daring Draco to continue, but the Slytherin knows no fear with him, so he says, "and he's a half-blood as far as I know."
"He's just not very welcoming to you," he says and Draco nods his head in acknowledgment. Weasley really wasn't that friendly. Granger had surprised him with the studying and he appreciated her. But Potter was the nicest of them all. He even started conversations now. Draco looks at his feet. Should he make a joke about it? He decides to tell the truth. He defended Draco in front of his best friend. Potter deserves that much.
"No, I- I'll dance with you," he stuttered and took the offered hand. Harold's smile widened just a bit before he smoothed his face out and he brought Draco to the dance floor. They bowed to each other and took their positions. Draco wondered, wether he should lead or not and he couldn't decide, because his head was all hazy with panic. But the Prince just gently took Draco's hand and placed it on his shoulder.
"Did you behave while I was gone?" Potter asked, stroking his chin, where the bruise was. Malfoy had healed it the night before.
"Potter has to watch him wherever he goes and I cannot see Potter anywhere," he says, sure of himself. Draco wants to chuckle, but he keeps quiet because Madam Pince
"A pleasure. May I say Harry?" you ask with a flirty smile, a bit startled when he takes his hand back abruptly.
Draco watched with anticipation, how Harry would react to his letter. He put his heart in it, it's the most honest thing Draco had ever written and he ached for an answer. But his confidence crumbled, because after the letter finished his hissing, Harry just looked at it, without any sort of expression. The Weasel tried to grab it, but Granger was faster. She attempted to read it again, but Draco charmed it so that only Harry can read it. But the Gryffindor just shrugged and took it back from Granger to leave it in his pocket. Draco is crushed. He had hoped for any kind of acceptance or rejection, but Harry didn't react to it at all. Draco hid his face in his hands. This was embarrassing. Not to mention humiliating. He hadn't felt this sad and dejected in a long time. Blaise eyed him and then stared at the Gryffindor table.
"If this is the kingdoms future generation, then we're sailing to good times, indeed," was all he said, before leaving Draco, who stood there gaping like a fish. His companions had praised his genius, but it had been an accident, really. He hadn't planned on gaining the King's attention, nor was planning to do so now.
"Do you remember, in our First Year we had detention together?" Harry asks and lets himself just hover over the branches. Draco nods.
"It seems, my dove went and did something unnecessary," Potter said and he wanted to spit on him, demand for him to free Malfoy, but Potter didn't look angry. He realized that he hadn't seen Potter angry yet. He was always enjoying himself, patiently, but he was never annoyed.
You avoid Potter after that dreadful interaction after the meeting. It's not very hard. You see him at dinner, once again engaging Malfoy in a conversation and you wonder, why they're on such good terms. You've learned, that Malfoy is head of Slytherin (of course, that stupid git) and Potter head of Gryffindor and the rivalry between these two has always been public knowledge. You try and snoop a little bit more, but the older Professors are strangely tight-lipped about Malfoy's and Potter's relationship, so you bet on Longbottom. After two glasses of wine, you struggle to steer the conversation to the heads of Slytherin and Gryffindor.
"Would you be up for that?" Harry finally asked and Draco had to wonder, why he didn't just demand it. Draco would never be able to deny him anything, whether about him or anything else.
"You are nothing like Hermione said you were," Harry mumbled and Draco felt the resentment creeping in his lungs.
The Headmistress doesn't say as much, but she is clip and efficient with you, not warm and friendly as before. She shows you your quarters and classrooms and gives you a map with all of the main locations, namely the Great Hall, her office, and the rooms of the other Professors.
"He confronted me. He thought I was the secret admirer. He grabbed me, wanted me to speak Parseltongue, but I refused and he just... connected the dots, I guess. He doesn't know, it's you, Draco, but I think he expects it. He wanted me to tell you something," he explains but best friend's eyes stayed locked on his lips as if he's scared he's gonna miss something if he doesn't look.
So Potter hadn't come down in days. That fact itself was great. That meant no pain, no torture, no manic laugher, and no stories of war either. Those were all good arguments, why he should be glad, that Potter stayed away.
"You won't leave me, would you?" Harry asked, his voice muffled in his neck. Draco tucked his face forward, pressing a firm kiss on his lips.
It's an unusual sight, something to worry about. He himself is surprised. It's not an expression he ever saw on himself. Despite that, he could feel his eyebrows furrow and his mouth twitch.
"Draco. First and foremost: thank you. I appreciate your apology and you're right. Even if it doesn't help, it's still a comfort. To me at least," he smiles encouragingly, "and I want to say sorry too. I saw you suffer and I still had to follow you into that bathroom and I still had to
"Of course I know Parseltongue, every Slytherin knows, what that is, Potter," Zabini appears to be annoyed and taps with his foot on the stone.
He entered the Leakey on seven o'clock sharp and noted, that Harry wasn't there yet. Still caught up in work apparently, so he let his gaze wander to find Granger at the very end of the establishment in a secluded area. Courtesy of the owner, Draco supposed and made his way through the tables and smoothly avoided legs in his way.
He wanted to hit something. He was seriously debating throwing the inkpot at the wall to see if heâd feel any better when something strange started to occur. The splash of ink on the diaryâs parchment began to dry, and as it dried it sunk into the paper like a ghost into a wall, and disappeared.
Harry felt rather awkward, explaining what had happened to one of his best friends and the Lady Malfoy, but he kept as many of the details as he could out of it. He kept it to the basics: he had been in his room, he had woken frightened from a nightmare, his magic had sent him onto the street, and he had run away. He didnât want anyone to know about the Dursleys, let alone Draco and Narcissa. He didnât think he could stand it â the disappointment on their faces, knowing that he had let the Dursleys hurt him, let them lock him in a cupboard, knowing he hadnât done anything to stop it. Even thinking of it all brought a hot flush of shame to his cheeks, and he carefully turned his head away under the pretence of examining the room so that neither Draco nor his mother could see.
.â Light began to emanate from his wand, just in time for Draco to drop down, followed by Hermione. âAlright Longbottom,â Blaise looked at the tough, dark plant they were sitting on with disgust. âWhat is this?â
I'm pretty nervous about this chapter honestly :/ Thank you for all the kind comments by the way, you guys are wonderful and I'm so pleased you like what I write! <3
âAnd then to Fortescueâs?â Pansy suggested. âThey have a new flavour in, did you hear? And itâs the perfect weather for ice cream.â
âSo can you solve it?â Blaise asked, leaning against the table. âBecause I donât really fancy staying here much longer than we must.â He eyed the black flames covering the door behind them.
âYour father will get Hagrid fired,â Harry reminded him, lifting the lantern Hagrid had given them a little higher and snapping his fingers to call Fang a bit closer. It was awfully dark in the Forbidden Forest, after all.
his Muggleborn friend, but Harry had insisted. Hermione was intelligent, and she was his friend â she deserved to know about their adventure the night before, and maybe help them work out what a damned Cerberus was doing in Hogwarts. Heâd only gotten Draco to agree by threatening to just go to the library and discuss it without him. Blaise, as per usual, was unbothered.
No one spoke until Madam Hooch returned. Harry wasnât sure if it was pride or fear that made Weasley and the other Gryffindors keep their silence. He hoped it was the latter.
âMaybe itâs just a social call,â Millicent suggested. âYou said he was awfully fond of you last time, wasnât he?â
Millicent snorted. Sabre started at the sound, but soon went back to attacking the charmed string above him.
Because of this collection of perfectly normal happenings on one perfectly normal morning, Harry felt that it was going to be a good day. After all, he had long ago learned that his aunt and uncle loathed anything
With her hands on her hips and a look of fond, exasperated concern on her face, she said, âI think we may need to have a talk, young man.â
(by his association with Draco or his fame, he didnât know) and the sudden change was frazzling his nerves.
The parchment began to shimmer, getting brighter and brighter until it enveloped the whole book, window-like.
Flying with Adrian Pucey, who was a chaser for the Slytherin Quidditch team and probable captain once beater Marcus Flint graduated, was very different to flying with Draco and Blaise, Harry found. For one, Adrian was very obviously a much better flier than Harryâs friends â constantly using tricks Harry had never seen before to throw Harry off, and dodging the automatically charmed bludgers with a greater deftness than Harry could even dream of having. Yet when they finally returned to the ground, Gemma cheering from the stands and the snitch in Adrianâs hand, the third year was grinning.
As soon as he was gone, Harry read every single one of his letters. Then he searched his room for the broken stub of a pencil he had been allowed, and scratched out replies, explaining his whole situation and how he hoped they were well. At the end of Dracoâs, he added:
Moaning Myrtle rose a little higher until her ghostly shoes landed several inches above the floor, and drifted around Lockhart towards Harry with fluttering eyelashes and a lopsided smile. âHello, Harry. What are you doing here?â
In this way, Harry passed his days until Christmas morning. Despite knowing, logically, that he did have friends who would send him gifts, Harry was still shocked by the large pile of presents he found at the foot of his bed when he woke up on Christmas day. He dressed faster than light and settled down to see what his friends had gotten him.
âIâll be fine, really,â he gave her a reassuring smile before turning to his Blaise, Draco, and Theo. âIâll see you guys back in the Common Room.â
âs Most Charming Smile Award, he proceeded to quiz the awaiting students on his favourite subject â himself. Pansy and Daphne both excelled at the topic, much to Millicentâs disgust and the rest of Slytherinâs grudging appreciation. After all, points are points, regardless of how theyâre attained.
He turned back to the waiting Slytherins with a small smile. âYou might want to find some chairs â we have a lot to tell youâ¦â
And two, Harry and his friends were not the only students eavesdropping on the teachers that evening. Across the hall, sitting in an alcove and looking alarmingly pale, was Ronald Weasley.
A few minutes later, Harry was moving silently about the kitchen preparing breakfast for the Dursleys. This would have been strange in most households (as he was only ten) but for Harry, this too was normal.
âHey, youâre Hadrian Potter, arenât you?â the red-head asked, eyes locked on the spot where Harryâs scar was hidden beneath his hair.
Behind him stood a young woman with bright red hair and familiar vivid green eyes, next to a man with messy black hair and glasses. Harry didnât have to note the similarities to know who they were. Plenty of books recording his history contained pictures of his parents, after all.
The world burst into green, magical fire tickling Harryâs skin as the world turned upside down and sideways and his body attempted to turn itself inside out-
âSo Tom Riddle will know something about the Chamber from last time,â Blaise concluded. âThat would be useful if heâd actually written anything about it.â
âSo,â the Gryffindor began slowly, âIf I could get some older students to come with us. Then youâd take me to the Chamber?â
The world inside Tom Riddleâs diary was strange â blurred softly around the edges, the colours muted and the torch-light dimmed, as if the whole scene was simply a dream. The setting, however, was familiar: a Hogwarts corridor, just outside the Great Hall. Harry was so distracted by his abrupt change in surroundings that it took him a moment to realise he wasnât alone.
âBut Hermione is incredibly intelligent,â Harry argued. âShe fixed my glasses with a second year spell. You canât say sheâs less intelligent than
The twins jumped to their feet, wands drawn in front of Ginnyâs body. Harry noticed, absently, that her chest was rising and falling â alive, then. Funnily enough, he felt like it was him who was struggling to breathe.
âHello,â Harry said quietly. He wasnât entirely certain why he did this â Harry didnât overly like talking, and had not quite broken out of the silent habits of his younger years â but once again, he did not question it.
âIâm sorry, Uncle Vernon,â Harry said quietly, gaze on the ground. He took a chance and continued, âIf I could just let her out for an hour or two-â
to heal his nose after he broke it on the marble floors â Harry had felt terrible, but at least it had made Draco laugh.
Harry didnât comment on Dracoâs stutter. He just tightened his grip on Dracoâs hand â for through all of this, through everything, through his lecture and this awful, tense discussion â not once had Dracoâs hand left Harryâs own.
The group grew closer, and sure enough as they approached the hulking shape became clearly hollow â though no less ginormous.
Harry blushed. He hoped the flush from the match disguised it. âThanks, Millicent. Ecklehurt was really good, too.â
A sharp bark of laughter was his reply, before Blaise shook his head with a significant look at Draco and Harryâs locked fingers. âIâll leave you two to chat. Make no mistake, Harry, you and I will be having words later â but Iâve got something Iâd better see to myself, and somehow I donât think Dracoâs going to be any help.â
Draco did not look at all pleased with the idea of going to see the groundskeeper, but nodded. âHeâd better not have an Acromantula these days.â
For a moment, Harry thought Tom Riddle was going to draw him a picture, but then the pages of the diary began to flutter wildly until coming to a stop with the words:
Harry gave Weasley one last look. âFirst floor bathroom, ten minutes,â he managed to get out, before the four turned the corner, and the other boy passed out of sight.
Harry pulled back just to meet Dracoâs eye. âYouâll be alright. Both of you. Besides,â he quirked a small smile, âI donât think anyone could make Lady Malfoy do something she doesnât want to â not even you.â
Tom shook his head. âMonsters donât make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside.â He lifted his wand, aiming directly at the box â the box which seemed to beâ¦ clicking?
âOh how Iâve missed your impeccable manners, Millicent,â Daphne rolled her eyes. âThis is my sister, Astoria. Sheâs going to be a firstie at Hogwarts this year, so sheâll be staying with us until she settles in. Though
Blaise smirked, though Harry thought it looked slightly forced. âNeutral. My mother doesnât care for wars.â
If she had been pale before, Petunia became as white as the paper she held now in one death grip claw. Her other hand shot to support herself upon the kitchen bench as she swayed dangerously in one spot. Her eyes flicked wildly down the single page, and she let out a single sound best described as a squeak.
Hermione made a compassionate sound in the back of her throat, and Neville gave Hagrid an awkward pat on the arm â or rather, the back of his palm, as Neville couldnât reach any higher.
she had been crying alone in the bathroom, and when he heard, he was nothing short of furious. Ronald Weasley had no right to attack Hermione, calling her a snooty know-it-all â
Harry tried to keep up with their conversation, but the split speech was giving him whiplash. Still, he found the boys quite funny, and they seemed kind enough. Plus, they loved to talk, which made up quite nicely for Harryâs own quiet nature. Once Harry was settled in a compartment, however, they had to go.
â someone shrieked, and Harry looked up as the troll did to see its club hanging, loose, in the air above its head.
âAnd that,â said Blaise, âIs why we are here. To let him know. To make sure that when everything goes to shit, he has connections that will keep him alive and not completely at the Dark Lordâs mercy. Iâm sure we can all agree we want that?â
They chatted of their classes and teachers for the rest of the walk. Hermione was enjoying every class, it seemed, though she held a sort of hero-worship for Professor McGonagall, and looked on with slight envy when Harry told her how the professor had collected him from Number 4 Privet Drive. They were both very excited for Potions the next day, though Harry had gotten the feeling from the feasts and the speech in the Slytherin Common Room that Professor Snape didnât like him all that much. Hermione dismissed the idea, and Harry didnât push it, but the feeling remained.
The door swung open. Albus Dumbledore stepped inside, grim-faced, and behind him a squat looking man in a pinstripe suit.
The twins happily took over keeping their wands trained on Lockhart while Harry approached the sink. He felt nervous, and not because he was willingly walking towards a Basilisk. He could feel the weight of his friendsâ eyes on him, not to mention Ron and the twins and even Lockhart and Moaning Myrtle. The pressure was on him. If he couldnât do this, maybe the Slytherins wouldnât judge him but the Weasleys certainly would â it would be on him if something happened to Ginny because they couldnât reach her. It would be on him if she died.
Harry had forsaken the Muggle world as cold and unforgiving, but no world was free of that. There were plenty of Uncle Vernons, magic and muggle alike â plenty of Aunt Petunias who stayed silent when they shouldnât.
âI quite think thatâs a conversation for when we get home, dear,â said Narcissa, before fixing her stare on Gemma once more. âThis is a substantial favour youâve done for Hadrian, Miss Farley.â
Harry clenched his hands into fists behind his back and twisted them together to keep himself from running. Instead, he walked slowly around the Mirror, putting the sheet of glass and metal between him and what remained of the Dark Lord. It wasnât much, but it was something.
Hannah Abbot. Harry had talked to her in Transfiguration just last week. She had smiled and chatted with him â heâd thought sheâd seemed nice.
Millicent Bulstrode was one of those, and she shook her head. âThatâs all well and depressing, but I donât know what you want us to do about it, Blaise. Weâre of no use against the Dark Lord, at least not until we reach maturity.â
Harry looked over. The woman talking was tall and slender, with sleek platinum blonde hair and fair skin. She was beautiful â and the spitting image of Draco.
Harry could barely focus on the memory â his mind was racing, trying to explain what Tom Riddle was showing him. It just couldnât be true! Hagrid had frightened him initially, sure, but after getting to know him, it became clear that the groundskeeper wouldnât hurt a fly. He had been kind to Harry and his friends; theyâd all thought he was totally benevolent. They couldnât all be wrong, surely?
âAnd my dad was really grateful for the photo of you, Iâve been telling him all about you, but could we get one of both of us because he really wants to see me with a celebrity you know, and-â
Millicent snorted. âNo ratting you out, remember? Anyway, heâll be fine, itâs just petrification. Now, more importantly, are you going to the Duelling Club?â
As it turned out, Draco knew every single Slytherin in their year. Harry was introduced to a dark-skinned and stoic Blaise Zabini; an arrogant and beautiful Daphne Greengrass; a grumpy Millicent Bulstrode and her equally grumpy cat, Sabre; a quiet boy named Theodore Nott; a brown-haired Tracey Davis; and the girl who had distracted Draco at the Feast, who Harry learned was Pansy Parkinson.
âWho threw a book at you?â questioned Tracey, moving further into the room and grimacing at the water soaking her shoes.
He walked casually back to the Slytherin table, ignoring the stares he got as he sat down. Draco very obviously wanted to say something, but apparently decided against it considering Harry had only just gotten out of the Hospital Wing. Pansy had no such qualms, but Draco silenced her with a glare.
âWait, wait, wait,â Millicent frowned. âBut then, if a Basilisk kills just by making eye contact, how come people have only been Petrified?â
âHow is the Hufflepuff bestie by the way?â Millicent asked, picking up a protesting Sabre once again. âDid you find out anything about her?â
âItâs true then,â Tracey frowned. âThe Heir â whoever they are â is going to target humans. Muggleborns.â
No one spoke to him, despite their staring; not even Draco Malfoy. Harry didnât think it was entirely Dracoâs fault, however, as a girl with dirty blonde hair and an upturned nose was happily clutching at his attention.
Harry already liked Lady Malfoy, but his affection for her skyrocketed at the journey Aunt Petuniaâs face went on while her eyes scanned whatever Narcissa had written.
âSmart owl you got there, kid,â John commented. âFollowed me all the way from the Owlery until I stopped here. Say, what kind of runaway has a bird that fancy?â
âItâs alright, Hermione, breathe,â Harry thought quickly, before taking a step closer to her so they wouldnât be heard. âOkay. Meet on the third floor tonight, alright? You bring Neville â you have Herbology next, donât you? â and Iâll bring Draco and Blaise.â
âWhy, exactly, are we going into the girlâs bathroom?â Ron asked as Harry moved forward, prodding Lockhart ahead of him with the tip of his wand. âI think the teachers wouldâve found Ginny already if she was just hiding in a bathroom. Thereâs nothing but sinks and loos in there.â
Harry had not seen the other girl at first, trailing behind Daphne as she was. She was small, a wisp of a thing, with wide green eyes and blonde hair in two neat plaits. Her features matched Daphneâs almost exactly, and yet it struck Harry that they looked nothing alike. Daphne Greengrass had the arrogant tilt to her chin that most rich purebloods carried â she walked with the confidence of someone who knew without doubt that she would always get her way. The stranger, on the other hand, hid behind her mirror image even while they were standing still, and clasped their hands together so tightly the knuckles of her small, delicate hands turned white.
They were halfway back to the Slytherin Common Room when Harry realised with a curse that, caught up in his musings on the Chamber as he was, heâd left his bag in the library.
A harsh, squeaking sound came from the structure in front of them, the squeal of porcelain and copper piping moving, shifting, as the sinks parted and rearranged before the groupâs eyes, grinding against the stone floor and making the whole bathroom shudder. When it was done, what was revealed was a massive, circular chasm in the floor â a pipe, leading deep into the centre of Hogwarts.
âGather round, gather round!â Lockhart beamed charismatically from upon the makeshift duelling stand. Somewhere in the mass of students, a girl fainted. âCan everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent. In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Duelling Club, to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves â as I myself have done on countless occasions, of course. For full details, see my published works.â He winked down at the crowd.
âI donât trust Dumbledore as far as I can throw him, Drake, but did you see him at the end? He knew we were here. He wanted us to keep figuring this out. And Hagrid, he said to follow the spiders.â He looked around and quickly pointed at a window. âThere, look.â
Hermione hummed, chewing on a stray piece of hair that had wandered too close to her mouth, brows furrowed in thought. âDid the first door have any locks?â
However, because of a very old man named Albus Dumbledore (and, indirectly, the imprisonment of a man named Sirius Black and the wild grief of a man named Remus Lupin), Hadrian James Potter had nowhere else to go after his parentsâ deaths, and so he was placed with a man and a woman who hated him, and a child whose screeching almost made up for Harryâs silence â and there Harry stayed.
Harryâs first thought was Snape. He was harsh, and unfair, and hated Harry for a reason he still couldnât understand. Butâ¦ he didnât want to jump to conclusions. That was how mistakes were made.
Harry almost wanted to laugh. Face-to-face with Voldemort, at this bloody school, again. He almost wanted to cry. He very much wanted to scream.
,â Hermione said confidently, and there was a snap as Harryâs glasses clicked back together. Hermione peeled the tape off carefully, and then handed the fixed glasses back to Harry with a bright smile.
âDid you hear that, Harry?â The other boy practically jumped on him once Adrian had left. âHe wants me to try for the team!â
Draco looked about ready to yell at Dumbledore himself, but a staying hand from Narcissa kept him silent. Instead, he clutched Harryâs shoulder under his palm. âItâs not long to go, now,â he said.
âHeâs your Cerberus, isnât he?â Harry leant forward, excited. âYou own the Cerberus on the third floor.â
âDid you have any questions for me?â Dumbledore continued genially. âBefore I return your friends to you? Misters Malfoy and Zabini in particular have been quite eager to visit as I understand it, but Madam Pomfrey knows best about when itâs time to allow visitors.â He smiled patiently.
Now that he knew where to look, finding the same names in the brightly coloured (and much more clearly laid out)
to raise the club, and Harry distracted it while I cancelled the charm so the- the troll was knocked out.â
âHarry!â Hermione tore down the hallway the next day, bag shaking dangerously and hair flying wildly behind her. âHarry! I talked to Professor McGonagall, but Dumbledoreâs gone! He was sent to London, the Ministry called him urgently!â
Harry just shrugged again. They were probably going to prank Lockhart anyway, just for being Lockhart. He doubted it had anything to do with him.
Harry cocked his head, already bored with Longbottomâs incompetence. If there was one thing he had in common with Severus Snape, it was a deep set hatred of people who allowed themselves to appear weak â people like Neville Longbottom.
Narcissa turned to Harry next. She knelt before him as she had Draco. The marble floors of the Manor were perpetually spotless, but Harry had to resist a nervous glance at her dress nonetheless.
century in return. Pansy and Theodore he sent their respective favourite sweets to, and they returned the gesture. Millicent bought him a book on the deadliest (but still legal) curses of the modern age, in return for his gift of
It was all very embarrassing, and Harry thought Ron probably agreed with that too, because his cheeks were a deep pink, and he looked rather moody.
Harry landed on the ground with a thud, pain shooting up his arm, and felt a rage that he hardly recognised rise within him. Something tingled within his chest as he glared at his cousin and then the next second, the glass between Dudley and the snake had disappeared, causing the large boy to fall into the enclosure in an undignified heap.
Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing, Filchâs cat is attacked. And that first year Gryffindor Creeveyâs been annoying Potter for weeks. Then Creeveyâs attacked.â
Tom was still monologuing. âI fashioned myself a new name,â he bragged, âA name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.â
Harry rubbed his eyes and yawned, taking a moment to remember where he was â remember what had happened. âComing!â
âHagrid!â Dumbledore finally managed to interrupt the groundskeeperâs frantic yelling, and gave a calming smile. âI do not think that Harry attacked anyone.â
The second floor was flooded with water, and on the wall above lay a message, written as if in blood.
âShe wonât wake,â said Tom Riddle. Despite his bodyâs incorporeality, his voice rang strong and true.
Harry glanced from Daphne to Blaise and back again, before saying, âI was quite tired, actually. I thought Iâd head to bed early.â
Harry turned and nearly fell as Myrtle rushed towards him, playing with her hair and biting her lip. âIf you die down there-â
Fitting both him and Draco beneath Harryâs invisibility cloak proved to be a slight challenge. They had to squish together, and twice just getting out of the dorm he stepped on Dracoâs foot. They got into the swing of it eventually however, and made it out of the castle without a hitch - although Draco seemed remarkably flushed the whole way.
Daphne leaned forward with an eager smile. âOh no, she isnât. And even better, rumour has it Snape is going to âhelp him with the demonstrationâ.â
âI said you could go get Snape if you needed to, didnât Blaise show you my note?â Draco argued back.
There was a girl with bright red hair â another Weasley, Harry guessed â standing behind them, who lingered after they walked away. Harry gave her a smile, but she just turned red, and quickly ran after her brothers.
His cousin didnât seem to notice. âItâs your birthday,â Dudleyâs cruel smile widened. âAnd nobody cares.â
Harry let his head fall back, panting. He could see a crowd rushing toward him, and groaned. Hermione reached him first, and he realised suddenly that it was her spell that stopped the Bludger.
âSpeak for yourself,â chimed in Pansy, achieving a frankly frightening amount of anger in her very short form. âIâve been pissed off! You went to the Forbidden Forest and you
âGuys,â he said. No one listened, so he said it again. It was Neville who drew the attention of the room, however.
Blaise looked at him a moment longer, before nodding. âAlright. You need to learn to control your face.â
That, of course, is when he decided to release said pixies, and subsequently, when it all went to Hell.
The situation was sickeningly familiar. It seemed Harryâs ability was strange, even for wizards. He was a freak in every world â Muggle or Magic. The realisation churned in his stomach like sludge.
There was one interesting development, however â Hermione and Harry brought a newcomer into their mini study sessions. Just a week after the Cerberus incident, Tracey Davis cornered Harry in the Slytherin Common Room and told him, rather snootily, that she would be accompanying him on his trips to the library from then on. Harry might have been annoyed, had he not seen Traceyâs look of relief after he gave his assent. Harry was no stranger to insecurity, after all.
Not Sirius Black on the other. Harry didnât know who Andromeda was, or why she would eventually be struck from her family tree, and at that point he really didnât care. The words on the page were so cramped, finding Narcissaâs name had seemed impossible, let alone another. Harry looked up from the book with a sigh. The bedroom door was blurry. He blinked to readjust his eyes, but succeeded only in worsening his headache.
Quirrell tugged at the covering of the object, removing it without ceremony to reveal something very familiar â the Mirror of Erised. Seeing it, somehow, sent a stab of pain through Harryâs scar.
âHadrian James Potter,â Draco snapped anxiously, âI am not dying in a stupid forest from some stupid spiders, I bloody well am NOT.â
Still, it wasnât a huge thing. Heâd never known his parents, he reasoned, and so it made little sense to spend a whole day mourning them when he could be doing other, more productive things. So Harry spent his day as normal (classes, mixed in with the occasional lecturing from Draco and Daphne about the original wizarding Halloween celebration of Samhain), and by dinner time had almost gotten himself excited for the holiday.
âIn your own time,â he heard Ron say, impatient, behind him, but his friends snapped back quicker than Harry could overthink it:
The silence after Snapeâs speech was apprehensive. The entire Slytherin House was on edge, waiting for something unknown â but Snape simply turned with a swish of his black robes, and stalked out of the Common Room.
Harry didnât think about the Incident after that. He didnât want to â every time he remembered crying like a
Of course, facing off against Gryffindor meant facing off against the Weasley twins, and Harry met their eyes with caution. He thought they were on good terms, but Fred and George were fearsome Beaters, and the mischief in their matching grins did not speak of good things for Slytherin. Besides, Harry remembered with slight worry, he still owed them a favour for taking care of Norbert the dragon.
Harry glanced at his friends. âIâll need all of you to agree to this. If you donât want to come thatâs okay, nothing will be held against you-â
Harry didnât care enough at that moment to question the evasive answer. Neville was the only one who had noticed his and Astoriaâs discovery, and he was watching in baited silence from Hermioneâs other side. Harry unfolded the parchment. It read:
âI was seconds, SECONDS from going to get Professor Snape, you know that right?â Daphne snapped at them from their spot next to the fire. The Slytherin Common Room was empty besides their little group, and despite the berating he and Draco were receiving, he couldnât help but feel quite touched that every one of his friends in Slytherin (with the obvious and painfully tangible exception of Theo) had waited up for them.
âI should think youâd be more grateful,â Vernon snapped, turning a single pudgy finger on Harry. âWe raise you since you were a baby, give you food off our table, even let you have Dudleyâs second bedroom â all out of the goodness of our own hearts.â
Harry thought she might have continued, but she seemed to become aware of his presence then, and took a deep breath to steady herself.
They emerged as one through a patch of trees into a small, dark clearing. Right in the centre lay a small, silver pool.
Hogwarts was the most beautiful thing Harry had ever seen. It rose high into the sky from the childrenâs view crossing the Black Lake (which Draco very confidently told Harry contained a Giant Squid, because his father had said so). The inside was just as aweing as the outside, and Harry was very pleased to see Professor McGonagall was the teacher who greeted them. He gave her a large smile, and she nodded to him slightly in return.
Harry tried not to scowl at the reminder of their failed flying lesson. By the time Madam Hooch had got back, there had only been enough time left before lunch to hover a foot or so above the ground for a bit, and so no actual flying had taken place. Harry still felt remarkably cheated.
And then Dudley was screaming behind the reappeared glass of the enclosure, and Petunia was shrieking, and Vernonâs face was fast turning purple as his beady eyes locked with Harryâs, and Harry felt the stirrings of fear begin in his stomach.
how they managed to do what they did. No, itâs not all book signings and publicity photos! You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long, hard slog.â
Snape's monologue and questions from Potions class were taken from the film. I have no real reason for using the movie stuff over the book stuff - I just felt like it, and that scene is fairly similar in the two anyway.
Fudge appeared quite flustered. âNow, see here, Lucius â Dumbledore suspended! No, no, itâs the last thing we want right now... If Dumbledore canât stop these attacks â well, I mean to say, who can?â
âLove, Hadrian. It is love.â He stood then, and moved over to the table of sweets. âAh! Bertie Bottâs Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffeeâ¦â He tossed the sweet in his mouth and chewed thoughtfully. âMm. Alas. Earwax.â
The woman in question looked like she might collapse. Her face was white and even tighter than normal, and her eyes flickered quickly between the three magical folk in the front hall of her home.
The ensuing silence was broken when a tiny figure entered the Slytherin Common Room â a tiny and familiar figure.
The troll was lumbering forward angrily, so without thinking Harry struck it behind the knees with every hex he had been taught. Before he could tell Longbottom the counter, however, someone was already crying out:
âI am terrified,â Harry hissed to his friend as they walked out onto the pitch, gripping the handle of the new Nimbus 2001 tightly.
âHarry,â Blaise said. His voice was quiet, almost soft. For a second, Harry hated all of them. His friends stood around him, none too close, all gentle with him like he was fragile. Like he could break at any second. Like him breaking would be a bad thing, when all he was now was a burden.
The tips of Harryâs fingers touched cheap plastic, and the memories of the day before crashed into him like a freight train. Lucius Malfoyâs trial, Gemmaâs warning, and Dumbledore. Dumbledore ripping the warm safety of the Manor from him with unrelenting cruelty wrapped in twinkling eyes.
Harry would be returning to Hogwarts â of course he would, especially now he knew his friends still cared about him. Heâd deal with this âplotâ when he had to. For now, he simply held the stack of letters close, and didnât bother to keep his grin off of his face.
Harry downed the potion in one, gave his friends a last wave goodbye, and stepped through the flames.
âOf course, itâs wonderful practice for you,â Lockhart continued. âThereâs a lot you can learn from me, Harry. Fame is a fickle friend. Celebrity is as celebrity does â remember that.â
âWell- I-â he stuttered a moment before falling into sullen silence, arms crossed petulantly across his chest.
I know I only mentioned this briefly in the chapter, but if anyone is interested, my ideas on wand usage vs. wandless magic are basically that a wand allows for better refinement of a spell â makes it easier to control how strong the spell will end up, where it hits, etc. (e.g., a bombarda cast at a cup with a wand by a reasonably talented wizard channelling a small amount of force can be used to explode just that cup, but the same spell cast wandlessly with the same intended amount of force by the same wizard has a much higher chance of exploding not just the cup but the table itâs sitting on too). The reason young witches and wizards have better chances of successfully using wandless spells before they are educated with a wand is because their magic is still running almost entirely on instinct and imagination â as you age it becomes more difficult to access that imagination and that instinctive link to your magic, so wandless magic becomes harder and casting spells becomes more academic / intellectual than it is instinctive. It is possible for a grown wizard to learn to cast wandlessly after being trained with a wand, but it requires a very strong force of will to direct the spell and channel the correct strength into it, and most wand-trained wizards just donât bother because generally the main advantage of casting wandlessly is in battle â something they donât expect to be engaging in very often, if at all. Wand usage isnât universal in the wizarding world, however â various cultures around the world donât use wands to cast and grown adults trained this way have no difficulty. The difference there is that the spells created in wand-using cultures are designed for use with a wand â they require a certain amount of specificity and refinement that generally relies on a wand being used as a channelling tool. Wandless culture spells are not created with wands in mind, and so require less specificity and focus / rely more on intent within the caster. Both have advantages and disadvantages, neither is âbetterâ, theyâre just different. I imagine that generally wanded spells are more useful for delicate work, while wandless spells have more power behind them so can have a bigger impact because they arenât designed to need to pass through a channel - there is no instrument in the way of the magic and the target. This doesnât mean wandless spells canât be used delicately and wanded spells canât be insanely powerful, itâs just a little more difficult. None of this is really relevant to the story, I just like thinking about it. Ok thatâs enough of me nerding out! I have no idea if JKR wrote anything on the subject and if Iâm contradicting her at all, and frankly I donât give a shit lmao.
âYes,â Voldemort replied in his raspy, nails-on-chalkboard attempt at a voice. âYou see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite.â Disgust coloured his tone. âUnicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket.â
âUh, hiya Hadrian,â Longbottom shifted uncomfortably. It seemed he didnât know how to speak to the Boy-Who-Lived after theyâd battled a troll together. For once, Harry didnât blame him for it.
Harry spun around at the same time the stranger did. They were met with a familiar face to Harry â Albus Dumbledore, though much younger than in Harryâs time. Harry straightened at the sight of the Headmaster but, like the boy, Dumbledore did not appear to see him.
Petunia stared at Narcissa for a moment, eyes flickering from her aristocratic features to her wand, held just slightly forward so as to be hidden from view of the street â but in plain view of Petunia. Then, her gaze landed on him.
âIâll get the ingredients, you set up the cauldron?â Blaise suggested. The calculating look in his eyes from the Hospital Wing was back again. Harry tried to ignore it.
That, too, was fantastic news, though Harry wouldnât feel quite right until heâd seen every single one of his friends with his own eyes. Especially Hermione and Theo â the image of them in this very Hospital Wing, pale and ice cold to the touch, still lingered, nightmarish, in the back of his mind.
The promises of a pair of twelve year old boys are not usually held in high regard. One may reason that young boys are impulsive, and prone to making promises that they cannot, or do not actually want to keep. One would, in most cases, be correct in that reasoning â but not always. The promises they speak of are fleeting â they mean little in the short-term, and next to nothing in the wider timeline of the universe. Â But sometimes, just sometimes, a promise â a true promise, made by people of any age so long as they are true in heart â can change that timeline; can change
âIâm saying you need to practice. Shut out your emotions. Learn to keep your mask up even when it feels like you canât.â Blaise leaned forward. His eyes were black and cold.
âGo?â If Aragog had had lips, Harry thought he might have been smiling. âI think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders soâ¦ willingly, into our midst.â The massive creature clicked at them once more, retreating back, into the shadows. âGoodbye, friends of Hagrid.â
The polite answer caught Professor Snape off guard, but he quickly recovered. âTonight, in my classroom.â
The books that Narcissa had sent for Harry turned out to be on magical family trees. A simple guide for reading magical genealogy charts; Wilmott the Wildâs self-updating
âWhoâs there?â Hagrid asked into the night. He held a crossbow drawn and aimed almost exactly at where Harry and Draco stood beneath the cloak.
The area just outside the clearing was free from spiders and was instead full of familiar creatures with the head and torso of humans, bare-chested and fierce-eyed, and the lower half of horses.
âNo, sir,â Dobby wrung his hands. âMaster Draco doesnât know Dobby has come. None of them do, but Dobby had to warn Mr Potter.â
There was a thud behind them, and Harry spun to find Lockhart, robes covered in muck, collapsed onto the ground.
âYes and no,â Daphne said, flipping her hair back with a frustrated sigh. âArabella Winters is stupidly ordinary and nowhere near as afraid of the things she should be. I donât know what Astoria sees in her.â
Harry promptly flopped back down. The mattress groaned and took revenge via a loose spring stabbing into his shoulder.
There was silence for a moment. âIâll be your friend forever, Harry,â Draco declared eventually, youthful determination colouring his voice. âIâll always be your best friend.â
âFor a price, Longbottom,â Harry said. He tried very hard not to roll his eyes at the obvious confusion on the other boyâs face. He was working on his mask, after all.
âSo youâre telling me,â Blaise said after they had finished their tale, âThat the Dark Lord of the last great war is hiding in the Forbidden Forest, keeping himself alive with the blood of unicorns, and plotting his return?â
Harry watched, frustrated and annoyed as Neville Longbottom â the same nervous Gryffindor who had blown up his cauldron in their first Potions lesson â cried out as his broom lifted him up into the air, before he promptly fell off onto the hard ground. There was a sickening
Harry shook his head and tried to ignore the sound his shoes were making. âRemember, any sign of movement, shut your eyes straight away, alright?â
But Christmas break came, as it must, and Harry found himself facing a whole new dilemma. For the first time since coming to Hogwarts, he would be without his friends. He liked being alone, sure â but there was a big difference between choosing solitude and having it forced upon you.
Harry jumped out of his skin when a hand landed on his shoulder, but he felt nothing but relief when he looked up to see two sets of warm blue eyes staring down at him.
Snapeâs face was tinged an odd shade of purple that reminded Harry rather strongly of his Uncle Vernon. His fingers tightened on his thigh and he shoved that thought away.
Harry had heard enough. There was an anger boiling in his chest at the Hufflepuffsâ words and he knew if he didnât leave that second he would storm into the classroom. Perhaps it would serve them right â they wanted a Dark Wizard, he could give them one.
Perhaps if Harry had been raised in different circumstances, he would have grown up to be a very different man.
Draco swallowed. âNot good enough. Any other ideas?â He drew his wand anyway, casting a weak light with the hastily stuttered spell.
Harry caught the twins exchanging a look above his head, but he pretended not to notice. Even if all three of them survived this, there was no telling in what state Fred and George would find their sister. Loneliness panged at him again, but he shoved it down.
Hermione looked at her reproachfully. âHeâs probably just worried about Harry â heâs the Headmaster, itâs his job to look out for students.â
Dumbledore leaned forward to pat his knee gently. âYes, Hadrian. It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.â
Halfway through lunch, Hermione and Theo arrived â together â to walk to their respective tables. Most of the school stared at a Slytherin and a Muggleborn walking alongside each other, but if either of them cared, they didnât show it. Theo settled in opposite Harry (who was as far from Daphne as he could get), unsurprisingly non-expressive.
I hope you don't mind some of the characterisation of 12 year olds. I was an incredibly dramatic 12 year old and I think that shines through.
Harry closed his eyes. His throat was tight; he thought he might cry. âHow do you know all this stuff?â He managed to ask, once his voice returned to him.
Lockhartâs startled look morphed into a glower as he eyed the burnt stone walls and damaged artworks. âThose blasted ginger twins happened, if you must know. Been targeting me all year â jealous of my fame, I suppose, Iâm used to that sort of thing, but setting off fireworks in my office really was just too far. You see that portrait, there?â He pointed to one of the more tattered works, merely a few scraps of canvas hanging from a charred frame. âThat was worth thousands! Although plenty would have paid more for it, of course, with my smile and signature put on there. Those little Gryffindors shouldâve been expelled for their mischief, and that dastardly poltergeist disposed of with them â whatâs the miserable little creatureâs name, Peeves? Oh, I know theyâre in cohorts, plotting together to try and tear me down, but really, how is it my fault that Iâm stunningly handsome and beloved by all? Honestly, I could have given them tips on their look if theyâd just asked, starting with those
Draco looked at him disapprovingly. âAt least let me write a note to Blaise. Hagrid must have an owl around here somewhere, right?â
Snape didnât look pleased at the interruption. âRegardless, it caused great disturbance. Detention, Mr Potter.â
Harry simply smiled at him, wide and genuine and at peace. âDo you know, Draco â Iâve never been better.â
Harry supposed that was true. It didnât make facing the other aspiring Seeker on the pitch any less terrifying.
âYou lot are missing the point,â said Tracey, tapping on the table nervously. âWe know Harryâs not the one attacking students-â
Harry nodded once, gripped Dracoâs fingers tighter in one hand and Fangâs collar with the other, and they followed the herd in silence to the edge of the Forest.
âHarry? Harry, are you okay?â Draco sounded frantic. Harry was more concerned with the fact that he sounded muffled.
âNo, Harry, I donât want to hear it! You canât keep walking away from me â from, from Blaise and me, from all of us, into ridiculous danger like some tragic hero, and expect me to be okay with it! You promised you would be more careful, do you even remember?â
The crowd shuffled away to the locker rooms, the victorious with whoops and shouts, the defeated with murmured condolences. Harry lingered nearby to wait for Draco. He caught the words âNimbus 2001â before his friends met him on the pitch.
âDracoâs parents were alleged Dark supporters in the War,â Blaise explained, though Hermione frowned slightly at the âallegedâ. âLight supporters still donât take too well to the other side, even now.â
âIt was,â Neville told him. He seemed a touch more confident than usual â or maybe that was just his grin. âBut we needed Nott to do the enchantment, because Hermione wouldnât, and Zabini made Malfoy decorate.â
Quirrell stumbled backwards, screaming in pain, but Harry wasnât done. He had found his weapon, he would damn well use it. Stumbling forward, Harry lifted his hands to Quirrellâs head, putting one on Voldemortâs face and one on Quirrellâs, watching with a vengeful grin as the professor and Dark Lord screeched and disintegrated, until with one last press of Harryâs palms the thing that was Quirinus Quirrell fell into ash.
âWe donât have to worry though, right?â Pansy said with a shrug. âI mean, everyoneâs saying that the Heir is only going after Muggleborns.â
There was a small voice in Harryâs head saying this was a bad idea. Heâd planned on avoiding any breaking of the rules after his horrible detention with Snape, and sneaking out past curfew to go flying without a teacher present
âThis is out of my hands, Mr Potter,â said McGonagall, not unkindly. âMr Filch, will you take care of this, please?â
The corridors were empty and shadowed with the students off at dinner. Harry kept his footsteps as quiet as possible against the stone and listened carefully.
The Lady Malfoy smiled at him fondly and pressed the palm of one gloved hand against his cheek. She lowered her voice so it wouldnât carry to Draco â though Draco seemed more focussed on his breathing and his mask. âThank you for being here for my son, Harry. If it gets too much, let me know.â
âHarry?â Blaise was watching him, dark eyes concerned while he kept his features expressionless. âAre you alright?â
Harry blinked. Where was the wraith? What happened? Had this centaur saved them somehow? How much time had he missed?
âWith pleasure,â Pansy leapt up from the floor, and the two strode up the stairs to their dormitory together.
âIâm sorry, Hedwig,â Harry murmured sympathetically. He could understand the feeling of being in a cage. âYou know I canât use magic outside of school.â
It was everything Harry had wanted it to be, and more. He swooped and dived and did loop-de-loops around his friends for what felt like hours, and decided then and there that there was nothing heâd rather do than fly
Somewhere to Harryâs left he heard someone snicker â Pansy most likely, knowing the competitiveness both Harry and Draco harboured â but he tuned it out.
The shadows of Hogwarts Castle seemed darker than usual on their return trip, but no one said anything, and they made it back to the Common Room without incident.
âThe Chamber of Secrets was created by Salazar Slytherin when the founders built the school,â Draco explained with a sigh at Hermioneâs ignorance. âBut he closed it and hid the entrance when he was cast out. Itâs said he hid some sort of monster in there, but no one knows what.â
go âgallivanting off to fight giant, ancient magical creaturesâ, much less without reasonable adult support â â
Tracey put her hands on her hips and glared. âMyrtle is always crying. Sheâs a ghost. We canât exactly help her stop being dead.â
Nonetheless, Harry was thrilled to be meeting up with his Slytherin peers. As much as he enjoyed Dracoâs company, he had still missed his other friends. Narcissa was unable to join them, though she left Dilly with strict instructions to make sure the children bought all their school equipment, rather than getting distracted by things like âthat shiny new broom.â That had sent Draco into a tangent, of course, about the improvements of the Nimbus 2001 from the previous yearâs model. Harry quite liked his Nimbus 2000, and didnât see the point in buying a new broom when his current one worked just fine â but that didnât mean he couldnât admire its statistics.
There was always wandless magic, but the older Harry got the more difficult the little tricks he had practiced before he started Hogwarts became to perform. Something about losing an instinctive link to your magical core - Hermione had been very interested in the subject last year, and Harry remembered her talking about it, but honestly heâd stopped paying attention in favour of a funny face contest with Pansy across the library table. (Pansy had won, but sheâd cheated; sheâd nicked a sweet from Tracey that made her nose glow blue, then stretched her tongue up to it and crossed her eyes in a particularly gormless manner. Millicent had let out a startled laugh at the sight, and Harry hadnât been able to resist joining in. Lesson learned â in a contest with a Slytherin, never expect them to fight fair.)
He moved quickly, following the murderous whispers around the castle, fingers to stone and an urgency building in his chest, moving faster and faster until-
The Great Hall erupted into screams as Quirrellâs turbaned head hit the floor. Draco let out a squeak from Harryâs left, and across from him Pansy looked like she was going to cry. On his right, Blaise was cursing in a language Harry didnât recognise.
The massive creature paused, and although Harry could not see its pupils, he could feel the spiderâs gaze as it locked on the two frozen boys on the edge of its clearing.
âHere you go,â he said, handing it over. âRoom 41b, itâs on the third floor, to the left. Iâm John, by the way. Whatâs your name, kid?â
âAh, âadrian Potter! I was wonderinâ if I might be seeinâ you,â Hagrid greeted them. âAnd âoo are yer friends, then?â
âIâm Colin Creevey! Can I call you Harry? Iâm in Gryffindor, but Iâm going to talk to Professor Dumbledore and see if I can come to Slytherin, wouldnât that be fantastic?â Colin beamed.
Fudge shook his head. âBad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come, you see. Four attacks on Muggleborns, and that pureblood boy â things have gone far enough. Ministry has to act, you understand.â
Hagrid winced at his mistake. âNow, listen, I reckon you three should âead off. Donât go meddlinâ in this, itâs dangerous, alrighâ? Off tâ bed with you.â
Tracey and Millicent were collecting themselves by the door, and watched them pass in confusion, but Harry didnât bother responding to their questioning stares, because Hermione had gone red. Her eyes were suspiciously wet.
But â seeing how Narcissa had reacted helped, just a little bit. And she had said he would never go back there again. He wouldnât have to see the Dursleys ever again. He wouldnât have to deal with Uncle Vernonâs violent anger, or Aunt Petuniaâs wilful ignorance, or Dudleyâs petty bullying. That wasnât his life anymore.
The library seemed quieter than usual a few evenings later. Harry sat with Tracey and Hermione at a back table, books on their chosen study subject of the night â Transfiguration â spread out in front of them. The only sounds to break the silence were the occasional turn of a page, and the scratching of quill against paper as the female Weasley â Ginevra, Harry remembered â scribbled in a small black notebook a few tables away.
âOw!â Draco rubbed his side, but reluctantly continued. âButâ¦ it was good thinking. Well done.â He glared at Harry. âAre you happy?â
âYou were angry, and your magic reacted accordingly,â Gemma explained. âItâs not too uncommon, but it was pretty impressive. You made everything in the Common Room shake, and then it was like an earthquake ran through the dungeons. Everything was floating, and you seemed really- well, out of it, honestly. And then you passed out.â
, he supposed), and Harry wasnât certain he did, either. After all, it was the day his parents were violently killed by a mass murderer, and as much as he tried to block those memories out, he could always feel them, hovering at the back of his mind, waiting for his attention.
Harry waited for the rush of shame at the confirmation that Draco knew his awful secret, but it did not come. His friendâs eyes were too kind, too understanding, and instead, Harry felt warm.
Despite the excitement of the â now much larger â group of second year students, there wasnât all that much they could do in terms of discovering the identity of the Heir of Slytherin besides watch and wait, and so life went on essentially as normal.
Harry remembered his father, too, but James Potter had died out of Harryâs sight. Somehow, the connection didnât feel the same when he hadnât witnessed his death.
Harry lifted his hands to Quirrellâs, desperately trying to pry Quirrellâs hands off his neck. But then there is smoke, everywhere, and it is originating from the professorâs hands.
Possibly, Harry thought, he shouldnât be enjoying this as much as he was. The disdain in his auntâs eyes hurt, still â it certainly cut far deeper than Harry wanted it to â but there was a touch of fear there, too. If Harry ignored, for a moment, that tiny part of him that still wished desperately for any inkling of affection from his closest living family, he could acknowledge that Mrs Dursley being frightened of a simple letter was pretty funny.
âHermioneâs family are Muggles, too,â Harry said quickly, ignoring Hermioneâs subsequent glare. The diversion didnât work â in fact, Harry suspected that once again, Colin hadnât even noticed.
Once again the investigation was put on hold, though this time it was for a combination of reasons. One was because they simply had little idea of where to go from there â they had no idea of what was taken from Gringotts, after all, though Draco swore he would ask his parents for anything he could get over Christmas, what with them both being involved in the Ministry; and Pansy promised she too would ask her mother, who was the Chief Editor for
âOkay. Then we get Fang,â Draco snapped, grabbing Harryâs hand fiercely and tugging him towards Hagridâs dog.
Harry sighed, and pushed the memory away. He dragged the single threadbare blanket the Dursleys had given him further over his chest. Outside the world would be warming up, summer in Surrey humid and bright, but inside was still cool from the night time chill. Harry missed the Manor and all its inhabitants like a lost limb.
That night, Harry snuck out of the Slytherin Common Room. He had already decided on what he would do with his new cloak, and that was explore the castle as he had never been able to before. He steered clear of the third floor, of course (he didnât want another Cerberus incident, at least not while his friends were away), instead roaming the halls and corridors, dodging Filch and Peeves and Mrs Norris. The thrill of exploring was awfully exciting, and he carefully ignored the little Hermione-Voice in his head that was lecturing him on the danger of rule-breaking.
Harry tilted his head to his left with great difficulty, and was met with yet more grinning Weasleys. The twins, it had to be said, looked remarkably good for having fought a near-invincible spectre of Lord Voldemort, teenage or no. Fred â and Harry was sure it was Fred, now â had one arm wrapped in plaster white resting on his chest, and Georgeâs movements were nearly as slow and pained as Harryâs own, but they were incredibly, unbelievably, alive.
Shockingly enough, it was a familiar face that stopped them, one that would have at any other time been most welcome, and she wasnât looking for the Malfoys.
Harryâs fingers clenched on his leg, but he kept his eyes fixed on Snapeâs shoulder, head bowed slightly in submission and his face blank. âThere is no difference, sir. They are the same plant.â
âHadrian,â Gemma Farley met his eyes over Dracoâs shoulder, âWhat in Merlinâs name were you thinking?â
Harry shifted uncomfortably. âItâs nothing, really. I just think it would be better if I went alone.â
Their presence was an olive branch that Harry would not accept â until Hermione got her apology, he refused to be friends with them.
âThat settles it, then,â said McGonagall. âWeâll leave it to you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy â your skills, after all, are legend.â
Draco pulled back to hit him on the shoulder, and wiped his face with his sleeve. It came back suspiciously wet.
Before the conversation could move to more important things â such as Harryâs status as a suspect in the current series of attacks â Hagrid burst out of a side door by the gargoyle, still clutching the dead rooster Harry had seen him with earlier.
Fudge watched after him, befuddled and mildly concerned, before leaving, knocking the door shut behind them as Fang began to howl.
âPlus, we really want to know,â Pansy whined, sitting on the edge of his bed to lean against Millicent.
Punishment settled, Snape removed a small vial from his robes and handed it to Madam Pomfrey, ignoring her disapproving looks, and swept from the room.
The Gryffindor looked like he was about to apologise again, but Professor Sprout had apparently decided theyâd had enough time to catch up.
âWeâre several floors up with no riskless way of getting back to the Common Room,â Blaise rolled his eyes. âIâm not certain that counts as safe.â
âNo!â Harry interrupted her, before lowering his head. âIâm sorry, I just- I donât think we should go there.â
The chestnut centaur stepped further forward with another shake of his hair. âThe spiders attacked our foals,â he snarled. âWe hunt for revenge, not to save wizard lives when wizards care so little for our own.â
Once again, a few bits and pieces were either paraphrased or taken directly from the script of the movie. I'm sure you can recognise them.
Then, to top off a truly enlightening first class, he introduced them to their first creature of the year.
Daphne flushed pink and scoffed. âGoldstein isnât even on the team, heâs a total bookworm. You should be setting him up with Granger over there.â
âAh, yes. Halloween was when I discovered you could be a danger to me â and Snape proved himself.â Quirrell turned, staring at a tall, covered object against the wall. âI let the troll in, but Snape wasnât fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone.â
Hagrid to be fired. He was sweet, in his own way, if a bit too emotional (and a bit too big) for Harryâs comfort. But he didnât want to start a fight with Draco, either â so he simply changed the subject.
The remaining twenty minutes of the class were a mess. Both sides of the classroom, Slytherin and Ravenclaw, banded together in an unusual and impressive display of school unity to spell the creatures back into submission after Lockhart abandoned them (though Harry noticed Vince and Greg in one corner, attempting to punch a trio of pixies for trying to steal their cupcakes). Harry and Hermione ended up back to back, stilling whole groups of pixies at a time with a widened
âYou learn,â Blaise said simply. âYou find a method that works for you and you use it when you must.â
âNot really the issue right now, Pans,â Tracey placated. âAnd quiet, all of you. We donât want to wake up the whole House. But really, Draco, Harry, that was quite possibly the stupidest thing youâve ever done.â
Then he was gone, and Harry was left with his heart in his throat and his nails making crescents in his palms.
If asked to recall the way to the Headmasterâs office from that dreadful corridor, Harry would have had difficulty answering, despite his much better than average memory. He certainly could not tell you how long the journey took, but soon enough McGonagall was speaking to the stone gargoyle guarding Dumbledoreâs office:
Harry lowered his arms from around his head and shakily pushed himself upwards. He swayed on his feet and nearly fell over, but caught himself on the lamp-post just in time. What the Hell had just happened?
Lucius Malfoy was the least of his concerns at this point, however, because the Slytherin team had now reached the centre of the pitch.
Hagrid flushed further. Harry fumed - Dracoâs father or not, Harry wanted to jinx the hell out of him.
âWhy would he throw something at you?â Hermione asked from the door. Harry took a second to be thankful she and Tracey could put aside their arguing before he turned his attention back to the ghost â the ghost who was still far too close to him. He quietly took a step back.
allowed to the zoo. He had been to the library, once, but other than that knew very little about the entertainment Little Whinging had to offer. He wasnât entirely certain whether to be excited or afraid.
âOh Harry, darling,â Daphne leaned forward, patting his hand over the table. âYou have so much to learn.â
âYes,â Voldemort rasped as invitingly as a horrific face on the back of a skull could be. âJoin me, Hadrian.â
he rationalised. The important thing was that his friends accepted him as he was, Neville and Hermione included. Even Gemma had told him in a mock-whisper in the Common Room that this just meant he was a badass, and Adrian had seemed- well. He had asked if Harry
Draco was silent, too, waiting for Harryâs response with something almost like anxiety in the tap of his shoe against the floor.
Harry was rushed out of his thoughts by the whistle of air, and flung himself into a barrel roll just in time to avoid a Bludger to the head.
âTroll!â the professor screamed, sprinting into the Hall faster than Harry thought he could move. âTroll! In the dungeons!â
old people,â Daphne said, flicking her hair over her shoulder. âThe important thing is: what was in it?â
Hermione and Neville both agreed to visit Hagrid with him, and that night after dinner the three of them marched down to the groundskeeperâs hut.
âAbout the school as well?â A look of fear flashed across Tom Riddleâs face, gone as soon as it came. âThey wouldnât really close Hogwarts, would they, Professor?â
The questions stopped. Gemma Farley was standing on a table â understandable, considering her small stature â and glaring at her House.
âDobby,â he began, carefully. âIf you give me the letters, and unlock Hedwigâs cage for me, I will promise not to go back to Hogwarts this year.â
âWhich means it is time for you three to go,â Madam Pomfrey said, uncorking the vial. âMr Potter will be ready to join you at breakfast.â
But not quite. Harry entered the Slytherin Common Room (feeling rather sorry for himself, of course) to meet the cheerful grin of Gemma Farley.
The gargoyle lifted its wings in what perhaps was meant to be a welcoming gesture, and McGonagall gently pushed Harry onto the platform within its wings. The ugly snarl of the creatureâs mouth seemed even more menacing up close.
Before Harry knew it, the game had begun. Slytherin hit it off with an early lead. Their brooms were obviously superior to the Gryffindorsâ, but Harry couldnât help but admire their flying. They were good â the Slytherins, it seemed, were simply better.
Harry stared as the two left, followed quickly by his other friends until it was just him and Blaise in the hallway, Neville and Tracey giving him sympathetic smiles as they left, while Hermione gave him a tentative hug and a âgood luckâ.
Draco practically glowed. It sounded like a bribe to Harry, but it wasnât hurting anyone, and if it made Draco happy, then â why ruin that?
âOh great deduction, Weasley, because no one else ever has ever been a Parseltongue in the history of wizardkind-â
âHadrian Potter,â Firenze said, calling back Harryâs attention. âThis is where I leave you. Youâre safe now. Good luck.â
âI donât know,â Harry replied. He carefully ignored the insulting comment. âGryffindor have been playing well this last season, and the Weasley twins are easily the stronger beaters, but Hufflepuff have the better seekerâ¦â
âBut we canât just let it go, either,â Neville murmured. âThat could be- could be You-Know-Who through there, or at least one of his followers.â
Lockhart began to count, and before the third number had entirely passed his lips Snape was moving â a cobra mid-strike, he shouted:
âProfessor Lockhart, it seems, suffered quite a touch of memory loss during the rock fall you found yourself under â he has been transferred to St Mungoâs, indefinitely.â
The Gryffindorâs mouth dropped open in shock. âI- I mean, youâre welcome, you were, you were really brave too. And- and loyal, to Hermione.â He swallowed. âI mean, the other Gryffindors donât say many nice things about you â especially Ron, but â theyâre wrong.â
Harry glanced at Draco, shifting uncomfortably on the balls of his feet. He didnât really like big displays of emotion â especially displays of sadness. That had never gotten Harry anything but more pain. Thankfully, Draco didnât look particularly pleased with the situation either, though whether it was for Harryâs reason or something else, he didnât know.
. Harry was exhausted by the end of his first round, but pleased â he had just barely beaten Higgs to the snitch, meaning he would sit out the next trial match, and play the winning Seeker in the finals. The winning Seeker turned out to be a sixth year Harry wasnât familiar with, by the name of Wynona Ecklehurt. She was lean and fierce looking, nearly twice Harryâs height. On a positive note though, Draco informed him (still riding cloud nine at having been given the Chaser position after the first match), Flint and Ecklehurt had dated the previous year. Ecklehurt had broken up with Flint, rather publicly, and broken his nose while she was at it (though no one seemed certain why). The point being, Draco continued, it was impossible that Flint was harbouring positive feelings towards Ecklehurt after that stint.
Daphne grimaced. âNot precisely the words I would have used, but I suppose the message is the same.â
âIs it dead?â a lanky boy behind Gemma asked curiously, poking the trollâs leg with the point of his shoe. The troll let out a loud, shuddering snore. âOkay â apparently not.â
. At first Harry thought it wasnât enough, but then the troll swayed forward dangerously, and slammed face first into the ground, cracking the tiles beneath its force.
Harry huffed, and promptly put the Hat back on its shelf. A choking, gagging sort of sound caused him to spin, and he had approximately two seconds to take in the sight of a sickly looking bird on a golden perch before the creature burst into flame.
Work was, beyond doubt, as friendly as ever. His department manager dumped eight stacks of paperwork on his desk before heâd even set foot into office. He stifled a sigh and set himself to work, tired but determined all the same. Didnât turn at the hushed conversation two desks down. Didnât turn at an argument outside of the doors, a muffled
A part of him, locked deep where sunlight couldnât penetrate, screamed desperately at being back in the same place all over again. Drowning in sorrow, in memories he couldnât touch if he reached out. At having spent so long, so long, tryingâtrying to move on, only to turn his head and find himself in the same place still.
They disappear into the room, the door shutting behind them. Harry stays for one second, two seconds, before turning and leaving the buttery yellow walls.
He gives up on the letter and picks the kitten up, flopping them both onto the bed. The kitten lets out a startled
He still went to the barn with Potter. The cold winter air cleared his head, as did the lifting of his heavy legs. Today Potter would, like every other day, collect the sheep that had recovered well enough and send them back to the fells. Draco was ready to head to the back and chat with Cho when Potter eyed him, and then tasked him with bringing Cho to the front of the barn.
Dracoâs head shot up. Potter skimmed the letter, lifted his gaze as well. âTheyâre threatening to sack you. Why did you not tell me?â
Heâd only started cooking because Astoria cooked. Baked, more like. Macaroons, Battenberg cake, chocolate truffles, crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©eâ¦she served all the desserts theyâd have with their tea, arranged them carefully on tiny porcelain plates accompanied with tiny forks. Because of this, she only allowed the use of the fine china tea set gifted by Narcissa on Saturdays, and started working in the kitchen as soon as the clock struck two in the afternoon. Sheâd cover herself in flour with her hair tied loosely into a bun, her wand tucked behind her ear. Draco made it his mission to steal one from her and had never once succeeded, always batted away and once hexed as soon as he laid a finger on a madeleine.
A Border Collie barked and straightened, alert. Potter scratched its ears as he headed to the back. The barn was bathed in warm lights, brighter than the grey, quiet morning outside. Draco followed Potterâtaking his time to finally feel solid ground underneath his boots againâstopped when Potter crouched in front of a baaing pen, and there they were.
He never used to like French onion soup. Rather, heâd never had it, but he thought he wouldnât have liked it much had he tried. But Draco cooked well, which was unsurprising because he had always been good at potions, but at the same time surprising because he cooked Muggle and, well, Harry felt like he should have been the one who cooked better since he had been cooking practically his whole life.
Everything was distant. Draco shouted and gripped his hand in the other as Potter bellowed commands for Lettuce to stay down. Draco tried to examine the wound, hissing. Potter gently pried it from his grip.
Draco let out a breath. His mother was jesting, of course. But there was, for once, no need to remember his life outside of the gardens. No need to remember the charity balls he still had to attend, the hands he still had to shake, the stack of papers he still had to look over. No need to remember the sneers passersby threw and the condescending glances. Just a summer evening with his mother, having tea in the gardens. He let out another breath, and closed his eyes, too. Bathed himself in the faint scent of roses and the warm air. Sank himself deeper into the chair.
A Healer comes out from behind one of the doors, checks her clipboard, and looks up. Harry hurries forward; it is their turn now.
Harry shrugs. The kettle whistles from the kitchen. Luna unplugs her wand from her hair and waves it as Harry pushes the empty plates with crumbs to one side, a bag of sunflower seeds and a half-empty mug to the other. The kettle settles into the space and quiets, humming.
He pushed himself up. The sheen of sweat had plastered his clothes to his back, had left him cold. The pot of rosemary sat by the window, bathed in the winter glow. Draco pushed his hands into the heavy quilt. The curled vines that once came to life in the warm firelight were silent, nothing more than a pattern in the cold winter light.
â so Potter threw him a sweater and a thick pair of pants last minute. They, like Potterâs scarf, smelt faintly of sheep and were much warmer than his own clothes. The sweater hugged him gentle and loose, and Draco couldnât stop tugging at the tiny fuzz balls where the wool was rubbed rough.
Potter laughed. Draco smiled, humming, tracing the chipped edge of his mug. It hadnât been there when he first arrived. He couldnât recall when heâd dropped it, or bumped it, or clashed it against the corner of the sink, the table, the windowâhe wept, then was overwhelmed by affection over the tiny chip and was laughing again, the corner of his eyes still wet. He laughed at the coats dumped onto the rail, at the soot smeared over the left corner of the rug, at Potterâs socks. They were dotted with tiny long-eared owls with large, round eyes. Ridiculous. Potter laughed again, loud and clear. It was the clearest sound Draco heard all evening. At some point he picked Potterâs hands up and inspected them closely. With dumb fingers, he traced the rigid cuts that dug along the lines of Potterâs palmâa result of never hesitating before dipping his hands into freezing water in winter.
. It was minutes later that Draco realized, like a striking lightning, that Potter was not carrying him to the tractor but straight back to the cottage.
A flinch, a dimming in the burning green eyes. It was almost enough for the way his chest tore at the lie.
The fire crackled in the hearth, casting warm lights on the rug and dragging long shadows over the short legs of the table, over the scarves hanging on the rail. Over Potterâs knee, which heâd drawn close to his chest. He had settled in the armchair beside the couch, nursing a mug of cider himself.
âIâm sorry,â Harry whispers again. Strokes the plains of his cheeks, the soft skin under his eyes. âYouâre not your father. I promise. Look at you.â Swallows, âLook at us.â
Dracoâs cheeks burned. Harry laughed and pulled him in, as Draco burrowed his face into Harryâs neck. Harry curled his fingers into the short hair at his nape, stroked.
Dinner was finished and the rest of the bottle was enjoyed in front of the fireplace. They sat on the floor, Dracoâs back against the couch and Potter against the armchair, their feet touching. Draco couldnât help the chuckle bubbling at Potterâs ridiculous socks. He felt hot on the inside, his cheeks flushed from the wine and the burning fire.
The weekend passed peacefully. Draco spent the rest of the afternoon telling Myrtle about everything he went through: living under the same roof as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, his ownership of the infamous Elder Wand, his time in the newly-reformed Azkaban, and his new ârelationshipâ with Potter. Hours later, he went back to Merlin Tower, where Pansy and Theo set their minds to doing Dracoâs and Blaiseâs nails while a Hufflepuff girl from the D.A. remained nearby, talking to her friend. Both girls kept looking around for anything or anyone that looked like a threat to the Slytherins, so all of them relaxed with the extra pair of eyes looking after them.
âHarry,â Hermione pleaded. âYou have to take care of yourself! You barely talk to us; youâre just lost inside your head most of the time! That is not dealing with anything, itâs just bottling everything up and pretending you are alright
,â Theo cut in, batting his eyelashes to tease Draco, although the effect was diminished by his tiredness. Theo looked like heâd drop unconscious at any minute. âSo dreamy! Wanting to be your plushie and all-â
Pansy nodded at him. âI still canât fathom how she could have raised a wand to do that to a kid like Creevey, when I can remember her singing in the kitchen, or coming from the garden covered in mud and getting it all on dadâs freshly-pressed clothes. I canât put the two things together: the loving woman and the murderer...â
said it would happen eventually,â Draco swallowed hard, tugging carefully at Theoâs ear cuff, so as not to hurt him. âUsually Death comes after one of us Malfoys when we are older or struggling too much with emotions.â
Draco took a sip and sighed in contentment, closing his eyes to savour the complex taste of the thick liquid. It wasnât his favourite thing in the world, but it was one of his preferred comfort beverages for shitty days like this.
father? Many pureblood Death Eaters had gone mad. Dracoâs days in Azkaban had rewarded him the âprivilegedâ front row seat to their screams and curses.
âHow bad was it?â Blaise asked tactfully, gently touching Dracoâs wrist. Blaise was close enough to see the asphodels marring his pale skin.
Draco growled, snapping back at her, âDon't you think Iâm trying?â He adjusted his hair nervously. âAlso, itâs not exactly
âShields down, boy, so I can eat my breakfast before we have to go.â the brunette asked gently, motioning toward Dracoâs forearm when he opened his eyes.
âNot scheming anything!â he barked back. Hermione retreated a few steps, and guilt immediately overcame Harry. âSorry, sorry. I just- I wasnât doing anything wrong. Just wanted to grab a book and leave.â
Harry chided himself. Malfoy had spoken quite loudly. Harry noticed the other students start whispering to each other, and it dawned on him they were expecting a Malfoy-Potter showdown to happen right this moment.
Plants decorated the room, adding colour that fit perfectly with the mahogany furniture. The high-backed, button tufted, leather sofas were longer to fit more people. Cupboards and tables were scattered around the room.
?â Potter was talking again, but Dracoâs ears were ringing. Dracoâs eyes shot everywhere, trying to make sense of where he was. â
Petra Parkinson had gone missing after almost getting caught at the Battle. She had injured three Aurors that tried to imprison her, then fled from Hogwarts. Her face was portrayed in uncountable wanted posters around Wizarding communities. Many pureblood families had been affected by being known to associate with the Parkinsons, the Malfoys, and many others that were discovered as Death Eaters. Atreus Parkinson had been captured at his mansion to be brought in for interrogation. At first, he seemed innocent; then, a few drops of Veritaserum during his trial at the Wizengamot made Atreus spill how he covered for his wife, helped incarcerate Muggle-borns,
complained about them when I was finally allowed to visit her before coming to Hogwarts again,â sniffed Theo. An Jimin, a South-Korean pureblood witch well-versed in the Dark Arts, was Theoâs mother. Jimin had been incarcerated in Azkaban after getting caught at the Battle of Hogwarts.
âDonât look. Just-â Potter motioned toward the bathroom, but did not come closer to touch the blond. With a gesture, though, Potter vanished the bloodstains. âGo shower while I, er, search for your clothes. Where are they at?â No response. Draco couldnât remember how to speak yet. âOkâ¦ Uh, just go, Malfoy. Iâll fetch your things.â
Sometimes they grew so close to his skin that Draco himself had to be careful to not end up with slashes across his face and body. Not to mention his clothes, they always had to be repaired with a quick spell every now and then.
Blaise rolled his eyes and began to rub the towel over Dracoâs body. âMhm... so youâre finally admitting to wanting it all along.â
, and frozen Gringotts vaults, too. Some people were more fucked than others, but there was no doubt: they were all screwed.
âHe was never softâ¦â Theo mused, then looked to Draco from the corner of his pretty brown eyes. âI always envied you for that. Lucius was the one who looked harsh, but it was my father who raised his wand to punish his own son.â
Potter said, but his voice sounded far, far away, as Dracoâs blood seemed to thunder in his ears and consequently deafened most sound in the room.
The green fabric also covered the top of his bed, making Draco feel protected from prying, judgemental eyes. As it was his eighth year at Hogwarts â and his last one â and, as many seventh-year students had to come back to complete their graduation, the eighth years were separated from other houses.
âThis is just you advocating against us, Blaise,â said Pansy. âCanât believe youâre actually on their side rather than ours.â
want to,â Theo and Blaise chorused, smirking at him. âItâs all over your face, babe,â Theo gestured to Dracoâs blushing cheeks.
Draco was used to it. It has been years since he first saw the flowers that covered his skin bloom. The buds were finely drawn against the pale canvas of his skin, and in bland colours rather than lively. Draco remembered it was in sixth year the dead petals started to appear. Everywhere he went, there were flower petals falling to the floor. Besides having to clean up after himself constantly, the smell of rotten flowers made him sick.
There were 88 chapters full of information about the most deadly, fascinating anthology of curses Harry had ever read about. Just passing his eyes along the index, he read some interesting names.
âNo,â Draco said quietly. âNot entirely, at least. After everything, to have Occlumency fuck me over like that would be quiteâ¦â he trailed off with a humourless laugh.
When he looked up, Hermioneâs eyes met his. Harry quickly returned to the book. He was already four pages in. The Benedictus Curse was really a fascinating one, although it was quite gruesome. Holly Lungwort was quite a detailed writer; some cases she described had forced Harry to stop reading, sensing his lunch was threatening to return.
Abraxas had cautioned them about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named being the cause of their downfall, but Lucius had been too blinded by a possibility of power â and later, fear of the Dark Lordâs rage â to back down; Draco too, but by desperation. Together, father and son had dragged Narcissa and Alcyone down with them. The only one that had come to their rescue was Potter.
obvious. If it was James and Lily fighting on the wrong side, would Harry have had enough strength to fight them? Risk killing them? With dawning horror, Harry realised that this is what all the Slytherins had been thinking about while they hid in the dungeons that horrible night.
A chorus of âshhâ came from everywhere in the library. Harry was caught off guard and winced, making Hermione look at him triumphantly.
Zabiniâs efforts seemed to pay off because his prank brought a small smile to Malfoyâs face. Harry concluded Malfoy was laughing by the way his shoulders shook slightly. The blond also shook his head, as if heâd found ridiculous what Blaise was doing. Unfortunately, Harry was too far away to actually hear anything.
That made him smile at her, nodding his head slowly. âAnd I believe you.â Draco looked around without real interest, then continued their conversation. âWe got closer, yes. We agreed on a âtruceâ and, uh, heâs been helping me sleep ever since I had a panic attack in front of everybody,â his lips curled in a grimace. âEveryone saw me have a meltdown over some blood. The good thing is: at least he doesnât bother me much and I do sleep better with his presence. His magic is
On Monday, Draco saw Potter coming from a different part of the castle, where he presumed the Ravenclaw Tower was located. A bunch of first and second years were following him around like puppies, adoration clear as crystal in their eyes.
âWhich book?â Hermione inquired, the tension dissipating only a little; her shoulders remained tense, though. Her brown eyes descended to the cover of the book he grabbed and, after reading the title, she opened her mouth indignantly.
Instead of puncturing or tearing Malfoyâs clothes, the stems crawled from his wrists and enveloped his body from head to toe. The stems extended all around to better shield him, and Malfoy ended up looking like he wore a body armour made of rose stems. The thorns were silver, pointy and sharp.
Iâd never thought heâd go against my mum.â All three men stared at her, feeling like their hearts were about to come out of their mouths. They knew why Pansy was distressed. The whole Wizarding World knew, too. âI donât know how- how- he was tiny, and I canât stop thinking about how things evolved in the Battle, or- or how he got against her- I mean, bloody hell, he was
Harry went to the floriography section which listed flowers beginning with M. Harry put his finger on the page after finding the exact type, and read:
Draco mulled it over, then shook his head, âNot exactly. I meanâ¦ yes, there is,â Draco stammered, caught between his need to talk about Crabbeâs death and his lack of desire to do so. It was still a touchy subject for him. âI just donât want to talk about it now. I think Iâll- I just canât, Myrtle. Not now.â Draco decided and was relieved to see understanding in her eyes. âBesides, I donât feel comfortable on a broom anymore. And the game, all of it, seems kind of pointless. I donât know how to explain that, Myrtle. My heart doesnât beat faster when I talk or think about it now.â
Potterâs lips were healed from Dracoâs accidental head bump, but some tiny splits could be seen here and there that indicated Potter constantly chewed on his lips â but Draco already knew that. He always noticed how Potter mindlessly bit at his lower lip while thinking about something. Sometimes, Draco would catch him biting at his upper lip, which made Potterâs face look funny.
Or maybe he was just overreacting. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione, and they werenât marvelling at the food. It was a good thing he wasnât moaning at every bite like the first day of the term. That day, everybody had looked at Harry as if he had grown a second head. Better to conceal, although it was quite difficult to contain his joy.
what those flowers meant. Potter seemed thoroughly amused at Dracoâs lack of attention, though, which was both cute and infuriating.
Draco caught the way Theo was looking at Longbottom. His face betrayed nothing, but his light-brown eyes twinkled in a telling way. Draco nudged Blaise, exchanging knowing looks with him when he turned.
having to deal with his Curse. But he had managed and survived. He wasnât a bad person for trying to save his family from the wrath of the Dark Lord and the subsequent disgrace. He didnât even kill Dumbledore.
âOh, yes,â Myrtle pouted, her face scrunching up in a sympathetic expression, âIâve heard about it. The Fat Friar came to talk with me and he told me how other students were treating you and your friends.â
Draco stopped, feeling the entire process. He felt the soft petal that used his magic to spring into reality. The way it slowly took form and space, sprouting from his skin. He groaned and sat up, plucking out the yellow carnation petal from his neck before it fell.
âSince when has Death been fair to my family?â Draco pointed out. His friendsâ faces fell. âShe took them all too young, too soon.â
. It was an international scandal. A Dark Wizard vouching for wizarding dominance over Muggles and parading pureblood supremacy, when in fact he himself had a pureblood mother and a
Harry ran until he was hidden by the Forest, and once there he finally gave in to the pain. It felt as if his soul was splitting in half.
âI know now how you felt. And to think youâd tried all those years to make us stop buggering the Muggle-borns...maybe weâd not be harassed like we are nowadays if we had listened to you, T.â Draco uttered those words as if they physically hurt them, even to his best friends...
Harry Potter jumped away from the library shelf and looked up in surprise at the familiar voice. Hermione was at one of the mezzanines in the library, probably searching for a book. Harry blushed at being caught but pretended nothing out of the ordinary was happening.
Some days, Harry couldnât help but focus on the big things that happened. While sitting at night in his common room, he remembered every detail and every word Dumbledore spoke in Kingâs Cross. Harry would sit motionless, his green eyes fixed on something, like the movement of a quill, but unfocussed. The only thing he focussed on was the experiences in his mind. Specifically, how Snapeâs memories touched him profoundly. Harry had learned many things with those memories in the Pensieve. The ones Snape gave to him before he died from Naginiâs bites. And the more Harry raked his mind, overanalysing things he saw during his whole life, the more he ended up learning how nothing was black and white.
cause.â Pansy huffed, rubbing at her face angrily. âIâm still missing mum, butâ¦ Gosh, thatâs so complicated, I donât know how to deal with that shit.â
Blaise clicked his tongue, brushing an unruly white lock away from Dracoâs eye.Â âTone down the bitchy attitude, Pans. Heâs-â
âThatâs why I think itâs unfair what the others are doing to us,â Theo said. âWe never had a clear notion of what our parents were doing, but we still have to pay for their actions.â
âOld Abraxas was getting bad back then, wasnât he?â Blaise asked, using âoldâ more as a way of affection rather than an insult. âMy mum was shocked to hear of his passing. He was relatively young, for a wizard.â
âUh,â Draco looked from one boy to the other, not knowing if it would be rude of him to go with Potter and abandon Theo.
Dracoâs grey eyes were fixed at the cloth that covered his four-poster bed. The fabric was soft to the touch, so much that it comforted him when he couldnât sleep, like
âEvery time I saw him on the cover of the Prophet, in those photos theyâd got of him in the field, it would make me shiver. He looked furious,â said Blaise. âAnd his magicâ¦â
what one should do in some situations. Dark Wizards? You fought them, no matter what. McGonagall herding most of the Slytherins to the dungeons while the Battle was raging was completely justifiable. It was only later that it dawned on him what was
Draco made all the boys in his room scarce when he smashed the vase on the wall with a deafening screech.
âThe funny thing is,â Blaise began, attracting Dracoâs attention towards him. The black-haired young man intertwined his fingers with Pansyâs trembling ones, giving them a gentle squeeze in reassurance. She was as pale as a ghost, which made Blaise frown slightly in puzzlement. None of them wouldâve thought sheâd be affected by all that violence like that since she was much more vocal and aggressive towards Muggle-borns and their supporters. âOur parents always go on and on about mudb- er, Muggle-borns and how theyâre lesser than us, which ends up creating a monstrous picture in our minds, but when we come across one, they look soâ¦ normal. So ordinarily normal, like any of us.â Blaise was ranting; Draco knew because the handsome young man always rubbed his neck when he got carried away. Blaise was always cool and collected, but his nerves were revealed in small details. âIt always buggered me, how I was told to hate people I was used to seeing at school. People that I had classes with. Iâve always seen myself superior to them, but it never occurred to me theyâd be killed right in front of me.â
Embarrassed, Draco tried to hide his blush by turning his head back to the pens, seeking. âWhich one is Lettuce?â
The kitten meows loudly and calls Harry back to reality. He picks it up and unloads it onto his old, battered hoodie. It has become the kittenâs permanent bed now.
Harry toes off his shoes and, gingerly, follows Draco past the parlor. The air smells of a soft fragrance, smells faintly of something familiarâ¦
âAnd now?â Draco turned, looking at Harry as though for the first time. It hurt to see him, hurt to think that for seven years Harry had laughed and cried and grown into the man standing in front of him, and that he had missed that, that he had not been by his side. âWhen are you leaving again?â
âHey, hey. Sh. Whatâs up?â He blearily scratched her ears and checked the time. She had just been fed, so she shouldnât be hungryâhe pressed a hand to her belly. It was, as expected, warm from milk.
back to your house and fetch anything that will comfort him, of course. A plush toy, a blanket, orââ
âWeâre too old for this,â Draco says, even though he has said this a thousand times already, even though he is already standing up.
âbut it flowed effortlessly into his life like a stream coalescing into a river. It was like potions, in a way, the cutting and dicing and stirring and timing; calmed him, allowed him to breathe. A leftover of something he couldnât have properly. He soon cooked all their dinners every night. Astoria smiled at him as if she knew something he didnât, teased him about his apron as he placed the plates.
âFuck,â Harry whispered. A quick huff into the telephone, a broken attempt at a laugh. âFuck, Draco. I wantâoh god. I want to see you. I want to cook dinner in the kitchen with you, I want to wake up next to you in the morning, Iâ¦I miss you. So bad. Fuck, Draco, I miss you. I want to touch you, I wantââ
Thin, bonyâas he always has been, as Harry always has known himâyet in his arms, he is warmer than Harry has ever realized. Harryâs throat dries. His mouth opensâ
Harry sighs faintly and throws all thoughts away. He strokes down the kittenâs back, burying his finger into its silky fur, and drifts into sleep once again.
The silence was a thing of its own, a hush not to be broken. So Draco watched Potter as they walked. Watched his back swaying with each step he took, watched his hands stuffed in his pockets. Moonlight glinted off the back of his coat, softened it. Occasionally Potter looked over his shoulder, as if making sure whether Draco had followed.
âItâs okay,â Harry murmurs, running a hand up and down Dracoâs spineâup and down every tumbling knot of it. Squeezes Dracoâs rigid shoulders. âItâs okay. Youâre safe now.â
He has never been to a sunflower field before, but that hardly matters in his sleep. They are always in full bloom. Large, brown plates framed by bright egg yolk petals, each long and straight, spread to their fullest. Embracing the sky. Embracing the sun. The air is warm, the dark earth firm underneath his bare feet. The sun kisses him golden and tickles his nose. He closes his eyes, just to hold onto the moment a little longerâ
âThe gardens are flourishing,â Draco said one day. Narcissa smiled and opened her eyes. Looked at the gardens as if she hadnât seen them in a long time.
âAnd you are a shameless flirt,â Draco said, stunned, his face flooding with heat. He stumbled back. âNext time youâll plant a kiss on my mouth when Iâm not paying attention.â
âNo, listen. It likes to climb onto your shoulders, right? Malfoyâs taller than youâitâs unfair, yes, butâbut thatâs the height he usually sees the world from. Right? From that angle.â Ron takes a sip of his wine and points at Harry with his glass. âThatâs why it climbs onto your shoulders so much.â
Then he thinks about what will happen to him if Draco frankly did not know, and thenâfor better or worseâif Draco
And then, when all was finishedâwhen every tin of tea was arranged side by side in the cupboard, every package of biscuit piled in the cabinet, everything, everythingâwhen all was finished, Potter crouched in front of him, careful.
âOf course she did.â Harry laughed, too, a sound full of statics on the other side of the telephone. âBut Teddy was frightened, I think. His ears are now goldfish fins and they wouldnât turn back. Heâs been hiding in his room.â
âEverything is going to be alright,â he murmurs again. âJust drink and donât think about anything else.â
Potter trailed off, distracted as he fished a pill out of a ragged satchel. Draco turned his attention to the other sheep. They all looked the same save for the white markings. Draco tugged loose a strand of hay and tried to bribe a sheep to come near.
So Draco did. The Earl Grey, sugarless as it was, left a bitterness on his tongue. He told her about the fells, the sheep, the faint smudge of North Sea in the distance. The snow covering the endless surrounding hills. The needling branches of Scottish Pines, the thorn dykes, the fox. The stars at night, a sky full of broken diamonds. Spring, the wild flowers sprouting in the wind. The rain, the barn, the lambs. Potter growing a beard. He told her about Lettuce and the bite wound, but left out the steady hum of heat rumbling off Potterâs body. Left out the careful way he wrapped the bandage around his hand, the way he uncurled his fingers, one by one, like an unfurling of petals. Left out the blazing hearth, the thermos of tea smelling of figs and chamomile. Left out the falling into a chilly stream for a bush of bright yellow flowers.
âYouâve got no manners,â Draco says, and then buttons his collar back up one by one. His knuckles graze Harryâs neck. Harry watches him, swaying a bit and smiling loosely.
The kitten steps onto Harryâs stomachâHarry gruntsâand journeys to his chest. Harry scratches the soft tufts of fur at its neck, smoothing his hand down its spine.
On the bed, in his sleep, Draco pulls him close. Key Lime snuggles into the duvets and curls up between them, and falls asleep again.
âBon AppÃ©tit,â he says, going back to the sausages. The kitten meows before munching onto the food, busy eating its own brunch.
âThis,â Draco croaked, pinching the embroidered golden vines and leaves against brick red, âis awful.â
The flat feels disproportionately large. It doesnât make any sense. The bookshelves are covered in a faint film of dust he has never noticed. Every piece of furniture is silent whenever he passes by: the couch, the cabinets, the wardrobe. He feels like a ghost in his own home. He cooks, drinks water, takes a shower. Changes into his pajamas. Sinks into bed and charms the lights off. They extinguish without a sound. The wireless is still playing softly in the living room, the music dampened by the shut door.
âI want to try,â Draco said. The wind carried the tumbling words away. Harry repeated it in his mind;
Malfoy laughs. And Harry does not quite know what to do with this Malfoy, either, cheeks folding in soft lines and the corners of his eyes crinkling. He fidgets with the corner of the page and forces himself to dig back in.
âYou know heâs busy these days. The Ministryâs going crazy, what with the coming school year. Theyâre reviving the curriculum, you know, rewriting the werewolf section and adding the House Elves into the category of Magical Creaturesâitâs not ideal, but itâs a good start, andâ¦â Hermione starts rambling but catches herself last minute and blushes, grinning apologetically at Harry. âAh, you know what I mean. Dracoâs probably just waiting for when he has time to write back.â
Potter herded him through the market with a gentle hand at his back, a light touch. Draco let himself be guided, let Potter dart anxious glances to him from time to time, distant from it all. The crowd thinned into a trickle as they stepped, once again, into the deserted streets. The air was quiet, suffused of the lingering warmth of a drunken night.
Draco snorted, then couldnât control it anymore and laughed, proper and loud. Potter smiled, going back to his hand.
The soft ache intensified into a blooming demand. Draco tried to make light of it, tried to laugh. âFor inadequate techniques?â
Draco, an inevitable pull at the center of his chest, followed. Bent, and pressed his mouth to the crook of her neck. Brushed his lips along her bare shoulder. The skin was warm, sweet like honey.
Potter chuckled as he scribbled something down. âArenât there blizzards in London, too? Donât tell me they discriminate between nations.â
âHey. She knows.â Potter squeezed his ankle, pushed himself up. âIâll make you hot chocolate, alright?â
Harry closes his mouth. He remembers the way Draco stood whenever they talked in the Ministry, shoulders tense, as if ready to jump at any time. Remembers the passersby throwing glances at them, some sneering almost like Draco used to. Whispers and stares, hushed or blatant in the background.
Draco opened his mouth. The answer choked him like the pit of a fruit. He could see nothing other than the green of Potterâs eyes.
The kitten climbs onto the desk again and finds its way to the only words on the blank parchment. He has been sitting here for nearly an hour, and all heâs written is
âI miss her, too,â Draco whispered as Potter tightened his arms, pulled him closer. Draco swallowed. Shut his welling eyes. Held Potter tighter. âI miss her, too.â
By the open door, Harry stood. His contour framed by the golden rays of the sinking sun, so for a moment it was difficult to see his face, but then he did: his eyes wide, mouth slightly open. One hand still on the door knob. His flannel shirt half-tucked into his trousers, the other half pouring out like a tail. The dishevelment was such a darling sight that it knocked him over like a tide, and for a second Draco couldnât speak, couldnât moveâcould only see, and seeing alone was too much. He wanted to laugh, wanted to cry. In the end he buried his face into his hands with a strangled sob.
âItâs for you. So you can contact your family, your job, orâ¦your friends, I donât know. Youâre going to be here for a long time.â
âSo I left London. For years, just the thought of going back was nauseating, and thenâ¦and then this is it.â Potter spread out his hands a little. âIâve never been back.â
On the other side of the living room, Potter sat in the armchair and read letters, his glasses sitting low on his nose. The owl perched on the rack covered in coats. Occasionally it shook its feathers, a little stretch of wings and a rustleâfolded them back with a tilt of its head. It had flown through the heavy rain for miles and miles, was worn out upon arrival. Now it baked itself quietly in front of a burning kerosene lamp, its snowy feathers dry. It reminded Draco of Potterâs old owl, which always lifted a lazy eye whenever he visited the owlery before going back to sleep. Hedwig, he remembered. He wondered where it had gone.
âthen brought up the incident to Isla Allen, who agreed that it indeed was quality artwork, and did Draco draw it himself? Must have taken a lot of time, what was the inspiration behind it? Did he have more drawings at home? They could possibly arrange an exhibition if heâd like, if there were enough drawings. Where to set it up? Could be the lounging room. No, too many people use the space during lunch. How about the garden in the back? They could set up temperature charms since it was outdoors, and humidity charms if necessary, surely Briony would be happy to helpâ¦ In the end it was decided that the lobby would be the best choice, and that it would probably take them a week to clear the space, but setting it up could be done in no time. Could Draco bring the artwork here himself? Were special preservation charms to be cast during the transportation? If it was a bother they could arrange, too, for a team of five or six to helpâ¦
