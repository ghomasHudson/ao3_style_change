singing could sound
“Yes,” Harry whispered.
As his thoughts swirled, the apple sat there, gleaming in the bright sunlight.
Harry managed to free his mouth. “But I was going to spoil you!”
Yesterday. Sunday. The first day of the week. Also known as the first day after Potter had arrived to live in his house after Draco had found him wandering aimlessly the streets near his home and adopted him.
“I’m just saying—!”
Turning to continue his mission of uprooting the last tulip, Draco caught sight of a shining green apple that had fallen from one of the orchard trees. A basket lay nearby, a sign that the house elf charged with harvest had been called away to another duty in the middle of her work.
“—oh as if you don’t thirst over that bloke at the coffee shop, and speaking of tropes—”
Their continued approval warmed his heart. To be treated so well by the Manor’s house elves meant that the House approved of him deeply, so much so that the elves connected to its magic responded in kind. Draco had told him that the elves would sometimes “forget” to serve his previous partner dessert.
“En-su-thia-stick!”
But they had made it in the end, depositing the Squirmy Wormy Cataclysmal Clematis into Neville’s eager hands at noon the following day (or was it the same day? Time zones were the worst). Then, Draco looked into Harry’s eyes and declared, “If I have to Apparate or Portkey one more time I will
had transported to Malaysia from England. To make matters more difficult, the species was extremely volatile/sensitive to magic and also incredibly rare. Neville had asked with watery eyes if Harry might be able to deliver it to him rather than just destroying it outright or turning it over to the Ministry, and Harry cursed his bleeding heart as he answered that of course he would. The result was an exhausting and gruelling 18-hour trip involving far too many Portkey charms and barely any time to appreciate all the new and exciting places they landed in each jump. Harry almost wished they’d taken a Muggle airplane, except bringing a frisky, temperamental mass of thick writhing vines on a flight would probably violate the International Statute of Secrecy forwards, backwards, and sideways.
Draco quickly nipped the ribbon off the statue’s neck; the swan surely didn’t deserve such a beautiful accessory. Then, he put his shockingly strong neck muscles to work. He dragged the stone swan all the way to the orchard and left it lying disgracefully on its side in a cluster of trees.
“Ugh, it sounds so Hufflepuff-ish when you put it like that,” Draco huffed, his cheeks burning.
), drawings of every flower in the garden complete with their meanings, and a drawing of Draco with a flower crown and the caption “Would look very cute! Must try. Maybe when he’s asleep?”, there were some very telling illustrations. Inky lines captured images of clasped hands, of not just Draco but also Harry himself sitting beside each other, looking at each other, eating together at a simple table, and sharing light kisses on each others’ cheeks.
Harry rather understood what Hermione had felt in their first year after the troll incident: there were a few instances where, after having gone through such an experience together, one cannot help but become friends. It wasn’t a smooth journey, but Harry found he liked talking to Draco, and after a time not even the snootiest of Malfoys could deny that Harry and Draco were best friends.
“Yeah,” Harry murmured.
“And your adoring fans?”
Opening the door revealed 1) an impossibly messy flat and 2) a blurry projectile that knocked the wind out of him.
"Go on," Harry urged.
(He conveniently decided to ignore the albino peacocks that used to occupy the grounds. Father had gotten rid of them after one pecked him in the arse anyway.)
“We could try Conjuring it?” Harry suggested.
“Come off it, I’ll be ingesting it too, and you know I’d hardly put something in my own body if I weren’t reasonably certain it would work.”
a problem. And what person doesn’t know that ‘it’s not you, it’s me’ is the oldest break-up line in the book?” Harry demanded.
Somehow, they ended up horizontally in just their underwear on the bed. A very fine position, improved by the fact that Harry’s hands could now sweep up his thigh all the way up to his neck and back down again. All the while, they were still kissing, their lips migrating to other, new places to kiss.
“Yeah…” Harry said dreamily. “You were so hot though, the way you were going on and moaning like a banshee.”
“Yes, of course we are,” Draco answered, smoothly slinging an arm around Potter’s shoulders. He effortlessly put on the voice he always adopted around his young cousins, the one that accompanied shamelessly lying to their faces. “Would you also like to be best friends, Teddy?”
“EEK!” Harry screamed. Whether that was a response to the sudden cold in the bathroom when Draco opened the door or to Draco’s presence in the room while he was naked and vulnerable, Draco hoped rather vengefully that he enjoyed the payback.
on Jenkins, not replace him—and I’ll get to refining the recipe and terrifying the twits in the lab into doing their jobs properly.
Eventually he made it down to Draco’s cock, which by now was standing long and proud against Draco’s belly. Harry licked his lips, and Draco huffed a laugh. “You’re such a cock-hungry slut, darling,” he groaned.
“Drop the thing in the water already, Harry!” Draco insisted, grabbing Harry’s hand that wasn’t holding the bath bomb.
“Too risky,” Draco replied immediately. “And besides, Winguardium Leviosa needs a direct line between the wand and the object.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry examined the cylinder of sweet potato uncertainly. Fondant? Wasn’t that some kind of icing? Was there a cake or something under there?

“—engagement ring!” Harry finished, pumping more magic into the spell this time.
It turned out that picnicking as a goose was just as pleasurable. Draco pecked at the green apples and, when he had had his fill, amused himself by rolling them into the pond. He had just pushed the eleventh one down the slope when he heard a voice: Potter was here!

It was hardly the harmonious melody that Draco’s parents had hoped for him to create when they signed him up for lessons, but Draco couldn’t remember having this much fun since… well, since he’d had those lessons as a child.
And finally,
Scorpius quickly snuggled up next to his side. Draco patted his head and kissed his forehead. “Good night, Daddy,” Scorpius mumbled. He already sounded sleepier, and Draco’s heart melted with love for his son. “I had a lot of fun today with you and Harry. I wish we could keep having fun just like today forever and ever.”

. Why did they just assign things new names so they didn’t have to pretend they were eating what poor people ate?
They passed several minutes in silence, simply holding each other and listening to the sounds of the other’s breathing. Then Harry said, “Can I come with you to your work sometime?”
“After what happened last time, I’m not exactly eager to see what other kinds of havoc a Summoning Spell can wreak,” Draco admitted. “Besides, Vanishing the pipe is way too risky for us to attempt by ourselves.” He paused. “I’m not exactly keen on this idea either, but what if we Transfigured the ring into something that could move closer to the entrance of the drain, and then we could Summon it from there?”
Not that Harry complained much anymore, ever since he’d accidentally happened on a pastime that actually held his attention throughout the entire duration of the train ride.
Which led him back to the original problem: childcare.
“I’m homeless,” Potter said, tearing into the croissant with fervor. “I mean, Ron and Hermione have been really good about putting up with me. They didn’t run into the same problems I did, and they have a flat of their own in London, so I have a place to stay. But I don’t have any money to my name, and sometimes I like to give them their own space.”
“What was that all about?!” Potter demanded. He grasped one of Draco’s wings and stretched it out as if the answer might be written there.
Draco tilted his head lower, lifting an eyebrow like Scorpius lifted worms from the sidewalk.
“Yes, yes,” Harry sighed, long accustomed to this particular rant of Draco’s after six years of working with him as the shopkeeper who sold Draco’s potions.
the right spot.
Harry swallowed it down without any hesitation.
They are born of whatever things make your brain desire sexual intercourse. Do you understand?”
I could use 9.5 hrs of time to just myself....for various reasons   _(:3」∠)_    ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)✧
Shooting a cleaning spell at the dildos, Harry released his legs and massaged the feeling back into them. He decided to take a chocolate and water break, and as he got comfy in his chair, he checked his pocketwatch. It had only been an hour and a half.
when Harry called him by his first name. Closer, like something new, different from their shared antagonisms of the past.
Harry grumped. There was no other word for it, and Draco found it adorable when his boyfriend’s face smushed up like that. Obviously, he had to show Harry how adorable he found him and so gathered him up into his arms.
Harry had charged in, intent on saving him, and the pigeons had decided that the sandwich in his hand was also fair game and began attacking him as well, and the both of them had had to chuck their belongings and make a run to the nearest alley together. Draco was the one who’d grabbed Harry’s arm and Apparated them both to the Potions lab where he was apprenticing.
Draco laughed, but as the seconds ticked by and Potter didn’t show any signs that he’d been joking, Draco stopped laughing. “What do you mean? You’re the hero of the wizarding world. Aren’t people showering you with adulations?”
During their rehearsal time, Harry would chat in between numbers. Since Draco often needed to rest his voice, it turned into Harry talking about himself.
Draco felt that he was hyperventilating and, curiously, was fighting the urge to go over and give Potter a large hug and show him the large bedroom he had now in Draco’s house. “I’m sure it was,” he said in a strangled voice. “Do you… you do know you don’t
Harry babbled.
Harry laughed, and it was the sweetest sound in the world. “You know, that’s not how I thought that conversation would end up.”
The lunch box was now packed up in the cloth bag Harry usually used. Nothing appeared out of the ordinary about it.
bad, surely?”
“Well it wouldn’t be just you. The whole point is to ensure the synchronization system works, so I would be taking a dose as well! If I’ve calculated properly, if the doses are removed from the master batch within two minutes of each other, they will work in tandem with each other. So when dispensing for sales, you have to be sure to decant with at least two minutes between doses.”
“Yes! We were learning how to name trees!”
“‘Ello,” Greg greeted.
“O-kay…” Potter drew out the word. “What’s the catch?”
hit) a particularly high note, and that was the breaking point. Draco stepped into the room and shouted, “Enough!”
Obviously, he needed to pretty himself up more before conquering Potter. His devious goose mind set its sights on that wonderful ribbon that had previously graced the swan statue’s neck. As he raced to the spot where the ribbon lay, he saw that his parents had evidently decided to have tea outside at the nearby garden table. Lucius was seated at the table already, face obscured by the newspaper he was carefully perusing. Narcissa was out of sight, probably still inside applying the layers upon layers of charms she used to protect her skin from the strong rays of summer sun.
Draco had been the first to bring up the topic of marriage six months ago.
The jacket shed, Harry slid his belt out of its loops, then unbuttoned his trousers and shed those just as slowly and decadently. He relished in the slide of fabric against his skin coupled with the thought that anyone might catch a glance of the train conductor stripping nude for all to see.
Harry felt his cheeks instantly redden until they looked like ripe apples. “You want me to
“Harry, wait, I don’t think that’s the best idea—”
“I said
Harry sat his bare arse into his conductor’s chair and leaned back, spreading his legs and hooking them over the armrests. The position left his lower half obscenely exposed. There was something about all that sunlight and outdoors rushing past while he was naked that made Harry’s heart race with arousal. He ran his fingers slowly up the sensitive inner part of his thighs, picturing faceless masses peering in to get a closer look at his straining erection and hole.
He searched all around the house and finally discovered his son and Potter outside in the backyard examining leaves on the trees.
and then began purring (
The Malfoys, on the other hand, ate a course meal served by House Elves at their huge oak dining table
“Huh, must have been a fluke. I’ll try again. Accio—”
. There was no other word for it. Harry grinned and pushed one of Draco’s legs higher, spreading him impossibly wider and allowing the dildo to slam into his prostate on every thrust. Draco’s cock was leaking profusely, and he reached down to grab it, brainless with pleasure. Harry’s hand caught it and tangled their fingers together.
Potter still looked like a deer in the headlights. Draco grabbed his hand and tugged him over to the corner that had apparently become block city. As Teddy began to bash blocks against each other, he leaned towards Potter’s ear, hissing, “Now tell me what is going on. I leave for
“What’s all this for?” Harry mumbled into Draco’s shoulder. “And where were you?”
Fortunately, Lucius and Narcissa lapsed into eating their soups and the occasional quiet comment between themselves. Just as Harry was mopping up the last of the bisque in his bowl, thinking he may get through this unscathed, Lucius spoke.
, any other night I would happily have a threesome with you, you know that—”
Whereas the previous disaster had been blueberry jam, today it was flour. Draco hadn’t been certain this much flour existed in all of London, and yet here it was in his neat townhome.
mucked something up, haven’t I?”
With that, Greg turned and walked out the door, leaving Draco to have an existential crisis alone in the foyer.
Normally, Draco tried to maintain boundaries and keep Scorpius in his own room. Tonight, though, he was feeling rather vulnerable. He pulled back the sheets. “Go on then, get in.”
here, I push him away because I’m scared he’ll know I have feelings for him.”
That had been seven hours ago, according to the fumbled Tempus charm Harry cast. In other words, the gaping maw that seemed to have replaced his stomach would have to be addressed without Draco. Harry’s stomach grumbled on cue, whining for attention since he hadn’t fed it anything at all the past day.
“Actually I
Draco shrugged self-consciously. “I wasn’t sure, and I’ve been waiting for you to ask.”
He reflected on what little he knew of cats. Millicent’s at Hogwarts was an old dame who barely moved. Draco remembered her fondness for climbing into any available Slytherin’s lap and purring louder than a bookshelf of Hagrid’s textbooks. During class, Millicent left her on a windowsill looking into the lake so she could watch creatures swim by.
“Now Harry, not all of us are gifted with the talent of locating prostates, particularly so when one is using a prosthesis and does not possess a prostate of one’s own,” Draco placated.
“That’s not what that’s about, you heathen!” Draco shot back, and then he laughed nervously. “But no, I know very well you’re not interested in that particular tradition. I was referring to, well, marriage—whoa!” Draco stumbled back as Harry launched himself into Draco’s arms.
“Ah, sweet potato fondants! The elves must have known you were here. This is a new recipe I had at Estelle Rosier’s dinner party the other day and have been raving about ever since. Do be sure to try it, dear.” Narcissa smiled warmly at him to emphasize how very kind and welcoming she was.
“Daddy! I messed up! Lots! That means I’m learning, right!”

Scorpius stopped midsentence. “Daddy, are you listening?”
Harry saw him off as usual, and Draco wondered at the oddity of his actions as he managed the goings-on of his shop.
Of course, today had to be one of those where there was disaster after disaster after disaster. Draco was delayed by 90 minutes, and by the time he was opening the door, he was desperate with panic at what chaos Scorpius could have wrought.
“I mean, alright, I’ll do it. It’s not like I have any better ideas, and the crippling social anxiety is making it really hard for me to keep a job. So. Alright.”
“Good morning,” Draco replied slowly, still caught in a confusing tangle of feelings.

He exhaled, the stresses of the day leaving him as he gazed at the beautiful garden. It was certainly a surprise, the way his...ward seemed to understand exactly what Draco needed to unwind.
“Oh, I know. I don’t mind if it’s my own choice.” Potter finally turned so Draco could see his face. “You’re giving me money and a place to stay and I don’t have a job. I’m happy to do some simple cooking or cleaning or whatever.”
The mixed messages were messing mightily with Draco’s mind. Did Harry reciprocate his feelings? Or was he just being considerate and felt awkward about the whole thing? And what about that last thing he’d said before he ran off after Draco’s confession? The notes didn’t
Draco hesitated outside the door to his home. Last time, he’d thought nothing of it and walked straight into a flour-coated disaster. Today, he would be prepared. Today, he would not be surprised by anything he would find that Scorpius and Greg’s boyfriend had gotten up to while he was at work.
“Oh, you’ve got a good grocery right over there in the village! I found it when I went exploring yesterday.”

Chest heaving from exertion, Draco eyed the books lined up neatly on the bookshelves.
“With a vocabulary like that, you
waited so long to make him sit down and show him this marvelous invention?
Harry squawked at first, but his protests were token as evidenced by how readily he let Draco steer him over to the sofa.
In short order, Draco had used his surprisingly prehensile beak to grab every book off the shelves and place each one in a different shelf in the library. The bookcase now stood empty, its contents conquered by one (1) goose Animagus by the name of Draco.
Celine paused, puzzled. “Well, of course? He’s the only one in this place with any sense.”
Harry’s cheeks flamed. “I thought you might enjoy watching a film together, but you’ve been sort of busy recently…”
of Harry’s head landing on Draco’s shoulder made him jerk, waking Harry who scooted back abruptly, face red. Draco immediately mourned the loss of Harry’s warm weight on his shoulder and resolved to react less strongly next time.
Every day, Draco wondered why he put up with all the idiots at his workplace. It was like none of them were at all concerned with producing adequate, let alone stellar potions. Draco would have considered it a miracle for his business to break even, given the constant rotation of useless dunderheads through his brewing labs. However, thanks to him and his surprisingly crafty assistant, Cosmic Concoctions was now the premier potions shop in Diagon Alley, with three other locations throughout Great Britain.
like they were written by someone trying to let him down gently, but if that were the case, why didn’t Harry want to spend the evenings with Draco?
“Aaaaaaargh, if I’d wanted to make stock for Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes, I would have picked a white goose feather and at least let their customers turn into something amusing.”
The gist of it was, hiding behind Draco was not an option.
“Draco,” he said. “Are you asexual?”
“Wonderful. What’s his name? I can send an owl.”
When he was certain that the conductor’s compartment was completely warded, he looked forward out of the wide front window, taking in the countryside rushing past him. A chill of excitement raced through his body from head to his toes at the prospect of what he was about to do.
Kreacher the house elf did, in fact, trip over his own feet at the sight of Draco. He was less interested in Scorpius, which Draco thought was rather rude but he supposed that Scorpius was further removed from the Black name. He recalled vaguely that old family elves were made to memorize the bloodline tapestries and adjust their actions accordingly.
“—and furthermore, I thought you liked it well enough when
Draco was speechless. He was also now the subject of Potter’s intense gaze and Scorpius’s puppy eyes.
An odd choking sound emitted from Draco’s right. With a start, Draco realized that Greg was trying not to
to be scattered; Draco eyed the nearby pond with vicious glee. The neat little fencing with magical lights scattered throughout that formed garden paths was just asking to be wrecked by his bill. There was a single red tulip still in bloom this time of year that seemed to beg to be uprooted. Draco decided to oblige. He ran past the globe that lay forlornly in two pieces on the ground, the United States having popped out of the intricate stonework, and triggered the automatic
Draco approved, and showed it by summoning his own fork and tucking into the plate between them. “Where did you even find Asian pears?” he pondered aloud. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen them before.”
That done, he sat back in his chair and waited.
As if someone (probably a house elf) saw his desperation, the next course poofed into being on the table. The plates held graceful arcs composed of thin slices of roasted duck accompanied by three miniature carrots, two baby leeks, and two pearl onions drizzled artfully with an orange sauce. A cylinder of sweet potato mash that probably had some kind of overly fancy name completed the meal.
“Harry!” Draco pulled his husband back into his arms. After a moment, he mumbled, “I concede that point.”
After catching up on his work, Draco usually read a book or worked out for about an hour. Just before he retired to his room for the night, Draco would cross over to Potter’s armchair and silently hand him a Featherweight sack containing 50 galleons. Potter would always snap his journal shut and then look up and accept the bag with a smile, shrinking and pocketing it.
“Nice to meet you,” Harry said politely. “Thank you for being such a good friend to Draco.”
The words ‘ruin that’ seemed to form a dagger that pierced straight through Draco’s heart. Surely trying to introduce something so awkward as a date would ruin their friendship? “Oh, of course—“ Draco began.
Draco, who had been having a very nice fantasy of napping, jolted back to reality. “What? Oh, it’s no trouble, really. That is, and I hope you’ll take no offense at this, I don’t think you’re the right fit for Scorpius’s babysitter. But I’m sure you did your best.” Really, he wasn’t all
“Oh come on, who doesn’t know that ‘it’s not you, it’s me’ is the oldest evasive tactic in the book!”
He surged down to kiss Harry, Draco’s whole body stretched over top of his, their tongues tangling together. Pleasure pulsed through every nerve Draco possessed as Harry stroked his back and squeezed him tightly.
“Yes, oh gods,
Harry kept thrusting upwards, his body desperately chasing an orgasm Draco wouldn’t give yet.
to be let go.”
Potter rubbed his cheek firmly up Draco’s chest and then began kneading.
In an instant, the wonderfully water-repellent feathers that had been keeping him buoyant disappeared, and human Draco crashed into the pond much the same as Potter had moments earlier. He yelped in dismay
Harry didn’t hesitate at all. His tongue swept over the short length of Draco’s dick, wetting it and driving Draco mad with lust before he sucked it into his mouth. His hands swept up and down Draco’s arse. Occasionally his fingers dipped between his thighs, squeezing and pulling at the sensitive folds there.
At precisely 5:01 pm, he collected his things and swept out of the shop, uncaring of the cowering lab brewers. One Apparition later, he stood outside of his modest-sized home (the size of which was a surprise to literally everyone who thought they knew him). The sun was just setting, its golden rays reaching through the leaves of the trees and bushes in the garden and gently caressing the sparkling water in the pond. Flowers were just beginning to bloom, tiny bursts of color speckling the landscaping. In another couple weeks, there would likely be a coordinated rainbow of flora waiting to greet Draco when he got home every day.
Harry increased his sucking, and his tongue flicked back and forth rapidly across Draco’s dick. With a strangled cry, Draco’s entire body clenched as he fell over the edge. Wave after wave of pleasure crested through him, and through it all, Harry did not pause, his ministrations amplifying the intensity even further. Draco pressed him close, panting heavily through it. He hoped Harry could feel the fervent love radiating off of Draco right now.
He grinned to himself. There was a long ride left, and Harry couldn’t wait.
“I mean, you’re the one with a job, not me. I’ve just been hanging around in your house all day.”
Harry’s mouth stretched into a wide smile, and then Draco leaned in and made all those things he’d just said come true.
Harry obligingly used just his fingertip to stroke his inner walls as he sucked at Draco’s dick. The sensations began to build, faster than Draco had ever experienced before, and then suddenly he was on the brink. “Harry,” he groaned, twisting his fingers in inky black curls. “Harry!”
Draco accepted one last comforting pat and then stood, moving to the drain. “Alright, you said you didn’t see it in here?” He mimicked Harry from minutes earlier, peering into the drain that was still glowing, albeit much dimmer than before as the residual water dissipated.
charms. The water splashing under his webbed feet added to the overall air of chaos as he ran full tilt (which truthfully was not very fast) towards the tulip. Draco was just about to close his beak around the stem when something to the side caught his eye.
“Honk,” Draco replied helpfully.
“Okay,” Harry said, with lips that were distinctly redder than they had been five minutes ago. “What if one of us Vanishes that portion of pipe while the other Winguardium Leviosas the ring up and out?”
“Draco,” he said. “Will you allow me your company for the evening at the Dancing Phoenix? I can tell you all about the Peaceful Pussycat Potion I was doused with on my last raid that turns me into a cat when I’m feeling truly content and also how I’m head over heels for you.”
Not for the first time, Draco mourned the loss of his father if only for the consequent loss of his mother’s former self. When Lucius died, it was as if a light had gone off inside her and had never reignited. She was staying with her sister Andromeda now, after Draco had begged and pleaded for his estranged aunt to help. Even then, it had only been after he’d physically transported Mother, immobile in her chair as she was these days, to Andromeda’s doorstep that she’d agreed to care for Narcissa. Given the extreme difficulty of arranging that, Draco didn’t feel he had any favors left to ask of Andromeda, so leaving Scorpius in her care was out of the question.
say that! Well I’ll have you know that I am a highly sought-after companion. People fall over in the streets out of desire to converse with me! I once had a group engage in fisticuffs over the right to make my acquaintance! It would be to your whole and undivided kitten benefit to be mine!”
“...and you would not
He let his hands wander with intention, slipping under Harry’s jumper and tugging it up and off while also exploring his chest, his back, the tented firmness at the front of his pants. Draco’s own clothing suffered under Harry’s insistent hands. Although they had to stop kissing in order to remove their shirts, the results were well worth it. The feel of Harry’s hot skin on Draco’s sensitive chest was infinitely better than the feel of his shirt. He should really just walk around shirtless in hope of Harry touching his chest. Which, it seemed, Harry was more than happy to do.
it. They were effusive in words and declarations of love, but Harry had yet to see them show genuine interest in either his or Draco’s hobbies or jobs. The whole ordeal made him long for Draco, who would at least be able to manage the conversation so it would flow in a smooth stream rather than like crashing waves against the unyielding rock face of Harry’s awkwardness.
Draco’s heart was pounding so fast it sounded like one of Harry’s drumrolls. Somehow, he managed to find his voice and say, “That’s a lot of things that might happen. Why don’t I tell you something that
He let his fingers continue trailing upward, stroking over his belly and then rubbing roughly over his nipples. Shivers of excitement ran down his body as he resolutely did not touch his cock, envisioning the imaginary crowd refusing him that pleasure and forcing him to focus instead on how good the rest of his body could feel. He swept his hands all over his body, running his arms up and down his arms, his neck, his waist, his thighs. Goosebumps trailed in the wake of his fingers, and his cock leaked a steady drip of precome into his navel.
Shrugging off the weirdness, Harry looked at Draco, whose face was very flushed already. He frowned. “Is the water too hot?”
“Catch?” Draco looked at him blankly.
There was a moment of comfortable silence as the two stood, basking in the simple joy of holding each other.
"Okay." Draco took a deep breath. "I apologize for making you uncomfortable by disclosing my unfortunate feelings to you. I've started looking into arrangements such that you can keep this house. I'll trouble you to allow me to stay here while I search for a new residence. In the meantime, I can set up arrangements to continue payments—"
“That’s not really any different from marriage. Or a sugar daddy situation.”
None of that mattered, though, in the face of the palpable joy in the air of Draco’s home.
Thankfully, Greg didn’t look as if he was heartbroken over the revelation that Draco didn’t want him to continue his babysitting duties. In fact, he appeared
This was a luxury tub, of course, designed for convenience. The tub drain was thus superpowered so that the user did not have to wait overly long for it to empty. As a result, in the time it took Harry and Draco to stare in shock and dismay, the water was gone and there was a distinct lack of (beautiful, gorgeous, perfect, one-of-a-kind) engagement ring on the bottom of the tub.
“Could we try Accio again, if the pipe was Vanished?”
Draco took the page and scanned it quickly. “Hmmm. It could work, certainly. You get to marketing and then hiring a replacement for Jenkins—scratch that, we want to

lessons, fearful of perpetuating his father’s cycle of rich kid tutelage. It seemed that Scorpius’s rambunctious nature had been a cry of boredom though, or something relating to it. Now that he had a focus that he enjoyed, Draco found that Scorpius was much calmer and easier to manage. It
He extended a hand, and Harry grasped it firmly and followed him outside to the Apparition point.
“Of course darling, ta!”
That evening, Harry sat with Draco as usual. Together, they devoured a bowl of cherries and talked about their days. Draco almost could have imagined that he hadn’t had a confession ambushed out of him, except that Harry kept glancing his way when he thought Draco wasn’t looking.
He remembered when Harry had stayed after Scorpius was asleep and the two of them had talked late into the night. Draco found himself spilling secrets and deep thoughts he’d never voiced aloud to Harry. When Harry didn’t ridicule him and, in fact, responded with secret thoughts of his own, Draco knew the universe had shifted, because now he lived in a world where Harry Potter was Draco Malfoy’s best friend.
Harry stood abruptly, his eyes wide. “D’you mean that?”
Let me know what you thought!
“We simply wanted to make sure you were enjoying your meal. We love having you here, Harry dear,” Narcissa stated.
“Of course!” Harry leapt out of the tub and grabbed his wand. “Accio engagement ring!”
Greg looked up. “Mm?”
“Not in so many words, but I assure you the implication was certainly there. And she did say, and I quote, ‘You two would make the most beautiful genetic babies’ with a disturbingly dreamy look on her face.”
The problem was, knowing you liked someone romantically meant that every interaction you had with them from then on was subject to major overthinking.
“Wow,” Harry breathed. “What is it?”
He barely had time to wonder what had just happened when a bowl of lobster bisque topped artfully with lightly sautéed garlic lobster tail and two slices of artfully placed crostini whirled itself into being in front of him. Harry vaguely wondered if he could get away with eating several portions of soup to fill his belly before feigning food poisoning to escape the situation he now found himself in. He discarded the notion as easily as it had occurred to him; soup had its place but not as the sole source of nourishment after a full day of not eating.
If possible, Draco felt himself fall a little more in love with Harry. “You’re being such a good boy, listening to me,” he cooed, and Harry’s hips bucked, his already heavy panting intensifying. “Let’s see about letting you have your reward, hm?”
“Of course,” Lucius replied. He turned to Narcissa and continued, “We never want you to feel the kind of parental pressure we faced ourselves. Pureblood culture
Draco lay in the darkness of his bedroom, unable to sleep in the face of this revelation. A crush? Romantic feelings? He was ill-equipped to deal with those in general, but this was even more complicated. Harry relied on him for money and shelter. There was a power imbalance at play, and no matter what the nitwit lab techs thought, Draco was actually very mindful of what he could and could not do when he was in a position of power over others.
“Oh, is that so?” Lucius said again, but this time with real understanding in his gaze.
He ate the whole thing anyway even though he was morally opposed to the concept of rich people salads. Principles were for people who hadn’t Portkeyed for eighteen hours the day before.
Draco huffed in annoyance. “I
sound fitting for this situation,” Draco said sourly. “That doesn’t make it less unbalanced.”
you, then, if you weren’t at Potter Place?”
do the spoiling.”
But then he’d opened the box and found a beautifully crafted watch inside. It was gorgeous and Harry had thanked Draco profusely, but it was staunchly
“Hey now…” Potter admonished. “Wow, you certainly are pretty, aren’t you? Kind of an arse, though, dumping me in the pond twice.”
“You haven’t,” Draco assured him hotly.
Draco thought for a second. “Fifty Galleons a day.”
Draco sank his hands into Harry’s hair and
Draco let the horrendous nickname slide in favor of digesting this new information. “I appreciate your thoughtfulness,” he said finally. “By any chance, do you have any suggestions for Scoripus’s babysitter?”
"Harry. Let's have a calm and meaningful chat right now."
“Daddy, are you going to do music now? You promiiiiiiised!”
“My sisters were probably at Andromeda’s hanging out with Tonks,” Harry replied. “Wait, you went to my parents’ house? Because you didn’t think I’d eat with yours?”
“Nope!” Scorpius replied cheerfully.
Draco made a face even though Pansy couldn’t see him from the other side of the phone. He graciously ignored her comments about his supposedly-unreasonable-but-in-reality-perfectly-valid number of complaints about his flatmate and replied, “Yes, I’m walking up to the door now. Make sure to tell me all about this newest one.”
“Er, well, I eat whenever I’m with Ron and Hermione! But if they’re not around, I…”

“Yes. I’ll talk with him. Get back to you later. Night.”
“I love you,” he whispered against Harry’s lips.
(Years later, after he made friends with Blaise Zabini, Draco realized that there were other reasons to do with Lucius’s displeasure of Mr. Armstrong.)
normal!”
Harry took a deep breath and reminded himself he’d been Sorted Gryffindor back in the day. The feelings of courage and bravery that had welled within his eleven-year old self on his Sorting day tiptoed in weakly, crawling out of the box of other notions Harry had discarded after determining that the Hogwarts house system was separatist bullshit. Armed with a loose collection of vague bravado and mostly anxious trepidation, Harry slipped out of Draco’s bedroom and descended to the dining room.
When the song came to a natural end, Scorpius clapped loudly and begged, “More, more!”
—and gently tucked the bright red flower into Potter’s dripping hair. He was actually quite fetching like this: Potter’s dark skin and hair, dripping wet, offset perfectly by the radiant chrysanthemum. It made Draco pause. What had he been thinking?! Before Potter could do anything else, Draco swam to the shore and dashed up the hill.
name is Harry Potter. And you’re Draco Malfoy.”
It was time to stage his own ambush.
All of which led to this moment: Harry finding himself in the position of actually
“Draco. You think I haven’t noticed how uncomfortable you’ve been? I admit I’m oblivious, but even I can pick up when someone doesn’t want to spend time in the same room as me or even look me in the eyes.” He took a deep breath. “I’d thought… it seemed like we had a good system, but I’m sure it must be annoying to have someone not just freeloading but actively taking your money at your house. If I’m being a bother, I can leave.”
Draco seethed. "What’s the point of spending all that effort redeeming myself from being a former Death Eater if you won’t let me be the bigger man and avoid hurting you!”
Draco’s heart flipped at the term, and he wasn’t sure why. He would examine that later.
Draco looked up from where he was curled up against the bench along the wall hyperventilating. “What?” he gasped. “Oh, I don’t know, Luna took care of the whole thing. But maybe I
“Ah. That’s what I thought you said.”
There was no denying it. The statue was distinctly grander than his own goose form. And that
“What?” Draco breathed. His head swivelled up and he finally looked at Harry’s face, which was currently cherry red.
“Good night, Harry,” he said every night.
So they did.
Draco tried his best to look innocent. Unfortunately, there was no such thing as an innocent goose.
I’ve got on you!”
He left on the conductor’s cap and necktie. What? It was
He stopped there, because there was no need to introduce himself, or to ask for the other man’s introduction, for that matter.
Potter was muttering to himself as he counted the number of petals on each Many-Petaled Pelargonia to ensure that the soil acidity was adequate. It was a meticulous task, since Malfoy Manor had many Many-Petaled Pelargonia. It was therefore no difficulty to creep up slowly behind Potter on webbed feet and, when he was within biting distance of Potter’s arse, let out a loud
“Good boy. Now,” Draco turned around and pushed his groin into Harry’s face. “Lick.”
And Harry, face adorably scrunched up, flushed from the top of his head to the tip of his dick, did as Draco said.
Draco tucked the note into the pocket on the chest of his robes, just over his heart, and tucked into his meal. If anyone saw the pink stain on his cheeks or the small smile on his lips, they knew better than to say anything.
“Harry Potter,” Draco whispered, stunned. He hadn’t seen the man in years, but Potter hadn’t changed at all. He still looked scruffy, skinny, with those huge green eyes that made Draco want to drown in them like someone whose parents had never mastered Floatation charms. The only difference was that that buzz of energy that always seemed to float around Potter seemed to have settled under his skin, working
The strap-on’s magic activated with Draco’s whispered words, and the base began to vibrate in just the right place. He began to stroke in and out, watching Harry’s face carefully for signs of discomfort. He was hyper-aware of Harry and was single-mindedly focused on ensuring Harry felt exactly what Draco wanted him to feel: mindblowing, earth-shattering pleasure. When he determined Harry had fully adjusted to the thick length inside him, he began to thrust
Lovegood encouraged him to try out different things and follow the whimsies of his heart. Left with no better option, Harry had taken that advice fully and totally.
Narcissa fell back on her bum.
Draco tilted his head. “I’ll give you that one, though as I’ve never seen you actually
He finished scrubbing perfunctorily and dried himself, mind busily racing to put together the words he was going to say. By the time he entered the living room, Draco had a rough plan of action.
Draco waved the fork impatiently. “Potter, do sit down and calm yourself. You’ve done nothing wrong, and in fact you’ve vastly improved many things without my needing to tell you. So. Thank you. Now come and eat this fruit.”
. “Knew it already,” he said succinctly in that Greg way of his. “Was thinking over dinner. I know someone. He talks more. Could keep up with the little one.”
The pattern continued for five days. Draco would discover new flowers and a note every time he opened his lunch, and then at nighttime Harry would run off to be by himself instead of being with Draco.
Draco rubbed a hand in soothing circles on Harry’s hip. “You’re full up with my cock, sweet thing, and you’re taking it so well. I’m going to move, okay?”
“Good to know your ears are still functioning.” Draco tapped at his arm with one finger, then said, “Also, I’m a potions inventor. All my ideas are
what you were looking for?” Draco pushed sharply into Harry and was rewarded with a loud cry. Harry’s body arched upwards in a gorgeous line.
“Likewise,” Draco murmured, feeling shellshocked but not wanting to show it.
“It isn’t a matter of how
Predictably, the conversation about Harry’s work ended up shifting to topics concerning Lucius and Narcissa’s life. Harry supposed he couldn’t blame them; most people, let alone rich socialites, simply didn’t think wrangling invasive plants was very exciting. Still, it was disheartening to think that as much as they
Which also made Harry wonder… “How was the ring floating? I thought it was a water-activated Winguardium Leviosa, but if it were, the ring would have floated when it fell in the water.”
Harry was on his feet now, brow creased with rage. "Why are you saying these things!"
Draco moved behind Harry and rubbed Harry’s shoulders. “I don’t believe that. Look, you’re all knotted up here.” His skillful fingers massaged Harry’s shoulders for a while. “Wow, that’s a big knot.”
“Fuck it. Let’s do it.”
Draco fucked him through it, his hand maintaining pressure on Harry’s cock even as come spurted out, streaking Harry’s belly and chest. His eyes were affixed to Harry’s expression of contented, fading arousal, etching everything into his memory. The combination of that and the insistent vibrations on his dick sent Draco into his second orgasm.
Harry was the first to continue. “You keep saying how wrong and immoral it would be. Well, it’s only a problem because you’re worried I wouldn’t be able to express myself freely because I’m afraid of losing resources, yeah? When have I
As if he could read Draco’s mind, Harry asked, “Well that was interesting. Was that good for you?”
So Harry was at a loss of what Draco could be planning. Was he going to stretch this game of his over
Draco snorted.
Just in time, too, because here came Narcissa. She paused at the chair and scrutinized the scene before her. “Darling?” she questioned.
Carefully, he peered at his surroundings. Father’s spare library at the Manor was much the same as it had been when Draco was human. Naturally, everything looked bigger than it had before he underwent his first full Animagus transformation; at the same time, it all looked much more… conquerable than it had ten seconds previously. Draco flared his powerful wings experimentally and immediately struck one of the tall bookcases, sending it into a precarious wobble before the Stabilisation spells caught and uprighted it.
In the meantime, Teddy was busily exploring Draco’s bag, tugging on zippers and peering inside. Attempting to save his precious reference books, Draco decided to help Potter. “Like this,” he grunted, heaving Teddy up by his armpits, smoothly rising to his feet, entering the flat, and closing and locking the door behind him. “Now, Potter, explain.”
Now, over a small plate of sliced Asian pear, Draco found himself facing that same desire again. And what better way to learn Potter than through stimulating conversation? It even aligned with his self-professed motivation for inviting Potter into his home, he reasoned.
Harry finished his tirade in a huffing, panting mess, face as red as his brown skin would reveal, fists clenched tight as his sides.
Draco took a deep breath and exhaled slowly before doing as Harry said, which struck Harry as a bit odd. He mentally parsed through his words in case he’d said something that could be construed as a dirty joke, but if Draco was reacting that way to the words “put it in” then he was more sexually frustrated than was possible given how often the two of them fucked.
“Er,” Harry began.
Draco snorted. “Are you seriously asking me if that was good? Harry, that was the best damn fucking I’ve ever had.” He paused, thinking. “Though I don’t think I could handle this often. That was
“It looks fantastic!” Harry said anyway.
I'm on tumblr
Draco slapped Harry’s wrist before he could focus all his magic into the Accio spell. “You’re going to burst the pipe!”
The next day, Draco found his packed lunch sitting on the kitchen table. Harry was nowhere to be found. His heart sank, dismay heavy in his chest. This was the start of Harry’s discomfort, and then he would move out and Draco would have to go back to the old loneliness of his existence—
Potter looked panicked. Normally, Draco would delight in it, but he felt a strange sense of pity for Potter and piped up, “Then how about Po—Harry and I come over and you
sticky, so I added
Draco glanced at Potter curiously. “These aren’t herbology lessons; I don’t know how to identify these kinds of plants.”
“Pleasure,” Celine replied brusquely, foot tapping a little impatiently.
“I’m sorry, Scorpius, but I don’t know any other songs. Mr. Potter and I would have to practice more together.”
Drawings. Harry had been working on drawings. More significantly, the drawings were mostly of
“If we start this, you should know that I’m a selfish bastard and I don’t let go easily,” Draco warned.
“Draco, can I have a word with you in private? Teddy, why don’t you go play with your blocks?”
. He smiled against Harry’s lips and decided the best way to be sure was for the two of them to kiss many more times.
“Dayco!”
Draco blinked, then blinked again. One moment, he’d been enjoying snuggling with his fuckbuddy in postcoital bliss. Now, his arms were scratched and there was a black cat under his bed, hissing.
Lucius’ tea went spewing out.
When Draco finally pounced on him, he punished Harry by sitting on top of him and kissing him, long and hot and intense—and then tickling him mercilessly. The ensuing tickle fight launched another round of running around the house chasing each other, though this time when Harry sat triumphantly atop Draco, the fight morphed into a makeout session.
“I am going to sleep for the next 92 hours,” Draco announced. His eyes were closed, and Harry marveled anew at the blonde sweep of his eyelashes and the fine bones of his face. His husband was surely the most beautiful man in the entire world. While it was more fun to spend time with his awake husband than an asleep husband, Harry had a special appreciation for how beautiful Draco was in repose.
Harry (as he’d firmly insisted Draco call him, to the point of ignoring him if he said “Potter”) had made a point of being the most exemplary babysitter Draco could imagine. Draco could find no fault with him, and he was therefore forced to keep Harry around—or so he told himself when his brain started rebelling at the idea that he was becoming friends with Harry Potter. Draco found himself looking forward to coming home these days, and not just so he could spend time with his son. No, he specifically looked forward to coming home to enjoy Harry’s company.
Draco looked up from his position in the armchair in the furthest corner of the room from Harry. Or rather, from where Harry
“Ready?” Draco glanced over to where Scorpius sat at the piano and Harry sat behind the drumset.
Draco groaned and ground his dick further onto Harry’s face, burying his own face into Harry’s belly. Then, he lifted up and slipped Harry’s erection in his mouth, sucking with the sole intent of making Harry feel as good as Draco himself felt. His fingers squeezed at Harry’s balls and wandered down to play with the rim of his hole. By the sounds Harry groaned into Draco’s dick and his increasingly frantic writhing, he seemed to be succeeding at driving Harry mad with lust.
There was no time for astonishment, in the end. Draco had already been running behind, as tends to happen when one is in care of a young child who lacks understanding of such abstract concepts as “schedules” and “being on time”. And Potter
He knelt on the tub floor and peered into the drain. It was astonishingly bright inside because the myriad of water-activated Lumos charms had also washed down the drain with the water. That meant it was also immediately clear that there was no ring visible within the short distance of drain before the pipe bent.
It was not the life and career he thought he’d have at the ripe old age of 28. He’d assumed he’d marry Ginny right out of Hogwarts and by this point they’d have two kids and be thinking about another. Instead, Ginny had patted his cheek and told Harry that she’d let the veil of hero worship obscure her eyes for too long. Then she’d come out as aromantic and asexual and now traveled the world with Luna.
Harry gasped in delight, tears coming to his eyes as the platinum ring threaded with diamonds and amethysts began to rise through the water on what he could only guess was a water-activated Winguardium Leviosa. He turned to face Draco, who was already reaching out to grasp both of Harry’s hands in his.
Another beat of silence, then both Draco and Potter started laughing at the same time.

“Or on the ace spectrum? I realize this is probably a conversation we should have had earlier, but I wasn’t really thinking of it at the time.”
“Hey, you can’t blame me, I really don’t know you very well at all, it seems!” Potter bit his lip. “I wouldn’t mind getting to know you better. I know it’s kind of weird, but it can’t possibly be any weirder than me trying to get along with my cousin after all the shite we went through growing up.” He stuck out a hand. “A commitment to friends?”
of fun…
, causing Harry to moan loudly. The resulting vibrations felt delicious on Draco’s cock, so Draco continued pulling at the strands intermittently and enjoying the blowjob.
“I’m not sure…”
. I saw what you’ve done in the garden, and to the floors, and in the halls.”
It made Draco feel as if his heart were about to squeeze into oblivion. He didn’t need to hear Harry’s reply; he could see the truth of Harry’s feelings right there on the page.
“It is
, not ten years ago, you dolt. I find it hard to believe that a man who networked his way into owning a chain of three successful potion shops has no friends.”
Harry’s form, blurred by the frosted glass, shrugged. “There’s only one entrance and exit, and you don’t keep your wand on you in there so you can’t Disapparate on me. It seemed like a good choice. Anyway, tell me what it is so we can go back to normal.”
As he was enjoying a particularly good suck, Draco felt one of Harry’s fingers questing at his arse, the tip slick with lube that he’d wordlessly and wandlessly conjured because Draco’s boyfriend was an overachiever like that. He tilted his hips up obligingly, letting Harry’s finger plunder his hole and begin to stretch it.
To say nothing of how he felt when it was just him and Harry! Those flaming bright green eyes, the bird’s nest of midnight strands he called hair, his smooth brown skin and the way it wrapped around his muscles… Draco’s cheeks pinked just remembering how he’d been staring so intently at Harry’s arms as he played drums that he’d missed his entrance.
have the money.
But then… he remembered how the belly flutters happened in situations like Harry teaching Scorpius how to ride a bicycle, or when Harry was simply sitting next to Draco and smiling at him, or when Harry was whistling in the kitchen as he attempted to cook something he’d never even eaten before.
All of his old friends were gone, having fled the country after the war. All, that is, except for one. Draco was loath to ask anything of him, given all he had done to him in their school years, but he was really left with no choice. He couldn’t have just
happen?”
Draco’s hands dipped under Harry’s waistband, teasing at the sensitive skin there, causing Harry to push up eagerly. His hand caressed the skin all around Harry’s hips before giving in and wrapping firmly around his cock. He gave it a few tugs, and Harry cried out wantonly, his hands stroking up and down and all over Draco’s body with increased fervor.
Harry interpreted. He quickly backpedaled. “I’m a humane exterminator for the environment.”
He walked in a circle one way around it. Then he walked the other way around it.
Well, Draco certainly wasn’t about to pass up the chance of letting someone else cook for today.
. Now do you understand and consent to trying this experimental potion?”
“Oh no, they were true,” Potter commented, not looking up from where he was dicing potatoes for that evening’s ragout. “If anything, they were less than what actually happened. I doubt anyone she talked to was ever actually inside the house. She didn’t mention anything about the cupboard, for instance. Or the part where I had to cook and clean the whole house as soon as I could hold a spatula or broom.”
“Of course!” Potter replied, because he was clearly not a parent and therefore completely vulnerable to children’s begging. “I can come over every day, if your dad will have me.”
“No need. He’s my boyfriend. I’ll tell him.” For the first time in Draco’s memory, Greg let out a soft, warm, genuine smile that took over his whole face as he mentioned this boyfriend.
“Come for me,” he breathed. “Come for me, Harry!”
Narcissa showed Draco to his room and ushered Harry in as well before closing the door, the embedded Silencing Charm settling into place once the portal was closed. The two of them rushed through their nighttime routines and then crashed into bed.
Draco waved a hand impatiently. “Oh, just your standard Mood Stabiliser potion. Hormones and such, you know, so the side effect isn’t that surprising.”
“That’s what you said the last time we did a roleplay,” Harry playfully bumped his bum backwards against Draco’s crotch.
, but I can’t until the height of our romantic getaway.”
Really, Draco shouldn’t have been too surprised when Harry cornered him in the shower.
As the plates cleared from the table, Harry happened to look up for another scheduled smile to show how engaging and charming he was. At the same time, a house elf zapped into being. Rilly pointed several times at Lucius’s hair, then made an exaggerated “WOW” expression.

things involving your mouth, and how I have to stop because I don’t know if it’s rude to fantasize about a friend. So I might just keep talking about how I’d very much like to take you on a date, if you’d let me.” Those bright green eyes glanced up, gazing directly into Draco’s. “So those are all the things that
As if he could tell he was being discussed, Teddy got up and plopped himself between Draco and Potter. “Hello!” he screamed. “What’re you talking about? Why are you whispering? Are you best friends?”
Harry stood on his arrival, hands clasped together in front of him, face downcast. “I’m sorry about ambushing you again. That was probably out of line.”

Even the imbeciles in his labs couldn’t bring down Draco’s mood. He’d been tempted to fire them to amplify his cheer even more, but Harry had convinced him not to. Draco suspected that his benevolent motivation actually lay in his enjoyment of the tales of their blunders that Draco told him every day.
“What could he have possibly done in the past sixteen hours to escalate him to the firing level already?” Draco asked, amused as well as apprehensive. He sipped at his tea and leaned back against the desk in preparation for what was sure to be a wild tale. Jenkins had been on probation since his first hour as a lab tech. How he’d managed to scrape through the interview and initial brewing test was the current hot mystery at the shop.
Draco leaned in close, his hands never stopping their ministrations. “So beautiful, Harry. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you. I’ll make you feel so good. Do you want me to fuck you, Harry?”

“—statistically speaking, it seems there is a larger proportion of plumbers who are attractive—”
now.”
“Mm. My bedroom for the first eleven years.” Potter put the potatoes aside and tasted the stewing tomatoes. He added some salt. “It was shit.”
Draco turned back to the tub and cast a spell that turned the floor of it transparent. The pipe was visible, as was the ring, indirectly. For the smooth cylinder of the drain pipe was interrupted by a cone, the tip of which was exactly the same width as the diameter of Harry’s (incredible, dazzling, fantastic, unique) engagement ring.
“What’s this?” He meant the folder, clearly. The Earl Grey was his usual in the mornings, and he gave a grateful nod to Celine for her thoughtfulness.
Suddenly, Harry’s hands gripped Draco’s hair. “I’m going to come!” he whined.
That second thought decided him. “Go wait for me in the living room,” Draco commanded. “I’ll tell you what’s going on, but only after I’m dry and clothed.”
“Yes, I am quite pleased with it so far. Though of course, I still maintain my use of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion.” Lucius sent a wink at Harry. Harry instinctively moved to the side to dodge it. Draco would take great offense if Harry received any winks other than his own, especially from his father. Okay, he probably wouldn’t actually care at all, but Harry felt a bit weird about it.

Later, after much kissing and cuddling and maybe an orgasm or two, Harry lay naked from the waist down on top of Draco, who was greatly enjoying stroking Harry’s back and feeling their legs tangle together.
out of it.
He was about to squawk indignantly, but Greg spoke then.
“Careful, Potter!” Draco admonished, steadying him easily with one hand; brewing potions and owning a potions shop where one was obliged to help cart in the stock helped develop some serious lifting muscles. He frowned. Potter was too light. “Are you not getting enough to eat?”
“If you’re sure,” Draco said casually, though his eyes betrayed his pleased reaction at Harry volunteering to spend time with his family.
The combination of these three key points meant that Harry was going to have to go down and endure a course meal with his in-laws
Still, Harry wolfed down every bite. The duck was tender and rich, melting in his mouth and blending with the sweetness of the orange sauce. It paired well with the sweet potato cylinder, which was quickly becoming Harry’s favorite part of the meal. Truly, the noble potato reigned supreme among all forms of sustenance.
Well it was odd of Draco to have gone home without speaking to his parents, but Harry shrugged it off. He probably hadn’t wanted to deal with his parents’ overbearing love. Harry made his way to the Floo in the corner of Draco’s room and spoke the name of the little Hogsmeade cottage he and Draco had made their home.
“Beside the point, really. Children learn quickly.” He glanced at Potter, who appeared to be having an apoplexy. “Oh, I suppose we could hire the piano teacher to be the accompanist if we needed to.”
“Oh, is
“Yes, my love?” Lucius replied, setting down his newspaper and picking up his tea. He took a sip as he gazed inquisitively at her, prompting her to continue.

A distinctly louder
“Exactly right.” Draco shifted nervously in his chair, his eyes sliding to the left.
“Yeah.” Harry looked away, clearly embarrassed by his art. “It’s something I got into recently in Ron and Hermione’s flat with no job or anything to do all day. You don’t need much to doodle, and Hermione’s always got bits of paper or parchment lying around. They’re probably not any good…”
, really, and he’d been in limbo over what to do with his life.
Harry pulled back, pouting. “No fair! I was going to confess first at the height of a romantic moment! I had this whole thing planned out, I was going to get you to dress me up fancy, and then we were going to go to a—!”
The obvious explanation was that Potter had turned into a cat, suddenly and inexplicably, the abruptness of which left him scared and lashing out. At least, Draco hoped that was the reason Potter scratched him rather than a desire to cut Draco open.

“I want—
Draco grinned, happiness soaring. “I’m looking forward to it.”
“Are you kidding me? It was fantastic and more than everything I’ve ever wanted,” Harry replied immediately. “Though we should probably have a safeword, just in case.”
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, looking skyward. Or rather, ceilingward. Towards a ceiling that was

“Yeah.” There was that smile again.

How, precisely, was he supposed to handle his new promotion, corresponding increase in work hours,
These thoughts consumed him until Draco finally fell into a fitful sleep.
So it was with trepidation that Draco took a deep lungful of air and projected his voice into his favorite song for the first time since Mr. Armstrong was sent away.
“Well, Potter, seems you’re stuck with me until you can be human again. I
The globe went sailing out the window. Draco came tumbling out after it, flapping his wings haphazardly as he attempted to take flight. Unfortunately, it seemed that the secrets of flight were not programmed into Draco’s Animagus instincts. He fell tail over neck all the way down until he made contact with the Cushioning Calpurnias his mother had planted when he was a toddler to protect him. Draco had scoffed at the notion that he might ever topple out the third story windows. Now, he was immeasurably glad for their presence.
Draco did not snoop because he had grown to be the kind of person who didn’t. But Merlin and Circe and several other minor deities, did he want to know what was in that book.
He was interrupted from his romantic identity crisis by the creak of the bedroom door opening. “Daddy?” Scorpius whispered quietly, so as to only wake up all of Ireland but not quite Scotland.
“Those are changes you’ve made to the house. I’m talking about things for
Draco hastily swung it open. “Hello, good morning, right on schedule. My name is—“
, but it’s much scarier to reveal your deepest feelings when you might get an answer. And I can hardly ask a kitten on a date, now can I?” He chuckled at his own joke.
Harry grinned rakishly and clasped both of Draco’s hands, pressing them to the mattress. At the same time, he leaned forward, tilting Draco’s hips up so he could pound Draco’s arse more effectively, still hitting his prostate unerringly with every thrust.
“Oh, loads,” Dursley said easily. “But none of them do the, er, magic thing, and I think Greg mentioned that was an issue?”
Draco pretended to think about it. “Throw in an actual pet cat and we have a deal.”
Additionally, Harry was a wonder with Scorpius, easily guiding his flights of fancy into learning activities and not afraid to reel in the child and distract him when he started getting too rowdy. Watching their interactions, Draco felt something warm flutter in his belly.
Potter chose that moment to sink his sharp kitten fangs into Draco’s shoulder, and he released the cat reflexively. Potter leapt to the ground and bolted. The next thing Draco heard was the
He spent a while toying with his hole, acclimating it to wider dildos incrementally as his other hand traced up and down his body. At some point, his legs grew tired of being hooked over the sides of his chair, so he Conjured restraints that would help him stay spread. The whole time, he kept staring out the view into the countryside before him, skin prickling pleasantly with the thought of those imaginary watchers.
“Why would a sex potion cause blue balls?”
“Malfoy, he’s
Potter visibly relaxed, and Draco could no longer contain himself. He burst out laughing, which apparently shocked Potter enough that he fell out of his seat.
Slowly, the events of the previous day came back to him. A long bout of short-distance Portkeys as he and his husband carefully transported back the magical cage of invasive species that some

idea how the man slept so much, as someone who only needed seven hours or fewer himself).
“Lost, Potter?”
“Sure. Do you want to go to the village?”
fuck me!”
Scorpius’s demeanor stilled slightly. “No, Father, I won’t do it again.”
Harry’s mind flashed through the other six times Lucius had brought up this exact question. It wasn’t his fault, really (though his own mum and dad had no problems remembering what their sons did for work). Harry’s job involved him doing a lot of different things that did not seem related to one occupation. The kinds of hijinks he and Draco got up to would be better left unsaid in the company of Draco’s parents.
Harry smiled through gritted teeth anyway. She probably didn’t even realize her compliment was backhanded and truly “admired” him for—he mentally checked his notes—having a job.
“A very sexy banshee, the kind of banshee that makes your knickers wet instantaneously—“
Celine nodded grimly. “All of them. Our Polyjuice stock for the month is now zero, unless our customers want to transform into one soon-to-be-unemployed and
Out of the corner of his eye, behind Lucius and Narcissa, Harry suddenly spotted a house elf coalesce into existence. Zippy, if he wasn’t mistaken, frantically made eye contact with him and mimed bowing multiple times, then raised a hand to his mouth as if eating soup. Harry mimicked him instinctively, sweeping into a medium bow while saying, “It would be my, er, honor to join you for dinner this night.”
One thorough clean-up later, the thought of figuring out dinner made Draco want to scream, so he decided to get Floo-in for dinner. He made the order, pulled his head out of the flames, and sank heavily into a chair at the kitchen table.
He looked up. Harry stood straight, eyes fixed on the corner where wall met ceiling. Slowly, Draco rose, setting the sketchbook down gently on the sofa cushion. Then, so, so gently, he took Harry’s hands in his, drawing him close.
Eventually, Draco spoke again. “So where
“It’s called a bath bomb. When you put it in water, it fizzes and turns the water colors and releases calming scents, or so Luna told me. Either way, it came highly recommended from both her and Millicent, which will never fail to be a surprising pairing to me.”
There was an interlude of kissing as Harry rewarded Draco for his thoughtfulness.
way, down the drain and further away? I’m not too keen on that either.”
And now, three years later, Harry couldn’t be happier...except.
Draco sighed heavily. He supposed there were two options here: 1) continue living together and pretend everything was normal or 2) set Harry up with a place of his own somewhere else. His heart squeezed painfully at that second possibility. He didn’t want Harry to leave! Better to suffer in silence than to suffer Harry’s absence.
Afterwards, Draco really did give Harry a tour, combining it with his daily intimidation of the idiots in the lab. Harry’s presence seemed to amplify their dread of Draco, and he had hope that there would be no mishaps today in producing the new recipe of modified Polyjuice
It took no time at all before both of them were naked. The skin on skin contact aroused Draco to no end. No matter that they’d been together for three years or the number of times they’d had sex; Draco still felt his blood heat every time he felt Harry’s body pressed up against him. He showed his appreciation with wandering, greedy hands, squeezing Harry’s arms, his chest, his sides, his arse, his thighs.
While Scorpius excitedly re-enacted the entire day and afternoon, Draco’s eyebrows seemed to have found the mythical stairway to heaven given how they steadily climbed higher and higher on his face. Periodically he looked to Greg, who was determinedly watching Scorpius’s energetic rambling and not Draco. In the past, Draco might have mistaken this for Greg’s usual reticence to make eye contact, but he felt he had a good enough grasp on Greg at this point to realize that this was deliberate.
Draco scrutinized Potter’s face, but he didn’t seem to be implying any sort of self-centred Slytherin shaming. Draco decided not to look the gift Hippogriff in the beak and answered the question at face value. “If you must know, it can get rather… quiet in my house. A bit of company would not be… unwelcome.”
“Well just reference your own childhood like everyone else! It’s not that hard!”
“Now now, Harry, I’ll give you what you want but you have to be good for me, okay?” He sweetened the deal with a few more languid strokes.
“Yeah, well, it’s whatever. The problem is, I have no idea what to do with
“I know the whole Pureblood traditions thing can be a bit of a touchy subject with you, but I was wondering if...you would want that.”
His brazenness startled a true laugh out of Draco. Fifty Galleons was over twice what the average person would earn in one day, and it seemed Potter knew it. Well, it’s not like Draco
“So there
Greg and Dudley came over occasionally nowadays, at Harry’s suggestion and Scorpius’s insistence that “the two nice big men” come to visit. Draco had no complaints, especially since Greg would usually bring some absolutely divine bread. It was a little odd at first seeing the stilted way Harry and his cousin interacted, but Scorpius easily bridged any awkwardness with his antics. It helped that there was one common thread uniting the adults in the house: they all adored Scorpius. His son had surely never been so doted on in his life.
When aftershocks had replaced the overwhelming waves, Draco became aware that Harry was literally quivering between his legs. “Are you alright, darling?” he asked.
Well, the point was, that trip hadn’t ended with a ring on Harry’s finger (though there
“Hey, they’re
Draco said again, more emphatically this time.
Scorpius’s breathing evened into a slow, steady rhythm, leaving Draco free to ruminate worriedly. Did Scorpius mean he wanted Harry to stay as a friend? Babysitter? Semi-permanent caretaker? Would he react badly if Draco tried asking Harry on a date? Would
“Harry,
“Greg,” he said, trying very hard not to sound upset because Merlin knew he’d been nasty enough to Greg in seven Hogwarts years to fill seven lifetimes, “Greg, what...ah...what did you do today with Scorpius?”
"Harry—" Draco said at the same time.
“Yes, and it was horrifying. Your mother looked me in the eye and suggested I had slept in late because of the good dicking skills and Very Large and Long seduction tool you inherited from your father, then started hinting unsubtly at grandchildren!”
“Kreacher!” Potter called.
“Who said you could stop sucking?” Draco demanded, shoving Harry’s face back onto his cock. Harry let himself be driven down without complaint, mouth working eagerly as his finger continued brushing Draco’s prostate maddeningly again and again.

“Anyway, good to meet you, Mr. Potter. Draco’s never brought any other… partners around, so seems like you’ve got something special. Treasure it.”
He knew a lot of things about Harry, and it was only in reflecting on how many things he knew about him that Draco learned something new about himself: he maybe had a tiny bit of a crush on Harry Potter.
“I, er, no I’m not,” Draco replied. “Why do you ask?”
Dursley, who had been hovering awkwardly the whole time, sat gingerly across from him. “I’m, er, very sorry about that earlier,” Dursley said.
“Well said, Narcissa.” Lucius set down his fork, and his empty plate disappeared. “Why don’t we head to the drawing room for after-dinner drinks? We’d love to hear more about your work, Harry.”

Eventually, they separated and cleaned up. Draco filled a Conjured glass with water and offered it to Harry, then got distracted by the way his throat moved as he swallowed.
Draco didn’t mind: Harry had led a fascinating life since the war. Whereas Draco had entered into an Arrangement™ with his parents and used a surrogate to bear a child to carry on the Malfoy name, Harry had decided to renounce all such societal expectations. Granger and Weasley had moved to Australia, and Harry had moved in with Luna Lovegood, of all people. He hadn’t wanted to be an Auror or professor or shop owner or writer or
As Harry explained his acronym crisis, Draco decanted a teaspoon of the potion into two separate vials and handed one to Harry. They stared at one another in the eye, and then Draco raised his vial and tossed it back, yelling “YOLO!” As Harry stared, he smirked and said, “That stands for ‘You Only Live Once.’”

It took longer than Draco expected. Harry finally broached the topic about a month into their updated relationship status, and of course he did it in a way that made Draco spit out his tea.
Harry laughed uncomfortably, his eyes shifting wildly across the table to try and find a distraction before this thread of conversation could go any further. This wasn’t the first time Narcissa had made that joke, and each time he feared for his safety as the heir to the Sleekeazy Potion formula and husband to the son of, ahem,
“What?” Draco spluttered.
He grabbed the basket in his beak and dragged it into the shade of the tree. Then, he began to collect the fallen green apples one by one and drop them into his basket. When the basket was full, Draco dragged the whole thing to the picnic spot by the pond. As a human child, he’d enjoyed many an afternoon here with Mother, eating tiny sandwiches and enjoying the warm sun and charmed butterflies.
“Uh, I may not have had much in the way of science classes before going to Hogwarts, but I’m fairly sure that the brain chemicals that give you unstable moods are nowhere close to the ones that make you preggers.”
Scorpius declared the meal “very scrumptious” and then scampered off to draw a picture, leaving Draco and Harry alone.
“Ow!” Draco pressed on the little scratch and debated what to do. He was loath to actually cast a spell on Potter-kitty because that felt excessive. On the other hand, he couldn’t spare many more of his fingers — a Potions master needs an intact sense of touch! — and Potter wasn’t responding to words.

he thought.
Something in his heart eased at the thought that it was no longer just him and Scorpius against the world.
Draco honked loudly in triumph.
“Darling, I have to get dinner started…”
, I’ve invented a new potion. One that is meant to ramp up sexual tension between the people who drink it and therefore heighten the pleasure between the two—or more—participants.”
Harry smiled indulgently and raised his sticks. “One, two, one, two, three, four!”
“What?!”
“Good. Now. Side effects may include weakness in limbs, shortness of breath, or blue testicles.”
Harry had been ecstatic at the time, and he still was. It was just that Draco had yet to propose and Harry was driving himself mad trying to figure out how and when the man was going to do it.
Harry choked on his last mouthful of potato, which was a complete waste because now his last bite was ruined. Three house elves winked into being behind the Malfoys, but he held up his hand as the coughing subsided, then sipped some water. When he felt he could speak without hacking up a lung, he looked up and said, “Thank you for telling me. I’m er, honored by your considerations, Mister—I mean, Father.”
“Alright, spill.”
Harry frowned, coming in close to draw Draco into a tight hug. “That can’t be right. Who wouldn’t want to be friends with you?”
“Wait!” Potter stood as if to physically prevent Draco from leaving and swayed dangerously.

while waving colorful streamers and blaring party poppers. The loudness of his mental celebration prevented him from questioning why Dursley might know another magical person besides his boyfriend Greg, and also why Greg hadn’t mentioned this person previously. “Have him come by in the morning tomorrow, same time as you did today, if he’s willing. Tell him money isn’t an issue.”
Potter yelped and fell back on his arse. Unfortunately, the patch of Many-Petaled Pelargonia was on a slope overlooking the pond, so down Potter tumbled until he rolled with a big splash into the water. Draco sailed gracefully into the water just after him, a large red chrysanthemum in his bill that he’d plucked on the way down.
“Okay?”
“Mmrgh,” Harry replied articulately, his saliva caught in his throat.
He didn’t stand a chance.
“Learned baking,” Greg replied succinctly.
you, isn’t it? Wait, that means you got your Animagus transformation! That’s great! Should’ve known you’d be a goose, though, you prat.” Potter was laughing now, his eyes lit up in that way they did when he was properly smiling. It was so lovely and reminiscent of the feelings that human Draco had for Potter that his transformation suddenly reverted.
“He forgot the Containment Shields over the Polyjuice when decanting, and his eyelashes are dangerously loose, it seems.”
“I want you to come like this,” he said. His hips thrust forward particularly deep, emphasizing his meaning. “Do you think you can?”
It was dark.
“Not my fault. Did tell him it was a mistake.”
at him. Harry returned the smile, slammed his eyes downward, and then unintentionally repeated the whole cycle again a few minutes later when his eyes naturally drifted upwards again. The worst part was, he couldn’t even think of a good subject for small talk. After a short stint about the weather, Harry found himself in a conversation topic desert, his natural awkwardness amplified ever more by his discomfort at the whole situation. Draco was the loquacious one, the one who could easily grease the wheels of social convention. Needless to say, Harry was not eager to face any other meals without his husband at his side.
He took a careful bite and discovered that it was just sweet potato. Rich people food was the
Or so Harry said, when he held Draco tightly and kissed him after these nights out. The strength of this embrace showed Draco more than mere words how much Harry valued his efforts to make nice with Harry’s friends. Draco, touched, vowed to keep at it.
“Yes!” Draco picked up his own wand and attempted the spell, but nothing happened. “Oh damn it all, I forgot. I had the jeweler craft it with Anti-Conjuration spells built in because I didn’t want your mass of adoring fans to try any funny business with
The affectionate way he said ‘bastard’ helped stave off a bit of Draco’s anxiety. “Possibly. I also read a lot as a child, and most of the books in the Manor were from that era. I wouldn’t be surprised if the syntax was ingrained into a baser level of my vocabulary.” He lifted his head slightly to glare in Harry’s general direction. “Now please address my original concern.”

continuing to serve one of the Black family. Draco gratefully accepted his help with cooking meals, at least, though he drew the line at letting Kreacher have any hand in Scorpius’s upbringing. Goodness knew what kind of vile things the traditional house elf would try to instill in him.
Draco still could not believe the amount of coincidences required to line up such that Harry became Scorpius’s babysitter, but he wasn’t complaining.
He ran his fingers up from the thick hair on Harry’s thighs, tracing it back to the happy trail and skimming his fingers up and up as it widened into Harry’s blanket of chest hair, his palms rubbing over the scars below Harry’s nipples as his thumbs stroked over the nipples themselves. Harry groaned and swept his hands over Draco’s body too, his hot mouth leaving sucking kisses that marked Draco’s skin bright red.

“I meant
Draco couldn’t help it, he had to look away to say this. “I am. Interested, that is. I’d thought you might be, that is to say, I didn’t want to push you too fast into anything...bodily… I… I…” Draco’s words left him, and all that was left were actions. He stood and crossed over to Harry, grasping his hands and leaning in for a kiss hungrier than what he usually allowed himself to show.
Draco fiddled nervously with his cuffs as he stood by the front door waiting for Scorpius’s potential new babysitter. Scorpius himself was in the kitchen with breakfast, his bag for daycare already packed. As long as this bloke Dursley knew was breathing and capable enough to pick Scorpius up from daycare, Draco presumed he could figure out the rest. Even if Scorpius continued his trend of making a mess of the entire house, he could deal with it. He might have a little mental breakdown or five, but that was alright. Please, please just let this man be decent—
Potter leaned closer, then traced his finger around Draco’s bill and down his neck. “Wait a moment… Draco?!”
Potter nearly spit out his pear. At his incredulous look, Draco elaborated, “Yes, I very much do mean impregnate. After a period of incubation, the spores would then trigger a labor event. Occasionally the Filoxenic Ferns have an upsetting tendency to emerge from their spores while still in the birth canal, in all their leafy glory.

And then he tugged Draco in for a long, enthusiastic kiss that they laughed too much through. That was alright, though, because Harry just kept kissing him again and again because it was, after all, the night Draco had proposed to him and he had to kiss him and show how much Draco meant to him.
Draco’s cheeks felt like they were on fire. “Ah,” he commented eloquently.

Draco smiled and kissed Harry thoroughly.
react badly if Draco tried asking Harry on a date?!
His evenings now frequently involved sitting with Harry and watching something on the telly. Harry insisted on making “popcorn”, which Draco outwardly griped about but inwardly cheered over. It was just a starchy vector for melted butter and salt, how could it be so good? Draco resented its deliciousness even as he downed handfuls of the stuff.

The next day off he had, he broached the topic. “Harry,” he said around a mouthful of honeydew. “Have you bought anything for yourself with the money I give you?”
A house elf popped into existence, different from the previous one. Curie held her hand palm in front of her chest and mimed pushing down several times.

“It’s so admirable that you don’t shy away from doing the work of the labor class,” Narcissa cooed.
happen. What do you think?”
Harry started playing a jazzy beat, the same one he’d been playing when Draco had walked in that very first day. But now Scorpius was coming in, only playing simple chords but doing them well. And Draco sang, having the time of his life in their private concert. The audience consisted only of Greg and Dudley, and the performance was far from perfect.
Harry smiled with a touch of a grimace. “Alright, definitely.”
“I’ll miss you.” Harry stuck out his lip exaggeratedly and turned on the puppy dog eyes he’d learned at two years old from Sirius.
given you the idea that I’d hold back if I thought you were being a berk or overstepping?”
Both of them immediately dove for the fast-sinking ring, and in the confusion one of them kicked away the drain cover.
He allowed himself to catch his breath, but as soon as he was physically able he reached down and fumbled in his bag until he reached the secret compartment. He dumped out the contents unceremoniously all over the console before him, then took a moment to spell the front of the train transparent so that his box looked more like a three-walled room open to the outside. The effect was one-way, of course. Even though the exterior of the train had built-in Notice-Me-Not Charms that activated when it was moving, Harry wasn’t taking any chances on his private exhibitionist kink
“Very good! Why don’t you see if you can find any other white ash trees in this backyard?”
And there
Draco stared, then pushed the plate with his second croissant across the table. Potter looked on the verge of refusing on principle, then seemingly remembered that he didn’t exactly have better options. He took the croissant, tore it to pieces, and began spreading jam and chocolate and honey. Draco was relieved to note that the variety of flavors were not all applied to the same piece of pastry.
Draco sobered and leaned in closer, which was a feat. “Harry Potter, will you do me the great honor of marrying me?”
Draco arched an eyebrow at him like a yawning lion. “You may pay for your own purchases, if you wish. Now come along, we’ve lots of shops to get to.”
“Daddy!” Scorpius dropped his armful of craft supplies and came crashing into Draco’s knees, wrapping him into a warm hug. Draco felt a little of his dismay at the mess melt away in the face of how adorable and loving his son was. “Yeah, I was good! Really good! Mr. Dursley said so!”
“Oh, well, er, I mostly stayed in. Did some gardening, had a go at the floors, brightened up the lower halls. You saw.”
Draco’s empty threat was cut off by Harry’s smooth length filling him in one stroke. He arched his hips, and the resulting change in position allowed Harry’s dildo to slip just that little bit further and rub the little bump inside him firmly.
“DAAAAAAADDYYYYYYY! I need to pee but the bathroom has monsters!”
Draco spoke first. “I suppose we should start with establishing a repertoire. I’ve taken the liberty of writing down a list of songs that I already know, and if you could do the same we can narrow down which ones we want to work on together. Now more importantly, we are lacking in an accompanist, and while I am certainly willing to enroll Scorpius in lessons, I can hardly expect him to be up to performance standard in such a short time frame—”
"Well, stop it! It’s entirely unnecessary for you to be

“I mean… she’s right about that. Have you
He turned the corner and found Scorpius, who seemed to be alive, healthy and...playing the drums?
Dudley Dursley, boyfriend to Gregory Goyle, sat immobile on the couch as Scorpius fluttered around him, adding more and more ribbons and bows and lacy things that Draco hadn’t even known he possessed. There were smears of paint all over Dursley and the couch and the walls.
His defiant tone sent Draco straight back to his usual attitude in dealing with prickly Potters. “What is it to you why I do things? Anyway, if you don’t want to accept the offer of living in the house I own and vacate for most hours due to work, I can easily retract my offer.”
Harry looked up from where he was casting Reparo on the dishware. The croissants hovered, having been saved from a dirty demise by Harry’s quick reflexes. “I was just kidding, Draco, chill. Did you really believe I’d think that?”
The house was quiet but for Scorpius’s occasional giggles. Draco followed the sound until he came to the living room, where he stopped short.
The overstretched feeling of Harry’s stomach had also disappeared. Nuni must have put an appetite-increasing potion in his drink! He glowed with happiness and affection as he cut into the sparkling globe and tucked into his dessert.

He surged forward to kiss Draco just as Draco reached out to pick up the ring and
Potter mrrped.
He opened the door and stepped inside.
Understandably, it took Draco a while to recognize that he’d been bamboozled into expanding his social circle. He’d initially dismissed the increase in people around his house as being solely for Scorpius. It wasn’t until the fifth time when the four of them settled in the living room with drinks and dessert after Scorpius was already in bed that Draco realized he had a

After dinner, Harry sat with Draco but excused himself from watching telly, saying he wanted to go to bed early. Draco felt a pang at the loss of his company for the evening but readily agreed.
didn’t mind. As he and Harry snuggled together, worn from their vigorous activities, he reflected how thankful he was that Harry had decided to get lucky.
He left the room, hearing tittering murmurs about “young love” as he gently guided the door closed behind him. When he was certain it was shut, he took off sprinting down the hall to Draco’s room. He flung the door open and skidded inside, throwing himself into the sheets to snuggle into his...absent husband?
Harry is the conductor for the Hogwarts Express, but the train only goes from one place to another and runs on magic. How else is he supposed to amuse himself on the 9.5 hour train ride?
“You’re getting ahead of yourself. You don’t even know if it works yet, and you’re thinking about sales?”
Draco sat, stunned, for a long time.
, his fingers digging into Harry’s hips.
Potter was next to him, an identical drumset set up. “Good, good, just like that!” Potter enthused, apparently heedless of the nonsensical banging that Scorpius was engaged in. “Now try this out!” He picked up his drumsticks and tapped out a rhythm that sounded like miniature explosions. Draco supposed he could appreciate that there

“Please,
“More,” Draco gasped. His body was flush with arousal from head to toe, and it was all Harry’s doing. Harry and his talented mouth and clever fingers, now two, now three, stretching out Draco’s hole and hitting
“Fine.” Harry was surprised to hear himself agree. “Now, what can I expect?”
He’d developed a skill set that included playing drumset, common plant identification, the basics of trumpet, crocheting stuffed animals, breakdancing, competitive weightlifting, street style skateboarding, masonry, haberdashery, 90s telly, cobbling, field hockey, and, apparently, babysitting. Draco wasn’t sure what half of those things were, but he could appreciate the sheer number of things that Harry was now half-versed in.
Draco sprang up and rounded the table, intent on catching Harry, but Harry was already dashing out of the kitchen.
“Are you happy with your body now, then?”
So he knew without a doubt that he could never act on these feelings.
“What?” Potter looked at him sharply. “Why would you do that?”
“Harry, I will throw up in your shoes while you’re still wearing them.”
With effort, Draco removed his foot from his mouth. “I’m...sorry. I didn’t know.”
They were housemates. This was a housemate-y dynamic. Right? So why did Draco’s heart pound wildly each time?
Greg looked at Draco then, really
something. Preferably that viney bastard. Why did we get into the business of Magical Species control again? Did you Imperius me?”
Potter was part of the landscaping group that managed the many magical plants that populated Malfoy Manor’s gardens. When they first met, Draco had made some snarky comment and Potter had instantly turned it around on him, and from that point Draco knew they were going to get along like a house on fire. He made it a point to visit and bother Potter whenever he was working on the grounds. Recently, he’d begun to wonder if he was imagining the way Potter trailed his fingertips just a little too close when they talked, grazing Draco’s skin and making his breath catch. There had been several distinct moments when he and Potter had spent a moment too long just staring into each other’s eyes. Draco wondered then if Potter was a Legilimens; was he picking up Draco’s own hints at the secret he held within?
Harry looked at him closely, then backed off with a sigh. “Okay.” He sank into the nearest couch. “I’m just worried, you know? Look, it feels weird to say this out loud, but I consider you a close friend, and I don’t want anything to ruin that.”
Harry ran a triple check that all the settings were proper and the locomotive spells were all in order. That took a grand total of two minutes. Harry patted himself on the back for a job well done. He’d earned his paycheck in 0.35% of the time he was scheduled to work!
Draco offers Harry a solution that starts with “Felix” and ends with “Felicis” to an ongoing struggle in their sex life. Hey, it’s not like his prostate has a well-lit sign pointing it out! There’s nothing wrong with needing a little help!
Potter shoved back from the table. “That’s exorbitant! I’ll take it.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Did you ask like

“Close enough.”

“I’m not actually sure,” Draco responded. “I think the Manor house elves usually did any kind of repair work, and they’re all dispersed now to wherever the fuck Mother and Father ran, so they’re not an option.” He paused. “Do you think the plumber will be attractive?”
going to think about that now!
“You’re such a beautiful thing, darling. So perfect, so good, so needy for me. Don’t worry about a thing, I’ll take care of you, you feel so good, I’m going to make you feel so good…” he babbled. Speaking coherent words was too difficult now. His whole world was composed entirely of two things: Harry, and his goal of fucking Harry’s brains out.
“So, Draco,” Harry said casually over breakfast. It was a beautiful morning on Draco’s day off, and they were eating the latest of Harry’s forays into baking. The croissants were perfectly buttery and flaky, unlike the past few days of dense pastry. “Do you not have a cock because of the generations of Pureblood inbreeding?”
“What were you even
At the end of the film, Draco gently would shake Harry awake and lead the grumbling man to his room. Harry usually demanded Draco tell him how the movie ended, so Draco sat on the toilet lid while Harry brushed his teeth and relayed the finer points of the plot. Afterwards, Draco made sure to turn off the bathroom light as Harry crossed the hall to his bedroom.
At lunchtime, though, he understood. Peeling away the cloth revealed white hyacinths, primroses, and anemone flowers. They were all protected from wilting or getting crushed with such an abundance of Barrier and Stasis Charms it made Draco sneeze.
He sighed gustily. And now Potter was a cat, and his friends would probably assume the worst and murder Draco on sight if he approached them with Potter-kitty.
Draco
The door shut with a soft click. The instant they were alone, Draco pounced on Harry and peppered his face with kisses. He understood, now, what Harry meant to do today. Each kiss was filled with the intent of conveying his gratitude and fortune of having this sweet man as his boyfriend/partner. For his part, Harry seemed to understand exactly what Draco wanted to say and kissed back just as lovingly.
“Er,” Draco gulped. “You’ve a boyfriend, then? Who might be able to watch Scorpius?”
, that was
Draco and Harry looked at each other.
That touch gave him the push he didn’t know he needed. “Potter,” Draco began. “I want— could we— perhaps— would you like to go on a date with me?”
“I think you and I can both agree that I could have done loads better,” Dursley chuckled. “It’s just, ah, growing up I didn’t exactly have the best example of how to be proper ‘round a child, in a discipline kind of way, you know? I was never told off for misbehaving, and then my parents...” he trailed off, biting his lip. “Well, they went the other extreme when it came to my younger cousin that was staying with us. I didn’t want to get anywhere
Harry resumed licking with fervor. In this new position, he could also use his hands more freely to ramp up Draco’s desire. When Draco felt Harry’s fingers brushing his lower lips more insistently than before, he shifted his hips forward encouragingly. “Not too deep,” he murmured.
It should be noted that giraffes could technically swim, albeit poorly. The same could be said for the relationship between Draco and Harry’s friends. They simply had not yet found common ground, and not for lack of trying. Still, it was clear that Weasley and Granger and Draco were all trying their best on Harry’s behalf, and at some point that effort would pay off.
before he
Draco turned to look at Dursley, who at least had the self-awareness to appear ashamed. But maybe that was Draco’s imagination, because the man was so covered in glittery paints and lacy ribbons that it was difficult to read any sort of facial expressions from him.
Over a truly decadent meal (Draco would definitely be going back to the Elf Eatery, because some of the staff are as talented as high-level chefs) Potter had provided a steady stream of chatter but also lapsed into silence at odd times. It made Draco want to prod, made him want to unravel Potter’s secrets and see his brain spread out like a map. That was probably a weird desire, but Draco was fairly sure there were no Legilimens nearby who would call him out on it.
“Stars above, you are
It was big. It was white. It had feathers. A jaunty viridian ribbon was tied around its neck in a huge bow. Draco gawked at the marble swan statue stained just so to look incredibly lifelike as it posed victoriously. His mother must have installed it recently, because he had eaten at this garden table only yesterday and there had been no swan then.
He’d been convinced that the first fancy restaurant Draco took him to after their discussion would be it. All through the multiple courses, Harry had chewed carefully so as to avoid accidentally biting down into hard metal jewelry or worse, choking on it. He was focused so hard on chewing carefully, in fact, that before he knew it he’d eaten almost all the courses and didn’t remember a single one. Instead of a ring in his dessert, though, he’d found a pair of amethyst cufflinks thoughtfully and artfully (and most importantly,

Kreacher, once he’d been introduced to Draco’s household, had looked close to tears at the prospect of
“Not that!” Harry protested. He was in Draco’s space again, kneeling this time so he was looking up at Draco. “The other part. About… you know…
The pieces started slamming into place. Draco had figured out he was some flavor of aromantic long ago. It seemed that his specific variety included developing crushes on friends named Harry Potter.
a rhythm at all. In fact, it was the rhythm of a song he knew well from his childhood.
Lucius and Narcissa did the same.
Draco blinked in surprise. “If you’d like. But it’ll be crowded, and I know that’s not your preference—”
provide Scorpius adequate guardianship? He was fairly sure this recent uptick in Scorpius’s misbehaviors was due to feeling neglected and bored. However, it was out of the question to bring him along to the workplace—for one, Scorpius attended day school, and secondly, the effects of potions fumes were unstudied in young children. Frankly speaking, Draco didn’t even feel comfortable thinking of Hogwarts students running around in the Potions classrooms where a mistaken ingredient could wreak silent, unchecked, toxic havoc that could lie undetected for years. No, Scorpius would stay well away from Draco’s experimental potions lab until he was above the age of majority.
to that with Scorp, and I suppose I ended up on the ‘too-indulgent’ side of things. And then when he started magicking the ribbon out of nowhere, I really felt in over my head.”
It had been a long time since Draco called upon his background of being a professional rich child with tutors for every impractical activity under the sun, and even longer since his long ago vocal lessons and his short-lived, ill-fated jazz lessons. They were not doomed due to disinterest on Draco’s part; in fact, he’d loved Mr. Armstrong’s lessons more than the riding or calligraphy or embroidery lessons. No, the fault with the American wizard had been in attracting Lucius’s attention. Draco’s father had balked at the thought of his son learning anything so uncouth, and from a common wizard at that.
The lamp on the nearby table toppled to the ground. Parchment scrolls scattered everywhere. A table overturned. Still, the bookcase would not fall!
“Wait.” Draco stood and twisted to indicate Harry. “I wanted to introduce you to my…” he glanced at Harry and raised his brow. Harry shrugged. “...boyfriend and/or partner, Harry Potter. Harry, this is Celine Trinh, without whom this institution would crumble.”
“I’m reasonably certain it works on animals, anyway. Oh don’t look at me like that, of course I didn’t try it until I thought it worked already. Those mice had the time of their little mouse lives.”
“I will,” Harry replied to Celine’s retreating back.
Draco stared at him but decided to pursue that subject later. “All that aside, I have observed that you tend to spend more on things mutually used by the both of us rather than for you alone. For instance, I notice your wardrobe is about five outfits, all of which needed replacing about five years ago.”
The house elf gave a thumbs up and disappeared.
“Don’t worry about that, now do you want me to call him or not?”
“Yes D-Draco,” Harry replied tightly, brow furrowed deeply in concentration. “But I am
The loud whistle of the Hogwarts Express sounded, signaling the start of Harry’s boredom.
“Ah, well… I got a book and a telly?”
Draco’s fingers slowly reached for his wand, wondering how feasible it would be to cast a strong Wingardium Leviosa on himself to propel him out of this house and away from the ramifications of his outburst. He refused to take back the words, because they were true, but he certainly hadn’t
Potter’s mouth was hanging open as well, but that changed as his lips quirked up into a smirk. “I don’t think it is,” he commented. “You see,

Who cares if those same crimes resulted in ending Voldemort, right?” He huffed a dry laugh. “The only things I own now are the things I had on me during the war which were, uh, not much.”

“I don’t know if that’s a good idea, darling—”
“Good. Now, why don’t you show me exactly what you and Greg did today?”
Harry glanced to the side, his face unreadable. “But I—I don’t want to owe you any more than I already do…”
"Draco, what the everloving
Eventually, Draco pulled back and guided Harry to the tub, helping him to lower himself into it. Harry then watched his boyfriend grab an item from the mess of hair- and skincare products on his side of the sink and bring it over. He crouched down to show Harry what it was.
In the warm sunlight streaming through the windows, the sweet taste of pears still lingering on his tongue, and the sounds of laughter in the air, Draco was glad he’d found Potter.
“Good night, Draco,” Harry replied with a small smile. “Sweet dreams.”

Goose Draco had no such concerns. Goose Draco now heard Potter rustling around, checking on the rare breeds of magical plants and perceived him as another target of his goosely world domination.

Draco glared. “There’s no need for that tone. I made a very reasonable request. What’s

Lucius gave a warm smile in approval. “It would be our honor to accommodate you,” he pronounced. At his look, one of the chairs across from where he and Narcissa sat scooted back, not even wrinkling the rug beneath it.
"So—" Harry began.
friends. “It’s hard for a guy not to feel like he’s being hidden away, you know!” Harry huffed in annoyance.
The first time Harry had wandered down with the intention of nipping a cheesy toast for breakfast before returning to fuck his husband’s brains out, he had ended up being ushered to sit at the table and awkwardly looking up every few seconds and making eye contact with Lucius, who
“And what would keep it from marching the
Harry moved in with Draco and, once Draco had completed his apprenticeship, followed Draco to work every morning except on the days he had Mind Healing sessions. He’d still had no idea what to do with his life, which was when Draco asked if he’d mind being the storefront that would sell Draco’s potions.
Like most naked pillow fights do, this one ended with more writhing and moaning (decidedly
“Exactly. Which is why I’m taking you out today.”
Eventually, though, Draco noticed that the rug in his living room was different. And there were new trees in his garden that he hadn’t realized had been recently planted. He spied one of the new magic-adapted televisions sitting innocently yet ominously in the cupboard.
And then he brought out from his room the book that Draco had never seen the contents of, the one he worked away at every evening and snapped shut when Draco bade him good night. Now, Harry was standing by the sofa, opening the book, and shoving it beneath Draco’s nose.
Draco could admit to himself that he enjoyed being able to provide care for someone else.
“Oh yes, dear Lucius is likely the largest source of profits for the Sleekeazy Potion. You may as well hand him 51% of the company!” Narcissa tittered.
Harry gave back as good as he got.
fit his criteria, both for childcare and bed partner preferences—no he was
By the time he’d removed his undershirt and his pants, his cock sprang out rock hard and leaking at the tip. Harry ignored it for the moment. He was barely into this nine hour train ride, there would be plenty of time to get off later.
After work, Draco would come home and observe that Potter had found some other way to improve his home that he hadn’t even realized was a problem until Potter had fixed it up. Always, Potter would have some kind of fruit or snack waiting for him. Draco would insist on sharing the food while sharing their days, and then Draco would help prepare dinner. Otherwise, he felt a bit too much like he had hired the Boy Who Lived to be his live-in maid.
Draco leaned in close and booped Potter gently on the nose, then reclaimed his wing.
Draco dug his thumbs in in retaliation. “Naughty. I was going to suggest you get in the bath. I picked something up from Luna’s shop that looked interesting. It’s supposed to be relaxing.”
“So, Potter. Tell me about your day.” Okay. Okay. He could come back from this. It wasn’t the end of the world. But Merlin on a beach ball, what a lame way to start a conversation! He’d be lucky if Potter didn’t laugh him out of his own house.
And then Harry lasted in the Auror training program exactly three days before writing up a resignation letter and dropping it off on his way to St Mungo’s to book an appointment with a Mind Healer. Fortunately, he had savings that allowed him to concentrate on getting his mental health in order rather than stressing about affording to survive. This also meant he’d often spend hours and hours wandering outside, mostly in Muggle parks. Which was where he’d met Draco Malfoy getting attacked by pigeons, an open bag of corn and bread crumbs visible in his hand.
Harry frowned. Draco clearly hadn’t been here, but if that was the case, where could he be?
“Sure, why not.” Harry figured, once a Gryffindor, always a Gryffindor, also known as “OAGAAG”. Somehow, it wasn’t catching on among his friends. Something easier to say like “You live one time and that’s it” would work better, but that came out to “YLOTATI”, which wasn’t much shorter or simpler. He definitely needed to think more about this.
the thing I’m not sure it should count.”
Draco laughed, holding Harry’s head against his chest, ignoring his muffled protests and yells. “Now now, you can still romance me even if I’ve told you I love you already.”
Cuddling also allowed Harry to feel more of Draco’s body. He’d been expecting questions, because there hadn’t really been a good time to come out to Harry and at this point he figured it was better to let Harry ask whatever he wanted to ask. There were no scars on his chest besides the ones from the bathroom in sixth year; however, Draco knew that Harry would be able to feel the absence of any sort of bulge in his crotch area.
Now it really felt like he was positioned before a huge picture window, a looking glass for horny people to view the object of their desire: Harry’s naked body. At least, that was the fantasy he told himself as he picked up the smallest of the dildos on the table and slicked it up with lube. It was very thin, but Harry found it easier to stretch his hole with these rather than his fingers because of the angle.
“On it.” Celine stood and with one stride was already halfway out the door.
With his guard down, Draco had had to begrudgingly accept that Harry was not nearly so boorish as Draco had thought. In fact, he was rather charming and genuine once Draco allowed himself to get to know him. As the weekend passed, Draco found himself spilling his innermost thoughts to Harry, who responded in kind. It made Draco feel special. It made Draco feel wanted.
Who said that children were bad for relationships? Draco secretly ordered Teddy an enormous plushie and told Harry he should bring the kid round more often.
On seeing his father start to dance, Scorpius leapt up with a cry and grabbed onto his leg, twirling and jumping. Potter was laughing as well, easily taking over Scorpius’s kick drum duties and following Draco’s improvised lines.
Draco’s chest squeezed in panic, but through long practice he suppressed the emotion and continued his steady patting of Scorpius’s hair. “I’m glad you had fun, darling. Sleep well and good night.”
with him? “The new rug is really comfortable and warm. And I’m excited to see how the trees do next spring!”
He blamed his surprisingly pleasant mood for his current situation.
“W-e-l-l…” Harry said, drawing out the word. “It’s been about three months since we’ve started dating, and we really haven’t done much more than kissing and cuddling. Not to say I don’t like those, not at all! But I did wonder whether you were interested in going further.”
It had been four years since Draco had asked him out. Four years of emotional highs and lows and everything in between. Harry was over the moon that he’d found a partner who was so incredibly perfect for him. Their reconnection after the war had started with a spark that kindled into a slow-burning inferno as the two of them built their relationship anew, from former rivals to enemies to friends to lovers.
Harry usually made it about two-thirds of the way through a film before getting sleepy. Draco took to keeping a throw blanket on the back of the couch so that when Harry’s head landed on his shoulder, he could wandlessly flick the blanket to cover Harry. Sometimes he found himself fighting the mysterious urge to wrap his arm around Harry’s back and draw him into a more comfortable,
“Honk!” cried Draco, intentionally nuzzling deeper into Potter’s embrace.
“Huh,” Harry said eloquently. Draco couldn’t believe his heart had made him yearn for this man. “As for the… other thing. I don’t really see why that’s such a big issue that you think I’d have to leave because of it? I mean, sure, if you thought I didn’t like you, but surely you know that I like you enough to respect your feelings?”
Draco crashed onto his bum in the doorway to his own flat. He looked down in disbelief: the projectile was actually a small human! When he glanced up again, his flatmate was framed in the doorway grimacing sympathetically.
Draco tensed up, about to come, and that was when Harry pulled back, resisting Draco’s instinctive attempts to keep him down.
Harry snapped his fingers in front of Draco’s face, jerking his attention back to him. “I know you’re not being honest with me, Draco Malfoy!” His tone softened, and he leaned back. “If you don’t want to talk about it, you don’t have to, but please at least tell me if I’ve done something to upset you?”
“Sure,” Harry agreed easily. He sliced into his last pancake and brought it to his lips. Draco watched syrup ooze down and drip onto his plate before tearing his eyes away, heart pounding. What was
“You ambushed me in the shower for this?” Draco cried instead of answering.
.” He eyed Scorpius carefully.
Harry stopped following the conversation because behind Lucius, a new house elf had suddenly appeared. Nuni tilted her head at Harry inquisitively. He glanced desperately at the treacle tart globe, patted his belly, then looked back up at Nuni, hoping she would understand his message.
Harry took a deep breath and went on. “My whole life, I’ve been lacking in people taking care of me. Before the war, definitely, and since the war, not really. My friends, the Weasleys… it always felt like I was intruding. Not like home. Here?” He gestured broadly across the entire room. “Here feels like home. I feel like you support me, and I am not only perfectly fine that way, I
Maybe he should bring Harry along to work more often.
He swung his feet over the edge of the bed, chugged three glasses of Aguamenti-ed water, then got dressed so he felt a bit more like a human being. As he opened the door, the clinking sounds of tableware wafting up the corridor suddenly imparted three facts onto his brain.
“Ah, sorry, was I not supposed to? I’m really sorry, I don’t mean to overstep—”
Teddy thought for a moment. “Okay!”
“Apology unnecessary, but accepted,” Draco replied briskly. He sank into the sofa and flapped his hand at Harry until he sat in the armchair. “Now, speaking of which, I have to apologize to you.”
“Lucius, did you do something new with your hair?” Harry asked dutifully. He made sure to lean forward slightly and widen his eyes to sell the acting. “It looks especially, er, luscious tonight.”
The vagueness in his voice utterly disturbed Draco. He felt a swell of feeling overcome him. Potter just looked so vulnerable and at odds, and Draco couldn’t help himself. He dragged Potter to a nearby cafe, bought four fluffy croissants, and verbally shook Potter down until the answers he wanted jangled out.
None of this seemed applicable to Potter-kitty. Draco peered dubiously at the feline cowering below the bed and then regarded his bare bits. No, Draco did not want to put Potter-kitty’s claws anywhere near his lap. And this window looked directly into the neighboring flat rather than a calm lake, so that was also out.
