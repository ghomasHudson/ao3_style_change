Isaac looked at the beautiful dark blue potion with shooting star like streaks of rainbow wisps and pouted, "I wanna help too."
It was already an eventful day, but it wasn’t done yet. Harry still needed other things so he went shopping. About a weeks worth of groceries made the wizard’s hands full already so he subtly went into an empty bathroom and slipped all the bags into the bottomless bag … after paying for them of course.
“night professor!” the twins said the password and the Fat Lady opened her door though she looked a little startled since she couldn’t see the student talking to her. Right after the twins disappeared behind the door Severus dropped the spell and let out an amused sigh as he heard all the portraits chattering about his personal business. Not that it mattered really. This is the last year he had too hide his life away from Dumbledore.
Frank snarled as he spotted the only other werewolf in the area “he’s right to warn you. A person’s scent may change slightly over time, but if that guy over there was a friend of your father he could’ve marked you as his cub so he would find you easily” he whispered as they backed away from the bank. He kept a close eye on the only other werewolf present resting for a bit against the gates who would’ve run right into Harry if not for the wards blocking out Harry.
Out of habit Ron opened his mouth to say something insulting towards snakes, but stopped and thought about what that fact really meant, "So … Voldemort wasn't the heir to Slytherin? … what basilisk?!"
"We have to move. They knew we're here," Draco said, standing up and heading to their small but big on the inside tent.
"Nick Fury. Director of Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division, SHIELD for short. I work with the Avengers."
Hermione, on the other hand who was hiding beneath her desk, cast a charm that would transmit her voice to the whole building, "Attention. This is Minister Hermione Granger. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are in the building. I repeat, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are in the building! All staff either take cover or help find Draco Malfoy." She ended the charm and stood up, casting a spell to detain Harry.
"Okay. Okay. You'll catch me up later. Wait. Important question. Who were the DADA teachers your 6th and 7th year. "
It was a stressful thought, all your friends being able to die but not you. Them, all looking older and you still looking 17. Them, being able to get drinks with no question and you having to pull out your ID because you look so damn young when in reality, you're their same age. Okay, maybe not so much the last one.
Draco rolled up his sleeve and showed the Mark again, not paying attention to the other people watching.
"And it kept going from there. We never established anything, but I think everyone knew we kinda liked each other. Even Teddy could feel the sexual tension and he was a child. Four years after his mom died, he became Head Healer and seeing as I was Head Auror, we had to discuss things regarding everything. We never did anything crazy, maybe a couple kisses and a one-night stand, we were just friends. I had heard the rumors that the Ministry thought I was going crazy for befriending a Malfoy. But I obviously ignored them, you know how much I enjoy avoiding things like that. Then I found out they were true. At the ten year anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, before the speeches and when Draco got shot, I heard some wizards and witches gossiping when they saw me talking to Draco. They worked under Shacklebolt too! Kingsley was the Minister at the time. I heard them saying that they were only there to make sure I didn't go crazy and end up killing everyone there and become a new Dark Lord. Apparently, Kingsley thought Little Harry Potter would follow in Voldemort's foot steps. I had all the traits too. Master of the Elder Wand, friends with a Malfoy, power that not even he knows of, immortal, y'know, the usual Dark Lord stuff.
Draco smiled, grabbing a glass, setting it on the table and grabbed some whiskey and poured it in the glass, "Enjoy, Sir Knight."
“Yeah. Scorpius Leandro Potter. He's perfect. Right now, I'm thinking Ravenclaw, he loves learning. But he's also very sneaky and caring and rebellious."
Overseas, a couple minutes earlier, a confused Draco Malfoy, an amazed Teddy Lupin and a once bleeding, but now completely fine Harry Potter landed in London, 83 years in the past and on a different Earth, one with superheroes instead of wizards. Not that they know that. Yet.
"I tried firing him but the Board didn't let me to show 'not all ex-Death Eaters are bad!' I know that because of Draco but my students were more important than the Ministry mantra." Teddy said.
"It's okay, Pietro." Teddy finally opened his eyes and stared into his blue eyes. "You'll be okay. I'll see you again eventually. Don't worry. Tell them I love them. Give a kiss to Scorpius for me, okay?"
"The suspect acts like a normal person. He gets up in the morning, goes to work at the NYPD, gets sent on a dangerous case, brings in the perp with ease, goes home to his husband and son, goes to bed, and starts all over again," Agent Romanoff started.
Sirius slowly walked towards Severus. His Patronus spell faded and he holstered his wand. When he got close enough to Severus he just stared at him for a couple seconds. Then, he grabbed his collar and pulled him into a kiss.
Harry immediately stood up facing Arthur, hand on the hilt of his sword, as if daring him to do anything. "If you hurt him, I will hurt you."
"Harry." Severus said from the doorway. "Why are you spending more time in the library than with your son?"
Turns out, they were going the right way. They found a room being blocked off by chitauri (also inconspicuously killed by Loki). Inside, Thanos was sitting on a throne, looking at what looked like a monitor.
Draco's reaction to the nursery was amazing. He had cried a lot and just hugged Harry the whole time. He thanked Severus, Sirius, Teddy and Steve profusely before starting to cry again. He had sat in the rocking chair for a good 30 minutes just rubbing his belly and looking around.
Harry nodded while running down to the basement to grab a cauldron and the ingredients needed. He came back upstairs and put his stuff down next to Draco.
Snape went quiet for a bit before he nodded. "I know the basics of wand making, I might be able to help with that. Is there anything else?"
"You have a lot to catch up on, Bruce." Sirius, who was also in dragonhide armor, said, as he put away his wand after hearing who it was and walked into the room, also going in to hug Bruce.
"It was called Dumbledore's Army, the DA. It fell apart after the fight at the Ministry. Or the Department of Mysteries Battle, as the
She had been too selfish to think that Harry would do something like what he did for no reason. No, all those years ago, on the 10th anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, it wasn't him rebelling or going against the Ministry, it was him protecting his love. He loved Draco, even before the attack. How had she never noticed? She was supposed to be the brightest witch of her generation and she didn't notice her best friend was in love with Draco.
"He and Harry have been through it. They were cast out from their home because of something that wasn't even true. Harry was almost killed every year from ages eleven to seventeen. Draco's father raised him to believe that because of blood purity he was above everyone else. Draco was forced to join the group of people supporting Harry's almost killer." Steve explained.
"Alright, fine," Harry walked over to Draco and pulled out the Elder Wand. He had been working on controlling his power with the wand in the past years. Now, he didn't have the whispers in his ear all the time when using the wand, only when he was really, really emotional. "Let your magic out. Don't think about using your wand. Try to do it wandless."
Sirius did as he was told and watched as the bleeding stopped for a good minute before it started again.
"Uh, sure. I'll just, uh, go get something to eat." Tony said, finishing the part of the arm he was working on and got up. He left the lab and went down to the communal floor.
Sirius nodded and turned into his animagus. It was the same black dog that Harry recognized from third through fifth years. The supposed grim that Trelawney said was his death omen for the year.
They ended up getting married on May 2nd, 2048. They chose that day so they could remember it as something else and not just the 50th anniversary of the day Harry died or the day Voldemort was destroyed. Of course, the marriage hadn't been legal since they couldn't get a priest or sign the papers, so whenever they took over the Ministry, they would do it legally.
He heard battle cries and one comforting voice telling him it was going to be okay. He recognized that voice as Pietro. Once again, his hair was shifting between blue and his natural brown. He then remembered that he had never told Pietro how he felt.
The most recent energy burst like the one that brought Harry, Draco and Teddy to this world was ten years ago. There were a total of seventeen of those energy bursts. Some were the same level as the Potters', but that didn't explain anything except that there were three people with them.
When Draco was finally getting closer to his due date, he was basically on house arrest. No one let him leave his room in his house, not even Scott who was one of the most immature Avengers (but he was mature when necessary). All Draco could do was read some books that Wanda brought him when she last came to the house. Harry was basically always at his bedside except when he went to bring food, water or whatever Draco wanted. The pregnancy was honestly getting really annoying and he just wanted to be able to get back to his daily normal life. He and Harry had agreed on a name for their son but still hadn't told anyone what it was so it could be a surprise for whenever he was finally born and introduced into the world.
"What is it you want to say, Merlin?" Arthur said, rubbing his temples out of stress, tiredness or anxiety, Merlin didn't know.
Arthur caught his glare, "Your adopted brother, I assume?" Loki nodded, "My half sister tried to kill me. Multiple times."
The trio made their way to a empty room. Draco held to the two men and apparated in front of their house. Tony activated his suit.
"What about Sirius Black? Or Draco Malfoy? Or..." Another man with short brown hair said. He was standing next to the woman, who had her eyes placed solely on Merlin.
"You mean your husband and your son? They stay where they are. You wouldn't have to move, just go work on cases once in a while outside of New York," Fury explained. He would have to put Potter with a trusted Agent so they could look after him, making sure nothing weird happens.
"They were both arrested for something they didn't do. Plus, Harry is my godfather and Draco is my cousin." Teddy said before walking off, motioning the rest to join him.
Fury didn't even bother stopping, just showed the man at the main desk a fake FBI badge and made his way to the elevator. He went up to Potter's floor and found his desk.
Hi darlings. There might be another chapter up this week since I am really behind on my updating schedule and I feel terrible about that. I'm probably gonna be updating every other week now on Saturday or Sunday.
When they got no further response from Mordred, they snapped back into reality. The others had been talking to themselves. Arthur, Gwaine and Draco has thought they just need to stop talking for a bit, so they let them be.
Loki then somehow teleported next to him and looked at the wound. He was using his magic to heal it when Sirius disappeared into dust.
"It's a sign of happiness, I guess. It's a white-blue misty animal that represents you and your true love or someone important to you. When I was younger, my Patronus was a stag, just like my fathers. Now, it's a dragon. One of their main purposes is holding back dementors. Dementors suck the soul out of you and replays your worst experience while a patronus uses a powerful, happy memory to fight it back. In third year, when Sirius escaped, we had Dementors circling the school. During the train ride, a dementor got in the train while looking for Sirius. Everything got cold. I could hear a woman's scream. Then I passed out, but Remus, who was in the same train compartment as us, cast a patronus and sent it away. I later found out that the woman's scream was my mothers before she died to Voldemort."
When they finally got to the compound, Draco ran to the nursery and picked up his baby. "Oh, my darling. You just had to say you're first word when I was away, didn't you?"
In 2014, many things happened. Steve found out that his best friend (and crush, not that he'd admit it), Bucky Barnes, was alive and working for HYDRA, a secret Russian organization whose one of many goals is to to destroy SHIELD. Which they partially succeeded in. Barnes now had a metal arm and had no clue who Steve was. It was sad for Steve. Harry tried to help him through it, but he couldn't truly understand since he'd never been through it himself. All the SHIELD files were leaked into the public. Harry was out of a job until he finally accepted Nick Fury's offer for joining the Avengers.
They seemed shocked at the sight of Bruce but once they had gotten over the shock they smiled and got back to work.
Merlin felt cold. Apparently he wasn't the only one, watching Guinevere pull her robe closer to herself and Leon shiver.
"Who's going to watch Scorpius?" Severus asked. Normally, he would be the one to stay behind to watch the kid, but seeing as they were Dementors, he had to go.
"I don't have one. I was recently informed that Harry Potter left me a vault? My name is George Weasley."
In case you didn't know, there will be a sequel to this. It won't be posted for a bit, but if you'd like to get updated on when that'll be up, below this, there'll be a "Series this work belongs to... Part 1 of Et Inter". If you click on the Et Inter title, you can bookmark, subscribe or whatever you have to do and you'll be updated on when the sequel is out (or you can just subscribe/bookmark my account)!
"Fury put me in charge of him. He's the newbie he's been ranting about." Barton explained but his eyes said something different. Something along the lines of 'it's him'.
Snape sighed. "'Look at me.' I said them because as I was supposedly dying, I wanted to see Lily's eyes again."
Harry considered what Severus was saying. "So we have to bring everyone back and then the balance will be restored and the bracelet won't be cracked anymore."
"Alright," He stuck his arms up in surrender, chuckling softly. "I believe I'm supposed to train. Director's orders."
Then came the landing. Tony and Stephen pulled the controls to try to land the donut but it didn't really work and they crashed anyways. Teddy looked up when he heard Peter say something about someone being aboard the ship. He pulled his wand out and got ready.
Him and the squire walked to the Great Hall. He was mesmerized at the reminder of Hogwarts. By how much it was reminding him of the school, he would've thought that either the Camelot castle was Hogwarts or that Hogwarts was so behind regarding modern times that it looked like a castle from the Medieval era.
The married couple was standing in the living room, Draco looking a bit nervous while Harry looked ecstatic. The rest of the Potters were sitting on the various couches.
A sudden light flash caused everyone to shield their eyes. When the light disappeared a man dressed in blue and green was on the floor coughing.
Steve, Bucky, Wanda and Vision were already awake. Tony and Peter were the next was to wake up. Then it was T'Challa, Scott, Rhodey, Sam, Clint and Natasha.
"You know how how we were gonna have a baby girl while were we still in our world?" Draco waited for them to nod before continuing, "Well, I'm pregnant again."
Getting Loki to help him turned out to be easier than expected. In his words, "I always love messing with people. This could be very fun."
"It's his fault the Death Eaters got into Hogwarts and that Dumbledore is dead! If he had still been here, my Colin would still be alive. He deserves to die!"
Snape looked at Teddy and sighed. "I'm assuming he was raised by Potter, seeing as Draco would probably never let a child dye their hair."
Somehow, Tony convinced the Potters to come to a small Halloween party with just the Avengers and some close friends. There was alcohol, thank Merlin.
"He's my son..." Sirius whispered. "I may only his godfather, but he's as good as my son. Even though I chose to leave him when he needed me the most."
"Yeah. I'm making a speech. No surprise there. I'm more surprised that McGonagall didn't ask me until like three days ago." Harry chuckled slightly.
"I'm ready. Lead the way." Harry said, the same smile on his face as he had for all the post-war interviews.
The director made an odd face at that, "Then find out who it belongs to. There isn't a single person on Earth who isn't in the system."
"It's actually Potter, now. And mother was very accepting of my friendship with Harry. She even encouraged me to ask him out."
Harry stood up and walked out of the room, not realizing everyone was watching him. He made his way over to his sons room and opened the door slowly.
He felt everything. Every death, every birth, every stab wound, every Killing Curse, every Torture Curse. But after that, he felt every hug, every kiss, every I love you, every promise, every happy ending.
She wondered what they were up to. Then her mind drifted to the boy Scorpius. In 7 years for them, he would be turning 11, meaning that he would've been going to Hogwarts. Would they try to make a Sorting Hat to see what House he was in?
So Severus Snape was left no choice … he reached into his pocket and slipped one solitary drop of a potion from the vial in the pocket onto the werewolf’s half eat sandwich when Frank wasn’t looking.
“chaos, shear unadulterated chaos. They have no choice over their beloved savior’s life and they can’t dragged him anywhere he doesn’t want to go, but they will think he was taken and everyone will scramble to find him. Before they put all their resources into finding Harry the goblins will announce the truth about Julian. I think they’ll go heavy on the abuse details, but before that comes I’m going to deal with those who
The two wizards followed Draco's eyes to the apartment door and saw that it was wide open with several creatures watching them. The only one that moved was Sanguini who simply pulled Severus close, but the look in his eyes was the same as the others. They were all willing to help ...
“a side effect of the loyalty spells you were exposed to throughout your childhood” Severus said making it clear there was much more to the boy’s attitude than being a weak minded fool.
"I submitted a potion a it was-oof!" Cache grunted as Neville nearly leapt into his arms in a big hug.
“I confined him to my quarters until he calms down” Percy said and after hugging his sister he lead the transfiguration professor to Ron leaving Ginny, the twins, Cache and Severus mostly alone. Poppy and, more importantly, the boy were too far away to hear anyway so it was as close to being alone as they could get.
"Normally yes, but not this time. Ring." She gave a 'hand it over' motion. He did only to deadpan when he saw her press it to a little hanging picture of St. Mungo's symbol. A picture, by the way, that he could have reached even easier than her. "Thanks! I always wanted to do that!" She grinned as gave the ring back and reached into the passage hidden behind the picture to pull out some papers. "Here are the amazing results- … you ok?" She asked when she realized Cache was staring at the picture.
Harry frowned as he raced after the goblin (I can understand not being able to keep up with Professor Snape, but goblins too … I need to get an exercise routine going) he thought as he was lead to a room.
"The Crippens are the only other muggle people I know and they made it possible for me to be here by getting my trackers out of the country, albeit unknowingly. They're good people and they only reported that Harry Potter contacted them claiming that he found his godfather and was safe." Harry said, but found himself meeting the no nonsense look in the silver eyes and chuckled. "Ok, ok. The reason I went through them was to imply that I was still in muggle world."
“just because he calls me Dad doesn’t mean he is calm around me all the time. Harry gets scared easily, which is understandable considering what he went through. I just want him to have two people he knows there so he won’t be too scared” said Brian as he saw Harry run over his room and come back with a small figure of a basilisk charmed to slither around and hiss “he seems to like the serpents the best” Brian chuckled as Harry seemed to pretend to listen to the snake.
“I recommend another set of Nutrition potions and taking a blood restore once for three days to restore your iron. You look pale” she said now concerned about the boy.
“Draco could’ve …” Narcissa felt dizzy at the mere thought of losing her baby boy and she couldn’t find the strength to complete the sentence.
An older man popped in a moment later “hello, I’m Jack. I was told by Griphook you wish to keep your identity hidden so I’ll point out I am oath bound so don’t worry. Just hold still, this won’t take but a moment” the healer spoke so fast that Harry even got a chance to speak before the wand was pointed at the young wizard. Jack took note of the boy’s flinch before casting the spell. The amount of paper that detailed past injuries that came out of the wand horrified both the healer and Griphook when he returned … Jack left soon after to file everything away.
Brian hummed in thought “there’s Aquamarine, Sapphire, Quartz … oh, and Tanzanite … and Spinel … that’s all the ones I know” he said as he stopped in front of a public floo.
"What happened? Where's Ron? Tell me, Arthur! Something happened during those ridiculous detentions, didn't it?" Molly demanded.
“I see his eyesight was fixed and a large number of scars were removed” Severus said with approval. The goblins noticed that some treatment began just before the adoption, but considering the severe circumstances they decided to fudge a few things and not ask questions. Severus, however, decided to ask why Julian’s bone rebreaking took place in Australia before the guardians signed over custody in a more private setting … and more importantly, he wanted the names of the people who abused Julian.
The thought of slashing the old wizard’s throat open with the sharp letter opener on the desk was very tempting, but the potion master refrained. Brian and Severus had a long talk and both were in agreement. No one must know about Harry being adopted and becoming Julian. The little boy was in no condition to put up with anything the UK or Dumbledore will do and Julian shouldn’t have to. It wasn’t anybody’s business. Severus agreed to make sure Ms. Figg and the Dursleys keep up as usual so no one knows a thing. When the time comes for people to be waiting to see Harry Potter at Hogwarts Julian River White will be revealed. Even now no one can do anything, but by then Julian will be old enough to understand and healthy enough to put up with the inevitable tantrum … not that Severus or Brian will allow anyone to try anything …
“yes” Trocar remarked as he turned away and zipped over to the fireplace. He paused in a moment of surprise as he saw a cloaked Armel standing protectively next to Harry and Frank, but shrugged it off. That pause gave Severus just enough time to join them before the flames of the floo to take them away.
“s-she means well, she even gave me my Dad’s wand. It’s doesn’t help that I’m one step away from being a squib” Neville said in his grandmother’s defense, but only succeeded in making the vampire and his pupil look at him blankly. Clearly they weren’t convinced. In fact both were sure Neville’s grandma just wanted a duplicate of her son and was trying to force Neville into those shoes. That didn’t make her a bad person, but it wasn’t the right thing to do.
Cache chuckled, "It was what lead to my Nerve Tonic-well … not exactly. I made a simple potion to color my hair and eyes and I needed a binder. I only had kneazle whiskers at the time, but when I saw what the kneazle whisker did I used regular untreated kneazle whiskers and later on a different binder. The Nerve Tonic was only
Julian opened his eyes and gaped as he found himself in a room filled with towers of old books, junk and furniture “what the hell?! … how did I get here? All I did was blink and then I was here … where did everyone go?” asked a startled wizard.
“your set up is quite different, but it is safe assuming you were taught shield charms …” Severus glanced at Trocar.
Most people here, especially vampires, would be waiting for the stores to open and the sun to disappear. He shrugged it off as Lyra mewed and the three of them went up the stairs. There were 20 or more vampires and 17 werewolves currently living here, but there was no sign of anyone on any floor. Harry frowned as he stood outside his apartment door, but walked in anyway. To his shock his apartment was filled with dark creatures and … colorful packages?
Dumbledore was not happy that they weren’t there controlling the brat. If Harry had a massive burst of accidental magic that would explain how he got away and perhaps they ran off when they saw that he got out instead of doing their jobs. He paid good money for them to keep Harry under lock and key, but he’ll try to contact them after he gets Harry back under his thumb
“of course I do! If not for everything you did for me then for the simple reason that I didn’t get you a birthday present” Harry as he quickly checked his disguise in a small mirror on the wall.
’ Julian said calming the occamy down even though what Draco said did hurt his feelings “I’m sorry, but I’m not evil. My Daddy says so and that those people were just mean” he said firmly making Draco look at him in confusion. His Daddy always says he is not a freak or any different than anyone else and he believed him. Julian also remembered that his Daddy said that if someone does say anything like that to him he should remember that he’s loved and to not take what that person says seriously because it’s not true “would you like to play with Mickey?” he offered pointing to the happy wolf plush rolling on the ground at their feet.
Barely a few steps out of the floo and into the more muggle office like building Severus heard a little voice “Uncle Sev”
Harry chuckled, "Ok, ok. How about this?" He pulled out the certificate and set it on the table. Draco smiled and was about to congratulate Harry, but Harry held up a finger to signal he wasn't done yet before getting up to bring over a lamp. The lamp was a regular muggle desk lamp without a light bulb and had runes inside the lampshade. "Watch this." He tapped the lampshade and the light turned on, but it wasn't a normal light.
The healer in charge of Dumbledore drained some more venom and sighed, "I hate the man, but we heal. We have to do our best to do our job … getting his ass on the stand should be our main priority even if letting him suffer would, admittedly, be nice, but you didn't hear me say that!"
“my peers won’t see me again for a while. School came with too many strings attached and I had no one to trust … my teachers, my peers and least of all my guardians” said the young wizard sadly.
Aster placed her fists on her hips and glared her boss down “you had better have a foolproof plan to keep this sweet little boy away for that sick maniac, Brian Isaac White!” she yelled scaring the wizard.
The disguised wizard gulped in fear. Did Snape see? Would Snape recognize him? … no, it was unlikely … he looked nothing like the ‘Harry Potter’ Snape knew and it didn’t matter if his scars were seen as long as it wasn’t the distinctive scar hidden on his forehead.
Until they could figure it out they just floated around together and listened to the sweet child's voice grow older as time passed. They all knew he was trying to tell them things, but they couldn't quite comprehend the content. It probably had something to do with the container they were in because they heard voices clearly in other places before they came here. If it wasn't for the fact that they felt safe it would be a concern, but for now it wasn't and they waited and listened.
Fran hummed thoughtfully, "Papa doesn't like talking about it, but what was it like for our kinds before?"
It fit perfectly! According to the records and written comments from passed teachers he was a brilliant Slytherin student who seemed normal until one of the Ravenclaw students, Myrtle Warren, passed away.
The vampire chuckled startling the boy “you do what you have to in order to survive. Your relatives don’t sound like the pleasant sort” he said, he was considering draining both the professor and these relatives.
“Harry Potter” Lucius answered in disbelief, but that disbelief faded and he became serious “loyalty spells? Abuse? … who was your magical guardian? Charges should be filed immediately! This is outrageous! No child let alone an heir should’ve suffered like that!”
The Headmistress shook her head, "You aren't interrupting. Actually, your timing couldn't be better." Minerva shot Hermione a warning look to stop her when it looked like she was about to object to something. "Ms. Granger has informed me of something rather urgent. Could you pose as her school representative and take her to Gringotts?"
"I was helping." Draco huffed in annoyance. Apparently, his hormone riddled brain heard a more accusatory version of what Harry said.
“indeed” Severus reluctantly conceded to that point knowing not much could control the motherly vampire “may I ask how it is you were turned?” he asked not convinced that the vampire would pour out such a personal story, but he had to start somewhere.
“potions first little one” said the blue headmaster. He poured out the right amounts of each potion that was needed into one small cup and set it on the table for Harry. The child climbed up into the chair with his toy wolf bounding after him and the basilisk draped on his shoulders. It wasn’t tasty again but Harry gulped down his potion mixture and waited for Brian to set some food on the table for them. Brian quickly set out some food, which was at set of sandwich wraps with chicken, cheese and lettuce and started eating with Harry.
“oh … good, you worried me for a second there … if you’re going into potions too you should check out their testing room. I hear you can test new potions there or get a job selling potions” Tom suggested.
' as quickly as he turned it on Julian turned it off as he saw the very startled look on Tom's face.
For the start to healing Poppy gave him a few books to skim at home and had him watch what she did to heal other patients. With every question he asked she explained thoroughly. Each floor was visited and Poppy was happy he wasn’t squeamish.
“I-I left my cauldron going, we’ll talk later!” yelped the wizard as he actually ran out of the bank.
Dumbledore smiled a slightly strained smile when he spotted the apprentice who had his back to him while healing the Malfoy brat. He had to be careful about what he said “no problem really. I must say I’m surprised to see you here Poppy”
He came to a decision … right after breakfast he will talk to Professor Snape. Beg even, if he had to. Going back to the Dursleys really was a matter of life and death so he would gladly scrap any pride he had to get help. At this point he didn’t care if the man laughed at first.
“oh?” Dumbledore replied blandly though Julian suddenly felt concern from the old wizard, but it did seem like the concerned aura wasn’t actually focused on the professor “are you alright Professor Quirrell?” Dumbledore said as he stepped forward not realizing Julian could sense his eagerness and the flash of rage as he found that the dark presence of the dark lord, which was in the professor only moments ago, was gone “I’m glad you’re better” he said stiffly before the professor could even answer and turned to leave.
“Alohomora” he whispered ignoring the fact that he scared a house cat with his voice seemingly coming from nowhere. The padlock popped off and he recoiled at the smell. A sinking feeling hit him as he gently pulled the two furry creatures out of the prison. He gently set them down and was relieved to see them breathing. With a quick flick he snapped the padlock back on the cage door and locked it. Ms. Figg will not know right away that they’re gone …
“she wanted to talk to me” Julian answered cryptically just before he felt a thread of magic try to poke his mind “I understand I know a lot for my age professor and that you’re probably curious, but it’s still rude to read my mind” he said casually before mentally crushing the thread before it could even touch his mental shields.
The blonde chuckled “after lunch then. This will be interesting because she’s one species of reptile that understands parseltongue so the three of us can chat”
“you’re right. He’s more your type apparently” Blaise snickered at the shocked expression on Draco’s face “you aren’t as subtle as you like to think Draco”
“of course not, but the Malfoys and Blacks have been going to Hogwarts for generations plus Australia is so far away” Narcissa argued as she looked at the pamphlet in her husband’s hands.
Daggerfang used his long claws to unscrew the orb from the chain and placed the orb in the center of the third circle, “Now the ritual can commence.” The goblin said and walked over to a bowl of water.
Trocar chuckled “they all know enough. I didn’t tell them details, but they put many pieces together by themselves and Sanguini is helping. They know that you were abused and running away or hiding. Maria suspects you are using a different name and are hiding certain features in some way” the vampire shrugged at the shocked look on Cache’s face “you live with vampires and werewolves. We’re far more observant than the twits you knew at school. Everyone would find out sooner or later”
“what are they doing?” Draco asked as he watched his father, Julian’s father and the minister cut Dumbledore off before he could stop Severus.
“I’ve never seen kneazles like this” Tom noticed that the felines were skinny just like their human owner “would you like ladies like something to eat?”
Cache could have made a run for it and got help from the ministry … unless, someone in the ministry is involved with his mistreatment. It would explain why the boy wasn’t getting help … it’s possible, but he can’t be sure until he speaks with the boy.
Julian smiled sheepishly “in my defense I didn’t realize Hogwarts would be so eager to help me find Tom’s soul fragments. I just thought of the possibility of a horcrux being here and she transported me straight to it and Quirrell while avoiding Dumbledore. I didn’t intend to leave” he said thankful that castle did so, but he might be in trouble now.
“no once it was used to return the goblins to Gringotts it deactivated … what are you looking for?” Trocar asked getting a little annoyed with the professor’s lack of feed back as he examined the carving.
A moment later the carving turned into a wooden door and Trocar took Cache so they could move faster. It was clear that they found Salazar’s study when they walked right into a beautiful old office that had several bookshelves and a large track going upwards so that the basilisk could nest in the same room. Severus would’ve liked to search the place the Slytherin founder once occupied there was little time to do so. they found a set of stairs and went up them quickly as they watched for any changes in Cache’s condition. At the end of the steps was a door and to their surprise it opened up right into the Slytherin common room where Blaise was talking with Theo, Draco and Ginny …
“ummm … the ingredients may look the same as something else if it’s prepared differently s-so we have to use our other s-senses” Neville answered nervously and flinched as Hermione huffed. Cache gave Lyra a single pack cauldron cake, Neville’s favorite, and she took the delicate cake over to Neville earning a few coos for being cute. After giving Neville the cake she trotted back over to her sister who was curled up next to the front desk.
Harry twitched anxiously as his false blue eyes stared at his large box of freshly brewed potions. The source of his anxiousness had nothing to do with the potions, but everything to do with tomorrow. As much as he liked being there to mess with Dumbledore he couldn’t help but think of all the ‘what if’s …
Once Harry let go, he pulled the arrow out of his shoulder, not even flinching and frowned at the hole in his brand new uniform. Not that he cared much for it.
"Yes! I was wondering if you had any new information on what we can do to finally get Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy in Azkaban. Since you are the Head of Magical Law Enforcement, I needed to know if it was possible to get them found quicker."
"No, actually, I didn't. You see, it's funny really. You might've heard of it, the Veil? Yeah, we jumped through that, but looky here! I'm still here. And you're still in jail!"
The day at dinner, there was an abundant amount of strawberries in the meal. Strawberry smoothies, strawberry pie, strawberry sorbet, and just plain strawberries. Merlin glared at Harry for that, while Harry just smiled. This time at dinner, it was only the Arthurians, the Potters and the Avengers who lived in the Compound (meaning, no space friends, no Peter, no Stephen, no Clint, no Tony or Pepper, no Wakandans, no Scott or Hope).
When he stood in front of his cell, he was both saddened and disgusted. Here was the father of his husband in all his glory. A prisoner because of his ideals.
Pietro started to cry, "I love you, too, Teddy. So don't you dare leave me now. I swear to god, you cannot die on me now. C'mon. Promise me, you won't die on me. Edward Remus Lupin, if you die now, I will kill you."
Two months after the unexpected visit by Nick Fury, Harry started working at SHIELD. Harry's first day was pretty uneventful (in his eyes, in other people's eyes they would think he had enough adventure for a lifetime). He had his picture taken for his ID. Had to fill out tons of papers about himself, his family and more. He even had to write letters to anyone important to him in case he died. If only they knew he couldn't. Clint Barton, another SHIELD agent, was put in charge of him to make sure he knew all the protocols and information he needed. The protocols were pretty similar to those from his Auror days.
"I'm fine. Just a small scratch. There's a note in my bedside table. Give it to Severus after you read it if I don't make it."
Teddy stood up from his spot on the couch next to Pietro and Clint. "That would be me, Professor—er, Headmaster?"
When Snape left the room, he found Draco in the living room playing a card game with Teddy. "Draco. It's good seeing you again. But I have to be going now."
Two weeks later, Draco and Harry were standing in front of the Avengers (now including Peter, Scott, T'Challa and Bucky, all who had already been told about magic and their pasts) and Pepper, who wasn't an official Avenger, she was more like the mother keeping them all in check.
"Fake your death, they said. You won't get caught, they said." The man mumbled. Draco vaguely recognized the voice but couldn't be sure until he saw the man.
When the team split up, Steve, Wanda, Pietro, Harry, Teddy and Sirius were in charge of making sure everyone was evacuated. Thor, Clint, Natasha, Bruce and Draco were fighting against the bots that were making their way to the city. Tony was trying to reason with Ultron, although he was failing at it. Ultron revealed that he had a machine set up that would first lift the city from the ground, bring it up high enough, then drop it, causing global extinction. Vision, who was made of what was left of JARVIS, went to fight against Ultron after Tony went to help defenses.
"When we make it out of here, I'm gonna marry you, okay? I'm gonna get you a ring and we're gonna get married. You'll have Draco, Harry, Sirius, Severus and Scorpius there."
Teddy and Draco looked around. Sirius and Severus were looking directly at each other. When Harry looked up, he now saw two dragons, a wolf and two dogs.
Sirius took it upon himself to walk up to the man. He pointed his wand at him while nudging him with his foot.
Harry used this opportunity to get Barton down, which he succeeded at, resulting in him finally surrendering under Harry's hold.
After that, he used a simple healing spell and watched as the wound closed up. He didn't use dittany so it would scar, but looking at Merlin's exposed chest, that wasn't anything new. He used a wet towel to gently dab away the blood then used bandages to cover it up.
Comment who you think Harry's gonna find on the other side of the Veil (hint: this person had been mentioned in the story before).
"Why was Draco an asshole? Why did it matter if you were a Pureblood, half-blood or Muggleborn? What is Quidditch?"
When Hermione made her way back to her office after stopping by to say hello to Neville, she got to work on the runes.
The man rolled up his sleeves partially. Harry thought for a second he saw the head of snake that looked suspiciously like the Dark Mark but then disappeared.
"Who?" That wasn't in any of the books, obviously. And Harry hadn't written it in any of his journal entries as far as she could tell.
Natasha snapped out of her analysis of her friend and spoke, "Yes, um, Loki showed up and said he wanted to talk to you and Severus."
When Nick Fury tested the blood, it led to a Harry James Potter, born July 31, 1980. How did his blood show up ten years earlier at the site of a SHIELD operation? Fury put two of his best agents on the case. Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton.
"Well... The Stones are the living but they were used as a form of death. So can't the Hallows do the same thing as a form of the living?"
That idea left her mind quickly. The child grew up with Draco Malfoy as a father, there was no doubt he would be in Slytherin, as all Malfoys were in Slytherin.
"I thought we already explained this. he's a Metamorphous. He can change his form at will." Harry said.
Harry smiled before the stones flew into the circlet, three going on each side of the black diamond. Harry shuddered.
"I warn you... you will want to talk to me after the ending. It is something not most believe. It is rather abrupt, but that is how it happened."
Draco took Scorpius in his arms before turning back to Bruce, "He's our son. Scorpius Leandro Potter. And the one that was holding him is my godfather, Severus Snape. He's about a year and a half old."
"I know how to do this, Jay. Just get over here," Draco whispered as he made his way to the two men. Tiswer Syiltal and Keodor Hewion. Both worked in the Magical Law Enforcement section of the Ministry.
Harry, who was now also being followed by Tony and Steve, made his way to the living room. Sirius wet the towel in the kitchen then followed Harry to the living room. Harry used the wet towel to very gently clean his son from the blood he had on him. After that, he put the diaper on him then wrapped him in the clean blanket.
"Yes, of course I am, Scorpius. You know I'd never leave you." Harry pulled one of the chains he carried around his neck off. It was the one with his engagement and wedding rings. "Here. My wedding rings. You can hold onto these whole I'm gone just so you know I'm always going to be here for you. And when I come back, you can give them back, because after that I'm never going to leave you again. Okay?"
"Alright. I was born on July 31, 1980 to James Potter and Lily Evans. The following Halloween, Peter Pettigrew told the Dark Lord Voldemort where we were living. Pettigrew was their secret keeper, meaning only he knew where we were. So basically, Voldy wanted to kill me because of a prophecy that said a boy born at the end of July wold be the one to kill him. He obviously didn't wanna take his chances so he came to out house on Halloween and killed my parents. When he shot the Killing Curse at me, it somehow rebounded and hit him instead, killing him and leaving me with the lightning scar, but he wasn't actually dead, not that we knew that until like 10 years later. Sirius Black, one of my parents best friends was assumed to have been the one that outed my parents and killed 13 muggles, non-magic folk and Peter. Which wasn't true by the way, but we'll get into that later," Harry took a breath before continuing again.
Draco smiled and leaned into Harry, wrapping his arms around his waist. Harry pulled Draco closer and held him close, watching the magical dragons play around next to them.
"We're going to need to spend sometime rewording what the Cailleach said. She was very... Shakespeare."
The party was to take place on July 31st, on Harry's birthday. Only the Avengers and the Potters were invited (seeing as they know no one else) but Nick Fury, Phil Coulson (who hadn't died due to Loki shooting him in 2012) and Maria Hill also ended up showing up.
"Yeah, I know. Technically I'm like your first cousin once removed, but that's too complicated. Plus, I'm only biologically related to you!" Sirius laughed, Draco eventually joined in.
"Speak for yourself, Mr Let's Jump Worlds." He said but held on to him. "Fuck, you have no clue how good it is to see you. It's been 45 years, you idiot." George pulled away so he could look at Harry, "How are you? How's Malfoy?"
"It's a bit gunky. Skulls, guts, what you'd except in a secret snake hideout." Harry explained before jumping down the slide.
"Let me get this straight. You survived a snake bite because you had an antidote in your pocket, then went on a run for a week then your magical police found you and threw you into the Veil because of your crimes as a Death Eater?" Steve asked.
He looked up at everyone else who was watching him. "Anything else?" When no one answered, he put the quill down.
When he finally came back up, Harry was waiting for him. He was on his phone just playing a game when he looked up and saw Snape. "Hey. You found anything interesting?"
"Hey, Buck. This nice," Steve started, ignoring Severus rolling his eyes, "man is gonna fix your mind."
When Harry found out that George had written back, he freaked out. He almost started crying (it took Draco ten minutes to calm him down).
know, seeing as Severus and Sirius were too busy confessing their love for each other other than helping!"
"Yes, the one that stabbed me." Merlin sighed, "Draco believes in the good in people. Mordred was a misguided teenager, much like he was. He didn't want someone else to get hurt by their own actions because they didn't know all of their choices."
Steve came out of the ship holding Tony. Pepper (who had joined them when she heard what happened) ran up and hugged Tony. She was full on sobbing.
"This way." Harry led him down the hallway towards the back of the house and opened a door which had some stairs leading downstairs.
When the Avengers met the Maximoff twins, Teddy's first response was to help them. He yelled to the other Avengers to let him help them but they wouldn't listen. To them, he was still technically a boy who was 17 years younger than Harry and Draco.
Loki laughed. "I'm Loki. Prince of Asgard, Odinson, the rightful King of Jotunheim, God of Mischief. I have many titles." He stuck his hand out.
When he got out and through the other side, he was saddened at the sight. The Department of Mysteries. Not a happy place. But, bringing some light to the place was George.
Everyone was shocked. Ron and Neville immediately tried to heal the cuts, yet none of the spells worked. Hannah, who had finished healing Draco had run over and cast the right spells along with McGonagall and Pomfrey who rushed over.
Harry laughed once more before he fell to the ground, the adrenaline dying out. His eyes faded back into their normal green.
Tony laughed before patching himself through to the Compound, "Attention ladies and gentlemen, Severus Snape and Sirius Black have finally kissed. I repeat, they finally kissed. This is not a drill."
Both Merlin and Harry's eyes widened when the dragon said that. "I'm not a Dragonlord." Harry said, shocked. "I'm pretty sure I would realize if I was a Dragonlord."
"Also, before you go do other things, can Sirius, Teddy, Severus, Tony and Steve come up here?" Harry asked while Draco was just beaming.
"I have no clue what you're talking about. I was born on July 31st, 1980. Now if you'll excuse me, I have more work to do," Potter said, standing up before Fury stopped him again.
Stark turned to Fury then walked up to the panel next to the cell and entered some codes, causing the cell to open and the cuffs to fall off.
The same thing happened with him. The 'how are you?', 'how's Draco?', 'how's Sirius?', 'are you happy?'.
"Normal stuff. I was catching up on some readings for an upcoming mission when someone came to see me. His name was Nick Fury. He works for... what was it... Strategic Homemade Internet Enforcement and Logic Department? No... that wasn't it. Whatever. It was called SHIELD. He said he wants me to work for him as an agent. He also said he works with the Avengers."
Charlie, being the only one able to act, grabbed the journal from the trunk, said the magic words and flipped to the end of the journal, to the last written entry and read out loud.
They both watched as the dragons flew around each other. Their tails intertwined and they flew around the forest.
The four of them exited the Chamber. Neville split ways with the other three, going to the Great Hall while the others went to the floo in Neville's office.
Harry hugged Draco. "Oh, my love. Je t'aime tellement. Notre bébé ira parfaitement bien. Nous avons l'équipe maintenant. Nous avons Snape, Sirius et Teddy. Notre bébé sera l'enfant le plus aimé de tous les temps."*
"Georgie, if I have any say in anything in my world, which I do, we're going to see each other lots more times. Okay?"
"I know all that. But no one ever tells me about what he was like as a kid. Or what he did in his free time."
The nursery in the Potter house had been worked on by Severus, Sirius, Teddy and Steve. The walls were a green-gray color except for one wall. Teddy and Steve had worked for hours on the other wall. It was basically a painting of Hogwarts, as Teddy remembered it. He had sketched it out, seeing as Steve didn't know what the school looked like, and told Steve what to paint what color to help him out. When Harry last checked it, the only thing left to paint was the Quidditch field and the Forbidden Forest.
A small future hint: The (very) possible sequel for this story will include Merlin and Arthur (and maybe the Knights, haven't decided yet). The end is just the beginning, is it not?
The man looked up with wide eyes and abruptly stood up from this chair, grabbing his wand and pointing at the intruders.
Okay, now she was confused. How the hell did they manage to all land in the same world? And what the hell was an Avenger?
Draco smiled and sat next to Harry. When they pulled away from the hug, Scorpius took the chain off his neck and gave it back to his dad. "You came back."
Tony and Pepper moved into their own little home with their daughter Morgan Stark. Rhodey, Steve and Natasha still lived in the Compound. Natasha was basically running the Avengers now since no one else wanted to. She was doing an excellent job at it too.
"So at Hogwarts there were four houses, each made by one of the founders. Each house values different things. Gryffindor, created by Godric Gryffindor, values bravery and courage. Slytherins, created by Salazar Slytherin, tend to be ambitious and cunning. Hufflepuff, by Helga Hufflepuff, values loyalty and patience. Ravenclaws, created by Rowena Ravenclaw, are witty, intelligent and creative. Gryffindor's colors are red and gold and our animal is a lion. Slytherin is green and silver and their animal is a snake. Hufflepuffs are yellow and black and their animal is a badger. And Ravenclaw is blue and bronze and their animal is an eagle. I, along with all the Weasleys, Hermione, Neville and the Marauders were Gryffindors. Draco was a Slytherin like every other Malfoy and Black, excluding Sirius and Tonks. Teddy and his mother were Hufflepuffs. Luna, Cho Chang, who I briefly dated in fifth year, were Ravenclaws."
Minutes later, everything calmed down. The parchment had now been signed by Draco and Harry. It had been magic who signed for them. They were a worthy couple and the magic clearly saw that so it had accepted them.
Steve slowly made his way to Harry, smiling widely. "I thought it was only going to be Teddy, Severus and Sirius?"
"So, now he has everything about everyone and everything. You do realize the power that he has now? He has nuclear codes, personal flies, our files! He knows we're not from here!" Sirius said loudly.
"Wait... you inherited Tonks' Metamorphous genes. Did you also get Remus'... illness, as he called it?"
Sirius turned to Harry, "What the hell happened? Why's Moony dead? He was supposed to survive! He was supposed to protect you after I was gone! That was the Marauders rule. Whoever's left takes care of Prongslet, that's you by the way. First it was passed onto Remus after James died. Then me as your godfather. Then back to Moony. Wait, how's the Wizarding World even right now?"
"Grow up Sam. You've been living with us for how many years now?" Harry flashed him a middle finger.
Once Romanoff finished, Agent Barton started talking, "He has scars all over his body. They're old scars that have healed over, meaning they don't come from field work. Possible child abuse, but no one is crazy enough to leave those kind of scars on a child. Distinctive features include a lightning bolt scar on his forehead, and a couple tattoos all over his body."
FRIDAY announced his return to everyone at the Compound. Natasha and Steve were the first to show up, then Thor, then Severus, Pietro and Scorpius.
"I'm making a speech once this thing starts. I was really confused as to why at first, but I figured it out later. She wants people to realize that not all ex-Death Eaters are bad, or something," Draco shrugged, seeming to be rather calm as an ex-Death Eater, though he still wore long-sleeves to basically everywhere he went to cover the Dark Mark. "Are you making a speech? I'm assuming you are, considering you're the one to thank for us being alive."
After Loki inconspicuously killed the chitauri at the door, they entered. The team split up, Natasha, Nebula, Valkyrie, Okoye and Carol Danvers (who made her appearance on Earth a couple months after the Snap. It was a bit surprising to see a floating blonde outside the Compound, but they got over it eventually) went one way. Thor, Rocket, Steve, Rhodey and Bruce went another way, while Harry, Loki, Severus, Tony and Pietro made their way to what they thought was the throne room (which is where they assumed is where Thanos would be).
The more Teddy looked, the more he noticed. They were all worn out, leaning on each other. He could also tell from the man carrying the unconscious man, that the unconscious one was bleeding profusely.
Harry getting back on his feet was a lot easier than he expected. He had the support of his family, of course, which made everything so much bearable.
In the room with Draco was another blonde. His hair did seem bleached, as his roots were a dark brown color. He also had gray eyes. If one didn't know them, they could pass as siblings.
"Yes...? Okay, listen, he kind of did die afterwards, but that's besides the point. It was right before the Snap, I don't know if you read about that, but it wiped out half our universe, Teddy, Draco and Sirius included."
It was like a palace. Surrounding the doors were Chitauri. Around the palace, in place of a moat of water, was a moat of some sort of lava. The whole place screamed death to Harry.
Scorpius laughed. He stayed in his dad's lap and held onto him as if he would go away again. "Daddy. Please don't go again."
When Draco and Harry got there, Draco almost cried because of how beautiful everything was. Harry just held him in his arms and kissed his cheek.
"Stay outside. I need to check on him first. I'll let you know when you can enter." Draco said right before entering then closing the door on them.
"Are you kidding? Vocatis? Seriously? You might not have been the one who was disowned and thrown into jail but have you no respect for Cervisia? Best wine company ever. James introduced it to us. Their Sermo? Best thing ever."
That's another thing. Every time he wielded the Elder Wand, whispers were constantly telling him to do bad things. In this case, he actually listened to them. There's a reason it's also called the Deathstick.
"He's the one who suggested it. Now, come on. Let me show you your room. After all, us Potters love picking up strays. Just like we picked up Teddy, then Sirius and now you."
"Okay, take us out of our misery and just tell us what he got you!" Sirius practically yelled, wanting to know why his godson went to the Chamber of Secrets.
Draco then came in. Then Rhodey, Wanda and Vision and followed them. Everyone was all geared up in armor, metal suits, or just dragonhide and a wand. Draco stopped short when he saw Bruce.
"But he murdered Voldemort, the man he was trained to kill. That makes zero sense. And the Cedric Diggory part? It wasn't him. It was Voldemort. At this point I just believe they should be let go."
Draco looked outside and was amazed by the shield that was blocking the debris that fell from the sky and some ships outside the shield. "It looks like magic."
The Avengers (Teddy, Draco and Sirius included) were just lounging in one of the many floors in Avengers Tower after a party when it all went downhill.
"Sirius, stop blaming yourself for this. It won't do you any good. You weren't here. You don't know what he went through. After you disappeared, he was so mentally out of it that he didn't even respond. He was just going through the motions. The only things to get him to move were trying to get you back and Scorpius."
"Parker, help! Get over here." Peter swung his way over and worked with Tony to get the gauntlet off. "She can't hold him much longer. Let's go."
The portrait had an intricate gold frame with what was believed to be the castle of Camelot as the background. Merlin himself was an old man in red robes. His face had wrinkles and a long white beard.
"Well, you know that work trip I went on? I figured out how to bring your Papa back. But to do that, I might have to go away. It would only be a short time, but I wanted to tell you."
"What?" The one on the other side of the blonde said. This one had shoulder length brown hair and a beard. If Sirius was being completely honest, he could've been looking in a mirror. "How?" It was also evident that he was leaning against a giant blonde man, meaning he was either hurt or just plain tired.
Severus, who had leaned into the kiss and placed his hands on Sirius' waist, hesitantly pulled away and looked around. Draco, Harry and Teddy all had similar smirks on their faces.
Him and Ginny Weasley broke up a year after the war. She had told him, "I think we should both move on, Harry. But I'll always love you." They were still good friends, as good as they can be after dating for a year and a half. It hurt Harry to see her with another man but he knew she was happier now without him. She was currently the Chaser for the Holyhead Harpies, and a bloody good one.
"His parents died on Halloween, he was left with his relatives that didn't like him on Halloween, a troll could've almost killed him on Halloween. Ginerva Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets on Halloween. Sirius entered the school and everyone thought he was out to kill Harry on Halloween. Harry was illegally chosen for the Triwizard Tournament on Halloween. She could've been born on Halloween."
Steve finally spoke up again, "Harry, Draco, Teddy, Severus and Sirius, call us if you need help. If we can do something to help, let us know."
Hermione nodded, took the quill and sighed. Griphook grabbed the parchment again and signed his own name next to hers.
She was shocked. They had barely passed through the Veil hours ago and it had already been 50 years for him. That meant he was 105 years old.
"They have this tattoo, it's a snake and a skull, on their forearm. It's called the Dark Mark. Hold on. Draco. Come here." Sirius watched as Draco excused himself from his conversation with Pepper Potts and walked over.
Draco made his way down to the Magical Law Enforcement department. Apparently, Tiswer Syiltal was an Auror. The partner to the Weasley boy. It was just perfect.
She turned to the window, looking Northeast to where London would be over seas, "What are you?" She asked to no one in particular, just to herself.
"Yes, as in magic. Director Fury, you asked how we were able to show up ten years before Draco and I were born. That's because in 1970, my world was in the year 2053, I believe. It was hard to keep track in the woods."
"Yes," Harry nodded, going back to washing his shirt, "We use Polyjuice to change ourselves into Ministry workers. Then we wreck havoc."
Merlin had been a sickly child who was bullied because he was different. He had one friend, his name was Will, who Hermione would later learn had died while protecting Merlin and his magic.
Harry smiled a bit before willing the invisibility cloak to come out of the circlet-bracelet. Once he had it, he wrapped it around his shoulders, "Let's go."
Snape just hummed and kept looking around. He stopped by a bookshelf that was filled with books in Parseltongue.
"He's my cousin. I will protect him with my dying breath. And my name is not Malfoy! It's Draco Lucius Potter! Get it right!" Draco yelled, sending a curse at Hermione, that was deflected by the mini-Weasley.
"We don't know how to wake Harry up. We've tried our medical supplies and spells provided by Draco and Severus." Natasha said.
But none of it mattered. They couldn't go into a new world and arrest people for things they didn't do in that world. They didn't even know where they were, for Merlin's sake!
"Don't know. It's all you have in the kitchen." Draco shrugged, grabbing one of the to-go menus they had stored in a drawer.
They heard muttering from the room, though since there was only one signature, it was obvious the man was talking to himself. The door was left slightly ajar, letting the trio hear what the man was saying.
"You're doing that thing where you push your glasses up your nose, except you don't have glasses anymore. You do it when you're nervous. James used to do it too. So, I repeat, what did you do?"
"Oh! It's a communicator. My wife is making me wear it. Y'know, making sure I don't die on the job." Draco replied, cringing on the inside at the word
Over the 44 years they were in hiding, they both changed a lot. They were both stronger physically, mentally and magically. Harry still had more of a muscular build but Draco was just as strong. Harry's hair was still short, crazy and untamable while Draco grew his out and mostly had it up in a ponytail or bun. At first, Draco was gonna cut his hair but Harry loved his long hair so he didn't cut it. Both had more scars than they cared to admit. They still moved location every week or so and never stayed in the same place twice.
"One magical signature showed. It was a man, but we don't know anything else besides he had a wand with him. Apparently the Death Eaters knew this and have the man as a hostage. Scans show 17 heat signatures and 17 magical signatures, meaning the man is a wizard."
"So you have your patronus and your wedding date tattooed?" Rogers asked, slowly speaking out the word patronus.
Charlie flipped to the next page. It was dated two days after the last one, but this one had different handwriting.
“alright! Just guess the color you think it will land on and spin. If you’re right you can choose any of these fabulous items if front of you!” the man smiled as he pointed out the wide selection of things the new store probably sold.
The fake blonde looked at his St. Mungo’s ring and chuckled softly “perhaps … but there’s a chance that if he saw this ring on my finger he would accuse me of cheating in some way” Cache shrugged and sipped his tea ignoring the concerned looks the two supernatural adults were giving him “so Frank will you be staying long?”
After tucking his trunk away in the cupboard and picked up the potion book he was using, but found nothing. Flipping through the pages revealed something else though … a reference to a book that has all the potions for reversing all the damage done by malnutrition!
Draco's flushed cheeks darkened even more, "D-Don't say things ahhhh like that! Ahhhh!" He thrashed and writhed as he felt that finger stroke his inner walls. His back arched off the bed completely when Harry sucked his cock and thrust a second finger into the tight channel. "Harry! Fuck! I-I I'm ahh! Harry!" Draco screamed and spilled his cum into Harry's mouth, but the now three fingers in him kept moving and soon made him hard again.
Early that morning Harry woke up and went to make sure his disguise was holding up. Since it was he slipped out from under Lyra and went to take a shower nearly tripping over Libra who was sleeping stretched out on the rug. After digging his suitcase out of his bottomless bag and changing his clothes he went to make breakfast.
The headmaster was lead down a street lined on each side by muggle homes and made a beeline for the fourth house on Privet Drive. Startled momentarily by the presence of wards around the house he paused and slowed his approach. When the wards didn’t stop him he crept up to the window still in the form of a wolf.
The store was filled with people, but it was still easy to see the amazing assortment of colorful candies and sweets lining the shelves. They both got the special, which was a triple chocolate cauldron cake filled with Honeydukes’ never melting ice cream. To Cache’s surprise there were kneazle treats in the store across the street, but then he recognized the name as the store he owl orders his groceries from. He never saw it in person. Trocar told him the name and he started ordering. When he refocused on Draco who was ordering something else that needed both owners to run around busily, but with an eager and happy enthusiasm … what did Draco order?
Just after the professor left a tray with a vial floated into the room and Griphook handed Harry the potion after making sure it was the right one “you need to take this before the ritual. It will prevent damage to your soul as we remove it, but it takes 30 minutes for full effect so we will wait here until the ritual room is ready. A word of warning, the ritual is a safe procedure, but it is painful and you will feel groggy after”
“ok … now do I want to make someone’s hands red and itchy when they try to steal my stuff or to zap? … and what should I do to hide them with me?” ideally Harry wanted to somehow carry his things with him, but to truly hide them meaning ore than a simple shrinking spell and leaving them in his bag, which was his original plan … now how to do that?
For years he tried saving young creatures and to his horror saw less and less each year. The thought of having kids was as terrifying as it was desired. After all, he couldn't imagine bringing life into this world only for it to be cruelly hunted down, but Frank came close to changing his mind. Trocar knew the young werewolf he saved as a cub only left him because the vampire was being torn up by the fears he had and he was relieved. If Frank stayed he would've been too tempted to resist.
The wizard took a sip of his tea and shook his head “no, he’s been exhausted since the bindings on his magic were removed. Aster just says to let him take naps when he gets tired”
"Indeed, we should study this." Severus grumbled, "This could be a huge advancement for creatures. The potential benefits for vampires are astronomical. It's worth the attention of the both of us. Preferably sooner rather than later."
“Errr … Weasley.” Arthur said and the goblin left to make the report leaving behind a stunned Weasley. “On going? Another?” He suddenly felt like he was missing a lot more than his daughter’s abuse.
“I love it, despite my potions professor’s best efforts. He seems to think I’m an idiot-” Harry bit he inside of his cheek to keep himself from saying any more … he has been saying too much lately. The boy paid for his purchases and headed out the door. Severus frowned at the comment. No one who knows what dragon blood does is an idiot. Most of his seventh years don’t know that! He quickly paid for his purchases and went out the door to find the boy …
“could I have a moment alone with Severus, Minerva?” Dumbledore asked as he entered the Great Hall, which was empty save for the three of them.
The potion master noticed the numbing spell and recalled the research he did. This spell was built off the nerve attacking power of the torture curse and it was effective. Severus sat in the chairs provided and watched as the goblins started the ritual. He didn’t show it, but he was just as nervous as Brian and Aster. Though Julian didn’t feel anything he was twitching as if he was.
Aster came back into her guest room with a cup of tea and checked on her adorable patient “I do believe you have recovered to the point where we don’t need the blood potions, but you still need nutrition potions” she said happily as she added a spoonful of that potion into the fresh fluid filled bag. Since the most painful part of his recovery was done there was no need to keep him asleep so she blew out the candle. With a snap of her fingers the windows opened cleansing the room with fresh air.
Cache leaned over and whispered “be honest, do I look that bad?” he said quietly as the entire hall erupted with whispers and chatter … Severus snorted in amusement, but didn’t respond …
“there isn’t a way to get out of this. Ginny’s lip was bleeding and she had bruises around her neck” Cache said calmly.
None of the neighbors would have guessed that the delinquent nephew of the Dursleys was walking right passed them as they were enjoying the sunny weather. Even though some swore they heard the rolling sound of someone’s suitcase wheels, but no one had such a thing out at the time … maybe the streets were haunted! A thought that made a few people slink back into their homes …
Draco curled up, but felt a weight next to him and saw the toy wolf laying next to him “maybe he’s not that bad” Draco muttered with a light blush as he hugged the soft toy close to him and drifted off to sleep …
Hermione scowled as she walked into the potion class and saw Cache standing in the front with the professor “this jerk is starting to bug me” she grumbled quietly as she sat down next to Ron.
“he is in bad shape, but yes … care to explain why you brought him here and not Pearl hospital?” she asked seriously.
“that’s wonderful! Would you like anything to celebrate?” Narcissa asked happily as she hugged her son.
Cache leaned back against the chest of the dark creature “I tried to tell my headmaster about my … home life, but he shot me down and said I had to return, that my aunt provided blood protection” Harry felt the vampire stiffen do to the bitterness in his voice “but I knew if I just returned after learning some magic I would be killed so I went to the only other professor I trusted, my potions professor, who hated me for some reason related to my father, but he did save me so I hoped he’d listen”
Poppy spotted him as he went towards the lab with a box “Cache, so good to see you! I was just setting things up so everything is ready for me to go back to Hogwarts tomorrow. What are you doing? You’re not worried right?” she asked protectively.
“Lucius/Dad!” Narcissa and Draco went over to him, but he paid them no mind as he got up to quickly write a letter …
"Very good. That is the passkey in question and you can pick it up later at Gringotts. Moody, I'm sure, apologizes for using it to cork his flask. He didn't want to lose it." Slashclaw remarked not really interested in the subject. "Now, Ms. Granger, let's begin with you. What connects you to this wizard? Nothing you say will leave this room unless you reveal it."
“indeed … especially since the Cyclic cure is fatal to anyone who doesn’t need it” Severus remarked with an amused smirk at the subtle quiz. Normally he’d take offense, but the twins were very clever at hiding it and never sounded condescending … no wonder they make great teachers. Severus reached for the potions only for the potions to be moved out of reach … these women would make great Slytherins as well “in exchange for what?”
Harry twitched while looking at the snoring gray head. He didn’t want to waste time on this “alright” he sighed, grabbed the edge of the mattress Ron was sleeping on and showed some strength by lifting it. Ron rolled off the bed with a loud thump.
The headmaster looked up to see where Julian was looking at and was surprised to see a 30 foot long creature with a serpent like body with no legs, a bird like head with a sharp beak, strong bird like wings and covered in dark blue feather like scales “an Occamy and an unusually large one … that’s odd. These guys are supposed to be on the other side of the reservation”
"What?" Mrs. Crippens didn't even grab her jacket before walking out into the snowy weather. The owl let her take the letter and flew away before she even opened it. "Well I'll be. Damn clever rug rat!" She cackled after reading the letter, but looked off in the direction the owl went. "Trained birds like that must be rare … perhaps easily traceable … you all found this stuck in the door, got it? There was no owl."
"Gringotts?! Is something wrong with my account?" Ron blurted out and stood up so fast that the rat in his pocket nearly flew out.
The goblin cleared his throat trying to ignore the sudden awkward feeling, "Right. The fact that he gave you money is a good sign he had no intention of potioning you. After all, why pay someone you potioned? He may have been setting you up to be framed. An easy thing to do when you find someone whose starstruck, which seems to fit you better than potioning. In which case, it would've benefited him to let your clearly willing behavior show for any investigation." Gritmace pulled out a document and quill. "Sign over Harry Potter's money and this will get easier. I recommend speaking to this man about testifying."
The blonde Potter scanned the displays as he wondered why no one let him get a holster before. Dragon hide sounded good, but it was expensive compared to the other. Two holsters would take nearly all of his budget. On the other hand the bank will resupply him in a week and dragon hide lasts a long time. In the end he took a calf holster and a shoulder holster.
Tom bit his lip as he thought back, "ummm … I remember playing with Persephone … she was a basilisk in Hogwarts … then I was going to leave. Persephone was mad about something and her eyes were open I think, but it's all fuzzy … there was a girl … a lemon smell …" Tom suddenly clutched his head in pain.
“so … you’ll be staying at school with them then” the headmaster was cackling maniacally on the inside. He layered several loyalty spells in all the Head of Houses’ quarters, Poppy’s room and the potion lab Snape uses. No matter where the boy stays he will eventually be under the headmaster’s thumb and Dumbledore was drooling at the thought of having this talented boy as an ally instead of a nuisance.
“hold it! You’re going to check on Cache aren’t you?!!” Blaise asked curiously. Everyone knew by now that Cache flooed into Severus’s living quarters. It wasn’t hard to figure out and if the Malfoy’s sudden increase in pace was anything to go by then Blaise was right “I knew it! You want to make sure he’s ok … you’re going to try asking Cache something”
A stunning realization hit him as he added up the prices in his head … he invented a potion using ingredients that all together make 12 galleons! That made him happy for some reason … maybe because it was his lifesaver.
“Cache is Uncle Sev’s apprentice” Draco said still trying to glare a hole through Severus who remained completely unaffected by the little Malfoy’s menacing gaze.
Harry frowned, “I didn’t intend to. I just tried brewing something simple with regular kneazle whiskers and some mistletoe to heal my eyesight … Trocar took it so I wouldn’t test it. The blushing and protection from the sun I-”
"Ms. Prewett? I'm not-" Her eyes widened when she saw Arthur smile instead of coming to her defense.
Trocar lowered his hood letting his red eyes show, "So you decided to run around in your animagus form because of something related to that?"
Brian blinked and then laughed “you mean the floo and no, we will take the floo to get to the bank tomorrow, but today we just take the elevators down to the forest floor”
“Yes it’s me, Sirius. I brought you something to eat.” Remus said with a kind smile as he set the platter on the bedside table to help Sirius sit up. He chuckled as Sirius cringed at the bland looking meal, “I know it’s not the most appealing, but it’s your healer’s orders. I put some cinnamon in so it Isn’t as bad as it looks. Here try.” He said as he scooped up a spoonful of the oatmeal like mush and held it up to Sirius’ lips.
Greyback snorted “you, whether intentional or not, were the cause of Voldemort’s downfall and that madman was the enemy of every creature. Creatures like us take life debts very seriously unlike your wizard groupies who prefer to worship rather than take your care seriously”
Satisfied that the dark Knockturn Ally wasn’t so bad, minus the ‘vampires drink for free’ sign in the window of one pub … he will have to be careful, but still it wasn’t all bad he thought as he returned to the entrance of the Leaky Cauldron, but when he walked into the ally behind the pub and peered in the saw Snape sitting at the counter. He ducked back into the ally as the professor turned his gaze to the door.
That tracking charm will be off him if the tests he had in mind went right. Of course if someone put a tracker on him why not his stuff too? The realization nearly made him choke on his milk. He put his glass down, cleared his airways of the milk he inhaled and took his trunk out of the cupboard. After grabbing his wand he checked for a charm. Right in the center of the trunk directly under the handle was a gray glowing tracking charm.
“get me some food freak!” demanded Dudley. Harry got down from the ladder quickly and started cooking.
"I see no shredded clothes. It seems we were right. Vampires and werewolves are caused by a variant of the same virus." Harry said showing little concern about the werewolf that shouldn't even be around in the middle of the day.
” Harry frowned as he remembered the pub he saw in Diagon alley. Did that business move? The book titled ‘Moonlight Brews’ caught his eye and he took it.
“how-” Albus started to interrogate the professor, but was quickly interrupted by hordes of students who were excited for their last breakfast here before going home for the summer. The headmaster lost all his friendly twinkle for a second as he was clearly furious that Severus refused him, but he had no choice but to go to his seat. It was even more infuriating when he remembered it was the last day of the school year and he technically couldn’t speak with Severus again until after the summer. He decided to simply threaten to fire Severus if he didn’t cooperate right before leaving and let the young wizard think about his actions.
They all went their separate ways, getting back to their normal lives, once they landed. The first thing (after seeing Harry placed in the medical wing) that Draco wanted to do was see his son.
"Harry Potter. You may also know me as the Master of Death." Harry whispered but everyone heard it as it was quiet on the field.
"Yes it is." Draco went over to Harry's room, entered, picked his son up then came back out. "Scorpius, these are some of Daddy's friends."
Around ten minutes later, Severus opened the door and walked out. Harry stood up with his sleeping baby and everyone else looked up. Draco was wheeled out of the room in a wheelchair (and based on Draco's face, he didn't want to use the wheelchair) that was being pushed by Teddy. Harry walked over to him and kneeled next to him. He handed Draco the baby and watched as he held him.
"You git," Draco slapped Harry's hand away but there was nothing but love in his eyes, "I don't know we've survived 20 years without tearing each others throats out."
"This is actual bullshit, people do realize that, right?" Draco scoffed as he threw an old copy Daily Prophet down onto the floor of the forest they were currently camping out in.
"Hey, Scorp. I know we haven't been spending much time together since, y'know the Snap. But I wanna take you out today. We can go watch a movie or to a carnival or to the park. Whatever you want, bud."
"Okay, so we have an announcement." Harry said then he turned to Draco, "Do you wanna say it or should I?"
"Yes, bu– Harry, love, you're brewing that potion all wrong," Draco smiled to himself and sat down next to Harry, "You have to crush the bean by cracking it over the cauldron, not on the table. Like this, watch," Draco took the bean and crushed it over the cauldron, breaking almost instantly because of the fumes being released.
He heard footsteps. No. He sensed it. He sensed someone coming his way. It was odd. The person wasn't within a reasonable distance to have heard footsteps. But his magic was telling him.
The memories were projected onto the wall of the guest room. He showed the one of him getting shoved into his cupboard the day he spoke to that snake at the zoo when he was 11. The one where he had bars placed on his window when he was 12. The one where he had just been pushed down the stairs by Dudley and his friends when he was eight. One where he had to hold his arm close to his chest because Vernon had broken it out of rage and refused to take him to the hospital when he was six. One where he had to fight off Dementors then got beat up by Vernon when he was 15. The last one was the first time he was beat up at age three when he forgot to clean one spot of the kitchen floor and went without food for a week.
"Okay, we're ignoring the fact that your godson, husband and godfather died. When's the wedding? Can I come?" George asked.
It took a couple seconds but she responded with, "It was Doctor Potter's. He would spend his time here with Doctor Banner and Master Snape while he was carrying you and after when he couldn't go anywhere seeing as Agent Potter wouldn't let him go anywhere."
"With no runes, the Veil would take a person wherever fate thought they were needed. If a soldier were to go through with no location, fate would take them to a war where they could help. There is no way to track which universe one landed in, but you can track where, when, whether they were are alive, how many years have passed for them, what they are doing currently, their current family and their marital status."
"They're magical photos, so they move." Draco explained when he saw Scott pick one up and look a bit shocked.
"So! Now that that's out of the way! Why don't we all just go back to the compound and enjoy some nice tea?"
Nick Fury was a very smart man. So when he became the director of SHIELD, his first order was to look at any unsolved cases. It took a long time to find, but the one that interested him the most was an energy surge in 1970. The director on the case was Peggy Carter. The energy surge had originated in London, England. SHIELD agents were sent to check out the site. All they found was some blood which they tested but found nothing. The blood led to no one, meaning whosever blood it was was probably unregistered. They kept samples of the blood in case anything else every popped up. Nothing did pop up for years to they closed the case, saying it was animal blood.
Of course, he didn't know what the one in the compound looked like, so that was going to be a surprise for whenever Tony decided to show them.
"Okay..." Draco said softly. He turned back to Weasley, "What's the reason that the Headmaster has to come to the office?"
." The Hallows and the Stones worked together to kill Thanos and his army, Thanos being the last to die.
Harry, unlike everyone else, knew exactly what he was asking, "I took a trip over to the Chamber of Secrets. I know, terrible decision. But, I thought you might like them."
"Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?" Tony said while still working with Peter to get the gauntlet off.
January 5, 2021. George, darling! I need some help. It’s Sev’s birthday on the 9th (for us). I want to get him something special and the only thing I can think of requires some help. Respond quick if you want to help me out.
"Straightforward, are we?" Once again, he stayed silent to see how she would react. She didn't falter. "Harry Potter. The Boy-Who-Lived. But that's not the information you're looking for, is it? You want to know why he knows so many with the names of my comrades. Harry Potter visited me, once. Back when I was merely a twenty year-old. Said he needed help bringing his friends back. Though, he introduced himself as Hadrian Black. He was intending to come back here, to this time period, but landed with me instead. He gave good advice. He was the one who pushed me to tell Arthur about my magic."
The team nodded (minus Tony who was piloting). Teddy looked out the window as they passed through England. To be honest, Teddy hadn't been to England since they landed on this world.
Harry stopped mixing his potion and looked at Draco, "If we take over the ministry, we could post whatever we want on the Prophet. Rita Skeeter is as good as dead and we all know this Amerah Worogip guy is the new Rita Skeeter. He's young, a decent writer, plus, he's not half bad looking," Harry laughed at the way Draco's jaw clenched at Harry mentioning how good looking Worogip was, "But he's nothing compared to you. I only have eyes for you, Dray."
"First of all, his name is Sirius. Second of all, he's Harry's godfather. Third of all, he was portal hopping the Veil and ended up here with us."
was going to die. No parent wants to outlive their own children. The deeper down the rabbit hole he went, the more depressed he became. His whole immortality thing was something he didn’t want or even liked to think about.
"Of course not. We're not naming her Carina. But it's too early to be thinking of names. Let's find out the gender then decide a name, okay?"
"Good thing you won't then. He has us magical people to help him now." Draco smiled and pulled out a pen, transfiguring it into a chair for Gwaine.
"I am the Master of Death. Death listens to me, and me alone. You can do nothing that I cannot fix. I am immortal, while you will die. I can kill you with a snap of my fingers if I'd like. And wouldn't that be ironic?"
Fury pulled out the small version of Potter's file and placed it on top of the case file he was working on.
There had been no news from Clint other than he was going on a murder spree. Thor, Loki and the Asgardians who had survived created a New Asgard on Earth.
"Thank you, Leon." Harry smiled. Leon smiled back. "You should really be thanking Merlin. He's the one who woke me up. By the way, Merlin, where's the neckerchief?"
Everyone showed up at the communal floor in the Avengers tower. They were all dressed fancily, even Peter who didn't have many fancy things. Teddy walked over to him and smiled.
"The Veil," Teddy tried, "We can go through the Veil. They can't follow us through there without dying."
"My younger brother. Died trying to get the Horcruxes once he turned against the Dark Lord." Sirius explained.
To anyone who didn't know this was Merlin, wouldn't know. The plaque at the bottom of the frame said 'The Great Dragoon'.
The Weasley boy instantly grabbed his wand and a cup of water from inside his desk, splashing it on Draco.
"Damn right you will. I'm not letting you or your adorable arse go anywhere." Harry smirked, lowering one hand to rest on Draco's arse.
"You're right. It wasn't Draco Malfoy. It was Draco Potter. You may not like Draco, but he's good for Harry. They help each other. They complement each other. You may never accept their relationship, that's your problem. But do not for one second insinuate that Draco Potter does not love Harry Potter. I have never, in my hundreds of years of living, seen a couple more in love than them.
Draco went over to the door and opened it for them. Arthur made his way in as soon as he could and went over to Merlin's bedside.
When Harry first heard his sons cry, he thought his world stopped. He never thought they would have another baby after Carina, but he was so happy now. Harry cut the umbilical cord and wrapped his son in a baby blue blanket. He was cleaning him up while Severus was still working on Draco. Draco had been anesthetized from the neck down so Harry brought their son to him.
Harry smiled a bit before sitting down. "Great! Now that we all know he has magic, can I please change out of these clothes? I don't know how you survive in these," He gestured at the tunic and trousers he had on.
The rush of emotion made him fall onto his knees. He screamed, causing the power he absorbed to be let out, smashing everything to pieces, the windows, the walls, everything.
Before Severus could respond, Scorpius spoke again, pointing at the screen, specifically at Draco. "Papa."
"So! Now that that's out of the way, wanna tell us why you're here and how you got here?" Tony suggested.
"Can you meet me in my office in twenty minutes? I need somethings to talk to you about. Seeing as you are the Head of Magical Law Enforcement."
Sam and Rhodey were matching because they were best friends. So were Wanda and Loki considering how close they had gotten over the years. Valkyrie and Thor were matching because of their friendship. Elyan and Leon were matching too.
Snape rolled his eyes but handed over the antidote which Bucky took and shook off the effects of the potion.
Hermione didn't know what to say. The unborn child, Carina, had been killed. It wasn't a miscarriage or an abortion. She was murdered by her people. She couldn't think. Everything was overwhelming her. There was so much going on. Harry always had so much going on.
Teddy frowned, "They died a month after I was born. Gran took care of me until she died the year I graduated."
Teddy laughed again before turned back to his platinum hair and green eyes. "It's how I reminded myself of Draco and Harry while they were on their run. I just turned myself into their love child! Of course we have the iconic Malfoy blonde hair and the Evans' green eyes."
Thanos did as he was told and let go of Peter. Everyone else just stopped moving and watched as a boy with blue hair flowing in the wind was ind controlling a Mad Titan.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. He hadn't even realized he had been doing that. Hermione also pointed it out in fifth year on the first day of the DA that he did that when he was nervous.
"Then his mother died. He locked himself in his room, ignoring his work, me and even Teddy. I finally convinced him to let me. It wasn't good, Sirius. He was on the verge of dropping everything."
He stood next to Teddy, Elder wand pointed at the door. Draco leaned against the wall with Banner next to him. He didn't even bother asking who it was. He was familiar with the Doctor's work. At the moment, he just needed to rest a bit. Coming back to life really takes the life out of you.
"I don't know. But either way, it's probably someone that they didn't like. Someone who fought against Voldemort in the war, most likely."
"Yes, but not everyone can cast one. Others, like Severus or Teddy's dad, preferred non-corporal Patronus'. You can send messages through them or fight of Dementors." Harry explained.
Sirius laughed and took a shot. Tony and Clint both also took a shot. And Draco also took one. Everyone was surprised at that one.
"He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other."
"Who's this kid?" Quill asked. "He looks like he just got out of school and decided to go on watch a movie with his friends but ended up on an alien ship."
"So, my favorite newcomers," Tony started, going to grab a box, he had hidden under the couch, "You've been here since... September? October? Since whenever and no one knows you exist. So," He said pulling out a packet of papers for each of them, "Congratulations, you're now real people in this world. I made middle and last names for you and you better like them 'cause I already made everything based on them!"
Instead of sulking, Draco went over to the tower with his trunk and went up to the Avengers penthouse.
In all honesty, the circlet looked like it would belong to a king. There were three main bands braided around the whole thing. The middle was the most impressive part. The stone was placed where there were more of the bands sticking out and connecting to the main band. At the top of the stone were two parts which were made to look like horns, like something Loki would wear. It was honestly a thing that people would’ve fought over if it wasn’t a death symbol.
"I don't like admitting this to anyone, I don't even know if Draco knows, but I also came from an abusive family. My father, a muggle man, was against the magic in my mother and I. They were always fighting and my father always neglected me. When he did pay attention to me, it was to hit me and tell me I did something wrong even if I did nothing wrong. I don't know what made me tell you that." Snape mentally face palmed.
First thing he did when he could finally do things on his own was take a shower. When he got out of the shower, he looked at his left arm in the mirror. Draco had told him it was scarred, but he didn't realize how bad it was. He looked like he got his arm slashed open in twenty different places, but a tiny bit better. It didn't hurt, meaning it was likely healed with magic. The more he looked at it, the more he realized it looked like Sectumsempra. He quickly put his shirt on after that.
"Yes. I was wondering if you knew anything of the Veil of Death. I remember reading something that the Veil was built on an old castle of the High Priestesses, which is why I came here."
When was outside, he was just expecting to see Sirius, Steve, Tony, maybe Natasha or Pietro. He definitely was not expecting to see all the Avengers. The first one to notice Harry leave the room was Sirius. Once he stood up, everyone else looked up and also stood up. Sirius walked up to him and looked at the baby.
