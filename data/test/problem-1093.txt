“I’ll admit your Dad has pulled a few stunts in his time,” he conceded, because honestly that
He swallowed and clutched the blanket in his knuckle-white grip.
Potter tugged his arm, leading him to the board again. Teddy ignored them. He was still pushing, prodding and pulling at everything, utterly consumed. “See?” Potter grinned, gesturing to him. “Busy.”
and like he couldn’t put two words together. And that was the last thing he needed right now.
“Have you talked to Granger lately?”
That was before Harry Potter showed up.
Draco and Finnigan both turned around as the door swung open. Potter’s expression brightened as he caught sight of Draco.
All in all, he supposed it wasn’t the worst attempt at interior decorating. At the very least, the large windows allowed for plenty of sunshine and the garden outside was no longer swamped with fluxweed.
That was it. That was the moment he officially gave up. The boy was as good as adopted at this point, so why even fight it? Clearly, Draco was everything Harry and Lily wanted so who was he to stand in the way?
need you to…”
” Harry emerged from behind the telly-thingy, rubbing his head. He gaped at Ron incredulously. “Who said anything about ‘seducing’ Malfoy?” he demanded. “I just invited him over to watch a couple movies, that’s all. Merlin, Ron! We’ve talked about this before. Draco and I are just friends!”
He did? That...was certainly a surprise. He’d always assumed he was the ‘extra’ in this little dynamic they had going on. Andromeda was Teddy’s grandmother and Potter was his godfather. Draco was just a second cousin, hardly a notable title or connection. To hear that Teddy actually
“Thank you for coming, Father,” James mumbled quietly into his chest. “I’m glad you’re here.”
“Malfoy, could you...never mind.”
“I didn’t...I’m sorry, Father. Please...”
“I’m sorry, Potter,” he said out loud. “I truly am. Please believe me when I say it’s for the best.”
Draco scoffed and leaned against a wall, trying to get his twisting insides to settle. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this nervous. How was he going to break the news to Potter? And even if he managed to get the words out, how would Potter take it? Would he be upset? Angry? Or...maybe he wouldn’t care. Maybe this baby wouldn’t mean a thing to him. And why would it when…
Ah, a technicality. Apparently, Draco had a future member of the Wizengamot on his hands. The thought made him chuckle a little.
“Stop!”
“Laugh if you will, but it worked,” Theo argued, pointing indignantly at the book. “The question is, do you want to get past Potter’s honour guard and plant your flag or not?”
Thomas screeched.
was somehow responsible.
“I know how much you like deals, Lucius. One last bargain, for old times' sake.” He flexes his grip; a suggestion of a threat. “I take him and you keep your golden life with all the trappings. Everything you’ve worked so hard to build. The money. The power.
“I understand. My family can be…and
“Mr. Potter,” Draco Malfoy cleared his throat, stepped forward and extended his hand. “It’s an honour, sir. Harry’s told me so much about you.”
“What?” Draco asked with an innocent shrug. “You said I should learn to get along with dogs. So I got one of my own. Isn’t she gorgeous?”
was the one to come rushing to Hogwarts when the Floo-call had come from McGonagall. Harry was borderline hysterical and halfway through the fireplace but in the end, Draco had managed to talk him into staying back somehow.
“Come on. I know where we can go.”
Still, he shied from the overtures. What he had with Potter, this thing they’d been doing...it was too complicated. When he thought about their history and what they’d put each other through —  it went far beyond Potter’s broken nose and the slashes of scars across his own chest. Just a year ago, they’d been out to actively hurt each other in the worst ways. One didn’t just get over that. And even if Potter was trying, even if he was sincere in his intent...well. At best, he was trying to assuage his own guilt. At worst, he was blowing off some steam like he undoubtedly felt he deserved to. Draco was just one more unresolved matter to him, one more thing to put to rest.
Baby Snitch buzzed in contentment and curled a wing around his finger. Harry’s grin widened and he carefully closed his hand around it, letting it rest in his palm again.
“Draco?” Harry’s smile faded and he took a step closer. “Hey, what is it? You look...”
more sneaking around the castle at night.”
A flood of emotions whirled inside him. Draco swallowed, a bit surprised at the sudden lump in his throat. This, all of this, had been so overwhelming. A part of him wished he could just sink into Harry’s arms and let it all out. Just tell him everything and…
“Okay,” she said, her tone taking a noticeably soothing dip. “Deep breaths. Let’s...let’s try this again. I don’t have any treacle tarts and I want you to know, I am very sorry about that. But I want to help. Okay? Will you let me help?”
Then again, maybe not.
“Allow me, Mr. Potter,” Malfoy piped up on cue, sending a glass of wine his way. James managed a half wave in grudging thanks as he took a hearty swig.
it, you oaf. I’m fine!”
Malfoy. I lost my talent for obfuscation in the eighteenth century. It was a forthright time, I quite miss it.”
as he regards Harry. But he doesn’t lunge for his wand.
“Easy there,” he chuckled, pulling Draco over and holding him by the waist. They backed into a tree and Draco leaned against the rough bark. His head was buzzing and he felt strangely content despite the warning lurch of his stomach. Merlin, they really shouldn’t have tried that last loop. Still, being here — with Harry smiling down at him and his fingers tracing soothing circles against the small of his back — he felt content. And it had been a while since he’d felt that way. “What’s with the jelly legs?” Harry asked, nuzzling at his hair now. “You’re usually lighter on your feet.”
However, that didn’t solve her current predicament. She was still excruciatingly bored. The little mermaid sighed and flicked a pebble with her tail, watching it slip into the depths of the painted ocean. The Bathroom remained bereft of any activity. She didn’t even have something nice to look at; not since that Diggory fellow a few years ago…
“Bank a left and head for the goalposts,” Draco called back. He craned his neck to take a better look. “I think I saw something.”
going on about?”
The entire house smelled like garlic and spices. James wrinkled his nose but wisely kept his silence. He had been informed — repeatedly — how monumentally important this dinner was, and he was not stupid enough to get between Lily and her over-seasoning. Not when she’d finally got the roast in the oven and succumbed to a small meltdown over pudding. Instead, he focused on fishing the good silverware out of the cupboards and oh-so-subtly prying for information.
Silence descends, tense and heavy.
Eventually, Potter did seem to get the hint. The invites stopped, the small talk petered out. Potter made himself scarce during the study group and Draco made sure to avoid the Quidditch Pitch. They didn’t talk outside of class, they kept their distance in the hall, even the glances they shared were quick and fleeting. And if they still allowed themselves the occasional indulgence of the Room of Requirement, that was fine. It wasn’t real, after all. So what did a few moments of weakness matter?

Draco groaned and rested his head against the wall. How could he have been so
And what better time than now? They were finally alone. No interruptions. Nothing at all to distract from the inevitable conversation.
to share! They were
No, it wasn’t him.
“A moment.” The vampire raises a languid hand. “I’m guessing you’d rather continue this conversation in private.”
And with that, the traitor gave him a parting kiss, made for the fireplace and took off in record time. Draco scowled into the flickering flames, until an enquiring gurgle started him out of his dark musings. Hugo blinked at him and Draco swallowed.
He watched as Harry left him with one last smile to coach his brood. Brilliant. At least he had until tonight to formulate a new plan. Between Granger’s lack of progress and his own failure to communicate, he needed a new way to start the conversation.
. All of his fears were suddenly realised and there was nothing to do but deal with them.
image was going to stick. But then, he’d been dealing with unresolved feelings for Potter since Fourth Year so it was hardly a revelation. No point in revisiting that mess, certainly.
And so, he doubled over, spewed forth like one of Myrtle’s toilets and sicked up.

“I’m s-sorry,” he stuttered through his sobs. “So sorry, F-father. I d-didn’t mean to...”
“I’m sorry, I might have a missed a memo or two,” a Second Year broke in politely, “SHAG is...?”
“Both of us,” Father added quickly. Dad grinned and squeezed his hand, and James made a face on pure instinct.
“It’s that wench MacDougal.” Father spat the name out like an insult. “She’s hawking her pro-Mudblood agenda in the Wizengamot again. She might be making some headway this time.”
“Okay. Fine.” Deep breaths. Deep. Breaths. “Potter, you...I mean, we...theresababy.”

Great. So, Malfoy Junior was officially one of

to deal with.
The compromise worked and the kids hurtled off, eager to start practicing.
For some absurd reason, his throat clenched at the thought. Draco cursed and rubbed his eyes viciously. For Salazar’s sake! He needed to stop doing this. He’d made his decision. Come tomorrow, this would be over. And if he kept talking to it like an insane person…if he got stupidly attached to it...
Potions went by in a blur. Draco couldn’t even begin to concentrate on his Invisibility Potion, and frankly, he couldn’t care less about it at the moment. He felt sick to his stomach, his head was spinning and the worst of all? Harry’s crestfallen, heartbroken face flashing before his eyes in an accusing infinite loop.
“I hardly think so,” he retorted. The impulse to disagree with Potter was as strong as ever. “He’s always asking for you when he’s at mine.”
Draco tolerated the petting and fussing as best as he could. Molly was a peach and she enjoyed doting on him. Secretly, he rather enjoyed it but one does have an image to worry about.

“Malfoy, get out of my way!”
“Do I look like I’m joking?” Draco hissed dangerously. If Potter had the gall to even
Draco firmly reminded himself.
Hugo detached himself for a second. He patted Draco’s cheek and gurgled seriously at him. Draco blinked at the tiny pocket of warmth against his skin.
“Yes,” Draco replied. “Never take advice from a man who lives with six cats.”
Pomfrey held up a finger to silence him. She was skimming through a Healer’s tome now, nodding to herself and occasionally giving him a scrutinising glance. Draco’s unease just tripled. In all his visits to the Hospital Wing — and there were many — he’d never known Pomfrey to ever require a reference book. Whatever this was...well, he wasn’t going to get any answers until she was done, was he?
“Always a pleasure working with you Draco.”
“...didn’t think anyone would be here right now,” Granger prattled, pulling out a gigantic tome from her bag and setting it on the table with a loud
Draco raised an eyebrow as he entered his study, only to find it already occupied. His son was perched on the window sill, watching the world outside.
— and set up camp across the table. Her bushy hair was done up in a bun and there was a quill sticking out of it. The ink smudge on her cheek suggested that she’d been busy making notes. And now she was here winding down at the library…
“What?” Harry blurted. “But...but why didn’t you just push me off or move away or something?”
Whether it was the baby or motion sickness from the flight he’d just taken or just one of the many joys of being Draco Malfoy, he would never know. What he did know was that Harry didn’t back away in time, there was no time to make a run for it and the Fates obviously hated him.
If that wasn’t a clear indication of his feelings on the matter, Draco didn’t know what was.
“Bribes?” Draco smirked. “How very Slytherin of you.”
to see him.
Harry smiled and Draco leaned in for a kiss, only to be thwarted as Helga reared up and licked his face again.
“Well, that’s certainly true,” Draco commented wryly. “And all it took was Finnigan stepping all over your territory for you to figure it out.”
“Okay. Look, Potter. I...about what we’ve...you know, been doing. There’s something you should know. I...that is,
Draco would have laughed if it didn’t feel like his throat was seizing up and closing in on itself.
, to keep his focus anywhere but on that smirking, taunting mouth. “Hasn’t anyone told you it’s rude to eavesdrop, lordling?” He was close enough that Draco would have felt the heat coming off him, had there been any. “Dangerous too. We wouldn’t want you compromised.”
most of them, Mr Potter! And you, Mr Malfoy. I would have thought, you at least, would have a sense of propriety…”
It certainly helped that Potter was one of the people he was so assiduously avoiding.
Fortunately, there was something poking out of Harry’s backpack.
The Stomach Settling Draught from Pomfrey. The one that had been interfering with his casting all day.
He was asleep again before the ash had settled.
“I can’t go home,” he announced accusingly.
James sneezed. It came on so suddenly, he couldn’t even prepare to stifle it. His heart lurched and he cursed his luck. Of course.
“He’s really good,” Harry continued, smiling fondly at Malfoy. “Bill Weasley says he’s a shoo-in for…”
“Now, now,” the Friar sighed, floating placidly alongside him. “No need to cause a stir, old friend. I’m sure it’s just the wind. Or some child’s familiar prowling about. The little ones aren’t even unpacked yet, you know how the first week is.”
James felt guilt coil deep inside him. “I didn’t expect you,” he corrected. “I think…I think I had this idea of you and I just ran with it.”
she gave him a pointed look – “are going to behave yourself. It’s not every day Harry asks to bring someone to dinner. The only other one who got that far was little Miss What’s-Her-Face.”
“I thought I had you this time,” he griped, pretty and pouting. It was all Harry could do not to turn the tables and pin him down.
is…I suppose it was too much to ask to get along right from the start.” He gave James a cautious glance. “Maybe we just need to spend more time together?” James shrugged in reply and Draco took a deep breath, clearly steeling himself for what he had to say next. “Look, Mr. Potter. I realise you might not want to hear this right now, but I think it’s important for you to know. Harry…he’s my everything. He means the world to me and — assuming that he’s alright with it — I plan to spend the rest of my life with him. So, I would strongly suggest that you get used to me because…well, I’m not going anywhere.”
Suddenly, Draco wanted nothing less than to have this, or any conversation with Potter. This was clearly a bad time.
There, I said it!”
“I’m going home,” he told them. “Got to take care of this.”
“I think it came from somewhere here, Sir Nicholas,” a voice spoke up.
Draco nodded distractedly. He didn’t notice Potter glaring daggers at Finnigan.
He allowed himself a fond smile before immediately schooling his expression. The children knew they were not allowed in his study. Of course, Albus was at that age when he would want to test boundaries but that was precisely why the rules had to be enforced.
Why did the prat have to make everything so difficult?

Repeatedly.

There’s an answering chuckle, one Draco instantly recognised. His pulse quickened in Pavlovian response.

Silence.
“You’re…” Harry blinked and shook his head. “You’re…”
“So that’s how it is.” Harry chuckled and flicked his fingers. The Firebolt sped to him and Draco barely had a moment to be impressed by that easy display of wandless magic before Potter was beckoning to him. “Come on,” he said. “Let’s go chase it down.”
what Dad was like about the sport. And Draco honestly scared him during World Cup Season. And yet somehow, he hadn’t put two and two together. He shook his head, amazed at his own cluelessness and turned to his mother for emotional support.
for the verdict.
“No,” James answered at once, because really, he hadn’t done anything wrong. He was just a kid who wanted his boyfriend’s parents to like him. “No, you didn’t, Draco. It’s just…”
First, he had only secured an A on that Com Lit Final which was devastating enough. Father had of course, followed up that happy occasion with the usual lecture, featuring some old classics including
He wasn’t even slightly surprised when Draco bounced out, already dressed in full Quidditch gear. It took him thirty minutes to gear up on a good day. When had he even woken up? Harry decided he didn’t want to know. Nothing good ever came from getting in between
There were reasons for this uncharacteristic emotional landslide, of course. Draco wasn’t
James nodded firmly, clapped the boy’s shoulder and looked him dead in the eye. “If you
“They wrote a book about it, didn’t they?” Draco muttered, snatching the book back. Wonderful. Just perfect. He finally hooked a Gryffindor and it was the wrong one! Merlin help him, Granger was like a crup with a bone when she found something new to study. Now she wouldn’t shut up about it until…
“I’m f-f-fine,” Dean mumbled shakily, taking a large swig of his whisky.
Just like your father.”
Helena wagged her tail and barked in greeting. Harry just stared, absolutely speechless.
“Can we…”
“You don’t like me,” Draco said. He sounded so resigned about it, like hoping for anything more was pointless.

“What in Merlin’s name is all this?”

“Okay, okay!”
Peas.
James stirred sleepily in his arms— slack and exhausted from his emotional outburst— but he didn’t answer. Draco jostled him gently. They needed to talk about this. “James, answer me please.”
way off for us.”
So he bit his tongue, clenched his fists into the bedlinen and waited
“Just so you know,” Potter murmured, the hint of a smile playing on his lips, “I don’t mind you messing with me. In fact, I...I guess I’m used to it. I might even, I don’t know, like it. I guess, after everything that’s happened, that bit still feels like a little bit of normal to me. Like not everything’s changed.”
“Teddy, no.” Draco huffed as Teddy tried to push him away. “You have to share. Go play with the spring instead.”
He liked having Teddy around. Even if it was only on the weekends, looking after him and spending time with him...it eased his loneliness. His social life since the war was non-existent. The trial had been far more favourable than he deserved and he knew he should be grateful for his freedom, his job at the Ministry and the substantial family fortune that still remained even after paying out countless restitutions. But now, one year into the ‘new era of hope’ — as the Ministry so loved to call it — he felt the pangs of loneliness far more than gratitude. His parents were exiled, his friends had fled and he seldom ventured out anywhere for fear of hexes, curses and judging glances. Having Teddy, even for the too short weekends when he wasn’t drowning in work, helped alleviate that.
“Will you come with me?” he asked Granger. It was embarrassing and humbling but...she’d been here for him. He really didn’t think he could do it without her. “Please, Granger. I don’t...I don’t want to do it alone.”
“That’s not true," Harry said. “You passed Logic and Strategy with the best grades in the programme, remember?”
"Okay, Draco," Harry said and looked at professor Skepperus. He knew from the burning in his left cheek that Malfoy was still leering at him.
“You think so?”
“I don’t exactly recall Hogwarts as a safe place,” Draco said. “The latest body isn’t even cold.”
Narcissa tenses and Draco puts his hands on her shoulders. They're big, and all of a sudden Narcissa realizes she's looking at a man, not a boy.
" he said.
"Did you hear about the Malfoy case already?"
“It says-”
Harry handed the pot back to Neville as it had started kicking his forearm impatiently.
“I didn’t know you draw so well," Harry said as Draco sat down on the bed.
“That means it’s got to be one of those”, Draco said and turned to look at the shelves that towered over them from each wall.
“Why wasn’t anyone already sitting next to you?” Draco asked. Potter had taken him to the dorms building and was now holding the front door open for him. Draco wondered if they were on their way to Potter’s dorm. The thought made him nervous.
“I hope so,” Neville said, put the clippers back in his pocket and stepped back to take a good look at the plant. “I always hope people realize what’s really important before it’s too late. Not many of us get that chance.”
"Of course not."
Grandmother Yana smiled, and the smile soon widened into a disgusting grin.
Despite having agreed they should both study that day, it didn’t take long before Harry got a paper crane from Draco.
“If only McGonagall had really turned one of us into a pocket watch…”
“You know that it would be okay, right?” Hermione said. “It wouldn’t change anything between you and Ron and I.”
“My parents tried their best to raise me to be less of a whimp," Draco finally said, looking up at the ceiling. “But it didn’t really work out. I only learned how to cover up how much of a wuss I was.”
“No it’s not”, Ron laughed. “It’s Halloween tomorrow. We have the day off.”
“No," Draco said and looked at Harry. “No. You don’t get to pretend it was all okay, because it wasn’t. And I’m sorry.”
Harry receives some well overdue sex education.
Arrange an heir? Draco's gut twisted a little.
“Looks like these people have better things to do," Draco muttered. “Let’s go to a library instead. Muggles have libraries, right?”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked. “I’m sure she doesn’t mind.”
Draco heard the words escaping Harry’s mouth, and he caught them into his own before parting with his lips just enough to breathe his air, and mouthed:
Harry and Draco break into professor Skepperus' office, but not everything goes according to plan. When it comes to the past, are Harry and Draco really just two sides of the same coin?
“Dimitri”, Harry repeated, trying to mimic the awe-invoking way Draco pronounced the name.
“Sorry," Harry said, and not having realized he had stopped reading, tried to continue.
"That's… that's kind of gay, man."
Failing to hide his flushed face, Harry said:
“I’m not… Not usually that good at gentle," Draco muttered.
“I wouldn’t go against your supervisor if I were you,” Percy said. “Why do you even insist on taking care of this yourself? If Spencer knew that father gave you the Malfoy file-”
started to understand a little. Lucius has promised to teach her.
"I wouldn't worry about it too much. It happens to the best of us. You do so well-"
A burning feeling took over Draco’s chest, but he smiled politely. At this rate, it was going to be a long night.
"Fair enough." Remus sipped his tea.
talking about the same Draco Malfoy that tried to kill Dumbledore? And who tried to use an unforgivable curse on you?”
"Yes."
"Rolf Scamander? Yeah, didn't he graduate last Spring?"
“I do know why no one was sitting next to me," Harry said as he sat down, leaning his back against the door. “I guess I kind of assumed you did too.”
“No - not when I’m like this…” Harry’s voice sounded strikingly different from how it was normally. It was hoarse and somehow small, kind of as if Harry had trouble taking in air. Just hearing it made Draco cast
Theodore’s hands balled up into fists.
"Hogwarts," Malfoy huffed. "There are other ways to get in."
It was at that moment that Harry’s balance betrayed him. It all happened quite quickly - he suddenly realized he was ominously tilting backwards, pinched his eyes closed and heard the chair hit the floor in a loud clanger. He opened his eyes, confused as the part where he himself thumped against the floor seemed to be missing. It turned out Draco had caught him, and Harry was now looking at the Darthorn logo on his uniform vest from about two millimetres away. He recognized the scent of Draco’s clothes from when Draco had slept in his bed - what, a month or so ago? It reminded Harry of rainy days and the strange comfort they provided when all one wanted to do was lie in bed and read comic books.
“Don’t try to calm me down like I’m some scared pup.” Draco backed off a little as Potter sat up, stretching his back with a couple painful-sounding cracks.
“I should go.”
"Rumour has it he was taken into St Mungo's late last night after the accident. He was apparently telling people it was you-know-who who'd done it."
“What do you mean?”
“No," Draco said. He knew that without even checking, because the only place he had ever heard someone talk about poisoned candles had been at a shop in Knockturn Alley, a few doors down from Borgin and Burkes.
“So you were perhaps the last person she spoke to?”
"When I said Harry isn't my friend, I meant…"
Neville chuckled.
“But I’m not a historical figure," Harry noted. “I’m still here.”
“It’s not midnight yet," he said.
Draco wakes Harry up in the middle of the night and learns an important lesson about friendship.
Harry and Draco start working on professor Skepperus' assignment. Draco starts acting strange, and Harry doesn't realize what's going on before it's too late.
Harry jolted awake, his back drenched in cold sweat. He held onto his chest and felt his heart pulsating manically. Harry tried to take deep breaths, holding them in for four seconds before releasing, just like he had been taught. It didn’t help much, but it gave him something to concentrate on. After a while, Harry collapsed onto his back, looking at the dorm’s white, unthreatening ceiling. Thank Merlin it was still there. Harry felt a tear roll down the side of his face and sink into the pillow underneath his head. He must have been crying in his sleep again.
Draco frowned.
“I’ve already threatened to graffiti over every single one of his portraits," a voice said behind Harry. Harry turned around and saw Draco sitting on the stairs leading up to the next floor. They looked at each other in silence as Theodore Nott from Draco’s dorm skipped down the stairs past them.
The idea didn't please, Draco, no. His name was all he had left of his family. But, then again, he had never been close with his father… And a name was just a name.
“You too. We should go.”
“No, man, just… Curious.”
It didn’t take Draco long to come across a triangular form within the dirt, its metal frame cool against his fingers, even colder than the winter earth. Draco pulled out the Wadjet, the long chain trailing after it. He had hoped never to see it again, but holding it now, he couldn’t deny that it was a beautiful thing, even though it was covered in mud. He brushed some of it off, and now it looked as if the eye of Horus fixed its gaze upon him.
Harry agreed with Dean. Even though, apparently, he was technically a top, he wasn’t at all sure about who had taken who earlier that day.
"Other son?"
“I don’t know," Harry said and tried pressing some of the other buttons. Nothing happened.
It had felt odd to leave his wand behind. He had hidden it under his pillow. Not that he was afraid of anyone stealing it - no one in his dorm even knew he didn't have his wand on him. It just felt safer that way, somehow.
A small, worried wrinkle appeared between Draco's brows as he frowned.
“The house elves. But I wasn’t in the mood to see my grandmother.”
Draco stared at him.
“Guess what," she said, smiling from ear to ear.
“Of course not," Dean rushed to say. “We just thought, since you usually avoid publicity…”
just to edge Harry on with the cold that almost instantly dissolved into a pleasant slick against the heat of their bodies), and then everything was edges of blunt fingernails digging into Draco’s back, hot, hitched whimpers against his shoulder, native to the pleasure that was close to being more unbearable than the short moment of pain that came before it, and the thought that perhaps God existed after all. Against the background of a room of a sad, smoking poet from decades ago, wood panelling, yellowed pages of books no one reads anymore and all, Harry’s freshly-shaven jawline became the place for Draco to plant his half-kisses as he fucked him, his tightly enveloping warmth, too good for his words to do justice.
Despite Harry almost losing his faith once or twice, midnight did come. Harry was so eager to hear what kind of plan Malfoy had come up with that he arrived to the courtyard fifteen minutes early. He was surprised to see Malfoy was there already, leaning onto a column. He was dressed in the same outfit Harry had seen him wear at the lab, and it would’ve been difficult to see him in the dark if it wasn’t for his platinum hair that gleamed silvery in the moonlight. Malfoy glanced at his watch when he saw Harry approaching.
for him, it’s-”
“I have an Invisibility Cloak.”
He started to feel uneasy. He wanted to go back to the tent on the quidditch field but didn't know how. Clearly there was something in this vision he had to fight or figure out, but what was it? He had already died in the most unsatisfying way he could have possibly came up with.
"I missed you too- woah!"
? Blimey, Harry...” Ron lowered his voice. “You two are bloody well going at it like rabbits!”
“Excuse me?” He said, smiling in disbelief. “But I haven’t-”
“Apparently headmaster McGonagall had invited both of them there to discuss teaching positions,” Arthur said. “They still haven’t found a competent Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, and the Scamander boy was there to discuss the Magizoology post.”
“You’d be surprised," Lucius said, correcting his posture. “The likes of
“I thought you said you didn’t hang out with her anymore," Harry said.
"Well, thank heavens for that," Narcissa says, nervously laughing. Why is she nervous? This is
“Anything interesting?” Draco said. “On the body?”
"I see," McGonagall said, leaning tensely back in her chair, as if she were wearing a tightly laced garment under her robes. "And do you often accompany Mr. Potter when he is at work, Mr…"
A smug grin appeared on Ron’s face.
“I don’t think so,” Draco said. He blinked a few times, but his eyes kept watering for some reason.
“Just the code for ‘gay as fuck’ in the gay agenda," Seamus said as he returned with an amused- looking Dean.
“Merlin, Draco," Harry said. “It’s freezing out here. How long have you been standing there?”
“Like what? At this rate we’ll both fail.”
“Well it certainly looked like you would have if I hadn’t showed up," Ron huffed.
Draco stared at her. He wasn’t at all used to being so unable to follow a conversation.
"So, are you and Pansy still a thing?"
“What makes you so sure?” Hermione asked, leaning forward on the sofa. She had a smug smile in the corner of her mouth. “What do you do when you don’t like someone, Harry?”
"I don't mind sappy."
“Merlin, Draco," he said, “it’s like, what, five in the morning? A little early to pounce on me, don’t you think?”
"Draco said I could run around London and hand out tiny hats to people."
“Because it always has to be one of ours,” Fleur said quietly, rolling her eyes.
Harry couldn’t help but smile as he read the card, although he had no idea what Luna meant by the Moon Frog being a good sign. Harry also didn’t know what a Moon Frog was, or whether such creatures existed, but this was Luna so that wasn’t what baffled him the most. What Luna had written sounded almost as if she had known that Harry had feelings for Draco, but that didn’t make any sense. No one had known about that, not even Harry himself for the most part, when Luna had written the card.
. The picture was a of Draco from the trials, poorly pasted onto one of the many pictures the press had of Harry, to make it seem like they were in the picture together. Although Harry wasn’t very pleased with Draco being referred to as an “ex-Death Eater”, he made a mental note to cut the picture out later and save it. After all, there was no knowing how long it would take before he would have a real picture with Draco.
“Can’t really complain," Harry said. “I mean, it’s kind of draining every drop of energy out of me but I’m also just really lucky to be there.”
“Just a minute," Hermione’s voice said. She soon appeared from behind what Harry recalled was the history aisle, carrying a pile of books so tall her face wasn’t visible.
“Then end this farce of an attempt to spite me and come home.”
“Careful, now. What if Ron hears us?”
turn back as much as he did now, but the people, the press, everything… Everything was buzzing and prickling and moving and Harry just wanted it to be still. He wanted it to be quiet and empty and just Draco and him. Out of context.
“Yeah, no kidding," Draco huffed. “Am I interpreting it wrong or does it say we have to come up with a scenario where a… struggle?”
“Yeah," Harry said. “Sorry for keeping you awake. Or, asleep, I don’t know.”
He was in a room, similar to his own but a lot messier, and the walls were plastered with Quidditch posters in colours that Draco could tell were garish even in the dim, blue light of the sun that had yet to rise. The writing desk was buried under piles of books, folders and loose pieces of parchment, and above it hung a carelessly compiled collage of what looked like newspaper clippings. Draco squinted. Every article was about Aurors.
“Yeah," Harry said and felt his curiosity awakening. It felt very unusual for a portrait to seem so invested in human affairs. “What is it?”
Draco and Harry watched, perplexed as Neville held out his hand - Draco now noticed something glossy and sticky-looking on his palm - and the bee flew to him, landing in hesitant circles on his hand. Shielding it with his other hand, Neville smiled.
“They thought he would be less trouble there,” Gwen said, and her eyes twinkled as she looked up at Draco.
Then, Draco took a handful of Floo powder from the bowl on the mantle.
“She still writes to me every now and then," Draco said, staring at the dried snakes in his palm. “You should go now. I need to finish this potion.”
Harry chuckled.
“What?”
"It's a yes," Draco said. "But it's… it wouldn't be easy. We'd get hurt, we'd both get hurt. And we'll hurt other people."
“Who are you?”
"I was," she says, her voice fainter than she would have liked. "I came to bring you home."
“What about the leeches, were they alive when you added them?”
“You really thought I’d let you off easy after what you pulled earlier?” While Harry pulled back to say that, he ran his finger just around the tip of Draco’s cock - Merlin, that was
“Saying that pretty much defeats the purpose," Harry noted.
"Dean and Seamus are a couple. Like, a gay couple."
Harry kept looking at his watch.
“And you’re not? Well, I do have an assignment due tomorrow, so if you need a rain check-”
Draco startled awake. This wasn’t his bed.
“You better go and break it up then," Draco said. “Harry’s got that test tomorrow and everything."
“Let’s go to the kitchen. I’ll fix us something.”
“Honestly, I don’t know what’s gotten into him," Harry said, feeling unexpected frustration trying to make its way out. “He used to be good at Charms when we were in Hogwarts. I know he’s trying but - is he? Like, is he really?”
“How do you-”
“It figures that you’d be a faggot, but even Malfoy… Rich. Tell me, which one of you takes it up the arse?”
"I just wanted to say... I'm sorry about Luna going to Africa with Rolf," Harry said. He was starting to be slightly out of breath. "I know you're upset about it, and it's okay. But you're not alone just because she left."
“I can’t," Harry said. “I promised Draco I wouldn’t.”
"Doesn't feel very manly being swept off my feet like this," Harry noted as he landed on top of Draco.
And with that, they disapparated.
“He isn’t really, he’s just a character…”
“But you’re forgetting that so can I. And I’m having
“Actually, I might know where she is," Harry said and turned to leave. He then wheeled around and looked at Larry the Giraffe. “Thanks, Larry. But, could you not tell anyone about…”
Harry immediately stopped talking and his eyes shot up to look at the corners of the room. Draco looked for the source of the buzzing too, but couldn't find it - it was almost as if - and then the bee was There, gross gross gross creature with no concept of personal space, and Draco and Harry scrambled over each other on the bed to get away from it. They shared a brief look that contained both a pact to never mention the screams that had escaped them both and a debate over who was going to deal with this.
"Thank you."
“Uh- yeah," Harry said and felt a sudden need to talk to someone about everything that had happened with Draco Malfoy.
Harry didn’t know what Seamus meant and it probably showed in his expression.
, “exactly?”
“What was that, darling? I didn’t quite catch that.”
Much like the two previous years, Harry had spent the summer with Remus, Tonks and their son (and Harry's godson) Teddy, who was now three years old. To his parents' great relief, Teddy hadn't inherited his father's lycanthropy. He had, however, turned out to be a metamorphmagus like his mother. This trait had presented itself for the first time on a hot August day, only a few weeks before Harry was to travel back to Darthorn.
“Yes?”
“Sounds like the smart thing to do," Harry said. He then snorted.
"I did make Felix Felicis, though."
He stuffed the note into the pocket of his uniform trousers (loosely fitting, coffee-colouded corduroy with lots of pockets for the herbology majors) and kept looking. The giraffe Dean had affectionately named Larry stared at the two boys patiently. Finally Neville pulled out another piece of paper, this time considerably less tea-stained than the last.
dressed in business casual— despite Theo’s threats to never take him clubbing again.
Draco went back to carding his hair, coaxing him back on the bed. “Soon,” he replied. “I should let Dad know you’re alright. But I’ll stay for a while if you want.”
“They do when I’m around,” the bloke replied with a sheepish grin. He shrugged and held his hand out. “Hello, I’m Harry Potter. Your friendly, neighbourhood accident waiting to happen.”
“Oh, kiddo.” Dad tutted gently, his green eyes bright with concern. “Rough day, huh?” James mumbled in agreement and huddled further into the blanket. Dad smiled and tilted his head. “I heard you got Sorted into Gryffindor. That’s great, you know. We’re so proud of you.”
“Potter…” His voice was a raspy whisper. All of this...he couldn’t get his head around it fast enough. Potter had been watching him? Potter
Clearly, Harry wasn’t the only one who had trouble saying
provide such a reason. But business was business and any worthy Slytherin knew that opportunities came hand-in-hand with risk.
Marina giggled and nodded, enjoying the way his eyes lit up with mirth. “Well then,” he drawled, pulling idly at his pants and slipping them down, ever so slowly. “You’re going to
. “We should be fine now.”
What he does know is that it’s too late to question it now. Even if a small, sensible part of him still feared for his life every time the creature glanced at him.
“What...why...how do you even...” Harry went from honest bewilderment to visible annoyance as he darted between the two of them. And then he threw his arms up in defeat. "Whatever, I’m out of here.” He extricated himself from the table and bench, got up and proceeded to storm off.
Lucius finally steps forward. He still doesn’t dare put himself anywhere near Potter, and while Draco can’t exactly
...until the growl sounded right behind him.
Draco frowned as he read the text. “The Honey Trap?” he repeated sceptically.
Sometimes, Draco really wished he had a Time Turner. There was no dearth of things he would do differently if given the chance, but dealing his thirteen-year-old self a swift kick in the arse definitely made the top five.
Albus cheated to get an upper hand. Lily had a temper. Scorpius was impatient and lacked follow through when he didn’t see immediate results. And James...James was a reckless,
There was another length of tense silence. It was Longbottom who spoke first. “Well, it seems you two have some things to talk about. We’ll just get out of your way. Thanks for the party, Harry. It was...yeah, bye.”
“Last summer. They think they’re keeping it a secret.”
Draco huffed and crossed his arms, still looking put out and sulky and adorable. Harry had to resist the urge to just wrap him up in his arms and keep him there. “You know,” he offered instead, “it might help if we watched the whole thing two or three times. It won’t seem so scary then.”
Draco obliged, still suspicious but somewhat grateful. The scones were right there in front of him, buttery and delicious and finally in reach. He almost didn’t want to believe it. His hand fluttered uncertainly over them for a second. Then the bloke smiled and pushed the plate over to him again. Draco picked up a scone and bit into it.
Draco cleared his throat and lifted his chin, trying his absolute best to look affronted. “I don’t think I like your insinuations,” he told Harry loftily. “Helena is my companion, my best
Malfoy.”
“I suppose it could be,” he replied.
Draco nodded but refrained from making any promises. The truth was that he was done. If last night had proved anything...maybe he simply wasn’t
“Why the hell not?” Draco snapped. This was absurd. If she wanted a fight, fine! He was all geared up for a row anyway.
Okay. Okay, here it was.
Draco bit back on a sigh of resignation. “Tonight,” he agreed softly.
“Very well. Now, about MacDougal. I want you to exercise extreme discretion. She’s...”
“Potter," Theo agreed morosely.
Draco stood up and sneered at him. “That’s not what you said to Weasley.”
“What are you…
“Of course, dearest.” Father smirked and turned back to James, his expression going from playful to appropriately serious in an instant. “And as for you, young man… you would have made an exceptional Slytherin. And you’ll make an excellent Gryffindor. I have no doubt in my mind that you would have done both Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw proud as well. You have
James bunched the sheet in his hands, looking agitated and a bit panicky. Draco could almost see him working things out in his head, trying to find a reason, a decent excuse for what he had done. “It was the first match of the season,” he blurted finally, his voice trembling a fraction. “I...I didn’t want to lose.”
Draco made his way to the Quidditch Pitch that evening with the next phase of his plan firmly in his pocket. It had taken four hours of Charms work and a minor meltdown but he finally had a way to break the news to Potter. A demonstration even he would understand.
Oh Salazar.
was Draco Malfoy. Dressed in tailored robes sporting the Malfoy crest...well, James had to admit he certainly looked the part. Grey eyes, sharp features, white blond hair — yeah, that was
“I missed you too, kiddo,” he murmured, ruffling Harry’s hair a bit. It was just as messy and unkempt as his own. Those shining green eyes though…that was all Lily.
James whimpered. This would cost him a hundred points at
Draco suppressed a groan. “Go to sleep, love,” he murmured. “It’s time for bed.”
Draco startled as a soft voice brushed his ear. He’d been so lost in thought he didn’t even notice that Potter had spotted him and come over. He blinked, looking up into warm, green eyes.
curdled inside him. It was no longer explosive. It was cold. It was unforgiving. It was an invocation against the universe itself for mocking him, for pushing him and driving him to insane retribution. And if he
Draco’s mouth twisted. “Definitely not,” he bit out.
Granger cleared her throat and shifted around him to reach for the bitter root. She started slicing, firmly avoiding eye contact with him. Draco’s brow furrowed at her uncharacteristically quiet demeanor. Normally, when they partnered up, he could barely get her to shut up. Now she wouldn’t even look at him.
Draco nearly jumped out of his skin as Granger’s greeting rang out. The witch breezed past him — summarily ignoring Madame Pince’s annoyed
“I love it,” Harry confirmed. “Best present I ever got. I’m going to keep it forever.”
“Here we go,” he said, as they finally landed. “Safe and sound.”
Several students skittered out of the way as a cackling Draco careened down the corridor, relentlessly pursued by a giant rabbit.
Harry looked extremely wary as he made his way over. But after a few tense seconds, he shouldered past Draco and leaned over to read the peas.
It could only get better from here, right?
Marina blushed, drawing a faint smile from the blond. “The naughtiest, too,” he added with a raised eyebrow. “Surely you don’t plan to stick around and watch me undress?”
“What’s it say?” Finnigan demanded from all the way down at the other end of the table. They were all craning their necks and jostling now, trying to read. Some of the Gryffindors were coming over too, having witnessed the confusion.
“Dean, don’t do that,” Longbottom scolded, pouring another round of whisky. “Anyone want a top off? Harry?”
“Exactly! So you’ve got nothing to worry about.”
Draco took a discreet look around the library before swigging down the last of his prenatal potion. He’d made it here half an hour before study-group to get the books he needed. Now, as he thumbed through a fairly comprehensive tome with detailed cases of male pregnancies — and Merlin, he did
a funeral flower.”
“Albus?” Draco announced his presence.
Potter, if possible, looked even more gormless. And then, the light of comprehension dawned in his eyes. Draco waited with bated breath for the other shoe to drop.
“I’m sorry I hurt you,” Draco replied. He really was. Of all things he regretted in this mess, that made the top of the list. “You have to know I didn’t mean to.”
have been this angry sometime in the past. He had four children, after all. Being driven to fits of rage should be a second nature by now.
“Malfoy,” he intoned gruffly, when Lily raised a meaningful eyebrow at him. “Welcome to our home.”
Albus was still watching the thing with an anxious eye. “In,” he whined, tugging at Draco’s arm. “In, Fadder. Now.”
“Draco.” He blinks as he’s hauled up against a solid chest. Draco swallows against the tightness of his throat. His fingers trail down the cool, muscled planes of Harry’s chest. Trying to memorise him.
Right. Because he’s a vampire and Draco is a fragile human. If Harry ever did lose control — be it hunger or lust — it will be his end. As long as they’re together, Harry will always have to curb his instincts. To be
“You will
Harry made a face. “Really? Celestina Warbeck. That’s the bar then, is it?”
let that happen.”
“I see.” Finnigan’s smile grew wider and his eyes travelled down Draco’s frame. Draco frowned and took a tentative step back but Finnigan just sidled over to him. “I was going to see Harry myself. Me and the boys are throwing a little Halloween get-together at my place. In fact, why don’t you come too? We could all hang out,” he elaborated, leaning in just a little closer. “Maybe you and I could get to know each other a little better?”
Potter’s cocked his head as he considered that. His lips curled into a wicked smirk that sent a thrilling shiver down Draco’s spine. “I think you look rather fetching this way, Malfoy. Perhaps I’ll keep them.”
Draco woke up to an insistent tugging at his hair. He groaned and scrunched his eyes shut, batting at the disturbance.
“Oh, you didn’t,” he mumbled, shaking his head fretfully. “Just tell me you didn’t. Lie if you have to. You’re a Slytherin; you know how it’s done.”
Marina flushed and splashed at him playfully. He was so nice! And that wonder-struck look was perfectly acceptable now, so long as it was trained on
“It’s your own fault,” Harry told Draco as he indulged him with a fond kiss. “All you had to do was walk Godric down the street or toss him a ball now and then. I hope you’ve learnt your lesson.”
Harry grinned to himself and took a deep breath, revelling in the crisp chill and freshness of a lovely December morning. He was out for his walk and while the climb uphill was steep and slow, the view was most certainly worth it. The whole world was cast in a blanket of pristine white. From where he was standing, Harry could gaze down the small hillock and into the woods just beyond. Tall spruce and pines dotted the landscape, their branches specks of green and gleaming white in the sun.
Suddenly, Draco couldn’t quite meet his eyes. His pulse raced and he felt a little dizzy. He tried to find the right words, the five words he’d been practicing for two weeks. Five. Simple. Words.
Cheers rang out from the wireless and James whooped like a madman as Draco eagerly joined in.
Draco startled at the sudden interruption and whirled around. Potter stood in the doorway, holding two cups of steaming cocoa. “Malfoy,” he greeted, eyeing Draco cautiously.
Draco winced and Pince bristled indignantly but Granger barely noticed, babbling merrily about all the studying she intended to do. “I’m barely halfway on that Charms essay on Anti-Apparition. Did you get to that bit about spatial assumptions yet? I thought it was fascinating so I figured I’d come down here and read up before we discussed it in the study group!”
“I know what a Kneazle sounds like,” Nick huffed, sounding affronted. “I assure you, Friar, I may be dead but I’m no simpleton! There’s
this frazzled. It had just been a bloody awful week.
“No!” Draco cried out. The pain in his heart gave way to something else— a fierce, self-righteous, burgeoning wave of rage, the kind warriors in battle might experience when they’re out to defend their land and women from vile invaders.
He missed Dad and his puttering about the kitchen. He missed Father and the scratching noises of his quill as he did the morning crossword. He missed Al and Scorpius too — even if they were small and annoying and had just discovered a new game of who could scream the loudest. He missed his bed and his room and his books and his small, cluttered life.
She didn’t realize that she was leaning forward until she slipped off her rock. With a squeal and a splash, Marina toppled off and into the water. The noise alerted the boys who broke away and turned to her. Grey and green gazes narrowed in accusation and Marina squirmed guiltily.
“Fadder?”
“Let me see if I understand this,” he finally managed. “You’re being cock-blocked by a
Harry’s lips twitched and he forced himself not to break into an outright grin. “Yeah,” he conceded, with the hint of a smile. “That’s...my bad.”
“Stay focused,” she advised as they entered. “The only person you need to concentrate on is Harry. Everything else is background noise. Okay?”
to James. He really should work on that...
Still, despite his exasperation and annoyance at all things Quidditch, an amused smile played on his lips. All in all, that dinner could have been a lot worse. Harry settled in, bemused but content with how things had played out.
Potter shuffled his bunny feet and scratched his ear awkwardly. “How about a date first?” he offered tentatively. “Do you want to go to Hogsmeade with me next weekend?”
Oh. Warmth crept up on him suddenly, taking the edge of his anger. Harry looked so...worried for him, for them. How had he ever feared that this man would reject him? He was so good. So very good. Draco should have trusted him from the very beginning.
“However,” Draco called over the clapping, “you lose points for using a Weasley Wizarding Wheezes product. Make a note of that. BDSM is all about a quality experience. Shoddy, second hand equipment is not acceptable
Potter echoed lazily. The sharp grin belies his delight. His eyes sparkle with unmistakable
“Oh yay,” Potter deadpanned. “More people.”
And with that, she was gone, the door shutting after her and the staircase sliding into place.
Harry frowns as Lucius steps out from the shadows — pale, wand raised and trembling.
“Hall,” James managed in a small, teary voice. “Near the gargoyle.”
The other Eighth Years were staring now, some of them craning back in their seats to catch a look. Harry’s fists clenched. He looked like he was seriously considering going for his wand. Draco braced himself, even as one hand slid discreetly to his stomach in a bid for protection.
he yelped, missing a tree by bare inches.
“Oh, love. We have other scones...”
James considered it. A part of him still missed home, and he knew it wouldn’t just go away. But that sick, heavy feeling in his chest was lifting by the minute. For the first time since he set foot in Hogwarts, he actually felt like he could make it here. Maybe… maybe even grow to like it in time. It would never replace
“Oh,” Harry blurted, eyes wide and unblinking.
Draco cast an exasperated glance in his general direction. “It’s called the Bureau of Devious Slytherins for Mischief, Theo
need to work on your idea of foreplay.”
Al looked thoroughly unconvinced. Instead, he just held his arms out, silently demanding to be picked up. Draco obliged, allowing the little boy to hide in his neck.
But he’d been wrong about one thing.
Hermione,” Harry retorted, which just confirmed Draco’s suspicions that this was some elaborate scheme to ruin his life. Of course, the extent of Weasley’s schemes revolved around how to maximise his sugar quill intake but Granger was certainly devious enough to cook something up.
Draco’s rambling, panicking thoughts came to a screeching standstill. He gaped, shocked into silence, as his mind wrapped around the absurd, horrifying reality of being asked
As if she would ever dream of such a thing. Marina craned her neck, eager to get a better look. The tie came off, and so did the shirt. His back was turned, and she noticed that it was lean and lightly muscled. It made her want to reach out and run her hands all over him. Stupid two-dimensional painting…oh well, at least she could watch.
Lily seemed to have sensed some underlying tension because she quickly stepped in. “It’s so wonderful to finally meet you, Draco,” she said, kind and trusting as always. “We’ve been looking forward to this dinner all week.”
boyfriend with an arm tucked firmly around him and a muscular leg pinning him in place. Harry nuzzled at his neck, making contented purring noises all the while and Draco groaned in dismay.
“Meh?” James echoed. “That’s all you’ve got for me? He’s your cousin!”
“Well well well,” the blond drawled. “And what are
Maybe he just wasn’t a very good Gryffindor.
“It’s not that I don’t trust Malfoy,” Hermione protested as Harry fiddled with his keys. “I'm just
heaps of red, yellow and green blocks. He gurgled triumphantly at his handiwork and Draco rolled his eyes.
The last thing James heard before the flames flickered and they faded away was Father’s sarcastic
And with that, he turned and left, making sure to slam the door behind him.
Yes, Father would rage (thankfully, behind bars) and Mother would fret and write long, tearful letters. People would judge him, far more than they already did. His plans for the future would have to wait, his life would never be the same, everything was going to get
“Why don’t you protect Dean instead?” Potter demanded irritably. “He’s starting to look like a Petrificus victim.”
“Eventually. Soon.”
Stay? Stay here? Draco gave him a nonplussed look and Potter gestured to himself. To his still shirtless self. Draco pointedly averted his gaze.
There was a blur of motion. In the second it took Draco to blink, the door swung open. Potter smirked and leaned against the frame. Behind him, Father sputtered, going positively ashen.
And...there was another matter. Now that he’d made his choice, he couldn’t put it off any longer. As much as he dreaded the conversation, the truth was this child had two fathers.
Marina burst into giggles.
He’s dying.
“Oh? Then what would your pleasure be, little Malfoy?”
inform them about the fireplace next to the Great Hall which is always lit and operational for emergency Floo Calls.”
He tried, he really did. And yet, when he finally opened his mouth to speak…
A single treacle tart, sticky and sickly sweet, thoughtfully wrapped up in a napkin.
“It’s bad, isn’t it?” he muttered.
On an impulse, he leaned up and brushed his lips against Harry’s. The kiss was sweet and gentle, with none of the fierce, urgent passion of their previous encounters. There was intimacy here, though and a promise of things to come.
“Actually,” Potter said. “I was wondering if you’d consider staying a while?”
“As I was saying,” Draco recommenced in a tone that suggested that the next interruption would be the last one, “we haven’t selected this year’s lucky target yet. I have taken the liberty of putting together a small list of vict—er,
Harry shrugged and pulled his skates off, shoving them in the backpack. Draco followed his example and took off his ruined coat, putting it carefully on the bench. The brisk chill made him shiver slightly but it was nothing he couldn’t handle.
Potter gave him one last smile before heading off with Weasley. Draco watched him go, stomach churning and nerves frayed.
Something tender unfurled in Draco’s chest against his will. He’d never quite realised how good Potter was with children. Sure, he was nice to them — it was
Potter took a step forward and held him by the shoulders. The remainder of Draco’s carefully prepared speech fizzled away into nothing. Potter was staring at him now, eyes gentle but strangely determined. Draco swallowed around a lump in his throat. Why did Potter always have to be so...intense? It made him feel wrong-footed and...and
Oh. Well, that...sounded very reasonable. They could hardly leave a two-year-old unsupervised. Still, Draco hesitated. This arrangement only worked as well as it did because they stayed out of each other's way. He had never presumed to stick around while Potter minded Teddy before…
Draco winced and slunk down in his seat. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen Minerva McGonagall so wroth. The witch wasn’t usually one for shouting — even the infamous Dragon Incident of First Year had only pulled a disapproving glare and a few hundred House Points from her — but apparently this time, they’d gone and broken her. At least he could draw a little comfort from the fact that she seemed more upset by the method of his announcement rather than the news itself.
Draco bit his tongue, halting a forthcoming rant on how Dad had also fought an army of Dementors and flown circles around a dragon and would James like to take a crack at those while he was at it. Instead he took a measured tone, still petting his son gently as he spoke.
“I swear I’m not always this crazy,” James explained. “You’ll understand, when you’re a parent someday.”
Still, it wasn’t exactly pleasant. His ears were ringing, he'd missed dinner and despite the relief of finally getting the truth off his chest, there was still the aftermath to deal with. The news would spread through the castle like Fiendfyre, if it hadn’t already. There would be gossip and speculation and eventually, the Prophet would get wind of it. He hadn’t even thought about breaking the news to Mother and then there was the matter of Harry’s adopted family. He could only speculate that the Weasleys would react about as well as McGonagall...
free himself and get a good night’s sleep; he would see to it that he did. Harry growled as if sensing his rebellious thoughts and swung a leg over him again.
“I’m out of practice though. Father thinks Quidditch is for plebians and vagabonds…”
“Oh, love.”
“You say you can’t get the words out. Have you tried writing them down? Maybe a letter will help. Or you could visit Madam Pomfrey together and she could help you explain it.” Her tone gentled a bit. “These are fairly obvious solutions, you know. I don’t really believe you haven’t thought about them yourself.”
Well. This was awkward...
James’s jaw dropped. He could hardly believe...were they really just going to let him get away with it?
His footsteps faltered slightly. Last night, he’d resolved to come clean to Potter. And he still intended to, he
He was
What.
James scowled. Was that a dig? It sounded like a dig. But Malfoy was looking at Harry now, grinning teasingly at him.
said there wasn’t anything to talk about.”
“For the NEWTS, yes,” Draco rallied quickly. His pulse ticked up a notch but he managed a straight face. The last thing he needed was for someone to cotton on to the truth before Potter. Salazar, wouldn’t that be a situation? “But I’ll stick to Charms. You go ahead with that one, Granger. Read, research, discuss. All that rot.”
...with a small, orange leaf in his fingers.

At the very least, she
“Lily’s going to kill him if he ruins dinner,” Remus remarked in the silence.
That, for some reason, pulled a weak chuckle from him. Draco’s hand drifted to his stomach again. Merlin, what a day…
“When did you know?” he asked curiously. “For certain, I mean.”
Marina nodded reluctantly, but the dark-haired boy smirked. “Don’t believe her,” he advised. “She cheats.”

“Me too!”
“I...wait, what?” Draco sputtered in sudden indignation. “That’s not...you avoid me too! You’re the one who stopped coming to study group…”
Ten minutes later, the meeting was adjourned and the students filed out obediently.
kind, wouldn’t you say?”
Blaise disguised his snort of laughter with a cough.
None of this was making sense to him and Harry would very much have liked to figure it out, but Draco was obviously in no mood to talk. “I’m just saying a nap will do you good,” he coaxed gently. “You look knackered, love.”
he told himself firmly.
Harry sighed and pushed him off gently. “No sudden moves,” he whispered. “We don’t want a repeat of the February incident, do we?”
Draco stiffened on instinct. The woman on the screen was approaching the crypt. Her shaking hand wrapped around an ornate handle. Draco gasped and hid his face in his hands, only daring to peek through his fingers. Finnigan squeezed his shoulders gently but it was poor comfort. The woman swung the door of the crypt open.
Not that it mattered. His life was over.
He nodded sympathetically. “I get lonely too, sometimes. I’m not really supposed to be here. I’m not a Prefect or anything. But I can come down and see you sometime if you like?”
and set it firmly in front of him. He could still hear Harry waffling behind him, clearly wondering whether to leave or stay.
. The fact that she’s a healthy, thoroughbred female with a gleaming coat and beautiful, brown eyes is a lucky coincidence. And don’t take that tone with me. It takes two to shag, Potter.”
“Say one word and I’ll hex you into next week,” Draco informed him. He closed his eyes and in seconds, he was fast asleep.
Simple. Clear. To the point. Even Potter had to get it.
Harry swallowed and reached out to take his hands. “I’m so sorry,” he whispered. “I was so angry...and you’ve been...Merlin, Draco. The stress! Are you okay? Is the…”
“Dad!” Harry exclaimed, heading straight for him. “You made it!”
“I suppose I’m supposed to just drop everything and entertain you then?” he enquired dryly. Hugo squealed and Draco supposed that was a
“Draco.”
James grabbed his coat and headed to the Floo.
Oh no.
“You caught me in the middle of a project,” Potter was still talking, evidently oblivious. “I must have lost track of...oh hello, Teddy Bear.”
“Just signal if you need me,” she whispered back. And with a reassuring nod, she went to take her place next to Weasley.
Especially when they happened to be good-looking blokes teetering adorably on roller blades.
“I must have them, Molly,” he intoned with forced calm. “I
“I imagine it is,” Draco murmured. He’d never thought about it that way. How often had he wished to be seen for more than his past? And to think that Potter, of all people, felt exactly the same way. Maybe, just maybe the chasm between their worlds wasn’t so wide after all. And maybe they
“It’s not enough,” James declared firmly. “Obviously, I’m going to have to crack this case myself.”
“Have care how you speak to me, creature,” he sneered. His heart was rabbiting and he knew that Potter could see right through his flimsy pretension. But Father was watching him and he still had a part to play.
to worry about.”
It was official. Winter was the perfect time of year.
“Harry,” Potter corrected with a small grin.
“You’re still learning. Be patient, it will come.”
Oh. Harry pursed his lips to hide a grin. He really shouldn’t be amused by this. Poor Draco had obviously had a rough night. But really, how could he

Marina cocked her head curiously.
lurking in the shadows. Harry wavers. But in the end, the choice is already made. Lucius Malfoy, of all people, made it.
“You’re absolutely ridiculous,” Draco muttered. Warm lips brushed his neck in a small kiss and
He’s eighteen now — fresh out of Hogwarts and on his way to a vaunted career at the Ministry like every Malfoy before him. And yet,

harder nut to crack.
“Treacle…” Harry laughed, trailing off into chuckles. Draco had half a mind to remind him these cravings were only beginning and were at least partially his fault, and then something was being pressed into his hand.
No. Surely, there was another way. He
Potter managed a nervous, unconvincing laugh and Weasley made a face.
Somehow, he doubted that would go down well with the Headmistress.
“Dad…” Harry began.
“Yes!” Teddy squealed and clapped his hands. “Daco!”
“Why don’t you sit down?”
He didn’t have the emotional maturity to raise a child! And even if he could get past that hurdle, there was the family name that could scarcely afford any more tarnish to think of. And his parents...oh Salazar, what would they say? They would balk at a child born out of wedlock. At the very least, they would insist on marriage. And how was he supposed to manage that?
Wait.
He trailed off as his eyes focused on Harry slowly. Malfoy yawned and rubbed his eyes. “Harry? What time’s it?”
“Watch out!”
His eyes prickled again and now it was just irritating. He was being stupid.
A low, throaty moan interrupted her protective musings. The dark haired boy responded by slipping the blond’s shirt off, revealing his toned back. “Need you so much,” he whispered back, his voice low and urgent. He bit down on the blond’s shoulder, eliciting another growl from him.
and their Quidditch obsession.
“I don’t really want to talk about it,” Theo informed him with a sniff. “Do you want my help or not?”
again made something tighten in James’s throat.
Harry nodded, but his eyes darted to Draco’s head. “Hang on,” he said, extending his hand. Draco’s eyes widened as strong, capable fingers sifted through his hair. He didn’t even realise he was holding his breath until Harry withdrew...
Draco was up and out of the classroom before he could finish. He fled down the corridor and leaned against a wall, head in his palms, trying to get his spinning head under control. It wasn’t long before he heard Granger’s soft footsteps approaching.
James just tightened his grip and burrowed into his robes, letting Draco cradle him like an infant. That— more than anything— was a testament to how frightened he must be. For all that Gryffindor bravado, he was barely fourteen. He couldn’t possibly be alright after what he had just been through.
Share?
Meanwhile, back at the house, things were a lot less cheery.
smaller than the original —  now sat in Harry’s palm right next to it. It too, was a bright burnished gold. Roughly the size of a marble, with thready wings just a touch too large for its tiny, round body.
It would be a horrible death too—something involving cheese graters and sea salt. Draco was creative. He could improvise.
“Mm, Harry?” He’s sliding in and out of sleep already but there’s still something he needs to know.  “What happened to him? Tom Riddle?”
He was running out of time. This baby deserved so much better from them. One way or another, he needed Potter to see sense and fast.
“Toys,” Teddy repeated solemnly.
Draco raised an eyebrow at that. Was that a jab?
“We can share,” he murmured.
With nothing to do but wait around while Potter straightened himself out, Draco took him at his word and made himself at home. Teddy was more than happy to accompany him as he took a round of the house.
“I imagine a cellar full of O Negative would invite questions,” their guest quips wryly. “Even for you.”
“But I…”
That...look. He wasn’t sure he would ever forget it.
“Yes, yes. I know you want to see Potter,” Draco grumbled. “Merlin knows you prefer him to me, as you should.” He settled Teddy on his hip and cast a quick Cleaning Charm on the baby's hands. The last thing he needed was Potter finding fault with his handling of their shared charge. He knew it was another thing he should be ‘grateful’ for — that both Potter and Andromeda supported his spending time with Teddy — and he was. But, with Potter...well, there would always be some tension there.
Potter wasn’t particularly hard to track down. There were only a few odd places where he spent his time nowadays. If it wasn’t the Quidditch Pitch, the Great Hall or the Common Room, it had to be the DADA Training Rooms.
Draco winced and shrugged apologetically at a fuming Pince. Granger naturally, ignored them both, snatched the book out of his hands and skimmed it voraciously. “This...Malfoy, is this
“Potter?” he mumbled. It was Potter. Potter was on top of him. Draco groaned as his head swam. That was not good. William’s barking was getting fuzzier. On the other hand, Potter felt so nice and…warm. Draco sighed and curled into him, intending to sleep off for the next ten years or so.
Marina huffed. He was a fine one, telling her off. Considering what
For once, his brash, thoughtless brat of a boy was going to answer for it.
“What?” Harry urged.
Potter’s eyes widened and for a second he looked like he was having second thoughts. But then he flashed Draco a tentative smile. “Well, they don’t call me a Gryffindor for nothing. See you next weekend, Malfoy. I...look forward to it.”
Harry followed, quite unable to do anything else.
“Oh, hush you,” Lily scolded, with a smile in her voice. She passed Malfoy the potatoes and rolled her eyes. “You see what I put up with?”
“Awful habit. I wonder where he gets it,” Dad muttered, giving Father a sly side-eye. James bit back a snicker at his answering glare.
“So, tonight?” Harry grinned, looking so sweet and hopeful that it made his heart clench again.
“Now,” Granger went on. “About Harry. I realise it’s none of my business but why don’t you want to tell him?” Her expression flickered slightly, and sadness flitted across her face for a moment. “He’s always wanted a family, you know. Ever since I’ve known him, that’s what he’s wanted.”
“Draco.” Potter placed his hands on his shoulders, looking stern all of a sudden. In that moment, Draco could almost see him as a future teacher. “I want you to listen to me very carefully, alright?”
“Draco Abraxas Malfoy!” Harry gasped in outrage and went so far as to cover Godric’s ears. “If you’re suggesting even for a second that I put my dog down because you’re not getting any, I will hex you into next week!”
As he made his way through the halls, he found they weren’t as dark and empty anymore. James grinned and hurried back to his common room with a spring in his step.
He needn’t have worried about Pomfrey.
Pomfrey pressed something into his hand. Draco stared, nonplussed and confused, at the innocuous little Bean sitting in his palm.
“It’s not a date. Potter can certainly attest to that. We’re just friends, nothing more.”
“Well, gosh Draco,” Pansy deadpanned. “What ever do you have in mind?”
Draco sighed in defeat and sidled over. Harry hummed happily and settled down again. His arm wrapped around Draco in a death grip and his head rested on Draco’s chest. “Better,” he mumbled approvingly. “Sleep now.”
“I’m not going anywhere. I was just in the other...”
It still hurt, though. Draco knew he’d been harbouring feelings for Potter for a while now. A small part of him had hoped that Potter would return his interest, unlikely though it may be. Now, he knew it was never going to happen. He hadn’t heard much of Potter’s discussion with Weasley, but at one point he had all but yelled
Potter cleared his throat and scuffed his shoe against the carpet. Draco rolled his eyes and turned to face him, quirking an eyebrow. Potter ducked his head again, looking suitably ashamed of himself.
“Daco,” Teddy piped up, tugging his sleeve and pointing down the hallway. “Toys!”
Molly shrugged and gestured to a table behind him. “Well, you’ll have to talk to that young fellow over there then. Perhaps he’ll share, yes?”
Impressive.
“Surprise,” Draco drawled.
There was no way this ended well for Harry. That boy was obviously using him, or worse.
This was it. This was the way. Granger and her hunger for knowledge was inescapable. He couldn’t count the number of times she’d cornered him to ‘discuss’ whatever stirring subject had caught her fancy. Her best friends couldn’t possibly be an exemption! Sooner or later, she would bring up male pregnancy in front of Potter and then the pieces would fall into place. Potter may not believe him but surely, he would believe Granger.
used me as a bloody pillow all night!”
“I d-don’t like it here, F-father! Can I come home? Please?”
“Do you like it?” he asked haltingly. The flush deepened and he hoped to Salazar that Potter wouldn’t call him out on it. “Spending time with them, I mean.”
“Thank you, but no,” Draco replied icily. “I’m taking a break from flying.”
Potter looked justifiably nonplussed. “Yeah,” he replied slowly. “We’re pretty good friends in case you hadn’t noticed.”
Oh, great. Branded a Drama Queen again.
“You do?” Potter’s brow furrowed. “Funny, I had a very different impression.”
He’d been at Hogwarts less than six hours, been a Gryffindor less than five and he was already breaking the rules.
?” Potter demanded, brandishing his wand angrily. “What the bleeding hell?”
‘Harry’ ruffed happily and licked him again. This time, Draco bolted up with a yelp of alarm. The golden retriever puppy wagged his tail and pawed at him, yipping up a storm. Draco groaned and scrubbed at his face.
Hugo just whined in distress and held on tighter. Draco sighed and shook his head.
“Oh, do you think so?” Draco asked innocently.
James sniffed but he didn’t pull away or make any more protests. “Guess I deserve it,” he mumbled.
to tell him...I’m going mental, do you understand?! This is a nightmare. You want my advice?
and pounded the gavel.
“I was just going to see Potter,” Draco replied cautiously. “He invited me over so...”
Potter’s face fell again. “Will you let me make it up to you?” he implored, and he looked so sad and apologetic that Draco almost,

But now…
The mention of Gryffindor didn’t help either.
It was everything he had imagined and better. The chocolate melted on his tongue and the raspberry made his senses flare, and all through that, there was the lovely, flaky pastry. This was it. Life was good again. There was love and peace and beauty in the world and...
“It might interest you to know,” Father went on smoothly, “that your Dad was a wreck when he came to Hogwarts too. Not to mention, he spent half his Second Year convinced the Hat had made a mistake and he should have been Sorted in Slytherin.” He scoffed and rolled his eyes. “As if.”

Apparently. This conversation couldn’t have gone worse if he tried.
for us to focus our talents on. The first name on the list is...”
“Draco, isn’t it?” Lily mused thoughtfully. “Unusual name, but…I think I like it. Very old-fashioned.”
When Harry speaks, he sounds resigned.
He shook his head but the blanket pulled tighter around his shoulders.
Draco stumbled indoors, flushed, numb with cold and with a three year old wrapped around him. Albus mumbled in his sleep and snuffled into his neck. Draco patted him absently, his eyes roving the room and landing on the warm, roaring fire and almost immediately after, on Harry.
“Granger,” Draco cut in when she showed no signs of coming up for air. “Do I look like that Wikipedia thing you told me about? Pick up a book,” he pushed the tome over, suppressing a triumphant smirk, “and learn.”
“Alright.” Potter cocked his head and crossed his arms expectantly. “I’m listening.”
James gaped at her and threw his arms up in incredulous defeat. “How come I never know these things?”
Harry raised an eyebrow as he opened the door to his flat, only to see Draco standing there. “Hello, Draco,” he greeted cautiously. Not so surprisingly, Godric made an immediate appearance and growled, hovering protectively behind Harry. Draco ignored him and focused on his boyfriend.
“I know what will help,” Potter murmured into his hair. “Do you...remember what we talked about the other day? About spending time together? Just the two of us?”
Pomfrey smiled sympathetically. “A lot of things are going to change,” she told him, not unkindly. “At some point, you’re going to need a support system. Believe it or not, you deserve one. And so does your child.”
Pomfrey had a point though. He needed to get a handle on himself. How would he go through with this if he kept welling up like a ninny? And for what? She said it herself — the bab-
“I assume you have the good sense to support Puddlemere United?” he asked.
A fair point. Draco had been rather...bewildering lately. It was a wonder Harry wasn’t tearing his hair out. “I know,” he admitted, somewhat gratified at the momentary flash of surprise in Harry’s eyes. “I’ve been unfair to you. For a long time now. I want to explain, Harry. I do. If you would just…”
They filed out, with Finnigan still telling anyone who would listen that he wasn’t a poacher. The last thing Draco heard before the door shut was an exasperated Thomas telling him to shut up already. Then, he was alone with Potter and there was nothing but silence.
“What made you change your mind?” Lily asked.
They turned back to the toddler. Teddy ignored them both, jabbed violently at the calculator and tugged at a latch. Draco rolled his eyes. He’d been so concerned with losing Teddy’s affections to Potter. Apparently, he should have been worrying about a plywood board instead.
Draco rolled his eyes. “It’s true. You’re going to be a father. Our baby is eight weeks along, very opinionated and loves those horrid watermelon beans you enjoy.” His heart flew when Harry’s grin widened in unmistakable delight. “I can tell she loves you, you know,” he said softly. “There’s a...feeling whenever you’re around. She seems content in your presence.” He hadn’t noticed it before but now, now that he finally had a moment with Harry, he could finally focus on that curious, blissful sense deep inside him. That wasn’t him, he knew it. That...that was her.
He was so caught up in his thoughts, he barely noticed the portrait shifting at the entrance. It wasn’t until Potter ran smack bang into him that he looked up with a surprised yelp.
Of course. Draco rolled his eyes and gathered him close. “Alright,” he sighed, raising his wand and lighting the fireplace. “Let’s go see your godfather then.”
And Draco did, knowing for once, that everything would be just fine from now on.
Godric however, yipped in delight. He lumbered past Harry and all but bolted for their guest— their decidedly
And as Draco pushed him into the nearest bed and whispered filthy promises in his ear, Harry decided forever might just be long enough.
“That’s exactly what
Granger made an alarmed squeaking sound and some of the students turned to look at them. Slughorn, who looked close to nodding off at his desk, jerked up and blinked blearily at him.
“I thought about what you said,” he announced. “And I’ve decided that you were right.”
He’s left standing in the hallway. Again.
“Then that’s all I need to know.” Potter smiled at him then — that earnest, blindingly sincere smile that always made Draco feel like he was standing under a thousand Lumos spells. He was no stranger to Potter’s smiles now — the dangerous, rakish one when he pinned Draco to a wall or the playful one when he nodded at a discreet alcove in a deserted corridor — but this one, this might just be his favourite. Even as he stood there with an explosive, life altering secret still stuck in his throat, he realised how long he’d been waiting for Potter to turn this smile his way.
“No, sir,” Draco replied, his expression a mask of blank politeness. “Forgive my intrusion.”
“Potter, I-I’m…”
Harry had to yell to be heard over the whistle of the wind.
Draco’s heart hammered. His fist clenched. “Granger,” he hissed. “Can’t. Be. Good. For.
Draco tightened his grip reassuringly, but his next words were resolute. “For one thing, I’ve asked your Head of House to take you off the Quidditch team.”
“And we love you. So much,” Father replied softly. “Now get to bed before you’re seen. We don’t want you getting detention on your first day.”
“It’s what Tom would have done,” he admits quietly. “I couldn't do it. Not to you.”
And Draco turned to Harry Potter, with fire in his eyes, grabbed him by the lapels and hauled him up.

“I’m okay. I think.” Harry chuckled too, and shook his head. “I guess it’s still sinking in.” He turned to Draco with a soft, hopeful smile. “Tell me it’s true again?”

“Very well,” she intoned after a tense spell of silence. “I suppose I should address the students — no doubt they have several questions after your little display. You two may speak here and you

hurting him!”
They never really talked about it, and maybe that was Draco’s fault. Potter had tried in the beginning — in that clumsy, determined way of his. An invite to Hogsmeade. Another game of Seeker’s Tag. Did Draco want to take a walk sometime? Maybe they could do that Potions essay together.
“You thought I’d be more like my father,” Draco concluded. He was sharp, James had to give him that. “If it helps, sir, you’re not the first.”
Potter took a few seconds to process that. “You take applications for...you know what, never mind. How about we take this slow?”
“You have a
“Can I have my peas back?” Weasley piped up plaintively. “And some gravy?”
Almost anything, as it turned out. Draco sighed and let Potter pull an arm around him. It felt good, and he didn’t think twice before letting his head fall against the man’s shoulder. He just needed a breather. He needed to think and collect himself.
“You humans.” He clicked his tongue. “So paranoid.” Father’s expression morphed to open indignance, much to the vampire’s delight. “Relax, Malfoy. How many times have you invited me into your home? If I meant you harm, I
Draco started and looked up, only to stare into a pair of stunning, green eyes, sparkling with mirth. The bloke was grinning at him, his smile amused but certainly not mocking. Draco flushed with embarrassment as he recalled the scene he had made. Maybe his friends were right. Maybe he
Malfoy blinked, apparently surprised at the direct address. Fair enough, considering James had done an excellent job avoiding him all night. “I’m training to be a Curse Breaker, sir,” he answered carefully. “I’m finishing my apprenticeship with the goblins next week, actually.”
“Well, it’s a good thing he’s distracted then,” Potter retorted. His hold tightened. His lips brushed the shell of Draco’s ear. He smelled like mint and pine and a little wood-dust, and Draco’s struggles were ceasing and his body was going limp against his bloody will. Potter chuckled and angled his head, letting his lips brush down Draco’s jawline now. It was utterly unfair and Draco wasn’t sure which end was up anymore.
Draco—who had been prepared to go for the butter knife by now— shut up abruptly. His rant trailed off at the unexpected invitation and his eyes narrowed suspiciously. He was obviously being lulled into a false sense of security here. Any second, this tosser would take the scones and make a run for it...
Merlin help him, now what? All this and he
“I assumed morning sickness was...you know, a
His insides roiled. What was he going to do? How would he tell his parents? How would he tell…
“Okay, I’ll just come out and ask,” Harry finally declared. “What did I do?”
Malfoy smiled and took a liberal helping. “I wouldn’t take it personally, Mrs. Potter. Everything’s delicious. Some people just don’t have an…adventurous palate.”
not now. Harry lunged forward to distract him with a kiss before this turned into a full-blown sulk. “How about we go hunting?” he asked, pulling the younger vampire close and mouthing along his throat. It was an old trick but it still made Draco melt. Harry grinned as his Mate hummed happily and tipped his head back. “You can practice your stalking technique.”
“Precious,” the vampire croons teasingly.
. At last check, their Common Room was still deemed unfit for residence. Give it up for Lawrence, everyone.”
Draco’s eyes widened in horror as the awful inescapable reality of
This, he decided, would work out splendidly.
It may have been a reasonable request but Draco still felt slighted by it. This was just as much his Potion as hers and his grade depended on it too. “Fine,” he bit back. “Then I’ll stir.” He edged around her to reach for the stirrer.
While there was no dearth of loud, bright and shiny, it was also obvious that a great deal of care had gone into this space. First of all, it seemed that Potter had built most of the furniture himself. There was a rocking horse in the corner, a little desk and chair set complete with paints and pictures strewn about, some building blocks with bright letters and a little hand-carved broomstick. Draco raised an eyebrow at that last one. He picked it up to investigate, taking note of the fine finishing. It was a charming piece, although certainly not something Teddy should be near without supervision for a few years. Then again, it didn’t seem charmed to fly yet.
Right. About him.
“Why didn’t you just tell me?” Harry asked suddenly.
“Not this time, darling,” he cooed, stroking her in an effort to calm her down. “Maybe we can go for a run to the park later, yeah?”
“Or nephew,” Sirius drawled consideringly. “Or something. I don’t know what to tell you, Prongsy. I barely know him. Reg’s the one who keeps up with that side of the family.”
Harry — forget speaking to him — was enough to send him into fits. The humiliation and the stress...it was too much. It was just too much.
That being said, he couldn’t think of a single thing he could have done to send Draco into such a strop. He had been perfectly fine last night. In fact as Harry recalled, Draco had been very amenable last night. They had kissed and shagged and kissed again and gone to bed with dopey, sated smiles on their faces. Harry felt brilliant—rested and refreshed. So, why had Draco woken up on the proverbial wrong side of the bed?
This was the right decision. He was
Draco hesitated. He could beg off, if he really tried. Potter certainly wouldn’t force him if he said he wasn’t feeling well. But another part of him felt like he really needed this too. He wanted to be there when Harry caught that snitch. He wanted that moment. And, maybe more than he dared admit, he wanted to fly with Harry again, pressed up against him as they raced through the sky.
him stay here if he was sick, right?
Hugo giggled and patted his knee and if Draco cracked a smile at that, nobody could prove it.
Harry just stared, unable to comprehend what he was seeing.
by a woman who’d once scolded him for eating so many Bertie Bott’s Beans, he’d needed a Double Strength Stomach Settling Draught. A mortified blush crept up his neck and the lie was out before he knew it.
“Draco? What’s the matter?”
They stumbled into Harry’s flat, almost crashing into a table in their haste. Draco moaned in approval as Harry wrapped his legs around him and captured his lips again. His arms shifted to pull him closer, holding Harry in place so he could take his time with tasting his gorgeous boyfriend.
Draco’s heart surged. He pushed the plate of scones over to Harry again. Harry raised his eyebrow a fraction and Draco smiled shyly at him.
Her boys! They were here- the blond one
“I…” A blush crept up Draco’s neck. Of all the embarrassing, ridiculous situations to put himself in. And around
“I know,” Draco cut in gently. “I know you are. But that’s not going to cut it this time. You scared your brothers and sister to death and you put your parents through the wringer. I’m afraid an apology is simply not enough. You owe this family more than that.”
They have a long trip before them. He wants to get ahead of the sun.
“Can’t be good for what?” he demanded in a low voice.
“Were you expecting someone else?” he asked, trying not to sound too accusing. Potter should

He was patient and persistent and when Sophie was ready to try again, he helped her cast. Small sparks flew from the wand this time and Sophie’s face lit up with delight.

“Cho Chang?” James put in helpfully. He remembered the bright, young brunette from about a year ago. Pretty, smart, solid Puddlemere U fan…he’d actually liked her. Lily, on the other hand…James snorted. “You just don’t like her because she said your chicken was a little dry.” Lily glared at him and he wisely changed the subject. “How about the Weasley girl? Wasn’t Harry seeing her? She was cute.”
Harry seemed to have reached the end of his rope too. “Really?” he snapped. His fingers went up to wrench at his hair. “This again?! It’s not funny anymore!”

to Harry. Finally, he had to admit defeat. His lips twitched in a small smile. “Alright then,” he found himself saying. “Lead the way.”
“My,” Teddy declared, louder this time.
ruin this for us,” he muttered, as he slipped into the grounds and made his way to the Pitch.
And there...there at the far end of the table, sat Harry. Draco froze in his tracks.
Marina huffed and nodded, making sure to cross the fingers of her free hand behind her back. As soon as she heard the telltale rustle of robes being taken off, she stole a look through her fingers. She bit her lip to hide an appreciative grin. Now,
“Potter, I...” Draco shook his head helplessly. How did this go so
Before James could blink, he was being enveloped in a crushing hug. His heart warmed and he immediately moved to embrace his boy. Harry was so tall now, it felt like he grew a little more every time James saw him. It was almost hard to remember a time when he’d barely come up to his father’s knee. The thought made him tighten his hold just a little more.
Harry just smiled. Then, without a moment’s hesitation, he took off his jacket and draped it around Draco’s shoulders.
There was some grumbling as Dad rolled his eyes and shifted over to make room. James cracked a reluctant grin despite himself. He hadn’t even realised how much he’d missed the sounds of bickering and family. Everyone he loved was so far away...
Draco favoured her with a sharp grin and steepled his hands. “I’m so glad you asked, Pansy. Here’s how it’s going down...”
He sounded appalled. Also, a little intrigued.
Potter gaped at him. “But...”
Harry waved him off and buried his head under a cushion. The hiss of the Floo faded away with the sounds of his boyfriend and his father excitedly swapping Quidditch strategies for the day.
“Come on then,” he sighed, sitting cross-legged on the floor and sifting through the small toy box Harry had provided. “Let’s see what we have here.”
. And...and I don’t think we should see each other anymore.”
Like he had to ask with Draco clambering into his lap and angling for his lips. Harry hummed in satisfaction, enjoying the simple indulgence of holding his lover. It was the closest to heaven the damned could ever get.
“It’s wrong,” he declared sullenly. “The Hat is wrong. I’m not supposed to be here.”
Father’s voice was a strangled hiss. “Go upstairs.
“Oh,” Draco blurted, somewhat caught off-guard. “I...that sounds nice, but I should...”
In the light of day, it was so simple. Draco honestly couldn’t believe he’d spent three restless nights before landing on the obvious solution.
“So...”
He was going to find out sooner or later. All Draco could do was ease him into it and hope that against all odds, the fallout wasn’t entirely catastrophic. And if he kept dragging his feet on this, it would be.
of course he was nice to small children — but this was different. Potter had a genuine connection with these kids. He listened to them and mentored them and they clearly adored him. Even now, they were swarming him like eager kittens, demanding his attention and time. And he indulged them happily, giving them his all like he did with everything else.
Fortunately for Draco, he was rescued from William’s affectionate attentions by the golden lab that came bounding in the room. William abandoned Draco in all of two seconds and bolted over, greeting his new friend with a round of vociferous tail wagging and affectionate nuzzling.
“My,” Teddy decided, when Draco prodded at the flat square thing again. Could he turn it on? What did AC mean? What did
And there it was. Potentially, the worst decision he’d ever made. And yet, lying in a four poster bed in a school he had yet to graduate from, surrounded by pamphlets and a single strawberry bean, Draco felt nothing but relief. His heart felt lighter, like it had been unburdened. Somehow, in that moment, he just knew that no matter what came his way, he would
It’s haunting and painful and it makes him want to shrink into himself. He’d known — at least on some level — that Harry’s life couldn’t have been painless but this
And just like that, the dam broke. James made a choked sound in his throat as he tried to stifle a sob, and then his shoulders were shaking violently and he was crying like the world has fallen to pieces around him.
His determination wavered in the face of this new fear. The temptation of turning tail and running was so strong...but no. No. This wasn’t about him, it was about the baby. The baby who would most definitely be here in less than eight months and if Potter didn’t know now, he certainly would then. Although, given how oblivious the prat was, there was a good chance Draco could just

happy but…I am.” His smile widened and he bussed a kiss to Harry’s cheek. “I couldn’t be happier.”
Draco looked up, jerked out of his mental spiral at Potter’s tetchy tone.
When James stumbled out of the Floo, it was to the sounds of conversation and laughter.
What?
— ” His grip tightens a fraction. “— I’ll leave him be and you give up all this for your boy. I gave you your empire. I can take it away. Just say the word.”
“Now now,” Pomfrey soothed, patting his back gently. “No need to make such a fuss, Mr Malfoy. Really, the way you carry on sometimes…”
The shiver that trails Draco’s spine is
Draco nodded although it didn’t look like he got it. “Did I do something wrong?” he asked finally.
Teddy pattered over to investigate. His eyes widened at the sight of the mystery board. “Ooh,” he declared, grabbing the switch immediately. His little hands went to explore and investigate the entire selection of Muggle rubbish and if Draco wasn’t so confounded, he might have stopped him.
“We just need you to remember one thing,” Dad said, just as firmly. “No matter what happens, you can
“I hunted with him, you know,” Harry goes on tonelessly. “After it happened, I felt nothing for... a long time. So I joined him. I let him teach me. Everything I am, I learned from the thing that killed me.” His eyes harden as he turns to Draco. “So please, don’t ask me to be your Tom Riddle. Because
“Ha ha,” Potter deadpanned. “You’re hilarious.”
Still, he played nice and didn't resist when the fledgling hurtled out of hiding and pinned him to a wall. Draco is so lovely like this — pale and sharp, every bit the beauty he’d been at nineteen when Harry finally Turned him. And yet, he was so much
“What?” Draco shook his head. He was starting to feel very nonplussed. And now he’d forgotten what he wanted to say. Damn it, he’d rehearsed it so carefully! What were the words?!
Brilliant. Another Muggleborn who needed The Talk.
Uncle Ron would probably get a laugh out of it, he thought morosely. Father and Dad? Maybe...not so much. He tried to keep his footsteps light as he crept past the dozing portrait guarding the entrance. Down the stairs, past the painting of the centaurs playing polo...
“She?” Harry sounded awed. “Do you...do you already know…”
Draco made a sound in his throat that had most of the table scattering away for safety. A wave of magic swept out from him, buoyed by two insane weeks of abject rage and frustration. Several cups shattered. Longbottom’s roast caught fire and Finnigan’s shepherd’s pie exploded.
,” she raised her voice slightly as Draco started to protest again, “if you promise to go through the information package and have a good think on things, I will most assuredly honour your choice in the matter. Whatever it may be.”
Draco rakes sharp nails down his back, only to gasp when Harry thrusts his hips in retaliation. Another wave of
Theo smirked and his eyes lit up. “You do realise this is a war, don’t you?” he asked, sounding rather excited about the prospect. “You’re engaged in a battle for Potter’s affections with his pet. I think this calls for...”
“Or,” Remus chided, “you could just get to know the boy with an open mind.”
, just thinking of it made him cringe. He’d all but fled with the shreds of his dignity, leaving a shell-shocked Harry in the dust. Mercifully, Harry hadn’t tried to pursue him or he would most definitely have thrown himself out the nearest window. At any rate, he was too sick and mortified to go back to the Common Room so the Hospital Wing it was. By the time, Madam Pomfrey showed up in the wee hours of morning and shook him awake, he was still nauseous, embarrassed beyond belief and craving treacle tart for some reason.
“Oh,” Potter mumbled in a small voice. He shook his head, making his ears flop about again. “Merlin, you think you know a bloke...”

turn.
Oh, for the love of Neptune...very well, she would humour the nice, handsome boy. Marina rolled her eyes before pressing a hand up against them. His answering chuckle made her smile. He had a nice laugh…
Surely, the rumours about Potter going into hermit mode were an exaggeration though. If the papers were to be believed, he hadn’t ventured into society for months. Of course, Grimmauld Place was heavily warded against intruders — something Draco heartily endorsed given how much time Teddy spent here — and only a select few were permitted entry. Likely, Andromeda, Teddy, Weasley and Granger of course and...himself. But that hardly meant Potter’s supposed loneliness was anything like his. He was
“I love you too,” he mumbled, drifting in and out of sleep.
discussing that with...fuck it, he would
She knew. She
Of course. Why was he even surprised, at this point? Draco shook his head and smiled, finally resigning himself to his fate. He was safe, he was loved, his baby was loved...and that was just something he would have to get used to. He wasn’t alone anymore and even though a part of him hardly dared believe it, he did believe Harry. With all his heart.
Harry sighed regretfully and ruffled Draco’s hair instead. “I’ll be right here,” he murmured, shifting back a bit. “On my side of the bed. You just get your rest, okay?”
The Potions tome dropped to the floor with a thud as Father hurried over quickly. He looked absolutely frantic, and James felt even worse somehow for worrying him so.
“Wait a minute. I’m trying to understand how this…”
James looked like he might cry again. “Father, please,” he whimpered. “I
Would he need a bezoar for this? Did they even have any in the Infirmary? Would he need to go to St Mungo’s?
It came out in a rush of tumbling, stuttering words that he had absolutely no control over.
wouldn’t belong at Hogwarts? It wasn’t the House that was wrong, it was
The shout rang out suddenly, scaring at least ten years off Harry’s life. He exchanged an alarmed look with his mother and then they were both running for the door, wands out and raised. Harry stumbled out on the porch, searching for the source of all the unholy screeching, prepared for anything from hexes to a literal punch up...
quiet. So Draco took a few more minutes to centre himself and to make sure Harry was still asleep. Then he got to work.
“Yeah?” James perked up at the mention of Tonks. The kid was his best Auror, now that Kingsley had officially moved on to politics. “I didn’t know they were friends.”
“Hey there.”
“We’re going to get through this,” he promised softly. If he didn’t know better, he would swear he felt a little flutter under his fingertips. He chuckled softly and resumed his petting. “I’ll figure it out, I promise. Whatever happens, it will always be you and me.”
“Seeker, yeah!” Draco replied, nodding frantically.
“So you
“Sorry,” Draco sighed, flushing to the tips of his ears. Pomfrey had warned him that the Stomach Settling Draught would interfere with his casting ability for the rest of the day. But he didn’t think it would be this bad.
“Read the damn book,” Draco muttered, leaning over to help him. Theo smirked and skimmed through the pages, before finally stopping at something that caught his attention.
, he wondered if he’d made the right decision after all.
But, as he wearily reminded himself, this wasn’t just about him anymore. He was responsible for more than just himself now and whether he liked it or not, so was Potter.
Potter licked his lips and nodded slowly. “I do. Perhaps you’d consider staying a while?”
They sounded so sure. So convinced he could do this. How could they know? How could they possibly know he wouldn’t mess this up?
“You’re…” Harry turned to him again. He shook his head helplessly. “I...I don’t...you’re...really?”
“Now, this might feel a bit uncomfortable. Just try to relax and don’t push back if you can help it.”
Draco didn’t
“Harry…”
The Snitch in his pocket buzzed sleepily and his hand closed around it. “Do
“Fresh air and sunshine?” he murmured, patting his stomach in what he hoped was a reassuring manner. A nervous flutter settled in his gut anyway and he couldn’t tell if it was him or the baby. “Well, let’s go find him then. ”
Potter’s grin widened. “That would be my new project. I was just finishing it up when you arrived.”
It had been a really trying day, but he was strangely content. Being a parent is tough even at the best of times— it’s Chapter One of the all purpose manual no one ever gives you. But he had a feeling he’d done okay by James. His boy would be alright. And if he wasn’t...well, Draco would be there. He would
Honestly, he’d graduated law school just last year, he was an up-and-coming star at his father’s firm and he always,
“And you’re stuck with me,” Potter retorted with a shameless smirk. “Go on and make yourself comfortable, yeah? We can get takeout for dinner or something.”
that brought him back. James cleared his throat and disentangled himself to peer over his son’s shoulder. Lily grinned and winked at him, before gesturing subtly to her right.
If he chose to be.
Draco declined every single time and it wasn’t easy. As hard as it was to admit, he’d wanted Potter’s friendship right from Day One. And now, coming out from the wrong side of the War —  with an uncertain future and a past that would only hold him back — it made sense to curry favour with the right people. Honestly, who better than Potter? The Saviour. The Boy Who Lived Twice. Potter was unassailable now, an undisputed hero no one would dare to question — even if he refused to act like it. To be counted among his friends, even his close acquaintances...it would make all the difference to someone like him.
“Yeah?” Finnigan questioned, cocking his head curiously. “So you’re on a date?”
What was that all about?
him.” His hands fly to cradle Harry’s face, desperate to convince him. Maybe it’s selfish. Maybe after hearing what Harry has been through, he should be understanding. But he just
“My scones?” he demanded hesitantly.
Almost instantly, a wet tongue licked a strip down his face. “Better,” Draco mumbled, still half asleep. “But ‘m tired.”
He popped another bean in his mouth as he reviewed his essay on Anti Apparition Charms. The taste of watermelon spread over his tongue, cool and refreshing. Apparently, it was growing on him. The books said it was much too soon for cravings but even so, he could already sense the slight changing of his tastes. He wondered how intense they would eventually get.
“Really, Potter, stop it,” Draco bit out. “We’re all friends here, after all.”
Helga reached out and gnawed at his sleeve. Draco rolled his eyes and picked her up, staring into those soulful brown eyes. “All I wanted was a shag,” he informed her solemnly. Helga wagged her tail and licked his face.
“Well?” Harry challenged. “Go on then.”
“I’ll think about it,” he lied anyway. What was the point in fighting her and drawing it out? Tomorrow, he would get this mess sorted and after that, it would be like none of it had ever happened. He nodded to himself, collected the pamphlets and headed towards the staircase.
“And I love him despite that,” Draco reassured with a smirk. “It’s all Ron Weasley’s fault, you know. He’s a terrible influence on your son.”
It wasn’t that Draco didn’t appreciate Harry’s...attentions. He hadn’t been raised in the most affectionate household and as much as he disliked admitting to it, Draco rather enjoyed being kissed and fussed over and made much of. Harry was frank and uninhibited in his appreciation and had no trouble showing it— whether in public or in the privacy of their bedroom. Draco liked it, he really did.
He shook his head, feeling slightly bemused and turned to watch Teddy. His baby cousin was busy with the blocks, which gave Draco an opportunity to snoop some more.
A good night for hunting.
“Whoa!” Finnigan squawked. “I’m no poacher! He is not Harry’s date!”
here ever since he was old enough to understand what Hogwarts was. And right up until he stumbled on to the Hogwarts Express, he couldn’t wait to say goodbye to his waving, smiling parents and start his very own adventure.

Draco glared daggers at him. “Oh, you would
But Sasha was clearly on the chase. She howled up a storm and sallied forth, dragging her protesting master behind her.
Honestly. Who else would it be? He’d been here three minutes and he was already annoyed. Still, for Teddy’s sake, Draco pushed it down and resolved to be civil.
“Well...”
Harry rolled his eyes and pushed him towards the bedroom. “You will be when I’m through with you,” he promised.
“Potter.” Draco bit his lip, even as the blush rose to his cheeks. “Do you have a point or not?”
“If we go public?” Draco snorted. “Potter, you have
Father looked up. His grey eyes went wide as saucers. His aghast expression might have been funny if James didn’t feel so utterly awful.
He knew that wasn’t particularly helpful, but he didn’t care. Now that his father was here, the stress and confusion of the whole day were weighing him down like a ton of bricks. He didn’t want to
Right. That was an easy one then. James winced and managed a shaky laugh. “I guess one more week can’t hurt,” he mumbled. “But I’m coming home for Christmas
His eyes widened in surprise when Draco kicked the blankets off and sidled over, settling into Harry’s shoulder with a contented sigh. His arm wrapped around Harry’s waist as he snuggled in. Harry blinked down at the blond head nestled against him, absolutely flummoxed.
His son whipped around at once, blinking in surprise. Draco allowed himself a small smile. It was remarkable how much Albus resembled Harry with his big, green eyes and wild hair. It made his heart tug a little. “Young man, what have I told you about playing in my study?” he asked, in a gentle but firm tone.
He didn’t even realise how complicated this had gotten and he was still pushing for an actual...something between them. How was he going to feel when Draco finally got the words out? How deceived and cheated would he feel then?
This was it. Now or never.
“Evening, Malfoy,” Seamus Finnigan greeted with a cheerful grin. “What brings you to our neck of the woods?”
“Harry, I’m just going to say it. This...” Draco declared, pointing at the offending canine. “...is getting out of hand. How do you expect me to move in here with you when your dog hates me?”
That was when something in the corner caught his eye.
“It’s okay,” Potter said, nudging him gently. “I’d never let them try anything worse than an Impedimenta.”
“Pay attention, Potter,” he muttered. “I promised my mother I’d never cast this spell in polite company again.”
Draco scowled at him. A slight flush tinted his cheeks. He still looked put out and annoyed, but he made no move to leave again. “It’s dark outside,” he informed Harry tersely, “and your stupid movie messed up my head. I can’t go back to an empty house right now! This is all your fault, Potter.”
“Draco,” Father whispered. His eyes darted between Draco and Potter, widening as they fixed on the negligible distance between them. Lucius swallowed and his fingers twitched for his wand. But he stayed where he was — a good forty paces from the apex predator currently sizing up his heir.
Draco rounded the corner, taking the staircase to the newly formed Eighth Year quarters. For the first time, he was thankful they were sequestered in one of the towers and not the dungeons. He still had a lot to learn about babies but he was reasonably sure they needed sunlight and fresh air. Or was that plants? He really needed to read those books Pomfrey had given him…
“What?”
The chattering in the Slytherin Common Room died down. Several older students turned a blasphemous shade of Gryffindor Red. Mercifully, the first years just looked lost.
“Well, that’s new,” Harry said, sounding almost insultingly surprised. “Look, I appreciate the sentiment but you can’t turn into a dog person overnight. It’s really not that simple if you just don’t like them. And if you’re going to move in, we really need to think about how you’re...”
Or maybe, Draco’s train of thought ominously supplied, he has and he doesn’t want to talk about it. Or think about it. Or have anything to do with Draco or the baby.
Draco nearly snorted. If there were ever two people less suited to a ‘calm, rational discussion’...
Granger, being the unfathomably decent person that she was, hesitated a little. Draco sighed and gave her a small nudge forward. She’d done a lot for him but he couldn’t expect her to hold his hand through this. No, this part...this part he needed to do alone.
Draco woke slowly and groggily, struggling to regain his faculties. He cracked a wary eye open, frowning as he processed his surroundings. He was covered in blankets and lying on a couch that was not his own, in a room that was also not his own. Additionally, he had been divested of his clothing and was clad only his boxers. Those thankfully, were his own.
James drained the rest of his wine and stood up. “I’m going to get some air,” he announced.
Draco’s initial plan to just leave Hugo to his devices ended in massive failure. So there he was, minding his own business and making an entry in his Dream Journal (last night had featured a Hippogriff in a powdered wig, pounding a gavel and sentencing him to six years in Argentina) when the wailing started.
“I learned from the best,” Pot-Harry retorted. He hesitated for a second, as if mulling over something. Draco raised an enquiring eyebrow and then, quick as lightning, Harry pressed a soft kiss to his cheek.
He had nightmares for a week straight.
“We weren’t playing,” Draco protested. “It was an exercise in character building.”
“It was only a vague suspicion at first,” Granger clarified. “When you gave me the book, I didn’t really think much of it. But then I found this.” She rummaged around in her satchel and pulled something out. Draco took it, immediately recognizing it as one of his many pamphlets. “You left it in the book,” Granger went on. “I recognised your handwriting, you had every milestone circled. But I still didn’t realise…”
have listened. I asked you to talk to me.
“Harry, we
Oh no.
“I’m sorry.”
“I know what you’re thinking,” Harry murmurs. “No good comes from dwelling on what can’t be changed.”
Draco sighed and let his head drop back against the chair. Finally. They were alone. He didn’t think he’d ever been this exhausted.
One week in. He’d been to Pomfrey again. Received another batch of potions. Sat through a stern lecture on
and Blaise’s carrots cheerfully proclaimed him a
Speaking from a purely logical standpoint, Draco was fairly certain that he
“What?" Harry's brow furrowed and he glanced up at Draco, nonplussed. "What do you mean by...”
“Are you shagging Potter yet?”
“Professor Slughorn?”
It’s definitely not the answer Draco wants. Patience has never been one of his virtues, not then and
“Wow,” James declared with genuine amazement. “You two are no help at all.”
“And I was wrong. We do have something to talk about, Harry. Us. And...and more. I just...I got scared and I couldn’t find the words but I’m trying now. I need you. Please.”
Potter scrubbed his hair awkwardly. “Well, I was just walking Sasha— like I do, everyday— and I think she took a liking to your bloke over there. Next thing I knew, I was on top of you and you were mumbling about Chihuahuas and I couldn’t just leave you there, so I brought you here and…”
James managed a weak grin at that and curled into Draco’s embrace again. “Love you too,” he replied, stifling a yawn. “Will you be leaving soon?”
Maybe they wouldn’t notice him crouching in the dark?
“...making a spectacle of yourselves like that! A fine example for the younger students, to be sure! You
wouldn’t gawk at a bathroom. Perhaps, this boy needed to associate with a better crowd. Then he wouldn’t embarrass himself by looking so wonder-struck at some silly…
Lily shrugged. “It took you four years to figure out Sirius and Moony were together, you tell me.” Her green eyes lit up speculatively. “You know, if you really want to complain about Draco, I’ll bet Padfoot will join you. He loves bitching about family, you know that.”
“Excuse me?”
“Potter,” Draco cut in firmly, ignoring the obvious look of surprised hurt on Harry’s face. “I apologise for my conduct last night and I understand that you were worried but circumstances were...beyond my control. That’s all I can say.”
don’t have a quill?!”
And Draco...Draco’s heart plummeted.
Draco’s eyes widened and he turned around, just in time to see a bloke on roller blades, waving his arms about frantically and yelling.
He drifted off, with strong arms holding him, a hand gently cradling his stomach and a soft voice whispering promises of the future. There was still one thing left to do though, and he wasn’t putting this off for anything.
Harry’s jaw dropped. “I do not
“I killed him.”
“How I...what?” Draco gaped at her incredulously. “How am I supposed to feel about poisoning? In case it’s unclear, I’m not exactly thrilled.”
Draco thought. Merlin forbid anything that nauseatingly sentimental ever came out of his mouth. He would never live it down. “Treacle tart,” he supplied instead, burrowing into Harry’s warm, strong arms. “Been craving one all day.”
Harry chuckled and padded over, shaking Malfoy’s shoulder. “Dray, wake up,” he murmured softly.
“And you’re called an idiot,” Draco grumbled, putting up a decidedly half-hearted struggle. “Let go of me, you cretin. Your godson is right over there.”
The dark haired boy chuckled. “Apparently,
“Well, if you aren’t the prettiest painting I’ve ever seen,” he drawled, sauntering over to her.
“No,” Draco informed him firmly. “As far as I can tell, everybody wins.”
I won’t do.”

boy who acted first, considered consequences later— if at all.
as they rake the length of Draco’s stiff frame. His tongue darted out to trace the length of a razor-sharp fang and Draco tried,
some ill-advised attempt at irony and his best friend in the world simply didn’t know him at all.
“I’ve been thinking,” Potter went on. His thumbs were stroking now, gliding over Draco’s skin in an almost reassuring way. “I know it’s a lot for you but I would really like to...not avoid you all the time. Not that the other part isn’t fun because oh
was lying unconscious in the Hospital Wing. It’s hardly important. Just a minor inconvenience to you, I’m sure...”
Yes. Yes, he could. Merlin help him, he had to. But damn it if it didn’t still scare the living daylights out of him.
He sauntered off, leaving Draco behind to deal with a deliriously happy toddler.
The last time he did this he was twelve and attending an unspeakably dull formal dinner party at the Manor. Blaise started it, really. There Draco was, just pushing his peas around and minding his own business. Then the blighter flicked his wand and suddenly the peas were rearranging to spell out the word
Pansy rolled her eyes as Theo banged his head against a wall.
Draco laughed, partly out of amusement and partly out of surprise. “Nice to meet you,” he replied, taking the offered hand. “I’m...”
He whirled back to a flabbergasted Harry. “I...I need a quill.”
“Oh,” Lily blurted, coming to a halt right beside him.
There was stunned silence for a second. The bloke gaped at him as if he’d grown a second head. Then he cleared his throat and addressed Draco again. “You want these scones?” he asked. “Because they’re yours?”
Harry looked genuinely worried and it just made the churning in Draco’s gut worse. It was awful. He felt like he was lost at sea and there was nothing to hold on to.
Godric promptly confirmed this by running circles around Helena, apparently inviting her to play.
Harry cracked a smile. “I do love him, you know,” he admitted quietly.
Draco stood there with his boyfriend, Helga gnawing at his shirt, Salazar chewing on his shoe and Rowena angling for his sleeve while Helena and Godric chased each other around the flat. A reluctant smile tugged at his lips because really,
The door opened a crack, allowing him a glimpse inside. Father looked stiff and wary as he handed a wineglass to their guest. The man —
“Malfoy? You’re here early!”
Marina pouted sulkily, flipping her tail at them in a rude gesture.
“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Harry grinned. There was no response from Draco save for a contented hum, so Harry kissed his forehead and settled down beside him. In no time at all he was asleep as well, with Draco curled up securely in his arms.
The sound of his name from Potter’s lips brought Draco back to the present. He cleared his throat and took a small step back, hoisting Teddy back up. “He did,” he answered. Teddy turned to him at once at the sound of his voice and Draco smiled, giving him a gentle bounce. “We read stories, fed the ducks and painted on the terrace. Or rather, we painted
“Please?” Harry implored, with large, pleading eyes. “I’d feel better if you let me make up for assaulting you. Just for a bit?”
“He’s a national treasure! Why they have him in Reserve I’ll never know, he should be front and centre at the…”
“I didn’t either, at first,” Potter replied. “But apparently, they’re very popular with Muggle families. Hermione told me all about them.” His hand was trailing the length of Draco’s arm as he spoke. Draco’s breath hitched in his throat. “They’re like little activity centres and they’re supposed to be great for building motor skills. Teddy’s learning all kinds of things right now. How small tools work and what he can do to make them work.” The hand was moving to the small of his back now and Draco was just barely keeping up with Potter’s words. “He’s learning how textures feel and how to unhook strings and open locks and hinges. It’s great for his development. And my peace of mind.” Draco frowned and Potter gave him a grin. “He runs off with my keys all the time. I can never find them.”
“I can’t count the number of times Harry has said the same, stupid thing to me. And he’s been wrong every single time, I’ll have you know.”
“Yes. About that.” Father spoke up, sounding uncharacteristically hesitant. “I won’t deny that you have proven a valuable ally, Potter. However...”
He raised his fist. Draco laughed as the Snitch buzzed petulantly, firmly ensconced in Harry’s fingers. Harry whooped and pulled the broom up. He drifted into a lazy glide, circling the Pitch a few times before and performing a totally unnecessary loop before heading back to solid ground.
“I take it you and Hugo had a nice day?” he teased, nudging his boyfriend.
Draco gave up and closed his eyes, making himself as comfortable as possible. Well, tomorrow was another day. Sooner or later he
Harry suppressed a chuckle and kissed him again. “I’ll start taking notes.”
“You,” he hisses, shaking with rage. “You
Surely, if he wrote home and explained to his parents that he was sick with Dragonpox, they would come pick him up? They couldn’t
“Must you be so crude, Potter?” Father sneered. “Surely we can discuss these things in a more genteel manner.”
Somehow, he just knew it in his bones. If Harry turned away from him now, they would never fix this. He would never be a part of Draco’s life or the baby’s. And that thought terrified him more than anything else in the world.
Draco grinned and followed without protest. “I’ll sleep late tomorrow,” he replied. “Maybe right here, if things go according to plan.”
His stomach was churning again. He felt dizzy and uncoordinated. Draco took a deep breath again but this time, it only felt like his chest was closing in on itself. Oh gods, no. Not again! He had to say it. He
At least he knew where the baby got it from.
Of course, if they were lucky enough to evade Lucius, it would be something else. Harry would fall prey to his instincts. If nothing else, it would be old age and death. One of them, Draco was bitterly reminded, was very much
Mid sulk however, something changed. Marina looked up with mild interest as the door slid open. Ooh! She eyed the blond with interest. Now here was something to look at. He was a tall boy, lithe with sharp features. His grey eyes reminded her of stormy nights over the sea, and his hair was
Draco sighed heavily and flopped down on his bed. He was alone in the dorms while his classmates took advantage of the fresh air and sunshine. It was just as well — there was very little privacy to be afforded in a room full of almost grown men falling over each other. And the Room of Requirement, for whatever reason, would not make itself available to him without Potter. He had the vaguest sense that the Room had not forgotten — nor forgiven — the incident with the Fiendfyre just yet. There would be a ways to go before anyone or anything in this castle had reason to trust him again. He tried not to dwell on it too much. Still, that left him with very little time and few options and if religiously avoiding polite society got him the solitude he needed, so be it.
inducing…
“Later,” Harry replied firmly, settling down beside him. “But first, you’re taking a nap. You can barely keep your eyes open.” He moved to put his arm around Draco and pull him over before remembering that that was precisely the sort of thing that had kept Draco up last night.
He was still waffling between knocking on Potter’s door and running home and begging off the whole thing entirely when he felt a tap on his shoulder.
“I tried,” Harry cut in. The hurt was bleeding in through his stoic demeanour, he looked agitated and confused and so upset it hurt. From the corner of his eye, Draco could see Granger leaning over discreetly to watch them. “I tried before,” Harry went on. “To listen. I
“Well personally, I prefer the book,” Harry replied. “This is the fourth instalment. It’s getting pretty good actually. See, Tywin Lannister...”
“It’s…” Harry shook his head and laughed. “It’s
— seated across Father was a jarring reminder that it existed, for the right price. A terrible price. He observed the vampire, trying to take a measure of the young man he once was. A human Harry Potter, Draco thinks, would have been softer. His smile would have been large and bright like the sun; not this razor’s edge of a blade. He would have skipped stones across ponds and sprinted in green fields instead of prowling dark alleys and ancient manors. He would have married some fresh-faced farmgirl, fathered a brood of messy-haired children and died in his bed an old, happy man.
Harry winced and dropped his hand at once. “Professor,” he spoke up, sounding quiet but firm. “I realise we handled this...badly and we’re really, really sorry about it. But could Draco and I please have a moment?”
“Weasley,” Draco greeted stiffly, taking several steps back as well.
“Are you ending things?” Potter asked quietly. “That’s what this is, right?”
Draco groaned and clutched his stomach. He felt worse than he ever had before. It felt like his very insides were revolting now. What the hell…?!
“Confident, are you?” he teased gently. His green eyes sparked with mischief and Draco abruptly decided that they were done talking now. He leaned over Harry, clearly intending to pick up where he had left off. And he was doing a pretty good job at it too...
Draco swallowed. His throat felt much too dry all of a sudden.
“Honestly, I’m surprised it took so long,” he replied. “I was expecting this conversation weeks ago.”
James took his time. “It wasn’t supposed to go wrong,” he whispered. “I’ve done the Wronski Feint before.”
Now all he had to do was find Potter.
ran out of those.”
,” Draco intoned in a livid hiss.
“Hey, I’m just doing my duty as an Auror,” Finnigan replied cheekily. “Protect and serve, that’s our motto.”
Those green eyes roved his frame appreciatively and Draco found himself feeling inexplicably bashful all of a sudden. When was the last time someone had looked at him like that? Suddenly, he was very eager to change the subject.
“My scones,” Draco hissed, too overwrought to form coherent sentences by this time. “You took. Give
“Draco Malfoy,” Draco mumbled, swallowing around his scone and taking the offered hand. “Thanks for...for the...”
Draco could live with that. He subsided with a barely there smirk and went back to watching the dogs. Given enough time, he was sure he could convince Potter to keep
the frail, innocent life growing inside him altogether...it was almost unbearable.
going to be Godric.
Draco ignored them all. The only person he could focus on was Harry.
Draco shook his head helplessly. He couldn’t do it. He just couldn’t say it out loud. Why was this so damned difficult? Everytime he tried, he found himself on another roundabout. At this rate, the baby would be here before he broke the news.
Suddenly, his green eyes turned on her. Marina lost her train of thought as she stared into those gorgeous, emerald depths. Oh, but they were perfect! The deep green of the ocean on a calm day. And such dark, long lashes. And his smile was so open and guileless…all thoughts of the blond were promptly driven from Marina’s mind. He wasn’t here, after all. She could look, couldn’t she?
And Harry...looked more lost than ever.
But this thing was odd to say the least.
Then again, who was he to judge? He’d been flying blind since this damned thing started.
“Harry, you can’t do this!” he protested desperately. “Weasley will kill you when he finds out you left his son with me! And believe me, I am not going to stop him.”
It feels so hopeless. No matter what, in the end, he’ll lose the man he...
“What do you say, Teddy Bear?” Potter took the decision out of his hands by turning to Teddy. “Do you want Draco to play with you while I clean up?”
about it like some…”
Draco rolled his eyes. “What, for the one Disarming Spell you know?” A small smile tugged at his lips nevertheless and he turned to watch the cheerful chaos unfold around them. The First Years were having a go at the Jelly-Legs Jinx, taking turns to cast it on each other and then tumbling around with shrieks of laughter. Despite the relative harmlessness of the spell, Draco’s insides clenched with worry. They were just...so tiny.
“What’s Dad’s problem?” he burst out. He’d been simmering in silence ever since his father had all but fled from the table, and Draco had cautiously opted to follow him. Now they were both gone and he just…he didn’t know
“If anyone belongs at Hogwarts, it’s you,” Dad agreed with firm conviction.
Honestly, he would rather die in Herbology.
this.”
Draco flushed again, wishing he could melt off his seat. “It’s been a lousy week,” he explained.
Do you understand?!”
Lily smiled gently and brushed a kiss to his temple. “Oh, sweetheart,” she murmured. “I’m sorry tonight didn’t go the way you wanted.”
“Don’t call him Ginger Junior,” Harry admonished sternly. “He has a name. Don’t you, Hugo?” Draco huffed as Harry smiled gently at the baby and bounced him, much to the toddler’s delight. This right here was what he was talking about. Harry was good with kids.
He knows before he’s crossed the threshold that he’s never coming back.
“Assuming he’s not too busy mooning over a certain Miss Weasley,” Father smirked.
Sasha responded with a rather condescending snort, closing all attempts at further reasoning by picking up the pace. Harry found himself being dragged off, slipping and sliding and careening down the hill as his dog refused to slow down.
Draco shook his head, amazed at his own lack of foresight. He should have known, considering who he was dealing with. A frank conversation was clearly the wrong way to go here and honestly, he should have expected that — when had he and Potter
Draco’s eyes widened as Harry promptly bundled the littlest Weasley into his arms. His grip tightened on instinct and Hugo emitted a small whine of complaint, wriggling dangerously as he tried to make himself comfortable. Draco stared into those guileless blue eyes, absolutely transfixed with horror.
“I’m here,” Harry promised. He sounded solemn and earnest, like he wanted nothing more but to help. “I’m listening, Draco.”
“You two,” McGonagall hissed, sounding utterly livid. “My office.
In fact, most of his fellow Slytherins had taken the coward’s way out and refused to attend altogether. He hadn’t, though. For reasons that remained a mystery to him, Draco felt obligated to return to the school he’d betrayed. And on most days, he didn’t regret his foolhardy decision. With every cautious nod from Longbottom, every awkward almost-a-conversation with the Patil twins, every study group session with Granger and whoever else still cared about their NEWTS at this point, things were slowly sliding back into some semblance of normal. It was...good, against all odds. It was what he needed.
Busted.
It’s a jarring reminder of the distance between them. He curls up in his sheets, ignoring the ache in his chest as Harry pulls on a shirt. The black garment slips over his pale, lean body.
“That’s the spirit!” Theo replied, slapping his back cheerfully. “Now get to work. The sooner Godric buries
The usurper of his dog's affections wagged her tail and bounded over to lick his hand. Draco treated her to an ear scratch too. “Well, at least she’s pretty.”
“Wrist up,” he was instructing, helping an exceptionally tiny Ravenclaw angle her wand. “Eye on the target. And then, swish and flick. Just like practice.”
“Harry?” a small voice chirped suddenly.
“Potter!” Draco announced. “Shall we take a vote?”
Grimmauld Place was a sight these days. Draco emerged from the fireplace, still clutching Teddy like his life depended on it, and took a look around.
“Yeah,” James mumbled. “And… and at Hogwarts.”
And something inside him cracked. He didn’t know if it was the stress of the whole day or seeing his Father’s worried face and knowing he was
been this angry.
“We,” Harry echoed. His eyes drifted to Draco’s stomach. They lit up with quiet, fierce joy and he smiled. “There’s a
“I’m not trying to influence your decision,” Pomfrey said, with a faint smile, “But I thought you’d like to know. That’s about the size of your baby right now.”
“What? No! I mean, maybe. I mean...that’s not even...what are you going on about?”
Marina gasped in sheer delight.
, little Malfoy,” Potter broke in. “By all means, intrude anytime. And remember,” his teeth were stark against the pallor of his skin. Draco wondered what they’d look like clamped around a pulsing throat, “should you need anything during your
away or just the empty, empty space inside him that missed home so much, but whatever the reason, it was suddenly too much. He squeezed his eyes shut as the first of his pent up tears tracked their way down his face.
“Nice name,” Harry replied easily.
It was nearly midnight. There was not a sound in the bedroom save for the soft ticking of the alarm clock on his bedside table. Draco stared at the ceiling, quiet as a church mouse while he waited for Harry’s breathing to deepen.
Although, in all fairness, he probably deserved at least part of the blame for his reputation. In hindsight, he
“Yes,” Draco retorted, crossing his arms and turning his back to Potter. He didn’t want the man to see the flash of hurt in his eyes, this was embarrassing enough.

“He doesn’t
Draco sighed again and scrubbed his tired eyes. He wasn’t even sure if he
“I know you do.”  Father hesitated a moment before speaking up again. “I think we’d better get Dad in for this talk, hm? Can you wait a moment while I fetch him? I’ll be gone for a minute at most.”
“A real classic,” Theo affirmed. “Look at this. Muggle soldiers invading a well-armed fortress knew better than to jump in with their swords out...”
Now it was up to Harry. Harry, who was hovering behind him, still reluctant and put out, but clearly intrigued enough to stay.
“Goodbye, Draco.”
“You can do this,” Granger urged.
Wait,
“Sod off,” Harry groused sullenly.
He didn’t...belong at Hogwarts. He knew that now. He’d felt it in the pit of his stomach as he walked down the Great Hall with a thousand eyes watching him. He felt it even when the Hat sorted him in Gryffindor.  He
“Harry.” Draco squeezed his hands again, bringing his attention back. “We really do need to talk about this. Alone. Can we...”
She regarded him with an almost horrified sort of fascination. “It must be hell inside your head,” she said frankly. He couldn’t say he disagreed.
with it. So long as he can just lie here in bliss and drift off...
Also, he didn’t want to die.
Draco downed the draught with admittedly bad grace. He was quite sure he had never felt this awful in his entire life. The nausea had stayed with him all night — even after he’d gone and disgraced himself in the worst way possible. Oh
Shirts tore and trousers were yanked off roughly. Hands gripped hips and teeth and tongues clashed in a passionate frenzy. Marina watched in awe. They looked so beautiful together. Pale and tan, smooth and toned, lean waists and broad shoulders…ooh, this was brilliant!
“Know it all. You’re just like your mother.”
, but he was coming fairly close. And the sight of Harry standing there with that pleading look on his face and the squirming bundle in his arms was not helping in the least.
Potter’s expression darkened. “I didn’t like that,” he grumbled sullenly. “I wanted to hex Seamus for touching you. And I wanted to hex myself for not telling you how I felt when I had the chance.” He took a step closer, expression intent and determined. “
Neither of them moved an inch. Draco swallowed around the tight lump in his throat. How did he get himself into these messes? Why was it
“You sure I can’t talk you into coming over to the Burrow?” Ron asked as he shrugged into a jacket. “Mum’s making pumpkin pie.”
“You’re so good with Teddy,” Potter murmured. “You love him so much and he adores you and it shows. You’re so
“We do?” Granger blurted.
James’ recklessness was
“Can I?” Granger didn’t even wait for a reply, she just snatched the book up. “This is so going to be my next research paper!” Then she blinked and sat up. “I mean, unless you’re looking into it, of course.”
“Can we please talk?” Draco implored softly.
A second later, said bloke crashed full tilt into him and he went crashing to the ground.
“Hawwy, Hawwy!” Teddy chirped, reaching out for him with his no doubt sticky hands.
“I didn’t sleep a wink all night,” Draco confirmed sulkily, tipping his head back to give Harry better access to his neck.
This time, Potter just looked gobsmacked. “You’re into
“Sounds like fun,” Potter returned with a grin. “But he always has fun with you.”
Draco closed his eyes. His shoulders sagged. This...this could not be happening. Why couldn’t he catch a break just
barged in here! Now quit groping him or you and I are taking this outside!”
needed them more than I did.”
“I’m sorry about what I said to Ron,” he said. “It wasn’t true, I know that now. I...I really like you, Draco.”
“Hey James,” Draco said, hoisting his broom up in greeting. “I’m all set.”
“Now, there’s no need to blame the baby.” Pomfrey gave him a mildly scolding look as she handed him a Stomach Settling Draught. “Nobody forced you to go flying after taking your prenatal potion, did they? If you had just paid attention to...oh, do stop pouting and drink up.”
Harry laughed and kicked off the ground.
A bit harsh perhaps, but it got the job done. James flinched and his grip on the sheets tightened. “Father, please...”
So he was right after all.
Potter, who looked absolutely
Harry exclaimed. A breathy laugh escaped him and he shook his head like he couldn’t quite believe what he was seeing.
Potter let him go, thankfully. It gave Draco a little time to consider his options. As far as internal deliberations go, it was a rather short one.
“The point is, I’m...I think I could. In fact, I’m sure I could. To me, it’s worth it. All of it. Everything.”
Marina grinned and splashed at him, watching approvingly as they turned away and slipped into the tub. Long limbs intertwined and slid over wet, smooth skin. Low, throaty moans filled the silence. Strong hands gripped at broad shoulders and twined into hair….
“And I said I want to work on the Potion! Now
leaving
Salazar, of course!
Potter’s mouth pursed and he held his hands up, making a point of taking a step back. “You know there’s no one here, right?” he went on, still looking put out for some reason. “Sorry for not letting you break something, I guess.”
Granted, he was victim to the occasional fall out like everyone else in the world, but that didn’t mean he deserved to be saddled with the moniker ‘Drama Queen’. Draco did not blow things out of proportion. He did not succumb to hissy fits or the occasional blind rage and he was most certainly not crazy.
Oh, this was going to be a long two hours.
to hear what Potter had to say. This was going to change everything and things were already so confusing. He was only just getting around the idea of being a parent himself and...and maybe it was too complicated. Even for the Boy Who Lived.
He thought he was ready for Hogwarts. He’d been waiting for this his whole life. When he was little, it was all anyone talked about. He grew up on these amazing tales — visions of a wonderful, mysterious castle with secret passages, ghosts and moving staircases, a magical place where his parents had lived, learned and made friends and even found each other. He’d wanted to come here, to
“Yes,” Draco replied flatly. James whimpered pitifully, tearing up again. Draco sighed in defeat and pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead. “But it will pass.”
“I guess we’ll see you and Dean here then,” Potter muttered, addressing an enthusiastic Finnigan.
“I told you I took a break from flying,” Draco mumbled. He swayed slightly and his head came to rest against Harry’s chest. Harry carded a hand through his hair and the Snitch — still locked between his fingers — fluttered unhappily. Draco smiled. “You didn’t open your gift.”
There it was. That was what he had been looking for— an undertone of remorse in that anguished, trembling plea. Draco remained silent as James looked up at him, shaking violently. Despite his anger, his heart ached at the sight.
“You insufferable git!” Potter howled, doing his level best to hoppity-skippety after Draco in the elaborate costume. His bunny ears flopped flaccidly against his forehead. “I’ll kill you, you...”
- the nerve!
Granger gripped his arm. She lowered her voice and leaned in to whisper. “I didn’t tell anyone. I
Thief! Villain! Charlatan!
Sasha thumped her tail and ruffed excitedly, straining on her leash. Harry held tight. His golden lab was usually docile but she was particularly frisky today and Harry couldn’t blame her. However, if he let her off her leash, she would most certainly run off and then Merlin knew Harry would be running through the woods for hours, trying to track her down.
“Harry hates it too! Go figure!”
A comfortable silence fell between them, and it almost surprised him. He hadn’t realised how much he’d needed to talk about it. About all of it. The relief was almost palpable, like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders.
he reminded himself. But it felt like poor comfort at a time like this.
“You could fail every single class and we would still love you,” Father replied without a moment’s hesitation.
Teary, brown eyes stared up at him, tentative and scared. Draco’s throat clenched painfully. “Son,” he whispered gently. “
“What’s his name again?”
“Harry, I…”
Fuck it. Fuck it all.
“Right...now?” That instinctive panic gripped him again and he had to fight to shake it off. The thought of facing Harry again, after this morning, was hard enough. But the man probably didn’t even want to look at him anymore, let alone hear what he had to say.
“You changed,” Draco mumbles. It sounds petulant, but he doesn't care. Harry’s had worse from him. “If you wanted, you could... change me.”
Unfortunately for him, Draco was
Cute.
“I imagine it was all a bit much for the first day,” he murmured.
“Where have you been?” Harry demanded petulantly. “We’ve been waiting ages.”
“They’ll leave us alone long enough to shag,” Draco finished. “Isn’t it wonderful how things just work out all on their own?”
Silence. Harry goes still and Draco braces himself — for what, he doesn’t know. When Harry speaks, his voice is a low growl.
“Oh Merlin.”
You were in the Hospital Wing all night. Weren’t you?”
“I would have made a fine Slytherin, I’ll have you know,” Dad retorted.
are you… what has happened?” Father took a deep breath, clearly trying to compose himself. When he spoke again, he sounded forcibly calmer. “I mean, is everything alright?”
Potter gave him a flat look, but his lips were twitching too. “How about we skip that one for now?” he said dryly, only to be greeted with
“Malfoy?”
“We do!” Finnigan replied. “In fact, I was just talking to Malfoy here...”
“Granger?” Draco intoned with deadly, quiet menace, his eyes still fixed on the taunting peas.
Dad would be in him right now. But he just...he couldn’t help it.
“And I would certainly
The Snitch buzzed eagerly as he withdrew it from his robes. It glinted gold in the moonlight and unfurled its wings.
“Fine,” Draco muttered. “

standard to set for yourself.”
“I was your payment, wasn’t I?”
“Malfoy?”
“Oi!” Weasley spoke up over the din, because why bloody not. The whole table was in an uproar now, openly gawking and whispering among themselves — it was only a matter of time before they all threw their two Knuts in. “What the bloody hell’s going on?”
“Potter it is!” Draco declared. “Now, since we’re all in agreement that the pompous, pretentious, self important
“Look, right now? I just need to know one thing.” Potter’s grip tightened ever so slightly. “Do you really want to end things? With me?” His tongue darted out to dampen his lips and Draco’s breath hitched. “Because I don’t. I like what we have. Don’t you?”
That would explain it.
I wouldn’t do this if I had another choice. Just take him, will you?”
“I can’t.” Draco looked away. His eyes were starting to sting and Salazar help him, if he didn’t get away right now he was going to break down. “I tried, Potter. I did. I’m sorry but I just can’t.”
. It was bad enough being a painting, stuck in a frame all day with precious little to do. But did they have to hang her up in the Prefects Bathroom? She didn’t even have another painting to talk to. Not that she wanted to socialise with
“He is proud of you. He was proud of you
“Thank you. Now no peeking, okay?”
Enough was enough. This incident was the last straw as far as Draco was concerned. He loved his children dearly but he wasn’t blind to their faults.
Granger smiled. “Then you won’t be alone.”
“It’s empty!” Longbottom gasped. “But then, where’s...”
“Is there?” Draco mumbled evasively, fiddling with his torn sleeve. “I...I wouldn’t know.”
“All yours,” the bloke assured him, pulling out a chair. “If you sit down.”
“I didn’t summon you,” Father said, eyes straying towards Potter with visible unease.
“Tell you what,” he said, still petting Albus gently. “Why don’t we go downstairs and say hello?”
Potter’s voice was soft and hopeful and it just stoked Draco’s irritation. He pursed his lips and looked the prat right in the eye as he spoke.
James snorted. Yeah,
Potter grabbed him before he could fall flat on his arse. Draco’s heart lurched as he stumbled and then he was staring into concerned, green eyes.
“Lads,” Weasley greeted suspiciously. “Am I interrupting something?”
So, he sat himself behind him, heart skittering in his chest and looped his arms tight around his middle. “Alright, Potter,” he said. “Let’s do this.”
If Father ever found out... well, he doesn’t know
“I know,” he sighed. A thought struck him and it was painful enough to bring a sting to his eyes. “Is it…is it because Draco’s a man?”
“Please don’t say
He looked a bit awkward and Marina smiled to put him at ease. She flipped her tail in the water and splashed to show she meant no harm. His smile widened and he came closer. “You’re a mermaid,” he said.
Oh. Oh, he wanted to help, did he? Well, Draco would tell him what he thought about
“See?” he said, nudging Hermione’s shoulder. “I told you they’d be fine.”
Draco’s anger evaporated with those two words. He knew James meant it. He knew James was sorry, that he was terrified of what could have come to pass and he knew that all James wanted right now was to be held and told it was okay. That Father loved him and forgave him and he would take care of it. He just didn’t know how to ask for it. He didn’t know if Draco would do that for him after what he’d put his family through.
soaking wet and unconscious…”
Harry huffed and slumped on the couch. He turned big, sad eyes on her and it was all she could do not to take him in her arms and hold him until it was all better. But Harry wasn’t six anymore and this wasn’t a scraped knee or a banged up elbow. She would just have to do her best to be there for him — and give James a piece of her mind later. “You’re his baby boy,” she explained gently. “As far as your Dad’s concerned, nobody could ever be good enough for you. You could have brought home Celestina Warbeck and he’d still find something to complain about.”
Like any good Slytherin, Theo laughed long and hard at his predicament. Nevertheless, after ten minutes of snickering, he rallied to the cause.
James sniffled as he wrapped the wool blanket tight around himself. It felt scratchy against his skin and smelled faintly of pumpkin juice. He wondered if some other Gryffindor had spilled some on it in all the ruckus. When he’d stumbled into his dorm, newly Sorted, stuffed from the Feast and clutching his Transfigured Gryffindor robes and tie, the rest of the boys had already descended on their new living space in a raucous herd. It was only when a tired, cranky Prefect poked his head in and barked at them all to
There was a brief flash of black and green and then Draco collided face first with and extremely solid…chest, he supposed it was a chest. Or a very warm, rather toned brick wall. Either way, it knocked all the breath out of him and then he was flailing and toppling down the hill with the solid chest slash brick wall firmly attached to him.
I meant a real farm!”
Harry had started rubbing his temples. “One more time, Draco. Are you
Suddenly, he’s exhausted. Draco yawns. His eyes flutter shut as Harry sets him back on the bed.
terrace.” The house elves would have a time of getting Teddy’s handiwork off the marble flooring, but he didn’t think they’d mind. They were utterly besotted with him.
It was a cold night. The moon hung bright in the sky. A pleasing breeze rippled through. Harry breathed in the calm and smiled.
“Enjoying yourself, girl?” he asked fondly.
Draco was starting to suspect no one could say
His boyfriend nuzzled into his neck with a contented sigh and his hold on Draco’s waist tightened reflexively. Then he fell still and Draco heaved a sigh of relief.
“And whose fault is
Until he had to go, of course.
.” In a breach of etiquette as horrendous as it is deliberate, he drained the glass in one go. “Now,” he grinned, displaying the barest hint of fang, “who do you need me to kill?”
With that, he turned his attention back to the screen, making a point of ignoring Potter’s upset expression. What did he care anyway if Finnigan was flirting with Draco? Potter had defined their relationship in no uncertain terms, after all. Now apparently, Draco wasn’t allowed to get attention from anyone else either? Of all the...
She almost giggled. Oh, he was shy! She was so accustomed to the blond boy’s brazen confidence. This boy’s awkwardness was almost adorable in contrast. Not that he had any reason to be.
“What?”
Harry stared at his boyfriend with wide, shining eyes. “You never told me any of that,” he said softly. Malfoy managed a sheepish grin and Harry leaned into him. “Come here.”
Draco groaned inwardly and tried to reason with him. If there was even a chance Harry would just go back to sleep without manhandling him again, he would take it. “I’m right here,” he murmured hastily. “Go to sleep, Harry. I’m not going anywhere. I’m just...”
going into Potter’s house alone, he just wasn’t.
but… maybe it could be a second one.
If James could stay out of the sodding Hospital Wing for the rest of the year, he could have it back by Christmas.
A chill went down Draco’s spine. His arms wrapped tighter around his body and he fought down a shudder.
sorry. I didn’t mean to...er, inconvenience you like that. Please forgive me?”
He intended to handle this one on his own and he had his reasons for it.
door is still firmly closed to him. He crept closer, vying for a peek through the keyhole. The voices inside were barely audible but he strained to listen.
“I know, sweetheart.”
. The trouble he caused?
It was like being hit by the Hogwarts Express.
Draco made his way down the corridor to the refurbished classrooms on the fourth floor. He would have thought that after Lockhart’s disastrous attempt at reviving the Duelling Club, anyone with a modicum of sense would discourage overzealous children with wands to fling spells at each other.
Lily waved a hand to shush him. She was trying to keep a straight face, but a stifled laugh escaped her anyway. “Just let it play out, baby,” she told him. “Just…let them go.”
Draco was utterly nonplussed. “I...think it’s bits of Muggle rubbish glued to a board,” he answered frankly. Potter looked even more amused now, and it was starting to annoy him. “The buttons don’t do anything,” Draco protested. “That switch thing doesn’t work. And what are the mirrors for?”
Right, then. First things first, he had to get back on his feet. Then, he was going to kill his dog.
“All better now?” he asked, his voice still hoarse from his exertions. Draco looked up at him and his sleepy, sated expression said it all. Harry chuckled fondly and kissed his forehead. “Go to sleep,” he ordered, pulling the blankets over Draco and tucking him in.
“No, but I have a feeling.”
“So that’s it,” Harry spoke, his voice quivering just a little. “You want to end this. Us.”
James hid in his shoulder again. His voice was small when he finally spoke. “Connor s-said...he said Dad would have done it. He said Dad would’ve taken the bet.”
“It’s getting late,” Harry whispered, even as he tugged Draco over to the sofa.
“Draco Malfoy,” he declared ominously. “Tell me everything.”
. “They might just come in handy.” With that sorted, she gave them all another dazzling smile and proceeded to usher everyone into the dining room, effectively dispelling the awkward silence. “Well, I hope everyone’s built up an appetite! Draco dear, sit anywhere you like. Oh and Harry, be a lamb and fetch me a vase for these
“Beautiful,” Harry murmured. An affable bark from his companion confirmed his statement. Harry chuckled and scratched Sasha’s ears.
“So, Malfoy,” he broke in, when the conversation lulled. “What is it you do exactly?”
“Amateur photography doesn’t pay much but I love it,” Harry explained. “But we can talk about that later. First, let me buy you another coffee, yeah? And then we’ll see about replacing your coat.”
Draco managed a weak chuckle and swept a hand over his eyes. “Like I got chewed up and spat out by a Hippogriff. You?”
“Yes,” Draco muttered. “Later then.”
, she dragged them both to his room by their ears and...well, long story short, neither he nor Blaise had ever dared attempt the spell again.
Harry nodded frantically.
Marina lifted her chin and gave him a defiant look, clearly conveying that she intended to do just that. The blond chuckled. “As you wish,” he shrugged. “You’re not going to stop me.”
“Alright,” Draco sighed, carting him off to what he supposed was the play area. Somehow, he doubted that Potter had invested in intellectually stimulating playthings. Far more likely, he’d just picked out whatever was loudest, brightest or shiniest. Oh, wouldn’t this be fun? “Let’s go see what brain numbing entertainment Potter has in store for us.”
And if he allowed himself to get pulled in by warm smiles and soft touches — far more devastating than the heady rush of hot skin and clever tongues and possessive hands gripping at his thighs — he knew he would be lost. In the light of day, it was just too good to last. He needed to remember that and so did Potter.
“Albus,” he ventured carefully, “are you afraid of the snowman?”
“You’re
“And Neville too,” Finnigan added. “This is going to be so awesome! We’re...”
In one night, he had ruined his entire First Year.
Marina settled down happily.
So he seated himself next to James and lifted a gentle hand to trace his cheek. Thankfully, James didn’t flinch from his touch. “Look at me,” Draco ordered quietly.
“Look, kid. I don’t mean to go after your old man. It’s just…”
“Weasley,” Draco snapped. “I need your plate.”
Granger promptly snatched it up. “No, thank you,” she replied firmly. “I can do it.”
“And...I don’t know how you’re going to feel about it. In truth, I’m terrified about finding out. But you have to know. You just...you have to.”
“You really think I can do this?”
“Sneaky,” he murmured, his lips twitching in a faint smile. “You would’ve made a good Slytherin.”
Draco stared in disbelief. It was exactly what he’d wanted.
James shrugged and picked at the blanket. Somehow, he didn’t think they could make
This ‘getting to know you’ business sounded promising. And if Potter’s mischievous grin was anything to go by, he rather thought he was in for a busy evening himself.

His words tuned in and out. Draco stared at the plate in dead, terror invoking silence. The peas stared right back and sure enough they insolently spelled out
and Dad muttering
. Eager to indulge him, she dove into the water and swam about, showing off her silvery scales and her exceptional swim techniques. He looked visibly impressed; she couldn’t help preening a bit.
“There there,” Harry crooned, stroking it with one careful finger. “You’ll get the hang of it.”
“James.” Father looked utterly stricken by this point. “I...can you please try for me? Can you just tell me what’s wrong?”
“I don’t mean to be rude. But I do need to take a bath and well, could you maybe…”
needed that scone. Perhaps it was foolish, but somehow he just knew that the moment he felt that white chocolate melting in his mouth, with that buttery crunch and the tartness of the raspberry assaulting his senses, it would all be better. All his problems would just disappear. But for that, he needed the scone.
He visibly shuddered at the thought and James couldn’t help a bark of laughter.
Draco snorted and ducked his head. Of course that’s the one they want. One of the first things
It’s better than
Not for the first time, he wondered why he’d allowed himself to fall into this situation with his former nemesis. He’d been seeking normalcy this year, that was why he’d returned to Hogwarts. He’d needed the comfort of the mundane and ordinary. And he knew for a fact that Potter needed the same thing. They’d even managed it the first few weeks. Despite sharing a dorm and several classes, they’d skillfully skirted around each other, never exchanging more than short pleasantries and terse nods.
The growling recommenced, louder and more insistent this time.
Point taken.
His pulse thrums in his ears, somehow both thready and urgently
Draco slunk even further in his chair, if such a thing was possible. McGonagall eyed them both with steely suspicion, but Harry met her gaze frankly.
And that wasn’t even the worst part. The boy was sitting right next to Harry and — despite their laughable attempts to be respectfully discrete — they clearly couldn’t keep their hands off each other. Every time James looked over, they were brushing shoulders or exchanging soft smiles and glances or lacing their fingers together. Harry was clearly besotted by the kid, and as much as he hated to admit it, Malfoy seemed to honestly return the sentiment. It was all kinds of terrible.
“See anything yet?”
When they finally came to rest at the bottom of the hill, Draco’s head was swimming and he was aware of very little save a volley of excited barks and the fact that the chest— and whoever it was attached to— was on top of him and pressing into his face. Draco coughed on some snow and shook himself to clear the ringing in his head.
The blond grinned and tapped her frame as well. “Move along now, little flounder,” he ordered. “We need a little privacy. No peeking, okay?”
set in. “I-I’m going to...don’t come any...”
Wasn’t this supposed to be the easy way?
Malfoy was quick to jump on the offered bone. “The pleasure’s all mine, Mrs. Potter,” he replied, bestowing another smooth,
“I’m getting to it!” Draco snapped. Why did the wanker have to make everything so difficult?!
“I don’t...” Bile rose in his throat. Oh
lilies.”
Draco just sidled closer and tucked his head under Harry’s chin. “We’ll see.”
“Potter, stop being difficult! I’m trying here!” Draco snapped back. He was reaching breaking point, he just knew it. “Do you have one or not?”
And with that, they bolted off, leaving Lily smiling behind them and Harry gaping in the dust.
The mention of the Weaslette made him stiffen but Draco wisely kept up his nonchalant, bored facade. As far as he knew, Potter had called it quits with her the summer before Hogwarts and they’d been on friendly, if somewhat awkward terms ever since. Not that it concerned him. Potter could be friends with whoever he wanted, obviously. If the clueless dolt wanted unhealthy attachment issues with women who wrote terrible poetry and had been obsessed with him since Second Year, that was his business, wasn’t it?
“Why did you do it?” Draco asked once James had calmed down a bit. “Why on earth would you make such a stupid wager?”
“Write to us every day, okay?” Dad put in, even as the flames started to waver. “Owls only.
“Potter…”
“Until next time, little Malfoy,” Potter murmured. The door shut and a lock clicked in place.
“At least your keys are safe,” he told Potter dryly.
giving Harry up — not without a fight. “You’re not him.” He pushes forward, presses his lips against Harry’s. “If you were, I’d be dead.” Harry hesitates. His hands flex against Draco’s hips, as if debating whether to push him away. Draco wraps his legs tight around him, ignoring his exasperated growl. He’s just realised something… and he needs to know.
Harry pursed his lips. “I think you should leave now,” he said firmly. “And you can think about whether this is important enough for you to get along with Godric or not.”
There was room for one top dog in this relationship, and it was
this would happen to him! There was no way he wouldn’t get caught now. The ghosts startled and turned in his general direction, floating mid-air as they peered into the darkness of the alcove.
There. There it was. Draco’s fist clenched. A familiar lump of fear settled in his throat.
Draco’s lip curled. Nothing about this was
Then the creature smiled and raised his glass. “But that would ruin a perfectly good business relationship, wouldn’t it?
“If it helps your decision,” Father spoke up, “your brothers are still playing the screaming game.”
“Draco.”
Draco’s smile flickered and his hands reached up to grab Harry’s robes. “Just watch.”
James nearly stumbled. He paled rapidly and ducked into the nearest alcove, his heart pounding in his chest. Oh Merlin,
couldn’t say it! Instinctively, he turned to Granger for support, only to find her on her feet, furiously mouthing ‘
“Malfoy?” Granger whispered uncertainly. Her hand squeezed his arm carefully. “Are you…”
There’s silence and he wonders if Harry left already. But then a soft voice brushes his ear.
“Get out of my way,” Harry growled.
“I’ll give you a hundred galleons if you promise not to finish that sentence.”
“I’m fine, Molly,” he promised, trying to extricate himself from her maternal attentions. “How’s the family?”
Pomfrey was reluctant to let him go; she was of the mind that he needed more rest. Still, well-intentioned as that was, even he knew that staring at the Infirmary ceiling for the rest of the school year was not a sustainable way forward. And as much as he wanted to, he couldn’t miss his classes. Not if he wanted to graduate in time.
going to have to be the brave one. Tell him. He needs to know.”
,” he managed.
to tell Harry. And despite what Pomfrey said, it was becoming increasingly clear to him that he was going to do this by himself. That’s just how it was. And frankly, after last night, the thought of even
“Potter.”
And if he simply... forgot the Locking Charm he put up every night before going to bed? Well, no one could fault him for being a little scatter-brained.
“Potter!” Draco protested, but the damage was done. Teddy gazed up at him with a gummy smile and bright eyes and all his protestations died in his throat. Draco sighed, smiled at him and nodded, then gave Potter the reproachful glare he rightly deserved. “You’re impossible.”
“We’re fine,” he replied at once, squeezing Harry’s hands in turn. “I promise. Believe me, we’ve dealt with worse.”
James nodded his acquiescence and settled back in Draco’s shoulder. He felt small in Draco’s arms all of a sudden— young and frail with his bandaged ribs and a bruise under his eye. Draco tightened his grip as a surge of protectiveness threatened to overwhelm him.
Draco raised an eyebrow, inviting him to continue.
“I wanted Dad to be p-proud of me.”
Harry laughed and pulled him in for a kiss. “I’m very proud of you,” he told Draco, nuzzling his hair affectionately. “I don’t suppose you’d want to do it again sometime? Hermione has a long week ahead at the office and Ron’s going to be out late too so maybe we could watch Hugo together?”
. No court will convict me!”
“I see you’re both entertaining yourselves just fine,” an amused voice spoke up behind him. Draco startled and turned around, giving Teddy ample opportunity to squeeze in around him and seize control of the board. Potter just grinned at the sight, still towelling off his wet hair.
Silence. As expected. To Lucius’s credit, he looks pained. Maybe, in his own way, he does care. It’s not enough, though. Harry’s been around a long time. He knows a mercenary when he sees one.
