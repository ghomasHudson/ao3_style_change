“Well Potter,” Pansy said, resheathing her own wand, “You’ve never saved me, so I guess this means you owe me now.”
They both looked over at him, along with everyone in hearing distance. Pansy leaned around Terry Boot who was sitting next to Harry. "You can't be serious," she said to Harry. "Do not do this here, take them to the hallway at least!"
Harry looked down at his faded Canons t-shirt, dark jeans, and red sneakers. When he looked back up Draco had already started through the entrance and down the street. Harry hurried to catch up with him. "Where did you learn the term grunge?"
I hope you like it!
They were kissing.
“Draco, are you in here?” the question came from just outside the door. Harry held his breath, eyes flitting between Draco and the, thankfully, still closed door.
"Hey," Neville said, gripping Blaise by the hip and pressing a soft kiss to his lips. "I'll be in the greenhouses today after 6th period. Join me?"
"Don't worry," Draco said easily, "after the glowing review you gave about me to the Wizengamot, I'm the only Malfoy allowed to make decisions about money or property. Father doesn't have the power to fight this, only I have that power."
“You know, you can go ahead without me.” Harry says, stepping out of the bathroom. “I’m going straight there so I have plenty of time.” Droplets of water spill from his wet hair and run down, over his abdomen and the V of his hips, to the towel cinched around his waist.
“I did get you a gift to make up for my absence though. Have you heard of the Gemini service?”
"Ready for your dressing room?" the clerk asked, addressing Harry. Though his eyes kept drifting to Draco as he awaited the answer. Not that Harry could blame him.
In the hallway, Pansy smacked him on the arm, "What the fuck Potter?"
"To behave myself so we didn't mess up the schedule," Harry managed, arching his body into Draco's, drinking in the smell of creamsicle. "I can't help it. I had to touch you."
He gave a moment's thought to Pansy then. He knew she was looking forward to the safe haven of her room for this school year, she'd made that pretty clear. He couldn't imagine how she would react to this news.
Late that night, once all the boys were in their room, Blaise struck again. First, he waited until Potter was changing for bed.
Lucius froze in front of the fireplace, staring at Harry "Potter," he said coldly.
Harry looked at Draco properly then. When the door had opened Harry had only been able to see Draco's heated eyes, the way his lips curved. Now, looking at him, Harry could see that his hair is naturally messy instead of on purpose, and his feet were bare, and Harry wanted more. More time. More mornings. More nights. More Draco. He surged forward, burying his nose in the soft pale-blonde curls above Draco's prick, and breathing in the musky smell of him. Leaning back, he wrapped a hand around the base of Draco's cock -there's no way he could fit all of it in his mouth- and licked the tip.
"It's not really an easy question to answer," Harry admits, pulling Draco towards him, seeking a kiss.
"She's accusing both of you," McGonagall said dismissively, "and you have done wandless magic before. I don't think that will work."
Emily's eyes darkened and Draco took a step back. She really did remind him of Granger. "You’re not a homophobe are you?"
The next morning, Harry tried to focus on unpacking, but his mind kept recalling the sounds of last night. He ran a hand through his mess of dark hair and sighed heavily.
"I have it on good authority that The Weasel is bringing flowers to his or her partner today," Draco says in a low voice. "I wanted you to have something more extravagant than his dozen roses in case you want to make him jealous."
"Perfect."
Pansy lifted a green apple out of her bag and tossed it at him. Harry caught it and gave a small smile.
Harry nodded, shooting a finite at the last bat in the room.
Harry and Pansy both turned to stare at her. Not to be discouraged, Hermione said, "Let's just talk about it. I think it could help. How would you go about seducing him?"
"Malfoy," Potter said, an easy smile on his lips. "I just- it's still early. And you only have me to help until Sunday when I have plans at the burrow."
Draco turned the corner and stopped short before he collided with Potter, who had been walking down the corridor that would take him to the Great Hall. They both stopped and looked at each other wearily, close enough to shove, but not for anything more intimate.
Ginny, who was sprawled out on Seamus' bed, jumped up when she heard his voice. "Harry."
Pansy's eyes went so dark that Harry shut his mouth. Maybe he didn't have much self preservation, but he had enough to stop talking in that moment.
"Potter, there's no way you can afford me. Not only am I expensive, I would charge you at least three times my going rate."
Hermione's eyes glowed with pride, "Oh Harry, that's wonderful!" she turned to Ron, "We can all be there together."
Scorpius chuckled but quickly turned it into a cough when he got
Hermione stood from her chair and regarded Draco warily as he approached. Draco stopped a few feet from the table and met her eye.
Potter cocked an eyebrow, “What about my room?”
Then she bore down on him.
Draco stepped forward, looping the tie around Harry's neck. "Do you have a girlfriend, Harry?"
McGonagall, the saint, took pity on him. She cleared her throat, drawing the attention of everyone in the room. "Narcissa, thank you for coming," she said, "Would you like some tea?"
Draco ran his fingers across Harry's jaw, listening to the boy practically purr. Tilting his head he leaned in letting his lips brush against Potter’s. "How long?" he asked.
Harry stepped closer so he was crowding the man against the wall, not quite touching him. "I've always been that way. I once set a snake free at the zoo."
Draco closed his eyes, straining to grasp the frayed edges of his sanity. He needed Potter to stop saying
Harry looked her over and said, "All right. I have a few. You first."
Draco stared at her for a moment, rolled his eyes, and turned to Blaise. "Translate," he said.
“Yeah, I need to be along,” she said. Then turned to Draco, “Glad I was here when you came, feel free to have the tea he was making for me. I ran out of time to drink it. See you at school I’m sure.”
"Something you would like to tell me, Potter?"
Harry shrugged. "It's not my fault we're bonded. Any word from Slughorn?"
I'm sorry this took me FOREVER to write. I hope all of you are pleased with the ending. I loved this story and it was so fun to put together.
-Ask him on a date
"Yeah, obviously," Harry said, rolling his eyes.
"Yes!"
"What could you possibly know about any type of sexual act," the words came from Harry's mouth before he even completed the thought. He wasn't sorry though.
"You read romance novels?" Draco asked, not able to cover his surprise.
Harry stepped toward her, placing a gentle hand on her arm, "Against anything," he said in a voice both quiet and fierce.
“No,” Neville said, “It wasn’t that, so much as it was the war. At least that’s what Luna and I think.”
"Yeah, I guess you're right. It will be different," he said. Then reluctantly added, "I'm not going to be here next week. I have," he ran his hand over the back of his neck, "some stuff to do."
Draco didn't blush, but Blaise wasn't expecting him to. They'd spent hours training together on ways to control their expressions. It was a common Slytherin pass time. Blaise knew the other signs to look for, the way Draco's eyes narrowed, the tips of his ears going pink, his clipped tone.
"Harry... mate...." Ron said slowly, "what's going on here?"
"I'm sure my friends would have plenty to say about that." Harry bit his lip, afraid that his response would mess up the tentative peace they'd seemed to reach. "They might have heard your name a few times here and there while we were at Hogwarts."
Blaise snapped his fingers in Draco's distracted line of sight. "Oi. Pay attention."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah," Ron said, his smug tone causing Harry to look back up, "that's what I thought. Like I said,
At least the birthday party is held on somewhat neutral ground because Draco knows the Golden Trio will be in attendance, along with a pack of Weasley’s. Even with the apprehension, he’s masking he knows he’s made the right decision about coming back home when Teddy insists on showing Draco every single toy in his room, sharing cake with him, and eventually, crashing from the sugar, in Draco’s arms on the plush sofa in the drawing-room.
Potter's brows furrowed. He looked through the window of the coffee shop at Nora, the barista that Draco talked to several times a week. When she saw Draco she smiled and gave a little wave of her fingers, saying hello. Draco managed a small smile back.
Draco looked up to meet his eye and asked, "You won't try to make this more serious?"
Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, when the sales clerk started talking again. "All right hun, I'm taking this stuff to the dressing room," he motioned to a multi tiered table displaying, what appeared to be, every tie ever made. At least, that's how it felt when the clerk said, "All you need to do is choose a tie."
“So this is just some long lost family that your Dad decided to contact?” Natalie’s question came casually through the headphones. They were playing Tekken Tag Tournament 2 online, Natalie was far better at the game, and she was currently playing her favorite character, Devil Jin. Astrid tried to focus, tried to get her fingers to move fast enough to block and kick at the same time. She briefly entertained the idea of blaming the character, Asuka Kazama, for her failings, but she’d watched plenty of people kick ass with her on YouTube.
Potter's narrowed eyes did nothing but boost his mood as he left the room.
"I'm sorry," Harry said, scrubbing at his face to try and wake up a bit. "I haven't been getting much sleep."
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter cast longing looks at the display case before telling Draco, “I’m going to stop in here and use the loo. Be right back.”
When neither of them responded Pompfrey sighed, "I'm sorry gentleman. Just know it won't last forever. You can stay in here until class is over."
Potter, who had flat out refused to give Draco a moment alone with anyone, nodded. "He's right George," Potter said, "show him the room."
settled! He hadn’t even taken the time to think much about it since the party two nights ago.
Hermione narrows her eyes. "You smell like Draco."
He walked back into the hall, turning left and heading up a slim staircase. Neville's Grandmother had picked the church, and, apparently, it was rumored to be the place King Arthur had gotten married.
to see the time.
He’s been in England for less than 24 hours before stepping into the foyer of Grimmauld place, careful not to disturb the curtains covering Great Aunt Walburga's portrait. He knew Potter signed over this place to Andromeda while Draco was still in lockdown. Potter told her that he wanted her to have a nice place to raise Teddy and had spent the summer remodeling the ancestral home for them.
Say hi @dracos.tealsuit
"Sorry, um… I'm not looking for a ride," Harry said, "which flat number are you looking for?"
“Wrong impression,” Lucius repeated the words as though Harry wasn’t saying them in the right order.
I think the next update will be this weekend, now that I'm over my brain freezing up on this chapter!
"I don't know, I guess," he paused, "I guess I never thought about him going on trial. I know he did a lot of shit but, I would have done anything to protect my family from Voldemort. He was basically a hostage at the end."
"Should have given me notice before it got serious," Harry says, "I would have snagged one more night with you.” He wouldn't have though, not if Charlie was falling for the bloke. Harry doesn’t have a lot of lines, hasn’t for a while now, but he would never come between two people falling in love.
Draco's lips broke into a grin, "You're offering to lie to me then?"
The conversation with Harry lingers in Hermione's mind while she's getting ready. She didn't tell him about the plan. That would have been too much to ask, Harry is terrible with secrets. Instead she had just stated that she had been asked to dinner by Draco Malfoy.
“You idiot,” Draco said, pitching his voice low in hopes that Potter couldn’t hear him.
"Hey," he said softly, slipping a finger under her chin to lift it. She looked up at him and he realized he was easily a head taller than her. "What's up?"
"Isn't that what we both want?"
Draco's grey eyes seemed to assess Harry for a moment, then he gave a small nod.
They both stood from the table, Draco backing up with Potter advancing on him. “No,” Draco said, flicking his wrist to cast a wandless trip jinx.
"Oh, thank you," Draco said, running a hand through his hair. "I can't at the moment. The lions went to play Quidditch so I have the room to myself." He motioned to the empty beds. "I'm going to have a breakdown and then a shower before dinner."
Future chapters will be longer, just so you know :)
"Malfoy," Ron said with a smile, "that's the best idea you've ever had. I've been waiting years for someone to ask me that!"
Harry laughed at that and felt the tension relax. Indeed he had seen her, and it would take a stronger man - or a gay man - than any Harry knew to turn down the opportunity. "So you're happy?" he asked.
Pansy crossed her arms and leaned against a wall, "Obviously, Savior. You owe me. To your gryffindor mind it's going to feel a lot more like exploitation than anything else."
On Monday Harry woke up. He couldn't get his mind to be quiet.
Loire had been looking at the plans that were sprawled out on the floor. She looked up at Harry and lifted an inquiring eyebrow.
With Pansy’s penchant for gossip Hermione knew that Malfoy wasn’t holding the same grudges he had in his youth, that he was living with her, that he was single, and that he was dedicated to restoring his place in wizarding society. It was plenty to work with. Perhaps a compliment will warm him up.
He heard Draco's voice through the wood, "How long are you staying?"
“Because we’re taking it back to mine,” Potter said in a tone uncomfortably similar to the one the clerk had used.
"Shut up, Ernie," Hermione said.
"Here," she said, writing something on his right forearm. "Go to this website and educate yourself. Type in Harry Potter for the fandom and Draco/Harry in relationships. Actually, use their last names too. You'll get better results."
"Yeah. Are you?"
..... More pleasure tweaking themes coming later 😘
Blaise reinforced his Occlumancy walls and pointed a finger at Potter. “You stay out of this.”
Harry wasn't sure but he flashed a smile just in case. Sighing, Draco pulled his wand from nowhere, or at least Harry couldn't see where he'd had it, and cast a memory modification charm at the Muggle. The man lifted himself off the wall seeming to come out of a daze. He smiled lazily at Draco, handed him $100 and went down the stairs.
"We fought on different sides, yes, and it was terrible. The war was terrible and people close to me died. Draco and I found each other well after the war and we made peace a long time ago," he said. Then, after a moment, he added, "Even during the war he saved my life, though don't tell him I said that. He won't back me up, he'll just claim selfish motives."
~~~💕~~~💕~~~
"Ready to get married?" Harry asked.
Outraged, Harry made to stand but stopped himself when he felt Draco's hand in his forearm. Instead, he leaned back in his seat and stared at the floor.
The next day, in the common room, Potter led Neville to a couch near where Blaise was studying. He fished through his school bag and pulled out a package of sugar quills.
-you never answered my question
Harry spent the rest of the walk putting up a valiant effort to ignore the curve of Draco's ass. He failed.
and the jets turn on.
felt better and then burst out laughing at the absurdity of the conversation. Pansy wasn’t sexist, she just liked fashion and Hermione seemed to be one of her favorite projects.
"Your parents, the Press, Hogwarts, The Wizarding World at large-" she was cut off when Draco pushed her hands apart.
“No,” Potter replied, “I don’t actually think that would help. I want to go and make new memories. Tomorrow, Ron is coming and we will go to Godric’s Hollow. Until then, I just want to get drunk and be with Draco.”
Draco sat back down and gave her a short nod, he had more dire arguments to engage with her this morning than her name. Macmillan sat down next to him. Draco didn’t really want him here but there was no tactful way to get rid of him since he was in his last week of training. During the last week of training, all Unspeakables shadowed Hermione.
"I don't have your wand on me," Harry said, pulling out his own. "You can use mine," he added, handing over the holy wand.
Weasley shook his head no, "It's Friday, I'm happy to take a half-day. I'll see you at the burrow Sunday night."
It turned out that
were more visible. Harry had tried several times to talk to Draco about them, but each time he was shot down. He'd apologized over and over, while Draco countered with things like, "I stepped on your face," "I was plotting a murder," and finally, "Luna says they make me look sexy."
“Draco-”
Narcissa stopped walking as did Draco, who had been keeping perfectly in step with her. She turned to fully face Harry, and he stopped as well. Fighting to not cross his arms defensively, he leaned his back against the stone wall and kept his hands in his pockets.
. That wasn’t- it wasn’t anything really. “That wasn’t hot,” Draco said, oddly surprised. With all of the accurate guesses he’d found in fanfiction he was pleased to know they hadn’t come up with something so personal as a kink.
: Muggle Assignment
Pansy took a deep breath and leaned back slightly, splaying her hands across the wood of Hermione’s desk, in a clear attempt to steel herself for the upcoming conversation, and said, “If you’re going to ask Draco to dinner then you need to wear something that doesn’t make you look homeless. And I don’t mean for the date, you can’t be dressed like this when you ask him either.”
“Is he cute?”
“Time for you to leave.” Draco said, pressing his wand forward until the man had taken a few steps back.
Harry narrowed his eyes and said, very quietly, "What are you, early twenties? We are only a couple years younger than you. Are you projecting?"
Hermione smiled sweetly, "You're absolutely right, Harry. Draco was up to something." She looked up at Pansy, "Let's do an experiment, Pansy can you tell me what the name Draco means?" she asked, her voice dripping with false innocence.
-bang out three more clients with his wonder cock. Two nights. 3 clients.
Draco hooks a finger under Potter's chin and tips his face up so Potter's looking up at him. "Shut up, Potter."
- cum in your mouth,” he says, then moans the name, “Harry.”
Draco glanced up at the sweater before turning to give Blaise a playful smile. "You can't reach it?"
“Are you trying to hire me in every way you can think of,” lick, “that doesn’t involve paying for a shag?”
-Make jokes.
Harry stared at her, unsure of how to respond. He couldn’t tell if she was really trying to tell him something or trick him into spilling his own feelings.
"I-" he tried, and then closed his mouth and swallowed against a dry throat. "How…" he trailed off.
Harry felt confused, he'd thought they were just bantering, but her tone indicated something more serious. He watched as she pulled a piece of parchment from her robes and handed it to him.
"What are you worried about Malfoy?" Potter asked in a low voice, standing much closer to Draco than he had been. "Afraid I'll embarass you in front of your girlfriend."
Just once, he would like to run into Draco when he didn't look so well put together.
"So is Draco," Pansy said.
They pushed through the door at Grimmauld place at 3pm that afternoon. Harry was carrying a birdcage, food, and a bag full of too many bird toys. Draco followed him in with Pax, the baby Merlin Falcon, who had refused to leave the warmth of his arms.
when he told her about you
Harry, feeling more awkward than he ever had in his life, cleared his throat and took a sip of tea.
Both boys plunged under the water, not wanting to get hit with any stray magic. Teddy had shut the jets off before he'd sent his Patronus to get help. It was quiet under the water and they could hear the clear sound of the spell.
“Isn’t his case-closed record the highest in the auror department?”
Draco heads down the hallway and turns the corner, "I'm sorry but we're-" the words die in his throat.
"I told you, you have to take that up with Hermione."
She searched his face before asking, “Do you know for sure that you find women attractive?”
“Thank you. Your tip about the pictures helped.”
, the Savior, the Chosen one, the boy-”
"You're no fun Harry," George said.
Daphne, who was looking at him carefully, said softly, "I'm not sure he was out to himself."
Potter looked up, blinking several times, and then started to laugh. “Thanks,” he said. “This will be the first time I’m with Draco that you won't have to hear my thoughts on it.”
Pansy offered him a smile and said, “We can just pretend that I picked the flowers at random if it would be easier for you, Potter.”
"If you wanted to say something in French to seduce someone," Blaise started. Neville's eyebrows raised so high they nearly met his hairline. Blaise gave him a quick wink before continuing, "what's the hottest thing you could say?"
Draco folds his arms across his chest. "Do you understand what I'm going to have to do to pull off a fake relationship with Granger?"
and the door opened.
“Oh and Malfoy?” Boot said, a cruel smirk tilting his lips, “I took the liberty of sending your outfit for the night. It’s already owled to your flat, along with the credentials and your cover story.”
After being roughly handled for an hour by Theo Nott, who didn't even say hello, Harry shrank down the rest of his outfits to fit in one bag and headed towards the door. Before walking out he caught sight of his reflection, the outfit wasn't that different than his normal, denims a t-shirt, and a jacket. It was the cut of them, the way they fit his body like a second skin, showed off his muscle, the on purpose messiness, and the black eyeliner Theo had spelled on. The only part of him that looked the same was his hair, which Theo had simply given up on, after shoving a bottle of Sleekeazy's into Harry's hand and telling him to deal with it himself. Looking at his reflection, Harry could see the appeal of Pansy's clothes. They certainly drew the eye to his best assets.
"Mione," Astoria cut in, dispelling whatever retort Hermione had planned. "What about this one?"
Once Draco is topless, Harry can't think at all. The lean, pale, whipcord muscles, are all he can see. Tattoos start at Draco's shoulders and spill down his body, decorating his arms, his chest, and Harry suspects there are some on his back.
"What else do you need to know?" Potter asked, moving next to Draco so he could see the list.
"Oh, I'm Potter again? What happened to Harry?"
"What do you want?" Draco asked.
He tried to slip through the door but Neville put out a hand to stop him. "Hey, are you all right? You look like you might not be feeling well."
he thought, breathing in the scent,
Charlie chuckles, the rumbling sound coming from deep in his chest. “He’s not my date, Harry, he’s my boyfriend.”
Harry sank further into his chair. From the corner of his eye, he saw Draco's fingers tighten their grip around the arms of his chair.
"It only took her one conversation, Potter? " Draco said, amused.
I'm a little bit addicted to it...
Pansy smirked, "I put galleons on them in 5th year. I have a standing bet with Theo that those two will hook up."
"Mother of Merlin," Draco whispered. The low lit room was filled with toys, lube, leather, and erotica story-spells.
"Ok. That's weird. Whatever. Go on."
The man reached out and put his hand against the door to stop it from closing. “Not so fast,” he all but growled the words. “Look,” he said, and waved to the car. “My daughter just got a letter from Hogwarts and we need to talk to Harry about it.”
"We work together. What would you prefer? Mr. Malfoy?"
"You're not planning to go clubbing after meeting with us, are you? You know how I feel about these one-offs your having. Sex is not therapy, Harry."
This one struck her solar plexus.
"Yeah, Hermione's got it. Everything is set. I'm going to ask him at Madam Malkins when we return the robes for your wedding."
It was the neighbor, the wallbanger. That voice! It seemed to filter through more than the wall, snagging not only at Harry’s memory, but swirling down into a pool of lust that Harry couldn’t deny. He told himself it was natural, most people hearing sex live would get turned on. When you add on the bloke’s seductive voice it was inevitable, this guy could read Molly’s recipes and it would sound hot.
Harry shrugged, "Yeah, I-" he was cut off when someone spoke from around the corner in the hall.
Draco held the small velvet box over the ice cream case and Anna grabbed it eagerly. She popped it into her apron and gave Draco a wink. "Don't worry, it's in good hands."
Hermione’s eyes narrowed. “No quips? You’re just going to give in?” She leaned closer and said, “Are you feeling alright?”
"How do you think I felt?" Harry asked. "I found out they were- whatever they are- during a negotiation for sexual favors between her and Hermione!"
sounded in that posh accent. “French,” was all he managed to say.
“I mean that,” Potter says and Draco feels a warmth thrum through his body.
Harry filled his cup of tea and started cooking breakfast. Once he was full and the kitchen was clean he read the letter again and fire called Ron.
Harry slowed his pace, standing just out of view to listen in. He'd never quite kicked the habit of eavesdropping. Hermione said he'd picked it up at the Dursley's and had it reinforced during the war.
“Of course. We’ve been friends since we were 3 years old.”
Malfoy's hand twitched so violently that his water cup tipped and spilled over the edge of the table, and into his lap. "Fuck."
Harry cast a considering look at Draco as they walked, noticing the way his jaw tensed when the Weasley shop came into view. "So, is it just Luna then?" Harry asked.
"Oh, um-" Harry swallowed, his mind drifting back to first year, to the graveyard, to the sound of his mother screaming. "It was my parents. I was with my parents," he said quietly.
Draco handed over the Unspeakable's credit card that he had received after his first 90 days with the department. He'd only used the card twice since then. After ringing him up, the clerk handed him a white paper bag. Draco stared at it, confused.
“Good,” Harry choked out, “the shirt looks good on you,” he finished, watching Draco move closer to him until his chest was nearly touching Harry’s back.
else. "Do either of you have any advice?"
Draco pulls back. "Paid for?" he asks, completely lost when Potter chuckles at the question.
~~~💕~~~💕~~~
“Gentleman,” McGonagall said, causing both of them to stop and look at her. “I hope you each gained something from this experience. Thank you for your patience while waiting for the antidote.”
"Yes, Pansy has been telling me all sorts of things about Hermione's theories."
"Yes, of course. That's one of the reasons these falcons are so prized," Draco replied. He leaned back in his chair, a tiny bird nuzzled into his arm.
Finished with setup for the shop, she pulled out her phone to scroll through Tumblr. Her latest piece, a picture of Draco and Harry sharing an ice cream cone together, was getting a lot of attention. One of her friends had even offered to write a one-shot companion story for it.
“If you’re asking me that, you haven’t had enough!” Seamus grabs his wrist pulling him into the back.
"Jamie," Teddy's bright eyes looked up then, full of hope and moonlight. "I-"
Harry chuckled, a deep rumbling sound that filled the space between them, "Well that may have been the perspective," he replied. Then, his eyes turning serious, he said, "Draco and I haven't argued about the war in a very long time. Why did you ask about that?"
Loire looked him over, "Is there a reason you're late?"
Harry's body jerked and he whined, pulling his wrists against the rope, "
"You can feel this too right?"
Draco didn’t even bother to look up from the letter he was reading, “Potter,” he said, “is this actually a pile of fan mail you have here?” He set the letter down and pulled forward another one.
Harry stayed quiet for a moment, pulling Draco closer. "I don't really know, I don't have anything to compare it to, honestly."
Or maybe Draco was testing him.
He should come with a fucking warning label.
“Oh,” Neville’s voice was a whisper. Harry looked up at him as Neville said, “I’m so sorry Harry. What are you going to do?”
"Ugh," Ron tossed himself sideways to lay on the floor with his head in Hermione's lap, "don't remind me."
Blaise’s smile faltered before he took a deep breath and said quietly, “Come on through Harry,” and moved back from the fire.
Draco leaned in and bit him in on the nape of his neck before whispering, "Summon the lube."
"I work at the ice cream shop."
was the word Headmistress McGonagall had used -eyes narrow and lips pulled tight in a grim line- when Blaise and Potter had explained the rooming situation after waking up in infirmary.
Harry was going to have a field day with this.
Pansy narrows her eyes and leans forward, her short black hair brushing her jawline from the movement. "I know exactly what kind of kissing Draco is capable of," she replies, her voice low and nothing short of threatening. She points a finger at him. "Hermione Granger is far too smart for you, Potter. She's going to figure this out and if she cries one tear over either of you I will make you regret it."
Hermione POV
He went in late in the day, filed the rest of the reports for the case and cleaned off his desk. During a late lunch he showered and changed into his favorite pair of denims -tight and flattering- and a black t-shirt with a golden snitch painted across the chest.
Ron blushed, shot a quick glance at Hermione through the window, and looked back at Harry.
"Merlin, we are fucked!"
“Merlin, Harry, you do. The way you move. You take me all the way,” Draco replied, gripping Harry’s hips to encourage the way they were rolling against his erection. “Stay with me?” he whispered.
“Harry, I stood up to you in first year.”
"Don’t worry,” Draco replied, and Harry could hear the fond affection in his voice, “he knows what he’s doing. Just try to follow his lead and this will get worked out.”
"I was trying to let you down easy, actually. Remind you, yet again, that you are trying to get involved with a death eater," Draco said between kisses, "but my body seems to be confused about the plan."
close. Close enough that his breath puffed out against Draco's lips, smelling of sweet apple. Potter's impossibly green eyes sparked bright with amusement and
Harry's smile widened, "You mean Harry?"
"Likes muggles now? Thankful the Dark Lord lost? Gives to charities?"
“Morning Pi,” she said, walking close to the foot of his bed.
Blaise chuckled, "Both of them," he said, looking over to the mat where Pansy and Draco were finishing their duel.
Astrid had been assured by both Draco and Harry that her grandparents would come to no harm at the party and that they would be allowed to leave quickly after dinner. She knew Narcissa Malfoy was trying to be gracious in inviting them, and she hoped their interactions wouldn’t be too uncomfortable. Her grandparents didn’t like to talk about Astrid’s new school, or magic, or Harry, or anything even remotely related to those three topics. Astrid hadn’t really cared, her Dad had always been guarded about his parents and she was never really alone with them. She knew that he didn’t want them to influence her decisions.
"Will she be joining you back at the flat? I can stay out late if you want."
Once Seamus spots Dean he abandons Harry to focus his efforts on his favorite target. Harry watches them for a moment, hoping tonight is the night that Dean finally realizes Seamus is serious when he asks to be taken home. His eyes drift down the bar and he spots a friendly face. He steps into the throng of writhing bodies to cross the room and reach Charlie Weasley.
Long pale fingers stole the postcard from Harry's hands. He looked up to find Draco's smirk filling his field of vision.
Leaving Pansy’s studio, Harry decided to walk home instead of apparate. Thinking back over the last 8 weeks he couldn’t help but feel they had flown by. His project with Luna and her father had come to an end, he had several dinners with Hermione and Ron, more than one memorable night at the leaky with his renovation team, and several hours of time spent with a growing kitten purring away on his chest.
"Don't look at me. I won't help you," Daphne said, raising her hands. "This woman is feral. If I get on her bad side she might never kiss me again."
"You saw Malfoy?" Harry asked, "Why didn't you say anything?"
He smiled then, taking back his drink, "I didn't really know how to tell you. Hermione just brought her home one night."
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. “I want to know what you and Blaise are doing.”
Harry sat in a hardback chair at the only table in the common room. Charms text and parchment spread out before him while he answered the final questions for his homework. Hermione, who had already finished her homework, sat next to him writing a letter.
"If I may," Lucius' steel voice cut in and Kingsley turned to him. "As part of my sentence, the auror department has asked me to give over any information concerning supporters of the Dark Lord. I do have some information regarding Delores that might help you in your cause."
“Yes, I will take him,” Draco said, glancing briefly at Harry.
His frantic thoughts spun through his mind.
Harry pulled off with a lick and kiss at the tip of his cock and then laid down on the cloak with a smug smile on his swollen lips. After catching his breath, Draco rolled over to grab Harry's cock. It didn't take long for Harry's cum to spill out over Draco's hand and onto his own t-shirt. Harry smiled up at Draco casting a wandless cleaning charm, then pulled him close for a lazy kiss.
"Maybe posh and blonde is my type." The words were out of his mouth before he'd thought them.
❣️~~~~~~~~~💕~~~~~~~~~❣️
his mind screamed.
"Please take me to her. I think we should get ahead of this." She turned to Draco, "The meeting tonight should not be in the paper. We need to distract the public, lest your Father become front page news."
"Wow," Astoria said through a chuckle, "I've never heard you cuss."
Narcissa looked past Draco at Minerva and offered a polite smile, "Thank you for welcoming me Minerva. Yes please," she replied, taking one of the seats in front of McGonagall's desk and accepting a cuppa from Professor Loire.
Malfoy glances briefly at the closet again before he answers. “I honestly can’t think of a reason not to.” Resigned, he stands up and offers a hand. “Owl me the details of our first date Granger.”
"Nope," Blaise replied, graciously.
"Potter?" Malfoy said, impatience lacing the name.
When Draco was finished he leaned back, letting his ass sit perfectly atop Harry’s throbbing erection. “All right Potter,” Draco said, pulling out his wand, “do you trust me?”
Pansy snapped the mirror shut, "Tell us about Draco," she said. At the request, all thoughts that didn't involve Malfoy abruptly abandoned Harry's mind.
Harry turned the corner of a stone corridor and came to an abrupt halt. Standing in the middle of the hallway, facing the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance, was Draco Malfoy. He was dressed in impeccably well fitting robes, a navy blue with golden brocade.
"Wait," she called after him, her heart beating rapidly, "are you saying there is access to Narnia?"
A fleeting smile tugged at Potter’s lips. “What else is on the list Malfoy?”
Harry huffed a laugh, then remembering why they were having this conversation, and put his face back in his hands. “Fuck,” he said. In the quietness that followed, Orion’s purring seemed to echo.
Harry gave her a frank look and let his eyes fall purposefully to where her shirt was unbuttoned, showing the smallest amount of cleavage, then looked back up at her blushing cheeks. “Yeah, I’m pretty sure I find women attractive.”
The fireplace flares behind Draco and he turns to see Potter stepping out of the green flames. He's wearing baggy denims and a black button down shirt that is slightly too tight, stretching across his chest, with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Draco drags his eyes away from the flex of Potter's forearms to look closely at the shirt. He hears a mug placed on the table and turns back to see Pansy looking at him.
Harry noticed the way her voice floated through the hall without being loud or abrasive. "Yes," he said, "I didn't- that is the other students- I mean- No, actually, there's not. It won't happen again."
Potter chuckles, and bites-sucks Draco's neck. "That would explain why my cock reacts to you as if you're a walking wet dream." Potter groans when Draco's hand pushes past the barrier of Potter's pants to grip his cock. "It wouldn't explain why you're always on my mind though," Potter says.
Harry sat cross-legged on his bed with his charms book laid out before him, freshly changed from his Quidditch gear into denims and a Cannons t-shirt. He was studying for the group project they were starting on Friday. At least, he
A brief smile touched Draco’s lips, then he shook his head and turned to Harry.
Twenty minutes later there's a knock at the door. Harry jumps from his desk but doesn't move. Hadn't Charlie said it would take an hour? He hopes it's not someone else, he doesn't want any interruptions.
McGonagall paused to look each student in the eye, which wasn’t that many, there were only 16 students returning for NEWT exams. “Your colors are white for goodness and violet for wisdom and peace. I ask that each of you take these traits into account, along with the ideals behind the capybara, while interacting with each other. Your password is 'simul' and your room listings are on the corkboard in the common room.”
"I see." Potter's jaw twitched, but his expression remained neutral.
"Merlin, Potter, just come in."
“What?” Harry said, defensively.
of stories about me and- about this-” he waved his hand at her desk, unsure which word would capture the situation.
. Harry thought bitterly,
After the war he had approached Granger with ideas on how to help change the divisive nature that was so deep-seeded in the Wizarding World. His only stipulation for funding had been the requirement for muggleborns to learn more about the customs and traditions of pureblood families so that they weren’t lost to future generations. That program had launched his current relationship with Granger, and could probably be credited with the reason she had hired him as an Unspeakable.
“We need ground rules,” Blaise said through clenched teeth.
With that, he walked into the tunnel and out of sight. James followed him into the dark.
“I don’t give a fuck about the sacred 28, Blaise.” Draco shouldered his school bag and walked into the hallway motioning for Blaise to follow him. “Don't you understand? Potter won. His mother was a muggle and he still brought down the Dark- he still won the war.”
"Thank you for doing this. I know I didn't give you much choice," she says.
Harry kept his eyes on the other boy, ignoring her request.
Teddy sank into the water with a sinful groan. “This is perfect.” He reached past the edge to grab his wand, touching the Cypress tip to the water with a whispered, “
Harry grabbed 2 pieces of bacon from his abandoned breakfast and did, indeed, follow them out the door.
Draco pulled a face, "Your post coital talk needs work, a lot of work. I can't believe you just brought her up."
"The returning 8th-year students will sleep two to a room in the renovated west tower. Due to the recently released information about your preferences," McGonagall spoke slow and steady.
He realized that Malfoy probably thought he was staring, which was ridiculous. He was thinking -
Draco -
"Coworker?" Anna offered.
Without thinking, Blaise thrust gently, pleadingly, upward, brushing against Neville’s lips while his hands threaded through that messy dark hair. When he sank into Neville’s mouth the wet heat was like nothing he’d ever felt, and was only surpassed when Neville’s head started to move, his cheeks hollowing from the suction.
Draco had practically growled at him in response, "You are terrible at listening, Potter."
"Hello, Mr. Potter. Thank you for coming to see me today," she said.
"If a horcrux counts, then yes."
Draco's eyebrow quirked, the light grey of his eyes dropping in a slow perusal that Harry tried not to fidget under. "Is that so?"
"Potter!" she said, cutting him off. "I'm well aware that you died, saw the big gay light at the end of the tunnel, and came back to have some fun. I do not want to hear about your cock adventures."
Dean dropped a hand to Ginny's shoulder. "It's not sexist Gin, he calls us darling too."
"No," the woman said, "I think I've seen as much as I need to."
"I am," Neville replied. "Are you ready to give me away?"
ran a six-page expose on Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. The article,
I think there's only 2 chapters left folks!
"Um... Harry."
"Hello," Blaise said. He was already hard, and seeing Neville was not helping.
Harry ran a hand through his hair looking down at Pansy's shoes, and said, "I'm not sure if they told you…" he trailed off.
Word count (if applicable): 7072
Pansy narrowed her eyes at him, "Is that an issue?"
Over the next week, Harry and Pansy put the finishing touches on the 8th year dorms.
Harry shrugged, "I only have to be there for 2 days. And it's important."
"Well, I've worked out that it has to do with me at least. So," he said with a shrug, "if you want to ask me questions I'm willing."
Friday morning Harry woke up late. He made it to breakfast in time to chug down a glass of pumpkin juice and cram in two pieces of toast before the food disappeared. Ron and Hermione had already left for class so he knew he would have to brave the storm of students alone.
Anyone who has read Rambunctious Roommates or Wallbanger knows I'm not as big on Angst. But... There is plenty of room for it.
"You have to decide what's worth it Blaise," Draco replied.
Hermione watches as Draco tries to collect himself with his stupid stormy eyes and his ridiculously perfect hair. "I said, start talking."
"Harry are you all right?" she asked.
“Harry?”
Kreacher popped in with dinner and they each tucked into their food.
"Are you ready to testify?"
“Yeah,” she said. Her eyes dropped down in a slow perusal of his body. “Me neither.”
Hermione opens the door to find the loveliest bouquet of flowers she's ever seen, not to mention the largets. The Cape Jasmine flowers take up half her desk, shifting in color between each petal so that even one flower is several shades of pink, blue, white, and violet. With so many flowers she's surprised the smell isn't overwhelming, but there's only a hint of jasmine in the air. Hermione turns back to Pansy only to find her assistant right behind her, peeking over Hermione's shoulder.
As Harry made his way back to the floo, he spotted Lucius Malfoy standing by it. Harry quickly glanced around to make sure they were alone before he crossed the rest of the tiled floor to stand in front of him. Knowing the threat of Draco going to Azkaban had been nullified allowed a flood of bitter emotions to course through him. He let his distaste show openly on his face, only to see it matched in Lucius’ own hostile expression.
“I think we should play Never Have I Ever,” Daphne said, pushing back long chestnut-brown hair from her shoulder.
"Come now, Potter," Draco said, "we both know easy is what you want. Easy is what you've been getting for months now. Go shag a Hufflepuff. Merlin knows they will willing blow you, especially if they think it's going to help with emotional stability. Honestly, I assume that's the reason we keep them at the school."
Draco thanked her and left the party behind.
"He's in bed," Harry answered, then his mouth tilted into a lopsided smile. "He's not exactly speaking to me at the moment. We had a bit of a disagreement."
Blaise rolled his eyes. "I should have made Pansy my best man." He turned on his heel and walked down the hall with Draco following happily after him.
Potter glared up at him and Weasley gave a rueful smile. Draco rolled his eyes,
George pushed off the wall grabbing a strip of satin from a display case. He walked over to Draco and held it out on the tips of his fingers. "Try it."
Harry turned an incredulous look on her. "What does that mean?"
"If you get back at a reasonable time, come say hi?"
“Let me take care of you,” Neville said, so quietly Blaise was grateful that he heard it over the rushing in his ears.
"Um- you-" Neville said, stumbling through the two words without eye contact.
"Potter," she said softly, as though she hadn't expected him to be there.
"Come here," Neville leaned against the wall behind him and gently pulled Blaise closer.
Draco took in the site of his parents next to the fireplace. “Mother, Father. You’re here early,” he said casually, sauntering into the room and sitting next to Harry.
Harry's smile grew, and he bucked his hips invitingly, hoping Draco would give in to his baser instincts.
“Nev and I were just going over some projects. So what do you need help with?” he said. Even through the flames, Harry could see the charm in Blaise’s smile.
Next up - the incredibly awkward morning after. HAHAHAHA
Professor Loire came up to him then, standing to close and spoke in a voice that only he could hear, "Now now Potter, don't get distracted," she said in a sweet tone. "You are supposed to be watching their technique, not admiring them."
Hermione laughed, "Because I'm not an idiot, Harry. I knew it would completely distract you. Your obsession with Draco isn't exactly unknown to me."
The Professor smirked, "See you tomorrow then. I'm going to fortify your work for tonight. You can't be here for that so go home or to wherever you two go when you're not here."
"Problems with the new flat?" Blaise asked.
Pansy's eyes glittered with anticipation, she gave him an unkind smirk, "There was an article about you this morning."
Hermione tsk'd and said, "It's important. Besides, the Headmistress gave a beautiful speech on moving past differences and coming together as a student body."
Sitting down, she glances at him to see if the dress has had the desired effect. Though his eyes are definitely taking her in, he looks more suspicious than interested. “Thank you for meeting with me,” Hermione says, giving him a small, sweet, practiced smile.
It wasn't until 2 hours after arriving that Harry was able to get Ron alone. Brunch had finished and Hermione was discussing the merits of issuing Wizarding identification cards, similar to the Muggle world, with Bill, when Harry snuck out to the garden to ambush his best friend.
welcome.
At home, Harry inhaled a sandwich and changed his clothes. He was late to meet his friends at the pub. On his way to the door, he was stopped by a fire call from Ginny and Hermione.
The gargoyle shifted, sliding to the left and James jumped back from it. Left in its place was a dark entrance to a tunnel.
For more sassy Harry read this https://archiveofourown.org/works/20970083/chapters/49862057
"My Father, allegedly, set fire to the manor. The charges were dropped," he repeated, giving Astrid a sleepy smile. "I think they could have found the real culprit if it wasn't for the shoddy Auror work," he said, turning fond eyes on Harry, "wouldn't you agree, Dad?"
“It was a gift,” Harry says quickly, hoping that will help.
Harry glared at him, "Shove off Malfoy," he said, "she doesn't know what she's talking about."
"No. We're still researching for Hermione's parents. Ginny isn't going either, she wants to stay with George at the shop."
"Having Harry wear your line would be a great marketing opportunity.”
Not to mention Pansy.
"Way to terrify him Seamus," Dean said through a laugh. He stood, picked up the book, and sat next to Harry. "I apologize for his complete lack of tact." He set the book between them.
“Mr. Potter,” Lucius said, turning to Harry, “I hope you know that you will have to get these plans approved by the family before you begin.”
"Great," he said. He reached out to squeeze Draco's bicep affectionately. Shocked, Draco felt his jaw drop and quickly closed it with a snap of his teeth. "Just wanted to catch up with Draco before starting my weekend."
Harry dropped his hand and started to make his way back to the group before Neville's hand shot out and gripped Harry by the arm. Harry looked back, confused.
Draco smirked and laid his head back down, "Good. Now get to it, Potter."
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco smirked and moved a little closer. Potter still didn't back up, only tilted his head, slightly up, to meet his eye.
Potter casts a locking charm at the door. “Always,” he replies with a grimace. "You'd think the press would have something more interesting to write about than where I spend my time."
Draco’s body shivers at the words and he pushed his own erection against Harry’s. "Answer me."
He crouched down with one hand on the ground and the other holding his wand out. When the smoke disappeared like it was snapped out of existence they both cast at the same time.
When Draco returned to his office he sat at his desk for nearly half an hour replaying the conversation in his head. He wasn't able to determine what, exactly, had happened. All he knew for sure was that Hermione Granger really
At 6pm Draco was staring at his mirror, a knitted green and silver scarf wrapped around his neck. He sighed heavily, running a hand through his hair to rumple it a little further into an on-purpose messy look. Boot had sent tight denims, black converse, and a t-shirt with the Hogwarts emblem emblazoned in gold.
Draco grabbed a card. He glanced up at Blaise before looking at the rest of the table. "Never have I ever had sex in a public place."
Draco cleared his throat, almost casually, and Harry's eyes snapped to him.
She remained where she was, “Hungover?”
Draco knew talking would only lead to a fight. Without saying anything, he ran a hand through his own hair, letting it fall back into place slowly. He watched Potter’s eyes follow the movement.
Harry turned to the wall he had been working on and thunked his head against it. "How do they not have better things to report on?"
Pansy smirked and shook the bag at him.
"Hello, Blaise," Draco said, smoothing out his shirt as he turned around. "We were just trying to get Harry's hair tame enough for pictures. Did you need me?"
“I agree. I can’t get through one conversation with Scorpius without hearing about Potter’s thoughts on the issue, or how Potter tells certain jokes with a better ending, or why Potter should be invited to the next charity ball at the manor.”
Harry licked his lips clean and sat back on his heels, looking up with naked heat in his eyes. Draco favored him with a wry smile, and said, "If she asks which one of us prefers to bottom, what should I say?"
"Let's start the game," Harry said.
"Favorite class?"
When Harry came he had to bite down on the meat of his hand to keep himself quiet, while Draco sucked and licked until Harry’s cock was too sensitive for any more pleasure.
Astrid watched delightedly as her clothes floated up and wrapped themselves on the hangers. Afterwards Scorpius caught her wrist and clasped on the bracelet that matched his own. He smiled and touched his with a thumb and then his finger. Her wrist went a little warm and she looked down to see the words, -
"Lemon Cheesecake."
"Weaslette," came a voice from the other side of the door, which opened immediately, allowing entrance for Ernie Macmillan.
-Fuck Draco!
How are you going to feel when I kiss her?"
Harry fumbled at the abrupt change of subject, "I- yes. You could say that," he said, feeling his lips curl up at the memory of a beetle in a jar. "I think she always will, actually."
This was SO MUCH FUN to write!!!!!! I hope you guys love it <3
Draco took a long slow breath. He wasn't ready to be this close to Potter in a room full of sex toys. Sex toys that he had possibly purchased! Draco stuffed the list back into his file, careful not to let Potter see the contents, and said, "That's probably enough."
Harry blinked several times then stuffed a forkful of rice into his mouth. Draco had to be fucking with him. Trying to get a reaction. Which was working, based on the way Harry’s heart was beating insistently against his ribcage.
At least, he tried to shut the door, but Pansy stuck out her hand and pushed it back open. "Don't even think about it, Chosen One," she said and stormed into the house.
Monday morning Harry sent a patronus to Dean and Seamus, letting them know he would be on site by 2. Normally he liked to show up early on Monday, to make sure everyone was starting on time and supply hangover potions when needed, but today was different. Today was June 5th. Today was Draco's birthday. And Harry wasn't willing to wait any longer for loose ends to be tied up. He tugged on the tight jeans from Pansy's shop, ran a glob of Sleekeazy’s through his hair, slipped on a black t-shirt.
"Not on purpose! The walls are thin."
"Wait," Harry said, his smile falling away, "she didn't ask you?"
Draco nodded along and asked, "Does it count if he created the charity?"
“What?” Draco whispers back. “What do you need?”
Daphne nodded, "It is. Ms. Malfoy cut them off. It's a good thing too. Astoria is going to come out to Mom over the holiday break."
At those words, the context of the conversation caught up with them and they all started to laugh.
The three of them walked down to breakfast together and sat at the eighth year table, across from Ron and Hermione. Hermione smiled and said good morning, while Ron grunted and shoveled more eggs into his mouth.
"I'm not seducing you. I've been your friend for a long time and we're practically siblings. Now come over here and tell me what's wrong."
Potter sits up with his feet hanging off the end of Draco’s king-size bed. “And you want me to be honest?”
"She's too smart for you, Scarhead," Pansy said quietly.
“I also added three other projects to your queue.” Hermione folded her hands in her lap and continued, “which means you’re going to need some help.”
Potter laughs, “You have no idea.”
Draco huffed, hoping the flush he felt spread up the back of his neck didn’t make it to his cheeks. “Is it the master, or do you use Sirius’ room?”
"I already told her to talk to Hermione about it."
Once they were in bed Draco curled up around Harry, who nearly melted into his arms. Kissing Harry's neck Draco said in a whisper, "What was it like, growing up without your parents?"
Spending time with Teddy was almost always pleasure without release. And it’s not like James didn’t have a bed to himself tonight. For now, he just needed to think of a way to keep Teddy’s fingertips on him without letting his brazen cock be seen.
Astrid looked expectantly at Scorpius and he gave her a small smile. “Of course, Father,” he said. “Let’s see, most of what you’re looking for will be at Diagon Alley. You can buy your books there, and you are allowed to read as much as you like before school starts. You will be fitted for robes as well. You are welcome to order from Etsy, I know that some of the other students have, but during class you have to wear the uniform. Honestly, we wear mostly muggle fashion when we are off grounds and on the weekends,” he motioned to his own clothes, a pair of well fitted jeans and a dark gray button down shirt. “You can wear custom robes from Etsy at some of the dances we have if you want. Your wand can come from a couple of different shops but I recommend Olivander’s. His shop is here in London and he makes the finest wands in the Wizarding World.” He paused to give her a sad smile, “You won't be able to use it until school starts, there are laws against underage magic.”
He doesn’t pick up the invitation, instead he stands and circles the desk to crowd into Potter’s space. “Have you finally accepted that Auror work is too difficult for you and secured your future career as an owl?” Draco asks.
Hermione snatched her hand from him and playfully punched his bicep, laughing at his bravado, but she didn’t tug up her shirt. Harry wondered if Hermione’s new confidence was a result of time spent with the Slytherin girls.
This one is longer than normal because there was a lot to pack in.
The headline reads ~War Heroine Wins Pure-blood Heart~. In the picture Draco is looking down at Hermione as though she’s the only person in the room who matters. He leans in to whisper something into her ear and a blush spreads high on her cheekbones. Hermione breaks out into a grin, tugs him close by the collar of his shirt and kisses him. It's nothing crass, just a sweet chaste press of the lips, and then the picture loops and plays again.
"Will do."
He leaves to say hello to the rest of the table while Draco and Hermione watch him go.
“I have to say Scarhead, I thought you were exaggerating about your fans,” Pansy said, pulling Harry’s attention.
"Come with me Mr. Potter."
"Pansy!" both boys said at the same time.
Pressing his body against Draco’s thigh, Potter said, "Tell me what you need me to do."
"I did not bully! I asked. Nicely."
A knock at the door interrupted them. Harry asked, “Is that Ron then?”
Harry thought.
Draco knocks on the door and waits. Nothing happens. Draco huffs. He knows Potter is still here. The git has to pass the bull pen to leave and Draco never misses him. Because, even though Potter still pisses him off every time they speak, the man cuts a nice figure in his Auror robes.
It started four years after the war.
Her head gave a slight nod. "Mr. Potter," she replied.
Harry gave his collar a sniff. Not even a hint of the strong firewhisky he had been drinking the night before.
Harry shrugged, "Ginny did it for me. Why shouldn't I be in here?"
Harry sat dumbfounded for several minutes, just staring at her. "Er-" he finally managed.
That sat in comfortable silence until Potter asked, “Do you know anything about the costumes Draco and I are wearing?”
"Ernie, how are you?" Potter asked, without any warmth.
"I was grading-" Harry started, only to be interrupted.
"McGonagall said we were to plan the party
Also, I'm going to be starting a new story soon, if you want to get in on beta reading the rough draft, let me know :)
~~~💕~~~💕~~~
As his brain begins to catchup with the panicked response of his body, Harry chances a glance at the man next to him. The Malfoy next to him, the one Harry had pushed against the wall and kissed with eager, desperate, overdue, passion. The one he'd already told too much. The man he'd
"George!" Harry shouted.
," Draco said, having regained his composure, "you just need to sit there and look pretty. I will handle Skeeter."
No one seemed surprised by this, so Astrid assumed it was a regular occurrence as she watched Draco follow the elf over to his parents. She had seen pictures of them at the house, one on the mantle, and two in Pi's room.
Seamus blushed heavily at that statement and leaned over to whisper something into Dean's ear.
A Gryffindor who was currently looking at Blaise with lust-blown eyes like he wanted to eat him for dessert.
He watched as her keen blue eyes moved around the room and then fell on Harry. He met her eye calmly, memories of the final battle drifting through the panic in his mind. The tension in his shoulders eased slightly, he knew this woman would do anything to protect her son.
"I-" Hermione said, then swallowed, still looking at Draco.
Hermione's brows drawdown.
"I just-"
She gave a wry smile, and whispered, “I’m surprised, I heard that someone burned it down.”
"Um," Harry said, and both men turned to look at him. He awkwardly held up his tie, "Does it matter that I have six items?"
He stood from the chair and smoothed out his black robes. “Thank you for your time, Boot,” he said, headed for the door.
Pansy and Draco stared at him.
* this is a reference to Name Of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss, which I HIGHLY recommend because it's one of my favorite stories.
"Not a prank," Draco answered, setting down the essay to give Blaise his full attention.
"If you book in advance."
Draco swallowed thickly and pushed the head of his dick into Harry's open mouth, "Savior," he whispered.
Draco actually feels his heart clench at the implication of those words and he kisses Potter just to shut him up.
ringing through his mind even after so many years. Moody would be rolling in his grave if Harry went around recklessly walking through doors that were cursed. When nothing presented, he said, "Keep a hand on me, just in case," and walked through the door to find himself on a rooftop patio.
"Man, that's a sexy scar," Anna said, her hand still tugging gently at the shirt.
Hermione, Pansy, and Draco all raised their hands. The Professor pointed to both girls and directed them to the right side and the back side.
Once he felt mostly composed, and was breathing air properly, he tried again. "Lucius," Harry said, offering his hand. Lucius was still taller than him, but no longer the towering figure Harry remembered during their first meeting. He pushed down his annoyance and anger towards the man and reminded himself that they needed to work together to keep Draco from getting expelled.
Ron looked between them, heaving a dramatic sigh. "Sure. I want to see you, even if it means spending time with him."
She closed her eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. "Fine," she said quietly, "just don't do anything stupid."
"Potter!"
Draco pulled off, his swollen lips smirking up at Harry, “Yeah Astoria, why?” he replied, still stroking Harry’s cock with an agonizing gentleness.
That’s how Draco found himself waiting for Potter outside of a building for the second time that day. He should have been annoyed, possibly walked off in a huff, but it gave him a bit of breathing room. He’d been thinking about fanfiction for two days straight, and he’d been forced into spending time with Potter for several hours now. Something about that idea, being forced to to spend time with Potter, tickled the back of his mind. Before he could focus too much on it, Draco heard a girl call his name.
Pansy took a deep breath, dramatically letting her shoulders slump, and said, "All right Chosen one, I won't try to make you leave. But I'm going to be in there too. You may have fangirls chasing you down but the students chasing me down want to do worse than kiss me."
to show that he wanted this, or show it more than he already had, at least.
"The two of them threw an impromptu foam party in the Hufflepuff dormitory. It took nearly three hours and several professors to get the thing under control."
He looked over the railing of the stairs first, just to make sure Orion hadn't fallen through the wrought iron. Able to breathe a bit easier after
Harry laughed, "You're both awful. I'm leaving now. See you soon."
When James’ desperate attempts at
"Oh here we go," Harry said.
"Tom," Pansy corrected, and Ginny started to laugh.
In lieu of saying hello, Harry cleared his throat and made a show of looking over the blonde's outfit and said, "What is this, your attempt at casual wear?"
The blonde lifted his head and looked Harry now with a lifted eyebrow, "If I continue to call you Potter, are you going to stop?"
Harry spotted Hermione near the bar which was set up with snacks, chocolates, butterbeer, and punch. "Great job 'Mione," he said, pulling her into a side hug.
Draco’s voice, huskier than it had been before, was steady when he replied, “Not right now, thank you.”
"Oh, of course." With an eye-roll, Harry turned to walk into the kitchen, "Come on then, our food should be here soon."
Scorpius sighed at that and said, "Come in."
Harry gave a humorless laugh, "Horrible," he said.
Two years ago, half the Auror team and a pack of Weasleys had gone across the pond for Harry’s 21st birthday. Harry had been drinking since 1998 but visiting the states for their 'of age' birthday meant free drinks all night. The next day was spent downing potions, sleeping off the hangover, and generally feeling like shit.
- since just after the trials. Would have happened before? If they had been alone together would they have-
"Do you want to come study with me?"
Or chat with me on Instagram @dracos.tealsuit 💕💕
Draco held his breath and his tongue, not wanting to give her any ideas.
"What preferences?" Harry asked casually. He could think of more than one preference that she might be talking about, but he was fairly certain which one would upset Umbridge.
Harry blushed, cleared his throat, and took back Ron's lager.
"Go out with me tomorrow? I'll take you for ice cream? I know a place that has ridiculously posh flavors so you will be able to find something."
Dean, who looked to be holding back a laugh said to Seamus, "Maybe it would help him? Proximity, you know?"
"For?"
“I want to know the effects on your psyche. The first step is to research the material and bring me a report on which tags apply to you. We need to know the kind of story you’re actually living before we can make any comparisons.”
"Potter, what the fu-"
“Ernie,” Hermione said.
Hermione stands up feeling triumphant. This is going to work! Ron is going to spend the entire gala slack-jawed and pining for her. She shakes Malfoy’s hand and leaves the apothecary with a genuine smile on her lips.
Harry stayed silent. There was no use trying to fight that statement without knowing what had happened.
"I did not ask you," Umbridge said, her tone clipped and frigid. "I know how keen you are to lie."
at the paper. When it floated over, Draco pulled it close so they could all read it.
Pansy arches a perfectly manicured brow, "I didn't read the card but I'm guessing they are from your date last night?"
When Harry woke on Thursday morning he felt wrung out and decided to stay in bed where he spent a better part of the day trying to make a decision about returning to his life or moving to a remote muggle location in Canada to escape the- well, to escape everything really.
seeing any signs of a kitten, Harry started to walk down the hallway. He was three doors past his apartment before he heard a noise behind him. Harry swung around and spotted Orion, the kitten was sitting in the middle of the hallway in front of his flat.
Scorpius cringed and sat up. He hadn't done anything wrong, but he was definitely wearing only boxers under all these blankets and pillows. He briefly considered what to do if Harry asked. He wouldn't lie outright, he'd tried that when he was younger and it never seemed to work. Distraction was best with Harry, he would do that if needed.

he thought. There, on Draco’s bed were Draco and Blaise, lounging, fully clothed, a box of chocolate frogs being shared between them.
“Can I?” Draco asked, so quietly Harry was grateful that he heard it over the thudding of his own heartbeat.
"Mr. Potter," Professor Loire said, her voice floating through the office in a way that made Harry suspect she might have some Veela heritage, "surely there must be one female in Hogwarts whom you trust."
Harry stilled, then let out a low whistle, “Well that would be…” he trailed off, unsure how to finish the sentence.
"Will he be upset you gave this to me?" Harry asked.
"I'll do it," Dean said.
Draco laid the wand on the table between them and looked at Harry, "So where is my wand?" he asked. His voice was barely a whisper in the quiet garden.
"Because you already want someone else and I never play second fiddle."
Potter huffs a laugh, "You'll have to start calling her Hermione."
Narcissa wordlessly summoned a shirt from Draco’s room, handed it to him with a pointed look at his bare chest, and said, “We were hoping to take you shopping before lunch at the manor.
Draco pressed a hand against the stone now surrounding him, “This is incredible.”
Harry frowned, looking at the folder. “Ok,” he said cautiously. “So you’ve known that you might need information against Umbridge since before today. Or, more likely,” he returned his gaze to Lucius, “you have this kind of thing on a lot of people who work at the ministry?”
Despite the request, Harry whimpered, lust thundering through him, making his brain shut down any information that wasn’t related to
Level -4
"Mhm," Pansy replied, "She thinks this room set up is good for your… imaginary friends."
Harry grabbed him, wrapping his boyfriend into a strong hug before he went down. He looked over Draco's shoulder at McGonagall who motioned him forward. Supporting the blonde's trembling body, Harry walked them both over to the chairs in front of her desk. He sat Draco down and then sat himself, still holding his hand.
Draco turned back and looked over Harry’s robes and then up to his face, “Go fix your robes Potter, you’re up in front of some very influential wizards soon.” Then they left around the corner.
Which, to be fair… he had a point. Harry tried to scoff but it came out more choked and breathy than air-of-annoyance he had been going for.
Please leave me a comment if you want to make my day!!
Draco’s hips buck into his fist, “I want to -
The two of them leaned on each other catching their breath until Draco pulled back and waved his hand to cast a cleaning charm. Each of them tucked away in silence and then stood looking at each other.
"Are you hitting on me with poorly executed innuendo or was that a true story?"
"Pansy," Pansy says, looking between them. Draco laughs and bumps her shoulder affectionately. She watches them closely, trying to decipher if Draco has told Pansy that this is all a sham or if she needs to keep up appearances. Pansy has not mentioned it to her either way.
"I don't know," Blaise gave a slow shrug, "You basically tried to blackmail me, and we never finished our conversation."
Neville froze, looking at the floor. "What if he's not? What if he doesn't come? He's a flight risk Harry. Commitment terrifies him. And I get it. I know his mum-"
Say hi on Instagram @dracos.tealsuit
Both boys were smiling when they reached the kitchen to find Hermione, Ron, and Kreacher, all staring at them with wide concerned eyes. For the first time since they left Diagon Alley, Harry was happy that Pax had wanted to stay with Draco. Even with the bird, Draco tensed up.
He sighed, looking towards the heavens for some sort of answer to his life's story. Instead his eyes caught on Luna's sign, 'Pots and Pans', which Ron had gleefully mounted to their outer door frame.
Harry can see a copy of Malfoy's numerous tattoos peeking out from the cuffs of the teal button-down shirt he's wearing.
Signed,
“Isn’t it going to be weird hanging out with your- what did you call him? Your Uncle?”
Harry ran a hand through his wild hair, “Luna is a different year. Other than that there’s only Ginny, and she wouldn't keep her hands off me if we were caged together like this. So no," he glared at each of them, "there are no 'appropriate females' here." He'd never used air quotes before, they were nice for times when you needed to condescend.
"OK Dad?"
“Granger,” he said, “I’ve brought my case file from the assignment last night.”
"Pi-" she started, then looked at the floor. Scorpius nearly mentioned that they hadn't agreed on that nickname, but realized he could feel her hand tremble and knew something was actually scaring her.
(See the end of the chapter for
They worked together in silence for the rest of the day, with Pansy filling in the mortar and Harry placing the stones. When evening came Harry gave her an awkward little smile and said, "See you tomorrow."
"I love you too. So much. But right now I need you to fuck me."
Harry's eyes snapped up from the artwork to meet Draco's. "How many do you have?"
"OK, just checking," she said, then held out a punch card to him. "Here, this card will get you a free ice cream after you buy five, I already punched out the first two."
Blaise swallowed hard. "It was a good show," he said. Then, deciding to take a risk, added, "If you're into toned Gryffindor boys with messy dark hair."
Once all of the 8th years were seated at the table Ernie Macmillan pulled the Weasley cards close and shuffled. The cards had a charm to play as several different party games, based on the way you opened the deck.
Astrid promptly choked on her tea and had a coughing fit while Harry smirked, leaned back in his chair and waited for her to recover.
Blaise knew when he'd been caught. Trying to argue now would only make it worse. "OK."
again.
“Now I can’t get you the real thing, you'll have to do that on your own when you're ready. This guy works exclusively as Draco Malfoy and from what I understand, he’s very good. He was recommended to me by a reliable source.”
Once Hermione locates the dress she needs she heads to the kitchen to make tea. The blue dress is perfect for late spring, tight at the top with an open back and a skirt that flows down to mid-thigh with a sunflower pattern. The flower petals sway as if caught in a gentle breeze. It's from Luna's first collection, before her clothing line veered away from sweet into too-bizarre-for-Hermione territory.
"Sure thing," Ginny agreed eagerly.
Harry growled around his cock before he began to suck Draco off in earnest. He gave everything he could, his jaw aching well before the end, and his throat raw from letting himself choke on Draco's cock more than once. Saliva was everywhere, running down his chin and down the shaft to his fingers, allowing him to slide his hand up and down in time with his mouth. Harry doesn't care about the mess or the pain or feeling like he can't breathe, he only cares about Draco's trembling thighs, his broken moans, and the way his hair gets pulled roughly right before Draco filled his mouth with cum.
"You can't come in Potter. I need to work."
"How the hell could I be ready?" James huffed. "I don't know what's going on."
Ron tilted his head, eyes falling briefly to Harry's neck, then looked at Draco. Harry turned to look with him, realizing Draco was the picture of debauched. His sexy hair tousled, cheeks flushed, and he was sporting a love bite on his neck with another on his collarbone. Harry chewed at his bottom lip, trying to think of how to best handle this.
Here we go fandom, time to make things awkward!
"That's Teddy, he's Harry's godson, and he's some level of cousin to my Father," he replied. "You'll meet him tomorrow."
Without missing a beat, she asked, "And could you describe Ron's hair?"
Zabini laughed, "He didn't really need to say anything. I can hear his thoughts, remember?"
Harry stared at her for a moment, "Um… Quidditch?"
"Not until you tell me why the two of you walked in here together looking for it."
“Yes,” Harry replied, breathless. Realizing he was unaware of what he was agreeing to, he added, “Anything, please.”
Draco Malfoy
The Monday after his birthday, Harry arrived early at Hogwarts to find Pansy waiting for him in the classroom they were renovating. She was sitting on one of the tables with her hands gripping the edge. She looked up when he opened the door and quietly followed his movements until he stood in front of her.
“Do you think she’s actually hiding something illegal in her room?”
Draco leans over him, using the hold he has under Harry’s knees to fold him back, pushing his cock deeper. Braced himself, he leans in, brushing their lips together in an almost chaste kiss before saying, "Want me to fuck you?"
“Salzar! Harry,” Blaise said, awe evident in his breathless tone. “What happened? Did you think I was going to hurt my best friend?”
"Now Potter, what did I tell you when we left the house?" Draco was a solid weight behind him, hands sneaking around Harry's waist to brace him as Draco's hard cock pressed against his ass through the fabric.
When the Slytherin chuckled in response Harry thought he could feel the vibration of it in his chest, even though they weren't quite touching.
Astrid.
Loire looked up at her, a line formed between her red eyebrows. She walked over to them, "Yes of course," she replied absently. When she circled the desk to stand by McGonagall her eyes were on Draco. "What's happened?"
Harry reached the door in record time with a breathless, "Hey, Dudley," as he gently pulled Draco back by the waist.
"Don't we need the bootle of Ogden's for this?" Potter asked.
Pansy burst into the common room breathing hard and looking slightly disheveled.
Three games later Harry realized it was 1 am. He thanked Neville with a strong hug and shook Blaise’s hand. Before he stepped into the floo Blaise said, “Good luck with the Wallbanger, Harry. Draco is going to love that nickname.”
"I don't know what you're talking about," he said, gave her a wink, and left the cabin.
Sitting at a table hidden in the back corner, Draco sipped his cappuccino and tried to think of something to say. Spending this much time with Potter had him on edge and it had been less than an hour.
theories. "Hermione theories are definitely off the table."
"All right," Scorpius said, "there's no reason to hide that from me, Astrid."
It was dark in the club, other than the colored lights that pulsed in time with the music. Harry drank down two shots of firewhiskey as he surveyed the crowd on the dance floor. Out of the corner of his eye he spotted a small group of people motioning towards him. Concerned he was recognized already, he decided it would be a good idea to use the loo before he got mobbed.
"May I ask you something?" Blaise asked.
Potter's eyes widened and he jumped back, grabbing Draco's wrist and dragging him into the coffee shop. He cast a locking charm at the door and turned to the counter. Nora who was standing startled behind the counter, eyed him cautiously.
After his silent protest, McGonagall offered, "Hermione Granger, perhaps?"
Harry tried not to worry about his thoughts getting through to Zabini, but thoughts about Draco were different.
James bit his lip, praying that Teddy couldn’t feel the tremor of hope that had him trembling. “No, I really don’t.” He leaned forward pressing a chaste kiss against Teddy’s soft lips.
She rolled her eyes and started towards the back of the room to start working. "Maybe we should create a schedule for the room. One where you're not in it very often."
- not staring. "Only curious to know which poncy perfume you're going to choose this time."
"Teddy Lupin?"
Dudley seemed to relax for the first time since he’d appeared at the door. He turned to his daughter and said, “Go ahead, Jellybean.”
"Stop," Pansy said, pinching the bridge of her nose and generally looking as though Harry was a drain on her sanity. "Your current plan is to stalk him and then corner him."
“Ron,” she said, rolling up the parchment.
Harry chuckled, "I thought you were hungry. Also, what happened to calling me Harry?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry glanced to Hermione and Ron who stayed next to him, standing to his right. Ron shrugged and Hermione gave a slight nod, neither of them made to move off the witness stand. Harry knew he wasn’t obligated to say more than he already had, but he was willing to hear this out. “Go ahead,” he said.
"Yes."
Draco gives him an unimpressed look.
“I ordered it to go,” Potter said from behind Draco. He reached over to grab the bag. “Don’t worry, I remembered your poncy mustard.”
Without a word, Potter stepped closer, barely touching Draco. He slipped his hand against Draco's waist, sending a shiver through his entire body, and grabbed the doorknob.
“I can’t...”
Harry left her in the kitchen and opened the door to find Draco Malfoy on his step. He was dressed in soft grey trousers with a charcoal jumper over a pale blue button up. Not that Harry saw any of that, all he saw was Draco’s eyes, sharp sterling, with a bit of his platinum hair obscuring the view. They stared at each other for a moment without speaking until Harry broke eye contact, looking at the doorknob he was still holding, then promptly let it go.
“How’s that going? Are you any good at it?”
"I'm not even sure what I said that gave it away."
“Sorry,” the voice said behind him, “I know that’s not really your name.”
Harry gave him a fond smile and gripped his shoulder.
Harry has one arm above his head with his forearm leaned against the door frame. He's very close, enough that Hermione can feel the heat of his body. Did he notice she was looking at him? "Yes? Why wouldn't I be?"
Potter's brows furrowed. "That's not a good idea. The wards on this house-"
"I was hoping you could take me to Little Whinging and help me beat the shit out of Dudley Dursley," Draco replied.
"What the fuck?" Harry said, watching her move past him, "How is this my life?"
Harry grabbed his hand and inner locked their fingers, "I mean it," he said, making purposeful eye contact with the blond. "Ron isn't going anywhere, so you will have to find a way to get along."
"Yeah," Harry said with a grin, "o'course."
"Draco wanted to take a few years off," Harry said, "figure himself out, marry for love, get away from England. Lucius, his Father, wouldn't listen. He insisted Draco rebuild the family name. On Boxing day he presented three girls to Draco for him to choose to marry."
“Well Potter,” Draco drawled, “we were kind of hoping you wanted to play the part of a wizard today, instead of…” he paused and then said, “You did mention that we would have to go to Gringotts didn’t you?”
When Teddy arrived Scorpius watched with great amusement as Astrid charmed him with compliments, stating that all boys in the wizarding world must be jealous of his hair, not to mention his other attributes. Then she asked if she could touch it while it changed colors to see if it felt any different. Because Teddy was, like most hufflepuffs, a complete sucker for physical affection, he gave in easily and all but nuzzled against her hand. Scorpius considered her statement as he watched her fingers card through locks that shifted from Weasley red to deep turquoise. She was probably right, he realized, most boys -
Pansy leaves for work after issuing a warning to Potter. “I have wards on my room. If you step one foot in there I will send the Prophet.”
The office was silent.
he thought, confused.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry's given a soft smile, "Thank you," and they both turned to Ron.
"Such an eager thing you are."
Everything about it was perfect, except for one minor detail. The table was too close to the staircase, so when everyone sat down Petunia and Vernon were slightly under the stairs, causing them to hunch forward uncomfortably. Astrid watched, curious, as Harry and Dudley both looked at the staircase and then each other. Eventually, Harry gave a small smile and sat down at the chair marked with his name, sitting up straight and taking a drink of his wine.
Draco grinded down on Harry's cock, and Harry let out a desperate, choked moan. "You can't be serious," Harry said.
The smile Draco graces him with is worth it. Harry's never seen him so unguarded. “Put your legs up over my shoulders,” Draco says softly, guiding Harry into position. “That’s it.”
His eyes flashed with amusement, “No. Someone set fires all throughout the place, in hopes of burning it down. But they didn’t take.” He looked at the manor again, saying, “This house has over three centuries of magic in it, I don’t think anything could take it down.”
Harry heard a loud moan come through wall, reminding him of the reason he'd started down that train of thought, followed by, "Fuck"
, if they started dating,
On Sunday he went to the burrow. The house was abuzz with people, hugs, and food. After dinner, he joined Ron and Hermione to discuss her parents and the offer Ron and Harry had received from the auror department to start training.
The barriers dropped and the students rushed in. Harry watched as Draco stood over his professor. "Does this count as unconscious?" he asked in that pure blood drawl.
"You look much healthier,” Luna said, touching his cheek as the tips of his ears turned pink. “Would you like a radish?” She reached into her bag and pulled out a string of radishes.
Scorpius opened the door to find a large man hurriedly ending the conversation and stuffing his cell phone into his back pocket. He was broad shouldered with large everything, thick legs, thick arms and a stomach that wasn’t quite obese, but was nothing close to flat. The man looked a bit confused before he offered a polite smile and said, “Hi, I’m looking for Harry Potter.”
“I already picked the person showing up.”
"Astoria is working?" Draco asks. It's not common for a pure-blood woman to work outside of the few in the Ministry.
Between the words playing through his mind and his eyes reminding himself of how bloody fucking
“Yes, of course. I will see you there.”
"Tonight?"
Scorpius leaned around to watch the girl come up the sidewalk from their car. She was lovely, with long red hair falling past her shoulders onto a teal dress that was cinched at the waist. Scorpius eyed her with obvious appreciation before looking back at the man in front of him with a patented Malfoy smirk. “There’s no way that girl came from your genes,” he said.
Blaise gave a solemn nod. "Absolutely. You're right," he leaned closer and said, "but let’s talk about how you knew
“Pansy,” Hermione said, wincing at the burn of the alcohol, “it’s illegal to carry around a restricted potion.”
"Do you think you'll be ok? Reliving that?"
Harry threw up three
“Not that you’re in any position to bargain,” Harry said, echoing Lucius words from the fateful night at the ministry. He flashed him a wicked, unapologetic smile and said, “I’m not all innocence though, I’m definitely open to hiring him if the courting doesn’t work out.”
Hermione is caught off guard by the offer but she absolutely
Hermione wrapped her arms around Pansy, pulling the front of her own body flush against the Slytherin, and placing her chin on Pansy's shoulder to look over at him."It's more than worth it Harry. Ron thinks it's the best thing that could have happened to him."
"So," Ron said, attempting casualness, and failing, "would you like to update me on
Pansy balled her hands into fists and pressed them against her eyes, muttering, "Of all the self sabotaging, idiotic, unbelievably stupid," her rant gave way to a growl of frustration and she threw herself back against the pillows. The room went silent.
Affronted, Harry said, "I share!"
Draco's smile grew just a bit, "Probably, yes. I like to rile you up."
"I- the first time I thought about it was in 5th year."
“Draco, let me.”
“Better?”
Pansy chuckled into her pillow, "That's absurd. We would never work. Besides, Neville is hot, you're hot. You should be hot together."
"My name is Dudley," he said, throwing his hands up in an attempt at surrender. "I'm Harry Potter's cousin."
Draco’s lips spread into a predatory grin, tongue running lightly against his sharp teeth, as he watched Harry tug off his clothes until he was left in only boxers. Harry shoved them all into a pile and sank into the water, giving Draco a look of challenge. Draco, unphased and holding Harry’s eyes, pointed his wand to his chest. In a blink, Draco was stripped to his boxers, his clothes folded neatly, sitting on a table that had popped up from the deck.
“What?!” Harry cried.
Draco narrowed his eyes, plucking at the collar of his robes. "I'm an Unspeakable, Potter. What do you want from me?"
Blaise looked up from the book he'd been reading to see Neville's perfectly shaped lips wrap around the sugar quill, his tongue darting out to taste the candy.
Draco pulled off Potter's lips to suck and bite along his jaw and then his neck.
"That doesn't change the fact that you two are causing problems. She told me that she's excited about her date tonight. That she's starting to enjoy Draco a bit too much, thinking about kissing him even without the cameras." Pansy glares at Draco, "You're not supposed to hear that so don’t say anything to her about it or she will stop talking to me about you."
Harry grabbed a pillow from a nearby couch and threw it at Neville who caught it easily, laughing before he threw it back at Harry.
want to go back to a room without Neville. “Is that all right?”
Loire pressed the palm of her hand to her temple, closing her eyes, "There has to be someone. Someone at the ministry who is worse than her, who can beat her, throw a bigger tantrum. Someone who everyone fears more than her." She looked to McGonagall, "You've been around for nearly a hundred years Minerva, you must know someone who would be able to fight her on this. We have to fight fire with fire."
Harry jerked his hand back as though it were burned. He stared at Draco, gobsmacked, until the blonde reached up and closed Harry's jaw.
Scorpius pulled away quickly, glaring at Draco in false annoyance and smoothing his hair back into place. "Malfoy's don't look a fright when there's company, Father," he drawled in perfect imitation of his grandfather.
Harry’s breathing sped up, his body arching to try and touch Draco as much as possible while keeping steady against the door.
Draco fought the urge to flee. “I think I know enough,” he said.
“I don’t understand the assignment, what do you want me to report on?”
"Draco does look delicious in that leather jacket," Pansy said wistfully. "It's from my first collection, and I'll admit that he was my main source of inspiration for that particular line." Harry felt a flash of jealousy spark through him at the words.
Zabini cocked an eyebrow at him, "You are the loudest thinker I've ever met."
on his knees with cum on his lips.
"Sure," she said, taking a step closer to Draco and leaned her shoulder against the wall.
"Not yet," she replied with a cheeky grin, "but you might be if you let me have my way."
Thankfully the Headmistress arrived quickly with Filch in tow. She grilled in to them about their actions, assigned punishment, and instructed Filch and Neville to take the students back to their dormitories. Turning back to Draco she said, "Mr. Malfoy, you did the right thing not hurting them. I'm sure that it wasn't easy to stay calm when your friend had been hurt. I will make sure this incident does not cause problems with the Wizengamot."
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter pulls up a hand and rests it on Pansy’s shoulder. “Parkinson,” he says, his voice full of earnest entreaty, “I promise you, I’m not going to hurt him, and I will do my level best to be as Hufflepuff as possible while I’m in your flat. No looking through your things or making judgements, I’m just here to show some love.”
Kingsley smiled, "Good luck to you, Harry."
“Wait, what?” Harry said, but both women ignored him.
Draco flicked the bow, lifted an eyebrow and drawled, "I hope you don't think you will get laid that easily."
“I should quit,” he said to his empty flat.
"What do you want then?" Draco asked.
from Harry. He was pretty confident that Harry had paid Molly Weasley to teach him that look.
Hermione looked at the bottle with a frown. "Harry, we shouldn't-"
Harry met Dean and Seamus on site at Xenophilius Lovegood's property. The Rookery, as they had all started to call it, due to it looking like a rook chess piece, was finally coming together. Harry had designed to new buildings to be added onto the property, both of them looking like tall Bishop's from a chess game. One would be given to Xenophilius for his personal research and the other would be used as a publishing house and official headquarters for the Quibbler. Harry suspected that the Quibbler's growing success since the war was a big part of the reason that Luna had wanted a renovation and the addition of two buildings.
Harry moaned and pushed back against Draco’s hand. "There you go." Draco bit down on Harry's neck and then led a trail of hot kisses up to his jawline. "Fuck Harry, I love you." Then the head of his dick pressed against Harry.
Pansy moved towards him, gripping his chin. "Don't do anything stupid like catch feelings for me," she said, and Potter chuckled, his eyes flitting quickly to Draco and back.
Harry and Draco started to walk together after them, and Draco gave Harry’s hand a brief squeeze.
"Shutting up."
“Well good luck with that," Blaise said. "Dating a Gryffindor probably isn’t that different than a Hufflepuff. I imagine he’ll want you holding hands and accepting flowers.”
Draco nudged his shoulder as they watched the group of three head to the kitchen. "Think we should keep her?"
She met his eye, "Really? Quidditch?"
No, the reason Potter was a benefit was because of everything that came with him. He had some kind of favor with the house elves, so the room was always cleaned first and sometimes they brought food up, which Potter shared. Granger came in to go over classes with him, and she was happy to discuss Ancient Runes with Blaise as well.
she thought.
The smirk she gave when he pulled back to see her face was nothing short of Slytherin, "I know," she whispered and then continued around the corner.
Yep. Harry had seen plenty. Enough that Hermione had offered him a glass of water during one of the meetings, stating that she and
Malfoy stilled when he saw Harry, then he turned back to his apartment and locked the door. He had the boots on again, but no jacket. Instead, the sleeves of his button down were rolled up so that the flex of his forearms were on display, along with the Dark mark. Harry dutifully did not look at it.
"I will send a house elf to check on her," McGonagall said. "I'm sure she doesn't want this public so I won't force her to the infirmary unless necessary."
Harry closed his eyes, feeling the last vestige of his restraint shatter as Draco leaned in to whisper, “Je veux te baiser.”
"The death eaters we betrayed?"
Next update will be by June 24th.
Once Astoria had pulled Hermione up to her room under the guise of planning their costumes, Seamus handed over a galleon to Padma Patil.
Harry nearly said yes just to fuck with Lucius, but then he realized he could have even more fun with something closer to the truth. “It's a bit complicated, actually,” he said, letting a smile curve on his face as he stood up and walked towards Lucius, “I’m working towards something far more intimate with your
“I thought-” Harry took a breath, “I didn’t mean to do that.”
Please let me know if you like where this is going in the comments! They keep me going <3
"Tonight is better for me."
but she would certainly claim ignorance if asked. Draco is dressed in a set of black high-collar robes with silver trim. He would have looked severe if not for a soft smile and the mischief dancing in those grey eyes.
She grabbed a pen off the table and wrote an address on Harry's hand, "My show is on Saturday at the Double Arrow. Owl me if you're coming and I will give your name to the bouncer. Just think about it, ok?"
Draco looked around, but didn’t immediately see anyone he recognized. He almost never ran into another witch or wizard in muggle London. He hoped it wasn’t someone holding a grudge against him. Even if they were usually valid.
Wanting to further engage him, she asked, "Isn’t this the manor you grew up in?” motioning to the building ahead.
They reached the entryway and were greeted by an elf who was wearing the smallest tuxedo Astrid had ever seen outside of build-a-bear. His wide eyes swept over them before landing on Draco. “Master Malfoy,” he said, with a deep bow. "I will show your guests to the table, your mother would like a word with you before you're seated."
Hermione studied the two boys and said, "Charlie was right."
Oh man, I feel like Harry in this story has a life of his own. I keep having to change the tags to fit his character. There's no tag that says 'obnoxious flirt with Draco but doesn't think anything is happening, just likes to make him flustered'
Draco opens his eyes to find Potter standing above him, hands stuffed into the pockets of loose-fitting denims, Puddlemore shirt stretched across broad shoulders. Merlin, he’s filled out nicely. Draco attempts to squash that thought and summon his anger but it won’t come. Not that he was expecting it, honestly. He isn’t interested in hating anyone anymore, not after the war, and Azkaban. Instead, he’s left with the underlying pulse of attraction he’s felt for Potter since 5th year and the lack of balance makes his heart beat too fast.
“Yeah, I noticed that when they showed me the picture. Quicksilver seems a bit messy for Draco, I’m not sure he can pull it off.” Potter smiled to himself, looking down at his hands and Blaise was even more thankful he couldn’t hear his thoughts at the moment.
"Sure am. I wouldn't miss a chance to fly with you and Charlie."
"I think your mother knows," Potter says when he grinds his erection against Draco's thigh. "I think she caught me checking you out."
Draco sounded sweet and sincere.
“Perhaps a student from a different year?” Loire interjected.
Harry took a deep breath and focused, letting his magic ebb out gently, and vanished Draco's clothes without a word. Draco, standing at the foot of the bed completely naked, cocked an eyebrow at him, and Harry couldn't help but smile.
Astrid had never heard him use that term, 'Dad', and she was certain that he kept it reserved for special occasions.
There was another knock at the door and Pansy said, "Password?"
To Angst or not to Angst??
“And after that?” Draco asks between kisses, voice rough, with Harry's body thrusting up against him. He shifts his weight, pulling Harry's legs forward and standing above him.
Harry sighed, gave the cat a fond smile, and decided to leave him to it. He wandered into the bedroom, thinking that he could spend a little extra time getting ready since he was currently covered in the packing shavings Orion had gleefully tossed around the room.
"You're very good," Draco said, the words spoken quietly, as though they were a confession. The words shuddered through Harry, and he mentally congratulated himself for wearing baggy jeans as he felt an impending erection start to swell.
"Oh," Harry said, trying to figure out how to bring up the next question.
He has no concept of rules applying to him." Draco ran a hand through his hair, then stood to fix it in front of the mirror. "You saw how he was just now. Last night he insisted I sleep in his bed just to keep me out of the common room.”
-Be adventurous.
"Yes actually, I do know," Pansy said with a grimace, "Wait here for a few minutes, I'll get him and Blaise out of the hallway. Seeing you would ruin him for the night. Be early tomorrow Scarhead." Then she left without waiting for him to reply.
When the shirt was shredded Draco moved off of him and used
Harry laughed, "Yeah I bet you did. Commemorated your public apology to the boy who lived?"
"Oh," she said, "I was just reading
Harry blinked, trying not to wonder if she was a werewolf or a death eater. She looked young, maybe only a few years older than him. "Right," he said. "Well, it's nice to meet you. Are you two running the renovations? I'm here to help."
"Have you no sense of self-preservation left Draco? You are a Slytherin!" She said, balling her hands into fists at her side.
"Told me what?" Draco demanded.
For a moment she considers not answering. This is Malfoy, she doesn't want to share details with him, but she knows that won't work. She needs to get him to agree to this. “He’s oblivious, dense, he doesn’t stimulate me, his main interests are quidditch and signing his name for war hero groupies. He still gets most of his meals from his mother because I won't cook all of them and he’s either sleeping with his Auror partner or he’s headed in that direction.”
"No, and they didn't ask either. I didn't have a lot of options. You've seen what people are like around me."
"Prat," Harry mumbled to himself as he looked around the kitchen for a scrap piece of paper.
Neville pressed in for another kiss. "In fact," he said against Blaise's lips, "you should know now, I won't be doing more than holding your hand in the greenhouses. The rules are very strict in there."
"He's a Gryffindor," Draco replied. "You can always appeal to his morale side if it comes to it."
"Fuck," Harry said with reverence, "I don't know anything about being a wizard."
Let me know what you think!
Harry rolled his eyes, "I don't want to be an auror. I'm sick of chasing down clues and dark wizards," he replied. "Also, I'm not doing anything to you. This was done to me so I wouldn't act on my baser instincts."
"Minister," Lucius replied, his voice sounding far to genuine, "I saw the error in my prejudice long before the death of the Dark Lord."
(See the end of the chapter for
She looked up at him and patted his arm gently, “You live here Harry.”
Harry looked back at the other man to see what had made her quiet but he wasn't sure. Draco was still standing there leaned against the entryway with those long legs and that platinum hair and that smile which grew the more Harry looked.
Scorpius woke up to his wrist growing warm. Usually he took off the messaging device before bed, but Astrid had stayed up texting him until after midnight so he’d left it on. He glanced at his wrist to see the message she just sent.
Harry let his eyes fall in an obvious sweep over the outfit again, as his eyes travel back up to meet Malfoy’s he remembers what the sub had said,
"Together."
Pansy cut him off, "You weren’t there, you
Blaise gave him a weak smile, "Yes, try and think blank thoughts. In the meantime, if you start thinking about something I shouldn't know about, distract yourself. Yeah?"
“I’m sure we can be cordial when it’s necessary,” Draco says.
"Please. I can't-"
"It's nice to see you both." McGonagall gave a small smile to them before launching a verbal attack on their children. "As you are aware, we have sent you both owls regarding the behavior of-" she paused, lips pursing in thought, before continuing, "well, I'll use their first names to save us any confusion. We have sent home many owls regarding the behavior of Albus and Scorpius. The two of them have wreaked havoc amongst the student body since late October."
"I want you to help me strategize a plan to deal with Potter. His involvement with the Neville situation will absolutely not help."
Harry gave her a brief smile, thankful she was attempting to break some of the tension, and said, “Yeah, that sounds right. I’ll try to make good on it.” He looked back to Draco, taking in the dark circles under his eyes, he looked exhausted. Harry briefly wondered if his eyes were any better.
Potter called for an elf named Kreacher. Blaise had seen this elf before, when he had brought Potter food. He let Kreacher blather on about some of the students before requesting dinner. Blaise tugged his school bag onto his bed to pull out his potions text. He would still have to write his essay for tomorrow.
"What do they do exactly?"
Neville did no such thing, instead, he asked, “What year was it then, Harry?”
The door opened and Astrid peeked in, her eyes quickly scanning the room before landing on Scorpius. He was still in bed, covered in his blankets and surrounded by the pillows he'd tossed around for comfort last night. He looked her over. She was in jeans today with a black t-shirt that had a print of silhouette boys playing instruments with the word FUN written across it in gold letters. Her hair was wet, making it look a darker red.
Harry thought,
Harry rolled his eyes,
"Why don't you both come in for a cuppa?" Harry said. As the two of them walked through the door, Astrid met Scorpius' eye and her earnest smile morphed into a wry grin.
“You make me believe, you make me forget,” Harry replied, his chest constricting from lack of oxygen. "And you're the best lay I've ever had."
"You know what Malfoy," Harry said, pointing a finger at him, "you could at least-"
Neville, who had just taken a sip of pumpkin juice, started to choke and Harry pat his back sympathetically. He hated when he swallowed wrong.
Draco put his hand out to help up Professor Loire and Ron did the same for Harry. They turned to each other and shook hands, then she instructed the class to pair up and begin their discussions.
“Neville! Neville!” he shouted through the floo.
"You were in need of a healing spell for your
Harry stared at her for a moment and then looked at Hermione, who was behind her. "Is it worth it then? Dating a mouthy spoiled Slytherin? Or you know, whatever you and Ron call what you're doing with this one."
Blaise said once he’d recovered.
Harry stood and dusted off his denims. He did not look at Draco. Feeling his hands go clammy, he toyed with the idea of summoning his invisibility cloak and making good on the move to Canada he'd been considering.
A knock on the door pulls them both sharply from the moment. Potter holds a finger to his lips, signaling for Draco to be quiet and they both listen.
~~~💕~~~💕~~~
Once outside Malfoy crowds into her space. "I had a lovely time," he says.
Pansy met his eye, “Yes. We can pretend that instead, if you wish.” She took the robes back and packed them carefully into a box. “I hope you’re ready for the shitstorm you are going to cause by bringing him tonight,” she said, handing him the bag.
A brief look of annoyance passed over Draco’s features as he looked at Harry, nearly breaking into a sneer. Then, far more concerningly, his eyes flashed with mischief and he gave Harry a bitter smile.
This chapter is pretty heavy on the fake relationship trope, next chapter will be heavier on the secret relationship <3
Glancing quickly at Draco, Harry pointed his wand at Ginny, yelling,
"It is," he replied easily.
Harry, better than most, knows the power of love.
Draco eyes dropped to Harry's lips and he licked his own. For a brief moment Harry thought he might get the night his prick had been hoping for. Instead, Draco pushed lightly at his chest, causing Harry to take a step back. "You're making me look unavailable. Let's talk later."
Please let me know what you think in the comments!!
Harry blinks at him, feeling his cheeks heat. And honestly? He's surprised his body has enough blood left to blush. His cock is so hard he's worried he'll come without contact.
He was still lying on the rug, quietly chewing over this information, when the flames roared to life. Harry scrambled away from the fire, jumping to his feet. Draco walked through first, followed quickly by his mother, Narcissa Malfoy.
"Excuse me," the voice came from behind Harry, "do you work here?"
-Compliment him.
“No, of course not,” Harry replied. “The first night was some boy who likes to get spanked. Last night I heard the Wallbanger with some bloke who likes to be cuffed to the bed!”
“I know ‘Mione, I just needed a couple of days.” When she didn’t look convinced he offered, “I will go back to Hogwarts on Monday.”
Despite the request, Blaise whimpered, his body arching against Neville’s. Potter’s thoughts swimming in his head, mixing with his own,
Luna's nose crinkled, "No. Why would you put anything extra in tea? I meant your eggs of course."
Hermione looked up from writing down the answers. "I know some of them," she offered. "But I need you to describe it for me, that's part of the perception study. Please?"
Draco glanced around the kitchen again, looked at Harry as though he'd gone mad, and said, "Can you clarify what you mean when you say atrocious?"
They sit next to each other at a table with a handfull of Ministry employees. Hermione talks to them about the werewolves rights case they are working on, and Pansy strikes up a conversation with Draco. She tells him that Astoria is coming in after she gets off work from Flourish and Blotts.
Pansy cleared her throat and Harry looked up, but Pansy was looking at Draco. “Come on Draco, you wanted to do this,” she said.
“So what are you going to do with your life when you’re bored with entertaining your father?”
"I used to visit with her and bring her things I thought would help. Books, paint with canvas, apples. Things like that," Draco said. He took a deep breath, "At some point she asked me to call her by her given name so I did. Honestly, I haven't denied any of her requests since that day. Even though some of them are a bit…." He trailed off which made Harry laugh.
“Would you?”
"Turn around," Draco said, loving the shudder of Harry's body in response to the command. Harry complied, breathing harshly as he braced his forearms against the wall, head turned to look over his shoulder. Draco vanished his own jeans nearly desperate for skin to skin contact.
"Yes Harry, I will."
"Oh bloody-
“I’m here for a couple of reasons Potter,” she replied, looking around the hallway with her nose crinkled. “Do you have somewhere else we can talk?”
He flashed her an over the shoulder smirk, "I'm not saying anything."
“There’s a bracelet just like that one waiting in your room,” Draco said, “Scorpius can show you there. When you’re finished putting your things away, come down and have some chocolate with us.”
"Three fucking Gryffindors," Draco said quietly, "that's poetic."
Draco's eyebrows went up, "Why?"
Malfoy cocks his head slightly as though he’s considering her, the barest hint of a smirk on his lips. “You forgot to mention that he’s a ginger.”
, and was
❤️💖❤️💖❤️💖
Harry liked a broad stripe along his cock and swallowed him again, letting his throat constrict around the head of Draco's cock. Draco's fingers threaded into Harry's hair.
“Sorry,” the boy mimed zipping his lips and slumped back in his chair.
Harry stared at her as she walked away to view the duel between Hermione and Ernie, until Blaise came up beside him.
"He was sentenced to one year house arrest, two years probation, and magic suspension until completion of sentence," she answered quickly. "He is only allowed to leave the manor to go to the ministry so that he may meet with his assigned auror."
Potter walked out of the restaurant as though the issue was settled. Draco followed quickly behind him. "I don't even have my notes with me," Draco began, "and I need to do more research. I need to research more of the f- the research."
Blaise let his smile drop. He was missing something here, and he didn't know enough about Gryffindors to figure out what it was. "Something I should know?"
“Sweet Salazar Harry,” Draco says. He’s only said Harry’s first name a handful times and from the way it makes Potter’s eyes sparkle he suspects that Potter could list them off. “You’re doing this on purpose because I’m going to see her.” It’s not a question, he’s not subtle.
That drew Harry up short. "What does that mean?"
When Draco didn't reply Harry glanced back at him and was pleased to see heat and lust reflected in Draco's eyes.
"What are you doing Malfoy?" Potter said, his voice quiet in the empty hallway.
Harry stood and led Draco out to the patio, with Kreacher following behind them, carrying their drinks. Normally there was a sofa on the right side of the covered patio and a table for 6 with chairs on the left, with a plush rug in between them. However, when Harry opened the door to the patio he stopped short and stared dumbly at two large chaise lounge chairs he had never seen before with a small table in the middle.
Harry bit his lip as his mind offered up at least a hundred reasons why he shouldn’t, and said, “Yeah. Let’s.”
"I'm reading a story right now, and I'm not sure if it's a slash fanfiction."
Potter narrowed his eyes and replied, "Some of them look like you too, Malfoy."
Draco's eyes widened, thinking of Hermione's assignment. "I'm not sure it was on purpose," he said. Then, remembering they were supposed to be talking about a story, he added, "It's not bonding or anything."
"Come closer Potter," Zabini said with a feral grin, "I'll let you touch my sexy forearms."
Harry didn't move. He did offer a small smile when he replied, "Won't your boyfriend be bothered with finding me in here with you?"
Harry thought,
He cleared his throat, vying for a sense of self control, or maybe even authority. This was his house after all.
passed between Hermione and Zabini.
"Oh my God!" Astrid gasped, her hands jerking to cover her mouth and causing a bit of tea to spill over the rim.
Hermione nods and watches him walk to the bathroom. That was not the reaction she had been expecting. She starts to get that feeling again, the one she had through most of school. Harry Potter is up to something.
"Do you mind if we hide in here for a moment?" Potter asked. "That woman out there is a bit of a stalker."
Ernie nodded his head solemnly.
“It means,” Teddy said, his voice husky, “If you take me to your room right now I’m going to strip you down and make you cum in my mouth because I won't be able to keep my hands off you.”
Let me know what you think. Your comments are so encouraging!!
Zabini's arms tightened around the girl as he said, "It was a couple of 5th years. She got ambushed in the hallway. When Draco and I showed up the students ran off."
Draco thought, taking a small step closer. Potter stiffened but didn’t back up.
"I'm told he works exclusively as their Draco," Harry replies with a grin. "You must be in high demand."
"I will o' course," Ron said, "but I can't leave you two at Hogwarts without me," he put a hand on Hermione's leg as he said it.
"Is that what you're worried about?" Seamus asked. "I like boys."
Malfoy lifted a sceptical eyebrow and let his eyes fall over Harry's outfit again. "So, you're asking me to dinner so we can, what exactly, become friends?"
“I’m kinda in the middle of som-”
Draco looked the wand over then took it from Harry and cast, "Inlustris fabula."
Pansy made a show of huffing, folded her arms, and leaned against the doorframe so she was a bit to the right of Harry. This seemed to allow for more side-eye rather than her usual glare. Once situated she began the lecture, "This isn't about me and you. Draco has gone through a lot, Potter. This year is going to be hard enough without you driving him crazy at every opportunity. He needs to stay focused on school and keep his head down, not be lured into being tortured by you. I don't care that he wants-"
“Go home to your wife, Lucius,” Harry said, taking a handful of floo powder and stepping into the fireplace, “be happy you still can.” He threw the powder down and disappeared into the green flame.
Hermione’s eyes snapped up, sparking with revelation, and Draco’s blood ran cold. He recognized that look, it was the look she gave when someone showed up with a difficult problem and needed her help to do the research. It meant that she found something interesting, challenging, exciting
“You’re right,” Pansy said to Draco, “It is hard not to make fun of him.”
“5th year?!” Blaise broke in, “Is that true?”
"Yeah mate," Harry said, "come in."
“Merlin! How much time do you spend talking about my thoughts on Malfoy?”
"Not that I've heard." Pansy scurries back to her computer to look up the meaning online. "This says the cape jasmine symbolizes beauty, luck, and sensuality."
"You still hear his thoughts, yeah?" Draco asked.
One last thump, one last groan, one last whimper, then all was silent. Well, at least all was silent on from the neighbor. In Harry’s room a rambunctious kitten had apparently woken up enough to demand a potty trip and more playtime.
"So," Ginny said, tucking away a strand of red hair, "this is awkward."
Realization dawned on Draco’s face, "Yes," he said, his voice growing less shaky, "yes, of course. I should have thought of that." When Draco stood up he wasn't trembling, "May I use your floo?"
"Malfoy," Harry's eyes raked over the blonde. He'd never seen him in muggle clothes before. Draco wore designer denims with a dark grey jumper. He looked good. He looked like-
The moment Zach spotted Draco his eyes went narrow. "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" he asked.
"How would Draco benefit?" Daphne asked.
Harry helped him up and Ron flashed him a lopsided smile, pulling him into a hug. "Thanks for the help."
Harry scowled at the man, "Malfoy! I can't believe you agreed with him," he grumbled.
The waitress started putting food on the table and Harry was surprised that he hadn't noticed her approaching. Malfoy stared across the table silently as the waitress set down the plates. When she left, he said, "You've been listening to me?"
"Oh yes," Pansy said. "We read it a few times. Do you want me to share some of my favorite parts?"
Harry didn't reply, only blinked at the idea of Hermione talking to the Slytherin. A fresh smile was pulling at Draco's lips, and Harry tried desperately to keep making eye contact rather than letting his eyes drop.
"Oh, I'm in the middle of som-"
Harry deflated, “Fine. Yes, ok. I will see you when you get back. Good luck, of course, and let me know if you need anything.”
"Can we do that after?" James asked, a bit desperate to see his dad save the day again. The bubbles were swallowing him whole.
Hermione nodded, "Kreacher is bringing food up."
Potter looks around and opts to close himself inside the supply closet for safe-keeping just as Draco hears the sound of the door clicking open.
"I have so many interests because I get bored easily," Draco replied with a drawl.
Draco looked back and forth between them, his brows drawn together in concentration. "I-" he began hesitantly, but, finding he had no response, he fell silent, absorbing the information. Then he looked back to Blaise and said, "I don’t understand. I could easily describe Potter’s hair, and it’s no surprise he can describe mine. He’s known me since he was 11, he-”
Pansy blushed. Pansy Parkinson blushed. Harry’s brows furrowed at the sight, and he tried to remember if he’d ever seen a Slytherin blush.
Harry sighed, "It's cold, and I like this jacket." He pulled Sirius' jacket tighter around his shoulders.
Ron came through the doorway, stopping just short of running into Draco. "Oi! What are you doing in here?"
"Oh yeah," Harry replied. "This isn't run of the mill sweet sex. It's…" he trailed off, unsure how to classify it, "it's rough, and loud. I call him the Wallbanger."
When he first broached the idea with Ron and Hermione they had both been hesitant, concerned that Harry was trying to drop off the map of Wizarding London. He’d explained that he just wanted to get away from the weird hero worship, but had no intentions of bailing, and his friends had let up. By the time his move in date arrived they were more than happy to help him transport his belongings.
"Oh," Neville said, he was looking at Zabini with an unreadable expression. "Why? Are you interested in-"
She flipped to the back of the book to see if the index had more information about Dementors, as she was fairly certain these were the creatures that her Dad had encountered. Instead, her eyes landed on the term 'Death Eater'. There was a picture next to it, a tattoo on someone's arm. She looked it over closely and realized why she recognized it, she'd seen the faded symbol on Draco's arm the first time they met, and again at breakfast when he was wearing a short sleeved t-shirt.
"He's not a Slytherin, he's a capybara" Hermione said, sounding uncomfortably similar to the headmistress. "I don't think you're allowed to do that, Harry."
Harry leans against the bar edging in a bit closer to Charlie. "It is. They were all terrible chaperones."
"I am in charge of the theme and I like this one,” Pansy said. “The party is in two days. I had to make a decision!”
"Would you like to make the front page?"
Or chat with me on Instagram @dracos.tealsuit
, he thought.
"Mmhmm. And an interview."
Draco is saved from answering that Confringo by Pansy, who opens the door to the Leaky and insists they both come inside. He has a good feeling about tonight.
“Hello?” Granger replied expectantly.
Draco didn’t know what she was about to do but he knew that he wasn’t going to enjoy it.
A suppressing silence filled the hall, the two of them staring at each other as Harry's heart beat so fast it felt like a wild snitch in his chest. Draco wore a black button-down Oxford with a leather jacket. He had on a pair of distressed dark blue jeans that hung low enough on his hips that Harry suspected they were spelled to stay up. The outfit was topped off with a pair of dragonhide boots that were mostly black with hints of green on the scales.
Harry hummed in response and looked at the shop as well. A few more feet and they would be at the door. He cocked his head a bit and said, "Could you say no to me then?"
"Oh, hello," Harry said from the doorway of Dean's room.
“Babe,” Neville said, causing everyone to turn and look at him with varying degrees of surprise. Neville’s cheeks went pink but he didn’t look away from Blaise. Instead, he stood from the bed to walk closer. “Why don’t Harry and I go to breakfast? You two can probably have a more honest chat without us here.”
Unsure of how to proceed with a greeting that indicates ‘i can’t be disrespectful to you because you saved my life, but I’m not sure where we stand with each other,’ Harry gave her a careful nod, “Hello.”
"Draco," Hermione squeaks out.
Harry pulled his wand and squared his shoulders. He then placed his right foot behind him, lowered his center of gravity for balance and looked across the mat at her.
Harry huffed and rolled his eyes. Lately, he only saw Draco for crossover meetings at the Ministry. It was easy to forget his tendency to speak like a pretentious prat outside of work. Draco's potions company worked in close relation with the Auror department. They supplied emergency healing potions, polyjuice, veritaserum, and a handful of other special needs potions.
"There's a few first years in Ravenclaw who brought them to one of the House Cooperation meetings." Pansy tilted her head as though considering something, "So technically it's your fault that Slytherins got exposed to them."
Signed,
The door opened. Neville walked in dropping his bag and school robes on his bed, closest to the door. "Hey Blaise," he said.
Harry cocked an eyebrow, "It's a wonder you and I can fit in any room at the same time Malfoy. Yours has always been bigger than mine."
"Yes, perfect!" Draco replied, "Let's send him an owl after breakfast."
Luna giggled, “The guy next door is a dom?”
Draco leans back against the cheaply made booth he's been sat in for their time together and looks at Potter. He lets his eyes drop to linger on Potter's pouting lips for a heartbeat before saying, "Has he?"
Potter lifted onto his shins and hopped up. "Malfoy," he said, with a quick nod. Draco gave a nod back, as his eyes dropped down to see that Potter was wearing charcoal-grey joggers.
Harry angrily shoved in between them and got right in Zach's face. "Fuck you Smith! You have no right to have any opinions about him or the war!"
"Weasley," Draco said as he grabbed an apple and two pieces of bacon, "how would you like to go on a day trip with me back to England?"
Looking back to Pansy with a smile playing on her lips, Hermione said, “Sorry I interrupted. You’re right, of course. However, Harry probably doesn’t even own anything that Malfoy would approve of.” She lifted her eyebrows and blinked slowly.
"But you call him Teddy. I know you do Draco, he told me himself."
Harry leaned around the doorframe to see Neville looking flushed, his lips tilted into a shy smile. "I have some every flavored beans if you're feeling lucky."
Comments and Kudos are ALWAYS appreciated. Thank you for reading!
"I'm late on purpose to avoid other students. Is this apple for Malfoy?"
Nope. This was definitely worse.
“Fuck,” the word came out from Harry as a soft whimper before he pulled Draco in for another kiss.
Blaise went last, spinning the bottle with ease, expecting it to land on Draco. He'd played countless rounds of this game in the Slytherin dungeons and the bottle always seemed to land on Draco. The bottle slowed, nearly landing on Potter, which caused Blaise to tense up. He absolutely did
Astrid blushed furiously, thankful she was alone in her room.
, playing through his mind like a mantra.
Hermione stared at him, her mouth slightly open, as though he were offering the last drop of water in the desert.
"I thought that would help you feel better about me moving into a Muggle neighborhood,” Harry replied with a smile.
"Nothing," he said, too quickly, looking at the floor "I just…. I haven't seen him since…" he stalled out.
Both boys looked at her then, each with a lifted, questioning eyebrow.
I hope it's worth it. Love you fandom <3
An hour later, Harry sat with Dean and Seamus at Papadom, the closest Indian food restaurant to Lovegood's house. He cast a Notice-me-not charm as Dean spread out the plans of Malfoy Manor onto the table.
Malfoy’s eyes narrow and he keeps them steadily trained on her face without replying.
Harry's eyebrows shot up. "What?!"
Harry glanced at Blaise, who lifted an eyebrow at him.
Anna looked up at that, her eyes narrowed suspiciously, "You're lying," she glanced at Harry, "Do you know what it's from?"
She finished sealing the parchment and set it in her school bag. “But,” she said, looking up at him, “I don’t know. We’re just all so young and I, well, to be honest, I think I might be attracted to women.”
Harry grimaced, "Well, obviously. Hermione is smarter than everyone though. I'd be dead if it wasn't for her."
"I think we're getting close, should be just another level up." Teddy was excited, James could tell. It made him feel special, being the one Teddy wanted to share this secret with. James gave the house a silent
“I was rather hoping for tonight since our earlier dealings were interrupted.”
This time Harry let his eyes move to the man in question, the bitter fearful words Lucius had spoken rang in his ears. He remembered how fast his own heart was beating and the desperation in Lucius’ voice when he told Draco that they could regain their favor with Voldemort.
@dracos.tealsuit
Harry heard the man chuckle and then he heard the door close.
*Death Eater definition comes from:
"Come on. I mean, is there a stereotype the character is missing?"
Harry tried to think of a response to that, and he's confident he would have had one, except Draco took that moment to step closer and Harry couldn't fully remember what they were talking about.
“I shudder to think what you could possibly mean by that,” Blaise said.
The other upside of his new room became apparent after he'd been sleeping there for a week. It was convenient. In fact,
"Who did this to you?" Harry asked, his temper flaring.
"Merlin," Potter says, slipping a hand under Draco's shirt. "I swear I'm addicted to you." He captures Draco in a fierce needy kiss and starts to walk them through the hallway to the lab in the back of the shop.
hitting on you," Potter says, fierce and possessive. Draco feels a thrill go through him at the words. He likes that Potter desires him enough to be jealous.
Harry laughed, "No," he said. "Quidditch is the answer to all of those questions. I mean it. Get her on a broom, you can thank me later."
An hour passed while Harry sat with the group of eighth years, sharing stories from the summer and learning about everyone's room set up. Neville was roomed with Blaise Zabini, who had already started trying to persuade Neville into more stylish clothes. Hannah was with Hermione and the two of them had spelled the large mirror in the room to show their class and homework schedules. Terry Boot was bunking with Ron, they had plans to set up a betting pool to see if Terry could beat Ron at chess before Christmas break.
-and then return to repair a hallway and 3 classrooms before the beginning of the school year.
Harry hadn't slept without Draco after that night.
When they are both put back together with cleaning spells cast, Potter lounges on Draco’s bed watching him get ready. Draco can see him through the reflection of the mirror, raven hair even messier than normal and an easy smile on those kissable lips. Draco looks down to do up the buttons on a teal Oxford, and says, “I think it’s time for us to have a real conversation about the Granger situation.”
"What? What interview?" Harry asked dumbly.
"I wanted to look nice for the party."
Harry looked at the gargoyle for a moment, then down at the paper in his hand, sighed, and said, "Elder Wand." The staircase appeared and he took it to the Headmistress' office. When he entered he looked around, noticing McGonagall standing behind her desk with Professor Loire standing next to her.
Scorpius shrugged and gave an apologetic smile, "She was up at 7 sending me messages about books." He motioned to the 3 piles still on the floor, "I'm guessing you went through something similar in the forest with Hermione?"
Late Sunday morning Harry pulled on his comfiest denims and searched for a t-shirt that wouldn't cause any arguments. It was always like this when he was planning to go to the Burrow. He had shirts from every major Quidditch team, and signed jerseys from several players, but he needed something neutral. With Ron's loyalty to the cannons and Ginny recently signing with Holyhead, Harry knew it would seem like he was choosing sides if he wore anything branded. Finally he located a dark green shirt, with the word "Seeker" written across the chest in black cursive, and pulled that on. Once he was finished he scooped up Orion and headed through the floo.
"Weasel," Draco said with a curt nod.
Draco smiled then, a broad smile that Harry had never seen before. "Why are you doing this? Surely you must see they are right, that we are a bad idea." Even as he said the words his leg slid up against Harry's inner thigh.
When the bottle stopped spinning it was pointing at Neville Longbottom. Neville, who didn't seem to be breathing, stared at the bottle for a full minute before finally raising his eyes.
After a thorough investigation, I submit these findings to the Unspeakable Department.
Hermione looked at Harry, "Care to add anything to that Harry?"
Harry purposefully cleared his throat. When Pansy looked back at him, Harry cocked a knowing eyebrow. Surely she wouldn't pass up the opportunity with Ginny, which meant she would have to let him through.
Draco cocked his head, then bit his lip, trying to decide his next move. He watched, fascinated, as the Chosen One stared at his mouth. Draco let the teeth drag slowly across his bottom lip, leaving it red and plump. The space between them felt thick like the space between magnets.
"I have a question," Blaise said to Harry. "If you're willing."
“No time, I can’t be late for my date with Granger.”
Thank you so much for the encouraging comment and kudos!! They mean a lot to me 💕
Ron gave him a calculating look, one that, Harry suspected, was used during interrogations. "Has he kissed you?"
talk about this. He tried to make the rest of the question come out, but all his throat could produce was a self-pitying groan. Orion came over and hopped up on the chair next to him, snuggling himself in between the plush cushions and Harry’s leg.
Draco loves Pansy.
"Hi there," she said with a grin.
If he didn't get release soon he thought he might actually pass out. "Neville," he said, pushing his words out, "if you don't let me leave I'm going to-"
"I just can't believe that someone so disrespectful still has a job," Potter says, yanking the bill from Draco's hand to smash in several bills of various color.
The two Slytherins left the room and Harry took a deep breath. He hadn't realized the air was so thin in here.
"Wait," Pansy held up a hand to stop Harry from replying. "Am I to understand that we are taking this seriously? That the Savior wants to date Draco?" she asked Hermione.
She set down her stuff and opened the wardrobe, then cast a cautious look back at Scorpius before she stepped inside.
Hermione was quiet for a moment then picked up a quill and piece of parchment and started walking across the library. Interest piqued, Pansy set down her book and followed Hermione over to the table where Ginny sat with Luna. Ginny looked up when they reached the table and smiled at Hermione, "Hi, 'Mione."
and let go of the wand which followed him around the room, lighting his path. He quickly changed into the t-shirt and flannels that he'd dropped earlier and slid into bed. Once he was comfortable he started to pull the curtains closed.
“Er… ok? I’m not really sure I will have time, but I will try.”
the job is perfect for me?”
Blaise left the common room and started on the long walk to the greenhouse. He was pretty confident that the Slytherins were all delusional.
Swinging his bag over his left shoulder Harry said, "I don't know. Probably about Malfoy being a git."
"Hello, Anna."
"You're an exception," Draco replied.
Harry shrugged, "I um… freed a dragon. Really it wasn't me, I just helped." Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Draco smile.
She opened a drawer and pulled out several pieces of parchment and placed them before Harry. "These are letters from all of the surviving members of the DA."
“Pansy?” Hermione asked with a small smile.
"That you can't say no to."
He made his way to Diagon Alley. There was a large group of friends waiting for him at the Leaky Cauldron. He had wanted a quiet birthday celebration at the Burrow but too many people had asked for a party. Eventually, he'd caved and let George plan a big bash.
Please leave me comments if you want to make my day!
“Ron said, and I quote, ‘You're a frigid bitch. I bet you can't even get a date for Harry’s event without paying for it.’ They were his parting words.” Hermione leans forward to put her elbows on the desk, folding her hands in front of her. “I can’t think of anyone I could bring that would upset him more than you.”
Thank you to windowcracks for recommending this tag!
"I've always been pretty Potter, you're just oblivious." Draco wants the words to come out mocking but his breath catches at the end when Potter's hand makes direct contact with the skin on his abdomen.
Consequently, he was late for Defense Against the Dark Arts. Again. He was seven minutes late, which was better than yesterday, when he had been nearly 15 minutes late after hiding out in the loo to avoid a 4th year trying to feed him suspiciously homemade cookies.

Harry looked over the girl behind the counter, Anna. She had an emo cut to her bangs and wore thick purple eyeliner. Harry had met her a month ago when he first came to the ice cream shop. He passed over payment, and said, "Do you think this ice cream will be enough to seduce him?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked just as expectantly back at Harry, reached out his hand and said, "Wand?"
Blaise, who hadn't looked up from his book until now, said, "Well, that was educational."
Harry shudders. “Draco,” he pleads, leaning up to kiss him, to maon into his mouth, “Please, fuck, I need-”
Harry paced McGonagall's office for seven minutes before Professor Loire shot a tripping jinx at him.
Ron looked disgusted by the idea. "What?" he asked after swallowing his food. "Why the hell would I do that?"
Harry let his eyes drop obviously over Malfoy, taking in his lips, broad shoulders, the exposed forearms, and the fingers wrapped around his fresh water glass. He looked back up to meet Malfoy's eye, "I haven't forgotten anything. But the war is over and you've always been able to get my attention. Just seems a bit different than it did in school. I suppose I thought it might be the same for you, yeah?"
Harry quirked an eyebrow at that but didn’t say anything more than, “What kind of non-profit?”
"How fun!” Blaise said, his eyes widening as he leaned forward.
Teddy gave her a nervous smile and then looked to Harry for guidance. Harry shrugged looking just as confused as his godson. Teddy looked back at Astrid and said, "OK…. Just don't take anything out."
Harry read the letter with a frown on his face, "I see," he said, looking at his cousin, "and now you need my help?"
"When did you get so bloody fit?" Potter asks, fumbling with the buttons on Draco's shirt.
“I tried that already but you’re welcome to have the argument with them,” Potter says with a wave towards the kitchen, “if you think you can get further than I did.”
She lifted a sculpted eyebrow at him, "Oh Potter," her tone dropped suggestively and she smiled, "that's not true. I framed the picture of us from the paper," she said and popped a raspberry in her mouth.
' and '
Harry shrugged, "She doesn't know about last night, but she's figured out how I-" he cut himself off biting into his cheek.
George slowly cocked a red eyebrow, shifting his eyes from Draco to Potter and back again. "How about you tell me what you're looking for-"
Harry sighed, they were right, he needed to calm down. “Yeah. All right, I’ll be back before the next set,” he said, and gave Hermione a brief shoulder squeeze before he left.
“Holy gods," Draco said, breaking the silence. "I think I’m dating Harry Potter.” He sat down hard on the bed. “I can't believe this. I’m dating the fucking Savior of the Wizarding World.”
She stared at him for a moment, as though he were a fascinating display at a museum, then turned to Hermione and said, "Draco was just as bad, maybe worse."
"Oh," Hermione said, looking between the two of them, "right."
"Yes well, weasels attract fleas."
In walked a pretty girl with purple streaks in her hair and thick black eyeliner. “Anna,” Draco whispered, taking in the site of her apprentice robes. He reached forward to grab the framed picture of her artwork and shoved it into the top drawer of his desk.
"You shouldn't have done it in the first place," Ginny said, seething. She stormed up to Harry, grabbing her wand, and left the room. Dean and Seamus trailed after her, shooting Harry grateful smiles.
“Um,” he said. This was not something he said very often. Even though he was raised with softened standards compared to the stringent traditions of his Father’s generation, there were some things that didn’t change. Bottom line, Malfoys do not say ‘um.’ So, it wasn’t surprising when Draco stopped talking and everyone in the kitchen turned to look at him. Scorpius picked up the invitation and handed it to Harry who stared at it, speechless, before handing it to Draco and dropping his face into his hands.
Luna smiled brightly, reached forward and squeezed Draco’s hand. After letting go she turned back to Harry and said, "You must go to the emporium on the 14th," she said, buzzing with excitement. "They will have Merlin Falcons for sale!"
"Break it up," Potter said, pulling Neville away. He glanced back at Draco and added, “I’ll have Kreacher bring up breakfast for you.”
Anna briefly glanced at him, then rolled her eyes, "Mate, we already have you as a customer. You're not going anywhere." She turned back to Draco and leaned close to him, "Besides, I really want to see this one come back. Here," she said, slipping the punch card into his shirt pocket. It caused his shirt to open further, exposing his collarbone and a pale scar that started just below it.
“Malfoy,” Boot said, not raising his eyes from the paperwork on his desk, “have a seat.”
Draco slips his wand back into its holster. "Indeed." He was at a complete loss. This whole thing was going to blow up in his face. It already had.
Harry had been looking over the Manor plans, adding his own notes and recommended adjustments as he went. He wasn't caught completely unaware, even while focusing on the plans he'd been listening for when the water shut off so he would know when Draco was done showering. But he had not been expecting to hear the sound of the floo bursting to life. When he looked up to see who was coming through the green flames, he certainly hadn't expected to see the tall imperious form of Lucius Malfoy.
article about me last week.” He said, remembering Pansy’s words. Draco blushed faintly before he dropped the letter and pushed the papers aside as though it were a pile of trash.
"Fuck, please," Harry says, surprised to hear the word come from his own mouth.
"Looking for Narnia."
Through it all, he had made time for Draco. Their bodies intertwined, their magic sparking and blending, communicating for them when the words became too much -too little- to express emotion.
, he thought, a bit desperately.
“What is that?” he asked.
Scorpius cocked an eyebrow at the performance and looked over at his father, who was wearing the exact same expression. They exchanged a quick glance before looking at Harry, who had pretty much melted.
He must have made a sound because Pansy looked down at him, having significant height from her position on the desk, and said, "Oh don't look like a kicked puppy. You have nothing to be jealous over. I'm sure many a wank has been blessed with thoughts of Draco Malfoy. A clothing line is far less scandalous."
Hermione pauses in her stride to the office. "Flowers? From who?"
"Harry!" Hermione jumps up to wrap him in a hug.
"I believe that it's good food," Harry replied, trying to keep his tone casual and block out thoughts of who Malfoy would be meeting at the Double, which he knew to be a fairly popular night club, "but it's not really the atmosphere I usually choose for a-" he cut off the word
Then Draco drops to his knees and takes Potter into his mouth, worshipping his cock until the only words Potter can say are '
They both glanced back to where Draco was looking around the kitchen as though he were taking a measure of the places worth and finding it lacking.
Draco drops the file, pulling his wand, in one fluid movement. "What the fuck are you doing?"
Blaise was certain those two hadn't spoken since the start of term. His mind filled with curious thoughts about what this meant, and he had a hard time deciphering his own from Potter's.
“How did you get the password?” James asked, hoping to distract himself. “Was it in the letter?”
Draco took a sniff and then a small sip from his wine glass. “This is a good vintage, the elves must know your address.”
“I’m not sure that I’m the best person-”
Blaise smirked down at him. "Not bad Neville," he said, with another quick kiss to his bottom lip.
Blaise shrugged. “He does have a great ass.”
Harry sighed, "Yeah. I didn't- I mean- are you and Dean," he trailed off, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his denims. "Is Dean here?"
"You're being condescending," Potter replied, running a hand through his mess of dark hair, "though I'm not surprised you don't know the difference."
Also, if there are any tags I missed that you are really wanting addressed you're welcome to suggest them!
"Are you just blatantly trying to get a good view of my ass?"
Harry tossed himself on the couch next to the fireplace. He was happy for her, and proud of her for finding a way to help her parents. His thoughts traced back to the day Hermione had stolen her parents memories, and then his mind started to push other painful memories forward. He stared at the wall feeling a wash of grief hit while his mind assaulted him with images of the people who were gone.
On his way there he spotted a flash of white blonde hair. He immediately changed course, looking for it again, but the colored strobes weren't helping. Eventually he went back to the loo. When he came out Draco was there, waiting for him.
Professor Loire struggled down a laugh, turning her eyes toward the ceiling to search for something less amusing. Harry sent her another dirty look.
"Lucius," Harry replied, matching his tone.
"We've already tried
Astrid noticed her eyes were getting a touch blurry and pulled the book a little closer. She was laying on her stomach in bed reading through
Pairing: H/D T/J and S/R
“Think what?” Draco said through clenched teeth, cutting her off. “He’ll think ‘Draco Malfoy is up to something,’ is that what you were going to say?”
Harry managed a self-deprecating smile. “Again, I wish it were that easy,” he said, not fully evading or answering the question.
Harry could see exactly where that was headed. He sent back an owl stating they would have dinner at 5pm and then Harry would be busy the rest of the night, so they would have the place to themselves. In return, Ron had a box of chocolate frogs sent to him from Honeydukes.
“Yes love?”
"Because Draco told me that you're being irrational and that I can't let you blow this."
This was a hard chapter to write, but I think I got down what I wanted to. Please let me know what you think if you're so inclined :)
“The shower,” he repeated slowly, “were you- are you a client?”
Draco chuckled, “We will have to introduce you to Mrs. Granger, I think you two will get along very well,” he said. “For now though, Scorpius, do you want to field some of those questions for her?”
He sat himself in the chair across from Hermione's desk and recounted the tale of the Wallbanger. He left out the details of the last two nights, choosing instead to end with, "and that's why I'm here. Because if you don't help me, I'll likely end up in the Janus Thickey Ward."
Harry smirked, "You know my team is full of half bloods and muggle borns, right?"
Harry turned as he responded. "Sorry, I-" he'd meant to say more but found himself forgetting the question when he looked at the man before him. He was tall with white blonde hair artfully tousled into an on purpose messy look, some of it falling over bright silver eyes that had so much life in them since the war ended. Harry's mind stalled, unable to remember what the question had been.
"So what, I'm just going to go along with this? And you're ok with that?"
Potter shrugged. “He asked me to stay out of it. I’m just trying to keep my mind busy so I don’t interrupt.”
"I don't really want to work with any other students," he said. Then, as Luna's face became concerned, he quickly added, "Just, it's the hero wor- it's too much attention. You know?"
