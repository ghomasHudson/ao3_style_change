“Let’s not split hairs about leverage,” Draco said loudly, then, “That play last night, Hamlet. That really got under my skin, and I can’t stop thinking about how you should do that. Not only for me I mean, for everyone.”
Draco had apparently been working himself up to something and cut across him without seeming to realise it, “Harry Potter. Would you like to have dinner with me? Tomorrow night?”
“I’m Theodore,” Theo’s hair went pink for just a moment, then shifted back to a turquoise that matched his jumper.
Draco wanted to go to bed straight away. Harry followed him to the bedroom and got into a borrowed pair of pyjamas while Draco washed and cleaned his teeth. Harry went into the bathroom next, and when he returned to the bedroom, Draco was already chin deep in his big white bed with Shadowfax purring loudly on his knees.
Harry pressed his lips together, “Okay, that’s adorable. I can’t look at you doing that too long; it’ll do something to my inside. Right, I’m going to go and hide. No peeking!”
“I’m not gone,” Harry protested. “I just. Don’t get out much. And besides I wrote two books; isn’t that enough of a presence? Malfoy, are you trying to tell me that you’ve missed me?”
Theodore toed a loose thread in the rug, “Something about not wanting me to make a mess on the carpet, I think. I’m not going to make a mess,” he added. “I’m not a baby.”
“Well, yes they talk, but it isn’t a friendly chat about the horrible weather. Please trust me that you won’t like it.”  Theodore nodded again and went tiptoeing off to find a bathroom. Harry decided it would be rude to laugh and had his own wash at the kitchen sink before turning his attention to supper.
Draco was waiting for them already when they reached The Leaky Cauldron. The pub was crowded and noisy, but he’d managed to stake out a table near a window, where he was sipping a gillywater and looking rather ill at ease. He was wearing blue robes again, a deep teal instead of the navy blue robes he wore to work. His fair hair was pulled back into a loose half knot, and a bit of it had come down in the front. He was toying with a strand between finger and thumb, and it made him look young and rather nervous, and not for the first time, Harry was struck by how unguarded he was.
Draco shook his head, “I shall be too warm soon enough.” He stroked his cat absently, with a sort of air as if he’d rather be pacing the room, “It’s definitely going to startle you. You can’t think what it’s like before you’ve seen it. You’ll be a bit shocked. And it does hurt. A lot. At the beginning. But the instant it’s over, it feels wonderful. So try not to be too alarmed.”
Harry let go of Hermione, “Right, okay. So Malfoy’s a werewolf, and Theo, his cousin who he doesn’t really know is as well, and Theo’s boggart is a werewolf, and Malfoy just sort of turns up at my house to help me sort out the monsters and things there. It’s an awfully big coincidence, don’t you think?”
“Well she needs to get over herself,” Harry muttered. “But I reckon it’s my responsibility now, as I’ll be looking after him. I told him that’s not what werewolves are like straight away.”
“I’m not hungry,” Harry said hastily, catching eyes with Ginny. “Thanks, though.” He took the seat Luna’d brought him after she regained her own.
“Inside this little cat-sized basket? No, actually. This is my Great Auntie Ursa. Shadowfax has just popped to Pret for some snacks, and she said she’ll meet us here, so look out for that.”
“Do you have to embarrass me in front of her every single time we’re in the same room together?” Harry said to Ron.
“Of course,” Draco returned the kiss. “Thanks for letting me bring Shadowfax. She’s very attentive while I’m transformed, and I think she’d get a bit upset if I wasn’t around.”
Draco tilted his head toward the door Theo had vanished through, “That dad thing. Tidy your room and do your homework and all that. So responsible.”
Malfoy flinched and the remnants of his high, angry colour drained from his face. With a prickle of guilt, Harry recalled what he’d said to Theo about triggers.
“Well,” Harry said slowly. “Erm, there are people in the world who don’t like gay people and try to make things difficult for them and even hurt them. And that makes a lot of gay people want to be very careful about who knows they’re gay. Oh, so as well as not asking people if they’re gay, if someone tells you that they are, you shouldn’t tell other people without permission, all right? That’s very important.”
“If a bacon butty is the best example of your cooking skills you can manage, you may be a weaker cook than you seem to think, Potter,” said Draco, but there was no heat in it.
Draco withdrew his hand from Harry’s arm slowly with a curious expression as if he were checking himself, “I’m sure you will, Theodore. Very responsible of you.”
“Yes, you’re fearless and smart and funny and talented and. Really handsome. I noticed that ages ago. Obviously. And then I saw your face on that fucking Witch Weekly cover that fucking Astoria showed me, and I about fucking vapourised.”
Ginny glared back, “Touchy.” But she did return her attention to her pudding, muttering inaudibly to Luna, who kissed her on the cheek.
“Hmm,” Harry set the food and drink down on the coffee table and came over to have a look at the pile. “Well what do you fancy?”
“Thanks Molly. Here he comes,” Harry pulled his head out of the fire and stepped back for Theodore. “Aunt Molly’s going to put us up for the night, all right? I’ll have a poke about tomorrow and see that there isn’t anything else in the house that shouldn’t be there while you’re at school. Go on through, and I’ll go back to your room and get your things for school and be with you in a minute. Is your school bag packed or is there something I should look for?”
Theodore pushed up his glasses, “Thank you. Erm. I think I want to go and sit with my friends again, okay?”
Draco frowned, “This won’t do at all, Potter. It’s a rough life out there for people like us, and my cousin is going to need all the support he can get.”
“We have a process that lifts the charm that makes them move and speak, and then we destroy them,” Draco said, coming to a stop beside the fireplace.
Harry raised his eyebrows as he pulled the door shut behind him, “You walked? I thought you lived in a big family home out in the country.” He waved his wand to lock the door and raise the protective wards. “Although I suppose I remember you saying something about Hawthorn Court, now I think of it.”
Shadowfax had emerged from her basket and sprung onto Draco’s shoulder, while he had his back to the bed to speak to Harry. She was a lithe little thing, the colour of a cobweb with huge, round yellow eyes that seemed to be unusually reflective, as they shone even in the slight dimness of the bedroom.
‘Yep. Nazis believed that North Europeans were superior to everyone else. They hated Jews, the Slavs, the Romani … They decided some people were subhuman, that’s how they called them, and set out to exterminate them.’
‘I promise you, the palace won’t forget the kindness you’ve shown me,’ Malfoy told the beaming ladies from the door. Harry shoved him out of the store, his mouth twitching.
, or lament that he hadn't had the chance to hold a naked person in his arms before he'd need to face Voldemort. He longed to know how touching and being touched
Browsing for a jacket of his own, Harry listened to Pauline’s efforts to strike up another conversation with Malfoy about his royal family and prayed he wouldn’t fuck anything up.
They raced for several miles neck and neck until the fishing villages by the coast appeared in the horizon. Draco led his horse to a copse of trees and dismounted.
They stopped in front of the arched windows facing the oak, and through its branches, the pub. With a precise movement of his wand, Draco broke a dusty glass pane, which fell with a faint clink on the ground. The smell of green leaves rushed in as a cool breeze whistled through the oak. Conversations and laughter drifted from the pub, becoming louder when the door opened. They had to hurry; Draco murmured a spell, and the paper crane sailed across the square and over the heads of the leaving patrons, darting inside.
She might not have liked the look of them, but the accent worked on her as it was meant to. Accents of privilege had their own magic in the Muggle world.
Grey light woke Harry from a cold, troubled sleep. He took stock of his body before he got up: his head was heavy, his muscles ached, his stomach was seriously empty. He felt colder than he’d ever felt in his life, a chill under his skin that he couldn’t shake off. This was how it would have been if Hermione hadn’t packed her beaded bag with all the essentials. He felt a sudden pang of nostalgia for the tent, a palace compared to this musty ruin, what with the beds and blankets, the hot shower, and the woodstove.
‘You what?’ Harry turned, regretfully putting an end to the delicious rubbing, and caressed Draco’s hair. The silky strands looked silver in the night. ‘I—’
Draco didn’t have to say it; Pansy’s eyes shone with understanding. She looked at her hands, and Draco changed the subject. ‘Blaise was an actor in the Muggle world. Can you imagine?’
‘Two teenage boys and you can’t seem to track either one of them down! The Malfoy boy especially! A spoiled, spoon-fed, coddled brat!’ He spat the words, each one a lash.
Potter’s eyes widened almost comically. ‘Seriously?’ He stared at the Shack, presumably trying to figure out what Draco saw in it. ‘Did your father lend you the money?’
His apologetic pout was the most adorable thing Draco had ever seen and Harry could have all the fucking towels in the entire fucking Manor. Draco tried to steer the conversation back to the interesting part. ‘You said something about preparing yourself?’ He glanced around the room and saw on the bedside table, right beside the forgotten textbook, a tube of lube. Industrial size.
it.’ Another brush, lingering. His hand sought Harry’s erection, and he pressed his knuckles against it, while he nosed down Harry’s jaw, his mouth seeking the tender spot under the ear. ‘And you won’t admit it.’
Harry’s fists itched to teach the rich brat a lesson, but he flexed his fingers and restrained himself. He wasn’t the first toff to shit his pants and try to overcompensate for his powerlessness with empty threats and mocking words.
Draco’s skin smelled of the soap they shared. It was really warm in the bathroom, the air steamy and hot and stifling. Harry chose a long, narrow plaster and applied it to the lowest part of the cut. It looked like a crooked, elongated Z, or a constellation, like the ones they had to study in Astronomy.
Draco runs a hand over the smooth surface of the Succubus’ curves, her wings and curled tail, and the little bump at the bottom of her feet. Harry had named her
. Aveline gave his ancestor nine children, who all lived. Miraculous, in those days. Not so if they had Creature blood in them.
They looked at each other, aware that their story wouldn’t hold up to the mildest of probing. Malfoy had also tried to talk about the palace last night, but Harry had kicked his leg under the coffee table to shut him up. They’d told enough lies as it were, and Dawn was sharp.
‘Nah,’ Potter stopped in the path. He scuffed the toe of his boot on the frosted ground. ‘I’m just trying to summon my “legendary” courage.’
They ordered a carafe of wine and a platter of cheese and grapes and the more they talked, the more Harry felt entranced by the man. Salazar exhibited a wit that entertained Harry. His sharp mind was accompanied by sensuality in the way he licked his fingers after bites of cheese. Harry’s desire for him increased as the night progressed, every muscle tense with the effort not to jump over the table and kiss him.
Alone in the cold room, Draco pads to the wall and checks his genealogical tree. Like Granger said, he’s not a full Incubus — the actual son of a Veela and a vampire — but merely a descendant of one. He’s entertained the thought for a while now that the Creature ancestor must have come from the Black side of the family — he likes to think it’s what named them Black. It’s an idle thought, but tracing the gold thread with his finger, he finds what he thinks is confirmation.
The lady seemed impressed by his outright condescension, confirming that he was truly of his class. However, she still seemed wary. Her eyes kept straying from Malfoy’s bloody shoulder to his robes. ‘Are you from London?’
‘Draco never paid any attention to history. Terrible student,’ Harry said quickly. He laughed. Ha. Ha.
Look at him now. Instead of ruling the magical world, Draco is sharing accommodations with a fifty-eight-year old Muggle. Life has swept him from promised glory to a plastic chair in a foul-smelling corridor surrounded by sick people. Illness has a taste that makes him break out in hives; as Incubus, he doesn’t get sick now, but he can sense disease. It helps him avoid feeding from people with chronic conditions, who’d be severely affected by the draining of their energy.
‘Let’s go to Hermione,’ he says, which must be Potter’s first reaction to any problem. His utter confidence in her capabilities instills some hope in Draco.
‘Very funny.’ Harry punched his arm, annoyed — but also relieved — and got out of bed. His face heated up as he stood starkers by the side of the bed. Presenting himself in the nude to Draco’s interested gaze felt more daring in the daylight. He dressed swiftly, and Draco’s expression changed. He turned his back and rummaged for his own clothes.
Salazar’s eyes heated up and he shakily undid his trousers. Harry knelt on the dirty cobblestones and touched Salazar’s cock. He wished he could see it properly, but the lane was dark and their corner darker. So Harry explored it with his mouth, running his tongue along the shaft and slowly sucking on the head. Salazar moaned loudly, which excited Harry. He took the throbbing cock in his mouth and sucked it with much enthusiasm. Salazar tugged Harry’s hair and stilled him, and when Harry looked up, he started fucking Harry’s mouth with his cock.
‘The only thing he rewards is cruelty and blind obedience,’ Draco murmured, lost in thought. ‘And that’s if you don’t make any mistakes.’
‘Mine is inconsequential. It doesn’t feed me or affect you. Bring your mouth back here.’ Draco latches his lips on Harry’s again, sinfully hot, and Harry loses himself in the kiss and his fierce, questing hands. Draco’s bucking against Harry, breathless already, making mewling sounds of need.
. The thought made Harry breathless as he fucked Draco harder with his fingers, slick and hot and snug inside his arse. A tremour travelled over Harry’s skin, desire rising like the tide, saturating every part of him with one, urgent desire: to enter Draco. Smearing oil on his cock, he settled between Draco’s knees and pushed in, holding his breath as he breached Draco.
. If he’d had any doubts about his sexuality, they’d be gone now. Harry pressed his eyes shut. What was
The polished front door opened to a bright hallway. Chirping and fluttering came from the room on his right. Draco peeked in and let out a stunned gasp.
Malfoy didn’t reply. He threw the last few pieces of bread in the lake, and turned to stare at the distant cottage. ‘You think those Muggles are really dead?’
Harry left the changing room with relief, his pulse racing erratically. He nodded to Pauline, ‘Sir asked for a jacket’, and made a hasty selection before he ducked inside the curtain.
‘Tinworth isn’t your real destination, is it?’ Draco leaned on the trunk of an oak, his face shuttered, his voice toneless. ‘You’ve got to find your friends; carry on with whatever you’ve been doing. Which you keep a secret from the likes of me.’
Draco rolled his eyes and watched as Blaise approached the Ravenclaw table and the two students who’d been arguing. No idea what he told them, but the argument stopped and Blaise returned wearing a smug smile.
Draco pushed his hair back. ‘I’d like to apologise. For that day, when you tried to help me get up. I felt ashamed by what had happened, and I lashed at you, and I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have.’
Harry couldn’t take his eyes off him. Draco made the most arresting sight: sweaty-haired, cheeks hollow, lips red and slick, lying between Harry’s open thighs, sucking him off. Blistering heat spread from Harry’s groin to every nerve ending, and he couldn’t hold his climax back. ‘I’m—
? Why couldn’t the Lis have asked him to seduce some other person, someone bland, someone whom Draco could shag perfunctorily and extract the figurine from, before walking away unharmed? Draco drops the noodles in the broth, raging with impotent fury at the Lis and Potter and himself and even Nariyoshi’s stupid, ailing kidneys.
— the males — and Succubi — the females — are offspring of vampires and Veela, two species who have been mortal enemies since time immemorial. Romantic affairs between the two species are illicit and condemned; imagine Romeo and Juliet—’ She notices the uncomprehending expressions of most of the company and waves a hand.
One of the advantages of being part-Incubus is the ability to enter and influence the subconscious of others at will, feeding from the sexual energy released in erotic dreams. It doesn’t provide the same nourishment as real sex does, not even close, but nor does it affect his… (‘prey,’ his mind supplies)
‘And I think it’s no coincidence we tracked them both in this area. I reckon they might even be together.’
As soon as he’s up, Draco can see something’s wrong. Potter grabs the table, his knees unsteady. His skin is almost as pale as Draco’s.
. They see in them their husbands and their sons, their brothers and their fiancés, volunteering their time and effort to make their convalescence easier, while praying someone else is looking after their own dears, whether in earth or heaven.
Three faces stare at him. ‘Malfoy,’ Weasley starts, not precisely friendly. ‘You look—’ He glares at Draco and comes out with ‘…sexy.’ His cheeks swiftly turn as red as his hair and he clasps his mouth while everyone else bursts in laughter. ‘
‘You forget I have this.’ Harry showed him the Invisibility cloak and winked. Draco wondered why he ever complained about Potter’s rule-breaking tendencies. It was surely the best thing about him.
Harry steps closer. ‘I can’t get nearer than this—’ he approaches about two feet away ‘—without feeling a vibration that presses right into my brain.’ He glances at Draco. ‘Four of us are working on this. None of us could come as close as you have.’
, that’s all.’ She must notice Draco’s lack of comprehension and continues. ‘It’s the most powerful shield in the world. The right incantation can connect it to a household — any group of people — and it’ll absorb all Dark curses or hexes aimed at the family or tribe. It’s the ultimate protection.’
Esther’s sleeve had risen when she reached for the yarn, showing a tattoo. Harry froze when he saw it. He looked at Esther’s face. Of course. Fifty-odd years ago she’d be in her early twenties.
He hadn’t expected that waking next to Draco would be an issue. When they’d discovered the one bed, Harry — busy with thoughts of the war and his friends, exhausted by their troubles — had failed to anticipate it’d be a problem.
As they entered through the back door, the smell of meatballs wafted from the kitchen and Harry resolved to make every minute in this cottage count. Even if that included chores. Harry found that he didn’t mind doing chores when they were assigned with a kind smile and followed by hearty meals.
Oil was sought and found, and soon Draco had one finger inside Harry, biting his lip as he watched Harry writhe. ‘You’ve no idea how glorious you look,’ he said with a careful brush of his finger against Harry’s prostate. Harry arched his back, floundering in an arousal more powerful than he’d ever imagined. Back in London, he’d fucked men in alleys and molly houses, in cheap hotels, and always in secret. He’d never been laid out on a carpet to be offered so much pleasure by a member of the aristocracy. He’d never met a man like Draco, so beautiful and so… unreal—as if Harry had made him up. If this was a dream brought on by hunger, the cold and his imminent death in the forest, then Harry would take it. He spread his legs wider and welcomed a second finger, slender and nimble, insistent and playful, making him see stars.
Relief flooded through Harry, and he flopped back on the pillow. That owl had made him jumpy. If he carried on like this, he’d have a heart attack before the Dark Lord got a chance to do him in.
Draco pushed his head under the spray and stopped listening. A lead weight wrapped around his heart, dragging it under the mire of his bottomless regret. He splayed his palm on the tiles, staring at his fingers, and tried to ignore the niggling feeling of being an impostor. A fraud. Tears ran down his cheeks, luckily invisible to everyone else. He wanted nothing more than to be who they thought he was, but he should have known better than to assume the absence of the Mark solved anything. What good was it to have a different past here when he
Draco freezes, then shakes his head with a huff of laughter. He resumes laying soft kisses on Harry. ‘You should be a detective.’
Harry had to fist the sheets, tendons straining, to stop himself from coming immediately. The sensation was so different than a hand. Draco’s mouth was so…
‘Hey, do you wanna pair up for today’s lesson?’ Potter said, opening the door to the humid greenhouse filled with chattering students. ‘Ron and Hermione always pair up and I end up with Neville and he talks my ear off about the classification of each plant and their Latin names…’
‘Harry…’ Draco stretched out his hand and touched his cheek. He examined Harry’s face, a look of disbelief and wonder dawning in his eyes. ‘Harry, did you—’
‘Probably not, so I will tell you.’ Draco smirked at Harry’s groan. ‘It’s similar to Aurors and Dark Wizards, you know?’
‘It’s infected,’ Harry replied. ‘It happens with wounds when they’re not cleaned properly. Especially if they’re deep. We need some disinfectant.’
, Harry. That’s what I am. I take and take, and sometimes — sometimes it’s hard for me to stop. And you make it
The relief at being offered a shelter, somewhere warm, somewhere protected, moved Harry deeply. ‘Thank you,’ he said, his heart brimming with gratitude.
‘It’s a clear ink based on lemon.’ Draco explained, pouring more soil on the parchment. ‘Pureblood kids use it to write secret messages to their friends. The lemon makes the ink sticky, so if you throw some powder over it…’ he blew gently on the parchment and shapes appeared. ‘The powder sticks to it, and you can read the message.’
Putting all thoughts aside, his scar prickling subtly, a reminder of doom that almost never went away these days, Harry gazed at the empty pillow beside him and wondered where Draco was. He was about to close his eyes, swallowing his disappointment, when the door opened.
Draco huffed loudly, interrupting him. ‘Look here.’ He pointed to a neat row of bushes, circling the edge of the property. Its blossoms looked familiar. ‘This is St John’s wort. Good for banishment, among other things. We’ve used it in Potions.’
‘Sure.’ Startled at Potter’s abrupt interruption, Draco follows him to the back of the room, relieved to be away from the conversation. They spell the darts to play at High Stakes (Erratic and Poisonous) and spend a large portion of their evening there until the others join them to watch the game.
Harry and Draco had to get out of there. The fire reached high over the church’s roof, throwing sparks, turning the evening into day. Anyone looking out of their window could see them. Their purpose had been achieved: letting the Death Eaters know they were both in Tinworth, drawing them away from the north of the county and from the cottage in the woods.
Malfoy brings the drinks over, heads turning as he passes through the crowd. Seems it’s not only Harry that finds him irresistible to look at.
‘I’m going to try and make it to Tinworth,’ Malfoy said, balling up the wrapping. He tossed the ball in the nearest bin and gave a small smile when it landed neatly inside. ‘It’s a wizarding village in Cornwall. There’s bound to be someone there who can fix my wand — or at least, a second-hand wand shop.’
. It’s relentless, unstoppable, and Harry gasps and moans as Malfoy fucks him hard. Harry’s cock slides hot against the bed and he bites his lips and fists the sheets. Saliva drips down his mouth as Malfoy bunches his arse cheeks and spreads them wider.
He wondered if Malfoy would throw it back in his face, the way Harry had with the chocolate. But Malfoy, unlike Harry, didn’t let his pride override common sense. He murmured thanks, unwrapped the pasty, and bit into it while Harry sat on the next bench, eating his own and sipping from a bottle of orange juice. His shopping had left him with about three quid. That was nothing to go on in the Muggle world.
‘Draco,’ Harry said softly, brushing his knee against Draco’s, ‘look at me.’ When Draco did, red-faced, Harry said, ‘I won’t hate you all of sudden because I remembered the insults you hurled at me or my friends at school. I haven’t
“It looks nice in here,” Theodore remarked, wiping Floo ash off of his glasses with his shirt tail. “Granny said it was probably still a bit horrible, but it seems all right.”
Harry did not laugh, but it wasn’t because it didn’t occur to him, “What would you have done if I’d been busy?”
Draco harumphed and Vanished the slimy handkerchief before lying down with his head against Harry’s chest, stickiness be damned, “I want to tell you something. You’re going to think it’s because of the sex, and it isn’t, and if you say it is, I shall turn you into a frog.”
“Who’s Malfoy?” asked Dudley over Ron and Hermione’s sounds of surprise and dismay, which promptly turned to laughter at the question. Dudley looked at Harry, “What’s so funny? Who’s Malfoy?”
Theodore looked hesitant, then nodded, and Harry hugged him tightly and patted his shoulder, “You’re safe, okay? I’m not going to let anything hurt you.”
Harry screwed up his face and started drawing long breaths in through his nose, then looked up at Draco, “I have to see them all. Responding. All at once. It’s not like that with books. I have to watch them forming their impressions right in front of me.”
Draco reached out and took the basket, which he held up in front of his face to speak to Twinkle, “Don’t worry now. You’ll be on the train in a moment, and then at least you won’t be swinging about like this.”
“Oh, he was like a lot of things.” Harry drew a deep, thinking sort of breath and leaned against the back of the settee, “I think he must have been a lot like you actually, when he was a kid. I think he was a lot like you were at Hogwarts.”
“Yeah, suppose so. Sorry, I should have. I should have asked you first, shouldn’t I? It just seemed like the moment for it, so I said it.”
Draco was curled up half under the covers and rather twisted up in them, clearly still quite nude but with the essential bits mostly covered. He had his eyes squeezed shut and there were tense lines in his brow and around his mouth. “I forgot to get my potions out before I came down to transform,” he murmured faintly. “Your fault. Too dishy.”
Harry laughed, “Of course.” And he ungloved Draco’s hand and tucked it into his coat, against his heart.
They stepped out onto the gravel of what appeared to be a small islet in the middle of a vast lake, huge enough that tiny waves lapped against the shore. Harry could hear the cry of  water birds in the distance and thought he could even see a ruddy glimmer of vanishing sun near the horizon. Most of the light was coming from live fairies, flitting low enough for them to see each other’s faces clearly. The air was sweet with heather.
“All right, my little prodigy,” Harry said, stifling a laugh. “We’ll be late for Draco, come on now.”
“I thought I’d send Theodore through now and then nip back to his room and get a change of clothes and his school bag.”
“Same thing this time,” Malfoy murmured when they’d joined hands in front of Regulus’ door. “But this time when you feel the ward, release it.”
“Right, I know what the word means, but I’m really stupid with fucking at the moment, so you’ll have to just say what you want.”
“The curse is like a trap,” Draco said. “Cursed objects aren’t discharging significant amounts of magic at all times, only when they’re tripped. And even so, it takes a very powerful wizard to cast a lasting curse on an object. It’s even harder to cast a lasting curse on a person.”
“Good to be here. I’m grateful for you, and I know Daisy is as well. It’s nice to have a big family, isn’t it?”
Malfoy’s lip twitched, “I’m a cursebreaker. I’ve been engaged to inspect the house and help make it more safe.”
The revelation fell rather flat. Dudley was not familiar enough with wizarding culture to understand the significance. And to Harry’s profound annoyance, Ron and Hermione exchanged oh-dear-well-we-knew-it-was-coming looks.
Originally, I lived with this journal attached to myself, one way or another. Mostly held with both hands, sometimes tucked against my stomach, sometimes under my arm… I’m frankly still a bit leery of letting it out of my sight. Theo and Millicent have sworn to keep an eye on me now that I’ve switched linking objects, and know where to find this journal should the ring somehow not prove effective enough.
They’ve put in a report with the Aurors, so I suppose eventually you might learn about it, though I doubt you’ll be allowed on the case if only because Ronald is aware of our relationship and wouldn’t let you get away with that conflict of interest.
Draco’s side of the walk in closet was bare, and Harry stumbled a bit on numb legs as he made his way to check Draco’s bedside table, his foot catching on the corner of something mostly under the bed. The bedside table was empty of the pot of hand cream Draco had kept there - devoid of potions manuscripts and Draco’s favorite bottle of lubricant, no Italian leather house slippers tucked beneath - save for a box of disposable facial tissue in the top drawer, and a layer of dust.
He glanced around, saw the bare spots on the walls and on the mantle. “I haven’t checked the kitchen, but he might’ve done?” he spoke as though it were a question.
His stomach gave a nauseous swoop; rather like the sort experienced when a broom malfunctioned at a great height in the air and began an uncontrolled plummet. “Not well?” His hands clenched in the plush material of the throw. “What-“
Gregory is happy for me. He came over and fed me a roast beef and vegetables. We talked about work, and avoided talking about the curse.
Harry thought he ought to remember, with as many times as Draco had fire called over to Blaise before things had got… weird. “I don’t… I can’t remember.” His brows drew together in bafflement, and he stared at Hermione, almost hoping she might have a technique to stir his memory.
Why was I not surprised to return home to a note informing me you’d be at the Burrow for dinner, and staying late? These Sundays, like clockwork of course, but I’m usually the one home late, well after you’ve gone to bed.
You’d think, living with a professional Potions Master, you’d be easier to dose on schedule at home, but you would be wrong. Why are you such a baby about taking your potions? You know they’re Healer prescribed, you know I’ve had a hand in brewing at least 80% of them because they’re more specialized than Pepper Up, and you know I’m quite skilled at measuring out dosages, but no. I’m aware that the textures and tastes are deplorable, but their purpose is to heal. If they were all easily palatable we’d have problems with people over-dosing, because people have ridiculous preferences when it comes to foods and I guarantee there would be some imbecile who’d take a bloody spoon to an entire case of burn salve if he discovered it tasted of Havarti (
Merlin, Draco had left him. Harry’d been a shit boyfriend and Draco’d had enough and Draco had finally left him.
Before you ask, it’s because he waved me over to his desk to pull out the work order he’d written up, as well as the one he’d been given, without having the decency to leave them somewhere reasonable (they were crumpled up in the pocket of last week’s day robes, which he’d left hung from his cloak rack just inside the private office that came with his promotion).
He checked in the bathroom, next, and realized it was nearly barren. Their shared tube of toothpaste was still there, but there were no toothbrushes. His own, he knew, was in his leather duffle, still in the entryway. The hand soap was also there, and a hand towel, but none of the things Draco left behind even during away trips remained: his full sized bottle of cologne, his aftershave, his expanded line of skin and hair care products – he had a miniature kit sized version of his preferred staples and left what he considered bonus products at home. A shaking hand lifted to tug the medicine cupboard open, and his stomach somersaulted, finding a still nearly-full stock of standard household potions and healing swabs, but none of the oddly specialized selections Draco insisted on keeping on hand were in evidence.
Harry just stared at her helplessly, a high pitched whine swirling through his head, jostling his thoughts out of order and leaving him confused and afraid.
Sorry. My head’s not in a good place right now. I miss you. I’m worried about you. I’m upset that your department thought contacting you before your medical leave was over might be an acceptable thing to do. My arm hurts, and my head hurts, and not literally but certainly figuratively my heart hurts for wanting you right now. Not for a tumble, but perhaps for a cuddle.
I have some of the best friends in the world. There are no words to describe how glad I am that they all managed to escape being Marked. Pansy and Millicent were the least at risk, as witches, but the risk was always there. Their parents weren’t mad enough to place them in such a position, in any case. Blaise was occasionally at risk, it depended on who his step-father was at any given moment. I understand his mother wasn’t terribly keen on the torture and murder and mayhem and lipservice of Pureblood superiority while tearing nearly as deep a swath through Pureblood families as he did Muggleborn, Half-Bloods and Blood Traitors. Theo and Gregory, though, were more at risk than the others. Neither of their fathers were as power hungry, or as great a failure, as my father. Vincent… well, Vincent never made it, did he?
Draco put down his bag, set the basket on the bed, and opened it, “This is Sirius’s room, isn’t it?”
“Because you put your pride aside and asked him to!” Ginny insisted. “And don’t discount what you’ve done yourself, Harry!”
Luna returned to the table, dragging a stool for Harry, “I think we have a couple of rock cakes leftover from tea yesterday.”
Harry sank into his own bed a very few minutes later, grateful for the sleep that was rising quickly to meet him.
“I think you contradicted yourself,” Draco dropped into a desk chair and rocked it from side to side as he spoke.
Harry woke suddenly, his heart pounding and pushed himself to sitting, reaching automatically for his glasses and his wand. Mrs Black’s portrait was shrieking about half dog brats, and he thought for a moment that she was the source of the disturbance, til he heard again the sound that had woken him. The wordless, terrified scream of a child. Harry kicked aside his blanket, sprang out of bed and made for Theodore’s room at a run, his wand at the ready.
Harry could feel something rushing over his hand, so like water that he almost wanted to check and see that his hand wasn’t actually wet. But he remembered Malfoy’s instruction that eye contact was important, and he kept his eyes fixed on Malfoy’s clear grey ones. Presently the rushing feeling of the dissolving ward subsided. The latch on the door clicked softly, and the door opened.
The Saturday before Theodore was due to set off for Hogwarts, Harry took him to St. Mungo’s to visit his granny. One of the courtyards at the hospital had been turned into a garden for the patients to take sunshine and air in, and there was a special nook of it arranged for spattergroit patients and their visitors in particular. Spattergroit remained contagious by touch for months into the recovery, so in order to enforce physical separation without tedious protective protocol, the needed distance was built into the garden.The patients sat on park benches on the shores of a tiny island in the centre of the garden, and the visitors sat across the surrounding moat on their own benches.
They went to Flourish and Blott’s for Theodore’s books first. Theodore got very caught up in reading his books right there in the store and had to be gently prodded up to the till and reminded that they had several other shops to visit. Draco bought him a handsome set of quills and paid extra for an Anti Borrowing Charm.
“I mean I don’t like. Erm. I want to be called Theodore,” Theo insisted. “But you can call me Theo like Harry does, if you like.”
Harry gave him a little nudge, “Something like that, but stop making me laugh or I’ll never get through it.”
” the branch grew as the voice spoke, already it had wrapped itself around Malfoy’s hand and began to creep up his wrist. “
“We should have breakfast,” Harry announced. “I’ll bring you something.” He stood up and paused, “Erm. Would you like me to bring you some pyjamas?”
Kal fanned himself with one hand like he thought he might faint, “Oh my goodness! Isn’t he just the loveliest person you’ve ever met? He teaches one of our Potioneering seminars, and everyone adores him!”
“I don’t suggest you set fire to anything inside your house. Nor anything out of it,” Draco added hastily. “Not unless it’s in a fireplace or something, and you must certainly have your godfather’s permission first. No, although if you did set fire to the portrait, it certainly wouldn’t be on the wall anymore. You have me there. But what we’re going to do is,” Draco held up the knife he’d shown them before.
“Because,” Draco said soberly. “My family and I have not been very nice people. We’ve done a lot of things wrong, and lots of people we used to know don’t wish to know us anymore.”
Harry put his cup down on the table, “Well, because there’s no need for you to and because. I don’t want you to. There may be something that would frighten or hurt you, and I don’t want to put you through it.”
Harry had worked diligently with the school and with Theodore himself to come up with a transformation plan and they’d been over it together at least half a dozen times, so the answer came almost automatically, “You’ll have your wolfsbane potion every night the week of the full moon and spend the night of the full moon in the hospital wing until moonrise. Once it’s clear you’re not going to transform, you can go back to your common room or what have you. If you do transform, you can stay in the hospital wing until morning or signal to Madam Pomfrey and she’ll send for Hagrid to escort you onto the grounds for some fresh air.
“I can use the owls at school. They have them, you know,” Theo said patiently, as if he was the one with years of Hogwarts experience already under his belt. “Or Godric.”
“As a matter of fact, I have. A lovely grey cat that looks like she’s made of spiderwebs. Shadowfax.” Draco paused, then added lower as if he couldn’t help himself, “‘The bond of love is strong between us.’”
Ron swept up toward the front to unlock the shop door, “Well, they’re more like cursebreakers. They sniff out Dark objects and curses and hexes and Dark creatures and clear them out of your house. After the Ministry seized all those old Death Eater houses, they started popping up as contractors. Ask Dad; he’ll know all about it.”
“Absolutely,” said Malfoy, giving the box a sharp jab with his wand. “I’ll need to put a protective charm on it before transporting it.”
“Twinkle will be fine to go in ahead of you,” Draco said smoothly. “But if you like, I can take her ahead and show you. You can follow just behind.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes up at the ceiling, “‘Dear Potter, What sort of person did you grow up to be? Are you still insufferable? Personally, I’m a werewolf now. Hope you’re well. Cordially, Malfoy’”
“Well that was a waste of an afternoon,” Malfoy griped as Harry followed him through the Floo back into Grimmauld Place some hours later. “You might have just given me the dittany yourself and saved us both the trouble of a visit to St. Mungo’s.”
“What sort of godfather would I be if I didn’t see that you could keep your things tidy without magic? Put your bag in your room, please Theo unless you want to do your homework before you have your tea.”
He poured himself a drink, and held up the bottle, “I suppose you don’t want any? I think you said wolfsbane makes the hangover a lot worse?”
“Don’t bother; let me send you to mine! Muggle hairdressers are where it’s at, Harry. You still in that tiny flat here in London?”
“No,” Harry smiled. “Well, we’ll try not to make a habit of it and get ourselves in trouble, but I don’t see the harm tonight. Go on, then. I’ll be in with the food in a bit. Best have a wash before you get settled. Your face and hands are filthy from the Floo. Know where the bathroom is?” Theodore nodded. “Good. Mind you be really careful in the corridors so you don’t wake up the portraits. I did it last time I was here, and it scared the pants off me when they all started shouting suddenly.”
“Good,” said Theodore, an expression of beatific satisfaction falling over his face. “I bet it helps you loads.”
“Yes, I’ll know you, Harry. I’m still in my right mind; that’s the point of the wolfsbane. Only er. Certain elements of my personality will be more. Forefront. Nothing dangerous, only a bit annoying if you’re not feeling erm. Snuggly. Don’t mind me, only shove me away if you need the loo or you want to be alone or something. I won’t be offended.”
But it was no good. Draco’s great, beautiful, backlit head came nosing into the wardrobe, parting the robes to zero in on Harry and darted a warm lick on Harry’s cheek.
“I haven’t seen Greg in years, actually. My best mate’s name is Astoria. Astoria Greengrass. She was in my house, but the year below us. You’ll like her. She’s always been much more decent than me. She helped me get my head together after the war.”
It was a very, very jolly Christmas. And all too soon, it was over and done with, and Theodore was on the train back to Hogwarts, leaving Harry alone in Grimmauld Place again. Harry found it almost unbearably quiet. He even missed Twinkle. He had to take to leaving the telly on to keep himself company. Fortunately, he had foreseen his gloom and planned a special date with Draco to lift his spirits with both companionship and smugness. Draco had been asking about going to see a play together, and Harry had finally managed to book tickets to a production of Hamlet.
I would ask if there’s been something I’ve done to upset you, but that seems highly unlikely as I’d need to be able to interact with you some way other than notes left on the breakfast table in order to do so.
Work’s been shit. Still doing the bulk of the brewing. I come home for dinner, then go back to get more work done. Makes it easier to fall asleep afterward, gives me less time to obsess over how shit my life is right now. It’s helping me get this ridiculously long back log of brewing taken care of. My head still hurts, and now every throb reminds me that I am hated.
The book Hermione had given him, that had been just supple enough to stay put on his bedside table and hold his glasses safely overnight.
What are you doing, Harry? Where have you gone? Will you be safe? Will you be careful? Do you have anyone to watch your back? Do you trust them?
we use something entirely different for internal burn injuries, there’s a reason the salve is for external use only and not used on children).
What the bloody fuck are the other potioneers doing with their time? Vane seems to be spending all of
You did seem keen on the idea of a reward if you take your potions without too much fuss tomorrow, once the Thomas's have returned home.
Should I be pleased that you think this home enough that you’re content to leave your laundry to me? That you haven’t simply cleared your belongings from the property and vanished?
Harry had missed Draco. And he’s not sure how things had gotten so hectic that he’d first managed to spend a week away from home without leaving the country. But it had happened once, and then it had happened again, and then he’d been out on assignments and then he’d been in Mungo’s and he’d thought he’d at least see Draco there during one of his visits but he never did, somehow.
He accepted the book and gripped the covers, but hesitated to open it. He knew he should read it, and he didn’t want to be alone when he read about how angry Draco was with his behavior. Draco was one of the most articulate people Harry knew, and would carve into people with surgical precision when upset and on the verge of losing control. Harry didn’t think he was quite prepared for that, but he also knew this wouldn’t get any easier by waiting.
Hermione’s stolen one of your hair ties, and Molly has stuck with one of our earliest link attempts, a “friendship” bracelet with some of your hair woven in. She actually came here to craft it at your bedside, her collection of embroidery thread and a weaving board in a basket while Pansy selected a few strands of hair from your brush. Because it’s Molly, it’s more of a “friendship cuff” than a bracelet, but it’s quite lovely, if I may say so. She made it in shades of blue and grey, with ripples of palest yellow. Once she’d completed her own, she made a series of quick and dirty bracelets for the rest of the family.
Harry, but only in the way any intelligent pre-teen wants to permanently damage a fellow schoolmate; knowing it was unreasonable and not something I would like the actual consequences of (personally, socially, emotionally). More than anything else I just wanted Father’s approval, so I did what I knew could please him. Or attempted to.
Apparently you’re home now, and by home I mean somewhere in Britain, because you’re sure as Merlin not in our house. I suspect you’re out somewhere with Weasleys but I can’t be certain, because I’m not getting a response anywhere, be it Owl or Floo, and only a fool sends a Patronus when you might be enjoying yourself around Muggles.
with you? I’ve just got home from your Muggle grocer, at your request I’ll remind you, to pick up your favorite biscuits and office tea sachets after my own long day at work, expecting to find my recovering partner lounging on our loveseat while allowing what few brain cells he has to dribble out his ears while he zones out to the tell-E, and instead I’ve found a virtually illegible note informing me you’ve been called away for an overseas operation with no end date offered.
You’ve done it now, you stupid wanker. Have you any idea how much of my Blood Replenishing stock you’ve managed to burn through tonight? You promised you’d wrapped up all of your cases, that you’d be making dinner and setting some aside for me for when I got home in the middle of the night. How do you think it felt to wrap up my decanting tonight only to be informed on my way to the Floo that you’d come in hours ago and tomorrow’s brewing would have to be delayed to make time for more Replenishing because an Auror operation had gone bad? And wasn’t it nice that there’s really only been one serious casualty, but oh dear, I didn’t see you there Mister Malfoy, I’m sure Harry Potter will be fine, isn’t it nice that your team wrapped up on Replenishing and we had enough to keep Harry Potter going while the Healers worked on purging that nasty tangle of curses from him?
I don’t care if I’m being petty right now, my arm and head still hurt and you’re still not here, you stupid Gryffindor.
Gregory is also faring well. You’ve probably heard about his work from Neville, and I haven’t much to add I don’t think. He’s happy to be working for Neville, and they’ve long since worked out the baggage from their school days. Gregory’s always had great respect for Neville’s work in the greenhouses and in Herbology, of course, anyone with half a brain cell quivering in their skull understood the boy was born to work with plants. Anything you’ve heard from Neville about work probably goes for Gregory as well. He’s still single, but happily so, and fending off Neville’s attempts at setting him up with Cho’s friends with good humor.
Those scones you made last week were divine, by the way. Blueberry maple, if you don’t recall, with little bits of some sort of nut you chopped too finely for me to identify. I expect you got the recipe from Molly, although perhaps it came from Aunt Andie, instead. As much as Molly loves to feed the family, Andie is quite partial to finger foods; I think it’s a compromise between her more privileged years and her mothering years. I don’t think maple syrup is something Molly particularly favors. Regardless of the source, though, I’ll have to put out a note with a request for more, since you certainly won’t notice my approval in here, you overworked sod.
If nothing else, I know you’re well and loved and with family. Perhaps we can celebrate the holiday when you get back from your trip to Romania. I hope we can.
Draco ignores him. His hair falls on his face, his voice husky. ‘It’ll feel good, I promise. I can give you the orgasm of a
Draco hauled him back onto the path towards the opposite direction of where Harry had thought the cottage was. Cold sweat ran down Harry’s back when he realised how far into the woods he’d gone.
Draco lingers in the empty room, relief flooding through him. He picks up the figurine, wraps it in the velvet cloth and Levitates it to a Ministry worker waiting at the door. Outside, the casino is a sea of scarlet uniforms, upturned tables, people under Incarcerous. Weasley fires out orders as he co-ordinates the raid he’d planned with Draco.
No trace of ambition remains in Harry’s body. He has no desire for the city. He can never run again, so the jobs he’d wanted are out of the question. Not to mention the tremors and the dreams and the shivers. He’d be bringing the war to Ginny, fouling her sweet life with the poison he carries within. The idea alone is enough to make him choke.
. The lads are stripping it as we speak; cannons and plenty of gun powder. Cook found roasted fowl in the kitchen, we’ll have a grand meal tonight. And coffers of gold; no idea he’d had so much money.’
Malfoy bites his lip and takes a deep breath. ‘So I wondered if – if you have any bad dreams, ‘sall.’ He picks up his pint with shaky hands, looking vaguely furious, as if he regrets spilling his dark secrets to Harry.
‘And I’ll be your Watson,’ Draco says, gasping as Harry reaches lower between his legs. ‘I’ll live with you in a cottage and call myself Bob, and write books about Harry Potter and his adventures.’ His eyes flutter shut as Harry strokes him harder. ‘We’ll live by the coast and take long walks during the day, and at night, you’ll come into my bed —
‘Noooo,’ he says, shaking the corpse as if he can stop what’s happening. ‘No, not an Inferi, who did this, who
‘We don’t normally have a fry up in the mornings,’ Esther explained. ‘But you look like you haven’t had a proper meal in a while.’
The next morning, the expensive car rolls up the drive. Its chauffeur jumps out, takes Draco’s valise from his hands, and opens the door for him.
you to pieces. One peep from you from now on, and you’re history. There are no other paintings here for you to hide in.’ He stands. ‘Oh, and another thing. If you breathe a
. He’d had fantasies about Cedric and Bill Weasley in the past, but seeing as they were both straight, Harry’s fantasies had felt harmless; an idle exercise, a private unreality he liked to spend some time in. But now Harry had fantasized about someone who lay beside him and confessed to liking boys, too. Someone who Harry could reach out and touch, and who might — the idea made Harry’s blood simmer —
‘They get it so wrong.’ Draco sits beside him and offers the tray. ‘Eat it, it’ll do you good.’ He’s added lots of salt in the soup; it does wonders to alleviate energy draining, a vampire told him that.
. Harry tried to remember what he knew about UK geography — not much — but Malfoy recognised the name, explaining its link to the Arthurian legends. ‘We’re in Cornwall. Is that where you wanted to go?’
Bob raises his head and smiles when he sees that it’s Harry, but there’s nothing joyful in that smile.
Harry chanced a look behind him; Rookwood had turned towards his left. ‘What’s this?’ He’d thrown the owl away somewhere, but he waved the wand in front of him, murmuring several Revelio spells. They revealed nothing.
A cold burst of wind disperses the clouds, allowing the Crow Moon to shine pale light at Knockturn Alley, where people up to no good prowl in the shadows. Draco passes his old hunting grounds: the sleazy clubs; the corners where sex is available for a few Knuts; the alleys where one can rut on someone else and part ways without knowing their name. Every place he made someone come so he could feed the hunger inside him.
He was already breathless and exhausted, brought close to orgasm and tortuously held back from it, when Draco lined himself up and pushed the tip of his cock inside Harry. For the first time this evening, Draco’s face lost some of its composure, his mouth pressed down on a snarl, eyes shutting. Holding his body rigidly in check, Draco opened his eyes and slid deeper inside, and Harry moaned. He liked to be filled in. He loved to feel
‘You’re late, sleeping beauty.’ Esther sat by the kitchen window with a cup of tea. It was drizzling again and a gust of wind rattled the glass, but an Aga warmed the room and the smell of fried eggs, mushrooms, and tomatoes filled the air.
He ran out of words but didn’t need to finish. Draco grabbed him, arms wrapping firm around Harry. Harry held tight, savouring Draco’s summer-storm scent, his familiar warmth. His heartbeat thudded against Draco’s, a small symphony of life, while the night whispered around them.
‘I… guess? Aurors and Dark Wizards, Wizards and Muggles, there are loads of them. But the most popular game when we grew up was Harry Potter and the Dark Lord. All the kids loved it. One would be Potter and the other would be the vanquished lord. I always wanted to be Harry Potter, and I mostly got my way.’
.’ The murders of Beth and Pauline had proved that all too well. ‘There’s so much at stake, and he’s so,
‘Go on then — if you’re so sure you can deliver me. Press that fucking tattoo on your arm and he’ll come. You’ll be with your parents again. Wouldn’t bet on how long.’
Pansy peered in his eyes. ‘Draco, you need to stop having so much sex, I think it’s addling your brain.
Draco faced Harry, allowing him access to the hurt shoulder, but Harry’s eyes fell on the long, thin scars on his chest. He froze, unable to look anywhere else but the white, raised skin crossing Draco’s chest and flat stomach. He realised he’d been staring, but the reminder of almost killing someone stopped the words in his throat.
Harry said nothing. The vision flitted in and out of his mind, pulling him back to Voldemort’s brain. Briefly, he closed his eyes: an announcement to the Malfoys that Dolohov and Rookwood were out searching for their son.
? I see,’ she said, raising an eyebrow. ‘And what if I told you we have someone who’s willing to pay ransom for him?’
Draco had made a rather big fuss about this room, insisting the builders finish it first. The grey curtains were a slightly different texture and the armchairs blue velvet rather than leather, but the bed was the same. He’d made certain.
‘Harry?’ Urgent, clipped vowels, insistent at his ears. A cool hand shook his shoulder, hot breath played on his cheek, and the smell of lavender tickled his nose. Without thinking, Harry raised his head and pressed his face at the source of the lavender smell, inhaling deeply. Dawn’s fabric softener brought him slowly back to himself, and he opened his eyes to see he had his nose buried in Draco’s shoulder.
Draco whistles as he takes the pieces of Mrs Hollingbray’s vase and places them on his worktable. Alone in the workshop, he takes his wand out; it saves time. He casts a spell to maintain the gold-dusted lacquer at the right consistency and another that holds the shards in the right shape, so he can see where the seams meet before he glues them together. It’s a methodical, meditative task, and his mind strays to last night’s dream.
This Harry worried too much but, thankfully, he resumed his attentions to Draco’s body again. ‘We ran inside the Shrieking Shack to hide and, as I closed the door behind us, you pushed me against it and kissed me. Like this.’
This has all gone so very Hogwarts so fast that Harry’s not sure how they got there, but it doesn’t stop him from saying, ‘You’re confusing reality with your prison fantasies.’
‘You don’t understand,’ Draco interrupted, voice flat. ‘You think I’m exaggerating. If you knew… Last year I almost—’
his face buried in a book. At the sound of the curtains, or perhaps Draco’s very audible gasp, he blinked.
‘Is this real?’ he murmurs, and the man hears him and lifts his head. His smirk is as familiar as it is unexpected.
Neither of them spoke while Harry cleaned the long cut, touching it softly with one hand. The other hand found its way to Draco’s bare waist, for balance, as he drew Draco to him to reach the back of his shoulder. Draco breathed heavily and for a brief moment — so brief that Harry thought he might have imagined it — he laid the side of his head against Harry’s.
Weasley, however, seemed unaware of any bad blood as he joked with Pansy about Saturday night. Two badges gleamed on his uniform: Head Boy and Captain of the Quidditch team.
It’s June, not that anyone would know it. A cool spell has kept the patients indoors, their walks around the gardens brief. Some patients leave — Finnigan “to his mam’s nagging,” and Boot to his sweetheart’s arms — and others arrive, sometimes missing a limb or two. Harry prefers to sit by the lake alone, even if it’s cold. Ginny’s been writing to him all this time. They said they’d get married after the war, but he can’t bring himself to look forward to it. He likes her. He enjoys spending time with her. But he doesn’t love her, at least not like a husband should.
Potter didn’t say much during their walk—which was a relief—but he glanced a lot at Draco, which wasn’t unusual, although the way Potter looked at him these days was; full of curiosity and interest.
Harry fumbled for an excuse. ‘I’m worried about my friends, ‘sall.’ Draco scoffed in disbelief, and the sound managed to dredge out the simmering rage and worry that Harry had suppressed these past four days. ‘Last time I saw them, they were being tortured by Death Eaters.’ He pursed his lips after blurting that out, knowing he’d aimed below the belt.
Yet Harry’s mother loved James Potter. Eventually. She saw something in him, something good. Something worth loving.
Harry was trying on a pair of dark jeans and a jumper behind the curtain that turned a corner of the shop into a changing room when Pauline, a tall woman in a flowery dress with an impressive array of jingly bracelets, dropped in. She introduced herself, curtseyed at Malfoy (Harry snorted behind the curtain) and engaged him in a conversation about the Queen and her corgis. Harry hastened to leave the changing room. He doubted Malfoy knew anything about the Queen, let alone her dogs, and allowing him to run with his mouth could prove disastrous.
Draco had frozen at this display of intimacy. He turned to Pansy again. ‘Sweetie, humour me and tell me: am I friends with Granger?’
Harry cleared his throat. ‘I found this parka that might be a little too large for you. But it’ll be warm. And a bomber jacket.’
‘I am, yes. That thing you wrote, the comparison of Leos to Atlas, who held the world on his shoulders… that was… well, I liked it. A lot.’
Then touch: cool fingers gripping his own, and a brisk hand touching his forehead for vitals. Smells: jasmine perfume (his mother) and the slightly antiseptic smell of the infirmary. Finally, he opened his eyes.
‘Perhaps it was a trick of the light,’ Draco said, but Harry knew they both remembered how dark it’d been at the cliff. He didn’t know what to make of this, but shrugged. ‘Let’s go gather some wood from the unfriendly forest— ouch!’
His eyes are wide on his flushed face, vulnerable and unguarded and full of longing, their familiar grey colour now a midnight black. It’s a shock, but not an unpleasant one. Draco’s eyes are deep like the night sky, startlingly beautiful, unique like the man himself.
Potions Head Preston has informed me that I’ve been selected to attend a potions convention in Nice. Apparently my grasp of the language was the final tipping point, though they had seriously considered sending Vane until the boy was caught speaking in lewd, derogatory terms of Veela quite vocally a couple of months ago. Apparently, the department would prefer not to be represented by someone with controversial opinions, or at least not by someone who would air those opinions in public. For reasons unsaid, Preston elected not to discuss the convention with me until this evening, an hour before my shift ended, the same night I’m expected to portkey out.
