“Mm, and how do you like me?”

“—but I think this way will be easier on the both of us, the first time. At least until…” He had to clear his throat. “Well, until we’re sure we can control ourselves.”
For it was, indeed, Harry Potter standing there, leaned casually against the weathered stone arch marking the doorway to the Owlery. He’d doffed his robes for the evening, wearing only his favoured Muggle trappings (really, Draco ought to have slipped in an order to Madam Malkin’s for him by now; it was just

behind. It was almost too much to bear.
“You’re welcome to ogle all you like—after the banquet. Until then, keep your eyes to yourself, unless I say so.” And then he was gone, flouncing off to Regulus’s room, leaving Harry to gape in bemusement. It was exhausting sometimes, trying to keep up with Draco. Harry loved it, as much as he hated it.
“That’s nice, dear,” Mrs Weasley said, smiling as she wiped down a serving dish.

They made their way inside, Blaise leading them to a well-lit library warmed on one side by the wan sunlight streaming through the bay windows and on the other by a roaring fireplace. As they settled in for tea and sandwiches provided by a stream of house-elves, Draco couldn’t shake the odd feeling that…he wasn’t supposed to be doing this. Sitting around as a human, doing human things, with other humans. It was just so…
He’d let his guard down. He’d let himself get

to know if that were so? Or was his case being reevaluated? In the chaos of the post-war rebuilding efforts, it wouldn’t have surprised Draco to learn they’d forgotten to charge him with something and were going to discuss what new measures were needed to help him wipe his slate clean.
“The house-elves have proven themselves hopeless in bringing the gardens back to a seemly state after that nasty business last year. It’s clear I’ll have to take matters into my own wand if we’re to see colour on the grounds come spring.” She tilted her head at him, lifting a brow. “Now, to what do I owe the honour of you descending from your grand tower to grace me with your presence, Master Malfoy?”
“That would be a good start, yes.”
The only trouble was, he didn’t

about it—quite the contrary: he almost enjoyed it. He would find himself hunched over his desk in his room with the latest piece of parchment unfurled before him, mouthing the words to himself and hearing Potter’s voice in his head.
“So they’d ask questions. The only ones who might draw any connection would be Hermione and Ron—and Hermione’s out of the country, and Ron doesn’t care enough about my pets to delve too deeply into it, I’m sure.” He straightened up and pinned Draco with a narrowed gaze. “What do you care if it’s awkward for me to have to explain to everyone why my clingy owl suddenly disappeared?”
Realisation dawned then, and Draco straightened, swallowing thickly. “You’re…you’re the Weasley who was there when I…”
“Right, well, enjoy your treats. If you can manage some self-restraint on future encounters, there might be more where that came from.” He gave Draco a long, hard look—then shook his head, blinking at himself in bemusement. “…The hell am I talking to a bloody bird for? God, I really must miss Hedwig…”
“Part of the

, to take his mother and Apparate away, he was sitting here, alone in the Dungeon, holding a wand that wasn’t even loyal to him anymore and utterly bereft of prospects. With Harry-Fucking-Potter feeling sorry for him.
“All right. Well first: we’re studying in the Library from now on. I’m tired of going back to my room stinking of manure.”
“So? Isn’t that the idea?” Draco teased.

Apparently.” He slipped back around the couch, taking the long way out of the room to keep as much space between himself and his mother as possible. He paused, though, at the threshold, because it felt too much like fleeing. “We’ll discuss this more when I return.” Yes, that sounded better. Almost like something his father would have said, and though he in no way wanted to follow in Lucius Malfoy’s footsteps, the man had certainly known how to hold himself.
No, that the Malfoys continued to live a blessed life even after the fall of Voldemort was not so very surprising; what was truly astonishing was the fact that Lucius hadn’t been chucked back into Azkaban the moment Kingsley had been appointed temporary Minister for Magic. In retrospect, Harry supposed he should have seen it coming; had he not told Draco himself that his parents had a talent for managing to keep their heads above water when most anyone else would have sunk like a stone?
it was interacting with Potter when they both knew who and what the other was, was to simply avoid him altogether. This was a markedly easier task now they didn’t have any classes together, helped in spades by Draco being able to just turn into a bird and fly away whenever he wanted.

Draco gave a small grunt of acknowledgement, sinking low into his chair and trying to ignore the heavy gaze of a pair of twinkling blue eyes staring down at him from the portrait on McGonagall’s wall.
“Right…” He nodded, mostly to himself. “Then—let’s. Um. Let’s be fair about it.”
Potter blinked, as if ‘what’ should be obvious. “Well—are you gonna take it?”

“What’re you up to, then?” Harry asked, swooping in to save Ron from shoving his foot any further into his mouth than it already was.
Mr. Weasley nodded, smiling. “He’s a tough nut, but a good man, just what the Healer ordered at a time like this.” He cleared his throat softly. “So, er, when you have the time…you ought to think about bringing Draco by. To the Ministry, I mean.”

“…Well, yeah, they did actually, but Snape saw it got ‘lost’.”

. We’d better at least get a free lunch out of this.”
As the hall emptied, Harry felt his stomach finally unclench, the deed done and the weight off his shoulders. People were still swarming the table, but Harry let them come with a sort of lazy abandon; the sooner they copped their feel of him, the sooner they’d be on their way, and then Harry and his friends might have some peace. Speaking of his friends—where were they? He’d turned his back for two seconds to shake the trembling hand of some ancient, hunch-backed witch who looked like she’d been kicking around since the Iron Age, and Draco had disappeared, along with Ron and Hermione.

“Wait—wait, come on!” Potter lunged for him, and Draco lashed out with snapping beak and ripping claw—and that sent him reeling. “Right, right, sorry! You like your space, I know that. Sorry.” He waved the parchment weakly, pasting on an entreating expression that probably made Girl Weasley and her ilk go weak in the knees. “I swear, it’s

“I have.”
“Gamp’s from, what, the 13th century or so? And a pure-blood, probably?”
“Hah, maybe it’s Malfoy, come to spy on us!”
“Right, no, never mind—must’ve ticked the wrong box on the form. Hermione says I don’t read important documents carefully enough before signing them. Nearly gave away my entire house once just contracting a housekeeper to keep it tidy.” What the fuck? How on earth did one— “Anyway, thanks. For not just shredding the parchment and fucking off. I was panicking, and it was stupid, because of course I could’ve just borrowed one of the school brooms—but it’s just not the same, flying on any old broom.” Well, Draco could understand that. He certainly wouldn’t have thrown a fit, but there was something to be said about zooming about on a fine piece of equipment you’d bought with your (father’s) own hard-earned coin.
He pasted on a smile. “Nah, I just think someone might’ve spiked my Butterbeer. Can I lend you a hand?”
“All right, I think it’s pretty obvious I’m referring to the thing that has us freezing our bollocks off someplace that absolutely
, Harry thought, though he really should have said it; Draco needed to hear these things, needed to have them drilled into his head now and then too, as he could be just as stubborn as Harry when he put his mind to it. Instead, he opted to keep a cooler head, something he’d been getting a lot of practice with, spending so much time around Draco. “I can’t live your life for you, no. I can’t even really give you any good directions.” He rubbed a thumb over Draco’s knuckles, no longer holding him in place, just

stupid, and get back to studying?”
Harry shrugged. “Like I said, it’s only part of the gift. Hermione took care of the rest of it.”
Draco did not stick around to hear the scandalised screeches and appalled gasps that rippled down the Gryffindor tables, instead winging back out the way he entered. Still, he knew that once Potter managed to dispose of Draco’s lovely gift and unfurl the parchment, he would be met with just two lines:
“Wh—what?” Harry mumbled, thoughts addled by Draco’s insistent little thrusts solely intended to drive him out of his gourd with want. “What?”
“Oh, wow, thanks! Thanks a bunch! You’re a lifesaver, honestly! I take back everything I said about barbecuing you! Watch out for helicopters on the way, yeah?”
“I don’t know what I want to do with my life. I was lucky enough to scrape by with a second chance, a final year here, and I’ve squandered half of it wallowing in self-pity. I no longer care much for what my father might think of me, but I know well enough he’d be disgusted with what I’ve let myself become…and I share the sentiment. All I’m asking…is for the chance to set myself arights. I won’t ask for any tutoring or extra time to prepare or anything of the sort—I just…” He tried biting back the words, but they came anyway. “…There are people I don’t want to disappoint. People who still think I’m worth something. So with your permission, ma’am.”
bargain, and with little else to do to occupy his own evenings, Draco found himself reluctantly agreeing to be the Chosen One’s taskmaster. Only until Draco got bored of it, mind you; he was committing to nothing, save a few nights a week with a front-row seat watching Potter demonstrate in living colour that he’d bested the Dark Lord by sheer luck only and certainly not by a superior grasp of magic. It was the sort of affirmation that made Draco feel a tiny bit better about himself.

“He’s our friend, crazy as it seems—”
“Fine,
he might do in this state, but when Potter took two testing steps forward, close enough to gently poke at Draco’s wing to see if it was sound, he endured it with a grudging reluctance. Evidently emboldened by Draco’s indulgence, more poking ensued, until Potter had satisfied himself his hastily cast spell hadn’t ruined Draco. A good thing for the both of them, really, as Draco would not have wanted to limp his way to the Hospital Wing to explain to Pomfrey why he needed a few broken bones discreetly mended.

Preposterous; Draco had a name, and a very fine one that spoke highly of his pedigree. Perhaps it wasn’t going to open

—it had just been shitty luck, that was all.
Draco pursed his lips, like he was trying to keep from smiling, and his eyes fluttered open. They’d gone a dark, steel grey, and they bore into Harry with insistence. “You’re plenty for me… But for the dragon, maybe not so much. Don’t take it too personally.”
“…Why?” he asked, very small and a little bit petulant too, unable to keep the whine from seeping into his words. “Why won’t you leave this be? Why insist so? You’ll have your gang of Gryffindors traipsing about after you every step of the way, right through earning those horrid scarlet robes—they’ll look terrible on you, just so you know. Even without your Weasley by your side, you’ll have friends and compatriots aplenty, all just as eager as you to throw themselves in front of a panoply of curses and hexes and jinxes for glory. Even
And when he wasn’t napping away lecture hours or trying to get through meals as quickly and quietly as possible, he liked to come here, to the Owlery, where he could sit in calm, comfortable silence and have all the privacy he might like. The owls generally kept to themselves, only occasionally hissing or snapping at each other if one encroached on another’s roosting space, and given his sense of smell as an owl was virtually non-existent, the stench of droppings and old, mouldy feathers littering the floor didn’t bother him at all.

Patting himself down to check for injury, he collapsed down onto what turned out to be a burlap sack of something soft. Dirt, hopefully; fertiliser, probably.

“Can’t we?”

Potter slipped a hand into his pocket, withdrawing a rather unremarkable pouch the size of his fist, and placed it atop the knot. “And, as promised, because I’m a man of my word…” He then unlaced the mouth of the pouch, leaving it open, before quickly backing away.
Potter pulled his wand from his pocket, readying it for casting. “Right, right, er, let’s see…” He bit his lip. “Um,
Potter cupped his hands around his mouth and huffed into them. “Maybe another tower, one that’s not open to the elements? I know Astronomy classes are focusing on book learning until a new professor can be hired to replace Sinistra since she retired after last year, so the Astronomy Tower might be free.”
But disappointingly, Potter wasn’t disgusted by these thankless gifts at all—quite the contrary, he actually
She nodded congenially. “No need to give your response now—I only ask that you think it over. You’re not obligated to return, being of-age as you all are now. And should any of you wish to merely sit your N.E.W.T.s and engage in self-study instead, I’m sure we can work something out. I hope to hear from you by early August, though, so we can start sorting out housing arrangements for the overflow students.”
“Not quite lunches with your folks, is it?” They made their way through the little kitchen garden towards the distant sound of laughing voices. “So how much do you think you can eat before you’re too pudgy to make it off the ground?”
The floorboards had been stripped and refinished, removing any nasty stains—blood or otherwise—and the furniture had been reupholstered to similar ends. The walls shone with fresh coats of paint, and even the neglected greenhouses in the garden had been reseeded. It had to have cost a mint, making any restoration an ostensibly difficult task, given how heavily the Malfoy fortunes had been garnished by the Ministry for post-war reparations. Draco had nothing to say when pressed about the cost of the repairs—up to and including the busted lock to the pantry in the kitchens—so Harry assumed the source of the funds was not up for discussion. Lucius Malfoy was a Slytherin, after all—always prepared. He probably had caches of treasure hidden all around the globe, untraceable and unmarked.

And though Draco knew Potter was saying these things to be contrary, his way of acting out…he didn’t entirely hate the suggestion. Draco didn’t have anyone like that, was all. Someone who just tolerated him, who might wonder where he’d gone if he disappeared but probably wouldn’t miss him. Someone he could be a terror to who’d blithely come back the next day as if nothing had happened, because he didn’t care enough about Draco these days to hold a long grudge.

protests, and he quickly found himself set gently down onto the window sill, with Potter prodding him to move from the makeshift falconer’s glove to the cold stone bricks.
The Christmas holidays were upon them sooner than Draco had expected, which was surprising, seeing as the halls had been well and thoroughly decked with the absolute tackiest decorations Galleons could buy since December 1st.

They couldn’t have dinner parties every night, though, and within only a few short days, Draco’s edginess had built once more, making him even more snappish and peevish than usual. Convinced that one or both of them was going to blow a fuse if they didn’t find a suitable outlet for Draco’s pent-up energy beyond the bedroom, Harry stuck his head through the Floo while Draco was in the shower.

Draco’s lip curled at the suggestion. “No. If you hadn’t noticed, I’ve learned a few new tricks for getting about undetected. It’s a dodgy business, flying through the halls, but I’m not likely to get caught, at least. Mrs Norris wouldn’t dare tackle something my size.” Though he wished she might try; he could do with letting off a bit of steam. He jerked his chin in Potter’s direction. “You? Or does McGonagall just give you the run of the castle these days?”
He thought Draco might say
“I assure you, Mr. Malfoy, there’s nothing untoward about these evaluations. We ask all Animagi to complete them, and once you’ve demonstrated satisfactory marks, everything will be settled and you may go on about your day. And Mr. Potter is, of course, welcome to join us—in fact, I must insist.”
Harry smiled at the gesture; no, not so different at all. “Scared, Malfoy?”
, vowing swift and unflinching retribution on whoever the culprit might be. His spoons had behaved ever since.
“He wasn’t my friend,” Draco said, as much to remind Potter as himself. “You saw as such.”
“What—for you?” Draco nodded, and Thomassen shrugged. “Told you, it came from high up. I just did as the Head Auror asked. None of my business. If you’re so curious, Auror Robards should be back from his lunch break around 1. You’re welcome to take it up with him.”
“Mm, I think not. The sun’s been peeking in and out; I expect the afternoon to be quite pleasant.” She shooed him away. “Off with you. Let me get back to my reading. I mean to have roses again come spring, if those damned peacocks haven’t dug up the beds.”

Draco shrugged. “Barring any unfortunate incidents of vigilante justice perpetrated upon my household over the holidays, I expect so, yes.”
whispering into the Minister’s ear and mucking up entirely the smooth trajectory of Draco’s post-academic career. He pushed himself to his feet, stalking around the coffee table to confront her. He couldn’t shit on her, no—she’d do unspeakable things to him. But he could certainly give her a piece of his mind. “You couldn’t let me handle my own business, just
His mother gave a weak, uncertain nod of acknowledgement, and Draco wished, with all his heart, to melt right through the floor and perhaps reform in the dank cellars below where he could be alone with his thoughts. As that wasn’t liable to happen, though, he instead sank to his knees before the fireplace and placed one hand on Potter’s head (“Hey, what the f—”), giving a great shove. “Get—back—

“For this.”
Draco looked to be thinking along the same lines, for he took the watch with a trembling hand, head ducked so that none but Harry could see how his eyes were shining. Lucius, too, seemed troubled by the unusually emotional exchange, quickly shooing Draco back to his mother, who was delighted to bestow upon him a new broom—a Nimbus 2020.

Shortly, one figure loomed larger than the others as it approached the glass. With the click of the latch being drawn, the window was eased open, and Potter’s stupid head poked its way out. He glanced to and fro in frowning confusion, and Draco had to release a rasping squawk before he was finally noticed, doing his level best to hover just above the window and feeling the strain of the effort quite keenly.
“Nonsense! It was
“More research?” Harry groaned—not unpleasurably, as Draco kneaded the meat of his arse, likely leaving marks. “Please tell me Hermione didn’t help out this time…”
It spoke to how genuinely unsettled Draco was by the prospect of willingly returning to the Ministry that he didn’t snarl back something along the lines of
“I…yes, sir. A life sentence.”
“He can barely hold his head up on his own; you think he’s listening to a word I say?” He made a funny face at Tedward. “Can you say, ‘My father will hear about this’? Come on, give it a go.”

Potter then began worming his way through the crowd to each display around the shop, quietly explaining what the different products did—though there were the occasional few items he wasn’t familiar with. “So, you know. Buyer beware and all that. Might make your chest hair turn purple. Might make your bits fall off.”

it now, anyway? The sun suggested it was still mid-afternoon, so they couldn’t have been flying for more than an hour, or two at most—did Weasley live very close to Wiltshire? Or was there magic afoot? Seeing as he was going to be spending a fair bit of time as an owl going forward, it might behove him to do a bit of research into the ins and outs of owls, magical and otherwise. That would be his personal winter break project, he decided, and then once he returned to Hogwarts, he could—

“Well, you’re free to sign on to take them, even without having completed the coursework. You’ll only be expected to have done a bit of self-study if you hope to pass, that’s all.” He closed the folio, leaning across his desk to fix Draco with an expression bordering discomfitingly on pity. “Have you given any thought as to what you’d like to do once you’ve graduated and your probation’s up? You’ll be free to travel as you please, of course—but there’s plenty of work to be had or higher education to pursue here in Britain.”

No sooner had his talons closed around the feverishly vibrating Snitch than he was off again, wings flapping furiously, not for height now but for sheer break-neck speed, because from the sound of it, Potter had seen the stunt and was in hot pursuit.
“I Floo-called McGonagall, asked if we could pop in,” Harry explained, suddenly a bit embarrassed by his presumption. “…It’s only, out here you can transform whenever you like. I know you’ve been missing it—
Which made him wonder why he was dragging his feet. It was one thing to want to keep his private life private and out of the public eye—but it was another thing entirely to want to keep such an important part of himself secret from the closest thing he had to family these days. He was a fairly private person, he thought, but he’d never imagined himself the type to keep something so…so fucking
. He shuffled down along the lowest of the roosting branches, one leg bared to accept a letter, and Draco set to work affixing the parchment.
“The gesture is appreciated but wholly unnecessary.” Draco nibbled at his lip. “Just fuck me good and proper, and we’ll call it even.”
“Er, hullo, is any—oh! Draco! Draco, check it out!” A disembodied hand pushed its way through alongside his head, and clutched in its grasp was a piece of parchment, the contents of which Draco could unfortunately guess. “Finally got my letter from the DMLE! About bloody time, I say. You didn’t happen to get—” His gaze quite easily found Draco’s mother, who still had the damn scroll in her clutches. “Fantastic! You got yours too!” He looked half-ready to propel the rest of his body through the connection—but then seemed to realise just whose company he’d barged in on. “…Oh. Er, hullo…Mrs Malfoy…”
There were greetings all around, and Draco gamely shook every hand extended his way. Even Bill offered him a terse apology for knocking him out. “Thanks for pulling Fred’s bacon out of the fire. We’ve got a backup—” He jerked a thumb at George, who showed him a couple of fingers of his own. “But we like his model better.”

“You’re right; they wouldn’t have,” Draco said, and raised his glass. “Here’s to doing whatever it takes to keep our parents safe.”
“Oh piss off; we needed N.E.W.T.s, and last year was hardly conducive to studying properly.” He squinted at Draco in the low lamplight, like he was trying to figure him out. “…How’d you know I would come? That wasn’t a very pleasant invitation.”
Draco thrust his chin out, defiant. “Romantic closed up shop months ago; not even Hufflepuffs put it off this long.”

And now there was evident commotion at the Gryffindor tables as Potter scrambled to his feet, shoving his way through the tightly packed students and waving his hands hissing
“Hm. Point…” He sighed, as if this were a great effort he was being asked, and caressed the shaft fondly, nuzzling it with a soft, breathy inhalation. “Just for a bit, then.”
While Draco had objected to his parents throwing any sort of affair for him at the Manor, he had been only too happy for Harry to organise something far more laid back at Grimmauld Place—which meant louder music, questionable drinks, and more games of Strip Exploding Snap. Pansy, Theo, Greg, and Millie showed up unfashionably early, which Harry suspected they had done on purpose, and dragged Draco off into the sitting room to shower him with gifts, with Harry, Hermione, and Ron pointedly not invited.

Draco tried to show him two fingers, but it didn’t really work when feathers entered the picture. Damn, he was useless indoors—there were no roosts to perch upon and glower down imperiously at Potter from. In fact, there wasn’t much in here at all, aside from the—he counted—five beds, all empty at the moment.
Potter’s lips thinned into a tight line, and Draco thought he could see a little vein popping out at his temple. “Then I’ll not only not try to befriend you, I’ll continue being a right wanker. I won’t coddle you or take pity on you or comfort you or anything a friend might do. I’ll be absolutely straight with you, because I don’t give enough of a shit about you to lie.”
Someone knocked softly on his door, and he muttered a gruff, “Come in, if you must…” He could count on one hand the number of people who’d dare disturb him when his door was shut, and they were all relatively tolerable presences. He supposed he could stand being seen moping by any one of them.
“Which do you think?”
Draco didn’t look like he was enjoying himself all that much, though. “…Does it hurt?”
“I might just,” Draco said, turning Potter’s childish threat around on him. “I hear it’s nice this time of year.”

Potter’s nose wrinkled in disgust. “…Thanks, but I’ll pass.” Draco raised his mug in a
Draco began to preen, and Potter sighed, defeated.
Draco tried to discern if Potter was fishing for sympathy or had genuinely suffered a less-than-wholesome upbringing. Sure, there were the dead parents, but it wasn’t as if Potter
“Good to see you again, Draco,” Wentsworth said after his secretary had ushered Draco into his office, and he waved his wand, encouraging a chair that had been sitting in the corner to gallop over and scoop up Draco, depositing him in front of Wentsworth’s desk, which was presently drowning in paperwork. Catching Draco taking in the state of his desk, Wentsworth gave a wry chuckle. “Well, it’s a busy time of year, you can understand. Parole hearings, petitions for family leave, and enough visitation requests to choke on.”
Potter was speaking in riddles, so Draco latched on to the bit that made the most sense right now. “Don’t be so sure. I haven’t yet begun to try.”

“Generally?”
Draco didn’t flinch. “…Because it’s so much easier for

Not to do everything it took to survive. And if it only counted when you were fighting for love, well hadn’t he fought for love? For his family? And still Potter managed to make him feel like shit for doing so.

Potter stared up at him, and Draco appreciated those precious few inches of difference in their heights; it wasn’t much, but it helped. “That’s what happens when you don’t pick a side at all. You’re left with nothing to hope for. Nothing to work for. I thought you Slytherins were supposed to be cunning or something. You ought to know by now that if you want your side to win, you’ve got to commit to it. You can’t do things like lie to your loony aunt’s face when I’m sitting in your parlour, or hold your goons back from finishing what Voldemort started. You can’t do the bare minimum and just hope for the best.”
. He drew the cloak out of Draco’s reach, draping it over his shoulders—then seemed to consider something. “…Want to come under?”
“Forget it,” he said into his teacup, short and sharp. “It was a silly question.” Blaise looked like he very much wanted to protest, so Draco smoothly shifted the conversation to topics of Christmas and parties and lavish banquets for the sole purpose of pretending everything was as it had always been. Was there to be a New Year’s to-do? Well of course there was, they weren’t
He did; that was the trouble. He felt his face heat and struggled to keep his voice even. That he was getting so emotional was humiliating enough; he certainly didn’t need Potter realising the effect he still had on Draco after all this time. The idea Potter could do anything but bring out the very worst side of Draco was laughable. ‘Saviour’ his great white feathered arse. He took a measured breath, biting out in his most vicious whisper, “I’ll handle
“Microwave?” Hermione supplied.
Potter sighed, running his eyes over his parchment with a pinched frown, nose wrinkling. “…I feel like I should’ve chosen a different topic for my essay. Do you think Flitwick would let me have an extension if I sent a Patronus to ask him? Might impress him, at least.” Draco gave a rasping, derisive hiss—of course the knob was looking for special treatment. “…Yeah, suppose you’re right. This is only meant to be a rough draft, anyway.” He tapped his chin with his quill, then pressed the nib back to the parchment, scribbling. “‘In conclusion…nonverbal spells…are actually more useful…than wandless ones—’” Draco nipped his hand, and Potter hissed in pain, jolting. “Wh—what was that for?” Draco gave him a

“…Merlin you’re such a soft touch,” Draco mumbled, though his voice was thick with emotion. He shook his head, leaning forward and sliding his hands up over Harry’s chest, curling at his neck. “Of course,” he whispered, close enough to kiss. “Fuck, of course—I’m sorry, I was only—”
But that was a lie. He couldn’t have had this, because that just wasn’t how things had gone.

Another traitor. “Been doing okay, otherwise?”

Draco frowned. “You can’t wrap your head around the

“Easy, easy, geez…” His eyes lit up, an idea striking him, and he stuffed a hand into the pocket of his robes—coming out after much rummaging with a handful of what looked like multicoloured kibble. “Er, I haven’t got any owl treats on me, but I do have some…Bertie Bott’s? I reckon this one’s coconut—” He held up a white bean. “And this one…maybe cherry? Or chili pepper…” Gingerly, he took a step closer, his offering cupped in his palm. “It’s a little bit of a trek—southern England, if you can manage it. But I can have some proper treats for you when you get back? Only it looks like the other school owls are in use and—” He made a quick scan of Draco. “Doesn’t seem like you belong to anyone else? So? What do you say?”
“Should we try some out? It’s a bit of a pain, not knowing what to call you, honestly.” Well that was hardly Draco’s problem, and Potter calling him
“…I’m not taking any N.E.W.T. classes, so no, I expect not.”
“I haven’t changed.”
Potter would invariably spot him watching on such occasions (a big white Barn Owl was difficult to miss, admittedly), but instead of ignoring Draco and focusing on the game—rather, on the Snitch he was meant to be catching—he would hover there, a hundred feet up, waving stupidly at Draco as if they were best mates. The others on the pitch probably thought he was going mad, acting so chummy with a bird; Draco didn’t disagree with them. Potter was
Ron ducked his head, full-on grinning now, and waved Harry off. “Enjoy your lizard boyfriend, if you must. Just don’t say we didn’t warn you.”
Walking tours of the castle had been instated, with a fat folder of pamphlets describing the repairs made waiting on a desk at the base of the staircase well. Harry noted, as they progressed through the castle, that here and there were little plaques embedded in the stonework, memorialising the fallen. He found Tonks’s plaque at the base of the Astronomy Tower, with Remus’s right beside it. Draco found Blaise’s in the stairwell leading down to the Slytherin dormitories.

Harry Potter surrounded himself with
Despite the stress of it all, though, Draco found himself strangely wistful. These last few months had not been quite as insufferable as Draco had imagined they would be when he’d first been handed his probationary terms, and now he was standing here in Greenhouse A, loafers caked in Mooncalf shite, about to bid goodnight to Potter for the last time before they broke for the holidays.
It had only ever been a fantasy, though. He wouldn’t have been able to leave his mother there to fend for herself, defenceless and alone, without even Lucius to stand between her and the Dark Lord’s vengeful fury at Potter once more slipping his grasp.
“Hey now, don’t be like that—all the other school owls are off on post runs, and I need a letter delivered.”
and more
“I don’t think I am. It’s just an Undetectable Extension Charm—with a few personal touches.”
Harry wilted. “That bad, huh?” He’d known Draco would be a tough sell, but his critique coupled with the incessant clapping only made matters worse.
, but I want them now. Not rumours, not gossip—I want it to be clear as day, no room for doubt.” He slipped a hand under the hem of Draco’s briefs, sliding over the globe of his arse and squeezing tight, until he knew there would be marks left in the morning. “I never got to tell my story, never got to shape how people saw me—but I’m going to now.” He pressed a fierce, hot kiss to Draco’s lips, trying to draw him in, make him as much a part of Harry as it felt he already was. “And you’re going to be part of it.”
“You sound like Mother,” Draco snorted, blowing over the lip of his bottle so it sang.
She was angling most unsubtly for his decision on whether or not to return for the Eighth-year curriculum, and he gave a dismissive nod. “You’ll be hearing from me soon on that matter, I expect.”
“So what is it, then?” Hermione prodded, curious.
He shot back out around the eastern side of the castle, dipping under another set of struts to enter the quad, where gaggles of students pointed at him—and Potter—in scandalised voices. He flared his wings to keep from slamming into the tall windows flanking the Hospital Wing, shooting up and over and relishing Potter’s loudly spat oaths as he narrowly avoided a quick trip to see Pomfrey himself.
Draco mulled this over. “…No.”
“You do that,” Mr. Weasley said, shooing him off. “And don’t be a stranger!”
Thomassen nodded to the seat in front of his desk, and after shutting the door—and finally blocking out all the curious glances thrown his way—Draco shuffled his way over and gingerly settled in. He prayed he wouldn’t be asked too many questions, because his stomach was still feeling out of sorts, and he didn’t want to ruin what looked like important case-related paperwork covering Thomassen’s desk.

Harry felt the blood leave his face, and Mrs. Weasley’s sumptuous stew began to bubble nauseatingly in his stomach. “What? Why? He hasn’t done anything wrong!”
“Poor thing won’t get to take her N.E.W.T.s,” Ron snickered fondly, and Hermione frowned at him, affronted.
. And no one needs to send me threats; they’re unspoken—that’s the point.” He made a shooing gesture. “I’ve a nasty habit of slipping through unscathed when my life’s on the line.”

Potter rolled his eyes, accepting the empty plate when Draco shoved it into his midsection. “I’ll see if I can’t make up an excuse for you to hang around with me while I’m out. I figure that ought to at least be more entertaining than sitting in here.”
. Too aggressive.
“Taking ‘no’ for an answer’s always an option.”
It was another five minutes before McGonagall managed to get the crowd settled, and then several other speakers followed in Harry’s steps, offering similarly stirring speeches—Kingsley’s call for a new order, for benevolence and forgiveness and compassion, was particularly well-received, and Harry clapped loudest of everyone for him—with McGonagall herself rounding out the evening.
Draco was watching him, slumped against the table with his head supported in one hand, and he snickered softly, an amused smile curving his lips. “

ever reemerge without creating an entirely new scandal. He needed to suffer their probing gazes and hushed whispers until they found someone new to gossip about. He hadn’t done anything wrong (barring Potter’s testimony), and the sorts who were liable to take out their anger and frustration on him physically were going to find a way to do so whether he made himself available to them or not.
“You need any help?”
Charlie nodded, smiling. “Yeah, that was me.”
“Wh—what is it…?” she asked, voice fraught.
about the need to…well, to see that you didn’t hurt anyone else—and that you weren’t a danger to yourself, either?” He drew a half-empty package of biscuits from a drawer, placing several on a small tray—when his bushy brows beetled in thought. “…That does remind me, though: who was it, exactly, who authorised your release? I don’t recall the paperwork coming across my desk, but it was a…tricky time…”

bit bored, all right, but certainly not enough he needed Draco in his hair, bird’s nest though it was. Potter had friends by the bucket-load, and Draco was the one who’d pushed everyone away.

Harry’s heart clenched. He didn’t know if he’d survive Draco not being afraid of him anymore, if this was what he might expect.
When he asked Draco why they had to attend so regularly, if he didn’t even
Draco squinted at Potter, who drew his hand back, miming putting it away so as not to bother Draco anymore. “You’re awfully jumpy. Most owls I’ve known have been pretty laid-back. Well, barring Pig. But he’s just excitable by nature. You act like everyone’s out to get you.” Potter gestured around the room. “There aren’t many safer places than inside these walls, you know. Even the Owlery’s protected by the castle’s charms. You don’t have to be so uptight.”
“What about that Charms classroom where you took a sucker punch at me?”
Draco waved him off with a derisive

Harry smiled, drawing Draco’s arms around him, resting his hands at Harry’s hips and tracing the gentle curve of his arms, up to his elbows. The dress robes were made of something not quite silk, not quite velvet but rabbit-soft and luxurious.
Oh, he’d been wanting to do this for a while now, and he was rapidly running out of opportunities with the shortening days and dipping temperatures making outdoor play less and less appealing, so it was now or never. As soon as he’d wolfed down his breakfast, he gave Pansy and Blaise smacking kisses on their cheeks, told them not to wait up for him, and rushed from the Hall in a flurry of robes, heading straight for the Owlery. If tradition held, Potter would still be stuffing his face for another ten minutes yet, at which point he’d saunter back to Gryffindor Tower, change into something suitably moth-eaten and stained, and make his way down to the Quidditch pitch, laughing and shoving and engaging in all manner of machismo-infused power play like the Golden Boy he was.

It looked like it was about to piss itself with glee, so Potter might have more to fear from the owl in the hand than the one in the bush, as it were.
. “These things have Tracking Charms on them too, did you know?”
Slowly, Potter brought his eyes up to meet Draco’s, and it was a hard stare, full of cold emotion and unpleasant recollection. “‘Either must die at the hand of the other, for neither can live while the other survives’,” he quoted, tone flat and dead. “It’s a tricky thing, killing a Dark Lord bent on immortality. You have to be prepared to sacrifice a whole fucking lot.” And then he looked away, like he couldn’t bear being that open and naked for so very long; Draco thought it impressive he’d managed it at all. Potter crossed his arms, shoulders hunched. “The point is, I’m making this decision with my eyes wide open, right? I’m not doing it out of any misplaced sense of obligation. I know better than
“Don’t choke,” Potter warned. “I don’t know how to perform the Heimlich on birds.” Draco hadn’t a clue what ‘the Heimlich’ was, nor did he care to have Potter attempt to perform

It was different, when it was just the two of them with nothing to hide behind, and they had made no further great confessions since their reunion, both perhaps feeling such phrases were wasted on the day-to-day, losing their lustre if not doled out sparingly. Their feelings remained unchanged, though, so Harry did not,

Harry accepted his attentions, humming his pleasure. “Should I return the favour?”
As soon as the words had left his tongue, Draco felt the urge to physically reach out and snatch them back. As it was, he buttoned up, jaw snapping shut, and a strangled little whine of mortification died in his throat as Potter stood there, just blinking, dumbfounded and—for once—blessedly bereft of words.
“Course I did. I wanted to…”

She reached out and rubbed his shoulder. “Who says you ought to be angry? You’ve been through a lot this past year—so has he. So have all of us.” Her eyes went to Ron, then back to Harry. “We just want you to be happy, Harry. That’s really all there is to it. We’ll put up with rather a lot from you, in case you haven’t figured it out over the years. Plus—” She bobbed her head. “Well, we kind of like Draco, too.”

They could do this pretty well, though. They could certainly communicate to each other every apology and every forgiveness and every longing thought they'd had since they'd broken up. He could show Draco every night he'd wished Draco would say exactly this, every time he'd thought that if Draco came back he'd never let him go again, because this losing loved ones routine was just not on any more, and every moment he'd thanked God that Draco had been there during the accident and afterwards...
"It's a Muggle thing," said Demelza, as George struggled with his almost chocolate-free son. "I think he's hoping it'll distract them from causing more mayhem."

The moment wouldn't stop replaying itself, over and over again, Harry thought wearily as he brushed Alec's fine ginger hair back from his forehead. He watched Alec's chest rise and fall as he slept peacefully in Harry's bed, and marveled at the miracle of it. And thought, for about the hundredth time, that he should really get some sleep himself.
“As you may have cause to remember, this was right when the Ministry announced that they were going to have the first annual Harry Potter Day, and the magical world lost their fucking minds.

I think at one point I was offered a two-for-one deal on toilet paper with your face on it.”
“I wanted a really unusual pattern, something that would stand out, and be quite unique, and perhaps become my signature, so I thought of my time in Minnesota, and how much I loved raccoons, and I set out to recreate their masks, because they are adorable and I thought it would be very daring and dashing, to be known for selling kittens that look like Zorro.”
“There, there, kitten, it will be alright. We’re going to find out where you- ow! Bloody fucking hell!”
Reaching for his wand, Harry prepared to blast the intruder out of his home, and was trying to decide how much trouble he’d be in with the aurors if he used one of the spells specifically for apprehending criminals, when he saw what it was that he had touched, and stopped. His mouth fell open, and his eyes grew huge as he stared.
“Well, Potter? Do you admit it? Have you come to kidnap my prize kneazle and leave me destitute? What about our previous interaction made you think that you were welcome to drop in again?” Draco’s voice was sharp and clipped, his accent unbearably posh.
“I know where the floo is, I’ll just see myself out, and, uh, thanks for the invite! See you tomorrow, must run!” Harry ran from the room back to the foyer, where he threw in a fistful of floo powder, and called out “The Roost!”
Harry paused for a moment, briefly considered getting another cup to replace the one he’d spilled everywhere, and then decided against it. Best to get it over with all at once- like ripping off a bandaid.
“Er, Malfoy, how do you know who Zorro is?” asked Harry, perplexed.
“Er, ok, sure,” said Harry.
Harry snorted. So Pansy Parkinson was somehow involved- he couldn’t bring himself to be surprised. After the dust had settled from the war, she’d owled him wanting to meet, he’d gone out of morbid curiosity, and while she’d clearly intended to make a show of apologizing to him in a public location, she ended up bursting into tears midway through, dragging him into a broom cupboard at the Leaky Cauldron, and weeping onto his shoulder for a while, before making a more private, but much more sincere apology, and then threatening to hex him if he ever revealed her indiscretion, as she called it. Now they meet up for drinks in muggle London every few weeks and bitch about whatever is going on in their lives, but Malfoy clearly isn’t aware of this. Although, she’s never said anything about Malfoy to Harry either, so she’s obviously been keeping things from him as well.
“Potter!” barked Robards. “Good! Just the man I wanted to see. We’ve got another inspection coming up, and I’m putting you on it. Have it completed by the end of my day, and for the love of Merlin, please make sure you ACTUALLY file the report on time. For once. Am I understood?”
Harry groaned. He was so not ready for this, but his Gryffindor bravery did not fail him, and he stepped fully into the room, and prepared to have a conversation with Ron about his feelings. Uggh.
Without even bothering to take off his boots, Harry collapsed onto the old, worn couch in the sitting room at Grimmauld. He was looking forward to an evening of lying still, doing nothing, and then eventually collapsing into bed, perhaps after having eaten some of Kreacher’s soup. His plans took an abrupt turn as he lay on the couch, stretched his hands above his head and felt- skin.
“Yeah, that sounds good. Listen, Malfoy, uh, something’s come up, and I think I’ll need to finish this inspection later. I’ll see you, uh, tomorrow, I guess?” Harry said. He was already standing up, and picked up a sleeping Chrysanthemum out of his lap and into the chair, careful to avoid waking her.
“Yes, sure,” said Harry, somewhat desperate, and still unnerved by the tiny hairless creature in his home, “But that also means you’ve had 13 years of kneazle experience. Maybe you could at least help me out with er, how it got here?” Harry said, his voice raising hopefully.
He was jerked from his surprise by Raz’s booming voice once more.
Known for Power, Quality, and Aspect
“Look, ok, I still don’t really know anything about kneazles, but I know somewhere that does! Why don’t you go to Magical Menagerie and ask the man who works there? He must get his kneazles from somewhere, I’m sure he’d know at least who you can talk to. Also, kneazle breeding is a licensed profession, so you could probably look it up at the Ministry, which I know you know, because you were just complaining about writing a citation to an unregistered puffskein breeder last week, so you KNOW that magical creature breeders are registered! Anyway, I really must run, but again, I have complete confidence in you.”
The kitten had decided that she was tired of being held, and had bitten Harry sharply on the hand, causing him to let go. When he let go, she promptly scaled his arm, digging what felt like hundreds of sharp, tiny needles through his robes and into his flesh. She managed to get all the way to his shoulder, where she seemed to be content to perch and nuzzled the side of Harry’s face, just a little bit. Then, ignoring Harry’s continued cursing, she curled up into a small ball, and went to sleep.
“I suppose you have questions. Well, let’s do this properly. I’ll get us a cup of tea, and you can ask all the questions on your form, and I will tell you about the, er, Potteazles.” He turned away, snapping his fingers, causing a tea tray and various tea making supplies to fly out of a cupboard and towards a pair of overstuffed armchairs in front of a large fireplace that was nestled into a nook in thecorner.
The gray kneazle let out a wail, which was matched by a squeaky meow from the kitten in his hand. After a moment more of squiggling, somehow Harry ended up with his arms full of large gray kneazle, who was frantically grooming the small kitten perched atop of it, purring loudly, and stopping only to growl occasionally at Harry whenever he shifted his arms.
The kneazle kitten was grooming him, sharp little tongue dipping in and out of her mouth as she rasped her tongue over the side of his face. Satisfied that his sideburn was clean, she clambered around onto the front of his robes, clinging to his chest and head butting his chin, before beginning an enthusiastic cleaning of his adam’s apple.
Harry nodded.
“It was after the toilet paper thing that I realized I was sitting on something that people might actually WANT. I sent out a few inquiries to Magical Menagerie, because I know she finds good homes for kneazles, and she said she would absolutely take some Harry Potter themed kittens. Well, they sold immediately, even with the screening that I required before my kittens go to a home, and people were clamoring for more. As I’m sure you know, kneazles cannot be bred too quickly, so I was prepared to let this opportunity pass me by, when I received a call from the original witch who’d gotten me into breeding in the first place. She was looking to retire, and wanted to rehome her breeding pairs, and she had a pair of pregnant kneazles who were ready for their Aesthetic Charms, and I figured- what the hell. Here was my chance to make a mark on kneazle breeding- I’d be a fool not to take it.
Malfoy sighed, and ran a hand through his hair, pushing it off his face.
“A likely story, Potter. Chrysanthemum is only 9 weeks old- too young to even leave her mother. You’re telling me she just, what, apparated into your home? Kittens at this age are only capable of apparating around their residences, not into strangers’ homes!” As soon as he finished his sentence, a look of comprehension dawned on Malfoy’s face.
“Since I’d already figured out the round glasses, and since eye color charms are a snap, I only needed to configure the charms for the scar, which turned out to be a moment’s work. Since I had two mothers to work with, I decided to get a little wild- I tried some charms on one batch to get them to have little maroon and gold striped tie marking on their chests, and on the other I wanted a golden snitch to flutter on the belly. That charm used to be quite popular, but it had fallen out of favor, so I was quite sure at least one of the litters would be successful.
The door to Magical Menagerie opened with a creak, and Harry was hit with the sounds and scents of a multitude of animals. Everyone seemed to be talking or hooting or wheezing at once, and Harry felt briefly overwhelmed, the way he did when he stepped into his office in the mornings and work. He almost turned around and left, but then the tiny warm body on his shoulder stretched and squeaked, and he realized he would be stuck at home with the kneazle, and no closer to finding a solution if he turned back now.
One of the kneazles must have felt Harry’s approach, because it yawned and stretched, revealing a delicate pink tongue and tiny, gleaming, pointed white teeth. It then blinked sleepily, and turned to look at Harry.
Harry laughed.
“Oh, good grief- Chrysanthemum, claws in,” said Malfoy in a firm tone. At his command, the kitten stopped resisting, and Harry was able to lift her off his shoulder and set her on the floor next to Malfoy.
Draco nodded, and sighed.
Huge, live trees grew from the carpet, arching up to meet the ceiling. Where the branches touched the ceiling, they fused with the plaster to form intricate pathways upon which cats could run, with occasional cat beds sticking out for a nice spot for a nap, or dangly toys where a cat could bat at something shiny. Giant, rope covered towers soared into the air, with dangly bridges and clever wicker cubbies interspersed. Soft, plush looking beds and blankets lay draped about on every surface, and Harry could see on many of them the same self-heating charms that he’d glimpsed in the Magical Menagerie. A glittering pond full of magical koi gleamed in the center of the room, and hundreds of colorful, squeaking toys jittered underfoot. Enchanted butterflies flitted about, dancing and dangling just out of reach.
“I’m not mad,” said Harry, and he was shocked to find that it was true. He wasn’t mad. The Potteazles (uggh) were honestly kind of cute, and Draco was right, they were a lot better than any of the other merchandise with his face on it. He hadn’t known about the toilet paper before today. Or the popcorn. “I’m a little disappointed though. I wish people would ask before putting my face on things, kneazles included.” Hermione had a lot to say about copyright and the magical world- Harry was sure that in a few years, she’d have the laws needed passed, and that his face would no longer be fair game to anyone looking to make a quick galleon. Causes were absolutely Hermione’s love language.
“Oh,thank Merlin,” he said, once he managed to close his gaping mouth. “Oh, Rowena, I know , sweetheart, I was worried too. Chrysanthemum is a naughty girl, isn’t she? Running away and scaring us like that!” Draco’s voice was warm, soft, and openly relieved. It took Harry a moment to realize that he was talking to the two kneazles currently in residence in his arms.
“And what, your first litter just happened to look like me? Malfoy, please, can you just get to the-”
Every single tapestry in the entry way was of cats. They were not the sweet, saccharine cats that he remembered from Umbridge’s office, or even from Ms Figgs’ house, but they were still undeniably cats. Giant leopards lounging in trees, lions stalking the plains, tigers swimming in pools of water, and of course, kneazles. Kneazle borders around abstract tapestries, kneazle kittens hiding in gardens, kneazles fighting with giant harpies in another. Everything moved with slow, elegant grace, and Harry lost himself in watching the ripple of threads form pictures.
“Er, not really a task, Kreacher, and thank you for soup, I’ll be sure to eat some, it really does smell good. I just thought maybe you had something you wanted to say to me? About, er, this? I mean, it’s fine if you have, uhm, relations, who want to stay, it’s just, I’ve never really interacted with a baby house elf before, and I don’t quite know what they need. Am I supposed to babysit? Should you really leave it alone while you’re in the kitchen?” Harry said, pointing at the small being still perched on the arm of his couch.
Stunned, Harry looked up, trying to make sense of it all, only to remember that he was at Malfoy Manor, and that Draco Malfoy was right in front of him, so looking up meant eye contact with Malfoy.
Kreacher looked at Harry, and shrugged again.
Chapter 4
“It’s good to be seen, mate. Nothing wrong with wanting that,” said Ron. He squeezed Harry’s shoulder once more, and then took his hand away, but put his arm around the back of the couch so he was still near Harry. Harry liked that. He didn’t know if he could handle all the emotions and physical contact, but it was nice to know that Ron cared enough to be near. He looked up from his hands, and found Ron was smiling at him, his eyes crinkling at the corners. He was still wearing his boxers.
Harry poked at the toast and eggs that Kreacher had laid out on the dining room table. Kreacher was bustling about in the kitchen, doing something, but every so often he would poke his head into the dining room, and to forestall his dark mutterings and warnings about masters who did not eat and would surely starve and waste away, he tried to make sure he was in the process of eating something whenever Kreacher appeared. This was not as successful as he had hoped it would be, because by the time he was shrugging on his outer robes and ready to floo to work, a quick peek into the kitchen saw Kreacher perched on a tall stool with an enormous peacock quill in hand, scribbling away at a letter. Harry groaned. It was definitely a letter to Molly Weasley- he’d be lucky if he escaped from this with just some enforced dinner invitations- she’d been hinting with an increasing lack of subtlety that she’d like to come stay for a few days, just to help him out a bit.
Malfoy frowned, but accepted this. With another enviable swirl of robes that had Harry wondering if dungeon living somehow taught Slytherins things about robe twirling, he stalked off towards one of the shiny wooden doors, and strode through purposefully. Harry, kitten still on his shoulder and purring madly, followed him.
That thought struck him as so pathetic that he looked down at the parchment in his hand just for a distraction. He winced. It had not escaped the sloshing tea either, and a very visible brown stain covered the bottom left corner.
The warmth was gone from his voice as he looked up and met Harry’s gaze.
“Yes?” said Harry, feeling rather confused about the whole thing.
Hey, just a general disclaimer for the fic and for me as an author, I absolutely do not stand with Rowling's views on trans people. If you do, I'd honestly rather you went and read something else. Thanks!
More Draco and his cats (I mean kneazles). And yes, my chapters are DEFINITELY getting longer.
Harry looked around, not wanting to just start opening random doors, and found his attention drawn to the nearest tapestry. He looked at it, not really taking it in, until he realized what it was he was looking at, gave a snort of laughter, and looked around the room. All of a sudden, it was obvious.
“Well it’s obvious how she got here, Harry. She’s a kneazle- they have very strong but limited magical abilities. Most kneazles are capable of limited apparition, and highly trained kneazles can be taught to set wards. This is basic magical creature knowledge, Harry. You should know this by now,” she said in a stern voice.
“Yeah, that’s fine, I’m ready to take the responsibility for that. Hey, want to grab lunch before you go?”
Eventually, Malfoy got tired of delaying with the tea things, or perhaps just ran out of possible tasks, and sat back into the cushy armchair, still nervous. His expression became more anxious as one of the two black cats with unusual markings (Harry’s brain rebelled at the idea of using the word “Potteazle,” even in the confines of his own head) had followed them over, and jumped into Malfoy’s lap, butting up at his hands with its uniquely marked face.
“Honestly Harry,” she said, sitting on Harry’s couch and stroking the kitten, which had curled up next to Hermione and appeared to have fallen asleep, “I’m not sure why you would think I know anything about what to do with a surprise kitten. I’ve had Crookshanks for, goodness, almost 13 years, and you were there when I bought him. You know I just grabbed him out of Magical Menagerie, and he was already an adult. I honestly have no idea.”
Harry let out a short bark of laughter. The cat was, well, him. What had looked like an all black cat from a distance actually had several distinct markings. A pair of round spectacles were formed by white fur around the kneazle’s bright green eyes, and another patch of white fur formed a lightning bolt that looked identical to Harry’s own. He reached up and touched his own scar self consciously- it was was thing to see his scar in the mirror every morning, and quite another to see it recreated on a kneazle’s face. The weird Harry-kneazle opened it mouth and let out a rusty meow, which startled its companion, causing it to lift up its head and also blink at Harry. It had the same exact markings in white on its face- these cats were clearly identical twins.
The cat tapestries in the other room had not prepared him for what he saw as he stepped through the door. It was, to put it simply, a cat’s paradise.
Purveyor of Fine Exotic Kneazles
“Yes, Master Harry? Does he be having a task for poor Kreacher? Master Harry is looking far too thin, oh yes, so Kreacher is working most diligently on soup, of course, of course. But perhaps Master Harry knows better than Kreacher, and thinks something is more important than his well being and nutrition?”
“Potter!” Malfoy barked. “Come away from there, and stop harassing my kneazles at once!” He sounded nervous. Harry became a little concerned. Was there something he didn’t want Harry to see? The cats looked well cared for, but maybe he was hiding something? Maybe it was all an elaborate glamor that would fall apart under scrutiny.
Malfoy glowered.
Kreacher considered this, and appeared to accept it. He seemed to shrug, and then Harry felt the crackle in the air again that always heralded house elf apparition.
When he flipped the card over again, a floo address appeared where before there had only been a blank space. Harry stared harder, certain that he must be mistaken. There was no way that he was standing in a shop holding the floo address to Malfoy Manor.
“Kreacher, I promise you, if I was going to get a kitten, I would let you know. But it’s not mine. I didn’t know it was here. I didn’t even know it was a kitten, remember? I thought it might have been, er. You know,” said Harry, cheeks heating as he remembered his earlier mistake.
At his words, she let out a plaintive cry, which he did his best to ignore as he stepped into the floo, calling out for Grimmauld Place. It was for the best, he told himself. He didn’t have time for a pet. His long hours at work kept him much too busy for anything of the sort.
“Kreacher!” he called out. “Kreacher, can we talk for a second?”
A new update for spring! Have some more ridiculous Harry and Draco and also at least one kneazle.
Harry had assumed that there would be as many kneazles as there were pictures of cats in the foyer, but as he scanned the room, he was surprised to see that there were only about half a dozen cats, not including Chrysanthemum. He recognized the fat gray kneazle from yesterday sleeping in a basket with a velvet pillow, and then there was the pink spotted one (hard to miss) stalking some butterflies, the iridescent one sharpening its claws on a rope tower shaped like a mushroom, a long haired calico that seemed to shift the location of her orange, black, and white portions of fur, and then two identical looking black cats that were closely curled together, sleeping, in an orb of wool that was hanging from nothing in the middle of the floor.
Malfoy seemed to mistake Harry’s moment of embarrassed contemplation about the sweetness of Malfoy as a sign of anger, because he started babbling.
“So,” said Ron, who had listened with great patience as Harry had struggled to explain what he’d just experienced, “Malfoy spilled his guts to you, apologized, and then invited you to a fancy kneazle party. You said yes, and then panicked, and flooed straight here. That sound about right?”
He was cut off by a frantic wailing and squirming from the cat in his arms, who at this point had gotten a good look at Harry and the kitten. The gray cat launched herself out of Malfoy’s arm directly at Harry’s face.
“Oi, why are you in your pants? It’s nearly noon!” asked Harry.
Harry’s alarm went off, as it always did, at six thirty am, before the sun was even thinking of peeking over the horizon. As he always did, he shut his eyes tight, and gave himself 2 more minutes of ignoring the harsh, beeping sound of his alarm. After the two minutes were up, his alarm clock began to emit a high pitched screaming noise, as it always did, and he had no choice but to get up and turn it off.
As he came out of the break room, steaming cup in hand, he almost ran into his boss, Head Auror Robards. It took all his elite auror training to keep his tea in his mug while not running headlong into his boss.
"Whaat?"
"Right. I'll be up later."
Draco was in the living room as well, staring out the window pensively, and Harry came up behind him and put an arm around his waist, leaning against him. Draco shrugged slightly and Harry let him go.
"What about men?"
, by Ralph McTell
"I'd say 'talk about your parents' is pretty much out," Malfoy said grimly, and touched his wand to the paper. A line appeared across the words.
"Yeah. You too."
This recording is actually my choir in performance. We sang this at a Remembrance Day performance, the same day that I had my mother's ashes transferred to the cemetery. I invited the family and friends who were at the inurnment to that night's concert, and when my choir sang this song, I sang it for her.
And then a burst of flame. Flame from the mark that had sat like a curse-mine on his chest ever since his father had put it there.
Draco put down the plate he was drying. "Are you serious?"
But leave there they will in the hours before dawn,
"What the devil--" Draco broke off and Harry could almost see the light bulb go off in his head. "You think - you think I'm talking about leaving you? Again?" Draco said, incredulous.
"How could you forget those?" Charlie asked, irritated.
hjpotter@gringotts.wzr
"Oh look, here it is," said Demelza, brandishing an old newspaper. "
"Would've been." Harry kissed him. "I'm proud of them both." They reached the gate and slipped through it, then he climbed onto his broomstick. "Come on," he said. "Let's stop at the next town and call Kara to let her know about the Sorting."
The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.
And I'll be looking for someone,
Somehow sometime in the last few weeks he's lost all interest in cleavage. Now he's got an obsession with Malfoy's lips, his hair, the way he moves, all grace and strength, and fantasizing about what Hannah Abbott's small breasts feel like has ended, and he kind of misses it. It's been replaced by wondering what it would feel like to pull Malfoy close in passion, not just the innocent embrace they regularly fall asleep to. Really feel him against his body, all heat and hard angles, and he can't hold back a moan, this is way too fast but he's so close, Malfoy's arms are pulling him closer, and he's whispering in Harry's ear, things Harry can't really make out because the heat from Malfoy's body - and his own - is kind of overwhelming, what the hell is he DOING, they've become used to touching each other all the time but this is different. He's pushing against Malfoy, rubbing against him and Malfoy's either going to kill him or burn him up. Malfoy's grinding against him too, gasping, hard as a rock, then his hand is - oh god - and what little Harry can hear has something to do with Not even a Death Eater, I wasn't going to, I love you, and besides, the war's over, and Harry draws back, dizzy, and frowns at Malfoy.
And now Draco was looking cornered and Harry figured he probably looked exactly the same, and they all desperately needed to backpedal.
One day while she had nothing to do,
9: Herbology (Gryffindor/Hufflepuff)
"Well, Granger said she would offer to clear out of our place for the night, but pointed out that we'd run into her and ourselves if we went back there tonight. Don't forget, right now you're going to bed alone and I'm staying up with my Pepper-Up potion. Or maybe I'm already talking to Granger."
Draco taunted Potter, but his anger was somehow channelled away from violence for its own sake and into something... different
There had to be some way through this. Some way to balance the needs of his marriage with the need to not push Alec and Harry away, while still protecting Alec from Malfoy...
English bribes were a' in vain
nice. "Should I go on?"
"Our what?"
"Howler?" Ben blinked at her. "His parents would send him a Howler for getting into Ravenclaw? Why would they get angry at that?"
We're not like the Muggle world, Malfoy sneers. And then comes closer to catch Harry's mouth in a kiss, and Harry's surprised but leans into it, since Malfoy's not going to turn into Cho or cry at him. It's ridiculous, being a little husband, having people think you're
"I take it she didn't do this for your real first anniversary," Hermione said.
Its own appointed limits keep:
"Probably," Malfoy said dryly.
"Why?"
Walk upon England's mountain green?
Ron shakes his head to dispel the discomfort. "Harry, are you still sure you don't want-" he begins, and Harry cuts him off.
, to go after Malfoy again, she wasn't going to let it happen without a fight.
"Try again. You're exhausted."
He nodded. "Have to leave early, too; it's a three-Floo trip out there."
Malfoy was looking at him expressionlessly.
"It would make more sense from a security perspective," said Bill. "And Alec, I think this was supposed to be something that the grown-ups were going to decide in a bit. It's a big thing, moving in with somebody."
"You can do other things, though. You're really powerful. Why can't you make it stop?"
Kara shook her head. "This is wrong, Draco. I may not understand everything you explained to me, but I understand enough to know ye're nae doing the right thing. For any of ye."
Oh God, the bloody Weasleys. Harry would no doubt be around them more than he had been in the last few months. He'd hear what they thought about the situation, hear what they thought of Draco, and all without Draco there to remind Harry of why they were together.
The Healer pursed her lips. "Very well."
End of the day in their quarters.
We've been rambling all the night
When all the shades are gone
Malfoy glanced around the room nervously, but he didn't draw back, didn't pull away.
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
"You don't have much control now-"
Wait, stop, Draco wanted to ask. Am I going back to Azkaban? For how long? Can I contact my son? What's happened to him? Can I speak to a lawyer? Where's my wand? Did you snap it like you snapped my first wand? Can I contact Harry?
"Oh." Harry blinked. "I didn't realize that."
Harry stared at her.
"What I'm trying to say is... they're both important to us." He looked away. "And some of us haven't done so well letting go and seeing when we're trying to protect them but we're actually hurting them. And when I say we I mostly mean me." He paused, meeting Malfoy's eyes again. "I'm trying to say I'm sorry, Malfoy."
Carry me on...
Harry was suddenly inexplicably reminded of Ginny speculating as to whether or not Snape said to himself "I shall now execute my Billowing Exit" whenever he left a room in that particular fashion. Sternly squashed down completely inappropriate laughter at the memory.
Also: tomorrow is Beltane :)
Ben gulped and forced himself to move to the stool, swallowing hard as the old Hat settled onto his head.
"Why not? You know I chose to be with you."
Harry blinked. "What... why's it yesterday?"
He'd expected pride. He'd expected satisfaction, at having successfully brought a Malfoy heir into the world. He hadn't expected the rush of love and devotion he felt towards this ridiculously small creature, who had done nothing to earn either feeling. It had felt uncomfortable then, and it felt uncomfortable now, but he supposed it would do for the purposes of this spell.
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.
"Harry, dear." Hermione looked up to see Molly hurrying towards Harry. Behind her, Arthur, Kara, and Malfoy were entering the waiting room, Kara looking too frightened to be properly aware of the strangeness of the place. Molly hugged Harry, hard, then drew back and looked at him worriedly. "Any news?"
"Well, I can't help you on the breasts part of it, and romance between two men isn't the same," Draco admitted. "But it does exist."
"Whatever you say," Parkinson says, reaching the Astronomy classroom and grasping the door handle. Seamus pulls on her sleeve and she turns around, her eyebrows raised.
"What?" Fred said.
Pale faces around the table, a buzz going around the Great Hall and teachers getting up, so much like that day so long ago when they both collapsed, except this time Snape and McGonagall were rushing to the same table and neither boy was unconscious, and Snape looked half-livid and half-nauseated, unconsciously rubbing his forearm, and none of them could touch either boy, what with the bond having just been renewed. Harry murmuring quickly to Malfoy. Malfoy's breathing laboured, his body rigid, his forehead against Harry's and his eyes clenched tight.
Draco laughed, shaking his head. "You're..."
"Teresa?" Draco said snidely. "And how long is that going to last? A week?"
Harry blew out his breath, looking rather uncomfortable now. "Erm, yeah, but... not after Alec's Mum died." He glanced towards the living room, seeming highly relieved that it looked like Draco was saying goodbye.
Harry smiled. "Come on, you knew they wouldn't have been singing for you much for the next few years anyway, once their voices broke. Besides, don't tell me you're not excited to be conducting that new string orchestra." He grinned at Draco. "'London's newest rising star in orchestral directing', they called you, right?"
"That wasn't Tonk's fault, you know that. The spell usually only lasts one month. She'd done it before to other people being hidden by the Order."
he'd ever done wrong. Not just his failure to protect Alec, but his long hours at the shop, his overwhelming, loud, self-righteous family, his refusal to take on defence magic contracts that would make more money for the shop, insisting instead on concentrating mainly on the joke stuff he and George loved, and while she was at it she took a few swipes at his constantly putting his twin ahead of his wife--
"You're sure?" Harry asked, feeling the knot in his stomach loosen slightly. He glanced back as the boys burst into yet another argument over Lego pieces, turning back to Bill as Kara moved back to adjudicate.
"That's all right, then. I dunno when I fell in love with you. I was so pissed at you, and the fucking bond. That's why I got angry that time, when we were suspended."
Fucking Malfoys, he thought bitterly. Hurting Fred's family, business as usual. It wasn't enough that Lucius Fucking Malfoy had almost killed Ginny as a kid and almost destroyed George. It wasn't enough that the junior version had wrecked Bill's face, now he had to come in and hurt not just Harry's kid, but Fred's kids as well. Azkaban was too good for him, he thought grimly as he followed George into the kitchen.
"I know, I know. I just..."
Harry's eyes were doubtful, hesitant. "Erm... I don't know if I..."
"He doesn't sound anything like me. And I can't sound like him."
"He lived with Potter how many months? And how long did he spend in your dorm?"
"Oh Merlin."
"Erm... me too, Draco."
Harry blinked, and Draco drew back, taking the other chair next to Alec's bed and clearing his throat. "Thought there were supposed to be people here with you? Your e-mail said Demelza'd be here."
Actually, he's not. He's too relaxed, too self-assured, doesn't look like Neville at all. For one thing, Neville had no idea his own face could ever look at anybody with as much disdain as he sees there now, as he tries to imitate Malfoy's body language and Malfoy rolls his eyes in impatience at his feeble efforts, just like Grandmother often does.
Good thing the stage lights were fairly low-key, because his cheeks felt like they were burning and his stomach felt oddly light. He determinedly kept his eyes on the director and not Harry.
"I suppose so, yes," Draco said absently, then looked up from his list. "Why are you asking this?"
This part of an interrogation was always so bloody embarrassing. He'd trained himself to feel comfortable around Muggles, and honestly wasn't a danger to any of them, but he would probably never be able to trust them as much as he trusted wizards and there wasn't much he could do about it. With his upbringing, he reminded himself, just being able consider them human had been a major accomplishment. And there was nothing for it but to just ride out the questions, try not to react to the inevitable glee of Aurors who thought they'd be able to embarrass him with his own involuntary prejudices, and hope it ended soon.
"I have to."
"Oh of course not," Parkinson says dryly.
"You don't mind that it's a Muggle place?"
Now you must raise our child in dignity."
Draco took a deep breath. "You asked me, in December, to give you more time. At the time, I thought... but now..."
Shout Hallelujah! Praise his holy name
"What?" For a moment the juxtaposition of Charms class and McKay and Cornfoot's statement made so little sense that Draco literally couldn't understand him.
There was a slight rustle among the five Aurors sitting across the table from Draco, and Draco felt a small spark of unexpected relief. It was unnerving sometimes, the things that emerged under Veritaserum; things you hadn't even realized were true before they came tumbling out. But sometimes you could be pleasantly surprised. And he had to admit that, much like the Aurors across the table from him, he'd suspected his own motivations for Obliviating the couple at Brigid's Cross a few hours ago had been centered more on concern for himself than for Ben.
"All right." He closed and leaned back against their door, letting Harry run soft lips down his neck. He reached back and untied Harry's hair, enjoying the silky feel of it running through his fingers, black and silver strands tumbling in a wave down Harry's back. He drew in his breath as Harry knelt down, undoing Draco's Muggle trousers, pulling aside the black shirt he'd worn for the concert. There was something incredibly sensual about a lover's hands undressing you. Especially when they were so slow and gentle, so familiar. He groaned as Harry took him into his mouth.
"You're getting hurt right now," Malfoy pointed out. "I almost hexed you into next year a few hours ago. We weren't going to do anything like a Giggle Spell or turn each other green; we were both going to do serious damage. You're miserable, and so am I. How could having sex be worse than all of this?"
"'Sokay. I don't mind. Hey, don't look like that. Think I could go flying?"
Draco shook his head helplessly.
had some of the drunker patrons singing along and calling out responses, and it really was rather remarkable that, for a country so famous for poetry and music, what Ireland seemed to churn out most prodigiously were simplistic, forgettable drinking songs. And Harry and his family were singing along with the chorus. Draco suppressed an eye-roll. Not that it didn't have its own charm, but it was so typical that the Weasleys would latch onto it with gusto. The finer things in life were wasted on them.
Draco Malfoy's eyesight is not quite as keen as his own, Ron realizes immediately. He can't see the details of the medicine cabinet across the hospital.
decided-"
belong, though," it prompted Ben.
Harry's eyebrows had come down and his eyes were slightly narrowed.
This was ridiculous. Draco might not even have had time to check his e-mail yet. And Harry's own e-mail to him had been rather... bugger, it sounded so needy.
It just took time. We just needed to get to know each other as people. The four days helped a lot. And we both really wanted it to work. We'd put each other through a lot, so we knew we had to really work to make things better.
Harry hesitated. "Did you... hear an answer? When you prayed?"
No clue, doesn't matter. She's likely to be throwing pots at whoever it is by the end of the night anyway.
"This... the expensive dinner, the Time Turner - I'm really, erm, touched that you did this, but I wasn't - that wasn't what I meant yesterday when I asked - I mean, I don't need-"

"Tomorrow it's Fred's shift!" Percy said, coming to the door again.
"Ah hould your gob," says Maggie McGee
"Alec?" the mediwitch said, waving her wand over Alec and gently bringing him back to consciousness. "Dearie, let's get you sitting up and let's take our potion now, shall we?" Harry moved back onto the bed and pulled Alec onto his lap, cradling him and turning him towards the mediwitch.
Cornfoot took a deep breath, clearly summoning patience. "Because there's roughly eighty students above the age of consent in the school, and only forty are male, only six of those are gay or bi, and frankly most of those are just not to be countenanced as sexual partners." He paused. "Also, I'm gay," he said clearly, just in case Draco had missed that one.
"Let's go, then," Flint said to Ellis, nodding at him to precede Flint and Draco through the door. Not bothering to speak to or look at Draco.
"But the schedule--"
"You'd give me some money to start with, wouldn't you? Even if I cheated on you, lied to you, and vowed to never call Granger anything but the M-word for the rest of my life?"
Malfoy's mouth dropped open. They stared at each other, and Harry made himself maintain eye contact despite the crawling sensation of having extended his trust to someone so untrustworthy, even on something as relatively small as admitting one of his fears.
scrtkpr, you're a totally awesome beta :)

It's only for three hours, Dean tells himself as they walk out of the hospital wing. He can do this. He may be wearing a Slytherin's face and body, but right now what he really needs is some solid Gryffindor courage.
They cut off our hands and put nails in our eyes.
Oh god. God and hell and shit and Merlin and Mordred and there weren't swear words enough for how mortified he felt. If Malfoy had picked up any of what he was dreaming...
" he said shortly. "I'll think about it."
It was best to be numb, Draco reminded himself. Don't feel sorrow over what had just happened, don't feel anger or resentment at the way you're being treated.
"I was trying to figure out how to tell him."
And Azkaban kept crowding into his head between questions. Azkaban, with its greyness, its cold and hunger and boredom. Too many chances to regret everything he had ever done wrong in his life, burn over every unfairness he'd endured, too many chances to become the person he'd been when he'd finally left it - angry, cynical, bitter.
They could talk this out, decide what to do, how to make sure the adults didn't push them into doing anything they didn't want to do. Maybe give them more time to work together, give them another chance - or rather, give

to sleep with her and not worry about possible ramifications. He no longer had a superabundance of allies or friends in Slytherin; he couldn't really afford to jeopardize one of the only steady sources of support he had.
"Yeah. And doing, you know, erm, romantic things. I didn't - I don't really know how."
"No! No, I mean all right, I understand-"
"What's this?" asked Anne, taking the paper. Her eyebrows shot up. "Good Lord. That's Harry," she said, looking closer. "Bloody hell. When did this come out?"
"I'm scared," Harry blurted, wincing but forcing himself to not withdraw. Better to talk about this with Malfoy than with his father.
"Draco? When do we go on?" asked Alec, and Draco suppressed the urge to snap at him. It was only the fifth time he'd asked.
"He could have died," she said, her voice icy.
"Permanently."
When the stars call, then I trust my Saviour
"Kneazles don't change their spots," Flint gave Ellis a smirk. "Still feeling sorry for him, Ellis?" Ellis looked away. "See, Ellis here is a Muggle-born. One step up from pond scum according to your lot."
Our children are leaving and we have no heads.
"All right..."
"How about bondage? Blindfolds?"
"Where are you..."
Well, we knew that, but it was really not easy to be together all the time. So we tried to - we went to sit at our separate tables. Don't know how long it took, just a few minutes, then we both passed out. Felt horrible afterwards, too.
"You don't mind?" she asked.

Bugger. Now that he had the chance to lie, he really couldn't take it. He felt an almost overwhelming urge tell Flint nothing but rubbish, and then somehow have it come back and bite him in the arse, wanted to see Flint's face when he realized Draco had been lying, but he couldn't. He couldn't afford to. He couldn't make any enemies. What if some day all that stood between Draco and freedom, Draco and being able to return to Ben, was what they asked the Aurors who had been present today, and they talked to Flint?

It had been the right thing to do, he told himself, though the image didn't provide him with any insight into why Draco had been hiding from him. Whatever had happened that day, it had been the right thing to do, because Draco had needed to learn discipline and strength. It had hurt Draco, and it hurt Lucius to see it, but pain was sometimes necessary and could be a powerful tool for greater good. He did Draco no favours if he didn't have the strength to hurt him when Draco needed instruction or correction. Suffering built character.
I heard a young man calling:

"Well then maybe this'll finally convince you to move to London, as I've been trying to get you to do ever since-"
"Bloody hell, I dinna believe this-"
Bill's eyes widened and for a moment his resemblance to Arthur was quite pronounced. "Really? With electricity and everything? What for?"
The larger political ramifications of this liaison are difficult to predict. In recent weeks, as news of Death Eater activity has risen, many have speculated that Lucius Malfoy has returned to his previous position alongside You-Know-Who. If true, his son's relationship with the Boy Who Lived will no doubt put that position in doubt. What consequences this will have for the Malfoy family, for Harry Potter, and for us all, are too numerous to contemplate.
"And keepin' yer secrets from him was worth risking going to jail again?" asked Auror One.
"We never even got that close. Best we got was one date at the Three Broomsticks on Valentine's Day. And a kiss at Christmas."
"So, is the schedule working well?"
"I'm being too subtle for you, aren't I?" Cornfoot said, and Draco found himself blushing. Apparently he'd turned into Harry when he wasn't looking.
He cleared his throat. "The only thing we could do for her was take care of Alec and Harry for her. We've done our best; we don't understand Alec, but there's not one of us that wouldn't give anything for him. He sort of belongs to all of us. And so does Harry."
"Maybe." Draco shrugged carelessly. "Not my problem. There's more to life than upholding House honour."
Come suppertime she'll walk the beach
I did.
The rest of them try to stifle themselves and Harry gives Malfoy a slightly worried look. Neville's stomach drops as he realizes something. The only way Malfoy can stay with Harry is if it looks like he's not here. For that to work, Neville must go out there and pretend to be Malfoy. If he can't, and if anybody gets wind of the fact that Draco's near Harry...
"What about me, you stupid tosser?" Malfoy asks impatiently, so close to Seamus' own accent that Seamus blinks, startled. Harry, Hermione and Parkinson start laughing.
"Everything ready for tomorrow?"
"But why?"

6: Arithmancy (mixed)
God, yes, Merlin, he was losing the ability to breathe and Harry was going to kill him, but what a way to go. He arched his back, grabbing onto the headboard to avoid grabbing Harry's hair, amazed at the feverish pitch of his arousal, vaguely aware that he was moaning continuously and unable to decide whether he needed Harry to continue for the next fifteen years, or bring him off
"We're neither of us girls, so no," said Draco, pouring Alec a glass of milk.
Harry cleared his throat, and there was a low chuckle from somebody near Harry.
Malfoy bit his lip and Harry was suddenly unsure whether pushing him more would only serve to antagonize him, or whether backing off would only give him time to retreat and refuse to talk. He tried to reach out through the bond, trying to figure out what Malfoy was feeling. Quickly gave up, as there were too many conflicting emotions to make sense of them.
Finally the sparks were under control, the dishes returned to their places, Michelle's mooing toned down to a bearable volume, and the family returned to their pre-bombshell conversations, a little more loudly than before.

Narcissa stood by the window, her face betraying no emotion for the turmoil raging through Lucius.
"Yes, Harry?"
"Come on, Draco," she pleaded. "I have to do this. And do you no want to be near Harry as well? Or is it not working, with him?"

Yes, he'd listened to Hermione's reasoning before they got back together, and after they did he was able to rationalize Harry's actions to himself by reminding himself of everything Hermione said. And he'd worked out, all by himself, that Malfoy must not be the complete git Ron had always thought he was when he saw that Malfoy was worried about Harry's health, and when he figured out what was wrong with Harry, and when he showed he was willing to risk being disowned again to help Harry.

No, no, nothing like that.
"No, of course not," Harry said, and signed his report.
"Don't go girl on me now," Harry said quietly after a pause.

Hufflepuff 160/Gryffindor 60
Malfoy looked sheepish. "Er... no."
And he shall reign forever and ever
The last thing Harry remembers is that he'd been laughing at something Seamus had said at dinner. They were at the Gryffindor table, for the third meal since they'd been bonded again, and Harry had stopped worrying what Draco was going to do with no friends or house around him because there was no point thinking about it. He'd cast his lot in with Harry and his friends, and there was no point trying to pretend anything different. He wasn't being terribly friendly to any of the Gryffindors, but that was all right; they still hadn't heard from his father, were waiting for the axe to fall in the form of yet another Prophet headline, and it was understandable that Draco wouldn't want to talk very much right now.
"When you weren't racing off to the loo whenever Draco and Potter got within arms' reach of each other."
"If you can figure out a way to not make it sound quite as self-serving, maybe," Harry laughed. He looked back at the castle. "It's a bad sign that I've already counted the days to the Christmas hols, isn't it?"
"He figured it out."
"I'll... we'll work it out. And I'll take the boys to the game," Harry said. "Ben's been looking forward to it forever. We don't have to - you can just drop him off at my place. We don't have to see each other."
I didn't put a link to the Navy Hymn, mentioned by Alec and Draco, because it was mentioned in the last chapter as being part of the "sea-songs" concert. Here it's part of a general-sacred-music concert. My choir reuses songs whenever possible; I figured Draco's choir would too :)
And the whisky scattered over Tim.
"We've got plenty of time before they get here."
"Muggles do love focussing on what's important, don't they. Like the colour of a person's skin, or the sex of the person they sleep with. Who cares about what they're like as a person, or how strong their magical ability is." She shook her head contemptuously. "And you wonder why we don't want your kind around."
He closed his eyes and lowered his head, tears spilling down his face, lips pressed together tightly, and frantically willed himself to keep control. The silence in the room broken only by his harsh breathing.
Ron sat down at the foot of the bed, smiling as Alec rolled over in his sleep. "Good. Getting ready to go back to work."
7. Free
The future was going to be dicey, but he forced the image of the Dark Lord aside and focused his mind on whatever happened to filter through from the three near-Seers. Indistinct laughter, a shadowy hallway, a teasing look met by - Lucius swallowed as he recognized Draco's smile, so seldom seen.
I've no memory of any of it. Neither one of us does.
Robbie's giggling died down fairly quickly. He was evidently still worn out from crying over the prank Michelle had played on him, and it was far past his naptime. Fred smiled down at him as he fell asleep in Fred's arms.
Sounds disturbingly organized. And a little bit wrong.

Everybody loved the healing circle. People said they would love to know how it was from somebody else's point of view. A few suggestions: Snape; Narcissa; Esposito or Lucius. (I vote for Lucius!! *fangirl moment*)
Harry nodded. He'd had a pretty good idea of what he was going to do with his future around Alec's age too. Being destined for a life of music seemed a far better fate than being destined to kill or be killed by a powerful madman.
"I don't know if I'm doing right either. I do know that I've felt guilty the whole time I've been with Harry."
"Harry," Malfoy said gently. Harry didn't acknowledge him. Malfoy crouched down before Harry, looking up at him and touching his knee. "He'll be all right. You heard the Healers when they first came to talk to that woman. They didn't have much hope for her husband. With Alec, they do." Harry kept looking at the floor, face utterly blank, and Malfoy sighed and started to get up. Harry suddenly covered Malfoy's hand with his, holding him in place.
"It's really, really disgusting, Pansy," Harry says sympathetically. "They can't help it."
"What?"
"Didn't break anything this time," said Fred tightly, struggling to clear the anger coursing through him.
Harry chuckled. "Go to sleep," he said, and climbed back to the top of the bed, taking Draco into his arms.
Beside him. Inexplicably, the fury and wild hatred towards Malfoy that he'd felt mere moments ago was completely gone, replaced by a bewildering urge to stay as close to him as possible. Because, he realized, they were in this together, both in the deepest of shit, following Dumbledore and McGonagall and Snape to god only knew what punishment. And all the other students, even his closest friends, were back in the Great Hall, and only Malfoy could possibly have any idea of what Harry was going through right now, or any chance of giving him any comfort whatsoever.

Two hours later, the door opened, and a weary-looking elderly Healer came through, followed by a reedy younger man wearing a Trainee Healer badge. They scanned over the people in the waiting room. "Mr. Malfoy? Ms Greely?"
He wanted it, more than he'd thought possible. It hadn't occurred to him much, before, but now that it had, he wanted it with all his heart. Draco and Ben, living with him and Alec, the four of them forming a real family together. A home for all of them. And not just for the purpose of helping to keep Draco and Ben safe, but to give himself and Alec what he had wanted for Alec when he and Ginny were expecting him. What both Alec and Ben deserved.
"Come on, Alec, no sense crying over spilled pumpkin juice," Draco said.
"Read 'em. Clipped 'em." Kara smiled, rinsing a plate and handing it to Draco to dry. "And actually, me manager and I have been talking about next steps."
He bit back a bitter laugh. What control. He had no control whatsoever. Never mind not being able to attend the meeting going on right now, never mind having to submit to whatever the adults decided at that meeting. Since that miserable day in September he'd lost practically all control over everything in his life: who he spent his time with, where he lived, what he felt...

other than allow his fate and the fate of his family to be aligned with either of them.
"I don't particularly care who your father is, Malfoy," Cornfoot said. "It's not him I'm hoping to bed, after all."
We had dreams and songs to sing
"He's good at imitations, Finnigan," says Parkinson, pushing Seamus out the door after making sure that the corridor is empty. "Does McGonagall so well you can almost see her glasses quivering on him."

, that felt good - he made a sound in his throat, kissing Malfoy with a bit more confidence, pulling him closer, more determined, wanting so much more...
Concentrate, he told himself, and conjured the image of his father. Cold, stern, and strong; a worthy role model for anybody. And Narcissa, the epitome of all that was feminine grace and refinement.
Potter angrily grabbed Draco and pushed him up against a tree
"Maybe this is something you two need to discuss on your own," said Bill neutrally.
(October). The first song, Labour of Love, is linked to in Chapter 3.
He braced himself for no message, or for a message telling Harry to back off and give Draco more time. Or one turning him down.
I heard.
"Simple, mate. We've been concentrating on dangerous or painful. Howlers are neither, except to your ears."
"What?" Harry asked, a bit defensive.
Collapse in Great Hall.
This can't go on much longer. He can't keep doing this. Every time Harry's asleep, Draco gets tired of the whole thing, tired of seeing nothing but the hospital wing, tired of the taste of Polyjuice, tired of spending time with only Harry and occasionally Granger or Pansy. Every time, he tells himself he's being an idiot and determines that the next time Harry awakens he's going to regretfully tell him he has to leave.

"Not exactly the romance fairy tales are made of, then? Why's that?"
Draco fiddled with his watch. "Kara... Kara said there's a possible position at the Royal College opening soon."
Draco narrowed his eyes, stung.
"Ah Biddy," says she, "you're wrong, I'm sure"
It felt right. It felt like home, like healing, and it didn't matter what had happened before now, or why Draco had left. He caressed Draco's cheek, noting the roughness of stubble there, holding him close. And it was heaven, feeling Draco breathing against him, drowning in his scent and his warmth, the low hum of his magic caressing Harry's senses.
"Fall in love with me."

"Sit down, Draco," Snape snapped at him, in the angriest voice Harry had ever heard him use on Malfoy. "This is not a simple schoolboy fight. This is far too serious not to call your parents." He turned on his heel and stalked out of the hospital wing, his robes billowing behind him.
"I... I went back for Alec, but the part of the wall he was under hadn't collapsed yet. It didn't fall at all."
"What House is he in?" the Hat asked.

"Ah. Yeah, there is that."
Talk to Lupin, thinking about bond.
Flint squinted at him suspiciously. "What's your mother's maiden name?"
He winced in distaste as his son and Potter hesitantly touched their lips together for the first time in Dumbledore's outer sitting room. It had been bad enough, that day, to witness that event secondhand. Seeing the amusement on the faces of the Healer and Dumbledore - and even Severus - as they detected activity from the boys' bond spell, then informed the rest of them what was going on in the small sitting room. This was nothing he wanted to witness firsthand, even as a memory.
And above all, don't feel fear.
"You all right?" he asked, laughing.
Narcissa was out, and he couldn't meet her eyes. She would never forgive him. Oh, she would say she did - she was as well-versed as he in diplomacy, manners, and surface niceties. But down in the heart of their bond, where it mattered, she would never forget and she would never forgive.
We need a ship sailing where
He resumed his path down Harry's stomach, down to his groin and stopped, abruptly a little nervous. Right. Somehow he'd momentarily forgotten exactly what oral sex entailed. This was... he braced himself and made himself ignore the little voice in his head that perked up to tell him he'd never done this before, and that touching another boy with his hands was just a tad different from taking him into his mouth, and what if this was disgusting and what if he wasn't very good at it or-
"Yeah, good so far. They kept coming in waves for the first few days." Harry wearily spared a thought of thanks to Percy Weasley for bringing order to that situation; it hadn't been easy, having his small flat inundated by Weasleys off and on, no matter how well-meaning or welcome their presence. He let his head drop forward and rubbed the back of his neck, startled when Draco gently moved his hands away and started massaging it himself.
"When did I what?"
"What happened?"

"Right, Mum's finally gone round the twist," said Fred, entering the kitchen. "Dad wants to do a kid's craft that involves newspaper and glue, and Mum thinks it'll be lovely."
to laugh - in fact, many reasons to laugh, because Ben was out of the hospital, and Alec would get better, and Harry didn't have to keep facing any of this alone. Forget this pathetic façade of settling for Draco being just another good friend, forget pining and wishing and regretting.
They brought me to the doctor,
"Mmhhm..." Harry continued his unhurried progress downward, and didn't pause as he reached his destination and took Draco into his mouth in one slow, smooth movement.

"No. But that wasn't the main reason I did it. I mostly did it to protect him."
"Didn't you ever notice? You rolled your r's a bit more when I first met you."
"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the Hat a moment later, and the girl gave her brother an apologetic glance before moving to her new table.
Chorus
"Thank god." Draco let his head fall back against the couch as Harry rubbed the back of his neck, apparently trying to comfort him, and succeeding remarkably well.
"Which part?"
"My father wouldn't disown me."
Harry sighed, wondering if maybe he should pray too. For Alec's full recovery, for the publicity over Draco to die down... for restful sleep that wasn't plagued with flashbacks...
Draco's eyebrows went up.
Low lie the fields of Athenry
"Grow up," Bill said curtly, then turned his back on him. Fred made a rude gesture at his back and a vague wave of apology to Harry before leaving with another armful of papers. "I knew we were forgetting something," Bill said to Harry. "Howler wards."
Harry drew closer. He could feel Malfoy's heart racing, could feel just how desperately Malfoy wanted this, but he was hanging on by a thread and refusing to let himself move. Which was paradoxically comforting and frustrating, because as much as Harry wanted to do this on his own time, it was awfully difficult to take that first step. Their hands were clasped together and he could feel Malfoy's breath, and as Harry looked down and rested his forehead against him Malfoy gasped, startling Harry. He looked up slowly, almost dream-like, gazing into Malfoy's grey eyes, drawing his hand up Malfoy's arm, to his cheek, unable to breathe as Malfoy closed his eyes and leaned into his touch, overwhelming Harry with his inner turmoil, with the feel of him trembling at Harry's touch.
Draco opened his mouth and was saved from having to answer as an oddly familiar brown owl tapped at the window and Harry got up to let it in.
"I will."
Back at room, talk about how curse may have been deliberately miscast.
"He shouldn't have said-" Alec began, his voice shaking, and Harry nodded.

Kara choked on her drink. "Pumpkin juice?" she said, laughing, and caught a quick glance between Harry and Draco. Alec frowned at Draco and jutted out his lower lip at the mess on his plate.
(Women)
Harry was drifting slowly into consciousness, but the chair was so warm and soft and comfortable that all he wanted was to keep sleeping, maybe forever. He snuggled deeper into the comforter, the clean, homey scent of it filling him with images of pine trees and flowers and...
It was such a pure feeling, though. Seductive, addictive, clean and bright. Hatred for those who opposed them, for those who weakened them. And it was so hard to keep enough control to stop himself from focusing that powerful emotion on people who were part of this circle. Instead he thought as hard as he could of Peter Pettigrew, that loathsome little maggot whom they had to allow into their midst. Thought of Mad-Eye Moody and his rabid anti-Dark mania that had made it so difficult for Lucius to stay out of Azkaban sixteen years ago, and get out of Azkaban last year. Thought of the supercilious Aurors who had taken such delight in humiliating him and laughing at his helplessness while he was in a cell, so small and cold and dark, so - so much like a small room under a set of stairs... with a shock Lucius recognized a small version of Potter, recognized hatred boiling up out of Potter, towards... his Muggle relatives?
Awkward breakfast with Gryffindors. Pansy explains why she's still on Draco's side.
And what if he never got out again? What if-
She turned as the door to the treatment area opened and an exhausted-looking Healer came out.
"Yeah." Lindsay smiled at him. "My dad had to go to Azkaban, same as yours. He was just lucky that he wasn't as famous. But there've still been a few silly buggers who've tried to make trouble for us." She lifted her chin. "We don't let 'em."
taken the bloody picture.
Cornfoot's mouth quirked slightly and he leaned a little closer, pitching his voice a little louder but still low enough to not be overheard over the background hum of students working on their charms around them. "I am asking if you would like to engage in sexual activity."
Parkinson nods and gestures for Neville to put on the cloak and leave the hospital wing.
And they were going to wake up the boys. They hurried out of the bedroom, and Harry leaned back against the wall, letting go.
Now, if you want to see pictures drawn by somebody who's not trying to figure out which end of the pencil is pointy but who actually has talent, here's a few. Chibitoaster read and liked Bond, and asked if she could illustrate. After I picked my jaw off the floor and said yes, she started drawing. And so far, here's what she's come up with:
"Oh." Harry shot a furtive glance around for their waitress. "Erm, the bill."
"How did that come about?"
"Has he
Ben scowled at her, but Alec and Draco ignored him and they all started to sing. Harry blew out his breath and went to sit with Ben, taking out
Dark was the dungeon of Malfoy Manor, where Lucius often went to meditate and practice difficult spells. The dark was comforting in its own way, a counterpoint to light. Strange how the Dark was so feared by weak fools, who didn't understand that facing it and embracing it and bending it to your will was what power was all about.
Lay your head, lay your head, lay your head, lay your head on the greenman
"Ben, come on," said Draco impatiently. "We've told you, Alec's glasses don't help him see better indoors, like his uncle George's do. They help him see things that would be fuzzy otherwise, like my glasses."
He looked around his bedroom, with the myriad of empty potion bottles and spoons and children's books and stuffed toys scattered all about, and wondered if he should try to tidy up instead.
So, 6555 words later...
He'd relaxed when they'd sung a song together, though. That part had been fun.
"There were eight mauve cows mooing through our living room," said Demelza. "And maids and lords and so-called 'ladies,' and bloody bagpipers,
Neville's hiccuping, trying to get rid of the giggles, getting a little frantic, when Malfoy grabs his shoulders and gives him a shake. He braces for an attack, and is completely blindsided by what happens instead.
"Won't that interfere?" Draco gestured towards his keyboard.

and three repetitions of
"Oh." Harry sank into the chair next to Draco.
Oh, this is going to be a bloody long afternoon.
"What
Concrit is warmly appreciated. Thanks hugely to scrtkpr for beta!
"I just thought you'd get half of what I own if we divorced."
All right. They've all been pretty supportive.
"I doubt I will either," Malfoy said. "I'm not sure they can decide anything, though. We are both adults."
"Is... is there a chapel here?" Kara asked quietly.
He closed his eyes again, reaching for sleep.
Draco sighed and just let the answers come, letting everything, bad and good, tumble out. As with all his previous interrogations, this was just a bloody waste of time, and so bloody humiliating. And as always, it had nothing to do with anything remotely threatening to anybody. But the Aurors had to do their jobs, protecting the public from dangerous offenders like him. And Draco supposed that in this instance, asking about Draco's relationship to Harry, and Alec, and the Weasleys, was all part of protecting the public - which, after all, included Harry and Alec and the Weasleys.
"Swallow?"
"Not right now, Kara," Harry murmured.
He'd really thought girls would be a good antidote; he'd always liked them before, and they definitely didn't remind him of Harry. But maybe what he needed was another boy to take away memories of Harry. Drive Harry out of his thoughts and fantasies.
Harry frowned at him. "Not terribly thrilled at some tart of a waitress flirting with my spouse on our anniversary," he said, going for a light tone of voice and utterly failing.
Ben's eyes. His eyes as he watched cuffs go around Draco's wrists. Clinging to Harry as Draco was taken away. His small face going blank, as his memory of his very first day in the wizarding world was utterly wiped out. His excitement at seeing magical instruments, singing with Alec before a small audience of wizards, eating charmed sweets, going to broom shop with Harry - all gone. And all because Draco had been an irresponsible idiot and let himself believe in hope, and in Harry.
Molly and George drew in their breaths angrily. Malfoy pressed his lips together and looked away.
"Dobby."
"Draco, can ye help me clear?" she said, picking up the detritus of their meal. He nodded and picked up plates as Harry took the boys to the washroom to clean them up.
Draco shook his head.
These are lyrics to the song briefly mentioned in Ember to Ember, chapter 12 (May).
of doodling. Some of my doodles become story illustrations. No guarantee of quality here, folks. Caveat visor.
"You know," said Anne, "it's not exactly kind of you to get this amused when George is dealing with their mischief."
There was another long silence.
Molly gazed at Alec and Ben fondly, and tucked the blanket up a little higher on them both. "Take care of them, dear," she said to Harry, giving him a tight hug. She turned to go, then touched Draco's shoulder. "And please... take care of Harry."
"Really?"
He stopped the needles and quieted down a small toy broom that had begun humming in the toy box. Checked the wards around the study; they'd had to send their desktop in for repairs once already, as spells interfered with electronics. It had taken the techs a while to fix it, and Draco was half convinced it had just fixed itself once it was away from magic long enough.
Potions class, have to sit together.
"Never mind," Blaise repeated, annoyance tinged with affection in his voice. "It doesn't matter. He was off doing something terribly heroic, you could tell me but then you'd have to kill me, he got hurt, now he's better. That's really all anybody needs to know."
"Technically, to today."
"What do you like about it?"
Frankie O'Connor ducked his head,
"I don't know, several of your letters saying so might have tipped me off." Harry shifted closer on the couch and Draco took his mouth in a kiss. Mm, yes, very nice, the sharp taste and scent of Scotch blending with their kisses.
"See, Ellis, he's trying to keep his answers true, but vague and evasive. It's the only way you can hope to beat Veritaserum. It's a cinch to break through, though." He smirked. "What's your mother's maiden name?"
"Oh for heaven's-" Draco muttered a couple of things under his breath, and a few moments later he and Harry were done cleaning, and Alec was eating his chips contentedly.
"Which is why you're only doing this during the Astronomy lecture and dinner," Parkinson says impatiently. "You won't have to talk during either one."
"Do you want me to call her?" Hermione asked, recognizing the signs of being momentarily stuck between worlds. It was always a bit of an awkward mental switch, no doubt made more difficult by Malfoy's anxiety. "I do know how to use the phone."
hour,
Harry smiled tiredly, and Draco cleared his throat. "Demelza says Molly's coming in for her overnight shift."
"And maybe there's a fucking good reason for that, have you ever thought of that?!" he shouted.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
She could've done much worse than bringing into the world a wonderful little boy who loved her, but who seemed to prefer being with his father. The father she'd chosen for him was worth it. And the two of them shared a bond she didn't truly understand, but couldn't deny.
And he shall reign forever and ever
Minerva McGonagall, still the same stubborn humorless old bat she had been since Lucius' own schoolboy days.
And--"
For those in peril on the sea.
"Really. Trusting soul, isn't he?"
Harry swallowed hard, his pulse racing.
"Kara's been spending a lot of time with Ben lately," Draco said abruptly. "A lot more than I thought she would."
Flint's eyebrows went up. "Harry Potter gets it up the arse from you?"
"No, bloody hell."
"Obliviate."
(January).
Try to have lunch apart.
He had a sudden vivid image of Draco, so small, laughing in delight as Lucius spun him around; his hair blazing white, caught by a stray beam of sunlight shining into the nursery as he pulled himself up on an end table and tottered towards a house elf; shouting with joy the first time Lucius took him up in the air. Holding tight to Lucius as their broom rose up higher and higher, frightened, but trusting in his father to keep him safe.
She weighed her brother down with stones,
Lines of angry magic were crackling over Draco and Potter
And you know for a million years he has been your lover
"No, nor do I. My mother would have fits because you're male, and my father because you're Lucius Malfoy's son," Cornfoot said bluntly.
"Why would falling in love with Potter mess up-" Flint broke off. "Ah yes, if you hadn't fallen for Potter, you wouldn't have been spending so much time in the wizarding world, and you probably wouldn't have run into the fine citizens you ran into this afternoon, and you wouldn't be sitting here knowing that you're probably never going to see your son again. Right?"
Draco looked at him askance, and could almost hear Pansy saying "Honestly,
"But what's it mean, Daddy?" Alec asked.
3: DADA (Slytherin/Gryffindor)
Flint grimaced in disgust. "You're joking."
"Well?" said Flint impatiently.
"Fancy a shag, I said," Cornfoot said.
Draco kicked Potter in a hallway, then sank down beside him and held him close, Potter touched Draco's arm and faced down a sneering Auror in the hospital wing, held Draco close and whispered gentle words to him as Draco tensed in pain
"But bloody bond spell, powerful, isn't it? Can I have some water?"
"Goyle, Laurence," the professor said, and a dark-haired boy next to the girl with long braids gulped, glancing around the room nervously. The girl gave him a small shove and he moved towards the Hat. She watched him closely as the Hat deliberated over him.
"Mm. You're very... um... attractive when you come," Harry said, his voice low.
Fred's jaw clenched as he glared at Anne, trying to push away the nightmare memories of that night. The shock of realizing their sister was dying; the desperation with which Hermione and the Healers tried to save her; the first sight of Alec paling before the ache of knowing that Ginny was really gone. The way it felt like there wasn't enough air in the room, wasn't any way to come to terms with the fact that Ginny would never see the tiny baby nursing at Fleur's breast.
"Bottoms up," says Ron, bracing himself. Closes his eyes, takes in a mouthful, and swallows it down.
And lying, she knew, was a sin, a sin,

Back at school again, wondering if Lucius is all right.
Demelza shook her head. "They had a... disagreement. A few months back." George cleared his throat warningly. "That's all. Just a... private disagreement."
Ron entered, carrying a cup of tea and a newspaper. "Hi, Malfoy," he said pleasantly, putting them both on the side table. "How's Ben?"

An' they laid him out upon the bed

This was definitely not as bad as he'd thought it would be, he thought as he pushed Harry onto his back and nuzzled into his neck. Mother would probably be pleased to hear that missing the Manor for Christmas was not the disaster she'd feared it would be. Not that he would explain it to her. Not only was he more likely to get a spectacular haul of post-Christmas sweets if his mother felt bad for him, but "Dear Mother, Happy Christmas, having a wonderful time, Harry's a
"When did you figure it out?"
"Yes, Floo travel is a little difficult at first, I've heard," Arthur was saying sympathetically to Kara as they drew nearer. "Was that your first time?"
Since last I see you.
Malfoy nodded. "If that's all right," he said. He looked around. "Sorry I was late. Looks like the game'll be starting soon. You'd better go."
"We've blindfolded each other."
"He doesn't get attached to the girls I go out with. I make bloody sure of that."
"What's enough?"
Change and decay in all around I see;
happening, but he still didn't want to believe it. They were all gathered, and the magic was rising, waiting to draw all of them in, but it felt dreamlike, far away. As though they couldn't really be here, couldn't really be about to do this, such a mismatched group of people, such an unreal situation.
A few more years yet they will work while they can
Not only did she do them wrong,
All right, that's enough, he told himself sternly after a few minutes, getting control of himself and wondering at the euphoric feeling still flooding through him. Probably due to lack of sleep; the encounter hadn't actually been that funny. But it was all right; he could laugh, there was a
He blinked, startled, as his sight blurred and he felt coolness on his cheek, reached up and felt moisture on his fingers. Stared at them in puzzlement as his chest tightened, and his throat closed as a sob threatened to break free.
"Well then it's a good thing you can't marry a pureblood witch, because that's not how it would work. That's insane."

"No cherubs."
But aye to me he sings a sang,
and a string of phone numbers written on it.
Draco scowled at him.
Draco closed his eyes and breathed deeply, not sure whether to be grateful for the respite from their questions, or anxious that now he'd have no distraction from the dark thoughts that immediately surfaced as the door closed.
"Not to mention didn't consent to or even remember the blessed event in the first place," said Draco. "Bloody hell. What's the matter with her?"

solos, and he brought the kids back to the table where Harry and his family were sitting. He glanced around the place; about half the people in the audience seemed to be musicians and singers.
"Which one were we in again?" asked Demelza. "
"Circle dance group."
Draco's eyebrows rose. "Thank you."
Draco drew in his breath as a tear spilled down his cheek, and he looked away from Flint's mocking sneer.
Talk with the 'team' about going back to the dorms and other ways of dealing with the bond.
"Right, then, let's do it," says Ron, and pulls out a hair, handing it to Malfoy as Malfoy does the same. They silently add the white and pale orange hairs to each glass and watch them dissolve.
"Let's go back to the blindfolding. Who suggested it?"
I long to see you,
Sing rickety-tickety-tin,
Love and hate. As well ask this group to define itself.
"You know, you don't have to be here," he said to Draco. "I won't sleep anyway--"
Well, yeah, that part's unusual, but everybody's adjusted to it.
Draco gave a sigh and leaned forward, taking Alec's hand and murmuring to him reassuringly. Harry sat back, glancing at the paper as Draco began to sing softly.
I've a late meeting with an orchestra so I'll have to drop Ben off at 6, which I know is when the game starts. We'll meet you at the stadium. Please wear amulets.
Harry closed his eyes and held Draco closer.
"Why would I walk out on you again? There'd be no point, the entire Wizarding world already knows about--"
Draco rolled his eyes. "Kara, we've talked about this. We decided-"
Speaking of Potter - there he was, lying and mourning somebody, Narcissa's blood-traitor fool of a cousin, apparently. Lucius briefly regretted not having the freedom to allow himself to gloat properly at the image. His own memory of the time right after the Department of Mysteries was hideous enough; it was nice to see the Potter brat had suffered as well.
God, this was...
"I don't know..."
"Of course," said the Hat testily. "I don't place children where they don't belong."
"So, will your dad be sending you a Howler, then?" she asked him with a grin.
(Chorus)
Bring me my bow of burning gold!
Seamus had just finished the punchline to his hag, hippogriff and selkie joke, and Harry had laughed and turned to Draco in time to catch a half-amused glimmer in his eyes before Draco suddenly gasped and put a hand to his chest, dropping his glass of pumpkin juice. Harry felt the shock and grabbed Draco's hand, and instinctively pulled Draco to him as if he could physically take the pain and transfer it from Draco to himself.
Kara stared at them. It seemed unreal. A split was supposed to involve screaming and crying and slamming doors. Not this quiet, defeated, sorrowful parting of the ways. "This isn't how these things go," Kara said slowly.
Thanks so much to scrtkpr and kestrelsparhawk for wonderful and rather extensive beta :) :) :)

Hatred. It was far too easy to feel, and they all knew they would have to control it if they didn't want it to get out of hand.
Oh, oh, praise his holy name
They chop off our heads and they boil them in oil,
It missed, and landed on the bed,
The spell began and Lucius watched impassively as the three 'neutral' members of the inside circle linked their magic together. Soft lights glowing from all three wands, Esposito's, Pomfrey's and Dumbledore's, slowly coming together and mixing in the middle.
"Sorbet, please."
Fred frowned. "You can't blame people for holding a grudge. You may think it was no big deal-"
Blood was still pouring down his face, and he knew there was no point in wiping at it, but he tried anyway. His nose felt broken. The dull ache was the only thing he could really feel, besides Malfoy's fear. He spared Malfoy a quick glance, taking in his ashen features and the trickle of blood down his face - a split lip, from the looks of it, from the solid punch Harry had given him. Harry rubbed his knuckles, noting a few small cuts - probably from Malfoy's teeth. He took a deep breath as they went into the hospital, bracing himself for Madam Pomfrey's reaction.
Malfoy stared at him.
Draco blinked. "Back to work? I thought she was staying home with your kids."
"Trina," Kara corrected him.
"Don't worry about it. I wouldn't have expected you to."
Severus Snape, his friend and ally, joined to McGonagall.

"So, you like giving it to the hero of the wizarding world?"
Since last I see you,
"What was it like?"
Kara glared at him. "There's wee'ans listenin'," she reminded him, though Harry was actually keeping them nicely distracted.
"All right, you're not making any sense," Harry said after they were seated and the hostess had left.
For the lord God omnipotent reigneth
"Oh for fuck's sake, Anne," he snapped, tired of biting his lip till it bled. "Don't bloody well start that shit again!"

What does it do? wondered Ben. How does it decide? Why so quickly for some kids, and so slowly for others?
Must Jesus bear the cross alone
"What are you talking about?" Seamus frowns at her.
Harry winced, nodding.
None of them remember the last time the torment stopped, because it had stopped so many times. Stopped, only to return again, and in some ways the return was worse for the respite. Draco remembers just closing his eyes and going to sleep, knowing he'd be awakened when it began again. He thinks he was in the Gryffindor common room.
Fear. Dread. Nothing else.
Yesterday's papers telling
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
"Well?"
"Thank you," said Draco quietly.
Malfoy nodded cautiously.
Then he wanders home alone
"I'll arrange for transportation for her too," said Hermione, glad to have something to do, and went to the Muggle Help Desk, grateful that such a thing was finally available in the wizarding world. Grateful to spend the next fifteen minutes or so working with the witch on duty, getting a hold of Kara and arranging for transportation to St. Mungo's for her.
Ben's finally being released tomorrow, and wants to visit Alec. Can he come?
Harry nodded. "She's taken it pretty reasonably."
And to help him on his way each day,
"What?"
"Hm... I wonder, if Potter's boyfriend's a poofter, what does that make Potter?"
Draco laughed and kissed him, thrusting faster, and soon Harry was bucking against him, crying out his name-
"We're both single parents. It's complicated."
"Harry... Alec will be all right," said Malfoy. "You heard the Healers, and he was right next to Ben, they-"
"Harry, just say thank you."
"Shouldn't I be?"
Harry smiled ruefully. "I know the feeling. I keep feeling like I have to fight to clear my head all the time, because if I don't-" he stopped. Damn, this was not where he wanted to take this conversation. He sent a firm reprimand in the direction of his pants. "Well, you can probably guess what I end up thinking about," he muttered.
He'd acted in self-defence, Draco reminded himself as he was led down to the cells. He'd not caused any permanent damage, and he'd had good reasons for casting the spell he'd cast. And Harry would help. He might even be able to get others to help him - Granger and Weasley had seemed to like Ben well enough, and from what Harry had said, they had slowly come to accept Draco himself. Grudgingly, but they accepted him. Maybe they might help get him out of here soon.
"D-didn't go well?" George said dryly.
Harry closed his eyes, attempting to sort out Malfoy's feelings.
And he shall reign
"Why not?" Alec asked.
Hermione glanced around the stadium, happy to be out of the house and without children, but wishing her first child-free moment in a month wasn't at a Quidditch game. They were here for a good reason, she reminded herself. She and Ron had offered to accompany Harry to this game because he was their best friend, and he needed them right now, and they loved him and wanted to spend time with him. The venue didn't matter.
"Yeah, I was leaving school as you were coming in, and I was in Hufflepuff, so I doubt you'd remember me, but Marcus had stories about you. Said you were an arrogant brat and a whiny little shit." He smiled grimly. "So. Tell me, why wasn't this supposed to happen?"
Claes is translating Bond into French:
"John-" Ellis began.
"Well I have a job here! I have a life here!"
"We'll keep sharing him, one week with me, one week with you," she said reasonably. "I know this is putting you in a bit of a bind, so you can decide who gets him when, and what we'll do till you move to London. If you want, I'll take him fulltime till ye can get settled, or if you want to take him fulltime yourself, 'tis only fair-"
Carry me to somewhere, wherever
"Is this a one-time offer, or-"
"Vaguely," Draco said, and looked around curiously as they entered and waited to be seated.
Then again, with kids in the picture, there was really no such thing as romance any more.
God, yes, he's desperate for Malfoy to finally take him, to feel him inside, to seal the bond that's been between them for so long, it's been so many years and Malfoy's on top of him, hands setting him on fire, he's harder than he's ever been and he's begging Malfoy to touch him, so ready to be his, so ready to be - shaken, roughly. And have a blinding light shoved into his eyes.
When the stars fall, then I trust my Saviour
"They're very similar in many ways," Draco said coolly.
Lucius felt suspended in mid-air, watching in horror as Draco and Potter sank deeper into hatred and the others vainly tried to bring their fire under control, Severus and Lupin and Pomfrey and Zabini and Granger and Pansy and Weasley pushing memories towards them, Draco loaning Potter some ink, Potter smiling at Draco, images of peace and whatever affection his son and his spouse had managed to find for each other
Finally Malfoy cleared his throat. "All right," he said slowly. "I take it you do have a point, then? What is it?"
Harry started to pull back, mortified. "Don't," whispered Draco, tightening his grip. He hesitated, then plunged on. "I'm... a bit of a mess too." He laughed shakily, uncertainly. "D'you think we can put ourselves together? Your mess and mine?" He pulled Harry closer. "I... I love you. I told you, I'm not going anywhere. Not again."
Malfoy was finally moving, very carefully drawing Harry closer, and Harry tried so hard not to shake, but it was almost impossible. It was too much. Malfoy's breathing was laboured, his eyes clouded and unlike Harry had ever seen them. No mocking or superiority, just knife-edged desire and intense anticipation.
Harry rolled his eyes, finally regaining his equilibrium. "What's it like?" he asked curiously as Draco moved up beside him on the bed and lay down on his side.
"I dinna think so," said Auror One slowly, his eyes calculating. "He never has before."
"Good, good."
Down through the skin to the core
I've attached a list of the Muggle groups confirmed for Beltane so far. Alec did bring up choir.
Here are lyrics to songs mentioned at the end of chapter 5 of the
Kara's temper snapped, and to hell with the little ones, who were gaping at them both. "And for somebody born and bred in England, you're bloody quick to never say a fucking word in its defence!"
"Longbottom," Draco said flatly. "I told you, it's out of my system. I can lie again."
"Um." Harry broke their kiss, pulled away briefly. "We should, we should probably-" Malfoy's fingers tightened on the back of his neck and he came back to Malfoy's mouth, unable to stop a small moan, which turned into a groan as Malfoy pulled back.
"I... I think it's gone."
She did not have her family long.
And it can't help that he can probably feel how upset we all are over... all of this. It can't help that his home is being vandalized and we're all starting to fear for his safety, and his dad's.
Would that more adults could behave with the courage and dignity that these young gentlemen have demonstrated.
Draco nodded, grateful for the topic change and nervously hoping his body would seize this excellent opportunity to settle a bit before he went back onstage. "Only thing that's upsetting her a bit is that Ben's already losing his accent. Don't think Kara realized that was going to happen."
Draco chuckled. "Don't change the subject. What would you do?"
The fourth, the fifth
"Our anniversary."
"So now you've got it back. Or you did, before this last little stunt." He chuckled. "Have any fantasies about him?"
Flint rolled his eyes. "Oh that's right, you're all reformed and new and improved," he sneered. "So how'd you end up with a son with one of them, then? And a woman, too. Was that on purpose, or did you just get confused?"
"Yes."
"Got into your shop's fireworks?" guessed Ron.
Seamus narrows his eyes at her. The hell with this sanctimonious prejudiced Slytherin bitch. The hell with her precious Slytherin friend, for that matter. Seamus sure as hell doesn't need to waste his time pretending to be the bigoted little bastard just to keep him safe from his lunatic of a father.
"Who the
Harry frowned. "But we're supposed to meet them at 7:30."
"I thought you liked Umbridge."
"Sex with a famous man. Does that turn you on, his fame?"
"You're damned right."

I will not cease from mental fight,
"It's just like a CD," Malfoy said. "Except you don't need a machine to play it for you; just a wand."
And her face in a hideous grin, a grin,
Kara turned to Draco as Trina went to the kitchen. "Will you stop that, you arse?" she said, keeping her voice low. "You can bloody well remember her name, you know."

"Oh yeah." He yawned. "Yeah, of course. Bloody hell," he mumbled as he started to drift off. "This is the best Christmas holiday ever."
"Aren't you worried about all of this?" Charlie said.
"Teresa, Trina, what's the difference?"
Draco chuckled. "Really? Still?"
It couldn't have. It had almost gone out of control, but they had pulled back before any lasting damage was done. Lucius repeated that thought like a mantra as the Healers examined both boys, their wands creating complex patterns, flickering in the candlelight.
Fred pressed his lips together. Yes, he knew. He knew very well.

"Kara, let's see if I can help you with that toy." Bill bundled Kara and the boys all back to Ben's room.
had that been all about? I love you, the war's over?
Draco looked down. "It's... I am really s--"
"So, Gryffindor, then?"
Neville remembers that during one of the times Malfoy felt relatively fine, he played Dragon Rummy with Neville while Harry slept, exhausted from being up all night. And at one point Malfoy had winced and caught his breath, Neville asked if maybe he should wake up Harry, and Malfoy shook his head impatiently.
"What part o' your past?"
," Harry gasped, and Draco decided to abandon any pretence of teasing or going slow; they were both much too far along for that. He took Harry into his mouth again, moving his tongue and increasing the suction, and the spike of arousal jumped impossibly high and he felt Harry's orgasm begin, and moved off before Harry could touch his head in warning.
"I don't notice it. Not sure if it's that I got used to it or you don't do it any more."

"Fuck chivalry!" Fred snapped. "I won't put up with my mother shunning you; I'm not putting the kids through that."
"Bloody hell... you've... got the worst sense of comic timing..." he whispered, his eyes closed, head beginning to move back and forth on the pillow, hips coming up to meet Draco's thrusts. "Draco, come on. Please. I need to come.
"Yes."
"And what happened to 'violence is never an answer'?"
Draco wiped at his eyes, finally settling himself down as well. "Screaming nightmares. Yeah." He sighed and shook his head ruefully. "I'd say a few of them will."
world, Harry," Draco said, his voice strained. "I've made a life for myself and Ben here. I'm a respected teacher. People know my name, and it doesn't make them flinch or hate me. They don't know what this means," he said, baring his forearm, with its snake and skull tattoo. He gazed at it dispassionately, then looked up at Harry. "You can't even look at it."
"We call upon male and upon female," Esposito said, and Lucius noted that most of the others had images of parents and spouses. Arthur Weasley, how charming. And he wasn't entirely sure if Weasley Jr. thinking of Granger was more or less distasteful than thinking of his frumpy mother would have been. Though at least she apparently cleaned up rather nicely; that memory had to be from the Yule Ball held during the year of the Triwizard Tournament. Pity about the teeth.
It was... it was pretty difficult. We had to leave our dorms, move into our own quarters, which was a bit of a shock. Switch a bunch of our classes so we could attend together, and we both had to drop out of Quidditch.
There was a long silence, and Harry wished he could reach out to him again, but there was a barrier between them now. Had been, ever since their break-up, only briefly vanishing during the first horrific hours in the hospital. And he was too exhausted right now, too battered by fatigue and all of the emotions of the last few days, to do more than wish that barrier gone. Maybe if he'd had more energy, he might have been able to reach out, or to try to fight for them, but...
And if my heart crumbles into rust
"I suppose so. I'm used to it."
"A Time Turner."
Draco pulled back.
"The part where it's past noon and we've still not got dressed but we've already shagged twice and... well, done this." He grinned. "I could think of worse ways to spend the holidays."
"Mm. Miserable bastard anyway. Y'know I always wanted to be like him. He was so strong. He was really nice, too, sometimes. D'you know he got me a baby dragon, when I was a kid? And he used to take me flying when I was really small. But he was such a bastard."
King of kings forever and ever hallelujah hallelujah
His head felt heavy which made him shake
"We talked about it?"
"Ooh, kinky."
"Anything kinkier? Role-plays, things like that?"
Fred quickly grabbed his wand and flicked it, taking Anne's wand away, casting a Mufliato spell on them and a Cheering Charm at Michelle, then Banishing both wands to a locked cupboard.
He's gone from grudging acceptance to forgiveness, Ron thinks. He'll have to talk to Hermione about it.
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
Bonnie Charlie's gone away
In his worn out shoes?
Pansy lets Draco know she knows about him and Harry, and warns him that his father will kill him if he finds out.

Malfoy hesitated, then shook his head. "I'll be there later."
Bloody hell, this was far more depressing than any of her own break-ups. Kara sighed and went into the kitchen. She poured herself some gin, hesitated, then poured another for Draco, bringing it to him in the living room, where he was staring out the window blankly.
"What's she saying? Is she defecting?" Harry asked.
