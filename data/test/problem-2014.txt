"Bilbo Baggins," Draco said, and the man huffed as he swung his frame forward. Draco wasn't exactly sure who the short man with large hairy feet was supposed to be, and the last time he'd asked, the man had stared at him with narrowed eyes until Draco had given up and walked away.
He jumped, cursing as his fingers scraped against solid stone with no handholds or anything. No way he was climbing out of this pit. He was pretty stuck. Well, until whoever had set up the trap came to check it again. He tried not to consider how long that could be.
He lasted until dinner, stewing over what Hagrid had told him and telling himself that he must have gotten it wrong. Then he'd caught Draco looking at him again, guilty silver-gray eyes locked on Harry's face, and he'd snapped. He'd glared back and felt a horrible kind of satisfaction when Draco paled, turning his head away with a flinch. He sat at the Slytherin table for another minute or so before finally just getting up and leaving the Great Hall completely.
And the snake tumbled over itself, skidding toward the fire, stopping maybe a foot away. Blaise kicked out, his left foot connecting with the giant snake's body, and both him and Luna watched as the snake went into the fire, the lion consuming her. A loud scream sounded around them, making Blaise cover his ear as the snake went up in smoke.
"Granger and Weasley wanted my help, and I said no," he said, picking up a big twisted piece of metal that Draco had no idea what it was. Harry made a face and threw it over his shoulder. "I don't really know very much about what happened with the DA."
“Yes,” Severus answered, and Lucius hated the way he said it. He had thought they were passed this. This… mistrust. He had asked Severus to marry him for Merlin’s sake. And even though Severus had said yes, he hadn’t meant it. That much was clear to Lucius now.  He just wished he understood why.
"What?" Granger blinked, her eyes flicking around the room as she thought. "But— that would completely disrupt the Prefects and the teachers."
She'd healed his ribs and arms easily but there was no cure for the pain in his head. Ron and Hermione had made it to the infirmary about half an hour before Harry had arrived. Ron was in the bed next to his, and Harry kept hoping Hermione would understand his silent hint to not come near him.
And then Harry was there, pulling his hands away and pressing his wand against Draco's forehead. He saw Harry's lips moving but couldn't hear the words above the horrible screeching coming from the school. Then suddenly, the screeching dropped an octave and then dropped again, becoming a faint buzzing in the back of Draco's mind.
He should have been mad. He would have been mad a year ago. A bone deep anger with yelling and throwing things that would never have let the hurt in. Now, he could barely be pissed. Now he couldn't do anything about the way Draco continued to avoid him, because yes, Harry had done a lot wrong. But he had been starting to think Draco wasn't one of them.
"What?" Harry blinked, somehow managing to look away from Malfoy's fluttering eyelashes. Seriously, how did he have such long eyelashes?
"I mean, we should sneak into the Slytherin commons and have a look at Malfoy's room. If it's all messed up like Zabini says then that's a point in his favor, right?"
"I can keep a secret," Draco interrupted, and Harry must have caught his meaning, because he blushed, glaring across the table and refusing to drop his gaze. It wasn’t attractive.
"As if I would want to be in the same department as you," Harry snapped back, watching in satisfaction as Malfoy's smile dropped. He pushed himself off Harry's desk, his shoulders tense as he moved across Harry's small office.
"Back with us, then, Potter?" Zabini called, his Thestral flying a few meters away. Bellatrix was riding the third Thestral, staring off with a vacant expression that made Harry sure Zabini was still using
"Please, Draco?" Harry said, his green eyes in full pleading mode now, leading Draco down, down, down and to his doom. He knew he wouldn't say no in the end, no matter how hard he tried to resist. "I need to know how to close my mind. I don't want him to be able to— Or-or… Draco,
"I'm not talking about being attracted to him or anything like that, I'm talking about have you told him how you really felt about Narcissa, how you've really been in love with him all this time-."
"Your progress this year is atrocious." Professor Snape said, and he blinked. "Due to this, I will be accompanying you home this summer and giving you extra lessons." Professor Snape narrowed his eyes as his whole face lit up. "Make no mistake, this will be a hard summer for you, Potter." He nodded vigorously, though he didn't really mean it. Professor Snape didn't have a clue what his summers were really like. "Good, I'll send the letters to your… family," Professor Snape's lip curled over the word and he thought maybe, just maybe he was worth more than just a name to someone after all.
“Come in,” he called back. Lucius knew Scrimgeour was coming today. He’d probably been waiting for him to leave. He’d probably been waiting for the right moment to swoop in and check if Severus was wearing his ring now.
"Someone went into her room," Malfoy muttered, already running toward the inn doors, and Harry blinked once, twice, staring after him and wondering what the Hell he was talking about. "Potter!" Malfoy called over his shoulder, sounding exasperated; Harry jumped, looking up at Jasmine's shared room with her lover to see the light on, a shape moving around on the inside, and he remembered abruptly that they still had a job to do.
"I hate Harry Potter," Draco said, and it was only as he was saying the words that he realized how much of a lie they really were. "I want nothing more than to see him expelled or something of the like."
"That's what I believe," Dumbledore answered. "A few months after their marriage, Tom Riddle returned to his manor house and spoke of being hoodwinked and taken in. I'm sure he was then free of her enchantment. In any case, he had left Merope while she was pregnant, and she died soon after, leaving Tom Riddle junior to be raised in an orphanage."
"Harry needs Occlumency lessons. He can't keep going the way he is." Before Dumbledore could answer one of the portraits returned, panting against his frame.
Draco supposed he should have found that offensive because really this was a Weasley not only insulting him but Harry also, but the whole thing was ridiculous. And suddenly he was laughing. Laughing so hard he couldn't stop himself, and it felt so good after days of not even remembering how to smile.
Lucius returned Severus' intense look, waiting for a response that he knew would come when Severus was ready. Lucius almost sighed, almost. They were always so careful around each other; never letting anything slip. They'd know each other since Hogwarts, and they'd never really trusted each other. He didn't even know how he convinced Severus to come over for tea; it wasn't as if the man was particularly fond of the practice or of Lucius in general. Though he supposed it was always better to keep your enemies close.
"I'm going to find Malfoy," Ron answered, and Harry was pretty sure his knuckles were starting to turn white on his wand.
"Lucius?" his mother poked her head out of her study, fixing her pale eyes on them. "What's going on?"
"Mad!" Draco asked, sniffing haughtily. "You were going to leave me to deal with Twin Weasley’s pranks without your protection. I could have been turned purple." Draco contemplated
"What is it, Potter?" Severus voice rose from his back room a second before he did. Harry’s face promptly smoothed as the disgruntled Professor moved to stand in front of him, looking impatient. He must have been brewing something; Severus smelled of dirt and roots, his hair full of oddly smelling smoke.
"What is that supposed to mean?" Harry snapped, narrowing his eyes and deciding he much preferred it when Ron was choking.
"Harry," Hermione said. She was standing just outside the office, waiting for him as he slammed the door behind him. "You can't go by yourself."
"Ugh." Ron groaned. "Can we please talk about something besides Harry's relationship problems?" Ron's face was bright red with embarrassment. Probably he knew more about Draco than he'd ever wanted to. Harry smiled and started walking again. Ron really could have reacted to everything with Draco so much worse.
"Indeed, our fear was well founded," Dumbledore said. "Many times, your trust in Draco was of overwhelming use in keeping you safe."
Harry turned his head, looking up and meeting Draco's eyes with those green eyes. Draco immediately looked away; he didn't
Severus curled his lip, resisting the urge to roll his eyes at the Minister. They still wanted him gone, even after he’d been a part of defeating Voldemort. There had been a brief negotiation period where they’d been insufferably polite, but it had boiled down in the end to them not wanting the next generation of Hogwarts students to be taught by former Death Eaters.
"Perhaps you'd like to take the cabinet now?" Borgin asked with just a little too much hope in his voice. Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes as he looked at Borgin with indignant eyes. Borgin had the decency to flush and look away as Draco turned to leave.
"That's not—" Potter started, he held his hand out as if he would touch Draco, but Draco stood, backing away from him. He didn't want Potter touching him. He didn’t want that feeling of release that only Potter gave him. Not right now.
"I don't know if that's a complement or not, Draco," Harry said. Wary. Hopeful. Draco shouldn’t have been so eager to reassure him. He didn’t even know what he was reassuring him of.
Harry sighed, poking at his own breakfast and wishing he had an appetite. His eyes flicked up to the Slytherin table where Draco was firmly ignoring him, keeping his eyes on Pansy and then his food and then Pansy. His silver-grey eyes didn't so much as flicker in Harry's direction. Though as Harry watched, Draco cleared his plate and stood from his table, heading for the doors of the Great Hall with a brisk pace.
"Don't act innocent!" Ron said, fumbling for his wand, and Harry immediately yanked it from his grasp, ignoring Ron’s betrayed scowl. He really didn’t want this to turn into a duel. "We
"It's not about the prophecy!" Draco snapped, whirling around. His eyes were blazing, that beautiful silver color that Harry had missed
"Yes, well. Voldemort didn't know you." He turned to Harry. "would possess the 'power the Dark Lord knows not'—"
And Dracona was snapping forward, her palm connecting with Harry's face before she could think of what she was doing, and it wasn't even that she was mad; she was just so…
"Yes," he said, his eyes shifting to begin glaring at the window as if it had caused all his problems. "Yes, I know. The world needs the bloody savior of the universe. And I'm so fucking tired of trying to be angry about something I can never change." Severus didn't have an answer to that. He supposed he should tell Harry to stop being angry, to accept his fate, but he knew that if he was in the boy's shoes he would never be able to do that. Hell, He
“Draco,” Lupin said, his voice suddenly tired and full of remorse as he turned to Draco. “You have to understand." And he sounded just like the man who had offered to help Draco, who had stood in the woods and told him his story. "I never really wanted to involve you, Draco. I would never have exposed your secret the way Nott did. Still, I was extremely displeased to hear that you were mated to Harry."
"How do you know? How do you know anything about being a werewolf? I can explain some of things you're feeling."
"We brought food," Severus said. "Draco's potions should also be wearing off, so I brought him more."
Lucius was a pureblood. He was not. Lucius was rich. He was not. Lucius was beautiful. He was… not. He didn't understand and no amount of contemplating could make him.
"Don't decide too quickly," a new woman came into the corridor; her black hair fell past her shoulders, ending at the small of her back and shimmered in the low light as she walked. And she was… beautiful; high cheekbones with slanting dark eyes and full lips that barely trembled as she spoke. "I don't want to be caught off guard," she said, her voice low and echoing and the sound sent a shiver down Harry's spine. And he was suddenly tilting forward, his body moving before his mind caught up with his actions, trembling as the woman before him continued to speak, low and entrancing.
"I assure you, it's quite true," Dumbledore answered, and Draco sat down heavily next to him, burying his face in his hands.
hugged. They'd certainly never done it before, and Severus had never been one for hugging. With the way Harry was reacting, Draco would say no.
"We should-," Harry started just to end the tension in the room, but Draco was already talking over him, apparently having anticipated how he would change the subject.
"Drop it," Harry snapped, his voice harsh. But when he turned his head to look at Draco, his emerald eyes were full of pain.
Hermione was on her feet immediately, springing to the front of the room in an effort to show off. Harry, however, was staring at Lupin with a mixture of disbelief and hate. Draco watched the way Lupin's jaw tightened and decided now was not the time for the silent battle going on between the two. As much as he wanted Harry to win, he didn't think it would benefit anyone if he started firing curses at their Professor. He nudged Harry and was rewarded with a glare that turned into a sigh and then Harry was rising out of his seat to stand opposite Granger, his wand slipping from his robe to be held loosely between his fingers.
Petunia took to making him wash the dishes in boiling water till his hands were red and bleeding, insisting that he just couldn't get that polish she liked. Vernon would order him to wake up at the crack of dawn to organize something or other of his business papers and then get home and keep him up till after midnight with some such other nonsense. He was always exhausted, his hands were always on fire, and his body was always on the point of collapse. But it was preferable to what it had been before.
Potter stepped around the corner first, freezing at whatever he saw, and Luna was backtracking, back into Blaise, stepping on his toe. And all Blaise saw was a flash of bronze white skin, jagged silver spikes and large bat-like wings before the fire was tumbling toward them.
Eventually, Slughorn seemed to notice the time, and he sent them their separate ways with a smile and an invitation to come see him anytime. Harry stepped into the darkened corridor with Ginny on his one side and Neville scrambling to keep pace on his other side.
So, he had crawled to the portkey, and he had gotten away. It hadn't even been hard. Voldemort had thought he was beaten—and he'd been right. Cedric was dead.
Voldemort was standing above Harry, his wand pointed into his face. Harry was panting and gasping, his eyes glazed as if he were just coming out of the
He'd been waiting by the fireplace for a long time. Too long to be acceptable. He'd known Narcissa knew what he was doing, but he didn't much care—she knew how he felt. They had spent one passionless night together a little over a year ago—after years of working themselves up to doing it at all. They'd both been relieved when Narcissa had turned out pregnant from it. It wasn't that they hated each other; they actually were good company when they were in the mood. It was simply that the marriage wasn't what either of them had wanted.
"I think you can't help yourself from saving people. And I think," Draco had swallowed, an unusually harsh sound from someone so graceful. Draco had known. He’d accepted they wouldn't last; he had always known it. "I think that I can't watch you die."
He flinched when a scream broke through the ringing in his ears. It took him a second to realize it was his own. His voice was hoarse as the sound burned its way out of his torn windpipe. He tried to peel his eyes open to find out what was happening to him. What was opening his throat and letting blood run down his chest and onto the ground under him?
"Draco Malfoy says I not to be telling Harry Potter," Dobby said, trying to grab hold of the desk again.
"Said something about sending a letter." Ron waved a hand dismissively and turned back to his bacon.
And Harry was screaming for a long time after that, and he could hear Voldemort laughing and Bellatrix cackling, and he was arching his back and there were tears in his eyes and—Then it was over. He gasped into the ground, closing his eyes to stop the wetness in his eyes from leaking out. It was funny, he had only cried once, one tear in front of Severus but it was as if the flood gates had opened. Every little thing that he'd never had to fight against, made him have to fight to keep the tears and the emotions from overwhelming him, and he was so sick of it.
was going to fix that. And Lucius was still teaching potions, having become a better head of Slytherin house than Severus had ever been.
"Yes, I'm sure you are." Umbridge giggled again, her pitch somehow raising higher. "You know, Draco. You really are your father's son. He would be proud."
"Harry," Draco whispered, his voice hoarse and full of answering lust. Harry's eyes widened, and it was suddenly so hard to breathe as his eyes met Draco’s silver-grey. And then Draco's lips were against his, hot and wet and moving with that passion that was unequal to any other feeling. He reached for Draco, wanting—
He hesitated before knocking on Severus' office door. He could tell by the voices inside that Lucius was there. He wasn't exactly sure what was happening between them, but he could tell from Severus's continued distress that he didn't like it, and he could tell from what Lucius had said, that he didn't understand why. Frankly, Harry was getting tired of hearing about Lucius' relationship problems.
It was the strangest of things that broke him out of his melancholy. He'd been walking up the steps, thinking about the Triwizard's task that was the next day. Dragons. Severus had refused to help him, though he had happened to leave some very helpful books laying around. He supposed he should have been coming up with some kind of plan; he should have been thinking about how he could defeat the dragon, but he just couldn't find it in himself to care whether he lived through the first challenge.
"Are you going to yell at me?" Draco asked, his voice low and void of emotions. Harry's hand itched to reach for his wand, to curse Draco, to do anything that would make Draco feel something,
Trelawney slowly sank back down into the swirling silver mass, leaving the room in a deafening silence. Harry leaned back in his chair; he really felt like he couldn't breathe. It was bad enough that he felt so overwhelmed; he needed to take time to not make a sound and process, but when
"Yes, and so does Potter," Severus said, scribbling a D across the top of a paper before moving to another. "Hopefully, the boy if not so stupid as to let his emotions get in the way of what's good for him."
He stepped forward, taking Harry's chin in his hand and pulling his face back around until green eyes met his again. Harry look up at him, startled and harassed, though Draco supposed he hadn't flinched when Draco had reached out, which was progress.
"You can at least attempt to be nice, Potter," Draco answered, and Harry raised his other eyebrow, looking at him as if Draco was the one being ridiculous.
Fortunately, after a couple weeks, Black apparently decided it was time to take them to Diagon Alley to buy their school supplies. The stepped out of Grimmauld Palace to find a ministry car waiting for them. Draco hesitated while Harry just sighed as if he had been expecting this.
"….Yes," Draco answered, dropping Potter’s hand. Of course, Potter was suspicious. They weren’t friends. They were enemies, and Draco was offering to
"And now, Harry Potter!" he said. "'The Chosen One,' they're calling you now!" Harry just looked back at him, holding his tongue and hoping Slughorn wouldn't ask him anything else. The rest of the room was staring at him, waiting for him to say something as Slughorn went on. "Of course, one doesn't know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes—but there does seem to be little doubt given the number of witnesses, that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!"
"You were never there for me. You never asked me if I was alright. You chose to believe in a version of me that suited you, and even when everything about me didn't fit that version that you'd made, you still convinced yourself he existed. That's not friendship. I'm not even sure what that is."
"Friends." He confirmed. Lucius dropped his hand and turned away, immediately dropping his smile in favor of staring out the window. He didn't talk to him the rest of the way to Hogwarts. And he didn't touch him again for a long time after.
"I've never been able to tell her exactly how I felt before," he said, his hand squeezing tightly around Draco's. "It was… interesting to finally get the closure."
Harry seemed different in the forest. He was more relaxed, running his hands across the pads of leaves as he passed and turning his head this way and that, his green eyes bright and focused. For the time, he seemed truly alive. Not the parallel to living he'd been doing that consisted of shuffling around and scowling at anyone that dared to talk to him, but alert and… at peace.
“Headmaster Snape, if you don’t mind,” he corrected. The Minister just turned his face away, the sneer already forming on his lips.
Mwahaha. The last chapter will be posted tomorrow along with the beginning of the sequel! Thank you for all your wonderfulness! :)
Harry, however, couldn't care less about any of that. He honestly just wanted to talk to Draco. It had been a week and he still hadn't been able to ask the other boy about what he'd heard when Voldemort was possessing him. He didn't even know if he'd really heard it or if his mind was just creating things when he thought he was going to die. His chest hurt at that very idea.
"Yes," he answered, and her hand tightened on his arm expectantly. "You should get it." She obviously expected him to offer to get it for her. Just as she was expecting him to treat this like a date. He stepped away from her, disentangling his arm from her sweaty grip.
Draco was hiding something. He knew something was going on that he didn't know about. He was so tired of being kept in the dark.
"What are you doing?" He had asked and for some reason, hadn't been surprised when it had answered back.
Draco found Harry in the astronomy tower. It had been five days since his first change; he'd spent an extra-long time in the forest, trying desperately to come out but not being able to.
"That's exactly what I'm saying," Lucius answered, his smile thin and sweet and directed right at Adarins. "After all, how can we expect them to learn if we don't give them enough room to."
The room was about what he expected, all whites, silvers, and greens with large furniture and a large blazing fireplace. Draco sat in the absolute center of the room, sitting crossed legged on a large Slytherin green couch.
Hermione was standing in the same place she'd been twenty minutes ago, hugging Ron tightly. Malfoy stood stiffly beside them, shifting uncomfortably. He looked a mess, his hair tangled around his shoulders; one of the buttons on his shirt was missing, and Harry could tell that his wrists had been rubbed raw from the ropes.
"Yes, of course," Lucius answered, stepping aside to let Severus into the infirmary. He swept in, heading for Draco's bed with Lucius on his heels. Draco was on his back, the blood-stained clothes he'd arrived in gone, replaced by a crisp white button up and slacks. His throat was covered in thick white bandages extending partway down his chest.
"Indeed," Malfoy answered, and Harry had a feeling if they weren't talking to a witness, his top lip would have curled when he said it.
Finally, Draco managed to slip away, snatching her confiscated Quibbler off her desk and fleeing out the door before she could think to say anything else to him. He flicked his wand, reversing his spell and blinking at the page.
"Bloody Hell, Harry, because-," he stopped abruptly as the door opened to his right, and Severus stepped through, dark eyes focused on Draco with an expression he couldn't read.
"I, uh," the dark-haired boy shifted, looking past him and at the wall as if hoping something would happen.
He wanted to talk to Potter. To say something—anything that might make up for what had happened in the woods. Not that he even understood what had happened, but he did understand that Potter was upset. And he understood that he had crossed some kind of line that he had
"Draco," a voice said, and he tried to open his eyes, hissing as the light stabbed him through the iris'. That
Lucius cocked his head, listening to the boy's retreating footsteps. He didn't understand. What had happened to the Wizarding World’s Golden Boy to make him seem so… Hostile? So... Broken?
"I…" Malfoy stared at him, trailing off as if he didn't have an answer to that. And he probably didn't. Harry resisted the urge to sneer. Spoiled little pure blood that he was, everyone probably always made sure everything
Needless to say, Hermione was shocked to wake up and find Harry doing homework. He just shrugged and said he couldn't sleep. She narrowed her eyes, suspicious practically leaking out of her but didn’t say anything. Ron came down the stairs a few minutes later, and they all headed down to breakfast together.
"I knew we shouldn't have trusted him!" Ron said. His face was about as red as Harry had ever seen it, his eyes narrowed and his hand clenched tight around his wand. It was about as mad as Harry had ever seen him, and he didn’t understand why the sign had caused such a reaction.
He didn't know how long he was there, writhing and screaming. He didn't know when the begging turning to snarling or when his hands turning to paws. He wasn't sure when the desire for the pain to stop turned into the desire to hunt, to kill, to feed. But it did.
Dumbledore stood from behind his desk, his stary robes shimmering as he moved. Draco glared across the room from him, if he hadn’t been holding onto Harry, Harry would have missed the tension in his shoulders. Finally, Dumbledore turned away and began to issue orders about retrieving Mr. Weasley to the portraits around the room.
"No!" Draco snapped. "No more lies." Harry looked at him for a long minute, green eyes tight on his face, and Draco could almost
He didn't understand how this had happened, how Draco had managed to worm his way inside Harry. How he had managed to flip a switch in him that he had never wanted back on. He cared about Draco—maybe Draco was right, and he always had, but at least before he had been able to lie to himself about it.
"Was this when we were arguing about the Dark Lord?" Severus asked, frowning as if trying to remember.
"I'm sorry," he let his hand drop, letting go of Harry's wrist. He flexed his hand as if that would make it feel better. "You don't know how much."
"Harry," Draco said, lifting his head just enough to look at him through his lashes. "We don't have to do anything else." And Harry knew he was serious, that he wouldn't push him, but he could also see the frustration in his eyes, he could feel Draco's cock hard against his thigh, and as much as all that scared him, he wanted it. He wanted it so badly it hurt.
"You know we'll have to talk about it eventually," Draco said, his voice a whisper of a breath against Harry's hair. He hated himself for bringing it up, for saying anything, especially with Harry so relaxed against him. But he couldn't keep ignoring what was right in front of them. He couldn't keep turning his face away from the reason Harry was so tense, so afraid to be touched.
"Ok, time to stop being cryptic now, Harry," Draco told him, and for some reason, this made Harry's lips twitch, which only increased the feeling that Harry was messing with him.
Draco had tried to reach out to Potter, but Blaise could have told him how well that would have worked. Or at least how well it had worked every time Blaise had gotten himself into such a state. He wondered why Potter felt that way; he wondered about the gentle frustration he saw in Draco's eyes whenever he looked over at him.
"Of course you did," Harry said. Dumbledore just smiled, his eyes twinkling with an affection Harry wasn't used to being directed toward him.
“I mean,” Dean said, setting his own quill down and swallowing as everyone turned to look at him. “He doesn’t sleep in the boy’s dorms, he doesn’t talk to anyone, he’s moody, I’ve seen him going into the Forbidden Forest more than once, and well…”
And it wasn’t that Draco didn’t listen to him on a daily basis, but he’d never bothered to make a point to ask him every five minutes what he wanted. Honestly, it was beginning to grate on Harry’s nerves. If Harry didn’t like what they were doing, he would let Draco know. Just like he’d always done.
Severus stood, moving unsteadily to the fireplace. He sent a quick floo message to Dumbledore telling him what was going on before stepping through the fire and answering Lord Voldemort's call. He was prepared for the pain that was coming. He had, after all, not fulfilled the task that had been assigned to him.
Harry opened his eyes to look past Cho and locked eyes with Draco. He was watched the two of them with shaded silver-gray eyes. He blinked and suddenly it was Draco he was kissing, backed up against a wall, his hands pinned above his head, his mouth being ravaged. He knew Cho was watching and he didn't care. He just didn't want Draco to stop.
to be doing homework; Harry hadn't opened a textbook while he'd been there, choosing instead to flip through a history of Hogwarts while alternating staring at Draco. And even now, he still didn't stop staring at Draco with a raised eyebrow.
He bowed to them both, ignoring Ron completely and beaming at Harry as if there was no possible way he could refuse. Draco wrinkled his nose, his grey eyes focused on Slughorn with scorn so obvious that Harry really didn’t know how the man was somehow oblivious to it. Or maybe he was just doing a really good job ignoring it.
"Come now, Harry. We haven't all night," he said, winking shrewdly. Harry swallowed nervously before walking carefully after the headmaster. They strode up the path, which was trimmed to a T and completely aesthetically pleasing. Harry hated it. It was too perfect.
He used to at least eat once a day, if only because he hated the way not eating made him feel weak. Even if he had to eat in the kitchens with the house elves, he would do it. But recently, he couldn't find it in himself to go eat. He had a job to do.
“I imagine you have,” Lucius answered quietly, and he knew he was just on the verge of rude, but really, why this wizard was talking to him in the first place was beyond him. “What with me being a Death Eater and everything.” The wizard’s smile tightened for a fraction of a second, his eyes locked on Lucius’ as if he was about to say something they would both regret. Then he chuckled, and it was almost convincing.
except that when either Lovegood or Harry tried to explain it to him, they both started talking more nonsense instead of really explaining.
"It doesn't exactly sound like my problem," he answered, returning Lucius' gaze easily. Lucius almost snarled; Draco could see the faint twist of his mouth as he caught himself at the last moment. He suddenly wished he wouldn't. He wished his father would just yell and tell him what he was actually thinking instead of trying to act like the perfect pureblood that was unaffected by anything. Draco wondered briefly is his father every got tired of the act—Draco was sure tired of acting himself.
He paced across the corridor, stopping just outside of Lupin's personal space and making the werewolf turn toward him with a wary expression.
to be an idiot at least realize the consequences of your actions first." His hand dropped even further, massaging Harry's now half-hard groin. Harry immediately groaned, pushing into the sensation. Draco chuckled, lowing his mouth to Harry's jawline.
Severus’ head shot up, his eyes wide, and Draco’s grip on Harry’s hand turned borderline painful as he shot from his seat. Lucius just continued to smirk, his fingers caressing the hidden compartment of his walking stick, right where he hid his wand, and Harry wasn’t a fool. He knew it wasn’t any kind of luck that had gotten them out of this.
"Um…" Harry said and then trailed off. Draco felt like running down the hall screaming while at the same time having no desire to move. Harry needed him. He
He winced; they’d written the lyrics when he’d been beyond upset with Potter. Listening to them now, they were childish. He probably could have done better with a clear head.
"Come now, Lupin, we both know you've been spending an inordinate amount of time with our dear headmaster. I just want to know what you've been talking about?"
"Oh, Professor Umbridge needs you," he said, his eyes flicking with such triumphant glee that Draco was half convinced he had just been caught in the middle of an orgie. "They've found Montague. He's turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor."
Draco was walking down the corridor, thinking instead of watching where he was going. Which was maybe his first mistake. His second was expecting people to avoid him because of who he was. Because seriously, who wouldn't be afraid of Draco fucking Malfoy.
"I think it's more if I want you there," Harry answered, rubbing the back of his neck as they walked along. "He does say, if I'm so inclined."
"Uh," Harry answered, looking down at his menu, because no, he wasn't. And no, he hadn't even looked at the thing. He'd been completely wrapped up in Malfoy.
"Harry," Weasley's face was red as he stared at Draco, his eyes flashing in a rather unattractive way. "What are you doing with him?" There was a long, tense moment where Weasley waited for an answer, and Harry just looked back at him. His lips were twisted in a sneer, his hands clenched down at his sides, but the light in his eyes was out.
have an answer to that except he didn't want to hurt Draco by getting his father thrown in jail. He didn't know if Draco would forgive him that, and he couldn’t find it in himself to chance it.
"You should have," Harry answered, lips twitched of their own accord. Then again, they did that a lot around Draco.
"Yeah, well…" he trailed off. That sat in silence for another few minutes, Cho staring at a couple off to their left who were kissing over their sugar bowl.
It was easy to follow them. Even if Draco didn’t have more than enough practice watching Potter, Weasley’s hair would have been enough. He raised an eyebrow when they ducked into the Hog’s Head but curiosity made him follow. Potter saw him first, but he just dropped him eyes to the trio's table and played with his butterbeer glass. Weasley saw him next. He jumped up from the table, turning to face Draco with his fists clenched.
Harry could feel Lucius’ glare along his shoulders as he slipped into the bedroom. But he knew if it really bothered him, Lucius would just toss him out.
And it broke Draco's heart that somewhere along the way that had become acceptable to Harry. It had become acceptable to hold everyone at arm's length for fear of what they would do, to distrust the world and tell himself he didn't deserve to be touched, that he couldn't touch in return. It wasn't that he didn't love that Harry trusted him, that he could draw these reactions from him, it was just that he hated how Harry had convinced himself it was fine to be afraid of affection, and it was only worse because he seemed to have no idea how much he deserved it all.
"And why did you lie?" Severus asked, opening one eye to look up at the thoughtful expression still on Harry's face.
Draco filed hand in the hair as a trigger as he put both his hands on Harry's chest, gliding them down until one rested on his stomach and the other was laying on edge of his robe. Harry pulled away from the kiss, gasping and wide-eyed. His eyes flicked down to Draco's hands and then back up, and then he was kissing Draco again like he was going to die if he didn't, and Draco was reaching under his robes wrapping his hand around Harry‘s cock and loving the gasped groan Harry moaned against his mouth.
"Harry." Draco bit his lip, his voice rough. He was completely stiff under Harry's fingers, refusing to move as Harry brought his other hand up and placed it firmly against Draco's cheek. Harry leaning closer, his fingers smoothing along Draco's cheekbones, determined to get a reaction. "Harry, stop," Draco said, grasping his wrists and stopping him in his tracks.
"I was reviewing the file last night, looking for anything I missed," Malfoy said, and Harry blinked at his rather awkward change of topic. Was he really not going to insult Harry back? "I've been thinking the landlady might know something more than she said in her initial interview."
"He knows about Draco. He tried to threaten me, said he would tell the Ministry. I refused, but I never imagined-."
They reached the front door a second before it exploded open, and something slammed into Draco, ripping him away from his mother and sending him slamming into the ground. His vision blurred, his ears were ringing, and something hot and wet was ripping into his throat. The mind-numbing pain began a second later. So intense Draco almost passed out from the burning stinging horrible feeling of being ripped apart by the throat.
Fortunately, they'd been able to locate the Horcrux fairly easy. It had been stacked at the top of Bellatrix's vault, displayed with pride and shining. Harry had stared and pointed at the golden goblet with Helga Hufflepuff's ensign on it before promptly passing out. After that, it had only been a matter of breaking out of Gringotts. Fairly simple when one had an ensorcelled goblin on one’s side.
Harry blinked, blushed, and dropped his eyes again. Draco's hand twitched, wanting so badly to reach out and brush the fringe out of Harry's face. Draco's eyes dropped to Harry's lips; he wanted—
Severus pinched the bridge of his nose. The water was up to their necks now; if it kept rising like this, he'd have to cast bubblehead charms. He froze in his tracks, turning back to Lucius suddenly.
And Harry had no idea what he was doing, his mind was still locked numb, but his body was moving forward, connecting his lips with Malfoy's, anything to just shut him up, because really, Malfoy didn't know when to just shut up.
"You'll be fine for three days, I'm sure," Professor Snape said, his eyebrows furrowing as if even he didn't believe it.
"Is this the wisest course of action?" Severus asked, his voice betraying nothing. When Draco looked over at him, he hadn't even looked up from the papers strewn across his desk.
"You need to go now!" Harry answered, his voice echoing across the stone floors. "He's torturing him. He's going to kill—"
"Hey!" he answered. Neville stepped forward and then froze when he noticed Draco's hand laced around Harry's. Neville turned a startling shade of red and promptly averted his eyes. Harry felt Draco stiffen and try to pull his hand back, but he kept a firm hold, refusing to let Draco withdraw.
"Trust you?" he asked, and he even he had to admit that his voice sounded pathetic. How could Harry think Draco didn't—It wasn't that. It had never been about that. If it had been up to him, he would be on his knees spilling his secrets and begging Harry to forgive him. Malfoy pride be damned. But there were more important things that what made Draco happy.
"Please, Draco's always like that." Hermione rolled her eyes. "He acts like he doesn't want to talk, but he actually does." She stopped abruptly, her hand falling on his arm and halting his forward motion. "You remember last year. When you were fighting about some horrible misunderstanding again." Harry shifted uncomfortably under her hand. What exactly was he supposed to say to that? It really was Draco she should be lecturing; it was him that wouldn’t listen after all.
"Harry, now isn't the-," Draco sighed, taking a step closer to Lupin, and it was all the chance Lupin needed. Harry saw it before Draco even realized what was happening, but his warning was cried out too late. He watched helplessly as Lupin seized Draco, yanking him back and pressing his wand against Draco's throat. Harry raised his wand, knowing it was already too late.
to be fake, well, everything about her had to be fake. Not including her enjoyment of other people's pain.
They were chasing down a group of wizards who had already raided a muggle cemetery, killed a wizard with dark arts, and stolen a cat. Why a cat, Harry had no idea. Dracona had said something about ancient rituals that had sent Hermione scampering away as if she was speaking some magical wisdom, but left Harry staring at her in confusion.
"That's not what I meant, Harry," Draco sighed, his face softening. He reached out, but Harry recoiled away and out of reach. The hand froze and then fell, too slowly for Harry to not feel the regret that pulsed through him.
"It's this room that can be anything you want it to be," Lovegood answered, her eyes drifting dreamily. "One time, I was in desperate need of a nap-."
Lucius laid back on the desk, staring up at the ceiling as he panted and feeling somewhere between shocked and amazed.
"I'd seen it before," Harry answered. "It was in one of the memories Dumbledore showed me before he died. One of the founding artifacts that Tom Riddle stole."
The door opened to his rooms, and he sent Harry a disapproving look that the boy promptly ignored. Lucius was already seated in his favorite chair by the fire, tea in his hand and legs crossed stiffly. Harry's eyes flicked over him once before he sat in the chair across from him and let out a loud breath.
“Do you want to tell me what these nightmares are about?” she asked, staring at him. Blatantly waiting for an answer.
"We…" Harry cleared his throat, already regretting bringing it up. "Voldemort and I shared a connection. I could- you know, I could sometimes see into his mind. See through his eyes."
Draco frowned, but said nothing. Now wasn't exactly the time to be questioning Harry's fundamental beliefs about himself. But they
Draco flicked his wand again, and Harry suddenly felt the lube start to leak out of Draco's hole. Draco winced as he was magically stretched, squirming against Harry's hands as he got used to the feeling. So, it was to be fast and hard then? Harry could do that.
When he was less than a foot away, he stretched his front foot out and barely caught his claws against Draco's back leg. Werewolf Draco stopped abruptly, grinding his back legs into the ground as he came to a halt and lunging around to snap large fangs where Harry's head had been a second before.
"I'd like to buy it," Draco answered, turning cold blank eyes on him. He held a bag of galleons in front of Bogin's face and then dropped it into his palm. "And that's all you need to know." Borgin clenched his jaw but just nodded, weighing the bag in his hand. Draco was glad his fear of his father at least extended to Draco this far.
want to talk about Cedric. He was beginning to wonder if she even cared about him or if she just cared about his connection to Cedric.
Draco stepped out of the Great Hall, ignoring the glares from the Slytherin table as he did. Almost three weeks of silence when he'd walked into a room, of glares and fearful looks. As he moved down the corridors, he continued to ignore the way people moved away from him. He supposed he'd better just get used to it.
be no different. Well, there was really only one solution. He would just have to stay away from Potter. He didn't care about Potter, and Potter didn't care about him. Because when Draco got into moods like this, he did stupid things like disrupting Gryffindor Quidditch practices and then—
"Why indeed?" Draco said, his teeth clenching almost painfully. Which wasn't helping the pain that pulsed through his head. But, bloody hell, why couldn't Potter ever do the sensible thing instead of running around
It seemed to go on forever, his back arching off the ground, his throat coming away raw, and he could feel the terror shoving its way through his mind in a way he hadn't felt since Draco had looked him in the eyes and told him he loved him. And when Voldemort ended the spell, he was standing right above Harry, his wand almost right in Harry's face.
"Potter," Zabini said, his eyes flicking behind Harry as if he'd try and dash around him or something. Then he sighed, and faced him, apparently coming to terms with his fate.
"Tonight," Harry answered. "I'll stay with you." He turned and started to leave, snarling over his shoulder as he went. "That's what you wanted, wasn't it?"
He remembered when Dumbledore had insisted the training begin, saying there were things even Severus couldn't tell him. He'd argued. He'd been angry, but back then he'd always been angry. It hadn't done any good; Dumbledore had simply stared at him until he cooperated. He remembered hours spent over pensives and sitting across from Dumbledore while he droned on and on and on.
“So, you’re saying stop bothering you,” Harry answered, and he could already feel the burning in the back of his eyes. The struggle to keep his expression impassive. It used to be so easy to keep anything from hurting him. To keep himself untouchable. And now a few words from the right person, and he was a quivering mess. He just wanted to run away, disappear, brush the embarrassment off as if it wasn’t there. Hurt Severus before Severus hurt him. “Got it.”
He was too tired to care. He turned his head and locked eyes with Professor Snape, and for the first time since he'd returned to school, he cried.
"Luna and I can stand on either side of the corridor and warn people not to go down there because someone's let off a load of Garroting Gas," Ginny said immediately, and Hermione blinked at her. "Fred and George were planning to do it before they left."
"Mr. Potter," Umbridge said, having finally arrived at the scene. She began to question him, though most of his words were lost to Draco. He held out the paper to her and Draco's eyes widened, sensing an incoming disaster. He flicked his wand under the table as the entire great hall fell silent in anticipation of the incoming argument. "Are you trying to make me seem like a fool, Mr. Potter?" Umbridge snapped. "This is blank. There is no interview here."
“One more night,” Harry said, and if Draco didn’t know any better, he would have thought he was talking to his lunch.
"You don't know anything about me or my father, Potter," Malfoy responded, his voice lilting in a façade of calm, and Harry
"Kill you?" Voldemort answered, chuckling lightly against Harry's throat. "Now, why would I want to go and do a thing like that when I know it’s what you really want?" He laughed again, pulling his mouth away. Harry watched the string of spit and blood that clung to his mouth, connecting back to the wound on Harry's throat. He pulled his hand out of Harry's hair, raising his wand and opening his mouth to cast his cruciatus.
"Harry asked Luna to go with him," Hermione told him the day before Slughorn's Christmas Party. Draco didn't know why she bothered to tell him, because, of course, he'd already heard.
"You really don't know where he is?" Draco asked. It was so absurd. Why would they keep Potter in the dark? Why would they refuse to tell him things when he was smack in the middle of a war, his enemies chasing him from inside Hogwarts. And alright, Draco wasn’t going to kill Harry, but he wasn’t safe, no matter how much Dumbledore wanted to pretend he was.
The last thing he was able to make out was the Squid's tentacles wrapping around them before the giant cloud of black ink surrounded Severus, Beth, and the Squid, and Lucius could feel the cold acid feel of ink even from where he was hovering.
"Yes, lover?" Malfoy's soft voice made Harry shiver from the bottom of his feet to the tips of his bound arms.
"Well, I do," Ron said, looking mildly proud. "It's the case I've been assigned to. Gregson Manor belongs to James Gregson. Let me tell you, he's a stuck up pureblood if ever there was one-."
Harry was curled up in a ball, sleeping when the Hogwarts Express arrived. He'd been perched at the very tip top of his favorite tree; his claws were hooked into the wood to keep him from falling when the damn conductor had blown his whistle right by the forest, sending Harry's bones in a scramble.
"I don't know," Draco snapped. "Maybe I'll ask Lupin for help since he apparently doesn't lie to me," and Harry couldn't help it. He flinched at the words, snapping away from Draco and feeling the words press down on him. Draco wasn't wrong to think it. Harry was sure Lupin wouldn't lie about werewolf things to Draco, where Harry lied about everything.
"How does guarding a corridor get Harry to the Dark Lord?" Luna asked, and she sounded genuinely curious, which really only made the taunt that much better.
"So, Mr. Potter," Draco asked, leaning forward. "I don't suppose you'd like to help me with my homework?" Of course, Harry could never go along with something like that. His nose crinkled up as if he'd smelled something particularly disgusting as he answered.
"When you came to my house," Severus breathed. "To tell me you were to be married…. and I turned you away."
"He said they just needed a little money," Harry argued. "That seems like a big risk for a little money." They'd been talking in circles, getting nowhere, and he knew Draco didn't have time for them to be making up their minds like this.
"You don't know," Draco scoffed. "Come on, Harry, usually you're a little bit convincing when you come up with an excuse for something."
to make it messy like he liked all the attention on himself." Harry sighed, picking at his school robes distractedly. "People always say I look just like my father but suddenly that doesn't seem like such a good thing anymore."
"I like Neville." Blaise frowned at him before moving his gaze back over to Longbottom's form. "He's actually quite smart when he's not flustered."
“Your teeth,” Draco answered, and he was all Slytherin business now, his grey eyes glimmering mischievously as he looked Romilda up and down. He sat nimrod straight, his fingers curling tightly around Harry's as he pressed a knee against Harry's thigh. “You should definitely check that out before you go do something embarrassing like ask someone else’s boyfriend out.” She glared at him, her lips moving awkwardly like she was feeling around with her tongue, and Draco shifted closer to Harry, reaching out until his free hand was curled possessively around his knee. Harry's eyes widened, but Draco kept his gaze locked on the girl.
"Lucius…" he answered, though it was not an answer, and the other man seemed to sense that it was all Severus was capable of at the moment.
Draco supposed the She-Weasley nodded. He didn't know, didn't look, but in the next couple of seconds, both she and Hermione were shuffling out of the infirmary, leaving Draco, Weasley, and Harry alone. Harry didn't particularly look terrible. Instead, he just looked as if he was sleeping, breathing lightly in and out, his forehead creased as if he were thinking hard. Draco could see his glasses on the bedside table, his hands resting beside his torso on the covers. Whatever had happened to him had hopefully already been healed.
Draco wrenched back, staring at Harry with wide silver-gray eyes. Harry felt the unexpected urge to giggle; he'd never thought he'd ever get to see Draco shocked senseless while his pupils were blown wide with lust and he was looking down at Harry as if there was nothing better he could possibly be looking at.
When Abraxas found out he'd fallen in love with a half-blood man, the gauntlet had been thrown. He'd tried to fight his father. He'd even visited Severus; he'd told Narcissa he didn't love her. Abraxas didn't care; he'd never cared. Tradition was what mattered. And after Severus had turned him away, he'd supposed Abraxas had been right. Pureblood traditions were better than feelings.
“Sometimes, you can just tell,” Blaise answered, and Neville frowned as he turned back to his homework.
"I noticed you didn't tell Skeeter you saw Lucius Malfoy the night Voldemort rose," she said, and Harry shrugged. He didn't
“Fine,” Scrimgeour stood abruptly, his face a hard line. “You leave me no choice but to take certain precautions.”
"What?!" the Dark Lord hissed, his red snake eyes focusing on Severus with such malice that he was sure he'd just made a mistake.
"Just let it, Ron," Harry interrupted. He shifted uncomfortably, both Granger and Weasley staring at him as if he’d lost his mind.
"He might know what's going on with Nott," Severus answered, though even he didn't really know what he was looking for. He just knew there was something going on, something he was missing. He didn't know why he wanted to confront Lupin—it had just been the look in Lupin's eyes when he'd found out what they were doing.
"I…" and still he hesitated. And it burned Draco up. There weren't words for how it burned Draco up. Sure, Harry had told him a lot—probably more than he'd ever told anyone—Draco
He sighed, stepping back from the shelf as he drew another book down. He hated this, this horrible sense of duty. It had always been his job to stop Voldemort, since before he had even know the name. But he had somehow thought that dying would alleviate that duty, fulfill it in a way he'd never wanted to. Which was of course why it didn't work.
Harry immediately began to bustle around, checking a piece of parchment that looked suspiciously like a map and then sending people out in threes and fours. Eventually, it was only Draco, Granger, Weasley, and Harry left alone in the room.
Even McGonagall had come to him, pressing a hand down on his shoulder and telling him he could always come to her if someone gave him trouble and his father was busy. He felt like asking he if that only applied to Werewolf problems or if the Gryffindors teased him for doing his homework he could complain to her too.
Harry was shaking. Not the good kind of shaking that would have made Draco ready to jump him but the kind of shaking that signaled a nervous breakdown.
“Theodore Nott threatened me,” Severus said, his amusement dropping as he spoke. “I required Lupin’s assistance.”
"No," Potter said, which didn't exactly explain anything, but his tone made it clear that further questions would not be welcome. So, maybe not the safe answer then.
"Long enough," Nott snapped, raising his chin in the pure-blooded defiant way Severus was so used to seeing from Draco.
Neville was sitting next to him, his knee resting lightly against Blaise’s, and his whole body was radiated warm. As if someone had left him out in the sun too long—maybe thinking he was one of the plants he loved so much. Unlike Blaise, he was actually focused on his work, biting his lip as he scratched something out before continuing to write. Ginny was across from Neville, her homework strewn across the table as if pretending she was going to do it when they all knew she wouldn’t. Luna was next to her, the fingers of her right hand tight around her quill as she stared down at her parchment for a long minute.
"He killed the part of his soul that was inside me," he answered, half-way to hoping that would be the end of the conversation. Because really, what more did Draco want to know.
"Oh," Draco answered. And in that moment, he couldn't help but be grateful that even though Weasley didn't know, he understood. He figured he would never like him, but maybe he could at least stop hating him. Maybe. He owed him that after almost killing him. "Thank you."
"Don't tell Severus," he'd rasped, his voice something close to desperation. "Please. He'll be so upset. Please…" Lucius hadn’t said anything, and Potter had been passed out against the tiles before he could plead anything else.
tell you without Lord Voldemort-," another flinch. He had to hold back his smile. "-becoming suspicious of him. I, however, no longer have such a problem."
Eventually, Granger and Weasley came off. Always the last ones. Though he wished they would hurry. He always got bored just standing here, having everyone stare at him without being able to throw something at them. Granger came up to him, hesitating on the balls of her feet as she always did. He stepped away, just to remove any temptation she might have had about hugging him.
"If I had been open with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that you should never go to the Department of Mysteries. You would have known a long time ago what exactly was waiting for you there," he said, and Harry blinked, his mouth bobbing as he tried to comprehend what Dumbledore was saying. "Now, please, sit down, Harry." He blinked, hesitating before he took a step back and did what he was told.
"Get away from me, the lot of you." He snarled, and the Slytherins did, scrambling across the corridor and out of sight. Potter put his back against the wall, leaning his head back to stare at the ceiling. The pose was so similar to how Draco had just been standing, except when Potter raised his hand to brush the hair out of face, his hands were trembling violently.
Draco woke to someone running a cold compress against his throat and down onto his chest. It felt like heaven, soothing the aching in his scars in a way that let him know the person was using something other than water. He kept his eyes closed for a moment, enjoying the feeling before the soft voice above him wrenched him out of his relaxed state.
Harry looked over at Cho. She was standing in the middle of the room, making little sniffling sounds, and he realized suddenly she was crying.
His eyes caught on startling green and he froze, for some reason unable to look away. Something tugged in the back of his mind, some reminder of something that wasn't the here—that wasn't the need for blood and death and hunger. He snuffled and took one lumbering step closer to the small feline in front of him.
He released Harry, stepping away and beckoning for Harry to follow him. He hesitated but eventually stepped up behind Draco, tracing his steps. They didn't encounter anyone as Draco led them down the stairs and into the dungeons. Harry didn't say anything as they moved along, and Draco wasn't exactly inclined to disturbed him; he figured they would have enough to talk about when they got to his room. When he stopped in front his door, the old man in the portrait barely looked up as Draco approached.
"Well, Harry, Draco," Dumbledore hummed, eyes sparkling. "We've trespassed on Horace's hospitality quite long enough, I think; perhaps it's time for us to leave."
He felt his hands raising before he really knew what he was doing, mimicking the motions Draco had done with them the last time they'd kissed. He reached up, arms wrapping around Draco's neck, and realizing only a moment later that Draco's arms were around him in return.
Kenny Coleman, one of the few Slytherin's who wasn't a pureblood, was clinging to Lucius, his black hair a mess of curls in the water. He was almost hyperventilating into his bubblehead charm, staring into the water around him as if he expected them to be attack. Lucius certainly hoped that wouldn't be the case.
"Now,” she said, standing and looking down at him expectantly. “Are you coming?” She asked it like a question, but there was something in the way she gestured Draco to follow her that made it seem more like a command. He sighed and packed his bags as slowly as he could. He took pleasure in the way Granger cast him impatient looks and tried to stop herself from tapping her foot. Only because he needed to keep up his spying appearances for Umbridge.
“If you want to give me the ring back, I won’t blame you,” Lucius said finally. His voice was low, careful, no emotion, and Severus didn’t know he had enough of a heart left to feel as it as it plummeted to his feet.
He should just trust his father, shouldn’t he? He should just trust himself. But then even his own conscience was telling him that he couldn't handle his werewolf side on his own anymore. Besides, the fact that Severus had agreed with him. And if Severus had suggested reaching out to Lupin then Draco could only assume that it was serious.
"I'm finished, Professor, really." Draco insisted, trying to hand his paper in. The Professor just looked at him wearily; Draco supposed he didn’t blame him. After dealing with Harry Potter handing in his paper early and unfinished, he wouldn’t want to deal with another unfinished exam either.
Yet, still it didn't stop. As he drifted further and further away from Lily, he grew closer and closer to Lucius, becoming entrapped into the boy's world, unable to find his way out again. And he wasn't sure he'd really wanted to anymore.
"I didn't try to kiss you because I was using you or some other nonsense. Should I have done it when it was clear you didn't want me to, no. But I am attracted to you, Harry. There's nothing wrong with that, and I refuse to apologize for it. So, stop being a bloody baby about it and tell me what the real problem is because it isn't that you don't care." Draco looked at him for a minute, taking in the emerald eyes, tousled hair, bags under the eyes, and too skinning frame. "Because if I've learned anything about you, it's that you do care—no matter how hard you try not to."
"Which is faster than I'd anticipated," Severus said, his hands folded carefully across his lap as he spoke, and Draco could tell by the look on his face that
"What?" Harry asked. "Umbridge put you on probation?" Hagrid shrugged, mumbling something about rubbing chili powder on salamanders and stumbled off. Harry blinked, turning his head in a slow circle and wondering what he'd missed. "Where's Hermione?"
"He's right," Harry said. "Isn't Hogwarts supposed to be the safest place around, what with Dumbledore being the only person Voldemort ever feared." Slughorn jumped a little, staring at Harry.
didn't like. "The bigger the use of the spell or artifact, the more signature they leave," Malfoy frowned, his lips turning down as he swung his long legs down off Harry's desk and deposited them back into his shoes. Harry abruptly snapped his eyes back up to Malfoy's face. "But the signature's too faint for me to really pick up, no matter what I do."
"Well," he turned away from Lupin, fulling intending to continue down the hall. "Have fun with that."
Ron was good. Not great but good. He blocked most of the goals Harry threw at him and seemed to do a pretty good job handling the Quaffle. After practicing for a while, they headed to lunch, ignoring Hermione's pointed looks of disapproval.
"Why do I have to want anything?" he answered, and Potter looked over at him. His face was deathly pale, his eyes red as if he were on the verge of tears, and Draco suddenly really didn't understand Potter at all. Why did he run around acting as if he didn't care about anything or anyone if he was really this fragile? Why did he act untouchable if it was this easy to break him?
"What?" Harry interrupted. Draco tensed even further, his shoulders pressing up into the couch. "What do you mean you're done?"
"I… why not?" Harry asked, and now Malfoy was staring at him as if he were something particularly distasteful, his grey eyes sharp and cutting and cold, and Harry was sure that whatever the answer was, he wasn't about to get it right now.
that to her. He was just surprised Scrimgeour had sent her instead of coming himself, though maybe he was still too busy finding ways to kick Severus out after Draco's secret had been revealed.
They landed hard on the dirt, Harry shaking his head to clear the sickening pull of Apparition. They were just outside the gates of Gregson Manor, and the smoke rising from the building made it clear that something was wrong. Harry started toward the gate, drawing his wand with Ron right behind him.
"Right, of course," he pulled his legs back, standing slowly to help Severus to his feet. When they were both standing, he took Severus in again, flicking his eyes up and down as the fire began to ignite in his belly and burn its way through him. It was stronger than it had ever been before. An irresistible wildfire that took control of him and made it impossible to think.
“They don’t have to like him to hate you,” Lucius answered, wrapping his hand around his cane as he stood. He turned his back on Severus, his silver hair shimmering down his back. “I should send a few more letters, see if I can’t get-.”
he thought he was doing. He didn't have any idea. Maybe he really was crazy like the prophet claimed. Judging by the fact that he was painfully hard now, he wasn't rejecting the idea.
Potter turned his head just enough to catch his eye. That tired yet determined look in those green eyes. It was the look of someone who didn't want to be here, someone who had a responsibility they hated. A responsibility that was too heavy for them. It was the look Blaise had seen in the mirror every time his mother had married another rich wizard and ordered him to be polite and charming, no matter how much Blaise himself despised the man.
Draco squeezed Harry's hand again, his eyes flicking toward Severus before returning to him, and Harry knew what he was going to say before he said it.
"Both of you stop," Hermione suddenly interrupted. Draco started, looking over at her in surprised before he could help himself. She looked… wrecked. About as bad as Draco felt, her eyes more hurt then angry, and he immediately remembered that both of her best friends had ended up in the infirmary within 24 hours.
"Do you have any idea how I felt when you came in? Covered in blood, carrying Harry in your arms?" Severus snapped out, his eyes shining darkly, looking impossibly venerable. "I know you may not care about Harry but-."
Malfoy reached for his robes, carefully undoing them. Harry watched with wide eyes as Malfoy carelessly flicked the button of his trousers and then with one twist of his wrist had them and his pants down past his hips. He smirked down at Harry,
"What?" he answered, jerking away before Harry could touch him. His hand dropped, hurt flashing across his face. "How would I know?"
"Harry believes the Dark Lord has Sirius Black in the Department of Mysteries," Draco told him, his voice low and sinister sounding in the dark room.
"That's not good enough." He narrowed his eyes, his hand clenching almost painfully around Harry's. "I'm staying."
wasn't acting like a couple of bullies on a playground." He made a frustrated sound in the back of his throat, running a hand through his hair as if to smooth it flat. It struck Draco that his father must have been doing the opposite of that in Severus' memories. "I just… I feel like I suddenly understand why Snape holds such a grudge, is all."
"And all these people know where to find you, to send you stuff?" Harry asked. He sounded sincere enough, confused and innocent, but the comment burst Slughorn's bubble enough that Draco had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing.
Lucius was running like he hadn't since he was in school, his braid flying behind with Severus right in front him. They'd left Sprout by the lake with the students, heading up to the castle alone. There was smoke rising from the first few floors of the castle, a thin brown smoke seeping from the windows everywhere above that, and they could see Death Eaters milling around the grounds.
Harry could hear their footsteps echoing down the corridor even as he turned back toward Voldemort just in time to catch the end of the
But he had woken up once sure that Voldemort was still alive. Another time with the feeling of Vernon inside of him, his chubby hands clutching along his hair. The worst part was that he couldn't go to Severus, couldn't go to Draco. It was a new experience to stay awake, staring at the ceiling with no one's breathing in the room around him to reassure that the nightmare had just been a nightmare. But he didn't know if they would reject him. Didn't know if he could take it. It was one of those things that it was better not to find out.
"We don't have the prophecy." Harry said. Draco looked at him out of the corner if his eye, feeling awe for the boy beside him. While he could only think of cowering before the man, the man that wasn't even human before them—Harry was standing there like he wasn't even afraid, his chin held high and his voice steady. It was really no wonder he had enthralled Draco.
"He did. He died saving Harry after Snape was kidnapped," Lupin answered. Draco blinked at the bitterness in Lupin's tone, at the way Lupin's lips twisted as he frowned and turned away. "Sirius was in Azkaban for so long. For a crime he didn't commit, and I'd just gotten him back, and then he died." Lupin sighed, letting out a breath, his shoulders relaxing as he lowered his head.
So, then why did he want to? Why was it so hard to follow the logic when Harry was looking at him and those damn crystals were still buzzing in his ears and he didn't know, he didn't know what he should do but he sure as fuck knew what he wanted...
"Oh, look," Harry interrupted. "The carriage has stopped." He flung open the door, leaving Granger and Weasley in the carriage to sort out their feeling. He figured he now had a good excuse for ignoring them if nothing else.
"Are you capable of laughing, Potter?" Lucius answered, moving across the room to sit crossed legged on the sofa, and Harry followed him over, sitting across from the pureblood.
Lucius smiled, a thin humorless smile and then he was gone, leaving Harry feeling tired and emotionally worn thin. He sighed, stepping back and leaning against the wall. He was tired, so tired. But in a different way than he was used to. He felt awake after years of sleep walking. And he hated it, he absolutely hated it. He hated the overwhelming hope that soared through him; he could deal with anger and pain and fear. He'd done it for years.
Lucius was beyond frustrated. He couldn't understand what was wrong with Severus, and he could not understand what he could do to fix it. Every time he asked, Harry gave him a look that Lucius could only describe as a mix between disapproval and pity. And didn't that just burn Lucius up, a Potter was pitying him. Lucius Malfoy.
Harry shook his head, staring at Draco as if he’d lost his mind, dark hair falling over his glasses. He was still holding the Honeydukes bag as the portrait swung shut behind him. And Draco couldn’t help but laugh again at the memory of the way Lucius had stared when Harry had told him they were late because they’d been buying candy.
“To decide if you’re worth dying for!” he interrupted, and Draco blinked at him as if the idea hadn’t even occurred to him. “Haven’t you thought that just maybe I should get to decide what I want with my life, not you?” he turned his face away, already feeling his face burning at the words, at what he was thinking. “I- you keep talking about how I’m your…. I’m your mate. How there’s no one else for you, but I don’t think you’ve considered the idea that I- that it goes the other way- I mean, that I- that there’s no one else for me either.”
"Why are you acting like an arsehole?" Potter asked, and Draco drew up short. Potter sounded genuinely curious, bordering on annoyed. He didn’t sound anything like the hotheaded Gryffindor that always lunged when Draco taunted.
," the voice was soft, silky smooth, and Bellatrix obviously didn't see it coming. Her face went slack, her jaw relaxing, and then she was falling, collapsing to the ground, dead.
“Yes, Harry. Draco Malfoy talked to me,” Hermione answered in an exaggerated fashion, rolling her eyes again. Then her gaze turned thoughtful. “You know, he’s really not so bad once you look past his prickliness. Like when you know he’s not actually trying to hurt you, he’s actually rather… I don’t know, not charming exactly but…” she hesitated, thinking as Harry just stare at her somewhere between shock, jealous, and wonder. Hermione’s gaze snapped back to him and she blushed. “Well, I suppose that’s not important. Draco said, he was upset with you because you didn't seem to care that he was shagging both you and Pansy."
"Really?" Sirius' eyebrow rose, "starting secret defense groups with known Death Eater's sons not exciting enough for you?" Harry repressed his sigh.
Also, thanks so much for reading and hanging on for the ride! You are all so amazing and wonderful and deserve all the good things!
"I'm laughing with you," Draco said, and Harry rolled his eyes. Then he sighed, stepped away again to face the way they'd been going.
He loped out of the forest, shifting at the edge and shivering at his lack of a jacket and overshirt. He purposely avoided the small clearing he'd left Malfoy in, having to trek an extra distance to do it but feeling glad all the same. He hoped the fucking pureblood wonder had tried to find his way out and gotten lost. He hoped he never saw him again. A familiar pang echoed down his chest, and he closed his eyes against the sensation. He couldn't do this again. He couldn't. Severus had been right all along; he had gotten attached.
"I don't know, Harry. I think neither of us really want to believe he's working with Voldemort, but I also don't really know
He took his handful of Draco's arse and flipped them. Draco gasped, staring up at Harry with wide grey eyes, his long blonde hair a tangled halo on the pillow under him. And Harry was sinking into his heat easily, letting Draco groan and wrap his legs around his waist.
“Hogwarts is running as well as it always is,” Severus answered, not bothering to take his eyes off the ring. “There’s really not much more to discuss.”
"But I'm in love with you," Harry said because he hadn't cared that Draco was close to breaking. He hadn't cared. He just wanted him to stay even if it meant they'd both be broken in the end.
"Careful," the witch smirked, raising one finger, and Dracona turned to look where she was pointing. "Harry, dear, do stop breathing." And Harry immediately let out a startled gasp. His hands flying up to wrapped around his own throat, an alarmed look on his face as his mouth bobbed open, and the witch laughed loudly.
"Well, evidently, or you would never have tried to question Slughorn like that," Draco answered, and he’d looked genuinely amused, laughing at Harry for the first time in too long, and it had been almost too much, the reminder that Draco hadn’t always been so… moody.
"No, no," she said, watching him over the rim of her tea. "Run along, Draco." He bowed slightly to her and then turned to leave. He should have known she wouldn't have let him go so easily. "Do you miss being friends with him?" Umbridge called. Draco stopped, his hand about an inch from the door handle.
"Harry, we can't…" he tried, but Harry tilted his head, his lips soft in Draco’s, biting his bottom lip and sucking it into his mouth, and Merlin when had he learned to kiss like that?
"Well," Malfoy blinked at him, long and slow, and Harry was suddenly reminded of a cat right before it caught its prey. A very attractive cat. "If the war taught me anything, it was moderation."
As they ran, even Harry began to hear what had drawn Draco's attention. The shuffling of feet and whisper of breath, and he could smell that pure hormonal scent that his Animagus form always attributed to humans. He cursed whoever was foolish enough to be out in the Forbidden Forest on a full moon, pushing himself forward, shoving his hindlegs into the ground, and screeching as he struggled to catch up with Draco.
"I just wish you would tell me what's going on with you, is all," Draco said, his eyes bright and sincere. Harry looked away; he couldn't bear that look. The looked that reminded him of just how much life and happiness Draco was giving away to care for him. And Harry couldn't even pull away from him. Every time he tried, he just came crawling back to Draco and demanding more and more.
They'd stopped just outside the restaurant; Harry had intended of just saying goodnight. He had been planning on running off, going back to his house and thinking long and hard about everything that had happened, because surely he had lost his mind somewhere earlier in the day.
"Please," Pansy suddenly stepped forward, her voice low and pleading. "Please, we didn't mean it." Potter crossed his arms, looking down at her with no pity in his eyes. Draco shivered, Potter looked… he looked as if Pansy could drop dead right in front of him and he couldn't care less.
"Why did he show us that?" Draco asked. "To make us understand why the Dark Lord hates muggles so much? To make us feel bad for him?"
Thank you all for the kudos! Don't forget to leave a comment about anything you liked or even didn't like!
Snape spent a long time staring at him, his top lip curling. Then he sighed, closing his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose as if he couldn't stand to look at Harry any longer.
“Good,” Harry said, his voice dark, and Draco’s gaze swung around, locking onto him, and the understanding in his eyes was unnerving.
But Severus didn't this time. He couldn't. He'd seen Harry take three steps forward; he couldn't watch him go leaping back. He couldn't watch him destroy himself. Not again. Not after killing Dumbledore. Not after the mess with Lucius.
. That Harry had been trying all week. All the aborted attempts had been Harry trying to reach out to him, and Draco had been too bull headed to notice. As frustrating as that idea was, he suddenly wanted to laugh, though he had an idea that Harry might actually slap him if he did.
"There’s nothing better to do,” he shrugged, and Harry shook his head, not looking in the least like he believed him.
“I told you,” Draco said, his eyes gleaming with that annoyed air Harry knew too well. If Draco was going to be angry at him, he could at least yell instead of patronizing him. “I’m scared of being a werewolf.”
you to say anything, Draco,” Harry answered. “I just… I just want-,” he blinked hard, lowering his eyes, and it was only then that Draco realized how close to crying he was—had been for who knew how long.
“I didn’t know,” Severus answered, turning his face away. “I thought you had to want something. There had to be a reason.”
"No," he answered, and Harry recoiled at the bite in his tone. Draco sighed, forcing himself to calm down. Knowing the idiot, he probably didn't have any idea what he’d done. Draco was almost sure Harry didn't have a deceitful bone in his body, but that didn't mean being subjected to an afternoon of his staring at someone else wasn't... painful.
“So, you don’t believe Headmaster Snape helped you only out of some nefarious purpose?” Woods asked. “He wasn’t manipulating you or using you in your opinion.”
"Harry, you're not, you know, The Heir of Slytherin, are you?" Ron asked quietly. He paused, casting an enigmatic look back at Ron before continuing his slow track forward. He wanted to say yes, he wanted to turn around and leave Ron to his fate. He wanted to do so many things that he knew he wouldn't. He couldn't. Though he knew Ron would do to him if the positions were reversed.
The next morning when Lucius knocked on Draco's door, it took almost a full three minutes before it opened. Draco stared at him from the other side, looking somewhere between embarrassed and pleased and annoyed. Harry was still seated on the bed, his hair a mess with his glasses perched on the end of his nose, though he was at least dressed.
"Just what my father’s told me," Draco answered. his voice horribly soft. He played with the little creature in his hand, finding Potter's eyes suddenly very hard to meet. He didn’t know what he was doing. He should have walked away. He shouldn’t have said anything. His father would murder him if he found out Draco was spilling secrets.
"You don't want me here?" she answered, covering her face. "Horrid Myrtle annoying you again, is she?!"
"St. Mungo's?" Harry's voice asked. He was standing in the doorway, his hair a mess and his eyes still slightly red and puffy from crying. Draco turned his head away lest he abruptly give into the temptation and begin snogging him breathlessly.
"That was bizarre," Ron said, watching his best friend mount the stairs. Hermione threw a quill at him.
"No." Harry shook his head, feeling as if the world was spinning out from under him. "If that's true, why aren't the Malfoy's here? Why isn't the Ministry here?"
"I'm not leaving until you tell me what's going on," he said, but Potter just sneered at him. It was actually a pretty good sneer, all things considered.
hate him. "There you are." Malfoy came to a graceful stop next to Umbridge, flashing Harry his teeth in a rather intimidating leer.
"Yes," Lupin answered, and there was a cold brush of darkness in his voice now. Something Draco had never heard before. Something he was sure Lupin had kept bottled up. "The company of Harry Potter. How very fortunate Draco must have been."
"Nothing. I need your help," he said, and Zabini stared at him for a long minute before answering, his eyes narrowed with suspicion.
"Oh, so you've grown a tongue, Harry Potter?" Voldemort asked. His red eyes narrowed, taking in Harry's amusement with dark anger. His reaction was almost worth what Harry knew was going to come next. "I was almost sure you were just going to sit there and stare at me like you did last time," he sneered, pacing closer to Harry.
"And how are your parents doing, Mr. Longbottom? I must say it was a horrible tragedy what happened to them," Slughorn said.
He started. He was thinking about everyone else letting Harry push them away, and yet, here he was, doing the same thing.
"We need to find Draco and Harry before Lupin does," Lucius said, and his voice was as high and panicked as Severus had ever heard it.
He'd pushed open the door to the astronomy tower, stopping suddenly at the sound of giggling from within. There was a gasp and shuffling, and he'd decided he might as well just open the door the rest of the way. The door made a loud scrapping sound as he came into the room and the sound suddenly stopped.
He moved forward, his hands placed carefully along Draco's shoulders as he moved forward, lining his lips up easily. Draco kissed him, his lips moving in tandem with Harry's. And it felt good. He could stay here forever, stay in that moment forever.
"Ah," Dumbledore answered, smiling down at Harry but never breaking his stride. "The answer to that is two-fold. First, we need pick someone up."
"Harry Potter can't die," the voice said. Was that his name? Harry Potter. It sounded right, bouncing around in his skull with a meaning. "That's just not how it's supposed to happen. You're supposed to do stupid things and- and be hurt," the voice broke, sending a different kind of pain lacing through his chest. He didn't
I wont be updating next week because I'll be out back packing. The next update will be September 1st.
But she had been poking and prodding him for almost an hour now, and he could feel the annoyance at the edge of his consciousness. The anger that was always there and always so hard to reach. And he just wanted to burn her, send her tumbling away from him before she could really start to dig into him, before she could ask him something that he would have to answer.
"You don't get to just decide how everyone else feels because it's easier for you," Draco said, crossing the distance between them. Harry blinked as Draco advanced and then seemed to realize what Draco was doing. He scrambled back, almost tripping over his own feet.
Harry felt like cold water had been dumped on him. It was like Dumbledore know. Fingers intwined with his, squeezing his hand in a way that shot warmth through his arm. Draco’s gaze were still focused on Dumbledore, his silver-grey eyes almost challenging, and Harry realized they did know. Both of them.
"You have no idea what's in there, and you’ll just run in without a second thought because Dumbledore tells you to."
Harry was the first to arrive, shoving the door open with an unreadable expression on his face, and Severus was half surprised Draco wasn't with him.
"Why are we here?" Zabini asked again as they stopped, hovering at the edge of Azkaban. "I thought we were going to Gringotts?"
"Explain what?" Ron asked. He looked over at them, his eyes just a touch too wide. Harry wondered if he was going to go into shock.
He supposed he could seek out Draco out. He could bother the pure-blood until he was no longer bored, but he hesitated. After Harry had kissed him on the Astronomy tower, Draco had seemed reluctant to touch him again. The few times they'd been to together, Draco had seemed distracted, nervous, unwilling to come too close, and Harry was wondering if Draco was truly as busy as he seemed or if Harry had done something wrong. Perhaps he had read the situation incorrect, and Draco hadn't wanted him like
"How have you been?" Granger asked once they were all seated. Though she was sitting across from him, she felt the need to lean forward and invade his person space. Why? He couldn't begin to understand, but it wasn't like he could push her away. People tended to be offended when he did that. "How was your summer?"
"That's the first thing you're going to ask?" Potter answered, raising an eyebrow as he moved to sit beside Draco, his eyes firmly focused on Draco’s face.
Draco opened his mouth, to say what, he didn't know. Then Harry caught his eyes, shaking his head slightly in the firelight. He set his jaw and turned his face away, anger and disappointment flashing through him. He wasn't supposed to care. It was supposed to be easy. He was supposed to move on and stop hurting so damn much.
"Really?" Draco asked, cocking an eyebrow. He looked about an inch from drawing his own wand, his face twisted up in a sneer of resentful rage. "There are signs that say, 'Draco Malfoy is a traitor?'” Ron's face turned as red as his hair, and Harry had to tighten his grip on Ron’s robes as he lunged forward again. He shoved Ron back, and Malfoy curled his lip. Harry couldn’t tell if it was supposed to be directed at Ron or him.
"Why don't you ask him?" Dumbledore insisted. "Wouldn't want to assume wrong, now would you?" The house elf's eyes narrowed again, and she slammed the door, leaving Harry unsure if that was a yes or a no.
"I'm still studying my form." He answered, clenching his jaw against the insults he could hurl her way. It was never in his best interest to ask someone else for help. "There's really nothing else to say." The only person who had been tested and not been found wanting was Severus and Harry didn't even trust him with all his secrets.
"Draco," he whispered, clutching at the sheets when Draco reached the waistline of his pants, and there was a sigh against his stomach.
He hated this. He hated that Severus had suggested it. He hated that he’d agreed. He hated that he needed it.
Draco returned Theodore's sneer easily, watching as he and Pansy glared back at him. It was just his luck that on a day like this, they would be the only students inside.
Their first course had just appeared on the table when the door opened again. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering if this bloody dinner was ever going to even start. Then the youngest Weasley, Ginny, stepped in, her eyes puffy and red. Harry stood abruptly, staring over at her with wide eyes, and Draco felt something flash low in his stomach at Harry's expression.
care about Draco's life or whether he was still angry with his father or not. He'd never cared about things like that before, but looking at those brooding silver-grey eyes, something deep in his chest stirred.
"I think that's all for today," Severus said, clearing his throat. Draco didn't miss the way he shivered when Potter spoke.
The shelf wobbled once and then began to collapse. Harry shook his head, blinking twice and then widening his eyes with a look of horror plastered across his face. Suddenly he reached forward, yanking Draco away from Lucius and toward him with a single pull. Draco collided with his chest, letting out a cry of pain that echoed in the space around them.
"It's not a riddle, Potter," Draco answered, his voice frosting even further. "I mean exactly what I say. I'm done with the Dark Lord, the Order, and the war. I've decided it's no longer my problem."
"I thought that food was for me?" Malfoy said, his tone high and imperious, and Harry just shrugged, grabbing another. "Normal people actually answer questions, you know," Malfoy griped, shifting in his bed. Harry shrugged again; he
Dumbledore side-along Apparated them away from Malfoy Manor, leaving Draco's head spinning in a way he would be happy to never repeat.
"Theodore Nott?" Lucius answered, turning to face Severus. "The Slytherin? What does he have to do with anything?"
Then, Draco saw him. He was walking—no, almost running toward the forest. Granger was right beside him. Draco immediately took off in that direction, cursing Umbridge for all he was worth. What the bloody fuck was she going to do to them that involved taking them to the forest. Had he been too obvious? Did she suspect him now?
Severus reached for him, and Lucius clutched at his robes, pulling the draping and laying Severus bare before him.
have been concerning. He wasn’t usually vocal during sex. Hell, he usually didn’t even let people touch him during sex, but somehow it was all happening, and he could—no, he didn’t want to—stop it.
Draco understood why Harry was suddenly so desperate. They'd had their latest meeting with Dumbledore last night. He'd had told them about how the Dark Lord had found Helga Hufflepuff's cup and Salazar Slytherin's Locket. He'd told them about how the Dark Lord had killed the woman who had once owned the two items.
had the healthiest of relationships, which probably wasn’t what Hermione wanted to hear. He'd known Hermione asked the weasel to Slughorn's party. She'd been over the moon when it happened, but somehow that only made it that much worse when he turned around and decided she wasn't good enough for him. Draco was also pretty sure Hermione didn't want him to tell her
“I never win, and you’re doing really well,” Neville said, and Blaise’s fingers swiped across his lips as he lowered his hand. Neville wondered if the way his face suddenly felt hot meant he was blushing. He ducked his dead, studying the board in front of him. “King to E3”
" Harry sighed loudly and shuffled his way to the door, opening it to reveal not only Draco standing in the doorway but Hermione standing behind him, her arms crossed as she cast him a disapproving look at his pajamas.
He'd felt that way with Lily. Had done so many things he regretted because of that feeling. And it wasn't that he wanted to make the same mistakes with Lucius, he just didn't know how to stop it.
"Harry," he whispered, reaching out. "I'm not going to hurt you…" Harry flinched away from his hand, staring at Draco for one second more before whirling around and sprinting down the corridor as if hell hounds were on his heels. This time, Draco made no move to follow him. He had no idea what he would even say if he did. No idea what had caused Harry to run away this time.
"Why wouldn't I want to be here?" Harry interrupted, the blush on his face suddenly replaced by an angry drawl of his eyebrows.
“I need answers,” Draco said, raising his head to look up at Lucius. “And I think he might have them.” This time his gaze was determined. He looked like Narcissa when he stared like that, hard steel and resolve. Draco had always been softer than Lucius. Both he and Narcissa had known that from the beginning, but it hadn’t been until recently that Lucius could see the fire that Narcissa had always seen in him.
"What was that?" Weasley stopped abruptly, waving his wand haphazardly. His Lumos lit up the area all around them, casting shadows in the surrounding forest in a creepy way. Blaise shivered as a cold wind blew all around them, making the tree shake, and in the safety of his own mind, he could admit that he was scared.
“No,” Lucius interrupted. “Why are you acting as if we’re…” he tightened his grip on his cane again, his eyes flicking unwillingly down to the silver ring still sitting on the edge of Severus’ desk. He wondered if Severus had even touched it since Lucius had asked to marry him. “I thought you knew I would always help you. You don’t have to ask as if we’re still hardly friends.”
Eventually, Tom Riddle released the Basilisk. Ron was determined to fight it, though he refused. It was a living creature; it wasn't the Basilisk's fault his master was evil. He was more focused on the diary slowly eating away at Ginny's life.
"Aren't you scared of me?" he asked, feeling utterly idiotic for talking to a bobcat, but those emerald eyes looked so familiar, so... intelligent. The bobcat screeched a meowed at him not even bothering to look up; he winced at the sound.
So, he’d been in Severus’ private rooms, feeling as if he should be crying but knowing he wouldn't be able to. Cedric was dead. He owed it to him to cry. But he couldn't. Cedric was dead.
“So,” Jones said, tapping a finger against the wood of the stand. “It’s fair to say that Potter was in a delicate state of mind when he met Severus Snape?”
to know. He looked over at Madam Pomfrey; she was busy in conversation with Hermione while tending Ron's wounds. He had time. He crept across the room, stopping just inside the infirmary door and listening for the sound of voices.
"Talk about trust," Draco answered, and he could feel it now. He could feel the numbness of shock dissipating and horrible realization of what Harry had been saying sinking in. He could feel the pain blossoming in his chest and the stinging behind his eyes, but he pushed it back. He pushed it back and forced himself to consider the horrible possibility that maybe it was better this way.
"You thought…" Harry started and then trailed off, shaking his head as if he couldn't even finish the thought. "Nice to know I'm that untrustworthy." And Draco almost missed the pain in his voice, covered quickly by anger and flashing green eyes.
"What are you doing?" Draco asked, watching him. Watching the way, his ribs expanded under his shirt, the way his shirt rode up just a little bit to show a tan stomach and hard packed muscles. He watched how Harry's hands moved over his clothes, brushing across his skin a little hesitantly but still with precision. He swallowed nervously, becoming aware of a rapidly increasing
"Ugh," Draco groaned; Harry was perched in his hair, digging his claws between blonde strands to keep himself seated as Draco shifted. He felt Draco freeze under him, and knew he should probably move, that Draco probably didn't appreciate him on his head, but he was
His hands were on Draco's face, tracing down to rest on the curve of his shoulders and feeling the scars where Greyback had marked him—the scars that made Draco a werewolf. Draco shuddered at his touch, his arms around Harry's back pulling him closer, tighter against his body.
He'd let himself fall in love with the boy with grey eyes and dark hair. The boy who wore yellow and taught him trust wasn't lost and that he wasn't worthless.
However, the Monday after Potter's date, Draco was forced to accept the possibility that Potter just couldn’t make smart decisions, whether he was around Draco or not.
Lucius followed Severus into his private rooms, shutting the door behind him. Severus was already at his tea table, pouring the kettle out with his back turned to Lucius. The air had been stagnant between them the past couple days, awkward. Lucius didn't know what to do. Obviously, sex had been insufficient to solve their problems.
"I don't think so," Harry answered, though truthfully, he had no idea. He shifted as he watched Malfoy; they were standing in the middle of Martin Johnson's house, his daughter standing a little off to the side as she watched them search. After she'd explained that her father had been missing for several days, she'd been more than happy to drag them back to his house and see them in.
It took Severus hours to return to his own chambers, covered in sweat with exhausted lines around his eyes. Harry was perched on his couch, his knees drawn up to his chest and his arms tight around his torso, ready for the scolding to begin.
“Why did you not tell me?” Severus asked, his hand flat against Lucius’ lower back, dangerously close to his rear.
"Uh," Harry answered, feeling awkward, cursing himself for not being quiet enough, fast enough from talking to him.
"Shall we find seats, then?" Harry asked, trying not to sound too awkward. Thankfully, Neville and Luna only nodded. He could feel the stares on his back as they wound their way through the train searching for an empty compartment. He couldn't tell if they were staring at him because he was with Draco or because of who he was though. He found he kind of liked not knowing.
"What are you laughing about?" the voice sounded from the bed in front of Draco, and both he and Weasley both stopped laughing abruptly, turning to stare at Harry with wide eyes. He was sitting up, blinking blearily at them. Draco picked up his glasses from the bedside table, handing them to him without taking his eyes off Harry's face.
When he emerged from his room—feeling clean and refreshed after his clothes had undergone a powerful
"Professor." He bit his lip. If Draco ever found out about this, Harry was dead, but then if Harry didn't find out what was going on, they might all be dead anyway. He remembered how Draco talked about Snape; they were obviously close. Draco cared about him; he just hoped Snape cared about Draco just as much. "I'm worried about Draco."
lie, but where would that get him? Umbridge already knew what was going on, lying about it wouldn’t make her any less suspicious. It would just exclude him from her plans.
"It should be," Potter answered, though Blaise wasn't a fool enough to think he was actually convinced. "So, is that all you know?"
"What?" Harry exclaimed, trying to turn to face him. "How could—" Draco's hands closed around his arms, squeezing so tightly Harry cut himself off with a breathless squeak of pain.
"Professor Snape, sir…." Theodore Nott trailed off, looking between the three of them with some confusion. "Sorry to interrupt, sir."
of that touch against his skin. Their eyes locked and all rational thought flew out of Harry's head.
"What?" Draco answered, and he could feel the anger ebbing away, replaced by shock and confusion and- "Why would I—You're the one who left me alone on a full moon to go run off with
"Yeah," Draco answered, his voice still that normal emotionless tone as if he didn't care about the havoc he was causing to Harry's heart.
As the days passed, Harry grew more and more worried. Had he said something wrong? Did Draco no longer want to see him? Did he just want privacy? Harry wondered bitterly how it was ok for Draco to do that but not him.
“Whatever comes,” Draco answered, his hand wrapping around Harry's. And Harry lifted his gaze, dark green eyes locking onto Draco’s. “We’ll deal with it.”
Harry was quick to follow him, tucking his arms in and willing himself to change into his bobcat form. He was on four legs by the time Draco was changed, looking up at his nose. Draco lowered his face a fraction, smelling him with a deep sniff before turning and lumbering off in the opposite direction. Harry followed him, stepping over a leaf as he did. He knew Draco could hear him, knew by the way Draco’s ears twitched back.
"What did Nott threaten to do?" Harry asked, completely ignoring Severus' question. He sighed; he should have known it wouldn't have worked. Once Harry moved on, he moved on. There was no getting him back.
“I need to ask you something,” Draco answered. He didn’t bother to say hello. It wasn’t as if this was a social visit. He could have gone his whole life without seeing Lupin again, without hearing his voice.
shagging Pansy. The only person he was ‘jumping in the corridors’ was you," she finished, eyes shining with mirth.
“Just…” he interrupted, and Draco could feel Harry clench his eyes closed against his chest. “If this is your way of leaving then just don’t bother.”
"You know what's going on," he said. Harry looked at him, dark green eyes unreadable. He didn't even have the decency to look ashamed about keeping something like this from Draco.
Draco probably looked like a completely idiot, staring at Harry with his mouth slightly open. Harry was certainly chuckling at him, pressing himself against Draco to kiss his neck. Draco bit his lip to stifle his groan. Harry’s mouth was just a tad distracting. Even more distracting than the fact that he wanted Draco to…that he wanted Draco
"You're smarted than I gave you credit for," the voice said, interrupted Harry and echoing across the large space. Harry reacted instinctively, putting himself in front of Malfoy and drawing his wand. He heard a strangled gasp behind him, but he was more focused on the man in front of him.
“I just…” Harry trailed off, unsure how to answer. He remembered Draco's presence in his mind like a ghost fluttering between the branches of a tree. There but not there. He wasn't exactly sure what Draco had seen, and he was terrified to ask. There were so many things he didn’t want Draco to know about him.
"You're having nightmares again," Severus said. He didn't know why he bothered; it wasn't as if Harry ever answered. Which was exactly why Severus wanted to him to go to a mind healer. To talk to someone. Except that Harry was more stubborn than was good for him.
Harry was laying across his bed, one foot on his floor, the other bent at the knee when his portrait sprang open, and Draco walked in. Harry hadn't even known he was missing him until he was there, coming over and sitting on the bed by Harry's hips. As he looked up into Draco's silver-grey eyes, he couldn't help remembering Severus' words, his questions.
"My Lord?" Bellatrix asked, and she was already twirling her wand between her fingers, stepping toward Lucius threateningly.
“Severus Snape supervised Potter during the summer months,” McGonagall answered, leaning all the way back in her seat like she was trying to get away from Jones.
I have decided that there will be a third installment, though it will be only about 10 chapter longs, so significantly shorter. I've already begun writing, so if there's anything you're curious about or want to see, now's the time to let me know! It will be titled These Bare Eyes and posted after a 2 week Hiatus on September 30th.
"Don't pretend to know him," Harry said. Of course, it was Harry who came to his rescue. Of course, it was Harry who believed in him when he least deserved it.
"We believe the connection is strongest when you are your most relaxed and vulnerable, such as asleep. And as such, you are able to share the Dark Lord's thoughts and emotions." Severus ceased his pacing. "I am sure you appreciate why this must stop."
"Indeed," Severus said. "Now, I expect you both every Monday at 6 o'clock in my office. If anyone asks Potter is taking Remedial Potions and Mr. Malfoy is assisting him with them." Severus didn’t wait before he swept from the room, his cloak snapping behind him.
"Surely, you've seen how he's been acting," Harry answered. "Sneaking around, hiding things. I can corner him tonight and figure out what's going on, but not if I'm stuck here."
"Oh?" Lucius set his tea down, leaning forward to listen better. He figured this was a monumental day indeed, Harry Potter asking for advice. He wondered when the last time the boy had truly let himself acknowledge that he needed help was. It couldn't have been any time soon if the pained expression on the boy's face was anything to go by.
"I didn't mean—" Harry said, his green eyes wide. Well, it was too little, too late and Draco wasn't about to be persuaded by those eyes. Not this time. Not when he could feel the bitterness and disappointment and hurt bubbling up in him. He had been so close.
"Harry Potter," Hermione snapped, making Harry look up at her in befuddlement. "Stop being so stupid."
"You think I don't feel?" Draco asked, talking almost before Harry had finished. His voice was low and soft, echoing around in Harry's head far more effectively than Harry's shouting could ever have been. "You think, what? That I don’t talk to you because I’m afraid you’ll break?” Harry was too disturbed by Draco's tone to nod, but he seemed to feel Harry's intention. “You don’t have the first clue what I think.”
“I can’t believe the rumors going around about Harry and Snape,” Ginny said, her fingers tight against her quill.
"Stay away from him," Dracona told her, still standing in front of Harry, though logically she knew that wouldn't matter.
"They say all groups have to be disbanded until Umbridge gives them permission to reform," Harry told him, his voice sounding unusually quiet after all the yelling.
Lucius stood and made his way out of his rooms and down to the dungeons. He was sure Severus was already gone, but if this time was anything like the last time, perhaps he would need help when he came back through. And perhaps Lucius would just happen to be there when he did.
"Draco is so full of anger, of fight and hate." Harry let out a bitter laugh, his eyes never leaving the window. "He's not tired of it yet. When I'm around him, I can just... He's angry enough for the both of us."
He sighed, looking down the hall. He'd skipped breakfast, unable to take another morning of Malfoy adamantly pretending he didn’t exist just to flirt with Parkinson. He wished he could just wave Draco off the way Malfoy waved him off. Forget all about him except when he was horny and immediately in front of him. He tugged self-consciously on the collar of his shirt, the bruise Malfoy had left on his neck was thankfully right below the collar of his robes. It still felt insanely visible to everyone walking by.
Harry sighed, relaxing a fraction, and even in the middle of their argument, Draco still reveled in it. He reveled in the fact that
"Nonsense," Blaise answered, his smile wide and charming. "You're right on time, everyone else is just late."
Lucius had lost his robes as they entered the lake, the current dragging on them too much for him to make decent progress. Severus had followed his example soon after, leaving them both in shirts and trousers. Sprout and the three students were still in their pajamas, floating as they made their way through the murky waters of the Black Lake.
have gotten too far, maybe he had just turned a corner and was waiting for Harry there. Harry started to take a step and then realized Cho was talking again. "...for the Hogsmeade trip this month?"
shagging, and Harry would replay all the possibilities in his head over and over again. If only he hadn't made that stupid comment to Draco all those months ago, would things be different now?
were anything to go by. Draco had ignored them all; his father would give him hell for that when he got home, but Draco was of the firm belief that a summer beating was inevitable no matter
do anything," Severus answered, one hand coming up to brush across Lucius' thigh. He looked thoughtful, brows pulled low over his eyes, greasy hair hanging over his face. It was really time Lucius got him into a shower. Honestly.
As near as I can figure, Dumbledore ordered Potter to recruit students and get them battle ready. Potter was never in charge; he was just doing as he was told." Harry blinked once, twice, and
"No," Severus answered, and there was a look in his eyes that Harry hadn't seen before as he answered. Dark and sad, and Harry imagined it was the same way Severus had looked on those nights he'd shut him out. "You're not weak, and you're not broken," Severus paused, looking down at him so seriously Harry felt the need to run. Just turn around and run before he had to face whatever Severus would say to him, whatever Severus would make him face. "But that doesn't mean you don't need help."
And so, he befriended Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger ,and he gallivanted around the school, pretending like he was comfortable. Pretending like he didn't see through the façade of half the people who talked to him. Because really, being liked for his name was better than being hated for his face.
"He was snogging her in full view of everyone," definitely Hermione's voice answered, her voice pitched with hurt and anger. "After he already agreed to go to Slughorn's Christmas Party with me." There was a beat of silence as Draco seemed to register what Hermione was saying.
—why wouldn't they stop? His throat hurt, and he hurt, and he was trembling—couldn't seem to stop trembling.
"Well," Potter said, stretching his arms forward and up and then standing. "This was exciting and all, but I do have other things to be doing…" Draco stood to follow him, having no intention of staying in that office with Remus Lupin and Dumbledore by himself.
And he hesitated both because he didn't know what to do in this situation, and because Severus still looked so shocked, still so closed off from him. It only lasted another moment though, and then Severus was leaning forward, their lips smashing together as Lucius met him halfway. He stepped forward, shoving Severus back and delighting in the huff that was breathed into his mouth.
"Begone! I will not fall for your tricks again!" she yelled, her ghostly voice filling the space around him and echoing around in his head, and he was running before he knew what he was doing.
They were some of the first to arrive, only McLaggen—a Gryffindor brute that Draco had heard Granger complain about often enough—was there before them. Blaise stood smoothly at his side as Slughorn bowed—not at all gracefully—to them and continued to chat with McLaggen. Longbottom was the next to arrive, and suddenly Blaise was all eyes, his head swiveling around and his eyes locking on Longbottom's face.
Draco's first instinct was to lean forward, to push Harry back against the headboard, to press his body against Harry's, but he'd done that last time and it hadn’t exactly worked out. Besides, this wasn't about him. Instead, he leaned back, taking Harry with him until they were sprawled on the bed with Harry half laying on top of Draco. He broke the kiss, his green eyes staring down at Draco with shock and uncertainty, and Draco knew Harry had absolutely no idea where to go from there.
"We've talked about this, Potter," Malfoy answered, wrenching Harry back into the moment. Malfoy, of course, hadn't bother to move his arse off Harry's desk. He hadn't even bothered to open his eyes.
doing a good job. He just hoped it made a difference to the Wizengamet. There was still a lot of prejudice against Werewolves, and that didn’t go away just because Weasley was stupid or Lucius bribed them.
"Hermione told me that you heard I was on the case, so you requested to be put on it with me," he said, almost stuttering over his words. Malfoy glanced up, as if he was almost looking for an answer up on the ceiling. He sighed loudly, glancing back down to stare at Harry with his sharp grey eyes intense.
," Pansy whined and much to his annoyance, wrapped her fingers around his arm again. "Are you even listening?" She blinked up at him, trying to look entirely too innocent, and even if Draco was attracted to her, it would have been off putting.
"Ah," Lucius smiled slightly, relaxing back in his chair and crossing his legs as he examined the room in front of him. This was a conversation he could understand. "That
Draco shoved Harry's pants down, letting them fall around his ankles and watching as Harry kicked them off his feet. Draco slid his hands back up the back of his legs, stopped when Harry tensed. Draco immediately took his hands away from Harry's arse, relishing in the way Harry relaxed against him again, pressing his body against Draco's.
“Something’s bothering you,” Severus muttered, not bothering to raise his eyes. Harry didn’t bother to answer. He was sprawled out, his left leg hooked over the chair’s arm, his right tucked against his body. Severus sat across from him; the chessboard set between them.
"Calm down, Harry Potter," Dobby's voice said. Harry started, turning to face the elf in shock. "I is helping." He tugged once on Harry's arm and this time he let Dobby drag him down the corridor and into an empty room, spelling the room locked a moment later.
"Harry," Draco twisted his wrist around, and Harry seemed to realize he was still holding it. His fingers sprang apart and he went to move away, but Draco grabbed his hand, holding it between both his hands. "Has anyone ever touched you and not tried to hurt you?"
"Ok," Ron said slowly. "And do you know where he is?" Harry stared at him, blinking once, then twice before the truth sank in.
how close to shitting his pants he was? Everyone was staring straight at Harry, waiting. Draco sighed, evidently, he was the only
He couldn't get Lupin's words out of his head. The way he'd said them, as if there was no way to escape mating with Harry, the way he’d seemed to pity Draco as if he understood his dilemma but didn’t sympathize. And Draco couldn't help but think that maybe he'd already screwed it up, except that he didn't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing, and he already had enough to think about with the full moon, and he really just wanted Harry to talk to him.
"And if there had been, would you have done it?" Lupin asked. He was baring his teeth now, looking as if he was about to lunge forward and rip into Harry, and Draco couldn't hold in the growl that startled low in his throat. Lupin ignored him. "You always hated Sirius. You always blamed him, but he died for you, and you treated him like scum!"
He wasn't looking forward to a class taught by Lupin. Not half of which because Harry seemed to hate the man twice as much as Draco ever could. And indeed, it was no surprise when they walked in, and as soon as Lupin looked over at them, Harry scowled and moved to sit as far from him as possible.
"Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore stood abruptly, his eyes widening with a combination of surprise and horror on his face. And sure, Harry would have stood, he would have cooed over the poor broken Malfoys if he didn’t suspect that Dumbledore was about to do a good enough job without him.
fault." He turned suddenly to Dumbledore. "This is your fault. YOURS. You're the one that left him out to dry when he—he needed help. When he—"
“And how does that excuse this?” Draco snapped at him, watching as Lupin’s eyes widened as he stared back at Draco with a look too close to remorse to be comfortable. They were almost to the entry hall, and he could just barely smell the smoke of the Fiendfire; he could hear it crackling behind them, though he was sure they were in no danger from it anymore.
" Smith opened his mouth to say something, but Draco's glare silenced him. Harry ordered them all into pairs, leaving Neville and Draco standing in the middle of the room. Draco's upper lip curled, but Harry spoke before he could.
Thanks so much for reading. Don't hesitate to leave a comment about anything you liked or even didn't!
There were a couple of close calls, but every time Draco started to turn around, he had a telling tilt of his head that gave him away, and Harry was able to scramble back.
Scrimgeour stood up, his hands flat against the podium in front of him. He glared across the room, and Harry turned his head to see Lucius’ lips curve up, his hand relaxed against the head of his walking stick. Draco reached over, wrapping his fingers around Harry’s trembling hand and squeezing.
"And what about you?" Harry said, feeling trapped and angry. Though completely unsure who he was angry at. "Have you ever thought for a second how much you hurt me by walking away?" Draco flinched, squeezing his eyes shut.
"I, uh, hello th're Malfoy," Hagrid answered, shifted uncomfortably. "We were just goin' for a walk."
And Blaise—while all the other 'smarter' people in the room may not have—recognized the look in Potter's eyes.
And just as suddenly as the light in his heart snapped on, it snapped back off. He lowered his head and followed Snape up the path to his manor.
They were just coming out of Hagrid's hut when Harry caught sight of Draco. He wasn't sure if he was meant to see; judging from the way Draco was sneaking out of the Forbidden forest, looking as if he was hiding something under his cloak, Harry would say no.
Ron suddenly hissed. Harry flinched, looking up at his friend. Somewhere in his haze of not paying attention, Hagrid had arrived beside them and Hermione was gone.
"Obviously, you're not mated yet, but he's who you've chosen,” Lupin said, the pity clear on his face.
"We'll go in the morning?" Malfoy answered, his voice lilting in the end as if it were a question, not a command. And when had Malfoy stopped being haughty and commanding and telling everyone who could get within earshot what to do? Harry blinked at him, feeling confused and startled and having no idea why. "What?" Malfoy asked suddenly, his voice sharp with annoyance, and Harry realized he was still staring like an idiot.
"How stupid can you get, Potter?" Malfoy asked, his voice low and angry and Harry should not have felt heat pool low in his stomach.
“I…” And Severus just stared at him as if he was speaking a different language, his dirty hair falling into his face. And Lucius didn’t understand why it was such a surprise. “That’s all?”
"I apologize," he stepped closer to Severus and reaching out to place a hand on his shoulder. Severus frowned, his lips curving down severely as he backed out of from under Lucius' hand.
"Why did you help me if you didn't care?" he asked, watching as Harry flinched away from him, recoiling into himself.
"Be quiet, Harry," Dumbledore murmured, looking intently as Draco. "Or I am afraid you will have to leave my office." All eyes were on Dumbledore now, waiting for his next move. Waiting to see whether he would dispute Draco's charges or be forced to admit to them.
"Whatever," she said, sounding entirely too put upon. "Harry wanted me to tell you we have a place to practice for the DA."
He looked away, abruptly cutting off that line of thought. It was still dark outside, the curtains over the windows open just wide enough for Harry to pick that up. Good, he wouldn't have to pass anyone on the street looking as if he'd just shagged his partner.
"Why didn't you go to the headmaster?" Draco asked. "Why come to me?" Harry blinked, and then blushed. The idea hadn’t even occurred to him.
Draco stumbled into Harry’s room, lugging Harry in behind him and trying desperately to stifle his laughter. It shouldn’t have been funny—the way Harry was able to push Lucius’ buttons. The way Harry was able to look Lucius in the eye with that defiant edge in his voice.
Harry was bored, though he spent most of his days bored, so he didn't know why he was complaining now. Ever since Severus had taken over as headmaster, he'd been busy running the school, and Lucius was busy teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and Potions now that Severus only had time to teach a few high-level classes. Frankly, Harry figured they both must have been running on will alone.
"Hey!" he yelled when he was about ten feet away. "Hey, stop right there!" They turned, Harry's eyes going wide when he realized who was following them. Granger shifted just a little to the side and Draco stopped in his tracks. "Hagrid?" he asked, looking up at the towering figure that he couldn’t believe he’d mistake as Umbridge before.
"Yes," he answered, throwing Draco a cautious look before turning his attention back to Slughorn, but it was already too late. He already had the man's attention.
"I should…" Harry murmured, his eyes flicking up to Draco's face and then away again. "I should go." Harry crossed toward the door, moving away from Draco with steps so fast he could have been running. He
Harry flicked his wand to edit the message on Severus' bedside to tell him where to find Harry before leaving. Severus pretended stoicism, but he'd thrown one too many fits about Harry disappearing without a word for it to be believable. Harry crossed the dungeon and started up the stairs. He'd just left the dungeons when the voice sounded from behind him. He'd been steadily ignoring the portrait's complaining, refusing to put out his light as he plotted down the endless hallways and up the moving stairways. He would have doused his wand, though, if he'd known anyone else was patrolling tonight.
"I didn't—" Harry blushed, beginning to backtrack. Then he stopped himself, he hadn't spoken aloud, had he? Come to think of it, how had Draco known he had been thinking of alien planets, as well? "You're reading my thoughts?"
He didn't really have a response to that, or the easy way Granger talked to him. She seemed to genuinely like him, not just put up with his presence because Harry liked him. It was strange, but Draco found he didn't much mind her either. She wasn't quite the annoying know it all everyone had always said she was.
"Let go of me!" Severus snapped, yanking his arm away from Lucius, glaring at him from under his greasy hair. And it didn't take a genius to figure out how gorgeous he was when he was angry. Not tradition beauty, no. Lucius had never thought Severus was traditionally beautiful, but he had always loved Severus' spark. The way he held his emotions at the tip of his fingertips, so easy to spill over and yet so far from being discovered. And when Severus was angry, it was gorgeous, because Lucius finally
"I wouldn't," he answered, eyes flashing as he stepped into Harry's face. And Harry stepped back, the shudder passing through him before he could stop it. Zabini eyed him, some of his anger seeming to drain from Harry's distress, and he didn't come close again. "Why not ask Lupin? Isn't he a werewolf too?"
"Don't pull that shite with me," Draco snapped, and Harry looked up, green eyes startled as they locked with Draco's. But Draco was done. He was done being careful and considerate, and he wanted answers. He wanted answers that Harry was going to give him. He stepped forward, still several feet away and yet knowing he was a close as Harry could be comfortable with.
"Mr. Malfoy," Umbridge turned to him, her eyes flashing with suspicion. "What do you mean? You were looking for Mr. Potter?"
"Ever so pleasant, Weasley," Draco said, eyes never leaving Harry's. "I need to speak with you." Ron opened his mouth to deliver another scathing comment.
They sat in awkward silence for a long minute, staring away from each other as if they hadn't run through the forest as werewolves last night. Draco sighed to himself; as sore and dirty and tired as he felt now, he also felt a lot less… confined than he usually did after a transformation. He felt free somehow. As if that was how it was supposed to be.
