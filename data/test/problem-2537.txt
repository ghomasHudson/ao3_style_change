We sat there in silence and tucked into our food. Well, I did; I was watching Harry from the corner of my eye. All he seemed to be doing was pushing the food around on his plate. “Are you okay Harry? I notice that your not eating," I said. I turned to look at him.
I heard Charlie's footsteps behind me. “Charlie, I don't see anything of..." Before I finished my sentence, Charlie's hand caught my arm. He spun me around and pressed his lips to mine harshly. He moved his lips over mine, forcing his tongue past my lips.
Mother served the tea, adding sugar to each mug, and passing them around. I added a splash of cream to Harry's mug before I passed it to him. He smiled at me, and we began to eat. After a few minutes, I noticed that Harry was just picking at his food. “Is everything alright Harry? You haven't eaten much," I said. I placed my hand over his. He glanced up at me, his green eyes holding a vacant look.
~~~~~
“Ronald, you are my business. You and Harry need to talk about this," she snapped.
“Not since last night. I looked for your glasses when I got up, but I couldn't find them. I honestly have no idea where they landed when I took them off your face."
“Kingsley, who I date in my private life isn't up for a discussion right now. Just know that I'm happy and you know I haven't had many chances of being happy since I was one."
“Look Hermione, I know you think I probably shouldn't have said that to him, but I didn't want to hurt him. After all, I honestly can't stop him if he wants to be with someone else. It just means he'll be happy while I'm miserable," I said, turning back to face Draco's and Pansy's still going on dance off. It looked like Draco was winning, but I was too far away to see the actual score.
“My husband works for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. I'm sure I could find something to pin on you. Now, talk!" She snapped.
Mrs. Weasley handed him a small blue package. “Here, open this one dear. It's from Jolene," she said. He tore into the paper with all the enthusiasm of a kid during the holidays. When he opened the box, he pulled out a small silver pocket watch.
“Okay, I don't know exactly where he is. He quit working here. Last I heard from him, he was going to try and get a job at Seamus' bookstore."
“Yes."
“My bedroom," I answered. I put my hands on the serpents and pushed the doors to my room open. I stepped to the side and allowed him to enter.
“While I may not understand your desire to drive, I do like this car," Draco said. He was still rubbing his hand against the leather.
I pulled the sheet and blanket up to his chin. I pressed a gentle kiss to Harry's forehead. After straightening my spine, I made my way out of his bedroom door, closing it gently behind me. I made my way to my own bedroom and once I was inside, I quickly stripped myself down to my boxers. I summoned my pajama pants and pulled them on. I crawled into bed, willing myself to go to sleep. The pillows next to me were loaded with Harry's sent; he smelled like coconut, honey and fresh citrus fruits. I grabbed one of the pillows and breathed in deeply. I sighed and closed my eyes.
“Yeah."
“What do you mean by that?" I asked her.
“I think Blaise just hit me with a stinging hex. I'm gonna go talk to him. He's been acting weird lately," I said. I slid off his lap and followed Blaise out the door. I made my way down the corridor and found him in the entryway, staring out the open doors at the grounds.
“Harry, I think your boyfriend is getting tired," Steve's voice said to me as I was sweeping the floor.
. These thoughts bounced around in my head as I made my way back to our booth.
My brain began to race as I thought about his offer. On the one hand, I loved it when I got to be in control in the bedroom. Harry was the only guy that had ever let me be on Top. On the other hand, Harry's dominance in the bedroom made me feel alive; sometimes our love making was rough and bordered on pain; other times, he was so gentle with me, he made me feel as though I was the most precious thing in his world. “While I love it when I get the chance to be on Top, I love you Topping me a whole lot more. Do what you will with me, Harry," I said.
“Merlin, Harry! I'm not cheating on you! I know how it feels to be betrayed by someone you love! I've been down that road too many times! I could never DO that to ANYONE!!! Especially, not to You!" He yelled. He turned his back on me again. Again, I noticed the hickey looking bruise on the back of his neck.
~~~~~
I felt him sprawl over my back as he leaned down and whispered in my ear, “Cum for me, Draco. I know you're close."
“Couldn't it have waited until tomorrow at least? I asked her.
I finally made my way out the door, wondering if I would be able to follow my own rules about our relationship.
“Okay, now I have two questions. One, why didn't you just apparate us straight inside, and two, what's going to happen when your mother sees us?"
“Harry?"
I glanced down at the menu where he was pointing. Suddenly, a platter of tortilla chips and a cup of queso cheese with chili was placed on the table in between us. “So, have you decided on what you want?" Kyle asked. He pulled something from his apron. He seemed to have eyes only for Harry.
“Master Draco? Are yous okay?" I heard Dempsey call through the closed door.
She led us down a hallway and through a large door. The first thing I noticed was Hermione laying on a large bed, a small bundle of pink blankets in her arms. Then, I noticed the Weasley family surrounding her. My eyes passed over Bill, George, and Ginny, before I stopped in my tracks. Charlie was standing next to the bed, looking down at Hermione, a small smile on his face. My heart started to pound as I looked at him.
“Nightmare? But it was real. I felt the spell cut through my skin. I even felt the blood spilling out of me."
“Well, I'm not your mother, but I should lecture you about what you did. That is something stupid even in the Muggle world," said an entirely different voice.
~~~~~
“Where will you go?" I asked him. My throat tightened at the thought of him leaving.
“I shouldn't tell you this, and Dean will probably be angry at me for saying anything, but you should know that Draco's been in St. Mungo's for the last week."
“Relax Draco. I don't think Hermione will hurt you," I whispered to him.
“Look, Ron, it wasn't my idea to hide my relationship from you. Charlie felt that everyone would be disappointed with us being together. First there's the age difference and then there's the fact that he is your brother," I said.
“When do we eat? I'm starving," Ron said.
Before I could question him, he leaned over and locked his lips to mine. He pressed me back against the mattress and straddled my hips. Through the cotton of our pajama pants, Harry's erection rubbed against mine. I moaned and broke away from his lips. Harry moved his lips down my neck. I moaned again when he bit into my flesh, then sucked on the spot and soothed it with his tongue.
I felt a surge of magic from his hand. In seconds, my stomach settled and I was able to breathe properly without gagging. I leaned back into his embrace, resting my head against his shoulder. He wrapped his other arm around me and stood up, pulling me off the floor with him. He took a few steps, and sat down on his sofa, pulling me onto his lap. He raised his wand and flames burst to life in the fireplace, producing a soft light.
Ron glanced over. “Should we talk to Draco? I doubt he's noticed that Harry's gone," he said.
“Lately when I come home, I'm exhausted. It's getting harder and harder to handle the older dragons," he said. He kept his back towards me. I noticed his hands were trembling.
He glanced at me over his shoulder as he tugged the jeans over his hips. He fastened the snap on his jeans before he turned to face me. “Yeah, I got a hold of my boss and he needs me to come in tonight. Actually, he sounded sorta desperate for me to come in," he said as he reached for the belt laying across his bed. He threaded it through his belt loops, never taking his eyes away from me.
“How about that bruise on the back of your neck? Looks like a hickey to me," I said.
“Since I moved in," he said, looking down at the floor.
“Well, actually Harry, I want to watch you play that hunting game again. I want to see if you can beat your own high score," Pansy said.
“That's the issue. While he didn't cause the wounds directly, he knows that you harmed yourself because of his leaving. Seeing that those are still relatively new, his magic responded," Dean said.
“You expect me to believe that pack of lies, Marcus?"
“Last week."
~~~~~
I grabbed my house robe that hung from one of my bed posts. I tugged it on and belted it around my waist. I padded barefoot over to my door. I unlocked the door and stepped out into the hall. I gently pulled the door shut behind me. “Poppy," I said. With a small pop, a house elf appeared in front of me. Her hair was almost as blonde as mine, her large chocolate brown eyes stared up at me, and she wore an old t-shirt as a dress.
“Alright everyone, let's eat," Mr. Weasley said. And with a flick of his wand, the food began to serve itself.
“You should know me. We shared a dorm since we were eleven." He said. His brown eyes stared at me. He ran a hand through his short black hair.
“What's so fascinating about my kitchen table, Malfoy?" Charlie snapped, turning to glare at Draco.
“Hey, Harry?" He turned his head to look at me. “I know you said that you don't work as an Auror, but can I ask if you have a job?"
“Why would she ask you about me? Your family has always hated me," I said to him.
Potter just stares at him.
“Nope, hates me. I solved one of his cases back when I first started training and he’s still bitter about it.”
Molly finally left the yarn shop, arms filled with bags. She grinned as she saw Draco and Ginevra. “All set! Are you two ready to head home?”
And suddenly you’re furious. “Were you
“You’re not allergic to anything, at least that I know of. Pet peeves... people who assume they know you. Slow talkers. People who use your name to get things.” Malfoy grinned tentatively.
Draco purses his lips. “Trying to get me drunk, Potter?”
“I mean – yes, I’m familiar with the concept of gender identity,” Malfoy replies.
“Kinky, Potter.”
“What about a teacher?” Draco suggests. “Didn’t you teach the Gryffindors how to duel, and all that?”
“Draco, look, I’m sorry, I just- I know you had a terrible time tonight.” Potter has the audacity to look absolutely miserable. “I shouldn’t have made you come with me, I just…”
Padma turns. “Oh, it’s you.”
“Harry James Potter, of course he'll tell you that he wasn't trying to kill himself. He probably didn't realize that that's what was going on because his magic was healing the wounds. But if his magic hadn't been involved, that first cut could have been fatal," she said, crossing her arms.
“Are you saying that he's suffering because of me?" I asked.
because he was sleeping with Marcus Flint for three months."
~~~~~
He looked at me for a moment, then gently pulled his arm away from me. He turned and made his way towards a small desk, the heals of his shoes clicking softly against the floor. I followed him. The young medi-wizard behind the desk looked up at us as we approached. “Ah, Mr. Malfoy. Been wondering if you would arrive today."
I stared at him, trying to figure out if he was lying to me. “Matter o' fact, he's in that direction somewhere," the Irishman said, pointing in the direction of the far corner.
“I'm your mother, Draco. If I want to throw you a birthday party, I'm going to do it whether you like it or not," she answered, looking up from her party-planning book.
“I wanted to hurt him so bad for everything he said about you. I still want to rip him to pieces because of everything he's ever done to you," Harry growled.
After about ten minutes, everyone had a bowling ball that was just right for them. Hermione explained the rules, pointing out the foul line on the floor, then she rolled the first ball, knocking over four pins. She then rolled her second ball, but it rolled into the gutter. I took my turn, bowling a strike on the first toss. After a couple of rounds, the others caught on and it soon was Gryffindors versus Slytherins, the six of us competing against each other like old times.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “It was… I can’t say it was better than I thought, because I’d never been able to give it much thought, if I’m honest. But it was nice, being out like that. Just… out. Able to go wherever without looking for photographers or worrying about being mobbed. I’d do it again, if you wanted to.” He held up his coffee and gestured at the river. “I guess we are, actually.” He grinned. “Still nice.”
“Six of one, the way Hermione tells it.”
“You keep ignoring it.”
The fire died down as soon as Millie ended the call. Draco stood and surveyed the room. He’d thrown back the sheets in his rush to the Floo and bed called out to him, but he knew he had no hope of falling back to sleep.
Baby? More effective than a puking pastille.
“I’m not sure what else you mean to suggest.”
“You’ve got the right cheekbones for those big fuzzy hats,” he tried for humour. It fell flat. “I was joking. No one should go to Siberia. My father might be there.” She didn’t move a muscle. No hint of a smile. “Pans. I’m not going to ask you to leave the house, much less the country. I might’ve wanted to leave, but that doesn’t mean I get to tell you too.”
, destroyed a thousand-year old trolley system, and tore up a wizarding heritage building, and that was just the first act.”
Draco looks up at him, startled. “Why?”
"Yes."
“Right.” Harry sighed and rubbed his eyes, effectively hiding his face.
The moon was high enough and full enough to cast light over the shoreline and Harry had the distinct sense that he ought to be looking at it, but his entire focus was trained on Draco.
Nothing.
As it was, his legs were pinned between mine, my hands braced at either side of his head. His, “Yes,” was low, tentative. Perhaps a bit afraid.
“Okay.” Draco stood and held out a hand. “Let me help you to a chair?”
“Er, yeah. They…it reminds them of the war. You know. Or just freaks them out, sometimes.”
Blaise returns it. “We try.”
Harry has worked around magical tools long enough to know that it’s unwise to open this sort of thing in this sort of place, but it doesn’t stop him from walking forward, lifting the whole box off the bench, weighing it in his hands. Tempted further, he picks up a smaller box and weighs that too, admiring the delicate folds of the paper, wondering what it holds.
“Streets. My flat, if you want to walk me home. Or we turn right and on to the Rue Bonaparte, if you’d like to walk back to the hotel, with company or without. Or there’s Apparition. There are cafés, too, though they’ll be closed by now, and a few bars that won’t be.”
“Prippa,” Draco tried again.
“Oh.” Harry’s chest empties.
Draco found that agreeable.
Draco pulled back first. His pupils were blown wide and he was as breathless as Harry, and they sat, looking at each other, Harry’s hand still gripping Draco’s waist through his sweater. Harry would have been happy to stay there for the rest of the night, and Draco looked as stunned as he felt, both of them so blown away that they might have stayed sitting there until sunrise.
“Yes, but if my face remembers correctly you’ve also got a soft spot for brute force.”
“Blimey.” Harry looks up at the shelves, glistening bottles reaching towards the ceiling. “That’s – Merlin, where were they hiding that?”
“So, you don’t want to do it again, then?”
“I want you to talk to me,” Malfoy whispered.
As Draco approached, Potter set his book down on the table next to the window, folding his hands in his lap and offering Draco a tight smile. “Dr Malfoy. Good morning.”
“You have the pertinent details.”
He wraps it around the neck of the Champagne bottle that's still sitting where his father's owl had left it and sends it to the mail room.
“The stubble and morning Scotch-breath say otherwise.”
She narrowed her eyes. “I just have to tell you I won’t repeat anything?”
He takes a step back, his heart pounding. Of all the possibilities, to be found… to be found is among the worst.
Potter focused on the leaf. “No one should be spoken to like I spoke to her.”
“No,” Potter tried, “I was. Obviously.”
She paused, set her glass on the bar, and hugged him, burying her nose in his shoulder and holding tight.
“Thanks,” he managed.
Maybe it’s not intuition. Maybe he’s slipping Veritaserum into my drinks. Must be, because I just told him I didn’t like it much, the honesty. Which means I admitted to it. Which means I admitted to being dishonest at other points. Which doesn’t bother me nearly as much as it should, perhaps since I’m increasingly certain that he already knew.
“No, but I can imagine.”
“Well how else would you sugg–”
“In fairness, you didn’t run.”
“Sir?” He peeks around the door.
“It’s one of a set,” Draco repeats. “Three ceremonial knives, passed down through the Black family. Ownership of them was last transferred to,” his voice cracks and he hates himself for it, “three sisters. Each received one of them on her seventeenth birthday.”
Potter balked. “You’re joking.”
Draco takes Harry’s bollocks back in his mouth, tugging gently, giving him a hint of teeth that leaves him gasping, drawing away and then shifting down for more.
Draco drew his wand and cast drying and warming charms in quick succession. “Not to worry.”
They fall into a surveillance pattern. Harry alternates between lazy loops of the sky and sitting on the tallest branches of the tree he’d practised in. Draco floats through the air, sometimes lying on his back, sometimes turning on his stomach, sometimes righting himself and whizzing past Harry so quickly Harry’s sure he’s seen the snitch.
“Don’t ‘Pansy’ me, Draco. I’m not stupid. You might be, but I’m not.”
- As the Ministry’s poster boy – sometimes literally – it stands to reason that Potter will be in attendance at all of these.
Instead, I barely gasped out my request for him to fuck me. He froze for a moment, then, I think so absorbed in the fingering that he’d forgotten about his own erection. Which was bobbing, gorgeous and flushed and full, in front of him as he looked me over. He asked if I was sure. “Yes.” “Really sure?” “
Just then, Peter walked up to their table. “And how is the lovely couple enjoying the cruise?”
Draco likes having Greg as a roommate. He's quiet. Doesn't really care what Draco gets up to. But Draco thinks back to their first few years at Hogwarts, when he, Greg, and Vince stayed up all night joking and laughing and throwing things at each other. Draco hopes that Greg is okay. He can't bring himself to ask.
Harry crumples up the wrapping paper and throws it at him. Draco’s never going to let him live that one down.
Draco let out a surprised laugh. “Okay?”
“It was nice,” Harry says, still feeling the need for complete and utter honesty.
“It’s not as if I’m wanting for money,” he drawls. “I’m happy to support your practice.”
The exam doesn’t take long. Eleanor is tiny, and there’s nothing wrong with her.
Harry’s not surprised to see Malfoy here, but he is surprised when he walks over despite Luna being away.
“Listen, I’m not going to force you on the boat. But I’m getting on. And you know Molly’s going to be talking about this for the next few months, if not longer. We’re getting married, Malfoy, you’re not going to be able to avoid her.”
Bertha replies.
Malfoy Transfigures the singular bed into two and claims the one closest to the window as his. Harry breathes a silent sigh of relief at being closer to the door. His Auror training is still in high gear, and Harry can’t imagine that changing anytime soon. Malfoy slips his shoes off and takes a book out of one of his drawers before sitting down on his bed.
Draco almost smiled, but his outrage was still bubbling. “Good night, Potter.”
been wanting that? Do you even know what you’ve been doing to
Ron and Hermione are over for Friday night dinner, helping them come up with a good name for it. Draco suggests ‘The Snake Charmer.’ Harry grins, remembering that’s what Draco first thought his Muggle practice was for. But then Draco gets him a wall hanging with the new name on it, and it’s even more suggestive than the ‘Blown to Slyther-Eens’ one. Harry still puts it in his private office.
Draco leans in. “Why? What’d you do?”
He goes to the department store again after work. He finds a tight, dark green shirt with three-quarter length sleeves, and a pair of skinny jeans. Just to be nice. Not because Malfoy would look good in them.
“I’m not kissing Malfoy,” Potter replies through gritted teeth.
Harry gnaws on his bottom lip. “No one did, fairly sure. Few people do. It’s not a big deal.”
,” Draco replies, scowling. “You’ll ruin my reputation.”
He expects to see Margaret, his elderly next-door neighbor. She’s over almost every night asking him to grab something from her high shelves, or to find her cat where it’s hidden under her bed. He swears that woman is nocturnal.
Gertrude sounds incensed.
“You should be! You obviously enjoy working with them. That’s the perfect next step for you.”
Harry knows for a fact that eighth year is going to be absolutely dreadful.
“That, you’re not.” Hermione raises her wine glass towards him and takes a sip.
“Fine. I’ll see you in six hours.”
Monday feels as long as ever, and Harry’s glad it’s finally over. They’re sitting at the bar that night with Padma when Malfoy comes over – the first time Harry’s seen him here.
Harry had originally considered bringing up the subject to Hermione, since she’d mentioned reading books about it, but ultimately got nervous.
“Sorry, I just-”
“Damn, Harry, since when are
what happens to me. This is for my
at Neville, and before he can react, Vince is announcing that the groups have to wrap up, the social is over.
, Potter, you need a shower.”
“I didn’t know if you were doing that with anyone else or just me,” Draco explains. “I should have asked you. But I figured I’d better be safe, so I only used ‘he.’ In case you didn’t want Patil to know.”
, Betsy had said, and Harry couldn’t help but chuckle.
“I mean, I just gave the extra money to Dave,” Harry says. “It’s not like I need the money either.”
It's weird at first, but eventually they seem to collectively give in to the awkwardness, and by the time they're waiting for the next activity, there's actual inter-house conversations. Harry notices that Malfoy isn’t talking to anyone, barely even to his fellow Slytherins. It seems like he’s even taken a break from harassing Harry, at least for the night. They do a miniature obstacle course, they sort themselves by height and birth date, and finally Vince is giving instructions for the final activity.
Harry nods politely, turning back to his speech. It’ll be time soon. Malfoy leans next to Harry’s ear, breath hot against his neck. “See you around, Potter.” And then Malfoy’s headed back to his table, and it’s time for the speech.
. You wouldn’t shut up about him, even when we were in the middle of forests and on the run. You
Harry’s jaw dropped open. He turned to look at Malfoy again, whose face was still. But Malfoy’s eyes were pleading with Harry. Eyes that once stared into a bathroom mirror, devoid of hope; eyes that had begged Harry to save him as a fiery inferno raged around them; eyes that now shone with desperation for Harry to go along with this.
“Let me get this straight. You stalked him, for an
“That was highly inappropriate,” Draco drawled.
“Move over.” Harry pulled the comforter down and jumped in next to Malfoy, bumping against him as he quickly set his blankets on top and smoothed them out. Malfoy looked disheveled and exhausted, hair mussed and bags under his eyes. Still, he was wearing silk pyjamas, and Harry somehow felt underdressed in his own snitch-patterned ones.
“No, she’s not Transfigured,” Malfoy replies. “She’s just that small. Eleanor, say hello to Harry.”
Harry immediately wiped out, taking Malfoy down with him. “Oh my god, why are you wet—” Harry jumped back up, grabbing for his clothes to cover himself.
“Aw, that’s so sweet,” Luna crowed. “You two hated each other so much back in school! How did you ever get past all of that?”
Last week, a team had finished up a case on a string of burglaries in Diagon Alley. The paperwork was straightforward enough, and Harry had nearly finished with it when Matian Gilbertson walked into the conference room.
But maybe he’s just doing this for attention. Maybe it’s not real at all, and he’s just a man, and he’s overthinking things because Padma seems so happy, and he wants to be too. Harry wonders if he’d be thinking all this if he were even a little bit able to let things go.
“I think that’s good for today,” Harry says, voice rough. “She’s fascinating.”
“Yes they do, Harry dear! Now go ahead, tell the story!” Molly beamed.
“Gossip with the snakes, is more accurate. They rant about their annoying owners. I rant about their annoying owners. Not that they’re really all annoying, but snakes do like complaining, so it’s rather enjoyable for them, I think. Especially if they’re the only snake living somewhere.”
“They got stung, of course,” Ron replies, grabbing another scoop of potatoes. “Everyone was fine, they had a Healer with them as a local guide, but Charlie says it hurt like a bitch.”
Draco’s frozen next to them. “You… you’re attracted to men?”
It seemed like… some part of him had been waiting for this. Since that first ill-fated meeting in Madame Malkins all those years ago, Harry had been intrigued by the mean, judgemental boy, and a bit of his mind had maybe known even then that Malfoy was capable of learning, and growing, and changing.
Harry feels his cheeks getting redder, but Draco’s not going to let it go. “You remember Oliver Wood? He was a few years above us at school?”
“You didn’t consider adopting
Harry grabs the light from his wall and briefly shines it in Gertrude’s eyes. Her spectacles, the covering over the corneas, look normal. He checks her glottis, nostrils, and back muscles. He runs his hands down her underside, checking for any lumps and making sure her vent is clear.
. About not being confined by the label of a gender. About falling entirely outside of the binary. It feels…
“Coming to terms with liking blokes. It should have been obvious, I think I was half in love with Cedric Diggory back then, but how could I have known? It’s not like there were any queer people out at Hogwarts to look up to.”
“No, I hadn’t seen her again until Friday. But I Owled her a thank you note after I finished reading them.”
“Rather presumptuous, inviting yourself over, isn’t it?”
“I thought you wanted to stay out of our baggage?” Harry says with a teasing smile.
“Thanks,” Harry replied, trying not to focus on Draco’s thighs against his. He could barely hear the shouts of the other aurors over the ringing in his ears. Oh, god. Draco’s shirt was half buttoned, exposing the tattoos on his chest.
“He had a
are, doing exactly that.”
And Draco gets his emotional shields up, ready for whatever torment Potter has in store.
Draco tried not to let the guilt show on his face. “That’s very kind of you to say.”
Draco was trying to be as quiet as possible, not wanting to disturb anyone. But as he neared the kitchen, he heard hushed voices arguing inside.
“To talk to Gilbertson, tell him the engagement was a lie. Something about me deserving better?”
“Good afternoon,” Malfoy replies formally. “One of my snakes is having some issues.”
Dave nods, still looking horrified. “Okay, Dr. Potter,” he says, leaving and closing the door behind him.
, but didn’t you say I hadn’t seen all your snakes? I don’t remember meeting any new ones after that.”
Malfoy gestures for Harry to go first. “Why are you a teacher?”
Draco is shocked into silence for a moment. Harry Potter. Confiding in him. In the absolute dead of the night. “What was your nightmare about?” he tries to keep his voice steady.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says, looking softly at Harry. And he looks so beautiful in that moment that Harry has another terrible epiphany that they maybe should have had earlier: they want to kiss Draco Malfoy.
“Yes, unfortunately.”
“Why?”
“Could we perhaps continue this tonight? Over dinner? And I’ve been wanting to meet all of your snakes, too-”
that it’s something I would never
Harry grinned back. “I’m serious. So, are you in? Will you marry me?”
“Yeah, you’re right,” Harry smiles. “And it’s all thanks to you, and Gertrude, and all the Noods, really, otherwise I never would have even known I was interested.”
“Dare,” he says. No way he’s answering any questions for the Gryffindors about the Death Eaters. Or the war. Or, really, anything.
getting married.” He grabbed Harry’s hand, and they stepped out of the office together.
Harry turns to Bertha.
“Because McGonagall asked me to.” Malfoy’s smirk is… almost a genuine smile. Harry grins back.
“And your friends and family can confirm that you and Mr Malfoy are together?”
Harry stepped slowly up next to Malfoy, standing shoulder to shoulder with him. “It really is beautiful,” Harry yelled over the engine.
, I think he’s leaving,
Dave’s eyes are wide. “Why are you giving me this?” He tries to hand it back.
,” Draco incants, healing Potter’s clearly broken nose. He screws open the lid on the salve, dipping his fingers in and rubbing them softly against the bruises on Potter’s face. “What happened?”
* * *
When Draco found Potter after the trial, he punched him in the face.
“Great,” Harry said. “Now, go to sleep.”
“So, Harry, anything new at work?” Hermione asks once they’re sitting down. Harry finishes his mouthful of peas before answering.
Harry calls Malfoy to the back and takes him into Exam Room C (
“Oh, how’s Padma?” Hermione asks. “I heard she’s teaching Transfiguration, is that right?”
Padma chuckles. “She’s certainly stronger than I am. I fell asleep halfway through this afternoon.”
“Well spotted,” Malfoy replies, cheeks tinging pink. “I was hoping you’d be willing to help her.”
, Harry begins in Parseltongue. Malfoy makes a startled noise. “Sorry,” Harry says in English. “Is this okay? I find it works to calm them down as I do the examination.”
“Don’t pay me for this one, please, I should pay you for letting me study him,” Harry tells Draco as he’s leaving. Draco just rolls his eyes and gives Dave a stack of money, telling him to keep the change. Harry wants to argue more, but he knows he won’t win.
“Got a lot of experience in that realm, have you?” Padma winks at him.
Draco looks up at him and bites his lip. “I may or may not have gotten… a bit
, and they know it does great work for orphans, but Harry can’t help but hate the name regardless.
Harry gets to pick the place this time, but he doesn’t really have any idea where to go, so he chooses the cafe they went to the first time.
Potter’s brows furrow. “Of course you have a choice.”
In, out. In, out. Potter surely does not want to talk about his deaths with someone who supported his murderer.
“You like rooming with me?”
The conversation flows as they talk about the new Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes products, and Harry tries to hold in a cringe every time Ron calls Harry ‘he.’ By the end of the night, Hermione’s giving Harry a puzzled look, but she just kisses them on the cheek and wishes them a good night.
Harry looked incredulously at Malfoy, who raised his eyebrows in challenge.
“Okay,” says Anthony Goldstein. “I dare you to kiss Malfoy.”
“Yes,” he says instead.
“Wait, I wanted to ask about that too. Why’d you leave Hogwarts? The Prophet said you were fired.” He snorts. Harry does not.
Draco narrows his eyes. “What did?”
“Alright,” Harry says, mind already racing to connections between mamba anatomy and the latent magical properties of stinging hexes. “And what’s been going on with Gertrude?”
"This should be fun," says Parkinson. "Granger, how about you go first?"
Draco stops and turns to Harry once they reach the Apparition point. His grey eyes are so sharp, and Harry leans in. Kisses him.
Harry swallows.
“Yes, got it.” Draco supposed it was too much to ask to have no one know it was fake.
Draco looks surprised. “Yes, I suppose I did.”
Draco gives his answer by leaning in. And if Harry had thought his lips were soft before, this time, they’re heaven, moving against their own. Harry grabs Draco’s hips and pulls him in, needing the warmth of his body.
Draco heard Potter let out a sigh, his warm breath brushing lightly against his neck, that amazing hand pulling away from his hard cock.
Potter." He snarled, trying to sound vicious as he moved away from the wall. Before Draco could even react, a hand grabbed onto his arm and was roughly shoved back against the wall, his arms pinned against the wall as he felt the air rush out of his lungs. "What the fuck, Potter! Get your hands off of me!" A deep chuckle greeted his ears, causing him to shiver at the sound he could practically feel with their chests pressed together. Merlin, does he look so fucking good. No, it must be the intoxicating musky cologne influencing his mind. Yes, that must be it. "Don't act all coy now, Malfoy. I know you enjoyed it." Before the blonde could say anything, he was roughly turned around, his back pressed against the hard muscular body and his arms pinned against his side by equally strong arms wrapped around him.
Without saying another word, Draco charged forward, grabbing the other's hand and pulled him into the room. The door swung closed with a muffled bang as Draco shoved Potter back into the wall with all his might before he slammed his lips against the other's lips for a rough kiss. Potter immediately kissed the blonde back just as rough, seemingly not thrown off by the blondes action as their position switched, this time the brunette slammed the blonde back against the wall as he made Draco's legs wrap around his waist, hoisting him up against the wall as the blonde wrapped his arms around his neck. Lips and teeth clashed against each other as Potter ground his hips against Draco's, each movement rough with need as Draco groaned against his lips, feeling the other take his breath away.
will not be asking any of the male Death Eater to help him.
Draco jolted from his sleep covered in sweat and an uncomfortable hard-on. God damn it. This was the tenth time this week that he has woken up just as the dream Potter was about to put his thick cock in his ass. Draco rolled onto his stomach and groaned into his satin covered pillow. The lustful dreams were getting worse since that encounter with the other. It doesn't help that the Dark Lord, Potter, and the Death Eaters in Voldemort's inner circle now lived together in a fortress-like mansion. Why? Who knows what goes on inside his head. No one seemed to mind. Draco let out another groan as he climbed out of his bed. He never seemed to go back to sleep after these kinds of dreams. He trudged out of his room in just his pajama pants into the dark quarters of the mansion.
A hooded figure hissed softly.
its a little hard
me for a second." Potter practically purred as he slowly brought the blonde's wrist to his lips.
Oh, who is he kidding? The person in front of him is a
"Damn snake," Draco mumbled out loud, scowling as Potter stepped away from him, immediately missing the extra body heat. The other heard and smirked before turning around to walk to the large form of Nagini. "Our business isn't don't yet, Malfoy. If you're feeling a little...heated, you know where to find me. See you at the meeting. " He said as he slowly disappeared down the corridor with the large snake slithering behind him. All was silent before Draco mumbled a curse as he leaned his back against the wall. What was he going to do with this raging hard-on? He couldn't possibly ask any of the girls to help him since they all were in the Death Eater meeting and he most
well why I'm here." Potter looked over at the blonde, an eyebrow raised before he snapped his fingers together, suddenly causing his shirt to be already buttoned and tucked nicely around his waist, sighing as he moved to stand in front of his desk. "No, I don't, Malfoy. I don't feel like reading your mind, so I suggest you get on with it."
The brunette's aloof expression annoyed Draco, his eyebrows knitted together as he tried to control the anger that suddenly wheeling in his body. "Don't give me that, Potter." He said venomously, his fists clenched by his side. "You know
Before the blonde could react, Potter had grabbed onto his wrist, surprisingly not tight. "Come now, Malfoy.
Harry mumbled, still keeping his eyes on Draco. The Dark Lord had to pause for a second before making a remark.
He thought and started making his way over to the said room which was on the second floor of the mansion.
"Damn bastard." Draco cursed midbreath as he stormed through the empty, poorly lit corridor limestone covered corridors. Who the hell does he think he is? Just because he is the grandson of the Dark Lord, doesn't mean he gets to give orders. Malfoys don't take orders from Harry Potter. "Are you sure about that, Draco? You seem quite eager to follow them just a moment ago." A male voice said from the direction towards a pitch dark corner of the corridor that the flickering lit torches couldn't touch. The voice was unexpected, it caused Draco to nearly jump out of his skin. A deep chuckle could be heard and the blonde quickly composed himself and sneered at the corner. "Reveal yourself. I don't like being made fun of especially by someone who isn't man enough to show me their face."
Draco panicked to himself, wanting to rip his arm from Potter's hand. To the blonde's horror, Potter pressed his lips to the inside of his wrist, his emerald eyes dared him to move his arm away as their eyes met once again. Draco felt his heart race in his chest, his breathing slightly labored as he watched that tongue he imagined some many times in his dreams, peeked out and licked his alabaster skin, leaving a trail of tingling sensations on that spot.
Draco did his best to make himself as imposing as possible to hide the fact he looked like a cornered animal. "I don't need your
He recognized a painting of the founder of the House of Slytherin in Hogwarts, Salazar Slytherin mounted on the wall. That means he was on the west side of the mansion...oh crap. He had stopped in front of
making love? You practically abused your power and forced me to!" Draco hissed before he was suddenly pulled for a crushing kiss and it quickly ended as soon as it started. "Forced? Remember, you were the one who
Draco looked like an idiot just standing there with his mouth hanging slightly open but he quickly composed himself to an appearance befitting a Malfoy, a sneer on his face. "I should have known it was you, Potter. You always did have a knack for hiding in the shadows." Harry laughed lowly, causing Draco to shiver at the sound. Why is he making him feel like this?
join us, Harry." Lord Voldemort said in a soft voice, his red eyes looking closely at his grandson. Harry didn't look the slightest bit apologetic as he walked over to the head of the oval-shaped table. "My apologies, Grandfather." Lucius looked towards the door, noticing that his son wasn't coming in. "Where is my son, young Master?" The older blonde inquired towards Harry, who had taken the position in the chair next to Lord Voldemort. Harry smirked, making some at the table uncomfortable, thinking that he did something to the Malfoy heir. "Oh, he had to take care of something. He'll be coming shortly."
He thought as he got closer, noticing there were others sound too. Soft moans, sounds of rustling and slightly heavy breathing. Draco grew more curious as he finally made it to the door, the sounds getting louder.
"You know why I can't stand on the side. I thought I made myself pretty clear the last time we made love." Potter said in a low voice as if he only wanted Draco to hear those words. The blonde flushed and grabbed the brunette's arm, trying to get that hand to let go. "You call
Draco pulled away from those lips, his head threw back as he let out a pained cry as Potter buried his face in the blonde's neck, groaning curses at how tight he was as he started thrusting, rolling his hips as he felt those tight walls loosen slowly. "Merlin, y-you're so fucking tight..." Draco soon started moaning once again as their body started rocking together, his fingers started pulling on those dark locks, making Potter groaned heatedly against his neck. Sweat started forming on their skin as the pleasure quickly shot up in the room as the soft sounds of their skin slapping together filled the room. Draco let out another cry as the other finally found his special spot, making his vision turn temporarily white, his back arched against the mattress which urged Potter to start ramming into that spot.
Instead of being mad, like Draco expected him to be, Potter smirked, a hidden amusement in his eyes when he noticed the blonde was turned on by what they were doing. Draco gulped nervously, suddenly not liking the way those green eyes seemed to dare him to keep watching to the end. He wanted to turn around to leave this area, to forget what he saw but his body seemed to rebel against him. Potter seemed to find it amusing to see him struggle behind that cobalt eyes as he moved one of his hand that was on Daphne's mid back to grab onto the soft long blonde locks. Daphne let out a sinful cry as her head got yanked back, a thin layer of sweat already formed on her skin, seemingly still not noticing that Draco was standing there.
*~*~*~*:*~*~*~*
Draco wanted to tear his eyes away from the erotic sight but he couldn't seem to look away. Something about how the light cast amazing shadows on Potter's defined muscles...oh how he wanted to run his own hands over them. Numerous nights were interrupted with such toxic dreams ever since that encounter in the corridor that faithful night, each one always leaving him with cum-soiled boxers and an unquenched thirst for pleasure. The thing is though, the blonde didn't want to admit he was having such dreams about a certain green-eyed male. He couldn't. Why?
His inner mind screamed out at him. Draco rolled his eyes. He didn't need to be told twice.
"Don't tease me you fucker!" Draco growled out from frustration. The blonde heard Potter snicker against his neck. He gasped as two fingers breached his ass, the pain shooting up his body as he groaned, his fingers gripping Potter's hair tightly, the lustful kiss trailing from his neck to his collarbone distracting him somewhat from the pain. Draco quickly moaned he felt Potter started moving his fingers in a scissoring motion, his head tilt back against the pillow as he subconsciously pressed the other more against his body. Those lips left trails of fire down to his chest as the blonde writhed under him in pleasure, moans turned to soft cries as those skillful fingers thrust into that magic spot that made him see stars at the first try, his back arched against the soft bed sheets.
Harry sat next to his grandfather in the grand chair, his captivating emerald eyes slowly scanned over the attending Death Eaters. He had no love for any of them. They were all just disposable minions to him, ready to just kill off if need be. His eyes stopped on a blond hair male around his age. He was a spitting image of his father, Lucius but more stunning. He had a strong looking physique yet petite looking with smooth alabaster skin. Pale, smooth skin that he would love to run his hands over, mark it and watch it flush red by his doing. His tongue peeked out slightly and licked the corner of his lips.
"Come in." Draco heard a deep voice call out from inside of the room and opened the door, stepping in to see a house-elf standing on top of an armchair next to a shirtless Potter who was resting against the large maple desk, tending to his arm which was wrapped in bandages. Potter looked over at the blonde, his emerald eyes briefly observed him before a sigh left his lips. "Enough Dobby. Leave." He said in a soft voice. The house elf quickly stopped what it was doing and with a deep bow, the house elf disappeared with a loud crack. "What do you want Malfoy?" Potter drawled as he moved his ass from the desk, walking around to take his crisp white shirt that had been neatly laid on the back of his chair by the house elf and carefully put it on. The blonde couldn't miss the slight wince that handsome face made when the movement caused his injury to twinge in pain.
Draco thought, actually taking time to think rather than roaming around the mansion trying to find someone who has a knack for hiding ever since he was born.
Harry chuckled, the sound causing his fascination to look over at him from across the table. No one has ever heard the grandson of the Dark Lord laugh.
" Draco said in a scathing voice, keeping an eye on the other as he came to a stop several feet from the blonde. "And for your information, I wasn't
"Are you sure you want people to see that, Malfoy? Perhaps I can help you with that." Draco's eyes widened for a second as he quickly turned around to face the other male, noticing the same annoying smirk on that annoyingly handsome face. "What the fuck are you playing at, Potter? Are you brain dead or something? I told you I don't like being made fun of." Draco snarled, his hands balled up into fists as if he was getting ready for an attack. Harry found all of this pretty amusing, a deep chuckle left his lips as he made a step towards the blonde, who also took a step back. "Yes, I remember you saying that. I'm not playing any games, Malfoy. If I start something, I must be the one to finish it." He said, making more steps towards the blonde, who in turn took the same amount of steps back until his back was pressed against the wall
Black and silvery hair matted with sweat as they both felt they were nearing their climax. "F-Fuck I'm so c-close!" Draco cried out, feeling the tightness in his belly was about to go undone any second. The blonde let out a hiss as the other grabbed his hair and forced his head to tilt his side, exposing his smooth neck. He let out a pleasured cry as he felt a set of teeth bite down on his flesh so hard that it broke through the skin, the hard thrusts quickly washed away the pain as that sent him over the edge. They each yelled each other's name, their release rushed through their body as their heavy breathing blended together. Draco reveled in the amazing ecstasy as he felt a warm tongue lap up the oozing blood from his bite mark. "Y-You fucker, that's going to leave a mark." He said in a tired voice, his hand reached over his shoulder to lightly slap Potter on the back of the shoulder. The brunette chuckled, sending another wave of pleasure through Draco at the pleasant sound.
There was utter silence until there was a sound like someone scoffed. "Very well." Draco's eyes widened as he back up a few steps when the person he was referring to earlier stepped out of the dark corner, a cocky smirk on his face and his emerald eyes shaded with a hint of darkness, portraying his personality. Let's not forget the fact that the first two buttons on his crisp white dress shirt were open, showing glimpses of his defined chest that seemed more muscular from the shadows.
Lord Voldemort looked over to see his grandson had his attention on something else.
came back to me, my celestial dragon." Potter purred into his ear. "And I always say the same thing everytime we finish. 'I love you, my Draco.'"
“Who will, Harry?”
He worries it’s too much. He worries it’s not enough. He worries, once he spots it in on his window sill, that Potter’s tawny will bite his finger off and he’ll be forced to combine his new robes with some distinctly down-market bandages, which is as close as he’ll come to conceding that he’s terrified of what the owl is carrying.
“That’s not necessary. But three to five times per day each, whenever you’re feeling up to it. You can do one spell at a time or cycle through them, either way.”
“I think the word you’re looking for is ‘correct.’”
“Right.” Potter nodded.
The hours he spent with Shacklebolt were some of the longest of my adult life.
“Depends on the bird. Polka dots, argyle. One tends towards pinstripes.”
That seemed to spur Potter to action. Draco felt Potter’s hands pulling him upwards, bringing him close. Potter rolled them over and pinned them to the ground, and Draco bit at his shoulder just to keep from moaning. It was incredible. Potter was incredible. Rough and firm and exactly right.
“Yeah,” Potter laughed wildly. “I did, and I was willing to. I was willing to die for this world. Not lead a vigilante mob to try and save my own arse.”
“I’m really not.”
“The politic thing?” Harry repeats Draco’s words, wishing again, and rather fiercely, that he spoke Slytherin.
. The twin, standing next to her, answered that he’d dealt with quite a few burns in his line of work, and all was well. No one else stepped forward to report an accident.
“Men?”
“Of course, on both counts.” He massaged his temples a moment before he forced himself to look up. “I still can’t tell you why he’s here, and his leaving is not an option. But he only comes out of the void when we’re working together. I’ll have Lobsey or Galder let you know when we begin and end, if you’d like to go elsewhere or keep your wand at hand.”
“Yes.”
“You’re welcome.” He returned the nod, watched as she bid Millie, Blaise, and Greg goodnight and left the room, giving the door only marginally gentler treatment than Potter had.
“No, we left all the carnivorous furniture with Walburga in the old Black residence. Besides which”—he cut off Potter’s riposte—“the Statute of Secrecy is rather a concern, what with all the Muggles about.”
He studied her. Perhaps a bit too obviously.
Draco didn’t object. Particularly as those coarse fingers guided his half-hard cock towards Potter’s mouth.
“Yeah.”
Which is how he’d justified staying up till half two on a Tuesday night with his face buried in Harry’s arse, and then Harry’s cock buried in his.
It took Draco a long, focused moment to repress a relieved, victorious whoop.
“Did you want a monthly reaffirmation?”
Harry’s half-grateful he’s been out long enough for the sun to have started setting; he’s not sure he could manage anything much brighter. But he finds he wants to manage. Wants to remember this odd, out of place expression on Draco’s face.
“Buckbeak.” Potter’s breath was quick and shallow, his chest rising and falling rapidly. “You knew that before that class, with Hagrid and Buckbeak.”
“Thank you for being willing to see it.”
The sun climbed higher in the sky and glinted off the pavement, picking up a shimmer that was usually invisible. But it was still London, late in the year; Draco didn’t think it was the sun warming him.
When he did—when he found a way to move, when he struck up a rhythm, when he kept it as firm and strong as Potter liked, when he found himself thrusting even just a bit harder than he’d meant to, thanks to the exquisite heat of Potter’s body—Potter’s first deep moan almost threw him over the edge. He had to make it last. Usually, that meant distraction, but he couldn’t stand to look away.
He almost pulls back at the feeling of it. It’s so much. So much more than he’s felt in so long, and if this is a fingertip he’s not sure how he’ll withstand being inside of Harry.
“Yeah,” Draco repeats. “Just, it’s a lot.”
Potter shifted. “It’s the 3rd.”
“Will you think on it? Perhaps Hermione and Ron might be able to offer useful insight, knowing you as well as they do.”
“Better than him thinking you’re up to a potions ring or something.”
“You could cast a warming charm.”
He grips Potter’s buckle and pulls, lifting his waistband away, having a first look at the soft skin below Potter’s jeans.
Draco took a seat in the chair nearest Harry. “Are you certain?”
Ten minutes later, he’s still staring at the page.
“Daily diagnostics, magical exposure, interviews and examinations, extensive research, and frequent consultation with Ms Granger and Ms Bulstrode.”
“Oh, uh, I don’t know. They haven’t sent out invitations yet, have they?”
“This nowhere you’re going. Why don’t you take me with you?”
like you too.”
“I’ve rather a different sort of game in mind.”
He stepped closer, so his front was pressed to Potter’s back, and slipped a hand under the thin cotton of his t-shirt.
Suddenly too jittery to sleep, Draco threw back the covers and began to pace.
Malfoy clenched his forearms, fine blond hair and pale skin rippling over tightened muscles, and Harry felt his breath catch. Draco Malfoy was quite attractive. He hadn’t considered that in all of this. And even if he’d been a bastard about it, Malfoy was right that it had been a while.
His gaze was full of fire when it met mine, his skin flushed from the steam. “Do you know how loud this is?”
Yet while it occurs to him to know, it doesn’t occur to him to use it. He just grinned at the admission and said we’d better do thinks that don’t involve talking, then.
Which he didn’t usually do. Ever—too many years of constant vigilance—and especially at this point in the evening, after the smiling and the small talk. After the public show. When Malfoy extended his long fingers for the cheque, and made a show of balancing the quill between his fingertips and moving it across the slip of paper.
They reappeared in a tiny garden. Harry didn’t make any move to step away from Draco, but Draco saw him look up at the thin stone building in something between shock and confusion. For all that it looked sedate, music pounded through the masonry and the grass under their feet.
Draco releases Potter’s neck with a slick pop. He’s gasping for air, but that’s fine when Potter is too, when Potter’s pupils have cancelled out all that green and there’s a bruise coming in on his neck that Draco put there, that Potter loved having him put there. The air between them is electric, heavy, warm. He hums and moves in again.
“Hard.”
Draco took a breath and leaned into the embankment, using the rough stone at his elbow to anchor his nerves. “Is that something you have to do from London?”
“Too curious for your own good,” Draco mumbles, before he thinks better of it.
Draco wasn’t sure if it was the ongoing rush of blood southward or the sight of Potter, eyes wide and lips stretched around his dick that left him faint. Whichever it was, he almost had to grab his desk again for support.
Draco is so numb with anticipation that he barely notices the tawny’s reproachful stare, barely feels his stomach sink at Potter’s implication that this must be part of some scheme.
The quiet was becoming oppressive. Draco needed to break it. “Why did you come back here?”
Draco does not hesitate before Apparating to Grimmauld Place. He does not pace in front of Number 12 before stepping through the wards. He does not hesitate on the landing before he knocks. He does not find himself at a bit of a loss for words when Potter opens the door. If his throat constricts, it’s just because it’s fucking freezing and really, someone as powerful as Potter ought to be able to spare a warming charm.
Even more unfortunately, as soon as it was out I knew it wasn’t wholly untrue. There’s something about his presence that’s bizarrely relaxing. It’s as though he knows so much already that there’s no point in lying to him, and he’s not nearly as preoccupied with his own perfection as the papers would suggest. Seems to relish dirtying the pristine image, surprisingly enough, rather than trying to hold it over anyone.
, that he should be so chilly after that, when he was so warm – his breath, the skin of his neck in Harry’s hand, his mouth against Harry’s, and his chest, and his hands gripping Harry’s shoulders.
“A mover,” she repeated. “A Muggle mover. When they get a new house he goes and moves their things from one to the other.”
Potter is still out there somewhere, fumbling his way through doilies and serviettes, and it doesn’t matter. Draco has a job to do. A job that’s important, that makes sense. There are
“Distracted.”
“Just a house,” again, as he climbed the broad stone stairs to the front door.
“Not quite the same, but let’s try it. I’ll have Lobsey bring them to you with dinner. See that you read them this evening.”
Draco looked to his bedroom door, weighing the benefits and disadvantages of going in and interrupting Potter. So far it had been the only space that was uniquely Potter’s, and Draco was, for reasons he couldn’t quite place, not inclined to change that.
Potter scratches at the edge of a drawer.
The grey, stone foyer of Malfoy Manor was almost entirely bare save a tapestry, an enormous crystal chandelier, and the set of fireplace tools that Harry unceremoniously knocked over whilst trying to extricate himself from the Floo.
Draco’s stomach twisted as it sank. This was why they’d brought him here, then. It wasn’t a mission. It was an interrogation.
“You didn’t say ‘suck my cock,’ you said ‘suck me.’ We’ve already making progress.”
Harry hasn’t kissed a lot of people but he knows he shouldn’t have liked that one. It was angry. It was mean. It wasn’t the kind of kiss he likes. He liked kissing Ginny. Loved it. She smelled like perfume and tasted like cinnamon and had full lips and she was gentle and soft and he could kiss her for a long time, very happily. And he’d tossed one or two off to the thought of her as well. So, there. Kissing Malfoy was wrong. The wrong person and the wrong kind of kissing and not what he wants, and that's all there is to it.
“You don’t get extra points for admitting it.”
Draco tucked his prick away and hastened to do up his flies and all of his buttons. He might be a bit mussed, but there was no need to wander around with his dick looking like a bespoke bloody elephant.
It landed in a pile, closely followed by Malfoy’s top and trousers and, with Malfoy’s encouragement, Harry’s jeans and trainers.
Draco woke one day in mid-April to find that the sun was already up, and he was beginning to sweat under two down quilts. One his way to work, he noticed that daffodil leaves had pushed through the earth, and a few buds were beginning to swell.
Draco wrinkled his nose. “I would’ve been perfectly happy going another decade without thinking about that.”
Draco inhales sharply and moves down Harry’s body
* * *
"The importance of knowing the motives of one's...." Harry trailed off. He quirked an eyebrow and let himself extend a single finger just far enough to brush it over the fine, smooth wool of Malfoy's trousers.
“You don’t even know that. Maybe I won’t become a Squib. I might be fine. You might be totally wrong. Wouldn’t be the first time!”
With a nervous shift, Potter looks towards him. Avoiding his eyes, Draco notes. Interesting.
“No, Dr Malfoy. Publicly sharing the details of the case would put the lives of high-ranking Ministry officials at risk and create panic in the wizarding world. Unfortunately, you may not be able to fully grasp the gravity of the situation, or the importance of the project, without letting Ms Granger explain the specifics. I’m afraid we need to ask you to make an Unbreakable Vow.”
There’s no response. Is Harry making a face? What kind of a face? What is the portrait doing? Draco wants so badly to look, but there’s no way he’s willing to cut this conversation short or risk discovery.
He tears his gaze away from Potter’s. Clears his throat. “I’m sorry to hear that.” He turns to the shelf and picks up the next knife. “One bread knife, full tang –”
Potter hadn’t looked up, and didn’t then. Though if he had, he would have seen one side of a Beech tree drop its remaining leaves.
“Great, then. Does it matter when I go?”
But I find that what I really want is a new journal. It has been an eventful half-year, but it’s well past time to pursue events of a different sort. A life of a different sort. Turn over a new page, as it were.
“As a Bludger to the head.”
“If the purpose was to increase your raw power, yes. But I’m given to understand that that’s not what you want.”
Harry keeps thinking about the money. It had to be at least a thousand pounds, cash. Dave’s expression was brilliant. And Draco- because giving Harry’s assistant an obscene amount of money for no other reason than that Harry had been doing it had definitely made him Draco now- had let him examine the magical properties of his snake. Harry wants to send a thank you.
