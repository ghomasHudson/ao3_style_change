“Well in that case, there’s no need for the sunset; despite those awful glasses, you’re quite the lovely image on your own.”
“I’m not sure we’ve cut down their forces enough for that,” Hermione replied. “They did take some heavy losses, but they’ve still got quite the advantage.”
you faced down old Snakester.”
“I never thought I’d see the day where I’d like the idea of being the equal mate of Harry Potter,” Malfoy chuckled. “So, do you want me to give you a proper bite now, or shall we be horribly scandalous and do it in front of the whole school?”
“It’s not supposed to be sensible, it’s supposed to be a lovely image,” Veronica retorted.
“He’s fine, last we saw him,” Ron informed her. Veronica heaved a sigh of relief.
“It’s not as much of a concern, no, but ruts are,” Malfoy said.
“I thought you might say that,” Draco replied with a small wet laugh. “I promise I won’t.”
“No Draco, it doesn’t,” Harry admitted, smiling and shaking his head. “At the beginning of term, it would have, but now… I think I’d rather like it, being properly bonded to you. Maybe even mated, someday.”
It didn’t help that Harry had a low threshold for his heats, which meant everyone knew he underwent a monthly cycle. Luckily for him, thus far everyone had assumed he was an alpha. In fact, most people seemed to assume that even before he presented. But sooner or later, the truth would come out, and when that time came, Harry wanted to be prepared. Which meant allowing someone to claim him.
“I don’t believe it,” the Slytherin insisted.
“But of course not,” Malfoy snorted. “You’re Harry Potter, after all, the boldest Gryffindor to ever Gryffindor. Honestly, I’ll consider myself lucky if you don’t end up trying to dominate me instead.”
“I was gonna say mates, but… what do you mean, we’re bonded? You just claimed me, you never broke skin or anything.”
“I know that,” Veronica said tiredly, mustering up every last ounce of patience she had left. “I’m just wondering why it’s hovering in front of me. I don’t need it.”
“Right then,” Veronica said. “If you want some joke products for defense, make sure you see Fred and George before heading out. Otherwise, let’s go. Though, um, could someone come to Ravenclaw Tower with me to see that bust?” Luna nodded graciously, and Veronica sighed with relief. “Thanks, Luna. Okay, anyway, um, please be careful, guys. I don’t want anyone getting hurt if it can be avoided. Also try not to attract too much attention, I reckon if the Carrows notice something’s up, that’ll bring V- our enemies down on us in a trice. And uh, erm, anyway, thanks for your help everyone. And like I said, stay safe.”
“It’s true,” Harry piped up quickly. “I have his claim mark. It’s just glamoured.”
Actually, kissing Malfoy didn’t seem like such a bad idea, and not just because of the situation.
“We will,” Neville promised, and as the majority of the students began to file out, Veronica could only hope that his promise would be kept by all of them.
“In the meantime, let’s start distributing Malfoy’s luck potion,” Neville said. “We can give out about half of it now, and then the rest when the Order arrives. Don’t take it right away, just keep it on hand in case things go bad. And keep your coins about you, so we can make sure any information gets spread about properly.”
“Nothing as crass as that,” Malfoy practically snarled. “What makes things difficult for an alpha me is that scents bear stronger associations than normal, particularly during a rut; as such, having a scent to ground us is the best thing for a rut, save knotting a mate. In other words, during a rut, it is nearly impossible to bear the scents around me, and it makes it bloody difficult trying to get off when, at any second, you might get a whiff of someone’s unwashed socks or a third-year’s cheap perfume. I just want something that smells like someone I’ve claimed, as I will be most sensitive to that odor. It should block out all the other scents, and help speed things along, as it were.”
“Good,” Veronica stated. She glanced at her watch, and saw that time was beginning to run low. “I’d better get going. I-” She wasn’t sure what she was trying to say. How could she possibly begin to convey everything she was feeling, everything Draco meant to her, all the gratitude she’d built towards him, all the love? “Thanks, I guess,” she settled on, kicking herself for how not-smooth that was. “For being my best friend. And for coming to say goodbye, and- just thanks. And goodbye.”
“Um, okay then. I guess first thing, Ravenclaws- er, Luna, I suppose- can you tell us what the diadem looks like so we can search for it?”
All in all, it was a complicated process that was far more trouble than it was worth- not to mention the morality and safety of it was frequently questioned- and would have been done away with years before were it not for the fact that it was so popular with the students. One headmaster had indeed tried to abolish the practice, only for the students to band together and hold small parties of their own. So despite the claims that it was essentially sanctioning underage sex or ruining bloodlines since some pureblood students found themselves unexpectedly in a bond with a halfblood or worse, the practice persisted.
“We should also ask the professors of course,” Hermione chipped in, reluctantly getting dragged into their pace as always. “Not only would they have knowledge on the school’s enchantments, but they are powerful wizards and witches, not to mention being something of experts in their own fields.”
“Merlin, your hair’s even worse when it’s short,” he teased. “Good morning, love.”
“Okay, but I survived, didn’t I?” Veronica asked, even though she could tell it was a losing battle.
“You’re not seriously trusting him, are you?” Ron asked. “Malfoy lies as easily as he breathes. He’s a Slytherin! It’s what they do. He’ll probably stab you in the back right when you least expect it.”
“I- I figured I should let you see the memories before I said anything,” Draco continued, a slight tremor in his voice. “That, and, well, I didn’t really want to say what I had to say in front of Ron and Hermione.”
“A few haven’t completed beta testing yet though, so be sure to chuck those ones extra far, and then get back to us about how well they worked,” George added.
“Don’t worry, you don’t feel a thing,” Sirius soothed, and the others nodded along.
“Yes, because Hermione is definitely in the habit of handing out illegal potions to random students,” Harry snarked back.
“Hey, Vee,” he greeted back, smiling tiredly at her. “Let’s give ‘em hell when the attacks resume, eh?”
“Oh,” Veronica said lamely. “Er, I was just joking, you know. But, um…” She trailed off, uncertain how to brush off this awkwardness but not wanting to leave on such a note.
“We’re so proud of you, darling,” Lily told her. “You’ve been so brave.”
In response, Draco produced a small vial, similar to the ones that he and Blaise had put the potion in, but this one contained something silvery and viscous. Memories.
But before she could fight Voldemort for the last time, she needed to find him first. Luckily for her, she was practically a walking dark lord detector, at least when it came to Voldemort. How nice of him to have left a calling card on the night he’d tried to kill her, right?
To whom, exactly? What was Malfoy to him? His alpha? That couldn’t be right though. Yes, Malfoy had claimed him, but that was just temporary. It was a precaution only. Besides, Harry was getting better at telling when he felt things because he was an omega and that was what was written in his magical core or DNA or wherever, and when he felt things because that was what he felt. And whatever he felt for Malfoy, it was simply what he felt. After all, his omega instincts were hardly going to be sent into a tizzy by words on a paper that had no obvious ties to the alpha who had claimed him.
“I haven’t read
“Here here!” someone called out from the back of the room.
“Oh bugger, you’re actually right,” Malfoy breathed, then added with more certainty, “which is more evidence that you can’t possibly be Potter.”
For a second, Veronica’s breath caught in her throat, touched by the unexpected compliment. Of course, Draco had to ruin things by continuing, “Though obviously, not as lovely as me. Still, with us both on the broom, the sunset would end up being overshadowed, so it would be completely moot.”
“Ron!” Harry whined. “Quiet!”
“Alright, fine, so you’re an omega,” Malfoy said, crossing his arms. “But if you don’t want anyone knowing, then why are you even here?”
“Harry, you’re not honestly telling me that you made a decision like this based on something as unreliable as his scent, are you?” Hermione scolded. “Scents change. They can be affected by so many factors, from a person’s mood to who they’ve been around. They are not an accurate judge of character.”
“You’ve been really odd lately,” Ron said. “Like, you still haven’t told us who left that mark.”
“A feeling? I thought that sort of thing was for Gryffindors,” Veronica teased, before the words really sank in. “Oh. A feeling. You took the potion.”
“Is it rotten if I say I’m glad?” Veronica asked.
“Fine,” Snape snapped, storming out of the room.
This meant that prebuscents and tweens were all just a bunch of walking time bombs, essentially. Schools had to be on high alert, ready for such instances, especially since some secondary gender reveals could prompt others to awaken to their own secondary genders- some statistics even claimed that as many as 75% of heat frenzies were caused by pubescent youth presenting.
” Ron roared, jumping to his feet.
Wait.
“Me too,” Veronica replied. “And I guess I’ll be leaving things to you. Finish him off for me. And if you could, try and look after everyone.”
“Well you should,” Malfoy retorted. “Because he’s mine.” Malfoy’s eyes glinted with just a hint of possessiveness, and Harry wasn’t sure whether he was infuriated by it or turned on. “Now back the fuck off before I tell Professor Snape on all of you.”
“Just that we’ve been preparing for this for quite some time now,” Michael Corner smirked from where he was perched.
“It’s probably in some barely used corner of the school somewhere,” a Hufflepuff suggested optimistically. “With all of us here looking, I’m sure we’ll find it.”
The following month, the process repeated, with Harry once again sending the hanky, and once again having it returned with a polite note.
Fact: In order to prevent incidents involving secondary gender, all Hogwarts students were required to take scent suppressants.
“In first year you challenged me to a midnight duel in the trophy room all so you could set me up for detention,” Harry sighed. “Later that year, you discovered that we were going to help Hagrid get rid of his illegal dragon, and-”
“Yes,” Draco nodded, finally turning towards her but keeping his gaze askance. “I wasn’t planning to, originally, but I thought I might need it. Sev didn’t tell me anything about the memories he left for you, but he did tell me that when I gave them to you, I should make sure I didn’t leave anything left unsaid to you.” Draco looked up then, his eyes meeting Veronica and practically piercing straight through her with the sorrow in them. He knew.
She watched as Snape begged Dumbledore to help save her mother, watched as he raged and despaired in the wake of Lily’s death. And in her mind, she couldn’t help but compare again to her and Draco, and wonder how Draco would react if it were she who might die, she who got killed because of a prophecy surrounding her child. Yes, Draco would certainly be in a similar emotional state, although she doubted he’d ever be that resentful towards someone Veronica chose to love, let alone any child of hers.
much,” Hermione protested quietly, her cheeks dusted with pink.
“I was, a bit,” Veronica admitted. “But what do you mean, things to take care of?”
“No, Veronica, I can’t,” Draco said, reaching out to tilt her head back upward and look her in the eye. “Sev wouldn’t have told me to say my goodbyes unless… unless he was sure you were going to die. Which would mean you dying is the only way to- to-” he cut himself off, too choked up to continue, turning and pacing away before coming right back like a yo-yo. “It just isn’t fair,” he ranted harshly. “Why can’t it be someone else who has to die? I mean, you’ve already lost so much to the dark lord, now you have to die as well? It’s utter bollocks!”
“Much obliged, Potter,” Malfoy said, and he actually sounded a little bit grateful. “Now let’s get out of this godforsaken hall before either of us passes out from all these odors. Or worse, someone sees us talking and realizes I’ve claimed you.”
“Well what about her diadem?” Luna piped up. “It’s the most famous item associated with Ravenclaw.”
“You could,” Veronica said in a small voice, lowering her eyes to the ground.
“About that,” Veronica started. “I was talking with Hermione and Ron, and we were thinking it’d be best to change tactics. We want to beef up the defenses as much as we can so we can fight with a smaller force, and evacuate everyone else.”
“Harry, did something happen?” Hermione began in a concerned tone as they all sat on the beds.
Veronica was about to say no, but then her brain reminded her of one little detail that needed to be attended to.
“Vee, Mione, enough,” Ron interrupted. “Look, everyone, we’re looking for something that would have belonged to Ravenclaw, anyone got any ideas?”
“Severus, Hagrid will be available to retrieve the girl and transport her to Diagon Alley, but once there, he will have some very important and rather urgent business to attend to for me, and will not be able to look after her. I need you to do this. You did promise to protect the girl.”
“Great! I was going to ask Luna and Ginny to help out too, so if you’d fill them in, that’d be a huge help,” Veronica beamed.
“Prat,” Veronica spat at Draco.
“He might not be all that surprised,” Malfoy replied wryly. “I was interrupted in the middle of one of my letters over the holidays, and left it where someone might read it. Father did, and surmised that there was something between us. And when he inquired, Severus admitted that he saw us talking for a while at the scent party, since he and the other professors were there to make sure no one tried to force a bond or anything like that. You have no idea how uncomfortable it was, having my father tell me that he wished I had chosen differently, but would still give me his blessing.”
“Oh, I guess that’s true,” Veronica said, suddenly feeling selfish for wanting Draco to keep her here with the ring.
a great deal to him,” Veronica corrected sadly. “Since I’m not going to be around much longer.”
“Slytherin,” Draco replied, shrugging the insult off effortlessly.
“Guess we’ll need a pensieve then,” Veronica murmured, half to herself. “I don’t suppose Dumbledore’s old one is still in his office, is it?” she asked Draco, who nodded. “And the password?” she asked.
Of all the people who could have given Harry’s omega status away, the last person he would have expected would have been Professor Trelawney. She was just so out-of-touch with the world, and for all that she had convinced everyone that Harry was going to die back in third year, she was harmless.
“If you’re done chatting, I’d like to put this cauldron down sometime in the next five years,” Draco seethed from behind Zabini, looking irritable. “Or at least before Old Snakeface comes marching in and kills us all.”
“Sleep well, fair fellow,” she whispered fondly.
It must be the omega in him, that was it. Harry may not have behaved much like the omega he was, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t susceptible to some of the traits the gender was known for. Omegas trusted alphas, especially an alpha who had claimed them. Malfoy had bitten Harry, so it was only natural that Harry would be willing to place undeserved faith in him.
“Snake-face made an announcement, about ten minutes ago now,” Ron told her. “He called the death eaters to pull back, and said he’d spare everyone if you were handed over to him within an hour.”
Slipping out the front doors of the castle, Veronica couldn’t help but pause to turn around and take one last look at the castle that had been her home for six years. It was here that she’d learned magic, both the kind cast with a wand and the kind that came from the bonds between people. She’d felt love here, maybe not romantic love, but the love that was friendship and the familial love that came from people like the Weasleys, and Sirius, and even some of the professors to a certain extent. Like McGonagall, who felt a bit like a stern old aunt who hid her fondness behind a mask of impartiality. To Veronica, Hogwarts was a place of safety and happiness, despite the fact that she’d experienced more threats to her life here than with Dursleys, and suffered some of her most miserable days here as well. She would miss- well, she wouldn’t miss it since she’d be dead, but it was hard to let go of this place that meant so much to her. At least by dying, she’d be protecting it.
“Dumbledore,” Draco replied. “Personally, I thought it should be ‘Potter’, but Sev wouldn’t have it. Said he didn’t want to be reminded of your father every time he stepped into his own office, and that it would be painfully obvious where our true loyalties lie.”
the one who’s almost blind?” Veronica teased.
“What do you mean?” Hermione asked.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, pretending to be convinced, “I know.”
“Which is why you need to let us help you,” Ginny insisted. “Tell us what needs to be done. We’ll help.”
“We’ll only get one chance at this, Mione!”
“Be careful!” Hermione called after her as she left the office. It was such an ordinary parting, and yet it made Veronica’s breath catch in her throat and the mild cheer she’d felt from their friendly teasing vanish. There was no sense in Veronica being careful, not now. Not when she needed to die.
In some cases, this just meant separate classrooms and class activities for each secondary gender, while others would isolate each gender to certain buildings. There were also schools that catered only to students of one specific gender, like schools for alphas or omegas, or sometimes even primary gender was factored in as well.
“Why would you glamour it?” the Slytherin girl asked, her eyes narrowed in suspicion.
She opened the pouch and pulled out the snitch Dumbledore had bequeathed her, earning herself a raised eyebrow from Draco. Drawing the snitch up to her mouth, she held it to her lips as she said “I’m going to die”, and the golden ball opened up, revealing the ring she’d long suspected was there. She turned the snitch over to drop the ring into her hand, then held it out to Draco on her open palm.
“Oh yeah, that too,” Ron agreed, nodding.
“I knew it,” Ron hissed. “Whatever that git did, I’ll kill him, I swear.”
“Why me?” he asked. “Why not Ron or Hermione or Draco or even one of the members of the Order?”
“That’s private, Ron,” Harry replied weakly.
“Or third year you almost got kissed by a dementor, though I guess that wasn’t really Moldy’s fault…” Ron continued.
Veronica wasn’t sure what she’d expected to be at the end of the passage from the Hog’s Head, but the Room of Requirement was not it. Especially not a version of the Room of Requirement that was apparently functioning as living quarters for a good portion of the student body. Yet here they were, surrounded by students and house colors and hammocks, and Veronica didn’t even have to look at Ron and Hermione to see they were just as stunned by this as she was. It felt surreal.
“Veronica, wait, it could be a trap!” she hissed, then awkwardly added to Draco, “Er, sorry, it’s just that-”
“Stop it,” Malfoy insisted firmly. “I don’t want to hear a recitation of all the griefs you have against me, especially since it’s making me actually start to believe it’s you, Potter, and there is no way I can accept that eventuality.” He turned away from Harry, his hands on his head as his perfect posture slumped into what could only be described as a hunch.
He felt a nose bump the crook of his neck, requesting permission, and his heart soared. He was sure that his scent would soon be filled with pheromones that would indicate his assent, but just to be clear, he tilted his head for better access and raised a hand until he felt silky hair, which he pushed downwards, encouragingly. He pushed a little too hard and caused his would-be-claimant to crash into his shoulder a bit, and they reached up to flick his chest in retaliation before repositioning themself. There was a pregnant moment in which Harry felt his heart pounding out of his chest, followed by a touch of breath on his exposed scent gland, and then…
“I think what Ron means to say is that we’re a bit surprised to see either of you, Zabini. You or Draco,” Hermione explained.
The memory changed again, and Veronica found herself in Dumbledore’s office, watching Snape glare sullenly at the carpet as the headmaster made a request of him.
“Hello dear,” Mrs. Malfoy replied, smiling and waving daintily.
“It’s because I’m the Chosen One,” Veronica said wryly. “The dark lord chose me to be the other person in the prophecy, and now I have to fulfill it. But you’re right, it is bollocks. I was really looking forward to after the war.”
“At this point, it might be better to say I
“He’s in the Shrieking Shack,” she informed her two friends. “Let’s go.”
“Clearly you haven’t spent enough time around Hermione; tradition is just an excuse to hang on to practices that promote inequality and other such shite,” Veronica replied primly, doing her best Hermione imitation as she paraphrased something her friend had said more than a few times. “Besides, what happens when you get gay couples, huh? Can’t have the guy asking the girl if they’re both guys or both girls.”
“You don’t stop caring about someone just because they’re gone, kiddo,” Veronica’s father chipped in. “After all, the stone you’re holding wouldn’t exist if you did. He’ll still love you.”
“Such a Slytherin answer,” Veronica huffed, shaking her head fondly. “Alright, best friend. Now that I’ve found you, would you be my boyfriend?”
After turning a corner, Veronica checked that no one could see her, then pulled out her cloak and ducked under it. Thus hidden, she was able to sneak her ways through the hallways and to the entrance with ease. In some ways, it made her wish she hadn’t put on the cloak, because if any of the people she passed by invisibly had seen her, they might have noticed where she was headed and stopped her. And while this was what she had to do, she couldn’t help but wish someone would. If they’d just take this decision out of her hands, then it would be too bad, so sad, she’d tried her best but in the end she just couldn’t do it. She’d get to live. But then, of course, who knew how many people might die? And it would always be Veronica’s fault, regardless of the fact that someone had prevented her from sacrificing herself.
“Well, look what the cat dragged in,” interrupted a familiar voice, and Veronica whirled to see Ginny, Fred, George, and Lee Jordon standing there, matching grins full of mischief. Even a year of darkness couldn’t dampen their spirits, it seemed. Veronica couldn’t help but envy them that.
“Remind me again, who was it who kept pestering me last year with endless notes about seeking help when it’s needed and not trying to handle everything alone?” Draco drawled loudly to the general populace of the room, pointedly not looking at Veronica until he’d finished speaking. She stuck her tongue out at him.
“No you’re not, it’s too dangerous,” Veronica argued. “You could get hurt, or killed, or-”
“I have not!” Hermione protested indignantly.
“Wow, so smart, give the omega a NEWT,” the Ravenclaw drawled. “We know that little tidbit of irrelevant information, dipshit. That doesn’t change the fact that you owe us. I coulda been mated by now, except my omega had hopes that the great alpha Harry Potter might look her way. So you owe me an apology for cockblocking, and you owe her an apology for giving her false hopes.”
Harry supposed Ron had a point. They may have made a pact and shook hands, but really there was nothing to guarantee that Malfoy would come to Harry’s aid if he ever needed it.
“Yeah, now that you mention it, that’s true,” Ron agreed. “Normally you two are at each other’s throats, but you’ve been quiet this term.”
“Oh,” Veronica said, her voice uncharacteristically small.
“A good dream, is it about me?” Veronica asked.
Harry was surprised when, at the end of the week, he returned to his dorm to find his handkerchief, freshly laundered, lying on his bed, along with a folded piece of parchment which turned out to be a very polite and formal thank-you note from Malfoy.
“Insurance,” Harry replied. “No one’s gonna bother a claimed omega. But what about you, haven’t mummy and daddy arranged a perfect match for you yet?”
“I’m not asking you to,” Veronica insisted, only half in-control of her words. As she spoke, the potion seemed to take over her mouth, determining what she said for her. “If the people who leave only go as far as Hogsmeade, they’ll be perfectly in place as a sort of back-up force should the death eaters try and make a break for it.”
Or so Harry had thought, right up until the moment she outed him in the midst of a divination class with the Hufflepuffs, by predicting that he would be in grave danger during his next heat.
“Didn’t the announcement say not to take any potions since they might mix badly with the antidote to the suppressants?” Harry pointed out. “Besides, why would I take Polyjuice potion when no one’s going to see me? And where would I even get some?”
“Not entirely sure,” he replied. “I haven’t seen them myself. Sev was very adamant about them being for your eyes only.”
“I’m not as good as you think I am, Draco,” Veronica protested quietly. “If I am the person you say I am, it’s because you helped me to be that girl. You can see me that way because you allow me to be that sort of person. Without you, I might have turned out differently.”
“I don’t owe anyone an apology,” Harry spat back. “I’ve told people I’m not interested in a mate ever since my first day here. I’ve rejected them all, right from the start, so there was no reason for anyone to assume I’d choose them.”
“You haven’t told them, have you,” Draco stated, rather than questioned. Veronica hung her head.
“Plus if we all take that potion-” Hannah Abbot began.
“And yet I almost ended up in Slytherin,” Veronica pointed out. “Though Hogwarts houses hardly determine how a person will turn out.”
“What, were you planning to come rushing in and save the day, then sweep yon fair fellow off his feet?” Draco drawled jokingly.
“Good,” Hermione said. “And Harry, don’t worry about anyone trying to take advantage of you. Ron and I will make sure it doesn’t happen. You’ve got other friends who I’m sure you can rely on too. You’ll be fine.”
“Don’t reckon I’ve ever seen no crown,” the Gryffindor muttered.
Fact: Harry James Potter wasn’t particularly interested in attending any scent parties, ever.
happened,” Harry insisted, because it was true, nothing had happened. At least, not the sort of thing that usually happened to people who paired up during a scent party.
“It’s not that simple,” Veronica argued, shaking her head. “I can’t just kill him, there’s a few things that need to be taken care of first, that’s why we need to find what we came here for. And- and there’s other things too, and we’re just not ready. I know you want to fight, but as things are… Until we do what we came to do, we just can’t win.”
“But-” Veronica protested.
“Second,” Draco continued, “this would be a mutually monogamous relationship, one with the intent of seeking to deduce whether or not a permanent relationship is feasible.”
“But every time you two see each other, you flinch,” Hermione pointed out. “Both of you. And then you try and pretend the other isn’t there at all, almost like something happened between you two…”
“Thank you for looking after our son for so long,” Mr. Malfoy said coolly, with a curt perfunctory bow.
Students would be sent a dose of potion on August 31, to be taken immediately, so that their scent would be blocked before they got on the Hogwarts Express, and would receive all subsequent doses in the food and drink provided by the school. They were not required to continue their suppressants over the summer, but were given the option to have suppressants owled to them during any periods they spent outside of school if they wished to maintain their scentless state. It was a precaution that allowed students to interact with their peers regardless of secondary gender, and also kept students from stinking up the hallways with pheromones.
Her only answer was the deep breaths of someone asleep.
“Claiming me is
“Told you we could trust Draco,” Veronica couldn’t help but interject. “Speaking of, where is he?” A horrible thought occurred to her then. “Wait, he’s not- he wasn’t one of-”
“Someday,” Malfoy agreed, mirroring Harry’s smile.
“Will you?” Veronica questioned back. Draco paused for a moment, just staring at her. She hadn’t noticed them gravitating towards each other, but now they were face to face, barely a foot between them, and she could almost feel his breath.
Teeth.
“Isn’t it traditional for the boy to be the one to ask the girl out?” he queried.
“Hmph,” Snape grumbled. “Once the girl realizes her celebrity status, she’ll no doubt take advantage of it. I won’t have her being a bad influence on Draco, or worse, mistreating him out of a sense of superiority. He’s had enough abuse in his life.”
“Well everyone’s wrong,” Harry snapped back. “Which, frankly, I’m perfectly okay with, given people’s attitudes towards omegas. Especially male omegas. You should hear my cousin and his friends, they all seem to think the idea of a male omega getting pregnant is just about the most hilarious thing ever.”
“Of course I would,” Draco told her. “But they did everything they could to ensure my survival. They’d want me to live, not trap myself in the past.”
“Negotiations are still in progress on that front,” Malfoy replied. “But I’m not here for a mate, surely you could smell that.”
Slowly, Veronica lifted her head from the pensieve, and she was only a little surprised to find Ron and Hermione there. They both had grim looks on their faces, and Veronica feared what news they could possibly have. Someone must’ve died. Or maybe the school had fallen, or-
“So what are we doing next?” Neville asked, and Veronica felt her heart sink. She’d wanted to sneak into Hogwarts unnoticed and fight alone, not get her friends involved.
“Plus you barely got out of some of those scrapes alive,” Ron chipped in unnecessarily. “Like in first year when you ended up in hospital after we went after Quirrel-”
When the claim bite was finally completed, the other person pulled away. Harry opened his eyes slowly, blinking as he readjusted to having sight. The person in front of him was hard to see through his watery eyes, but he was reasonably certain they were rather pale, in both skin tone and hair color. Possibly male, and…
Harry tucked the portkey into his robes so he could return it later, his head instinctively swiveling to try and look around. But of course, he couldn’t see anything, thanks to the spell Flitwick had used. He waited for the antidote to be handed out, biting his lip nervously, wondering what kind of person he would be claimed by. A beta would be nice, with their tendency towards level-headedness. Most likely, they would be the ones ready to accept the kind of relationship Harry sought. But at the same time, a beta’s claim was more likely to be challenged or ignored by those who held the sexist opinion that omegas could only be properly claimed and sexually satisfied by an alpha. As such, it would be safer for Harry to let an alpha claim him, preferably one who could hold their own in a duel. But Harry didn’t want some domineering hot-head who was fueled by their sex drive, which is what a lot of the alphas at the scent party would be.
Veronica’s jaw dropped and she stared a moment before finding the words to respond. “Don’t even think about it you bloody bastard,” she said with flat anger.
Veronica waited until she was within the trees before thrice turning the stone, and watched as everyone came out. She wasn’t surprised to see her parents or Sirius, but she was taken aback when they were joined by two more figures who she’d never met before, but had seen often enough, since they both shared traits with Draco.
She had to die.
“Neither do you, thank Salazar,” Malfoy muttered.
“How can I?” she asked. “They’d- they’d try to stop me, or- They’d just make it harder for me. They wouldn’t understand what it is that I have to do.”
For a moment, Draco just stared at her slack-jawed, making glottal noises as his throat worked, before he pulled himself together.
“Alright there, Harry?” Malfoy asked in an undertone.
“You and me both,” Harry muttered.
As the line moved forward and Harry stepped up to where Professor Flitwick was casting the privacy spells and handing out portkeys, he could feel dozens of hopeful eyes on him. After all, who wouldn’t want to become the mate of the boy-who-lived, especially if he was an alpha. Finally, it was his turn, and with a wave of Flitwick’s wand, Harry was robbed of his senses. He held out his hand like he’d seen those before him do, and his portkey was dropped into his palm. There was the momentary disorientation as the portkey took effect, and he just barely managed not to go sprawling as the portkey dropped him in place in the great hall.
“Sev,” Draco said simply. “The dark lo- no, Voldemort killed him. I had to go retrieve his body. Thankfully he didn’t have the snake eat him. And then… there were some potions Sev left for after the battle, I was helping to distribute them.” He yawned. “Salazar’s balls, I’m tired.” He leaned over, resting his head on Veronica’s shoulder. “Mm, you need to eat more, you’re bony.”
“I’d say that sounds like a good way to go blind, but you already practically are,” Draco commented. Veronica retaliated by making a rude gesture that she’d learned from Ron at him.
hears about this, got it?”
Fact: Even betas still suffer from puberty-induced randiness.
“Guys, no,” Veronica gasped. “This isn’t your fight, you should-”
“Sounds like Fred and George’s type of thing to me,” Ron commented. “I mean, if they were able to make a corridor into a swamp two years ago, imagine what those two could get up to now.”
“So did you guys,” Veronica muttered rebelliously.
It was in the third month that things changed. Gryffindor had their first quidditch match against Ravenclaw a few days before Malfoy’s usual note arrived, and so when the missive came, the content was not the blunt assertion of an upcoming rut that the previous months had brought.
Harry’s hand instinctively flew up to slap over his scent gland. The morning after the scent party, he’d gotten Hermione to help him place a glamour over the claim mark, since claim marks were associated with omegas and betas (especially omegas) and might give him away. Unfortunately, Ron had seen the mark before then, and even if he hadn’t, it was hard for two of them to keep a secret from the third member of their group. Case and point: the current interrogation.
“There’s a bust in Ravenclaw Tower that shows Ravenclaw wearing it,” Cho said, speaking up before Luna could. Which, admittedly, might have been for the best, considering what Luna could be like. “It’s really just a tiara, a rather delicate looking one.”
In other words, how many deaths was she responsible for. How many people had she failed to save? How many lives had been lost from her failures? Even though she was going to die tonight without having ever killed anyone directly, she would still bear the guilt for every person who had died at Voldemort’s hands.
again?”
“Alpha females can still give birth to children of their own, just as they can sire them,” Harry pointed out coolly, trying to hide the panic he felt. So far, the alphas seemed to be more offended by his deception rather than interested in assaulting him. But that didn’t mean their attitude wouldn’t change.
“I’ve faced him before, remember,” Veronica pointed out. “He hasn’t killed me yet.”
“Hell no,” Harry snapped. “I would have thought he was the worst person for the job! But his scent seemed right and-”
“We could use a little help, mate,” Ron pointed out, nudging Veronica lightly.
Harry carried the hanky all weekend before sending it to Malfoy wrapped carefully in a used copy of the Daily Prophet, borrowing a school owl so that Hedwig wouldn’t be recognized. Even after he explained the need for anonymity in sending this particular item, Hedwig still but his thumb and gave him the cold shoulder. He could only hope that she became more understanding as the year went on.
“This has to be some sort of sick joke,” Malfoy said, taking the words right out of Harry’s mouth. “Polyjuice potion, that must be it. Tell me, who are you really?”
“You oughta be ashamed of yourself, pretending to be one of us,” the only girl of the group said. She wore Slytherin colors, while the second guy wore Ravenclaw blue. “It’s disgusting, acting all high and mighty when you’re nothing but a baby-maker.”
“Granger,” Malfoy replied instantly.
After that, there were only a couple more memories. They showed how Snape had helped in secret, both with the potion and the sword, before fading into one last one that dropped a bombshell that left Veronica feeling shattered.
“Indeed, you mean a great deal to him,” Mrs. Malfoy agreed.
“It’s supposed to be romantic, you arse. It’s in all the muggle movies,” she informed him haughtily. Not that she’d know, since the Dursleys weren’t exactly keen on letting her watch TV with them, nor were they inclined to give her money to go to the cinema herself.
But the real turning point in their relationship came a month later, when Malfoy sent Harry a tin of toffee as a Christmas present, along with a small package labelled
Veronica flinched at that. Apparently, about four years before they’d started Hogwarts, Draco had been abducted by people who saw a death eater’s son as a blemish on the wizarding world. He’d been rescued quickly, but not before being subjected to several unpleasant hexes. Although she hadn’t known it at the time, that had been one of the main reasons for his meek demeanor when they’d first met: experience had taught him that public spaces such as Diagon Alley were dangerous.
“Of course,” Draco said, sitting up properly and fluttering his hands around his head to smooth his hair. “What can I do for you?”
“It’s our school too, Veronica,” Parvati Patil reminded her. “Our world. If they win here, that’s it. You may not want to risk us, but really, you’re all we’ve got at this point. Better to lose us than you, right?”
“But while the death toll is low, there’s still plenty of people who won’t be able to fight anymore,” Hermione continued. “Lavender was maimed by Greyback, and I think there were a couple of other victims. Plus there’s plenty of curse victims. But more importantly, we need to talk about what we’re going to do once the potion wears off. Our luck is going to run out, Vee, and we need to be prepared for that.”
“That’s what I thought too,” Malfoy replied. “But I think having your scent during my ruts continued the process. It’s still not the same as if you had my venom in you, but… well the fact that I felt your fear and knew where to find you just now proves that there’s some connection between us.” He paused, searching Harry’s eyes, then asked, “Does that bother you, Harry?”
Malfoy recovered first.
“Thanks, Nev,” Veronica smiled. “I’ll see you later, then.” Except she wouldn’t, would she?
“We literally just went through this, it’s Felix Felicis, Potter, do keep up,” Zabini sneered.
He’d just gotten back to the common room when Hermione and Ron accosted him and dragged him back to the dorms for a private talk.
He nearly groaned aloud as his new partner’s jaws closed around his exposed neck, biting down and leaving their mark, claiming him. It didn’t hurt as much as he’d anticipated, which was nice. Another thing he hadn’t anticipated, one which wasn’t as nice, was the saliva he could feel trickling out from the other’s jaws. He made a face, but he supposed that if things were the other way around and he were the one biting into a delicious scent, he’d probably end up drooling a bit too. He closed his eyes, waiting for the other person to release him.
Still, things did work out, in a way, since Veronica had finally had the good sense to seek information from the ghosts, and had been able to get answers from the ghost of Ravenclaw’s daughter herself. From there, it was a simple matter of going back to the Room of Requirement and asking it for the place where things were hidden, and sure enough, she was able to find the diadem, but then she ran into Crabbe and Goyle in the process.
“Also, Ron,” Draco added, turning to face the Gryffindor trio with much less grace than usual, “what the bloody hell I’m doing here is delivering something Sev and I have been working on since last year, something you’ll be needing before too long I imagine.”
“For you, maybe,” Ron cut in. “For most people, reading through the school library three times over is a lot.”
“Yes,” Veronica said, ignoring the small niggling voice of doubt at the back of her mind. What if they were wrong? What if Voldemort hadn’t really hidden it here when he came for his staff interview? What if-
“So the diadem’s our only lead, then,” Veronica sighed. “Okay, everyone, we’re going to have to find this diadem, and quickly.”
“No thanks,” Harry said. “I’d rather be equals.”
“I will.” He pressed their foreheads together for a few short seconds of eternity, and then let go, and Veronica knew it was time to go. This time, she really did go past him, putting the ring and cloak on as she went. She felt his eyes on her as she walked away, and knew that even if he couldn’t see her, he’d keep watch for a while.
And yet here was 15-year-old Harry, waiting in line for the first scent party of the term despite the queasy feeling in his stomach. The reason was simple: shortly after the Yule Ball the previous year, Harry had finally presented his secondary gender, and he was an omega.
Her friends… Oh Merlin, how were they going to take this? She couldn’t tell them; even if it was the only way, they would surely try to stop her. But when they found out, they’d be devastated, wouldn’t they? She knew she would be, if it were them who had to die. And furious too, if they went to die without saying anything to her. Would they ever forgive her?
“The diadem’s been lost for as long as anyone can remember,” Cho retorted gently.
“You were angry at them for dying?” Veronica asked, surprised.
“But wouldn’t you like to talk to your parents, at least once?” Veronica pressed. Because as horrific as that night in the graveyard when Voldemort had come back had been, she couldn’t help but treasure those few words from her mum and dad. It was one thing to be told how they’d loved her, and to know it was their loving sacrifice that had allowed her to live, but it was another to experience that love.
. Harry had immediately written a lengthy thank-you letter, apologizing for not getting Malfoy anything in return and vowing to amend this slight the next time he was in Hogsmeade, and asking about his holiday. And when Malfoy’s reply had included the lines,
Fact: Most schools were segregated by secondary gender.
“Don’t even start on that shitshow that was fourth year and the Triwizard Tournament,” Draco said. “Which was all orchestrated according to you-know-who’s plotting.”
She was the final horcrux.
“Why the bloody hell would I dream about you, you wank-?” Draco growled, raising his head off her shoulder and opening his eyes, which widened comically when he saw her face right next to his.
“I can’t do that,” Draco replied sadly. “There’s only you, Veronica. No one else will ever be able to take your place.”
“But-”
Feeling tears in her eyes, Veronica brushed past Draco, intent on getting out of there before she really started crying. Or rather, she tried to, because right as she started to move, Draco surged forward, his lips colliding violently with hers in what had to be one of the worst kisses in history, almost splitting her lip in the process. He pulled back a bit then tried again, this time successfully managing a sweet and gentle kiss, and Veronica felt everything she’d wanted to say but couldn’t being said right back to her.
Fact: At some point during puberty, a person’s secondary gender would reveal itself.
It took a few tries to find something suitable to send Malfoy. Harry’s hand-me-downs from Dudley were no good, since they were obviously muggle. His Weasley sweaters were too identifiable, and his school robes had the Gryffindor crest, as well as being something he couldn’t afford to lend away for an indefinite period of time. He considered sending the gloves he wore for quidditch, but not many students who weren’t on school teams had a pair of seeker’s gloves with them so those might give him away as well. He finally decided on a handkerchief that he’d bought for cleaning his glasses, which was a plain cream color and shouldn’t be too offensive. He only hoped Malfoy wouldn’t complain about the size.
“They’ll understand,” Sirius told her, reaching out a hand as if to rest it on her shoulder, but drawing back after his fingers started to go through her. “It may take them some time, years even, but by the time they join you, that anger will be gone, and they’ll just be glad to see you again after so long. I’d know, that’s how I felt seeing these two again.” He jerked a thumb at Lily and James.
Since the dawn of Hogwarts, professors and prefects had been finding students engaged in inappropriate activities in various places around the school. Of course there had been rules in place against that sort of thing, but rules only served as a deterrent for a select few. Even when one bygone headmaster of yore had opted to make expulsion the punishment for engaging in sexual intercourse, students had still sought ways to relieve their needs. As a result, the subsequent headmaster had thought up the convoluted idea of “scent parties”.
“Hermione, aside from Ravenclaw’s whatever, we still have two more of those things to deal with,” Veronica hissed back. “We can’t kill you-know-who until we take care of all that. If we fight now, it’ll all be in vain.”
As it turned out, the office was empty. Even the portrait frames had cleared out. Veronica did briefly wonder if there were any spells that functioned similarly to muggle gas attacks, but she dismissed the notion, instead heading over to the pensieve. As she’d reminded Hermione, Draco wouldn’t send her into an ambush. He was her best friend.
They didn’t get more than two steps, however, before a voice called out to them, or rather, to Veronica.
Harry began to feel something strange in his chest. Malfoy had wanted to give him a gift. His long-time rival, who had only ever had insults to give to Harry, now cared enough for him to send him a present. And Harry cared enough to do the same.
“You also haven’t been picking any fights with Malfoy,” Hermione added, all too sagely. Sometimes she was a little too smart.
“What is it?” Veronica asked impatiently. There was no sense dilly-dallying about, she had a dark lord to defeat. And the longer she waited, the more time she’d have to think about how outmatched she was.
“Know what?” Veronica croaked hoarsely.
Eventually though, Veronica pulled away with a sigh. “I should go,” she said. She could see the moment Draco shut off his emotions so that he wouldn’t stop her, like he was slamming a door shut in his soul. “Hey, promise me one thing,” she said, trying to bring back his previous expression, because she missed his gentle looks even though they’d only vanished a few seconds prior. “When you have kids, name one after me.”
“You didn’t betray us,” Veronica spat vehemently, because in her eyes, he very much hadn’t. He’d been forced into a bad situation, and if anyone was to blame, it was Veronica, since she was the one who’d fallen for Voldemort’s ministry trap hook, line, and sinker. “And there’s no way you’d ever try and set us up. You’re not like that, Draco.” She didn’t have to look to see that Ron and Hermione were exchanging that look they got whenever Veronica stood up for Draco. It was a look that said, “Here she goes again,” and “Why won’t she just see sense?” and something else as well that Veronica hadn’t quite figured out, but was a little bit pitying, she thought. “Which is why,” she continued, “I’m going. Like I said, I’ll see you guys in a bit.”
“Um, what’s this?” Veronica asked.
“It’s just that it’s awfully convenient for me to suddenly be back on your side after I betrayed you, I know,” Draco said wryly, his right hand rising to clutch at his left forearm. “I would feel the same in your shoes. But I swear to you, as far as I know, that office is safe.”
“There!” Malfoy exclaimed, thrusting out an arm towards Harry and straightening once more. “That’s exactly the crux of the matter, isn’t it? Since when the bloody hell are you an omega? You’re Potter, an alpha if there ever was one! Everyone says so.”
“Because it would be hell if my parents found out I’d chosen a mate on my own,
“Oh, finally decided to show up, did you? I was beginning to think you’d changed your mind,” Veronica said, just a tad bitterly. “And mornin’ to you too.”
“How did you know I was here?” she asked, all her reminiscent thoughts about Hogwarts shifting to Draco instead.
Eventually though, Veronica couldn’t avoid things any longer. When Hermione came to tell her that Rita Skeeter was about to come up with her own version of events if Veronica didn’t show up for an interview, Veronica asked her friend to buy her ten more minutes, then, once Hermione was gone, she reached over and gently shook Draco awake.
“We won’t either,” Hermione agreed, and was followed by a chorus of others who decided to jump on the blackmail bandwagon.
Having downed the potion, Veronica let her feet take her where they would, and before long she found herself face to face with Neville. Perfect.
“I didn’t,” he replied airily, still staring out at the grounds. “But I had a feeling if I said something you’d pop up.”
“And what do you think the past year has been like?” Seamus asked, also butting in. Hell, at this point, pretty much everyone in the room was listening in, ready to chip in at any moment. This was no longer a conversation between Veronica, Ron, Hermione, and Neville, if indeed it ever had been. “We know bloody well what the death eaters might do to us, Veronica. We’ve seen hell here, and we know there’s more in store if we don’t stop it now.”
At the pensieve, Veronica dumped the vial of memories into the basin, and then carefully stuck her head inside. She closed her eyes as she broached the surface of the liquid in the pensieve, and when she opened them, she was in a memory of Snape’s, ready to learn what he wanted her to know.
“I’ll take your word for it,” Veronica laughed. “But you know, you didn’t really have to redeem yourself. I was always going to find a way to get you back. In a way, I’m actually kinda miffed that you came back on your own.”
“Then we’d better start looking,” Hannah Abbot said practically. “And you’re sure it’s in the school?”
“But-!”
Neville frowned at her, looking confused.
“Alright then, anything else?” Veronica asked desperately.
he did,” Harry interrupted quickly, keeping his voice hushed but insistent. Thankfully, Ron was placated, at least enough to sit down. He was still vibrating with anger though. “Look, it’s like this, okay. Right now, people think I’m an alpha, but sooner or later they’re going to figure out otherwise. I’ve got enough problems without people trying to make me their bitch, so I needed someone who can protect me when that time comes.”
“And you said
Plus, Harry just kinda liked the idea of mating with someone because they’d actually, y’know, fallen in love. Not because bearing children together would be easier, not because one had submitted to the other, not because it was a good match, but because being together genuinely made them happy and they couldn’t imagine spending their life with anyone else. Mating bonds weren’t meant to be destroyed; they could be, but it often had adverse effects on the formerly bonded. Some who chose to sever their bond lost the ability to feel, and in the worst cases, lost their minds completely. Based on that, Harry found it reckless to rush into a bond just because someone “smelled good”. And if Harry “Gotta-be-the-boldest-Gryffindor-to-ever-Gryffindor” Potter thought something was reckless, you knew it was really crazy.
Ron and Hermione proved themselves to be the most amazing friends ever, as they both braved the grateful masses in Veronica’s stead, telling people she was resting after an exhausting night and would talk to them later, in her own time. They both reported back every so often, letting Veronica know that the Order wanted to hold a meeting and would like for her to attend, and that the professors were meeting regarding restoration of the castle and would appreciate any help they could get, and that the remaining students were to be sent home so she should really come out to say goodbye before they left. And no, Veronica did not burst into tears when hearing that last one and remembering how just last night she was saying goodbye in a very different way, but it was a near thing.
“Gee, thanks,” Veronica drawled sarcastically. “Glad to know you were planning on badmouthing me every chance you got.”
“If you agree to the terms stated, then kiss me to seal the deal.”
“And you haven’t killed him yet either,” Neville said. He shrugged apologetically when Veronica scowled at him. “Sorry, Vee, but it’s how it is.”
Before long, the potion had been doled out as planned, and everyone turned to Veronica, looking to her for final instructions. She swallowed, wondering why the hell they were looking to her for leadership. Yes, she was the one who would defeat the dark lord, and she’d rallied everyone for Dumbledore’s Army, but defeating the dark lord was something she had to do alone, and as for the days with the DA… things had been different then. Simpler. She hadn’t known about the horcruxes, Dumbledore had been alive to give her advice, it was a completely different ball game back then. A muggle one probably, with only one ball, as opposed to the current situation’s veritable quidditch match with four balls, only all of them were bludgers that had been jinxed to try and kill Veronica. And okay, maybe that wasn’t the best comparison to use, because it made things really intimidating to imagine being chased by four rogue bludgers, and people were still waiting on her to speak.
There was an awkward shuffling among the Ravenclaws, but otherwise there was silence.
“Don’t misunderstand me, Veronica,” Draco said, smiling painfully, so painfully that Veronica felt like bursting into tears from the torment spilling from his eyes and flowing into whoever might meet them. “If there was a way to get a happy ending, one where I could keep you with me and keep you safe, I would. The last thing I want is for you to die. But I know you’d never forgive yourself if you don’t do whatever it is that you must do that will result in your death. I can’t make you suffer like that just so I can have whatever fleeting stolen time we’d get before the dark lord hunted you down. And if I take that ring… I think the temptation would be too great. To do as the second brother did, and choose to join you so as to be with you properly.”
Strangely enough, that was all it took to create regular correspondence between the two. At first it was just bickering- Malfoy complaining that Harry was being unfair and Harry complaining back that Malfoy was the one being unfair with all his demands. But even with all their complaints, there was a sort of camaraderie in it that Harry would never have expected. Soon it became complaints about things other than each other- how much homework their professors had assigned, how boring a certain class was, how intense their team’s quidditch practices were, and so on. From there, it just became general commentary, like when Malfoy saw fit to compare Professor Flitwick’s moustache to a caterpillar, and Harry replied by commenting that caterpillar moustaches were one thing, but that was nothing compared to the way the ancient runes professor’s eyebrows looked like they were stolen from a great horned owl. Malfoy had replied by sending Harry a detailed drawing of a mournful-looking great horned owl without the characteristic tufts, and Harry had guffawed loudly in the middle of transfiguration and cost Gryffindor ten points.
“Yeah, if death eaters are in the school, definitely take the potion,” Ron agreed.
“There you are!” Draco exclaimed, speed-walking his way over to them. Draco didn’t run, not unless it was absolutely necessary. He claimed it was beneath his dignity. That, and the pained stiffness of his movements probably was a sign that, for the moment, running was beyond his capabilities. “Veronica, before you do anything stupid- don’t argue, you know you’re going to, you bloody Gryffindor- when we were working on the Felix Felicis, Sev gave me something for you, that I was to give to you if anything happened to him. He said it was absolutely necessary for you to see it
“Bonded?” Malfoy finished, finally turning his gaze in Harry’s direction. “Well aren’t we?”
“Oh. You’re not Zabini,” he said, his voice half an octave higher than normal.
She waved, but Hermione grabbed her arm before she could walk away.
“I think we should listen to them too,” Hermione said quietly. “It’s not like we have any clue where the horcrux might be, and Draco’s right: you’re being a hypocrite.”
Veronica didn’t see Draco at all that first night. At first, she’d been worried- terrified really- that he’d been killed in the fighting despite his consumption of the potion, but Hermione informed her that she’d seen him after the battle. It stung a little, that despite everything Draco didn’t come to pick up where they’d left off, just as it had stung when she’d asked him to the Yule Ball and found out he was already going with Pansy Parkinson, but she supposed he might feel a bit conflicted about things right now. She couldn’t imagine it was easy to say a final goodbye to someone, only to have them pop up less than an hour later and go vanquishing evil like it was the new going thing. But she’d be lying if she said she didn’t resent him a bit for it.
“I suppose you do have a point there,” Neville admitted. “A lot of the death eaters do have some rather cowardly tendencies.”
Veronica wasn’t sure what expression she was making right then, but she couldn’t help but feel it was bitterly ironic that just when she’d discovered what she needed to do, the perfect opportunity presented itself. She just had to find a way to give everyone the slip.
“Hey, Nev,” she greeted.
“And I won’t?” Draco asked softly.
“I’d actually recommend waiting to take it,” Hermione countered. “Only use it if you are in danger. That way, you can guarantee its effects will protect you when you need them, and won’t wear off prematurely.”
Draco paused and thought for a moment, before saying, “Not quite. There’s one last thing.”
As it turned out, Veronica herself brought doom down upon them by having Luna take her to Ravenclaw Tower to look at the bust, only to run into Alecto Carrow there. So much for telling everyone to be careful. Before she knew it, the Carrows had been taken down- but not before calling Voldemort to the school- and the castle was preparing for battle. Snape was gone, having been chased off by the professors who believed him to be a death eater after all, and Veronica hadn’t stopped them since she wasn’t sure what to think about the professor at this point. Yes, she was pretty sure Draco had said Snape had helped with the luck potion, but at the same time, that might have been her own bias talking. After all, Snape was her best friend’s godfather, and while he did tend to be a bit stiff towards Veronica, the two of them had developed a grudging sort of tolerance towards each other due to their mutual affection towards Draco. They didn’t particularly like one another, but Veronica had come to trust Snape. Admittedly, that trust had been shaken when he’d killed Dumbledore, but a part of her still wanted to believe in the man because, although he was always exceedingly rude to her, he did still look out for her in a way. For instance, every Christmas since she started at Hogwarts an unidentified benefactor had sent her a jar of a useful salve which could heal flesh wounds almost instantly. A salve which couldn’t be found on the market but, when she showed it to Draco, he recognized, having seen it in Snape’s private lab.
“Better than we could have hoped for,” Hermione said grimly. “A couple of people have died on our side, but there would definitely have been more without the Felix Felicis.”
“First off, we already have the cup, we just need to destroy it,” Hermione pointed out. “And secondly, you-know-who’s going to be keeping that snake with him, meaning we have to face him to kill it.”
“Oh please, everyone knows you two hate each other,” the Ravenclaw huffed.
“Er, hello, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy?” Veronica greeted uncertainly.
Of course, Harry could try and find another omega to bond with, but there would be even less security in a bond with another omega than there would be with a beta. Plus, most of the people who Harry had met who were openly omega were… not what he wanted in a relationship. They were passive, submissive, too eager to please. He didn’t want a partner who was constantly looking to him to make the decisions and take the lead. He got enough of that from the wizarding world at large. Conversely, he didn’t want someone who would dictate his life for him and expect him to bow down to their every whim; again, he got enough of that from the wizarding world at large. Harry wanted a partner who would be his equal, regardless of genders. He wanted the kind of romance he’d read about in the peculiar genre of fiction where people lacked secondary genders.
She scampered lightly down the stairs, her chest feeling oddly fluttery and her heart feeling like it was going a million miles a minute despite the fact that it was beating at a normal rate. She felt like she was shaking, and yet when she looked at her hands, they were steady.
“So Potter, heard you’re an omega,” one of them sneered. A fellow Gryffindor, and a guy.
For the first few minutes, Harry just stood there, overwhelmed by all the sudden scents that were crashing into his olfactory sensors, making his eyes water. A few people bumped into him, already beginning their search, but he pushed them away before they could sniff him.
“Sure thing, Vee,” Ron said, waving. “Good luck.” He laughed, chortling “heh, luck,” to himself, and Veronica rolled her eyes as she waved back.
“So basically, hold onto it unless you run into any snakes,” Seamus said, crossing his arms and nodding. “Got it.”
“Yes, no breaking my heart,” Draco said firmly. “Which means no dying on me, Veronica Potter.”
“I don’t pick fights with Malfoy, he picks fights with me,” Harry grit back. “Maybe you should be asking him if something’s wrong instead.”
Neville directed everyone to pair off and line up together. As he did so, Draco and Zabini began conjuring up small vials and filling them with potion, then floating them over to whichever pair was next in line. Veronica didn’t pay those happenings much mind though, since she was trying to think of how to find the horcrux. Obviously it wouldn’t be somewhere anyone would simply stumble upon it, but where? The dungeons? Some hidden room even the marauders hadn’t found? A dusty old storage room, or a long-forgotten attic? And wherever it was, how was she supposed to find it in a matter of hours when no one had found it in however many hundreds of years the school had been around?
Fact: Those who presented as alphas or omegas suffered through monthly ruts and heats respectively.
They ended up staying like that for about three hours. It was incredibly boring to Veronica to just sit there while Draco slept, but she was hardly going to move and risk waking him up, even if her arm started tingling about half an hour in. Besides, it gave her an awfully convenient excuse to avoid anyone who might want to make a fuss over what had happened the night before. It almost made Veronica want to go back to living on the run, realizing that now that she truly had defeated Voldemort, that she’d be thrust back into the spotlight. For a few seconds, she almost regretted her decision to come back to life even, since she doubted she’d ever have another second of privacy ever again.
Of all the genders, omegas were at the most risk if their secondary gender was found out. While the wizarding world held by a much kinder view of omegas than muggles did, they were still subject to certain negative connotations of omegas. Namely, that omegas were sex objects rather than people. Oh sure, they walked and talked and thought and had emotions, but everything an omega did was all for the purpose of attracting a strong mate and producing however many children that mate wished for; or so many people thought. If Harry were to be discovered as an omega, he would never escape from students who saw it as their right to do with him as they pleased. He already felt like public property half the time, he didn’t need that treatment to get worse, thank-you-very-much.
And of course that was when the reporters finally broke into the office, and Veronica and Draco had to jump away from each other and collect themselves, even as the camera bulbs were already beginning to flash. It seemed Veronica had been right about not having any more privacy…
“Actually, strange as it may sound, I’d rather you didn’t,” Harry sighed. “Seeing as how he’s the one who claimed me and all.”
“Well it wasn’t like you paid those notes any heed,” Veronica snapped back.
,” Malfoy sneered, and Harry thought
Of course, some helpful soul had piped up and asked if she meant his next rut, and she had replied that no, of course she didn’t mean his next rut, ruts were for alphas and alphas never had whorl fingerprints, let alone ten of them like Harry, which she’d noticed during the palmistry unit, hadn’t everyone else? And of course, the Hufflepuffs had gossiped innocently after the lesson, and soon it had spread around, and before you knew it half of Ravenclaw house was trying to confirm whether or not alphas could have whorl fingerprints and half the school had heard crazy and completely unfounded rumors, but the long and short of it was that everyone had heard Harry was an omega, and he couldn’t even deny it because it was fucking true and, as Ron and Hermione had pointed out all those months before, Harry sucked at lying.
would be a good person to do that?” Ron yelped.
“You’re right, I’m probably not thinking straight,” Harry said, trying to convince himself Ron was right. But he just couldn’t bring himself to mean it. “I’ll end our arrangement, and find some way to keep him quiet.”
“Oh for fuck’s sake,” Harry groaned, causing Hermione to purse her lips momentarily at his language. Harry got up and went to the door, sticking his head out to make sure no one was nearby and might overhear. Satisfied, he ducked back inside and firmly closed the door, then returned to the bed. “Fine, something happened, okay. But no one, I repeat,
“The rest of us are going to help,” Terry Boot argued, folding his arms as he joined in on the conversation.
“What the bloody hell is he doing here?” Ron asked, finding his voice before Veronica did. At least he sounded baffled rather than angry, which was an improvement on the months after Dumbledore’s death where Ron had railed about Draco’s betrayal and hadn’t accepted a single word in the Slytherin’s defense.
“Severus, you are being unreasonable,” Dumbledore chided. “You need to go to Diagon Alley anyway to purchase your godson’s school things, having one more child along won’t make that much difference.”
“Oh, I never knew that,” Veronica whispered, though she supposed it did make sense. Sirius had carried a lot of anger during the short two years that she’d known him, so it did seem to fit what she knew of his character to mourn with anger.
aren’t doing anything,” Veronica said firmly. “Ron and Hermione and I have something we need to find, so we’ll be going to do that, but the rest of you-”
“Nope. No tossers here,” Veronica agreed. “Though now that you’re awake, do you think you could help me with something?”
“It can’t be worse than a heat,” Harry scoffed.
“This is one of the Deathly Hallows,” she said. “The Resurrection Stone. With it, you could meet your parents, and also… Well, you’ll still be able to see me, once I’ve…” Veronica didn’t finish the sentence. She couldn’t. Even if they’d been talking about it this whole time, it was still hard to say.
So really, Harry shouldn’t have been surprised when he was cornered in the hallway by three seventh years who were obviously alphas, even with their scents suppressed.
He was more than a little dizzy from the smells and losing hope in his chances of success when he collided with someone new, and, after finding their neck, he leaned in to have his nose filled with a pleasant odor of grass and wood and wind that reminded him of quidditch, with just the slightest herbal scent. Rosemary, maybe, in a small enough quantity to be enjoyable rather than overpowering. It was distinctly alpha, but not in an in-your-face sort of way, just a sort of calm strength that commanded respect without being authoritarian. The scent made him feel safe, and Harry felt himself relaxing for the first time since he’d left the common room for the party. This was the one. The person he would let claim him. If they wanted him that is.
Veronica didn’t even bother with any sort of commentary. She threw her arms around his shoulders and leaned in, only remembering at the last second not to crash into him like the night before. She stopped just short of collision, before moving the last half-inch at a more reasonable pace, their lips meeting in a gentle caress that made Veronica very glad she’d chosen life. Her eyes closed, and she sagged against Draco, who wrapped his arms around her and supported her literally in the same way he’d always supported her figuratively. Veronica didn’t think she could feel any more in love than she did right then.
“Besides,” Neville added, “with any luck, everyone will make it out of this mess alive. And with a bit more time, we should have plenty of luck on our side.”
“Fine, I’ll take it with me,” Veronica sighed, admitting defeat. She plucked the potion from where it still hovered and pocketed it. There was a small part of her that was glad for the potion, but at the same time… If she didn’t accept the vial, then someone else could have it. Someone else could take the potion, and it might make all the difference between whether they survived or perished. But then again, if she didn’t take it, and as a result, lost, then they might all die anyway. It wasn’t like the dark lord would be merciful towards anyone after they openly resisted him.
“Actually, yeah,” she replied. “Before I can kill Volde- Voldy, someone’s gotta take out his snake. I can’t explain why, but the snake has to go first. Can you do that?”
“Veronica, thank goodness,” Hermione gasped, pulling her into a hug. “We didn’t want to disturb you, but we figured you ought to know.”
“Wait, he thinks we’re…?” Harry trailed off, unable to answer the question.
Harry felt an exasperated rush of relief. Trust Malfoy to manage to stroke his own ego while still saving the day.
“True enough. And I suppose if you waited for me to do the asking then we’d never get around to dating,” Draco admitted. “But to answer your question, I can’t say I’ve seen the person you are looking for seeing as I am he, and one cannot see oneself without a mirror or the usage of magic, neither of which applies at the moment.”
“Though I do wish you would have lived a while longer,” James added. “Thought you’d at least live longer than we did.”
“Perhaps not,” Draco shrugged. He sighed, then added, “I’m really going to miss you, you know.”
“Only because he’s so terrible at it,” Hermione quipped.
“Alright,” Harry replied, feeling slightly unsteady. “But you know that everyone’s going to hear about that, including your father.”
“It still doesn’t seem very sensible,” Draco argued.
“I’m utterly revolted,” Malfoy said, his nose wrinkling delicately.
“I do not,” Draco rolled his eyes.
“You know I’m just joking,” he replied. “About me being lovelier I mean. I was serious about the rest. You’ve always been quite breathtaking to me. With or without a sunset.”
All too soon, she reached a clearing where the dark lord was waiting. All too soon, she pulled off the cloak and dropped the ring. All too soon, there was a flash of green light, and then there was nothing. Her final thought was that at least she’d said goodbye.
No potion or muggle pharmaceutical could prevent heats or ruts. Centuries of potioneers and herbalists and doctors had tried. Many had made wondrous discoveries, yet none had succeeded in finding any means of staving off that monthly menace. The only saving grace for alphas and omegas was medicines to reduce the effects of their ruts or heats, allowing them to at least remain functional, albeit miserable and horny.
“So like a crown sort of thing?” a younger Gryffindor asked. Almost every Ravenclaw cringed or rolled their eyes as Cho replied with straining patience, “Yes, but one designed for a woman.”
